“The Flame of Life.”
Gabriele D’Annunzio is one of the
few European novelists with a cosmo-
politan reputation ; and judged by his
current performance he is the most
notable of all. That is to say that there are men
living who have won a higher place in the field of
fictional art: but they have exhausted their
powers and tneir message. And D’Annunzio is
fast exhausting his. As poet, novelist, dramatist,
he has become famous ; but his latest work does
not reaoh the level of his fame. Technically he
has lost none of his mastery; but he has lost the
vitality whioh formerly inspired his technique,
and soon he will be only a husk of verbiage with
nothing germinal at the core.
Literary performance, of course, follows the
individual’s cycle of life ; and it is only the ignor-
ant and unthinking who expect from an aging
author the imaginative feats of his ardent youth.
Like the man, the author begins to die as soon as
born, and there is only question of so-mueh or so-
little time till the overshadowing Death swallows
also his power of fertile labour. His Spring con-
tains his Autumn; his Summer presupposes his
Winter; and at the height of his maturity he is
already far advanced in his decadence. Yet,
beguiled by the bubble Reputation, there are still
many who refuse to see that the physical parallel
is complete, since the intellectual faculties are
merely and solely physical functions. So
While the locks are yet brown on thy head,
While the soul still looks through thine eyes.
While the heart still pours
Thy mantling blood to thy cheek,
Sink, O youth, in thy soul !
Yearn to the greatness of Nature ;
Rally the good in the depths of thyself!
Because, when your locks are grey your brain is
grey too; and whatever your acquirement of
knowledge you will never regain the emotional
impetus which is the essence of creation. To
Youth potence, to Age impotence—in literature
as in life. And there is no Elixir.
D’Annunzio is aged 37 ; and in the Gioconda or
the Dead City, just as in his last novel, his
flame of life is waning. When he comes to write
“The Triumph of Life,” to close his series of
“Romances of the Pomegranate,” he will (curi-
ously, perhaps) have less life at his disposal than
when he wrote “The Triumph of Death;” and,
unless he can collect force for a final jet of fpower,
it is with Death and not with Life that he will
associate his masterpiece. Nevertheless, his work
has been the most splendid contribution to the
literature of recent Italy.
They say that D’Annunzio’s real name is
Rapagnetta; and that Gabriel of the Tidings, the
Augury, the Prophecy, is an egoistic statement of
the author’s view of his relation to the world set
forth in the Gabkiel Nunoius carved over the
door of the reception-room in his Florentine
villa. He was born at Francavilla, on the
Adriatic shore, and his first book of poems,
Primo Vero, made him famous through
literary Italy when he was only sixteen years
old. The savour of these and of later
poems is lost in translation ; hut so high,
so rich, is their poetic splendour that
Richard Garnett can write that if D’Annunzio’s
later work had perpetuated their promise, he ,
would be at the head not merely of Italian, but of
European poets. But in poetry, as in fiction,
he has latterly lost himself in luxuriant verbiage 1
—wonderful, almost magical, brilliant as a rain-
bow, perfumed like an alley of jasmine and gar- 1
denia, musical as a silver flute ; but lacking in the
primal life which is literature’s root. His dramas
have been, like his novels, the work of an essen-
tial poet, full of sound and colour, but with little
human significance.
“ The Flame of Life ”. was reviewed by
“ F.S.D.” on this page (from a rather narrow and
Philistinish standpoint) when it appeared as II
Fuoco last yqar. The English translation is made
for publisher Heinemann by his new wife,
“ Kassandra Vivaria, ” and, while more literal than
the English versions of some of D’Annunzio’s
earlier hooks, it has a stiffness of which the
Italian original shows no trace. Perhaps never has
D’Annunzio’s mastery of words been better shown
than in II Fuoco. Sometimes, indeed, he seems
“intoxicated with the exuberance of his own
verbosity 4 ” and in displaying the art of language
at its highest he has lost control of Art’s spirit of
emotion. So intense is his pleasure in words, so
superb his skill in arranging them, that he might
easily become a victim of verbal mania, and lose
contact with life altogether in developing his pic-
tures and representations of it.
“The Flame of Life” is rather a prose poem,
with the rhythm of music, than a novel as the
English mind is accustomed to consider a novel.
“The Flame” of the title wavers through the
book, rising and falling, waxing and waning,
blown to brilliancy or sinking so far that
the shadows of the background seem ready
to engulf it. And like a Wagnerian opera
the book turns and eddies on its axis, with
a continual repetition of motive phrases as the
characters pass and recur.
D’Annunzio has denied that the chief characters,
from whose agitated circling about each other the
Flame is born, represent himself and the great
actress Eleanora Duse ; but—he could not do
otherwise, and the correspondences are so close
that it is no wonder all Italy believes the book
to be the artistic expression of the fact. Seen
so, “ The Flame of Life ” is a history of a woman’s
tragedy which none of Duse’s rbles could surpass.
The celebrated liaison of De Musset with George
Sand suggests a parallel; but there the tragedy was
all the man’s. And George Sand was six years older
than De Musset; Duse is but three years older than
D'Annunzio; yet throughout “The Flame of
Life” runs La Foscarina’s passionate regret for
lost youth, her fears that she cannot hold the
lover who is all in all to her, that he will sooner
or later be seduced by a younger woman, strong
in the integrity of her unspoilt Spring. And
Stelio Effrena, the lover, is represented as owning
allegiance to none but himself, ruthlessly following
Nietzsche’s doctrine of self-development, self-
manifestation, at whatever cost to others. La
Foscarina yields her hopes, her life, willingly;
breathing only the woman’s plea of “Let me
serve!”
And Duse and D’Annunzio are linked in art, if
not in life : she creating the heroine’s part in his
plays through Europe; and lie relying on her
power as well as on his own for the reward of his
talent. “Infatuation,” Italians call it. For
D’Annunzio is no longer prepossessing, unless by
force of talent; and his egoism makes enemies.
Says a recent American writer: —
I saw D’Annunzio not long- ago ort the stage of the
Goldoni Theatre in Venice. Duse was playing La
Gioconda to a frantic house, and at the end of the first
act there were loud calls for the author. The author,
nothing loth, appeared. He was not an impressive spec-
tacle: Little, bald, prematurely wrinkled, aud grinning
like a schoolboy embarrassed with delight, he made an ill
figure beside the pale, tragic actress.
Why, then 1 Possibly because D'Annunzio,
whatever his faults, nourishes the Flame of Life ;
he is a creator ; and Duse but interprets, however
magnificently. When D’Annunzio dies his work
will remain 5 when Duse goes there will remain of
all her power only a memory—in the Bnipire of
Silenoe. So in devoting herself to receiving the
impressions of Stelio, to nourishing the germs of
“the Life-Bringer, ” La Eoscarina fulfils _ the
antique woman’s destiny, and reoovers the antique
man’s ideal founded on that primal relation of
the sexes which prooeeds uninfluenoed by all the
topsyturvydom of civilisation.
“The Flame of Life” opens with a splendid
evocation of Venioe, girdled with her thousand
zones of green ; and D’Annunzio creates from the
romantic city a magician’s palace of imaginative
language. So fine is his power over words, so
vivid his sight of form and colour, that he can
make his prose effigy a more living tiling than life
itself. Lead turns to gold in his alchemy ; and
gold glitters with a radiance never seen of ordi-
nary minds. He is the maker of Images more real
than reality, more true than truth. With a
breath he seems to generate worlds as a boy blows
bubbles, worlds of words, worlds of fancy, evoking
from mere symbols and their cadences the.aotual
principle of life.
At the beginning of the book Stelio Effrena, at
the height of his genius, surrounded by admirers
and worshippers, is exalting himself by the
further manifestation of his genius in an oration
in praise of Venice. La Foscarina, standing in
-the audience, yields him sympathy and inspira-
tion. Always he loves her, always is turning to
her ; yet always she is unhappy with the thought
that he may leave her for another —younger,
fuller of inspiration, or simply different. And
Stelio takes all as willingly as she gives, magnify-
ing his Ego, proving himself the ruthless Over-
Man of Nietzsche, believing and persuading
Fosca to believe that his first duty is to preserve
himself at his highest—“ at every hour, at every
second, to feel, fight, and strengthen himself
against destruction, diminution, violation, and
contagion.” From the conventional moral
standpoint Stelio is unspeakably selfish
and base. Yet is not his relation with
La Foscarina profoundly emblematic of
the perpetual relation of man and woman ? —are
he and she not types of the eternal strife at the
basis of every union ? The woman gives—and
what does she give ?—her life ; but the man gives
always the stimulus which is the basis of her life,
without which she cannot live, cannot fulfil her-
self, —cannot, for all the best of her, be other than
inert and wasted. And does not every woman
know it ? Vita sine amove mors.
Stelio's chief defender against the. charge of
selfish oppression would be La Foscarina herself.
The character of “ The Flame of Life ” has been
indicated : the book well deserves to be read and
studied. Not at the first glance do all the meanings
and implications arrive. It uncloses slowly like a
flower till petal after petal is displayed ; and at the
heart (D’Annunzio is justified of his title) there
trembles one more manifestation of the living flame
which in so many kinds and degrees permeates the'
universe.
One passage to hint the style merely,—remem-
bering the foreign tongue—and that the book is
so inwrought, so completely of one stuff woven,
that excerpts are necessarily barren. It is the
exalted lover’s imagination—
Who was she? Persephone, Queen of Shadows? Had
she lived there where all human agitations seem but
the wind’s sport amid the dust of an endless road ? Had
she seen the world where its springs are, counted in a
subterranean world the roots of flowers immovable like
the veins in a petrified body ? Was she tired or drunk
with human tears and laughter and lusts, and with hav-
ing touched all mortal things one by one to see them
blossom and to see them perish ? Who was she, then ?
Had she struck upon the cities like a curse ? Had
her kiss for ever closed all lips that sang ? Had
she stopped the throb of tyrannous souls, and
poisoned youths with the sweat of her body that
was salt like the foam of the sea ? Who was she ?
who was she? What was the past that made her so pale,
so ardent, and so perilous? Had she already told all her
secrets and given away all her gifts, or could she still
accomplish some new work that would bring wonder to
this new lover, to whom life, desire, and victory, all
three, meant one only thing ? All this and still more,
still more was offered to his dream by the thin veins on
her temples, the undulation of her cheeks, the power of
her body, the bluish-greenish shadow as of the sea that
was the element in which her face lived as the eye lives
in its own moisture.
That is worth reading for its own sake. It is very
much more worth reading in its place as a portion
of D’Annunzio’s book.
Mr. Batten’s confidence in himself is absolutely
justified. The idea of loyal hands placing away
Australia’s trousseau on the ocpasion of national
baptism is a far more original idea than any which
Mr. Evans has exploited. The warning to anti-
Federalists not to readjust the trousseau is no
more than those Antis deserve. And the final hope
that Australia will ride on an ocean with her
mother’s hand guiding her steps is just the kind
of hope which that kind of competition clamoured
for. In deference to the judgment of the Govt,
officials aforesaid (not to mention Lewis Scott)
The Bulletin will not say that Mr. Batten’s
“Ode” should have been preferred to Mr.
Evans’s. But it will say that it would just as
readily have given fifty guineas for one as for the
other. Floreat Wyalonga !
More “odes” are sent for comparison by W. 8.;
J.A.; Kelpie ; and many others ; but only Q.T.’s
falls to the level of the farce—
ODE TO THE BANQUETEERS.
Awake ! Arise ! The Banqueteers
Are beating at the Town Hall door !
The bunghole stops have been withdrawn,
The beery vapours smells galore !
Rise roysterously, O sons, and drown
Etc., etc.
After this, is it possible to be serious and say
that nowhere was there printed the ode or the
poem that we needed—such a one as the young
Swinburne could have written us ? Roderic
Quinn’s " House of the Commonwealth,” in S.M.
Herald, was by long odds the most poetical pifece ;
but it pulsed too feebly, it lacked force and fire.
No ; Quinn is better as a lyrist, Yet ’twas full
of fine thoughts, finely expressed ; and the final
invocation (final as written ; for the printing seems
muddled) held some dignity—
O Light in the Darkness,
0 Godhead above us !
Lend counsel and light;
Be near us and love us.
O Maker of Nations,
Bestead us and make us
So firm in the future
That nothing shall shake us t
We built for Thy Glory,
Thy Wisdom beseeching ;
We founded and fashioned
Our house on Thy Teaching.
Lest treason should rend it,
Or red war enfold it,
Be near it, O Maker,
Be near and uphold it!
Brunton Stephens’s “Australia F ederata ” Ml
flat as the composition of a poetical proser in-
evitably will. Good old Brunton has a poet’s
instincts and a pedagogue’s language; and from
the fusion comes work often readable, charming,
and suggestive—never remarkably inspiring.
Perhaps his “Forecast ” of Australia shone with
a brighter flame than most of his other
verses—and this new “Fulfilment” was
sadly hampered by being written in
sequence to that “Forecast.” When he can
print both together (as indeed S.M. Herald should
have printed them) he may be justified in their
merging.
For the rest—what was there ? Feeble
rhymes on stilts (when they didn’t tumble
off the stilts and laboriously pick them-
selves up again, take halting breath, and stalk on
anew) by It. R. Garran, who can nullify his
seryices to Federation only by dropping into
Wegg-made “poetry” about it. Feeble rhymes
by half-a-dozen others —to-day printed by com-
' plaisant editors, and to-morrow in the dust-bin.
Not one thing that was thoroughly good ; nothing
that was fully worthy.
Abase yourselves, ye poets of Australia! for
the Bridegroom-opportunity has come and gone,
and you were asleep, or lazy, or had no oil in
your lamps, or not enough blood and brains in
your heads, or something, or nothing. Don’t
demur ; don’t retort; for you had the magnificent
chance of your lives, and you missed it. Now you
sit without the Gate in sackcloth and ashes ; but
it is vain to beat and implore, for the Kingdom of
Heaven and the Fifty Guineas are the property
of Messrs. Geo. Essex Evans and Henry Batten—
or of Messrs. Henry Batten and Geo. Essex
Evans.
O Lord ! O Lewis Scott!

Donald Macdonald’s story of “ How We Kept
the Flag Flying” at Ladysmith reprints his
letters from South Africa to several Australian
papers ; and does him journalistic credit. As a
book, it holds too much detail; but possibly there
was no time to re-write with a wider sweep.
Macdonald’s thoughtful attitude gives his work
depth and value which other war-commentators
have lacked.
Edward Dyson’s first novel, at present called
“ Dick Haddon, and Some Others,” has been

first appear serially in Longman’s Magazine.
THE BOOKFELLOW
"Death as Friend”.
IN help of “ Albyn ” (15/12/0) “W.S.H.H.”
sends the verses which George Du Maurier
published in Eng. Illus. Magazine for ’B4
(vol. i, p. 542) —
Kindly watcher by my bed, lift no voice in prayer,
Waste not any words on me when the hour is nigh—
Let a stream of melody bub flow from some sweet player,
And meekly will I lay my head and fold my hands to die,
Sick am I of idle words, past all reconciling—
Words that weary and perplex, and pander and conceal;
Wake the sounds that cannot lie, for all their sweet
beguiling;
The language one need fathom not, but only hear and
feel.
Let them roll once more to me, and ripple in my hearing,
Like waves upon some lonely beach where no craft
anchoreth ;
That I may steep my soul therein, and craving naught,
nor fearing,
Drift on through slumber to a dream, and through a
dream to death. ■
These were given as Du MaurieFs from the
French of Madame Neckar; but “W.S.H.H.”
forwards “L’Agonie” by Sully Frudhomme as
the original French source.
L’AGONIE.
Vous qui m’aiderez dans mon agonic,
Ne me dites rien :
Faites que j’entends un peu d’harmonie,
Et je mourrai bien.
La musique apaise, enchante, et dAlie
Des choses d’en bas ;
Bercez ma douleur, je vous en supplie,
Ne lui parlez pas.
Je suis las des mots, je suis las. d’en tendre
Ce qui peut mentir ;
J’aime mieux lessons qu’au lieu de compiendre
Je n’ai qu’a sentir.
Urte rrklodie, oil Tame se plonge,
Et qui sans effort
Me fera passer du delire att songe,
Du songe k la mort.
And the French is stated to be a version of a
German poem-“ Der Tod als Freund. Oan

THE howls of the people who wanted to stage
little pieces in the N.S.W. theatre where
G. E. Evans’s ode-farce won the plaudits ot
an equity judge, a land-court president,
an art-gallery trustee, and Lewis bcott
(Great Scott !) have not yet died away
Nay, verily, they beset The Bulletin with
force undiminished. It now becomes known
that many of the “odes” were contributed by
patients in lunatic asylums and prisoners m gaols
—whose nurses and warders amiably forwarded
the compositions in order “to please the poor
blokes”—and naturally these odists are enraged
that a sane freeman should have triumphed over
their distress and ignominy.
Then The Bulletin has a complaint from an
“ odist ” who points out that the judges knew Mr.
Evans’s identity with the “ celebrated Queensland
poet,” and thinks their judgment, went green at
the sight of laurels. Further, it is alleged that
the judges selected Mr. Evans’s “ode” before
the reported “closing-time,” and asked him to
amend it that they might welcome it with a whole
heart and fifty guineas. If that be true, the
same “license veiled in freedom’s name” (Ode
Triumphant, stanza vi) should have been given
to other competitors—that is, there-.should have
been a competition de novo. On second thoughts,
there shouldn’t ; for now the farce is all one
piece.
Wyalong (N.S.W.) Star reprints the “Ode”
in company with that offered by a local bard, Mr.
Henry Batten, of West Wyalong; and Mr.
Batten, in forwarding the clipping, asks for The
Bulletin’s opinion of “the merits or demerits of
each.” Well, an opinion of Mr. Evans’s “ode”
has already been printed; and Mr. Batten’s
speaks for itself. Here is Mr. Batten’s —
FEDERATED AUSTRALIA.
JANUARY 1, 1901.
Australia’s national baptism
Is taking place to-day ;
Let loyal hands dismantle her—
The trousseau place away.
Ah, leave her like our Mother Eve,
Just from her Maker’s hand—
A statue fair to look upon,
Great, Glorious and Grand.
Chorus:
In the pride of the Southern Ocean,
In the land that’s dear to me,
You want but true devotion,
To be Australians free !
Let no false pretending Patriot,
Her garments readjust;
Arrayed in robes, of righteousness,
Admire her all men must.
May God provide her with true Friends*,
To make her land their home ;
Then her place she’ll proudly take,
Like that of ancient Rome.
Conquest crowning her peaceful brow,
Contentment in her breast;
Be not as the Romans were,
Lulled into idle rest.
Let her sons be on the watch,
Xnd keep her Standard high ;
The world will know Australia lives,
And does not mean to die !
In this world of Martial Nations,
She can justly take her stand,
And find a home for all her friends
From every distant land.
As a Power beneath the sun,
She never can decline ;
A mighty nation must remain
Until the end of Time.
With the fostering hand of England,
Her first infant steps to guide,
Upon the ocean of the world
In Freedom she may ride.
With Great Britain watching on
With true maternal care,
Australia, like a trusting child,
Her joys and sorrows share.
West Wyalong, Nov. 12,1900.

The best cough drops are drops ot
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral.
The next time you
take cold, dose your-
self with a lot of
home remedies and
dilly-dally along un-
til your cough is
deep-seated and you
are threatened with ,
pneumonia or con-
sumption. That’s
one way, to be sure.
xz
Here’s another way: Take
Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral
at bedtime and he all right the next
morning. Isn’t this the better way?
Then continue the Cherry Pectoral a
few days until your throat and lungs
have completely healed and all danger
of future trouble is past.
Another grand thing about Ayer’s
Cherry Pectoral is that it cures hard
coughs, the hardest kind of old coughs,
even after all other remedies have failed.
Put up in large and small bottles.
When it hurts your lungs to cough,
then apply one of Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral Plasters directly over the painful
lung. It will quiet the pain, remove all
congestion, and greatly strengthen.

Various Verses.
The Boon!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Because the stroke that closed my boyhood’s
eyes ”
(’Twas Shem the Blind who bent him low in
prayer)
“ Hath made this earth a dreary prison-cell,
Hath taken all the beauty from the flowers,
Hath darkened all the loveliness of Dawn,
And stolen all the splendour of the stars —
I pray thee, mighty goddess, grant a boon ! ”
There came a wind that shook the mighty veil,
There fell a whisper soft as falling dew,
And through the Temple’s hush he heard the
words :
“And if I grant it, son, what boon were thine?”
“The city rabble flout me day by day,
The women mark my step with words of scorn,
My kin they call me burden to my face,
My brother mocked me sore this very morn ;
And so, to still the storm within my breast,
And render all the land an equal due,
I pray thee, grant me this, O goddess, dear —
Do thou blot out the sun ! ”
That night in peace
She sent him sleeping to the sunless land.
Q.
P. LUFTIG.
The City.
The long day’s work is over,
And the night bejewelled and gay,
Ravishing lover and lover,
Scatters the weft of day.
And the dozing city wakes
To welcome her children in
To her carnival of ale and cakes
And foolishness and sin.
Like cattle the sweltering masses
Move restlessly, uncouth ;
A hansom plunges and passes
With its freight of folly and youth.
They crush to the playhouse cover,
To the reeking, glaring bars,
And —the town is again turned over
To the harlot and the stars.
Oh, long as the race endures,
Poor trull of a life’s disgrace,
The city shall have a soul like yours—
But I have seen its face.
L.L.
The Spinners.
Through a bitter book I read,
And it scorned the things that be
Out of sight and out of reach :
Then I walked an ocean-beach
Where young children sat or sped,
And a fancy came to me.
Youth’s a place of shining ways
Where the winds are like a lute,
And the youngsters, heart and hand,
Spin forever ropes of sand,
Though old Wisdom often says,
“ Ropes of yarn would better suit.”
Comes a time of fireside dreams,
And we dimly understand
That an hour is drawing nigh
When shall snap the surest tie
Strand by strand, until it seems
Ropes of yarn are ropes of sand.
Left I then my lonely walk,
Sad—ah, strangely sad, my heart !
But in darkness met a friend :
“ Friend,” I said, “ the world may end—
Scoffers sneer and cynics talk ;
Thou and I shall never part.”
N.S.-W.
RODERIC QUINN.
From Edelweiss, the Melbourne Swiss
newspaper:
One for All, All for One is our well-known national
device. It might be less known that this device has
found a great admirer in Sultan Abdul Hamid. A couple
of years ago, when the Emperor and Empress of Germany
visited the Holy Land, they also went to see their good
friend and brother, the Sultan, in Constantinople. The
Empress was introduced in the Imperial harem. Over
the entrance door she noticed an inscription in golden
letters. Asking its meaning she was told that it was a
device coming from the west, which pleased Sultan Abdul
Hamid so well that he ordered it to be written over the
portico of his harem, and that it meant —“One for All,
All for One.”
A British-Canadian, writing to St. James’s
Gazette, hopelessly knocks the bottom out of the
fairy tales that have been cabled to Australia
about the eagerness of the French-Canadians to
fight for Britain in S. Africa. “In the event of
an Anglo-French war, Canada would contain a
million and a half nominal British subjects, all
secretly, if not openly, hostile to the flag to which
they owe allegiance. . . . Sir Wilfrid Laurier
had to be dragooned by his Anglo-Saxon sup-
porters into consenting to send a contingent to the
Transvaal. . . . And the French press bristles
with covert sneers at British reverses, and open
rejoicings at Boer successes.” All tin's the writer
attributes to the non-prohibition of the official
and scholastic use of the French language
in Canada. It is Britain’s misfortune, in
fact, that in dealing with conquered peoples
she goes too far, and yet not far enough ; her
practically piratical enterprises b >'ng h'ariipered
ever by her would-be humanitarianism. Imarch
knew what he was about when he interdicted the
use of French in the schools of Alsace-Lorraine.

Yankee Doodle at the Front!
An incident in the Boer war as related by a returned Officer.
regiment of our Australian infantry was travelling (Its depicted in
the smaller photograph) to Belmont. At Graspan we were
xc
entertained by the
garrison of Gordon
Highlanders sta-
tioned there, and
when taking our
departure by rail
were accorded the
customary musical
send - off by the
garrison band,
which, on this occa-
sion, consisted of
two drummers and
a piper. As our
train moved off I
heard the cry on
all sides from our
b o y S __«Yankee Doodle!!’ ‘Yankee Doodle!!’ and there in the distance
was an almost exact representation of the Yankee Doodle tobacco brand
so familiar to all Australians. The band after seeing us aboard were
returning back along the road to camp, and as we passed they sturdily
marched and played, whilst we, with the familiar tableau before us
reminding us so of home, cheered wildly. I instantly took out my kodak,
and, although the train was moving fast, secured a fairly good picture,
with the idea that perhaps my friends (the Dixsons) in Australia would like
to have it. On many a weary march afterwards, when smoking the army
regulation tobacco, did we long for just one pipe of the old far-off favorite.”

Notice to Subscribers in Victoria, S. Australia,
Westralia and Maoriland.
In consequence of the imposition of One Halfpenny
postage on Interprovincial Newspapers, the annual sub-
scription outside N.S. Wales (except Queensland) is now
€l, with 2s. 2d. added for postage.
No newspaper can be sent unless the subscription is
prepaid. There will be no exception to this rule.
To Subscribers in Queensland.
Owing to the imposition of\\d. postage, the subscription
to The Bulletin to Queensland will be £1 6s. 6d. per
annum, payable in advance.
To ease otfin some degree the burden of the unreasonable
postage—\\d. on a Bulletin of ordinary weight—now
exacted by the Queensland Post Office, a special Thynne-
paper edition of The Bulletin is now sent to Queensland.
SATURDAY, JANUARY 19, 1901.
Newspaper Postage.
Three States of the Commonwealth —
Westralia, Tasmania and New South Wales
—have for many years carried local news-
papers free through the post, and the news-
paper owners of N.S. Wales, at all events,
are disposed to kick hard before they
surrender this privilege. The paper-owning
caste in the other two States isn’t large
enough or strong enougli to make a very
audible disturbance, but it will also, no
doubt, both above and below ground, fight
vigorously ere it gives up the valuable
blessing of having its merchandise carried at
somebody else’s expense. In the Common-
wealth, postage-rates must be uniform ; it is
either a case of abolishing newspaper-postage,
charges in three States where they now
exist, or establishing them in three States
where they don’t exist. The sum at issue is
somewhere between £150,000 and £lBO,OOO
a year, assuming that the imposition
of a postal-rate obliterates all the
great mass of trade circulars and
church and Sunday-school rags that now
dishonestly masquerade as newspapers in the
free-postage States, and that the number of
papers circulated through the post annually
for each inhabitant gets down all round to
the level of the three States where postage
rates are already enforced. That is to say,
from £150,000 to £lBO,OOO is the present
amount, but it will double and treble and
quadruple as population increases. And the
question arises at the very beginning of the
discussion: Can Australia, with its huge
debts, its five accumulated deficits, its con-
stant futile struggles to make ends meet, its
perpetual borrowing, its increasing military
expenditure, and its incessant Treasury
“ fakes ” to make 2d. look like 4d. and to
persuade the people that it is sd.—can it
afford to throw away all this revenue even in
order that its Government may thereby pur-
chase the precarious friendship of a small
crowd of rich men ? The Bulletin is dead
sure that it can’t.
* • * »
The free newspaper postage business, as
The Bulletin has seen it in N.S.W., is a
curious arrangement. It is a most remark-
able system of Protection introduced in an
allegedly Freetrade State. The majority of
the N.S.W. city papers are professedly Free-
trade, and they have for years enjoyed Pro-
tection to the extent of 50 per cent, on a
penny paper, and over 8 per cent, on a six-
penny one. And while preaching Freetrade
and declaring their readiness to perish in
the last- ditch for the sake of Freetrade, they
have somehow conveyed to every Government
the impression that if it deprived them of their
special share of Protection they would pre-
sently wipe it out, and leave its bones to
whiten in the political wilderness. A good
part of northern and western and southern
N.S.W. is nearer to Brisbane, Adelaide, and
Melbourne respectively than to Sydney, and
as a matter of choice, if trade was free, these
places would take the Brisbane, Adelaide, or
Melbourne penny dailies instead of the
Sydney ones. But trade isn’t free; the
Freetrade city press has carefully attended
to that; and the fact that the Brisbane,
Adelaide, or Melbourne penny paper costs
by post, while the Sydney one, carried
at the exnense of the general tax paper, costs
only Id., gives the latter a very long start.
* «* * *
The free-postage idea is also a shabby little
device for helping the N.S. W. city paper at
the expense of its N.S.W. country rival.
The average country paper has a humble
little circulation in one town or thereabouts.
It might grow to be a respectable and valu-
able organ of public opinion, if it had a
chance, but it hasn’t a chance. It pays
heavy freight on its supply of paper, coming
up from Sydney, to be printed ; the paper
supply of the Sydney publication comes
up free merely because it is already printed!
All its N.S.W. political news has to be wired
from Sydney at heavy cost ; the city paper
gets its political news on the spot without
wiring, and when it is printed the State
kindly carries it gratis. The city paper has
a great advantage, to begin with, in having
430,000 possible subscribers at its door ;
therefore it is larger and'richer than its
country contemporary in a small town, with
perhaps 1000 possible adjacent subscribers.
So the Government interferes to make the
large and rich city paper still larger and richer
by carrying it free to every country town and
hamlet, and to every lone public-house and
station and selection in the State. By way of
irony, it offers to carry the country paper free
also, but the country paper only circulates,
as a rule, in its own little town —it never
gets beyond that because the State-subsidised
city daily is already too strongly entrenched
—and the free postage system does it little
good. It finds it very hard, even, to circu-
late to any extent in its own immediate
vicinity when the State carries the big city
journal in red-hot haste for 400 miles or so
by special train to deliver it gratis to the
house next door to the struggling country
editor’s office. It might hold its own better
if it was better worth reading. But the
fierce competition of the State-subsidised
city paper makes it difficult for any country
paper to earn enough to make itself worth
reading.
* * * *
The whole system tends to concentrate the
newspaper influence in Sydney, to drive the
literary ability of the whole State to Sydney,
to enable Sydney to manufacture the public
opinion of the whole State, and to bloat the
newspaper owners of Sydney at the State’s
expense. Sydney papers write up current
politics in Sydney’s interests and from
Sydney’s standpoint, and even if that has no
relation at all to the country’s interests or
the country’s standpoint the country is taxed
to carry Sydney’s ready-made opinions to
everybody’s door. It would be a parallel
case if the State took to conveying beer free
by rail, and the little country brewery (which
supplied only its own town and district and
got no benefit from the free beer postage)
found itself extinguished by a system whereby
Tooth and Toohey’s city product was carried
all over N.S. W. at the country’s expense, and
delivered free at the public-house right
opposite the country brewery, while the local
man had to carry his own beer across the
street to the same public-house at his own
cost. Someone would probably complain
in these circumstances that Providence never
intended Sydney to monopolise the brewing
trade of N.S.W. If the State took to carry-
ing Sydney boots and saddlery in like man-
ner, somebody would probably complain
again. Yet that would only be an extension
of the same policy of concentrating every-
thing in Sydney. The only difference is
that brewers and bootmakers have never
developed the hunger after pauper aid, and
the insolent rapacity in preying on the
Treasury, that characterise the Sydney news-
paper owners. If they had done so, free
beer-postage would probably be an accom-
plished fact.
* * * *
The plea advanced by Sydney newspaper
owners is that newspapers are an educative
influence, and should be carried free on high
moral grounds. The Bulletin has doubts
about these high moral grounds. Education
is also an educative influence, but it isn’t
free in N.S.W., and no Sydney daily has
been conspicuous in its demands that it
should be made free. In fact, the S.M.
Herald once incautiously remarked that
the Treasury couldn’t stand the* expense of
absolutely-free primary education—though as
much was being spent by the State on free-
postage as would have sufficed to provide for
the total abolition of school-fees. Books are
an educative influence, but their circulation
in the illiterate backblocks is hampered by
heavy postal charges and railway freights.
The pious, respectable, black-coated, black-
hatted gentlemen who conduct the Sydney
dailies tvould hardly venture to say that
their report of the Coningham case was
purer or more elevating literature than the
Sermon on the Mount, yet they have never
once demanded that the Scripture shall cir-
culate through the post without charge for
the public good, though their demands that
their divorce news and betting news and
dog news shall go free for the public good
have been loud and terrible. The noblest
book ever written costs 2id. postage for
lOoz. within the borders of New South
Wales, and the doggiest lOoz. paper ever
published costs nothing. And except when
free postage is in question, even the
Sydney daily press seldom agrees about
anything except that its own paper is
all right, and that the ignorance and inac-
curacy disseminated by the other papers for
the misdirection of the people is something
lamentable. At ordinary times it is possible
to take 10 ordinary papers and find out that
each of them (on the authority of the other
nine) is merely a means of deluding the
public and stoking it with error and ignor-
ance. It is only when the free postage
swindle is oh deck that the average paper
begins to be filled with admiration of the
educative character of the other paper and
of papers in general. And apropos of this
aspect of the case : The most shamefully-
illiterate State in the Australasian group is
Tasmania —which enjoys the enlightening
influences that are said to arise from ree
newspaper postage. The most politica y
backward State in the group is Westralia
—and it also enjoys the same form
of alleged enlightenment. And JN.S. W.,
which does enjoy this so-called educa-
tive influence, has twice as large a
proportion of illiterate adults as Victoiia,
which doesn’t. This statement is based on
the marriage statistics supplied in Oogh-
lan’s “Seven Colonies.” The number of
illiterates who get married is probably a fair
evidence of the number of illiterates in
general. *
Even if the free carriage of the city papers
dog news and divorce intelligence, and the
gratis conveyance of the Sydney Herald
and Telegraph’s amazing articles of rather
over a year ago in which these papers both
gravelv informed the public that the 19th
century ended at the end of 1899 even if
things like these were necessarily education,
quite as good a case could be made out for
carrying drapery free as for doing the like
with newspapers. The law—which presum-
ably knows something, however little -
doesn’t regard it as a crime to be with-
out a paper. It does regard it as a
crime to be without clothes. It doesn t
run a man in for being illiterate,
but it does run him in for being
publicly in a state of undress. If it is neces-
sary to make papers cheap by carrying them
at the public charge in order to abolish ignor-
ance, it is at least as necessary to carry
clothes at the public charge in order to
abolish nakedness, the law having clearly
defined the latter as the offence which most
requires abolition. Besides, the experience
of Victoria as against Tasmania appears to
prove that the free postage of newspapers
doesn’t necessarily reduce ignorance. The
fact that the encouragement of clothes
diminishes nakedness hasn’t been called in
question by anybody that The Bulletin
has yet met.
J * * « *
In any case free newspaper postage has
degenerated into a farcfe. Nowadays, almost
every enterprising Sydney dealer periodi-
cally prints a new price list, puts in one
corner a time-worn an* cdote about the
sagacity of a horse in order to give it a sem-
blance of literature, registers his trade-
advertisement as a newspaper, and forth-
with sends 50,000 or 100,000 copies all over
N.S.W. at the cost of the patient community.
Any number of churches issue a weekly rag
about the size of a sheet of notepaper, with
a demand for subscriptions and an invitation
to come and hear Pastor Bellowmore next
Sunday. Schools, refuges, insurance-
societies, dealers in fishing-tackle, and all
manner of human sundries issue “news-
papers ” each with its own solitary little
advt. And the people of N.S.W. pay for
the conveyance of between ten and twenty
millions of these each year ! Even if the
public is willing to be taxed for the convey-
ance of newspapers it was never proposed
that it should carry anything and everything
which chose to call itself a newspaper. But
the whole system is foolish and cumbersome.
A newspaper is as much a private money-
making speculation as a whisky shop or a
boot emporium. If newspapers were run to
supply education in the first place they
would have a special claim on the public ;
being run to keep their proprietors out of
the Benevolent Asylum in the first place,
they should stand on their own merits.
Inasmuch as papers supply a certain amount
of knowledge as a purely secondary con-
sideration a point might be strained in their
favor if the Treasury had any money to
waste, but it hasn’t. And even then the
fact that the free-postage States make such
a very bad showing so far as the spread of
education is concerned makes it doubtful if
this is the best way to waste the Treasury
surplus, supposing there was such a thing.
The Alleged Burden of Protection.
Among N.S.W.’s recent exports was a globular
gentleman with an eye-glass bound on a mission
to teach Tasmania and other adjacent States the
beauties and advantages of Freetrade or else pure
revenue-tariffism —G. Reid doesn’t mind which he
advocates, and he never practised either. And
the telegraph washes up -the preliminary samples
of the globular man’s oratory on the shores of the
S.M. Herald, the following specimens being from
Launceston :
Mr. Reid compared the respective positions of Victoria
under Protection and N.S.W. under Freetrade to the dis-
advantage of the former State. The mother State, he
stated, boasted of natural industries, which thrived with-
out being an imposition on the taxpayer, while in Vic-
toria the people were taxed to sustain industries which
lived only through being coddled by the State. He
pointed out how N.S.W. had prospered under Freetrade,
and referred to the great reception accorded him during
the Commonwealth celebrations in Sydney. The true
method of fostering industries was not by restrictive bar-
riers, but by cultivating what the rest of the world lacked.
He refuted the arguments of the Protectionist that Great
Britain through her Freetrade policy was decaying. As
a matter of fact, she was stronger now than ever. The re-
ports of labour delegates sent from England to America
had been published to the effect that the working man in
Freetrade England was better off than his brother in Pro-
tected America. He contended that Protection was not
necessary for a young country, as its advocates asserted.
Australia, as had been proved in the case of N.S.W., was
capable of building industries natural to the soil without
dipping into the pocket of the people to keep them in
existence, &c., &c.
* * * *
And The Bulletin asks G. Reid once more,
why on earth he didn’t practise Freetrade, or
at least pure revenue - tariffism, when he
was in office, if it is so beautiful. Bure
revenue-tariffism, as followed in Britain where the
good Freetraders come from, is just this: If you
have to levy an import duty on some article in
order to gam revenue you levy an exactly equal
excise duty on the locally-made article, and put
the two on the same footing, and leave them to
fight it out without favor on either side. And
instead of doing this Reid levied a heavy import
duty (ss. per gallon) on wine and levied no excise
duty, thereby sacrificing an immense amount of
urgently-needed revenue in order to protect the
local wine industry contrary to his alleged prin-
ciples. And he also sacrificed much revenue to
protect local sugar, tobacco, beer, cigars, con-
fectionery, jams, and a good many other things
in exactly the same fashion. The spectacle
of a Premier outraging his principles to
get revenue is old enough, but the spectacle
of a Premier outraging his alleged principles,
and following a policy which, he swears on his
solemn and globular oath, is most injurious to the
country, and sacrificing revenue to do it, is quite
new.
* * * *
And it is a pity that Reid doesn’t stop in his
wild and promiscuous career and explain how the
Victorian taxpayer is taxed to maintain his
“ artificial industries.” The Foreign-trade orator
never explains this. He always alludes airily to
the burden which the taxpayer has to bear in Pro-
tectionist countries in order to support his indus-
tries, and throws the remark about in the same off-
hand manner as he might use in alluding to the well-
known fact that Henry Parkes was beheaded in
1066 by order of Charles I. He implies that the
fact of the Victorian taxpayer having to carry an
extra burden is too well-known to require proof,
and thereby saves himself a lot of trouble. Yet
the burden, to begin with, doesn’t take the form
of less work, for Victoria, with a smaller area and
a smaller population, provides work for 60,070
people in its factories against N.S.W.’s 55,646.
And it doesn’t take the form of less wages, for the
Victorian workman is better paid, on the whole,
than the N.S.W. one. The following list shows
the maximum and minimum wages paid in all the
leading industries of the two States. It isn’t
mere yell and assertion like Reid’s own state-
ments, but is taken from reliable Government
publications, and anybody who has doubts can
verify it for himself down to the last figure. The
information is to be found in Part 111. of the just
published “ Victorian Year Book,” pages 602 to
606, and in the N.S.W. “Statistical Register,”
also just published, pages 967 to 1013.
These figures may be summed up as follows: —
There are 194 quotations for each State. In 20
cases equal wages are paid in each State. Out of
the other 174 cases the Victorian wage is higher
in 10G cases, and the N.S.W. wage is higher in 68.
So apparently the extra burden that the Victorian
taxpayer carries in order to support his arti-
ficial industries ” doesn’t come on him in the
shape of reduced wages. Nor does it appear that
it comes to him in the form of extra rent, for
Coghlan, on pages 617 and G2O of the “Seven
Colonies” for 1899-1900, sets down the annual
rental value of Sydney and suburbs at £4,995,200
and of Melbourne and suburbs —a larger area with
a larger population—at only £3,973,357. This

seems to imply, in a general way, that 16s. goes
as rar to pay rent in Melbourne as 20s. does in
Sydney.
* * * *
Again there is no evidence that the alleged
load and dead-weight of supporting his artificial
industries strike the Victorian in the way of extra
prices. Ihe following are the lowest rates quoted
tor some articles in daily use by a cheap grocery
firm in Melbourne and another in Sydney accord-
mg to their own published price-lists, which lists
are available for inspection at The Bulletin
office:—
Out of 21 common groceries the prices are the same
in three cases ; the Melbourne firm is cheaper on
eleven articles, and the Sydney one on seven. The
“burden” carried by the Victorian taxpayer
doesn’t stick out very prominently here either.
* * * *
And the burden which takes so much looking
for and is so hard to find doesn’t stand out very
prominently in the matter of accumulated wealth.
Victoria has an average of £7 16s. per inhabitant
in its savings banks against N.S.W’s £7 Bs. sd.
per inhabitant (Coghlan’s “ Seven Colonies ” for
1899-1900, page 751). It has £34 os. 7d. per in-
habitant of total bank deposits against N.S.W’s
£3l 9s. lid. (same volume, page 752). It has over
£1,200,000 more coin and bullion in its banks than
N.S.W. (same volume, page 745.) And yet Vic-
toria has a smaller debt and a smaller accumu-
lated deficit. Among all these matters it would
be well if the remarkable G. Reid, instead of
simply urging the public not to load itself like
Victoria with heavy burdens for the support of
“ artificial industries,” would give the exact name
and address of the alleged incubus. It is a fine,
easy, off-hand matter to allude airily to the
burden, or the hippopotamus, or the boojum, or
any other sonorous noun with a fine rolling sound
in it, but it is always best to epmmence at the
beginning and show where the burden hangs out.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Exit Dickson.
Poor old James Dickson, of Queensland, didn’t
live long to enjoy either his title or his position as
Minister for Defence in the first Commonwealth
Government. He carried the Federal honor and
the imported degradation for about seven days in
all—in fact, he was known to be a man on the
verge of the grave when he took office, and his
swearing-in was little more than an empty form.
It may possibly be suggestive of something that
the man who dropped out so promptly was the
only non-Australian in the Federal Government,
and his death leaves it, for the time at least, a
purely Australian Ministry. Poor old Dickson
was the weakest, though by no means the least
intelligent, meffiber of the Government. The
seven portfolio-holders fell naturally into classes.
There were first, the men who knew a
great deal but lacked something in deci-
sion—Barton. Turner, Deakin, and Dick-
son, There was next, the man with plenty
of decision who didn’t know much, which was
Lyne. Forrest was the man with lots of decision
who knew practically nothing. And Kingston,
as the man who knew as much as any of them
and had the resolution of a steam-hammer thrown
in, formed a class by himself. Among the men
who knew things but lacked strength of will, poor
kindly old Dickson was the one of least import-
ance. He doesn’t make a large gap, but his
departure upsets arrangements a good deal all the
. same. Tasmania has already been using language
unbecoming its usual state of repose about being
.represented in the Federal Cabinet only by
Honorary Minister Lewis, while Westralia, with
.less population, has a whole real Minister all to
.itself. Tasmania is now largely of opinion that
.Honorary Minister Lewis should be promoted to
the vacant portfolio, and that Queensland should
take its turn at the honorary business till the next
vacancy. Of course the third State in point of
population can’t be treated in this off -hand fashion,
and so the chances are that Tasmania will use some
extra-bad language presently. Another trouble is
that among the Queensland gang-in-office, Dick-
son was absolutely the only man of any note
whose career made him look anything like a fit
member of a democratic all-Australian govern-
ment. According to dry and hide-bound precedent,
it seems that the Queensland Federal Minister
must be someone representative of the party in
power—that is until the Federal Parliament takes
the matter in hand and the parties in power in
mere State Parliaments cease to count for any-
thing. And the Philp-Rutledge-Chataway
push is a curious aggregation out of which to find
a democratic Federal office-holder. If Drake
could apostatise back again without making too
•cumbersome and ungraceful a somersault he
might be worthy of some consideration, but
Drake’s last somersault was a saddening spec-
tacle, and the back view Queensland had of him
as he got over the fence is a painful memory to
.this day.

Victoria’s Old-Age Pensions.
“Victorian police courts and post offices-have been
thronged the last few days by all sorts and condi-
tions of ancients, getting forms and applying for
their pensions. Already applications number
about 18,000, and though the rush has eased off,
there are probably a few more to come in. The
•outlay will be large, but against it must be placed
the relief of the Benevolent Asylums, Homes,
and other charitable funds. (At Melbourne City
Court, out of 400 applicants, one-third gave some
•charitable institution as their address.) And
already the Argus, with its usual want of logic,
raises the point that the receipt of eleemosynary
assistance disentitles to a pension, ignoring the
patent fact that compulsory residence in a charit-
able “ home ” is the best prima facie evidence of a
right to claim a pension, provided claimant is over
the age or is disabled. Under this disablement
clause the magistrates will have to decide some
nice points. Among applicants at the City Court
were a painter who was disabled by a fall iiom a
ladder, and some laborers who had strained
themselves lifting heavy weights, also
a man of 50 or 55, partially paralysed.
It is already announced, by the way, that
Treasurer Turner is broken up in mind at the
rush of applicants, and thinks of reducing the
amount of the pensions, though considering
Maoriland’s experience, and further allowing for
the fact that Turner’s Act extends relief to some
classes not included in the Maoriland system, it
is difficult to see how he could have expected the
demand to be any less. Anyhow, it would be a
weak and wicked and cruel thing to withdraw
even a part of his promised aid merely because he
has made a miscalculation, and after undertaking
to lift the aged poor out of their slough of misery
to drop them even partly back into it again for
reasons of small economy. Victoria’s financial
engagements to its own aged poor are every whit
as solemn as its engagements to its foreign bond-
holders. It has pledged itself, morally if not
legally, to supply its destitute ancients with a
certain sum sufficient to support them after
a humble fashion in their declining years.
The sum mentioned is so moderate that it can’t
be reduced without making the promised support
a mockery. If the revenue is insufficient to pay
the full amount of the Old Age Pensions, and the
full wage promised to the African contingenters,
and the full interest on the public debt, then the
obvious course is to find more revenue. If the
Government hasn’t courage enough for that, and
must break its direct or implied promise either to
the helpless old citizen, or the robust and healthy
contingenter, or to the more or less affluent bond-
holder—well, which one does Turner think best
fitted to stand the shock ?

The Cash Cost of Baubles.
“E. F.” to The Bulletin :
Somebody speaks of the “insulting” character of the
“ Imperial title ” conferred upon brainy Dr. Quick as
though the bauble were a thing that couldn’t be avoided.
Dr. Quick did not get his alleged honor until lie had been
privately consulted on the matter. It cost him a consi-
derable sum in fees—something like £2OO one supposes—
and these fees to the British Govt, and to British sinecure
billet-holders must presumably be paid before Dr. Quick
gets delivery of his star. The willing recipient doesn’t
think himself insulted by it. It is his funeral. If he
chooses to make his own distinction between knights
worthy and unworthy, and elects himself a member of
the higher class, nobody need feel sorry on his account.
Any sort of title is a comparative insult to the very best
men who achieve it, inasmuch as every title except the
title of Pope is borne by disreputable contemporaries.
And all titles, academical or otherwise, are incentives to
grovel, inasmuch as they give the bearer a social stand-
ing which increases his value as a guest at small tea-
parties. Australia, I take it, is less concerned in the
“ awful insult ” of Quick’s new title than in the allotment
of the taxes levied on his pocket. Why should the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth permit its patriots to import their
honors at heavy personal expense when they could
be supplied here at a much lower rate by
special arrangement, of course, with the Colonial Office
in London? This country doesn’t want the right to con-
fer knighthoods on its natives. Let Australian knight-
hoods continue to be regarded as emblems of Imperialism,
incidental to “ silken bondage ” and so forth, so that
every new knight may be a fresh reminder of the system
by which our public men are confirmed in Loyalty. But,
meanwhile, let the absurd English taxes on Australian
knights be either remitted or transferred to the Com-
monwealth Treasury. A monstrous thing, surely, that
the conversion of Dr. Quick into Sir Quick should
involve a capture of many ounces of good, hard, yellow
metal from the distinguished citizen by a far-distant
Power.
♦
A Negative Vote.
The Bulletin has long had an idea that it would
be an interesting experiment in electoral matters
to allow any- voter who felt so inclined to vote
against all candidates. Strict justice certainly
requires that a negative vote should be permitted.
If any section of the community considers that all
the candidates in its electorate are so unsatisfac-
tory that it is better for the district to be unrepre-
sented until some better men can be found—an
interval of, say, two months being allowed in
which to find the better men and hold another
election—they should certainly be allowed to say
so. There are any number of cases where, through
some chance or accident, an electorate may have
no Freetrade candidate, or no Protectionist can-
didate, or no Prohibition or Liberal or Tory can-
didate, though there maybe a reasonably solid body
of Freetraders or Protectionists or Prohibitionists
or Liberals or Tories among the voters. Then
these individuals are given the option of choosing
one out of two or three or four candidates, all
about equally objectionable. Or, if there is only
one candidate, he gets in without anybody choosing
him—he simply chooses himself. By the system
above proposed, there would be no such thing as
a walk-over, and there would be no possibility of
swindling the electors out of their right of choice
by one candidate arranging for the retirement of
his only rival. Even if there was only a solitary
aspirant for the seat, he would have to ask the
electors whether they would take him, or whether
they disliked him so much that they would sooner.
struggle through with no member at all until some
less abhorrent individual presented himself. Such
an arrangement would, at least, prevent any
legislative body sinking into the dreadful condi-
tion of Victoria’s Upper House, where some
members haven’t faced a contested election for 20
years. There would always be at least one
ghostly and impersonal opponent to be reckoned
with in the negative vote —the vote of the people
who would rather be without a member for the
time being than take the person who then presented
himself. And even if the negative vote seldom
made any change in the ultimate result, it would
at least provide certain fat M.’sL.C. with some
much-needed exercise at election time.
A Tasmanian Whoop.
“ Gordelpus ” to The Bulletin :
Premier Lewis, of Tasmania, announces that he pro-
poses to only temporarily hold the office to which he has
been appointed in the Commonwealth Ministry. This
looks as though the ponderous, plain, and somewhat dull
Welsh-Tassie was preparing to do a downright sulk over
the Flvspeck being left out in the un-portfolioed cold. It
is claimed on behalf of Vandemonia that as it was the
best battler for Federation at the polls its political pilots
should have been more honored in the Commonwealth
plum distribution than they have been. Which
is fine cheek. Tassie went bald-headed for
Federation because it hoped to thereby get rid
of its awful incubus of hidebound and incompetent
politicians. There was no other way. And if the estab-
lishment of the Commonwealth was to saddle Tasmania
with the same old incompetents, or any of them, as
rulers, then all the trouble would have been gone through
for nothing. Tasmanians have had too much of the
frying-pan to want to jump into the fire. Just look at
the unhappy island’s recent Governments. They shine
as the willing playthings or subservient tools of the syn-
dicate railway promoters ; they bolster up and shield the
unspeakable Captain Miles until absolutely forced to
take cognisance of his misdeeds; they allow a syn-
dicate to cut them off from access to their own
£50,000 breakwater; they complacently vote £25,000 as
compensation to a few wealthy legislators and others who
invested money in a wildcat railway ; they evict honest
but uninliuential settlers on new mining fields •
they cast out Arbitration Bills and nullify Em-
ployers’ Liability Acts ; they strive to maintain in
their entirety the worst educational Jaw and the most
iniquitous and Tory municipal and national electoral pro-
visions obtaining in any British community ; they allow
the island to be bamboozled by Braddon and degraded
by Dobson unto seventy times seven. And after such a
record, righteous wrath is pretended to because Australia
doesn’t tumble over itself in the hurry to exalt the
commonplace, dreary messers of the Flyspeck ! Let it be
repeated that the great bulk of Tasmanians welcome the
Commonwealth and will be loyal thereto ; but the chiefest
reason for their welcome and loyalty is the heartfelt hope
that the progress of their lovely island will no longer be
barred by the old, hopeless band of unshiftable and petti-
fogging political imbeciles. If Premier Lewis wants to
sulk, let him ! Tasmanians are now citizens of the Com-
monwealth and care not for the bounce of Braddon, the
dragooning of Dobson, or the lamentations of Lewis.
Wherefore wiioop !
*
The Coal Famine.
Common, black coal is now selling in Melbourne
at over £2 a ton, while best steam ditto brings
anything up to 50s. The causes for this are
partly the stoppage of some of the Newcastle
collieries, partly the ditto of the Outtrim (Gipps-
land) mine (the biggest in Victoria), partly the
want of foresight of the Melbourne manufacturers
and partly the result of certain “ arrangements ”
of the Melb. coal-importing ring. Most coal-
contracts stand suspended on Yarra-side, and
many factories have either shortened hands or
stopped work altogether, temporarily. Where-
fore certain plaintive wails of the local Argus are
worth considering, with a view to pointing out to
that misguided journal that the aforesaid coal
scarcity, with its consequent disruption of trade
and loss of profits (and wages), is chiefly the fault
of its beloved Fatman. The “organ of obstruc-
tion and delay ” starts by assuming that the
whole trouble is due to a “ determination
on the part of the Newcastle miners to have
a long holiday,” and darn the consequences;
and it thereupon proceeds to curse those obstre-
perous individuals. The fatuous daily, after
admitting that the miner’s work is monotonous,
depressing and more or less unhealthy, goes on to
observe that, having accumulated a sort of holiday
fund, and relying on the union resources for strike-
pay, the reckless and extravagant coal-cutters
nave gone on a lengthy burst, disorganized trade
generally, shattered their obligations to the mine-
owner and ship-owner, and jumped upon the
immutable law of supply and demand. Then
the ponderous publication wants to know if
there is no remedy for this state of tilings. Over-
looking the unwarrantable assumption that the
miner has any obligations at all to his employers,
who simply employ him so long as they can make
a profit out of him, and sack him directly he gets
old or debilitated or prices fall, The Bulletin
rises to observe that there is a complete,
satisfactory, workable remedy to hand as
soon as Fatman likes to apply it. It has been
demanded in both N.S.W. and Victoria by the
workers for years, but the employer generally—
especially the mine-owner and the ship-owner—
has always scoffed at it and characterised
it as a revolutionary proposal that would
put every employer at the mercy of his “ hands.”
The said Fatman’s representatives in N.S.W.
Leg. Council rejected the proposed remedy oidy
last session, and but for that the Newcastle mine-
owners would not now be at the mercy of their
employes and be compelled to lie idle while coal is
selling in Melbourne at £2 a ton. The remedy
sought is the Compulsory Arbitration Act. Simi-
larly, the big Victorian (Outtrim) mine would not
have been idle the last three months had there
existed any means of compelling the directors to
meet the men in conference, or of judicially arku
trating and enforcing an award. The wearisome
Argus argues that a Compulsory Arbitration
Court is useless because, though its awards could
be enforced against the mine-owners, there is no
means by which contumacious miners could be
brought to book, which indicates a dismal but
characteristic density of intellect on the part of
that alleged teacher of the public. Any
up-to-date Compulsory Arbitration Bill, such
as the one introduced to Vic. Assembly last
session by Best and Trenwith, provides that
union funds may be levied on for the collection of
damages for breach of award and for the material-
ising of fines inflicted for refusal to obey award ;
also, such Act provides for the employment of
unionists in preference to so-called free laborers,
also for the registration of unions and the enforc-
ing of sufficiently heavy subscriptions to create a
fund that can be levied upon by the law. The
organ of Property is apparently too obtuse to
see that Compulsory Arbitration is just as much
to the advantage of employers as of employes, and
that, by perpetually objecting to this and similar
advanced legislation, it only prevents the em-
ployer getting compensation when his business is
injured directly or indirectly by his workers.
Concerning Federal Candidates.
The influence of Habit! Australia is in the cus-
tom of regarding an Upper House as a place re-
served, as a matter of course, for fools, Tories, and
nonentities. So hardly anybody who isn’t a fool,
a Tory or a nonentity can be found to announce
himself as a candidate for the Federal Upper
House. This painful frame of mind will doubtless
wear off, but while it lasts it is as bad as the
opium habit, or the habit of shaking serpents out
of your boots in the morning. The Federal Upper
House, it is true, is no more like any other Upper
House, save in name, than David Jones, the Syd-
ney draper, is like David Jones, the legendary
fiend who sinks ships. Tt is paid, like the
Lower House. It is based on one-man-one-
vote like the Lower House. It is almost
as powerful as the Lower House. Also, it
is a far more honorable place for a really
freat democrat to be in than the Lower
louse, for to be there is to be the man who repre-
sents Queensland, or N.S.W., or Victoria, or
Westralia, or some other whole State, while to be
in the House of Representatives is to be only the
man who represents a little fragment of one of
these States. There is no reason why the Federal
Premier should not be in the Senate —in fact, that
is the place of all others where the Federal Pre-
mier should be. He, more than other men, should
be a man from a whole State, not merely a man
from a speck on the surface of a State —an Aus-
tralian, not a Sydneyite or Melbournian or Cow
Flatter. No doubt things will right themselves
when the people begin to really understand what
their Federal Senate is, but meanwhile it is a
pitiable thing to see the twentieth-rate hangers-on
of politics rising - to claim possession of the most
dignified and most democratically-constituted
Legislative Chamber in Australasia as their
natural home. It is like building a golden palace
and then seeing a fantod taking possession of it.
Who was that Goth of an officer who, when the
Paddington firemen kindly offered cold water to
the hot, thirsty, dusty troops on Commonwealth
Day, badly wounded one of the Good Samaritans
by striking him on the head with his sword ?
Other officers had accepted the water for
themselves and their men, but this brutal mar-
tinet, it seems, regarded drinking in a public
place as an infraction of discipline, and broke
out in the savage manner above described.
Sydney Daily Telegraph report stated that the
fireman was so badly injured that he was re-
moved in an insensible condition. It was
at first alleged that the disgraceful act was done
by an Imperial officer, but that was afterwards
denied. Granting, however, that the awful per-
son was not an Imperial officer, it isn’t who he
wasn’t that this country is interested in; it wants
to know who he is. Nothing has yet been heard
of anybody being arrested for brutal and unpro-
voked assault with a lethal weapon, so it would
seem that Australia is—beginning early to learn to
behave humbly and reverently before its swash-
buckler.
During Commonwealth week there was a tem-
porary recrudescence of Henry Parkes as the
“Father of Federation.” Federation had many
fathers, and Parkes was the most disappointing
of them all. Duffy, the Irish Premier of bygone
days in Victoria, got a Federal Conference almost
under way in ’57, but at the last moment N.S.W.
dropped out. In 1860 lie persuaded Tasmania,
S.A. and Queensland to seriously consider a
Federal scheme, but N.S.W. again dropped out.
Duffy still toiled at his pet idea, and even got an
abortive Federal Conference together in ’63; and
tried to get another together in 1870. Duffy
accomplished nothing—neither did Parkes ; but
he foiled harder at the work of union than any
other man in Australia, save only Barton and
that grand old Caledonian warrior, David
Blair, who helped Parkes to found the
Entire newspaper, and tried hard to make
Hie -tmstable Henry a believer in a United
Australia. Duffy never got a chance to
carry out his great scheme. Parkes got his
chance in ’9l, and when a Federal Constitution
had been drafted by the Conference that he himself
had called together, he deliberately dropped his
own Bill, and put both feet on the Federal move-
ment. If Parkes was the Father of Federation
he was the saddest parent that any great idea
ever had.
♦—
Sydney Telegraph, in a recent article on the
renovation of Sydney, says :
We have miles upon miles of narrow lanes and alleys
running at all kinds of angles to each other, and many of
these are unfit for healthy habitation. . . . Some day
these quarters will have to be pulled down bodily.
Good old some day ! Surely this is as good a day
as any other! The complete resumption by the
State of Sydney and suburbs is the first essential.
The whole place wants to be laid out afresh and
rebuilt on new lines. No mere patching will do
much good ; it isn’t a case of destroying an anti-
quated quarter of the city and rebuilding it to be
in keeping with the rest, for, barring half-a-
dozen or a dozen streets, Sydney has been
simply thrown together. It all looks anti-
quated, and rebuilding bits here and there would
be merely putting new patches on the old clo’.
The reconstruction of Sydney is a work that
would have to be spread over many years, but
there is no reason why it shouldn’t be commenced
at once, and if the O’Sullivan isn’t equal to it
that is so much the more reasofl for getting a
larger and brighter O’Sullivan in his place.
Surely it is possible to find an O’Sullivan who
can think of something greater than a useless
staggery image of Australia Facing the Dawn.
♦
Queen Victoria, Gov.-General Hopetoun, the
Viceroy of India and other potentates have been
exchanging congratulatory cables about the found-
ation of tne Commonwealth, duly published by
the servile dailies for the edification of Australia.
What a solemn farce of marionettes ! Does any-
body imagine that Queen Victoria cares a tooth-
ache about the Commonwealth, except in so far
as it may give greater or less security to the
British monarchy ! All these European royal
families are concerned for one thing only
—to keep themselves at the top of the
tree, with good, obedient numbskulls to
pay their salaries and give them honour.
To that end all the strings are pulled to which the
people dance ; to that end, alliances and wars are
made, and all the mummery of “government”
carried on. Isn’t it time everybody recognised
that monarchy is naturally and necessarily selfish,
root-and-branch ; and will let Justice, Liberty,
and all the other shibboleths go hang as long as
it is maintained in place, with loyal noodles to
kneel before it. Where are the godlike attributes
of monarchy, past or present, that its pro-forma
utterances should be respected like the voice of a
god ?
The newspapers and political hacks who pester
the Federal Premier about appointments and
Commonwealth fixtures generally should hold
fast the fact that a provisional Government can-
not constitutionally do anything except the abso-
lutely unavoidable. The present Ministry must
wait the verdict of the polls before it touches any
of the large appointments. Of course, it must
set machinery going and perform what is necessary
to that end, but it must do nothing to embarrass
What Need?
What need was there to welcome thus our infant
Commonweal
With blare of borrowed trumpets and with flash
of borrowed steel ?
What need was there of warlike pomp to tell the
nations now
In blood the sign baptismal do we write upon her
brow !
What need to tell the nations when they gathered
round to greet—
“We come to rend and raven by your side with
willing feet.”
If this be but the message that the clarions peal
and call
’Twere better—aye, far better —did they never
peal at all.
The bay’net flash from Britain, the sword from
over-sea,
Are these the gentle symbols of the Rule that is to
be ?
What sounds of sorrow drown we with the roll of
yonder drum,
What wailing in the distance would quell and
bid—“ Be dumb ! ”
What need was there to welcome thus our infant
Commonweal
With blare of borrowed trumpets and with flash of
- borrowed steel ?
Why should we call to crown her on a peaceful,
happy shore
The bands that come ensanguined from the ways
of cruel war ?

“ Tannhauser,” staged at Sydney Royal
last Monday for the first time in Australia,
attracted a respectable audience with a strangely
foreign aspect about it in places. There were
unfamiliar accents, and unfamiliar beards, and a
great part of the crowd communicated with itself
in unfamiliar languages, Local Germany was
there in strong force, and a scrap of France, and
the tail-end of Scandinavia. The rest of the
audience enthused over “Tannhauser,” but it did
it none too violently. It tried to look as if it in-
tensely enjoyed the vast, mystic, dreamful Ger-
man opera, but this writer is prepared to swear
that Australia hasn’t the patient, introspective
kind of soul that the occasion requires. German
opera is to a large extent the kind where people
snig about things they have done, or things they
are going to do, or about what will happen
if things are done—but all the same they
don’t do things. The action is mostly left out for
fear it should crowd up the music. “ Tann-
hauser” begins with a lovely mass of scenery, and
many girls singing to a man and woman who lie in
the foreground. When a curtain falls on the girls
the man awakes and sings to the woman, and the
woman sings to the man, and they both sing des-
perately to each other for the rest of the scene.
In the next scene a shepherd sings to the same
man, a herd of pilgrims sing to each other, a num-
ber of knights sing to each other and to the man
aforementioned, and he sings to them, and the
scene ends by most of them singing to each other.
They just stand in the same place, or thereabouts,
all the time and sing. And these people and
many other people relate things in song to each
other all through the opera, which comes to an end
when there is nothing else left on all this earth to
sing about. In an acting sense, what is most re-
quired is an expression of countenance adapted to
the occasion. The bad man isn’t expected to do
anything dreadful, only to look dreadful when he
tells about it.
* * * *
To the people whose souls really yearn
after music, especially the Wagner kind, and who
can take their music by the shovelful, “Tann •
hauser” is a thing of great joy. There are,
apparently, enough of these people in Sydney, or
of people who try to look as if they were these
people, to keep a co. like Musgrove’s going
profitably for a few weeks anyhow. There are
also enough people who aren t these people, and
who don’t profess to be, Out who simply love
colour and scenic effect, to keep it going at least
another week after the people who are the people
above-mentioned have left off and gone home.
And in addition to all the people just described,
and the people who try successfully to look as if
they were them, and the people who try the
same thing unsuccessfully, there is a small
dreamy class which forgets to get its hair
cut, and which would make one or two more audi-
ences for “Tannhauser,” merely by reason of the
opera’s mystical atmosphere and its pleasant feel-
ing of unrealism. And there ought to be one final
audience of people recovering from a long drunk,
for there is something in the music of “Tann-
hauser” which is good for the nerves and the
soul. Louis Arens, with his big voice and his
upward expression, takes most of the glory of
“Tannhauser.” This paper also has a favorable
leaning towards Miss Enriqueta Crichton, but it
hangs the other people up on the hook of doubt,
to be further considered at leisure. As for the
mounting and pictorial effects, they want
good opinion; they are so good that they don’t
require it.

As Her Majesty’s is certainly the most
crowded theatre in Sydney just now The Bulletin
begins to totter a little on the legs of its opinion
about Williamson’s pantomime of “Australis.
If that show is only a dreary production backed
by a mass of beautiful scenery, it is evident that
the public has forgiven the dreariness for the sake
of the scenery. Anyhow, Williamson’s Christmas
spectacle is going well, and its Polar bears and its
Dan O’Connor have evidently got a solid hold upon
the public soul. Curiously enough both the Sydney
pantomimes state that Henry Parkes was the
Father of Federation —which he certainly wasn t.
He was the father of a very large family, but
Federation wasn’t among them. Less fatherly-
looking men, with shorter hair, toiled all their
lives to bring about Federation before Parkes
started to dally with the subject, and to pick it up
in his spare moments, and to drop it again unac-
countably and run after something else. Bub
Parkes’s hair made him look fatherly, it is a
great thing to know when not to get your haircut.

“ When the Lamps are Lighted,” revived
at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday, is a curious mix-
ture of bad melodrama and bright comedy. If
the play consisted to a larger extent of generally-
useful-servant-girl Semolina and her Charley
Scraggs—the pair who retire behind a clothes
soreen, alleged to be Westminster Abbev, and
profess to get married with their heads through
the roof—it would be a cheery kind of play, but
every now and then these and similar characters
are called away to help a darkly-mysterious and
down-trodden person to recover his lost character.
Also they obligingly put on various disguises and
go into situations of grave peril, in order to help
the same gentleman when he loses more character
in his effort to find the remainder. On the stage the
lower class characters are always curiously willing
to help the hero and heroine in all their difficulties
before they have known them five minutes, and
cheerfully give up their billets in order to rescue
anybody’s best girl or daughter from the small
top-room with the side of the wall wide open. The
small boy who makes a home of the stage is a
good item. Most children, when they have
spoken their lines, stand as still as the painted
wave which remains curling over itself all the
scene. Sheridan carries his Irish accent through
six characters in both sexes ; and a small number
of rather uninteresting men are drearily the same

Miss Isa Millet does a personation of a tiresome
girl who drops her head on her chest when any
allusion is made to her marriage. Stage conven-
tion is invariably two generations behind the
times. The nice girl of the century before last is
the rather imbecile girl of this one.

“When the Lamps are Lighted " is booked

The messenger from Mars, who came all
the way to the Palace Theatre, Sydney, to con-
vert Horace Parker, is now in his fourth week,
and appears likely to pursue the conversion of
Parker for a week or two longer. It is to be
hoped he will do so, for there is nothing like
making dead-sure that Parker is thoroughly
converted before he leaves off. Parker,
who is a painfully selfish animal in the
first act, is so much improved by A.ct 111.
that the end of the play finds him filling his draw-
ing-room with cripples, dead-beats, miscellaneous
tramps, and children that have fallen out of top-
windows, and supplying them with consolation
and hot soup. And if the quaint and pretty
drama lasts another fortnight, there are hopes
that Parker’s reform will be permanent, and that
he can then be relied upon to shout hot soup for
the homeless all the rest of his life.
“Monte Christo ” still proceeds at Sydney
Criterion, and opinion in general is favourable to
the public throwing of the sacked hero into the
sea. The play goes rather thinly in the latter
acts, and the fact that the hero takes so long to
enlighten Merceries as to his identity casts
an unfavourable light upon his character. Also
the illogical Dantes never seems to remem-
ber that he owes a debt of gratitude to his
enemies, because if they had not cast him
into prison he would not have had the mil-
lions which are the source of his jewellery, and
his large boiled shirt-front, and his other
greatness. It is, in fact, the case of Joseph up to
date, but the logical Hebrew forgave his brethren
on the ground that their wickedness had made
him Viceroy of Egypt, whereas if they had been
good men he would probably have remained to the
day of his death a ragged Jew running after a
cow with a stick in his hand on the borders of
Philistia. The illogical Frenchman doesn’t see
this, so he goes after his unconscious benefactors
with Scriptural quotations and a gun. He will
continue doing this till Friday night. “His
Natural Life ” revives on Saturday.

The rather shapeless stage cat and the
other properties of “ Puss in Boots ” whirl along
in their wonted fashion at Sydney Tivoli. One
feature which strikes even a casual observer is a
painful attempt at pandering to a non-Australian
sentiment, which, though certainly not dead, is
much deader than it was. The cat, a most re-
spectable animal, draws little coloured pictures of
eminent persons from a portfolio, which he finds
on a kind of sofa in the open air at the top of a
hill, and holds them up in his honourable claw,
while Billie Barlow sings not very appropriate
and rather dull songs. And there isn’t one Aus-
tralian in the collection. Roberts and Chamber-
lain are there, but even Barton, prominent as he
is, is too common and local to have a show —at
least he didn’t have a show on the night when the
present writer looked at the cat and the Tivoli
bag of pictures. “ Puss in Boots ” is an opera of
the old-time variety—the kind which invariably
includes a man in petticoats with a red nose and a
small, tight wisp of hay-coloured hair at the
back of his head. Harry Diver’s devil is the most
interesting character in it. Miss Noni Rickards
would be more interesting than she is if her weak
little voice was more audible in the remote parts of
the theatre. ‘ ‘ Puss in Boots ”is strong in the local
element, and the programme states that this part
of the show was supplied by Pat Finn and J. A.
Phips. The latter, The Bulletin believes, is
that clever and well-known pressman, J. A.
Philp, now of Brisbane, and why the programme
leaves him out and puts in Phips is a mystery.
The same programme alludes in another place to
Mr. Ernest Brinkman as “Mr. Drinkman,” which
is rough, being calculated to raise an utterly
erroneous impression that he belongs to the
Borndrunk family.

Fitzgerald’s Circus finishes its Sydney
season on Saturday, so whoever desires to have a
final look at a most interesting and at times thrill-
ing show is hereby urged to get into the electric
tram with all speed and hie him to the scene of
action. A large new programme has been put on
with a view to closing the season with an ext a
bl ize of glory.
The Bulletin has received at the instance
of Miss Billie Barlow, now engaged at Sydney
Tivoli Theatre in a leading rdle, a bit of blue paper
with respect to an offence supposed to be contained
in this paper’s criticism of the lady’s performance.
The Bulletin can only express its regret that
offence should be taken where it was certainly not
intended ; and if its description of Miss Barlow’s
Eerformance as a matter of public interest has
urt Miss Barlow’s feelings, then The Bulletin,
which would not willingly hurt any lady’s feel-
ings, is sincerely sorry.

“ Histrion ” makes out a strong-looking
case:—
Dear Bulletin. —Your issue of 12/1/*1 states that the
free matinees at the Sydney theatres on 4th inst. were a
complete success. So they were—for many who got in
“on the nod,” and who could very well have paid. I did
not see any obviously-poor people present. If the “ well-
dressed women were the guardians of children boarded-
out by the State,” then there were more guardians than
children. Women in stylish costumes, with white kid
gloves, fans, and smelling-bottles don’t fit in well with
a free entertainment for the “ poor.” But as the fre-
quently really poor mummer is always being “ done-in”
on matinees, anyway, perhaps one more or less doesn’t
matter. It has within late years become customary for
managers to squeeze seven or eight shows weekly out of
their companies for a six-show wage. Matinees used to
be paid for at half-salary rates, but some of the very
bosses who are credited with being “ props of the pro-
fession ” have “ changed all that ” ; because the average
“pro.” is about as helpless, where his interests are con-
cerned, as a blind kitten. It is only fair to add that a
few managers either don’t give matinees at all, or pay for
them decently.
“Floradora,” at Her Majesty's, was going
stronger last week than it went the week before
Xmas, owing to the return of many Common-
wealth pilgrims from Sydney, and because its
reputation spreads like the sheltering palms in
Brownlow’s ballad. Lord Brownlow, of Navarre,
got a touch of the croup last week, and was forced
to keep one of his ballads locked in his manly
chest, whilst Kenningham utterly succumbed to
the weather and left his place to be filled by
Ernest Mozar. Probably the illness was a judg-
ment on Kenningham for his patriotic song, where-
in he alleges that it is better to “ fight for Queen
and Country and the rest of it ” than to get any
“paltry pay” for your trouble. The meaning
of “ the rest of it ” is not explained, but no doubt
the improvident hero refers to the copper medal
and a daring girl that eventually falls to a sur-
vivor. All the same, every right-thinking person
must resent the insult which Kenningham offers
to cash. The Queen’s head upon a coin of the
realm is a blessed property. In sufficiently large
quantities it will buy more girl and glory than any
soldier can acquire by charging the enemy free of
cost. The delightful double sestet with cake-walk
effects continues to strike sparks of joy from pre-
sent scribe’s flinty heart. Six pretty creatures
on bended knee before their dapper clerks
are an inspiring sight for one who has never yet
had more than one creature on a bended knee at a
time, and then it was his own knee. Also, Lauri
and Carrie Moore have devised a vastly humorous
burlesque of the Dartos, introducing two different
Carries, equally fetching in their ways. And the
Carrie on is one joke with the Carrie off when it
cometh to be carried out. Therefore there are
three carries, not two carries—carry one, carry
two and Carrie Moore. And whosoever believeth
not this will be saved.

Melbourne’s temperature suffered some
startling vicissitudes last week, but a drop of 40
deg., more or less, made no difference to Cin-
derella’s wedding-procession. The Heralds of
Love who blow the silent trumpets, and the
bridesmaids, and all the other girls dressed in
brief magnificence came marching to the fore as
usual, without any apparent fear of taking cold
in their last extremities. Also, Prince Nellie
faced the music in her regulation marriage gar-
ment, which is a highly ventilated steel shirt,
showing more ventilation than steel. There are
warm nights when this vision of a pink flesh-
colored Nellie looks seasonable. In hailstormy
weather one thinks of how the wind will whistle
through the bridegroom’s little bit of sanitary
clothing as he sprints up the steps of the Chapel
Royal to get “turned off,” and then the mind
pictures a linseed-poultice honeymoon, and a
widowed Cinderella whose grief will have a crim-
son lining, like Lottie Collins’s.
The Christmas Shows of Melbourne
Proceed upon their way ;
They peg along with dance and song,
Or melodrama, hot and strong.
The mumming world is gay.
But we who do the par critique
Grow hollow-eyed and pale of cheek
The while we diligently seek
For something new to say.
Ten thousand sorts of toiling
Are practised day by day :
The blacksmith sweats, the bookie bets,
The merchant works at making debts
Which others work to pay,
Till stretched upon their beds of pain,
They close their eyes, nor wake again.
Our duty is to rack our brain
For something new to say.
Lord of the Christmas seasons
That come and pass away,
Look down on us who struggle thus
In cheerful manner to discuss
The oft-repeated play.
A happy thought, O Lord, suggest
An epigram, an airy jest.
When themes grow old, may we be bless’t
With something new to say.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
“T.A.”: (1) Balance-sheet of co. mentioned
was published in August. It did not appear in Bulletin,
but it was criticised in “ Wild Cat ” column Ist Septem-
ber, 1900. (2) Premium income quoted of Temperance
and General for 1899 is quite correct. Bulletin figures
showed premium income of Ordinary Department sepa-
rately, but in Industrial Department it only showed total
income (premiums and interest). Figures you send are
premiums of both departments—interest not included.

The earnings are nominally at the rate of £7 4s. 6d. per
cent, per annum on the shareholders’ total funds as at the
beginning of the half year (capital £lOO,OOO ; reserves
£8154). For the previous half-year the earnings were
nominally £6 10s. 6d. per cent, on shareholders’ funds,
so on the surface of things there is a very material im-
provement. As a matter of strict accuracy, however, the
earnings for the half-year to 31st December, 1900, were
only £2368, while those for the previous half-year (to 30th
June, 1900) were £2556, the remainder of the apparent
profits being recoveries from debts previously written off
as bad. When an institution writes off a great mass of
bad and doubtful debts out of capital it invariably
happens that some of them prove recoverable and there is
generally an immediate increase in apparent profits from
this source. In reality, of course, this extra revenue isn’t
profit but capital. The actual earnings of the Bank of
North Queensland are rather less than they were for
previous half-year—another effect, doubtless, of the great
drought-slump which has fallen on Queensland, and
which may yet fall more heavily for all the unfortunate
State knows to the contrary.
Still the actual earnings (£2368) are equal to
£4 7s. 7d. per cent, per annum on shareholders’ funds,
which is a respectable rate, as respectable rates go at pre-
sent. The deposits have increased during the half-year,
and the coin and Government notes on hand (£131,894)
are equal to over 39 per cent, on all liabilities to the
public. This is not taking any account of State securities,
and it is a very strong cash reserve—in fact, it looks need
lessly strong. If a further £20,000 were invested in State
securities it would add considerably to the interest re-
ceipts, without making the institution any less secure.

The improvement of the previous half-year
hasn’t been fully maintained, still the Trustees, Executors
and Agency Co. has made considerable addition to its
reserves. These consist of reserve fund £5OOO, and un-
divided profit £3313. The reserves have increased
considerably since December, 1898, but they are still so
widely different from the £112,961 of June, 1893, that
there is need to keep the dividend rigidly down to 5 per
cent, for a good many years to come in order to put
things on their old footing. The only feature about the
assets to which it is possible to take any exception is that
certain shares and deposits in the Australian Deposit and
Mortgage Bank are valued at £lB,BOO, whereas the market
price at time of writing is about £15,800. The co. values
the shares below' present selling price, but it values the
deposits considerably above it. As the deposits will
almost certainly be paid in full this doesn’t matter much,
still when the Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. wrote
up its A. D. and M. Bank shares six months ago—which
was quite a justifiable act—it would have done better to
use the £l4OO to write down its holding of deposits in the
same institution.

Since the start of the Broken Hill Proprietary’s
new 5000-ton mill, most of the Barrier mines have been
engaged in remodelling their concentrating plants on up-
to-date lines, and wisely show a preference for machines
which have proved most successful on the difficult fines
and slimes. The machines that can claim this distinction
are the “Luhrig” Vanners, as supplied by Messrs. W. &
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne. The South’s new mill will
include a dozen or so, and the Junction Co. has also de-
cided to erect a number of Luhrig Vanners as an impor-
tant adjunct to its large plant. Other mines would do
well to follow this good example.*

Ed. Bulletin,—Your mention (12/1/’01) of
gold-poachers on Russian territory, recalls the incident
of a party of prospectors (British and Yank) who, reach-
ing the Siberian coast, proceeded to “work” the Lena
River placers, and were doing well for a week or two
(some had collected 50oz. gold) when an emissary of the
Czar happened along, in force, and, after a disgorging
process, advised them to float. They floated, first wind.
The richness of the Siberian alluvial deposits has long
been known to mining adventurers, but it is also known,
worse luck, that the party which attempts to exploit them
(be he British or otherwise) under free conditions, gets
booted out, on a drop-kick—for the Bear is infernally
big and awkward. A “ monkey-weight ” of Uncle Paul’s
calibre would have to issue miner’s rights and “voting
papers ” on demand, or we should turn Kipling, “ Bobs,”
and the Bush Brigade loose on to him.—F.S.M.

This is the first year since the reconstruction when the
N.Z. L. and M. has contrived to pay its debenture in-
terest in full, and in addition to this it has a very good
balance over. If the debentures (about £1,500,000 worth)
nominally written off in 1897 (when about £1,000,000 of
capital was also wiped out) had been fully and finally ex-
tinguished, and it vvas certain that no further losses re-
mained to be provided for, the profit would be a hand-
some one, equal to over 38 per cent, on the very much
written - down capital of £136,215. Unfortunately
£1,000,000 of these allegedly written-off debenture claims
were kept alive, and still have a call on the profits. Fur-
thermore the affairs of the New Zealand Land Association
(an off-slioot of the Loan and Mercantile, which was taken
over bodily by the parent co. in 1897) are not yet fully
settled up, so the Loan and Mercantile really doesn’t
quite know where it is. What is definitely known is that
the profits have greatly increased, that the debenture in-
terest for the past year has been met in full, and that
there is a profit of £51,986 for the year. But there is an
impossible sum due to the trustees of the debenture-
holders whose debentures were nominally written off
in 1897, they having a claim for £40,000 in dividends when
the profits admit, and 60 per cent, of any additional pro-
fits ; so there is really no visible hope for the old share-
holders under present arrangements. The chairman
frankly admits that it costs about £4 a share to persuade
any responsible person to take over the Loan and Mer-
cantile's shares, and that as the heirs of the late lamented
will seldom accept transfer of them the Loan and Mercan-
tile’s shareholders are now very largely dead men—“ the
estate of the late John Smith,” and such like. If the
trustees who represent the nominally-written-off deben-
ture-holders would accept something in the £ and cancel
their claims for good, the Loan and Mercantile might
become a live concern again. As things are, these
individuals are always lying in wait to take the surplus
profits, when there are any, and the shareholders have
really no interest in the business.
On paper the N.Z. Loan and Mercantile has
now about £189,000 of paid-up capital and reserves, and
it owes £3,311,000 on existing debentures, and about
£500,000 otherwise, so that it is working almost wholly
on borrowed money. If a large amount of new capital
could be called up it might pay off a lot of its debentures
and earn good profits again. But while the repre-
sentatives of £1,000,000 worth of debentures that were
lost and nominally written off in ’97 have a claim for
£40,000 a year as soon as the profits are available, and for
60 per cent, of any remaining profits over and above the
£40,000 a year, no shareholder really cares much whether
the institution makes profits or not. He would get
practically none of the profits in any case. And for the
same reason the average shareholder won’t pay calls.

Queensland Meat Export and Agency Co.,

year have been as follows :

Reserves shown above consist of reserve fund, £105,000
and £27,348 undivided profit. In addition there is a re-
serve of £19,954 for renewal and replacement of
machinery. Altogether the Queensland Meat Export and
Agency 00. has had two remarkably good years, and its
reserves are now considerably larger than its capital.
Profits for the last two years have been at the rate of a
shade over 50 per cent, per annum.
« * * *
The proposed further reconstruction of Golds-
brough Mort and 00. is based on the idea of writing off
the whole of the ordinary share capital (£233,608); 10s.
per share (£159,713) of the preference capital, and 40 per
cent. (£493,740) of the B debentures. This will make
another £887,061 gone into the bottomless gulf of depre-
ciation. But though this may do a great deal to bring
the assets down to their real value, it makes
no difference at all in the revenue account.
Neither preference nor ordinary shares receive any
dividend, and the interest on the B debentures is only
payable when profits are available. Profits not having
been available they have received no interest for some
years. Therefore if all the capital and all the B deben-
tures had been written off three years ago the outgoings
would have been exactly the same. Possibly, as things
have been improving of late, the management reckons
that it sees its way to pay interest regularly in future on
the balance of the B debentures.

tion to the fact that under its “ profit-sharing policy ”
with “select rates” it supplies the said insurance for
£27 14s. 2d. The Bulletin can only say in reply that it
tried to go in each case on the ordinary, whole-life
with-profit table, and by table 1 of the Citizens’ book of
rates the charge is £2B 17s. 6d. The said book describes
this table as the simplest and cheapest , and says that
“for a given sum per annum it affords the 'largest
immediate insurance,” so it seemed a fair thing to judge
the office by this table. If there is another which gives a
still larger assurance for the money the above remarks are
confusing. They confused this influential paper, anyhow,
and it objects to being confused.

The Tasmanian Loan, Guarantee and Finance
Co. (Hobart, Tas.) is a little concern with a paid-up
capital of £15,000, and engaged in the mortgage and
general finance business. Its last four reports have
shown as follows :
Profits Dividends and Total
Dividend Tax. Reserves.
September, 1898 £2572
March, 1899 .. £342 4 per cent. =£3ls .. 2599
September, 1899 349 ~ = 315 .. 2633
March, 1900 .. 351 ~ = 315 ~ 2669
September, 1900 344 „ = 315 .. 2698
The reserves consist of depreciation fund, £2600, and un-
divided profit, £9B. The Co. was managed last half-year
at a total expense of £7B, so even the gross earnings were
only £422, equal to £5 12s. 6d per cent, per annum on
capital. This is a rather humble figure to earn in the
mortgage and finance business, and it seems to suggest
that the assets have depreciated a little, and that the
depreciation fund of £2600 is a wise precaution.

During December, Broken Hill drew from the
B.H. Water Co.’s reservoir just under 25 million gallons.
This reduced the depth of water by 3£in. But in the
same period evaporation reduced it bv Ift. 1 jin. ! The
depth of water at the beginning of January was 14ft. ;
but, as the area of exposed surface is reduced, so is the’
evaporation reduced, which permits the co. to still
estimate that it has alO months’ supply. A persistent
rumor that notice had been given to the'mining co.’s to
reduce their drafts on the supply had no bottom in it.
• * « »
According to the calculations of the Govt,
hvdrographer, there were 364.000,000 gallons of water in
the B.H. reservoir at the beginning of December. From
then to the middle of Jan. the consumption was about
37,000,000 gallons, while the loss by evaporation is
reckoned at upwards of 80 millions. “ A local estimate
gives between five and six months’ supply, making liberal
allowances for silting and evaporation losses.

The Central (Sulphide Corporation) is inaugur-
ating a zinc plant, magnetic, to be run bv the Metternich
Co.—German, of course. And Block 10 is putting up a
plant, designed by General-Manager Warren, for the con-
tinuation of the concentrating process.
• * * *
During 1900, Broken Hill exported £2,281,227
worth of metal. This is the value on the spot; thus,
mill-products which, after an expensive process or series
of processes, may yield £7 worth of metal per ton, are in
some cases estimated to be worth at the mines no more
than 10s. per ton. The figures for ’99 were £1,687,786 ;
the year’s increase was £593,441. Very much of this was
due to the better metal-prices. Still, the gradual fall in
zinc-value prevented the expected advance in zinc-treat-
ment; of “zincs,” in fact, £38,611 were exported as against
£40,916 in ’99. Concentrates —the ordinary mill-product
—show most increase, from £1,220,171 to £1,754,722. Of
crude ore (mostly sent to the B.H. Prop, furnaces), the
total exported was £349,363 ; and of bullion nil.

Silver Coinage: Notified in the N.S.W. Govt,
Gazette that the rate to be paid for silver in any form of
bullion from Ist Jan. has been fixed at 2s. 3d. per oz. fine.
The mint gets ss. an oz. for it, and for some reason or
other there has been an enormous demand for silver coin
during the last month or six weeks. Coining silver at a
profit of 2s. 9d. per oz. is good business in which private
enterprise would like to take a hand if allowed. No
doubt it is taking a hand ; there is in circulation plenty
English silver coined in Germany.

Sulphide Corporation : Last meeting in London
disclosed a magnificent balance-sheet—credit balance
from profit and loss account, £196,921, and after charging
£13,918 as depreciation and £5OOO for interest on deben-
tures, left a nett profit of £178,003, which, with £18,904
brought forward, makes £196,907. Two divs. of 7£ per
cent each (total over £144,000) declared during the year,
leaving £52,532 to carry forward. Manager reported that
he had over 16 years’ ore in sight, at present smelting
rate. Why the shares should be at less than par under all
these magnificent circumstances is extraordinary, but
that there is some reason for it, not clear in the financial
statement, there can be no doubt.

The Macquarie No. 1 dredge last week made
the N.S.W. record up to date, by catching 951-oz. gold in
110 hours—2ooz. better than the previous best week’s
work by any dredge in the State. Araluen Valley Con-
solidated also had a fine yield —-530 z. for 133 hours. Turon
No. 1 started late, and did not clean up ; Turon No. 2
washed up for 16oz. only.

Stated that Cobar Gold Mines, which is now
putting up German filter-presses to treat slimes, of which
it has accumulated many thousands of tons, has during
1900 treated 6000 tons dirt monthly for a yield of from
1400 oz. to 1600 oz. The mi 1 has put through 72,000 tons
in 12 months. Dividends from this big show, which, under
Mr. Buckland's direction, has become the model low-grade
gold-mine, should now soon be forthcoming.

Some 1800 men were off at Mount Morgan mine
since the 24th December “ till rain came,” and it has
fortunately come to such an extent as to give
work to all employes. Curious fact that the
Xmas of 1899 saw every dam the co. possesses filled
to overflowing, including the 222-million-gallon reservoir
they had just built. This latter, however, was allowed
to run away, in the joyful belief that rain was going to
drop in hunks. It emptied in a week, and has been
empty ever since.
* * * *
Gympie (Q.) figures for 190091,9330 z. from
117,685 tons ; calls, £109,713 ; divs., £102,632. In ’99 the
field gave 89,8320 z from 99,984 tons; calls, £123,003;
divs., £92,917. Both output and divs. have again been
irregular. The best payers were Scottish Gympie,
£33,000, and the G.E. 2 South, £32,942 ; the rest no-
where. Same with output. These two also led in ’99.

Why not dredge the other fellow ! Australia is
not taking any of its own just now, but the Argentine is
a glorious—an ideal dredging country! What beautiful
golden dredging concessions the Trans-Pacific Investment
Syndicate (Herberton, N. Queensland) has secured 1
One of these consists of 32 English miles of river-bed,
gold-bearing from end to end, and returns (by primitive
appliances) sgrs. to loz. per load ! ! Of course when
modern machinery gets to work they’ll need an English
fleet of war-vessels for the protection of their monthly
golden convoys down the Paraguay River from the pirati-
cal half-breeds, who will naturally kick against the whole-
sale disappearance of the yellow metal from which, from
tinie immemorial, they have fashioned their cooking-pots
and implements of warfare —vide Rougemont. And the
report says that the whole of this extraordinarilv rich
scheme will be given to the public ! Good old public !
How green are these distant fields !

The Queensland gold output for 1889 was
946,8940 z. ; for 1900—951,0650 z., an increase of over
40000 z., made up of gold and cyanide bullion, counted
without distinction. Nearly all the leading fields except
Charters Towers show an increase on the previous year,
nut the Towers decreases by about 59,6000 z. None the
less the same big town heads the list as usual, coming first
with an output of 452,0210 z., of which 214,1160 z. came
from 206,247 tons, while 515,206 tons of tailings gave
23/,2350z. Divs. amounted to £298,209, plus £65,000 due
to cyanide The calls were the lowest for years, totalling
about £5OOO. The largest dividend - payer was
the Brilliant and St. George United, which
gave its proprietors £88,200 for the year. Mt.
Morgan, of course, came second, yielding 201,6490 z.
from 235,300 tons, or 18,000 oz. over the yield for 1899.
Gympie’s output for ’99 was 89,7720 z. ; for 1900, 91,9330 z!
Increase of £8715 in dividends and a reduction of £l3 200
m calls. Croydon, in spite of the drought, produced
some 95,0000 z. gold and cyanide bullion, crushing 27 800
tons for 64,5000 z. and cyaniding 27,000 tons for 31,0000 z.
Divs., £145,000; calls, £15,000. Ravenswood showed a
big increase, jumping from 25,G970z. in 1899 to 31,4860 z.
for 1900 chiefly due to the Donnybrook properties.
Associated Gold Mines : Dec. production, 3053
tons 25690 z. A little better than the average for the
last 12 months, although probably no profit in it.
Developments during last quarter have been more impor-
tant than during the previous one, and in the face of
them the market has depreciated to the extent of three-
quarters of a million ! A few months ago shares reached
83s. per force of development. So nianv “ bears ” rushed
to cover and so many “ bulls ” to buy that the mine got a
market inflation of over £2,000,000. Since then some
good developments have taken place—and the mine has a
market value of a little over a million and a quarter 1
Only one more evidence of the artificial character of the
W.A. market.
* * * *
Croesus South United, 1750 tons 501 oz. All
oxidised ore it would need to be. Located immediately
north of Hannan’s Brownhill, having on its north Block
45, and on the east one of the Associated Northern blocks
An English co. erected a heavy 20-head mill which started
to crush some months ago with this result. Before
crushing started, shares were 255. in London, they are
probably under 15s. now, and if the mill can’t make a
better average than this they would be dear at 5s
“ Always sell before the crushing,” held good in this case
as it does in ninety-nine out of a hundred.

Tindall’s, Coolgardie, 1500 tons, 270 oz.—and it
is said to pay. If so, how lying the vabber that big
bodies of ore at Ooolgardie can’t be worked Do pay because
they are not worth more than lOdwts. per ton. This
return represents an average of 3|dwts.
* * * *
Kalgurli : 1007 tons—l47sozs. Mill only ran
three weeks because of an accident. The mine has
averaged say Hoz. since it started about nine months
ago, and as there has been no div. in that time two
things are established-that the mine must have been
very heavily indebted before the start and that the
treatment costs are higher than expected, for the
Kalgurli had at grass some thousand tons of ore to start
with. Four months ago, when the capacity of the mill
and the average yield were the same, shares reached £6
15s. They are now under £4 and more likely to fall than
rise.
Ivanhoe: 6458 tons, 83910z5., made up of
oxidised ores, a small percentage of sulphide, and a large
quantity of tailings and slimes cyanided and pressed ; but
like the rest of the mines within the Golden Mile and
throughout W.A. the shares are falling.
* * * *
Perseverance : Total gold production for Dec.,
5801ozs. Made up of 1850 tons of oxidised ores with
sands and slimes, making the average about lOdwts.
6000 tons of sulphides crushed, roasted, amalgamated and
cyanided. Announced that the Lake View lode has been
struck in the Perseverance in the 700 ft. level, that it is
over 12ft. wide, very rich in places and poor in others.
It would be of more interest to know how the great mis-
take has been made of getting an average of less than an
oz. from the sulphide zone, when the price of shares and
everything else were calculated on an ounce-and-a-half
basis. Shares have been as high as £l7, then down to
£l5, then to £l2, up and down between £9 and £l2 for
six months, and they are now down to £7. Understood
that mine is over £lOO,OOO in debt, which will take time
to wipe off at this rate of profit and production.
Golden Bar, Coolgardie: 920 tons tailings for
102£0z., worth £3 9s. per oz. Also crushed for the public
218 tons for a revenue of £196. The great expectations of
the Golden Bar have ended in a tailings-dump and crush-
ing other mines’ ore. Probably none left in the mine or
it would have been gouged out long ago. The G.B. has
everything to make a mine, bar gold.
* * * *
Great JFingall (once known as the Day Dawn),
W.A.: 1974 tons—3o26ozs. The usual average, slightly
over lloz. Edward Hooper, a very able and straight
YV.A. mining man, said of this mine recently that it fur-
nished one of the surprises of W.A., that it was impossible
to see it without enthusing over it, that he had not the
slightest hesitation in saying that it was far and away the
biggest proposition in IVestralia—which is a very large
order indeed. The ore-shoot, at one time supposed to
have almost disappeared, was open for a tremendous
length and developed to a considerable depth ; already
there was enough ore in sight to keep the present head
running for years, and he recommended the management
to duplicate the crushing capacity without delay. Yet
the shares have fallen £l—presumably in sympathy with
the Westralian general slump.

Lake View Consols: Cabled last week that
Whitaker Wright, managing director of the London and
Globe Finance Corporation, explained to the share-
holders that in order to obtain control of Lake Views he
negotiated a loan of half-a-million to the end of March,
giving as security 40,000 Lake Views and other scrip.
The lenders sold the security in the open market on the
same and following days, and he personally advanced
£250,000 to avert a crisis. Wright added that the
directors had practically arranged with the co.’s credi-
tors, whom they hoped to pay in full. The meeting
adjourned till this week, when a reconstruction scheme
will be submitted. Though not quite clear, the inference
is that Wright used up the half-million and his own
quarter-million, and the co. has lost 40,000 shares.
Previous week it was cabled that Wright had
failed to negotiate a loan, hence the collapse.
Probably another loan was referred to. The end,
of course, was inevitable, and the more money Wright
used the greater would have been the collapse. Lake
Views fell from over £l5 to under £8 in a day. Had Wright
put them to £2O as he threatened they would have come
down to the same £8 —with the result that the “ bears ”
would have made more money and the “bulls” lost
more. Sunday’s cable says the Stock Exchange losses,
arising out of the fierce gamble in Lake Views, exceeded
anticipations. One firm’s differences amounted to over a
million, and another’s to about half a million. No doubt
a number of the “ bears ” will now find that “ you can’t
get blood out of a stone.” To run the risk of a “bear”
in Lake Views, and then not to get paid when the ac-'
count shows a profit of £8 a share is equivalent to back-
ing “ Clean Sweep ” in the Cup with a welcher.

Golden Horseshoe : 8,534 tons— ls,2Booz. The
G.II. is the boss producer of the Golden Mile. It has also
the highest market-valuation in London, although it has
fallen to the extent of over a million within the last few
months ; but it has such an extraordinary corporation
owning and running the mine that a drop of a million is
neither here nor there. Long before the 15,0000 z.
monthly production was the order of the day, Horseshoes
were over £l4, and now that it has been established they
are down to £9—a fall of If millions 1 The shares are so
closely held and manipulated that the “ bears ” have kept
off them.
* * * »
Great Boulder : Gold product last month
12,2200 z., a considerable advance on the average of last
year. Two diamond drill bores recently pierced the main
lode at 1200 ft-., bores being 100 ft. apart, each proving the
existence of a quartz lode lift, thick. First bore gave an
average of 12dwt., the second showed 22dwt. A bore is
now going down to prove the thickness and value of lode
at 1300 ft. Mine free from debt, paid two divs. within the
last few months, has large tonnage of sulphide ore at
grass, many years’ work established in the mine, is the
deepest on the field by a long way, the best developed
and opened, and beyond the shadow of a doubt all round
the best mine. Yet the shares are lower to-day than
they have been for years. Some people still think they
are high enough as a mining investment: if so, most of
the others are still too high, great as has been the fall of
the last two weeks.

At last they have fixed up the jarrah-combine
in London, following the Millar co.’s proposals in the
main.

It was stated in London lately that the Aus-
tralian Gold Recovery Co., the owner of the cyanide
patents, had issued writs against one or two of the smaller
co’s. So far, the Brown Hill appears to be the only big
co. to arrange with the Recovery Co. ; the others show
their teeth. On a 5 per cent, royalty—the amount levied
in Vic. in the old days, as well as in the Rand—the Great
Boulder, L.V. Consols, Perseverance, Horseshoe, and
Ivanhoe would owe between £40,000 and £45,000. No
wonder the teeth show !

“ J.C.,” in a letter to this column, gave the
gilded pill to the Crotty-Lonergan-Madden crowd, and
put outside everything that is good in connection with
the mine and management. He omits all that is bad, and
predicts that their good work will end in the North
.people taking in the parent mine with Sticht as general
boss. He has overlooked one important thing. Before
the North was heard of as a mine the Mt.
Lyell general scheme was conceived, and it has been
carried out almost without any departure. If there
is one, probably it is the omission of a haulage tunnel
from smelters to mine, which was truly a sad error. But
everything else has gone straight ahead and there is no
other case in Australia, possibly not one in the whole
world, where a mining scheme of such magnitude has
been carried so close to the original plan. In other cases
enormous changes are made and the plant of the start is
in oblivion five years afterwards. How many changes have
the N. Lyell crowd made? They have spent nearly as
much money as Mt. Lyell, and yet can’t smelt a ton of
ore, and probably this year will expire before they are
able to do so. They have had smelted many thousands of
tons at Mt. Lyell, the copper contents of which
have probably averaged four times that from
the parent mine ; they have shipped thousands of tons
of copper ore, ten times as rich as Mt. Lyell ore, and what
has become of all the money? Gone in expenses, mis-
management and general extravagance, instead of in
divs., as would undoubtedly have been the case had the
amalgamation taken place when it was first suggested
years ago. Mt. Lyell is a monument of good manage-
ment from the start • North Mt. Lyell is a monument°of
bad management.

Mt. Lyell: Melbourne market alarmed because
the smelters have only been taking 420 tons a week from
South Tharsis mine. The impression prevailed that the
ore had proved a failure for fluxing purposes. The reply
is that the maximum that can at present be carried on
the aerial tram is 80 tons a day, and it is on account of
that and not because of the character of the ore that the
ordinary silica-flux quarries have had to be worked to
supply the difference. Good bornite ore struck in No. 7
level last week, and the winze going down from No. 6
proves a good body of ore for a depth of 60ft. General
average continues low and is likely to remain so ; shares
still in the immediate vicinity of £6.
* * * *
The other day Quartz-King Lansell got a nasty
bump. For some time he has been getting highly-payable
returns from Concord mine, situated on the south end of
the famous New Chum line. Of course he is not com-
pelled to divulge the returns to the public, but sufficient
has filtered out through the workmen to indicate that
the dirt is worth about lioz. per ton. The King holds a
big stretch of ground, and a couple of miners asked him
for a tribute, but, sustaining his hard-fisted policy, he
refused them, at the same time starting a couple
of new shafts to catch the continuation of the reef.
One of the miners struck an idea, and journeyed into
the Warden’s Court, where he found that Lansell had no
claim to most of the ground which he (the miner) wanted,
and was simply playing a game of bluff. He at once
pegged out all the ground which had not been enveloped
by the Quartz King and applied for a lease. It was a
sight never to be forgotten when Lansell found that
nearly 700yds on the line of reef did not belong to him
and that miners of yesterday were the proud possessors
of a wealthy strip of ground which can be easily floated,
even in Bendigo’s sluggard market. How the’old man
did bless those whom he considered should have known
that the lease was peggable 1

It takes a year or two for a rise in the copper
market to show its full effects on the production of the
metal. In 1899, when there was a rise of £2O a ton, deliveries
in Europe were actually about 2000 tons less than in the
preceding year—232,704 as against 234,951 tons. But in
1900, with the top prices for 1899 only just about main-
tained, European deliveries run up to 274,334 tons.
American production during the first nine months of the
year was 200,042 tons against 191,321 in the correspond-
ing part of 1899. But the increase of output is not being
maintained, while the market is still buoyant. Alto-
gether, in fact, the copper-producer’s outlook continues
a bit better than fair.
* * * *
As to tin, increased export from the Straits is
probable ; and, though the market is not weak, the
future is very uncertain.

Apropos the hideous waste of N.S.W.
Govt, money on the great Commonwealth drunk,
The Bulletin hears of a Sydney boarding-house-
keeper who contracted to put up Govt, guests at a
guinea a day, she being guai'anteed 19 guests for a
week. Only two came, and of these one left im-
mediately ; the other, who stayed, was the most
hideous bore in all the Vic. Assembly. So she
gets 133 guineas for looking after him for seven
days. The Bulletin wouldn’t stand him for
seven days for 933 guineas.
Several newspapers published Cardinal
Moran’s name as if he were in the procession on
Commonwealth Day. This, of course, was be-
cause they merely copied the official list issued
the day before. Long ago Sydney was surprised
by a similar mistake, but on a bigger scale.
Denison delivered a speech which offended R.C.
Archbishop Polding and the latter, failing to
extract an apology, adopted a vigorous way of
getting even. The State ball and banquet was
coming on, and, as Sydney was a small place
then, it took all the prominent people of all
the creeds to make the feast a success. Arch-
bishop Polding had the full sympathy of the
R. frequenters of Govt. House, and when the
night arrived they all stayed away. The idea
was that next day there would be a sensation, but
S. Hekald printed all the names of the
absentees as if they had been present, and there
was no sensation after all.
There is an am using development concern-
ing the O’Sullivan’s flatulent scheme to put up on
Pinchgut rock, Sydney Harbor, a colossal statue
of “ Australia facing the Dawn” (whatever that
may mean). The O’Sullivan’s colleague, Educa-
tion Minister Perry, is quite agreeable to the
erection of the proposed statue (a hideous monu-
mental-mason kind of thing, with an apartment
in its base for the caretaker to reside and fry
steak-and-onions in), but its location, he considers,
should be “on the spot where, geographically
speaking, Australia gets the first glimpse of dawn,
namely, the most eastern point on the seaboard ”
—-which happens to be on Cape Byron, in the
Ballina electorate, represented by Perry aforesaid.
At least Perry thinks so, but Australia sees the
dawn from the top of Mount Kosciusko and from
several other mountain tops before there is even a
gleam of it in Perry’s electorate.
Minister O’Sullivan thinks that the
£70,000 required to enable Australia to Pace the
Dawn in Sydney Harbor can easily be raised by
public subscription, and proposes sending round
the belltopper. In that case Minister Perry may
as well drop his idea of placing the monument on
Cape Byron in his own electorate. Sydney isn’t
likely to pay for a huge statue on a lonesome cape
where it will only be seen by passing mariners,
and if the hat is passed at Ballina it will probably
come back with nothing in it save a prawn.
The O’Sullivan proposes that the base of his
Pinchgut statue should be surrounded by effigies
of the great men who have helped to make Aus-
tralia. Which makes any real Australian
“ ONCE BITTEN," &c.
DAD: “Now, if you tell me the truth I will give
you something.”
CULPRIT: “ And if I tell a lie—you'll Let me off?”
Nationalist tired, when he remembers that, at the
Commonwealth celebrations, hardly a reference
was made to the men who had helped to
make Australia. In Queen’s Square, centred by
the Queen’s statue, where the Govt, made its
main effort at decoration and ilLumination, there
were written up the names of a lot of Imperial
regiments, but not a syllable about any of the men
who have helped to make Australia.
At the State banquet, paid for (like nearly
everything else) by Govt., what should have been
the toast of the evening “The Commonwealth,”
occupied not the place of honor, nor any place
within coo-ee of it, but was dumped right down
among the odds and ends in ler that the
Imperial gang might have plenty or time wherein
to whoop, before the drinking of the military and
naval toasts, over Australia’s noble share in help-
ing to choke the Afrikander Dutch ; and when
Chief Justice Griffith proceeded to talk about the
Australian Federation he was brutally shut up by
the crowd which had more or less complacently
listened to the other speeches.
The Bulletin denies that we have been cele-
brating the birth of the Australian Commonwealth.
Our so-called national celebrations have been
prostituted to a Jingo military carnival, glori-
fioatory of one of the most venal and ignoble wars
of the dead century. And the end is not yet !

It is, of course, the ss. a day rather than
any spirit of “patriotism” which is causing the
present rush for service in S’Africa. Let the same
sum be offered for any permanent employment
within the Commonwealth —with clothes, tools,
tents, and rations added, and a chance of promo-
tion—and there would be a wholesale rush for the
job, while the gilded youth would dance after the
positions of bosses and sub-bosses. Throw in a
free trip to a new country, the romance of the
campaign, and the thing, apart from all the high-
falutin of Imperialists, becomes quite alluring,
especially to the men most in demand by the Im-
perial authorities —men who, as matters stand, are
now slaving in the dismal, droughty, monotonous
far bush for from 12s. to 20s. a week, with a bit of
mutton, a pinch or two of tea, a pound or two of
treacly sugar, and some weevily flour thrown in.
Apropos, Sydney D.T. correspondent Frank
Wilkinson—lucubrating recently at Huddersfield,
England—cynically pooh-poohed the idea of Aus-
tralians having enthusiastically responded to the
“Empire’s call.” “He did not think the question
of the justness of the quarrel with the Transvaal
weighed with the volunteers. 'They did not care two-
pence about that; they simply wanted a hand
in the business.” The Australian soldiers, if
you accept Mr. Wilkinson’s statement, were in
fact simply light-hearted, careless brigands ; or, at
best, mercenaries out for a lark. And if, in the
future, went on Wilkinson, “the mother-country
was to have the support of Australia, Canada and
South Africa, the colonials must have a hand in
the framing of the laws affecting their govern-
ment. He looked to the time when representa-
tives of those colonies would sit in the Imperial
Parliament.” Well, in that case, unless the
House of Lords is to be abolished, certain Aus-
tralian peers would have to be manufactured ;
and once titled and planted in the “Lords” what
a fat lot of interest they'd take in tilings Austra-
lian ! However, it’s quite refreshing to see the
approximate truth blurted out once in a way by a
daily-newspaper official.

Returned troops get treated to queer
oratory. T’other week, when Hobart’s Mayor
was providing drinks for a batch of contingeuters
in his room at the Town Hall, he said : “I am
proud to welcome you back amongst me”—which
was certainly a neat way of identifying the rest of
the citizens with his worshipful self. Also the
Mayor congratulated Trooper Bisdee, the Y.C.
man, on his “election to the V.R.C. ,” whereat
the baubled hero smiled sportively. It was his
first intimation that he had been awarded a free
pass to Elemington races for valor in the field.

At the Schools Demonstration on Sydney
Cricket Ground two Imperial Tommies and a
Jack Tar were facetiously throwing remarks at a
country woman whose umbrella partly obscured
their view of the proceedings. The lady was just
about to comply with the popular demand when
one of the Tommies threw an over-ripe apricot
squash on top of the offending sunshade. It was
like firing on the white flag, and was promptly
resented by the garrison. IJp went the brolly
again with a snap. Squash came another apricot,
but there was no surrender. The besiegers ran
short of ammunition and fell back on language for
a while. Then one found a tomato, and shot it
with such bad aim that it struck the tight-lipped
garrison on the shoulder. It was the last straw ;
the woman turned and said sweetly, but with a
shrill little tang in her voice: “Oh, you are
Tommies, are you ? You’d better fire away, then;
the Lord knows you need practice.” The crowd
saw the point and roared approval. When the
Tommies had swaggered away, the lady beamed
triumphantly round on the bystanders, and
lowered her umbrella with honor.

the British warriors he is all out. Strange as it may
appear, Sydney girldom has taken to “ Tommy” not at

what features he may have had have been transformed

The sumptuary allowance of the Mayor of

Perth, and its gross abuse by the city councillors,
is the subject of a wire to the Eastern newspapers.
Mayor Brookman, who succeeded that great and
good man Alick Forrest, has “closed the bar,”
with a view of checking “ wholesale consumption”
»d of preventing councillors taking “entire
strangers into the refreshment-room, and giving
them drinks at the expense of the ratepayers. 55
Alick Forrest, as Mayor of Perth during succes-
sive years, had been so free-and-easy in this respect
that the position of City Councillor had gradu-
ally come to be regarded as carrying with it
the privilege of unlimited free drinks and
cigars at the ratepayers’ expense. The privi-
lege, indeed, had come to be regarded as in
the nature of a prescriptive right. The offi-

A stranger from the South writes of
Hughenden, N.Q. :
The first three men I met in Hughenden were drunk.
The next three were worse; they were frightfully drunk.
After that it seemed to me that only the police were
sobev . i n the main street the atmosphere had a beery
smell, probably because nearly every second door is the
opening to a bar. Upon inquiry as to the best hotel to
stop a t, a “ thrap ” informed me that “ Murphv’s wasn’t
badj an > Doolev, next dure, sold foine grog. Burke kept
a foine table 'wanst, an’ a rale noice pla-ace to go fur a

languidly down upon a drunk who was trying to put his
hat on his feet and get up at the same time. Seeing a pub.
w ith only three drunks on the stool in front, I entered
tripping over the feet of a fourth, who was gurgling
“ Soldiers of the Queen,” as I did so. A girl showed me
j n to a TO om containing two beds, a washstand, and an-
other drunk. This particular one had fallen asleep while
trying to shave himself with his pocket-knife. A most
unusual thing happened about dusk. It began to rain !
The phenomenon seemed to put new life into the dead-
heats. They poured forth from every yard and fowl-
house in the town. In two’s and three’s they rolled and
staggered down street, some of the weaker ones be-
for the night, I discovered that my room-mate had dis-
appeared, which was very comforting. Later I dreamt
that my bed was suddenly washed away through the
sudden bursting of the pile of beer-barrels that adorned
the back-yard Two policemen tried to save me, hut I
bumped against a tree, and awoke to find that the boozer
who shared the room with me had returned and thrown
himself down on me with the utmost abandon. 1
wiped the beer-froth, or soap-lather, or whatever it was,
off my hair, and left him there, while I used his bed.
Before breakfast next morning four men asked me to
“ comeanavadrink ” because it rained the night before!
At breakfast, one beery person prodded his nose with a
fork. He aimed at his mouth, but his hand was unsteady,

It has been reserved for Sydney City
Council to turn an oratorio into an indifferent
variety-show. When Govt, arranged to give an
invitation performance of “The Messiah” and
engaged the Town Hall for that purpose, it
occurred to the “ City Fathers” that a display of
fireworks from the roof of the building would
enhance the value of the entertainment, and as a
result the audience were treated to something
like this: “Comfort ye ” —swish—bang—“com-
fort ye, my”—crackle—fizz—“my people, saith
your”—bourn—bang—bang—and so on. Finally,
the hall filled with sulphurous fumes, and the
audience retreated in disorder.

The Hobart tragedy was a decidedly
romantic instance of the British-blooded man’s
infatuation for his wife’s sister. James Whyte,
schoolmaster, acted as iav reader at an Anglican
church, hence the exceeding warmth of his
brotherly feelings for any sister, and especially his
wife’s. The pretty spinster of 21 fired his fancy,
no doubt, by recalling memories of the one he had
married long ago. She grew to sweet womanhood
what time his wife was rearing baby after baby
(five in all), and to make matters worse she became
a teacher at his school, and then, just as he had
m irked her for his Number 2, poor James Whyte
got an awful shock. “Sister” Rhoda became
engaged to a young man named Potter. Brother
Jim, the father of 5, objected so strongly to the
match that Potter joined the Tasmanian con-
tingent for Africa in order to “ save trouble ” for
a while. Heaven only knows how earnestly
James Whyte prayed that Potter might die
gloriously fighting for the Queen. Twelve months
of weary wai ting for Potter’s name to appear among
the killed or dead of fever must have turned
the brain of Rhoda’s sister’s husband. But the
Boer failed to pot Potter, who came back from
the war last month in robust health, ready to carry
out his contract with the girl he’d left behind him.
This was too much for James Whyte. To think
of Rhoda’s m ish returning as a hero, with his face
bronzed by the S’African sun, and a medal in store
for him ! James Whyte wrote beseeching the
triumphant warrior to meet him at Hobart jetty,
but Potter prudently kept out of his way. There-
fore James, in his lay-reading lunacy, shot Rhoda
dead, also he slew her brother, who came rushing
to the scene, and finally he destroyed himself.
What we really need is a Bill to legalise marriage
with a live wife’s younger sister.

Told of Whyte, the central figure in the
Tasmanian tragedy aforesaid, that, when school-
teaching at Warrnambool (Vic.) he threatened to
shoot a young lady who scorned his addresses.
Being prevented, he took the revolver m his lelt
hand and, quoting the Scriptural injunction,
thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,” proceeded
to blow off the offending member, but only suc-
ceeded in shifting the thumb-nail. His aim
t’other day was much more deadly, but there was
not Bible precedent for that.

A Woollahra (Sydney) episode of
the other day. There was a ring at the
front door of a comfortable-looking house.
The head of the family was reading in
the drawing - room at the time, and
answered the door in a rather cross
frame of mind. Outside a grey-haired,
frowsy, worn-out man desired to sell
moth-balls. The sunlight interfered with
the householder’s eyes and the hawker
irritated him. -He refused to buy moth-
balls on any account, and was on the
point of closing the door and the inter-
view abruptly when the pedlar changed
his pleading tone and said aggressively,
“ They’re only a penny ; can’t you afford
it ? ” Then the indignant householder
glared in the face of the moth-baller and
was just starting to order him off the
premises, but he stopped suddenly and
his jaw dropped right on the floor with
amazement. The merchant’s stock drop-
ped at the same moment. It was a meet-
ing of two brothers who had disappeared
from each other’s knowledge for nearly
20 years. And then —well, either the
affluent brother took the wreck in and
made him rich and happy; or else he
bought one moth-ball from him to en-
courage him and gave him his blessing
and closed the door gently; or else he
told him that he was a disgrace to the
family and closed the door vociferously.
It doesn’t matter much how you end a
story like that.

Two of the Victorian Ministers who
visited Sydney to see the Commonwealth blaze
went back with the conviction that it was about
time Melbourne had a Centennial Park of its
own. There is now some talk of turning the
howling, froggy wastes of West Melbourne swamp
into a recreation ground to match the splendid
Centennial, and it is to be hoped the idea will not
be allowed to perish. The vast muddy waste of the
swamp, when it is viewed with the sunset on it from
the railway line about Essendon or Moonee Ponds,
is calculated to make any citizen go and sit hard
down on the railway line and wait for the express
to come along. It suggests the blasted heath in
“ Macbeth,” only it is muddy instead of blasted,
and the background is slush and eels instead of
history. When Sydney Centennial Park was
created it also blotted out a swamp, but not quite
so painful a variety as West Melbourne’s.
Sydney’s old swamp was a sombre picture. Mel-
bourne’s is a low-down horror.

to set right a small injury to his hip-
joint, which was of old standing. I
told him that the only remedy was
a serious operation and that, as he
had nothing to complain of but a
slight limp, the best course for him
would be to let the limb alone. He
thanked me for my advice and went
away. Some months afterwards,
when driving past a large house in a
fashionable suburb, I noticed a
funeral procession about to leave it.
Recognising one of the mourners, I
asked Mm who was to be buried.
‘Oh,’said he, ‘Mr. Blank. A few
days ago Mr. (he named a well-
known surgeon) excised his hip-joint.
The operation was well performed,
but the sufferer died three days after-
wards.’ The corpse was my patient with the
slight limp.”

Australian scientists pooh-pooh the alleged

Tesla, the man who received the “message,” has
done several things of note, especially in electrical
physics, but is looked at askance by the scientific

At the present moment the planet Mars is even
more unfavorably situated for communicating
with the Earth than usual, being more than double
the distance he sometimes is away. And when
you reckon by millions of miles, it is apparent
that the Tesla on Mars has chosen a bad time to
signal to his pal on the Earth.

A WOMANS LETTER.
Sydney, January 15, 1901.
My Deab Mykk.—
Although Champagne Commonwealth is a week
old, people are still babbling about their invita-
tions. In fact, many people are only just receiv-
ing theirs. A prominent business man got an
invitation yesterday to the Commercial Lunch,
but as he had been to it a fortnight be-
fore, and paid thirty shillings to go, he does not.
think he need accept. Some awful bungles took
place. The Forrests never got any of their invita-
tions until Madame sent up every day for them.
People who were proud and reticent and
would not ask came off badly, as the Government
was not taking any notice of pride. Even
Premier Lyne had some difficulty in getting his
cards, not receiving them till the eleventh hour.
Syd. Long, President of the Society of Artists,
who had given several weeks’ attendance on the
decoration committee, got no cards for anything,
and had to listen to the pop of champagne corks
from afar. But it is generally admitted that one
had only to ask to receive, and besides, it is too
early in the day to say that you didn’t get an
invitation to anything. One might arrive any
day.
Distinguished Visitors grumbled a good deal at
being sent where they did not want to go. They
reckoned they ought to have had the choice of
amusements. Parties who craved for “the Mes-
siah ” got relegated to the Bicycle Sports, and
people who yearned for the “Bohemian Girl”
were sent off down the harbour, and so on. But,
of course, it was not possible to please 17,000
people—especially gratis people, who always ex-
pect the most —and on the whole the celebrations
seem to have given a fair proportion of good times
all round.
Chicken dla Wise was the novel delicacy on the
Commonwealth menu of a Sydney cafe last week.
How the champagne did flow over everything !
For a week there was not a dry spot in town. At
the landing of Captain Cook at Botany the
Government liquor was laid on with special pro-
fusion. Even the police had wet both eyes, and
when a lady asked for a glass of water much diffi-
culty was made about getting it. “But we can
give you champagne,” they said. The landing
took place on a scorchingly hot day. Immense
crowds of people sweltered in the sun, and, to add
to their aggravation, “ Captain Cook ” stepped off
the boat slowly and began to pick flowers in a
most leisurely way and smell them, and turn over
rocks with a stick, and examine the sand with an
unhurried botanical eye. This was realism with
a vengeance. The thousands of onlookers, how-
ever, did not care a straw for the realism, and
reckoned the vengeance was unusually slow.
Two of the new year’s alleged honors fell to two
very popular Sydney people. One of them—Bob
Garran, only son of Dr. Andrew Garran—could
never be overlooked. He stands six feet four in
his socks, and has a lovely reputation for never
having refused an invitation to anything in the
shape of tea-parties, dances, and at-homes. The
wife of ex-Treasurer M‘Millan is also a well-liked
society member, a graceful, charming, woman,
moving in the limited circle that worships intellect
rather than frivol.
I hear that Lady Hopetoun is going to make
pink the colour this season. Many of the magni-
ficent dresses she brought out with her are in
different shades of rose, cherry, and malmaison.
When the Countess was choosing her wardrobe
for Australia she went to Lady Warwick’s dress-
making atelier, and had her dark statuesque
beauty carefully considered. Her own choice ran
to pink, and the atelier coincided and made her
reception-gowns, ball-frocks, and race-dresses re-
peat the pink note as often as possible. By the
way. Worth is being wiped out by the glories of
this Lady Warwick shop. “This dress came
from Worth,” is all very well, but is nothing to
Mrs. Waterloo-Jones’ voice talking about “My
frock from Lady Warwick’s.”
Pink is universally unbecoming. They used to
call pink awl black “the plain woman’s salva-
tion,” but artists in dress know better now, and
the color has been out of fashion for years. And
yet how tired we all are of blue ! Blue has been
the only color in Sydney lately—excepting last
week,. when we painted things red. Turquoise
blue ribbon was not to be had at any draper’s for
weeks. Pale-blue scarves, with fringed silk ends,
were sold in enormous numbers. Then white hats
trimmed with sky-blue glace took up the cerulean
tale, and a blue petticoat and a blue parachute—
I can’t call it a sunshade—became indispensable.
The result is we are all tired to death of turquoise,
and will welcome the pink season gladly.
Especially those who ought to shun it like the
pla'ue—for I notice the people who don’t suit a
color are always the first to rush into it.
Hopetoun Hospital is mending its convalescents
briskly. Hopey and the Countess have both been
driving about the town lately. Yes, and diploma-
tically, for spiteful stories were flying round about
Lady H.’s invalidism. It was whispered that her
illness was carefully nursed, but not with a view
to getting rid of it. However, the sight of that
worn, white, expressionless face above a drab
cloak dispelled some of the chatter. She looks
genuinely pulled down, and very tired and thin.
The V.R. party moves to Melbourne Govt. House
in February.
Sidney was surprised to hear of sulky Wilfred
Smith’s marriage with Lady Violet Somerset.
She was the tall, fair-haired girl who came out
with her cousin, Lady Mary, and was said to be
engaged to His Ex. Sydney reckoned Wilfred
its most disagreeable aide to date. He scared
people off Govt. House steps with a glance. Also,
he was the hero of the famous Blue Ticket Ball
who stopped a guest at the supper-room with,
“ You ve been in before !” As ne was the only
aide to stay to the end of Lord Beauchamp’s
regime people thought lie must be suffering from
a sense of duty, but now it turns out that it might
have been his fiancee’s return to England that
spoiled him for a diplomat.
The engagement of the week is that of Miss
Wills-Alien to Major Jack Antill. The lady is
young, pretty, and in her first season, and is the
eldest daughter of the wealthy squire of Gunnible,
a smart station near Gunnedah. Mrs. Wills-
Allen gave an engagement tea at the Australia
last week, but the handsome bridegroom-elect,
who comes from Picton, and is a brother of Mrs.
Lassetter’s, only showed up for a few minutes,
dressed in kharki. He had only landed that
morning with the returned troops.
A military man has made a great impression on
Sydney fashions. I refer to Capt. Evelyn Wood,
of the Imperial troops, don’t-you-know, who set
going the craze for a big broad-leafed white straw
hat, turned up o.i each side, and tied round with
a black ribbon. This is all round the town now,
and has become quite the Johnnie badge, although
the effect over a vacuous Johnnie face is something
woeful.
Sydney is watching curiously a Society-woman
who has been away, and come back with the
same pet poodle on her string. Which reminds
me that the Queen of Holland has had a telephone
built between her palace and her fiance’s, and, if
you think that’s irrelevant, let me add I was only
thinking that she had him on a string all right.
A book whose charm and simplicity have won
it affection all over the world is “ Elizabeth and
her German Garden.” For a long time the
anonymity of the book has baffled everyone. Its
German coloring set a rumor going that the
lovely Princess of Pless —Mrs. Cornwallis West’s
daughter—is the author, although the professional
frivolling of the West family might have done
away with that idea, as Elizabeth is bounded
placidly by two babies and a garden. I have just
happened on the “real truth,” as children say. The
author is a Sydney girl named May Beauchamp.
She was born in Sydney at our Admiralty House,
then the private home of her father, Mr. Henry
Beauchamp, a local merchant. She went to Italy
in her girlhood to study music, and while abroad
met a German named Count von Arnheim, mar-
ried him, and settled in Berlin. When she had
been married a few years she began to write.
Her books have had enormous success. They were
all anonymous, but her relatives in Australia
began to let the secret out some time ago.
Speaking of the Yorks, a friend lately gave me
a vivid description of the Duke and his papa.
They were on their way to some affair, and my
friend’s shandrydan got blocked right opposite
theirs. For the space of five minutes she drank hard
of Royalty. There they sat, side by side. Through
the glass they looked like two barber’s blocks.
Every hair was in its place. Their beards stuck
out in wooden stiffness. Their heads looked nailed
on. The indescribable, impossible perfection of
their attire, their attitudes, their immovability,
the unutterable fit of their gloves and trousers,
gave them a weirdly waxy unreal look ; and then,
to add to the unreality, was the stupid expression
in the two pairs of glassy eyes staring fixedly into
the white satin of the carriage.
Everyone is in love with the new lounge and
tea-room at the Australia. The court straight
in from the front hall is turned into a Winter
Garden, with a big lounge room opening at one
side, fitted with little tables, cretonne-colored
divans, and alluring arm chairs.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ It is now settled that the Federal Parliament
is to meet, not in Melbourne Parliament House,
but in a specially-fitted-up portion of the Exhibi-
tion Building. The work is already in hand, and
Govt, has adopted a scheme for the decoration of
the place. There is to be plenty of gilt, and lots
of cream and blue and green and buff ; the designs
look rather tawdry and theatrical. It would have
been better had polished Australian woods been
used, specially selected for beauty of grain.
“The only Sydney shows the Maddens favored
were the military review at Centennial Park, the
two swagger command-nights at the theatre, and
the harbour trip in the Thetis, where a few select
souls were invited to meet the English officers.
But this choice contingent was kept in the dark,
literally and figuratively, and aspiring girls went
home wondering why they didn’t meet it.
“Mrs. George Turner is gleefully telling Melb.
friends how she was the first Australian
Prenneress or Anybody to grasp the Gov.-Gen.
by the hand at the swearing-in sbivoo. Nobody
who witnessed the act will ever forget it. The
wily lady kept a lynx-eye on the procession
advancing in the distance, till she sighted the
feathers in H.E.’s cocked hat. Then she took up
her position on the steps of the kiosk, with
Mayoress Gillott less than a nose behind, till the
clanking figure of the Gov. got within arm-stretch
and the trick was done before the gaping
spectators recovered their breath. She had
introduced Mayoress Gillott in the twinkling of
an eye and the pair of conspirators then stepped
back quite pleased with themselves.
“Some curious reasons were given for not
voting for George Turner at last St. Kilda elec-
tion. St. Kilda is partly a democratic and partly
a ‘ toney ’ suburb. Lady canvassers who looked
up voters in the wealthier part of the electorate
were over and over again met by the singular
objection from electors’ wives that G.T. only kept
one servant, and that the Premier of the State
ought to keep at least two ? The fact that Turner
is a man who insists on paying his way and would
think it discreditable to do a thing he'really could
not afford, did not appeal to these folks. Years
ago objection was taken to Jolin Morley, in Eng-
land, that he was the first British Cabinet
Minister who did not keep a footman but had his
front door opened by a maid. Turner may be
the first Victorian Premier who has not kept
two servants; but if lie hadn’t felt that he
could afford that one, Victoria might have had
a Premier who scrubbed his own verandah and
polished up his own doorplate. So the toney part
of St. Kilda might have been even more shocked.
“Speaking of his illness to one of the digni-
taries at the Sydney Govt. House banquet, the
genial Excellency declared, with all his old buoy-
ancy of manner— ‘But the d thing was the
colic! ’ That’s the proper way to Governor-
General Australia. Call your diseases ‘ dam
things,’ and your success is assured.
“Poor Bishop Goe didn’t go to Sydney
Commonwealth rejoicings because of ‘indisposi-
tion.’ He was terribly ill last winter, but the
present trouble is that Mrs. Goe’s malady has
appeared again, and goes from bad to worse. The
trouble is in the spine, so the patient is debarred
from even temporary surgical relief. The Goes
are a typical Darby and Joan couple, and every-
one sympathises with them in their trial.
“Mrs. Wesley Hall, left a widow in the midst
of her jubilating in Sydney, had bad luck right
through the trip. She lost her travelling and
dressing case in the first place, some jewels in the
second, and her husband in the third. All of
them are things that she will miss. The death
was very sudden, though the millionaire had been
ailing and in rather a wretched state of health for
some time. He went about everywhere with his
youthful spouse, of whom he was very proud.
Feeble and stooped in figure, and dull in conver-
sation, people believed Mr. Wesley Hall to be 20
years older than his age. Leg. Council President
Zeal, who had been his best man at his second
marriage, acted at the funeral as principal pall-
bearer.
“Lieut. Skene, killed in a recent S’African
fight, was the Melbourne lad who should have got
the appointment on the permanent staff which was
cut and dried by the Sassiety crowd for its pet,
Mr. Lilley. Skene was practically the only man
available who conformed to regulations, but, with
a view to working a job, the military authorities
extended the age-limit, allowing Lilley to apply.
Before the thing could be completed, however,
somebody opened his mouth and the fat was in the
fire, when it was pointed out that Lilley would have
to pass an exam, prior to appointment. He went
for one test, and failed, whereupon, extraordinary
to relate, the military gang gave him another
chance, on the principle that the small boy, when
bowled first ball, always claims that it was only a
‘trial.’ Lilley went for a second exam., and
failed again. Thus a promising job was wrecked.
Skene, disgusted with the whole thing, withdrew
his application and a third man got the appoint-
ment. Subsequently Lilley went to Africa with
Price’s contingent, and Skene, kept out of the
local troops probably by the same influence, went
to the Cape ‘ on his own ’ and entered a local regi-
ment. To-day finds poor Lilley (shot through the
head in the Paardeberg fight) a cripple, paralysed
possibly for life ; while Skene lies buried on the
veldt. One at least would have been alive and
well to-day had the Victorian ‘War Office’ gone
straight.
“ A Melbourne girl had her honeymoon port-
manteau labelled ‘Passenger to Paradise’ by a
wag the other day. She didn’t discover it till
she ai'rived at her mountain eyrie and found all
the attendants tittering. The unfortunate couple
found it impossible to play the long-married game,
so they relieved their indignation in a hot letter
to the offender.
“ Old Edmund Keogh, who died at Meriden, on
St. Kilda Load, last week, had buried a wife long
ago ere he married Mdle. Pignolet, a French
school-mistress. The jovial old fellow was ill for
months before his death. His charming French
wife nursed him devotedly, turned her eyes to
Heaven when asked how he was, and is broken-
hearted at her loss. By the first wife Edmund
Keogh had a large family, who are scattered all
over Victoria.
“ A wealthy Australian girl travellingin Europe
has just married a Yankee medico. She is Miss
Jennie Law, whose father was the senior partner
in Law, Somner and Co. Left an orphan, she
amused herself by travelling, and knew France,
Italy, and Germany as well as she knew the Block.
She belonged to the Dante Society, the Alliance
Francaise, the Swiss and German Societies, and
all the Melbourne coteries where foreign languages
are pattered. Last year, she left Melbourne to
travel alone through Russia and Siberia, but in
Austria a New York doctor seems to have taken
compassion on her loneliness, and she on his, and
so they have fixed things up in the usual way.
He gets a bride with a fortune, and she ends the
anxieties of her many friends—for a pretty girl
with money is a dangerous thing to be wandering
about the world alone.
“School speech-days and other seasonable
shivoos are bringing into great prominence the
small girl ‘ whose eyes turn down because she is
shy, and whose nose turns up because she is pert,’
and the fact is revealed that a great change has
come over juvenile gowning. The Kate Green-
away girl with Dutch bonnet, long clinging
frock and a look of cherubic comfyness, who
hugs a doll and beams benignly on the universe,
has disappeared before the Hilda Cowhan kiddie
with flying hair and an impudent nose-tilt.
Is the chubby child extinct or merely disguised
by inappropriate pinnies ? As the twentieth cen-
tury toddlers promise to be altogether of the new
type, teachers and governesses will have a lively
time before the century is in its teens! Nellie
Stewart’s little daughter at a matinee lately was a
model of the newest frocking in a white silk dress
gathered into a waistband, much white silk stock-
ing visible, and a vast hat with a multitudinous
swirl of white and blue trimmings.
“This story belongs to a big Melb. charity
bazaar, and relates to the munificence of a dis-
tinguished citizen who is a pillar of Church and
Empire. He was wandering amongst the stalls
when a pert little girl approached him with a con-
tribution-box. He turned pale at the sight of the
box, and would have fled, but the damsel smartlv
cut off his retreat, and instantly attacked him with
a battery of smiles and many coaxing pouts and
glances. Wouldn't he give something for so good
a cause—something, anything, nomatter how small;
even half-a-crown would be gratefully accepted.
The large citizen, seeing no hope of escape, felt
all his pockets with obvious reluctance, and then
said : ‘ I have no small change wi’ me, my dear,
but here’s a coupon—l’ll gi’ ye that an’ welcome.’
And the munificent magnate dropped an ordinary
green trade-coupon into the box. The big man
never fully appreciated the bitterness of human
ingratitude until he found that the little girl was
rapidly filling her box by telling the story of the
coupon at Od. a time.
“The young Duke of Manchester, whose
father-in-law (Zimmerman) has paid his debts to
the extent of £26,000, was on offer to any Aus-
tralian girl with a sufficiently long purse. When
in Melbourne, he inquired after heiresses as
frankly as a visitor to Sydney during last week
may have inquired after lodgings. He danced
with many nice girls, %vent to many nice houses,
but it was Money he was after. And he was such
an egregious young bounder. There are heiresses
in Victoria, but none stooped so low as to wish to
have His Grace of Manchester for a husband.
He was too cheap to be dear to any girl.
“By the way, I came across an interesting
document the other day, bound up in a volume of
MS. letters of introduction received by Sir John
Franklin when Governor of Van Diemen’s Land.
It is dated 14th July, 1836, and introduced to Sir
John, Colonel Price’s father, John Price, whom
it described as a ‘ very well-conducted and respect-
able and gentlemanly person —a younger son of
Sir Rose (or Roxe) Price, a baronet in Cornwall,
and a nephew on the mother’s side of Lord Talbot.
He is fond of agriculture, and superintended his
father’s landed property in Cornwall. Not having
any lucrative employment in England he wishes
to try his fortune in Van Diemen’s Land.’ Thus
did Maurice Frere make his debut in these
regions.
“Australian girls might as well take to heart
the story of a cookery club which had 12 happy
months of existence in the North of England.
Very likely the tale is strictly untrue, but the
moral remains beautiful, nevertheless. The club-
bites were an ardent band of spinsters, and they
started with the sole intention of assisting
culinary art and putting down indigestion. They
gave a weekly dinner, taking it in turns to do the
cooking and serving, and, by way of widening
the club’s sphere of influence, each member in-
vited a brother, cousin, or mere ‘ boy ’ friend to
join in the attack. At the end of the tenth
month only the two plainest cooks were left out of
the original club. And they presently devised a
meal of nine courses which brought their respec-
tive old bachelor brothers to the ‘ popping ’ point,
each bachelor popping to the other one’s plain sis-
ter. Next month the club terminated, for the two
surviving members had been removed by marriage.
Which proves that there is an after-dinner
moment in the life of every male creature when
he yields submissively to the allurements of his
cook. First catch your ‘boy’ and then feed him
wisely till he experiences a gentle love-pang
behind the fifth button of his waistcoat. A hot
dish, they say, curries favor quicker than any-
thing.
“Musgrove’s dizzy dancers, the Darto couple,
could neither speak nor understand a word of
English when they started for Australia. On the
voyage waggish fellow-passengers took the lingual
Innocents Abroad in hand and coached them in
alleged ‘conversational English.’ First time
Mdme. murmured in her table steward’s blushing
ear ‘ Leetle more sugar, Honey ! ’ the flattered
hearer fancied himself a lady-killer, but his mates
combed him down later by explaining that, thanks
to her tutors, the liquid-eyed foreigner sounded
more ardent than she knew.
“There was nearly trouble, though, when a
pompous she-tourist, observing patronisingly to
male Darto : ‘ The accommodation on the Conti-
nent is dreadful, but I must admit I enjoyed my
night in your Vienna,’ received the caressing
‘Did urns, now?’ The dowager never condoned
this ‘ impertinence,’ though as time went on she
dropped to the fact that ‘ Did urns ! ’ was the cul-
prit’s stock reply to all chance remarks.
“Ex-Treas. Shiels (Vic.) has a little daughter
who rides out with him on horseback in boy’s
knickerbockers. The little lady may be seen
almost any morning enjoying a canter round St.
Kilda beach, on a horse big enough for a life-
guardsman.
Yours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.
Dugald Thomson, it appears, is to be
N.S.W. Treasurer when See takes the Premier-
ship.
Jacky Underwood, full-blooded Queens-
land aboriginal, was sentenced to death months
ago for murder (committed in conjunction with
Jimmy Governor, who is to be hanged at Sydney
this Thursday morning and who has also been
kept much over the usual time awaiting his doom).
Just before ascending the scaffold at Dubbo on
Monday he inquired of the sheriff “Whether he
would be in Heaven in time for dinner.” It is
evidently hard for a savage, however well-drilled
in white man theology, to get away from first
principles, and it was indeed a solemn farce to
hang Jacky as a deterrent to other blacks.

Tlieru was a frantic rush for the new
M.L. universal-postage stamp, but the supply
was very limited, and in a majority of places no-
body secured more than three. A big demon-
stration at Wellington G.P.O. signalised the
introduction of the novelty, and Postmaster-
General .Ward was eulogised at great length.
In Melbourne, a few days ago, a man died
suddenly ; a doctor certified to his death, and he
was in a fair way for being buried. Then he
came to life again. A few hours later he died
again and a doctor again certified to his death,
and this time he remained dead long enough to
allow of burial. Apropos of which, a French
medical writer of 150 years ago recorded 54 cases
of persons who were buried alive. And it isn’t
once in 1000 or 10,000 times that a person who is
really buried alive has a chance to make the fact
known. How many unknown cases of premature
burial are represented by the handful of known
cases ?
An American correspondent of Sydney
D.T., referring" to the American navigation law
which prevents the Vancouver-line steamers from
carrying freight for U.S. producers to or from
Honolulu, says that while the regulation is some-
what unjust to Australian and British shipping
interests, “it is principally so to the residents of
HonoluLu, who are to-day American citizens. No
matter what the necessity of marketing their pro-
ducts, they must wait for an American ship. No
matter what the necessity of going to the States,
they must wait for an American ship. No matter
if relations or friends are dying or dead, they
must wait for an American ship. Probably the
law will soon be amended ; but at any rate neither
the people of Honolulu nor of the Australian
colonies were thought of when it was enacted.”
The Bulletin’s “ Policy for the Com-
monwealth ” is now ready, and can be obtained
at the office of this paper, price 6d., or it will be
forwarded to any part of Australia, Tasmania, or
Maoriland for Bd. in stamps. This pamphlet is a
reprint of a long series of articles from The Bul-
letin, with an appendix dealing with the Fiscal
Question. A large number of press notices have
already appeared, including a large, general, and
indignant curse by the Freetrade press. Samples
of said curse herewith :
It is written in a tone of what was called by the late
Lord John Russell “ infernal cocksu red ness” which atones
for ignorance of the very elements of political economy.—
Sydney Evening News.
The Bulletin was one of the most unreasoning sup-
porters of Federation at any price. Now that a Conser-
vative constitution has been foisted on the people it:
talks about a policy. It is a pity it didn’t think about
the matter beforehand. . . . Its belated policy now only
means so much waste space and nonsense.—lnverell

The subject of this pamphlet has already been inflicted
on the public per medium of The -Bulletin, and the
reason for its second publication in pamphlet form seems
somewhat obscure.—Wellington (N.S.W.) Gazette.
Consistently vulgar in expression. . . . Makes us long
to kick the author up one side of George-street and down

PERSONAL ITEMS.
David Syme has presented the widow of
his late war-correspondent Lambie with a cheque
for £lOOO. Good Scot!
A week or so after James Dickson, of
Queensland, and William M‘Millan, of Sydney,
had been knighted, one was dead and the other
seriously ill.
Reported that G. H. Reid, in crossing to
Tasmania, on an alleged Freetrade campaign,
suffered much from sea-sickness. Evidently Yes-
No is as much averse to water as his Dry Dog.
Dr. Quick makes it known that he is not
Australian-born. He comes from about the same
place as Sam Griffith, of Queensland, and pro-
fesses an equally fervid appreciation of royal
favours.
Henniker Heaton’s wife, then unmarried,
was the “Rose Lorraine” of Henry Kendall’s
lines. She was, as is known, the daughter of
Sam. Bennett, who was a generous patron of the
wayward poet.
The Australian Commonwealth’s first
Ministry was made up wholly of men of title,
with one exception—Deakin. They possessed
either titles of office, P.C.’s, or titles toddling
towards the peerage.
'Tis said, in London, that a certain ex-
Queenslander offered to endow his daughter with
a million sterling if the Duke of Marlborough
would come up to scratch. But, as all the world
knows, the Vanderbilt offered more.
Vabien Solomon, the leader of S.A.
Opposition, is the first local politician to announce
his Federal candidature by means of a paid T for
advt. Numbers of more frugal gentlemen have
contrived to do the same thing on the cheap.
Mr. Blackmore, S.A. Clerk of Parlia-
ment, who acted as clerk to the Federal Conven-
tion, is tipped for the clerkship of the Federal
Parliament —which is sheer blasphemy, consider-
ing that the services of Jenkins, C.M.G., are
available.
It came as a relief to S.A. newspaper
readers last week to find that S’Langdon Bony-
thon, the much-advertised editor-proprietor of
Adelaide Advertiser, had arrived. Unless fur-
ther puff is necessary in view of election contin-
gencies, the public will now have a well-deserved
rest.
Chairman of N.S.W. Public Service Board
Barling leaves for a six months’ holiday trip in
March. He has not yet decided whether N.S.W.
can afford to grant the general division of the
public service a third week’s annual leave such as
the other divisions are allowed. As Mr. Barling
is well on in the sixties, the public service has
jumped to the conclusion that he intends to retire
after his holiday. But as everyone in the service
with a grievance against the P.S. Board invari-
ably blames “Barling,” the wish may only be
father to the thought.
Inspector Bremner, who was unfortunately
killed by a runaway horse at the Sydney Com-
monwealth celebrations, was the policeman who
took down the alleged blasphemous speech of
William Lorando Jones in Parramatta Park,
25 years ago. Bremner was then sergeant.
Jones was a long-bearded, dome-headed old
party, a rude sort of sculptor, who
thought little of Bible characters and
gave tongue to that effect. Ninian
Melville, who became Chairman of
Committees in the Leg. Assembly
afterwards, was shocked and set
Bremner to make a case. The
outcome was that old Lorando
was tried and sent to prison.
Through the exertions of the
Unitarian Rev. James Pil-
lars, afterwards killed at
South Head, the public was
aroused and a demand
made that the sentence
should be
quashed. It
was the sen-
sation of the
day, but
there was no
mistaking
the trend of
public opinion,
and after the
usual shuffling the
Govt, ordered the
patriarch’s release.
Lorando’s face and
head are, it is said,
doing duty on a
Sydney church as
the upper part of
one of the Twelve
Apostles. The
mason who haJ the
work of cutting the
figures took the head of
Jones for one, and there it
still is. Bremner received
some blame for his share
in the transaction, but it
was not really Bremner
but Ninian Melville and
the state of the law which
deserved censure. Jones,
Pillars, Melville, Bremner,
and most of the other active
participants in the fray are
now dead.
The deceased F. 0. B. Vosper, M.L.A.,
came of a very old Cornish family, and claimed on
his mother’s side descent from the great Lord
Burleigh. Present scribe, who has heard nearly
all Australian orators, would, for a purely invec-
tive and satirical speech, have backed vosper
against any other politician on this continent.
Rev. Dalton is on the job again. He
comes to Australia to make another book out of
the doings of the Duke and Duchess of York.
When York and Clarence visited Australia
19 years ago, tutor Dalton was their bear-leader,
and the book he then wrote got him made a canon.
This one may make him a bishop.
Died in Adelaide lately G. D. Glyde,
known a quarter of a century ago as commercial
reporter and editor, first of Melb. Argus and
afterwards of Adelaide Advertiser. He was
making a fortune wheat-buying and wheat-
shipping in S. Australia when he was lured into
politics; and soon he came down between two
stools.
A well-informed military officer in
Melbourne says that both Generals Curly Hutton
and Pole-Carew were after the billet of Command-
ant of the Australian troops, and that it was
known before Roberts left S’Africa that the latter
was likely to get the post. But it is like counting
chickens before they are hatched to reckon who
will get a billet that is not yet created.
H. P. Moore, a banker and a son of a
pioneer doctor, succeeds to the management of
the wealthy absentee S. A. Co. in succession to the
late H. Y. Sparks, who was chiefly famous for his
attempted thrashing,of Kingston. Not only did
Kingston wrest the whip from his assailant, but
it was through his mediation that the aggressive
manager was saved from dismissal by the
frightened London board.
Premier Seddon, whom uniform and cocked
hat made him an opera-bouffe king, blazed in-
dignantly at a Sydney pressman while denounc-
ing Gov. O’Brien’s threat to deport the seditious
clergyman from Fiji. “ I’ll see about it,” snapped
Dick; “certainly I’ll see about it. It’s tyran-
nous, despotic, un-British.” “By the way,” said

The statement that Constable Helsham,
late of Bankstown (N.S.W.), is supposed to
have gone to Scotland to take his place as
baronet or earl or something in succession
to a deceased relative recalls an incident in
the life of the late Constable Pilkington, who
was the son of an English baron. In travel-
ling (1881) from Inverell to Glen Innes he called
at a station at nightfall, and, revealing his iden-
tity to the squatter, asked for accommodation.
As he was “only a policeman,” the squatter took
him to the kitchen and handed him over to cook
and groom. Pilkington indignantly declined to
enter and sat on the fence smoking till his horse
had had a feed ; then he resumed his journey un-
refreshed.
Apropos of several things. Had Cardinal
Moran taken part in the Commonwealth proces-
sion and driven three miles
through the streets with a cer-
tain gentleman at his side, as
usual, he might have ex-
pected a good deal of
very rough chaff from a
huge mixed crowd out for
a holiday. Comments
would have been varied and
many, so perhaps it is as
well all round that the pre-
cedence question bobbed up,
or was made to bob up, to
save the situation.

Yic. Premier Turner is credited
with never reading a book. That also
is what Parkes used to say of G. H. Reid.
But there is one book which is ever open
before Georgey-Porgey. It is the Book
of Human Nature, and Yes-No has read
therein that most men are fools and that
the public has no memory.
“In Australia, avoirdupois has
dominated the Legislatures,” remarks
Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Bulle-
tin always recognised the mana of the
Fat Man. Our foremost politicians and
lawyers, from the earliest days, were
nearly all men of bulk, and the more
nearly they approached the type of the
big-skulled, big-chested, columnar-neclced
Daniel O’Connell, the more mighty they
were. Nearly all the celebrated men of
the old Yic. and N.S.W. bars —Aspinall,
Ireland, Dawson, Molesworth, Martin,
Dailey, Darvall, Dunne, Martley, and so
on —were no featherweights, and almost
every successful Australian editor who
has lasted long has been fat and broad
in the beam. Fat is force.
Sir John Tenniel drops out of Lon-
don Paunch’s pages, and the occasion is
deemed worthy of special cable to the
Australias. Plain John Tenniel did some
strong cartoons for the solemn comic in
his day, but his time was not the day of
the process-block, and the zinc etching
smothered him. Many of his recent
wood-engravings were poor, and stilted,
and old-fashioned enough, and looked
out of place on a modern bookstall, espe-
cially (as sometimes happened) when the
hurried engravers neglected to “jine their
flats.” Tenniel remained a fetish with
old-fashioned admirers of the old fashioned
thing, but instinctively Tenniel was a
pa'nter, and his best art doings are not in
his cartoons, but in his friezes and other
decorative work. Linley Sambourne takes
Tenniel’s place. Sambourne’s figures are
all cast in bronze, and yet, metallic and
unemotional as his drawings are, he went
far in the making of Phil May, who runs a free
and fluent pen.
Premier Holder is hurt at being left out
of the Barton Cabinet. He told an Adelaide in-
terviewer that under Lyne he could have had any
office he chose to ask for, and that if he had not
stood out Barton would never have been given the
chance to form a Government. Yet he was not
so much as consulted by the latter gentleman,
although all the other State Premiers were con-
sidered. “If I had pushed my claims as some
others did,” he remarked pointedly, “I could
have forced myself into the Cabinet, but I pre-
ferred to retain my self-respect.
The first N.S. Wales C.M.G. was the late
Henry Halloran, erstwhile Principal Under-Sec-
retary, a poet with a talent for making enemies.
’Tis said that an Australian C.M.G., dying on a
visit to his native heath, was denied Christian
burial, the rural priest interpreting the letters in
an obnoxious sensq. The bishop, however, inter-
vened, and the ex-publican was slid under the soil
with the usual blessing. Old Ferdinand Mueller,
scientist, was, up to a very recent date, the only
Australian of natural talent who took a C.M.G.
When the news of the relief of Mafeking
reached the backblock W.A. town of, say Koola-
mingar, one of the local parsons sat on the balcony
of the chief hotel and warbled, in a strong Scotch
accent, a ditty of his own writing and composi-
tion, the chorus of which informed the multitude
below that —
Mafekiflg’s relieved ! —Yes, Mafeking’s relieved !
By Goad’s own grace, we kept the-e pla-ace—
And Mafeking’s R-relieved !
A deputation of influential citizens subsequently
waited on the performer, begging him to have the
poem published, but even he was not game for
that.
There is a proposal among the Sydney
alleged Freetraders to provide for G. H. Reid a
fund, the interest of which will render him inde-
pendent of his profession, and enable him to de-
vote all his time to politics. G. H. Reid (as the
public knows) is poor; if he neglects his law-
business for politics he will die a pauper, as all
the others have done. General Managers French
and Dibbs, of the Bank of N.S.W. and the Com-
mercial Bank of Sydney respectively, have at least
£3500 each, and permanent appointments at that;
but the General Manager, for the time being,
of the Australian Commonwealth is to have £2OOO
or less. In the long run, the public will only get
what it pays for.
Monsignor Kelly, of Rome, the new R.C.
Coadjutor-Archbishop of Sydney, whose coming
or not coming is still uncertain, is at all events
fairly sound on the subject of Drink. In his
essay upon the question, reported in the Catholic
Record, he says:—
Wine and strong drink are to be reckoned among the
gifts of Divine Providence, of which all, without excep-
tion, are intended for man’s use and benefit. . . Wine
and strong drink are not given for strength, but only to
cheer and comfort the heart. They are not profitable for
frequent and abundant food, as bread is.
This nearly coincides with the views of philo-
sopher Dooley. “Whisky ain’t food,” says Mr.
Dooley ; “ I think betther of it than that.”
“ Smiler ” Hales, having apparently ex-
hausted his war material, starts to fill ’em up at
’Ome with alleged autobiography designed to snow
the stirring times one can drop on in the
Australian wilds. Hales doesn’t romance right
out; he just gives them autobiography with frills.
His most wildly-improbable looking yarn—he is
telling them in the Daily News— is how, as a
mining reporter, he twice bluffed the manager
of the Golden Nugget. And yet there is more
truth in that one than in most. It was at the
Broken Hill Junction that he did pretty well all
he describes —first, with another reporter, creeping
down a shaft at night, in his own ordinary out-
ward semblance, and again getting into.the mine
disguised as a colored pugilist. What he found
out was worth finding out, too; for some Broken
Hill mines were very queerly managed in those
days.

Gov. General Hopetoun left a bitter
miners’ strike behind him on his estate in
Scotland. The origin of the strike is the
old one, familiar to our Newcastle and other
miners, although the Hopetoun properties are
lead mines. There was an “understanding”
between masters and men that when lead went up
in price wages would go up, and vice versa. Of
course when lead went down wages dittoed, but
three years ago lead rose, and then the masters
kicked. Lord Hopetoun is in it to this extent:
he leased a portion of his estate, all of which has
lead deposits, to the present masters. When the
men went out on strike they applied to him for a
lease for another portion, but this he refused to
grant. The men had therefore to take themselves
and their families off to a neighboring town.
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s allegedly great
jumping feat at Blue Lake, Mt. Gambier, was
never accounted great by those who were present.
S’.A. Sheriff Boothby relates that the jumping
was done when a Circuit party was returning
from a kangaroo-hunt, and no notice was taken,of
it at the time. A much better feat of Gordon’s
was performed at about the same time, relates
Boothby. Biding a horse at a fast rate, Gordon
carried a bucket of water in one hand and took a
fence with ease, without spilling a drop.

1 Beilby ” : The Australian bush holds
some of the strangest creatures on the face of the
earth. Travelling once with a small mob of rams
I put up for the night at a selector’s house, and,
while sitting on the verandah with my host, there
walked up a man with a wrecked life written on
every line of his sad-looking face, and dressed in
dirty old moles and a ragged flannel shirt. Ad-
dressing the selector in the accents of a well-
educated inan, he said: “Touching what you
Were saying, Tom, you were quite wrong. I can
produce absolute proof, and allow me to add that
you are a counterfeit.” Whereupon, to my aston-
ishment, Tom jumped up and knocked him down.
Then the door of the house flew open, and a dirty -
looking woman came flying out, and dancing
round the fallen man exclaimed, “Tom, Tom—
you’ve killed him—you’ve killed ’im, and we’ll all
be ’ung.” Tom, without saying a word, got a
bucket of water, poured it over the man’s
head, and resumed his seat, while the woman
went back into the house. After about five
minutes the fallen arose. “ What on earth does
all this mean ?” I asked then. “Oh, it’s alles ’is
way, ’e does it some times two or three times in a
week, and I ain’t goin’ to be called a counterfeit
by no man. If he called me any other name I

you tell him so.” “So I ’ave, ’undreds of times,
but it’s no good. ’E allers does it, and I knocks
’im over every time.” “And does your wife
take on like that each time.” “Oh, yes, she
generally says much about the same thing.” We
went in to supper, and as soon as we sat down the
“ counterfeit” man came in, sat down, and bolted
everything that was given him, until finding that
there was no more to come, he got up and went
away, not having spoken a single word. Who he
was, and why he was there, I never heard and
never asked, but several times next day I nearly
fell off my horse laughing. Just think of that
selector quietly waiting each time for the mystic
word counterfeit, and then instantly downing the
other ! And fancy the latter continuing to use
the word, knowing that he would be promptly

“Trotter”: Waybaclc from , on a
deserted tin-field, I came across a mixture of
Rougemont and Brigham Young. He lived in a
slab o’ bark hut, with a number of lubras in the
vicinity. The only costume I ever saw him in
was a dirty towel tied round his waist. He showed
me the claims, had meals, and went about
generally in that costume. He had two claims —
yielding from £7 to £lO per week when water was
plentiful, and two large selections ; kept a kind of a
store, and at times did packing to a further-out
field. He had thus lived for 15 years. The nigs,
looked upon him as a king, and his dusky loves—
who seemed to be on “tribute” —cooked his
tucker. The recluse, by the way. was a J.P.

“H.S.” : Re that Victorian half-caste (B.
29/9/’9O) who had six fingers on each hand. Writer
once saw a native girl with but four toes on each
foot, and Dr. Helms records the case of a woman
of the Fraser Range tribe who had six perfect
fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.
“ Not only were these limbs perfectly formed,
but the corresponding metacarpal and metatarsal
bones were also perfect. Two of her brothers and
a sister had, I am told, the same deformity.”
The occurrence of an extra digit in hand or foot is
well-known to medical men as occasional amongst
whites—a peculiar feature of the case being that
it often reappears after a generation or two of
normality.
“ P.” : Nothing surprising about that six-
fingered half-caste recently mentioned in Tub
Bulletin. Polydactylism, as it is called, is a
well enough known phenomenon, and has
quite a literature of its own. The Chaldeans,
among other ancient civilised races, looked on it
as a sign of wisdom, more especially in cases of
“double-hand,” (two hands on same arms). One
historical case (Amsterdam, 17th century) had
seven digits on each hand, eight on the right foot
and nine on the left. In Paris, in 1687, was an in-
fant with 10 digits on each extremity—4o in all.
Annandale, of Edinburgh, saw a woman with six
fingers and two thumbs on each hand, and another
wifli eight toes on one foot. Most practising
medicos meet now and then with instances of the
kind. The tendency seems to be hereditary, a
Berlin family having 24 digits per member for
several generations. Izeaux, an isolated French vil-
lage, wasentirelyinhabited bypolydactylous people
up to 1847, after which, apparently through outside
“crosses,” the peculiarity gradually disappeared.
An Arabian tribe (the Foldis) are in the habit of
intermarrying very closely, and all have 24 digits
—in fact, children born with the normal number
are killed as being the result of adultery. Poly-
dactylism, again, is commoner with the Cingalese
than with any other race; and as close inter-
breeding is also prevalent amongst them, there
are grounds for attributing the peculiarity to this
cause. The phenomenon is really an atavistic
harking-back to the seven or more rays of the
paddles of some marine ancestor, and Weissman
has proved that six digits are potentially present
in the human embryo at an early stage of develop-
ment.

Ed. B., —Much sheer ignorance has been
vented on “ fire-lighting by friction.” When will
people who only know Southern Australia realise
that Northern Australia is a country they know
nothing about ? Dozens of tribes in the triangle
pointed by Cloncurry, Port Darwin, and Cape
York, carry fire-making implements—usually a
pointed hardwood stick, and softer wood socket,
and shred-bark tinder. Twirling the stick in the
socket, they will give you fire in 3min. to smin.
A black-boy I travelled with near Herberton,
N.Q., could make a light in, say, 2min. every
time he tried —as quickly, anyway, as I could
unbutton a saddle-pouch leisurely, get out
matches, and strike one.—S.

Dear Bulletin, — Re friction-fire-produc-

long ; split in two; make cut across convex side
and just through the bamboo ; lay along log, and
one man holds in position. Take another piece of
dead bamboo about Ift. long and lin. wide ; hold
at each end, press hard, and rub with short and
rapid strokes on edge in groove of first piece.
Under this groove is packed a ball of tinder.
After a couple of minutes’ violent rubbing smoke
is seen, and presently the tinder is snatched out,
held between the palms and blown into a glow,
when splinters of drj wood do the rest. —Lagi

“ Tom Collins ” ; Re fire-raising. Must
congratulate Harry Stockdale (5/l/’01) on the
Eden-innocence which regards simple illustrations
from thermodynamics as “ quasi-scientific talk.”
But the higher ranges of temperature are properly
indicated by the melting-point of metals and alloys,
up to the Tophet-like record of 4532 deg. Fah.,
which marks the fusion of osmium. And the heat
required for ignition of dry pine—a most in-
flammable material — was more simply expressed
by the melting-point of a given alloy than by
pyrometrical register. Also, if H.S. had met
with my par a few hours earlier in the day, he
could never have read into its modest protest
against Munchausenism, an allegation of “im-
possibility ” concerning a process admittedly
effected by all primitive races. Chemical com-
bination and mechanical force are the only known
methods of fire-production—radiation by lenses,
concave mirrors, &c., being merely the capture
and concentration of existent heat—confined,
in this instance to mechanical force. Being
further compelled to eliminate percussion, we are
narrowed down to the thermal equivalent of fric-
tion proper. Now it requires violent attrition to
heat wood to 212 deg. Fah. (boiling-point of
water); and it is a far cry from this to the actual
ignition of any simple vegetable substance. Yet
no one doubts that H.S. has himself accomplished
the feat. His present attitude, however, com-
mits him to the task of describing the process,
and his former contributions to these columns
prove him capable of doing so with a lucidity and
minuteness which will facilitate practical verifica-
tion by the curious. Primitive weapons, tools,
&c., are easily preserved, but primitive methods
of fire-raising, if not authoritatively depicted,
will soon rest only on the testimony of men who
know all about everything in a large, indefinite
way.

CHRISTIAN DE WET, the Boer leader—from a recent photo.
found in a box he hurriedly left behind him.
Baronet Newnes’s Tit-Bits of Sept. 1
says that—
“ The most primitive tribe of people in the British
Empire are the bushmen of Australia, some of whom are
so primitive that they do not build even the simplest
forms of huts for shelter. They gather a lot of twigs and
grass, and, taking them into a thicket or jungle, they
build a nest for a home, much as does a bird. The nest
is usually built large enough for the family, and if the
latter be very numerous, then the nests are a very large
size. Into this place they all turn and snuggle aiid curl
together like kittens. Sometimes the foliage will grow
together and form a sort of natural covering, but there
never is any attempt at constructing a protection from
the rain and storms, and it is a marvel how they endure
them. Sometimes, in a good piece of jungle, hundreds of
these nest-homes are found together.”
These, of course, are the Australian bushmen who
have lately been fighting in S’Africa. A number
of them, when they returned to Sydney the other
day, found that their absence on a patriotic mis-
sion had been cruelly taken advantage of, several
members of the Ministry of the day having turned
out the bushmen’s families and taken possession
of their nests.

“Wallaroo”: How’s this for juvenile
philosophy ! A four-year-old girl visiting at a
strange selection got lost in one of the wildest
spots in N.S.W. A distracted all-night search
failed to find her, and a great gloom was over all
till the missing babe turned up “on her own,”
with a voracious appetite and none the worse for
her 14 hours outing. Had walked about till dark,
she said, and had then gone to sleep. In the
morning she had fallen in with a flock of home-
ward-bound sheep, in the rear of which she
serenely trudged along till she sighted the house.
Two travelling shear-
ers struck a Yic. bush

the ladies present, laid
his mate £2 to £1 that he
would get more dances
than any other man in
the room out of “that
pretty, stuck-up-lookin’
little teacher.” The bet
was taken, and so well
did No. 1 progress in the
lady’s favor that No. 2,
getting anxious about his
money, suddenly called
out —“Oh, I say, Jack!
there’s a chap just
passed with your swag
and billy. He’s been
down to your .camp and
collared your things.
He’s even got away with
your old pair of moles
with the dungaree
patches on the knees.”
Then the proud little
schoolmistress froze solid,
and another admirer got
most of the rest of the
dances. She hadn’t sus-
pected her gaudy ad-
mirer of camping on a
river-bend with a billy.

and thoughtful pause,
and then one solitary
questioner inquired: “Is
the candidate aware that
ho left his swag on the
pub. verandah, and that
a dirty dog’s sitting on
it?” There was an un-
healthy-looking swag outside the pub. with a dog-
on it, and nobody could be persuaded thereafter
that it wasn’t the candidate’s property.

Somebody cables that that copious self-
advertiser, Meteorologist Wragge, has visited
Styria, and discovered that the vine-growers there
fire cannon to dissipate hailstorms. And Wragge
is of opinion that by adopting this method in
Queensland “thousands of pounds” would be
saved. But Queensland is a large place which
would require about 400,000 cannon, and hail-
storms are not very frequent there, and pro-
bably, if all the damage they do was averted,
the saving wouldn’t pay interest on the cost of
the cannon. The idea of Wragge roaming at
Queensland’s expense through the damp regions
of Europe trying to find means-of averting any
kind of moisture, when Queensland’s great trouble
is that much of the country hasn’t seen anything
even so wet as a hailstorm for three years, seems
like importing fur overcoats to Cooktown.

SCHWEPPE’S DERATED
SARSAPARILLA
A plausible gentleman visited Shepparton (Vic.)
lately and gathered many local assets. His plan
had the simplicity of genius. Posing as a “Pari-
sian Healer,” he lectured in the open air, drew
teeth, and sold alleged remedies for nearly every
known disease. When this began to pall he
announced that he had wagered he could get the
local nobility and gentry to trust him with certain
sums as a mark of their confidence. The sublime
impudence of the scheme so paralysed the cow-
raising inhabitants that 13 of them actually trusted
him with £1 each, without any promise to repay,
but on his sole assurance that on the Tuesday fol-
lowing they would find themselves “ well-treated.”
Also he assured them ‘ ‘ they would not forget
him.” A certain vanished healer is the best-re-
membered man in these parts just now.

Apropos fish dying through being forced
into shallow and therefore warm water in fiery
drought-time (8., 5/l/’01). This often occurs in
the lakes and billabongs fed by the Darling. As
the water in these flat basins slowly flows out, or
is lost through the fearful evaporation of a windy
summer, the fish, mainly cod, become red—
actually sunburnt. The lower the water gets the
more mineralised it is, of course, and so the last
of the fish die some time before the last of the
water disappears.

It isn’t often
that a lady swears
at her wedding,
but such an inci-
dent is authenti-
cally reported
from a W.A. town.
A miner had been
engaged to the
first girl, but as is
the manner of man,
abandoned her for
the second girl.
Consequently the
first girl set about
inquiring into the
second girl’s an-
tecedents, and
among the shifting
population of the
west a great many
strange things can
be disco /ered by
careful inquiry.

gold days the aver-
age miner got
married almost
e ery time he went
to Melbourne, and
though people
don’t get married
quite so frequently
in W.A., tney do
it often enough.
At all events a sus-
picion arose that
the bride had a husuand still living, and the clergy-
man was informed. He asked her if she was
already married and she said she wasn’t. Then
he suggested that she should sign a declaration to
that effect and she consented freely. But when
it was explained to her that the penalty of making
a false declaration was five years’ penal servitude,
she simply said “ Damn ! ” and ran swiftly out of
the holy edifice. It was a great, heart-felt curse,
and brown paper had to be burned to get the
flavor of it out of the building before next Sunday.

“P.H.C.”: Re snake-swallowing per-
formances. At a farm on Five-day Creek, Upper
Maeleay River (N.S.W.), I was awakened one
night by noises from the poultry-yard, and next
morning found mine host grumpy because of the
o /er-night disappearance of three special chickens
from under a hen that had been carefully housed
for safety. Later on I found part of a snake pro-
truding from a hollow log, and investigation re-
vealed a black snake half-swallowed by a carpet
snake. Inside the black snake were the three
chickens. Thus the log swallowed the carpet
snake that swallowed the black snake that swal-
lowed the chicks ; and now Bulletin readers are
asked to swallow the lot. Solemn fact, neverthe-
less. Again : —Driving on Dungog common I

narrator struck a pit, in which were 20 rabbits, a
large iguana, and a black swan. The iguana had
evidently been gorging himself on the rodents,
but was unequal to a battle with the swan, and
the two lay in opposite corners of the pit, glaring
and hissing at each other.

A sign of the times in the far west. A
special messenger with a telegram lately reached
a two-million acre station late at night and, next
morning when being paid, had 4s. bd. deducted
for horse-feed. However, they didn’t charge him
for his bed !

“P.H.L.”: Up Monaro way it isn’t un-
common to see skeletons of cattle stuck in the
branches of trees. During “big snow” the
beasts perished in drifts formed m gullies, and
the snow melting from under the carcases left
them suspended in the trees.
According to Sydney naturalist Bray, the
how current N.S.W. snake-season (Oct. to March)
has, up to date, furnished a greater number of
fatal cases of snakebite than any previous season
during the last 20 years. Weather conditions, it
is supposed, have been specially conducive to
ophidian vigor.

THE SOLEMN TRUTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
thousand times we've told the woes
Of that good mission-man who goes
Where still the heathen reigns
To turn the savage from the ivrath,
And then, as hash, or stew, or broth,
Is sivalloived for his pains.
But if the pious tract we spurn,
And turn our minds, and look and learn,
We knoiv the Word’s unbeaten.
The missioners nor spin nor toil,
But fatter grow, and grab the soil —
The cannibals get eaten !
S.S.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Martin, the most doughty of cjTcltsts, was born
in Dublin, of Irish parents, and went to America
when three years old.
‘ ‘ Sleep !—that’s my secret; that, and condition.
I get very tired and cross if I don’t get my sleep.
I can do 10 or 12 hours a night easy. Last night
Forbes came home at 12 and woke me up, and this
morning I feel off a bit. My long training, too,
is touching my digestion, and it takes very little
now to make me cross.
“One of the hardest races I’ve had was in ’9B in
America against Harry Elkes, 50 miles. I had
quints and quads and sextuplets ; stacks of ’em ;
49 pace-makers ; and a tub of oatmeal-water with
a bit of ice in it, Elkes gave me an awful shake
for the first two miles; he cut out the second mile
in 1.36 2-5, and punished himself so badly that he
was pretty near dead at the end of it; while I
had just enough left to recover and beat him by
two miles. Afterwards his backers said that he
was sick before he started, but a man can’t be
very sick to cut out a mile in 1.36 2-5. When I
was training for Elkes I went to bed every night
at 8 o’clock, and never got up before 7, including
Sundays.
“I never tell my age. I couldn’t get married if
I told my age. I’m not going to be married —I
mean, I have no one in my eye, and no girl’s
asked me. That’s hard luck, isn’t it ?or it may be
good luck. Not that I don’t like people who wear
frocks, but I’m doing pretty well as I am. I was
always bashful, and I don’t dare ask the girls, for
fear they’ll refuse.
“ I didn’t think I’d last this long at cycling. I
expect to crack up at any time now ; I’m that old.
The game’s taking hold of me. I don’t ride now ;
I struggle along. I can’t ride myself out as I
used to do. It’s a heavy drag on me. I started
19 years ago foot-running and cycling, in America.
I stayed out West three-and-a-half years beating
fellows in the country picnics, police sports, Cale-
donian sports, and things of that kind, and I
didn’t know how well I could foot-run at that
time, so I wasted near four years there, instead
of going East, making money. It’s 10
years ago since I won the 100-Miles
Cycling Championship of the World in
America —they had two champions from England,
one from Scotland, O’Flanagan from Ireland, a
Swiss, a German, and others. And they’ve all
dropped out now—all on the shelf. Last year
(1900) my performances were : —62 firsts, 13
seconds, 3 thirds, and £437 in prizes. I don’t bet
much. One fellow put 25 quid on me in the Five
Mile Scratch Race, Monday night. I tried to pull
it off for him, but I couldn’t, although the Lyne
Race earlier in the evening was one of the easiest
I ever had.
“My weight varies. At the end of my three
months’ holiday last winter I weighed 13.12 in my
clothes. Then I went into training, and a week
before the Austral I weighed 11.2 in my clothes.
I struck top perfection of form the first day of the
Austral, when I rode 8 firsts and 1 third. Ten
years ago I got down to 136Jlbs. stripped, but I
never got so low again till this last Austral.
When I rode in the six days’ go-as-you-please I
gained 201 b. in weight during the race. I had
something every half-hour—a drink, something to
chew on, raisins, crackers, a little bit of meat, a
little bit of chicken.
“A great deal has been said about my ‘ points ’
in Australia. The cycling officials here imagined
I did a lot of things that I never did. Of course,
the officials, now, have got to know the game, but
when I came here first they did not know enough
to blow up their tires, and they used to ask me a
lot of idiotic questions. Since I’ve been in Aus-
tralia I’ve been run into iron fences and iron rails;
I’ve been knocked clean off the track and had my
head buried in street-sweepings ; I’ve had my
spokes torn out and my pedals shifted ; I’ve been
upset right in front of the judge’s stand ; I’ve been
run over and had six gashes in my head from
fellows’ pedals; I’ve had them charge into me,
and had my muscles torn away and my back
broken ; but, all the same, I like this country,
and I’m fixed here now, and I’ll never leave here
unless I’ve to walk out.
‘‘ Girls ! Any cyclist who looks at girls loses his
sprint. Even a little of the worry of love is too
much for a rider, because it takes that bit extra off
him that wins. There was one Australian cyclist
who, if he kept away from the girls for a few
weeks, used to ride like the devil. But the
last time he won- a bit of money, he brought
two girls in a cab to my hotel. One of the girls
reached and grabbed my hat —I ran for my life.
I never felt so cheap—this girl after me and all
the hotel people watching. As I ran in I said to
the porter—‘ Keep those people out and get my
hat.’ Wo I escaped them. It’s the lady with the
grab that beats a lot of cyclists in racing. A year
ago last Austral they put a girl on to one Amry
promising man Avith very bad results. It seemed
to stop him altogether; and he’s never ridden
Avell since. Yes, it Avas done purposely, in order
to stop that man Avinning. There’s another pro-
mising cyclist over there this meeting—his girl
took 15s. out of every £1 he made last year; and
now that he’s got the chance of winning some
money, I see she’s after him again. There’s one
Southerner Avho’d be a great champion, but he’s too
handsome—the girls will never let him win. I’ve
seen it over and over again—the great trouble of
the young cyclist is the number of girls Avho fall in
love witli him.
“ The day after the first day of last Austral, an
old man like me, received a dozen letters from
girls, asking me to advertise in Aegus where I’d
meet them. But I hadn’t time. Bicycling is my
business; and if I Avent went into the love-racket
I’d come doAvn to selling handkerchiefs, of rabbit-
oh ! bottle-oh !
“In the States I had a chance to marry a girl
Avith 300,000 dollars. I didn’t. If she came at me-
now, I guess I’d go under. I was very young
then; although when I rode in the six days go-as-
you-please, a neAvspaper spread the yam that I
had a wife and ten children. Nobody must
conclude from my remarks that I am a hard man
—I haven’t had time to meet the nice girl—it’s
MARTIN, the American Cyclist, Up-to-date.

lack of opportunity that’s stopped me sharing
half my bank-book with anybody I fell really in
love with.
I went into my hotel on the 20th of last month,
and I’m going to conduct that place on strict
business lines. I am doing very well there;
getting everybody to attend strictly to business
in a business way. Mine is a free house—one
brewery wanted to loan me £3OO. I thanked
them, but said I wouldn’t require it.
I’ve had a few experiences in Australia. When
I went round to see the Cribb-Dunn fight they
bustled me when I was getting my ticket, and
the pickpockets took £26 out of my pocket, and
got away with it. And I had a queerish experi-
ence with an Australian swagman. I was out
tandem on the shores of Hobson’s Bay when I
came across him, and I thought I’d take
a photo, of him to send to my people in
America. He had a dog, a billy, a swag and a
gun, and he sat quiet in the sun while I took off
my things and went out into the water to snap
him face-on. I didn’t know it then, but I found
out afterwards that this man was wanted—he was
a man who bred dogs and sold ’em and stole ’em,
and when he saw the camera on him he got fright-
ened —he thought I belonged to the detective
force sure—so he reached round for his gun, and
as I had only my hat on I dived and swam under
water as far as I could. And when I came up I
got like a rabbit through the fence and up to the
tandem where my mate was waiting. And we
didn’t wait for that man to fire the gun before we
jumped her. And we went down that piece of
road with our hair on end, and the sparks
flying as our pedals struck the stones.
There was a tricky turn half a mile along,
and when we got to that I called to my mate,
‘Lean over’ —he was a newspaper man, I forgot
to tell you—‘Lean right over ; if you come down
you’ll break your right hand up, and then you
won’t be able to roast me in to-morrow’s paper.’ Of
course it was a bit selfish of me to put it in that
way—because I was thinking of my own right
hand, too—it’s the hand 1 protest with, it’s the
hand I frightened the officials with at Adelaide,
it’s the hand I’ll draw the beer with in my hotel,
it’s the hand that takes the money and puts the
money in the bank, and it’s the hand I hope to
some day offer to some nice Australian girl in
matrimony.
“If I ride well, I’ll race another year. I must
have another go to win an Austral. And if the
boys put me down, I can always say this to them :
‘Now, boys, you have beaten an old man and a
cripple. I’ve got a leg an inch short. You young
fellows must not take credit to yourselves when
you put me under. And when you do beat me
out I shall settle down in my hotel and get mar-
ried, and become the father of a large family of
Australian cyclists, whom I shall try to make cham-
pions of the United States of Australia.”
S. A. MILLS.
The Duke of York will be 36 on June 3rd.
Results of Prof. Storr’s careful investiga-
tions and measurements of the features of over 5000
children of Pennsylvania Dutch parentage go to
strongly support the theory that racial differences
are due to physical and climatic conditions merely,
and that all Americans are at present converging
to the Indian type. So the Australian Premier
or President of 800 or 1000 years hence may be
expected to closely resemble King Billv. of
Boonurrong.


TEMPTATION.
“While giving to our neighbors in Sydney every credit for the magnificent demonstration with which they have marked the inauguration of t he Commonwealth, we are entitled
to believe that there are some matters in which Melbourne may hope to excel the pageant which the sister capital presented. —Melb. Argus.
MELBOURNE (dreamily) : “O, musn’t Sydney have had a lovely time celebrating the Inauguration of the Commonwealth!
DEMON OF GROVEL ( her familiar spirit ): “Commonwealth ! Bah! That’s all past. You just make up your mind to go frantic over the dear Duke and Duchess. Think of the
joy of entertaining Royalty!”


Tocumwal Thursday. —A serious disturbance
took place "to-day at M'Crabb’s Murray Bridge
Hotel which ended in a constable using his iev
fer The ruffians dared the constable to touch
them and became so offensive that he drew
revolver and fired at their feet, wljereupon
men made off into the scrub. • ,
The police would seem to regard the foot as the
vital part of man, and their private target-prac-
tice is said to be based upon that theory,
firing at a policeman’s boot sittm„, s
speak, and that of a rough on the wing, as it
were, are two different things.

An ancient land-mark at Milson’s Point,
North Sydney, was blown down in a gale on New
Year’s Eve. This was a fig-tree which, it is be-
lieved, was over 100 years old. The oldest
inhabitant remembers it as full-grown when over
CO years ago he climbed into its branches. To
protect it a wall was, some years ago, built around
it and cemented, but the aged fig had lived its
time.
Last season S.A. farmers paid (or owed)
£135,000 for 26,250 tons of artificial manures, 95
per cent, of which were phosphates. This season
they will use more. The province’s agricultural
professor is only a recent convert to artificial
manuring for cereals. Local manufacture of the
manures has been tried, but in most cases so
clumsily that the departmental reports are
adverse.

POLITICAL
POINTS
£14,900 public money was spuut in Queens-
land last year in placating various people, most of
whom were getting very recalcitrant indeed.
This amount is humorously termed “Royal Com-
mission Expenses/’
Why call the Commonwealth capital after
Wentworth—the man who sought to establish
an Australian hereditary peerage ? There is
one glove-fitting name for the Commonwealth
capital and that is “ Cromwell.”
The South Australian Register knocked
out the “ South Australian ” on Australian Com-
monwealth Day to make room for—the Emu and
Kangaroo, of course ? Hardly. Eor the Lion
and Unicorn, the brand of subjection.
Victoria has already raised 12 candidates
for its six senatorial seats, and there are three
among them (Styles, ex-M.L.A. ; Watt, also ex-
M.L.A., and Best, M.L.A.) whom the State
could put into the Upper House w fch some credit
to itself. The rest consist maim/ of Duffy, the
lamentable humorist, who made Vic. Postal
Department a source of innocent merriment, a
gang of dreadful fossils from the House of 43 Rich
Landlords, and J. P. T. Caulfield, the drink cure
gentleman with the clean shave.
A FATAL OBJECT TON.
LACEY : “ There you are, Alike, constant job,
good pay; just suit you, old man.”
MIKE: “ Th' divil it will. Oi'm not taakin'
anny job where Oi cAN'T SPHIT ON ME
HANDS."
Twelve thousand a year for the Federal
Cabinet of seven members. That will probably
mean £2OOO for the Premier, and equal division of
the balance among the rest of the Cabinet. The
State Cabinet salaries are mean ; those of the
Federal Cabinet are even meaner.
N.S.W. Attorney-General B. It. Wise
must be puzzled as to where he comes in in the
distribution of Federal offices. Can he knuckle
under to Reid? Can he collogue with Lyne?
Can he associate with the Protectionist Barton?
Will the electors take him at any price ?
It is a squint-eyed arrangement which
makes N.S.W., as a State, foot the bill for the ex-
penses of the Commonwealth inauguration festivi-
ties, and prevents Victoria, as a State, from acting
similarly when York opens the Commonwealth
Parliament in Melbourne. Vic. debits the ex-
penses to the Commonwealth.
At Hobart G. H. Reid again repeated,
apropos of “coddling” industries by Protection,
that “ a dog would never learn to swim if he were
never put into the water. ” Which is all wrong,
for no dog ever “ learns ” to swim : it is as natural
for a dog to swim as it is for G. H. Read to fake
figures. Also G. H. Reid’s Dog is still Dry.
After all, Mary Jane Gould has been
egged-on to oppose Barton for the Hunter. Mary
Jane’s supporters argue that you never can
tell what will be done by a region portions of
which have returned such people as Gould and
Brunker. Also, Barton was once beaten by
hatter Storey—almost as ridiculous a political
figure as Gould.
When the Federal Govt, tackles the Alien
Immigration Restriction question, it will also
have to absolutely stop the importation of labor
under contract, as in America. In addition to
the Afghan camel-drivers and Syrian and Indian
hawkers, many of the Greek and Italian fruiterers
import boys and older assistants under bond, all
at much lower wages than the ruling rates here.
Lvne has not yet had time to consider the
appointments to the Sydney Harbor Trust. He
was in such a desperate hurry four months ago
that Parliament sat day and night to create the
Trust. The harassed man will, no doubt, make
the announcements when he decides to vacate the
State Premiership, which will be almost at once.
His successor can then take on the job of ex-
plaining things to the disappointed ones.
A gloomy - looking start for the first
Federal Ministry is the death, from diabetes, of
one of its members, J. R. Dickson, Minister for
Defence, which, as matters stand, means Offence.
But let people take comfort from the omen—which
may be that Australia will not for ever go on
cottoning to Imperial aggression. Also, when
you come to consider the dead politician’s history,
his decease may portend something nasty to the
cause of Black Labor in the North.
Little Dr. Maloney has an excellent
chance of winning the Melbourne seat for the
House of Representatives. S’malkum M'Eacharn
reckoned himself a certainty, but since the doctor
has come into the field he is verra nervous. He
finds that his popularity only lasted as long as he
was spending money as Mayor, and is now, like
the champagne he provided, gone; whereas
Maloney’s popularity is personal, widespread, and
based upon a long record of earnest public work
and generous conduct towards the weak and the
poor. If Findlay could win the Melbourne seat
for the Labor party at the State election, it ought
to be comparatively easy for Maloney to win the
Federal seat, as the Melbourne constituency for
the Federal Parliament will include slices of
several thoroughly democratic electorates.
That quaintly inaccurate paper, Launceston
(Tas) Examinee (18/12/’00):
The mother country had built up her industries
under a Freetrade system.
Possibly they don’t know any better in Tasmania,
but as a matter of fact the mother country
did nothing of the kind. Mulhall, on pages
365 and 765 of his “Dictionary of Statis-
tics,” gives some interesting information
on this point. In 1840 Britain was
still a rigidly Protectionist country, and
it produced over 29 per cent, of all the
world’s manufactured goods. It was
the boss manufacturer of the globe,
and its industries were built up under
Protection. In 1888 it was a Freetrade
country, and it produced less than 18
per cent, of the world’s manufactures.
In 1896 it had enjoyed another eight
years of Freetrade, and it produced only
15£ per cent, of the world’s manu-
factures. Britain’s industries increased
rapidly under Freetrade, but those of
the Protectionist outer world grew far faster,
and Britain was miserably left.
Brigadier-Gen. Gordon, <>f S.A., very
much desires to command the new contingent for
the Transvaal, but Premier Holder objects to his
leaving S.A. unprotected. Gordon has pro-
pounded a scheme for the Commonwealth under
which every youth between 18 and 21 will be ex-
pected to put in military service in return for free
uniform, arms and ammunition, and £lO a year
each. That would cost about £1,000,000, but such
trifles do not trouble the military gang.
G. H Reid’s peroration at Sydney Federa-
tion banquet
It was the glory of an Empire that the Queen was as
good a subject and as loyal to the Democrat.c principles
of the Constitution as the greatest Democrat of the most
Radi cal comm un i ty.
Assuming N.S.W. to be the most Radical com-
munity (in its sposm of Jingoistic Imperial
fever), and assumir > Reid, with his ever-mutable
chameleon garb, .o be the greatest Democrat
aforesaid, this statement is absolutely irrefutable.
Sydney D.T. tries to estrange the Tas-
manian vote from the Barton Govt, by (amongst
other things) publishing with sweet approval let-
ters remarking that considering that the Federal
Prime Minister represented N.S.W., the other
N.S.W. representative might have stood aside in
favor of Tasmania. (By the way, N.S.W.’s second
representative is a Tasmanian.) But supposing
Barton had given N.S.W. and Tasmania equal
representation in the Cabinet, what would the
D.T. party have said ? Any stick to beat a dog
with !
Kingston’s friends in S.A.—and they
are legion, for he was prominent in cricket
and football ere he took to politics—are deter-
mined to show Premier Barton that he has
chosen the right man fron. that State by putting
“ Charlie,” as he is affectionately called, away up
at the top of the poll. From the mammoth Early
Closing demonstration on the first Saturday on
which the Act operated a special telegram of
thanks was despatched to Kingston for his work
on behalf of the cause, and that feeling alone is
worth thousands of votes on polling day.
The latest political job is the appointment
of Hon. J. Blanksby, M.L.C., as secretary to the
Board under N.S.W. Miners’ Accident Relief Act,
passed last session by Mines Minister Fcgan.
This is another gift to an opponent on the part of
the Lyne Govt., as Blanksby was a Newcastle
IN TOPHET.
OVERSEERIUS : “ What the devil’s wrong here?”
LOPPIUS : “ This man from Mumindi is so
sodden with beer he won’t burn.”
man appointed comparatively recently by Reid
to the Upper House. The appointment is a dis-
tinct breach of N.S.W. Public Service Act, which
provides for advertising the billet, mode of appli-
cation, etc. The secretary to the Miners’ Accident
Board is as much a public servant as any secretary
of the other multifarious Boards and Commissions
created by various Acts.
How public opinion is manufactured in

PANY, LTD.

pose as a separate and independent organ of
public opinion, and the one great syndicate runs
them all.
“Ontario” on the great religious-pre-
cedence squabble:—
The precedency question, if meriting serious treatment,
cannot be settled from the Chamberlain side ; it must be
settled by the Commonwealth and by the sense of the
Commonwealth. Religious equality must be maintained
as the corner-stone of the structure, and old-world
customs or traditions must be brushed aside if they
divert, or tend to divert, attention from this first prin-
ciple. To the Commonwealth, the Churches are mere
aggregations of persons holding particular views, and
where one man has one vote, each collection must have
only the influence of its collective vote. The Church of
England, being numerically strongest, goes, there-
fore, on this principle, to the front. The R.C. Church
goes next ; and so on, if all are rivals in the foolish-
ness. Chamberlain's solution was no solution. It was
only the temporary pacifying of whimpering dogs. If a
Cardinal, a successor to Card. Moran, arrived in Sydney
to-morrow, he could claim precedence over the senior in
appointment, the Anglican Primate. It is in the fact that
a Cardinal claims to be also a Prince that the pith of the
matter lies. In the days when the Pope was King,
Cardinals were Princes. The Pope was then a temporal
ruler ; he could make Princes as the Kaiser makes them
now. But th ■ Pope being no longer a King cannot create
a Prince. Therefore a Cardinal is now merely a church
dignitary. Except as he represents numbers he carries
no more significance in the eyes of the Commonwealth
than does a Moderator or Chief Rabbi.
Democratic England ! Writes Syd-
ney D.T.’s London correspondent :
You cannot be a candidate for nothin;; in
London. Sam Woods, the Labor M.P. for Wal-
thamstow, had to find £360 for “ returning-offi-
cer’s expenses” alone before he had a legal
right to go to the poll. What would N.S.W.
Labor-members say to an electoral handicap
of that kind ? A general election in the three
kingdoms costs two millions. And, then, no
salary when you get in, and no pity when you
don’t ! No wonder that there are but 13 Labor-
members in the new House of Commons, two of
whom sit for Irish seats ! Only 13 Labor men,
against 23 brewers and distillers; only two
tenant-farmers from all England, Scotland, and
Wales, against over 60 landlords ! Officers of the
army arid navy number 64, and barristers and
solicitors 140.
Sydney Daily Telegraph item :
Despite the frequent shrieks of delight at the
power of Victoria to raise enough coal for home
consumption, and the coddling of that industry
by bonuses and ridiculously low railway freights,
Melbourne finds itself on the verge of a coal
famine. This is all brought about by the rather
lengthy pit holidays at Newcastle, the local sup-
ply being a mere morsel of the huge quantity
required to keep everything going. This and
other circumstances have combined to raise the
price of coal from 50 to 100 per cent.
Now who would dream, on reading this
fine robust howl, that the only “ coddling
by bonuses and ridiculously low railway
freights ” that Victoria indulged in con-
sisted in the fact that it reduced the rail-
way freights on local coal to exactly the
same rate as is charged in N.S. W. '/ The
D.T. is a fine source of misinformation.
During the Federal campaign it came out
with a bitter curse about the iniquity of
the Victorian coal duty—a duty that
never existed save in the D.T.’s imagi-
nation—and it is generally chasing
some equally foolish jim-jam or other in
the Freetrade interest.
The Cloncurry railway grab is to
bob up again next Q. State sessions, under
new management.
When Rockhamptont
and Townsville quarrelled
over the railway extension to-
Winton, the Townsville peo-
ple urged that it was unjust
to extend the Central line to
Winton, inasmuch as that
would compel the residents-
to pay some hundreds of
miles extra carriage as com-
pared with what they would
have to pay on the Towns-
ville-Winton route. Now the
Rockhampton people want a
Western extension, and are
told they would compete un-
duly with Brisbane for the
trade of such places as Jun-
dah. But, Rockhampton
logically urges, our route
would save many of these
Western towns 150 miles of
carriage as compared with
the Brisbane route. Bris-
bane has no answer to this,
but damns the Western ex-
tension of the Central line
just the same—per medium of the Leg. Council.
He Old Age Pensions—the “Old Age”
is certainly all there in connection with the
Victorian applicants. One magistrate (of Fitz-
roy) says he has heard 71 declarations, in which
the total ages amounted to 5083 years—average,
71 years and 7 months. Two-thirds of the appli-
cants had never received any aid before from any
quarter, and many were reluctant to apply. The
idea that there is any humiliation in applying
ought to be knocked on the head at once. Turner
looks quite happy when he hears of these applica-
tions. His career as Treasurer of Victoria began
with retrenchment but ended with one of the best
and most generous, not to say just, bits of social
legislation yet done in Australia.
E. M. Clark, M.P. for North Shore (Syd-
ney), yells that the memory of Henry Parkes
should be honored by the erection (at Government
expense, of course) of a statue (to be placed in
Clark’s constituency, of course). Mr. Clark doesn’t
offer a pound or two to start a memorial subscrip-
tion—he merely remarks that Govt, has erected
statues in other constituencies. Miserable Aus-
tralia ! Her distinguished dead are to be
“honored” (by the Treasury)—why? So that
Bawler Clark may raise his bull-voice and say:
“Look at the statue I got for yer ! ” —just as the
Clark sort of politician might say : “ Look at the
beautiful gaol that was erected in your main
street through my influence ! ” Vote for Clark !
One reason of N.S.W. Premier Lyne’s
desire to hold on to his dual office was his
private anxiety as to his probabilities of successful
electiop to the Federal Parliament. At the recent
election for his own constituency of the Hume,
with all the dignity of a State Premier behind
him, his opponent polled remarkably well. The
situation is further complicated by the fact that
his nominee, Commissioner Oliver, completely
ignored the claims of Albury electorates in his
reports on the capital site. As Home Secretary
in the Australian C.fbinet Lyne dare not go to the
polls pledged to anv one localitv on the capital
question, and the Riverina electors will want a
member who will work without scruple in the
interests of the southern towns. Yet, if Lyne
goes north, to evade this issue, he will suffer all
the disadvantages of the man who ran away. The
parrot cry, “The Bolt from Bourke,” undoubtedly
assisted in beating Toby Barton in that famous
King Division contest.

WEBBER’S
VITADATIO
IS THE BEST REMEDY.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Agent for Webber’s “ Vitadatio."
Sir,—lt is with feelings of deep and heartfelt gratitude
that I write to thank you for the benefit I have received
from “ Yitadatio.” It has honestly made a grand change
in my life. For the past 15 years I have been a martyr to
Indigestion in its worst form. For over 2 (two) years I
was practically helpless, being doubled up and quite
unable to straighten myself. My stomach was so weak i
that I was unable to take more than four ounces of very
light food per day, consequently I became weak generally
and within a short time I fell away to a mere skeleton. I
was attended by some of our leading doctors, and must
have drank gallons of various kinds of medicine, all to no
purpose. Whilst in this miserable condition I read of
several cures of Indigestion by “Vitadatio,” and almost
as a last resource I decided to give it a trial, and right
glad I am that I did so. After a few large bottles I felt
great relief. I continued with the medicine, and all along
could feel the “slow but sure” return of health, until
here I am to-day perfectly restored and without an ache
or pain in the stomach after food. I can now eat three
good meals per day and enjoy them. I am at a loss for
words wherewith to express my gratitude, but. you may
be sure I shall spread the good news that Webber’s
“ Vitadatio” can, and has, cured Indigestion in its worst
form.
I hand you this testimonial perfectly voluntarily, and
you may have my permission to use it as you deem
advisable. I shall be pleased to interview and give details
of my case to anyone.
Yours gratefully,

The public does not yet know the next
move in the Coningham-O’Haran case, which has
not yet been again set down for trial; but it is
known that there are severe ructions between one
side and its lawyers.
It has come ! S.M. Herald, 8/l/’l :
PERRY.—On Commonwealth morning, at her resi-
dence, Dartbrook-road, Auburn, the wife of J. W.
Perry, of a daughter, Hope Hopetoun.
A Gerringong baby has been christened
“Doris Beryl Commonwealth.”
“Clodhopper ” upon the latest proposed
addition to Vie.’s list of white elephants—the
Melbourne grain elevator
The introduction' of' the elevator would involve re-
organisation of the whole system from the manufacture
of agricultural machinery, down to the hull in which the
grain is shipped. It would place the grain-producer still
more in the hands of capitalists and wheat-speculators,
and would compel all grain to be brought to Melbourne
for shipment. The' time occupied in getting to con-
sumers’ markets, also, would have to be reduced by fully
one-half, owing to the liability of grain to deteriorate in
transit; and the extra insurance while stored in elevator
and en route would be serious. Finally, how is the
specially-equipped class of vessel required to be
attracted to these ports? In ordinary times regular
lines swamp up all available outward freight, leaving
nothing for the outsider who would be compelled to come
here in ballast—an expensive matter for a steamer. It is
hardly possible that regular liners will be induced to
incur the delay of waiting their turn at the “ tip ” for the
purpose of, perhaps, filling up one hold only. Therefore,
since £lOO,OOO seems available for spending somehow, and
since the great wail in the country ’ districts during the
grain season is “ more trucks,” let the cash be spent in
more rolling-stock.
Away back in ’5B, when the British Govt,
wanted a rifled canon to beat that just adopted
by the French, Armstrong (recently dead at 90)
came forward with a complete system—breech-
loading guns, projectiles, fuses, and all.
These, however, failed ignominiously when
tried in the field in China in ’6O, but
before that A. had got £20,000 down, a salary of
£2OOO a year as Director of Rifled Ordnance, and
a baronetcy. Then he started the Elswick Ord-
nance Co., and invented a muzzle-loading system,
adhering to his original plan of building up his
guns by shrinking on the successive coils of iron
hot. The huge forgings, however, did not con-
tract equally, whereas Whitworth’s guns, which
had the coils forced on cold, were free from this
fault. A. therefore took W. into partnership,
and soon after became a peer. The firm built the
ships of the Australian auxiliary squadron, and
has sold much now obsolete and obsolescent
artillery to Australian Governments.
S.A. ceased to be a “province”—it was
the only place in Australasia officially designated
a “ province, ” the rest being “ colonies ” —on Ist
January, and became a “ State.” And already a
local solicitor has dropped on a promising techni-
cal point hereabouts. He complained that the
information charged his alleged drunk or other
offender, by a document filed on behalf of the
State of S. A. early in January, with having com-
mitted an offence in the State of S.A. on 27th
Dec., at which date there was no such State—only
a Province. Also, he complained that the J.’sP.
and magistrates were authorised to administer
justice in the Province of S.A., but not having
been sworn-in afresh they had nothing to do with
the State of S.A., and that place, having no J’s.P.
or magistrates, was at present one where a man
could get drunk with complete impunity. S.A.
is still struggling with the problem, which is in-
teresting in a casual way, as showing what useless
things a lawyer can discover at great expense.
The latest development of the hat on the
river bank, with the message inside it to the effect
that the owner can’t endure life any longer, comes
from Brisbane. In this case, however, some pri-
mitive humorist seems to have left another man’s
hat on the beach, and then departed cackling joy-
ously over his joke. The hat beside the river is
becoming a rather discredited witness nowadays.
The Sydney water police are still anxious to find
that person who signed himself “ Mark Maroon,”
and whose prevaricating “ cadey ” upon the shore
led to days of weary dredging for an imaginary
body. Though after all the police should have
known better, “ Mark Maroon ” being so obvi-
ously a name out of a scalp-hunting penny novel.
If there ever was a person so-called he was better
dead anyhow.

Verdict returned, the other day, by a
Murrumburrah (N.S.W.) jury :
There is not sufficient evidence to show how the fire
originated, whether accidental or otherwise, but the
evidence points strongly to it being caused by a spark
from a passing engine.
There wasn’t any evidence, but what there was
was strong.
In the matter of providing itself with
public swimming-baths, owned by the munici-
pality, 13-year-old Broken Hill beat 5-year-old
Kalgoorlie by only a fortnight, reckoning by the
dates of the formal openings. Kalgoorlie’s
“pond” holds 95,000 gallons, Broken Hills
80,000. But whereas plenty of mineralised water is
available for the former, Broken Hill has to de-
pend altogether upon its very slender store of
more or less fresh water.
Broken Hill mines’ “butchers’ bill” for
1900 reached 27. The second half was an improve-
ment on the first ; apparently there is no account-
ing for the variations. With the opening of 1901
the miners’ accident fund came into force \ under
it the miner injured while at work and the depen-
dents of those killed may draw relief from the
fund, half of which is provided by the men and
the other half equally by owners and State.
Besides the 27 fatal accidents at B.H. there were
90 non-fatal.
Cape Minister Frost, now visiting
Australia, evidently found it hard to explain to a
Melbourne interviewer how it was that a pro-
British Ministry held office at the Cape when the
vast majority of voters were pro-Dutch. He con-
tented himself with saying that there were
peculiar circumstances connected with the
question. Other Cape visitors have naively
remarked that the local forces in S’Africa were
not volunteers at all, but were called out and
had to fight no matter what their sympathies
were. Read this in conjunction with Frost’s
statements that the Englishman who marries a
Dutch women, which a very large number do, is a
Dutch sympathiser and what do you get ?
NAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
w ith Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps Bur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies alt
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
mav be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had

DEATH FOR A
WAITER.—When a
man suffers from ne-
glected indigestion,
constipation, and tor-
pidity of the liver, he
soon loses all enjoy-
ment of his meals.
Nothing tastes good or looks appetizing. He
grumbles at his wife, or the cook, or the landladv,
or the waiter, as the case may be. People say he
is “ hard to please,” and let it go at that. The
fact is that the man is in a precarious condition,
and if he continues to neglect his health, is a
candidate for consumption, or some equally ter-
rible malady. If a man does not wish to “dine
with Death for a waiter,” he should take the right
remedy for “little ills” as they arise, and thus
ward off the “ big ones.” When a man’s appetite
is poor, when his liver is torpid, when he feels
“headachey,” dull, listless, and generally out
of sorts, he should take Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They make the appetite keen, the liver
active, the blood pure, and the whole body ener-
getic. They cure that trouble called constipa-
tion, which is the starting point of many ills.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills cure it positively,
certainly, infallibly; cure it so it stays cured;
cure it so you can stop taking medicine. And
this is something no other remedy will do. “ I
have experienced great benefit from the use of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which I have tried
for habitual constipation, from which I have been
a sufferer for many years. As I ha,ve tried many
remedies for this common complaint, I am in a
position to testify that they are the best medicine
I have ever taken. I never had anything to go so
well through the system, and to set me right so
quickly. Also, they act very agreeably, never
causing pain, as is the case with so many cures for
Indigestion. I would advise anybody suffering
from constipation to try them.” Mr. T. Thorpe,
51 Stewart-street, Richmond, Vic., submits his
testimony in favor of this remedy. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills positively cure biliousness, in-
digestion, constipation, dyspepsia, headaches,
liver and kidney complaints, piles, pitnples, and
blotches. Sold by chemists and storekeepers,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
At big rifle-meeting, just finished, Private W. H.
• V,c- S ot away with first money (£100) of
£lOOO given for the “Queen Victoria "-the most im-
portant competition of the lot. Gargett led all through.
Sergt. Hawker (also of Vic.) pressed the winner hotly, and
shot consistently all the time, finishing 1 point only
behind, and getting second money (£5O), after a tussle at
900vds. that brought all on the range round the shooters.
The match was in doubt till the last shot gave Hawker an
inner ' instead of the bull’s-eye needed to win. Sergt.
Hawker got the aggregate (378), with G. Howitt, S.A.
(375), second, and G. Whitehead, Vic. (374), third.

Concluding day (Saturday) of N.S.W. National
Rifle Assn. Commonwealth meeting was interesting A
Carter (Vic.) and D. Scott (N.S.W. police) shot off their
tie in N.S.W. match, and Carter won. Victorian match
went to J. Ross (Vic.), who scored 34 out of a possible 35.
Oapt. Bennett (Vic.) was second with 32. AQ. combina-
tion scored 582 points and annexed the teams’ match
(“The Empire”), open to defence forces of all British
possessions, and shot over 700, 800 and 900 yds. ranges.
Bathurst tN.S.W.) men were second—l behind. Alex.
Ferguson (for the winners) made 96 out of a possible 105.
The gathering was in every respect a record one. Over
1000 competitors, as follows : N.S.W., 512 ; Victoria, 213 •
Queensland, 181 ; S.A., 60 ; W.A., 5 ; Tas., 88 ; M.L., 25 ;
India, 21; Great Britain, 6. Money totalling £4BOO was
divided into about 1600 prizes.

The feature of the Commonwealth Rifle Com-
petition at Sydney was the success of the visitors from
the other States, particularly Victoria. The latter pro-
vided Ist and 2nd in the Queen Victoria, the chief event;
and out of the first ten places in the Grand Common-
wealth Aggregate six went to Victoria, two to S.A., and
one each to Queensland and N.S.W.

The recent military sports at Sydney Agricul-
tural Ground made mostly a very poor display, though
one fine item was an athletic exhibition by the British
troops. Little short of insane, however, was the keeping
of these men bareheaded for an hour and a half under a
sun which present writer—an old bush hand—found very
trying even under a broad-brimmed cabbage-tree. The
best item on the programme was the trick-riding by the
Indian in the green cap. His performance was clean,
sure and safe, and was a revelation even to many of the
fine horsemen present.

Corporal JEggleton, of the Imperial Royal Horse
Guards, who easily got away with the foils, sword, and
singlestick competitions in connection with the Sydney
Naval and Military Assault-at-Arms concluded last week,
is every inch a soldier in appearance and build. He
stands straight as a rush 6ft 3jin., and is proportionately
§ ut together, scaling over 15st. Two years ago, at the
ational Sporting Club, London, he won the heavyweight
boxing supremacy of the Army, and owns many prizes as
the result of numerous successes in the British Naval and
Military and London District tourneys.

Brisbane Handicap (one mile) at night cycle
meeting on Sydney Cricket Ground, Saturday, produced
some hot racing in every heat. All the front rankers
lined up. The final was a rare tussle. Back markers
Wilksch and Martin went quickly after the field. Just
before the last lap all were bunched, and bumping was
the order for several seconds, though nobody fell.
Wilksch got through but Martin was blocked and former
won by half a length from Matthews, who shot out near
the end. Time done (1.58 2-5) is the fastest ever put up in
this section and, perhaps, the world. Fact of Wilksch
doing this from 15yds evidences that he is almost upsides
with the best.
Mile Scratch Race same evening was inter-
esting and exciting. All four heats and the final supplied
hot finishes. Decision of absolute best lay between
“ Merkans” Martin and Lawson, Englishman Green, and
Australian W. M'Donald. Last-named shaped better
than for a long time, and won by half a wheel brilliantly
in 2.11. Finishing lap (1-mile) was done in 32. This
indicates that M’Donald has regained his form of a year
ago, when he ranked as the speediest we had.
• • * •
The comparatively poor attendance at Monday
night’s cycling demonstrated indisputably that Sydney is
getting more than enough of the thing,"which has been
played for all it is worth with little regard for the popu-
larity of the sport. Chief item was the final of the Inter-
Nation Test Race, decided over three distances. Megson
and Beauchamp represented Australia ; Martin, America ;
and Green, England. Five, three, two, and one points
were allowed the first four men respectively in each heat.
One distance (the mile) was run on Saturday, and the
competitors were raced in pairs. Green beat Megson by
a length in 2.14 3-5, and Martin finished half-a-wheel better
than Beauchamp—by dint of an exhausting effort—in
2.13 3-5. Monday night the 2 miles went to Martin and
Green. Megson got home by a length in the 3 miles,
with Green second, Martin third, and Beauchamp fourth.
The Plugger’s tire punctured and he finished on the rim.
All the cracks were in the 5 miles scratch, but just before
throwing the third mile behind, Vaughan, Beauchamp,
Goodson, and Carpen er came down. Beauchamp and
Vaughan only suffered from the shaking ; Carpenter
injured a leg and an arm, while Goodson’s nose got a bad
smash. Yankee Lawson (with a lightning-like sprint)
crossed the line 14 lengths in front of Martin. Green and
Chapman dead-heated for third money. Time, 11.1.

Yankee wheelman Ivor Lawson, now shaping
so well in Sydney, brought a world’s record down just
before leaving the U.S. Nov. 26 he and J. Nelson (among
the fleetest U.S. pace-followers) met in a 15 miles paced
race on an indoor track in California, and Lawson got
home a quarter of a mile to the good in 25min. 12sec.,
which reduced the previous best by 37sec.

Although ’twas carnival time at Christchurch
(M.L.), the big amateur athletic championships were
poorly patronised. The erst Sydneyite, Roseingrave,
shaped well, beating the standard in 120 yds. Hurdles ;
won Long Jump (20ft. 6in.) ; tied with C. S. Harper and
Preble (5.6 J) in High Jump, and got second to Preble
(9.10 J) in the Pole Jump. E. T. Harper put up standard
time in quarter-mile Hurdles (62 3-65.); J. Hirons walked
off with the 100 yds. Flat (10 3-55.) and 220 yds. (28 4-55.).
The coveted banner fell to Canterbury with 92pts.,
Dunedin being next with only 23 pts.

Borne talk of Vic. Royal Agricultural Society
asking a Govt, grant for a show to be held during the
Dook o’ York’s visit to Melbourne, but the Govt, blew
cold on the suggestion. As though his worried little Nibs
could possibly raise even a pretence of feeling interested
in native fat stock and imported reapers and binders !
Now, there is a lot of horse-sense in the V.R.C.’s loyal and
business-like proposal to fix up a steeplechase meeting at
Flemington for the entertainment of York —and the
public.

No surprise in the news that Stevenson has
beaten Dawson for ihe English billiard championship.
There is nothing great in Dawson’s play, unless he has
mightily improved since he visited Australia. Stevenson,

R.S.Y.S.’s 30-rating class event in Port Jack-
son, Saturday, was a gift to Mr. J. O. Fairfax’s English-
built flyer Magic. Westerly weather—at times squally—
prevailed. On the long free reach to Manly, with a lead-
ing wind, Magic literally romped away from the others,
and held so much to the good that, though the opposition
wiped off a heap on the thrash to Pinchgut, the distance
wasn’t anything like great enough to serve them.
Heather, Petrel, Fleetwing and Cooya all shaped better
on the wind than the winner, and Cooya behaved in a
manner that indicated she will need beating in a stiff
blow.

The winner of a youths’ bicycle race at Broken
Hill on New Year’s Day was one-legged ; he has now
ridden stubbornly in half-a-dozen races. And at the
same place, just before, another one-legged man had won
a swimming race in fast time, though that achievement is
much less rare than the other.
* * • •
Cycling is not the game it’s cracked up to be for
the man who comes first oftenest. A £5O first prize is not
worth £5O to the man who wins it, especially if that man
happens to be a scratch man. He has to pay somebody
for pacing him up, and in a big race like the Austral, if a
scratch man cannot arrange to be paced up, he has no
hope whatever of winning. However, every man, scratch
or otherwise, is on the lookout for a mate to pace him up,
so honors are easy among the cyclists themselves, and the
pacing system ensures faster and more attractive racing
than could otherwise be got—which is a good thing for
the public.

When Bilmartin went across from Australia to
’Frisco he played cards for two days and nights without
a sleep. “ I lost my sleep,” says Martin, “ but I won

have won 1500dol.”

The asphalted terrace in front of the grand-
stand at Flemington (Vic.), which has become cracked
and uneven under the heavy pressure of promenading feet,
is to be re-made with a tiled flooring, and extended to
double its present width. The extra 25ft. will be a grass
track, and the slope to the lawn will presumably be more
gradual than of yore.

M.L. Swimming Association has selected
Champion as its rep. in the Australasian championships
allocated to Victoria this season and beginning Feb. Ist.
On Dec. 29 Champion and the much-boomed Auckland
crack, Tyler, together with others, met in a furlong
supremacy of M.L. at Qhristchurch. In the final the pace
was so strong for Tyler that he couldn’t finish. All others
but Truscott (who was far behind) withdrew at different
stages, and Champion completed the journey in 2.58 1-5
which M.L. exchanges refer to as “ very fast time ” ; also
they pat Truscott on the back “ for swimming the whole
distance ” —the whole of 220yds. There are many in
Sydney who can get inside Champion’s performance.
•** * *
Compact between Australasian swimming bodies
makes Victoria the venue of this year’s Australasian
supremacies which should begin in Feby., but the Vic.
association* beyond announcing dates some time ago,
doesn’t seem to be doing anything in the matter. Minds
of swimmers in other States are consequently much exer-
cised as to whether the events will be decided or not.
M.L. people have applied to Sydney for information,
which looks as if they couldn't get any from the proper
quarter. ’Tis pretty certain that “Dick” Cavill and
“ Bob ” Craig only will represent N.S.W. Fred. Lane-
even if he hadn’t retired—could not do so, as the six
months’ residential clause would shut him out. Q. reps,
were to have been selected Monday. The mother-state
cracks should easily win every event they compete for.

The latest novice boxing tourney, concluded in
Sydney on Saturday night, should about stamp out for
good that particular form of pug. infliction. Why any-
one ever pays to endure it has long been a poser. Two of
the four bouts put on hadn’t gone 3min. before one of the
pair in each instance quitted consequent upon a couple of
very mild thumps ; and the fourth (final) was an absolute
fiasco, as one of the principals just stayed long enough to
see he was in for a bit of a punching, and then discovered
that his most useful mauley had been too badly hurt in
the semi-final to permit of continuing. These competi-
tions, though extending over a couple of years, haven’t
served to introduce to public notice anything like an
embryo Fitzsimmons, Foley, Jackson or Griffo. Sydney’s
slums are apparently utterly devoid of that class of
material.
* * * *
Maori Ruenalf’s defeat of negro Ike Stewart at
Golden Gate A.C. (Sydney) last week wasn’t scored with-
out some fighting. Ruenalf’s cool display hoisted him
many degrees in public estimation, and the crowd will
roll up at his next mill.
* * * *
Late news from U.S. is that Australian whilom
top-notch middle-weight Jim Hall was dying of tubercu-
losis when the mail left. Jim’s slab-like physique and
general appearance always suggested something of the
sort, which nevertheless might not have come but for the
life he led. Hall was as clever a man as ever left this sec-
tion, though perhaps hardly on the same plane as Peter
Jackson and Griffo. When they tried him out in ’Frisco
with the Californian fire-eater Greggains, Americans went
crazy on the possibilities ahead for the lathy Cornstalk.
Hall was in the U.S. two years without fighting once, yet
he still owned the reputation of being top o’ the heap.
His first big thing abroad was downing Pritchard—Eng-
land’s alleged invincible 11.4 man ; then the late Squire
Abingdon took to Jim, and backed him against Fitzsim-
mons. They fought at New Orleans for a huge pile of
money on the side and a fabulous purse, which Bob won
but never handled. The Squire contracted malarial fever
during the trip, and died ere he could get home. Bar
half-hearted affairs with Steve .O’Donnell and Choynski,
Hall never subsequently engaged in anything worth men-
tioning, as the mere suggestion of training broke him up.
* * * *
From late files of Frisco (U.S. A.) Chronicle :
“ The M‘Connell-Cribb fight is a poor card. M‘Connell is
all right, but Cribb is an unknown man who may or may
not be a fighter. He came here practically unheard of,
and for a club to force such a person on the public is
virtually to express the opinion that followers of the game
are easy, and that they will accept any old match. The
clubs are imposing on the public, and their fights should
be let alone until they make some matches between men
who are known to have some ability.” Explanation of
this is that those handling Cribb kept the Yankees in
ignorance of his record and antecedents for betting
purposes. Writer would like to wager that they’ve got a
much better opinion of Otto by this time ; his fight was
to take place Dec. 20.
• * m *
“ Old Timer ” : Among Victorian applicants for
old-age pensions is the ancient bare-knuckle fighter, Mat
Hardy, now awaiting death in a Ballarat benevolent
asylum. In the ’so’s Mat was a top-notch bruiser. The
then-famous black, Harry Sallars, went under to him with
many others. Hardy, ’tis said, is breaking up rapidly,
and his hands and feet are badly distorted through
rheumatic gout. At Hobart General Hospital (Tas.),
t’other day, Bill Higgins, another of the old school, drew
his last breath. Forty years ago he was a big factor in
matters fistic. When Jem Mace visited Australia in the
70’s he and Bill had ’em on often, and England’s last
champion pronounced Higgins a tough proposition. The
dead pug. always had a good name with his pals, and was
well-off once ; but latterly he got badly stranded and died
in poverty.
• » * •
Thus the long, ebon-hued, frock-coated, high-
hatted Felix, ex-premier bruiser of these States, in Melb.
Sportsman : —“ I would like to inform the heavyweight
division of Australia that I am ready and willing to fight
any of them on my merits, winner take all. In my last
fights with Doherty 1 was robbed out of the decision on
both occasions, and Doherty knows in his heart I can
beat him. I had him out twice, and if we ever fight again
it won’t be in Kalgoorlie or Sydney, but in Melbourne.”
This scribe knows nothing from observation of the Kal-
goorlie match, but he did see the Sydney one. Felix had
no hope from the fourth or fifth round, and, though
landing often, couldn’t do any damage when he did g t
home. Towards the end (20th round) Peter Jackson
passed word to Felix’s corner that he was a lump behind
on points, and could only win through a knock-out, but
Felix wouldn’t go in close enough. Felix s backer
(M'Clain) dropped £2OO over this match. Writer doesn t
think two of the crowd who saw him perform in Sydney
could ever be coaxed to look at Felix fight again.

The first big match of the century, which was
also the first inter-State match, provided three world-
records for first-class cricket. Highest number scored in
an innings, 918; previous best, 843. For largest number of
centuries recorded in an innings, s—Gregory 166, Noble 153,
Duff 119, Iredale 118, and Poidevin 140 not out—which is
also a record for a player in a first appearance in big
cricket. Also the victory of N.S.W. by one innings and
605 runs is the record licking.
* • • *
A feature of the second day’s play in the S.A.
v. N.S.W. match was the clean hatting of the home
eleven : 500 runs were scored for the afternoon without a
single unaccepted chance. When skipper Gregory was
84 Hill tried an over, from which little Sid. scored four
4’s and a 2, and then congratulated the S.A. crack for
helping him to his century.
N.S.W. bat Poidevin’s 140 not out against S.A.
is beyond the best ever previously done by any cricketer
shaping up for the first time in inter-State matches.
Poidevin is a medical student at Sydney. He has done
well at the wickets for several seasons past, but the selec-
tors never gave him a show till this time.
* * ♦ »
When M. A. Noble notched 153 against S.A.
t’other day he brought his list of centuries for first-class
cricket up to eleven and seven for inter-state matches,
which is ahead of anything ever done by other Corn-
stalks. Iredale has five and S. E. Gregory and Trumper
four each opposite their names.

Following upon a month’s spell necessitated
through the prevalence of inter-State matches, Sydney
local cricket competitions were resumed on Saturday.
Eighteen Paddington and Waverley wickets in that match
were down for 244. M. A. and brother E. G. Noble and
J. J. Kelly saved Paddington from complete collapse, as
the trio totted up 121 of the 151 notched. Eight of
Waverley are out for 93, which points to probable defeat.
North Sydney stands on velvet with regard to Redfern,
whom they sent back to the pavilion with only 134 to
credit, and themselves compiled 219 for the loss of only
“ Noss” Iredale and Duff. Redgrave gathered five wickets
for 47. Duff hit up 121, his second successful century ;
t’other was 119 against S.A. Pye and Jansen, whose play
has been “hoodooed” for some time, broke the spell,
and each topped hundreds; the former 122 for Central
Cumberland against Burwood, and latter 132 for Leich-
hardt-Balmain against Glebe. As a result of Pye’s play,
Central Cumberland was in all the afternoon and made
293 for six wickets.

George Giffen’s falling off in inter-State cricket
this season is lamentable. He has made only 65 runs for
six completed innings—average, 10. In bowling, George
captured but four wickets for 494 runs ! He has quite
lost his old bowling, and is now below second-rate form.
If an Australian Eleven were to be chosen just now the
erstwhile champion would not be worth consideration.
Frank Hill, a brother of the great Clem, made
207 in an inter-State railway match with Victoria,
recently, and followed it up, on Jan. 5, by making 85
(not out) against a combined junior team. There will be
two Hills in S.A.’s teams henceforth.
* * * *
Curious that S.A., although almost invariably
losing three matches out of four, has never since the
Shield was started lost them all. So, though only holding
the trophy once, she has often had a big hand iii settling
where it should go. She has just lost seven times
running to Victoria, but has regularly beaten N.S.W. (in
face of all paper form) once each season. Just before
that she lost six running to N.S.W., but took it out by
giving one bad licking to Victoria every year.
* * * ‘ *
The cricket prospects of S.A. are anything but
bright. Travers, the only bowler to be at all relied upon,
is not a colt who may improve indefinitely, but a man
already over 30. M‘Kibi>in (N.S.W. international) and
Drew (a promising Vic. country bowler) both drifted to
Port Adelaide before the season began ; and then neither
proved worth including in the State’s best eleven, even
with things as bad as they are.

F. W. Milligan, the Yorkshire county cricketer,
was among the killed in S’Africa last year.

In Sydney second-grade cricket on Saturday,
Frank Punch, for N. Sydney v. Leichhardt-Balmain, had
the hard luck to narrowly miss another century—he was
caught at 99. Frank, one of the most promising comers
among the youngsters, belongs to the famous old Sydney
rowing family of his name, but is the first to take to
cricket. Though Frank pare, would give anything to see
his son doing doughty things in a wager-boat, the boy
has no desire for it.

Joe Darling is in Adelaide just now, full-
bearded and brown, from his Tasmanian sheep-station.
The ex-S.A. champion says he has not handled a bat
since his retirement, and, at present, has no intention of
doing so. Even the visit of an English team next season
may not tempt hiin to resume.

Talk of Sydney turf circles at time of writing is
the extremely contradictory performances within a week
of Bananaland mare Ma Ma. At Rosehill (5/1/T) she
started favorite and ran nowhere, but last Saturday
“ Kingston ” and “ Dickson ” Stakes (Warwick Farm)
went to her; the latter despite 71b. penalty humped.
The matter has been referred to the A. J.C. Ma Ma is by
Woodstock (a horse by Monmouth from Fair Rosamond,
the dam of Lord Cochrane), bred by Mr. Andrew Town.
Said that Ma Ma’s dam (Minnehaha) is identical with a
one-time Sydney galloway and top-notch performer in
the days of Sydney' Driving Park Club when it flourished
at the Agricultural Grounds.

First of Caulfield Cup winner Waterfall’s get to
race—Miss Robinson—annexed the two-year-old event
(Forrest Stakes) at Warwick Farm (Sydney'), Saturday',
beating seven others. Breeder (Mr. A. Hook) sent her to
Sy'dney to be sold at last annual vearling sales, but as
there was no buyer he leased the little lady to Kogarah
trainer, Dick O’Connor. Miss Robinson is a half-sister to
Merlin, who lately won at Newcastle. Mr. Hook, unfor-
tunately', has only a few of Waterfall’s stock, one of which
is The Future by Waterfall from Palmist—a half-sister to
the crack M.L. nag, Seahorse. Waterfall was Out one
season at the stud when the Indian Govt, bought him.
* * * *
Barton Stakes, Warwick Farm (Sydney) big
event, Saturday, was remarkable for the manner in which
fl.ving hut non-staying Benedick broke up the rest of the
field. Five furlongs from home he had most of the oppo-
sition demoralised, but was stopping fast himself. His
fierce pace-making led to Gibraltar mare, Rock of Ages
(sister to April Fool), bred by Mr. Francis Foy 7 and trained
by Teddy Keys, getting first past the judge.
* * * m
lie par. herein 12/l/’l. The Bananaland crowd
again came at their crack (in Q. only, apparently) nag,
Ohio, on Saturday at Warwick Farm, and put enough
money on to send him out second favorite at 5 to 2 in the
big race (Barton Stakes, lm. 21fui\), but he and the first
choice (Melodian) finished last. The stable will need a
big win to get even.
Flintlock’s recent win of Perth (W. A.) ; Cup
recalls that he is the third in succession of Carbine s sons
to annex that big event. Mural opened the list in 99,
and Carbineer followed. Big W. A. turf supporter, Mr.
0. N. Kidman, quite lately bought Flintlock (who hadn t
won a race during the previous year and a haif) for 70 or
90gs., and has since been offered -50 gs. for Amberites
grey brother. £2400 went through the tote dunng the
Perth Cup meeting.

A pony about 13 hands 3in. recently made a
remarkable leap at Hamilton (Vic.). Having bolted, it
jumped clean over the backs of two cab-horses about 16
hands high standing in front of an hotel.

Status among English stallions of the erstwhile
Australian wonder, Newhaven, is materially affected by
the fact that his pedigree is untraceable. Newhaven s
services are available at 9gs. ; they’d fetch a heap more
out here.
Attorney-General Isaacs having given it as
his opinion that in taking the Federal Treasurer-
ship Premier Turner accepted an office of profit
under the Crown, the later has resigned his seat
for St. Kilda.
Mr. Justice Martin, lately appointed to
M. Supreme Court Bench, has, it is cabled,
resigned. He is at present in Sydney and does
not, it is said, intend returning to Maoriland.
Why, is not stated ; but the reason appears to be
known.
Petroleum, which Germany doesn t pro-
duce, is apparently going to be given a hard
knock in that country by acetylene, which it does
produce. Already Germany has 200,000 acetylene
jets in use ; the Govt, railways have introduced
it; and there is something like a boom in the
manufacture of carbide. The curse of Protection
again—allied in this case with technical edu-
cation !
Dr. Byrne, R.C. Bishop of Bathurst,
N. died last week of an internal growth, a
day or two after receiving from the people of his
diocese a testimonial of nearly £3OOO, with part of
which it was designed he should travel to repair
his health. Broad-minded tolerance and inde-
fatigable industry appear to have been Dr.
Byrne’s leading characteristics, and he was on
enviable terms of friendship with his “separated
brethren ” of other churches.
Sydney telegraph-operator W. Parker,
who died on Friday last week, aged 37, was among
the most expert and reliable in the service, with
which he had been connected for about 25 years.
At different periods he worked the Melbourne,
Brisbane, and latterly (for some considerable time)
Adelaide lines. Years back, when Wentworth
was the repeating station for S.A., and cable
business generally, and most of the signals had to
be guessed rather than read, owing to the induc-
tion caused by several wires running long dis-
tances on the sames poles, and the perished con-
dition of manv sections, Mr. Parker was one of
the Wentworth staff. He often slaved right
through the 24 hours, and did work which was
never anything like adequately recognised by the
Dept, to whose demands he, like many another
good man, sacrificed his nervous system. He was
a son of Inspector Parker, in charge of Grafton
Police District.

An Imperial Parliamentary return, just
issued, states that at the end of Nov. there were
no fewer than 267,000 troops in S’Africa under
Roberts’ orders, against an outside limit of 20,000
Boers. The total has since been considerably
reduced, but there are still 210,000 rank and file
in S’Africa. And now the cables tell us that,
apart from recruits raised locally, reinforcements
of at least 40,000 more are wanted. The proposed
Peace celebration was indeed premature.
Melbourne Aoe demands that Isaacs shall
succeed Turner as Victorian State Premier, while
the Akgus demands that Peacock shall have the
billet. The chief objection in Isaacs’ case seems
to be that he has promised to go into Federal
politics, so an Isaacs Ministry couldn’t last over
three months. Curiously enough, while Melbourne
papers are raving about the future Vic. State
Premier, the Sydney journals have hardly
even alluded to Lyne’s possible successor—
who is to be John See. The fiscal question
loomed so large in N.S.W. that now it has
departed out of State politics people have hardly
begun to realise that there are any State politics
left. Yet the State Legislature is the institution
which will make roads and bridges, and build
statues of Australia Facing the Dawn, and pass
laws for the more effectual hanging of the com-
munity, and there is still a big career before it.
How is this for a ship with a “ rnozzle ?
The Canada left Norfolk (Virginia, TI.S.A.) some
time in 1899 with coal for Manila. It lost a mast
off the Cape of Good Hope, and crawled into
Melbourne for repairs. Arrived there on 24th
Dec. 1899. While getting its new mast it varied
the monotony of life by taking fire, and when it
was extinguished its whole cargo of coal (2000
tons) was discharged in a damaged state and dis-
gustedly sold. The Canada was repaired—she
needed 60ft. of new keel in addition to her other
troubles —and then she went into the timber busi-
ness and had got as far as the W.A. coast when
she was dismasted in a storm and got into Fre-
mantle for repair. She had to discharge cargo to
get at the damages. Then she loaded again, and
on 23rd Dec., 1000, she started once more with a
timber cargo. About three days out, however,
she began to leak like a sieve, so the Canada fled
back to port and is again discharging cargo for
repairs. Therefore the Canada has been fooling
on the face of the deep for about 18 months with-
out arriving at any place she definitely wanted to
go to, and has discharged three cargoes, all at the
wrong place, and has about eaten herself up in
expenses by now.
It is not generally known that Alf. Bailes
had the refusal of the Mines portfolio in the
Turner-Peacock-Isaacs Ministerial team, but it is
a fact nevertheless. Alf. was “ willin’,” but there
was an obstacle—Hamilton threatened to recon-
test the seat. That meant at least £6OO, and
nothing certain at that. Negotiations failed.
Alf. was not a millionaire, and, at the last
moment, he accepted a £3OO a-year whipship, on
the good old principle of a bird in the hand.
Sands and McDougall’s Melbourne Direc-
tory for 1901 testifies to the fact that Melbourne
is looking up. Last year’s list of householders is
exceeded by many hundreds in the 1901 issue. As
usual, Sands and Mac’s red Directory contains a
large amount of general information, condensed
for speedy reference, and really indispensable to
business and professional men. The map has
been corrected to date, and altogether the work is
true to its name.

Everyone is glad to see from Emily Soldene’s London
letter to Sydney E. News that she has still got her appe-
tite and is able to sit up and take “ something with
soda.”
The Broughs were booming at Calcutta a month ago.
Of their business with “ The Liars ” a local paper (the
Englishman) said; “Throughout the past week the
Brough Comedy Cos. have been playing to wonderfully
good houses at the Theatre Royal, and have thus once
more proved that they are the only company that can
succeed in filling a theatre on what are usually known as
‘off’ nights.” Also an enthusiastic notice of “Quex”
started with the intelligence that money was turned
away. “Quex” ran a week—which means a big success
in Calcutta—and “ Lord and Lady Algy” came next on
the list. The co. appears to be going strong, and none
of the principals had caught a plague or other indis-
position wheu last heard from. The Broughs, Grace
Noble, Emma Temple, Lovell, Mario Majeroni, Dartrey,
and Bessie Thompson were in the “Quex’’cast as of
old.
Bert Gilbert’s anxiety to let Australian papers know
that he has found a second wife in Miss Dolly Daintree,
suggests that he hasn’t quite recovered from Ada Reeve’s
divorce. Also it reveals a probability of the nimble Bert
returning to these parts when the first chance offers.
The Bulletin knows nothing about Miss Daintree (except
that it thinks it has read some sweet notices of her figure,
face and talent) but the name seems appetising, anyhow.
The happy pair signed their marriage contract at Cardiff,
Dec. Ist.
Bendigo Advertiser, having barracked persistently for
the Amy Castles boom, and feeling hurt at the alleged
opinion of Marchesi that Amy’s voice is not a really big
affair, says: “ It filled the great hall of the Exhibition so
that every one of the 14,000 people in the audience heard
quite perfectly.” The same remark applies with more
force to other vocalists who sang with Amy at the same
Exhibition concerts. Present scribe was surprised to
notice how large and full the voice of Miss Minnie Waugh
sounded by comparison with the vaunted warble of the
little girl from Bendigo, which, however, was big for its
age—only 19.
“ Theorbo " : It transpires that Miss Amy Castles did
leave Marchesi because of a disagreement. Marchesi said
ghe would never succeed in opera, whereupon Amy took
the huff. Why are her friends so particularly anxious to
make her an operatic artist? It is a thorny career.
Marchesi says that lofty honors upon the platform are
open to the girl. She was flung at Marchesi in rather too
much of an imperative style, as the genius of the age. Of
course it is easy to find a master, while the coin is
abundant, to declare that Amy is Patti and Jenny Lind
rolled into one, Marches! says she is too small, and won't
grow, I heard Amy sing once, under the most favorable
circumstances, at Bt. Patrick’s, Melb., and went home
wondering what It was all about.
Miss Amy Castles, according to her Bendigo friends, is
now under M. Bouhy, “ who has the greatest reputation
of any teacher in Paris.” Evidently Marchesi’s reputation
has been wrecked in consequence of her refusal to admit
that Amy’s voice is a dramatic soprano. Bouhy declares
it to be a “ magnificent dramatic soprano,” and promises
to make Amy an operatic star of surprising lustre, despite
the fact that she does not seem to be built that way.
Dear Bulletin. —One “ Sfogato ” tells you that Mar-
ehesi’s pupils are “nearly all Australians, with a few
Americans and English.” I have seen two programmes
of the concerts given at l’Ecole Marchesi, and I unhesi-
tatingly denounce Sfogato as—well, call him a dreamer.
He says “ French, Italian or German pupils she has
none.” I know that some of Marchesi’s star pupils within
the past two years have been French and Russian. It
should go without saying that Italian voices don’t need
to leave their own country for culture, and as for German
voices, no fashionable teacher outside of Germany wants
to be afflicted by them. Granting that Marchesi can only
turn out great singers when she gets fine material to
work upon, where is the teacher who can make them with
poor material? Celebrity as a teacher depends almost
entirely upon luck. Melba was Marchesi’s biggest stroke
of luck, but she has had others. —E.
Statements made by the Amy Castles fanatics as to her
not getting fair treatment from Marchesi are flatly contra-
dicted by girls who were fellow students with her at
Madame’s school. It is a significant fact, too, that any
disparaging criticisms of Marchesi which have come to-
this country were written by Australian girls whose
voices didn’t paralyse the old lady. And these com-
plaints are echoed, of course, by their mortified friends
and teachers on this side. The complainers are interested
parties, whereas Marcnesi can have had no purpose, or
prejudices, to serve in saying things that didn’t please
them.
It has been a season of processions in Sydney ; but the
funniest of all was on Commonwealth night. It consisted
of a 3-horse ’bus loaded with Rickards’s Tivoli Cos., and;
followed by the majestic Harry and family in an open
landau. At every corner the ’bus stopped while the co.
sang “ Rule Britannia,” and cheered the illuminations—
and Harry.
Oscar Wilde (according to Paris correspondent of
London Daily Chronicle— who saw him on his death-bed)
attributed much of his moral obliquity to the fact that
his father would not allow him to become a Catholic.
“ The artistic side of the Church and the fragrance of its
teaching would have cured my degeneracies. I intend to
be received before long.” Shortly after this interview
Wilde underwent a serious operation. The result was
unfavorable, and the patient died during the administra-
tion of the customary rites of the Catholic Church.
Adelaide Cyclorama, long empty, has been swept and
varnished and opened as a music-hall, with smoke and
liquor allowed among the audience. Long pieces have
so far been played, but such as admit of the introduction
of the Variety element—notably “ The Circus Girl ” and
“ Fun on the Bristol.”
The pretty little Adelaide Royal has, during the dead
season, been re-decorated and brought up to date by
Hudson and Pollock, the new lessees. It re-opened
with a wild and woolly melodrama, “ From Scotland
Yard,” with a strong low-comedy merchant. All the-
best things now in Australia are promised so soon as the-
weather gets cooler.
Adelaide Tivoli, practically without competition, has
been playing to immense business ail through the holi-
day season.
Steffani, in one of his letters to Melb. Age protesting
against its critic’s remarks on old Italian opera-music, re-
called the incident of Hans von Bulow, the German,
writing to Verdi to apologise for the “ ultra-Wagnerian
fanaticism ” which had led him to attack the composer of
“ II Trovatore.” The eminent von Bulow, a dozen years
ago, had the grace to feel ashamed of having uttered the
pedantic nonsense which petty Wagnerians are babbling
even to-day.
Williamson’s Biograph is a much-travelled show. When
it was finishing a season at Charters Towers some time
ago, Harold Ashton, the manager in charge, got instruc-
tions from the boss to rush it right away to Kalgoorlie, a
journey of 7000 miles. This is the Australian record for
continental town-to-town touring. Probably the world’s
record, though showmen do some big jumps in America.
Sir Arthur Sullivan, it seems, confessed that Kipling’s
“Absent-Minded Beggar,” with its unmelodious metre
and awful “ Pay, pay, pay,” gave him no inspiration
whatever, and the dirge he eventually composed was the
sickest thing he had ever put his name to. The effort
probably hastened Sullivan’s end, but he lived long
enough to have the satisfaction of knowing that his
despondent tune had died before him.
Little Maud Chetwynd, of Williamson’s Opera Go., was
formerly a “star” amateur in one of the Melbourne
dancing-schools—the Misses Hyams’s. She married Dr.
Singleton’s son.
An inexpressibly stupid proposal has just been quashed
by a storm of ridicule, viz., to place Helen Paucit’s bust
in the chancel of Stratford Church, beside Shakespeare’s.
The idea is said to have emanated from Her Gracious, with
whom Theodore Martin (Helen’s hubby) has been persona
grata. Don’t you see, it would be such a valuable re-
minder for the theatrical profession to keep Respectable,
such an ad. for the Church and Stage Guild. But then
poor old Shaky would have to be taken away and put
beside Johnny Toole or somebody.
There’s a good deal in a name, after all. Melb. Age
gives the late Sir Arthur Sullivan credit for “ true Irish
liberality ”in the scattering of his cash. If the composer
of “Pinafore” had borne his original family name of
Solomon —and he looked a Solomon, from top to toe —
the Age would have quoted him as a notable instance of
Jewish charitableness.
Bert Bailey, the promising humorist, of Anderson’s
dramatic co., made his first appearance in Melbourne in
“ The American Girl,” an alleged comic opera produced
under amateur management at the Princess’s two or three
years ago. The awful show staggered along for a fort-
night, and then melted into oblivion.
Lottie Collins was a contortionist before she struck out
in the song and dance line. The famous “ Ta-ra-ra ”
frenzy was pretty much of a contortion act, for every time
she got to “ boom-de-ay ” she perpetrated a back-bend
which brought her loose hair in contact with the stage.
The mad outbreak was merely suggested, never repro-
duced, by Alice Leamar and others.
The willingness of Horace in “ A Message from Mars ”
to give the pauper many drinks before offering him food
is a leaf from life. Who hasn’t seen it done'?
“ Theatrical managers (says Sydney D. TANARUS.) are all
Niobes. They are all smiles.” Niobe and smiles ? Shade
of Lempridre !
The retirement of Edward Lloyd, the English tenor,
seems to be slowing down as time goes on instead of
getting nearer to its end. Certainly, the well-preserved
veteran is said to have made his absolutely last final
appearance at a musical festival, but he now talks of
making a long professional tour, to include Australia, ere
he settles down upon his Sussex farm and sings to the
cows. If Lloyd ever reaches these parts The Bulletin
will get General Desire to insist upon his warbling “ The
Anchor’s Weighed.”
A fire panic at the Grand Theatre, London, was allayed
by the orchestra striking up “ God Save the Queen,” says
the cable. The audience, presumably, saw the uninten-
tional humor of the situation, and paused in its head-
long flight. “ Gorsave the Queen” at a moment when
two thousand people are rushing to save themselves is
just what might be expected—from a band. At Melb.
Royal the band sometimes plays a bit of Gounod’s
“ Funeral March ” by way of sentimental accompaniment
to a love scene. . •
“ F” : After all didn’t the epidemic of fine Vic. voices,

Concerning the recent great fire at New-
castle, N.S.W.:
It is quite true that the fire went out “ on its own,”
but, considering’ the miserable appliances, the men did
splendid work in partly subduing the flames and saving the
houses on the opposite side of the street. Inferior coal
is stated to have caused the delay in getting steam up,
but as steam can be raised in an ordinary cold iron up-
right boiler within three-quarters of an hour with wood
and slack coal, half-an-hour is a preposterous time to
raise steam in a fairly warm copper boiler. By-the-way,
as an inducement to firemen to remain within their dis-
trict, why not remunerate them after the fashion of the
N.S.W. partially-paid military forces ?—J.S.

Which is so remarkable for its progress in all departments of Art, Philosophy, Manufacture and Science it is
surprising to find the practice of Medicine so deplorably in the rear, while thousands of practitioners m the

WHY WE ADVERTISE!
Because Advertising is the legitimate means vouchsafed to enlighten people,
to acquaint each other with their avocations and wants. If'a man has a
Speciality, and has devoted years of his life and expended large sums of money in studying that Speciality and in
purchasing the necessary appliances, etc., for treating certain diseases, it would be absurd for him not to announce
the fact, and disseminate tne knowledge universally. We have no apology to offer for informing the world through
this advertisement and otherwise of the means of relief we can afford to sufferers who need our help. Therefore,
however opposed to your own preconceived ideas and to those of your medical advisers, our method of treatment may
he, the fact still remains that it is successful, and this is verified by the thousands of testimonials received from
grateful patients. We make no secret of our mode of practice. We only claim to have utilised in a common-sense
way the result of scientific research and long experience. If you listen to the counsel of your sceptical friends and
jealous physician you may omit consulting us, but remember if you allow the disease to run riot in your system, you
are guilty of culpable neglect, and are alone responsible for your future pitiful condition.

Do Not be Drugged to Death by Quacks
When there are so many quacks and impudent pretenders in the field of Medicine, who arrogate to them-
selves the monstrosity of giving counsel and advice in matters of which they are profoundly ignorant, and who
have nothing to recommend them but their audacity, sufferers cannot be too careful whom they consult.
Although liberty of choice belongs to all, discrimination is necessary. In consulting THE FREEMAN AND
WALLACE ELECTRO-MEDICAL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE patients may feel assured that they shall
receive the advice of those fitted by superior skill and education, the result of special study. Our reputation and
unparalleled success as Specialists entitle us to your confidence.

Last October Sydney Daily Telegraph printed
this paragraph
OLIVE SCHREINER AND SIR ALFRED MILNER.
I heard this week on the heist authority, writes “Lorna”
in the Birman Weekly, a story about Olive Schreiner
whioh I hope may be taken as a sign that the bitterness
between opposing parties has begun to subside in South
Africa. Mrs. ORONWRiam-SoHREiNER’a home is in
Johannesburg, but shortly before the war broke out she
left that town, and went to live in a country village near
Kimberley. From there she moved to her brother’s home
in Capetown, where she has since been staying. A well-
known American lady who happened to be living in
Capetown invited Olive Schreiner to tea, and they were
joined by Sir Alfred Milner. The distinguished
authoress had a long and earnest conversation with the
statesman, and when Sir Alfred Milner left she burst
into tears, and, turning to her friend, said, with deep
conviction, “ That is aniionest man.”
To The Bulletin’s idea that looked suspiciously
like one of the lies disseminated by the Rhodesian
press, reprinted by their sympathisers to Jingo
ends, and swallowed eagerly by the gullible mob.
So this paper wrote direct to Olive Schreiner
enquiring if the thing was true or false. By last
Capetown mail came her answer: “There is no
truth in the cutting; it is an unmitigated false-
hood.” Bulletin thought as much. Will Sydney
Telegraph now have the grace to publish the
denial, and express regret for circulating the
foolish yarn ?
Tasmanian News (24/12/'00) puts among
its “ Coming Events ” the death of poor old Vasco
de Gama in 1525. It is a pretty slow island which
hasn’t caught up to an event that happened 375
years ago.
Distressful South Australia ! She marks
her entrance to the Commonwealth by still
another public appeal for a Seed Wheat for Dis-
tressed Farmers. They might just as well make up
their minds to establish the fund as a permanency
at once ; any way, it has not had a rest for six
years.

So prolific is this year’s strawberry crop in
the Darling Range country of Westralia that one
single Perth fruit-shop has been drawing two tons
of the fruit per week from there. And it has
been found that passion-fruit grows to perfection
in the same district. With brains to help it, the
Western State may take any place in the group
inside the next 50 years.
General Colville—whom Roberts sent home
in disgrace in connection with the surrender of a
lot of Yeomanry, and who says “he won’t be
made the scapegoat for the incompeteney of
Roberts’ staff”—is a man of undoubted general
ability, and his version of the surrender of the
Yeomanry will be worth having. Colville’s
charges seem to touch Kitchener nearly, and that
extravagantly over-estimated person will be as
much on his trial as Colville himself.
The corrupting influences of the Rand are
now a stock theme for the satirist. “InEloro-
dora,” the exiled aristocrat, who has been years
out of England, makes some reference to Society,
whereupon Lady Holyrood protests, “ There is
no Society since the South African gold-mines
were discovered.” Which means that clean Lord
Noodle, who was a respectable institution of a bad
kind, has been shoved aside by dirty Lord Boodle,
who is deplorable in all his bearings.
On the motion of ex-Minister Best, the
new Victorian Land Bill gives the Government
power to compulsorily repurchase large estates for
closer settlement. No real good can be done in
the closer settlement business without power of
compulsory repurchase, and if the Upper House
rejects the idea, so much the more reason why the
Federal Government and the democratic Federal
Parliament should go into the land-resumption
business.

A record in domestic service. W. G.
Mathews, of Lane Cove Road, North Sydney,
arrived in Sydney in 1833, and immediately en-
tered the service of Alex. Berry, of the Crow’s
Nest, remaining in that service and in the service
of David Berry and Dr. John Hay, who succeeded
to Alex. Berry’s estates, until pensioned a few i
years ago. Mr. Mathews is now 86 years of age.
and for 65 years resided in a cottage on the Berry !
estate, at the head of Berry’s Bay.

Hall and a monster sports meeting at the Agricultural

“Cheenah ” writes from Shanghai :
The occurrence described some time ago in The Bulle-
tin by “ Malle ” must have taken place years ago. I have
taken many crowds of 1000 Chinese and more from
Swatow and other places, but I never saw them tallied in
the way described by “ Malle.” During at least the la>t
five years the practice has been for the space available to
be measured by the British Consul’s constable, a certifi-
cate being then granted for a suitable number of pas-
sengers ; ere the ship sails, the Consul and a doctor come
on board to see that no more than the proper number are
shipped, and that none are sick or unwilling to go. ' The
bulk of the Chinese passengers go down now in the Pi. and
O. cargo-boats, Ocean S.S. boats, &c., and only in the
plague-years do the coasters do any of this trade, because
the fear of quarantine prevents the liners from taking the
Chows on. It is a common remark here that the British
Govt, (represented by the Consuls) thinks far more of a
Chinese coolie than it does of anyone who is not a
“ taipau.”

suffering from depression, Joss
of appetite, feverishness, head-
ache; when the liver and bowels
are sluggish and inactive, you
are, in nine cases out of ten,
suffering from constipation,
either through neglect or, at
the other extreme, through
excessive drugging or pill
taking: you want a medicine
that will make the organs act
as Nature prompts them to act
when they are in a healthy
condition. California Syrup of
Figs (the original and genuine)
supplies the want. It is both
pleasant to the taste —a luxury
as much as a medicine —and
an unfailing remedy. It acts
as Nature does. It does not
gripe, nauseate, or weaken. It
gives relief pleasantly, leaving
the liver, kidneys and bowels
permanently benefited, so that
its use may be discontinued as
soon as the system is relieved
and cleansed. There is no dis-
comfort or inconvenience. It
simply aids and seconds Nature,
and its results are healthful
regularity, and total freedom
from dangerous impurities in the system,
doctors recommend its use.
That is why
CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS
is a positively reliable, and at the same time the most
agreeable, remedy for Constipation, Sluggish Liver,
Biliousness, Indigestion, Depression, Feverishness,
Loss of Appetite, Headache, and all kindred complaints,
speedily restoring health, appetite, energy and good spirits.
A boon to the busy man ; grateful to delicate persons ; a
treat to children.
THE GOOD IT DOES IS PERMANENT.
In order to get its beneficial effects you must take the genuine remed .
Remember the full tifle —CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS —and refuse in e ior

H.St.A.M. : Situation too old for any but the
most distinguished treatment E.J.W.: When we
found you addressing yourself as “ Esquire,” we knew
what to expect—and we were not disappointed....L. :
Probably the mineralisation of the waters (which nearly
always takes place in drought time) has something to do
with the death of the fish in the river named... .C.R.P.:
Reason doubtless lies in the fact that one of the mineral
waters named is mainly based on sulphate of magnesium,
whereas the other owes its medicinal properties to
sulphate of sodium. Better for you to see a doctor....
O. W. Mackay : You can’t dismiss the subject in that airy
style. Ninety-nine out of every 100 “ chronic loafers and
deadbeats” in the streets have something the matter
with them, physically or mentally. Perhaps not one in a
dozen would pass even the most cursory medical inspec-
tion .... Plaster : Same weary old dispute. It all comes
to this—that what was wrong about the case of Julian
Ashton is also wrong about the cases of Messrs.
Collingridge and Lister; no practising artist, and
especially no teaching artist, should have a place
on the National Gallery trust M. Windsor :
Garotting in London was not “ put down by the
lash." The garotte robberies, which commenced in
the summer of 1862, were suppressed by the ordinary law
several months before the Flogging Act of 1863 was even
introduced in the House. For official confirmation of
this, vide speeches in the Commons, 28/3/’OO, by Mr.
Asquith (late Home Secretary) and Sir Matthew White
Ridley (then Home Sec.), who agreed that “ garotting
was put down, without resort to flogging, by a fearless
administration of the existing criminal law.” M.A.W. :
Westralia has no circuit courts. The Judges don’t travel
round the country to hear cases; they camp peacefully
among the flesh-pots of Perth and let the cases come to
them. Criminal charges are mostly tried at Quarter
Sessions, the ordinary magistrate and the ordinary,
awful, honorary J.P. acting as Judges for the time
being, and throwing around long sentences at their
own ignoaant, honorary discretion. It was that
kind of court which recently sentenced an old
man named Pascoe, at Geraldton, to 10 years’ im-
prisonment for being found skinning a dead cow
Oscar M. : Too bombastic. “ The conversation drifted on
to the unattractive maelstrom of his faults" isn’t elo-
quence—it’s only balderdash Cearo : Only a poor
paraphrase of the Fourth of July orator who described his
country as “ bounded on the North by the Aurora
Borealis, on the South by the procession of the
equinoxes, on the East by the rising sun, and
on the West by the Day of Judgment.”
W. S. Craig: Pray don’t worry yourself overmuch re pos-
sibility of being buried alive. If you get into so low
a physical condition that you are taken for dead by
your friends, you certainly aren’t likely to suddenly
revive when screwed down in an airless coffin....
J. A. H. : Thanks ; very fu n ny, but we can’t well use it....
O.H. : “ Bus ’’-sketch has humor, but lacks crispness and
point.... Will. J. : “Scott” has good touches here and
there, but is devoid of congruity or coherence Bilby :
Obviously founded on facts, but the superstructure’s too
ricketty Geo. B. : Can you let us have another copy of
“ Tender ?’’ Glenara : Of course the horses leave in the
manger all the chopped-up twine they can ; but when
well mixed with the chaff it kills them surely enough
Naiad : Lacks life-force; the characters are mere names...
8.8. Bill : Hardly enough in it. .F.J.M.; Flatand futile..
O.W. ; Young goat-flesh is excellent eating, anyhow
0.01.: We don’t propose to whoop up the Stoke Orphan-
age sectarian row which it is to be hoped is now finished
with Jimmie P. : Many thanks for good wishes
B.: The story of the two-and-sixpenny lawyer who was
battered by two alternate ladies of his acquaintance is
not a convincing narrative, but The Bulletin grieves
over it all the same. The modesty of the Lothario’s fee
should entitle him to all the comforts of a harem
Wal C.: Same old false mate, and supposed killing, and
retributive turning up, and all the rest of it M.M.O. :
Hopelessly out of Bulletin line, and much too long, in
any case Onl. : “Golden Harp” yarn, grimly tame—
or tamely grim Wintonia; Ranging from “Boss,”
which is middling, down to “ Nell’s Mother,” which is
atrocious! Billabong : Too loose and lame Pullus :
Crude and clumsy G.N.F.; Thanks ; but rather “ far-
fetched.” Lackland: With some touching up, will go
we 11.... E. McD.: Reluctantly decided that * ‘ Cody ”is too
bald as written.... Magdalene : Some value ; but unsuit-
able as written. Throw it into dramatic story-form
Milky : Sorry to think “ Gleam ” not force enough ; will
consider Yarra verse separately if you like Barry
Spray ton : “ Phrenology ” for use Buck ward : There’s
a speck on the far horizon—guess that’s yours....
Haakon : If you send 4s. to E. W. Cole, 333 George-street,

Century.” And ss. sent to Brann, Waco, Texas, U.S.A.,
will bring you value in Brann’s Iconoclast A.J.H.:
Too obscure for us J.A.B. : Will print “Mag.”
Cowra : In June, 1899, Lord Lansdowne, the British
Sec. for War, calculated that the Imperial troops would
have to fight 29,000 Boers, and 4000 Cape rebels, and
those were about the actual figures. (2) Cronje surren-
dered his 4000 men to a British force at least 12 times as
strong Splinter: Oh! H. Stone : Your man who
celebrates the wrong century is a dreary eelebrator at
best H.B.H. : It may be, and probably is, all true
enough, for war does not alter the spots on Tommy
Atkins, but it’s not very convincing to look at. ..Ju Lius:

“ I have noted,” writes “ Willie Way-
back” to The Bulletin, “that at the last three
Public-school displays in Sydney Cricket Ground
all the pupils (some thousands) in the wands,
dumb-bells and flag-displays face the fashionable
side of the ground members’, ladies’, and
smokers’ stands—during the whole performance,
presenting their backs to the plebeian * bob
places,’ in which are the bulk of the pupils’ own
parents, who sacrifice so much in order to dress
their children decently for the occasion. Why
not make half the squads face one side of the
ground, and half t’other side?” “Honor thy
father and thy mother ! ”
Melb. Age believes that war between
Britain and France is imminent, and cites among
others these reasons: “Within two days of the
publication of the results of the British general
election, Chamberlain was dispatched to inspect
and report on the condition of the fortresses of
Gibraltar and Malta, and to confer with England’s
ally in the Mediterranean —Italy. The English
Govt, is pushing on its warlike preparations just
as assiduously as France. Four miles of cottages
have recently been constructed near Woolwich to
accommodate the extra workmen employed, the
total number now being upwards of 40,000. In
S. Africa all the generals from Lord Roberts
downwards (except Kitchener) have been recalled
and have returned to England. The Duke of
York does not visit Australia with a naval escort,
as originally intended, because every available
ship of war will be needed at home.” The Age
has a famous record for baseless war scares—
generally Russian.
The defence of the Mariat Brothers on
the charges of misconduotat Stoke (M.L.) orphan-
age cost £750, which is being subscribed. The
Crown’s expenses were £1260.
The sudden departure of a young lawyer
is mourned in certain sections of Australian
society. He was a man of tone, and forgery and
other crimes of the crudest character are publicly
alleged. In appears that he was bowled out some
time ago, but the well-intended forbearance of
those who might have prosecuted merely allowed
other scalps to be added to his belt.
Dear Bulletin,— Surely a record for
absurdity was put up by the recent representation,
at Botany, Sydney, of the landing of Captain
Cook. The 25 Queensland blacks (so civilised
that they actually bowed to the spectators), under
the command of a khaki-clad white man (Meston),
hurled spears at the supposed Cook’s party;
whereas, according to Cook’s own account, no
missile was used except a solitary stone, and
“ only two men came down upon the rocks to
dispute our landing, the rest having run away.”
What price that promised “ exact reproduction” ?
—H.S.
On the last night but one of the Common-
wealth rejoicings the crowd in Martin Place, Syd-
ney, was treated to an extra sensation in the stab-
bing, by one Joseph Baker, of Queensland detec-
tive Toomey. Baker, for whom the D. had been
instrumental in procuring, at Brisbane, eight
years’ imprisonment, had only been about a week
out of gaol. He was one of the prisoners released
in honor of the advent of the Commonwealth!
Baker declares emphatically that Toomey got
him convicted on a groundless charge, and in the
shambling ways of Justice such a thing is by no
means impossible. The wound is a very serious one,
and the stabber would probably have temporarily
escaped in the crowd but for the fact that, like all
the visiting detectives, Toomey was for the time
associated with a local officer—in this case Detec-
tive Brown, who promptly ran Baker down and
disarmed him of the butcher’s knife with which he
had done the deed.

“ Fortunio ” re fortune-tellers :
Predicting futurity, once one of the most honorable
professions, has degenerated with the advance of
civilisation. The fortune-tellers are now to be found in
cottages in obscure streets ; but they are still able to earn
an easy living. I one amused myself by making a series
of calls on these humble sibyls, accompanied, singly, by
three ladies. Palmistry and cards were the methods of
divination chiefly relied on by the mystery-mongers. Not
being easily gullible myself, I derived little entertainment
from the interviews ; and on their conclusion I was lost
in wonder that so much pure nonsense should command
the attention of a considerable class of people. The end
of it all was that 1 had given a great deal more informa-
tion than I had received, while I found myself, if the
diviners were to be believed, engaged to be married in
three months’ tinm to two spinsters and one widow.
Into the more shaay practices which many of the fortune-
tellers are said to indulge in I did not enquire ; but I
heard incidentally' of a married couple whose happy union
was destroy'ed by'an unluckily truthful revelation to the
wife, the seer being personally acquainted with the
amours of the husband.

ITT ZCTUIIOH
The Caee of
Mr. ROBERT GRAHAM.
(Reported fur “ The Star.”)
The increased facilities for recreation
afforded to shopkeepers and their em-
ployees under the provisions of the Early
Closing Bill are often appreciated by people
who do not come directly within the
operation of the Act. It gives “ outsiders ”
an opportunity of meeting folks e< joying a
half-holiday in the middle of the week who
are not at liberty at any other time, except
after business hours. Knowing that Mr.
.Robert Graham, of No. 11 Wattle-street,
Chippendale, was always disengaged on
Wednesday afternoons, our reporter
til ught it an opportune time to obtain an
interview in 1 elation to his indisposition,
and was rewarded by finding the gentleman
mentioned sitting on his verandah.
“I have called to ask a few question
about your illness,” began the scribe.
“ You are quite welcome to ask as many
questions ns you like, and 1 will freely
answer them.”
“ What was your complaint, and how
long were you ill ? ”
I suffered from debility, in conjunction
with indigestion, for fully two years.
I had been engaged iu sewer work for
some time, and the bad air played havoc
with my comtitui ion. My health had been
very indifferent for a long time before I
paid muc'li attention to it. a> d then it was
compulsory, for the disease had worked so
slowly and so stealthily that I did not
give in till it had mastered me completely.
I thought that the unhealthy feelings would
go away when the sewer work was finished ;
but I was greatly mistaken. I could not
go on working through the violent pains in
my head and chest, which afterwards ex-
tended, all over my body, and 1 got very
feeble in the My appetite became
fickle, and gradually died away altogether.
Anything I did succeed in getting down had
a nauseous taste, and proved quite unpalat-
able. I could not sleep well at night. I
went to bed feeling tired and weary, and
after sleeping an hour or so I had to put
m the remainder of the night wide awake.
When it was time to get up I had to drag
myself out of bed with much reluctance, not
having enough energy to dress. I could
not look at my breakfast, and would start
the day with only a cup of tea on my
e tomach. My strength gradually caved in,
as rould not take any food to sustain it,
and 1 lost all animation and vitality. Water
. u, y P rinc *pal drink, being always
thirsty. My stomach was too much upset
to allow of my taking anything else, so you
may imagine how debilitated I was. There
was not an hour of the day or night that I
could say I was free from a depressing
languidness that made me melancholy be-
yond description. A sign of my wea £ ness
was the way I used to perspire without any
exet tion. before I was taken ill I was as
hard as nails, and could do a good day’s
work without rais.ng a sweat. In ottfer
ways the debility made itself manifest,
notably by the symptoms of extreme
nervousness from which I suffered. I
used to think I had not got any nerves at
all, but now the least thing would startle
me, and set me all of a tremble. I fought
hatd against my affliction, and often forced
myself to eat when I had not the slightest
inclination for food. The result wa« usually
very disagreeable, my enfeebled dig. .tion
constantly turning on me. I expenem ed
] T’* the .boulder,
shoitly after theae forced repu.ts and it
was not long before the food came up again.
The retching involved in the operation
made n,y headaches,, from which I was
never lice, increase in violence. My
tongue was coated with a thick, slimy sub-
stance, which made my breath disagreeable.
The fellows with whom I worked used to
remark how awfully miserable I looked,
and in truth I was frightfully thin and
pale.”
“ What medicines did you take during
your illness ? ”
“I think I must have taken every
medicine under tlje sun. At all events 1
visited the hospital for six weeks, and
brought back all sorts of physic and pills,
but they did not benefit me in the slightest
degree. I did not get any relief from pain,
neither did they promote an appetite. At
the end of six weeks I gave the hospital
best, and consulted a doctor. He advised
me to take Clements Tonic. I felt rather
doubtful about his advice. After having
taken so many mixtures before, I became
very incredulous about medicines, and so I
sought the advice of another doctor, who
also recommended me to take Clements
Tonic. Without more delay I procured a
bottle, and the effect was most remarkable
I had believed that my nervousness could
not be cured by any medicine, but to my
unspeakable delight I felt my nerves more
restful in three or four days after the intro-
duction of Clements Tonic. Sound refresh-
ing sleep came back quite naturally, and
my terrific headaches were amongst the first
of my tormenting symptoms to be subdued.
Ihe bodily pains left, me one by one, and
my strength returned as my appetite got
better, thus enabling me to eat the food
that my worn-out frame so much needed
There was an entire absence of pain in the
stomach after eating, aud I was never after-
wards in doubt about my meals being
properly digested and doing their work
thoroughly. Clements Tonic restored my
bowels to healthy action, and my tongue
lost its obnoxious roughness and became
clean and sweet again. The excessive
perspiration no longer remained to remind
me of my weakness, as I became stronger
and stouter every day. I took quite a
different view of life under my altered con-
ditions, and the feelings of melancholy
troubled me no more. When I had taken four
bottles of Clements Tonicl was quite strong
again, my nerves were as sound as a bell,
and my digestion was all that I could wish it
to be.”
“Can I report these particulars in the
papers.”
‘ You may with pleasure. I owe my
restoration to health solely to Clements
Tonic, and if any people should happen to
read about my case who are suffering in the
same way they may be glad of my experience.
Publish how and when you like.”

by the shape or condition of a shoe.

never ashamed of it. One has a feeling

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
THE EA.MIOXJS IFtIESIIVBIiESIO'X" FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs ” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.
CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr..W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I beard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Severe Cough.
A FIVE YEARS’ CASE.
RELIEVED AT ONCE AND COMPLETELY CURED
BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Dear Sir. —I suffered from a severe cold on the chest,
with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit
until I used your Bronchitis Cure, which gave me relief
at once, and completely cured me. lam delighted with
it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and “can’t be licked.”—Yours sincerely,
Modewarre, Victoria. W. TREMELLEN.
A Child Seven Months Old.
A SUFFERER FROM BIRTH.
CURED BY A BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—Kindly forward me a
small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure as soon as possible,
asl cannot speak above a whisper, owing to a cold. I
had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering from
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is 3 years old, and
has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medi-
cine for bronchitis or colds of any sort.

“ Mr. Hearne. —
“ Dear Sir, —I am very much pleased with the effects
of your Bronchitis Cure. Last winter three of my chil-
dren had very bad coughs, and one bottle cured the
three of them. The housemaid also had such a severe
cold that she entirely lost her voice, but half a bottle
cured her. I always keep it in the house now, and re-
commend it to anyone requiring a medicine of that kind.
“ I now want you to send at once four bottles to Eng-
land to my mother, who is suffering greatly from bron-
chitis. The address is enclosed.

“ Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, l was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus —as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
, “ Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.”
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katupga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP' BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows":—“As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a botlle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night's rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir. —My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of Breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,
yours most respectfully,

CURED BY ONE SMALL BOTTLE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—Kindly send me one
large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. I ain more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured"my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS' CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes :—“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to tryHearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of ISB3 -15 years ago—l have
not had the sliah-est return of it. The medicine quite
cured me,‘and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
i Writing again on the 4th April, 1899, he states: —" f
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
I return of the Asthma.”

That was a “ bloomer ” about “ a latrine as big as the
average country gaol” being in course of erection in
Moore-st., Sydney. The convenience in question will be
entirely underground, leaving nothing in the street-view
but an ornamental railing and lamp-post, not occupying
much more space than one of the George-st. electric-tram
posts. About a dozen of such constructions are contem-
plated—and 10 times that number would be none too
many for a city which is at present probably the worst-
found in that respect in Christendom. And a city, too,
wherein what is elsewhere classed as “ committing a
nuisance” is outrageously magnified into a criminal
offence, punishable by flogging.

BILE BEANS possess the peculiar properties of acting on the bowels without purging
or otherwise weakening the patient. This is because the substance that relaxes the bowels
has about the same action as the natural bile. BILE BEANS are purely vegetable, and a
course of them will successfully oust the most chronic cases of piles, indigestion, chronic
headache, kidney trouble, rheumatism, constipation, and a host of other ailments that owe
their origin to defective bile flow, assimilation and digestion. These BEANS are placed on
the market in a form that anyone can take them without medical supervision, and, as the price
is so very low per large box) there are few homes that cannot afford to always have a
box on the shelf for an emergency. Obtainable at all Chemists and Storekeepers.

Talks with the Western
Farmer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Want to speak tome, do ye? I’m off to the
factory straight !
Jump in, an’ we’ll talk while I’m drivin’ —or, wait
till you shut the gate !
Right now ? Yes, it is pretty—the best of dairy-
ing land,
’An’ we’re milkin’ close on eighty cows —an’, with
hay, we’re doin’ grand.
What’s yer line? Sewing-machines, or insurin’
me life, or a book ?
Political agent ? Oh, that’s a man who looks as
he’s paid to look.
Vote on theFreetrade ticket? My son, you can’t
canvass me—
I believe in taxin’ the whole wide world, and let-
tin’ our own go free.
An’ if this our land is for Us, Protection’s the best
scheme made;
If our land’s for pauper labour in Europe, I’m
Freetrade ;
Though Freetrade’s sick in Australia —to revive
it smacks of crime—
And there’s no man born that can humbug all the
people all the time ;
And your party’s leaders use you as an election
cry,
And when your leaders get to power, they let
your party die.
Plenty of Freetrade Premiers, but no Freetrade-
duty list—
Why, Yes-No Reid, when Premier, turned a Pro-
tectionist !
Freetraders in Opposition—to cloak their censure-
vote,
But when they get to Cabinet on goes another
coat.
They weep for us “poor farmers”; but —call a
spade a spade,
And admit the Protectionists saved us—they gave
us an export trade !
We’ve got to bear the burdens—sooner or late the
bill
Comes to the man who makes the farm—not the
lawyer who makes the will.
They may talk of the duty on binders—as if that
altered it;
A State’s not run for any one class, an’ I’m ready
to pay my bit.
North they grow tea and coffee—in New South,
in ’sixty-three,
They raised cotton on the eastern slope by river-
head and sea.
For sugar to sweeten a dozen worlds they’ve lands
up north, and more ;
And the wool loads river tramps hull-down from
the plains to the Murray shore.
In little Vic. we can raise the bread for millions
of men to eat;
We can grow in its Northern and Western lands
300 miles of wheat.
A preferential duty ? Now, the talk you should
despise
Is the talk of the shoddy importer, with his
“ loyal English ” lies.
Loyalty to our fathers is best expressed this
way—
To be loyal to our children ; and Protection’s the
card to play.
I’m in butter and hay myself, and our export
chance was made
lly a fixed protectionist country —not a State of
foreign trade.
The English must be Freetraders, unless they’d
like to starve,
For an English wheat-year couldn’t give them one
week’s loaves to carve ;
But Australia’s a land on its own—unending in
resource—
And the hand that built our island home has
charted our nation’s course.
It wasn’t for nothing Australia was moored far
from the old-world din ;
And Providence fixed our policy—‘ Let all out and
nothing in! ’
(That’s if Providence understands figures—a thing
I greatly doubt—
Seems Freetraders call on him, and mostly find
him out.)
’Twasn’t for nothing Australia was set from the
Indies wake ;
She was found so late that the tardiness saved many
a grave mistake.
’Tisn’t for naught the century-birth sees our new
star arise—
'By being born so recently we’ve missed a past of
lies.
So jettison the shibboleths of governing for the
few,
And run the Government for US, and not for ME
or YOU;
And understand that a land like ours—by being
Protectionist—
Is swelling its export-strength each day, and
shorting its import-list.
We compete with old-world centres that should
beat us in every line,
And yet we send Victorian ploughs to the fields
of the Argentine.
Protection, they say, is a prison, but behind Pro-
tection’s rails
Victoria builds many engines to send to New
South Wales.
Out to the far-off Indian mills our pumping-engines
go,
And vats and batteries, shoes and heads, to the
mines of Borneo.
We’ve all the material wanted —iron for shaft
and pen—
An’ the cream of the earth for fathers—by my
land, we’ve got the men !
For your fathers, the men of the fifties—best
blood that was ever made ;
But just you see what their grandsons be if you
look at foreign-trade.
If you must be had in the buying, be had by the
man next door,
And not by the shoddy Hamburger, and the
sweater of the poor.
Protectionist and Democrat are one ! —take that
from me,
And Foreign-trade spells ‘ ‘ Tory ” with a bloated
capital T.
So leave your canvassing, sonny, and throw away
that list;
Sink foreign-trade in Bass’s Straits, and turn
Protectionist,
Self-holding—wanting help from none—that h, the
way to win !
Feed the world’s wants ! Let much go out ! but
never let much come in !
V *
Get up, George Reid, (that round : eyed moke I’m
drivin’ now near side— -
I call him Reid because he points, and never is
satisfied)
Pointer is George all over. He’d scheme for mgh
a week
To esoape a half-hour’s honest job—log-haulin
from the creek.
Bites all day at a blue gum, and strips off all the
bark;
But doesn’t use or eat it, though there’s enough
to build an ark.
Do anythin’ to be laughed at —loves a brass band
more than a feed—
But doesn’t believe in himself a bit—
. . . Get on with you, George Reid !”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Quork ! quork ! quork ! “Spud ” Moloney got
up and flung a stone across the river. “ Shoo, ye
bastes ! ” The pebble threw up a spirt of dust on
the opposite bank, where the villainous crows
dropped into the scrub. “Spud” shaded his
eyes and watched Conroy’s 16 black bullocks
bumping before a squealing dray in the bend.
Uncle Jim dangled his legs over the bank and
said that Brannigan’s Hole would make a grand
site for the Federal Capital.
“ Borrer a dredge an’ stick up a wharf, an’ ye
could have the P. and O. steamers at th’ door.
Look at that fer a site ! ” Uncle indicated a hil-
lock where Brannigan had put up a cow-shed.
“ That’s th’ sort of land ter build a Parliament on,
good rocky foundation. No fear of floods up
thear.”
Spud edged away, saying that he’d look up the
postmistress to see if there were any letters for
him—-it was about time they were sorted. “ Ever
noticed how steamed newspapers curl up in th’
hot weather, Moloney? ” asked Uncle Jim.
“ D’ye mean to say that Miss M‘Kinchy stames
the invalopes ?” A look of fear and curiosity
crept into Moloney’s face. Uncle Jim became
suddenly non-committal, and sjpoke hurriedly for
10 minutes about the inconsistencies of the Her-
man Emperor. (It is whispered that Spud has a
small whisky-still in the ranges, also that he bor-
rows Brannigan s pewter pots and converts them
into soft undersized florins and sky-blue half-
crowns ; otherwise he is considered a very quiet
man.) Uncle tore up an old newspaper and
converted it into tiny balls ; he gave me a
handful and we pitched them one by one
into the river, betting on which would first reach
the snag in the bend. In less than an hour I had
won fourpence-ha’penny. Uncle got suddenly
nasty and made biting remarks about the board-
money I owed him. Then he asked me if I in-
tended to batten on him all the days of my life ;
after which he refused to speak or bet, and finally
he brought out a half-crown, saying that he’d pay
me my winnings now. I glanced at the ingenious
coin and gave it him back. He blushed, dropped
it on a pebble, and smelt it suspiciously. “ ifou
needn’t worry about the fourpence-ha’penny,
uncle,” I said ; “ I’ll take it out in board.”
He muttered something and moved to the shade
of another tree.
The postmistress came across the flat and
walked past Uncle Jim—her chin slightly ele-
vated, her face to the south. Uncle watched her
as she descended, and frowned (he considers that
Miss M’Kinchy puts on airs and washes herself a
bit too often. Also he has complained about the
steam-washed appearance of our letters).
“Evenin,’ Miss M‘Kinchy,” he said loudly.
The postmistress gripped her skirts, turned her
hatchet face to the river, and surveyed it calmly.
‘ ‘ Evenin, ’ Miss Mac, ” reiterated uncle. 4 4 Have
yer done with my letters ? ”
The postmistress did not answer, her eyes were
fixed on the river.
“Kettle-oh,” whispered uncle mysteriously.
“ Steamer.”
Miss M‘Kinchy flinched slightly but con-
tinued to hold her skirt and survey the river.
Uncle leaned on his elbows and began to whistle
like a parrot. “Scratch Polly, steam th’
envelopes, Polly. Bit of news fer Polly. Scratch
cookie. Eeow ! ”
Miss M‘Kinchy’s hand dropped to her side
stiffly ; she spoke with her back to us as though
addressing someone on the opposite bank. “I’ll
—slap—your—face—you—beast ! ”
44 Steamer,” whispered uncle. “ Kettle-oh ! ”
“Take a bath,” said the postmistress without
turning.
A jackass filled the glen with peals of horrible
laughter.
“ Long feet.” Uncle smiled pleasantly. Miss
M‘Kinchy’s hand opened and shut; a spasm of
rage rippled her lean, inquisitive body. Clutch-
ing her skirt again she stepped to the bridge of
stones that spanned the river. In mid-stream she
paused for a moment to stare hard at the yellow
wavelets that gurgled between the slimy
boulders. “Long feet,” pursued Uncle drearily,
“Kettle-oh.”
Miss M‘Kinchy dropped her book; the leaves
opened in the water and the current moved it an
inch or so nearer the bank. She bent forward
slightly, making strokes at it with her para Sol.
“ Steamer,” whispered uncle. Pretty cocky !
Miss M'Kinchy’s foot slipped suddenly, and she
lay with one gloved hand in six inches of Castle-
reagh mud. She remained perfectly still.
Uncle’s animosity vanished. He dashed down
the embankment, squashed through half a foot of
water, and in a twinkling had the postmistress
ashore. Let it be said that she kicked in his arms
and fought desperately with her fingers. But
uncle was strangely excited and made frantic
gestures to me.
“Come here, damn ye ; can’t ye see th’lady’s
half drowned.” He laid Miss M’Kinchy on the
grass, and again she remonstrated. I ran down
and saw that he was jerking her arms backward
and forward with terrific energy.
“ Hold her head, my lad, V pull out her
tongue ; it’s th’ on’y way ter git up a circilation.”
Miss M'Kinchy bit his hand. Uncle looked at
her reproachfully.
“ Out with her tongue, my lad ; she’s swallered
half the Castlereagh, but we’ll pull her round-
we’ll git up a circilation. Hold her down, lad
and rub, rub hard.”
Uncle spat on his horny palms and proceeded
to deal with the postmistress according to the
printed rules for restoring the apparently-
drowned.
“Rub for yer life, lad ! The circilation’s a-com-
j. n ’ . listen to it-Hooray ! Out with her tongue,
’n’ mind ye don’t lose her teeth in th’ erik. I ain’t
th’ sort of cove ter let a steamed envelope stand
between me ’n’ me drowning neighbor. H's 1 h’s !
* ■ tis / Hard, lad, ’n’ out with her tongue.”
Miss M'Kiuchy gurgled a few words and bit at
him frantically, but he only worked harder and
bellowed instructions to me.
Suddenly, a big stone splashed in the river,
Aunt came hurrying down the embankment, with
a clothes-stick in her hand. Uncle Jim left the
supine body of Miss McKinehy, and hastened
towards Brannigan’s Hole to get brandy—for
himself.
A committee is forming on the Castlereagh to
present Uncle Jim with a medal for saving the
postmistress’ life,

A Dream of Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I lie on the beach day-dreaming,
And watch how the low sun’s rays
Are setting the waves a-gleaming—
Night-waves that are tramping, screaming
To pillage tha sleeping bays ;
I watoh, and a »hip conaes, seeming
To float in a blood-red blaze.
She ia laden with singers singing
Old melodies, sweet and slow,
That sound o’er the breakers swinging
To rush on the beaches ringing—
O’er songs that the breakers throw.
All thrilling and tense she’s bringing
The music of storms tuned low.
She is steered by a Sea-King’s daughter
Star-girdled and robed in mist,
And a blood-trail lies on the water—
The blood of the men who caught her
To kiss her on lips unkiss’d.
And now, as her heart lias taught her,
She sings, and I dream and list.
And skyward her song soars, pealing
To rafters of clouds and stars,
Then sinks till it quivers, stealing
Like whispers of Passion, kneeling
Entreating at Love’s locked bars.
She sings, and I see the wheeling
And march of the hosts of Mars.
Sail onward, 0 Sea-King’s daughter !
For surely are dreamers blest
Who have seen your bark oh the water—
Her prow when the sunset caught her
Was crimson as flowers that rest
On the bosom of you who brought her—
Red flowers on a snow-white breast.

III.—DAVE IN LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ploughing and sowing all over. A hundred
acres of the plain-land under wheat, and light
showers falling every week. Dad’s good luck was
continuing. Yet we were sharing other misfor-
tunes freely enough. The children were all down
with measles ; Sarah (as we now called Sal) with
face-ache; Joe with a broken rib—a draught-horse
broke it for him (Joe had sandy-blight, and one
morning approached the wrong end of the horse
to put the winkers on); and Dave was a victim to
a most fatal malady.
Dave was always the unlucky one. When he
wasn’t bitten by a snake or a dog, he was gored
by a cow or something. This time Dave was in
love. And such love ! We could see it working
in him like yeast. He became affable—smiled all
day long and displayed remarkable activity. He
didn’t care how hard he worked, or whose work he
performed. He did anything everything, and
without help. He developed a passion for small
things—trifles he had hitherto regarded with con-
tempt ; purchased silk handkerchiefs and perfume
and conversation-lollies at the store, and secreted
them in the pockets of his Sunday coat, which he
left hanging in his room; and Sarah would find
them when dusting the coat, and hawk them to
mother, and they’d spend an hour rejoicing and
speculating over the discovery. Sarah never
allowed any dust to settle on Dave s Sunday coat.
Dave went out every night. He would be on
pins and needles till supper was ready, then he d
bolt his food and rush off to saddle a horse;
and we wouldn’t see him again till breakfast-time
next morning. -
For more than a year Dave rushed on every
night. “Damme! look at that hoise!” Dad
used to say, when he’d be at the yard. Then he d
think hard, and begin again when he met mother.
“This night-work’ll have t’ stop, or there won t
be a horse about the place fit t’ ride. What the
devil the fellow wants chasing round the country
for every night X don’t know, I m sure. (Dad
knew well enough).
“ Well,”—mother would say good-naturedly—
“ you were just as bad y’self once, father. ’
“ Never, woman!” with virtuous indignation.
“ I never left a horse hanging to a fence night
after night to starve”
But there the matter always ended, and Dave
continued his courting without interruption.
It was Fanny Bowman, of Banger’s Rise, Dave
was after. She was 20, dark, fresh-complexioned,
robust and rosy—a good rider, good cook, and a
most enterprising flirt.
Tom Black, Tom Bejl, Joe Sibly, and Jim
Moore all had sought her affections unsuccessfully.
And young Cowley climbed into a loft one night
and would have executed himself on the dog-chain
because of her inconsistency, only a curlew
screeched “so awfully sudden” just outside the
door that he rushed out and fell down 16 steps and
“ injured himself internally.”
Fanny Bowman was a dairymaid—mostly neat
and natty and nice. But there were times when
she didn’t look so nice. She had frequently to go
into the yard and milk 15 and 20 cows before
breakfast ; and a glimpse at her then, especially
in wet weather, with a man’s hat on, her dress-
skirt gathered round her waist, barefooted, slush
over her ankles, slush on her arms and smeared oil
her face, wasn’t calculated to quicken a fellow s
pulse. But then it wasn’t at such times that Dave
passed judgment on her, any more than the city
swell would judge his Hetty while her hair was
on the dresser and her teeth in a basin.
Some Sundays Dave used to bring Fanny to
spend the afternoon at our place, and Jack Gore
very often came with them. Jack Gore was
Bowman’s man—a superior young fellow, so Bow-
man boasted —one that could always be depended
upon. He always took his meals with the family
and shared the society of their friends ; went to
church with them ; worked his own horse in their
plough, and was looked upon as one of the family.
Dave didn’t look upon him as one of the family,
though. He was the fly in Dave’s ointment;
Dave hated him like poison.
When it would be time to leave, Dave had
almost to break his neck to reach Fanny’s side in
time to lift her into the saddle ; if he was a moment
late Gore would lift her into it. If he were slow at
all in mounting his horse Gore would coolly ride
off with Fanny ; if lie didn’t happen to be slow
in mounting Gore w-ould ride on the near side of
her and monopolise the conversation. He mono-
polised it in any case. _ i
Mother and Sarah used to talk about J ack
“If 7 were Dave,” Sarah would say, “ I’m blest
if I’d have her carrying on with him the way she
does.” . . ,
“ But Fannjr only means it as a sister, mother
would answer in palliation.
‘ ‘ Docs she indeed ! . . . Dave’s an old fool to
bother about her at all, if y’arsk me ! ”
Sarah was developing a keen interest.
* * * *
Jack Gore left Bowman’s service one morning.
He left it suddenly. Bowman sacked him, and
Mrs. Bowman talked to the neighbors about him
with the wrath of an insulted mother.
“The cheek of him’’—she said to mother— to
think he was good enough for Fanny ! Why, we
wouldn’t have kept him a day if we d thought it
we’d even dreamt. Fanny, indeed !”
But she spoke highly of Dave. She moved
mother to tears of admiration for him. And
mother couldn’t resist telling Dave all that was
said. Dave went to Bowman’s a little earlier that
night—but returned quite unexpectedly and went
to bed in a bad humour.
A change came over Dave. He ceased to smile,
and scarcely did any work, and never brought
Fanny to see us on Sundays. At last Dave met
Fanny on her way to the railway-station one day,
and when he came home he went straight to the
album and took out her photo, and jumped on it.
Jack Gore had been away from Saddletop for
several months, when “Girls are more of a
trouble than boys,” Mrs. Bowman said despond-
ingly to mother, one evening, at the gate. Boys
are nothing; they can always take care of them-
selves, but girls I—” and she shook her head.
* ♦ * *
Jack Gore returned to Bowman’s, one day, and
neither Bowman nor Mrs. Bowman attempted to
chase him away. Work was suspended for 24
hours, and at mid-day a tired, dust-covered parson
came to their door astride of a poor horse, and got
down and married Jack Gore to Fanny.
It was a quiet wedding. , „ ,
When they heard of it Mother and Sarah
whispered things to one another, and Dad
thought of Dave. ,
“Thank God 1” he said, “th’ horses 11 have a
chance ter get fat now.”
Q.
STEELE RUDD.
“ (joronella ” on death-under-chloroform :
Dear Bulletin.— Be deaths under chloroform and
medico “ Puyyaka’s” remarks on same. As chloroform
and ether both prove to be more or less—principally
more i_dangerous to patients, why not try operations
without any anaesthetic in the ordinary form, and instead
of inhaling chloroform or ether in the ordinary way, let
cocaine be injected into the spinal canal, which, accord-
intr to American authorities, renders the patient, as men-
tioned by “Puyyaka,” absolutely insensible to pain,
though otherwise entirely conscious.
Hon on a man’s leg, the patient was able to lift said
limb which was being amputated, and otherwise assist
the doctors. Of course every patient might not like to
see a surgeon cutting him up, but many people would
prefer a safe anaesthetic which deadens pain without
depriving them of consciousness while an operation is
being performed, to the more risky chloroform or ether.
Dr Tufier, in a paper read before the International Medical
Association, held in Paris in Aug., 1900, reported 130 opera-
tive cases from his clinic, in all of which the subarachnoid
inlecUon ofTocaine was successfully used without one
adverse case being reported. Some of the patients held up
the stumps of their legs while the operator tied up the
arteries, and others rendered useful assistance to the
operator. Insensibility to pain endures for about an hour
or 70 min., such time being generally ample for the worst
and most delicate operations. It is said that no after-
effects, save, perhaps, sleeplessness in some patients
during the first night after the operation, have manifested
themselves. Unlike ether or chloroform cocaine does
not, it is claimed, at all depress the patient.
Concerning which “Puyyaka” :
The new American method of. producing insensibility
to pain by means of cocaine injected into the spinal
canal seems to be a step in the , d } rect ™ °*
anesthetic, but it needs much trial.
Hons the medical journals speak well of the results
obtained, and for the past year the subject has been
under discussion. The main advantage of such a net
lies, not in any “assistance” which the patient can
afford to the surgeon, but in the greater facility with which
on-comingbad effects can be detected and po»«Wy avertecL
The abolition of consciousness produced y e
general anesthetic debars the administrator from the
warnings afforded by the patients persona sensa 10 ,
and renders it necessary for him to be constantly on th
watch for complications which have actually arisen. O
the other hand, a strong sl.m.nt of risk exists, in this
particular in.tanc, from th. “cocaine idiosyncrasy.
Ther« i. a c.rtaln p.rc.ntag. of p.rwns upon whom th.
smallest doiM of cocaine .x.rt a powerfully poisonous
effset in th. most rapid and d " con °f t r h h,l J h / o ft r , (J l Jo rn i
A similar t>«cuUaritv n found with cnioioiorm
and certain olfr drugs-even foods and scents m some
instances—but the writer does not know ot tne exis
tence of any recorded cases of the kind in connection
with ether. Such subjects are not rare Not very
long ago writer had occasion to apply a solution ot
cocaine to a man’s throat, the
ing one-tenth of the pharmacopoeial dose, ®" d o is on .
promptly exhibited strong evidences o£ A
ing reauiring extremely energetic remedial measures. A
number of deaths are recorded from this
cracv and many medical men have had more or less
startling experiences of the kind. A further danger les
in the act of injection. It is not easy to aeo, J r in-
sert a needle into the spinal canal, and a small deviation
from a correct line, or the presence of anatomical pecuh-
arity, might result in serious injury to the spinal cold.
The introduction of the tiniest particle of sept
material into the spinal canal, m °^
be attended with the gravest conscqaeiices.Manypeopc
dread a simple hypodermic injection, and the pain of the
necessary deep puncture might upset a patient to a
dangerous degree when superadded on the ., de PJ?®® lo " jfu
an extensive operation. Taking one consideration with
another therefore, writer is of opinion that sub-
arachnoid injection of cocaine is not going to supplant
ether or even chloroform for general anesthetic use.
There have not yet been sufficient examples for a correct
comparison to be made, but unless the action of cocaine
is altered in the spinal canal (which is not at all probable)
the risk is at least fully equal to that of J th ® r^X'a Uon
hazards attendant on the process of administration
further outweigh its advantages. Thcoreboanythedea
is very good indeed, hut from a practical standpoint
writer prefers to stick to ether as the best and safest
anaesthetic at present obtainable for general use.
Concerning the Ormond Professorship of
Music at Melb. University :
After nearly half-a-year’s bitter fighting the Marshall-
Hall business seems to be as far fiom settlement as ever.
The Hallites, to atone for their initial blunder in tactics,
are fighting with the determination of De Wet, and their
dogged stand has had the effect of causing a waver in the
Oalvinistic opposition. To start with a meeting of the
University Council was held, at which there was a
majority favorable to the r.-appointment of Hall. Shrewd
Scotchbyt.rian Dr. M'Farland, however, asked whether
the Prof, had been consulted, and, eliciting a denial,
bluffed the council into an adjournment. The fiery cross
of bigotrv wae then sent round ; councillors who never
attended once in a blue moon were rounded up ; old
Bishop Goe suddenly reversed the position he took up at
the first meeting, and it was decided to invite applica-
tions for a successor to Marshall-Hall. Then was intro-
duced the pious party’s best hanky-panky. Agent-
General Clarke would not have removed Hall’s name
from the list of applicants in London without some very
strong direction, and to identify the person or persons
who lent that direction, and expose them as sneaks
and liars, should be the first duty of the Council.
To day the position is an extraordinary one Franklin
Peterson (Sargood’s cousin, be it remembered) has been
appointed to the Chair of Music. Since then he has re-
ceived a cable from the anti-Hallites telling him in effect
it is all right. On top of this the council has cabled
informing! hiXt the position regarding the Conserve
torium is nebulous, and that Hall will probably continue
it and run Melb. music as heretofore. Finally, the Pro-
fessors of the University send him a third cable calculated
to scire any man off taking up a .post where he would
undoubtedly be unwelcome. If Peterson is wise, he will
to teach his pupils of the Edinburgh Ladies’ College.
If to come to Melb., he will find himseh clean
out of it, for there is not the slightest doubt that Ha l
dominates the music of the Southern city. Peterson will
have some wild triumphant cheering from the Presby-
terian assembly and similar bodies, but all the music he
will ever have to do will be an occasional tune on the
church organ. The Conservatonuin will continue to be
the centre of music in Melbourne : the University will be
about as prominent in that line as I itzGibbon is in the
making of odes. [A late cable states that Mr. Peterson is
now on his way to Melbourne.]
