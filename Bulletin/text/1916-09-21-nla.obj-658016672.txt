Two Serious Humorists
Stephen Leacock is a humorist who can’t
help being humorous when he’s serious. He
deliberately tries to erase the memory of his
Nonsense Novels and his Sunshine Sketches
of a Little Town by the composition
o,f a book of Essays and Literary Studies
(Lane, per Dymock’s, Sydney) ; he has
serious and important things to say
about modern learning, modern morality,
literature and education in America, Ameri-
can humor, the woman question, the plight
of the schoolmaster ; and even when discuss-
ing O. Henry or the American humorists, he
is pedantically careful not to quote any too
glaring examples of humor; hut into all these
solemn subjects Stephen Leacock cannot pre-
vent his humor insidiously leaking. He re-
marks that: “The vacuum-cleaner can never
take the place of the housewife. It cannot
replace the mother. No man ever said his
prayers at the knees of a vacuum-cleaner,” a
perfectly-trutkful statement, an indispensable
part of his serious argument, hut put in a
manner that precludes serious acceptance.
And in mentioning the obvious facts that the
woman’s vote and total prohibition are two
things that are moving across the map with
gigantic strides, and that prohibition is going
to be recorded as one of the unforeseen re-
sults of the war, he canuot refrain from add-
ing : “When the King of England decided that
the way in which he could best help the
country was by giving up drinking, the ad-
mission was fatal. It will stand as one of
the landmarks of British history comparable
only to such things as the signing of
Magna Charta by King John, or the serving
out of rum and water instead of pure rum in
the British Navy under George III.” And
he goes lightly on to this prophecy: “Before
many years are past, all over this continent
women with a vote and men without a drink
will stand looking at one another and won-
dering what next?”
The result is a most entertaining book.
Stephen Leacock administers his -truths so
gaily and so glibly that his readers hardly
know r they have swallowed them. Indeed,
some uneasy reviewers have even suspected
that when Leacock proclaims his belief that
in O. Henry the world will soon recognise
“one of the great masters of modern litera-
ture,” the essayist is merely pulling their
legs. Either those critics have not read O.
Henry, or have failed to understand Stephen
Leacock’s reasons for appreciating that
author. In another essay Leacock parodies
Dickens, and his parody is nearly as dull as
Dickens —hut then Stephen Leacock appar-
ently likes Dickens, too. He must have au
extraordinarily catholic faculty of apprecia-
tion —O. Henry and Dickens.
A. S. Neill, author of A Dominie’s Log
(Jenkins, 2s. 6d.), is another serious, man
who can’t help being humorous. Neill is
evidently the ideal school-master, a peda-
gogue after Jimmie Pannikin’s own heart.
The bitter farce of machine-made education
of which this dull adult world is the dreary-
result is maybe in the slow process of being
humanised for our cliildreu ; but our schools
have a long way to go before they become
ideal. A Dominic's Log adumbrates that
ideal: this delightful work should be pre-
scribed as the text-book for all teachers’ ex-
aminations, and no personage should be
allowed in an Education Dept, who did not
know it off by heart. For this serious book,
written with a Barrie-like humor, is full of
the finest wisdom. And his school-kiddies are
surely the luckiest kiddies in the world. The
tremendous thought comes that perhaps one
of those kiddies might grow up to become a
Minister for Education for the Empire.
Hardly likely, though ; for one recalls Mar-
garet Steel, the bright little girl of his class.
“Poor Margaret! When she is 14 she will
go out to the fields, and in three years she
will be an ignorant country bumpkin.... At
the age of 14 she is free to go to the Devil —
the, factory or the herding.” .
The book will be read and talked about as
“a funny book.” A. S. Neill can’t help being
“funny”; hut he is funny in this way:
“Every human being has something of the
gruesome in his composition; the murder
cases are the most popular readings in our
press. I want to direct this innate desire for
gruesome things to the realising of the most
gruesome things in the world —the grinding
of soul and body iu order to gain profits, the
misery of poverty and cold, the wnariness of
toil. If our press really wants to make its
readers shudder, why does it not publish long
accounts of infant mortality in the slums, of
gin-fed bairns, of back-doors used as fuel, of
phthisical girls straining their eyes over
seams? I know why the press ignores these
things, the public does not want to think of
them. If the public wanted such stories
every capitalist owner of a newspaper would
supply them, grudgingly, but with a stern
resolve to get dividends.”
Luckily, those of us who have known the
drudgery of the ordinary schooling can go to
A. S. Neill’s school for the price of his
book. There is no discipline, except self-
discipline, there; and the dominie sets the
most entrancing questions for his class.
Which of us in our school exams, was ever
asked “to write a humorous dialogue between
a brick and the mongrel dog it came in
contact with.” or was ever asked whether,
and why, Burns is greater than Harry
Lauder, or what Burns would have
thought of the prevalence of the kilt
among the Semitic inhabitants of Scot-
land? Still, Neill’s own school-days had
their delights, and what was good he is
careful to restore: “The Inspectors refuse
to allow teachers to use slates nowadays on
the ground that they are insanitary. To-day
I reintroduced slates to all classes. My
one reason was that my bairns were missing
one of the most delightful pastimes of youth
—the joy of making a spittle run down the
slate and back again.”
Savage Verses by Rupert Brooke
Menelaus and Helen.
I.
Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke
To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate
On that adulterous whore a ten years'
hate
And a king's honor. Through red death., and
smoke,
And cries, and then by quieter ways he
strode,
Till the still innermost chamber fronted
him.
He swung his sword, and crashed into the
dim
Luxurious bower, flaming like a god.
High sat white Helen, lonely and serene.
He had not remembered that she was fair,
And that her neck curved down in such a
way;
And he felt tired. He flung the sword away,
And kissed her feet, and knelt before her
there,
The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.
11.
So far the poet. Hoio should he behold
That journey home, the long connubial
years?
He does not tell you hoio white Helen
bears
Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,
Haggard with virtue. Menelaus bold
Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred
Troys
'T-wixt noon and supper. And her golden
voice
Got shrill as he grew deafer. And both were
old.
Often he wonders why on: earth he went
Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came.
Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;
Her dry shanks tivitch at Paris’ mumbled
name.
So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
And Paris slept on by Scamander side.
A Channel Passage.
The damned ship lurched and slithered.
Quiet and quick
My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled;
I knew
I must think hard of something, or be side;
And could think hard of only one thing—
you!
You, you alone could hold my fancy ever! _
And with you memories come, sharp pain,
and dole.
Now there's a choice —heartache or tortured
liver!
A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!
Do I forget you? Retchings twist and tie
me,
Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up
I throw,
Do I remember? Acrid return and slimy,
The sobs and slobber of a last year’s woe.
And still the sick ship rolls. 'Tis hard, I
tell ye,
To choose ’twixt love and nausea, heart find
belly.
■ Jealousy.
When I see you, who were so wise and cool,
Gazing with silly sickness on that fool
You’re given your love to, your adoring
hands
Touch his so intimately that each under-
stands,
1 know, most hidden things; and when I
know
Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid boro
Of his red lips, and that the empty grace
Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy
face
Has beaten your heart to such a flame of
love,
That you have given him every touch and
move,
Wrinkle and Secret of you, all your life,
— Oh! then I know Pm waiting, lover-wife,
For the great time when love is at a close,
And all its fruit to watch the thickening
nose
And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,
That are yours, and you, most surely, till
you die!
Day after day you'll sit with him and note
The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;
As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to
fat,
And love, love, love to habit!
And, after that,
When all that’s fine in man is at an end,
And you, that loved young life and clean,
must tend
.1 foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old.
When his rare lips hang flabby and cant
hold
Slobber, and you're enduring that worst
thing,
Senility's greasy furtive love-making,
And searching those dear eyes for human
meaning,
Propping the bald and helpless head, and
cleaning
A scrap that life's flung by, and love’s for-
gotten,—
Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and
rotten ;
And he'll be. dirty, dirty!
O lithe and free
And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to
sec.
That's how I'll see your man and yon! —
But you —■
Oh, when that time comes you'll be dirty
too!

Australian
The Westrulia Gift Book, in aid of the
Y.M.C.A. and' the Returned Nurses’ Fund
(V- K. Jones, Perth), is remarkable value
for half a crown. The big bbok is written
and illustrated entirelv by Westralians; the
level of the letterpress is higher than that of
the black-and-white; hut though neither can
venture on a comparison with the product of
Eastralia, the difference does no discredit
to the West. The satisfactory thing revealed
by this volume is the number of Westralian
writers who can turn out readable stories
and passable verse, though in their illustra-
tion there is a certain degree of crudity. The
make-up of the volume would hardly pass
muster with the East’s more exacting stan-
dards of book-production; and the editors
confess that for the reproduction of their
color-blocks, with which the book is-liberally
supplied, they have had to go to other States.
But this page’s necessary criticism does not
imply any hint of patronage. The West has
this advantage over the East: it is younger.
Margaret Scot, the author of The Angel
Beneath the Cross (Specialty Press, Melb.),
asks for a referendum on the question
whether she will-publish the other two parts
of the complete work, or “for ever after this
hold my peace.” This page votes for peace
at any price. The first part consists of 884
pages of adventures in the after-life, with
full details of the dress materials worn by
angels and the fashions in the hereafter. The
first angel wears “what would be called a
walking dress, just reaching to the ankles.
.... The neck had a small dark band around
the throat, trimmed with a very narrow lace
showing about half an inch above the band.
.... On her feet were shoes made of paper,
with soles of a material which was actually
w 7 ood, not wood in its natural state, but
ground and subjected to hydraulic pressure.
....The paper....does not crease, or draw
the feet. . . .The stockings, which could he
seen a little higher than the ankles, were
slate-colored and very fine.” Margaret men-
tions also that the men she met in the after-
life were dressed in tweed of a light color.

A bloke named Charles F. Forshaw has
founded, on Iris own. “The International
Institute of British Poetry,” at Bradford,
England. He explains that this Institute
“has long been with me a cherished institu-
tion”; but lack of leisure has hitherto pre-
vented him giving it practical form. _ How-
ever, he has now succeeded in engaging an
organising secretary, at the tremendous sal-
ary of £lO2 per annum (payable from the
funds of the Institute), and presumably the
affair is in full working order. Anyhow,
'it has already got a seal, and it is being
incorporated as a Learned Society at a cost
of £55. A list of already elected Fellows is
forwarded, among the names of which there
is not one single poet or literary critic
known to this page; while the absence of
well-known names of poets and critics would
fill several pages,. However, Charles F.
Forshaw compensates. Tiie Literary
Year Book gives him as the author of
Thoughts in the Gloaming, Tobacco! Is it
Injurious? (10 editions), Masonic M usings,
Tributes to Queen Victoria, Poems on
Salisbury. Marquis of, Coronation Odes,
Tributes to Irving. Masonic Poems, Dental
Jottings, Poetical Tributes to King Edward
VII., Pearls of Poesy and Masonic Sonnets.
Forshaw doesn’t need an Institutehe is a
whole Institute of British Poetry himself.
Somebody in a Canadian magazine lias
submitted iiis list of the “six worst books.”
He chooses: The Doctor's Dilemma (Shaw)
for “the veneer of sophistication which sur-
rounds its essentiallly vicious core” ; Mem-
oirs of My Dead Life (George Moore),
because “the great trouble with George
Moore is that he is a bounder. He is a
rotter, cursed with the gift of writing”; The
Genius (Theodore Dreiser) for its “‘natural-
ism’ which prefers to view life only through
the leper-squint of the licentious”; The
Leopard's Spots (Thomas Dixon), “a terri-
ble example of ‘yellow’ literature”; Confes-
sions of a Barbarian (George S. Viereclc).:
“justice compels one to admit that this
hyphenated American lias the facility of the
bi-linguist and the nervous alertness of the
Surf Avenue puller-in never sure of his
crowd” —whatever that may mean; and
Three Weeks (Elinor Glyn) : “the leading
example of this new-fangled servant-girl type
of fiction, which, of course, must be full of
Art and Ygh Life.” It will be noted that
three of the worst novels are American.
Hardly a convincing list. One wonders if
there are in Australian fiction six books bad
enough to be acclaimed the worst?
_ M. R. Walker’s Poems, Heal and Imagina-
tive (G. Hassell, Adelaide, for Red Gross
funds), are chiefly blank and geographical.
She depicts in an easy—rather too easy-
blank verse aspects of Tasmanian and South
Australian scenery. The picture of Darling-
ton Cemetery, Maria Island, is delicately
painted, beginning:—
A little churchyard stands upon the hill,
And lonely graves, and half a broken fence;
When last I wandered there the daffodil
Flung to the ruins its sweet recompense....
A pretty little water-color in verse. Her
iove-verse is of the same simplicity, pleasant
but too refined for passion. She has nothing
new to say, but says it iu a nicely-modulated
voice. Her ouality may be best seen in this
upon “Gallipoli, 1915” :
The years make whole, and the far ..Egean awash
Heals the shell-torn-beaches, and over the hills
Spring is renewed.
There rest the dead, Australia's loved and mourned
With the swift grief that sent her other sons.
O’er those heights
Gazing to Imbros in the western sea,
Glimmered the light in that undying dawn—
The Landing; and the sheer holding on
Riddled the hills for eight grim months with death.
Anzae was paid for. When the bitter winds
Hurried the last dim transport from the shore,
And on the abandoned beach the smouldering fires
Flamed in -the distance Mice a sacrifice —-
’Twas left the world to judge Gallipoli.
Butters and the Bunn
Butters and “Bellerive” .have been unduly
monopolising the national ice-chest. There
are others, including John Jones, “The
Welsh poet,” whose “Australian Brave and
all the British Dominion” can be had for Id.
There are many men in Australia to-day, left mother,
children, wife and pap,
Went down to Egypt to fight the Turks and got them
safely in their trap.
They volunteered without a growl or squeal,
And were called to the Fort of Dardanelles, and made
many Turks die upon the battlefield.
This patriotic strain culminates in liis final
verse.:—
1 hope the old Kaiser will be caught, and hung up
by the toes,
And his eyes, ears and nose, will be eat up by the
raving crows....
“Hamer” mentions two other major poets:
“Anonymous” of the historical school of
poesy, and P. F. Collins, an Australian Ezra
Pounds. The first published two books of
poems “by Anonymous”; and sent a copy of
one hook in his own name to the King and
published the gracious reply in the second
edition. lie was eminently loyal to Edward
Vtl.: —*
, The King of England stricken low
With ’pendieitis ! —grave disease!
i But now our hearts have found release. ....
“Anonymous” suffered from the lack of
appreciation of the poetic art in this con-
tinent. He adds this footnote to his own
Commonwealth Ode:—■
“This poem was submited to the Common-
wealth Competition, hut for reasons best
known to themselves they selected another
ode.” One would like to know those rea-
sons, for this Ode contains these immortal
lines :
See, she comes! borne by her emus
Led by bounding kangaroos
On she comes! Can any refuse
To dedicate to her his muse.
P. F. Collins’s latest masterpiece deals
with “Six O’Clock Closing—A Thirsty Soul’s
Lament”: of which this is the rousing
chorus: —-
800-00-00, what on earth shall we do,
If we can’t get a whisky or beer,
When after tea we stroll down the town,
i..haling the night’s atmosphere?
And “Bart” hands us the Maoriland Bunn.
In Australia, Butters (Red Page, 10/8/’l6) ; in
Maoriland, Bunn. The very names are prophetic of
the feast their works provide. I’ve just discovered
this bun, and, having devoured it, feel like stout Mr.
■Cortez on a peak in Darien. James Harry Bunn is
the author of The Mystic Mantle; or, the Demon
Spider and the Angel Ply; “a grand, spectacular
drama in two acts; a tragedy that ends in a
triumph.” The book contains 260 pages, gilt-edged,
bound in full red leather. There are only 100
copies, and the author states that “as these are not
all for sale the supply cannot possibly equal the
demand.” The frontispiece is a “Copyright Photo-
graph” of “The Author at work. This remarkable
picture was taken in the very act of writing this
work.” Mr. Bunn is his own publisher, biographer,
annotator, interpreter, and —reviewer. These func-
tions occupy a third of the book. Over-worked critics
will especially welcome the innovation which con-
sists of appendices wherein the author reviews his
own work. Some extracts from this section: “It [the
play] is highly satirical in a dainty and delightful
manner.... It does not beg the attention of the audi-
ence, it commands it.. . .People have said there is a
strong Shakspearian influence... .and I think they
are right.... The play....will create a world-wide
sensation when staged, and bring _a fortune to all
with it.” True genius is always sure of
’itself. This master-poem was composed on the top
of Mt. Victoria, Wellington, M.L., where the author
(when his duties as ship’s steward permitted) used to
lie under a bush and “take down whatever the Gods
would send” him. In Greece, Mt. Parnassus; in
Maoriland, Mt. Victoria. Now for a bite or two from
the play itself. In one scene a dead stockbroker, re-
incarnated as a monstrous Spider, tries to kiss a
Maid. He, or it. “catches her and holds her in a
close embrace.” She resists.
Maid: I’ll not submit.
I don’t like you a little bit... .
Spider : By power of Hell, I have you now!
Maid (almost freeing herself): No, Monster, no!
Not yet, I vow 1
Spider : Once iii my little Parlor, Fly, 111
consume you 1 t
Maid ( bursting into tears ) : I die ! I die!....
However she escapes. Later on she laments a dead
sister in a beautiful lyric beginning:—
The one I miss is little Sis,
The pride of my dear Mater,
She left me here, to miss her dear,
And her perambulator.
These currants are picked at random from the bun.
It was published in Wellington in 1913, and copies
may he obtained at 123 Broad Street, Reading, Eng.,
at the bargain price of £5 each, only £5. Order
early—the supply cannot possibly equal the demand.

1 Self-Loading
Rifles
.32, .35, .351 and .401
Calibers
Winchester Self-Loading rifles
are not cumbersome, compli-
cated or unsightly, but simple,
handsome and well-balanced
guns. Their use permits rapid
shooting with great accuracy and
on account of the novelty and ease
of their operation, they add much
to the pleasure of rifle shooting
either at target or game. For hunt-
ing game which is generally shot on
the run, a Winchester Self-Loading
rifle is particularly handy and effective.
The four different calibers in which this
type of Winchester is made are suitable
for hunting all kinds of game, the cart-
ridges they use being of the most modern
type, giving excellent penetration and great
shocking effect. If you are going to buy a
rifle look over the Winchester Self-Loaders.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fire Song.
I have fed my heart with the husks
Who- longed for the angel-bread ;
I held my hands for a star
And found a taper instead.
The taper bent in my hands,
Then, guttering down, expired ;
And I who was quick and young
Stood strangely sad and tired.
I dreamed I would hear a song,
Fashioned in strength and pride,
YV ould surge through each sleeping depth
As the swell of a mighty tide;
And I heard but a fumbling hand
On a keyboard out of tune—
The song that my soul desired
Was scarcely a single rune.
I lifted my hand for a sword
That would flash in the air and sing
As it cleft the way, on guard for me,
Swifter than wind and wing;
But I found I had only a haft,
Broken, and rusted of mould;
And I who had felt as a giant
Was, suddenly, oh, so old!
I gathered them all together,
The husk, the song and the haft,
And bound them in with the taper
Whose light was scarcely a shaft;
And I stand in the desert they made me,
A harp with a single string.
For ever and ever rebelling,
In spite of them all, I sing.

Oh, to die in green September when the
Spring is coming in !
Still he lies, while at his window bird and
bloom and breeze begin.
No! be silent lest, although he gives no sign
to us, he hears
Through the sound of sudden rain,
Through the blackbirds note again,
Tears, ah tears!
Surely, surely he who loved them feels the
wak’ning wind, and sees
Farth and sky, and smells the perfume of
the white pittosporum trees;
Lest his new-found soul be sleeping let us
throw the window wide
That it wake, and strange and fleet,
Joyous may go forth to meet
Spring outside.

Love. I will give you roses —-
A ill strew them on your bed—-
Rich with the hues of passion,
Sweet-scented, fair and red.
But no white rose among them:
The dear white rose, is dead.
M-
I watch your white breast stirring
Where laces fall apart,
Your rich, warm lips aquiver,
And love you with my heart.
But the sweet white rose is withered;
Its loss has left a smart.
In dark curls on your pillow
Soft spreads your scented hair;
Red roses match its beauty
And I will place them there.
But will you wonder, waking—
No white rose anywhere?
White roses once I gave you,
And they with thoughts were wed
That now have all been cninsoned
By passion, warm and, red ;
Regret must stir within me
For those white roses dead.

The Spirit Touch.
Down in tlie narrow lanes of life
By the iron gate where the world takes toll.
There came, like the sweep of a sky-bound
wing,
Bike a note of music when seraphs sing,
A touch on my listening soul.
And it struck a chord on the harp of life,
A chord that the hills will keep for me,
A note so glad that my heart grew young,
For it was free as a moor-wind’s tongue
And brave as a leaping sea.
The voice, and words that have touched a
soul
Are silent now, and a page is turned ;
But the music lives in my life to-day
As incense still in a shrine will stay
Where an altar lamp lias burned.

O Night, that art so spacious, cool and

Soothing with velvet hands the wounds of

Till heart and soul are healM of thy balm!
All the day’s stress and turmoil fade away—
The thoughts of the revenge that was to be—
On the soft breeze that flutters o’er the bay,
Ripples and flutters from the circling sea •
As if Christ leaned and breathed upon the
earth
Infinite sighs of His vast charity.
And dark hate dies, and golden love has
birth
In the soul-furrows, fertile of thy halm.
O night, that art so spacious, cool and calm !

The Story of the Lamp
l
Amongst the Ancient Greeks,
950 B.C.
In the Greece that Homer has immortal-
ised in verse, lamps were in regular use, for
the bard sings of a “Festival of Lamps.” The
Lamps of Ancient Greece, were made of
pottery or metal. Grecian maidens used to
set lighted lamps before the oracles when
they wished to consult them. Whilst this
custom no longer prevails, the trimming and
care of her lamps is an important part of
many a housewife’s duties.

WANTED: A NATIONAL CABINET.
Australia is right up against the biggest
national decision it has yet been called to
make. Even the casting of the votes which
brought the scattered States into a Common-
wealth was at any rate less urgent. The
Australian electorate is required to give its
voice whether its citizens shall be liable to
compulsory service in the great European
war; and, with civilisation still on the
defensive and the strength of Germany still
unbroken, it ought to be easy to forecast the
Commonwealth’s reply. Unfortunately, how-
ever, the crisis has arrived at a moment when
the issue is enormously clouded and com-
plicated, and when the possible effect of the
public vote may be quite different from
anything the voters intend. The great
majority of the people unquestionably favor
the exertion by the Commonwealth of the
utmost force available to bring the war to a
satisfactory close. But the Yes or No at
the ballot-box is not merely a vote for or
against conscription for foreign service.
Unless existing arrangements are altered, the
carrying of the so-called Referendum implies
the continuance in ofiice of the present Gov-
ernment and the handing over to it of a
bigger job than any it has yet tackled. Taking
the whole circumstances as they stand, and
reviewing the history of the past year as
far as we have been allowed to know it, the
question at the back of every Australian
mind is. Can we trust this Government with
the further work of national organisation i
# * * * *
Let us. as dispassionately as we may,
consider the position and constitution of the
body of men in whose hands we are asked
to place this great trust. At the head of
the Ministry is a politician whose recent
actions, viewed in the kindest possible light,
must still be described as noisy, erratic and
irresponsible. Behind him, holding portfolios,
are a number of men of whom some believe
in the principle of Conscription and others
are violently opposed to it. Behind these
again is the divided Parliamentary caucus
wherein some of the fiercest opponents of
compulsory service have a say and Vote.
Behind these, again, are the unofficial but
powerful Labor bodies, breathing forth
threats of sudden destruction and excom-
munication against any representative of
their cause who does not repudiate the entire
idea for which the official head of the party
pleads. In the plainest of plain terms, this
means that if a vote for compulsory service
abroad is carried at the so-called Referen-
dum, the putting into effect of that vote will
be entrusted to men whose coat-tails are
being pulled by circles of other men who
detest the very thought of the thing, and
their coat-tails in turn are being tugged still
more forcefully by other and ever-widening
outer circles whose hate of the proposal is
little short of venomous. Further, the
Referendum on questions other than the
alteration of the Constitution has not been
provided for in that Constitution; and the
result of the public vote in this instance is
in no real sense binding upon the Federal
Parliament, of whose members in both
Houses a large number are strong anti-con-
scriptionists. That Parliament must be
swayed by the vote is evident, but that an
expression of popular opinion not legally bind-
ing should be given effect to in spirit as well
as in letter by those who believe it a crime
is asking a little too much.
* * * *
The constitutional road out of the difficulty
is a general election. Even if the present
Ministry had all the needed ability, zeal and
discretion, it could not work effectively with
its hands tied, and the threat of the party
axe over its head. Indeed, no leader with
anything like a statesmanlike view of the
situation would attempt to hold office under
such conditions, much less ask the people for
the authority to attack an impossible task.
Yet it is evident that if the people now
refuse such authority to the present Govern-
ment, the latter will have succeeded in cut-
ting the ground from under the feet of any
other Government which may desire to take
up the task in the future. Moreover, the
word will have been sent out to the ends of
the earth that Australia has refused to fur-
ther aid the Allies in their great effort to
save civilisation, while the real meaning of
the vote may be no more than a profound
distrust of W. M. Hughes and his party
machinery. On the other hand, the holding
of a general election in the present state of
parties must almost certainly be a futility.
The voters will not go to the polls with this
one great question in their minds. Looking
the thing squarely in the face, then, we seem
to have been led by our absurd party system
to a point of crisis which may very readily
become a point of national calamity. The
anti-conscriptionists are in earnest; so are
the conscriptionists. There is no ground of
compromise possible. Between the two is the
futility of party- —A futility armed with very
real power. Some sort of smash seems in-
evitable, and what the citizen has to con-
sider is whether it may not be better to
smash on the rock of inaction than to add to
the force of that party futility by allowing
it to muddle away what is left of Australia’s
fighting strength. Conscription, badly
handled, might so disgust the people with the
very name that in days to come a free
citizenship would take its lickings lying down
rather than rise in sober and ordered defence
of its home.
* * * *
The practical question to be answered is:
“How can we in safety vote Yes?” How can
we best assure ourselves that Conscription
will be administered with reasonable under-
standing and sympathy? Nothing is plainer
than that this is not an old-party matter.
Yet it has aroused more rancor than any
matter which has divided Australian parties
heretofore. To this paper it seems,- there-
fore. clear that, in this crisis, parties ought
to readjust themselves. Nothing much
matters now except the winning of this war ;
and if we must divide, the natural division
for the present is as to the method of winning
it. That Hughes should be compelled to
attempt to effectuate Conscription with a
Ministry which is violently anti-conscription-
ist in part, and is maintained at the polls by
those who are even more violently anti-con-
scriptionist. is as preposterous as it would
be for the Protectionists, after a referendum,
to hand over the construction of a tariff to
a coterie of importers, and scarcely less pre-
posterous than it would be to hand over the
conduct of the Allies’ campaign to a mixed
Anglo-Franco-Turco-German staff.
AN INVITATION TO AUSTRALIA TO
HOBBLE ITSELF.
Those people who dream of a British Empire
riveted' together by the terms of an Imperial
Constitution are not allowing the war to
come between them and their visions. Some
of them have grown busier than ever. Their
propaganda is being pushed with discreet
vigor. Plentiful seeds are being sown in
likely-looking ground such as Maoriland,
and one of the sowers is now in Australia
placing his books and speeches and organis-
ing abilities at the disposal of those
associations of men and women whose
object it is to promote a closer Imperial
unity. They are very fortunate in their
organiser. lie is Lionel Curtis, a public
official in South Africa for many years and
one of the foremost advocates of the Union.
Naturally, being what he is, he is not
travelling wholly on a wild yell. He is
going round with specifications of Empire
in his bag. problems on his lips and plans
in his hands. None of them are new, but
because Citrtis comes down out of the
clouds and descends from the general to
the particular, and because the thing that
is called an Empire is up to its neck in
the troubles of war, they wear an aspect
of having greater immediate importance
than they did before. The trimmings of
this notion of an organic Imperialism are
of no interest to this paper. The kernel
of it is what matters; and as Curtis and
others put the case, this lies in the single
question whether Australia is in the future
going to allow peace and war to be decided
for it by a Government over which its people
have no control. If the reply to this is
“No,” then we are assured Australia must
either set up in business as an independent
nation or join in a scheme which gives her
representation in an Imperial Parliament
and Cabinet. If it is to be “Yes” —well,
Curtis quotes Hughes and Fisher as per-
sons who have remarked that existing con-
ditions cannot endure, and proves what
wants no proof—that, as the essence of
Government is responsibility, a country
which has no voice in such a supreme issue
as war cannot be self-governing in any vital
sense. Now, all this is quite plain enough.
What' is not plain is that there is anything
wrong with Yes-No for an answer, or
that the suggested way-out leads anywhere
but West.
* * * *
It is easy enough to make out a case
showing that the British “oversea depend-
encies” are, in the matter of war and peace,
more than anything else like so many tins
attached •to a bulldog’s tail. The Bulle-
tin has made out that case dozens of times.
It is not difficult to show the dangers of
this, or to prove it a blot on our self-
government. A less simple task would be
to show that the evil is more pronounced in
Australia than it is in Britain —that the
people of Britain have anything more than
a control in theory over foreign policy and
the issues which have their accumulating
result ih war. In that respect, in all
except the academic Sense, there is little
difference between the allegedly self-govern-
ing Briton and the Australian; for if the
war has shown anything it is that, prior to
the outbreak and for a considerable time
afterwards, the British people had about as
much control over the course of events as
they had over the flood-waters of the Lach-
lan. They did not make the war. The war
was made for them, mainly by a junta at
Berlin, and partly by British statesmen
long since gathered to their fathers. It
was a war they could not stop out of. Nor
could Australia decently have stood aside
as a mere spectator. But between being
on the one hand dragged in by the force of
circumstances into a war which she had no
voice in making and in which her very
weakness compelled her to participate, and
on the other hand becoming partner in an
organisation working on a system of repre-
sentation which in domestic affairs the Aus-
tralian people have learned to mistrust pro-
foundly, there is a wide difference. The
makers of Imperial constitutions do not
think so. Their whole superstructure of
theoretical excellence in self-government
rests on a Cabinet. But in the evolution
of politics in Australia the tendency is more
and more towards primary government
through the referendum and plebiscite, and
this means that powers will be more and
more wrested from Cabinets and Parliaments
and exercised directly by the people. If
that is a correct forecast, then can it be
supposed that the Australia of the future
will allow the issues leading towards war
or war itself to be determined by an
Imperial Parliament or Cabinet sitting
12,000 miles away; or will it not rather
insist upon the people being principals?
* * * *
There are five million people in Australia.
They are invited by Imperialists to merge
themselves into another Federation and be
subject to taxation and military service
determined by a Cabinet sitting in London.
Within 30 years, if the politicians do their
duty, the population of Australia should have
doubled. Within half a century there will in
all probability be 20,000,000 Australians. Is
it possible to conceive those people living
always on the verge of war in Europe or
Africa, or somewhere? This paper does not
think so. It believes that the individuals
who do imagine it possible, wholly mistake
the temper of the Australia of to-day, and
misjudge the influence of nationality and
environment and heredity on the Australian
of a later generation. It is not towards an
Imperial servitude that the eyes of the Aus-
tralian are turned. Why force him to make
choice at this stage? Where would the prac-
tical advantage be? So far as The Bulletin
can see, the main results would be to get the
British Dominions tied up in a scheme of
general taxation for the maintenance of an
Imperial navy and armies, and the conduct
of joint wars. Within comparatively few
years the population of the Dominions will
far exceed that of Britain. On them then
would fall the heavy end of the log, and all
considerations of individual national defence
give way to those of a general safety with an
eye to balances of power and European and
Asiatic complications. Australia would then
have three taxing authorities —the States and
the Commonwealth and the Empire. That
may be something to be faced with great
approval, but it looks something else. No
intelligent citizen can pretend that the pre-
sent relationships are ideal, or anything like
it. Nor can he possibly imagine that there
are not weaknesses and perils in the condi-
tions now existing. These are the risks that
were inescapable when Australia was born.
But they will not be made any less nor will
the task the Australian people have on hand
be made any easier by becoming scared of
them and leaping into dark places. The Aus-
tralians’ job is here. It is to build a nation
—to establish a democracy on a continent.
This war has not altered the job. It has been
and will continue to be a hard one. There
are risks to be taken. Australia has never
evaded them, so far as they have had relation
to the British connection. That connection
has been a source of strength to Australia —
and of weakness. It cuts two ways. But to
tell Australians now that “the thing cannot
go on,” and offer them as an alternative
chains that would gall their children, change
the entire current of their national ideals and
crystallise political institutions that are in a
condition of flux, is merely to put forward
proposals that Australia has heard many
times before in a vague way and never with
enthusiasm. If the Imperialists in London
are tired of Australia —well, let them say so.
As it is, they speak with two voices—one
expressing infinite pride in the oversea coun-
tries and the other horror at the absence of
an Imperial Cabinet in London and a receiver
of taxes at Melbourne and Ottawa and other
places. They might at least wait, so far as
Australia is concerned, until they hear some
more reliable indication of Australian feeling
concerning the defect in her scheme of self-
government than is afforded by two or three
windy spouters —who are not Australians.
SIGNED ARTICLES AND THE DUMMY.
Whatever may be done in this so-called
Referendum, it is about time that the
clumsy futility of the law relating to the
signing of articles was made clear to the
public. Those who originally framed the
measure for making sure of the identity of
the pen that stubbed a Minister’s feelings or
stabbed a party’s platitudes on the eve of an
election knew less about the Workings of a
newspaper than they knew about the differ-
ential calculus. They had some vague notion
that in fierce spite certain ill-natured jour-
nalists plotted secret assaults and dangerous
rapier thrusts, and, having written their
screeds, chose a moment when the proprietors
and editors weren’t looking and slipped them
into the printing-press. With the exposure
of his name at the bottom of his attack and
the awful fear of a mighty politician’s cOUn-
terstroke to be considered, they had an idea
that the man with the pen would meekly
yield to fate and produce a colorless, harm-
less mass of words which could do nobody
any harm. The scheme Was devised, first
and last, as a means of protecting party
politics; and party politics are, in the poli-
tician’s view, above all Other considerations,
and far heyond measures or principles. From
the first the thing was a disappointment. The
writers continued to hit as hard as ever,
the revelation of their names gave no oppor-
tunities for reprisals.
The making of an article may be as plain
and straightforward as the baking of a loaf
of bread and as stodgy as a damper that
failed to rise, or it may be as complicated as
the building of a clock-work elephant. One
famous literary article of the nineteenth cen-
tury, which disparaged a young Woman
writer and brought her stalwart Irish uncle
in hot haste to London to deal with the
critic, was shown after a lapse of many years
to have been written at first in most kindly
strain and entirely in praise of the author
and her work. All the vice in it was put
there by an unfeeling editor who thought the
original too tame. Many a screed has three
or even four parents before it sees print, and
the fact that perhaps one person put down
most of the words it contains on a piece of
paper does not make him the author of it
any more than the fact that Parliament hires
a draughtsman makes him the author of the
country’s laws. Take an actual instance of
the typical mixed parentage of an article.
A busy sub-editor gets an idea from a para-
graph sent from the Northern Territory. The
sub-editor passes it on to a leader-writer. The
latter expands it and alters it, and suggests
it to the editor. The editor suggests altera-
tions and improvements—-or otherwise. The
leader-writer puts it down on paper, and re-
submits it in its new form to the editor. It
is then further altered, a paragraph dropped
out, a line here and there re-written, a word
or two strengthened, and finally it goes on to
the printer. It is revised some more in
proof, and possibly the Censor, acting on the
instruction of others, cuts out three-fourths
of it in the interests of Ixaiser-smashing.
Whose name ought to be signed to such an
article? No name can go on it without an
element of falsehood, and no name can be
placed there with absolute truth; yet it is
that particular article which probably makes
the politician wish he had never been born.
The fact that the intention of the framers
of the measure for signed journalism cannot,
from the very nature of things, be complied
with has led to some curious results and
made the practice of dummying common.
Men who could not have written a political
article if excommunication from all the
pubs of Australia had been the doom of
failure have enjoyed something of a reputa-
tion from having their signatures at the
foot of other men’s writing. It has enabled
loafers to pose as hard workers and dull
persons to stand among the elect of the
craft; but it has not achieved any purpose
which could possibly make it worth the
extra line of space it occupied. Nothing is
easier to arrange than a system of dummy-
ing, and nothing is harder to prove than real
authorship. Possibly W. M. Hughes could, if
he chose, supply the House with instances of
dummying—of jackals being arranged for to
sign typewritten manuscript for a pound or
two.
* * * *
So compulsory signed journalism offers pit-
falls for the public and serves no good purpose.
That somebody should be responsible for all
that is printed, whether with reference to
elections or not, is a plain fact that no one
would try to side-step; but this lias all
along been provided for. The man with a
skilled pen and a ready brain can write up
the wrong side of an argument as easily as
a chief clerk in a business concern can con-
duct importing transactions while being
himself a convinced Protectionist. The
mere signature at the end of an article
means nothing. Those who by good, honest
sweat of brain are trying, week in week
out, to give the public a lead on national
questions do show by the force of their writ-
ing a sincerity which cannot be faked or
imitated; but they don’t want the lime-
light. Let them know that the papers they
serve count with the public and they are
willing to let things stand at that. A big
part of the democratic right of free speech,
with which is intimately associated the
freedom of the press, rests on anonymity.
The journalist owes his chief strength to
the fact that he is not a public character.
Break that down and the press is at once
a part of the political machine with its
devotees scratching and struggling for cheap
popularity and cakes and ale. The signed
article is poor business, any way you take
it: and the circumstance that on the top
of it is heaped a censorship might
turn the attention of the patriot to
the fact that a politician’s fingers are
in the pocket where the patriot keeps his
rights, and if he loses some of the most valued
of them it will be his own fault.


the millions of china.
[For The Bulletin.]
I once stopped in my passage through a
market-place in Java to watch a quarrel
between two Madurese over a length of
bullock-tether. The bullock-tether might
have been worth four cents. The quarrel
proceeded decorously enough for some time ;
then suddenly both of the quarrellers flashed
out in blazing anger, and, sitting down
opposite each other, with knees almost
touching, they drew their krises and began
carving a pattern on each other’s stomach.
No attempt was made at self-defence. Each
was intent on disembowelling the .other.
Before the native police arrived both had
succeeded in their ambition, and one lay to
the right, one to the left in the blazing
roadway, as dead as mutton. A looker-on
came and gathered in the bullock-tether.
To Asia, which does not and cannot
understand the issues, the spectacle of
Europe at the present time is the spectacle
of two men squatting down over a length
of bullock-tether in a busy market-place and
carving a pattern on each other’s stomach.
During one of China’s perennial disturb-
ances I entered the area of hostilities and
watched operations. The opposing forces
were keeping up a brisk machine-gun and
rifle fire from behind the grave mounds
which are the most prominent features of
every Chinese landscape. A road wound
through the middle of the scene. Not a
soldier was visible, but leaves and branches
were pattering down from the trees in a
continual shower as if the giant hand of
some unseen gardener was pollarding them.
In the middle of it all a Chinese coolie
passed along the road pushing a wheel-
barrow laden with garden produce. Asia
has always gone about her business in just
that way.
In spite of what many say, China counts
for most in the future of Asia. Her per-
sistence in the teeth of calamity marks her
out. Misruled for centuries by an alien
and degenerate race, withdrawn from all
the healthy influences of other civilisations,
her mind drenched with the quietism of
Laotzu, the unaspiring and pulseless
philosophy of Confucius and the negative
teachings of Buddha, she should, by all the
laws of nations, have sunk long ago into the
bog that swallowed up the Greeks, the
Romans, the Spaniards, the Portuguese and
all the mournful procession of peoples who
once held world power and now hold nothing
worth having. Instead of disappearing the
Chinese people remain the most virile nation
in Asia. While their officials, the evil legacies
of Manchu rule, are the worst in the world,
their merchants are the most honorable,
enterprising and successful. Inject a
Chinese coolie penniless into the Dutch
Indies, and despite restrictive legislation,
Dutch prejudice and native hatred, in a
few weeks he will he a klontong and carry
round a pack; in a few months lie will own
a warong in the market-place; in a few
years he will be a respected member of the
Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Sourabaya,
own a dozen sugar fabriks, and the best
residential site outside the city for his
future burial-place. In spite of floods and
pestilences, famines and bloody wars, the
nation _ goes on breeding its bulbous-headed
brood in serene disregard of economic laws
and political exigencies. In Hongkong
under British administration the death-rate
of Chinese children under one year of age in
one average year was 87 per cent. In the
provinces it is worse; but the Chinese rear
four generations while Europeans are rear-
ing three. Epidemics, which would
devastate a European country, arise in the
feculent native cities and disappear without
any preventive measures being taken. Lack
of sanitation has made the Chinese aseptic
against conditions that would overwhelm a
white community. Despite all restrictions
the Chinese population in the Siberian pro-
vinces of the Amur increases twice as fast
as the Russian. The dominant race has
become economically inferior to the subject
one. Russian porters carry the luggage of
first-class Chinese passengers on the
Siberian railway, and in Malaya Chinese
capital supports more British industries
than the white resident of Singapore cares
to admit.
Every year the Yellow River carries off
thousands. The residents of Shanghai were
mildly surprised one year to learn from the
chance letter of a missionary that 60,000
lives had been lost by floods in a neighboring
province some months before. The local
papers had been informed of the temporary
suspension of telegraphic communication,
but no mention had been made of the
holocaust of lives. Roads are so few in
China that in good years produce lies
retting through lack of means to distribute
it; in lean years thousands die because
there are no communications between the
parts that have plenty and the parts
that have dearth. In 1842 the popula-
tlcm e . Middle Kingdom was reckoned
at 400 millions. In 1862, after the appal-
ling devastation of the Taiping rebellion,
it had dropped to 260 millions. To-day it
stands at the 400-millions mark again. The
Vnn country in the world can support
400 millions; perhaps with intensive cul-
ture, 800 millions. Wliat is it going to do
with 1000 millions?
The golden horde has already spilled over
J' 1 . 1 - 0 . V le world to the extent of 15 millions,
llmving communities in Siam,
Malaya and S. America maintain their
nationality with sturdy patriotism. Fifteen
thousand Chinese in Peru subscribed a
million pounds to revolutionary funds in a
single year, and Chinese the world over, as
a protest against the exclusion laws, joined
in the famous boycott of American goods.
1 rom well-filled countries they turn to
countries where empty pastures invite their
coming. Await, then, with welcoming
hands the Australian politician who can
find a way to encourage the . Australian
mother to rear four generations while the
Chinese is rearing three! He will be the
first great statesman to appear on the Aus-
tralian horizon.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hughes, Holman and the Labor Party.
Whatever Hughes may have clone to
deserve excommunication from the Labor
party Holman, Griffith and Hall have
done nothing—nothing, at any rate, that was
not long since known to the P.L.L. Execu-
tive. The position tnat these men have
taken up with regard to conscription is cer-
tainly no justification for the Executive’s
action now. Holman’s attitude is presum-
ably that also of the others. As a peace-at-
any-pricer he is convinced that the price to
be paid for peace in the future is universal
service in the present. Were conscription
or its opposite a matter with which the
State Parliament was concerned, the State
Labor political machine might be justified,
according to the theories of party govern-
ment, in closing his mouth. But Holman
is none the less a citizen of the Common-
wealth because he is a Minister of the
State; and as a citizen of the Commonwealth
he is entitled to free speech. If that is
denied him or any other man in a Referen-
dum campaign, then that Referendum is a
fraud upon the democracy; and any organ-
isation, no matter what it may call itself,
which applies the gag and thus casts dis-
credit upon the principle of the Referendum
is an enemy of the democracy. Hughes’s
position is different. Yet if he deserves ex-
communication it is equally not because of
his attitude with regard to conscription. He
got the authority of the Caucus of his own
Parliament to hold this Referendum; and
that is his justification. For the P.L.L.
Executive to then attempt to gag him is as
monstrous as Hughes’s own attempts to
gag others. They are in this matter both in
the same boat. And if Hughes deserves
excommunication from the Labor movement
so does the Sydney P.L.L.
The Pernicious Influence of the Yelp.
The Bulletin likes to get it in good Aus-
tralian and is getting it. From Cape York
to Bunbury letters come in shoals about
one thing—“conscription of wealth”: wild
yelps most of them, but earnest every one,
and besprinkled with demands to know “why
The Bulletin cannot see that if the country
wants to take Bill and Jim by the scruff of
the neck it ought in decency to make wealth
bear its share and pay.” The only possible
reply The Bulletin can make is this: that
it has never said that Wealth should not pay
for the war; that it has said scores of times
that Wealth should pay and will pay if the
recreant trucklers who are pawning Aus-
tralia can be forced to do their duty ; but
that it can be no more done by
howling in public places than the war
can be won by bombarding the Ger-
mans with abusive language. If there
is any other way of conscripting wealth than
by taxing it, this paper wants to know what
that way is. It has for many months asked
the people whose mouths are full of words
on this subject to come down to detail. And
the only answers it has received are more
words, yells and a thousand letters from indi-
viduals stating that they are enthusiastically
in favor of “conscripting wealth” and urging
The Bulletin to support a policy having
that object. The only thing missing is the
policy. Under these circumstances this
paper adheres to its policy of refusing to
support other policies which no one can pro- ■
(luce; and it sticks to its contention that
by taxation wealth can be and should be
“conscripted”—that taxation is the only pos-
sible method of conscripting wealth, and that
that method is already in the hands of Par-
liament to use, and is in use. Grabbing
bank balances and motor-cars and news-
papers would not be conscription of
wealth. And if it were, what would be
the use of the nation collaring the Worker
or the stock in Horderns’ shop or Bruce
Smith’s law library? The idea is ridicu-
lous. One enraged Australian, “firmly con-
vinced that Conscription is necessary to win
the war,” puts it this way from somewhere
near the Bananaland border: —
Hereabouts we have many people who own miles
of country and fat cheque-books and are the loudest
conseiiptionists. Yet you have the hide to ask
Billjim to fight for these men without asking them
to find the dough to pay some of the bill. The
Lands Department has surveyors marking out
inferior land about here for soldiers’ homes.
There is one place where there are 40,000
acres of as fine farming land as there is in
the State, and the owner of it employs no more than
a dozen boundary riders. Why not advocate the
conscription of 10,000 of these acres to help win the
war or pay for it when it is won ? There are
thousands of similar cases all over Australia.
The reason why The Bulletin doesn’t advo-
cate conscripting 10,000 acres of land is that
Treasurer Higgs doesn’t want land— he
wants money. And when a Treasurer wants
money he gets it by taxation. Already he is
getting some that way, and he will have to
get more. The mistake those who are yelp-
ing for conscription of wealth make is in
supposing that the Treasurer is getting
nothing—that in some mysterious way con-
scription of wealth will open up a source of
revenue that he has not touched so far. The
land tax, which he already collects, is a con-
scription of wealth. The income tax, which
is already in force, is a conscription of
wealth. Probate duties are conscription of
wealth; and they run up in some cases to
30 per cent, of the total. Thus Wealth is
being conscripted. Inadequately, it may be;
but those who are pretending that it is free
from conscription and are making that the
excuse for opposing the conscription of men
are merely hocussing themselves.

Climbing Off the Genealogical Tree.
Bulgarian youngsters are taught in school
that Alexander the Great was a Bulgar,
and that there was a time when the Kaiser’s
present ally went forth with a big whoop to
conquer the world, and succeeded in putting-
all of it that looked worth stealing into his
hip-pocket. Turks, floundering in the dust-
heaps about Constantinople, fancy that they
are still the spiritual descendants of the
ragged Prophet who lived for weeks on dates
and water, and who toiled and died in the
hope that his simple creed, if properly scimi-
tared into humanity, might make the world
a slightly more decent place to live in. Rou-
manians imagine they, are related to the
ancient Romans; the Archbishop of Canter-
bury has a notion he got his frilled apron
from St. Peter by indirect apostolic succes-
sion ; the Indian claims to be an Aryan;
and even the Maori leans to the theory that
he is the Lost Tribes of Israel, as if he
wasn’t lost enough without making Jacob
responsible for it. The whole business is
futile. In one sense all nations have a cut-
throat ancestry, and all men must put the
gallows into their family-tree; but in the
essential things that make for nationhood
the peoples stand fatherless and motherless,
and patriotism is an orphan from birth. The
root of nearly all constitutional evils is the
backward look. The notion that because
you can apparently trace a movement step
by step from its infancy to its attainment of
whiskers it must be all right, is about as
unsound as to say that Commonwealth de-
fence is as it should be because you see no
holes in the continent on the map. Unless
Australia resulted from the play between
Aurora and Zephyr, which .Milton so deli-
cately describes, our nation has no parent-
age. John Bull has been accused of it;
but the accusation is repudiated by the evi-
dence of national character, which has more
of the Gallic or Hibernian about it than of
the stolidly British. We seem to be on the
eve of turmoil and change; and out of the
general chaos may come a new Constitution
with enlarged ideas and wider aims. But that
lack of parentage which the first framers of
Federation could not believe or understand
wants to be clearly understood first. Because
other nations did this or that is no reason
why Australia should do either of them. Our
heritage is the future, not the past; and if
we trust somebody else’s past more than our
own future, as we did at the start, we can
go on carrying the burden of party politics
and other garbage till the crack of doom. The
road forward is never blocked. To a people
with courage and imagination the truth
stands that the past died yesterday without
issue.

Billjim, M.LA.
The Holman Government’s scheme for get-
ting the N. S. Wales soldiers in France and
elsewhere to vote in bulk for party and hand
their ballots over for distribution by the
party leaders is a mere pretence. It doesn’t
give the fighting citizen his rights or any
color of them. If the soldier is to have his
rights he must vote for his own candidates
and send his own representatives to Parlia-
ment—men whom Billjim can trust, and
who will express his sentiments fearlessly
and forcibly. The difficulties in the way of
letting him have his own constituencies
should not be too big to overcome, if Minis-
ters are really anxious to overcome them.
The whole thing would be a tonic for local
politics and put a hint of life into them.
When, in the intervals of Wade's inanity
and Holman’s polite bluff, the honorable
member for Moocow Farm —a stout sergeant-
major with his arm in a sling—rose
to speak, the whole State would listen
with one attentive ear. When in a
single robust phrase the member for
Pozieres turned and smote the garrulous
little Fitzparrot, the whole State would
laugh as one kookaburra. A big lot of hum-
bug would go down before the plain, soldierly
attack of the men who represented the citi-
zens at the Front; and at last there would be
a real Australian party in the Assembly
which had regard for neither Labor threat
nor Liberal whine. The scheme so far pro-
pounded opens up vast opportunities for sus-
picion, and must tend to bring the State
Legislature into further contempt; but direct
soldier representation would be the pearly
dawn of a new era of hope. Give the soldier
his own plain say in things ; it is the only
honest course.
“Quill’s” estimate of his old reptile contem-
porary :
The just-dead Gresdey Lukin, of Wellington
(M.L.) Post, was perhaps the most widely-known
journalist this side of the Line. But that was not
because he was a big journalist; it was because he
was a big personality. Nature intended him to be
one of Australia’s wide cattle-men, or the director of
an Anthony Hordern business, or an engineer or
something of that sort, doing things. He was essen-
tially a man of affairs, and only in a very modified
sense a man of ideas. In journalism his real place
would have been as managing director of a metro-
politan daily. Australia and Maoriland have known
scores of better journalists, for he was not very
enterprising, his pen moved heavily, and his poli-
tical judgment, apart from the avoidance of holes,
was never sound nor his grasp of political principle
firm. “Ah ha,” said he when he got to Maoriland
and espied Seddon tossing things round, “this rooster
wants the axe. It is for me to give it to him!”
But he didn’t, because he always misjudged Seddon
- —not the man (he had him down to a fine point)
but the politician. In those days Stout, now Ghiet
Justice, and Duncan Macgregor, then Inspector-
General of Hospitals, used to help him with the
axe ; and it generally landed heavily where Seddon’s
neck didn’t happen to be. After a time Lukin grew
tired and sat back rumbling prophecies about
Seddon’s downfall at the next election—which didn’t
happen. Just before the election in which the ex-
digger almost blotted the other side out of existence,
Lukin had shown on irrefutable evidence that
Seddon was about to be flung to the South Pole,
All this disappointment soured the old man’s soul,
purged him of his Radical tendencies, and turned
him into a rather pronounced defender of vested
interests. But his strong personality stuck to him
throughout, his poise was always certain and a
source of eternal delight to his friends. To the
working pressman he was ever a good friend, llis
sympathies were always with the under-dog. He was
a man w'ho would have shared his last bob with his
mate. He was a strenuous advocate of reform in
Australia in the long ago. Towards the end it was
as a fervent admirer of freedom's cause as far
away as Paris is that he will be remembered by
those who only knew the journalist. But to us who
knew the individual he was a fine old man.
“Exile” : Robert Stout, C. J. of Maori-
land, suggests reprisals against the Amurri-
kans for legislating against the “British
black-list” of Yankee firms trading with the
enemy. There is no need for reprisals or any
excitement. The U.S.A. is impotent to
enforce any of its decrees, ordinances, laws,
embargoes, threats or demands against
Britain, or indeed against Monaco or Mexico
or Hayti, or any nation or Government,
black, brown or yellow. I saw their alleged
National Guards going to the Mexican
border in troop-trains to carry out Woodrow
Wilson’s third ineffective Declaration of
War against the Greaser nation. I also saw
the National Guards coming back after
doing nothing except eat up one week’s com-
missariat supply, which was all that was
provided for them. The U.S.A. has no army
and an out-of-date navy to enforce its blus-
ter, As to the black-list, a San Francisco
man told me this story. One San Francisco
firm —it is now on the list—made £600,000
profit last year with three big steamers run-
ning groceries to Germany via Denmark.
The method was simple. An Amurrikan
German named Bade acted as agent at
Copenhagen. When the grocery ships, carry-
ing rubber, cotton and nickel as well, got
into the Skager-rack it wirelessed Bade, who
telegraphed the German Admiral at Kiel. A
destroyer dashed off and seized the Yankee
steamer, forfeited the cargo and paid the
San Francisco firm what price it asked for
the food. The British Admiralty was made
wise to the plan, and captured the three
ships during last May and June, and took
them—Boston baked beans, fat, petrol and
all- —into Kirkwall, where the emptv ships
are now tied up. And the grocery-runners
foamed at the mouth and got the U.S.A.
Government to protest.
It is about time the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment called in a consulting actuary and
asked him what he thinks of the Railways
Superannuation Fund. The report of the
Board, lately issued, shows that the contri-
butions during the past 12 months were
£66,674, and other receipts carried the total
revenue to £67,022, while the disbursements
were £82,964 for pensions, gratuities, etc.,
and £2462 for premiums on life-insur-
ance policies which .the Fund took
over when membershin became compul-
sory in the service. The report, by the
way, is either clumsy or dishonest: it
alleges that the contributions “with the
balance brought forward, together with other
payments, made the total receipts for the
year £113,157.” As a matter of fact, those
alleged “receipts” for the year include
£46,135 receipts in other years: and the
actual receipts for the past year were so
much less than the outgoings that the balance
of accumulations was reduced from that sum
of £46,135 to £27,731. There may be an ex-
planation ; but on appearances the Fund is
racing towards bankruptcy, and no man
ought to be compelled by law to pay his
money into such a concern. A consulting
actuary should be put on to inquire into it.
“Canuck” : Germans in Australia seem to
be pursuing a settled policy. Here are
instances. A man building a house in a
Melbourne suburb and acting as bis own
contractor called tenders for the plumbing.
He got several offers running from £65 15s.
to £53 65., and one —from a German —at
£4l 2s. 6d. lie knew this was too low to
allow for sound material and honest work,
but it was cheap and he accepted it. Of
course, being a blatant loyalist, he didn’t
publish the circumstance broadcast, and if
there is anything deficient about the job he
has kept his head shut. Another —a church
committee in an outer suburb —called for
tenders for painting and varnishing the
tabernacle, figuring that it would run to
about £2O. It got offers at £27 155.. £26
10s. and £IS 17s. 6d., the last from a local
Ode to the Censor.

Will the Australian Stick to His Mates?
It is no use Hughes, or anyone else, moan-
ing about the prevalence of people in Aus-
tralia who fail to realise the magnitude of
the war and the strong military and political
reasons why the allied nations should sup-
port each other to the full extent of their
powers. By pushing compulsory service
aside when the issue should have been
grappled with, by an ignorant and fatuous
censorship, by the recklessly optimistic
speeches of public men, by the ludicrous
headlines in the newspapers, and by the ex-
travagant administrative conduct of the
Commonwealth and the numerous other Gov-
ernments infesting Australia, the community
has been blinded to both its perils and its
responsibilities. In the darkest days it heard
nothing but blither, for every throat from
which it might have heard the truth was
choked. Even now Australians know mucn
less than they should, but they know enough
to realise that if our armies had failed us on
the field as our politicians have failed us in
statesmanship, the war, so far as Australia
is concerned, would have been over long ago.
Some of them are trying to make good at
the eleventh hour, and a month hence the
Australian people, suddenly invested with the
fag end of an authority the politicians have
systematically withheld from them, will be
asked to say what they think about it. In
the meantime they will have the privilege of
listening to a Niagara of words mainly about
things that don’t count. Stripped of all the
verbal decorations that surround it, me Ques-
tion for Australians is whether the Aus-
tralian divisions shall be allowed to waste or
shall be kept at effective strength to do what
they sailed away to do. It is as futile to
approach this question by discussion of
whether conscription for service outside Aus-
tralia conforms with academic theories about
citizenship, as to argue about the way to cap-
ture a aemented bulldog by the tail if it
happens to be without one. Tiie Bulletin
is not going to pretend that it likes to see
Australian soldiers fighting in Europe. It
grieves that the necessity has arisen. But the
necessity lias arisen. We went into the war,
.and we must stay in. Those Australian
divisions must not be forsaken so long as
there are men in Australia to give them
strength. It is idle to talk about the war
being over and the march to victory started.
The truth has a different sound, xhe Ger-
man still lias his clutches on France and Bel-
gium and Servia, and while he is there he
stands at tne gateway of Australia. There
are aspects of this matter which reflect the
greatest discredit on the Parliament of the
Commonwealth. The organisation of the
community which this paper pleaded for in the
early stages of the unpleasantness has been
let go hang till now, and now the task lias
been taken up at one point only. Yet that
discredit is but little compared with what
would rest on the Australian people if they
flinched from the stern duty of filling the
gaps as they occur in the ranks of their own
• sons and brothers.

“Joe” (only the Registrar of Births ever

imported pilot could learn without coming to
some grief. For years past, when Lukin
periodically reached for a spare hand to put
to the wheel, Parker was the man he turned
to: and as was the habit of the fine old dead
journalist, he was comfortable in his judg-
ment. ,
Once more the comic strike. A hundred
joiners working on transports at Cockatoo
Island (Sydney) struck work last week
because the job of fastening on name-
plates with slotted screws was given to
shipwrights. It appears that the work of
screwing name and number plates is divided,
according to the pattern of the screw,
among boilermakers, engineers and ship-
wrights, the joiners being left out. So
the .whole crowd struck. Nobody cared two
straws about the Kaiser. And apparently
nobody cared one straw about the Arbitra-
tion Court or the law which declares that
strikes are illegal.

“Bolibme” and “Faust” were in last
week’s bills at Sydney Opera House. Miss
VisonL was the Marguerite of the “Faust
performance; and if vocally too unimport-
ant for the star part, she at any rate pleased
by reason of a girlish waistline and her
tunefulness. The Marguerite who can really
sing the “Jewel Song” is usually a mus-
cular matron equal to putting the tenor
across her knee, The fiery Filippini was a
broth of a boy as brother Valentine. He
sang with spirit and some wonderful facial
efforts. When Valentine rolled his eyes till
nothing but two shuddersome white streaks
were visible there was the devil to pay. But
Cacialli was out of sorts, and his Mephisto
showed haggard lines through the grease
paint. His Ho! Ho! in consequence was
as sulphurous as the end of a Sankey hymn.
Cappelli, too youthful in the first scene, had
one of those vocally limp off-niglits that
alHict the best singers. Hence his scenes
with Marguerite fell flat. She looked like
the best girl in her Sunday-school, and he
the estimable young man in charge. Miss
Russ (Siebel), in flaxen curls, was chiefly
remarkable for her shapely limbs—aud_ of
course, her tremolo. Sydney is getting opera
at bargain-counter prices. For this reason
the scanty stage setting of a glowing lyric
like “Faust” need not be too severely criti-
cised. But the opera is at least worthy of
a better chorus than was heard on the open-
ing night. It jumped off either too soon of
too late, and gave a bumpy effect to Gon-
salez’s orchestra.
For three hours of “Bohhme” the baldest-
headed cynic of the stalls shared with the
fluffiest flapper in the circle the conviction
that love and art are enough. Miss Gon-
salez made a dainty and meltingly pathetic
Mimi, and from his first note slim and
graceful Lois made every girl in the audi-
ence sigh for a tenor poet-lover. Visoni as
the piquante Musetta tantalised her young
man Marcello (Belloni) to the verge of
desperation. The rest of the honors were
divided between Cacialli as Colline,
Scamuzzi as Ghaunard, and Petrucci as
Alcindoro.
In the autumn of this week we are to
have “Gioconda” and “Rigoletto.”
“ROMANCE,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Parson Armstrong (Frank Harvey) meets
the opera singer Cavallini (Madge Fabian).
Recent sensational revelations about a
well-known church dignitary suggest that
even bishops may possess a “past.” While
a young, unmarried rector, this man met a
notorious opera singer—met her, too, in the
house of a rich person whose mistress she
then was. The rector had heard the
woman’s history, which was merely a long
recital of her amours with a procession of
well-known men; but, overcome by her
dangerous fascination, he had fallen violently
in love with her himself. It is recorded
that the opera singer even had the audacity
to call upon him at the rectory, and so in-
fatuated was the good man that when
the deaconesses arrived for their weekly
meeting he refused to admit them. Then,
after entrapping the clergyman by her impet-
uous wooing, the siren fell in love with her
victim. True, she was the sort of woman
who could not exist without an “affair anti
had just been informed by her elderly lover
that he had tired of her. Her boredom
was not even consoled by her love tor a pet
monkey, upon which she lavished all tne
love and care that mothers give their chil-
dren, carrying it about with her and provid-
ing it with a baby’s cradle. No ; she wanted
something more exciting, and the young rec-
tor was so fresh in his innocence. His
suspicions, however, revived, and. the woman
then confessed to her first “affair,” keeping
discreet silence about the long procession of
others. But when confronted with her
elderly lover, she allowed the truth to be
dragged from her. Her infatuation was so
genuine that she immediately thought of com-
mitting suicide. The rector made his
wav to her bedroom, in the pardonable con-
viction that he was merely trying to save her
soul. There her personal fascination so
overcame him that he cast all pretence aside
and implored her to forthwith become his
mistress. But the woman, sincerely repent-
ant, repulsed him, and thev parted. The
singer went back to her career and the
rector became a bishop. Apparently it did
not occur to either of them that, another
solution was possible. Why didn t he

at Sydney Criterion. The dramatist has
invested the passionate incident with the
poetry of romance and situation. The scene
is set in America about 50 years ago. and
the costuming itself removes the “affair ’
from the otherwise inevitable denunciation
of Mrs. Wowser. The dialogue, too. is
brilliant and genuinely poetical. The recital
of Madame Cavallini’s first essay in passion
is transformed by the diction into a thing
of beauty. Then the part of the great
singer is a triumph of stage actuality. Her
broken English, her infinite moods, her phy-
sical charm complete the illusion so cleverly
prepared for her by the dramatist.
“Romance” is a one-woman play, and. given
a big equipment of personal charm and emo-
tional power, the part is actress-proof. In
the part. Madge Fabian, hitherto wilfully
obscured by cheap American melodrama,
emerges as an actress equipped with every
quality necessary for her triumph. She is
the traditional Carmen. Camille, Lola Mon-
tez to the life. Her childish attitude to her
elderly lover, her seductiveness, her pettish
moods with her maid, her bitter disillusion-
ment, and her youth and attractiveness all
help her on to victory. _ Frank Har-
vey. as the super-wowser, is able in the
“big” emotional moments to share the situa-
tions with Madge Fabian—and that is high
praise. But in the prologue and the epilogue he
bishes with evident difficulty. Sidney Stirling,
the elderly lover, carries the big part with con-
siderable success, but his stilted methods con-
vey all through a suggestion of insincerity.

Hoyt’s Sydney programme this week in-
cludes a Stirring battle picture from the
Somme. “The Quitter,” a Metro, tangle of
mining and matrimony (both duffers); a
Wm. Fox feature, “Ambition” ; and half a
dozen other items make a crowded evening,
“Hedda Gabler,” produced at Melbourne
Playhouse last Saturday, and continued for
three flights thereafter, must be a master
piece of domestic Ibsen drama, because its
characters keep intelligent audiences inter=
ested iii a story which has only a surface ap-
pearance of possibility. Hedda, the expen-
sive bride of an amiably-stupid scholar amt
dull treatise-writer, may be accepted as d
reasonable study in neurotic _ femininity;
Lovborg, the dipsomaniac friend of the-
family, is human enough ; likewise the over-
wrought Mrs. Elvsted, who forms a literary
attachment to this thirsty man of talent, and
Judge Brack, the worldly-wise schemer with &
fancy for playing tertium quid in Hedda s
household. But the circumstances of the
story which lead up to the catastrophe are
not justified by the dialogue. Hedda impresses
the audience by her hatefulness, her evident
desire to make mischief, her cattish uealousj,
her craving to gratify a diseased curiosity.
She lures Lovborg to drink because she_ won-
ders how he will look “with vine leaves in liis
hair.” On learning that liquor inflames his
vulgar passion for a red-haired lady of the
town, she invites the man to kill liimseli
beautifully ; and when it appears that lie has
been mortally and unbeautifully wounded in
the stummick, and that the cynical Brack
means to share a guilty -secret with her the
lady blows her own brains out. Clearly there
is insanity in her hatefulness. This fact alone
would not be ah obstacle to Hedda s poptL
larity if she Were invariably good-tempered
or charmingly frivolous or otherwise lovable,
But neither by word nor deed does Hedda ex-
plain why two different sorts of scholar and
one calm worldling who has nearly got lei
measure should have been fascinated by a
coid blooded crank before her marriage and
afterwards. v ,

Miss Eily Malyon gives a clever perform-

vincing in spots, yet she cannot reconcile the
character with the situation when it is closely
considered. Miss Prichard, as Mrs. Elvsted,
fails to suggest the type of intellectual young
woman who would inspire an intemperate
litterateur to write a book. Norman Carter
'accentuates the stupidity of Hedda s hus-
band ; Gregan McMahon, though too lugu-
brious in his make-up, is fairly successful as
the author of the blessed book there is so
much puerile talk about; and Helton Darnell
is an easy, matter-of-fact Judee Brack. The
Repertory management is no longer too proud
to have music between the acts, so the hidden
orchestra will be heard again next Saturday,
when “Quinneys” is revived, with McMahon
in the principal part.

tion is too limited for a vigorous person like
Hamilton, though it is just about the right
size for Donald Bowles to lounge in. Donald,
Hale’s discomforter and false guide, is a
frail personality deriving a little emphasis
from his association with the vinegary
young woman whom he finally marries.
Nevertheless his homoeopathic doses of dry
comment lighten the dialogue, and his ennui,
eyeglasses and ultra-smart attire also help
as comedy elements. Miss Gleeson figures
as Bowles’s incredible donah, and leaves her
tongue to give the sour taste which her
amiable countenance is vainly endeavoring
to convey. Myrtle Tannehill, Hale Hamil-
ton’s divinity, is just the sort of girl to
play handies with in the fading twilight of
the last act —a charming, winsome actress,
who is even piquant in her pique. Edwin
Lester is a matter-of-fact contractor, and
Cornell, Hamilton’s wealthy uncle and
employer, is notable for his gas and his
grey tweeds. Of the others, Miss Marion
Marcus Clarke is the most loquacious as the
mother of the numerous Cooks who agree to
disagree about everything and add to the
general discontent. Leslie Victor, John Do
Lacey, Miss Nancye Stewart, and a few
more who figure as the scarecrow Cook
collection, easily succeed in revealing Myrtle
Tannehill Cook’s poor judgment in her choice
of relations. Next Saturday “It Pays to
Advertise” will be revived.

Melbourne Majesty’s is getting two nights'
rest prior to the return of the Royal Comics.
Wednesday saw the last of “High Jinks,” and
on Saturday the more musical co. will, revive
“The Geisha,” for the first time in many
years.
The rich contralto brogue of Peg will be
heard no more at Melbourne King’s after
Friday. The Bert Bailey co. returns on
Saturday, when “On Our Selection” will
start another innings as a matter of course.
Under any circumstances a reappearing
Bailey would be expected to come clothed in
the prodigious whiskers of Dad. Next week
the whiskers are more inevitable than ever,
because it is Show week in Melbourne.
It is mainly on account of the coming
Feast of Cow, perhaps, that the Follies
turned up again at Melbourne Tivoli last
Saturday. The theatre will be flagged and
the advts. will sing praises to the Show for
three weeks only. With the exception of
Frank Greene, who is no longer there, the
Follies are exactly the same people as before,
and for the most part they do the same
things. The best of the noticeably new items
are Jack Cannot’s first song, which he sings
uncommonly well, and a pretty little ditty
that is daintily treated by Thelma Raye with
the assistance of little Jean Keith. Thelma
seems- in a fair way to get more sweetness
into her warble, but Vera Pearce is still
suffering from insufficiency of natural tune-
fulness, and her fine ohysique is now almost
too expansive for orthodox attire. For the
rest, there are George Welch, who affects
chronic insobriety, and Walter Weems and
Billy Rego. Supported by a chorus and a few
occasional interlopers these old identities
rattle through 23 turns, which mostly shine
by comparison with the protracted efforts of
a few other people in the painful first part.
Bertha Kalich, a new Roumanian actress,
was Hoyt’s film star in Melbourne on Satur-
day. Bertha appears in a picture entitled
“Scandal.” and passionately depicts the
agony of a lady who is parted from her
hubby on a false charge of infidelity. Mary
Miles Min ter, a sweet Amurkan blonde, is
the heroine of Hoyt’s other sensation,
“Lovely Mary.” The scene of the yarn is
laid in Florida, where Mary and her best
boy prevent a w’icked land deal which nearly
succeeds through the ungovernable thirst of
her foolish old uncle.
“Peaches on the Beaches” and “Lost in
a Harem” are still the frivols at Melbourne
Princess’s. The Harem item is the more
attractive of the two, for the humor is
stronger, and the girls are better to look at
—there are some surprising transparent
effects in the costumes. Also in this portion
of the show occurs the feature of the evening
—the remarkable acrobatics of the Le Grohs.
All three of them are experts in somersault-
ing and balancing, but the artist of the
party is an india-rubber gentleman who is
understood to go to bed in a corksdrew
from choice.
At Melbourne Auditorium a series of Paul
Dufault concerts will start next Saturday,
and at the Athenaeum Hall, across the street,
Lawrence Campbell will begin his recitals
of “The Sentimental Bloke.”
Adelaide has been watching with much
interest a w 7 eek of Jean Robertson, formerly
a Repertory Theatre amateur, as leading-
lady to Julius Knight. He has taught her
a lot. Her gracefulness is still on the
statuesque side, but she has added power
and pathos. Knight’s Napoleon is perhaps
the best thing lie now does —a finished study.
At leaving he paid a well-deserved tribute
to his nearly-all-Australian co. Boyd Irwin
supports him well, Atholwood is sound as
ever, and Herbert Leigh comes to the front
with some clever character-sketches that

almost produce an illusion of Athol wood
doubling those parts. At the Tivoli Roy
Redgrave is hero in a play that takes the
name of Sherlock Holmes in vain. Dan
Thomas is at the Tivoli; also contortionist
Mankin and young Newberry, a lately-
discovered boy singer. West’s and Wonder-
granli vary between American “drama” and
Australians in France. Edward Reeves has
been eloc-uting. Waller’s Strollers have come
into the Queen’s, and the Tramways Band
gets into the open air on Sunday afternoon
—a sign that summer is coming.
Dennis’s “Moods of Ginger Mick” is to
be published next month. It deals with the
exploits of the Sentimental Bloke’s cobber
at the war. and the' two books should be
equally good cobbers on any shelf.
The scandals over the East-and-West rail-
way. coming on top of the appalling waste
at Canberra, are surely almost enough to
make this country wonder how much longer
it must stand the O’Malleyadministration
of its Home Affairs.
The N. S. Wales interest bill will go up by
over a quarter of a million within two
years, quite irrespective of interest on
whatever money may be borrowed for new 7
works. About £21.000,000 falls due; and
the renewal loans will cost us well over
1 per cent. more. Thus the ghost of the
old mortgage haunts the present feast of
loan.
Premier Peacock has published a Bill
that threatens to make agents honest)
Briefly, it orders all persons who “exercise
or carry on or advertise or notify that they
exercise or carry on or that they are willing
to exercise or carry on a business in Vic-
toria as an agent for buying or selling land,
business, buildings, goodwill, stock, produce
or fish,” to get themselves registered forth-
with and then behave themselves. Failing
registration they may be fined £25, and fail-
ing good behavior they may lose their
licenses. But the fact that only bad admin-
istration of existing law’s makes this one
necessary doesn’t promise much reform.
“Bee”: Re draftsmen’s errors (B.
14/9/T6), the amending Public Instruction
Bill passed by the N. S. Wales Assembly
and now before the Leg. Council provided
that every child in the State must attend
either a public school or a private school
registered in 1916. The Bill got past all
the Assembly critics and was nearly through
the Council when someone saw that if this
clause stood it would be impossible to open
a private school after Dec. 31, 1916.
“Merely a draftsman’s slip.” was Minister
Fitzgerald’s airy comment, and the thing
was carried aw r ay for repairs. As the
Courts are finding these slips every time
they start looking for them, it seems as if
somebody is soaping the stairs.
Stuart Dight Walker, of the A.1.F., who
won a Military Cross at the Somme, is an
old Sydney Grammar School cricketer and
footballer, who got his engineering degree at
Sydney Uni., and was managing a West-
ralian mine when Bill broke into Belgium.
He enlisted as a private, but now has his
two stars. Four brothers are also in khaki.
Their father used to expound the Shorter
Catechism in a fashionable Scotchbyterian
kirk at Woollahra (Sydney), and now does
the same at Ballarat (Vic.).
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Kaniva”: The death of “Tom” Dawson
(Bisley) at the Front darkens the Aus-
tralian vaudeville stage. Born in Wales,
he came to Australia when a child, and
later developed as a dancer and comedian.
In Melbourne he toured with the Flying
Jordans. Then he played second parts with
Frank Clark. In 1903 the Permans secured
him to play the baron in the panto. “Little
Red Riding Hood.” Harry Shine fell ill
and Dawson played the dame. Harry
Rickards saw this performance and imme-
diately offered him a contract, which was
commenced in Sydney. The result was 10
years without a break on the Rickards
circuit.
“Glen H.”: Is E. H. Olipliant quite honest
in his indignation (B. 7/9/T6) with that
portion of Melbourne which was shocked at
his play, “The Superior Race”? It seems to
me that Air. Oliphant counted upon shocking
his repertory audience (which is mostly a
very unworldly audience) for advertising pur-
poses. His play opened with an unnecessary
spoken preface, which warned those present
that they were going to be horribly shocked,
and at the conclusion of the first perform-
ance the author made a long speech in which
lie prognosticated that the critics would give
him beans. Well, the Age said that “The
Superior Race” was indecent, but clever;
and Mr. Oliphant wrote thanking the critic
for his fair notice. The papers which Mr.
Oliphant did not thank were the Argus and
the Herat,!). The former said that the play
was shocking, but not clever; while the
Herald found that it was not only dull,
but didn’t shock worth tuppence. If
Mr. Oliphant had been sincere, the Herald
critic, who definitely refused to see anything
indecent in ’’The Superior Race,” was the
man who should have won the author’s grati-
tude.
“Stargazer” : Witnessing the reproduction
of five-year-old Mary Pickford films I am
made aware of the grim disadvantage under
which picture actresses will labor in the pos-
sibility of their becoming their own most
dangerous rivals. In the earlier films in
which Miss Pickford figures there is a fresh-
ness and sweetness in the unstrained comedy
that little Mary already falls something short
of. If you want the great actor you must go
and see him in the present. But with the
great picture performers, when they are
getting old, plain, stale and stilted, their
youthful, fresh, beautiful efforts will be
trotted out to overwhelm them. Think or the
state of mind of the once popular and beauti-
ful actress deposed by that still popular and
beautiful actress, her former self!
“Stargazer” : In Somerset Maugham’s play.
“The Land of Promise,” at the Royal (Melb.),
we have at length, in my judgment,. some-
thing to be grateful for, a concise, literary
and very human piece of work. The un-
strained humanity of the characters is the
chief asset of the comedy. All the people
cut close to life. Maugham’s. actuality is
radiant with humor, and we miss in it that
rather irritating temperamental defect of
Shaw’s which makes you think of the author
as a gifted and satirical Providence toying
with his creatures as a comic but clever cat
might toy with as many mice.
“Joki” : Allan Wilkie and his Shakspearian
people, now touring Maoriland, were inter-
rupted by the crash of the Tongariro on Bull
Rock, 40 miles from Napier. The co. was
playing at Gisborne and the Westralia was
being held back till 11.30 to carry the mum-
mers on to Napier. But just before sailing
time the stricken liner sent out a frenzied
5.0.5., and the Westralia immediately cast
off and raced away to the rescue, leaving-
actors and props behind. Melodrama in real
life spoils business, dear boy.
“J.F.H.”: A pair of Australian enter-
tainers, Martyn Hagan and. Lucy Fraser,
have made good at the Victoria Palace,
London. True, there is a curious conflict
of opinion about them. They serve up some-
thing so Australian that the Daily Tele-
graph can’t understand it, and yet so Eng-
lish that the Daily Chronicle is sick and
tired of it.
From London: —
Billjim, wounded or on leave, has had a
great chance at Covent Garden. Old Ellen Terry as
Portia, with her sister Marion as Nerissa; Mary
Anderson as Hermione; Hawtrey as Falstaff, with
Winifred Emery and Lady Tree as the two dames ; the
ancient Genevieve Ward as Volumnia; also Benson,
Fred Terry, Alexander (as Benedick), Irene Van-
brugh, Mrs. Pat Campbell, and a host of the moderns.
And at Middle Temple “Twelfth Night” has been
given on the very scene of its original performance.
Alexander and Ellen Terry gave a Benedick and Bea-
trice scene; and, in the open air, the rose-plucking-
episode from “Henry VI.” was played on the very
Temple-garden spot where it happened—if it ever did.
There were heaps of Anzacs, too, at the Actors’
Orphanage garden-party, where were to be seen in the
side-shows almost every celebrity of the regular or the
music-hall stage. Our own Marie Lohr was Goddess
of Flowers, and Madge Titheradge heroine in a bur-
lesque drama.
“U.S.”: After two years’ battling, the
lawyers have considerately given up fighting
o\er the fat estate of Lilian Nordica. Judge
Lawrence, of New Jersey, upholds the will
made in Thursday Island, whereby her three
sisters, Mrs. Castillo, Mrs. Baldwin and
Mrs. Walker, share £200,000 —or what the
sharks have left of it. Her maid, Marie
Masino, gets £lOOO, and Romayne Simmons,
her well-known secretary and pianist, £6OOO.
He was in her employ 16 years. Nordica’s
husband, G. W. Young, is left out in the
cold entirely, in consideration of her having
advanced £BO,OOO to him. A former will,
disallowed, made him chief beneficiary.
“C. Ockney” : Although it is alleged that
one effect of the new amusements tax has
been to drive the British public into the
cheaper-priced seats, in the first six weeks
of its operation it dropped £400.000 into the
national war chest. The Chancellor optimis-
tically remarks that if in the worst weeks
of the year such a sum can be collected, the
original estimate of five millions for the
twelve-month has a very good chance of being-
realised.
One hoary hypocrisy has just been ended
in London. For years past picture-palaces
have been allowed to open on Sundays if the
profits went to “charities.” And of. course
they did: every manager made his own
“charity.” The London County Council has
now drawn up a list, and if the show isn’t
to benefit one or other of these it mustn’t
be held. Detailed and audited accounts must
also be presented at prescribed periods.
A VERY WORTHY DEMON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Signor Oacialli’s Mefistofle was somewhat heavy.
At moments one imagined that the demon was over
serious. His mocking- serenade was sung- with more
tenderness and refinement in expression than is
usually noted, but his sardonic laughter was a
little forced. The incantation to the night, in the
garden, in which usually the fiend is typical of the
power for evil, was lacking in that element.
—Sydney paper.
Mephisto was a gentleman;
He traded down in Hades
And never danced the mad can-can
Or went with frisky ladies.
He paid his rent, his taxes too,
He never sought the ready Jew;
He played at bowls and paid his sub.,
Was captain of the rifle club,
Supported Wade and Joseph Cook,
Condemned the Kaiser by the Book,
Attended church each Sabbath morn,
And looked on Sunday trams with scorn;
The only soul he wanted was
The one he owned himself, because
Despite his snigger and red light,
He was a good suburbanite
Whose next-door neighbors—Smith and Jeff —
Spoke fondly of as “good old Meph.”
The story, told in any court,
Would make the kindest Justice snort,
And Faust the Law would have to beat
Or pay a dole to Marguerite;
While Meph. would be discharged and told
His character was good as gold.
His friends, to mark their approbation,
Then organised a presentation.
(Conclusion of speech by Mayor of Hades.)
“So, gentlemen, I now ’ave great pleasure in pre-
sentin’ to our re-spected old friend —(Cheers) —-
presentin’ to our dear old friend Mr. Mephisto this
’ere tip-top ’luminated address testifyin’ to ’is worth
—(Cheers) —an’ this ’ere purse o’ sovereigns to
cover ’is legal expenses. (Loud and continued
cheers.) An’ I think I may say, on be’arf of all
those present, that if th’ time ever should come
when ’e ’as to defend ’is good name again, well,
we’ll stand be’ind ’im once more an’ proud to do
it! (Tremendous demonstration.)
Grand chorus of aldermen, ratepayers, church-
wardens, etc.: —•
Oh-h, for he’s a jolly good de-mon!
Yes, he’s a jolly good de-mon!
Oh, he’s a jolly good de-e-mon!
And so say all'of us! (HIP-HIP-HOORAY!!)

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I’m waiting for this play about
Our Billy Hughes,” said he.
“It should be something stirring,
Worth a bob or two to see.
“I guess ’twill show us English scenes,
With crowds a-going mad
Through Billy’s red-hot speeches—
He’s the knoek-’em-bandy lad !
“We’ll see the hot-air patriot
To Billy touch his hat,
And say, ‘Here, take old Asquith’s job.’ ”
Said I: “What play is that ?”
Says he: “I see you’re one of them
For argument that spoils-—-
The play’s been talked about for weeks:
It’s ‘While Our Billy Boils’!”

BEAUTY WITHOUT ROUGE, CREAM
OR POWDER.
A PARISIAN COMPLEXION SECRET.
Contrary to the usual belief, the most
beautiful French ladies rarely use rouge,
or creams or powders containing bismuth
or caustic alkali, claiming, and with very
good reason, that such preparations not
only give a made-up appearance, but ulti-
mately ruin the complexion. When asked
what they use to preserve and enhance their
beauty, they invariably give the _ credit to
the regular use of an inexpensive lotion
(obtainable of any good chemist) prepared
by mixing 2oz. Rose Water with
Flowers of Oxzoin and 1 dram Tincture ot
Benzoin. Apply every night and morning
with a soft cloth or sponge. It quickly tones
up the dullest skin and gives a fresh rose-
bloom complexion, such as is usually seen
only in youth. Although nothing has vet
been found which completely removes deep
wrinkles, this makes them far less apparent,
and a lady using it regularly is certain never
to have a badly wrinkled lace. Ao\ l.

“N.Q.”: Before he got into khaki Cleve-
land was in a Queensland bank, where he
had been trained by a Scotch manager to
part with nothing without a voucher. With
his mates he had made an impudent little
raid and had netted four prisoners. Cleve-
land was potted in both legs, but not so
badly that he couldn’t hobble back in charge
of the haul. He just managed to get home
to the trench when he collapsed, and a
corporal beckoned to the Huns to follow
him. The all-out Cleveland looked up and
saw what was happening. “Heigh!” he
called out. “Bring them back. I want a
voucher for ’em.”
THE REMNANT SALE.
HE: “If you don't accept me I’ll marry
Elsie.”
SHE: “ She’ll probably rush you. She loves
remnants.”
A note from a S. Australian wasp :
We are billeted in farmhouses and are comfort-
able, too. From the appearance of the country
around the aerodrome you could never tell there was
a war on within six miles. People—mostly. women—
work in the fields taking no notice whatever of the
machines passing overhead or the transport and
troops on the road.
For the last week or so the weather has been wet
and cloudy—the only thing that stops flying. In
fact, in the last nine days I’ve only been over the
lines three times. When there is no flying we just
poke about, and get very fed-up of doing nothing.
I'd sooner be up among the “Archies.” The Huns
toss them up, and all of a sudden you hear n terrific
bang and see a puff of smoke. The first dozen or so
scare the life out of you. Directly one bursts you
turn sharply and dodge about so that they lose your
range. Sometimes they toss up six or eight at once,
and they burst with puffs of smoke all around you;
but it is wonderful how close they can come without
hitting you. It seems incrediole when you think of
all the bits of shrapnel that go buzzing about.
I haven’t had a duel in the air yet, though of
course we always take up a couple of machine-guns
—very fine, throwing out 47 rounds in ssec.
Our principal job is co-operation with the artil-
lery. The machines are fitted with wireless, and we
fly up and down the lines directing the fire and send-
ing corrections until the targets are wiped out. The
other morning I was on early patrol and saw a train
about six miles behind the German lines. I called
up one of the heavy batteries, and the first shot
those wonderful fellows put over was a direct hit,
which blew all the gladness out of that train. After a
half-dozen or so more it was nothing but a mass of
burning wreckage. I looped the loop for joy.
Another job is early-and-late patrol. This means
walking up and down the Front at a height of about
two miles for two or three hours on end. It i,s
done at daybreak and dusk, the object being to spot
flashes of hostile batteries and note them down for
future attention; also to keep hostile machines from
coming over our side of the lines on reconnaissance.
It is n deadly job, monotonous and cold. No matter
how much clothing you put on you get frozen to the
bone every time. Fur-lined boots and two pairs of
socks are no protection to the feet.
It’s fine meeting other machines in the air. There
are always one or two of our big fighting craft
patrolling up and down, and when we run across
them we get as close as possible and cheer. Not that
the other fellow hears, because the roar of the engines
makes it difficult to even hear yourself. It is, by
-the way, very hard to see other machines when you
are in the air; and though there may be six in sight
when you leave the ground, the chances are that you
won’t see one until you come down again. This
makes it all the more cheering when you do meet
another chap on the same job as yourself.

“Billy Blue”: One of the three oldest
houses in N. S. Wales passed through the
market the other day when Berkshire Park,
at the junction of South Creek and Rich-
mond-road, was sold for £3500. Berkshire
Park was a grant of 320 acres to Richard
Rouse, who arrived in the ship Nile in 1801,
having as a fellow-passenger the famous
Margaret Catchpole. Rouse came out as
overseer of works and was placed in charge
of the Hawkesbury district. Later he went
on the land (an easy process in those days
of grants) and built Berkshire Park house.
That was 102 years ago, and it looks good
for another century.
Nutter Thomas, the most commonplace
man with whom our vicious system of im-
porting unknown bishops 'ever punished
us, has been putting a finger into
the political pie in Adelaide and get-
ting it almost snapped off. After say-
ing something about labor, which Craw-
ford A r aughan resented, he took up the
“Christian” attitude that we mustn’t boy-
cott the German after the war. Apparently,
according to these people, who mistake
stupidity for Christianity, war gives a nation
a kind of dispensation whereby it is entitled
to stick others through the vitals so long
as, after peace is made, it patches them up
with sticking-plaster and fits them out for
another war. It is probably their training
with regard to the Devil that spoils this
type of parson. “Be kind to the poor Devil,”
they say in effect. “Never quite kill him.
If you did, how could you keep people from
being wicked?” That really was the old
“Christian” attitude towards venei’eal
disease. It is quite likely Nutter Thomas’s
still.

A lesson in English :
On leave in London, and during an interval’s
respite from the inanities of Geo. Grossmith, I
adjourned to the bar of the Gaiety, accompanied
by a cobber. Presently I felt a nervous plucking
at my sleeve, and turned to encounter a harmless-
looking vassal in liverj'. “Er —er —excuse me, sir—
but —er —a friend of yours wants to see you.” I
looked around, but failed to sight the familiar uni-
form. “Who the dickens wants me?” I asked.
“Well —er —er”— he stammered, “he’s over there.
One of yore chaps. I think he’s a little —ahem—
under the inflooenee.” We followed through
the crowd to a cosy corner, and there I beheld
my first and only exhilarated Australian during my
stay of eight days.
lie was a long Light Ilorse-man with a beery grin
in his eyes. One arm was thrown across the back of
the settee as he leaned airily over a little English
lieutenant who was reclining thereon, but certainly
not at ease. When we arrived the little lieutenant
was obviously stuck for a reply to something his
tormentor had asked.
“Now look ’ere, sport,” the Anzac persisted after
a pause. “Own up y’—hie!—cairn’ arns’rr me that
—hie—questi’n, can y’ now?”
The little man in the elegant uniform wngglcd
wretchedly and kept silent.
“Bee-dubblehee-ar spells beer-r-r-r — not bee,yaw !”
continued the Anzac emphatically. “You think y’—

But I’ve drunk tons uv—hie — beer-r-r — but not

enthusiastically, with a wave of his arms, “tons ’v’

“Hi!” we called with wily cheerfulness, as one

sweeping hand brushed my pal's chest. “D’yer want
t’ knock us about?”
Bill dropped his arms for a moment and turned
to gaze upon us.
“Come here, you ol’ !” he gurgled affec-
tionately, flopping his arms about us. “Coman-
averdrink! Com’an’ave a beer-r-r-r —but not bee-
yahl” he added joyously, as he turned to smile again
on his victim on the settee. The look of relief on
the latter’s face momentarily changed to one of
renewed anguish at this fresh attention; but we
seized the opportunity to murmur enticing things
in Bill’s ears; and taking him by the arm edged
him along in the direction of the bar, which we
knew would now alas! be closed.
As we moved off, Bill looked clumsily over his
shoulder at his late victim, and with a grin took a
last lingering shot: “It’s a terrible wa — wall—eh,
wot?”
The little military dude on the settee shuddered
horribly. Then sitting up erect he remained like a
statue, with dead codfish eyes protruding from his
little flushed face.
* * * *
Seemingly Britain doesn’t yet realise that
it is at war; or is it that the Law just must
be a meticulous ass? After a baby-murder-
ing Zeppelin had been brought down by
aeroplanes somewhere outside London lately,
the Law sorted out the remnants of the
Hun crew and solemnly—held an inquest
on them! If France knocked off toil to
“sit on” every dead invader the Coroner
would be worked to death, and the Army
be so busy wagging its chin in the witness-
box that it would have to make actual war
only an every-other-day job.

“0.K.”: In a recent Bulletin somebody
writes: —
How woman does love to dress the part! If she
were sentenced to be shot at dawn her first thought
would be a something in grey and rose to be in
harmony with the sunrise.
When the notorious Mrs. Manning was sen-
tenced to be hanged beside her husband on a
scaffold erected outside Newgate Gaol, she
got permission to make her last public
appearance in her best black-satin gown,
because her friends had always professed to
think she looked sweet in that particular out-
lit. The whole silk manufacturing ( and
drapery world was instantly affected. Black
satin dropped right out of fashion, and it
remained out for 25 years or more. Then, at
last, the long pent-up feeling for black satin
burst forth with unparalleled violence, and
•no woman of fashion wore anything else. In
fact, she’d be hanged if she’d go through the
season without a black satin.
Dr. James Ormond, health officer at Mal-
vern (Vic.), gave evidence the other day
against a local shopman charged by the
municipal inspector with having sold unwhole-
some fish. Ormond deposed that the whiting-
in the case was “in a state of decomposition,
but not in an advanced state.” The Mal-
vern Court, finding it had a majority in
favor of the fish that was merely decom-
posed, dismissed the case and gave three
guineas costs against the municipality. That’ll
teach ’em to go interferin’ with honest shop-
keepers who get a bit of ripe stock left on
their ’ands.
THE (NEARLY) NAKED TRUTH.

A SONG OF SOCKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She started a pair of socks for Bill —
That was the least that she could do ;
He’d gone to the wars our foes to kill;
Ivnicketty-click the needles flew.
She wove with each stitch she knitted in
Hopes that her William, staunch and true,
Would feel in the battle’s smoke and din
Knit to her heart with meshes new.
Now, when it was time to turn the heel,
Katie, engrossed in thoughts of Jim,
Kept time with the click of heart and steel,
Purling her wool and love of him.
For tight with each twist a wish was spun:
Kind Heaven preserve her Jim from ill—
From the risk that her soldier-boy must run.
(Fes, but you said his name was Bill!)
Knick-knicketty-click the stitches sped,
Weaving a leg and ankle slim,
And “Danny, my dear!” the needles said.
(Dieken, old man , his name was Jim !)
“Knick-knicketty-click, my loving care
Runs in the wool,” she sang ( and lo
This morning Katie unravelled the pair,
Finding they ivere too small for Joe!).

I know I cannot make her mine;
There never was a girl more chaste;
To me she seems a thing divine.

But still, her mouth, more red than wine,
Unlikely seems to go to waste.
I know I cannot make her mine—
There never was a girl more chased!

GROSS, FEVERISH, BILIOUS CHILDREN
need CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Look, Mother! See if the tongue is
coated; this denotes sluggish
liver and bowels.
Mother! You’re child isn’t naturally cross
and peevish. See if the tongue is coated;
this is a sure sign that its little stomach,
liver and bowels need attention at once.
When listless, pale, feverish, “stuffy” with
cold, throat sore ; when the child lias tainted
breath and doesn’t eat, sleep or act naturally
or has stomach-ache or diarrhoea, remember,
fl gentle liver and bowel cleansing should
always be the first treatment given.
Nothing equals California Syrup of Figs
—“Califig”—for children’s ills; give a tea-
spoonful, and in a few hours all the waste
matter, sour bile and fermenting food clogged
in the bowels pass out of the system, and
you have a healthy and playful child again.
All children love this harmless, delicious
fruit laxative, and it never fails to effect a
good "inside cleansing.” Directions for
babies, children of all ages and grown-ups
are plainly on the bottle.
Keep it handy in your home. A little
given to-day saves a sick child to-morrow,
but get the genuine. Ask your chemist for
a bottle of “Califig”—California Syrup of
Figs—then look and see that it is made by
the California Fig Syrup Company. Refuse
substitutes. All chemists sell “Califig”—
California Syrup of Figs—in bottles of two
sizes, Is. lid. and Is. 9d. [4

Recently a paper printed a beautiful tale
as to the number of chaplains provided for
the garrison of ex-German Papua. Accord-
ing to the yarn, two £7OO chaplains were
ministering to 150 men—-that is, at an annual
cost per soul of £9 odd. It wasn’t strictly
accurate. The New Guinea shepherd gets
only 235. a day, plus field allowance, and
there is but one of him. Still, as even Bill
of Berlin probably surmises by this, it isn’t
now absolutely necessary to garrison Rabaul
with more than two men and one macaw, or
thereabouts, and a whole chaplain at about
£5OO a' year is an expensive luxury for times
when economy is the watchword. It looks
like a case where a bush missionary or a
bundle of tracts might fill the bill.

He took her with

visited every Aus-

“glorious scenery of

memory of the grand

remarkable success
of the lirst Lady

Last week South Australia had its annual
demonstration of a social feature in which
it leads all other States. Nearly every town-
ship has an Institute controlling its own
affairs, but with a Council in Adelaide to
exercise a general supervision, and in “Show
Week” the delegates meet in the city to talk
things over. There was no Show this year,
but the meeting was held all the same. There
are 225 Institutes averaging 70 subscribers
each, with buildings valued at a quarter of
a million. Government subsidises subscrip-
tions with 15s. per pound, and also makes
a small grant to the Council, out of which
are bought new books —no fiction —that are
sent round in boxes of 60, and finally given
away. A lending library is a feature of
every Institute, but a free reading-room is
generally added, with such classes as the
neighborhood seems to need. Some of the
ports and railway towns have a splendid
list of classes. Other features maintained
by the Council are a big reference library,
any volume from which is sent anywhere on
demand, and a lecture-list, a dozen promi-
nent Adelaide men holding themselves in
readiness to go to any Institute and talk on
their own subjects, from poultry or the salt-
industry to astronomy or Matthew Arnold’s
poetry.

doesn’t think the screw offered by a N. S.
Wales Government Department for poultry
experts enticing. Here are some more ad-
vertised by the Public Service Board du ing
the year :—-
Assistant orchardist at Yanco. —To have sound
training in theory and practice of fruit-growing and
preserving; to be able to prune and treat trees for
pest; salary £IOO, with board and residence.
Housemaster for Wagga.—To instruct in prin-
ciples of agriculture, bookkeeping, mathematics and
agricultural physics, botany and chemistry; salary
£l5O, with board and residence.
Laboratory assistant and assistant teacher of
chemistry.—£lso, ranging to £2OO.
This is how the State encourages that scien-
tific research and experiment of which it is
so much in need. These jobs ought to be
prizes for our best brains and their oppor-
tunities for great national service. But any
head ribbon salesman or bookmaker’s clerk
would laugh at the salaries they carry. It’s
waste of time trying to hire original thinkers
at pick-and-shovel rates.

“Try Fluke”: The pakcha witch-doctor is
doing the bona fide brown tohunga out of
his job. . One of the white-skinned tribe —he
called himself a “professor”—was up before
Chief Justice Stout at Napier (M.L.) lately
on charges of extracting money by false
pretences, various Maoris having reported
that he had promised to “get te missus te
kid all right” in consideration of sundry
guineas. One dark lady described the pro-
cess of increasing the birth-rate, as prac-
tised by the long-haired prof. She had been
married for eight years and was childless.
Longing for a tamaiti she paid the wizard
£7 7s. for a course of strenuous massaging—
over her glad rags, by the way—followed up
by prayers and divers medicines. As this
failed to produce results te missus and her
lienare stepped round to the police-station
and told things. “Te ol’ Maori way te
bes’,”. comments a tattooed wahine of ripe
experience. “S’pose te missus she te pukupa
—you know, no chil’ren —and she say, ‘Py

Werra, s’pose you te liusban’, you take her

me; I got te boss karakia, by Kris’.” Evi-
dently Stout thought so to. So he fined the
white professor £ls0 —and the fine was paid !
“T.C.”: As we passed through France
one platform was rushed by a mob of slim
youths in the hobbledehoy stage. They
carried red, white and blue streamers, wore
gilded badges, waved flags and patriotic
emblems, and rushed about seizing our
hands and cheering us. This jarred on us.
Ic seemed very un-Frencli as I had found
the people; it reminded me unpleasantly
of Empiah Day flam, and the flag-flapning
brand of patriotism—which was mostly hot
air—calling the Other Bloke a hero and
slapping him on the back and pushing him
oft’ to the Front. But our displeasure was
brief. By the use of some atrocious French
we learned that they had just attained the
ripe age for military training, and were
expecting to commence right away. To
reach such enthusiasm after what France
has seen of war struck me as something
that demanded even an Englishman’s
phlegmatic admiration.
“Tom D.” tells the end of an old ship’s
story:—•
I started to remember old days when I read that
par. about the sailing ship Prince Regent arriv-
ing in Port Adelaide after a long voyage which
had been made alcoholic by a shortage of fresh water
and a heavy cargo of stout and other bottled joys. I
guess that must have been about the Prince’s last
long trip, for her bones have been lying on South
Trees Island beach, near Gladstone (Q.), for over 40
years. The Prince began life as the Royal yacht
of George IV. when he was Prince Regent. In her old
age she was just a sea dray, and on her last job
struck rough weather off the Bananaland coast and
put into Port Curtis (now Gladstone) for repairs.
But the old hooker was so weary that when they

drink for the party?”
MR. C LAY: “It’s (hie!) all ri’, my dear —
I've got it somewhere about, me!"
beached her and the water receded the rotten ribs
collapsed. The late Mr. Evens, of Gladstone, bought
the hull and a Captain Norris the rigging. The
wheel was ebony inlaid with engraved silver and was
sold for £75. When I took up the island in 1895
the old wreck had been well stripped, all except the
port side and keel, which were buried in the mud
and were only approachable at low spring tides. I
bought the lot for £2 and got £OO of metal, includ-
ing a ton of lead, which had been placed along one
side of the keel under the lining, and was brand;d
with the broad arrow, as. was every spike and belt.
I got the copper keel bolts, each of which weighed
2Slb. and was Oft. long, and any amount of gunmetal
spikes. I was told that the last spike driven was a
gold one, but I never sighted it. I could only work
on the wreck at very low tides, and then only for a
few minutes at a time. The place was alive with
sharks and I had one or two very close calls from
them, but a closer one from dynamite, Reckoning in
working time and risks taken, I reckon I earned my
£OO.
A KURDISH LAMENT.
[Translated for THE BULLETIN.]
A Russian official message states: “On our West-
ern Front the situation is unchanged. In the direc-
tion of Bitlis we drove the Kurds to Tchukhurmor-
shen, pressing them back as far as Tchaukis.”
Never again shall I see my beloved Tchukhurmor-
shen !
Never again !
I have left my heart behind me in Tchukhurmorshen.
Also my luggage.
My beloved is left all alone in the hills of
Tchukhurmorshen—•
On the beautiful hills of Tchukhurmorshen.
O Tchukhurmorshen ! O Tchukhurmorshen !
Your hills are as cold as my heart, white Tchukhur-
morshen !
And the night comes down with a crash, dear
Tchukhurmorshen,
Like a falling Kurdish dictionary, my Tchukhur-
morshen !
I shall never forget you, O Tchukhurmorshen!
I am proud of you, Tchukhurmorshen !
Because I have learnt how to spell you, Tchukhur-
morshen !
But we’ve gone back a hiccup or two to the wide
plains of Tchaukis!
It isn’t so sweet in the mouth as you, Tchukhur-
morshen !
But it saves ink and time when the Cossacks are
riding, lost Tchukhurmorshen !
Ah, Tchukhurmorshen! Oh, Tut-tut-tut-tut. (Line

“The resignation of Falkenhayn, late German Chief of Staff, was due to the fact that he favored a withdrawal from the West Front.”
KAISER: “There can be no withdrawal. We have promised our people that this shall remain German soil.”

REINFORCEMENTS.
THE GENERAL: “Cut up and tired, are you, and want reinforcements? Well, hang on till October 28. Then I will be able to tell you if

ARCHBISHOP RILEY. Perth, W.A., now
on his way to the Front as Chaplain-
General of the Commonwealth Forces.
When the time seemed ripe M illiam
Morris Hughes was given the refusal of a
title. But he respectfully declined, recog-
nising, perhaps, that in Australia a man in
deep political waters is greatly encumbered
by a weight swung round the neck.
A. J. McLachlan, for three years president
of the Liberal Union of S. Aus., has passed
the job on to A. W. Piper, K.C., another
lawyer who has never been in Parliament.
Somehow or other C. O. Kingston’s law
partners were always on the anti-Labor
side. First there was Hall; then the bril-
liant George Ash; finally McLachlan.
McLachlan had the business head and
-orderly habits that Kingston badly needed
in a partner. Shortly after, at Kingston’s
invitation and on kindly old Judge
Boucaut’s advice, McLachlan left his coun-
try practice and went to Adelaide, Kingston
got very busy on Federal matters, and it
was only then that his young partner dis-
covered the awful tangle the senior’s private
affairs were in. Kingston had no idea of it
himself. After months of effort a balance-
sheet was produced. It showed Kingston
heavily in debt, of course. “Oh, is that all? ’
said Kingston. “We’ll soon get rid of that.”
But there is no doubt that in getting rid of
it—as he did —he wore himself out.
Sydney papers sideslipped the other day
when, in announcing the 102nd birthday of
an old lady, they stated that her father
arrived in Australia in 1804 when Want and
Thirlow were the only firm of solicitors in
Australia. In 1804 there were not any
regular solicitors at all. There were four
men who had been solicitors in England but
had been transported
for criminal offences
and struck off the
rolls. They practised
in an irregular way
in Sydney for many
years, but the advent
of English judges
put a stop to it.
The first solicitor
properly qualified to
practise was William
Henry Moore, who
arrived in Sydney in
1814, and he was
followed by Frederick
darling in 1815.
Randolph John
Want (pioneer of
the legal family)
and William Thirlow
were not admitted
till 1887, at which
date the Roll was
getting lengthy.
ERNIE FARRAR,
M.L.C.,
of the Sydney P.I.L.
Freeborn, who is Parliamentary Librarian
at Adelaide, was tutor to Queen Mary (when
she was young Princess May) and her

So long. Lukin :
Dead at 76, Greslev Lukin ; and there lire men
all over Australia who are sorry. Born in the Speck
ho started to do things in an engineering shop,
drifted on to the stage in Melbourne, where he
played with Brooke, and in the early ’6o's
commenced to gfeel his feet in the public service of
Bananaland. there he became chief clerk in the
Justice and Lands Departments. Red Tape chafed
his soul, and in 1873 he cut adrift and took over
the Brisbane Courier and Queenslander. But the
politics of Lukin were not the politics of Fat in
those days, and after six strenuous years he founded
the Boomerang, and later came to Sydney. For a
time he ran the Globe and was mixed up in various
business propositions and mining enterprises. Twenty
years ago he drifted to Maoriland, and, when E. T.
Giilon died, slipped into the vacant editorial chair
of the Wellington Post, shortened sail, lived mostly
i„ the past and thanked the Lord he was, a Radical
once, anyhow. Away back in the days when giant
Labor began to stir in his sleep—when the first dim
i t | eas of an Australian nationalism commenced to
get expression; when big battles were fought by
the common herd against the exploiters-—Lukin
stood for progress and democracy and the decent
thing. He touched life at many points, and in
his Australian days lived every hour of them. In
Maoriland —well, he was getting old when he went
there and he was content to look on. Of late years
he grew stout and solemn as a cathedral. But he
never wanted to live a day longer than he was able
to keep in the procession. And when he dropped
out the procession was short of a big-hearted man
and a good Australian.
Annie Kenney, the suffragist who is going
to persuade W. M- Hughes to go back to
London and save the Empire if Asquith will
kindly let him, isn’t at all the virago that
one might imagine from her window-smash-
ing and politician-baiting exploits in the old
militant days. She is a slim, slight little
lady with a vivacious manner, a pretty,
piquant face and reddish hair, a good taste
in dress, and apparently the means to in-
dulge it. She says she came here toi ho
health, and to see relations in Sydney, and
study conditions, and that the presenting o
the petition to Hughes to 8« baf^ r t . < ? J f'
land is a mere incident. The Melbourne
Trades Hall women have some sense ot
humor, hv the way. They passed a resolu-
tion hoping that Miss Kenney would succeed
in inducing Hughes to go to London again.
They even hoped he would stay them.
Australia has now produced a flying giant.
Ilis name is Cuttle, he hails from the Mallee
in Victoria, and his height is six feet eight
weight and width in proportion. Ihe giant s
parents run a glad-rag and grocery business
at Ultima, and they address his letters at
present to an aviation camp in Lngland.
Lieut M. Kozminsky, of the big hat-fabri-
cating family, died in action the other day in
France. “Morry” was the eldest of the
Ivozminsky sons, a big, amiable lad> with so
frequent a smile that his friends Will have
the impression of his going down in the fiehl
with it still there. He enlisted in the hope of
getting an aviation job, but, being disap-
pointed, worked hard for his lieutenancy, am
won through in fine style. A good Australian
who has proved it.
Sidney Flint, dead in Adelaide at 62, was
an ex-bank-manager with an expert know-
ledge of pictures and old books. He took up.
the subject professionally a few years ago,
and was in wide demand as a valuer.
Forty years ago a young man in Queens-
land named Joseph Watson lost the use of
his eyes. He recovered his sight as the
result of treatment at the Melbourne Hospi-
tal by the late surgeon Fitzgerald, and pro-
mised that if he ever became rich he would
not forget the hospital. He didn’t, either;
and when he died the other day, in Sydney,
he left it a useful legacy of £lOOO.
Monsignor Beecliinor, of Launceston, is
writing the “Life” of stately old Dr. Murphy,
who was Bishop of Hobart before the las-
manian capital was made an archbishopric.
Much of his life was spent in India, and as
there were great doings while he was there
his nephew’s story ought to be full of in-
terest.
In Maoriland the other day, after much
talk of the wonders of the Dominion’s
finance, a man in the crowd called for three
cheers for Sir Jewsepli Ward.
Paddy Minahan, the diminutive M.L.A.
just defeated in the Labor selection for the
Sydney constituency of Belmore, is one ot
three brothers who have built up a sizeable
business as manufacturers of better-grade
footwear. Their father drove an awl and
waxed a thread at Ivillaloe, Ireland.
Although there has been an extraordinary
growth of manufacturing businesses since
the tariff began to operate, those interests
have not found their way to Parliament. In
fact, Minahan’s election gave the N. S. Wales
Assembly the only factory man it had for
years. Later it got Simon Hickey, also a
Labor man. Calico-Jimmyism, on the other
hand, has always been fully represented—
of late years by Dave Storey and Cocks,
of York-street in particular.

Passed out the other day in an English
military hospital, “Bill” Kitchen, of Gilgan-
dra (N.S.W.), who originated and led the
route march of “Coo-ees” from Gilgandra
to Sydney 12 months ago—the first of a
number of similar comic-opera recruiting
efforts made in the Ma State last year. The
Sydney press of those days knew him as
“captain,” but he was corporal on the A.I.Fj
pay-roll. Born at Mudgee (N.S.W.) oj
years ago, Kitchen was a plumber by trade;
and was on the committee of pretty well
every local institution at Gilgandra, from
the jockev club to the church bazaar. Ilis
closest call, before diabetes and heart trouble
gave the signal for the Last Post, was
on Boxing Day, 1913, when a rotten staging
gave way while he and his son were patching
up a jump, and threw the pair to the bottom
of a well 80ft. deep. The son, a stripling of
16, managed to climb up a pipe to the sur-
face and hauled his injured dad out.
The ex-First Lord of the Admiralty has
lost a relative in Winston Churchill
Simmons, who died the other day at Rich-
mond (Tas.). aged 90. He was the Speck a

Died in Melbourne, Major Chalmers Duff;
a retired officer of the Indian army who
only had one arm but could fill his pipe
as well as the next man. He lost his other
wing through the cowardice of an Indian
servant who bolted with the rifle at a criti-
cal moment. A good chessplayer, he nun ed

until the Master Player swept him oft the
board at 87.

only got his medical degree last year.
Albert Mansbridge, who ran through Aus-
tralia a few years ago to start the Workers

pression of being a well-meaning if rather
futile person, has hatched out, along with
about <»o other cranks, a “basis of

tories or an equivalent, and another thai
they are to be given an “open door wher-

They sauntered to their duels then and gave no sign
of death
Until the shotted carronades puffed forth their feetid
breath ;
Xo leagues of sea between them lay—wood decks were
torn and scarred
At shouting range. They could have fought in '
anyone's backyard.
A hundred years and ten went by ere fleet called
out to fleet,
And Nelson on his column stood at gaze amid the
sleet;
While busy London roared below he watched the
ships go out,
And in his old-time sailor’s mind sprang up the
coward Doubt,
For ’neath the great ships’ decks he saw the modern
engineers—•
Strange men who knew not Trafalgar and all those
glorious years.
“My service!” said the Admiral. “And yet it does
not seem
The sort of thing I would have done ! Mayhap it is
a dream.”
But when the Victory squadrons turned (heir broad,
contemptuous sterns
Upon the shattered Ilun, like something base a victor
spurns,
And England’s might came steaming home in solemn
majesty
With spaces in the even lines where sunken ships
should be,
The Admiral in London heard a faint Trafalgar cheer
Ringing along the decks of Time —Bravo the
Engineer !
The gunner is as old as war —we knew he couldn't,
fail.
But now we’ve proved the Man of Steam! The
Engineer—All Hail!

Note that the profits are stated gross. That
is, without deduction of an amount neces-
sary to cover wear and tear and provide for
the replacement of the fleet, etc. Overhauls
are, however, paid for out of revenue, so
the real profit for the half-year was £33,045
less whatever depreciation was not made
good by repairs, etc., paid for during the
period. The Profit and Loss account alleges
that “trading profits, dividends/, interest,
etc.,” amounted to £32,753, and management
charges to come out of this were £9245. So
on the co.’s figures we get this :
Profit earmarked to cover depreciation.. £7,952
Profit to cover insurance risks . . .. 1,585
Net profit .. .. .. . . .. 23,508
Total as above .. . . .. £33,045
That £7952 is equal to very nearly 5 p.c.
p.a. not only on the steamers, tugs, lighters,
etc., but also on the city freehold and on
works and docks, etc.; and that is probably
ample. If so the net profit is very fine on
a capital of £251,000. For the past year it
was just 20 p.c. all round.
But the finances of most cos. have been
disturbed lately; to get a truer view
look back a bit: —

Liquid assets. . .. 50,905 132,418 158,101
Liabilities . . . . 33,142 39,415 45,671
During those six years the co. has got in
£60,000 of capital. (Capital is now £281,000
as against £170,000 in 1910; but £51,000
of the £lll,OOO was transferred from
reserves.) Very well, deduct £60,000 from
the increase of liquid assets and deduct
again the £12,529 by which liabilities have
grown. Then you have £34,667 as the net
growth of liquid assets for which new capital
was not responsible. Meantime £105.264
has been spent on the purchase of ship
and other property; total £139,931. Or
put it this way : after adding the Dimboola,
and replacing the Kapunda by the Wool gar,
and making a few other changes in the fleet,
and adding substantially to freeholds and
plant, the co. has put by nearly £35,000 in
six years. Against the additions to the
fleet have of course to be set depreciation
not covered by renewals; but if 5 p.c. p.a.
were allowed on all non-liquid assets of the
co., the co. would still be £55 000 to the
good in the past six years, after paying
dividends running up to 15 p.c. It is
altogether a fine performance.

So as to obviate the necessity of having one
balance-sheet prepared for the Federal
Income Tax officers and another three
months later for the shareholders, the eo.'s
balancing date has been altered, and the
figures in the last line are for nine months
only. For that period, after writing down
shares in other cos. from £2906 to £1906,
the B. and L. account discloses a balance
of £15,825 to the good ; but “owing to the
uncertainty as to what direction taxation
may follow, and what will be the basis of
the War Time Profits Bill,” the Board has
transferred £5500 to suspense. For the pre-
sent, and with some hesitation, that amount
has been cut out of the table altogether.
E. Rich and Co. have had a typical Aus-
tralian career. The founder started as a
hawker in the N. S. Wales Far West, rose
on good seasons to affluence, and formed
this co. Drought presently struck it down,
and for a while it was really in pawn, its
affairs being managed from the London office
of Dalgety’s. Then Australia bobbed up again,
as it has a habit of doing; and Rich’s was
able to get free. For a while it made little
progress; naturally it had to a great extent
lost its grip on the N.S.W. back-country
trade. A couple of years ago it decided that
things were not so crowded up north, and
the business has been practically transferred
to Queensland.
The. position has changed remarkiably
during the past five years. Take these
figures:—
Liabilities. —• 1911. 1915. 1916.
Mortgages. . . . £17,250 £8,730 £8,730
Overdrafts, etc. . . 60,562 11,086 14,609

Stock . . . . 140,741 56,588 77,711
Sundries . . . . 5,618 30,886 20,082
The sundries are mostly cash and (this
year) War Loan. Liabilities, which were
once a very serious matter, have been
worked down to something very tame,
largely through the clearing-out of the ill-
chosen Sydney stock. Book debts are still
heavy. But you have to take the nature of
the business into account. Most of this
co.’s country customers collect the bulk of
their revenue in two or three cheques; and
they expect long terms of credit too. But,
to do them justice, they don’t as a rule
want nine months’ credit on cash terms.
Trouble only begins to arise when the bills
have to be extended and the trader can’t get
his bills extended. No co. engaged in
financing Australian pastoralists can afford
to do it on money that is liable to be called
for within five years. With that reserva-
tion there is no more profitable lot of clients
anywhere. So far. however, as this co. is
concerned, it has to be remembered that,
apart from general observation regarding
pastoral clients, there is very little on which
to guess its future. The past hardly counts.
Most of the business is new ; the managing
director came into that office only two or
three years ago, and with one exception
the directors have come on the Board within
the last year or two. The exception is the
man who acts as a sort of rubber-stamp in
London, where the registered office still is.

Tasmania set the modern fashion in six
o'clock referendums, and this co. will suffer
directly from the result. But while cold
water might be the death of some other
breweries, it is likely, in a roundabout way,
to put a lot of money into this one. Through
two channels. First, through the develop :
ment of water power, Tasmania promises
to have a new industrial life. How far this
business can be carried is as yet uncertain,
of course. For a start the island is going
to have electrolytic zinc works. It is
assumed that they will succeed; and though
there is no certainty about that, it is at
least sure that a very large volume of cheap
power will be available for some industrial
purpose. And in the second place the water
and the climate of the cold South are being
gradually recognised as an important asset
in brewing. So the Cascade “bottle” trade
is being pushed on the mainland, and for
the past half-year, the directors say, business
in Queensland shows a “remarkable in-
crease.” Further —and this is good Aus-
tralian news —“an increased trade in the
co.’s bottled stout is being experienced.”
Australia for many years made very poor
stout —raw stuff that frankly couldn’t stand
comparison with the Dublin goods. It will
take years to get the taste of that stuff oui
of the mouth ; but it will disappear gradu-
ally as it becomes known that excellent stout
is now being made in several places in Aus-
tralia. Hobart ought to be able to do
it better than most.
The co. has had a pretty long struggle
with a dead-weight represented by unpro-
ductive assets, chiefly the Cascade estate.
Little by little, however, things have im-
proved in 10 years:—

Book debts, etc... .. 25,173 18,784 15,898

That’s over £40,000 of interest-bearing debt
got rid of; and though one or two of the
assets have shrunk also, there is no sign
that that has alfected the earning power of
the co.
The directors, by the Way, through their
chairman (G. P. Fitzgerald), made an
unexpected proposal to shareholders at their
meeting the other day: —
The proposition was that of an institution he
wished to introduce into Tasmania, and which was
largely adopted in England, where it was chiefly
worked by Church of England clergymen. The in-
stitution he suggested would be a recreative resort,
where men could take refreshment after six o’clock,
and find in the institution a place of amusement
and a club. The place could be called a “Palace of
Pleasure,” and the company would offer £5OO
towards its creation. The building could be endowed
by the Government, and municipally, controlled. This
would be a means of keeping the trade together that
would otherwise be lost. He would like to see some-
thing of a constructive character from the people
who voted six o’clock. They could help in this work,
which would largely help to settle the'business.
This paper has been saying friendly things
about the “Disinterested Management”
movement in England for a good many years
past; but it hardly expected a brewery
chairman to give the system three cheers.
It looks from that as though there is a seri-
ous danger of actual prohibition in Tas-
mania ; and certainly from the brewery
point of view even “Disinterested Manage-
ment” would be better than that.

“C” shares ( 7 p.c.), 26/-paid .. 37,285
The “A” and “B” shares represent old
capital; the “C” issue is new capital, got
in since the Gas Act was passed. Under
that law the cos. were entitled to revalue
their assets and increase their capital to an
amount equal to their net assets. They are
entitled to pay 10 p.c. on that capital, But
of course on the well-written-up vfilue of
the assets they can’t earn 10 p.c. On new
capital they are entitled to pay 7 p.c. They
can’t earn that either. When the Act was
passed it was believed that it was no longer
any use buying gas shares for a rise. Any
increase in business would, it was supposed,
not benefit the co. to any extent, but would
go chiefly towards reducing the gas bill.
That turns out to have been quite a mistake.
The dividends last half-year amounted to
£8962. The dividends winch it is possible
to pay on the present capital under the Act
total £12,919. So shareholders may get
very nearly 50 p.c. more than they are draw-
ing at present without any reduction of the
price of gas—unless, of course, the matter is
dealt with by some authority not contem-
plated by the Gas Act.

Some minor adjustments of last year’s figures
have had to be made on account partly of
a clerical error in the stock-sheets. A very
frank management admits this slip in an
extension, instead of covering it up, 0-1
might easily have been done, in this year s
figures. The incident, by the way, illus-
trates what The Bulletin has said many
times about these trading concerns —that
profits depend entirely upon stocktaking.
The figures look a lot better than they
did even two years ago. At the end of July,
1914, the co. owed £41,719. Now, without
having got in any fresh share capital, tin-
liabilities ai’e down to £15,78(5. The co.
has brought this about by reducing both
stocks and book debts. Stocks stand now at
£55,080 as against the former £01,849; and
book debts are £40,214 as against £46,830.
Possibly the reduction of stocks is to some
extent due to war disturbance. But it
may also be due to the cutting out of
unprofitable lines. A co. with unlimited
capital can afford perhaps to carry and give
credit for lines which make big trading
figures without making big profits. But
that sort of business isn’t one for a co.
which has to trade on deposit money, as
this one was doing in 1914. Anyhow, if the
present higher level of profit can be main-
tained on the smaller stocks and book debts
and the consequent smaller liabilities, the co.
will be a much better investment than it
was a while ago. Capital is £75,563, of
which £21,470 is 7 p.c. preference. Twelve
thousand of this was represented by good-
will ; but, as the table shows, there are now
tangible assets to represent the whole
£75,563.

These greedy people, who have nearly
doubled their dividend in eight years, have
added only £7 to reserves since they put
up the distribution to 15 p.c. That is bad ;
and the accounts are badly presented. The
capital is £10,000; before the current div.
was paid there were £13,681 of accumulated
profits; and the co. owes £5004. That
makes £28,085, and £14,053 is merely repre-
sented as owing- by “sundry debtors.”
Apparently the co.’s customers see “David
Barclay, Chairman of Directors.” and are
prepared to sign “0.K.” to everything else.

But things, though bad enough, were not
quite as bad as one would judge from that
last line. No income tax provision was
made in the June-December half, while
£1343 was licked out of the past six months’
revenue. Owing to the drought of a year
or two ago practically no stock has been
shifted; and what little wheat was grown in
the district apparently hasn’t been sent
forward. No doubt the directors took all
these things into account before deciding
to pay out the usual 5 p.c. div. That they
don’t as a rule pay away every penny this
comparison shows: —

Capital now is £125.000, £25.000 of it
added five years ago; and considering the
seedy appearance of the concern it will sur-
prise most people that on that capital it
has got over £31,000 to the good in 10 years.
There may, certainly, be some depreciation
against that; but not much.

Just us there are mines that are mines and mines
that are “duffers” so does one of the principal of
mine equipments, i.e., belting, vary greatly accord-
ing to the maker. As the Goodyear Tyre and Rubber
Co. make, among many other things, belting that
satisfies the most exacting requirements of mining
operations from Alaska to the Panama Canal, and
even further south, they claim that all Australian
requirements are provided for in their extensive

Nobody would, we should think, touch the
shares in this co. unless he had more infor-
mation than the published accounts furnish.
And then there’s always a risk about an
interest in a concern of this sort: you’ve got
to be sure you can go on knowing as much
as the next fellow. It is easy enough to get
sufficient information to satisfy yourself
that something is good to buy. But you
also want to know when it is good to sell;
and if you are not “inside,” you want pub-
lished accounts that at least give you a
hint when to get an umbrella. These don’t
give you much in that way. In the first
place, though the co. is said to have £29,102
in excess of its capital, an unknown
amount of the capital is represented by “good-
will, water supply, etc.,” and whether the
tangible assets are worth even the £70,000
of capital this paper doesn’t know. And
whether enough or too much or too little is
struck off the profits to counterbalance the
depreciation of assets this paper doesn’t
know either. And we don’t get very much
by going back on our tracks. Three years
ago the co. owed £14,826; to-day it owes
£4544 less. Meantime it has added £11,062
to its liquid and semi-liquid assets. Total
improvement £15,606. Against that there
has been £lO,OOO of new capital. So the
business, in addition to paying tbe diminish-
ing dividend, has improved the liquid posi-
tion £5606 in three years, and has also paid
for repairs and renewals (unknown) and
added £6236 to the value of properties and
plant. The figures as far as they go look
all right. But, even so, The Bulletin
isn’t just now recommending beer trade in-
vestments to anybody who isn’t fond of
excitement.

A N.S.W. Gazette on Saturday an-
nounced for the second time the cancellation
of the Silver Peak leases. Litigation has
been proceeding ever since the first an-
nouncement was made last year. That can-
cellation took place owing to nonfulfilment
of labor conditions; and immediately Davis,
the secretary of the Miners’ Association,
applied for the ground. Then the co. raised
points about the legality of the cancellation ;
and it succeeded, after expensive proceed-
ings through several courts. If the new
Gazette notice dodges the previous errors
it looks as though all the litigation will have
amounted to nothing beyond the feeding of
the lawyers.

“The Mall” : Teddy Dyason is out to save
Bendigo; incidentally, to help himself, as well
as the old Lansell, Atkinson, Mueller and
Dyason pere interests. Fulfilment depends
on carrying through a huge merging scheme:
2500 acres of the best of Bendigo to be under
one roof instead of under 40 different man-
agements. The favored lines are the Garden
Gully, the Moon and the Hustlers, all good
old stagers on which shafts and poppet heads
are as thick as derricks on an oilfield. Some
of these blocks overlap side-lines like the
Sheepshead and Paddy’s Gully, so a lot of
untouched ground is to be included. It is pro-
bable that Dyason will project a £500,000 co.
in shares of ss. each ; 1,000,000 to go to those
holding interests in the present shows. The
rest will represent working capital (probablv
£75,000 or £100,000), underwriting papei 1 ,
and other etceteras incidental to such promo-
tions. The merits of the scheme are: (1)
Saving in surface and mining costs, set down
at £75,000 annually; (2) concentration of
effort; (3) control of supplies and utilisa-
tion of electricity in the place of fuel power;
and (4) more scientific management. The
Mines Department is said to be dazzled with
the scheme. If £75,000 to £lOO,OOO annually
can be saved by such a fusion, it means a big
thing for Bendigo. The old field needs a shake
up in mine control and efficiency of manage-
ment just as much as it needs to shed a score
or two of plants and do hauling and crushing
at a few central stations. But Bendigo ought
to make certain the combine intends to fairly
distribute work in the immense holding
before it becomes enthusiastic. Mines-Min-
ister Livingstone has been told that more
men will be given work than are now on the
ground. But that might be taken to mean
the centralising of effort in mines where
quartz can be gutted out, and neglecting
development elsewhere. The shareholders in
the old cos. must also find out where they
come in. Are their shares to be locked up
for six months, or until after the war; or
are they to have the run of the market with
the new contributors? A lot of the men who
may be forced to take paids have met
every call for years, and ought not to have to
play second-fiddle to the new-comers who
otherwise will get the run of the market.

The test-books quote the Vic. brown-coal
deposits as an outstanding example of this
class of fuel, but no one has yet made any
use of them. Now a flood of talk is eddying
around them, and it may wash them into use.
The Victorian committee of the Federal Ad-
visory Council of Science and Industry read
a report or two about them, but decided that
they were too close at hand to worry about.
But the State Government has a little experi-
mental plant at North Fitzroy, where it is
producing gas and proposes to see what it
can get in tiie way of by-products —coal-tar,
dye-materials, etc. State Geologist Herman
and 11. It. Harper, Melbourne’s electrical
engineer, have an idea that Victoria may yet
do better than the Speck’s water-power by
developing electric energy from the brown
coal and distributing it whore it is most
needed. They point out that if the by-pro-
ducts are worked for all they are worth it
may be possible to get the gas for producing
power for next-to-nothing.
* * * *
Sharebroker Fred Bathurst, who used to
be financial editor of the Argus and is now
a member of the New Industries Committee,
has been talking brown coal to his fellow-
members. According to city electrical-
engineer Harper, the present annual
employment of electric power in Melbourne’s
industries is some 30,000 li.p., and the
amount used doubles every five years.
Bathurst’s idea is to start electrical works
at Morwell, where the brown coal can be
taken out of open cuts. There have been
some lofty flights of fancy during the past
couple of decades concerning the possibili-
ties of Victoria’s brown coal deposits, and
much has been talked and written and
hoped and prayed about them, with nothing
done. Still, Bathurst has a hard head with
high-quality contents, and there is some
comfort for the optimists and visionaries
when a man of that stamp tackles the pro-
position.
Melbourne Argus recently spake as fol-
lows :
Away in the wilds of Port Melbourne a South
Australian company is doing its best to put a new
Australian industry on a sound footing. The co.
has installed here a small plant for the production
of motor spirit and other oil products from the
crude oil by a patent process, invented by Mr. H. E.
Stocks. Here they are turning to good account the
waste oil from the Vic. railways, left over after
the production of Pintsch gas for railway lighting-
purposes, and they are negotiating for application
of the process to the crude oil from the shale works
at Latrobe, in Tasmania.
Attorney-General Propsting, of Tasmania,
has asked the co. to set forth the terms on
which it is prepared to refine crude oil by its
patent process, the object of the co. being to
induce the Tasmanian Government to pur-
chase the shale property at Latrobe with a
view to supplying the Stocks Motor Spirit
works with unlimited millions, of crude oil
for conversion into fuel oil. But presumably
Propsting will want more than a mere offer
to do the work before he allows it to influ-
ence him in regard to the purchase of any
shale property.
Beaconsfield (Tas.), which since the Tas-
mania Gold Mine closed down has been look-
ing as cheerful as a Belgian township under
the Hun, may get a lift soon. It needs to
be soon, too, as the town is being sold in
pieces and carted away to orchard blocks.
Some English people are making inquiries
about the Ilfracombe iron deposits—they
talk of smelting by electricity if they can
come to terms with the Government for
power. Other English people are inquiring
about the asbestos deposits. The Launceston
Marine Board, which has power under an
Act to manufacture cement and carbide,
has agreed to get an expert to advise as to
the suitability of the Winldeigh limestone
for cement-making, also generally as to the
advisableness of establishing works. The old
Tasmania mine tram runs from Beauty
Point, a first-class deepwater port, to within
a mile and a half of the deposits.
* * * *
The half-yearly report of Lyell Blocks
(Tas.) makes it clear that the boring done at
1200 ft. has only revealed the poverty of that
end of the mine. Sticht’s staff always held
that the south lens in the North Lyell had
cut out just on the boundary. The drill estab-
lishes that odious fact for the Blocks. Then
the patches cut by the Blocks at 1300 ft. are
small affairs: 18ft. of stuff went. 3.7 p.c.
copper, 440 z. silver and 14dwt. gold, and
another 24ft. ranged up to 10 p.c. copper
and 230 z. silver. This would have been all
right if there had been enough ore to go
round, but so far drilling shows it won’t fill
a respectable-sized smelter bin. though a rise
further up may add to the quantity. The
position is that if the co. is to have a mine
it will have to prove that the shoot pierced
in the North Lyell from its 1100 ft. level
climbs over the Blocks boundary. The easiest
way to decide that would be to bore up from
the 1300 ft. level. The co. has a second string
in the 700 ft. of untested ground lying north
of the end of the 1300 ft. drive. It will cost
a good deal to carry out the boring Carroll
wants done to prove this block; but as it
has taken £50,000 to get to the present stage
the towel won’t be thrown in until the drill
has had a go there.
* * * *
Wallaroo and Moonta don’t issue accounts
at the half-year, but give merely a state-
ment of assets and liabilities. From this,
however, we can tell what the six months
have meant: —
Dee., 1915. June, 1916.
Liquid assets . . £320,648 £383,017
Liabilities . . 39,756 37,671
Surplus .. £280,892 £345,346
That is an increase* of £04,454 in the six
months; and meantime two dividends of ss.
each, equal in all to £BO,OOO, have been paid.
Assuming, as we fairly may, that the co.
has spent at least as much on development,
repairs, etc., as depreciation lias called for,
then, subject to a subsequent remark, the
profit for the half-year was £144,454 on a
capital of £320,000 —an astonishing per-
formance for a 00-year-old. The point upon
which it would be well to have further in-
formation is as to taxes paid. If no pay-
ments have been made during the half-year,
the actual profit may be easily cut down by
£30,000 or £40,000; for there is nothing
surer than that war profits are going to be
heavily taxed, and these are war profits all
right. The average price of standard cop-
per for the six months was £lll 14s. 7d. as
compared with £7l Is. 2d. for the same
period of 1915. The mines’ own output of
copper was 3552 tons; and £4O per ton on
that lot is £142,080. So almost all the pro-
fit seems to have been due to the higher
price of copper.
Though director Duff was to financially
prop the Edna Deeps (W.A.) till crushing
from the Edna shoot at 480 ft. filled the till
with profits, the Board has been hanging
round Treasurer Higgs for consent to
dispose of 10,000 reserve shares at 30s. each.
It was not known that this financial grope
was on, and someone got going in the market
early, causing a nasty crack which was only
mended by the lucky bore into the reef at
500 ft. If that hadn’t arrived and the
manager had had to tell only of the dyke
showing up in the drive north at 480 ft.,
some of the punters would have had knee
trembles badly even with the 3oz. assays
thrown in. The little stranger faded out of
sight on Friday morning, so it looks as if
Stuckey will have no fresh surprises till he
reaches the Central boundary or drops on to
the reef at 500 ft.
* * * *
Associated Gold Mines (W.A.) made a net
profit of £7276 for the year to March 31,
which was £5316 better than for the previous
term. No estimate of ore reserves is given,
but the broken ore lying in the stopes is com-
puted at 21,680 tons, assaying 20s. per ton,
against the previous year’s 32,479 tons valued
at 19s. 7d. The manager remarks cheerfully
that prospects are no worse than they were
12 months ago. The North Thompson, the
Canadian show in which the co. holds a con-
trolling interest, is stated to be showing “an
appreciable improvement” in depth. At 400 ft.
so far 250 ft. of payable stone has been
opened up. Sinking to 500 ft. is now in pro-
gress, and by next year the show expects to
reach the producing stage.
* * * *
Nullagine Sluicing Co. (W.A.) hopes to
make a start early next month, but the first
clean-up or two will come from the poorest
parts. A shilling a yard is expected to cover
all costs, and an average yield of 2s. 6d. is
looked for from between 20,000 and 30,000
yards a month.

Yuanmi has abandoned its Warriedar
option, and the slump which has followed is
one of the worst ever experienced in the
West. On the strength of the show being
acquired, and the promise of a State battery,
large buildings were erected, but the town
has now been practically deserted. Corinth,
on the Yilgarn field, is in a similar plight
owing to the stoppage of the Corinthian
North. A month ago 100 men were employed
and a thriving township existed, but every-
thing is now as silent as a dead politician.
* * * *
African Exploration Co. has paid £lOOO
cash and 3000 shares for the Auckland mine,
10 miles north of Leonora (W.A.). The lode
is claimed to be of “large dimensions,” and
600 tons treated by the Vendors gave a return
of approximately £4 per ton. No develop-
ment to speak of, however, has been done at
depth.
* * * *
Away beyond Peak Hill (W.A.) and 100
miles or more from anywhere else is a
copper field from which big things are ex-
pected some day. From one lease pegged
two or three years ago 122 tons of ore have
been raised and smelted at Fremantle for a
return of £4300. Of this nearly £lOOO was
paid for cartage to Meekatharra, £l5O for
freight to the seaboard, and £5OO for smelt-
ing. There are said to be miles upon miles
of country with copper showing almost
everywhere.

Inclusive of developmental outlay, Gt.
Fingall’s expenditure in 1915 was £9136
ahead of receipts. Cash having been ex-
hausted before the end of the year, arrange-
ments were made with the State Govern-
ment for advances up to £15,000 to open up
the No. 19 level, and on December 31 £1344
had been drawn. In consequence of the
small amount of development work done,
the reserves were considerably reduced. Ore
in sight between the Nos. 13 and 18 levels,
exclusive of that to be left in supporting
pillars, was estimated at 31,010 tons, valued
at 355. 4d.
T. H. Martyn, the Sydney man who has
specialised in dredging and picked up the
Itatrut and others for the Malaya Tin Cor-
poration. is in Southern Siberia now.
“Secured,” he wires, “30 square miles vein
claims, adjoining big mine. Surface sampling
payable. Now opening out. Also gold and
platinum dredging areas. Apparently rich.
Securing others.” The early reports from
that distant country, on which Martyn was
induced to make the visit, talked of some
astonishing values.
An expert has gone across to King Island
to look over the scheelite lode at the Grassy
River. His opinion will probably decide
whether B. 11. Block 14 will exercise its
option over 40,000 shares in the prospecting
association.
Toluene and benzine are wanted by French
and British for the manufacture of high
explosives, so producers of coal tar are en-
joined to save those products, and the Aus-
tralian Gas Co. (Sydney) is laying dowu a
plant for the purpose. This co. produces
more gas than any other in Australia (3600
million cub. feet a year), but for years it has
neglected by-products and is miles behind
the Metropolitan (Vic.), which in six
months obtained a revenue of £82,004 from
residuals, compared with £45,560 received
by the Sydney co. In the U.S.A., by the
way, some interesting experiments have been
made lately with tar mixed with oil for the
flotation of minerals.

AFRAID TO EAT.
WEALTHY DYSPEPTIC DIES OF
STARVATION.
An inquest was recently held upon a
wealthy man who had died of starvation. He
was a victim of digestive trouble and afraid
to eat because of the pain which always
followed. This tragic proof of the folly of
dieting should serve as a warning to those
of our renders who experience pain and
unpleasantness after eating. It should be
remembered that indigestion, dyspepsia,
heartburn, flatulence and wind are usually
but symptoms of excessive acidity and food
fermentation. The acid retards digestion,
turns the food sour, and causes fermentation
and wind. Obviously, therefore, it is acidity
which is the root cause of practically all
forms of digestive and stomach trouble, and
that is why physicians advise sufferers to
take disunited magnesia after meals. Bisu-
rated magnesia is not a drug or a medicine
but an antacid and food corrective which
can be obtained from high-class chemists
everywhere. Half a teaspoonful taken in a
little water after meals is sufficient to in-
stantly neutralise acidity and prevent all
possibility of the food fermenting, and if
dyspeptics would only adopt this simple
precaution they would soon find drug taking
and dieting unnecessary ; bisurated magnesia
would enable them to eat hearty meals with-
out fear of pain to follow — Advt.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, September IS, 1916.
My Dear Aiuni, —
About 50 soldiers are convalescing in the
Red Cross home at Moree, where the waters
are doing wonders for the rheumatic. Moree
has hitherto been regarded by most people as
a place of sheep and dry weather. Just now,
as it happens, the country is spread with
carpets of emerald green, with not as
many sheep as they would like to
nibble it. “The best season for 20
years,” the Oldest Inhabitant said
through his whiskers to the recent sub-regal
visitors. But the future holds more than
fat sheep. An artesian bore wells up mineral
waters that may yet rival Rotorua baths, and
they are without the smell of bad eggs that
goes with the Maoriland sulphur-dip. The
latest prophet to acclaim them is the veteran
Dr. Charles Mackellar. He was very near
the Border a few months ago. When the
Strickland party sighted him the other day
they wanted to know who the sprightly
Rejuvenation might be. It is a new, 2U-
years-younger Mackellar, and he made a fiery
speech on behalf of the Leg. Council at a
banquet that night.
At Inverell the touring Stricklands had a
look at the waterworks-to-be. His Ex.
turned the first sod. In three years some-
body else will turn the first tap. After doing
something harmless to a weir, laying a foun-
dation-stone, etc., the party changed its pina-
fores for the banquet at night. The country
gallantly welcomes ladies at these spreads,
and his Ex.’s young daughters ate their first
official meal in public, while J. T. Dale
spoke of the virtues of King Solomon, and
Inverell’s little P.M. Brown replied in
feeling terms. Lady Edeline didn’t face the
Inverell-Moree trip, but she’s likely to try
the Mackellar cure later on.
Archbishop Cerretti opened this year’s fete
in the garden of Waitara Foundling Home.
The babes’ hon. medical adviser and friend
and playmate, Dr. Sydney Watkins, replied
on their behalf.
Heard at the lately-deceased Women’s Ex-
hibition. Lady, with lorgnette, gazing
haughtilv at a big caucus of bees: “How
disgusting ! Fancy exhibiting blowflies !”
The Kindergarten Union had its annual
wash-up at Government House. The
Strickland lady presided behind an elegant
spindle-shanked table. General-secretary
Ellen Desailly and the slender training-col-
lege school-marm Miss Dumolo gave a brief
summary of events; John Mackay, president
of the Union, flung a posy at the hon.
workers; and Mrs. Frank Davenport de-
scribed the humble origin of a movement
which now runs nine flourishing academies.
Meredith Atkinson, the ’Varsity man who
sorts out economics, gave a rosy estimate
of the good citizens you can make out of
unpromising raw material if you catch it in
the knickerbocker stage. The large Boorman,
a UiS.A. citizen who helps the Kindergarten
dames from January to December, rose like
a mountain to heave with gratitude for
subscriptions past, present and to come.
The Melba scholarship for singing amounts
to 75 guineas per annum. It gives the
winner two years to train her trills at the
Melbourne Conservatorium. Besides that the
songster gets lectures in English diction,
Italian, deportment and goodness knows
what. Entries in N. S. Wales close on Sep-
tember 25. Send in a claim to Anderson’s
Music Warehouse, 194 Pitt-street.
The ’Varsity had a midsummer day for
its party for the War Chest and plum-rpud-
ding fund. Undergrads of both sexes
strolled round with dainty young things in
gossamer muslins and consumed buckets of
icecreams for the cause. Professor
MacCallum, Mrs. Jamie Wilson and Regis-
trar Barff and his lady were First Aids to
attend to any Personages who might drop in.
Gems of wit were chalked on the melting
asphalt paths, and by these tokens we
knew that the brains of the undergrads,
were still at work. The fete did a brisk
business till ‘closing time. Lured by the
engaging invitation to “go where you like,”
exploring parties set forth to see the ’Var-
sity sights. But they were mostly caged, or
covered from germs under navy hankies.
There’s a good-bye party at Government
House this Friday. The Voluntary Aids
from N. S. Wales who leave for London in
the Osterley are the heroines.
Sheila Chisholm (now Loughborough), the
Sydney girl with big black velvet eyes in a
creamy white oval face, is now settled in
London, and smiles at our convalescent
soldiers in stiff military hospitals.
The Gonsalez Co. dresses “Faust” differ-
ently. Marguerite (Miss Visoni) is a small,
stiff maiden in a prim white dress with
skyblue relief. Her wig is too wiggish to be
becoming. Its hard, tow-colored locks coine
to a dull ending in a couple of plaits with
infantine blue bows. The lads of the village,
in silk tights with blue-satin jumpers, high-
kick around a capable lady peasant, the
Genee of the hamlet. The male principals
have a better notion of clothes than the
ladybirds. Cappelli (Faust), in mulberry
velvet doublet glittering with glorified sequin
embroidery and tights of the same hue, is
the idol of the gallery. When he added
ostrich and an abbreviated white
toga to his other splendor, a, chocolate box
fell with a crash. Heavens! What a Romeo!
Wide flat hats with very low brims are in.
At the first night of “Faust.” the audience
was distracted between the arrival of
Mephisto on the stage and the advent of a
hatted lady in a box. Later on, perhaps to
please her friends, the boxed visitor removed
her millinery. It was the kind of immense
pancake leaf you see in ’Murkan pictures of
the summer girl. It caused a stir in. stalled
society, because we’re promised the shady
thing in race-week. Conductor Gonsalez, by
the way, was late—he missed something or
other that would have landed him to time.
As “Faust” was advertised to start at 7.30
pan., first-nighters had been obliged to make
the supreme sacrifice of bolting from their
dinner, and they looked haughtily down
their noses during the long wait.
All sorts of Strollers have been born into
this war-scarred universe. Now we have
“The Thomas Strollers” from the old King’s
School. You’d never believe that conserva-
tive academy would rig itself out in fancy
duds and grease-paint. But here you are!
The leading amateur mummer is one Thomas,
a master who is the idol of the small fry in
the old school. Their show, “New Quips,”
comes off in the Repertorv Theatre (Sydney)
on September 30 and October 2. Cash to the
Voluntary Workers’ Association.
Sister A. R. Paton, a Sydney girl, went
up to the Palace to see the King recently,
and just to show he took it as a friendly
thing to do, George Rex pinned on her suit
the Royal Red Cross for services rendered
in France. The newly-decorated sister
passed her “marmalade” days at Prince
Alfred, and it wasn’t so long ago.
Big John G. Sheridan, one of the special-
ists on contracts and such-like appalling
things at the Sydney Bar, is somewhere
between here and Vancouver, with London
as his final port, U boats and similar craft
permitting. A Maoriland mining case takes
him thither.
Staff-nurse Cecile Deakin (W.A. born and
Sydney bred), of the Fremantle Military
Hospital, acquired the right last week, in
Perth, to put “Mrs. Hugh Hall” on her call-
ing cards. The groom in the case owns
many acres round the pearling-port of
Broome, and has only recently cast off khaki
as a result of damage received on the Anzac
shore. The Deakins mostly inhabit Sydney,
and brother Geoff, of Cremorne, put in a
lot of time as a captain of the A.M.C. on
Gallipoli and thereabouts.
Here is a typical
Australian girl and
good all round sport
—shoots breakers
like a dolphin,
plays a rattling
game of tennis,
and before the war
danced the soles off
her satin slippers
without knowing
the tired feeling.
She is Adele, one
of two tall, gord-
looking sisters who
call solicitor W. F.
Brennan dad.
When the war
came they threw
peace-time frivols
aside, and trained
as voluntary aides. They served their time in
the hospitals, and then lent a hand at the
char-work that keeps Rose Hall —the con-
valescent soldiers’ home—like a new pin.
Now Adele goes to England with the Red
Cross detachment for service abroad. Cold
English nurses will melt when this laughing,
sunny Australian girl tackles the hardest
chores they give her as easily as she’d hit
a hockey ball out of bounds. There’s a big
brother Billy at the Front, by the way, and
another in training.
There is mingled sorrow and gladness this
week because large and genial Keith Bain is
leaving his country to serve it. Bain, of the
special-request voice, does his daily job at
Dalgety’s, and a deal of amateur charity-
show singing in between.
The annual meeting of subscribers to the
Home for Incurables at Ryde developed into
a concert. Governor Strickland took the
best chair, and got through the preliminary
business before rushing off to hear Lionel
Curtis tell how a greater Empire may be
carpentered. The accounts having been
chased to the uttermost farthing, the organ,
with Lilian Frost in charge, again made
melody. Mabel Batchelor, Sid Macdonald,
Charlie Philip and Lottie Ilyam fat the
piano) kept the encore fiends busy.
Sympathy encircles our gentle Rose Scott,
who dreams of peace societies while Europe
blazes. She was a sister of Stipendiary
Magistrate Scott, who died the other (lay.
The Scott family—present generation-mail
from the Hunter River. Years ago Helen us
Scott, the father, who arrived here in 181.1,
was Police Magistrate at Newcastle. lie
married a daughter of Canon Ilusden, the
Australian historian whose work is recog-
nised as standard stuff. Helenus Scott was
a friend of Leichhardt, and his father was a
pal of botanist Sir Joseph Banks.
Amongst our
younger artists
James It. Jackson is
steadily leaving the
ruck behind. As a
colorist his chief suc-
cess lies in brush
work that reflects
the exquisite blue
and gold of an Aus-
tralian summer day.
The National Gal-
lery has recently
bought two such
samples. Hung in a
British gallery they
would incite • desir-
able immigrants to
book their passage to
this holiday land.
Born in Maoriland
about 30 years ago, Jackson became an
Australian citizen at the age of eight. When
he was 16 the late Frank Mahony saw his
efforts to draw, became interested, and was
the boy’s teacher in the old Art Society’s
eyrie. By day Jackson painted patent pill
signs on the hoardings. At night he worked
hard to learn the artists’ craft.
Having saved enough—or nearly enough—
Jackson went to London. ‘‘l started in
Brangwyn’s school of art, and had been there
for a week or so when a happy-looking chap
wandered into the studio. It was Brang-
wyn. My first lesson was short. ‘Not so
hot,’ said the great man, referring to the
colors. The second was rather longer. ‘Not
so d — hot!’ Next time, as he still couldn’t
stand my vivid Australian color, lie asked
me where I’d come from. ‘Oh, the
other side,’ said I, and mentioned a fine
thing of his, ‘The Scoffers,’ in our gallery.
‘What, are you from the (adjective) rim of
the earth !’ Taking the brushes out of my
hand he put some of the cold North into it in
two minutes.
“After gathering the pearls of instruction
that Brangwyn threw before me, I went to
Paris. Students’ life there loses the drab
tone of London studios, and the Latin Quar-
ter is a revelation. After 12 months my
money was almost finished. Against the
wish of my teacher, Rennard, I had to make
a beeline back, and landed in Sydney
with all my worldly fortune, five shillings,
in my pocket. But I was home, and the
sun was shining. Nothing else mattered!”
The Queen Victoria Club is sampling
“Damaged Goods,” by way of an exclusive
reading circle on Friday afternoon. The rush
to get in will be checked by a peri at the
portal with: “Have you got a ticket They
ought to put a big price on the entrance
cardboard. AVar funds are so hungry.
Artist Perrett, of Auckland, is over here
for a few months. He is the man who turns
out so many pictures of Maoriland’s hot-lake
area.
Coming over to Sydney this week-end the
fast-greying Hughes had an addition to his
bodyguard, led always by the faithful M. L.
Shepherd. Adam McGay, most facile of
journalists, is the Prime Minister’s literary
aide-de-camp for the strenuous Conscription
campaign; and he raced over from Mel-
bourne to send the opening manifesto on its
way.
Some of Maoriland’s best sporting set are
at the Australia. C. S. Studholme, from
AVaimate, is over on a fleeting visit. He
brought several racing horses and lately gave
them their local push-off. Wilfred Stead and
his missus, who was one of the renowned
Roberts clan, of Dunedin, is also visible in
town between races. Stead is a son of
M.L.’s great Gee-Gee Stead, who raced with
profit and good horses, and declared for the
totalisator until he died.
There’s a little village called Timaru in
Maoriland. It is chiefly remarkable for the
size of the waves that beat on its stormy
shore and the height of its musical ambition.
When Vera Cree. of Sydney, captured the
Royal College of Music scholarship, Timaru
contributed the winner of a similar event
for the piano. She is Madeline M. O.
Hooker.
At the symphony concert on Saturday
afternoon Slap, shook the ghost of a baton
over the big Russian symphony—the strong
meat of the menu —and Reginald Gooud sang
“Honor and Arms,” through the end ot a
cold. Winifred Carter’s harp was dumb m
the “Irish Rhapsody” through the lady s
sudden illness. Yet even with that heavy
handicap it was the best orchestral perform-
ance of a mediocre concert.
Y’erbrugghen has been resting after the Hu
in a sanatorium where nuts and m.lk and
other light diet conduce to high thinking.
He’s so much better that lie 11 be able to
stroke his precious fiddle in a day or two.
About the last composition blue-eyed
Max Vogrich gave the world was a concerto
written for Russian fiddler Mrscha Eiman.
Vogrich had lived out of Ins native Hind-
most of his life, and married an Australian,
Alice Rees. Elman played his friend s
music in Chicago about five months ago.
And the city of canned meat guessed it
sounded real good.
The industrious Queensland verse-lady,
Mrs. M. Forrest, is here on a visit. This
time she brings a daughter to have a look
at our wilting gardens, from which hoses and
sprinklers are banished.
Mrs. Sid Christian, who has followed her
R.A.G.A. Colonel round the globe, is now in
London. He is busy in France —Brigadier-
General of a Field Artillery division these
times.
The Art Society had a mixed evening enter-
tainment last week —music, claret cup and
cream puffs. This week members have an
Italian night—then back to the easels.
Have you noticed that the floppy cape is
again struggling to the fore? Most of the
race frocks will show a cape of some kind.
Even if it’s no larger than a half-moon it
must be there.
Dora Alexander, the tall Albury girl who
has leanings towards musical comedy, has
given Leslie Walford, one of Sydney’s dapper
bachelors —eh, what? —the right answer. The
Alexander family palpitates with music. A
brother, Norman, now in England getting
over his damages at the Front, could thump
harmony out of the most wheezy hospital
piano. With Dorothy Gordon on the way
to U.S.A. to pose for movies, and tuneful
Dora Alexander turning her thoughts to
matrimony, the amateur vaudeville eo. which
delights our Percies has been sadly stricken
of its stars.
Wonder if suffragist Annie Kenney, who
is to hand to Prime Minister Hughes the
Englishwomen’s petition praying him to fly
back to London, could be persuaded to be
an orator for some patriotic show while she’s
in Sydney? Some of our Women’s Clubs
might get her to tell them all about it. She’s
a fine speaker with no end of “experiences.”
The flounce appears to be dwindling to the
2in. variety that first broke into rebellion
against the tube skirt. It works out in sec-
tions. Three or four of these tiny flounce-
lets, then a space of gathered skirt, then
another outbreak. On the first cotton frocks
of spring it’s a meek mid-Victorian appari-
tion.
Parson Charlton, of Killara, puts a plain
gold ring on Miss Phippard’s finger this
week. They both belong to the north side
of the Harbor. He is a member of a well-
known cricketing family, but depends on
good works and afternoon tea for his own
relaxation.
Y 7 era Cree’s concert conics off on October
12. It’s a farewell to speed her on the long
hard track to fame as a singer. She leaves
Sydney for the Royal College of Music early
in 1917.
The United Charities urge you to note
that October 14 is their day out. Three
thousand lady pirates are already pledged to
support this effort. More buttons, of course.
A silver coin buys a souvenir of the same
metal. For half a sovereign you get the
golden article. There’s to be a carnival in
the Show Ground in the afternoon. Arthur
Upjohn, IG3 Pitt-street, will take the names
and addresses of volunteers for the collection.
Yours affectionately. Vanoobian.

LL the world recognises
the PIANOLA as the
greatest of Player Pianos.
THE popularity of the Pianola is more than local —more than
national. It is international and world-wide. Even in these war
times the Pianola is being sold in Madrid, London, Paris,
Petrograd, in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia —in every great centre of
the Eastern hemisphere. In Canada, in our own great cities and
throughout the Americas, it is, as a matter of course, the supreme
instrument of its type.
The wonderful inventive genius that brought the Pianola first to
perfection and has maintained it ever in the lead, has manifested itself
in many such remarkable and basic devices as the Metrostyle and the
Themodist. Yet these two revolutionary expression devices are alone
sufficient to banish to the realms of the unfinished—the incomplete—
every other player instrument the world markets know.
Do not let your judgment of the Pianola be influenced by other
players you have seen.
You must hear and play the Pianola to realise what a wonderful
and artistic instrument it has become —what broad, almost unlimited,
powers of musical expression it provides. We invite you to come in for
a demonstration at any convenient time.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, September 18, 1916.
Mr Dear Yarrie, —
The G.-G. and Lady Helen are advertis-
ing another party. Go in by the State
Entrance on Wednesday, September 27, and
you will find music and coffee.
Sassiety has once more decided to unfurl
its table napkin and eat for the soldiers —
at Menzies’ on Thursday evening. The
sacrifice is called a Grand Patriotic Dinner
and Continental Evening. Continentals, you
know, are gay things at which laughter isn’t
considered disgraceful. The Madden dame
is president and she promises to be out of
her hospital for the event. The Mayoress,
Mrs. George Fairbairn, Mrs. Willie
Baillieu and Miss Du Freyer are the vice-
presidents. The entire proceeds are for the
Repatriation Fund.
In England the promoters of war funds
are sorely troubled to find new names for
Days. George Doughty’s widow (formerly
“Tryphena” of The Bulletin) has a fund
for supplying parcels of food to poor
Grimsby fishermen who have been captured
at sea by the Huns. Her latest device for
raising more cash was a Periwinkle Day,
when the little blue flower was offered for
sale. Fishermen don’t catch winkles for a
living; nevertheless there was salt-sea sig-
nificance in the emblem.
The Jim Russells opened up the old home-
stead the other afternoon to cash-in on the
patriotic doyleys and pincushions which the
Western District has been preparing for
months. The Russells squat at Barunah
Plains, miles and miles from any but the
most desirable people, so the event was some-
thing quite out of the ordinary. Dave Oman,
M.L.A. of Lismore —never quite so useful
and ornamental as when he is doing some-
thing of the kind—uttered the usual merry
jest at the kick-off, and all the rest was
gabble, gobble, giggles, glad rags and splash-
ing coin. There were swarms of Russells,
raking in cash all over the place, assisted by
an Austin or so, some Kininmonths, one or
two Laseelles, a bunch of Bingleys from
Warrambeen, and a rich assortment of girl
in earlv spring frills, with the moral support
of the "usual curate and enough motor-cars
to endow a fair-sized war-orphanage.
Barrister Casey, the young-old brother of
the late Judge, is about again after a serious
illness. The first-nighters all missed him, for
he haunts the front stalls of the best current
show every Saturday, and has been doing it
regularly since Captain Cook landed.
John Madden’s dame is progressing well
after her recent operation. A good old-
fashioned constitution is a fine asset.
Good-looking Alan Newton, one of Mel-
bourne’s brilliant young surgeons, is in khaki
and leaves shortly for the Front. Dr. Neil
Fairley, the young medicine man whose work
on meningitis is praised by the profession,
has already gone.
Most of the voluntary helpers at the No.
1 Rest Home did their washing in the
laundry in dejected fashion last Monday
and Doris Blackwood refused to smile as
she peeled potatoes in the kitchen. Matron
Davys had sent in her resignation; hence
the gloom. Quite a number of the helpers
threaten to drive their cars in other direc-
tions if the matron won’t relent.
Mrs. Embling (Red Cross president)
wants to show folk what the Prahran branch
has been doing, and to that end is inviting
people to a party at the City Hall of the
shoppers’ Mecca on Saturday. Admission
is by woollen garment or some item of food
suitable for invalided soldiers. Of course
you leave these things at the door —you don t
wear or eat them yourself.
Add one more name to the social casualty
list. The just-arrived Forrest dame says
that Lady Barron has been seriously ill.
She was allowed a little peep at the vice-
regal invalid just before the boat sailed.
The John Forrest dame is here with niece
Muriel North. They followed the family
giant eastward and talked a good deal with
suffragist Annie Kenney, who was found to
be an entertaining young person, dainty and
full of life. She does not look capable of
thrashing a lord ; but if you ask her about
it she’ll smile proudly. Her record will
stand until some fluffy five-footer spanks
a duke with a slipper. Annie is armed with
a special despatch for Billy Hughes and
has gone on to Sydney with it.
Justice a’Beckett has just been congratu-
lated by -his friends on scoring 80 not
out. In replying, the young man said that
he was fit for many runs yet and had no
intention of giving up work. Then he settled
his wig and Bowler Time commenced another
over.
Your Johanna erred the other week in
speaking of li. G. Wilson as being in charge
of a military canteen somewhere. lie was
thus occupied before passing to that bourne
from whence no Wilson returns.
Alice McCulloch, sister of Sam, of Wood-
lands, is going to steer some horses over the
fences at the forthcoming Show. The young
person with the Wellington nose has been
exercising Wait and See over the hurdles
at Flemington in the early morning. One
mount is coal black and the other is snow
white —like a fairy-story pair of steeds.
Another only son, young Lieut. Clifford
St. Pinnock, has been killed in France. A
corporal in the first line to leap the parapet
during the historic charge of the Bth Light
Horse at Gallipoli, St. Pinnock was wounded
in that struggle, but was back on the
Peninsula in time to make one of the die-
hards who kept the bluff working during the
final stages of the evacuation. His promo-
tion came later. St. Pinnock was with the
James Henty firm for some years, but was
tiading under his own office-shingle when
he enlisted. He used to play cricket for
East Melbourne.
That mild-mannered family solicitor,
Sammy Backhouse, has abandoned what was
regarded as an interminable bachelorhood.
Before she was red-taped to Samuel for life
the lady’s name was Jeannie Stewart, she
being a daughter of the Henry Stewarts, long
of Armadale. Backhouse has a mellow old
practice in Melbourne, but also pursues Costs
among the tall whiskers of Gippsland. He
belongs to a family to whom the. perfume of
legal documents is as sweet as prime manger-
hay to a brewery horse.
The office of mayor has an added terror at
Warrnambool. Down there it is the custom
for the local band to serenade the wearer of
the rabbit-skin on the night of his election.
At last a reallv exciting divorce case! She
is very young, and he is absurdly rich, while
the tertium quid is not —er—exactly in
Society. But please don’t misunderstand
me—hubby is- the petitioner! It is due to
happen this month, and the revelations
threaten to be thrilling.
One of the 30 spinsters who are being
sent along as wardswomen to English hos-
pitals (what on earth for not even the
smartest of the committee women can ex-
plain) lately invited her women friends to
take tea and inspect the perfectly lovely
underwear she has gathered together for
the trip. The exhibits included crepe de
chine nightdresses and silk and lace trifles
calculated to make a mere bride go yellow
with envy. It is a very comfortable scheme
altogether. Passage paid, 20 pounds a year
for frillies, an outfit gratis, and board and
lodging thrown in. Official justification is
that it is being done as a compliment to
Australia. But who pays?
Cousin Adelaide’s weekly confession : —•
Captain A. S. Blackburn, of the 10th, has won
the first V.C. for this State in the present war.
Staff-nurse Atkinson, another S. Australian, has won
the Royal Red Cross, and Bombardier C. S. Pizey
the Military Medal after being mentioned four times
in despatches. Time was when Pizey was boy soloist
in St. Peter’s Cathedral choir, and an uncommonly
good soloist, too.
From England comes news of Miss Bessie Tyas,
whose father was once Registrar of the Adelaide Uni-
versity. She has made a name as an operatic singer.
The piano was her first musical love, but while study-
ing at Dresden Conservatorium she was persuaded to
turn to singing. She studied for a time at Vie'nna,
and then went to Paris, where she was under Madame
Nevada. Her debut was made in the title role in
“Lakme” at the London Opera House, and she was
subsequently engaged by Sir Thomas Beechain, for
whom she played several parts at the Shaftesbury.
The City Council has been stirred on the subject
of the insanitary paper money which is in circulation,
and the health committee is to deal with the matter.
It is quite possible that the Commonwealth Treasurer
will be fined ss.
That rare Adelaide war-time dissipation, a dinner-
party, occurred at the Grand Central the other even-
ing, with Frank Tolley as host and Brig.-Gen. and
Mrs. Irving and the headquarters military staff as
guests.
Australia Day is to be audited at the end of the
month; meanwhile Mayor Isaacs prophesies that the
result of the appeal will be well over £85,000. The
Repatriation Fund is the next big scheme that will
demand attention.
The Nomenclature Committee that has been investi-
gating the question of German place-names has handed
to the Premier an interim report, which deals
with about 70 names of enemy origin, and suggests
British or black-brother substitutes. The next business
is to go into the question of duplications, which will
deprive the G.P.O. of one excuse for the late delivery
of letters.
The Arnold Davevs have had news of the death of
their son, a senior flight-lieutenant who was attached
to the Naval Air Service. He left Prince Alfred
College in March of last year, was at the Dardanelles
for a time and got promotion, and was subsequently
transferred to the North Sea —an impressive record
for a boy of 19. His elder brother, who holds a com-
mission in the Artillery, is in France. Other fatali-
ties of the week include Lieut. Ross Law, a Sydney
man who came here about five years ago from the
Hobart Daily Post ; and Lieut. H. E. Moody, eldest
lawyer-son of Clarence, once of the Register and
Mail.
Dear little Addie Pankhurst is here, with the In-
iquity of War as her text, and nobody cares tuppence.
Amongst the South Australians recently killed in
France is Sergeant R. MacKail, who before he en 1 s e
was in the Forest Service of this State. His letters
from the Front showed that he was still interested in
his work, and collecting what information he could
so much so that only a few days before the newsi o
his death came through the Attorney-General had
approved of the Afforestation Department’s suggestion
that an application should be made for his re ease
from further military duty so that he might go o ie
Forest School at Nancy, France, and come back here
in April as Assistant Lecturer in Forestry.
“A Night of Nights” was the effusive label
on the Hyams’ ball, given for patriotic pui-
poses and crowded to the doors of bt. Nilaa
Town Hall by the young of both sexes, borne
grown-ups looked on approvingly. -*- ne
Mayor of St. Kilda in bachelor state was
there; Mrs. Murray Morton, with paddy-
green on her black evening dress; Mis.
Bleasby in black ; and Mrs. Abrahams act-
ing as matron-in-chief. There was the usual
parade (mostly fancy-dress), and two small
youngsters shrilled the Anthem to a band
accompaniment. The ceiling was brought
low in an Ida Rentoul spider-web design.
Programmes were sold for sixpence, and tiie
supper cost the Cause nothing—Mrs. McCub-
bin provided it by lending her house tor a
card-party one evening a week before.
Mrs. Geoffrey and Mrs. Oswald Syme gave
a big party at The Playhouse Club on Fri-
day afternoon. The guests browsed on alter-
noon-tea in the lounge, and a special Pro-
gramme of music was turned on in the
theatre itself—an orchestra sawed off lengths
of Puccini, and tenor Goldspink and Elsie
Treweek carolled. Mrs. Oswald wore lawn
color and blue, and Mrs. Geoff smiled her
welcome in the doorway from under a big-
leaf black hat tied under her chignon with
black velvet ribands. Baby Jane, with
cherries in her hat, battered the guests with
programmes. The child was so small and
the crinoline fashionables so hard to reach
that the mite had to make sparrowffeaps at
their elbows.
Italian Consul Eles was there speaking in
honey tones to the silver-haired Knibbs.
Bigjohn Forrest’s wife, in black cloth, had
an amazing feather bonnet, and I think she
intends to use it to fly back to Westralia,
where there is work to do in connection with
the great Yes-Nein campaign. Mrs. Carty
Salmon, in mouse color and a cute blue lid,
answered numerous friendly inquiries about
her colonel-husband’s health. He is back at
work examining recruits, after a troublesome
operation on his hand. Mrs. Carlyle Smytlie
also had cheerful reports about her sick hus-
band, now convalescent. Mrs. Herbert Syme
wore expensive sables and an air of great
dignity, whilst Mrs. Richardson drooped in
shoulder capes of lilac chiffon with fur edges
and a spread of lilac skirts. Mrs. Dyer
(Louise Smith) wore black with a pale face
in which her blue eyes looked as big as
saucers. She is just back from a health-trip
to Samoa after a serious illness. (This reads
like a convalescent home report!) Beatrice
Yaldwyn, large and magnificent, showed the
tip of her well-modelled nose between a high
fur collar and a bashed belltopper hat. Mrs.
Mclnerney emphasised the fairness of her
hair by wearing severe navy-blue silk over a
plaidie skirt. The guests of the day were the
Peg o’ My Hearties. A special invitation
was sent to Dog Michael, and that red-haired
Sinu-Feiner on four legs came tucked under
the arm of Sara Allgood—exactly as on the
stage. She, of course, wore a little petunia
bonnet with a wreath of green leaves to top
her grey suitings.
The Playhouse on Saturday lit a new
sign on the blue of Heaven. “The Play-
house” now glows in wicked scarlet elec-
trics of monstrous size above the sleepy old
Yarra which doesn’t know that Gregan
McMahon is doing “Hedda Gabler” this
week and “Quinneys” the next.
When Nance O’Neil, as Hedda, turned
her magnificent back to the theatre and
shook her shoulders, physical culturists
and dress experts used to throw up then-
hands and say “Marvellous! Wonderful!”
But when thin and clever Eily Malyon fol-
lowed the tradition on Saturday, the fana-
tical Nance O’Neilians only groaned at her
frock. Nance used to appear in the first
scene in the simplest little print gown and
with her hair coiled in a neat braid round
her head. Eily wore a fashion-plate neglige
made of frills of chiffon on a satin petticoat.
Over this were billowing nanniers of bilious
yellow and a long yellow fishtail, trailing
ludicrously two yards b yond the ankle-
length skirts. But she got a good effect out
of her second dress, with a blue fichu and
big bide muslin roses on the skirt. It was
the dress used in the all-night wait for the
erring husband and the Bacchanal lover.
Mrs. Elvsted (pretty Lilian Prichard), who
sat up with her, was still in pale-pink even-
ing dress when the dawn arrived. The
result was ghastly. Pale pink may be a
bedroom color in the best-regulated “Hints
for the Boudoir,” but it does not stand a
mixing of lights.
The house was well filled in the stalls
but thin in the circle and depopulated in
the gilt lattice boxes. Professor Osborne
helped to man the stalls. Mrs. Grebxn, w >
is educating Melbourne in Russian litera-
ture and music, sat in front stalls with her
husband, who wears his hair in a magnin-
cent Niagara swept back to show all his
brow. He looks intellectual and deserves
to. Italian Consul Eles was also in 'front.
R. R. Garran, the new Solicitor-General,
was there with Mrs. Garran, and Melba s
daughter-in-law appeared in black with Mrs.
John Sanderson in golden yellow. ihe
G.-G. is expected to fill a latticed box one
night this week and the social battle-fleet
is holding off for the engagement.
Mabel Muntz, an Australian girl who
plays the piano very nicely, is doing her
best to make her countrymen better
acquainted with Russian music. She _is
working with Mrs. Grebin, the Russian
lecturess, and helps her by creating an
appropriate atmosphere with selections from
Olensky, Rubinstein and other Russian com-
posers. The pair dart into the country
e\ ery week or so, and early next month
will hit Geelong’s intellect with their favor-
ite culture. Miss Muntz, a product of the
Melbourne Uni. Conservatorium, is a niece
of painter Mrs. Muntz-Adams.
The amiable and business-like Jo Smith
continues to produce his gift-play at divers
places for the benefit of various war funds.
Thus far the performances of “Before the
Dawn” have produced more than itiOO for
the Cause, whilst generous Jo has been pay-
ing a lot of exes, out of his own pocket. On
October 4 the comedy-drama will be staged
at The Playhouse under vice-regal auspices,
the takings going to buy Christmas boxes
for the boys of the Bth Brigade in the
trenches. Brigadier-General Tivey is in
command of the Bth aforesaid, and Mrs.
Tivey and other ladies of the Comforts 1 und
will do all the ushering and sweet-selling at
the show. Mrs. Tom Lorimer is hon. sec..
and the Strolling Players’ Orchestra has
engaged itself for the necessary musical
duties. Three-shilling seats are bookable at
Glen’s.
The Melba-Fritz Hart Conservatorium
had its students’ concert last week in the
new Assembly Hall, which sits reverently
alongside Scots’ Church and is so lined
and upholstered in the manner of a kirk
that the listeners felt religious the moment
they got inside. The students who sang
the numerous soli and choruses of “Stabat
Mater” were all Melba’s pupils, and mostly
very pretty girls with fresh young voices;
but they exhibited themselves and their
voices in the mechanical way of a _ churn
at a dairy show. Fritz Hart had his hair
cropped close for the occasion, and the
girls turned their eyes like motor lamps on
their conductor and kept them there ador-
ingly. They seemed to dote on his hair-cut.
George Tutton, the tenor of aesthetic
appearance, is beaming and humming to
himself. Son Norman, just 20 years young,
has done plucky things in France and will
have a D.S.O. to bring home.
The Vic. Artists’ Society has issued cards-
for a water-color and black-and-white exhi-
bition. It will be opened next Monday
(25th) at the V.A.S. galleries on Eastern
Hill, with the idea, apparently, of catching
some of the crowd that comes to town for
the Agricultural Show. It will stay open
for a fortnight, Sundays included. The
Society always remembers the Sabbath Day
to keep it in touch with Art.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Constipation
by taking
Of all Chemists, 1/3

One of the many good effects of Angier’s
Emulsion is its soothing, lubricating effect
in the intestines, by which it promotes
normal healthy functional activity, thus
making the use of pills and purgatives
unnecessary. Angier’s Emulsion does
much more than this. It allays irritation,
inflammation, catarrh, ulceration. It
restores tone to all the functions of the
digestive organs. Angier’s Emulsion has
proved its value in constipation and in many
obscure digestive and bowel disorders.

ANLITIES
“Billy T.”: Crane was emphasising the dis-
advantages of living in a terrace. On this occasion,
Crane admits, it is just possible he was not entirely
free of the after-effects of miscellaneous toasts. He
had been attending a meeting of artists, called to
consider ways and means of elevating art in Australia,
and those present had taken the short cut. Crane
tells me, on his word of honor, he had no doubt about
the house he chose being his house. He sleeps out,
his bed being on the front verandah, behind the
passion-vine and over the gasbox. He did not think
it necessary to undress; he was too fatigued, any-
how. He just threw himself on the bed. Then out
of the confusion came a message with the vividness
of a fall of bricks. It was in a female voice, and it
said: ‘‘James, James, what is the matter with you?
Why don’t you get into bed?” “Then,” Crane says,
“I left. I knew instinctively that I had struck the
wrong house. My name is not James.”
* * * *
“Two Seas”: “Pick” (B. 24/8/T6) can
be supplied with any number of instances of
orchardists camping sheep among trees to eradicate
codlin moth. The remedy is too drastic, as, unless
the trees are protected, the sheep eradicate them
as well as the moth. And when the stock-inspector
comes along and notices “the yolk from the wool
rubbed into the bark” he prosecutes the owner for
not keeping his jumbucks reasonably free from
lice. The only reliable remedy for the apple nark
is to season his tucker with arsenate of lead.
* * * *
“Wandi”: Binghi used to go to his last
resting place in a variety of ways. In the Quean-
beyan district (N.S.W.) the legs of the corpse were
doubled up, the sinews being severed to facilitate
the doubling, and lashed tightly to the body with
bark cord. The corpse was then comfortably seated
in a drive in the bottom of the grave, and some
native bread, yams, and a roast ’possum, together
with the departed’s weapons were placed within
reach. The mouth of the drive was then blocked
with bark, and the grave filled in. Near Mount Lind-
say I saw the defunct sat upright on a sheet of
bark in a fairly-deep hole, with merely another sheet
of bark as shelter. No provisions were supplied to
help him on his way to the Happy Hunting Grounds,
nor any weapons to use when he got there. In parts
of Queensland the graves were covered with great
stacks of wood; and in other parts a stage was built
high up in the forks of trees, upon which the dead
reposed. The Binbinga tribe (N.T.) dismembered
the corpse, and shoved it into a lalanga, or log coffin.
“Inver G.”: Can any Aboriginator
guarantee anything to discourage moths and silver-
fish? Mothballs and naphthaline, in my experience,
are their favorite diet, and all other alleged eradi-
cators that I have tried are just about as effective.
A piano-tuner told me once that pepper did the
trick, so when my piano was put into dry dock for
six months I poured pepper into it till the upper
register began to sneeze. When I was able to
redeem the instrument it appeared to be suffering
from auto-liarmonism or something of the sort.
Inside there were 9,765,000 live moths, 27,000,000
dead ones and 42 battalions of silver-fish. Some
plate that had been in quod along with the piano
included a pepper-pot, and inside that, thoroughly
enjoying itself in the pepper, was a large, vigorous,
robust moth!
* * * *
“Hay”: When Binghi of Centralia wanted
to make a fire he selected a very dry, sun-cracked
piece of wood and placed some fine dry grass in the
cracks. Then with a hard dry splinter with a saw-
like edge he sawed across the cracked log, smartly
pushing the wooden saw with both hands till the
friction produced heat enough to start the grass
smouldering. Then it was easy to kindle some twigs.
The southern coastal tribes used the bulrush or
“yacca” stick, one rush being held between the feet
while a pointed one inserted in the pith was twirled
rapidly between the hands till the pith was ignited.
This was a slower way than the hardwood friction
method. Binghi was never without a fire or
“koonika” to more or less cook his meat and to
keep evil spirits away at night. Another method
was to carry about a stick of burning sandalwood.
When Binghi first became acquainted with matches
no gift gave him more pleasure than a box of them.
“St. Jimmy”: Mt. Cannibal, near Gar-
field (Vic.), is resplendent with masses of heather
blooming upon its flanks. Some years ago there was
a nursery on the mount. After it had been abandoned
a bush-fire swept through, with the result that hun-
dreds of heather plants sprang up, the fire giving
the hard seeds their chance to burst and germinate.
Since then the heather has spread, the soil and
climate evidently being congenial. Perhaps it will
multiply and possess the earth to such an extent that
some shire council will one day proclaim it a thistle
within the meaning of the Act, as has already been
the fate of the “bonnie briar bush.” As the heather
blooms keep for a twelvemonth after gathering, they
are gladly commandeered by the occasional visitors to
the locality. By-the-b.ve, the name of the elevation
is no reflection on the aforetime aboriginal dwellers
thereabouts. When surveyors first appeared in the
vicinity they left a fox-terrier tied in camp while
they theodolited in the bush. On returning for lunch
they found that a dingo had demolished their pet;
so Mt. Cannibal went on the map.
* * * *
“Bag” : The W.A. goldfields haven’t many
native animals per square mile, and such as there are
have a strenuous time searching for tucker, but the
gohannas thrive. These formidable-looking lizards
often measure eight feet long, can beat any dog I’ve
ever seen after them in a hundred yards’ sprint, and
will scrap fiercely as an old ’gator if cornered.
They’re good tucker either fried or roasted on the
coals, and the liver fat when rendered into oil (by
sun heat) is an A 1 lubricant for either guns or
rheumatic joints. Unlike most animal oils, it will
keep sweet indefinitely.
TRUE TO LIFE.
MAC: “An' what d'ye think of me photo-
graph, Sandy?"
SANDY: “Mon, 'tis fine. 'Tis just like ye.
An' whit micht the like o' they cost?"
MAC: “I dinna ken, mon. I hinna peyd yet.”
SANDY ( firmly): “ 'Tis awfu' like ye!”
“Nick Bottom”: When other remedies for
mange in horses fail try this. Mix equal parts of
axle-grease and mutton fat (axle grease by itself is
too severe) and apply to the affected parts. I won’t
stake my professional reputation on the result; but
I will say that it cured my old skewbald when all
other nostrums had passed.
NOT TO BLAME.
MRS. COCKY: “It’ll be our silver weddin ’ next week, John. Will we kill the pig?”
JOHN: “Wots the good o’ murderin’ the pig for wot took place twenty-five years ago?"
“Bilbie”: Let all the drovers take off
their hats to the Jardine brothers. These two, hailing
from Wellington (N.S.W.), started from Rockhamp-
ton in May, 1864, for Cape York, a distance of 1800
miles. They made their final jump into the unknown
from Carpentaria Downs, 900 miles from their
destination. The party comprised Frank and Alex-
ander Jardine, Richardson (surveyor), Binney,
Scrutton, Cowderv, four blackboys, 40 picked horses,
one mule and 250 head of cattle. They had four
months’ tucker, and reached Somerset in March,
1865. The mule and three-fourths of their horses died
through drinking salt water and eating poison weed ;
a fifth of their cattle, together with a large part of
their equipment, were destroyed by fire; they had to
fight the Binghis for 500 miles, the last 250 miles
of the journey being performed per boot. Tucker
during the last month was jerked veal, fish without
salt, ’possum, gohanna, turkey eggs, wild fruit roots.
The last 101 b. of flour was nursed in case of sick-
ness. Two days from Somerset the party came on a
lot of friendly abos. who escorted them to the settle-
ment. But for the skeletons of horses which the white
men bestrode Jardine, sen., who met them, would
not have recognised them from their black body-
guard.
* * * *
“Nil”: Want to argue? Well, liow many
of the expressions used by Australese slang-writers
are really Australian? A few, to begin with —purely
Australian, if there are any:—
“Sool.”—To set a dog (or anything) at some-
thing. This was originally “S-s-s-- - hold him, boy!
Hold him!” Later: “S-s-s- ’ool ’im!” The “S-s-s?”
ing noise was supposed to excite the dog’s attention
to the quarry.
“Rope-able.”—Wild, unmanageable; needing to be
“roped.” Referred to horses and cattle that would
not stand unless tied up.
“Old man.”-—Used as an adjective to indicate big ;
of the largest kind. Firstly applied to kangaroos. An
“old man” kangaroo was the biggest kind of buck.
I have heard it used thus: “My word! It was an
old-man thunderstorm!”
“Cocky.”—Small land-grabber who sat on the big
land-grabber’s fence and stole his produce. Now
used to mean any small farmer. From cockatoo, of
course.
“Waltzing Matilda.”—Blanket rolled up and con-
taining swagman’s kit. An allusion to the way in
which the swaggie turns round when slinging it on
his shoulder.
“Brusher” (rare). —Any nondescript old chap, like
the English “geezer.” Said to be in reference to an
old station cook who always commenced brushing
boots when he was annoyed. Or possibly from a like-
ness to a horse or bullock run wild in the “brush”
(scrub). The term “scrubber” is used in the same
sense.
“Joey.”—Youngster; baby. From the same word
used to mean an infant kangaroo.
“Ten and ten.”—Not used in these days, but hav-
ing reference to the periodical ration of a shepherd or
hut-keeper—lolb. meat, 101 b. flour, with sugar and
tea (see old Australian song, “The Squatter’s
Man”).
“Jackeroo.” —Man of all work on a station. No
doubt an Australianised form of “Jack-of-all-trades.”
“Whaler.” —A swagman who has a regular beat
up and down a river or whatnot. “Sundowner” applies
to. those who turn up at sundown and clear out in the
morning.
“Butcher.” —A long beer. Local to S. Aus., I
think. Said to refer to the habit of journeymen
butchers always wanting a long one.
I have purposely omitted words that are purely abo-
riginal or even probably so—such as “bogie,’’ a
bathe in a pool or river. Likewise many that were
coined by the blacks —such as “jumbuck” and
“brumby.” Nearly all the town and city slang —a la
Dennis —is of imported origin and derived from the
sea or Shoreditch.
* * * *
“Toby C.”: There’s no necessity for
“M.R.MeK.” (B. 24/8/’ 16) to lay elephant snares
to trap' the wombat. If he wants good badger
shooting let him set for the game with snares made
of six-strand twine attached to a springer. Set the
snares in such a position as to prevent his gills
getting a half-hitch hold on anything that will offer
resistance and afford the opportunity for a direct
pull. A sitting shot may be secured by careful
stalking.
* * * #
“R.A.Y.”: The ratepayers of the lower
watershed of the Richmond River (N.S.W.) are
growling at having to pay a farthing in the £ on
their land values towards keeping the river clear of
hyacinth. They argue that as the weed grows
nowhere except in the upper fresh-water streams,
only the landowners adjacent thereto should be
taxed to keep it in check. Similar arguments will
be used by landowners on the lower reaches of the
Clarence if it should be proposed to establish a
hyacinth board there. But the pest has a punch
in store for the landowners on the lower reaches of
both streams which they don’t appear to realise.
There has not been an old-man flood in either river
since the hyacinth took possession of the freshwater
tributaries. When such a flood does come it will
spread immense masses of the curse over all the
land it submerges, and because of the plant’s ex-
treme buoyancy it will be piled up yards high over
canefields, pastures and vacant riverside village
allotments. And on a heavily-saturated soil, large
masses of the weed, with the average rainfall of
these districts, might encumber the land for years,
until killed out by a long drought. To remove any
quantity of it would cost more than the original
clearing of land of its scrub or forest. The down-
stream people may not be able to see any hyacinth
about; but Belgium couldn’t see the Hun army
until it walked in and started to murder.

THE MEN WHO FOUGHT IN FLANDERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tlie men who fought in Flanders they were frequent
on the swear,
Their morruls were a trifle loose as well;
The men who fought in Flanders they were devils on
the tear,
But when they charged the foemen there was tempest
in the air,
And half the land was lost in half of Hell.
When Marlbro’ was in Flanders with his bulldog
scallywags
They passed the night a-sleepin’ in the fogs ;
. Their uniforms were builded up of mud and Flemish
bags,
But nothing damped their speerits—they were such a
lot of wags
They found a sort of humor in the bogs.
The men who fought in Flanders knew a lot about
the gaol,
And bothered not a bit about the Church ;
But not a gun of Louis’ ever made them turn their
tail—
They ate their share o’ powder and they faced the
bitter gale,
And never left a comrade in the lurch.
The men who fight in Flanders are a different sort o’
seed,
And yet their frequent langwidge is the same;
They live in mud and flourish, and they damn their
eyes and bleed,
And grin and go it gaily for the honor of the breed,
And perish for the glory of the game.
And nightly down in Flanders there are ghosts that
prowl around,
Attracted by a langwidge that they know—•
A witch's incantation, it has stirred ’em in the
ground
And brought ’em gaunt and flocking to the battle’s
bloody bound,
The langwidge that they first heard long ago.
They bristle when they hear it, and they nod their
heads in pride
To hear the blankies whizzing—not in vain.
It takes ’em back to Oudenarde when Death was in
the tide,
And tens o’ thousand Britishers €or Britain’s honor
died,
And now they hear the blessfid sounds again.

Costs in America nearly half as much again as Cars that sell here at about the same price.
Master of any situation, whether that situation demands sustained
Racing Speed, downright exertion, or the smoothest, softest action. We
, repeat with greater emphasis than ever before that the Mitchell is THE
MASTER SIX, AND WE ARE OPEN TO PROVE IT.
Eighty Years of Engineering Practice, being one of the three largest
Motor Factories in the U.S.A., the first Six-Cylinder Makers in the world,
and the very first in Automobile Trade, this vast experience and equip-
ment have enabled the Mitchell Co. to leave all other cars behind and to
build to-day The Master Six at a moderate price.
The Mitchell is built entirely in the Mitchell Company’s huge 45-acre
Factory. It is not an assembled car.
We do not know, nor do our customers, what it is to have the
slightest trouble with a Mitchell.
Will any other importer of a Six-Cylinder American Car guarantee to
take a full load over the Blue Mountains and back on high gear?
We guarantee this on the Mitchell.
Ask any other importer if his Six has done 26% miles per Gallon of
Benzine under official observation. The Mitchell has.
See if any other Six has Magneto Ignition. The Mitchell has the
famous Simms (late Simms Bosch). Battery makers admit that their
batteries are only good for from 12 to 18 months, but battery trouble
often starts at once, and certainly before long.
125-inch wheel base, long compensating Cantilever springs, guaran-
teed lighting and starting system, power tyre pump, magneto ignition,
one-man khaki hood, jiffy-side curtains, beautiful cojmfortable body, full
equipment.

Trafalgar”: Anyone know of a better
shearing record than this? “Parkes” Sutherland, of
Coolah (N.S.W.), is 63 years old, has been shearing
for 41 years, and has harbored over 80,000 sheep.
His highest tally is 208, done with the blades. Last
year his best day’s work with the tongs was 114 and
with the machines 106. lie attributes his long
shearing life to never drinking anything stronger
than rum, and reckons that if he sticks to that he
will shear a good many thousands more before his
final bell sounds.
* * * *
“Nym”: How is it that where rabbits
abound hares are absent, and vice versa? Where
crows are plentiful magpies and minas are missing.
Where shags hold sway over the fishing grounds of
the inland waters other waterfowl are difficult to
find. Whaffor?
“Dead Finish” : Can anyone explain why
sheep “tongue” ? After being driven some distance
numbers will be noticed to go down and start to
pant or “tongue.” Fat sheep are more prone to
suffer this way than those in low condition, especi-
ally in hot weather. My own opinion is that over-
driving 1 acts on the heart and causes a collapse; but
what has me beaten is that sheep left standing over-
night very often start to “tongue” as soon as they are
handled next day. The idiotic method of laying a
sheep on its side and belting it with the hand usually
means a through passage to the jumbucks’ Paradise.
So does pouring water down its gullet. The safest
plan is to drag the jumbuck to a shady spot, put it
in a sitting’ position and keep its nose out of the
dust. If it doesn’t give up the ghost straightaway
you can bet on getting anything up to 22d. per lb.
for its covering this season.
* * * #
“Te Babarantiko”: New Britain has
some remarkable insects, both large and small.
Near Mother Volcano I noticed a disturbance in the
powdery grey dust. From small holes in the ground
narrow erratic cha.V-els led through the dust, at the
end of each of which some powerful excavator was
at work flinging the dcsat to both sides, digging the
channel some t-inch into the powdery soil. With a
stick I found a beast closely resembling the grey-
backs that are so plentiful under wood and stone
in damp places, except that this fellow was a much
lighter grey, and right in front protruded a powerful
implement about three-quarters of an inch long, the
business end terminating in two powerful “horns,”
not unlike the blades of a propeller. Then there is
a sort of cross between a housefly and a wasp, with
brilliant, transparent wings, narrow-gutted and long-
legged, which made frequent visits to a circular
hole in the ground. Invariably the insect alighted
two or three inches from the hole, where it furiously
kicked the dust backward. Then it made a lightning
CONSOLATION.
BENEVOLENT OLD LADY: “ You’ve lost your husband, have you? Poor dear! Never
mind, here's sixpence."
dive for the abyss, suddenly paused on the edge, and,
with its head in the hole, set the dust flying
with its long legs. I could see no reason for the
furious dust-kicking, unless it mistook me for the
Kaiser and was preparing to dig itself in.
“Moz” : Hard luck? For three years
continuously I had been investing weekly in Tatt.’s.
One Saturday as usual we rode into town, and
before doing in my weekly allowance I entered
the tobacconist’s shop for the purpose of buying
my ticket. In the middle of the conversation a
newchum to the town came in and I stood back
to let him buy a ticket. Later I purchased mine
and departed. When the results came to hand I
was one more than the winning number. The
stranger now owns a pub; I am picking stumps in
the Mallee at 6d. an acre.
“Scaler”: Can any Abo. reader give me
information in regard to the “kanaka” disease among
Hereford cattle in Australia? The “disease” takes
the form of abnormally curly hair among odd beasts
in a herd —about seven or eight in 5000. Old
hands tell me that it was first noticed some 20 years
ago, when calves here and there had coats as curly
as a retriever dog's. In some cases smooth-coated
heifers have been noticed to gradually change until
their hair is all ringlets. Afflicted mothers do not
always transmit the peculiai ity to their offspring.
“Kanaka” cattle are always softer than smooth-
coated beasts, and will knock up very quickly when
driven ; also calves are the very devil and all to
catch when branding da}- arrives.
* * * *
“Walisnob”: To discourage “Taurua's”
rambling bull (B. 3/8/T6) put a strap round his
horns, another round his front leg below the knee
and couple up with a rope. His head will incline
when walking, but it will not prevent him from
working or feeding. Be on hand for rescue, how-
ever, if lie takes to swimming.
“Bad Australian”: What is the altitude
limit for the platypus? Away back in ’BB I was
prospecting on the King (Vic.), between the Hunch-
back and Mt. Ilowitt, where the scrub was as solid
as a wall, and one day while returning to camp my
mate and I logged a water-rat in a hollow musk butt.
We lifted the butt ashore and extracted the rat and
a full-grown platypus. That was 4340 ft. above sea
level, and the only tucker for a beast of plat.’s
particular breed to be found in the King at that
height was a diminutive and almost transparent fish,
which we called mountain “trout,” and a hard-
shelled, spiky yabbie about eight or nine inches over
all.
“Pick” : Johnson grass and others of the
sorghum species, like the variegated thistle, trefoil
and lucerne, are deadly only to animals unused to
them. At Model Farm, Tilba Tilba (N.S.W.), half a
dozen poddy calves lived continuously for weeks in a
growing field of planter’s friend, yet when the
owner's dairy herd broke into the paddock one night
there were 18 cows and a bull that didn’t attend the
roll-call next morning. I once helped to peel 175
travelling bullocks that had been permitted an hour’s
banqueting on the Wagga thistle flats, where herds of
local cattle had grazed all the season without injury.
The 175 were the fatalities in a mob of 300. “Nomad's”
cure, nitrous ether, may be all right for sorghum
poisoning, but my experience with affected cattle has
been that thdy throw the seven too suddenly for any-
thing except skinning.
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT DIFFERENTLY.
THE BOSS: "Hear you've got a new piccaninny, Jacky?”
JACKY ( desirous of paying a compliment) : " Yes, Boss. Flurry bowser —much same-
feller you, Boss.”
“YaiTum”: Queerest blackfellow I ever
knew was named John Murphy, alias Donkey Jack.
His headquarters were at Jamberoo, N. S. Wales (I
don't know a town more appropriately named), and
he once ate a pound of candles for a pint of beer.
A man who eats a pound (lib.) of candles for a
pint of beer has my entire admiration.
* * * »
“loo” : The reason horses eat the bark of
trees when there is plenty of green grass is because
they want something dry and solid at intervals. The
ether day five nags came to my place and kicked
and bit each other all for a feed of rotten, musty
straw. It really was too rotten for bedding. My
horse stood back with a smile on his face. He did
not want any, as he gets a hatful or two of chaff
daily. I have seen cows eat old thatch when they
ran in green feed knee high, but they would not
eat (lie old thatch three months before when they
were half starved.
* * * *
“C.H.F.”: (’an any experienced hunter
tell me how to get rabbits out of river flats and
banks ? Digging I know is effective, but owing to
the depth of the haunts the cost is prohibitive. The
bunnies with which I have to negotiate refuse to
stay indoors after being barricaded in all the most
likely ways I can think of.
* * * *
“Barcoo” : On the Western cattle stations
of the Diamantina and Georgina rivers, of far-back
Queensland, when, on account of distance from rail-
ways and mills, flooring boards were unprocurable,
a substitute was found in gidya and boree wood
ashes laid down in layers, each layer being treated
with hot, greasy water in which meat had been
boiled. The mixture made an almost indestructible
floor, almost, if not quite, as hard as sandstone.
Some adepts gave a finishing touch, which produced
a hard, glazed surface almost resembling a skating-
rink cement floor. The originators of the scheme are
supposed to have been West of Darling cooks.
* * « *
“Leira”: Wilkins and I had been fishing
on Sunday,, and when we met a week later he
asked if I remembered the schnapper he caught.
“Veil, when I got home,” he said, “I started to
clean it, and I found that it was filled with roe.
Having no taste for roe, I threw it into the dirtbox.
Three days later I lost my fountain-pen and turned
the house upside down in my efforts to find it. As
a last resource I turned out the dirt-box, which by
this time was well filled with dead leaves and rub-
bish, and, what do you think ? The warmth from
the dead leaves and rubbish had germinated the roe,
and in the bottom of the dirt-box were thousands of
wriggling baby schnapper.” I forgot to ask ' him
if he found the pen.
“Darnel”: If “Taurura” (B. 3/8/T6)
wants to keep his bull at home at nights he should
put a ring in its nose and attach about four feet of
chain. Should Romeo attempt wander he treads
on the chain and automatically applies the Westing-
house. A gentleman cow 1 owned broke his chain
once, and his Lordship made up for lost time by
tearing up a few rods of Canadian five-rail fencing
and smashing a threshing machine. Then he swam a
river and thoroughly enjoyed himself for three days.
We finally caught him by stalking him among a herd
of cows and slipping a hook through his nose-ring.
THE BLACK WATCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Private Douglas Grant, who left the other day to
take a hand in the argument in France, is a full-
blooded Binghi, picked up as a two-year-old in N.
Queensland 30 years ago by Robert Grant, chief
taxidermist at Sydney Museum. Grant adopted him,
taught him to wear kilts, to play the bagpipes, even
to recite Burns’s poems. The youngster learnt other
things also, and for 10 years was a draftsman at
Mort’s Dock. — Bulletin i 7/9/’l6.
Subpoenaed by the Fiery Cross
The ancient Scot went forth ;
He would not take a nolle pros.,
This raider from the North;
He served his process hot and strong
What time Black Douglas led the throng.
It was his job to ride the moss,
•And lift the border kine,
To catch the foe without the fosse,
And cleave him to the chine.
But since those days the world has moved:
Black Douglas has been much improved.
’Twas at the piccaninny stage
That art began to train
This triumph of the Austral age
To be the Kaiser’s bane,
And ere he grew to manhood’s height
They taught the stripling to recite.
They put a palette in his hand
That art he might profess;
They trained his spirit to withstand
All’ kinds of frightfulness ;
With bated breath men said: “By Cripes,
They’re teachin’ him to play the pipes!’’
’Twas then they wished that they were deaf,
And cursed in grim despair—
But when he joined the A.I.F.
They saw his ruse de guerre. ...
So Charlie Bean may soon relate
The story of the Kaiser’s fate.
Von Hindenburg will not avail,
Nor Ludendorf be proof,
Against the Austral pibroch’s wail
That lifts a dugout’s roof:
Black Douglas soon will end the war—
We should have thought of him before!
VICTORIA.

Another Triumph
for Wonderful
Kidney & Bladder
Pills
When a man is so long and so seriously ill that he, lus friends
and his doctors all give up hope of him ever getting well again,
and then he is, after all, completely cured, it may easily and
truly be described as remarkable —a great triumph.
'“I am over 60 years of age, and for over 40 years suffered
with what I was told was chronic Bright’s Disease While in the
early days I was able to do a little work, now for the last -0
rears I have not been able to work, except at very distant intervals
and then not more than two or three days at a time; in fact, I
have had to keep my bed for four or five months at a stretch.
“I have had many illnesses, each in itselt very serious. Once
I was so bad that I was given only five hours to live by my
medical man, but just pulled through more dead than alive. I
was so bad that even after I was supposed to have recovered my
friends tried to get me into a hospital, but I was refused admit
tance as ‘lncurable.’ ...
“Last March I was taken very seriously ill, tins time with
rheumatic fever. Here now, it was thought, was truly the end of
things; there was little hope ever entertained of my recovering. I
was rapidly and surely dying. . , . ,
“While I was so ill my son-in-law. hearing such remaikable
reports about the cures effected by I)e Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Bills, bought a box for me to try. I commenced to take them,
and to put it very mildly, was amazed to find in two days time
that all symptoms of fever had left me. In a week from first
commencing the pills I was able to get up, and I gradually got
stronger. It was not very long before' I was able to resume woik,
and since I once started I have not lost a single day from work
Surely this is wonderful after my past experience of years ot
t() be oW man, therefore I consider this case
most remarkable. My name, Arthur Jarvis, is well known m the
district of Battersea, and if anyone should doubt the truth of my
statement and should write or call on me at 62 I ranees Street,
o t w jn .rive them convincing proof of the truth of my
statement De* Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills have given me
a strength that I can truthfully say I have never before
expeiienced me ' a real pleasure in life, such as 1 have
" 0t e srlfb n „™ made iu July, 1912. It might tv,'ll
be wondered whether such a cure could remain permanent. Iwo
veara afterwards Mr. Jarvis said: “Although getting on in years
—I am now 66 years of age—l am going along wonderfully well

missed a single day from work. I have only got De Witt’s Kidney

strongly recommend them to all those I come in contact with who
are suffering in any way with the kidneys or bladder, because 1
feel that these wonderful little pills cannot become too well known. .
Nearly everyone knows that thousands of people die every year
from deadly kidney disease, but only a few are aware that this
terrible mortality is the result of sheer neglect.
When people are attacked by the first symptoms of kidney
disease, such as aches and pains in the various parts of the body,
puffiness under the eyes, cloudy urine, nasty taste in the mouth
first thing in the morning, they take no notice whatever. This is
where a terrible mistake is made, for kidney disease will not cure
itself. Neglect means that these symptoms turn into specific com-
plaints such as rheumatism, lumbago, gout, sciatica, cystitis, gravel,
stone, etc., which are the forerunners of deadly Bright’s Disease.
Just a little exposure to cold or damp and you have got a
pain in the back. Agony to bend or move any way, bad headache,
puffiness under the eyes; these mean for certain that you have
kidney trouble. Then you should look out for deadly Bright s
Disease, which creeps on unawares.
It is positively dangerous to trifle or play with the most
simple form of kidney disease.
If you have such symptoms as a nasty taste in the mouth first
thing in the morning, constipation, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, aches and pains in the muscles or joints, puffiness
under the eyes or bad headache, you certainly need De Witts
Kidney and Bladder Bills.
Or if you suffer from lumbago, backache, rheumatism,. gout,
sciatica, stone, gravel, or pains in the bladder, muscles and joints,
you are foolish to yourself if you do not commence to use these
wonder-workers immediately.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of kidney trouble you
must positively get rid of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember, to do this a real remedy must pass through the
kidneys and the bladder, and not through the bowels, as most
kidney pills do. When you see the urine change to a muddy bluish
color —a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all doubt they have put
their healing touch on the right spot—the kidneys and the bladder.
A wonderful pill straight to the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s
Bills give such amazingly quick relief —every time. A permanent
cure follows in almost every case. Look out for that blue-colored
urine. It means so much.
Many remedies claim to cure, and do without doubt give
relief for a time, but the one remedy which will give you quick
relief, and most probably a permanent cure, is De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Bills, for when once cured by these wonderful little
pills, our readers say they are cured for ever, just as Mr. Jarvis
was.

“A.J.G.”: When on the North Coast
(N.S.W.) lately I was dazzled by the cut
and general appearance of the suits worn
by the smartest sleeper-getters in one re-
mote town. The material used was mostly
of a deafening pattern, and the main features
of the architecture were a square-cut coat
reaching to within an inch of the knees,
with a low, open front; outside pockets
opening sideways in a graceful curve; and
rows, tiers and galleries of buttons sewn on
wherever it was possible to put them so that
they would make a big show without being
any use. The pants were tight and deco-
rated with more buttons, some of them
even having a few stuck on the turned-up
seams at the bottoms. I staggered round
appealing for an explanation, and at last
struck it. Whenever a certain tailor s
drummer tackled one of the lords of the
Coast for an order for another suit and the
customer protested “But I ain’t had this
one more than three weeks! the drummer
would reply. “That may be. but it’s right
out of stvle now, and you don’t want to be
a back number, do you?” It nearly always
worked. The poor bush fellow would be
separated from his cash and made to look
like a circus for the benefit of a shrewd
tailor who changed his horrible fashions as
often as he thought necessary. Naturally
khaki is not in great favor amongst the
buttoned asses.

risked syncope each day by trying not to
close before six and still catch the only
able train at 6.2. He used to shut the little-
used parts of his store at 5.10, pull in ins
pavement stuff at 5.30, lock up the sate at
5.45 and stack his hat, coat, bag and
umbrella on a roll of 3ft. lino, near the door
ready to bolt at 5.50. One evening Mrs.
Smithkins sailed in at 4.45 to buy a quarter-
yard of passage lino, to match a pattern
she bought when she started housekeeping
in ’B9. Working feverishly, Bloggs man-

slammed the door and fell into the guard s

helps oneself to plates of food. The self-
service barber slion only charges sd. a shave,
which is no more than the usual tip given
by the San Franciscan to bis barber.
■Dead Nuts”: The failure of Australian
walnut-growers to do better, deplored by
“Agricola” (B. 24/S/T6), is largely due,
according to Vic. fruit-inspector Carmody,
to casual methods. The general idea is that
one young walnut tree is as good as another
and there’s no need for grafting or selec-
tion ; but Carmody says you might just as
well catch a wild elephant and expect it
to give lectures in Divinity.
“Billy T.” : “I dunno what was the mat-
ter with the bloke, or where he come from,”
said the tram conductor, “but I’m wonderin’
at him still. We were doin’ our early-
morning run, when he suddenly appeared in
front of my ear in his shirt and trousers,
whirlin’ his arms like a windmill. We had
to haul in or run him under. When we
stopped he shoved a jug at me and sez : ‘A
pint o’ milk, please !’ ”

“Farder may recoffer,” said Mrs. Off-
bloom, “but lie' vill neffer pe der same man
since. He half a veak heart effer. Don’t
you hear off him? It vos Saturday der
feller come und buy dot seconthant suit
from farder. Farder haff only shust buy
der suit himself der tay before it. Der
feller vot buy dot suit out he ought to be
put by der gaol for a manshlaughterman.
He come back on Montay und he say:
‘Ullo, Offbloom, I haff find a five-pount note
in der vesd lining.’ Und he go ™y. he
don’t stay a rninid to pick farder oop. No
farder he von’t sell no von a secontliant
suit. He haff tore der linings from twendy-
fife suits out alreaty. He vill nelfer, 1 tea
me, pe able to sell a secontliant suit again.
All his bizness nerf iss gone.”

Hunting hakclcalcclca is one of Maoriland s
great natural industries. Haketcetera is an
edible fungus, and this is how the simple
Kcung nee advertises in the Bay of 1 lenty
Times
KOUNG LEE will buy fungus, dry and clean, at
sd. per lb., now. Fungus in China very cheap, in
China a lot of war too; no steamer go to China.
Anybody customer bring the fungus l will nuy.
Anybody customer got the fungus fetch it down heie
clean and dry. I pay sd. a lb. Cheap now.
“Cheap now,” says John, who has his own
way of doing business. A white man would
have said, “Highest prices given.”

Moran and Cato, the grocers who started
in a Melbourne suburb and then spread over
most of Australia, split up £4OOO in bonuses
amongst their employees this year. They
started the profit-sharing idea in 18S4, when
they handed out £36, and since then they
have paid £40,000. The man behind the coun-
ter isn’t the.weed of fiction, by the way, for
of 103 of Moran and Cato’s employees who
offered for service 88 were passed, and that s
a long way above the average.
The little printed slip that accompanied
the goods all the way from Tokio: —
These articles, produced under the most admirable
making method with the verv best possible and
expensive raw material on which we paid great
attentions and cares, and for the material we our-
selves and choiced in time of use supply some at
the end of it, then it improves pleasure more ancl
more than ever try one at once.

“Itimu” : When this war finishes we shall
talk about shelling the turnips and bombing
the beans. All along the Front, it seems,
people have been marvelling at the astound-
ing growth of vegetation. It is now
settled that this is not due to the
red rain that makes the harvest grow,
but to the effect of high explosives on the
soil. Not only does the explosion smash
up and aerate the ground and let the
moisture get to the roots, but it is believed
that the gases given forth are fertilisers of
the finest kind. Thus there’s one consolation:
the munitions left over after the Kaiser
has been hanged will be worth something.
“Croson” :Re ginseng growing. For a
start the man who is barracking for it
might explain how it is that none of the
numerous Chow gardeners who pervade the
Commonwealth have seized the opportunity
to make £lOOO to £2OOO a year from an
acre of the fodder. The tale of the two
Ohio (U.S.A.) girls who are doing this
may be genuine; but Ah Fat doesn’t make
that off his cabbagee and callot plots, and if
the roots are used so copiously in his coun-
try he should be well aware of the money
in them.
* * * *
“Dear Food”; The latest official price
list for Vic. is a weird document. One of
the ideas at the bottom of it seems to be
that imported stuff must be better than the
local goods. ■ For instance, the wholesale
price for imported barley and groats (lib.
tins) is 10s. per dozen, but for the local
article you mustn't charge more than s.
fid There is Is. for the retailer on each. The
profit allowed on various lines> of
patent foods varies without a PP f ? r ®X r ffi n
nr reason If a grocer buys and sells Alien
andhlanbury’s ft 10a. «•
makes Is. Sd. per dozen, but if handles
Benger’s at 16s. he is allowed 3s. pei dozen.
On Benger’s 225. Od. per dozen size he is to
make ss. 6d. per dozen, selling at 2 s. 4d
per tin; but if he pays the 24s dozen
fixed for Glaxo lie has to sell it at 2s. 4d.
per tin too. The wholesale price of Mellins
small bottles is 13s. fid. and the retail Is.
fid. per bottle, so there s a profit of 4s. Od.
on an outlay of 13s. 6d. lhat s oo 3 P
cent., so that on this line the retailer ought
to be able to scratch along. But will
probably feel like going out of those ou
which he is cut down to 30 per cent.
* * * *
“F NT”: A grave warning has been
issued by' the Inter-State Commission
Excepting perhaps the State of Westralia, it is
highly probable that within 30 years, at the present
rate of consumption, we shall exhaust our accessible
market supplies of all the more valuable timbers,
and it is not unreasonable to anticipate a later period
when Australia will depend upon other countries foi
her supplies of eucalypt hardwoods.
In Victoria a tree-planting campaign is
being conducted with some vigor by the
present Minister for Forests, but in spite
of the foregoing report —or perhaps m igno-
rance of it —a vast proportion of the trees
will be softwood, mostly that imported
false-alarm, the Finns insignis. A few days
00-o cuttings of this pine out of a plantation
a° few miles from Melbourne realised only
“fair prices.” Mostly we import our soft-
woods. Though there is no reason why we
should continue to do so for long, since we
arc able to grow them ourselves, it seems
absurd that we should attempt to overtake
the supplv of softwood imports while we
remain indifferent to the danger of being
unable to supply our own increasing de-
mand for hardwood. Wo can do both, or
course; but we are doing neither on a scale
worth mentioning.
O COW!
(.-In address to the three champion cows of U.B.A.
who have between them produced over 35 tons of
milk in a year.)
[For. Tim Bulletin.]
O Cow ! Fair Cow, with tranquil eyes !
So angular in form ! So wise !
With horns on which to hang a hat!
You’re worth your weight in butter-fat 1
No dead machine of polished steel
Excels you as you eat your meal,
And use your tail just like a fan
Whilst making butter-fat for man.
The Spring grass stirs the poet’s blood ;
He raves and writes— you chew the cud.
When you have done there’s milk for me.
He yields—a quart of poetry!
O Cow ! O perfect, tranquil Cow !
Don’t tell the tink’ring Yankee how
You make that splendid drink for me
In your own dark dispensary !
The soda fountain on you waits,
And man, who plays with transient hates,
While powder's burned and shells are hurled
Hangs out the milkean round the world.
O Cow ! O Cow ! O peaceful Cow !
Don’t tell the busy Yankee how
You do the trick ! For, if you do,
He’ll build machines to make your brew.
O tranquil eye! O silken hide!
O tail that swings the stream beside !
What Art could match, what Science doom
You and your secret engine-room !
N.S.W.
COW-VALET.
THE INHARMONIOUS HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A voung ladv, described as a specialist on home-
furnishing', lecturing in Melbourne a few nights back,
contended that defective color schemes were often
the cause of bad temper.
Should marriage in your case appear
A failure, friend, do not repine.
It does not follow that your dear
Is not superlatively fine.
The rows may be no fault of hers
Perhaps your sideboard and your stairs
Don’t match your chairs.
When carpets are at variance
With curtains, all in vain will be
Your efforts to preserve romance—
The occupants will not agree.
If life’s become a perfect scream,
Make haste, my brother, to redeem
Your color scheme.
When all your wall-tints are at strife
With the linoleums, of course
You’ll naturally beat your wife.
Don’t rush away to seek divorce,
Wipe out the cause of all your pain,
Your little home touch up again
With Smugson’s Stain.
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Married men next.” the loudest anti-
conscriptionist of Sydney shouted the other
day. But the curse of the “voluntary”
system has been that thousands of married
men have gone who should have stayed at
home till the available single men were
exhausted. Every few days there are
reports in the papers concerning the distress
of soldiers’ widows who have been left with
five or six young children. Those men
wouldn’t have been allowed to go under a
proper system of conscription, and the
country would have been saved an annual
pension bill of probably hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds, not to speak of the married
soldiers’ “separation” allowance. The same
thing is still going on: married men with
families, seeing the urgent need for rein-
forcements, are getting into khaki, leaving
their children to be maintained by the Com-
monwealth (as, of course, they should be)
while tens of thousands of men without
domestic responsibilities hang back.
GLITTERING PROSPECTS.
FIRST: “ Gorblime! Shake it up! Old Money-
bags offered us five bob for every Ger-
man we killed, and ’ere they come.”
SECOND: “ ’Ow many?”
F IRST: “About thirty thousand.”
SECOND: “ Gripes! Our fortune’s made.”
Many of those who are howling against
Conscription now were very ready with
their abuse of President Wilson and the
people of the U.S.A. after the Lusitania in-
cident. They can look out for a return
blizzard of scorn if their verdict is “No.”
Out of compliment to the nation which an
adverse vote in the Referendum would most
benefit, the Commonwealth Parliament might
make the negative “Nein” instead of “No.”
“Yes” for Australia; "Nein” for Germany.
How the “voluntary” system works:
Here is a ease. The recruiting-sergeant came to
a young fellow who has to support his mother and
young sisters —-his father is dead —and asked him,
“What about going up?” This chap said, “You go
to So-and-so [a sheep cocky with a splendid place
and money and stock galore] and get his son Bob
la young fellow of 23, standing 6ft.].” The ser-
geant said, “Oh, his father can’t spare him
which meant, is too mean to employ another man.
The chap replied, “Neither can my mother
me, and I think vou’ve got an infernal nerve. So
do I.
That is the “system” we are working on;
and when it is proposed that an independent
tribunal shall be set up to decide who can
be spared—a tribunal which wouldn’t take
a mean man’s greed as a good excuse the
amazing P.L.L. attacks it as undemocratic !
The newest bit of territory under Aus-
tralian control put in a word about the
last Commonwealth War Loan. Rabaul held
70 persons who were prepared to subscribe
to the extent of over three thousand pounds.
London, the headquarters of a crowd of
alieged Australians who have done so well
out of the Commonwealth that they have
gone to England to spend the spoils, raked
up only seven subscribers, who put up less
than two thousand pounds
The distressing howls which come every
now and then from Yanco, and get a joyful
welcome from the Sydney press, which hopes
thereby to give its good old friend Private
Enterprise a boost, at least prove one virtue
in Sosli. There is someone to howl to.
Years ago, when Mildura was young and
charming, and people were buying land at
rates that caused them to fly to Sosli later
on for help, a privately-owned irrigation
settlement was started at Mulgoa. near
Penrith. Several people bought land there
at about 15 times its real value, gladdened
Ivv glowing prospectuses about umbrageous
pumpkin trees and prodigious peaches, and
fortified by the co.’s magnificent guarantee
to supply so much water per annum. Then
things went wrong, and when the debris
had been swept up, the land purchasers
had their land and their water right but no
water, and there hasn’t been any ever since
except when it rains. Sosh may make mis-
takes, but at any rate it doesn’t blow up or
evaporate or otherwise dematerialise when
it is most badly wanted.
Frank Tudor last week resigned the port-
folio of Customs, and thus threw another
ewt. at party government. Tudor knows
more about the Customs Department than
any other man in the House. As a felt
hatter he studied it at home and abroad, it
was his job in the first Fisher Ministry and
it has been his job in every Labor Ministry
since. But because Tudor doesn’t agree
with his leader over some one. thing or
other, and is either too conscientious or too
afraid of his constituency to pretend to, the
country must see him go out and an appren-
tice take up the tradesman’s job.
The N. S. Wales Parliamentary
Committee on Venereal Diseases
has been getting the opinions of
prominent schoolmasters on the
subject of teaching sex hygiene.
Of course the masters would rather
not touch the beastly subject. For
instance. Kilgour, of Fort-street
High School, considered the
parents should give the instruction.
Still, if the Outrage had to happen
in the schools, it should be com-
mitted to doctors, because “much
harm would be done if the subject
were not properly handled.” Do
these people realise exactly what
they are doing by thus turning the
frozen eye on the proposed reform?
Where does the average youngster
get his knowledge of sex liyviene
under present conditions? From
enlightened parents or doctors?
Not much! He gets it from his
own mates —mostly from the worst
of them—and he gets it long before
he is 15. One result is patent in
the stranglehold that syphilis and
kindred curses have on the popula-
tion. And there are other results,
some of them almost as undesir-
able. Any system of instruction
would be better than the present—
which is an accident and not a
system at all.
The N. S. Wales Industrial Court has
declared that strike levies are illegal, and
therefore the unions, in humble obedience,
collect them no longer—unless they are
strong enough to make the administrators
of the law the humbly obedient party. In
that ease the old tribute goes on. Down in
Griffith 20 members of the Railway Workers’
Union went on strike the other day because
the ganger had failed to pay a six shillings’
levy made in connection with another strike :
and until it occurred to somebody that it
was cheaper to pay the six shillings than
have 500 men on strike, serious trouble
threatened. Last year the big railway
workers’ organisation raked in nearly £l4OO
in levies; which is not bad, considering that
it cannot be done.
What the Age calls a “real estate
romance” was brought to notice lately when
W. Patterson, of the Melbourne Mutual
Store, bought the Ballarat drapery business
of John Snow and Co. for £50.000. ihe
premises stand on a corner of a block
bounded by Sturt, Doveton, Dana and
PARADISE UP-TO-DATE—NO. 3.
RECENT A VIATOR: “Not such a novelty as I
thought it would be!”
Armstrong streets, which was bought at
auction in 1852 for £lOO by Thomas Cosby
Riddle, of Geelong. He sold it live years
later for £l2O. To-day it is reckoned worth
£750,000. Who made that block of land
bought in the first place for £lOO worth
three-quarters of a million? And to whom
does the £749,900 honestly belong?
Peacock is really going to do something
■at last—he is going to stop other people
from kookaburring so much. He threatens
to amend the Standing Orders so that ordi-
nary windbags shall subside after 45 minutes
of explosion, though “interesting” orators
may be allowed 30 minutes’ overtime. The
Leaders of the Douse and the Opposition
or their deputies may, however, babble on
as heretofore; also none of the restrictions
are to apply where they are most wanted,
to censure motions and addresses-in-reply.
There is nothing violent about Peacock.
There is one logical man in the Speck’s
Assembly, anyway. When it was the other
day proposed that members should knock
off work for a fortnight to plead with other
men to go to the Front, F. F. Blyth put it
to his brethren whether it was a job that
hadn’t better be left to the women, they
alone being ineligible for the obvious retort
discourteous. But, as usual, they decided
to risk it, though they will take good care
not to depend upon the same voluntary effort
for their salaries.
The Holman Government has put its
finger on the spot. Australia wants popu-
lation more than it wants anything else in
the world except political honesty; and all
that can be done for the mothers is not too
much. Bush mothers have hitherto had the
most to complain about; but they are now
to be relieved of some of their old misgivings
and forebodings. Every hospital in N. S.
Wales is to be encouraged to have a mater-
nity ward, and the expense of establishing
it will be refunded by the Government.
Hitherto it was a scandal that there were
only seven hospitals with maternity beds
outside the metropolis.
What poor little bluffers these party poli-
ticians are! Asked what it was going to do
about running a candidate for Gordon
against Wade, the local P.L.L. told its
executive that it considered Wade to be
such an excellent organiser for Labor that,
in order that he might be free to assist
Labor candidates all over the State by talk-
ing for their Liberal opponents, he should
be unopposed. The simple fact is that
Gordon is quite hopeless from the Labor
point of view. But there is no honesty .left
in party politics, and the truth is not in
them.
Something that happened in Melbourne
the other day reminds this paper that Aus-
tralia might, after all, learn some business
efficiency from the U.S.A. A deputation o
women had waited on the Minister of Edu-
cation, and after they had talked at the
usual great lengta.
Lawson, instead of say-
ing nothing at equal
length, as- a Minister is
expected to do in such
circumstances, read a
previously-prepared and
typed “reply.” Then,
of course, there was an
explosion, yells of dis-
courtesy and a threat
that the Minister would
be thrown out on his
chin at the next elec-
tion. Uncle Sam does
do this thing better.
His Ministers don't
waste in the aggregate
months in the year lis-
tening to self-adver
tisers repeating them-
selves. To them “depu
tations” are practically
unknown. They see
people in an ordinary
business-like way; but
the vast bulk of the
requests which in Aus-
tralia are put sloppily
by deputations have
there to be reduced to
writing. Then there is
something to go on, and
no outrageous waste of
time, not to talk of
money.
There are still pick-
ings. Of the seven Par-
liamentary members of
tne N. S. Wales Public
Works Committee, the
chairman has managed
to average over £6OO a
year in fees during the
last three years and the
others £4OO. Some of
this goes back to party
funds; so the electors
are made to pay foi
maintaining the Parliamentary system
which cheats them.
“Copabella”: My friend Jinker had only
one comment to make. “Oh, it’s on Octobe
28, is it? Well, that ain’t too bad. They
can’t shoot us into camp before the Cup.
anyway.”
Even the Hampden Shire Council, repre-
senting some of the richest pastures in Vic-
toria, shamelessly permits its mouth to
water as it gazes on the money available for
use .by the Country Roads Board. Land-
holders from Lismore and Foxhow came
down to the shire hall at Camperdown the
other day, and asked the Hampden Council
to improve their roads. The holdings in
question lie to the north and west of Lake
Corangamite—a country inhabited by some

“But I beat them, my dear, I sent the washin’

of the fattest landlords in Australia. David
Oman, is a prominent member of
the Hampden Council, and he thus stated
the position:—
It would cost at least £50,000 to repair the
roads mentioned. The council could not do it
without the assistance of the Country Roads Board
or increasing the rate, which latter is undesir-
able.
It looks like a record in municipal mendi-
cancy.
THE LAY OF THE LAST PARTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Outski!” he said and pointed towards the door.
Ilis casting vote as chairman did the trick.
Alone he occupied both chair and floor,
Contriving arguments his own to lick.
The platform still remained. Its weighty planks
Must hold the party now reduced to one.
Firmly he trod it, passed a vote of thanks
To his official self for service done.
Unshrinking in his splendid solitude,
He met himself, paid levies, fines and dues,
And labored grandly to be understood,
Expressing to himself his strongest views.
Selections, correspondence, motions passed
Made up the sum of lonely nights and days;
Me nailed his colors grimly to the mast
And proudly earned his own unstinted praise.
Without, none heeded. Legislators rose,
Framed policies that owned no party plan ;
None led the slack electors by the nose ;
In truth’s deep channel the wide franchise ran.
But he remained, the last of all his race,
Keeping with zeal to his unheeded course.
lie often called his party to its face
A critical, not legislative, force.

SPORTING
NOTING
Racing at Rosehill (Sydney) on Saturday
proved once more that the Bar Vons are giving the
public a long way less than a fair deal, and that
the public is ready to take any old thing in the way
of odds which may be on offer. The prices were
deadly. A punter who had the exceptional luck to
back every winner with a sovereign would have won
£26 10s. —and two of the winners were comparative
outsiders, on either of which the tote would most cer-
tainly have paid that much or more. If the crowd
that rushes every week into Israel waving money in
its hands gets the same sort of handling at Randwick
during the A.J.C. meeting, it is going to have a
good time thinking about its quids afterwards. The
argument for the machine is nowadays the argument
for having lifebelts on a ship, and if the racing
clubs and politicians don’t attend to the matter the
only survivors are going to be the individuals who
retain their presence of mind and cling to inflated
bags.
The racing at Rosehill established two or three
things, among them that Cetigne is still a brilliant
miler, that Wolaroi is a very fine colt, and that
anyone who knows the winners of the Epsom and
Metropolitan has some useful and exclusive informa-
tion. In the w.f.a. Spring Stakes, Cetigne (9st.
31b.) won by a length in lmin. 39 ij secs. from Pan-
acre (9st. 31b.) and Blague (9st. 31b.), with the
Melbourne Cup favorite Lingle, Garlin and Wil-
liam the Silent astern. It looked as if the
gap between the winner and the others might
have been widened, but whether that be so or
not the race satisfied this page that Cetigne with
9st. 61b. in tlie Epsom has got to be reckoned with ;
also that Blague is no slouch over a mile, and
with an advantage of 161 b. over Cetigne instead of
a disadvantage of 31b. will make the event interesting
at some stage or other. Garlin iooked a different
horse than at Tattersall’s meeting a week before, and
was well up. Little William said nothing but
sweated a lot before the start and pulled up sore.
Lydian and Costello, two imported mokes, which have
been backed for the Epsom, were heavily supported
for the Camellia Stakes. Both did as badly as
possible. Recent running boils down to this: of
the Epsom candidates seen out, the most impressive
performances have been by Polvcrates, Cetigne,
Panacre and Blague. But some Epsom candidates
have not lately been showing themselves too often.
The Rosehill Guineas were won last year
by Wallace Isinglass, who was downed a fortnight
later by Cetigne at Randwick. Before the race was
decided this year there were fierce arguments about
the relative merits of Wolaroi and William Brown’s
Thana. In the Chelmsford Stakes at Tatt.’s meeting
the filly was in front at the right end. On Saturday
Walaroi (Sst. 51b.) was there and Thana (Bst.) was
second —and the arguments started all over again
as to whether at Derby weights and another furlong
to go there would be another change. Well, this
page always speaks with great humility about these
things, but it takes the risk of expressing the
opinion that the colt will win. Thana got badly
bumped on the journey. That counts for something.
But that Wolaroi had a bad position at the start
and left the mark when all the others had departed
and won with Wood holding a lump up his sleeve '•
counts for something, too. The Earlston-Velox colt
Bucklaw was third. He looks every inch a Derby
nag.
Cagou won the Rosehill Handicap from
end to end on Saturday, lumping along top weight,
Sst. 131 b. He was fairlv well backed arid arrived
at the judge’s box two lengths in front of Kings-
burgh, with Victorian nag PTetty Bobby in third
place. It was about up to Cagou to win, anyhow,
for 12 months had passed since he came home first,
and peculiarly enough it was on the same course.
This horse has to carry Bst. 121 b. in the Metro-
politan. Kingsburgh has Bst.- 71b. in that event, or
41b. less than he had on Saturday. Cagou beat
the Melbourne "Cup winner of ’l4 by that poundage
and more, but Kingsburgh had a passage that was
none too good and lost a lot of steam recovering
ground in the first six furlongs. Pretty Bobby is
in the Metrop. with 7st. 71b., half a stone less
than he was burdened with at Rosehill. That is a
circumstance worth remembering. Most of the cattle
which finished behind the placegetters will be
runners at Randwick, but on paper would not
have much chance.
* * * *
Just prior to the last Y.R.C. Melbourne
Cup meeting Earnshaw’s Loved One (Duke of Melton
—Bui Bui) was considered to have more than a
chance with Comedia (same owner and stable) of
annexing one or more events, including the Oaks.
She did nothing and has often been a disappointment
since. Last Saturday week she was in front at the
distance in Tattersall’s Welter Mile, won by Karan-
aud King, but finished up sixth. On Saturday, ridden
bv the Queensland jock P. O’Neill the lady beat Royal
Parade by a neck in the Rosehill Rydalmere Mile,
after a clashing finish. Royal Parade was also
second a week earlier. During the week Bombita,
from the Cold Country, was backed for a ton of
money to win the Epsom, and as he is trained at
Rosehill by the successful and astute W. Booth, he
was wildly supported by the public prior to the event.
They got it in the neck. Bombita ran like a mule.
Words to the same effect apply to Two Blues, also
backed for the Epsom.
* * * *
Mannikin Crockett was at it again at Rose-
hill, and so was Randwick trainer Harry Robinson.
They produced Merimee and made no mistake, about
annexing the Camellia Stakes! six furlongs. Crockett
is one of the best lads who claim an allowance these
days, and is not suffering from lack of opportunities
to do it. Round about this period last year young
Dempsey, of Vic., was in the boom. Anything that
he was hoisted aboard was backed with hard coin,
and for a time the public usually saw its money well
up at the most exciting moment. But he hasn’t been
much in the limelight recently.
During the last A.J.C. meeting the Law
was being called upon every five minutes or so to
make a rule nisi or something about an aged animal
named Garthowen, the result of it all being that
while Costs leaped round the horse had a holiday.
The straightening out was accomplished at lengtn,
and on Saturday the nag was liberated in a hurdle
race at Rosehill. He was so wild at what had
happened that he is stated to have informed every
citizen in Sydney that he was going to win. Any-
how, he started at 6 to 4 in a big field and refused
to give anything else a chance. After having chaied
at the Law’s delays it looks as if _ Garthowen may
make a name for himself over timber until the
fardels imposed by handicappers make him sweat
too much. He was ridden by Moon, who within
the last month has won races in S. Aus., Vic. and
N. S. Wales.
* * * *
Last week The Bulletin called atten-
tion to the fact that three of the Randwick winners
on the previous Saturday were by imported nags,
while 13 of the 18 place-getters were sired by horses
bred out of Australia. Now it has to record that
all five winners of flat races at Rosehill last Satur-
day had recent pommy blood in their veins, and
four other place-getters had imported dads.
Dan Seaton is one of the luckiest men in
the horse-racing’ line to-day. Lucky in the sense
that he always seems to have a good nag while other
men prepared to pa.y big prices for their horseflesh
cannot acquire anything out of the ordinary. Wol-
aroi is his present first prize. When the colt won
the Rosehill Guineas he brought his earnings to
over £BOOO. And this seems a convenient point to
mention that no winner of the Rosehill Guineas
has yet been led in winner of the Derby at Rand-
wick'. Seaton has another classy youngster in East-
court, who ran unsuccessfully in the Camellia Stakes
on Saturday, while there are others of the string
which look nearly as good investments as Dan’s
carcases of beef and mutton.
If entries continue to climb, tlie A.J.C.
will find itself compelled to begin meetings before
breakfast. The Spring Meeting general entries this
year jumped to 925 —54 ahead of last year. So far
the books have patriotically refrained from protest-
ing that big entries (especially in the Kensington
Handicap, with 90) interfere with the public’s con-
venience in finding the winner.
* * * *
Maori!;)nd trotting clubs are simplifying
their tangled starting system. Some clubs issued
starts “per second,” others “per yard”; and in the
confusion it was difficult to find fault with reversals
of form. Sydney clubs might well simplify, too.
At present N.S.W. Trotting Club pushes the gee-gees
off on the “seconds” system; the Australian - Trotting
Club utilises “yards.” As there seems room for both
methods there should be more room for one.
A bloke lately fell into the Melbourne
police office with a most hilarious confession of being
wrongfully at large. He was a country toiler, and
having amassed £3OO thought it was about time to
buy a trotter. So he brought the cash along, and
while looking for a suitable animal in a coffee-
palace he met a couple of chaps who advised him to
have nothing to do with trotters but to go into part-
nership with them on a scheme for achieving wealth
by backing gallopers. According to the story un-
folded by himself to the staggered Hops, the proprie-
tor of the three centuries passed over the dough on
Ihe spot, and when he went to find his partners and
whack up the plunder they d won from Ikey Mo, there
was, of course, nothing there except a large vacancy.
It seems incredible, but there it is. This paper long
ago came to the conclusion that every person arriving
in a city with more than 2d. should be at once put
into a straight-waistcoat and chained to a tree unless
he promised to yell “Murder!” 16 times within one-
fifth of a second of hearing anyone mention horse,
wager, winner, or change for a fiver. Failing that,
the best thing would be to appoint a staff of State
magsmen, commissioned to get away with suckers’
money for the benefit of patriotic funds and hurry the
flats away to earn some more and come back to town
before the ’possums swallowed it.

The Strathmore sport A. 11. W. Cunning-
ham has another Queensland record. He has 14
horses in his stable, and in the 12 months prior to
August 1 they won 42J races. Has any other owner
in Australia been guilty of anything like this? The
nags on two occasions cleaned up a two-days’ pro-
gramme of 12 events. Tommy Yule, the crack
N.Q. amateur horseman, rides a lot for this stable,
and he recently piloted nine winners in 12 events.
* * * *
There was a collision at Sydney Stadium
on Saturday between featherweight champion Jimmy
Hill and “Babe” Picato, a swarthy American-Italian
with a heavy wallop. The tonnage was 9st. 41b.
Hill boxed, as he always does, with great cleverness,
frequent wildness and little force, and he went
down as he always will to anyone who can hit him
—hard. Picato didn’t look much to start with.
Hill made him miss often and badly. But when he
warmed up arid steadied James with thumps that
were hard and frequent there was not much doubt
about what was going to happen. It was a fast,
open go, with Hill operating mainly at long range,
and Picato fighting determinedly for close action.
In the sixth Jimmy got it for nine and twice after-
wards hard on the jaw. In the seventh he was
rocked to sleep witli one on the neck.
Old-timer Frank Thorn and Patsy
Bratmigan, from Dollarland, exchanged swipes as a
matter of business at Brisbane on Saturday. The
stranger got the worst of the deal and an injured
nose. He was very much annoyed about it, too, and
expressed great surprise that the referee had omitted
to hand him the bacon. Whereupon the audience
yelled rude remarks, and Patsy withdrew to Sydney
to get his nose well and defend it against further
assault and battery.

Frank Hagney. who lately annexed a
South American boxing championship, has had a
many-sided athletic career. At various times
brothers Frank and Jack Hagney struggled to reach
championship niches in cycling and sculling, but
fell short. Then Frank went a-touring with brudder
Jack Johnson as sparring partner. It was “Dick”
Arnst who started this fever in the Ilagney blood.
When “Dick” won a Sydney Thousand, the Jim
Stanbury “stable” took him in hand as a likely
sculler. After a frightful beginning—caused by
ability to fall out of the outrigger more often than
keep in it —Arnst made good. Then Arnst turned
his mind to boxing, but a few bashes altered it.
Hagney came on the scene when Arnst was just
about full up of the business; and now where
Arnst failed Hagney has been able to buy a small
sandwich. # 4
Reports that Mike Gibbons is (1) going
to visit Australia and get away with Darcy and (2)
is not going to do anything of the sort and (3)
that Jack Dillon threatens to do the same thing
both ways probably mean that Mike and John
are holding the Yank promoter up for all the
dollars there are in the house. Yet if they did
happen to come along about the same time there
would be a lot of cash in the trip. A match Darcy
v. Gibbons, and another Darcy v. Dillon, and then
a go between Dillon and Mike, would be a carnival
of bash that might cause the Anzacs to rush in and
end the war in a week in order to get back in time
for the early doors.

Concerning Larry Sealy, who went down
to “Daffodil’ Apperly in the final of Manly (Sydney)
golf championship, the writer wonders whether there
is a man in the State who can equal his athletic
record. About 10 years ago the Irish Cyclist said
of him; “If a plebiscite were taken in Ireland as to
which of her sons could lay claim to the title of
all-round champion of athletics, of a certainty Mr.
L. R. Oswald-Sealy would carry the palm. He’ll
swim, cycle, race, polo, jump, ‘gouf,’ croquet,
GEORGE SHARD,
of Vic. lawn-tennis.
tennis, box or row any
man you can bring before
him, and he’ll make a
better aggregate perform-
ance in all these sports
than any other man in
Ireland. In addition,
he is one of Ireland’s
best footballers and
cricketers, and can play
a spanking good game
at billiards, skittles or
quoits; while he can
wing a bird with the
best sportsman going. . . .
At sports gatherings Mr.
Oswald-Sealy enters for
every event on the pro-
gramme, and takes a
cycle race, a jump or a
foot-race, or all three, as
he finds himself in the
mood; and rarely does
he leave a meeting with-
out a big burden of pots.
At a recent meeting in
Ireland he won the
100yds. sprint and
440yds. flat race, and
got second in the 10-
miles cycle race —-all in
the one afternoon !.. . .
He has in all consider-
ably over 400 prizes.”
Larry’s most strenuous
occupation nowadays is
managing a Sydney pic-
ture theatre.
Jack Donaldson, Australian sprinter, seems
to he losing his pace. Anyhow, he couldn’t get
away from the Law the other day, and when asked
to explain what he meant by not being in khaki
announced that he arrived in England to run after
cash and not after a bayonet. As the beak
handed him over to a military escort to get measured
for a gun, it seems as iL John is going to be given
a fresh chance where the starter’s pistol sounds like
the bursting of 272 volcanoes running a dead heat.
The achievement of E. W. Carr (Sydney
Grammar) in the Great Public Schools’ champion-
ships last week-end mark him as the nimblest lad
of the year. He won the 220yds. (23 l-10sec.) and
440yds. (53-lsec.), and was second in the 100yds.
(11 2-ssec.) and broad jump (20ft. 10fin.). J. F.
Cripps (Newington) made an effort to sweep up the
programme, and the enterprise ended in success in
the 100yds. (11 l-ssec.) and broad jump (20ft.
lllin.), and second in the 220yds., 440yds. and
high jump. Two performances at the meeting stand
out: A. L. Cooper’s high jump (sft. 5-lin.) and B.
Maguire’s mile in 4rnin. 41sec. (3-ssec. better than
the schools record). Generally schools records stood
the strain, chiefly through exuberant youth attempt-
ing too much. These boys want some good advice.
Lieut. Leo Butler, the long Tasmanian
who was recently killed in France, belonged to a
family that has done as much for cricket as any in
Australia. Ever since the game was played on the
Speck a large collection of Butlers nave been busy
boosting it along. Some of the old brigade, parti-
cularly C.W. and E.II. (uncle and father of Leo),
were prominent performers in inter-State cricket
away back in the ’7o’s and 'SO’s. C.W. has a lot
of fine performances to his credit, and was once
selected to play for an Australian XI in England.
E.II. once put up a record for Australia by taking
seven wickets for 0 in a North v. South Tasmanian
affair. About umpteen younger members of the clan
have worn the flannels in the Speck, these including
Lieut. Angus (formerly of South Hobart) and Lieut.
L.T., last year’s Rhodes scholar, who has postponed
his visit to Oxford in order to crowd in at the Front.
Frank Lugton is the first Victorian
cricketer of Sheffield Shield rank to be bowled in
Europe. A fairly fast medium-pace, he was a good
performer for Northcote before he was chosen to
attack Ma and S. Aus, in 1913-14. He found inter-
state batsmen more difficult to bowl than club men,
and his four wickets in the two big games cost more
than 50 runs each. Still, he was only a boy then.
He was also a fine footballer, and played many dash-
ing games for Melbourne.
The engagement of cricketer J. N.
Crawford as coach at Dunedin (M.L.) has been ter-
minated by arrangement. A couple of seasons ago
Crawford offered to forego his fee, but the Associa-
tion said it couldn’t hear of it, whereupon J.N.
settled down to business, made a home for two, and-
is now off to the Cold Country.

Killed in the Italian firing-line—Lieut. G.
Sinacran-lia who won the Diamond Sculls at Henley
(Eng.)” in 1914, the year following C. McVittey’s
success. In his preliminary heat the Italian defeated
pinks (London), runner-up in 1913; Ayer (America)
in the second round ; Dibble (Canada) in the third ,
and Colin Stuart (Cambridge) in the final. One of
the London sporting -papers referred to Smagagha as
“probablv the biggest man seen in a racing shell.”
He was 6ft. 4in. and weighed 15st. But that made
him a mere bantam compared with L. Bidault, a
Frenchman, who had competed at a London regatta
in 1879. This comprehensive bloke attained an alti-
tude of 7ft. 2in. and sent the scales up to 17st. He
used sculls almost as long as oars, and his fastest
rate of striking was about 22 a minute. Monsieur
was snuffed out in a preliminary by someone who
measured about a yard less.-
Jimmy Macfarlane, newly-elected presi-
dent of Albert Park (Vic.) Rowing Club, probably
would not be accepted for active service except in
a bantam brigade, but he knows more about rowing
and coaching than the Kaiser and all his soldiers
put together. Despite Jimmy’s small tonnage, he
was a successful oarsman from 15 to 20 years ago,
and since then has set up a wonderful record as a
coach. Among the successful crews handled by him
were seven Victorian inter-State eights, beginning
in ’99 and ending in ’O7, and many of the Albert
Park champion crews. For years he was a
selector of Victorian crews, and is a vice-president
of the Victorian Rowing Association.

Teams of old-time Ilotham and Emerald
Hill footballers struggled on to the field at North
Melbourne last week and attempted a match for
the benefit of a cobber of the bygone days when
they weren’t short in the wind —Harry Todd, a
player of 30 years ago who has lost both arms
through a mining accident. Among them were Dick
Houston, Ernie Bean, Steve Rolent, Peter Burns, Billy
Windlev and “Sonny” Elms. On the line was ex-
M. Gardiner, who played away’ back in ’6B.
They were all in the worst of nick, but there was
fun in the game and cash for Harry, so it didnt

For old men who wish to survive until

Deep Breathing is the
Vital Force of Life
The Passport to Good Health.™
It is oxygen that gives the blood its sparkling redness—
the body its warmth and energy—that makes it possible
for the food we eat to be transformed into bone, muscle and
tissue.
Since it is the duty of the lungs to supply the blood with
oxygen, deep breathing should be the foundation of every
system of exercise.
A great majority of people are shallow chested —sufferers
from oxygen starvation—and yet they wonder why they
are fatigued, depressed, under weight—why their" vital
organs fail in their duty.
The deep-breathing exercises included in my
POSTAL COURSE of HEALTH
and STRENGTH CULTURE
are most modern, efficient and successful.
They build up weak chests by strengthening the lungs,
developing the muscles supporting the chest walls, broaden-
ing the shoulders, and making you breathe in a natural
way. _
The exercises you receive will be those most suitable for
your individual physique, just as the particulars you furnish

The State War Councils are finding flies
in their lemonade. A swarm of smalf busi-
nesses, largely fruit-emporia and lolly-
' places. °re buzzing about their ears, waving
balance-sheets and begging to be bought for
die poor returned soldiers. The returned
soldier has already had a shot at both games.
otably at the fruit-keeping, and usually he
has got out at the end of a month, leaving a
shop three-parts stocked with rotting produce,
and taking a blighted faith in human nature.
Now, knowing something of these happenings,
the War Councils begin to suspect that the
poor widow who wants to sell her sweet-shop
fittings, stock and goodwill (only £4O for

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the well=known Parisian Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, I
advise you to use a little mer-
colised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Rub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will find that
this will be the only “treat-
ment” necessary and .will keep
your face fresh and youthful-
looking for all your life. The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that yon have always a fair, fresh, com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
is
m

thing is a good shampoo. Never use any-
thing inferior to wash the hair with. Get
some good stallax from your chemist and use
a teaspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it will look bright.and
glossy.
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than it should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a little —what do you call
it? —stimulant, and for this 1
would advise you to get a packet
.of boranium and mix it with
some bay rum ; dab this into the
roots and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grow long and thick. Give your
hair a good brushing every night, and that
will be all that you need do.
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coining into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and • pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and the
skin is left smooth, soft and cool. This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or five days, to
ensure the permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why you
shotild have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay runt- Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered.
Wumeu annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol. obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: "-Che
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pic*
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise. sweating baths, etc., now puts a few
of these little brown berries in his or her
pocket and eats three or four each day.”
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat from
the body, but also correct the tendency,
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries are
not very well known in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

The Good Old
“PLUM.”
Journalist E. 11. Coombe, Labor M.L.A.
for Barossa (S.x\.), has three sons serving;
and a son-in-law is just off to do his bit.
“Copabella”: Many such are fakes, but
I can vouch for it that, speaking on a pro-
ject to present some token to departing
soldiers, our most patriotic councillor said
the town should certainly give the men some
lffohienthm of the occasion.
“Claret 0 ! A seafaring friend drew angry
words from a Sydney publican the other
night by pouring out a third mate’s nip for
which I had just paid Bung sixpence. We
cleared up the situation later by all having
another unnecessary drink at the sailor’s
expense; but the little experience showed
that the stupid old “help-yourself” days are
gone, and that we will soon adopt the Eng-
lish system and have our drinks measured
like our drapery. Nobody thinks the butcher
should push over the side of beef and invite
you to take what you think (or don’t think)
is a fair thing for half a crown.
Oiie of the speakers at the Anglican
Diocesan Synod, -sitting in Melbourne, pro-
vided what his brethren evidently regarded
as a frivolous turn the other day. He
moved, —“That the system of pew-rents is
detrimental to the welfare of the Church.”
(No applause.) “Why not," he demanded,
“turn the church into an auditorium, with
regularly-priced seats, and appoint the ReV.
Charles Chaplin as first pastor? (Pained
sniggers.) Three objectionable things had
been introduced in Australia from Great
Britain —rabbits, thistles and pew-rents’’
(Modified laughter and gasps of surprise,
the Synod probably asking itself what was
the objection to thistles).
“Sax,” from somewhere in Maoriland
A couple of years ago one mob of electors was
frantically voting to keep Ward out. The other mob
toiled hard to put Massey out. Now both Ward and
Massey are ill and appear to be running in double
harness with Complete understanding. If it isn’t
a permanent arrangement it looks like one. Apart
froth other considerations, Biff and Joe are too
fat these days to fight over the old bones
they worried iii days gone by, Meanwhile
Labor is Showing that it retains all the
intelligence it has previously shown in Maoriland
politics. Its programme is a yelp and a howl, fol-
lowed by the fierce bashing of things in general with
bladders of wind. Its organisation is as deplorable
as ever. There was a by-election the other day in an
electorate inhabited mainly by timber workers, small
farmers, agricultural and pastoral grafters and people
of that sort. There were 6500 names on the roll, and
the Labor vote was 1 in 27. A candidate who stood
in advocacy of State-aided prayer-meetings would
probably have got more support.
BeU Watkihs rose in the Speck Assembly
feUehtiy and asked Premier Lee if the Gov-
ernment intended td reduce the registration
fees payable by cdmfidfiies.-. At present, to
start with, there is a stamp duty of Id. for
each £1 of canital; and there is a registra-
tion fee on a sliding scale. An average-
sized concern has to pay altogether about
£5O. as compared with £2 17s. in Victoria.
Lee replied that the Speck got about £2OOO
a year out of these fees and the Government
couldn’t afford to lose that much assistance
towards keeping Cohen in his kennel. lie
didn’t think the Speck lost any new cos.
through these charges. Perhaps not; but
it is not the sort of encouragement the Speck
ought to be holding out to Australian in-
dustry, all the same.
The i war having stopped us from import-
ing Scientific instruments, surgical tools and
Such things from Germany, it has been found
that we can make them iu Australia. The
Felton-Grim Wade firm of Melbourne has
gone largely Into the business, and has dis-
covered that with a good demand it can put
the tilings 0U the market for iess than used
to be paid for the imported Stuff. That, how-
ever, doesn’t mean that a Stiff duty isn't
wanted, because it will pay the foreigner
well to sell for a while at almost any price
in order to kill the Australian baby. But
the news that we can make stuff for less
than the foreigner used to sell us his
stuff is good news, all the same. The
idea of making goods for an export trade is
mostly ridiculed now; and the “hopeless-
ness” of it is given as the reason why it
isn’t worth while establishing dozens of in-
dustries in Australia, the local market being
comparatively small. But why shouldn’t we
be able to make for export? The Yankee
does, and the Yankee pays his labor —his
skilled labor, at any rate —far higher wages
than are paid in Australia.
“Uncertificated” wants information :
I will caff it square with Holman if he will tell
me how to do it. Why can’t these methods that are
so successful with public affairs be applied to private
citizens’ budgets? 1 have a feeling that some glori-
ous specific is being withheld from me—-something
that will cause the hair to grow over the bald spot,
in 24 hours and remove the bunions in one applica-
tion. And why doesn’t he take his own medicine?
Holman as a family man needs money. Why doesn't
he knock off being Treasurer for a day or two and
make himself affluent? Why didn’t poor Lou Trefle,
who was a Holman Minister? As he had the secret
of becoming fatly prosperous, why did they have to
make a vote out of the public funds to his widow ?
“Exile”: For 50 years the Calumet and
Hecla, in Michigan (U.S.A.), has been
producing copper for the benefit of a number
of Boston families. Its dividends total
£26,450,000. This remarkable record has
been made on £240,000 capital. At one
period shares—-there are 100,000 —fell to
2s. 6d. They are now worth £lOB, and in
1007 they touched £2OO. Americans claim
this to be the highest price ever given for a
mining stock. But this is one of the lots
of things Americans don’t know. Away
back in 1887 T paid £407 for Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. shares. The finding of
copper on the Calumet and Hecla was a
fluke, like the cutting of bornite on the cart
track at North Lyell.
The Roma oil bore is down only 1380 ft.
after about 10 months’ work, and the cost
to date is £14,139. The State established for
itself a monopoly of the prospecting for oil,
and it looks like a big mistake. Had the
money already spent been voted for subsidis-
ing private wildcatting at 10s. a foot, it
would have accounted for probably 28,000 ft.
of probing. If this had not actually accom-
plished the discovery of oil, the country would
at least have been a lot wiser as to its
prospects.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos that recent paragraph
which suggested that the hangman and the
brute who swung the cat-o’-nine-tails have
always been social outcasts. In in.y half a
century's gathering of odds and ends is a
copy of the Sydney Gazette and New
South Wales Advertiser, “published by
authority, October 6, 1825.” In it appears
the following-
The poor man Walton, scourger in the town of
Parramatta, who was assaulted a few days ago, is
"recovering rapidly. Very charitable visits were paid
to his humble cot by several ladies and gentlemen of
Parramatta, and its vicinity. The benevolence of some
of these worthies was very remarkable, as this mal-
treated flogger was continually being honored with
joints and necks of mutton and other luxuries to
support him during his period of confinement. Such
charity is worthy of imitation.
As the Social Climbers of old Parramatta
handed in the neck of mutton they said:
“See, wo have no fear of the (logger’s arm.
Ali the world consists of those nobodies
whom it would (log and those somebodies
whom it wouldn’t. We are the patrons of
the flogger. He is on our side. We are
somebodies.” So the neck of mutton wasn’t
charity, after all. But it was incandescent
mutton: it threw a brilliant light on the
real nature of flogging—the most “class”
punishment that ever was invented.
Out of the trenches in the middle of the night
Jumped the Anzacs ready for a fight,
“Charge the devils! ” loud they cried,
And skill at footer they applied.
Onto the Huns —the terrible brutes —
They got in with guns and boots.
A kick in the waistcoat —a crack on the jaw:
That’s the end of a Hun for evermore.
A stick of a baynett, a twist and a pull,
Is a meal for a Hun that makes him feel full.

IN
BANANA LAND
P.risbane Labor Standard is advocating
that only men eligible for service should
vote on the Referendum. And, we presume,
only capitalists on the other question as to
the conscription of Avealth.
Premier Ryan is speaking out of his turn
again. He has announced that he thinks
Billjim in the trenches should get at least
the Australian minimum Avage, and he pro-
poses to bring the military pay of Queens-
landers up to that. Somebody had better
tell Ryan to mind his own business. Fight-
ing the Germans is the Commonwealth’s
affair; fighting the prickly pear is Ryan’s.
It will be quite time for Ryan to butt into
the Commomvealth’s job Avhen he has fin-
ished his oavu.
Laborites indignant with editor Buchanan,
of Brisbane Daily Mail, avlio strenuously
advocates conscription, point out in the
Assembly that the Mail is the property of
Messrs. Wren, Nathan and M.11.R. Sharpe
—all of whom are, or have been, identified
with the turf. But Murphy, of Croydon,
pricked the A'irtuous bladder by remarking
prettily that Labor’s OAvn official organ, the
Standard, avus launched with turf money
by one of the same trio.
Queensland Labor papers allege that 80
per cent, of the men at the Front are
unionists. Also they advise all Labor men
to vote against conscription, so that an
army 80 per cent, of which are good union-
ists may be sacrificed owing to a dearth of
reinforcements. This kind of talk makes
one fancy that the Labor croAvd must be
run by cunning capitalists Avho want to
wipe out as many unionists as possible.
“Dead Finish”: The only thing missing
from the goat races held in Western Banana-
land is a stipendiary steward, and the kind
of “bookie” Avho operates on the local popu-
lation sometimes wishes he wasn’t there
either. At a meeting field at Hughenden every-
one knew it avus a sure thing for Stinker.
A sovereign from the layer of the odds
squared the owner, and the fielder started
laying fair odds. Whereupon the OAvner
promptly got a cobber to invest the pound,
and as the liberated aroma romped home,
Bar Nothing was heard to moan, “There’s
only two goats on this course —me an
Stinker.” Next day he fled south, Avhere
there are mobs of goats, and he has been
shearing them ever since.
The youngest Judge on the English High
Court Bench is a Queenslander. He is
Justice Atkin, and was one of the five who
constituted the Court of Criminal Appeal
that decided against Roger Casement. His
father was a member of one of \ the early
Queensland Parliaments. Atkin was only
45 when he was made a Judge three years
ago. after a brilliant career in commercial
cases in the London Courts. He also shines
at golf. A brother-in-ermine, Justice
Peterson, is also an Australian by birth.
The “temperance” ladies have been _ at
Premier Ryan again over six o’clock closing.
Mrs. Williams assured him: “Really, Mr.
Premier, I’ll not be responsible for the
women of Queensland if something is not
done.” Finding that Ryan didn’t seem
afraid of the women, they next threatened
him with God —how could he expect to
answer to the Almighty for refusing a Refer-
endum? The man actually had the nerve
to say fie thought he would be able to jus-
tify himself. Woman and God having thus
failed, the only thing left seems to be to
threaten him with the Devil.
A Labor member entertained Bananaland
Assembly recently by quoting verses by one-
time Minister Peter Airey, entitled “Fight-
DISARMED.
“Wasn't there some scandal about her?"
“I never speak ill of a woman behind a back like that.”
ing by Proxy,” which appeared in The
Bulletin over 14 years ago. The verses
satirised the Fat Party, who, during the
Beer war, urged the common crowd to fight
while they themselves did a loaf. As the
Queensland Labor Party is doing all its
fighting by proxy-—not having sent one of
its members to the Front—it was able to
thoroughly enjoy the humor of the verses.
“Itan” : When the six o’clockers clamored
for a liquor referendum Bananaland Labor
produced the • Initiative and Referendum
Bill as the only means, though all the time
it knew that the House of Fossils was
an impassable barrier. In defence of their
attitude Ministers pointed nroudly to the
fact that the referendum had been a plank
on their platform for the past 25 years. But
when Billy Hughes proposed to ask the
Commonwealth what it thought of con-
scription there were noises like a German
grand opera.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 16, 1916.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,--
There was a meeting this week of the
committee which has been registering women
for war work. So far it has been placing-
voluntary helpers only; but now it is get-
ting ready to find paid women workers toi
light jobs, so that the wheels may be kept
turning. The meeting did a lot of talking,
but no particularly valuable suggestions
were forthcoming. None of those who
attended looked able-bodied enough to do
cargo dumping, nor sufficiently agile to
muster a mob of sheep, but all insisted that
if it comes to the worst they’ll take on
even those jobs.
Last Tuesday night liis Ex. officially
opened in Adelaide-street a new miniature
rifle range. The Gov., who is a keen shot,
has donated a Cup to be fired for by affili-
ated “miniature” clubs.
Mrs. Holman and Louise Mack, who have
been spending a few quiet days at Redclifte,
came up to town for the races. Is ext
Tuesday Mrs. Ryan will pass the sandwiches
at a tea in their honor in the Art Gallery.
Some of the most extraordinary glad rags
that ever fluttered on the Eagle Farm lawns
were paraded at the races to-day. Two
were a cross between ball-gown and dinner-
dress, and the inserted yokes and sleeves
threatened disaster at any moment.
The Residential Club for Returned Sol-
diers will be out of all its financial difficul-
ties by the time the “Queen” Carnival is
over. The Morgan dame, the “Charity Queen,”
scored heavily when one of the biggest city
caftis was offered to her committee for a
day. The upstairs room is to be reserved
for “invited” guests, who will all part up
half a crown. Downstairs the general
public will consume its usual bun and milk,
but all the takings are to go to the “Charity
Queen” fund.
Last Monday Mrs. Ryan, in the absence
of Lady Goold-Adams, opened the Japanese
tea-house, which the committee for the
“Citizens’ Queen” (Mrs. Hetberinffton) is
running in Market-square. This brewery
is crowded daily, and will remain open
another fortnight. .
Major Pendlebury auctioned a Belgian
flag in Lennon’s Lounge the other day, anc
raked in £2OO for the “Soldiers Queen’
(Mrs Lee). This sum represents 10,000
votes,’ so the lady and her committee are
beaming.
Killed in action in France, Capt. Bob
Chambers, son of. architect Claude
Chambers. The boy was in the famous
landing at Gallipoli, and won his captaincy
there. He was only 21 when an enemy
bullet cut short a promising career.
Lieut. Vivian Cooper, an old Brisbane
Grammar School boy and son of Mr. and
Mrs. P. E. S. Cooper (the lady is an ener-
getic patriotic worker), nas. been awaided
the D.S.O. in France. It will help to heal
a wound he is nursing in an English hos-
pital.
Charles Snell ing, a Rockhampton boy,
has been awarded the D.0.M., and _ pro-
moted to a star. Snelling, sen., is chairman
of the Rockhampton Patriotic Fund com-
mittee.
Fred Small, who left Australia with ,the
first contingent, and whose pluck carried
him from the ranks to a captaincy, has
sailed for England. He was invalided home,
and as he cannot do any more active service
work, he is to join Prof. Steele in a muni-
tions job. Small is a grandson of the
late Capt. Trouton, of Sydney.
Josephine Lewis, daughter of Brisbane
Telegraph Lewis, has just completed
another successful year at the Royal
Academv. This little Brisbane girl should
do big things. She lately composed a song
which Paul Dufault has added to his list.
Mildred Mackay, another Brisbane girl,
is also doing well at the Academy. Her
violin talked so appealingly that the certi-
ficate of merit (the highest Academy award)
was hers. •
Connie Moir, M.A., a Rockhaninton girl-
een, has sailed for England and will go into
residence at Girton. The lady holds the
travelling scholarship given annually by the
Orient S.S. Co. to a distinguished student
of Sydney Uni. She also holds the James
King* travelling scholarship, but the war
made that an empty honor.
Jean Darvall and her cousin Lydia Grant
sailed for England on Saturday. They are
the first two Queensland V.A.D.’s to be
chosen for work abroad.
Sugar-expert Desplace, a Mauritius man,
and one of the best in his line in Australia,
has two sons at the Front fighting for
France and Australia. Both boys have been
wounded, the first rather sevei*ely; but luck
has stood to him in the hospital and he is
now at the Front again. Both the boys
hail from Nudgee College, near Brisbane.
Dr. Marshall Allan, a Brisbaneite back
from Mesopotamia, says he found the Turk
a gentlemanly fighter. After a Turkish
aeroplane had accidentally dropped bombs
close to a British hospital, a message of
regret accompanied bj 7 a box of cigarettes
was thrown into the British lines. Dr.
Allan found that Australian girls stood the
Indian summer better than British nurses,
which, of course, is another evidence of
racial degeneration in Australia.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

SHOES are exquisitely cool and light in the
hottest weather, yet none of your dowdy,
canvas shoes either but smart, elegant, in
the fore-front of fashion. Most Australian
women will have sighed for such shoes, and here
they are in the latest shipment of Bostocks. The
model illustrated is delightful even in picture
form. But think of it in reality, a light, grace-
ful shoe of finest moire, built in that new, short-
fronted shape so thoroughly French, and made
with a dainty Louis heel. If ever there was
an ideal shoe for smart wear in hot weather, it
is certainly this one. Then for other tastes,
there are other shoes equally charming in this
Bostock selection. The shoes are unmistakable,
and have the name Bostock stamped on the soles.

One of. the Canadian war-chiefs was an
Illawarra (N.S.W.) boy. He left Sydney
with an Australian contingent to argue with
Kruger, and after gaining the D.S.O. went
to Canada. His correspondence at the
Western Front is now addressed to Lieut.-
Colonel P. Daley.
The charge against the couple was that
they had behaved by night in a public place
—to wit, Alexandra Gardens (Melb.) —in
a manner subversive to public morality. As
the female half, who conducted the defence,
explained it, they had merely sat in the
gardens beneath the stars, and, of course,
“if you go there with a gentleman, well,
naturally he starts pulling you about a bit.”
Which confirms this paper’s life-long impres-
sion that Joseph of Canaan was no gentle-
man.
The youngest of 45,224 females who took
unto themselves husbands in the Common-
wealth in 1915 was 13 and the patriarch of
her choice 22, while the oldest was a blush-
ing 75 who promised to adore a lad of SO.
Girls of 14, 16 and 21 wandered to the pit
and fell in with boys of 52, 56 and 71
respectively. In the Ma State maidens of
60 and 51 annexed husbands of 32 and 22.
From 21 to 22 was the most popular period
for matrimony with women, while 24 and
25 were the years in which the largest num-
ber of their victims were bagged.
“Hamer”: The war is having its say in
the film business. A film may have a Brit-
ish villain, and a Yankee or any neutral
person may stand for dark deeds, but only
a Britisher, Frenchman, Italian, Servian,
Jap or other Ally can represent virtue. An
American film was held up recently; then
the alteration of a name made it innocuous.
One of the black-hearted characters was a
Roumanian, and he had to be made some-
thing else —a German-American, or a Turk
or a Bulgarian. You see, if Roumania had
found out that a picture with a Roumanian
villain was being shown in Australia it
might have busted the new alliance.
“Uncle Sham”: Some entrancing things
come out of Chicago. My eyes are still
aching from the effects of a beautiful filmo-
drama written by a cultured American lady.
It is all about motherhood and the sin of
the Woman who Wouldn’t, and the gates
that open in the first scene to let the lovers
into “Loveland” after they have been shot
at by a real Cupid are used again in the
fifth scene as “Babyland,” with prize naked
infants kicking on water-lily leaves and
under bushes. Cupid in this scene acts as
guide to the grey-haired old lady who
wouldn’t have a baby when she was
young and beautiful, and so lost her
magnificent United States husband. When
the poor old thing gets back to her
lonely home Cupid leaves • her and a
skeleton appears and shows her happy
mothers in ordinary street dress taking their
children into a lovely picture-show heaven.
Then Death conducts her to a hell, and a
boss-devil is trying to drag her down when
she wrnkes up still young and beautiful in
her bridal boudoir with the preventive
untaken. After pouring the deadly stuff out
of the window she goes down to give the
beautiful picture-husband the good news
that Baby is on the way. I cordially
recommend the picture to all midwives.
Various hospitals and charitable institu-
tions in Shepparton (Vic.) are benefited by
recent “surprise” donations, totalling £101),
from Mr. and Mrs. Longstaff, parents of
painter “Jack.” The kindly old couple
(Longstaff senior is in his 92nd year) have,
on account of the war, thus preferred to give
rather than receive presents by way of cele-
brating their “diamond” wedding. They
deserve all the blessings that are being in-
voked on their heads.
“Eighteen-Pounder”: An artillery officer
strolling across the parade ground at
Maribyrnong camp (Vic.) found he had no
matches, so he hailed a passing gunner.
“Hey, lad ! Got any matches on you?” “Here,
sir,” said the gunner, and handed over a
box. The officer lit his pipe, gazed into the
sky, and absent-mindedly put the box in
his pocket. The gunner watched the pro-
ceedings sadly, but made no comment. The
officer looked at the lingering Samaritan
vacantly and ventured, “Looks like rain?”
Back came the answer: “Yes, but it ain’t
yoin ’ to rain matches!” He got his vestas
back.
Melbourne’s policewomen are to wear
plain clothes, according to Chief Sec.
McLeod, who has expressed the opinion
that women already have enough masculine
habits without coveting the policeman’s.
When the bobberina wants to announce her
authority she will flash out a little shiny
star of office (something neat in silver and
blue enamel, no doubt), just like the
stout officer does in “The Million-Dallar
Misery,” and the crowd wall fall back,
making obeisance. It works all right on
the stage, of course; but some sort of uni-
form may yet prove to be advisable, even
though innocent old Donald McLeod may
see no reason for it.
“Ananias”: The Manly ferry fleet named
by “T. 0.1.” is of recent date. In the ’7o’s
we wallowed down the harbor in the Bredal-
bane, Goolwa, Cobra and Phantom. The
three I named first were tugboats, and occa-
sionally used to go off the beat with a load of
passengers, sometimes as far as five miles
outside, to pick up a windjammer and tow her
in. The Goolwa was sold and went to New-
castle. The Phantom was the craziest tub
I ever saw; the deckhands used to have to
carry weights from one side of the ship to
the other when crossing the Heads to keep
her from upsetting.
“Bill Badd”: “Bad Australian” (B.
17/8/T6) puts up a rotten argument in
favor of the cigarette. He may be right in
saying that South Americans are the most
persistent fag-suckers in the world ; but can
lie dig up any South American world-beaters
at any game requiring sound lung power?
Ask any man engaged in preparing human
bodies for strenuous athletic tests, and you
will get the strength of it. I’m no wowser;
I kick solely because the Australian kid
would become a better citizen if he could be
prevented from feeding his lungs with
tobacco fumes instead of good Australian
air while his body is at its most important
stages of development. I know. I was
smoking at nine, and shall be a poor wilted
weed at 49.

that almost tear you to pieces—that make your head ache—your throat sore and
inflamed—the kind that rob you of your sleep till your system becomes so run down
that you are in grave danger of pneumonia or consumption, take
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy.
A dry, hacking cough is usually caused by an irritation of the
mucous membrane of the throat and bronchial tubes. Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy will allay this irritation and remove the cause.
When the cough is dry, loud and sonorous, it indicates a cold.
Take a double dose of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, bathe the feet in
hot water, take a cathartic and go to bed and you can cure a cold in
one night.
When the cough is spasmodicand long continued it indicates whoop-
ing cough. This is a dangerous disease unless properly treated. Keep
the cough loose and expectoration easy by giving Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy as required and all danger may be avoided.
A persistent cough often follows an attack of influenza and is usually
due to a roughness and irritation of the mucous membrane lining the
throat. Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy has proven very successful in
allaying this irritation and checking the cough.”
All retailers are authorised to sell Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy under a guarantee; if it does not
do all that we claim we will refund the price paid.

Heat This Summer Will Kill
Hundreds of Over-fat People!
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF
ITS VICTIMS?
Excess fat is a very serious matter. Over-fat people have but little chance
where normal people go scot-free. The only safe way is to get rid of your
excess fat. Thousands have done so. Why not you ?
“TI-SARKIN” reduces fat people to normal. It is harmless, safe to use,
prompt acting, and many people ha ve reported a loss of excess weight of
from four to five pounds a week, and even up to as much as a pound a day.
Let us send you a free sample. Try it for vourself. Sample post free upon
request. All Correspondence Confidential.
DON’T TAKE OUR WORD FOR WHAT “ TI-SARKIN ” WILL DO!
READ WHAT THOSE WHO HAVE USED IT SAY!
Manager, Slienton Street,
Watwortli Co., Claremont, W.A.
Hear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
endorsing your “Ti-Sarkin” as a perfect
fat-reducer. I have taken a course of your
treatment under your advice, and am
pleased to tell you that I am now reduced
to normal weight, and am enjoying perfect
physical comfort and perfect health.
Prior to using “Ti-Sarkin” I was any-
thing but comfortable, and my state of
health _ was not such that I could brag
about it. Now I have no cause for com-
plaint, and can with pleasure recommend
your treatment to anyone who suffers from
obesity.—Yours sincerely,
(5805) A. WRIGHT.
Mrs. C. SCHULTZ, of A]bury, writing,
says
“After being fat and uncomfortable for
years, your treatment lias reduced me won-
derfully. I have taken in my clothes lliree
times since starting its use.”
Mrs. L. JOYCE, of Adelong, writes:—
“During the six weeks I have been using

An Every Morning Holiday
Try a holiday
the Big Ben way—
an extra hour off
with pay every
morning all sum-
mer long.
For a little romp
with the kiddies, a
brisk walk, a smart
canter, time to potter
in the garden, or a
bit of practice at the
wickets.
“Outdoor play keeps the
doctor away” says Big Ben, so
set him for an hour earlier in
the morning for a full time
workday in which big things
are accomplished—for an hour’s
holiday to keep you fit.
Big Ben is seven inches tall,
well built, handsome, punctual.
He has a big, easily read dial—a
cheerful, deep toned voice—large, com- »
fortable winding keys—a light running
movement with watch-like escapement
—an alarm that calls steadily for five
minutes or intermittently for ten.
Big Ben undergoes a hundred inspec-
tions in the making and six rigid timing
tests before leaving the factory of the
Western Clock Co., La Salle, 111.,

It was that side of the house which has to
keep its eye on taxation that called for a
change in the Fairfax firm the other day.
Hitherto the S. M. Herald has been pub-
lished by John Fairfax and Sons —-“old
John” was the founder and “Mr. James,”
now nearly 82, is the last of the “sons.” The
business was last week transferred to a regis-
tered co., whose capital has been set at a com-
paratively modest £750,000, the shares being
all in the family and the management left
with “Mr. Janies” and the two sons. “Mr.
James” has been a partner in the business
just-on 61 years.
“Daylight”: One of the results of day-
light-saving in Britain is that Australia gets,
in a way, later news about the war. There
used to be 10 hours’ difference in time
between London and Melbourne or Sydney,
but now that they have put the clock for-
ward in London they have cut the difference
down to nine hours. Consequently things
that happen in London early on, say, Fri-
day afternoon now get here in time for the
Saturday morning newspapers, while under
the old times they could not have been used
till Monday morning. Or put it this way:
things timed to happen at midday by the
clock in London now happen really an hour
earlier, and give the message that hour extra
to get through.

“Hassan”: Malediction on these names
like Guillemont and Bazentin-le-Petite. A
thousand curses on the Carpathians, and a
murrain on Monasteryska, Czwxpwoffsky,
and all their cousins. If the sub-editors
could have their way the British would
now be taking Lens and Fins, and making
gallant advances on the Lys towards Zele,
Boom and Base. This is not all due to
patriotism, though subs, are as patriotic as
most men. The chief charm about these
names is that they go in the big type on the
bills. “Boom Taken” is possible; or ‘K)n
the Lys.” But you can’t get “Podhayozyki
Taken” or “Fight on Bystritza” into the
top line. Gorz was a good capture from
the sub-editorial view-point, but none of us
really cares twopence if Vladimir Volyn-
ski never falls, though we will welcome
Kovel. The latest frightfulness is Tran-
sylvania. It is impossible “for the bill,”
and only barely possible in double-column
headlines. Why couldn’t the Roumanians
have tackled Sofia?

“Full Point” : I was just reading my par.
(B. 24/8/’l6) about the limitations of the
skirted reporter when my worst anticipa-
tions were realised. The case was one in
which a mental defective had posed as
“September Morn” on a' Maoriland beach.
A male reporter whispered to Skirts, “That
case is coming on now!” Skirts seemed
puzzled, but, on hearing a policeman yell:
“All those except counsel and members of the
press will leave the court,” she picked up her
petticoats and pencils and, in an aura of
sunset blushes and a flash of lingerie, fled
like a frightened fawn.

CONTEMPORARY PORTRAITS: JAMES EDMOND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He grew up somehow, roaming loosely round,
Doing the job he found,
Until one day, to his amazed delight,
He found an imp within him wished to write;
And henceforth all his life was just a rage
Of filling page on page.
They found for him an office and a desk,
Wherein his imp grotesque
Grew sober ; from an empty continent,
Peopled with snarling tribes, in hatreds pent,
Creating with his grim magician’s pen
A Commonwealth of Men.
So from his inkpot he drew forth a fleet,
An army-corps complete;
He thought in continents, for he alone
Had got a continent that was his own
To think in; and he sowed therein the seed
Whence sprang the Anzac breed.
’Tis not the legend of his virile mind
That he will leave behind—
This unknown statesman throned within the gloom
Of his dim, dusty editorial room.
To me his finest and immortal part
Is his kind, human heart.
Yet when he leaves this spacious continent
For his proud monument,
Somehow I think that grim imp will survive
Through all eternity, chuckling, alive,
To dig God in the ribs on Judgment Day
In his old, kindly way!

w Helpful
Advice to
Nursing Mothers
MANY mothers would like to feed their
own children, but are denied the privilege
of doing so, because they have not suffi-
cient nourishment for them. The “Allenburys”
scientific system of Infant Feeding has provided
for all this. When a mother is partly able to
feed her baby she may give The “Allenburys” Milk
Food No. I for alternate feeds, so alike are the
natural and prepared food in this instance, and this
food should be continued until the weaning process
has been entirely completed. The mother herself
must be well nourished and to this end may partake
freely of the “Allenburys” DIET a partially pre-
digested milk and wheaten food, which like the
Milk Food No. 1, is instantly made ready for use
by simply adding boiling water only. After
childbirth the “Allenburys" DIET is surprisingly
helpful in maintaining the strength and producing
a good flow of rich milk.

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE yellow morning in a cloud of light
Came flooding all the hill-slopes with
its joy.
The birds and breezes woke to happy flight;
And you were but a girl and I a boy
Laughing defiance of the withered years
With all that wide bush music in our ears.
The long, red road ran westward through
the green—
Deep, dusty ruts with marks of wheel and
foot.
One height against the blue sky seemed to
lean
Full of strange rest and joy that peace made
mute.
The glad trees and the golden-silent hill
Clutched at our hearts, yet left us laughing
still.
Grey streaks of age in hair that once was
black
And wrinkles where the dimples used to
dwell!
Yet here this morn Time’s dial shade goes
back.
You won those wrinkles when you laughed
too well;
And now the broad, gay world on every
hand,
Knowing that laughter is the soul of truth,
In lavish bounty gives you back your youth.
That long, red road that I am wont to tread
Perchance has ground some dust into my
soul;
But here a cleansing glory, wonder-fed
u ith subtle magic, medicines me whole.
My world is not the dust. This living green
Makes me a king to reign beside my queen.
We two in this enraptured yellow world,
The morning’s sweetness in our happy veins,
W atching the smoke of faint wood-fires up-
curled,
Can mock the wheels that are the world’s
small gains
For all that age-grey wealth of sacrifice
That blots the heart and clouds the weary
eyes.
Down that red road youth goes with eager
stride;
Dust in his nostrils seems the breath of
hope.
The city lies beyond in rags and pride—
Dust-heaps where high adventure loves to
grope—
While here the bright heroics of the sun
In epic measure by the world are spun.
Dear heart, I think we should be ever
young
If no red road knew our returning feet.
Here where the wealth of life is lightly
flung
In Time’s bleak face, and cold and summer
heat
But add the zest of change to quiet davs—
Lreen rain and crystal wind and noontide
haze.
Death could not harm us here. If we should
fail,
Drop a faint hand and pass with one long
vc- Slgh ’
Weary of play, to sink in sleep as pale
As the white morning mist, we should not
die,
But with our brothers of the wind move
free
As part of this eternal pageantry.
Yet the red road with an insistent voice
Hemands our feet and at its call we go.
Its ruts are fate that knows no word of
choice ;
And w'e must watch grey hair and wrinkles
_ grow
While from the dull, set music of the wheel
Uur rebel hearts ache out their wild appeal.

Bonnie of Our Area.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BONNIE of our Area is a treasure to
others, but a special sweetheart
belong-it mine. Indeed, she might be
described as Lawson’s Best Girl. I fancy it
was a case of love at first sight, as far as
Bonnie was concerned. But don’t, whatever
you do, hint in her presence that I said so;
for she would resent the insinuation with
indignation, and perhaps seem to sulk for
quite a minute, as far as it is in her nature
® wem t° sulk. And it’s not nice to see a
nttle lady like Bonnie even pretend to sulk
ij ?° ore isn to her nature. Besides, it
wou.d hurt her, and Bonnie with her feelings
•Iv is P ainful proposition to anybody
u V \ i a H e art. Moreover, she would pro-
oably dislike you ever afterwards, and even
a pretence of Bonnie’s dislike is uncomfort-
able for the object of it.
I am not even sure whether Bonnie didn’t
projiose first. But, whatever you do, never
you mention that within the possible hear-
ing ot Bonnie, whether awake or seemingly
asleep—she is painfully quick. Nor in the
possible hearing of any of her relatives,
mends, acquaintances or neighbors—people
miist talk. Far better not mention it at all
lat s the safest. You know what
a young lady in love is. It might put my
pot on for a period, and it would certainly
put yours on for all time.
Bonnie was asleep when I first made her
acquaintance—or at least when I first didn’t.

“The TTvn Sht -V fr ?, m a Picture-show (it was
The Hypocrites, and she didn’t approve of

her mther a weight during the last half-mile.

ment, he d done a long, hard Saturday
morning s work, and walked home.
home two or three visits later, Bonnie
who has possibly been consulting or listen-
ing to some interested friends of mine, and
comparing tlieir opinions with her own ex-
perience, told me that I was a Good Man,
and she liked me. This information came
quite refreshing, for I had only that morning
received letters from three different persons
who seemed to entertain a decidedly opposite
opinion, and one of them at least went so
far as to say “if the account is not settled
at once we will have to place the affair out
of our hands.” But all this has nothing to
do with Bonnie.
She is Bonnie by nature as well as by
name; Bonnie in face and in figure, and, like
most of her sex, a coquette. But not to any
great extent. She couldn’t be. She is
always extremely anxious for me to see any-
thing new she has on. Some weeks back
“Gr&nny” arrived, unexpected like, and there
was a windfall. A week or so after, Bonnie
was eager to let me see her in her new cloak,
gaiters and boots; but the boots had been
sent back to Sydney the day I came, to be
changed, and mother was shortening the
cloak. But Bonnie was in such a hurry she
couldn’t wait on the conventionalities, so she
appeared in the kitchen to receive me in a
very red pair of woollen gaiters, and nothing
else to speak of.
And, some weeks before, Bonnie was very
anxious to show me a new pair of red com-
binations mother had made for her. Now, it
was during the hot weather, and as Bonnie’s
single outer garment was transparent, and
as much of Bonnie was generally on view as
could be seen, she need scarcely have taken
the trouble to kilt her petticoat up to the
knee, whilst stepping over a three-inch
puddle in the yard—especially as the sun-
light was behind her. But as Bonnie was
two and a half and little over two feet and
a half at the time, all this passed for
nothing. She is two years and nine months
old and two feet eleven inches now, and
noticeably more circumspect, not to say
prudish ; but. then, she is Scottish.
Bonnie early showed me the family por-
traits, groups and old homes on both sides,
taking them loosely from the bottom of the
sideboard, and frankly dropping those she
didn’t think much of on the mat —for Jeames
or somebody to pick up afterwards, like a
lady to the manner born.
I don’t suppose there’s anything I could
do in her presence that Bonnie would dis-
approve of. The other night I was squat-
ting, rudely or absent-mindedly, close to the
fire, before the legs of one or two of the
others, when Bonnie remarked, “You ain’t
afraid of the fire, are you?” She early gave
me to understand, in strict confidence, that
she’d go to the end of the world with me,
provided I meeted her father or bringed her
home again. The end of Bonnie’s “world”
is a row of pines on the nearer rim or hori-
zon of the red-soil plain, through which Jim
drove wearily home, against sunset, in his
sulky, from his work out along the Hay
Canal last summer. On this great occasion
Bonnie commented flowingly and freely on
passing homes, people, horses, dogs, poultry,
stock and scenery, probably with an idea of
keeping me well informed. But it didn’t
seem to matter to her whether I heard or no
—a peculiarity by no means confined to
Bonnies.
One morning I went down to Bonnie’s
place and found that someone had given
them a very fat, round, foolish cattle pup,
and the pup was helplessly asleep in a
corner of the verandah. Bonnie was trying
with all her might to get his foolish head on
a little block of wood she had. “Put your
head on the piller,” she said. The pup
opened one eye and made a ridiculous
attempt to thump his tail on the floor. I’d
left my boots at the edge of the verandah, on
account of the gluey clay on them, and now
I softly stooped over Bonnie with the in-
tention of helping her, and heard her say to
the pup, evidently in continuance of a con-
versation or monologue that had made him
sleepy: “Sometimes I call him Mr. Lawson,
and sometimes I call him Uncle_ Harry—but
I don’t know if he is my Uncle Harry or
not.” Then she was aware of my shadow,
and stooped lower and became perfectly still;
and I knew she had all the fingers of one
hand in her mouth, as is her way when she is
embarrassed or “hurt.” Others might think
she is sulking, but I know her better.
Bonnie knows neither sulkiness nor shy-
ness. I picked her up as usual, and kissed
her, and asked her where mother was. She
told me mother was in the kitchen, and
Peter, the old family horse, had “fallyed”
down coming home last night and broke the
shaft.
You see, we both have tact. It was the
morning after a night before that Jim and I
had shared together, and I had come down
early after a much-needed reviver; also my
pipe and half a cake of tobacco that I had
left there. Provident little Mrs. Grahame
had —as I knew she would have— : a stiff nip
saved for me; also a couple of nips in
a bottle to take home. Bonnie, who had
been listening, went into the parlor and
brought out my pipe and a full cake of
tobacco belonging to her father, both of
which she put in my coat-pocket. Then
she went out the back, and, while her
mother was at the front door, interview-
ing the baker, to my very great surprise
she brought in a small flask about two-
thirds full, which she finded in the shed
behind old Peter’s feed-box, and she insisted
on climbing up and putting it, with both
hands, in my inside coat-pocket. You know,
by this time, how I hate hurting' Bonnie’s
feelings, so I let it stop there. Besides, I
knew I’d meet Jim during the day. I met
him, a mile or two out, on his way home for
a nip, too. I gave him one out of my lawful
mateship bottle, and had the other myself;
and then we lit up and sat down on a iog by
the wayside for a mutual Bush think. Pre-
sently I casually produced the other flask
which Bonnie had finded behind old Peter’s
feed-box; and Jim and I shook hands on it,
silently but feveredly. Being warmed up, and
grateful and truthful, Jim insisted on my
taking more than my share because he said
he had a drop planted behind old Peter’s
feed-box that he’d meant to tell me
about, but I told him he’d better have
another half-nip as he mightn’t find that
plant when lie got home—old Peter might
have knocked it over and trodden on it or
something. Perhaps Jim thought I meant it
for a joke: but I knew he’d find it no ioke
when ho got home.

Anyway, being old Bush mates, we were
never puzzled by each other’s manner; or,
if we were, we never showed it. We always
reckoned the thing would explain itself later
on. And if Jim did happen to be vaguely
puzzled by something in my manner that day
the thing is explained now.
Bonnie’s most dangerous rival is Nona
Halliwell, three years old, and one of a
large family of children with the most haunt-
ing eyes I ever saw in child faces. Their
father, an electrical engineer of three cam-
paigns, has gone to the war. The other
night, by the fireside, with the children about
us, Nona, her elbows on my knees, her face
thrown back, and two great, pale, blind-
seeming, but by no means blind, grey eyes
(such as I’d only seen once before, and then
in the face of a fair Italian) turned up to
me—they always seem turned up to you —
offered me a tiny white feather. Parental
explanations were that Nona had got an im-
perfect idea that it was the correct thing for
a lady to present a white feather to a gentle-
man she admired ; but there was something
questioning and yet not questioning, plead-
ing yet not pleading, asking yet not seeming
to wait for or expect an answer, in those
eyes that closed slowly, and as slowly opened
in blinking, that I could not understand —or
could not describe now if I did.
(I am reminded here of another and much
larger white feather which was given to a
mere boy by another young lady—by no
means so young and guileless as Nona-—and
it was warm and very rfd when they ripped
open his tunic. There are many on our
Area who have gone through, two or three
struggles or more and two or three failures
or more, and are wearing next their hearts
the bravest white feathers ever worn in the
Commonwealth.)
Next morning I happened to tell Mrs.
Grahame about Nona in Bonnie’s hearing;
and my sweetheart spent the rest of the
forenoon running between the fowlhouse and
the kitchen bringing me the biggest white
feathers she could find.
I have written bitter things, but let them
be forgotten for a while, for the bitterness
has gone out of my heart to-night because of
the purest love gift that ever was given to
me. And this is not written in the role of
sentimental relief here to-day and to-night,
while thousands of miles away thousands of
sentimental things are searched for and
found every hour on the bodies of our dead,
and portraits of mothers, wives, daughters
and sweethearts are taken out for a last look
ere the eyes glaze, or found on the muddy,
bloody battlefield and carefully washed and
dried. But when on the field of peace or
war I am finally conscripted, there will be
found amongst my belongings—very few by
that time, I suppose—the portrait of a child
who believed I was everything I should have
been, and three draggled feathers from the
wing of an old white hen.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Curious Oversight of
Levi Long.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LEVI LONG held many thousands of
acres of cutting rights at Big Bush,
and his mill was practically a perma-
nent institution. He was a large, dark,
self-contained stranger. Which is not to say
he was a new-comer at Big Bush. He had
been established there for three and a half
years, but he was the sort of man who would
be still a stranger in twenty years.
He lived alone in a small skillion built of
waste close by the mill, and it was early on
a summer Monday when he went across to
fire up that he found It. It was bedded
down in the sawdust, sleeping as happily as
if on its mother’s breast.
It was a female human baby, aged, possi-
bly, six months; a hearty, healthy, amiable
baby which, when Levi Long took it in his
arms after he had looked down upon it in
motionless amazement for three minutes,
crowed in his face, and buried a dimpled fist
in his abounding whiskers.
“Well, well, well!” said Levi, and he sat
on a log, and continued gazing at his aston-
ishing discovery, so absorbed in the wonder
of it that the firebox was still cold when
Carlton, the engine-driver, arrived.
Long’s mill at Big Bush was one of the
seven last places in which you would expect
to stumble upon a discarded infant. Big
Bush was sparsely settled for miles around,
and when the full strength of the company
had been made aware of Levi Long’s dis-
covery, and had given a full day to weighty
consideration of the possibilities, no sugges-
tions were forthcoming that threw any
manner of light on the matter. Obviously
somebody—a woman for choice —had bedded
the baby down in the warm sawdust of
Levi’s mill, and had gone away. That was
all there was to it.
Nobody dreamed of assuming that Long
had come by the baby in any way but the
manner simply described by him, for the
reason that the man cared so little about
anybody’s opinion that it was not for a
moment considered probable that he would
go out of his way to lie about a bit of a
baby.
More curious than his finding of the child
was the way he took to It. There had been
no suggestion of his parting with his find.
He gave it into the care of Mrs. Hamer at
Carpet Flat while the building of a more
commodious house was hastened on; then he
established Mrs. Hamer as his housekeeper,
and practically devoted his spare time to It.
It was never called anything but It at Big
Bush, although Levi went to some trouble to
give the child a legal title.
Levi went about many of his duties with
the kicking kiddie tucked under one arm.
He would sit and nurse it for hours. The
sight of its tiny, pink, dimpled fist lying in
his huge timber-stained palm drove him into
a sort of ecstasy that expressed itself in
tender blasphemy.
]Sfovcr had a child a JondcL lathoi, novel
was a fond father more beloved by an imperi-
ous and exacting infant. But as kiddies grow,
certain quaint and curious qualities drop
from them. Levi missed something when It
began racing round and finding other inter-
ests in life.
One day the millman went to Melbourne.
He returned the next afternoon. The buna e
he put down on the kitchen table before Alia*
Hamer’s astonished eyes contained a baby.
“Well, It gave me a taste for em, said
Levi, feeling himself on the defensive.
The second acquisition was a boy. ne
was known as Him about Big Bush, and
Levi was just as devoted a foster father to
Him as he had been to It. A
In three years Him had developed beyon
the most appealing stage, and Mrs. Hamer
noticed the growing yearning upon lawi
Long. The man was betraying again some
of the characteristics of a broody lien. J-aen
there came a day when he packed his poi
manteau, with an expression of grim resolu-
tion that she could not mistake.
Mrs. Hamer blocked him in the doorway.
“Where are vou goin’, Levi t” said she.
“I was thinkin’ of a little run up to Mel-
bourne,” Levi replied.
“And for what, might I ask i
Levi shuffled awkwardly; his eyes vacil-
lated. “Well, I been tliinkin’ the boy s
growin’ up, and sort of lookin’ after himselt,
and —and”
“Levi, you’re going to Melbourne foi
another baby.” „
“Well, you see, I’ve got the habit of em.
“Levi Long”—the widow was flushed up
to the eyes, her face was stern, her figure
very resolute —“all I’ve got to say is that the
man who goes eighty-nine miles tor his
babies is a stupid.”
A light came to Levi. He set down his
portmanteau, and looked at the widow, and
the widow was plump, 36, and good to look
UP “Blarst my eyes!” he said. “Fancy me
not tliinkin’ of that!” .
Mrs. Levi Long’s first were twins, and
Levi, with one on each arm, gazing at the
little lot with a novel exhilaration, laughed
“Fancy me not thinkin’ of that!” he re-
peated.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SHALL turn from the town one day
With its tainted pleasure and joy,
And “A fig for the years!” I’ll say,
And I’ll borrow the heart of a boy.
I shall leave the city behind,
With its troubles that come in shea\es,
my cares I’ll cast to the wind,
As the Autumn casts her leaves.
Oh, the heart of the boy in my breast
It shall shout with a song that thrills,
And ’tis I shall be merry and blest,
As I wander away to the hills.
With the trend of the sun or a star
To be guide ’mid the ’wildenng trees,
I shall leave the mapped city afar
With its shops, and its ships, and its
quays.
With a blanket or two in my pack
And a pipe, brown and sweet, m my
mouth,
I shall follow a ridge without track
That runs east for a while and then
south.
With a tune giving time to my feet—
Now a song, and a whistle anon —•
I shall laugh at the cold and the heat,
And the boy’s heart shall carry me on.
To a place known of old I shall go,
Ami alone, all alone, I shall roam
Where the soul for a season may know
All the sweetness of Nature at home.
'Tis my trust that (the dust and the dirt
Of the town, with its noise and alarm,
Having left fne with senses alert)
I shall thrill to her music and charm.
In a glamor of gold I shall wake
To her splendor and freshness dew-
pearled,
And shall lose the whole world tor her
sake — . ~
Count of time and the things of the
world.
I shall see (as a dreamer who sleeps
And is thrilled with a vision of grace)
All her glooms golden lanced, and her
deeps
Where the fronds of her ferns interlace.
I shall seek a mossed log for my seat
By a tree with a fern-fronded crown,
And the ankle-deep leaves at my feet
Shall be soft as a cushion of dow r n.
And it may be a lyre-bird will deign
To come forth from the green gloom
awhile,
Or a bell bird, when evening lights Avane,
Chime his notes through the forested
aisle.
Oh, at night when the hawking-birds quest.
And the thrush and the reed-bird are
dumb,
There’s a fairy awakes from her rest;
For the hour of her magic has come.
When there’s never the breath of a breeze,
And the fireflies all glittering throng,
It is she Avho awakes all the trees
With her prattle and gossip and song.
’Tis her pleasure, her mission, to walk
With the night in the depth of the dells —
She the talker of musical talk,
And the ringer of magical bells.
As the white mist gathers and floats
Like a wraith from tree to tree,
All the charm of her chiming notes
Shall be silver and gold to me.
And they’ll ring so pure, so pure,
And they’ll sound so nigh, so nigh,
That ’tis crazed I’ll grow, for sure,
As I rise in the dark and cry:
“Oh. you, with the laugh and the song.
Will you come from your hiding place?—
I have hearkened and hearkened so long,
I am Avild for a sight of your face.”
