SHAPING TODAY'S LIVING WITH ALUMINIUM


Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
’63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy - yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

You’re moving interstate
So who wants to pay to move an empty van?
You’re shifting to, say, Alice Springs.
Now, unless the removalist who quoted for your
move has a branch in that distant place,- his
quote will have to include the expense of get-
ting the empty van back to Melbourne or
Sydney or wherever you moved from.
Not with Wridgways.
Wridgways have the largest network of branches
of any removalist in Australia. Name a place. If
Wridgways don’t have a branch there, at least
it’s on one of their many scheduled routes.
So you never pay to move an empty van. By
back-shipment of goods, Wridgways make sure
every van is full —at no extra cost to anyone.
And, because Wridgways operate scheduled
services, you never have to wait for a big van
to be filled; you move when you want to move.
Almost as fast as moving by air. And whoever
heard of paying to fly an empty airplane back
to base?

‘PERSONAL
STORAGE
can save
you money
To replace furniture costs money.
To store it is much more economical
than you might think.
So if you’re temporarily without
housing after selling, while build-
ing, overseas or for any other reason
think about storing your belong-
ings.
Wridgways offer Australia’s largest

And at Wridgways it’s Personal
Storage because it’s locked con-
tainer storage. This means that all
your goods are sealed in individual
containers. Well packed. Dust free.
Moth and mildew free. Free from

And private.
You won’t find storage quite this

Apres le ski
it's the Tyrolean
mini-skirts
HERE IN VICTORIA we have always
been slightly jealous of those flash ski
resorts in N.S.W. We have heard
rumors of the plush life at Thredbo,
three-million-dollar hotel, deep pile
w.-to-w. carps., padded bars, chan-
deliers, discotheques, and is it true
that a chap in a red jacket meets you
at the door and carries your superb
luggage (shudder, not your kitbag) to
your suite?
Well, just to give an excuse for our
wretched backwardness in non-
chandelier-providing, our resorts have
always been in the care of Government
institutions, whereas N.S.W. has handed
over the development to private enter-
prise. Just to illustrate the curious
nature of things, Mt. Buffer is con-
trolled by the Forestry Department, Mt.
Hotham is run by a committee from
the Land Department, Faffs Creek
belongs to the State Electricity Com-
mission, and Mt. Buffalo, really, is
under the care of the railways. As local
skiers so frequently suggest: “What a
pity the Tramways Board hasn’t a ski
run.”
But things are changing very quickly,
and this year remarkable efforts have
been made to woo skiers out of
N.S.W. This week your correspondent
carried out a serious investigation at
Falls Creek. Now Faffs Creek is in the
North-East of Victoria, 230 miles from
Melbourne, and it is our number two
resort, 1300 beds, compared with about
5000 at Buffer. Ah, but it is well-
situated to compete with Thredbo, and
it is the nearest snowfield to Adelaide.
Right now it is expanding at a
phenomenal rate.
You will appreciate that apres ski is
terribly important on the snowfields. It
is a strange phenomena. You don’t hear
of apres yachting, apres water-skiing,
apres hiking, apres football, and, thank
God, apres cricket is totally non-
existent. But skiing resorts these times,
if they are to get on, must have lots
of apres. Faffs Creek, until now, has
been homely with little nightlife.
Last weekend as a major step in the
battle of the fields, there was the open-
ing of a first-class restaurant. The P.R.
department felt a major killing had
been made because the Prime Minister,
no less, accepted an invitation to for-
mally open it. Alas, General Maxwell
Taylor arrived a day late in Canberra,
Mr. Holt cancelled at the last moment,
and the job was done by the Minister
for National Development, Mr. Fair-
bairn.
This restaurant, owned by Julian
Newton Brown, is called Big Julian’s.
Originally he wanted to call it, more
simply, Julian’s, but that name was
already registered, so he had to add
the “Big.” It is on three levels down
the side of the mountain, and inside it
is rugged with massive overhead beams.
In the old days on the mountain
you’d depend on frankfurts and Wyn-
vale flagons. Now it’s carpetbag steaks,
and a wine list like the Florentino.
The difference between Buffer and
Faffs Creek is this: Buffer is only about
160 miles from Melbourne and is a
weekend resort and hence has a
majority of private lodges. Faffs Creek
is a come-for-a-week mountain and has
a majority of commercial lodges.
Admittedly there is a devoted band
that every Friday tears out of the office
at 5 p.m., battles up the Hume High-
way, gets into Faffs Creek about 2 a.m.
Saturday, skis all Saturday, all Sunday,
returns home before dawn Monday,
then dozes gently at the office all the
week, getting ready for the next
assault, but it is in a minority.
Your correspondent stayed at a
commercial lodge called Koki, and an
account of events there would be use-
ful to describe life at Faffs Creek.
Here you get your private shower and
lavatory and the charge, all in, is $l2
a day. Girls in black stockings and red
Tyrolean mini-skirts (you know Tyro-
lean minis, of course) wait on the
tables, and for the apres deal they
depend heavily on night-time folk-
My doctor told me I needed a break—
so I went skiing

From $59.50.
If you want to take good pictures,
without fuss or bother, and you want
the bonus of being proud of your
investment you want a new Kodak
Retina camera. Here’s why:
The Kodak Retina SI camera features
a new easy-load system using standard
35mm magazines, fast 'reverse gear'
rewinding, a built-in ‘weather dial' for
correct exposures, an automatic flash
system (using flashcubes), a sharp
colour-corrected 45mm Schneider f/2.8
lens, and a 4-speed Kodak shutter
up to l/250th sec. $59.50 (with case).
The Kodak Retina S 2 has all these
refinements plus electric-eye exposure
control. $86.00 (with case).
Let your Kodak dealer show you how
easy they are to use and how easy they
are to own.

singing and gargantuan meals. For
example, they have Tom Jones nights.
These are inspired by the film, rather
than the book. There is no cutlery
supplied. On the table are flasks of
wine, plates of chicken, pork ribs, corn
cobs, spuds, all that sort of thing. After
a time one becomes readily skilled at
cutting the butter with one’s finger.
One wouldn’t like to suggest that
guests would ever be as skilled at
apres anything as Mr. Tom Jones him-
self, but it is fun to gnaw a bone.
To get back to N.S.W. wooing,
N.S.W. cars outnumbered Victorian
cars in the car park and at Koki alien
Sydney people outnumbered us Vic-
torians three to one. The co-owner of
Koki is a young Sydney businessman,
George Shilling. He gave two reasons
why Sydney people were going all the
way to Victoria. (1) Thredbo and
other N.S.W. resorts were becoming too
sophisticated. (2) The skiing at Falls
Creek was better..
He said: “You can work this out on
a very simple ratio the lift capacity
to the number of beds available on the
mountain. There are 1300 beds and
four major ski tows. This is forgetting
the small beginners’ poma. All right.
If you add up the capacity of these
four tows you get a total of 2159 an
hour. You have almost double your
bed capacity. This is by far the best in
Australia. At Thredbo the ratio is the
other way, beds outnumbering lift
capacity. The result is that here you
don’t get great queues at the bottom of
your bars.”
At Falls Creek you can drive right
into the alpine village, and there, for
the price of one dollar, a heated tracked
vehicle takes you, bags and all, to your
lodge. No horrid walking. And, as
alpine villages go, it is very beautiful.
It is no longer easy to get a site
for a private lodge, but some of those
already there are very fancy indeed.
Take the lodge of Mr. Keith Hyland.
He deals in feathers and he lives in
Bangkok.
First he built his lodge in Thailand,
made sure it was exactly as he wanted,
dismantled it, shipped it to Falls Creek,
and rebuilt it. Can you imagine a
Thai ski lodge? It has a roof in pink
tiles, it has upturned dragon tails, and
it has little brass bells, tinkling in the
frigid alpine breeze, no doubt warding
off all sorts of evil apres-ski spirits.
So your prejudiced observer feels that
Falls Creek is becoming the most
cosmopolitan and is now the most
promising of the resorts. Regrettably
there is no space to cover the brilliance
of this year’s fashions, both ski and
apres. However, one notices a simple
rule that might serve you as a guide. The
ladies and gentlemen that are wildly
Tyrol, spectacularly tight-panted and
brilliantly pure new wool, are inevitably
up for their first season. The characters
in the dull colors, in the tatty old
jumpers and beanies, mostly ski for
Australia. So there’s the drum, apres
everybody, it’s in to be slightly drab.

EROTIC? The Two Decades of Ameri-

ator Daniel Thomas stops picking up
cigarette ends from the floor and says
he can only think Sydney Alderman
Moran means Larry River’s “Parts of
the Body” picture, which is no more
than a word lesson of what’s what of
the anatomy in French. No. Zippy is
more like it. A much more accurate
description. He retrieves another filter
butt, he hopes he’s not going to be doing
this all evening, but with this after-
noon’s lot of public flushed out he is
preparing for the next: the offiical
opening, after 16,000 people have seen
the $6 million exhibition, by His Excel-
lency Mr. Edward Clark, United States
Ambassador to Australia. Mr. Clark
couldn’t oblige earlier.
Five hundred or so Gallery members
are invited by way of a patriotic red-
white-and-blue stars-and-stripes card.
Champagne and sandwiches. What a
surprise! Lovely. Five hundred plastic
coathangers are provided, too, but any-
one leaving a coat freezes. There is no
heating. There was a time when the
Gallery had no lighting. Once, says Mr.
Thomas, they took royalty round on
a dark day by matchlight; before his
arrival, of course. This is the oldest
temporary building in Sydney well,
it was built in 1884 and is still unfin-
ished. He says the day we voted that
Liberal lot in was the day Sydney said
goodbye to the Gallery’s extension.
Good heavens! Mr. Thomas can’t
believe his ears. “La Paloma” swells
through the Gallery. A tango. Who on
earth chose that? It’s certainly not his
kind of music.
Mr. Edward Clark sits on the dais
and everyone’s waiting for him to do
something expansive. He has his fans,
of course. Several distinguished people
say that Mr. Clark’s folksy act is all
a cover and when he does what he does
in public it’s to hide much deeper
things. So here they all stand, juggling
champagne, sandwiches with one-dollar
catalogues—they’ll look marvellous on
coffee-tables faces upturned, hoping
Mr. Clark will oblige. He recognises a
face, points to a cigar in his breast
pocket and grins. Mrs. Clark looks
withdrawn. “This exhibition is an oppor-

tunity for Australians to get right where
the shouting is loudest in the American
art world,” he says. “It’s art that brings
people together, politics that separate.”
And mentions receiving a telegram on
his sixtieth birthday from an Australian
gal saying she wouldn’t trade him for
two thirties. Love that. “Vogue” editor
Sheila Scotter says afterward it was
she.
It’s taken a decade of hard work to
get this exhibition to Sydney. Despite
the “dont (no apostrophe, calligraph,
i.e., nouveau ) touch” notices, people are
touching. Artists do it when they see
new textures—ah! there’s another one—
they can’t resist it. Mr. Thomas twitches
at every outstretched hand. And Rein-
hardt’s three black abstracts are roped
off (in New York people attacked them
with umbrellas) and Ed Clark peers at
them. Leslie Walford listed as interior
decorator and now turned newspaper
columnist (oh, Peter Hanlon the hair-
dresser is here, too, identifying coiffures
for his new column) asks: “What do
you think of them, Your Excellency?”
Ed Clark drawls so low Mr. Walford
must incline his head to H.E.’s mouth
for the answer: he can’t understand ’em.
People surge round the Gallery’s
courts, some in evening clothes, mostly
not. A couple of men wear attic-arty
sponge-bag pants and goatee beards.
The French Ambassador, His Excellency
Monsieur Andre Favereau, is here in
tartan waistcoat. Why not? he asks.
He’s got Scottish ancestors. A bottle
cork explodes and Sam Francis’
Black in Red lent by the Museum
of Modern Art, New York, becomes
“Black in Red under a soupcan of
champagne.” Mr. and Mrs. Clark dis-
appear, someone thinks to the Board-
room. They’re not seen again. Every-
one’s being witty and the Ladies’ Page
reporters jot it all down. Amusing
things they’ve said about the “Camp-
bell Soup” picture, I Love You With
My Ford, that made M-Maybe pop
thing, and George Went Swimming
At Barnes Hole but It Got Too Cold.
It isn’t so difficult. Sydney has never,
everyone keeps saying, seen anything
like this exhibition before. The Press
give it Box Office Sell-Out space. Col-
umns and columns of exposure. One
newspaper reproduces a painting upside
down and the public accuse the Gal-
lery of hanging it the wrong way. Well,
they read it in the paper. An art critic
describes Blue Red vice versa in his
piece. He hopes the Gallery under-
stands. It wasn’t intentional.
Actually, the exhibition, big though
it is with every picture measuring 70
by 80 inches or so, does not quite fill
the ground floor. Standing in the last
court is a bath chair. On it a plaque
saying “IN MEMORY OF E. A.
BOOTHE, Artist, Hon. Sec. Centres
for Soldiers Wives and Mothers, N.S.W.
World War I and World War II.” It’s
in excellent working order, with reclin-
ing back, equipped so it can be pushed
or self-propelled by the occupant.

gentsia here tonight just called it

MARION RAYMOND'S
COOKBOOK
"Leave a
mushroom beside
the bed..."
I WAS BORN in Europe and lived
there as a small child. One of my most
vivid memories is of following the wild
pigs on my grandfather’s estate. They
had rings through their snouts and
hunted under the pine trees for truffles.
I don’t know who squealed louder when
they found one —the pigs or me.
I used to complain to my mother that
it really wasn’t fair for pigs to find the
truffles and never be allowed to eat
one. But, she assured me, occasionally
they did get one —otherwise even they
would be smart enough to stop looking
for them.
Truffles, unfortunately, don’t grow in
Australia. But they are imported and,
if you can afford them, even the smallest
piece of one will do miracles to almost
any dish. But to most of us, I think,
they will just have to remain a pleasant
memory.
Mushrooms, on the other hand, are
good and plentiful. And often quite
reasonable. Dr. P. J. Valder, of Sydney
University’s Biology Department, tells
me that he receives many inquiries
about fungi in the course of his work.
Lots of them come from New Aus-
tralians who have found a specimen
that reminds them of something that
grew back home. He thinks that people
are well advised to stick to the three
known varieties: field mushrooms, culti-
vated mushrooms, and those known as
“horse” mushrooms—these are forced
and very large, anything from 6in.-9in.
across.
As, however, there are no known or
recorded deaths from the eating of
unusual mushrooms in Australia, he
tells callers that if they are determined
to sample mushrooms they find, to eat
them in small quantities and leave one
by the side of the bed on retiring. (This,
he says, will enable the university to
build up its records on known edible
fungi!)
Mushrooms should always be eaten
when they are reasonably young, firm,
and freshly gathered. If they’ve been
kept for a while and are beginning to
get dark and slimy, for heaven’s sake
throw them away—never mind how
much they cost. They won’t kill you,
but they can make you very sick.
A fresh mushroom salad, served with
cold fillet of beef, is delectable. Take
the smallest button mushrooms for this.
For lib. of mushrooms prepare the
following mixture: If cups water, £ cup
olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoons
white vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt. Into a
small muslin bag place a stalk of celery
with leaves, quartered, 4 sprigs of pars-
ley, 8 peppercorns, 6 coriander seeds.
Place muslin bag into liquid, bring to
the boil, reduce heat and simmer for
5 minutes in covered saucepan. Add
mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes
longer. Remove from heat and allow to
cool overnight. Drain the mushrooms
to serve and sprinkle lightly with finely
chopped parsley.
If you have the tail-end of a decent
bottle of red, and half a pound of fresh
mushrooms, prepare them as a garnish
for fish or fowl. Brown some chopped
shallots lightly in butter with several
cloves of garlic. Add the mushrooms,
without peeling them, but sliced up.
Cover with a lid for a few minutes.
Add the wine, return the lid, and
allow the wine to reduce by half.
For a more glamorous effect with
grills, de-stem your mushrooms, fill the
cavities with very finely chopped garlic
and parsley. Melt a little butter in a
heavy saucepan and stand the whole
mushrooms on the bottom. Cover
tightly and simmer for a few minutes.
Add f pint of red wine for every
mushrooms and allow to reduce by
simmering slowly. The stalks can be
used for mushroom soup.
There are spectacular first courses to
be made from mushrooms —and all of
them simple and quick. The tiny mush-
rooms, for example, are superb dipped
in beaten egg, dusted with breadcrumbs,
and fried quickly in deep fat. Serve
them with a sauce tartare, four or five
little mushrooms per person being the
ideal quantify a favorite of the
Hungarians.
For mushrooms farci use the larger
mushrooms. Select two per person and
peel them. Stuff the mushrooms with a
good pate, sprinkle with very finely
chopped parsley and a little garlic, and
sit them in a heavy saucepan to cook
in a little butter. Keep the lid on tightly
to cook. Warm a little brandy just
before serving and flame the mushrooms
before bringing to the table.
If you require something a little more
filling, buy some large vol-au-vent cases
from a good continental baker. In the
bottom of each case place a small slice
of smoked ham. Saute a mixture of
onion, garlic, chopped bacon, and
chopped mushroom stalks in a little oil.
Add a little wine and make a thick
gravy with the addition of a small
amount of flour. Fill the cases with this
mixture and top with a grilled mush-
room cap. Place the filled vol-au-vent
cases into a hot oven for a few minutes
to warm through. Sprinkle with very
finely chopped parsley and serve.
This is also an excellent luncheon
dish—it looks and tastes superb—and
your guests will never know that it took
only a matter of minutes to put together.
And you won’t need to leave a piece
beside the bed before retiring—there
won’t be any left!

Judy Cassab’s
new directions
By SANDRA DAWSON
Above, Miss Cassab’s portrait of actor
Robert Morley, and left, a painting from
her recent exhibition
FOR JUDY CASSAB her recent show
at the Rudy Komon Gallery, Sydney,
represents four years of trial and error,
seeking and experimentation to find
something she calls “one’s own order,
one’s own object, with its own per-
sonality.”
She also hopes to lose the portrait
painter label which has become attached
more firmly with each prize she has
won and each prominent person she has
painted. “This is my twelfth one-man
show and I feel I should be accepted
for what I am —a contemporary artist
who is also interested in portraiture,”
says Miss Cassab.
This is Miss Cassab’s first show in
four years. “Four years ago I felt a
sudden urgent need to change,” she
said. “As I had no show scheduled, I
thought, ‘Good, now I can go and ruin
canvases.’ I did for the first 2\ years.
The first of the paintings in the exhibi-
tion were done 18 months ago. All the
time I’ve been trying to make them
cleaner, clearer, much simpler.”
Miss Cassab usually has three, four,
or, perhaps, five paintings in progress
at once, working on each for two or
three hours before moving on to the
next. She works a seven-hour day in a
canvas-filled studio at the top of her
comfortable Bellevue Hill house. Here
a stack of paintings chart the changes,
in her style, among them the work
which directly preceded the most recent
development. These paintings are
peopled by blank, staring faces, hemmed
by box-like squares, “not bad paintings
in themselves but not leading any-
where,” comments Miss Cassab.
The latest have a three-dimensional
quality with jewel-like spots of color set
in perspective by solid wedges. All
begin life as representational sketches,
are developed first into small paintings,
then into works on a larger scale. There
are two versions of most paintings in
Miss Cassab’s exhibition, some only
vaguely resembling their counterparts.
“I have an idea, a shape in mind, but
I never know how it will finish. When
a painting reaches a certain stage I set
it against a window, then stand well
back and look at it for a long time.
That is the only way I can feel how the
painting should go.”
Miss Cassab began painting in Hun-
gary at the age of 12, representationally,
because that is the way she was taught.
When she came to Australia she spent
years just forgetting it all in an effort
to find a freer style. “I would spend
an hour with an object, then turn it
upside down to see what it really was,
looking only at the form and the color.”
That was the first Cassab revolution.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Electrifying
THE TROUBLE, these days, is that
art is getting too mechanical; or per-
haps, electrical is a better word.
A friend who has just bought a Mike
Kitching sculpture with flashing lights
and plastic tubes reports he was look-
ing forward with pleasure to meeting
Mr. Kitching and enjoying what he
called “some rapturously artistic con-
versation” about his work.
Instead they talked of bulb wattage
and power points and what to do in
the event of the whole thing blowing
up . . .
Face value
THIS, say cosmetic manufacturers, i-»
the year for women to look natural;
that is, wear make-up by all means,
but don’t look as if you are.
At the same time, Mary Quant in
London is producing eyelashes pur-
chaseable by the yard; young things in
Paris are wearing paper flower stickers
on bared bodies; and only the other
night on ABC television a girl appeared
with stick-on jewels all over her face.
Whose sales-lines are crossing whose?
Keeping on her toes
THREE WOMEN in the world hold
the title of ballerina assoluta; one ol
them arrived in Sydney last week.
Yvette Chauvire, who looks like every-
body’s idea of a Frenchwoman, and of
a ballerina, is here with other members
of the Paris Opera Ballet for eight
days of performances at the Elizabethan
Theatre, Newtown.
Remarkably patient with all the
laboriously composed French phrases
coming her way at a welcoming cock-
tail party, she the complex
workings of the Opera Ballet School,
whose members progress in their
careers with military precision; rank
by rank, examination by examination.
Yvette Chauvire herself began danc-
ing when she was ten years old, work-
ing her way through the five stages of
the school to become une etoile 14
years later. Among the 220 members
of the ballet company, there arc ten
etoiles (five men five women), and
as Miss Chauvire added, a lot of pre-
miers danseurs waiting for a chance of
a solo performance and an opportunity
to prove their readiness for star status.
“It is easy to get there, hard to stay
there,” she said with Gallic practic-
ality.
She has given some thought to the
business of staying there, going through
a five-year period of rethinking her
interpretations and “finding my per-
sonality.” “This was in 1945, after the
Liberation, which was a Liberation
both for Paris and my dancing,” she
said.
The traditional ballets are her first
love, and it was to “Coppelia,” “Swan
Lake,” and “Giselle” that she turned
to find her style.
She has danced in America, and
dances often with other European com-
panies (she was the first ballerina to
partner Nureyev after his defection,
and has since partnered him in Vienna
and Italy), but in Paris, this quest for
freshness still prevails.
She does some teaching, and as a
member of the Opera Ballet Board, re-
cently revamped the second act of
“Giselle,” changing the lighting in an
effort to update it and forestall any
tendency to what she calls “thoughtless-
ness.” “Keeping the ballet alive” is a
phrase that occurs often in her conver-
sation.
The Paris Opera Ballet is renowned
for the manliness of its male dancers.
Miss Chauvire’s explanation for this
is the teaching of Rene Bon, who has
“given the teachers of the men and
the men themselves a strong technique
and elegance.” “It is always hard to
find a good male dancer—much harder
than to find a good ballerina—but
there are more to choose from in
France,” she said. “They are techni-
cally better.”
The company’s performances in
Paris are spasmodic—sometimes three
a week, sometimes once a month, but
while the performances may not be
constant, the practice is, morning,
afternoon, and night.
And how did Yvette Chauvire feel
when mad eballerina assoluta in 1954?
The smile flashed, a hand rose in an
expansive gesture. “Very ‘appy. It was
everything.”
Not much cheer
A RECENT PRESS report from
England states that British pubs are
now being exported in a prefabricated
package deal, complete with barmaids.
This is a rather happy thought, since
pub-life is probably the nicest social
custom that England has to export.
The promoters are hoping to plant
some of the pubs in bushland settings
in Australia. But it is very doubtful
if the Australians will be able to adapt
to the idea of an unsegregated British
pub.
Two English girls who recently
walked into the downstairs bar at the
Wentworth Hotel were astonished when
the entire clientele of presumably
sophisticated city men hissed at them.
Hurriedly rescued by their dates . rom
what was to them a very curious, rather
frightening, situation, and listening in
some wonder to the explanation of
Australian customs, one girl asked if
the men would have eventually stopped
hissing. “Well, they would have had
to,” the Australian escort said reason-
ably. “You can’t keep on hissing and
drink beer, too.”
So though we may gain the buildings
(kit price from $12,000 to $15,000)
and even the British mild and bitters,
which wiill also will be exported—it will
be a challenge to any landlord to
achieve in Australia that happy mixture
of mini-skirts and beards, and cheer-
ful old ladies singing that warms the
heart of Britain.

COMMENT
Whose side will we be on?
THE MOST IMPORTANT NEWS for Australia
last week, as in so many other weeks, was not within
Australia but in the countries to opr north. This time
it was good news. We should welcome, without any
qualifications, the decision of the Philippines, Indo-
nesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand to establish
a new regional co-operative grouping the Associa-
tion-of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
It would have seemed fatuous optimism a short
time ago to imagine that representatives from the
Governments of these five nations could sit around
a conference table and agree on anything. Indonesia
was in a state of confrontation with Malaysia and
Singapore; Singapore and Malaysia were bitterly
attacking each other; the Philippines had staked a
claim to part of Malaysia; Indonesia saw itself in
the Chinese camp; Thailand and the Philippines saw
themselves in the American camp.
Many differences and tensions still divide the
five nations of ASEAN. But their attempt to provide
forms of co-operation between themselves even
if it only half works could prove to be a water-
shed in the history of this part of South-East Asia.
So much depends on the stability of governments
within the area that it would at present be ingenuous
to be optimistic. But what last week’s meeting
dramatises is that it can also be ingenuous to be
pessimistic.' Our own planning should include pros-
pects of success as well as prospects of disaster.
The decisive element, of course, has been the
change of regime in Indonesia. The most important
fault of the “domino theory” of South-East Asia was
that it was a highly misleading metaphor in that it
did not allow for the possibilities of the bottom
domino Indonesia being glued to the table.
At present Indonesia is the most anti-Peking of them
all, although it would be true to say that there is
probably not one nation left in South-East Asia,
apart from North Vietnam, that could be described
as being in the Peking camp. And now that Indonesia
has withdrawn from global excitements and heroic
philosophising and, apart from trying to re-establish
its credit with the world’s trading powers, is now
more concerned with itself as the principle power in
the part of the world where it lives, there is at last
that possibility of “Asian solutions to Asian problems”
that can provide the only real prospect for peace.
This is not to say that foreign military and
economic power cannot also be necessary but that
they cannot in themselves finally decide things.
American military might can finally succeed in South
Vietnam only if South Vietnamese society can work
in some way or other that makes some kind of
sense to the people of South Vietnam. In the same
way economic assistance only makes sense if it has
some relation to what is going on in the society that
is being assisted. If ASEAN can develop into a
meaningful expression of regional self-respect it might
provide a real basis for that growth of freedom and
material progress that most ordinary people crave
everywhere. If some of this begins to happen, it can
be assisted by foreign nations, but these nations must
be prepared to deal not with client states, but with
nations that are beginning to recover self-confidence.
So far as Australia is concerned our most sensible
course for the moment is to wait and see what
happens to ASEAN. We should express our pleasure
at its formation and hold ourselves ready to co--
operate if we are asked to. If our five nearest Asian
neighbors prove to be really going into the business of
getting on with each other we must give relations
with them special priority. So far as military power is
concerned we have the special problem that Singapore
and Malaysia may ask us for special commitments,
while Indonesia does not. We can enter into these
commitments, but only with a definition of what we
are commiting ourselves to. Our final policy goal
should be a defence alliance in which we join the
five nations of ASEAN, along with New Zealand, in
a regional security pact. Our prosperity, unparalleled
in the area, makes it possible for us to be a compara-
tively strong military power. What we need is the
brains to work out, by cost and benefit analysis, what
our policy on our armed forces should- be and then
to see to it that we get a lot more for our money than
we are getting at present.
In economic policy we can most effectively assist
by training schemes and by buying more from the
countries of ASEAN. If ASEAN develops workable
economic, policies it will then be up to us to co-operate
by giving them special priorities. Here Japan may
force some of our pace. If the Japanese came in
with assistance schemes, they would expect us to
support them. This might give us special problems,
in which, in the interests of our neighbors, we might
disagree with Japanese policies. Whose side would
we be on? This will be a continuing problem for
Australia. The strategic policies of America and the
economic policies of Japan may not always match the
policies of ASEAN (if ASEAN comes to anything).
Whose side will we be on?

Is Parliament on the way
to a double dissolution?
THE NEXT SESSION of Parliament
is certain to /be the most disputatious
for a long time. And not just because
there will be a good many Opposition
MPs wanting to score debating points
off the Prime Minister for his lotus-land
gaffes or Mr. McEwen for his 8.1. G.
bull-roaring.
Parliament is on course for a double
dissolution. Unless the key political
players show a degree of ability to side-
step, they seem bound to collide this
session and bring on general elec-
tions for the House of Representatives
and the Senate. For the stage is :( set.
List session the Senate, led by jthe
DLP, twice rejected the Government’s
bill to increase postal charges. This bill
is being re-presented with the budget
next week.
There will be great pressure on the
Labor Party again to join with the
DLP, and knock it out for the third
time. For one thing, failure to con-
tinue to vote against the measure would
provide powerful ammunition for the
DLP in its constant campaign (served
up before pending State elections) to
portray the ALP as a poor and ineffec-
tive Opposition. You came with us
in a gesture of opposition (the
DLP might say), but when it comes to
the crunch you chicken out.
But many people in the Labor Party
see more than face to be lost in going
along with the Government in its postal
charges. They see an opportunity lost,
an opportunity to make a bold bid for
national power. In exhilarated comment
on their grand Corio by-election victory,
they point out that they need a swing
of only seven percent to bring down the
Holt-McEwen coalition. And they got
a ten percent swing in Corio.
Far-fetched though this analysis may
seem to outside observers, what matters
is that it is gaining considerable cur-
rency within the Labor Party.
Evidence of this is to be found in the
lead story in “Fact,” the official journal
of the Labor Party in Victoria: “It
appears quite likely that the Australian
Labor Party will vote' against the post
bffice charges when they are re-sub-
mitted.” '■ ' • rc-
Then it devotes most of its repiort
io debunking the traditional Labor
arguments against precipitating a double
dissolution by a final third rejection of
Government legislation. It first argues
against the traditional view—supported
by ex-leader Calwell that it should
not be rejected in the Senate because it
is a money bill. Then, more signifi-
cantly, it knocks the biggest ALP bogy
oh all, by saying that double dissolution
would not, as usually believed benefit
that epitome of evil, the Democratic
Labor Party.
“It is now believed, if anything, that
the DLP stands to gain more by the
conduct of ordinary Senate elections
55
There is one final reason why the
Labor Party may be tempted to “go
for broke” by provoking a double dis-
solution. That is the matter of electoral
redistribution which hangs over its head.
Redistribution of House of Representa-
tives seats to make them correspond to
modern population distribution is pend-
ing. It is bound to reduce ALP rep-
resentation in the Parliament because it
must involve the massive consolidation
of electorates in the depopulated inner
areas of Melbourne and Sydney. Such
a procedure would cost the Labor Party
between two and six seats in the House
of Representatives, including the seats
of influential members of the Parlia-
mentary Party like Dr. Cairns, Mr.
Crean, Mr. Calwell, and others.
And the ALP isn’t the only party
with such an interest in a double dis-
solution. The Country Party, which
must lose a N.S.W. country seat in a
redistribution, would also be interested
in postponing the evil day when elec-
tions must be based on the real popu-
lation structure of the nation.
This was undoubtedly in the mind
of the Minister for the Interior, Mr.
Anthony, when he declared at the
Country Party annual conference at
Coff’s Harbor that a double dissolution
was “inevitable” if the Senate rejected
the postal charges bill again.
Of course, it isn’t inevitable. Not
much in politics is.
But there are also pressures on the
Liberal Party to allow things to run their
course toward a double dissolution. Mr.
Holt has spoken most bitterly against
the Senate * for its rejection of his
legislation. He argued that; the postal
charges bill was a “money bill” which
should not be rejected when it has been
passed by the popular House. It would
be most inconsistent for him to turn
around and meekly accept that bill’s
next rejection.
HOLT.. . lotus land gaffe
WHITLAM ... image still tarnished
■ There is also the point that the
Budget structure is built very heavily
on the foundation of this bill. Without
the s7om extra which it provides, the
budget would be a completely different
document. In fact, the only alternative
to accepting the rejection of the postal
charge increases would be the intro-
duction of a supplementary Budget
providing for increases in taxes, 3c on
cigarettes, 1c on beer, or percent on
income tax, perhaps.
Another thought in Mr. Holt’s mind
must be that it is going to be exceed-
ingly difficult for him to win control
of the Senate in its ordinary tegular
elections. He has to “win” (get three of
the five positions) in five of the six
States of the Commonwealth. He would
have a better chance in a double dis-
solution with all positions thrown open.
. Tactically it may suit him, too. Mr.
Whitlam has just again demonstrated
to the country that “faceless men” and
“witless men” (even if increased in
numbers from 36 and 12) still run the
Labor Party, not Mr. Whitlam. He


believes that the Corio result was
largely a product of local issues and is
not indicative of the general mood of
the electorate.
Why not defeat Mr. Whitlam while
his image is still tarnished by the rust
of his decaying machine?
But of course there are reasons why,
when it comes to the point of decision,
a double dissolution may be sidestepped.
Parliamentarians of every political
shade like their jobs. They have been
elected for a period and do not like
to face the risks and endure the
exertions of electioneering unnecessarily.
The bird in the hand of a seat for
another 27 months may seem more to
them than the two birds in the bush of
possible power.
Vietnam
Dithering
SINCE the Americans asked for more
Australian troops in Vietnam, the Com-
monwealth Government has been
dithering.
The Taylor mission pointed out that
on a population basis Australia is failing
to pull its weight in Vietnam. The
United States has about 2500 soldiers
per million of their population in the
war, while we have a mere 700 odd.
Moreover, our army is so small we
can't put more than three battalions in
action in an overseas theatre. At present
Korea, with a population not much
bigger than our own, has 18 battalions
in action, and may send more.
We told the Americans we couldn’t
commit an extra battalion to turn our
Task Force into a brigade. To do this
we would have had to cannibalise every
unit in Australia for men eligible and
fit to be sent overseas or else with-
draw our battalion from the Strategic
Reserve in Malaysia, a move which
would mean the end of our defence help
there.
The real question is: Which support
units should be added to the two-
battalion Task Force? It is at present
heavily dependent on the Americans.
For medium artillery it depends on
U.S. 155 mm. guns at Nui Dat, for
TAYLOR ... not pulling weight
helicopters, on two companies of chop-
pers at Vung Tau, and for armored
support, on a U.S. unit 40 miles to
the north of Nui Dat.
This Vietnam Task Force has asked
for Centurion tanks. In the dry these
lumbering vehicles would be useful on
paddies and in penetrating thick bush.
In the wet they would prove excellent,
even if road-bound, mobile artillery.
Army helicopters are badly needed as
well; Air Force hovercraft are required
to operate under tedious peacetime
flying procedures. As our military
operations stretch further from base
camp in the rubber trees at Nui Dat
we will need longer range artillery
cover; and that means 155 mm. guns.
Money for Viet Cong
Treachery?
ONE OF CANBERRA’S übiquitous
inter-departmental committees has
finally got around to starting to think
about what should be done about people
raising money for the Viet Cong.
Comprising representatives from the
Attorney General’s, Defence, External
Affairs and Prime Minister’s Depart-
ments it has made several attempts to
consider the matter. No final recom-
mendations have been made. But some
points are clear. There is no doubt
about the legalisms. Under Section 24
AA' of the Crimes Act assistance to the
Viet "Cong whether medical or other-
wise can clearly be made an act of
“Treachery.” Sub-section (1) includes
the paragraph: “Assist by any means
whatever, with intent to assist, a pro-
claimed enemy of a proclaimed
country.”
The Government will be reluctant
to mobilise this sweeping power by
“proclaiming” South Vietnam and its
enemy the Viet Cong. It is much more
likely to invoke the narrower part of
the Act, sub-section (2), which states:
“Where a part of the Defence Force
is on service outside the Common-
wealth, a person shall not assist by
any means whatever, with intent to
assist, any persons (a) against whom
that part of the Defence Force ... is
or is likely to be opposed; and (b) who
are specified by proclamation . . .”
Under this sub-section only the Viet
Cong would have to be “proclaimed”
and any subsequent prosecutions would
clearly be based on assistance to those
who fight our soldiers. The Govern-
ment of Vietnam does not need to come
into it.
The Commonwealth Government is
not worried about the few Melbourne
students raising money for the Viet
Cong. But it sees the possibility that
the movement may spread more widely
in the community unless the legal impli-
cations are made clear. Already in Can-
berra there is a general “Canberra Aid
the N.L.F. Committee” which is ap-

features are missing.
pealing outside the University for
money “which may be used by the
N.L.F. in any way it sees fit.”
In a general statement this committee
said: “Harold Holt has chosen his side.
He has chosen the side of reaction. At
the last General Election about 40 per-
cent of Australians opposed this choice
... we cannot sit on the sideline . . .
we have chosen our side. We hope you
will join us.” There is concern that
the large “Vietnam Action” Commit-
tees, no longer under the direct control
of prudent Communist Party officials,
may take up the cause.
People in Government in Canberra
are also astonished at the audacious
means being used already to solicit
Viet Cong funds. Only a few weeks
ago the Melbourne University Adminis-
tration sent a circular, asking for Viet
Cong funds, in the pay envelopes of all
staff members. The joke in Canberra
is that the Chancellor of the University,
Sir Robert Menzies, is going to be the
first person lumbered under his own
Crimes Act.
But it is hardly a joking matter even
for the more cynical politicians. For
there are Senate Elections coming along
and there is every indication that the
D.L.P. could make this its major cam-
paign issue. There is obviously a great
potential store of electoral sympathy
for the argument that having declared
the Vietnam war as vital to Australian
security, and having taken the drastic
step of conscripting young men to fight
there, the Government has a moral
duty to use the legal means at its dis-
posal to prevent local assistance to the
enemy forces.
The D.L.P. which is close to a quota
for a Senate seat in several States
could on this issue enlarge its balance
of power position and deny the Govern-
ment control of the Upper House.
It is even possible that A.L.P. parlia-
mentarians might wish to dissociate
themselves from the extremists who go
beyond the cries of disinvolvement in
Vietnam and openly canvass the Com-
munist’s issue. They might at • least be
expected to point to the anomaly in-
volved in conscription against the Viet
Cong and toleration of illegal Viet
Cong fund raising locally, in much the
same way as they exploit the China-is-
a-menace-but-let’s-trade-as-normal rou-
tine.
Cynical politics aside there will be
strong support within the Government
parties for legal deterrents of the Viet
Cong fund raisers. It is not only at the
jingoistic fringes that there is a feeling
that there is something unpatriotic in-
volved in helping the soldiers our dig-
gers are fighting.


Film industry
Quick cuts
THE RECENT major changes in the
structure of the American film industry
have already affected some areas of the
film business in Australia.
The major Hollywood companies
have offices here which act as little
more than exchanges for prints of films,
and disseminate publicity material
originating in the United States. But
in some cases individuals have produced
their own advertising campaigns; last
year Alan Wardrope, of Paramount in
Sydney, won an international competi-
tion in film publicity and was flown to
New York and Europe as part of his
reward.
Times have changed. Wardrope has
left Paramount in a local re-shuffle
which followed the takeover of Para-
mount by Gulf Oil and Western in the
United States. Recently, Paramount’s
International Publicity Department in
Hollywood was shut down and Rose
Goldstein, head of International Pub-
licity there for several decades, was
given a week to clear out her desk and
close her office.
The local branch consequently suf-
fered not only the resignation of Ward-
rope, but also that of his assistant, Hans
van Pinxteren. Simultaneously, Robert
Graham, American head of Paramount
here, was transferred to New York,
where he is now head of Latin-Ameri-
can and Pacific operations.
Robert Graham ... transferred
Universal has also had a re-shuffle;
it was recently visited by top executives
from New York and has subsequently
had an addition to the staff: Para-
mount’s van Pinxteren. It is very doubt-
ful whether Lin Endean, head of Uni-
versal publicity for many years, will
remain with the company.
At Hoyts and its associate company,
20th Century-Fox, there have also been
major changes. Hugh McGowan, head
of publicity at Fox, left the industry
after a brilliant record of service; his
departure seems to have been due to
internal politicking. Bill Band has re-
placed him; Band used to be with
Metro.
These are only the beginnings of what
will probably be a further local re-
shuffle over the next few months.
Warners, for instance, have now been
taken over by the independent com-
pany of Seven Arts, and Jack Warner
himself, the company’s supreme com-
mander for 40 years, was recently told
to “shut up” at a board meeting; no
doubt this will eventually affect the
Warner distribution set-up here.
Hollywood, with its increasing trend
toward ownership by non-film hiring
panies, will almost certainly be hiring
and firing staff here in the next few
months after flying in top executives
to investigate local administration.
Trade
Well placed
BALANCE of payments prospects look
reasonably good in the coming year.
A mid-year “Wool Outlook” put out
by the Bureau of Agricultural Econom-
ics estimates that wool production will
rise three percent in the financial year
just beginning, taking it beyond the
levels recorded before the 1965-66
drought. Prices are expected to fall no
further and might even rise as demand
for fibre strengthens in Western Europe.
Exports of manufactured goods ex-
panded 20 percent last year and are
expected to rise again. Mineral exports
will jump too, and with de Gaulle con-
tinuing his anti-English agitation there
will for the moment be no immediate
British entry to the Common Market
to worry our dried fruits or dairymen.
Meat and wheat sales should bring in
at least as much as last year.
Imports are likely to rise too, but
probably more moderately than ex-
ports which will produce a small if
useful surplus on trade. Someday Aus-
tralia will hope to gain some savings
from containerization and modernization
of shipping but that time is still several
years off, and the costs in foreign ex-
change of freight and insurance will
continue to grow. Capital inflow at
least is expected to be up on last years
depressed level. So at least we look well
placed to balance our foreign exchange
budget.
RITTER ... not me
The West
Paul Ritter
SPRING IS COMING and the west is
even more a Lotus land than the rest of
of Australia so when Perth City Council
last week sacked Town Planner Paul
Ritter the body of the public opinion
could be summed up as how shocking
but thank goodness that’s over. At first
glance, despite moves for reinstatement
or retribution, it would seem Perth’s
being fed up with the Ritter business
could outweigh the finer points of the
possible injustice of his dismissal.
Ritter was convicted as soon as he
set foot in Perth, criticising aspects of
the then sacrosarct Stevenson plan. The
men who later threw him out de-
fended him at the time, saying that this
kind of behavior was excausable in such
a brilliant man. But his defenders
dwindled against the onslaught of his
continued criticism and comment on all
issues. That he was right more often
than not was beside the point. Ritter
vigorously denies that he failed to pro-
duce the plan he was hired to produce
the reason given for his dismissal.
The handshakes he gets when walking
down St. George’s Terrace and the
moves gathering momentum on his be-
half (petitions, unease from the depart-
ment he built around himself and a
coming meeting of electors) suggest
that many more fireworks may be com-
ing. Meantime he has a job as a news
analyst on a commercial TV station
thereby keeping his face and the mind
behind it before the public.
Ritter leaves no doubt about the out-
come: “It seems the present council-
lors will have to go, or me and it’s
not going to be me.” .


PETER
SAMUEL
ASKS:
WHAT ROLE FOR
THE AUSTRALIANS
IN VIETNAM?
AUSTRALIAN POLICY in Vieinam
is at the crossroads, and important
decisions will soon have to be made
about what we should do there.
The American military in Saigon
(MACV) are quite clear about what
they want. They think our troops have
done the job in Phuoc Tuy, and want
them moved to fight in a more mili-
tarily critical area of the country.
General Westmoreland, understandably,
would like to be able to deploy our
Task Force flexibly, as if it were one of
his own units. In December he suggested
it be moved to support the Marines
in I Corps. And now there is American
pressure again. Mr. McNamara hinted
publicly at it when he spoke, at his
Press conference at Tan Sou Nhut air-
port, of the need for using Allied
troops more effectively. The Taylor
mission was probably concerned with it,
too.
And in the context of our past
policies, the American view is reason-
able and sensible enough. Ever since
1960, when our assistance to Vietnam
began, it has been a salt-and-pepper
affair, a tiny addition to the huge meals
of American assistance and scattered
thinly all over the country. The Army
advisers were from the beginning, and
still are, scattered. When Australian
regular troops arrived in 1965 they
were simply tagged on to the American
command and assigned to defend the
American Bien Hoa airbase.
Our civil aid has been similarly dis-
persed from medical teams in the
delta to English teachers in Saigon, the
ill-fated dairy farm to the north at
Ben Cat, a water supply system for
Bien Hoa, to lathes for the Nha Trang
technical college halfway up the coast.
Australian civil aid was administered
by junior embassy officials, real project
assessment being left to the U.S. Agency
for International Development. As our
civil aid grew, the Americans expanded
the co-ordinating apparatus by estab-
lishing a little group of their officers in
a section called “Free World Assist-
ance,” and these four Americans did our
negotiations with Vietnamese Govern-
ment agencies, and virtually handed to
our embassy people a list of aid pro-
jects. The embassy was left the simple
job of deciding, with the Department
of External Affairs and the Treasury in
Canberra, which projects on the USAID
list we could undertake.
Only since the middle of last year
have there been tentative steps toward
a more positive and independent Aus-
tralian role in Vietnam. The assignment
to the Australian Task Force of a
“Tactical Area of Responsibility” in
Phuoc Tuy province was the first move
toward greater control over our own
military assistance. And on the civil aid
side the establishment of an aid section
in External Affairs and the dispatch of
one of its senior officers, Mr. L.
Corkery, to Saigon as “Aid Counsellor”
has at least made it administratively
possible for us to take some initiatives
which were quite impossible before.
But there is no indication that there
is any thought about how far our
developing capacity for independent
action could be taken. Army Minister
Fraser has merely been maintaining the
status quo in saying he intends our
troops should remain in Phuoc Tuy, and
there is no indication that External
Affairs has thought through our future
role.
High-level decisions will have to be
made soon for one simple reason •
the great success with which our Task
Force has operated since its arrival in
the middle of Phuoc Tuy province in
May last year. At that time the writ
of the Vietnamese Government hardly
ran beyond the provincial capital of
Baria and the coastal town of Vung
Tau. The Communists, with their sth
Division of 5000 regulars plus 2000
provincial and village guerillas, were
well entrenched among the rural popu-
lation. All the major roads were closed
to friendly forces, and the area was a
major source of food, finance and
recruits for the Communists of several
provinces near Saigon. It was one of the
main "areas through which the Com-
munists took men and supplies from
their parts of the Mekong delta to
major combat areas in the central high-
lands.
Although the Army themselves are
very cautious about claiming dramatic
successes, it is pretty clear that already
they have transformed the situation in
the province. All but a few villages
have now been brought under some sort
of friendly administration, and the pro-
portion of population classified as
“secure” has been raised from 30 per-
cent to 90 percent. The main force
units of the sth Division have by in-
tensive patrolling been pushed out into
“the scrub,” as the jungle is called,
and in their few clashes with our troops
their losses have been so heavy that
they have had to reinforce a great deal
with North Vietnamese troops.
Being fortunate to operate in an area
where there is plenty of popular
antagonism toward the Communists
and where there is relatively good
Vietnamese intelligence and administra-
tive capacity, our task force has been
able to disrupt the activities of the
village guerillas. With the building of
the ten-mile “fence,” the Communist
mainforce and provincial units in the
hills have been further isolated from
the population among which their doc-
trine tells them they must live.
So successful has our Task Force
been that the time is soon approaching
when Communist military effectiveness
in the province will be completely
neutralised.
The American pressure on us .will
increasingly be that we should move
out of the province and, as laid down
at Guam, hand over pacification to the
Vietnamese. At the very least, accord-
ing to American strategy, our troops
should be increasingly engaged in large
mobile offensive operations (like recent
Operation Paddington) against main-
force units, even if such operations are
still conducted from the base at Nui
Dat.
Undoubtedly, too, it would be more
convenient for the Americans if they
were to continue to run our civil aid
program through the Free World
Assistance section of USAID.
But we may do better by exercising
a degree of independence and attempt-
ing to co-ordinate our assistance to
produce a coherent Australian effort.
And there are good reasons for doing
this in Phuoc Tuy province, where the
base is established, the troops are
known, contacts with the population
made, and the basis for assisting the
local Vietnamese authorities well de-
veloped.
For although the primary military
task of neutralising the mainforce mili-
tarily and putting the pressure on vill-
age guerillas has been successfully
accomplished, the job in Phuoc Tuy has
by no means been done. The removal of
our troops would see the two regiments
of the sth Division simply come out
of the scrub and re-enter the populated
part of the province to rebuild their
damaged political and administrative
machine and re-establish their authority.

available to come in and take over
from our troops, and the popular and
provincial militia are not nearly suffi-
ciently developed to offer effective pro-
tection at the village level by themselves.
So there is a continued role for the
Task Force in keeping the mainforce
Communists at arm’s length, out of the
way in the scrub where they trouble no
one except foresters or big-game hunters
and the occasional French rubber
planter.
It might also be possible to start now
on training Vietnamese troops to a level
of military proficiency whereby they
could be expected to take over from
our own in five or six years. This would
involve speeding up the process of
getting rid of the hundred-odd Ameri-
can advisers who operate with the Viet-
namese militia in Phuoc Tuy province
and replacing them with Australian
advisers. It might also require putting
squads of Australian soldiers in Vietna-
mese platoons, a procedure which has
been most successfully used by the U.S.
Marines in the Danang area. Every mili-
tary person you speak to in
says that the problems of the Vietna-
mese Army are in its junior officers and
NCOs, and that the introduction of
American, Korean, or Australian troops
into their ranks works wonders through
the leadership and training it provides.
But the greatest advantage in staying
on in Phuoc Tuy lies in the economic
reconstruction which is now possible.
Behind the shield of military security
(constructed, let it be remembered, at
the cost of about 100 Australian lives),
the “other war,” of which politicians
have so often spoken, can be pressed
on with.
So far only lip service has been given
to the proposition that this is a war
on every front, that it is as much a
political as a military struggle and
that economic and social improvement
is an essential follow-throu<?h to the
provision of physical security from
Communist coercion.
The “other war” is, of course, not
another war. It is another aspect of
the same war. Take the problem of
preventing the Viet Cong “taxing” the
peasants of Phuoc Tuy province by
taking half their rice harvest. It is
one of the most important tasks of
our troops, especially at this time of the
year. The famous fence of barbed wire
and mines, was constructed largely with
the aim of preventing ox-cart loads of
rice seized by the Viet Cong going out
to their bases in the jungle.
If it is successful there will be pro-
found repercussions. The most un-
popular aspect of the Viet Cong
presence would be removed and many
peasant hearts and minds won. In
addition, the mainforce Communist
troops, for whom the rice was bound,
would have to go without or be forced
to look for food farther afield, straining
their logistics.
And yet this sort of operation would
be greatly helped by a piece of “econ-
omic aid” a program of building
grain silos throughout the province. At
present the people simply keep their
rice in their village houses, and Com-
munist “tax officials” just come along
at night, knock on the door, point a
gun if necessary, and take off with a
sack of rice. If each village had a
concrete silo, protected by barbed wire,
mines, and an alarm system, the Com-
munists would find it immensely more
difficult to levy their “taxes.” If the
village people kept only a week’s rice
in their houses, going to the village silo
once a week for supplies, the Viet Cong
would find “taxation” forays far less
rewarding.
The silo program would, of course,
have other benefits. Rats and mice, as
well as Communists, would get less of
the villagers’ precious crop and less
would be damaged by rain.
The building of cylindrical concrete
silos is a pretty simple operation,
requiring only cement, concrete-mixers,
and formwork, and could easily be let
to local contractors. With 16 clusters of
hamlets in the province, the expense
would not run into more than a couple
of hundred thousand dollars.
It might be combined with a program
to increase rice production in the
province, which at the present time is
based on poor rice strains, single crop-
ping, and no fertiliser. The cattle of the
province are heavily infested with
hydatids and tapeworm, so animal hus-
bandry technicians and chemicals could
usefully be used. The Americans sug-
gested late last year that we establish
a cattle vaccine plant, but nothing has
happened so far.
The fishing industry of the province
could be greatly expanded by helping
the fishermen of Vung Tau with new
boats, a better wharf, and a freezing
works. Evidently some sort of request
for assistance here has already been put
to the Australian authorities by the
province chief, but nothing has come of
it.
Subsidiary agricultural activities
fruit and vegetable growing for local
consumption and for the Saigon market
—could be helped along a great deal.
Military measures to open roads in the
province have already led to some
increase in production of this sort.
Poultry and pigs are a substantial
source of extra food and income for
the people of the province, but the
breeds are bad and the animals diseased,
so in that direction, too, there is scope
for assistance.
Medical aid is something which could
be greatly expanded. One of the three
surgical teams operates at Vung Tau at
the southern end of the province, and
Army doctors and dentists make regular
visits to villages. A certain amount of
anti-malarial spraying is done! But the
general cover is by no means compre-
hensive, and it is done without any
attempt to train Vietnamese to take
over eventually some of the burden.
Our surgical teams at Bien Hoa and
Long Xuyen in the Mekofig delta could
quite well be shifted into the province,
one to work at provincial capital of
Baria and the other to work as a mobile


unit based at Nui Dat. Baria at present
ds served by a rather listless team of
Koreans who live at Vung Tau, 20 miles
away, and spend most of their time
travelling to work and home again.
But most of the health problems of
the province (as of Vietnam generally)
are not surgical. Cholera, typhoid,
influenza, TB, bronchitis, the plague,
and malaria are the main problems, and
they are best countered with efforts at
improving sanitation and water supply,
and by the establishment of a system of
clinics and dispensaries in the villages,
manned by locals trained to plunge a
hypodermic syringe into an arm.
The public works department of the
province could be helped in a number
of ways by attaching municipal civil
engineers to its office in Baria, and
giving them some political power by
assigning them a dozen or so pieces of
earthmoving equipment and some pipe-
making machinery, so that they could
work on minor road, sewage, and drain-
age projects.
And why do we have to do our
next major water-supply scheme out
in the delta at Can Tho? A less
ambitious project at Baria and small
schemes in ,the villages of Phuoc Tuy
would be more closely related to our
general effort. Sealed wells in 20 or
30 places in the province would do
more to improve health than hundreds
of Collins or Macquarie Street surgeons.
Small electrical generating units in
each of a dozen major villages in the
province would create something of a
social revolution among the people,
and would undoubtedly raise the
popular status of our whole effort in
the province. Jokes about lowering the
birth rate aside, it would enable the
people to read more, meet more easily
at night, and achieve greater social
integration, while.making it far easier
to afford to run radio sets. It might
also improve agriculture through
enabling the use of electric water
pumps.
At present the trend is for the Army
to take on an increasing number of
these civil aid projects as a result of
the urgings of Army officers in Phuoc
Tuy and the personal interest of the
Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser. And of
course it is a way for the Army to
improve its image.
But it is very questionable whether
this trend should be allowed to con-
tiive. The ..Army is pitifully short of
trained men and equipment. It is
trained to fight and to provide security.
Its organisation and equipment are
designed for this purpose. Our two
battalions in the province are faced
by a Communist mainforce division, a
well-regarded provincial battalion, and
1000 guerillas. Our soldiers get almost
a year’s training in the use of weapons
and it seems a waste that any of these
people should then be put on to digging
sewers, however desirable it may be
that that job be done.
People in Vietnam complain that
already the military effort is being
hampered somewhat by the assignment
of Army people and machinery to civil
aid. The health of troops must suffer
when Army doctors are put on village
Medcap duty. And when Air Force
helicopters are used to give the village
children rides, they are not available
so quickly should one of our patrols
be ambushed. It would be far better for
a Civil Affairs unit to be formed out-
side the Army set-up, athough its mem-
bers could perhaps be given a minimum
of military training in self-defence. But
the full year of infantry training given
to regular soldiers is a waste of scarce
Army instructional capacity.
Our Task Force badly needs its own
“psywar” unit. At present it relies for
its communication with the population
on American and. Vietnamese teams,
and many opportunities for gaining
popular support are lost because
“psywar” personnel and equipment
cannot be assembled at the right time.
A voice aircraft and radio transmitters,
several movie projectors, and a squad
of a dozen people would be sufficient.
By these means our troops would be
able to get across to the population
news of VC atrocities and news of what
was being done in the way of civic aid.
They could be given answers to Com-
munist propaganda, and informed of
the failure of the Communists to carry
out promises of economic improvement
and reform.
The use of a voice aircraft in the
mountains where the mainforce units
are based might well increase the sur-
render rate and reduce the number of
people our blokes have to fight.
A team of a dozen., intelligent imag-
inative fellows attached to Task Force
“Intelligence” could produce the
material for the voice aircraft, for
pamphlets and broadcasts. Most im-
portant, Vietnamese soldiers and village
leaders could be provided with lecture
material.
Such a comprehensive, multi-faceted
effort in Phuoc Tuy province would
have a number of important advantages
over the alternative of a military effort
which is shifting in its geographical
location and divorced from the political
and economic aspects of the struggle
there.
First it would mean less Australians
killed. So far our casualties in Vietnam
have been far lower than those suffered
by the Americans, largely because our
style of fighting is different. Our tactics
are more cautious. For the Americans
the key word in their strategy is “kill,”
for us it is “interdict.” The Americans
attempt to destroy the enemy; we
attempt to neutralise him.
We have our distinctive strategy and
there is far more chance of our prac-
tising and developing it if we are not
assigned to the essentially peripheral
struggle along the borders of South
Vietnam, or attached to American units.
The Americans, with their lavish use
of air power, armored vehicles, massive
patrols, and air mobility, have nowhere
done as well as the Koreans or our own
troops. Simple cordons and searches of
villages generally bring better results
than massive assaults on jungle bases;
interdiction wears down mainforce
units better than gargantuan attempts at
destruction; patrolling in the jungle
catches more of the enemy than
armored vehicles on the roads.
Secondly, the consolidated applica-
tion of military and civil aid in the
one area will develop in our people
there far more appreciation of the
nature of the struggle, the fact that its
various facets are inextricably inter-
twined, and that every effort is comple-
mentary to the other. If our activities
military, economic, medical, and
psychological in Phuoc Tuy were
to be intelligently communicated to the
Australian people there would be a
far greater domestic understanding of
what we are up against in Communist
revolutionary warfare. As a result of
this it should be possible to destroy
Leftist myths, on which so much of
the opposition to our involvement in
Vietnam is based.
It would also have a variety of minor
benefits, which, however, would add
up to something significant. With civil
aid projects scattered like pepper and
salt over South Vietnam as at present,
our embassy staff and aid people spend
an immense amount of time, and incur
considerable risks, simply travelling
from one place to another. A great
amount of their energy has to go into
making contacts and discovering the
background facts before they can get
down to business. The political impact
of what they do is simply lost in the
immensity of what the Americans are
doing. By a quiet concentrated effort
in co-operation with fellow Australians
and known local Vietnamese in a
limited area, they would get far more
done; and more would also be seen to
have been done.


Australia —Japan’s
A BULLETIN REPORT
IN SOME WAYS Australia is becom-
ing an economic colony of Japan, just
as in some ways it has been an economic
coloqy of Britain and the U.S.A.
Beneath the puff and bombast of self-
congratulation we have always had a
status of economic colonialism. In fact,
this—the third great economic invasion
of Australia —is likely to proceed for
some time with less tension than marked
the first two. But the very gentleness
and good luck of our increasing econo-
mic dependence on Japan has meant
that Australians have given very little
thought to the nature of the country
that, in a decade, could be for us the
most important nation in the world.
We have decided—correctly—to for-
get about the militarist Japan of Pearl
Harbor, Singapore, and the Kokoda
Trail. But what have we replaced this
concept with? The tourist’s Japan of
Cherry-Blossom-Land? The business-
man’s Japan of mystifying contacts and
relaxing steam baths? How closely have
we faced up to the fact that in certain
ways Japan is the most contemporary-
minded industrialised nation in the
world, whereas our prosperity is mainly
a chance by-product of the industrialisa-
tion of overseas powers? If “western”
means not matters of race but an atti-
tude toward technological change, then
the Japanese are one of the most “wes-
tern” nations on earth and our own
society is somewhat old-fashioned, not
fully understanding change. The “wes-
tern” ability to revolutionise things by
planning their transformation has, per-
haps, reached its highest pitch in con-
temporary Japan, compared with every
other industrialised power. In Australia
our horizons of the possible are rather
close to our noses: in Japan they can
be breathtakingly far away.
The relevant way to compare Japan
and Australia goes beyond looking at
our respective histories and cultures. It
can be a waste of time comparing the
Japanese tea ceremony with the way we
used to boil our billies or to see our-
selves as if we were as good as the
Americans or even the British at manu-
facturing things and then look down on
the Japanese consumer-goods distribu-
tion system because it is such a mess.
It can be calamitous to imagine our-
selves as a more “western” nation than
Japan— Ha! ha! ha! Look at their quaint
marketing folk ways! Or to “misunder-
stand” them— Ho! ho! ho! Aren’t they
funny with all that politeness! —by com-
plaining about something that is also
characteristic of other nations.
For example, we should not find
strange in the Japanese what we also
find in the British. Like the Japanese,
the British are taught a highly elaborate
politeness which they throw up as a
smokescreen in personal relations so that
behind this smokescreen they have time
to make some tough, realistic, and self-
interested decisions. If our Prime Minis-
ter, as recently as this year—in the case
of the British pull-out of Singapore and
Malaysia—could still be fooled by the
British we should not see the Japanese
combination of politeness and shrewd
decision-making as being peculiarly
inscrutable. It is also rather British. An
illuminating study could be made of the
two island powers of Britain and Japan.
For instance, the continental European
distrust of “perfidious Albion” fits in
with some of the continental Asian dis-
trust of Japan. Of course, so far as
attitudes to modernity are concerned,
the Japanese might come through as
more “occidental” than the British, who
in some ways are going through an
“oriental” mood.
Although the most relevant way of
comparing ourselves with the Japanese
is as two examples of “modernity,”
there is a problem. In trying to imagine
what, in this regard, is common to and
what is different between the two
nations Australians suffer two disadvan-
tages. One is that we usually rely on
people in overseas countries to tell us
what people in other overseas countries
are like. This usually means that we
read books by Englishmen and Ameri-
cans. In learning about Japan this is a
fatal disadvantage. Most of the English
are not interested in the subject
(although a recent excellent analysis in
the “Economist” provides a basis for
some of this article) and the Americans
can become so angry with Japanese
differences from the United States that
much American writing on Japan is
concerned with the subject of how im-
possible it is to write about Japan.
But, as well as this disadvantage, there
is another. Australians who want to
compare Australia with Japan are not
only often badly informed about Japan;
often they are also uncertain and con-
fused about the distinctive characteris-
tics of their own country. At one
extreme some of us tend to deny that
Australia has much in the way of dis-
tinctive differences. At the other extreme
some of us see Australia as unique. But
what both extremes —and the middle—
frequently do not do is to make any
attempt to assess Australia as a modern,
industrialised, highly developed society,
although in some ways urbanisation,
low proportion of work force employed
in farming, per capita GNP, etc. —we
score more highly than almost anyone
else. So for an Australian to compare
Australia with Japan can sometimes be
little more than the exercise of setting
up one mystery against the other.
In making a few comparisons, let us
begin with education. This gives an
alarming example of how the Japanese
can be more “modern” than we are. A
very high regard for general education,
especially advanced education, and a
special emphasis on technical training
seem to be essential characteristics of
a technological society. By this test
Japan and Australia live in different
worlds. Of the prosperous, industrialised
societies, Australia is probably at the
bottom so far as a belief in education
is concerned. Japan is probably at the
top. A Japanese family saves and
scrapes so that it can buy its children
a good education. An Australian family
takes in education as one of those free
services it gets, like garbage collection,
and there is still often a distrust of
educated persons. Seventy percent of
Japanese children have a full secondary
education: we get by with about half
that proportion. Sixteen percent of
Japanese youth have a college or univer-
sity education of some kind, and in a
few years 30 percent of young Japanese
coming on the labor market will have
received some form of tertiary educa-
tion, while we get by with about a
third of that. Whereas, like the British,
we still cling to an elitist concept of
education as something in which, above
all,, certain standards must be main-
tained, the Japanese, like the Ameri-
cans, see it as important that as many
people as possible should have some
contact with higher education, some of
it very good, some of it not so good.
And while the Japanese eagerly give a
technical bias to their education,
although also fostering other sides, we
cling more determinedly, with a kind
of “oriental” traditionalism, to the idea
that the most honorific subjects are
necessarily those that are of no practical
use.
While we still tend to see education
as different from, or even an enemy of,
practicality the Japanese pin their whole
prospect of material prosperity on edu-
cated men —as business executives, as
officials, and even as politicians. Many
of the present leaders of private or
government bureaucracies in Australia
would have no chance of reaching simi-
lar positions in Japan—because their
examination results were not good
enough. In Japan, if you don’t do well
in examinations, you are almost certain
to be kept at a low level of influence.
There is an almost complete insistence
now on a “scholastic meritocracy” of a
kind that many of our Top People
would dismiss as impractical eggheadism
but which has been associated with the
most spectacularly fast economic growth


ever achieved by any nation. This sys-
tem does, of course, like any other
system, produce its absurdities. But it
has worked. It has produced far more
impressive results than have ever been
achieved by the Australian she’ll-be-
right school. And it means that one of
the most relevant differences between
an Australian and his Japanese opposite
number is not some matter of
physiognomy or folk culture, but that
the Japanese will almost certainly be
more expert —he’ll be better educated
and know more—and he’ll have behind
him a much more expert team than the
Australian.
The reason is that Japan has what has
been described as, and probably is, the
most sophisticated and most mathe-
matically minded bureaucracy in the
world—mankind’s greatest attempt to
apply intelligence when faced with
practical questions, brilliantly experi-
mental—and bold, brilliantly resource-
ful. There are clever men in our own
bureaucracies but they must often use
guile in disguising their intelligence as
they deal with men who prefer to fly
by the seat of their pants, and none of
them has behind him the depth of
analysis and expertness of a Japanese.
Government department. The clever
Japanese Government official can be
almost certain that age will bring him
influence, either within his bureaucracy,
or within industry or politics—because
there is a convention (which seems
strange to us) by which, once, out of the
men in their forties in a department
the new head has been chosen, his most
clever immediate contemporaries
thereupon resign, seeking positions of
equal rank in business or politics. By
this means an intelligent bureaucracy is
taking over the country.
Australians are now becoming fami-
liar with the fact that there are coun-
tries which, in their strange foreign way,
pay supreme regard to cleverness. What
is even more extraordinary to an Aus-
tralian about Japan is that this concern
with braininess is combined with a
stronger effective regard for looking
after your mates than we have ever been
able to achieve. In Japan big business
takes it as axiomatic that it should save
its employees from insecurity. The
management of a big firm has a much
greater commitment to its employees
than it has to its shareholders. Once a
wage earner joins such a firm, he has
a job for life. One of the first tasks
of management is to keep the firm
going so that this can be so. And, al-
though it horrifies American and West
European observers and so now some
of the Japanese themselves this
seems to be as successful an incentive
as increasing dividends.
To job security is added .the pro-
vision for many amenities, including
even housing, of a kind that we expect
employees to find for themselves out
of their own income. In addition an
employer has to see to it that his
employees go on getting raises as they
get older. A 55-year-old no-hoper may
get twice as much as an indispensable
35-year-old, irrespective of their re-
spective contributions to a firm’s
success. There is now a lot of grumbling
about this system among some of the
more American-influenced Japanese
executives and, of course, it has many
disadvantages. But, like the emphasis on
examinations, it has successfully chal-
lenged one of the conventional wis-
doms of western capitalism that skill
is best encouraged by money and that
you get the best out of people by
penalising the no-hopers.
What is particularly remarkable about
this system is that it seems highly likely
that to many ordinary Australians to
have job security for their working life-
times, with guaranteed raises as they get
older and a lump sum at the end, would
seem to be something as closely approxi-
mating heaven-on-earth as could be
achieved in an imperfect world. It
represents part of our dream of looking
after the underdog. Yet our own in-
heritance of wisdom from the ideology
of the old industrial revolution makes
us rebel against the practicability of
such an ideal—it is not supposed to
work. And so deeply are we still in-
grained with the idea that rewards have
to be “earned,” that to some Australians
there might even be some moral revul-
sion against the idea of men being, as
it were, rewarded for continuing to be
alive, rather than as production units.
Even more exotic is the lack of con-
cern that Japanese businessmen show
about maximising profits. This may
come partly from the fact that (another
conventional wisdom exploded!)
Japanese businesses often raise 70 to 80
percent of their funds in bank credit,
with only 20 to 30 percent of their capi-
tal coming from shareholders, so that
they don’t have to worry much about
the shareholder’s yen. But even more
important is that their reasons for being
businessmen —their measures of success
—are different. They are more socially
oriented than profit-oriented. In this
situation even maintaining a dividend
rate may be mainly a matter of a firm’s
honor. (Japan is, of course, not alone in
this, but the Japanese are more honest
about it.) What openly concerns them
more than profit is the security of their
workforce, their loyalty to their firm
or to the group of firms to which it
belongs, and, strangely enough, their
loyalty to Japan. In this situation total
production can be more important than
increasing profit. Success can be to pro-
duce more, not to make more money
out of what is already produced. Or
success may be to think of new products
to produce, even if innovation risks
lower profits. Or to fulfil some export
directive given by the Government
bureaucracy to maintain the interests
of the nation.
This produces what we would con-
sider uneconomic diversions of re-
sources. In particular, the gross ineffi-
ciency in distribution, which is built up
on a maze of two-bit satellite dealers to
whom there are traditional loyalties, is
the laughing stock of those who have
absorbed the economic wisdoms of the
West. There is no doubt that Australian
marketing, derived from British and
now from American models, is more
rational than the muddle of personal
relations and almost feudal obligations
with which Japanese firms perplex
themselves, sometimes in thousands of
separate negotiations. But the point
about the Japanese system is that,
overall, it works. And it irritates our
own conventions by solving the prob-
lems of production not by the profit
incentive but by an acceptance of social
and personal loyalties as a stimulus to
effort.
One of the strongest contrasts be-
tween Australia and Japan comes from
the matter of group loyalties. Aus-
tralians, following their own traditions,
proclaim their “individualism,” while
very largely following group conformi-
ties. But the group conformities of Aus-
tralia do not always, or even usually,
lead to action. They are not often
creative, and they sometimes stifle such
“individualism” as there is. The
Japanese make no pretence of in-
dividualism. They sometimes describe
themselves as ants. They think of them-
selves as members of groups, hierarchi-
cally arranged, but their group loyalties
drive them fiercely into creative action
so that a group, or that grouping of
groups that makes up Japan, produces
much more innovation in action than is
usual in our self-proclaimed “in-
dividualist” Australia. In Japan the
social merits of individualism are not
lost—they are produced by group action
rather than individual action; in Aus-
tralia, individualism is proclaimed as a
virtue, but we don’t see much of it in
action, and when we do it does not
always produce social merit.
Not that Australians have not also


professed group loyalties. Part of the
doctrine of mateship becomes in prac-
tice a group loyalty rather than an
expression of more universal brother-
hood. But there has been a curiously
stultifying effect in groups of Australian
mates: we usually gang up together
against something, rather than for some-
thing. There is a strong fear of danger
among Australians that makes us group
together in protection of the familiar
against the unfamiliar so that our
groups, when they form, often want to
stop change rather than to cause it.
Nevertheless, the group conformities
of both countries have led to a curious
parallel. Just as Australia, earlier in its
history, initiated government action in
many fields of enterprise, when to do so
was to affront the experience of most
of what were then the other modern
societies, so now the Japanese pioneer
new methods of ultimate Government
economic direction in which the main
task of big business is to manage firms
in a way that is commensurate with
final Government decisions. As the
Japanese deal increasingly with Aus-
tralia they will feel increasingly at home
among our Tariff Boards, Arbitration
Commissions, and export marketing
boards. What is likely to puzzle them is
not that a free market would be the
greatest single challenge to most Aus-
tralian economic institutions but that
our Government does not give firmer
overall direction.
Australia is a provincial, derivative
society thrown up by the expansionist
surgings of the old industrial revolution.
To a very large extent overseas enter-
prise simply migrated here and the
problems were mainly those of
adaptation. We exported raw materials
and, instead of importing most of our
consumer goods, we learned how to
force foreign firms to set up shop in
Australia. But most of the innovatory
processes of the industrial revolution
passed us by. We got our innovation at
second-hand and we got into the habit
of distrusting native innovation. In the
present technological revolution, in
which innovation is even more
important and in which knowledge
can literally be power, we don’t
know much. Our economy flour-
ishes because, compared with the
size of our population, we are unusually
rich in our variety of natural resources.
If one fails, another rises to take its
place. We look for our final protection
to great and powerful friends. With this
economic and strategic safety we tend
to form into groups which protect us
from the shocks of unfamiliarity,
although we also profess to be in-
dividualists.
Japan, by contrast, is national
rather than provincial. It is sui generis.
The industrial revolution was deliber-
ately imported into Japan by the Jap-
enese themselves, at first imitatively,
but now the Japanese are highly
original. Their prosperity is due almost
entirely to their own cleverness. They
are poor in raw materials but remark-
ably good at making things. In the
new technological revolution they are
the first of the “capitalist” nations to
put themselves almost fully into the
hands of a technocracy, in a period
in which not so much the old entre-
preneurial business and marketing
skills as knowledge and intelligence
seem to be the essential bases of pros-
perity. Whereas we live with at least
short-term certainties, the Japanese
have passed through one of the greatest
smashings-up of certainty in a revolu-
tionary century. The groups into which
they form are not defensive, but out-
ward-directed and oriented to success.
To compare the two countries in this
way is not to pass moral judgments on
them. That is a quite different matter.
What the comparison dramatises is
that, so far as Japan is concerned, in
the kind of world we are moving into,
Australia may be a pushover.
This does not necessarily matter. So
far, in fact, things have gone our way.
The Japanese have taken over hand-
somely from the British in buying our
wool. It was Japanese demand more
than any other single factor that is
now revolutionising us as an exporter
of minerals. By the early 1970 s about
two-thirds of our exports of iron ore
will go to Japan and by the same time
we shall be supplying about two-thirds
of the coking coal used by Japanese
industry. When it comes to productive
local investment the Japanese, unlike
the Americans, are not whole-hoggers.
They are more likely to be satisfied with
a shared venture in which both Jap-
anese and Autralians have a say. And
since, for the moment, anyway, Japan
can hardly be said to have a diplo-
macy, we are not being pushed into
unwelcome diplomatic initiatives.
The present honeymoon can’t last, of
course. But, even so, it might be fairly
gentle going. The Japanese continue to
complain that what we buy from Japan
is only about one half of what we sell
her, but to buy more from Japan need
impose no hardship on us. It could
mean mainly that we buy less capital
goods from the British. It does not
necessarily mean that we have to swop
our raw materials for cheap Japanese
consumer goods. When Japanese exports
include machinery, chemicals, and so
forth it can mean instead that we buy
producer goods from them so that we
can make consumer goods here. Of
course we won’t be able to get away
altogether with our present low rate of
imports of consumer goods from Japan.
But, in some cases, all this might-mean
is that they set up plants here in com-
petition with plants run by other over-
seas firms, and, in other cases, that we
import goods that we are particularly
inefficient in manufacturing ourselves
or that we now import from some other
country.
Of course, in becoming increasingly
dependent on Japan as the place we
sell things to, our prosperity is
dependent on hers. But what else can
we do? Sell the same things to someone
else? We can’t, otherwise we would be
doing it now. Japan is becoming our
best customer, because Japan wants to
buy the things we sell. If Japan goes
broke, we go broke. But what can we
do about it? Not sell them? That makes
us broke now. There may also be ten-
sions for us if, in the future, Japan
looks to Australia as a diplomatic ally.
In some ways, in so far as they have a
foreign policy at all, the Japanese may
already see Australia in some such
light. It seemed significant that in
expressing the concept of the Asia-
Pacific Community this year the
Japanese looked first to Australian
reaction. But if Japan looks on us for
diplomatic support it will not be a new
experience for us that a great and
powerful friend seeks our backing.
In any friendly economic and diplo-
matic relationship between countries
there are possibilities of disaster. In our
long dependence on Britain we im-
ported British depressions and fought in
European wars. In our alliance with
America we depend on American
prosperity and are called on to pay the
price of alliance in Asian wars. If we
want to avoid relations with other
States we should increase our popula-
tion tenfold, go through a technological
revolution, manufacture - everything we
want ourselves, and match the U.S.A.
and Russia in our nuclear stockpile! If
we weren’t going to become increasingly
dependent on Japan we would have to
try to find someone else.
But to .say this is not to say that we
should not now be thinking about our
future relations with Japan. For
example, it might make more sense if
we now spent some time worrying not
about whether Britain goes into the
Common Market but about what would
happen to us if Japan does not keep
up her present rate of economic growth.
(A slowing down of Japanese expansion
would now hurt us more than British
entry into Europe.) And as well as
worrying about the decline in British
and American investment in Australia
we should start worrying about how to
attract more Japanese investment. As
well as talking a great deal about our
“growing involvement with Asia” we
should also think more specifically about
our growing involvement with Japan,
which sees itself more as a world indus-
trial power than as an Asian country,
and which, in South-East Asia, may see
us as its main ally, mairlly because we
are not “Asian.” As well as seeing our
immigration policy as a way of keeping
out unskilled Asians we should now
ponder its effect as a policy that could
keep out Japanese, who are more
skilled than we are. It is extraordinary
that we are not more firmly encouraging
the teaching of the Japanese language
in schools and universities. Perhaps it
is just as extraordinary that, so far as
secondary and tertiary education goes,
we are happy to remain half as
educated as the Japanese.

An interview
in London with
Stokely Carmichael
By COLIN McGLASHAN
“I GUESS what I hate was that I
wanted to be white. We used to have
a game in Trinidad you took a
mango skin and threw it in the air. If
it fell with the brown skin showing
it meant you would marry a brown-
skinned girl. I kept throwing that
mango in the air and hoping it’d come
down with the white inside facing up
so I’d marry a white girl.”
Did he ever have a relationship with
a white girl?
“Just once when I was at high school
in New York. It was more platonic
than sexual. It was a very, very impor-
tant relationship for me. I wanted to
ask the girl out, but I was so afraid it
would upset her morality and she would
insult me and I wouldn’t know what
to do.
“Well, I tried to figure out what to
say, what to talk about. We went on
the subway together, that’s when it
really started, everyone looking at us.
I think she was conscious of this, but
acted as if she weren’t. I was conscious
of it and got hung up. I just kept stut-
tering. We went to a school dance. I
remember the looks of my teachers—l
was hitting the real taboo, the white
woman.”
Carmichael grew up with two sisters,
three aunts, and a grandmother at the
top of 42 steps in the best house in
Oxford Street, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.
His father, a carpenter, built it, then
left to work in the United States. Car-
michael did not see his parents from
the time he was two until he joined
them in New York at 12.
The striking thing is that England
and an English-style education made
Carmichael and govern his thinking
today; he gets really angry about it.
Aged ten, he was wearing the grey
serge trousers, stiff white shirt, and
long stockings of Tranquillity Boys’
School. He says he once stood for four
hours to wave a Union Jack at royalty,
and meant it. He admits that he still
has not forgiven himself. “I’m angry
because I was drugged by white
supremacy and I didn’t rebel. I’m mad
because the people I admired in the
West Indies didn’t rebel, either. They
forced it all down my throat.
“At school we were made to mem-
orise Kipling’s ‘White Man’s Burden,’
told we didn’t exist until a white man
named Sir Walter Raleigh discovered
us, and we went to the movies and
yelled for Tarzan to beat the hell out
of Africa.”
In England a fortnight ago at
meetings in Hackney, Notting Hill,
Brixton, and elsewhere Carmichael’s
bitter memories of a West Indian child-
hood reached and moved his audiences.
“If you ask a black child any place
in the West Indies about the Nile
Valley or Hannibal he doesn’t know
anything about it, but he can get up
and tell you who was king, who was
queen, who was king . . .”
He ignored a newspaper report of
one of his London meetings BLACK
POWER VIOLENCE CALL to
stare for a full minute at photographs,
of Princess Margaret. “They’re still
lining up for her. I don’t see why.”
“My father,” said Carmichael, “was
submissive, quiet, and obedient, every-
thing I’m not. He believed what the
white man told him: if you work hard
you will succeed. He died like he came
into the world, poor and black. Well,
work wasn’t for me. If I wasn’t in the
movement I’d be a gangster.
“My father did three jobs at a time,
carpenter, then odd jobs, then drove a
taxi at night. We only saw him on
Sundays. He was very religious. I went
to Sunday school and church until I
was 15 and then I cut it loose.”
Carmichael remembers his father
being out of work for three weeks
because he was too honest to bribe the
union representative to find him a job.
“My mother went and hustled 50
dollars, then she invited the representa-
tive to the house and gave him the
money and some expensive perfume.
My father got a job and said, ‘That’s
what happens when you pray to God.’
My mother is a fighter—if she wanted
something she’d just take it.”
He talked about his teenage years
on the streets of Harlem and the Bronx.
“We stole cars, batteries, hub-caps, then
we got together and started knocking
off candy stores. I did the planning. I
was pushing pot at 16—they wouldn’t
let you push cocaine until you were
21.”
Apart from his upbringing, one of the
main influences on him has been Mal-
colm X, the black nationalist leader
assassinated in Harlem three years ago.
Many of his speeches echo Malcolm
X’s thinking: on the need for black
pride, for example. “We must see our-
selves as beautiful people. We keep
thinking the only thing that is beautiful
is white, a chick with long, blond
hair. We’ve got to understand that we
have thick lips and flat noses and curly
hair and we’re black and beautiful.
And we’re not going to imitate the white
man any more.”
Carmichael calls Malcolm X “my
patron saint.” Malcolm’s photograph
hangs over the desk in his Atlanta,
Georgia, headquarters, next to a poster
of Snick’s leaping black panther. “Move
cir pver or we’ll move on over YOU.”
“I admitted his intelligence, his
analytical mind, his forthrightness, and
his willingness to begin to move to
bring his people together. The thing
most of us young grads got from Mal-
colm was that he spoke to his people.
He stopped speaking to whites.
“Yes, I’ve a lot of white friends, but
I don’t equate my friendships with
white people on how they see the black
political ideology. The trouble with
white liberals, every time you sit down
to talk with them they want to talk
about race. It isn’t the type of friend
I want. I just want to sit down so we
can dig Thelonious Monk or talk about
Bach or Joyce.”
What did he do if he was walking
with a white girl and a white man
called her a prostitute?
“I guess I just keep walking. You’d
just get into a long debate or a fight
and I’m not sure it’s worth fighting
over.”
How did that square with his ideas
about not turning the other cheek?
“I can’t fight the individual battle,
I’m fighting institutionalised racism. My
job is not to allow the white man to
define my attitudes.”
He shrugged off discussion of the uses
of violence.
“The white man is talking about
violence. Did he talk about violence
when he raped Africa? They say Black
Power means violence. The white man
has been violent to us for 400 years.


If we are violent to him he deserves
every bit.
“It’s totally irrelevant to talk about
violence in a world like this. People die
of hunger every day when there’s food
in the world: that’s violence. The In-
dian Government is going to force
people to be sterilised. That’s worse
than shooting a man to death, but
nobody sees that as violent. The British
Government thinks it’s good.
“They say I’m a rabble-rouser and
inciting to riot because when I speak
to a black audience I don’t reason or
intellectualise. There’s no need, they
know it instinctively and emotionally.
For example, they know police brutality
—with whites, you’ve got to get out the
case reports.”
What about the recent riots?
“We don’t call them riots they’re
rebellions. I’ve been involved in eight.
They should use that killing as a politi-
cal death. It should be a revenge so that
white society should know it can’t go
on shooting people in the streets, but
also a political act so the struggle goes
on.
“The death game is what they play
to scare us: look, you lost 21, we only
lost two, you’d better stop. Well, Snick
is respected because if we say “Burn,
baby, burn!” we’ll be the first people
to strike a match. The closeness in Watts
and Newark now is something 100
years couldn’t bring about. Yes, I think
I could shoot a white policeman in a
black man’s area because I don’t think
he’s any business there. If a man’s stand-
ing on your toe and you’ve petitioned,
begged, pleaded, done every possible
thing and he won’t move, you’ve got to
push him off.
“You can have peace in the U.S. for
400 years if every time a white man
wants something he says, ‘Nigger, do
this,’ and the black man does it. That’s
peace. Yah.”
How did he see the future? Did
he expect white counter-violence?
“The U.S. can’t use an H-bomb
against black people inside the U.S.
If they surround the ghettos we will
blow up every damn thing they build;
we will blow our country to the ground
if they mess with us.”
Carmichael says he has been in jail
35 times, eight times for inciting to
riot. He has been shot at eight times,
too. “Never hit me—too, too fast!” But
three years ago, a close friend was shot
behind the wheel of Carmichael’s car.
He has let no one drive it since. He has
been beaten up more times than he
can remember, and rolls back his
sleeve to show fresh scars he says came
from a police pistol barrel a fortnight
ago.
Earlier this year, Carmichael pre-
dicted that he wouldn’t live through
the summer. How did he see his
chances now of being killed like Mal-
colm X?
“That’s the dilemma they face. They
made a mistake with Malcolm and
made him a martyr. They face the
problem of killing me or putting me
in jail. That’s one of the reasons they
didn’t draft me.”
Meanwhile, he is never without body-
guards. In Mississippi or Watts they
might carry guns beneath nationalist
uniforms; in London his protection
was unobtrusive.. One man guarding
him said: “I don’t want anybody to
know my name. If he’s going to die
I’m going to die with him. They’ll
have to shoot both of us.”
Carmichael believes he can still edge
out of his fame. “People fix on indi-
viduals because it’s easier than with a
movement. But anyone in the organisa-
tion could do what I do. The name
Stokely Carmichael was the invention
of the White Press. I’ll not live up to
the rules they make for me.”
He says that the growing personal
limelight was one reason he quit re-
cently as Snick’s chairman: “I’m going
to try to make my name irrelevant. I
try to do that with black people all
the time. My job is to take all the
admiration and love other black people
give me and try to spread it around
among us.”
Carmichael’s description of his politi-
cal aims has changed in recent months.
He used to define his advocacy of “black
power” as meaning simply that Negroes
should hold office in Negro areas. Now
he says, “It means the coming together
of black people to fight for their libera-
tion by any means necessary, to quote
brother Malcolm.
He returned to the U.S. last week
to aim for Snick’s most ambitious
target: Washington, which has a Negro
majority. Black men, he says, should
run the cities where they’re in a
majority: “There’s nothing wrong with
living in a black ghetto if you’re free
from oppression. It won’t be apartheid,
because we won’t say white people can’t
come in.”
How did Britain fit into this picture?
“Black men in Britain should start to
see themselves as West Indians, part
of the third world, not as British.”
Guerilla warfare in the Caribbean,
he adds, would put pressure on Britain.
He intends to go home to Trinidad
next February, but sees Jamaica as a
likelier first target.
At 26, and reluctantly, Stokely Car-
michael is inheriting Malcolm X’s
throne the world’s chief symbol of
black militancy. He still needs to grow
into this role as Malcolm X him-
self grew into it during his last year.
Carmichael’s tragedy and his people’s
may be that the world will give him
neither the time nor the understanding
he needs.


When an author
turns professional
From R. J. SCHOLFIELD
in London
HUGH ATKINSON was sitting in the
sun behind the villa he has taken among
the mountains and olives of inland
Majorca, sipping occasionally from a
glass of ulcer milk on a marble table
beside him. At the table was another
Australian, Robert Close, in retreat
from his Paris home to write a book.
They were comparing old times in jail
—Atkinson as a conscientious objector
in Long Bay before serving in the
RAAF during World War 11, Close a
little later in Pentridge as the author
of the famous obscene novel “Love Me,
Sailor.”
Every few minutes Atkinson left Close
an 1 the milk to stroll over to a giant
cactus bush and note what progress
was being made by a colony of wasps
building a nest among the bloated,
rubbery leaves.
His fascination was apt, for during
the past two years he himself has been
frantically gathering and building. The
result is a book, due out soon, that is
as precisely calculated as any wasps’
nest. And, if it is the success it is
planned to be, it will make Atkinson
rich for the first time in his 42 years.
The book may hoist him to the ranks
of that current literary phenomenon,
the authors of king-size works of fiction
based on international events that are
assured, on market-research principles,
of popularity. If it does it will represent
for him a radical change of course.
With only three other books behind
him, his previous writings have been
sparse, private, and unprofitable. This
one was a verbal cataract, conceived
and executed almost by committee, and
so assured of triumph that juicy Holly-
wood offers have been glancing off it
in a way that makes Atkinson regard
his agents with a mixture of trust and
terror.
The book is about the Olympic
Games, and its publication in various
forms and places has been planned to
a nicety to ride home on the wave of
interest generated by the liext Olym-
piad, in Mexico City.
The genesis of it, like that of the
Games themselves, is misty, for it
began at a party when his latest novel,
“The Reckoning,” had for a time
opened London’s literary doors to him.
“I think it was Doris Lessing’s house,”
he recalls. “People were talking about
best-sellers, especially those ghastly,
contrived American things like ‘The
Carpetbaggers’ and ‘The Prize,’ and
Hugh Atkinson ... every Friday a
holiday in the head
someone said, ‘Of course, these things
are limited to subjects, and all the sub-
jects have been done.’
“Apparently I said: ‘The biggest and
most obvious contrived subject in the
world, which has never been touched,
is the Olympic Games.’ I was fairly full
at the time, which accounts for the
fact that I couldn’t remember the next
day when an agent phoned and said
what a bloody good idea I had for a
big ‘faction’ novel. I flannelled on for
a while, and then said ‘excuse me’ and
ran to Phoebe and said, “I’ve got this
agent on the phone who reckons I’ve
got a good idea. What the hell was I
talking about last night?’ She remem-
bered, and it grew from there.”
It wasn’t all that spontaneous. Some
time before, Atkinson had read some-
thing in the “Observer” by Herb Elliott
about the climate of pain four-minute
milers go through, with their almost
religious hallucinations and mental dis-
location. He went further into the sub-
ject with the intention of writing a few
short stories about it, but there, had
it not been for the phone call after
the London literary party, the matter
might have rested.
Publishers in Britain and the U.S.
snapped the idea up promptly, as
though able to set their slide rules by
it and tot up the profits. Atkinson col-
lected a fat advance, moved with it,
beyond range of British tax men and
London distractions, to Guernsey, and
hired Phillip Knightley, former Mel-
bourne and Sydney journalist, and now
of the “Sunday Times,” as collaborator
and researcher.
The two got down to grinding out a
synopsis. In a room of the three-storeyed
house in which Atkinson installed him-
self and family, looking out to sea
across the roof of what used to be
Victor Hugo’s home, the two would
closet themselves sharp at nine each
morning, six days a week, and after
six weeks of concentration, sometimes
in the form of long, difficult silences,
they had hatched a blueprint for the
publishers who hovered over the project.
That done, Knightley plunged into
18 months of research that took him
all over Europe and into the thickest
Olympic archives and the deepest
Olympic intrigues. He was after not
only the factual framework for Atkin-
son to hang the meat of the story on,
but also the Games skulduggery, which
he found to be rife. He stalked sources
like a sleuth, picking up trails in old
magazines and pursuing them through
half a dozen cities. Interviews were
sometimes so fragile that he would
hide a tape-recorder in a nearby lava-
tory, load his memory until it was
bursting, and then, excusing himself,
dash to the toilet and disgorge it on
to tape. The research itself made a
book of 80,000 words, and leaves
Knightley and Atkinson as the world’s
best-informed pair on the seamy side
of international athletics. Much of it,
of course, cannot be printed. As Atkin-
son says: “With a book of this kind it
is not so much what you put in as
leave out, but you can leave out only
if you know it.” He says 75 percent of
the research was thrown away.
So Atkinson, who had hitherto
approached writing with much purity
of purpose, ordering his commercial
life in advertising so that he could
write as he wanted without gearing it
to income by so much as one cog, turned
singlemindedly to money.
It proved less corrupting than he
might have expected. “At first it
seemed cold-blooded,” he says, “but as
I became concerned with the actual
structure of it I could see that it didn’t


necessarily mean the kind of limitations
one had envisaged, that I could still
write and think as well as I was able
inside that structure. A different style,
of course, came with the speed needed
for a story of this kind, which is to
do in many ways with exteriors rather
than interiors. And one cannot be
concerned in the same way with a
big book as a short one.”
It was sovereignty rather than
integrity that he lost, for with big
advances coming his way and all kinds
of guarantees and rosy possibilities in
the offing, Atkinson found himself
ringed in by editors whose considera-
tions became his, because he was their
property.
The timetable for this novel-with-an-
appointment was such that in less than
nine months’ writing time he put down
220,000 words, standing, as is his prac-
tice, at a sloping drawing board and
writing in long-hand on very large
sheets of paper, and, with virtually no
revision, which he normally does on a
typewriter, dictating each chapter on
to tape and flying it off to London.
He kept no copies, so if the mails had
gone wrong or a plane crashed there
would have been trouble.
The book has four parallel settings—
in Britain, America, Australia, and
India. Atkinson spent four years in
India. In 1957 he had to get out, if
he were to remain uncalloused enough
to write. India, scene of his most suc-
cessful novel, “The Pink and the
Brown,” today tugs at him more than
any other place, for the feelings its
misery stirred in him still itch, and he
must scratch them with a return. He
intends to visit Bihar Province next
month, and then Vietnam, to get
material for his next book, another
conceived in the Olympics mould, its
subject the Red Cross and human suf-
fering.
Majorca, where he now lives, is
giving him not only an interlude of
sun and light but some of the characters
and flavors of his next book. In the
interests of discipline and duodenum,
the converted farmhouse he occupies
with his wife, Phoebe, young children,
Jason and Rachel, and a special exotic
cat bred by poet Robert Graves is the
Majorcan equivalent of “Back o’
Bourke.” But every Friday he goes to
town and has what he calls a holiday
in the head, doing the rounds of bars
in Palma’s Terreno district of beats and
drifters, who fascinate him. Phoebe
always drives home.
Atkinson likes drop-outs and their
motives don’t concern him. “It is almost
impossible to describe at any moment in
time why you are feeling as you are
and what reasons you have for doing
things. The witch’s knitting in back
of you is so complex that nobody is
going to unravel it. I’m a once-a-week
drop-out.”
Australia does not summon him as
India does, even though, having written
since childhood, his earliest perceptions
were fed on the most irreplaceable
aspect of it, the outback.
“I know that with some writers and
other artistic Australians who come to
Europe there is an enormous need to
go back, especially among painters, who
miss the landscape reference. I don’t
feel this at all. One will, of course,
return in due course, but I let circum-
stances carry me completely.”
Something Atkinson does not at all
miss is Australia’s literary sensibility.
His despair of it was made complete by
the reactions to his last novel, “The
Reckoning.”
“I was utterly concerned about every-
thing and wanted to get as much sense
as possible into the white space between
A novel about
the squalor
behind the
ideal of the
Olympic Games
the lines, but nobody in Australia
seemed to think the book was of any
significance whatever. Some of the
English critics did, and the French
most certainly did, reaffirming to me
that I couldn’t have been all that wrong.
Some saw a Jesus Christ analogy
which was ever so slightly in my own
mind and others called it the first
Existentialist novel written in the new
world. I don’t know if this was true, but
it was their response to what I was
trying to do. They might have accused
me of falling short of my objectives,
but at least there was understanding.
In Australia, nobody had the faintest
idea what the book was about.
“It is the same with friends of mine
at home. Xavier Herbert’s ‘Soldiers’
Women’ was misjudged, and look what
happens to Hal Porter, even though he
and Patrick White have become sacred
cows there. His stuff is literally not
understood at all, and when it is praised
it is for the wrong reasons.
“Take Henry Lawson, one of the
greatest short-story writers of all time.
Every Australian schoolboy knows the
ballads inch by inch, but who knows his
short stories in Australia? The Russians
think he is as good as Gorky, and the
French include him in anthologies of
short-story masters.
“In Britain there are people who
read Australian reviews because it is
a good market for books, and I know
several top names in England who read
them because their books are selling
there, but they think of them, with one
or two exceptions in Melbourne and
Sydney, as a monumental giggle.
Donald Horne describes it as a great
mediocrity, and this is probably true.”
“The Games” has too much flesh and
blood to be overlooked even in Aus-
tralia. Much of it is about politics,
the manoeuvring for building contracts,
the squalor behind the ideal. But the
core of the story remains the mystical
oddity of the great athlete trying to be
better than he is, the kind whose fas-
cination for Atkinson is reflected in the
words of a trainer, who said a great
miler should take himself to the point
where, if the tape were moved back 15
yards from where he expected it to
be, he would die before he hit it.
As to just how much he stands to
make from “The Games” the title
adopted in obedience to the current
stark vogue rather than Atkinson’s own
choice, “See How They Run”
Atkinson says he understands it is no
longer possible to become rich on just
one book, and that not even Robbins
did so. But he would not guarantee to
stay poor if he pulled it off twice.


OVERSEAS
Is Soekarno really
in the race again?
IS BUNG KARNO really in the race
again? How much fire is there behind
the smoke of Suharto’s recent moves
which are in such contrast to the former
tolerance of the Acting President in
matters concerning his predecessor?
Some indications of a stiffer wind
blowing across Indonesian waters are
evident. A long-awaited anti-corruption
campaign appears to lie behind the
recent declaration of the Information
Minister, Mr. B. M. Diah, announcing
the Government’s dismissal of 30 offi-
cials of the customs bureau, seven offi-
cials of the State revenue office, and
nine of the pension bureau (these latter
for allegedly embezzling pensions of the
widows of servicemen). Measures have
also been taken against several State
bank officials—six of them relieved, 37
suspended, and 34 others dismissed.
The big shots have not yet come
under fire, however. The Government
has still to prove its determination to
punish the high-echelon wrongdoers.
The pressure of public opinion is rising
—the slowness in decision-making and
in reform is especially vexing to many
Indonesians —so the present softness
may be replaced by a sweeping purge.
Until the announcement of the
arrests, no clear-cut evidence had been
given by the military commanders of an
imminent Bung Karno comeback. He is
trying to leave the golden cage visit-
ing old comrades-in-arms in the hos-
pital, inspecting monuments, receiving
guests but his performance is just
a shadow of the old days when the
gifted showman sold himself as the
great leader of Indonesia and the rest
of the world. “Babe (‘father’ in the
Djakarta dialect) has become old” was
the workers’ comment when the bald-
ing Sukarno, flanked by two female
guards, made a surprise visit to the Air
Force monument recently. Sukarno’s
doctors have again mentioned his
kidney ailment and this conveniently
became the public reason for the an-
nouncement that Suharto would deliver
the traditional address on the National
Day, August 17, instead of Sukarno,
Despite the rumpus, the chances of a
successful attempt by Sukarno to return
to power seem very remote. Indications
are that the military’s recent resolute
statements are not directed against
Sukarno as an individual but against a
potential nucleus around which opposi-
tion groups may crystallise. Interroga-
tion of newly captured communist
leaders has revealed that their tactic is
a “Sukarno-front of all progressive
people.” The Partai Nasional Indonesia
(PNI), which had on its 40th anniver-
sary in mid-July praised Bung Karno
as the founder of the Party and the
creator of Marhaenism, issued a later
statement under pressure from anti-
Sukarno elements calling the People’s
Congress decision in March to remove
Sukarno from power as “wise.” Very
recent reports from East Java told of
SUHARTO ... opposition definitely increased
the arrest of PNI members for alleged
communist sympathies.
Opposition to General Suharto’s
Ampera Cabinet—one year old on July
25—has definitely increased, mainly due
to the lenient policies of General
Suharto in domestic affairs (which has
led some groups to doubt his resolve);
the rising anger over the Government’s
velvet-gloved handling of corruption
and smuggling, and the absence of any
notable improvement in the living con-
ditions of the masses.
There is, indeed, some fire causing
the smoke, but any sensational con-
clusions about a sudden collapse of the
Suharto administration simply do not
correspond with reality. A certain
amount of opposition need not be sen-
sationalised—w'hy should Indonesia sud-
denly develop into the ideal state with-
out any contradictions in its pluralistic
society?
De Gaulle
Not senile
CONTRARY to what many of his
compatriots are thinking, the 76-year-
old President of France is neither
senile nor daft.
His advancing age, which has sud-
denly become much more physically
conspicuous in the past few months, has
not weakened his mental grip. It has
simply exacerbated, almost to the point
of caricature, certain of his already
remarkable attributes: a driving sense
of his own historical destiny; implacable
self-righteousness; an obstinate refusal
to listen to advice; and a political
acumen which drives much younger
adversaries to distraction.
Last week he let the Government say
publicly what officials were already
privately whispering: that the identity
of the General’s phrase “Vive le
Quebec libre” and the slogan of the
separatist movement were purely coinci-
dental; that he would not dream of
interfering in Canada’s internal affairs
by telling Quebec in what form or
under what party its freedom could be
best expressed; that his frequent use of
the ancient formula “La Nouvelle
France” (which described French
Canada before the British captured it)
was only an historical allusion and in
no sense meant that France hoped to
regain sovereignty.
On the other hand the General
insists that everyone knew he was going
to Canada to boost French and
Canadian nationalism (or, as he put
it himself, to compensate for 200 years

of French neglect) and it was the
Federal Government and his own diplo-
mats who had insisted that if he came
to Canada, he must visit Ottawa, too.
He is supremely confident that he
struck a blow for French-Canadian
self-government, and that when it
comes his visit will be remembered
long after the row has blown over.
Among his political opponents there
is a deliberate campaign to build him
up as the image of the wicked and all-
powerful villain of Jarry’s play,
Roi Übu, the origiinal hero of sick
humor. But even if the General were
mad (as those who disagree with him
like to believe) there is certainly method
in his madness: the pattern follows an
inner consistency all of its own.
It starts with his intrinsic belief that
France needs partners in order to have
a real impact in big power politics
(which is all that interests him). Just
how he asserts France, and therefore
himself, has varied wildly during his
nine years of power. He started want-
ing to share tripartite rule over the
Western world with the United States
and the United Kingdom. More
recently he cast France as honest
broker between the Russians and
Americans, a policy which came apart
at Glassboro. He also tried to make
France leader of the Continental Six,
but failed when the French were
manifestly isolated at the summit-
conference in Rome.
To the General, “up the French”
means “down with the Anglo-Saxons”
but here, too, there is a Gaullist
rationale. As he sees it, world
equilibrium is currently being upset by
advancing American power; the
Russians have shown themselves unable
to help their friends in Vietnam and
in the Middle East; and whereas the
American public goads on its Govern-
ment to fight wars outside its own
territory, the Soviet people restrain their
leaders from ever going to war except
in self-defence.
The General envisages an assertive
French entity, working with the Russians
and the Third World, as a rallying point
for world resistance against American
hegemony.
Nor does he believe he can rely on
other “Anglo-Saxon” countries to help
restore the balance; for example, that
a United Canada might be the best
way of resisting U.S. domination on the
North American continent, or that
Britain’s entry into the Common Market
might help restore the transatlantic
equilibrium. The barbarians at the door
speak English.
On a number of major issues there
certainly is agreement between the
General and his informed public
opinion: they are as critical as he is
of many aspects of American policy,
notably of the Vietnam war; they
believe he is right in arguing that
British monetary problems provision-
ally preclude Britain from joining the
DE GAULLE ... method in his madness
Common Market; and though they are
well disposed toward Canada, which
is one of their favorite allies, they
are sympathetic to the social and lin-
guistic complaints of the French
Canadians.
Where the French do not go along
with the General is in believing that
France can any longer be separated
politically, economically, culturally, and
in human values from the increasingly
integrated Western community of like-
minded nations. Or, as a concomitant
of this, that the General can spit in
Mr. Pearson’s eye.
What has happened is that the
French body politic no longer responds
to General de Gaulle’s ultra-nationalist
and anti-materialist concept of French
glory. And if the General clings on
much longer, he risks dissipating the
dignity and prestige accumulated over
so many decades and ending up a
figure of fun.
Malaysia
Caution
MALAYSIA REFUSES to be part of
any anti-Communist military alliance,
but she is very keen to strengthen any
regional organisations that promise tan-
gible benefits. She is interested in
Mini-Commonwealths” held together
by cultural and economic bonds—not
ideological ones. This was made clear
by Mr. Mohammed Khir Johari, the
Minister for Education, who led the
Malaysian delegation to the recent
Ministerial Meeting of ASPAC (the
Asian and South Pacific Council) in
Bangkok, on his return to Kuala Lum-
pur. This view is, no doubt, responsible
for the inclusion in the joint com-
munique, issued after the meeting, of
the statement that “ASPAC was not
intended to be an exclusive body or one
directed against any State or group of
States.” Otherwise, Johari said, “they
would also join together and be anti-us,
and this would be like two trucks
loaded with dynamite heading toward
each other.”
As one might expect from a Govern-
ment that prides itself on its pragmatic
approach to problems, Kuala Lumpur
hopes by pursuing a non-sectarian policy
to be able to embrace in some associa-
tion such diverse outlooks as those of
Indonesia, Singapore, Cambodia, and
Thailand. The concept of an organisa-
tion in which independent nations can
find “common grounds in diversity,” as
Johari put it, is very akin to the philo-
sophy of the modern Commonwealth of
which Malaysia continues to be an
enthusiastic member.
Malaysia is also now concerned with
a suggested Greater South-East Asia
Economic Co-operation Organisation:
an enlarged ASA which would also
include Indonesia, Singapore, and Cey-
lon. Few doubt the importance of trying
to produce some concrete forms of
regional co-operation; moreover, it is
realised that any South-East Asian asso-
ciation which excludes Indonesia would
lose much of its significance. Malaysia’s
preference will be for a pragmatic, non-
aligned organisation which can achieve
positive results in the technical, com-
munications and educational spheres.
With ASPAC continuing to press for a
military commitment, it is likely that
the ASA Ministerial Conference to be
held in Kuala Lumpur from August
16-18 this year will be used to explore
fully the possibilities of an enlarged or
newly constituted ASA, non-political in
character and with Indonesia playing a
leading role.
Such problems will make Malaysia
move cautiously. A low-keyed approach
may be the best way of establishing a
new regional association on a sound
footing and ensuring that the emphasis
is on practical benefits rather than on
propaganda —international co-operation
is such a delicate infant that it must
not be overfed or overstimulated. A
“Mini-Commonwealth,” which guaran-
tees its members the maximum amount
of freedom, may provide the best
atmosphere in which to rear the infant
—and Malaysia is likely to be a tolerant
and pragmatic parent.

Need for courage
SO LONG AS 2650 political prisoners
swelter in the concentration camp on
the island of Yioura, it is hard to sug-
gest that the Western Press is making
too much of a fuss about the new
regime’s assaults on personal and politi-
cal freedom. But in Athens one also gets
an impression that some of the Govern-
ment’s actions since the coup of April
21, which have come under heavy fire
abroad, have found a fair degree of sup-
port at home. National exasperation
with the past years of perpetual political
seesawing could prove to be the
regime’s best hope for goodwill: a
Government that can provide some
degree of stability may be forgiven its
day of the long knives —if the exercise
is not repeated and the grosser crudities
of dictatorship are removed. The harsh
censorship imposed on newspapers and
culture since the coup is a nonsense.
But time alone should help to dis-
courage the Government from using a
field gun to drive away wasps.
It seems clear that the colonels are
here for as long as they choose to stay.
So the sooner they realise the security
of their own position, the better for
Greece. For only then can the most
unpleasant aspects of the present situa-
tion change. Greeks who formerly were
only too willing to talk to any stranger
about their politics are now afraid to
open their mouths. So long as the
informer system persists, with all its
opportunities for paying off grudges and
ingratiating oneself with the authorities,
everyone is conscious of the five-year
sentence for speaking against the
regime. The police are enforcing the
decree against gatherings of more than
five people pretty rigorously. But if the
colonels can summon up the courage to
not only draw up a new constitution
but agree to a date for implementing it
they might be remembered as no worse
than the many other military dictator-
ships of the past and present.
For Greece certainly needed clean-
ing up. The scale of over-staffing in
the civil service was fully revealed only
by the wave of sackings that followed
the coup. The Economics ministry
alone reckons to have got rid of 50
superfluous staff members. Everywhere
government offices have been shedding
droves of the “advisers” and “consult-
ants” who were there only because
someone’s cousin promised to vote for
someone else’s nephew. An attempt is
being made to end the black market in
taxi licences and the monopolies in
such services as bakeries by simplifying
the licensing system.
But while reform of this kind,
agonising enough in itself for a coun-
try that has run on influence and
favoritism as long as anyone can re-
member, may buy goodwill for the
regime, something more is needed: an
economic policy that works.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Hollywood survival course
By CHARLES HIGHAM
JUST BEFORE lunch-break, Sound
Stage Six, 20th Century-Fox studios:
through the massive whirling blades of a
wind-fan, leaves scatter across a replica
of a New York street, an electric light
sign, STAGE DOOR, winks forlornly
in an artificial twilight. Against the
door, a small figure in a bulky fur, fish-
net-stockinged, beats hard, calling a
woman's name. Now she sinks to her
knees. She screams, and the camera,
mounted on an enormous crane, swings
high toward the roof. Leaves whirl, the
fan spins more violently. The director,
Mark Robson, calls “cut” ...
It is near the end of shooting of
“Valley of the Dolls,” and Patty Duke,
as an actress arriving too late for her
own stage show, has expertly played the
same scene half a dozen times. A few
nights later, a party is held on one of
the more lavish sets to celebrate the
end of shooting. Chandeliers sparkle,
paint glows pink and blue, Roman
Polanski, tiny, sharp-eyed, and Beatle-
cut Polish director of “Knife in the
Water,” “Cul-de-Sac,” and “Repulsion,”
stops by for a few words about his new
witchcraft story for Paramount, and
Jacqueline Susann glitters into a series
of television interviews, sequined and
glowing like the star she is, poised in
front of a white piano, a spray of
flowers at her elbow, saying with
snapped-on precision over and over
again: “Hi, I’m Jacqueline Susann,
author of ‘Valley of the Dolls,’ and I’m
having a ball . . .” Women in white
uniforms like nurses serve great slices
of rare roast beef from steaming silver
dishes, the conversation is high-pitched,
sharp, intense, full of deals and divorces
and scandals. I meet Jacqueline
Susann’s husband, a television pro-
ducer, and she tells me that her new
novel, “The Love Machine,” is about
a television producer. “I’m a moralist,”
she says, eyes sharp with shrewdness
and excitement. “Australia? I took out
two words for Australia.” An earth-
tremor rattles the expensive dishes and
the chandelier crystals, but nobody
notices.
Next day, lunch at the top of a bank
building with Walter Reisch, celebrated
Hollywood writer (“Ninotchka” “Gas-
light, “Niagara”). The seats are bright
red, thickly studded with brass, and
everywhere brasswork shines with a
blinding glitter in the reflected light
from beyond the windows. A screaming
squabble in the lobby reminds one that
Susann ... a moralist
Americans never hesitate to air their
bedroom problems in public. Down
below we see Los Angeles, past threat-
ening and spiky potted plants, those
baleful vegetable presences in restaur-
ant after restaurant, hotel after hotel;
tall, white buildings, streets that stretch
away for scores of miles, the dun-brown
humps of the Hollywood Hills, olive
patches of gum trees. Those trees are,
far from the hysteria of that dreadful
restaurant, a pale reminder of the para-
dise southern California must once have
been.
The excitement of an end-of-shooting
party, the survival course of a Holly-
wood restaurant at 1 p.m.: these are
daily experiences, calling for strong
nerves and constitution of steel. Holly-
wood conversation is loud and high-
pitched, screwed up to an explosion
point of neurotic tension. Insecurity is
the very air these people breathe. Tans
are impeccable—real or helped—eyes
glitter with the darting round brilliance
of birds’ behind rimless spectacles. A
day of brutally hard work, the previous
night’s hangover supposedly conquered
by a Bloody Mary that smells like
petrol and looks like a haemorrhage,
then, at the cocktail hour, bird-baths of
Martinis, the liver gradually shrivelling
as the dinner hour approaches, and you
sit down to a charcoal-broiled steak,
dangerous as 400 cigarettes, a plaster-
ing of sauce that looks like boiled boot-
polish, chopped-up lettuce under a
slather of Thousand Island dressing, a
crumpled cherry pie, and even at
Chasen’s, The Brown Derby, or Peri-
nos’, costly meccas of the agents and
the stars, instant coffee.
No time here for the graces of life,
no time, either, for personal service:
waitresses frostily snap their requests
for orders, telephonists have voices like
ice-chips, a cool impersonality barely
masks a grim aggression. “It’s terrible,”
Rouben Mamoulian, creator on stage
of “Porgy and Bess,” “Oklahoma!” and
“Carousel,” director of such famous
films as “Applause” and “Love Me To-
night,” says over dinner at his beauti-
ful house in Beverly Hills, “terrible how
people here have learned to hate each
other.” You are always conscious of
hatred in Hollywood, and only the un-
failing courtesy and kindness of one’s
hosts —of enchanting people like
Connie Prinzmetal, widow of Jerry
Wald; Oscar Levant, pianist, wit, and
friend of Gershwin; Don Prince, once
manager of the great Helen Morgan;
David Bradley, historian, collector,
and director; Jean Negulesco, director
of “Johnny Belinda” and “The Mask
of Dimitrios,” giver of great parties;
Louise Blaine of Universal and Bob
Vogel of M.G.M. keep distress at
bay.
Greedy and ugly though so much of
it is, Hollywood still exerts a fascin-
ation. It and Los Angeles around it
are still the haven of a marvellous
variety of oddballs. Their hub is
Hollyw'ood Boulevard, its pavements
spangled with pink coral stars cele-
brating the names of the Hollywood
great, crammed with a melange of
seedy restaurants pretentiously done
out like grottoes or castle keeps, padded
with red or black leather, brassy and
full of a hard shine of lights in copper
or bronze candelabras punctured with
tiny holes. Shops are like shacks, and
the bookstores flourish pornography
with an amoral abandon that would
astonish Soho. Outside the Hollywood
Wax Museum, a labyrinth of sickly
figures representing the stars or torture
scenes from movies (a skeleton in a
cage has “Too Much Metrecal” printed
underneath), a life-size automaton
dances and jerks, tossing its head like
a spastic, dressed from top to toe in
a cherry-red brass-buttoned uniform
like someone in a military college
musical comedy; the passers-by poke
him in the stomach, but he doesn’t
react. His smooth, wax face and dead
button eyes disclose no hint of life.
Is he real? It doesn’t matter. Even
the passers-by look as though they are
made of wax or plastic, skin dead under
the soaking violet, pink, green, and
scarlet of the overhead neon signs.
Reality and unreality are inter-
changeable here. I visited John Franken-


heimer at the very house at Malibu that
his hero of “Seconds” went to in order
to escape reality in a new guise, Hitch-
cock’s cottage at Universal is like an
English country hideaway, complete
with sporting prints and Irish terrier
barking at the door. Every street you
turn, the biscuit-colored buildings look
like movie sets. Drive down the coast
past the giant toppling sandhills of
Malibu, the long fringe of wind-whipped
palm trees at Santa Monica Beach, and
you have seen it all a thousand times
before, in film after film. As you pass
the low-lying wooden restaurants of
Malibu, you think you will see Joan
Crawford or Bette Davis, symbols of
Hollywood’s lost greatness, driving out
of one of them in a convertible, head-
ing for some pistol-packing encounter
in the mink-and-diamond belt of Bel
Air or West Los Angeles.

RESTFUL I SPEAK FROM EX-
PERIENCE (this topped by a smiling
woman): the signs glitter in the smog-
filtered sunshine along Santa Monica,
Hollywood, and Beverly Boulevards as
you drive to the ocean. The roads rib-
bon away forever, and the buildings
grow more and more anonymous, boxes
of drab concrete, interrupted by rows
and rows of one-storey shops made
apparently of cardboard, and fronted
by the endless spinning pink or violet
electrical signs.. A visit to the 20,000
block seems unremarkable in streets
which have scores of thousands of
buildings interrupted by parking lots,
crammed solid. No trees grow in the
main boulevards, and the only specks
of green are in the windows of restaur-
ants or in the tall, potted plants of
ritzy apartment blocks, sheltered behind
candy-striped awnings. Toward the
airport the freeways loop and curve
in their complex geometrical patterns,
a restaurant like a flying saucer re-
volves on concrete spokes, and not far
away the sinister locust heads of the
oil pumps nod away into the distance
across sandhills and valleys.
It is all dead flat and featureless,
relieved only by the Hollywood Hills,
Coldwater Canyon, and the gently ris-
ing mounds of Bel Air and Beverly
Hills, suburbs decorated along the road-
sides with banks of ivy so that no naked
earth can be seen, each house seem-
ingly unoccupied, Home Beautiful, and
ready for the admiration of guests
rather than for the comfort of the
occupants. Palms are perfectly groom-
ed, flanking the streets, regular as
sentries and all of the same height.
The luxury has that kind of bland
perfection that cancels itself out. Costs
are dizzying: I can remember attend-
ing one party at which someone was
discussing how much the house we
were in would sell for (“I think we’d
get $180,000.” “More, it’s on flat
ground”). At the other end of the
scale are the Negro and Spanish slums
of downtown: Watts, with its shabby
lines of bungalows, its eerie towers
made of an assemblage of junk by a
famous artist, the collapsing mess of
the worst ghettoes. But the business
section, one uniquely ugly and squalid,
has lately been given a boost: the
Music Centre, a shiny complex of
buildings created by the Los Angeles
“Times,” the electricity building (it-
self consuming a fortune in wattage),
and several new banks and insurance
buildings shine with frosty splendor in
the middle of the old, brown archi-
tectural garbage dump around them.
The best places in Los Angeles can
be afforded only by the very wealthy.
In Sydney the city’s incomparable
natural resources are for everyone to
enjoy. In Los Angeles many of the
beaches have been subdivided for pri-
vate homes.
There are almost no outdoor or in-
door public swimming-pools. Golf is
incredibly expensive. Buses seem de-
signed for the public total discomfort,
and travelling in them is a torture: you
rattle the exact change into a machine
beside the driver, and he issues you
with a token; every few minutes the
bus stops while he collects the tokens.
The buses crawl seemingly inch by inch,
expensive and far more uncomfortable
than their Sydney counterparts. But the
fact is that almost nobody uses them:
only Negroes, janitors, and tourists.
But for all its exasperations, the
poisonous smog that fills your brain
with cottonwool and . the vile food,
the squabbles and the pace, Los
Angeles does induce a feverish excite-
ment in the visitor. In a matter of days,
if you have the right contacts, you can
meet half the directors and stars you
have admired for a lifetime. The effici-
ency of the telephone service, the free-
ways, the secretaries are beyond praise.
Wealth, too, exerts its own appeal: the
writer you are having lunch with earns
$250,000 a year, the director you dined
with last night gets half a million a
picture and a percentage of the profits.
Even the poor film composer can make
40,000 to 50,000 dollars a year. Money
quickly goes to the most dedicated
artist’s head, and he turns into a busi-
nessman, with managers, agents, secre-
taries, and solicitors working round the
clock on his affairs. Admittedly before
long the intoxication has turned to
worry and despair. He is so busy on
the phone to his small financial empire,
he has no time to concentrate on his
next picture . . . But the greatest
appeal of Los Angeles lies in its feeling
of being the most extravagant expres-
sion of American dreams, a place in
which every possible desire can be
instantly fulfilled.
It is late at night on Hollywood
Boulevard, and I have been rushing
from studio to studio all day. At
Paramount, Mike Nichols is directing
a new comedy “The Graduate,” and
Roman Polanski is talking eagerly
about his anti-Christ story, “Rosemary’s
Baby.” At Universal, Hitchcock is
excited about his own new picture, the
story of a sex murderer and a female
police decoy. At Columbia, a strange
and remote Barbra Streisand, a Nefer-
titi in a towel robe, has been talking to
me about her role in “Funny Girl.” The
mechanical figure is still clicking and
bending past the Hollywood Wax
Museum in his musical comedy uni-
form. I walk past it, and somebody is
saying: “He’s real. He’s German. And
the last one was an Australian.”

Schwarzkopf
By PAUL FROLICH
Schwarzkopf, as full of charm as ever
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Town Hall
Sydney.
HALF A DOZEN TIMES, entranced,
I’ve sat through the “Rosenkavelier”
film, enamoured with the beautiful
Marschallin, her voice, her charm, and
her dignity in adversity. And here, bril-
liant in harsh arc lights, refulgent under
the Town Hall’s improbable pink ceil-
ing panels, stood my Marschallin, regal
and full of charm, her voice as per-
sonally disturbing as ever.
When Elisabeth Schwarzkopf visited
Sydney in 1949, I did not hear her
owing to a severe attack of impecu-
niousness. In the years since, countless
recordings, operatic, dramatic, and
lyrical, kept me in touch with the
amazing vocal and artistic development
which made her possibly the greatest
lieder singer of our generation. But
records are never the real thing, nor
was the film a wholly adequate prepara-
tion for the miracle of Schwarzkopf’s
physical presence. Though she is

middle-aged, she moves with the light
grace of a young queen, her perfectly
heart-shaped face is ever a mobile
guide to the mood of whatever song
she presents, and her singing is almost
always close to perfection.
There is no reason why Madame
Schwarzkopf’s voice, now, should show
the' same qualities as it did fifteen years
ago. There is, expectedly ,a hint of
thickening and of darkening in the
voice, but it is goici still. Even were
her voice less beautiful, less identifiable,
I would gladly listen to it for many
hours if, in their course, I continued to
be treated to such exquisite interpreta-
tions of Europe’s greatest musical
treasures.
At her second Sydney recital, facing
a Town Hall filled to the last corner
and with mercifully few expert coughers
in attendance, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf
sang leider by Schubert, Schumann,
Mahler Strauss, and Wolf. It would be
sheer insolence to comment on each
song, each detail of so rewarding an
occasion. The program, prepared with
great taste and intelligence, was a splen-
did one and I may do no more than
dwell on a few memorable points.
Though Madame Schwarzkopf’s reper-
toire, in lieder, is enormous, there are
a few songs that continue to suit her
particularly well, some of them lyrical,
some humorous, some shining show-
pieces of vocal art.
To me, the truly lyrical singer whose
genuinely whispered pianissimo is yet
heard in the farthest seat, merits the
most sincere applause. In keeping with
this rare technique, the lyrical tri-
umphs of hhe recital came with
Schumann’s “Nussbaum,” Wolf’s
melancholy “Verborgenheit,” and
Strauss’ “Morgen,” ’surely one of the
finest of all songs and never presented
with more heart-felt poignancy.
After the lyricism, sophistication and
humor. Mahler’s “Lob des hohen Ver-
standes” gave the singer a unique first-
half curtain with the proud braying
of the ass; it must have come as a
surprise to the many who know Mahler
only from his symphonies and Schwarz-
kopf from operatic recordings. In addi-
tion to these qualities, Madame Schwarz
kopf is also a great actress and to
my relief, she never hams. The jocular
“Kartenlegerin” by Schumann was a
convincingly acted out as was the
“Gypsy” in the final Wolf song which,
in vocal requirements, borders on a
strenuous vocalise.
Although I could pour endless praise
on this great singer (despite some minor
failures in Schubert’s “An die Musik’
and one of the Mahler songs), this re-
view would give a distorted picture
were I to neglect Geoffrey Parson’s con-
tribution. Of Australian musicians who
have achieved greatness, he returns to
Australia most regularly and we are
thus privileged to follow his progress.
Today, he is close to atttaining the
stature that was Gerald Moore’s as
an authoritative accompanist and inter-
preter. He ana Miss Schwarzkopf are
always a team of equals in music and
it is only fitting that, on occasion, he
should overshadow her as she outshines
him at either times. One such occasion
was Schubert’s popular “An Sylvia,”
when Parsons’ brilliant lightness of
touch and clipped scanning did much
more than merely help the singer.
The greatest triumph for both artists
was the bracket of songs by Richard
Strauss. Lieder are not easy fare at
any time and in this program no item
was negligible, but it was in the in-
flections of the Strauss songs that
Schwarzkopf, every inch the Mars-
challin again, showed her greatness, in
the free flow of Strauss’ music that
these fine artists found their supreme
fulfilment.
Precision
By DAVID SALTER
Vienna Boys’ Choir. Town Hall,
Sydney.
STANDING to attention in Strict geo-
metric division around the piano,
brightly scrubbed and immaculately
uniformed, the Vienna Boys’ Choir
gave Sydney audiences an evening of
vocal excellence outstanding in its
musicality and precision. Precision
was in fact the word for their whole
performance. Absolutely nothing, not
even their amusingly Teutonic pro-
nunciation in “Waltzing Matilda” was
a hairsbreadth out of place. Phrases
were shaped with such unwavering
clarity and accuracy that final cadences
seemed like the finishing polish on
some perfectly machined piece of steel.
Not surprising but nevertheless wel-
come was the discovery that this poised
perfection exhibited itself throughout
a broad historical spectrum. Monte-
verdi enjoyed the same flawless atten-
tion as did Mozart, Strauss, Mendels-
sohn, Reger, and Kodaly—each per-
formance being completely receptive
to the particular observances of the
period and the devices of its represen-
tative composer. The choir’s a cap-
ella singing was equally good (particu-
larly in the Ingenieri “O Bone Jesu”),
and the ease with which they held
their pitch through sustained chro-
matic passages was, quite simply, re-
markable.
As a delightful divertissement, the
boys appeared in costume to give Kon-
radin Kreutzer’s one-act opera “Seine
Hoheit Hast Gesagt” ’“His Highness
Has Decreed”). Mozartian in flavor,
the work served as a skilfully pro-
grammed period of release from the
disciplined presentation of the other
items. There was plenty of fun and
action all round, and the occasional set
aria or recitative revealed some won-
derful individual performances. In a
typically contrived and cliched buffa
plot, the choir displayed a stage sense
and flair for comedy which promises a
continuation of the tradition of “Cosi
fan Tutte” and “Die Fledermaus.”
Films
Godard looks ahead
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Alphaville. Director, Jean-Luc
Godard.
Sydney is to have a series of Sunday
screnings of movies which are evidently
felt to be too specialised in appeal for
week-long showing, but still have their
potential audience. The first is “Alpha-
ville,” • which was shown only once at
the Sydney Film Festival.
“Alphaville” seems to have discon-
certed Godard’s loyal followers and
infuriated some others by its emptiness.
But when was a Godard film particu-
larly full of intellectual content or
feeling, or indeed anything but idio-
syncracy? As one whose admiration
for the director is tepid at best, I found
‘Alphaville” a pleasant surprise, a free-
wheeling light entertainment. I can’t
believe that Godard expected anyone to
take it seriously or at anything more
than its face value stated in the
sub-title “une etrange aventure de
Lemmy Caution.”
His central theme a plea for love
and poetry as against regimented con-
formism is serious enough though
hardly original. “Alphaville” is an outer-
space city of the future where the
population has been reduced almost to
a collection of robots by a physicist
whose steely-eyed portrait glares at
them in Big-Brotherly fashion from
every wall, who keeps them dosed with
tranquilisers, forbids all human involve-
ment, and who invented a gravel-voiced
computer to dictate their every move.
And isn’t it now dictating to its creator,
too? Lemmy Caution a literary
private eye who always had more honor
in France than in the country of his
conception is sent from Earth posing
as a journalist from the “Figaro-
Pravda” (a typical and droll Godard
joke) to find out what is going on.
Instead of futuristic decor and
gadgets, Godard has used contemporary
buildings of steel and plate-glass, cold
and impersonal, for his city, and has
managed to give it a chilly and inhuman
appearance that is far more familiar
than any set-designer’s dream. The use
of the black-and-white camera has
always been a striking feature of
Godard’s films, however ramshackle
they were in other ways, and this one
isalways exciting visually. It isn’t as
witty as “Brave New World” or as
terrifying at “1984,” but it’s deft and
funny. Take it for what it is une
etrange aventure and enjoy it.

Ancestor
John
SHORT STORY
By JOHN GALE
MY father was convinced that John
Prynne, who had his ears cut
off by Charles I, was a relative
of ours. With the aid of some books on
genealogy and a family Bible, he
thought he had traced our line back
to a little place outside London where
he had read some Prynnes were still
residing. It was his ambition to make
the journey from Australia to England
to search graveyards and registers for
ancestors.
My father was an Anglophile to the
core. He could recite the monarchs of
England from William I down to Eliza-
beth 11. He knew the dates and loca-
tions of battles and their generals, and
he had memorised a London road map.
But we never had enough money for
my father’s fact-finding mission. His
schooling ended when he was 12, and
for the rest of his life he worked as a
clerk, a speck on the fourth floor of a
big Sydney company, sharpening pencils
and ruling neat lines for the figures
that he copied in columns for more
than 40 years.
To compensate for his frustrating,
anonymous labor he passionately col-
lected books about England, especially
books about British aristocrats, heraldry
and wars, so that Britain’s imperial
past was part and parcel of our genteel
poverty, our mundane existence in a
rundown suburb. My father even con-
fided to us children that if records had
been kept properly he would have been
a baronet. Of course, we were all
staunch monarchists, in spite of the
incident concerning ancestor John’s ears
My father haunted second-hand book-
shops and almost every week came home
laden with musty-leather-bound bargains
for sixpence or a shilling from Hunter
Street. We thought they were beautiful
and admired our father very much.
Once, he struggled home with six mas-
sive volumes of Shakespeare’s plays,
yellowed and with an authoritative smell
and print as large as my thumbnail. The
books stood about 18 inches high, which
meant he had to spend the following
weekend in the backyard constructing a
special bookcase to fit them.
He used to stand, just gazing at the
rows and rows of titles he had collected
on British achievement lined up in the
swaying, home-made bookcases with a
love and warmth I never saw him use
for anything or anyone else. I still have
one massive tome, the fruit of one of my
father’s bargain hunts, presented to me
when I was almost four. It has the grand
title of “Underground,” or “Life Below
the Surface,” and is more than 100 years
old. That book was the first grown-up
thing I ever owned. It is inscribed in
my father’s impeccable handwriting:
“To Elizabeth Prynne, aged three years
and eight months, from her father,
August 6, 1943.” The inscription was
part of the ceremony my father attached
to his relationship with his books.
One day, he decided to put these
books of his to work to help him realise
his dream of an expedition to England.
He entered a radio contest, a quiz show
Sponsored by makers of toothpaste,
shaving cream, and washing soap. He
chose to be quizzed on British history.
It was an embarrassing time for us all.
My father felt he was prostituting his
beloved England, and he hated to think
of the whole country listening to him
trying to win money. But he was sure he
would make at least a couple of hundred
pounds and decided the embarrassment
was worth it.
During the weeks that we waited for
him to be called up for the show, we
planned what we would do with the
money. My father would take his long-
service leave, about nine months in
all. His salary during that time would
be enough for us to live on while he
used his prize money for his boat trip
and living expenses in England. My
mother made only one condition. Any
money that was left over was to be
put in the bank and used to paint as
much of the house as possible.
During those weeks he read more
furiously than I ever remembered. He
read encyclopedias, books on heraldry,
“Who’s Who,” and “Burke’s Peerage.”
We quizzed him, but, of course, he knew
much more than we, and it usually
ended up with him saying something
like this: “Would you like me to tell
you how many ships in the Spanish
Armada?” Or: “I bet you can’t name
all the kings of England!” We man-
aged to keep up our enthusiasm right
down through the Henrys, Jameses,
and Georges, until the night he was to
go on the air.
He would not let any of us go with
him to the studio, except for my eldest
brother, who was 15 at the time. He
felt very manly being the only Prynne
to accompany our Wellington to Water-
loo. The rest of us, we were told, were
too young, and so my mother had to
stay at home, too, to look after us.
We women and children crouched
over the radio, nervous, but sure of
victory.
It was awful when we first heard our
father’s voice coming out of the plastic
set on the mantlepiece. Just like any
one of the hundreds of ordinary men
who took part in the show in pursuit
of money. And he sounded so tense, not
like our father, the man who was on
intimate terms with all the monarchs
of England.
It was agonising. The dreadful
master of ceremonies made my father
say our address and the names and
ages of all us children, which embar-
rassed me so much, sitting there loyally
in the living-room, that I was sure I
would have to ask my father to let me
change schools rather than go back and
face my classmates.
Then came the questions. Who was
present at the signing of the Magna
Carta? Relief. That was one we had
heard so many times. A great roar of
applause from the audience. I learned
later from my brother that cheer
leaders ran along in front of the audi-
ence, clapping above their heads.
Ten pounds.
Give all the Christian names of
Charles I. We in the living-room
looked at each other smugly. Of course,
the toothpaste makers could not know
that we knew Charles well.
Twenty pounds.
What is a Martello tower? I had
never heard of such a thing, but surely
my father had. We listened the
silence coming out of the radio, and
I thought I could hear my father
breathing. This is it, I thought, and
felt the tears creeping into my eyes.
Then there was the sound of his nervous
voice with the magic words describing
the shape of the tower.
Forty pounds.
Forty pounds! That was already more
than two weeks’ pay.
Again the jarring voice of the M.C.
Where and when was the North Atlantic
Treaty signed? Unfair! That Wasn’t
history, that was modern, just a few
years ago. That wasn’t the olden days,
the romantic British history we knew.
The silence coming out of the radio
was unbearable, but I dared to look
at my little sisters and smirk at their
apprehensive faces. Did they dare to
doubt their father’s ability after his last
coup?
The minutes marched by in silence.
When the gong of failure sounded I
could only run to my room and cry.
But the forty pounds came in very
handy. It was enough to paint the
window frames and front door. And as
a compensation prize for answering
three questions, my father also received
80 packets of detergent. That detergent
lasted for two years.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Why such a sudden
upsurge of thriftiness?
STATISTICS out this month did not
give Commonwealth Treasury officials
any grounds for attempting to redefine
the Budget at the last minute. June
quarter housing approvals at an annual
cate of 119,000 were down on the two
previous quarters —121,000 and 125,000
respectively —so, if anything the hous-
ing industry needed more encourage-
ment. Retail figures finished the finan-
cial year quite strongly, having kept
up to the $7.2 billion mark from the
$7.05 billion mark at the end of the
March quarter, a rate of growth in
annual terms of just 8 percent, helpfully
large but not extravagant.
Savings-account deposits increased at
a remarkable rate in the last few
months of the financial year, by an
average of $6O million each month, at
least 50 percent up on rates which have
been common recently. Why this sud-
den upsurge of thriftiness? Perhaps
farmers have got accustomed to spend-
ing drought-affected incomes and aren’t
fully back to their normal lavish spend-
ing habits, Perhaps, with cracker nights
restricted, little boys are keeping more
in their money boxes. Perhaps there
is something with the statistics.
But whatever the reason for these
figures, they all add up to an argu-
ment that consumers are exercising a
high degree of restraint.
This together with a quiet level of
business spending meant that there was
rio need for any dampening measures
in the Budget. The higher defence
spending, as long as it isn’t all lost to
American industry, should provide
something of a stimulus. State and
local authorities will have quite a
spending spree this year with approved
loan programs having been enlarged
by more than 20 percent. Final bills
of payments figures for 1966-67 also
make good reading for Treasury
officials.
The great weakness in the last year
as a whole has been in private capital
inflow. Needed capital hardly comes
here from Britain any more, though
Britain, until two years ago, used to
figure-head of the United States as the
largest source. In the first three-
quarters of the financial year only
$330 million capital had arrived here
(compared with $9OO million in the
previous year), but in the last quarter
of the year another $2OO million turned
up. This is very close to amounts that
we have been used to.
It is not that British capital is
coming here again in large quantities,
but that so much more American and
Japanese money is being attracted. A
lot, no doubt, is going into the mineral!
developments in northern Australia and
more into oil and gas research. But
whatever is bringing it here and
wherever it comes from, it is good
money and it relieves Treasury officials
of worries over the balance of pay-
ments, for we still have a good balance
of trade surplus provided capital in-
flowr is needed only to cover the cost
of so-called invisibles —transport, over-
seas travel, and so on.
United States
New taxes
IN THE United States there is to be
a 10 percent increase in both personal
income tax and company taxes. This
deep impost was anounced sirnulta-
neoulsy with the long-awaited news of
the dispatch of an extra 50,000 men for
Vietnam.
The steadily rising costs of the war
are, of course, a major reason for the
new taxes. But there are other rea-
sons, the most important of which is
that the Administration is increasingly
concerned about inflationary pressures
on the economy. Americans are, of
course, the most inflation-fearful people
in the world, especially, when there are
lots of Republicans in the Congress—
as there are at present.
It is rather rash to pass judgement
on the complex subject of the Ameri-
can economy from this great distance,,
but it does seem from reports of the
situation there that the Administration
is acting in a very conservative manner.
Unemployment is, of course,, at
present low indeed, below 4 percent,
when 8 to 10 percent was quite usual
in the Eisenhower and early Kennedy
years. But what is significant is that
the trend is slightly upwards. Any
economic measures which boost the
rate of unemployment are "bound to
aggravate the already grave social ten-
sions in American cities and sow fur-
ther seeds of the terrible violence like
that of Detroit and Newark.
The Administration is, of course, hop-
ing that the dampening effect of higher
taxation will be considerably offset by
the employment created by the extra
Vietnam spending and equipment pur-
chases.
General economic trends in America
are mixed. Under the impact of an
expansionary monetary policy, con-
sumer spending and business invest-
ment in new plant and equipment have
recovered considerably from, their 1966
torpor. Though construction is still
in the doldrums, overall spending has
been rising quite well, and the economy
does seem likely to achieve the Admin-
istration's 4 percent growth target this
year, but it will only do this by steer-
ing an uneasy course between inflation
on the one hand and increased unem-
ployment on the other.
Public relations
Talking freely
IT’S good for business when com-
panies let their hair down and talk
freely about themselves. Far too many
offer shareholders,. customers, and pub-
lic the measured statement, the tired
phrases, the rounded generalities of
compulsory periodic reports and noth-
ing else, as if robots content to live
only by their financial records, believ-
ing nobody gets hurt in this process,
and that silence is always golden.
Others like APM, Ansett, Southern
Gross and some of the oil companies
go to some expense to have themselves
heard in widely distributed news re-
views, letters, and so forth. They

Common market
Common Tax?
IT IS A good ten years since the
Treaty of Rome, which brought into
being the European Common Market.
In the interim a marked degree of in-
tegration between the Six has been
effected, but it still falls very short of
completion. The present set-up can be
likened to a smooth operating system of
locks and canals connecting six water-
levels —the domestic markets of the six
countries. The great lake of full
economic union can’t be created unless
the lock system itself is removed. The
market’s authorities are the first to
recognise this. One of their latest de-
cisions aspires to get rid of one of the
locks by harmonising taxes within the
community by the introduction of a
common value-added tax at the latest
by January, 1970. The new tax har-
monisation measures have two objec-
tives: to eliminate the distortions of
competition with the community and
to remove tax, as distinct from tariff,
frontiers.
The practical aspect of tax harmoni-
sation has posed a variety of problems
for the member States, whose tax sys-
tems have evolved over many years,
and, in respect of types of tax, tax
levels, and administrative collection and
control, have been adapted to the
particular economic conditions and
customs of each country. In any com-
mon alignment of their tax systems
their differing anti-trust, economic,
.social, and budget policies have to be
taken into account. Although the
harmonisation of turn taxes is the
first step to be taken, ultimately the
Commission envisages that the main
indirect taxes and certain direct taxes
will be put on a common basis. Har-
monisation is not of course regarded as
an end in itself but simply something
without which a common market in
the fullest sense cannot be achieved.
The Commission is fully aware of
the urgent need to harmonise taxes in
other fields as well and has recently
outlined a plan to deal with these in
the coming years. By July, 1968, it
will introduce a turnover tax on agri-
cultural products, and later on it in-
tends to eliminate differences in excise
duties, direct taxes, motor taxes, tax
on insurance contracts, and others. The
Commission has given a very broad
hint to aspiring members of the Com-
munity, like Britain, that their path
of entry would be eased considerably
if here and now they make a start in
bringing their tax systems into line
with the value-added systems it is
itself implementing.
Currencies
Number One
WHO ON EARTH would expect to
hear that Guatemala has one of the
most stable currencies in the world?
But this is just what a survey by the
eminently respectable First National
City Bank, in New York, shows. Also
at the top of the long ladder of financial
prudence are two other unlikelies
Venezuela and Honduras. The United
States comes next and then Luxembourg
and Canada, with ourselves in seventh
place in the list of 45 countries.
With Thailand, we are more finan-
cially stable than average which
works out at a rate of inflation of 3.3
percent annually.
Egypt and Britain are there in the
middle together and, strangely, such
respectables as Norway, Holland,
Sweden, France, Finland, and Japan
are not really so respectable after all,
having currencies which have depreci-
ated at faster than average rates. The
only reassuring thing about the table
is that the South American predictables
are right on the bottom Colombia,
Bolivia, Chile, Argentine, and last of
all, Brazil carrying the wooden spoon
with an annual rate of inflation of 31
percent.
But there is something wrong, surely.
Where is Indonesia? It didn’t even
make the list. Maybe City Bank’s com-
puter could not churn out the figure
in time to make the list.
Paint maker
FORTY-TWO years ago it was a
struggling little company that had lost
half its capital of $12,000. But under
the control of Frank Adams, who be-
came its managing director in 1927,
this little company has become one of
Australia’s big four paint makers, with
assets of $7.1 million and profits up
around the $f million mark.
It is British Paints (Australia) Pty.
Ltd., which started off life as Taylor’s
Paints in the 1920 s and which looked
in danger of ending its life in the same
decade.
But despite its unhealthy appear-
ance the company was interesting to
Adams, then a 23-year-old employee
in his father’s statistical publishing busi-
ness and part-time accountancy student.
He joined Taylors in 1926 with the
object of acquiring the company if he
liked it after a year’s work. He did,
and the company slowly developed un-
til 1940, when British Paints bought
him out and changed its name to
British Paints Australia. But the British
also bought Frank Adams, and he
stayed on as managing director. And
when they later acquired the Selleys
company, he became chairman of that,
too.
Last year British Paints itself was
taken over by the Celanese Corpora-
tion of the U.S., whose tax problems
have required the British Paints com-
pany in Australia to drop its indepen-
dent status and from this year to be run
as a branch of the British company.
In any event, now, at 64, Frank
Adams has announced his retirement
as managing director. He is to stay on
as chairman, making it a full-time
job until next June, when he will con-
fine his role to one only of attending
Australian branch board meetings and
acting as “consultant” to the company.
After that he’ll be playing a lot more
golf and having a few more trips—the
British Paints branches in Singapore,
New Zealand, New Guinea and Suva,
all controlled from Australia, can ex-
pect a visit before too long.


Just not understood
American Economic
Relations with Asia
By the editor of the
"Far Eastern Economic Review"
AMERICA’S ECONOMIC involve-
ment in Asia seems bigger than her
military involvement in the region.
More than one fifth of her foreign
trade is with Asian and Pacific
countries. From the Indian Ocean in
the west to the Pacific in the east, from
Japan in the porth to New Zealand in
the South, US economic and political
involvement is second to no other
country. She is perhaps the only
country capable of meeting the huge
problems of Asian countries provid-
ing over 10 million tons of food a year
to feed India’s starving millions or
finding a vast market for Japan’s boom-
ing industry. On many fronts U.S.
actions could have immense reper-
cussions on Asian countries. For
example, any abnormal release of tin,
rubber, or cotton from her warehouses
would considerably affect the economics
of Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, or
India by bringing down the world price
of these commodities.
On the other hand the U.S. would
only be “inconvenienced” by a similiar
“blocking action” by another country
such as that taken by the Philippines
last year when severe restrictions were
imposed on the imports from the US
despite the Philippines favourable bal-
ance of trade with the US. This is be-
cause the US economy is still an ex-
tension of America’s old isolationist
policies and compared to many other
Western industrialised nations, only a
small share of her GNP is exported.
The lure of the local market is more
attractive to the average American en-
trepeneur.
For example, the capacity of the US
economy is almost half as big as the
combined economies of all EEC and
EFTA countries. In 1964 the average
annual income of an American after
taxes was U 552,288, a figure far highet
than that of any other nation, in-
cluding those of Europe. A market
catering to her 200 million people is
undoubtedly the most lucrative in the
world. Moreover in the recent past her
GNP was increasing by almost, 5%
annually to export like some other in-
dustrialised countries (e.g., Japan)
and towards the end of Eisenhower’s
administration, the deficit in the ex-
change gap had reached an annual
average of $4,000 million.
The present active export drive was
started during the Kennedy adminis-
tration. Not only was foreign aid cut
back and 85% of it tied up with
purchases from the U.S., but military
spending abroad was also reduced
West Germany was asked to match it
with purchases from the U.S. An
active export promotion policy was
adopted. In 1964 U.S. exports in-
creased by 12% while imports rose
only by 7%, resulting in a trade surplus
of $3.6 million. Moreover, compared
with Western Europe, America offers
better prospects for balanced growth
without inflation.
Within this broad perspective of ex-
panding global trade, the U.S. interests
in Asia are bound to increase consider-
ably in coming years. At present the
U.S. caters mainly to the developed
markets of Europe the economic
development of Asia would naturally
help the U.S. to find more outlets for
her industries. Japan bought U. 5.52,414
million worth of goods from the U.S. in
1965, although the U.S. share of the
Japanese market was only 29.5%. On
the other hand the U.S. share of the
Indian market was 34.6% in 1965
comparable only to some Latin
American countries but the total
sales were only $974.8 million.
Similarly much of U.S. export trade
with Asia, except- in a few cases like
Japan, Hong T.-mg. etc., is heavily
aid orientated. Rowan has dispensed
with U.S. aid, and can now move ahead
without U.S. assistance. This has not
altered the trends, however. Other
countries also may reach that stage
sooner or later, depending on radical
changes in the nature of commodities
bought and sold. At every stage of
industrial development, Asian countries’
needs will be re-shaped irrespective ol
their capacity to pay, and the U.S. is
capable of providing goods at all stages.
She can sell agricultural commodities
to underdeveloped countries, e.g. raw
materials for the textile industries of
India, Hong Kong, and Japan. At the
initial stages of development of Asian
countries, the U.S. is one of the main
suppliers of civil engineering and con-
struction equipment as well as improved
farm tools. Power generators and other
machinery are already an important
item on the export list Considerable
sales have been recently made in some
other fields, such as office equipment,
electronic goods, etc.
The basic fact is that the variety of
U.S. exports can meet the requirement
of any country in any stage of its
growth. So her aid operations indirectly
help boost demands. Moreover U.S.
investment abroad is also starting to
pay increasing returns which will soon
be able to meet the strain on the dollar
from aid spending.
But it’s also true that, except in
India, Japan, and some smaller
countries, the U.S. share of the local
markets has been reduced during the
past few years. The figures from 1963
to 1965 indicate that in Burma, Ceylon,
South Korea, Pakistan, Cambodia, the
Philippines, and Taiwan, the U.S. share
of the local markets went down con-
siderably. South Vietnam registered
increases presumably explained by the
presence of U.S. soldiers there. The rise
in exports to India was due mainly to
the need for increase food supplies
while, in Japan, American exports are
still lagging behind Japanese exports
to the U.S.
Thailand is a country where the U.S.
holds an unusually high share of the
local market. Except in India, Thai-
land, and the Ryukyus, the U.S. share
is fast decreasing. In the immediate
future Japan may become a more
serious competitor to U.S. industry.
There are several fields the U.S. has
left untapped. Unlike the Japanese, the
Americans have not done any substan-
tial work to explore sales opportunities.
There is vast potential for the U.S. in
Asia if they show the same salesman-
ship for which American industry is
famous.
Recently when one U.S. concern took
several insertions of their advertisement
in the Far Eastern Economic Review
announcing the setting up of a Hong
Kong Branch this evoked over 300 en-
quiries from Asia. This illustrates the
public relations gap of the U.S. in
South East Asia. Despite being the
most talked about nation in the world,
the U.S. is also perhaps one of the least
understood. And the future prospects of
her export industry depend on a new
drive abroad to meet new realities.

$298 in the red
HAVE YOU EVER read ‘How I made
$2 Million In The Stock Market*. It
is a book writtai by a Hungarian dancer.
His name is Nicholas Darvas. His
claim is that he turned $lO,OOO into
$2 million in 18 months trading on Wall
Street. His maximum is ‘There are
no good stocks or bad stocks, there are
only rising and falling stocks’. His
theory is basically simple. Choose only
stocks, in an industry with a bright
future, and ones with a lively turnover.
Get familiar with the price pattern of
the stocks in which you are interested.
Darvas contends that price movements
can be pictured as forming a box. The
current high and low price levels rep-
resenting the frams of the box. Thus
you may have a $l.OO/$1.15 box. The
stock is then watched. Immediately it
jumps out of the top of its box a buying
order is given. This is providing sales
are being supported by the usual or
an increased level of turnover. The
buying order is always accompanied by
a pre-calculated selling order. The
selling order is executed once the stock
loses momentum and starts falling
backwards. The selling price is cal-
culated low enough to allow for normal
price swings but high enough to stop
any serious loss of capital. It is an
automatic stop-loss mechanism. Had
Mr. Darvas been in Australia last
year and applied his theory to B.H.P.
and Western Mining he could probably
have made another $2 million. Actually
based on this theory you would be still
buying these two stocks to-day!
Talking of buying what about Hecla?
It’s recent profit jump of 29 per cent
is not at all bad, but is even more im-
pressive when seen as only one of a
series of yearly profit rises recorded
since the company listed in 1961. It’s
restless energy is truely symbolic of
Mt. Hekla, the volcano in Iceland, after
which it is named. The latest earnings
equalled 43 per cent on capital and cov-
ered the 11 per cent dividend four
times over. Incidentally dividends paid
between 1963 and 1966 were 8,9, 10,
and 11 per cent respectively. Now the
company has decided to recapitalize.
It is making a 1 for 5 bonus, and a 1
for 5 premium issue. This in fact,,
boils down to a 2 for 5 cash issue at a
37.5 per cent discount. Based on a
current price of $2.75 the theoretical
ex-issue price is $2.14. Since the
11 per cent dividend is being maintained
a yield of 5.1 percent will be available
after the issue. On the basis that this
was too good to be true I bought 300.
Incidentally Hecla’s result is an en-
couraging signpost for what Ralta could
achieve this year.
Whtit Ansett has achieved is a
5 per cent rise in domestic air fares,
for both interstate and intrastate
flights. The financial year which ended
in June has already enjoyed the benefit
of the higher fares and freight rates
which were introduced in October last
year. Along with dearer tickets the
company is also doing well from in-
creased activity in all its other major
operating divisions. Even the losses
from its T.V. station are less this
year. With all these things going for it
plus Susan Jones I decided to chance
it with Ansett! I must admit I dont
really expect to make a fortune out of
the deal, but hope to clear a 10 per
cent profit in somewhere around 2
months.
Some people not taking any chances
at the moment are the new breed take-
over exponents. Strata and Astor Hotel
Motels were the first guinea pigs of
their new technique. The trick is to
make a‘first-come, first-served’ offer
for no more than one-third of a com-
pany’s issued capital. Provided the one-
third condition is observed there are
no real formalities involved. In this
way, provided the bid is reasonable,
the bidder can get enough of the com-
pany’s shares to make a full takeover
a pushover and at the same time effect-
ively stop anyone else wishing to make
one through more formal channels.
The whole deal can be pulled off with
lightning speed and the bidder doesn’t
even have to name himself. The unfair
part of the game is that a lot of
shareholders who haven’t had a chance
to voice their opinions could suddenly
find themselves under the dominance
of a boss they don’t even like or know.
Having got that out of my system,
back to business. My only sale of the
week was Uranium Consolidated.«l’ve
held this stock since the beginning of
the year in the hope of hearing some
good news about the economic feas-
ibility of the company’s bentonite dep-
osit at Springsure in Queensland. Un-
fortunately no news was forthcoming so
I decided to cash my chips and look
for my fortune elsewhere.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
300 Hecla $2.75 $844
200 Ansett $0.67 $137
SOLD
500 Uranium Consolidated $0.45 $221
This week it’s back into debit again.

WILD CAT PA GES
Should investors move out
of industrials into mining?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
by JASON
THERE IS NOTHING new in the
fact that the performance of the mining
market has far outpaced the invest-
ment sections; the current ’’boom”
that has lifted share prices indexes
to record levels bears no relation at
all to the dullish state of the invest-
ment market (a few leading stocks
excepted). But there is something new
in the debate at present going on about
whether investors should move out of
industrials into mining if they are to
get anything like their fair share of the
benefits to come from Australia’s fut-
ure development. There is a solid
school of thought recommending this
sort of switch as a long term move,
not simply as a temporary expedient
to take advantage of a once-and-for-
all special situation. Its followers sugg-
est that the investment market will
never be able to match the rate of
advance of the miners, which face an
almost uliminted future. So they are
recommending Western Mining at $2O,
BHP at $l2, Mt Isa at $4, New Broken
Hill at $B, and all the iron ore stocks
at whatever price is going. They like
beach sands and suggest the Goldfields
group or Western Titanium or Kathleen
Investments. They think tin will do well
and that stocks like Renison and Raven-
shoe have real appeal. And they suggest
you sell your industrials, not so you
can gamble in mining, but so you can
invest in it.
There is a lot of merit in what
they say. If the world is to continue to
want our raw materials these stocks
do well; if the world doesn’t want them,
then all of Australia, not just these
stocks, will do badly. So why not get
on the bandwaggon? One very cogent
reason is because there is a swag of
money to be made in the industrial
share market as well.
True, the swings may not be as
dramatic, but they are nevertheless
real, and there is the added attraction
of some industrial stocks that have a
foot in both camps; those companies
holding large investments in BHP
(Howard Smith, for example) stand to
get a bit of all worlds. And there is
little doubt that the benefits to come to
Australia from our mounting exports
of raw materials should eventually fil-
ter through to the rest of the economy-
to retailers, motor makers and distrib-
utors, appliance makers and the rest
,pf them that have been having a poor-
ish time of things under pressure of
last year’s mini-recession. This sort
of consideration has been a factor in
the Bulletin’s solid support for Myers
in the last year or so,andnowit seems
appropriate to have a serious look at
Waltons, a stock about the market is
clearly dreadfully nervous because of
all the ‘out’ things it has done, like
opening a new store in Bourke Street,
Melbourne, and having such a huge
proportion of its business in debtor
accounts. There is no doubt that things
have been difficult at Waltons in recent
times, but there is also no reason to
doubt the chance that company has of
pulling it all off, of making a success
of its unorthodox methods, particularly
if consumer spending grows at a faster
rate than now. It seems to have most to
fear from the Woolworths group whose
move into Big W Department stores
seems aimed directly at the Waltons
sort of store customer - but not the
Waltons door to door customer, which
is a field that Waltons dominates. This
stock looks interesting.
BETTER TIMES for the motor
companies would bring improvements
for the suppliers of parts, like Duly
and Hansford whose share price looks
inordinately low at 90 cents. After
all, the tyre companies have already
gone through their little crisis and
are now emerging as ‘recommended
buys’ on many brokers’ lists. Motor
parts makers seem a good sort of
proposition.
And then there are appliance ma-
kers who should stand to benefit from
improved consumer demand. Not that
they could ever expect a repitition
of the once-and-for-all rush into app-
liances like television sets and washing
machines that was a feature of the
1960 boom and that encouraged so many
of them of instal plant capacity that
can never be used to the full. But
there are prospects that a steady
replacement market is developing and
that other appliances like air cond-
itioners should have a substantial
‘first-off’ sale as prosperity strikes
again. This should do the world of
good for Kelvinator, which is a good
company at the worst of times and
elves promise of being an excellent one
at the best of them. There is also
great scope for increased ‘first-off'
sales of electric clothes driers (a
smack in the eye for the Hills Hoist
group) and Astor in the Electronic
Industries group stands to benefit from
that. But the thing that the appliance
makers are hoping for most seems to
be color television, which they hope
will bring significant rewards to them.
Perhaps the appliance business is not
as dead as the market thinks.
THE AC I DEAL with Ampol in
which it bought one million of Ampol's
holding in Ampol Exploration for $ll/2
million is good news to shareholders in
both stocks. It is good for ACI not
only because of the excellent prospects
that the Exploration company has
through its one seventh stake inWapet,
but also because of the tax benefits
this investment will give ACI. For the
Exploration company no doubt proposes
to distribute its oil income to the full
to its shareholders and this will be
subject to taxation concessions. It will
then raise fresh capital to finance the
further search rather than simply using
retained funds. For the fresh capital
contributions will be a taxation deduct-
ion, so that it pays off all around.
This is a sensible and modest first
step by ACI into the search for nat-
ural resources in Australia.
The deal is good for Ampol simply
because it puts cash in the bank. The
recent balance sheet showed that the
company was fairly short of liquid
funds, even though its long term pos-
ition looked quite healthy. Its sale of a
3.8 per cent holding in Ampol Ex-
ploration to ACI only marginally affects
its own position in the search for oil,
as its holding is still up at 63.9 p?r
cent and it will still get huge taxation
and income advantages from this. And
the latest accounts did not have the
benefit of the large cash flow that will
be coming in from Barrow oil this
year (Nor, by the way, did it show the
full benefits of the Lytton refinery,
nor the recent petrol price rise nor the
increased rate of local consumption).
So the $1 1/2 million from ACI will
help solve a problem that is being large-
ly met from within the group. And then
there is the added sweetner that Am-
pol’s tanker operations should be
bringing it in a little extra this year
as the Suez closure has added to the
demand for tankers (it now takes tank-
ers a lot longer to deliver middle east
crudes), and so freight rates have gone
up. The market got too worried about
Ampol when it saw the balance sheet;
at prices under 70 cents this stock is
not only a very good income earner, it
also provides an excellent way into
the search for oil.


Behind the balance sheets
New Zealand’s packaging
leader isn’t what it was
New Zealand’s locally listed pack-
aging leader, UEB Industries Limited
is not what it used to be; but it is too
early yet to know whether the dramatic
plunge the company is making into the
textile industry means that the new
look is a better one or not. It is cert-
ainly not without its risks. And the re-
cent result for the year to March 31
of a 52 per cent rise in net profit
is no indication whatsoever of the like-
ly long-term impact of last year’s move
into textiles. It does not give much of
a hint about the more immediate future,
either, as any improvements UEB may
be able to make. in its textile division
this year could be largely offset by the
general economic downturn in New Zea-
land.
Until last year, UEB Industries
was the long-established United Empire
Box Company that rivalled Australian
Consolidated Industries for dominance
in the fibre container business in New
Zealand - and which had set up shop
in Australia to have a crack at this
market, too. It was doing fairly well
within the limits set by the quite sig-
nificant increases in packaging dem-
ands, particularly from New Zealand’s
export industries. Sales for the group
had jumped by three quarter in the
three years from 1963 to 1966, net
profit had doubled and the dividend
payout had gone up, too. Its Australian
operations went through a difficult
period for a while, but are now doing
quite profitably.
As an investment, the company had
a lot of appeal while it stayed in the
packaging industry; its packaging side
still looks good, despite the slackening
rate of economic growth in N.Z. and
even though some of the group’s ablest
managers have now switched their
attention from packaging into the new
field of textiles, as part of a move
that has transformed this company from
a known quantity with a forseeable fut-
ure into a company that could bring
off a spectacular success - or come
a frightful cropper.
The reason behind the move was
the belief by chairman and managing
director, J.N.C. Doig, that the main
thing wrong with the woollen textile
industry in New Zealand was manage-
ment; that good management and sen-
sible accounting practice could trans-
form textiling from a depressed sect-
ion of the economy into a really good
profit-maker. He reckoned he had the
good management and the accounting
skill within his own organisation to
make a go of it. And in view of its
depressed state, the cost of acquiring
a large slice of the industry would
not be too heavy.
So during the past year or so the
company acquired the Napier Woollen
Mills, Steeles Carpet Industries, Ross
and Glendining, Bremner and Bremner
and 45 per cent of McKendrick Consol-
idated Industries (now Knightsbridge
Carpets) and now has a dominant pos-
ition in the New Zealand woollen tex-
tile trade, particularly in carpets.

All this is costing money. Apart
from the capital issued for these take-
overs (last year it rose SNZ2.I mill-
ion or 37 per cent entirely because of
acquisitions), more money has been
borrowed and more still is to be raised.
The recent accounts for the year to
March 31 showed that long term lia-
bilities had jumped by SNZ2.6 million
or 80 per cent, mainly due to a debent-
ure issue and an overseas loan. And
the company is currently raising SNZ
1.2 million in another debenture issue
and SNZ2 million in an unsecured con-
vertible note issue. This is at a time
of some financial stringency in N.Z.
so the cost of growth is quite high.
Naturally the textile operation is
not yet paying off; it is even a heavy
drain on the group’s profitability at
present and significant improvements
are needed before the switch can be
called successful. For while the latest
accounts show after the big move into
textiles that sales are up by a third
that capital is up 37 per cent, that
long term borrowings are up 80 per
cent and assets are up by 60 per cent,
so far the company’s pre-tax profit
has risen by only 26 per cent.
But this looks like a good result
in the circumstances of the woollen
textile industry when UEB came into
it, even if it is not as good as UEB’s
accounts would suggest at first glance.
For the latest result, which showed
sales and profits rising considerably,
was helped to a great extent by a
sharply reduced proportionate tax ch-
arge, tax rose by only SNZIOB,OOO
although net profit jumped by SNZ
560,000 or more than 50 per cent.
This meant that tax took only 43 per
cent of the pre-tax profit instead of
the previous year’s 52 per cent. This
was because of tax losses "in the newly
acquired subsidiaries - and there are
still further tax losses available to
help the current year’s profits.
But not even this lower tax could
prevent the company’s earning rate
slipping a bit to 21.6 per cent as a
result of the higher capital employed.
It will take another large profit rise
to maintain the earning rate following
last month’s one for five bonus share
issue and the conversion of 1.35 mill-
ion notes into shares last April. On
top of that there are another 1.5 mill-
ion notes to convert next April, so
that capital is to rise without any fur-
ther issues by another 40 per cent
or so to almost SNZII million by then
- or double its level of last year.
Despite tougher times in the dom-
estic market, there seems no serious
danger of UEB not being able to earn
enough profit to pay an 11 per cent
dividend on this capital, even though
it would require about 50 per cent
more than the latest dividend payout.
But the company may well prefer to
retain larger proportions of profit in
the business if its capital needs con-
tinue to be as great as they are now;
at March 31 this year it was committed
to capital expenditure of SNZ2.B mill-
ion, representing a 20 per cent rise in
the net book value of fixed assets.
All this expansion has brought a
dramatic change to the group’s stock
and debtors situation; it will take a
lot of hard work to improve a far from
satisfactory trend towards longer stock
holding and proportionately bigger deb-
tors than was the custom in the group’s
packaging operations. A' year ago,
UEB’s stock at balance date represent-
ed 18 per cent of turnover; this year it
had jumped to 25 per cent. Last year
debtors were 14 per cent of sales;
this year they had risen to 20 per cent,
with debtors more than 50 per cent
greater than creditors.
These takeovers have meant that
the group’s assets have jumped by
about 60 per cent or SNZI2.2 million
in the last year. Most of this has come
from the rise in current assets (mainly

stocks and debtors) which have almost
doubled to $15.6 million, while fixed
assets like land and plant and equipment
have risen by only one third to SNZI4.I
million. And the $l.B million increase
in investments, representing for the
most part the acquisition of 45 per cent
of McKendricks, has already brought a
book loss of about $NZ250,000 compar-
ing the cost of the shares acquired with
the market price of those outstanding
at March 31. And the book value of the
parent company’s investments in sub-
sidiaries have doubled to SNZ2O.B mil-
lion.
UEB’s carpet interests are dom-
inated by the manufacture of wilton,
axminister and tufted carpets. Carpets
themselves make up about 40 per cent
of the textile group’s business, yarns
another 21 per cent, rugs, blankets
and so on another 23 per cent, clothing
only eight per cent (of which only about
three per cent is styled so the risks
of fashion changes bringing problems
are relatively small) and knitted goods
another eight per cent. The group makes
about half New Zealand’s production of
yarn (including carpet yarn).
The first stage in its campaign to
make profits out of textiles has been
to close down and dispose of those
sections that it regards as uneconomic.
As a result, all Ross and Glendining's
substantial wholesaling operation was
sold, as were many of its manufact-
uring activities. UEB’s policy of putting
its packaging executives in charge of
textile operations has yet to be proven;
too much of the textile industry was
shackled by out of date ‘Bradford
practices’, but there is the clear danger
of burned fingers by ignoring too many
of the traditional ways of this tradit-
ionally inefficient industry.
' The company sees the greatest
future for the textile operations in ex-
ports and it is undertaking market
surveys of the major potential over-
seas markets for its carpets, woollen
carpet yarn, blankets and hand knitting
yarn. It takes the view that there are
special advantages in having an integ-
rated textile operation right on the
spot where the wool is produced and
appears confident that exports will
eventually contribute a considerable
part of its profits. There are hopes that
these exports may solve some of the
seasonal problems that at present mean
an uneven use of plant and equipment
through the year; one of the attract-
ions of the US market is that it has its
seasons reversed from New Zealand’s
so that even if prices were very compet-
itive, profitability would be assisted by
a fuller use of plant and people.
By going into the textile business,
UEB has set out on an adventure that
may not be as irrational as it seems.
The rewards for success could be sub-
stantial if the management skills that
have made UEB such a success in
packaging can be applied to textiles.
Those buying the shares at current
prices are in effect backing Mr. Doig’s
management team above all else. For
he has chosen a difficult time to make
such a move.


Security analysis
After mining’s excitements
—a return to “industrials”
AFTER THE GLAMOROUS mining
stocks of the past few weeks, any
return to industrials can only be an
anti-climax. Perhaps some interest may
still exist in the companies which are
engaged in “basic industry”; in the
Sydney Stock Exchange industry classi-
fication the group would seem to be
■“Chemicals, paper, glass, rubber.” There
are seven “leaders” in this broad cate-
gory, four of which are in 8(a) “Chemi-
cals, plastics, paints, fertilisers, glass.”
The remaining three are in 8(b)(1)
“Paper manufacturers” (two com-
panies) and in 8(c)(1) “Rubber manu-
facturers” (one company). The names
of these companies in industry order
are: Australian Consolidated Industries,
Commonwealth Industrial Gases, Drug
Houses of Australia, Imperial Chemical
Industries of ANZ, Australian News-
print Mills, Australian Paper Manufac-
turers, and Dunlop Rubber Australia.
Although these companies are very
well known, it is doubtful whether they
would have been regarded as growth
stocks in recent years. Nevertheless, it
is perhaps quite surprising to find price
gains ranging from 28 percent down to
as low as 4 percent as under.

Australian Consolidated Industries
Limited has had quite a good rise in
price in the past few months and is
currently selling at about $3.45. There
has been a rise in price of 15 percent
in the past three months, and today the
Immediate dividend yield is a bare 2.9
percent. On the basis of the preliminary
announcement of the 1966/67 profit
made last May, the price/earnings
multiple is now 17.3.
When one examines earnings per
share over the past ten years, “growth”
seems to have been almost non-existent.
the company seems to have
earned about 15.4 cents per share and
this has increased to 20 cents in
1966/67; most of the growth occurred
In the 1964/65 year. There has been
rather better growth in dividends per
share, for on an adjusted basis these
have been growing at about percent
per annum compound, while earnings
per share have been increasing at an
average annual compound rate of only
1-| percent approximately. Neither
growth rates would justify the present
pricing of the shares in terms of divi-
dend and earnings yields. It is thus
necessary to look for a rather better
potential for the future.
The company is mainly engaged in
packaging and in building materials,
and it covers a wide range of products
within these broad groups. In the
packaging group, ACI produces virtu-
ally all the glass containers made in
Australia. It would seem that during
the five-year period when ACl’s per
share earnings were showing the least
growth, net operating profit (as
measured from the Commonwealth
Statistician’s figures) was increasing at
a rate of about 8 percent per annum
compound, but it is important to men-
tion that the investment in land, build-
ings, and plant also increased very sub-
stantially. It is, therefore, likely that
the increase in apparent profitability
was only achieved by a greater increase
in capital.
ACI is also an important force in the-
fibre container business, and it has often
been stated that the demand for this
type of packaging is likely to grow at
about 6 percent per annum for several
more years. Unfortunately, it is very
doubtful whether profitability of this
industry has managed to grow at this
rate in the past year or so. Competition
has been quite fierce and profit margins
would appear to have suffered, judging
by the records of some of the public
companies whose main activity is the
production of fibre containers. How-
ever, it could well be that the situation
is changing if the recently published
result of Fibre Containers Ltd. is any
guide.
In 1965, ACI acquired a 50 percent
interest in the company which produces
sisalkraft and multiwall sacks and which
is now known as St. Regis-ACI Pty.
Ltd. This acquisition not only extended
the packaging group but also added to
the product range of the building
materials group.
In the plastic packaging field, ACI
produces containers and bottles as well
as polythene bags and sacks. It seems
that this division is a major competitor
of the glass container division for “. . .
extensive development was carried out
particularly in the production of plastic
bottles.- The company continued its
policy of acquiring the latest modern
high-speed equipment, and this will
enable us to provide efficient service to
this rapidly expanding market. Of par-
ticular note is the development of the
vinyl plastic bottle . . .” (extract from
the general manager’s 1966 report).
The glass division is fighting back with
the non-returnable glass container,
which seems to be having some success
in the soft drink area despite the objec-
tions of some beachside local councils.
The building materials division seems
to have had rather more troubles in
recent years, and one major area, the
production of flat glass, appears to have
met strong competition from imports
from Mainland China, U.S.S.R., Poland,
and Korea. Similar problems seem to
have afflicted the decorative laminated
plastic building sheets division and also
the associated company, Coramic Aus-
tralia Pty. Ltd., which manufactures
glazed ceramic tiles.
Other items produced for the build-
ing industry include bathroom fittings
(basins, baths, and shower recesses),
lighting-ware, fibreglass insulation, ven-
tilating fans, etc. In addition, subsidiary
and associate companies are engaged in
steel fabrication, manufacture of pres-
sure vessels and tanks, structural
engineering, etc. Clearly, the wide range
of products makes for a wide range of
profitability, particularly where imports
from Asian countries are entering Aus-
tralia in some volume. Any judgment
as to the future trend in overall profits
for the group would then be rather
hazardous if one only had to consider
conditions in the Australian market.
ACI has, in addition, numerous over-
seas subsidiaries, whose importance can
only be guessed at. In New Zealand,
ACI produces glass containers, flat
glass, fibre containers, and various plas-
tic products. In South-East Asia, glass
companies are operated in Singapore
and Thailand and fibre packaging com-
panies in Malaysia and Thailand.
What, then, is the record over the
past five years? The annual repoi't for
1966/67 is not available at the time of
writing, but the figures for 1961/62 to
1965/66 are as under:

It seems likely that there has been a
small improvement in per share earn-
ings in 1966/67, but it will be interesting
to see the trends in the relationships
between tax and pre-tax profit and
between plant and depreciation.
Theoretically, ACI is in a very strong
position to benefit from the good -growth
in demand which is expected in all
forms of packaging over the next five
years. During this same period there
should also be strong growth in the
demand for various building materials.
Sales should be able to increase at about
6 to 7 percent per annum compound.
If per share earnings can increase at
about 9 percent per annum compound
during this period, then the shares are,
in my opinion, fairly priced at about
$3.45. .

Tin is now in the shade
TIN, APPARENTLY, IS not a metal
to get excited about in Australia. The
industry in this country won’t agree with
that, of course. It will only admit that
the tin has been put on ice with so
much going on at the monent with other
minerals. There are no current excit-
ments in the metal like those of a few
years ago when Ardlethan was put on
the NSW map by the Aberfoyle group
and, more recently, when Greenbushes
saw the light of day in W.A. (and the
stock market) and Gold Fields started
to do things to Renison in Tasmania.
Sad to relate, tin has lately been in
a Cinderella among the metals even
though the industry is more active
than ever and some sizeable develop-
ments are taking place, particularly
in Tasmania.
When Sir Maurice Mawby was rec-
ently giving his rundown of the glitt-
ering prospect for minerals at AIDA
annual meeting in Melbourne he nat-
urally had to say something about tin,
and with so many fine words reserved
for the giants, like iron ore and baux-
ite, that his group is obsessed with
it was understandable that he used
weak adjectives for tin, putting it
among the also-rans, dismissing it
in a sentence. ‘The large areas of
tin -bearing sulphide ore on the west
coast of Tasmania also guarantee an
increasing production of tin in Aust-
ralia in the years ahead’, was all
he said about tin. So much for the
possibility which may still be reveal-
ed for tin when prospectors get off
the rim of the Pre-Cambian Shield
and go to work with a will inside the
saucer. Men of tin should not be
dismayed by Sir Maurice talking from
his bauxite seat.
Equally dismal on the relative pro-
spect for tin was the Melbourne stock-
broking firm, Edward Ward & Co.,
in a recent heady forecast of minerals
production and its outworkings for the
balance of payments et cetera in Aus-
tralia. As an exercise in the art of
crystal ball reading this has no equal
in our -times, nor those, possibly, of
Nostradamus. In this intriguing doc-
ument we learn that Australia’s tin
production is going to move up from
last year’s 4,440 tons in polite stages
to 7,000 tons in 1969 then to 8,000
tons in 1971. After that no increase
is expected for as long as the pro-
jection runs, that is to 1882. Not very
much help but at least honest in its
ignorance of possible future new dis-
coveries.
Needless to say in view of the pro-
jected production trend the authors are
not looking towards glamorous vistas
for tin in the export field in the
manner they are, say, for the current
big ticket items like iron ore, bauxite
and coal. Tin comes amongst the lower
orders in export potential more like
manganese, lead and beach sands. They
think that this year we will export
only slightly more than half the 1300
tons we sent abroad last year but tin
exports in 1968 should then almost
regain last year’s level and come up to
a plateau of 3500 tons in 1971 and
apparently run along it indefinitely.
If the projected figure of slom for
tin exports in 1971 is put against
projected exports for oron ore ($292m),
bauxite, alumina and aluminium com-
bined (sl77m) and black coal (sls6m)
in that year it looks a mere mouse
beside mountains; while measured ag-
ainst the firm’s forecast of total noh<=
ferrous metal exports of $4ll m for
that year again tin exports will be of
minimal importance.
It will be asked how on earth can
production and exports of a metal be
estimated so far ahead? It is a fair
question even when considering only
quantities. It is a very good one indeed
when values are involved because met-
als prices are so volatile. The answers
of the authors are not all that reass-
uring; in estimating future values they
merely say they’ve been conservative
and have given their estimates on two
levels of ’’confidence”, meaning they
are more confident in their predictions
at one level than the other.
"Each mineral or metal forecast
has been built up after assessment of
the expected production levels of major
producers”, they state. ”For the major
sectors - iron ore and pellets, bauxite,
alumina and aluminium, black coal, and
crude oil, two levels of physical output
have been assessed. In other cases the
non-ferrous metals (including tin)pho-
sphate, brown coal and natural gas,
single physical output levels have been
assessed, and the resultant value fig-
ures adjusted downwards 5 p.c. and
upwards 15 p.c. to arrive at two con-
fidence levels (of prediction). Values
have been calculated conservatively,
and are based on known contract prices
and price levels in cases such as iron
ore and black coal, and on conser-
vative estimates of future price in
other instances”.
The authors have assumed that
consumption of tin will remain constant
in Australia at about 4,500 tons a year
indefinitely or (at least until 1988).
This is the level held without much
variation in recent years. It might be
expected that industrial development
here would in itself bring an expansion
in demand and that new uses could well
be found for the metal; what they say
about bearish forces operating on dem-
and is undoubtedly right. For instance
big economies in tin usage have been in
mode making tin plate, the major use
of the metal here. Again, the penet-
ration of other packaging materials into
tin’s market will have a dampening eff-
ect on demand and forecasts of tin
usage, in the manufacture of solder,
its second major market in Australia,
are bearish.

Shipping through Suez
What happens
now?
THE EGYPTIANS could clear the
Suez Canal in less than a month if they
wanted to, but are not likely to make
any moves in that direction while Israeli
troops occupy the eastern bank. The
shipping industry is therefore assuming
that the canal will-not reopen before
the new year at the earliest and is
planning accordingly.
The oil companies have established
a precarious balance of tanker capacity,
with the help of 3 million tons of
tankers that were either laid up or
carrying grain before the fighting start-
ed, and a further rather surprising
3 million tons of ships designed for
both the ore and oil trades which are
managing to free themselves from
their ore contracts and get into the
more lucrative oil trade at freight
rates touching 1355. sterling per ton
of crude from the Persian Gulf round
the Cape compared with 335. a ton
before the crisis. This gives the oil
companies a good chance of getting
through the winter without petrol rat-
ioning. But the balance is precarious
and could easily be upset by a change
in the oil supply on offer or an early
cold winter snap bumping up Europe’s
fuel oil demands.
Dry cargo bulk ship and tramp
owners also did very well out of the
business.that spilled over when the big
bulk carriers switched over to oil-
carrying and they picked up the dis-
carded cargoes of ore, grain and so on.
But the initial flurry has died down
for two reasons. There are nearly 4
million tons of new dry cargo bulk
carriers due for delivery during the
next 6 months, which more than com-
pensate for the ore carriers now div-
erted to oil. And shipowner shave found
to their disappointed surprise that
cargo owners who charter their ships
have been perfectly happy to sanction
a switch to oil and grain under exist-
ing contracts on one condition: that
they themselves could cut the tonnage
they had on long-term charter. So
they are only replacing a part of the
tonnage that has moved to the oil
trade, an ominous sign of a possibly
much lower level of trade when the
canal does reopen and a certain sign
that present high dry cargo freight
rates will not last that much longer
whatever happens to the canal.
When it* does reopen , there is
going to be less oil going through it,
and canal dues which earned Egypt
79 million sterling last year, will
start to fall. If the Egyptian govern-
ment does not want that fall to be
very rapid indeed, it will have to
move ahead fast on the deepening
and widening programme to which it
was committed before the crisis. After
much discussion with the oil comp-
anies and considerable research, the
canal authorities had agreed to dredge
and strengthen banks sufficiently to
allow tankers of up to 120,000 tons
to get through fully loaded by 1969.
(Compared to about 80,000 tons now.)
But the major oil companies have
found it is even more economic to
build ships of 225,000 tons to go
round the Cape loaded, and back empty
through the canal on their way south
to the Persian Gulf. A number of these
ships have already been ordered and
are due to start operating in 1969 on
assumptions that the canal would then
be wide and deep enough to take them
empty. The 225,000 ton tanker would
have increasingly become the ‘popular
size’ during the next five years, but
if the present crisis delays the civil
engineering works previously planned,
the oil companies will be inclined to
look towards tankers nearer to 500,000
tons which would avoid the canal al-
together. But even if the planned broad-
ening and deepening of the canal is
completed by 1969, Egyptian revenue
from canal dues will start to fall as
more big tankers go through the canal
southbound with no cargo, paying far
lower dues than if they were fully
loaded going north.
Other cargoes were also beginning
to avoid the Suez Canal even before
trouble started. Six million tons of
iron ore passed through the canal
northbound in 1966. That was 9 per
cent down on the previous year, and
the amount of cereals going northward
is also falling. Last year less than 2
million tons of grain passed through
going north and this was a 33 per cent
drop on the previous year. The reason
for this fall in dry bulk shipping is
largely the result of changes in trade

patterns. Ships don’t need to use Suez
when carrying ore from Brazil to
Europe and grain from Australia. But
grain and ore carriers are also finding
it cheaper to add a few days on their
voyages to Europe round the Cape
from Australia and the Far East rather
than pay canal dues. As bulk carriers
get bigger, this tendency will increase.
The canal authorities are going to
be forced to rearrange the structure
of their dues to make up for the loss
of traffic. Cargo liner traffic through
the canal has been steadily increasing
and a thousand fewer tankers passed
through the canal last year than other
kinds of ships, which reached a record
11,320. But whatever the authorities
do to make the non-tanker pay more
(and cargo liner owners may as well
get used to the idea of having to pay
considerably higher dues in the long
run), they will still have to charge
dues on some sort of tonnage basis and
this is where the crunch comes. Though
there were more general cargo ships
than tankers passing through the canal
last year, their net registered tonnage
on which dues are paid amounted to
only 68 million tons compared to
206 million tons of the fewer but far,
far larger tankers.
International
Is a “European company”
really possible?
IN THE battles between European and
American industry, one question looms
with growing urgency. Will the Euro-
peans ever be able to form genuinely
international corporations, merging
across the frontiers of the continent
to produce giants as big and rich as
American rivals?
The Eurocrats in Brussels are
convinced of the need for such merg-
ers. In the first years of the Common
Market, they were wary of the dangers
of international cartels; but once the
American giants began stepping up their
European campaigns, the Eurocrats
changed their line, and at the end of
last year they at last set up a working
party to study how a legal formula for
a ‘European Comapny’ might be de-
vised.
There have been hundreds of merg-
ers and takeovers inside the Common
Market; but they have been either
within the same country, or between
a European and an American company.
There remains only one major case
of a European merger—the link between
the Belgian photographic company Gev-
aert and the German Agfa, which was
designed to fight back the competition
of the American Kodak. Without &
common European company law, a com-
plicated system of cross-holdings was
devised; but the problems of that mer-
ger-legal, organisational and personal-
have been so great that it has not been
an encouraging precedent.
The difficulties of forming a Euro-
pean company are huge. The whole
field is a legal jungle. Each country
has a different system of company
law, and different ways to protect
shareholders; France has strong rules
about pre-emptive rights; Germany
provides a ‘Supervisory board’, Bel-
gium limits the number of votes for
a single shareholder.
In each country, too, companies
have a different, and delicate, rela-
tionship with their Governments. As
national planning develops, the rela-
tionship gets more intimate, and the
company gets more involved in notions
of patriotism and national interest -
Pechiney batting for France, Fiat for
Italy, Krupp for Germany. This tend-
ency seems to be getting stronger, not
weaker; a merger between BMC and
Fiat seems as unlikely as one between
Arsenal and Juventus.
But on top of these difficulties,
there are psychological ones; to put
it bluntly, it’s not yet clear that com-
panies in different countries altogether
trust one another. Given the choice be-
tween joining with an American com-
pany and with another European com-
pany, they nearly always choose the
first; and this is what really worries
the Eurocrats-for it is a centrifugal
force in the middle of Europe.
It is not difficult to guess at some
of the roots of this distrust. Not only
is the American company usually rich-
er and technically more advanced; the
whole history of European company
relationships is filled with traumas.
For instance, after each war, scores
of German companies saw their patents
and brand-names expropriated by their
European rivals.
Alfred Conrad, an American legal
expert on mergers (most experts on
Europe nowadays are American) con-
cluded in a monograph on ‘Corpor-
ate Fusion in the Common Market’:
‘The most important need is not tech-
nical, but political. It is the need for
a prospect of permanence in the Euro-
pean community, and a prospect of
genuine co-operation among its mem-
bers in achieving its objectives.’ After
talking to European tycoons on the
subject, I feel more convinced of the
truth of this; the blocking of political
Europe also blocks the development
of European companies.
But the question of European com-
panies leads to a broader question:
can there really be such a thing as a
genuinely international company? Of
course, every big company likes to
call itself that: ‘We are a truly inter-
national enterprise,’ says the British
chairman, before going on to congrat-
ulate his British co-directors on their
British profits, and to complain about

the British tax imposed by the Brit-
ish Chancellor. The Americans are
equally keen on the international tag,
making speeches in Europe about their
world-wide company before they fly
back to Cincinnati or Minnesota. But
the least one can expect of an inter-
national company, surely, is that it
has one foreign director; and by Amer-
ican federal law, companies with def-
ence contracts (which means most big
companies) cannot have a non-Amer-
ican director on the main board.
In the European field, people often
quote the cases of Shell and Unilever,
both half-English and half-Dutch, with
a sharing of directorships and duties
written into their constitutions: surely
these are on the way to being genuine-
ly international? But in fact one has
the impression that the English-Dutch
balance is so difficult to maintain
(almost as difficult as balancing the
Flemish and Walloons in the Belgian
civil service) that it makes it harder
not easier, to internationalise further.
In theory, a truly international
corporation, with international direct-
ors and shareholders, could have great
advantages for the companies and even
for the peace of the world. Certainly
if the big American companies had
European directors, they would be less
vulnerable to attacks on their ‘indust-
rial hegemony,' and the growing resent-
ments about brain drains and techno-
logical gaps could be mitigated if the
Europeans could only feel that these
were partly their companies.
The more sophisticated American
companies do, of course, appoint senior
European directors; the president of
IBM Europe, Jacques Maisonrouge, is
a Frenchman with considerable powers.
But the major investment decisions
are taken by the all-American main
board. No one doubts where the ult-
imate power lies.
Are there signs of change? One
might expect, as more and more com-
panies outgrow their domestic markets,
that they would begin to shed their
national characteristics. But big com-
panies in small countries do not seem
to suggest this; Philips is very insist-
ently Dutch, and Nestle’s Is almost
exaggeratedly Swiss. And the current
wave of centralisation, which many big
companies in Europe are undergoing
tends to give more power to the main,
national, board; as the competition
gets stiffer, the men from head office
of Mobil, or Procter and Gamble, or

C-Day: February 14,1966. On Changeover Day,
Australia switched its money system from pounds,
shillings and pence to the dollar-and-cents
decimal system.
Twelve special knuckle joint presses, manufactured
by the Commonwealth Government Ordnance
Factory, Bendigo, are installed at the Royal
Australian Mint, Canberra where they coin both
surfaces and the edges of the gleaming new
currency. E. W. Bliss Company designed the presses
and specified Timken tapered roller bearings for
the flywheels where both radial and thrust loads
are encountered.
With their tapered design, Timken bearings handle
these loads smoothly. They provide thousands of
hours of dependable, maintenance-free operation.
But you don’t have to own a mint to profit from
Timken bearings. Similar presses could be stamping
out automobile bodies, washers or whatever you
want to make. The important thing is to have
Timken bearings where the heavy loads converge.
Then you can bank the money you may be spending
now on maintenance.

Agrisearch
A gaggle of
goosegrowers
THEY ARE DIRTY things but robust
and easy to rear. Above all, they are
very efficient users of feed and rela-
tively cheap to support on farms where
they can be grazed on pasture. Oddly
enough, few people seem to have
attempted the production of goose meat
on a commercial scale. As a sideline,
geese are certainly worth serious con-
sideration and they might suit for part-
time farmers, too.
Marketing might present some prob-
lems. People are not accustomed to
eating goose; presumably a taste for this
meat would develop if there was a
regular supply of good-quality goslings
offering. Eating habits are not nearly
as inflexible as they once were. Turkey
is becoming increasingly popular, yet
the flesh is rather dry and blandly
flavored and most birds are too large
for today’s small families and the
average festivity. Moreover, turkey is
expensive, say, 65 cents a lb.—and
dearer around Christmas. At a guess,
goose could retail at 20 cents a lb. less.
A fine gosling ready for the oven
weighs about 61b. or a bit heavier,
whereas turkeys lighter than 81b. are
always scarce. Ducks, generally, fall
into a lower weight group and their
eating quality tends to be very variable.
Still, ducks, too, bear thinking about.
Like geese, their commercial potential
has not been fully exploited. Some
breeds, for instance, are prodigious
layers. The Indian Runner sometimes
produces an egg a day for a year or
more before taking a rest. Flocks
averaging 300 eggs a year would not be
unusual. Of course, it is said that duck
eggs are too strongly flavored for the
Australian palate, but a Dutchman
would not agree. Besides, given a suit-
ably constructed diet, ducks will lay
mild-tasting eggs.
People with poultry on their minds
rushed into the broiler business a few
years ago. Now there is a surfeit of
chicken, prices are depressed, and com-
petition is cut-throat. A man might be
lucky to turn 15 cents on a bird after
scrupulous effort. In short, broiler pro-
duction is no place no more for the
small man. You could hardly call him
“chicken” fot getting out. However,
instead of tamely rejoining the ranks
of the wage slaves, those with suitable
farms, especially if they happen to be
located near large centres of Dutch or

other European settlement, might make
a go of geese or ducks.
Mr. A. R. Evans, of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, has recently
completed a pilot trial of commercial
goose production. He has compiled some
very helpful and encouraging facts and
figures. Thus, his enterprise showed a
gross profit of 94 cents per gosling and
he believes that this figure could be
lifted into the vicinity of $1.20 per bird.
Next time he would give his geese less
finisher ration and force them to make
better use of pasture. He ran 34 geese
per acre on an irrigated block, but the
stocking rate could have been much
higher. Much grass was wasted, as the
area had to be mowed .several times to
keep the pasture from getting too rank.
The goslings were ready for slaughter
at 16 weeks of age. Half the cost of
getting them to this point went in
tucker, but the day-old goslings cost $1
each—which seems rather high. On the
other hand, brooding worked out at
only 10 cents a head. Particularly while
they are young, geese are impressively
efficient converters of feed to meat.
Over the first eight weeks body-weight
increased by lib. for every 1.31 b. of
feed supplied. Even turkeys don’t do
nearly as well as this. Over their first
eight weeks each lb. gain in body-
weight swallows up on the average
2.751 b. of feed. And they need a ration
with a higher protein content than
geese. At maturity geese are still
slightly more efficient.
Housing for geese need only be
elementary compared with that required
for other poultry, including ducks.
Disease among geese is virtually
unknown. Preparation for market is not
the problem that people fear it to be.
The carcasses pluck pretty clean in
ordinary rubber-fingered spinner-type
pluckers, providing they are first scalded
for two minutes in water with a dash
of detergent at 145 deg. F. Unless ducks
can be slaughtered before they reach 14
weeks moulting may begin and the
plucking process then has to cope with
a mess of pin feathers. Finally, if you
are planning to try geese you won’t be
plagued with a problem of choice of
breed. There are really only two:
Embdem and Toulouse. The cross
makes a very satisfactory compromise.
If you are going to stick with
broilers, here’s a hint from the poultry
specialist in Western Australia. Pro-
ducers who have instituted 24-hour
lighting are liable to suffer heavy losses
should the power fail. Terrified by a
darkness they have never known since
leaving the egg the birds throng on top
of each other seeking security, but many
may suffocate. Since the fear response
develops in chicks when they are
between seven and ten days old, the
lights should be deliberately switched
off several times during the first week.
This way they learn about dark without
taking fright and they remember the
lesson for the rest of their lives.


House and garden
are one
One of a series, "Living is an Art," by SHEELAH WOOD
MR. FREDERICK THONEMANN,
physicist, is a man of great vitality and
many interests. He is married to Pam
Clelland, the Adelaide barrister. Be-
fore the war Mr. Thonemann studied in
Canada, England, and the United
States. During the war he served in the
RAAF and was stationed in Washing-
ton as a radar officer working in liaison
with the American Air Force. After the
war he returned to America and took
up an appointment at the University of
Chicago.
He has done a lot of travelling, and
prefers Europe to England, though he
lived there once for some time. He

swimming-pool by the Thonemanns. It
is surrounded by willows and native
trees and has a rustic landing-stage
says, “I always felt like a chrysanthe-
mum tied to a stake in London. Be-
sides, the food!” When he returned to
Australia he took up cooking, but ad-
mits that if it were possible for him to
hire a French chef he’d never step into
the kitchen again. He does all the shop-
ping once a week with his wife, but it
is he who buys all the exotic extras,
and he is a compulsive buyer in the
more expensive delicatessens. He has
his own herb garden, and also grows a
few vegetables that are not easily
obtainable.
The Thonemanns live in a house in
an acre of dreamy bushland and garden,
which appears to be as nature arranged,
but is actually, in fact, the result of an
enormous amount of hard work and
imagination. It is impossible for a
photograph to do it justice. Everything
is scaled to size, and one turns and
wanders down small paths surrounded
by a mass of native shrubbery and
flowers, ferns, ground cover, azaleas,
camellias, and a great number of
sweet-scented herbs and shrubs. Mr.
Thonemann has also dammed the creek
that flows through the property, and
has made a small lake, which they use
as a swimming-pool.
He drew all the plans for the house,
offices of his wife, and the small tea-
house overlooking the lake, but em-
ployed an architect to supervise the
building. The fireplace in the living-

the grate to remove the ashes. This
was his own idea.
Their taste in furniture is modern.
He says that he can go back 2000 years
for his ceramics and, though not an
acquisitive person, yearns for some
original Tang dynasty pieces. He has a
large collection of modern Japanese
tableware of china bowls and plates.
He lives in Australia by choice, but
if he was wealthy enough he would live
in other parts of the world at different
times and commute!
WINES
Mr. Thonemann suggests—
LUNCHEON A sparkling hock
Seppelt’s Great Western or Lindeman’s
Cuvee served throughout is excellent.
On a hot day chilled lager beer served
with the crayfish may be as good as
anything. Cointreau served with coffee
is an apt finish to this delicate lun-
cheon.
DINNER Small cups of hot sake
served in the Japanese style, while
exotic, are fully justified gastronomic-
ally. Otherwise, Riesling—Lindeman’s
Bin 23, 1965, is fine. The braised squab
demands a full red Lindeman’s Bur-
gundy, Bin 50, 1964, or Henschke’s

BOOKS
$180 for a Swede
—Greeks at 10c
By JOHN PATERSON.
Arrivals and Departures. James Jupp.
Cheshire, Lansdowne. $3.00.
MORE THAN two million migrants
came. Some left. The majority were
British and the rest were at least white.
The British came for “a better start”
for their children. The Southern Euro-
peans came for the dough. The net
result was that by 1965 there were two
million people living in Australia who
weren’t born here. Jim Jupp was a
Brit, who came (in 1957) and left in
1966.
Jupp made a major contribution to
the political life of Melbourne Univer-
sity. A British Trotskyist, he found the
Victorian ALP Executive too left and
lived continuously on the brink of expul-
sion. He left two books when he de-
parted—“ Australian Party Politics,” the
standard text in its field, and “Arrivals
and Departures.”
Apart from the normal academic fact-
grubbing techniques, Jupp used a re-
search method which is currently out of
vogue with academic political scientists.
He drank at the national clubs, wan-
dered around hostels, followed the
national Presses, and ultimately in-
sinuated himself into the social lives of
a variety of migrant groups.
Such slipshod methods would not
have done from a student in these days
of elaborate questionnaires, paid inter-
viewers, and computer analysis. The
only justification lies in the result. Jupp
has produced a first-class piece of social
analysis and some novel and valuable
policy recommendations.
Australia has tended to estimate the
success of the post-war immigration
program in terms of a body count. A
secondary goal was that as many bodies
as possible should be British, or failing
that, at least Nordic. Sixty percent of
the intake is currently British, but these
days it is costing $lBO for each Swede
we attract, compared with 10 cents for
a Greek.
Jupp makes a number of observations
on the shortcomings of “official” policy
toward recruitment and assimilation of
migrants. The salient feature of official
policy is its treatment of “migrants” as
a homogeneous commodity.
In fact, each national group has its
typical aspirations, its distinctive loves
and hates. Italians want a house of their
own. They want to surround themselves
with relatives. They don’t want their
kids corrupted by Australian ways. Like
the Greeks, they come mainly for econo-
mic reasons and are unmoved by our
space and sunshine. They are highly
sensitive to economic fluctuations, be-
lieving (correctly) that they will be the
first unemployed and knowing that they
will get no social service benefits unless
they are naturalised.
The Greeks dwell less on a home of
their own, but are dismayed by the
Australian home - centred existence.
They are stifled by our drinking and
Sabbath observance laws. Other Euro-
peans are dismayed by the grudging
recognition of skills and qualifications,
while the British, who do come for
space and sunshine rather than to better
themselves financially, find it hard to
look on the sunny side of hostel life.
Official policy has been to promote
“assimilation” and to discourage
migrant communalism. The only prob-
lem here is that there is no Australian
community as such, only a series of
social circles based on common interests
and the normal social and institutional
bonds. What could be more natural
than for migrants to find their greatest
affinities among their fellow country-
men? The Good Neighbor Council can
never be a satisfactory answer to the
desire for contact in the native language
with people sharing a common culture
and life experience. Poor immigrants,
denied social services and without pub-
lic housing, have only their national
Immigrants. .. the first two million
communities to fall back on for com-
pany, advice, and some social security.
Official policy is to measure success
in assimilation by the conformity
achieved with Australian mores.
Migrants often see Australian ways as
inferior to those they leave behind.
Jupp allows the premise that many
qualities of our national life are not
excellent beyond peer, so, naturally, he
comes up with a different analysis from
those who rule such a premise out of
bounds.
Thus a failed migrant might be a
successful human being. Australia might
have little to offer him and he might
repatriate himself. He will be officially
viewed as a negative factor in the
Arrivals/Departures ratio. It might be
more profitable to view him as a com-
ment on the Australian Way of Life.
Peace crusade
By NANCY KEESING
Subtle Flame. Katharine Susannah
Prichard. Australasian Book Society.
$3.95.
“SUBTLE FLAME” is a long novel set
in Melbourne in the 19505. The central
character is David Evans, a newspaper
editor, whose son has been killed in
the Korean war. This death leads
Evans to question his own professional
honesty and responsibility; to espouse
the causes of nuclear disarmament and
peace; and to abandon all close family
ties while he seeks means of expiating
his feelings of personal guilt.
At one level the book shows Evans’
search for valid ways of helping the


peace crusade; trying to rescue Tony, a
youth trapped in meshes of drug traf-
ficking and gang organisation; and
overcoming his own tendencies to lapse
into deep mental discouragement and
physical derangement.
No doubt many readers will find a
difficulty in approaching this novel
objectively. Indeed, much propagandist
literature is hard to assess in artistic
terms at its time of publication. But
there are entirely different reasons why
I think “Subtle Flame” may be read
rewardingly some years hence.
The chief point is that Katharine
Susannah Prichard in her large cast
of characters includes numerous young
people from many of Melbourne’s
social strata. The book’s period is pre-
cisely that in which youthful behaviour,
values, and slang, both general and
cult (as with the bodgies), began to
exhibit such rapid changes that few
writers who are not themselves very
young have successfully depicted this
group for twenty-odd years.
Some older authors have partly
solved the problem by avoiding youth-
ful dialogue as much as possible. Miss
Prichard does not take this easy way,
but as a result the total effect of much
of the book, despite its firm tie to actual
events, is peculiarly placeless and time-
less. It will be some years before
“Subtle Flame” can be correctly placed
in its important author’s impressive
body of work.

ROBERT CREELEY is a young
American with a small reputation in
poetry and short stories. “The Island,”
his first novel, is of the kind one would
expect from a writer with his back-
ground; introspective, perhaps nar-
cissistic in its dwelling on private griefs,
certainly deeply felt.
The island of his story is a small one
off the Spanish coast, remote but still
boasting its colony of runaway Ameri-
cans. John is one of them, an intense
but, one would gather, fairly untalented
novelist, who spends most of his time
worrying about his wife.
John finally cracks up under the
strain, much to the surprise of his
friends and family, none of whom
seemed to know that he was especially
worried about anything. This implicit
accusation of a lack of concern on the
part of loved ones is characteristic of
the more adolescent autobiographical
novels, and Creeley’s insistence on ex-
pressing every shade of disappointment,
disillusion, and depression through
which his hero passes marks his book as
an immature work.
Creeley’s errors of intent might have
been mitigated by a clear writing style,
but “The Island” instead is one of the
least well-phrased novels ever to see
the light of day. An attempt at intri-
cate Jamesian sentences fails com-
pletely through his indifferent grasp of
grammar, and misplaced clauses make
nonsense out of his words.
One respects Mr. Creeley’s sincerity.
He obviously expresses in “The Island”
many deeply personal and intimate
truths about his attitude to life, which,
if only because they are truths, deserve
our attention. Nor is he a bad writer;
merely one led astray by a faulty sense
of style.
Claims of greatness can be made with
more justice of Ann Quin’s “Berg,” a
vicious, compelling novel of the type
one would least expect from a young
Englishwoman. Its brutality is neither
especially British in its genesis nor
female in tone, suggesting that Miss
Quin has gone to the Americans Rechy
and Miller for her inspiration. Hers is
the same milieu, a grimy world of
sodden streets and peeling posters,
inhabited by people who long ago
passed beyond the understanding and
concern of society.
Alastair Berg, seedy, impotent, mad,
arrives in a midwinter seaside town,
deserted but for a few residents creep-
ing along until the season comes. He
has gone there to murder his father,
who lives in a decrepit boarding-house
with his young mistress. Gaining
encouragement from frequent letters
sent by an adored mother, he rents the
room next to the couple and gains their
confidence. Spying, listening through the
night to their sounds, Berg feeds on his
hatred until a chance comes to attack.
The resolution of Berg’s grisly story
is largely unimportant beside Miss
Quin’s evocation of mood. As in “The
Island,” landscape and weather reflect
the mental disturbance of the main
character, mirroring in their confusion
a slow slide toward madness, but
“Berg” achieves this relationship with
greater accuracy, giving the book a
damp, grey atmosphere entirely appro-
priate to the story.
Beneath the sun
By NANCY KEESING
The Sweet-vendor. R. K. Narayan.
Bodley Head. $2.65.
IN MALGUDI, a small southern Indian
town, lives the widower Jagan with his
son, Mali. Jagan is an obstinate,
muddle-headed health crank versed in
Hindu lore and Gandhi’s teachings. In
his youth he aspired to a B.A. degree
but never passed his final examinations.
In his young manhood he rioted in
support of Gandhi and went to prison.
In his middle years he established a
prosperous sweetmeat business employ-
ing efficient staff and wrote an unpub-
lished book explaining his notions about
diet and health.
Essentially, Jagan is a supine char-
acter who shrugs off anything disagree-
able to himself his apparent successes
are heavily dependent upon other
people.
Unfortunately, his son inherited all
Jagan’s worst traits and faults in exag-
gerated forms, and goes his own sweet
way, confident that his dotin' l ' parent
will tolerate any enormity which does
not violate basic Hindu principles.
Mali rifles Jagan’s hidden horde of
money and makes for America, whence,
after several years, he returns with a
Korean wife and plans for manufactur-
ing a machine to write novels. These
two live in Jagan’s house, upset his
routine, canvass (unsuccessfully) his
support for their crazy venture, and
generally make Jagan very confused
indeed.
At its simplest level Narayan offers
an urbane and delicious comedy of
characters. Beneath the fun lurk deeper
implications. Clashes between genera-
tions are presented with beautiful irony,
but even more ironic and disturbing is
the real failure of Mali and his wife
and Jagan to interpret sensibly what
they have read and experienced of
Western mores and technology.
If it is true, as many contemporary
Indian novelists seem to believe, that
numerous Indian students misunder-
stand their Western-oriented tertiary
education, either at home or abroad,
then how useful are many of our well-
intentioned aid programs?
It would be absurd to suggest that
in this novel Jagan is supposed to sym-
bolise India herself, but nevertheless
it is significant to notice how he solves
his multifarious problems. He attaches
himself to a possibly bogus religious
sculptor and opts out of Malgudi for an
old age of age-old contemplation.
Belch of contempt
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Macßird. Barbara Garson. Penguin
Books. 80 cents.
PARABLE AT DUNSINANE, parody
at Dallas. Twenty-five-year-old Bar-
bara Garson, of Berkeley’s “Students for
a Democratic Society,” wrote the play
solely for campus delectation. But as
she hints that Johnson willed Kennedy’s
death the production was escalated
to New York and hence to national
notoriety. It has sold over half a mil-
lion copies, has been produced in Lon-
don by Littlewood, is about to be
staged in Sydney and Melbourne, and
has made the previously impecunious
Mrs. Garson in her own words
“independently rich.”
Garson draws her pop-Shakespeare
from half-a-dozen plays in addition to
“Macbeth,” and her writing is as rough
as bags. The characters repeatedly
lapse from their pseudo-Bard into four-
letter, colloquial bluntness, or into
simple, pedestrian prose.
However, when Garson gets going,


she turns in language of Elizabethan
gutsiness. Shakespeare’s witches’ chant
might have been better presented than
Garson’s, but its ingredients were almost
as repellent.
“Taylor’s tongue and Goldberg’s
slime,
Macnamara’s bloody crime,
Sizzling skin of napalmed child,
Roasted eyeballs, meek and mild.”
For all her Left-wing fundamen-
talism, it’s wrong to assume that Mrs.
Garson is simply anti-Johnson. She
does express a strong aesthetic revul-
sion for the wheeler-dealing charac-
teristics of Macßird—but she finds the
politics of the Ken O’Duncs equally
amoral and repugnant.
“We must expose this subtle Bob-cat’s
claws;”
and
“He’s just like all the rest. They’re all
alike.”
Much of the play is gawky and
undergraduate, and Garson rarely
attempts to avoid the over-obvious.
However, there is much which is funny
and inventive. The Earl of Warren
and Wayne of Morse are effectively
parodied. Teddy Kennedy plays an
idiot Robin to Bobby’s crusading Bat-
man. Lady Macßird’s “out damned
spot” speech becomes a plea for
LBJ’s highway beautification plans.
Overseas reports insist that “Macßird”
plays far better than it reads.
It is anarchistic, indicating American
liberalism’s alleged greed for power
and rejecting one by one its heroes.
Only Stevenson —“The Egg of Head”—
is treated with any compassion, but he,
too, is seen to compromise with politi-
cal philistinism and falls from Garson’s
grace.
The play is a comic-strip, graffiti,
ephemeral; it is far more a vulgar
belch of contempt that a lucid cry of
protest, and the only inflammatory
action it seems to require from its
audience is an informal vote in the ’6B
Presidential Elections.
The funniest lines in the Penguin
edition come not from Garson but
from the blurb-writer. He has chosen,
with splendid malice, a quotation from
LBJ’s statement on World Theatre Day
last year. “To the artists of the stage,
who give us all mankind in all its dis-
guises and so give us ourselves as we
truly are, I pay tribute . . .”
Thisness of things
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Tree That Walked. John Fuller,
Chatto and Windus. $2.55.
THE MOST STRIKING thing about
“The Tree That Walked” is the fresh-
ness of its language., the purity of its
diction. Mr. Fuller’s precision is in-
separable from his sense for what Hop-
kins called the thisness of things.
Whether he. is writing of the land-
scapes of Western New York, a bronze
Sardinian centaur, or the Piazza San
Marco, there is a sense of places and
things riding free from the emotion
that simultaneously supports and
releases them, so that the, general effect
of his poetry is one of delighted
tenderness and detachment. Mr. Fuller’s
gift for images is remarkable: “The
pond is hideous, a mug of teeth”; “The
Snot of newts.” He can charge a single
word with unusual resonance, as in the
very fine poem “Hedge Tutor,” when
he writes: “No one believes more than
a tiny tract”—where tract has both its
meanings. He can develop a brilliant
notion with playful seriousness in “An
Exchange Betwe.en The Fingers and
The Toes.” Perhaps the finest poem
in this very short book is “Out of the
Wood,” a sonnet sequence that explores
the relationship between objects and
the imagination with a sparkling and
fastidious accuracy of image—
The hook is baited, and the fishes
sleep
With eyes half-lidded in the pencilled
stream,
Their fawn and violet haunches
moving deep
Among the deep green of the angler’s
dream.
But if they spring to snap with
cartoon jaws,
The angler tumbles in the woodcut
reeds,
Hamper and worms behind him: he
implores
Each watery god to wink at his mis-
deeds.
So we relax, suspending resolution,
Brood on opacity in a clear world
Till the events we gambled with are
hurled
Behind us. We achieve our dis-
solution
In that cool time before the wheel
spins faster
Between the reverie and the disaster.
For sheer wit, intelligence, and what
Henry James once re.ferred to as “sav-
ing sharpness,” this is the best book of
poems I’ve reviewed this year.
Very Hardy
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Thomas Hardy’s Personal Writings.
Edited by Harold Orel. Macmillan.
$5.30.
THROUGHOUT A GOOD deal of his
long career Thomas Hardy was plagued
by the necessity of having to justify or
elucidate the philosophy implicit in his
writings, especially the Wessex novels.
Hardy was not a good controversialist.
Polemics did not come easily to the shy,
withdrawn inhabitant of Max Gate. He
felt that if people did not understand
the view of life expressed in “Tess” and
“Jude” it was almost impossible to
enlighten them by painstaking explica-
tion.
Nevertheless, as new editions of his
books were published, he frequently
added prefaces, sometimes two or three
in successive editions, to answer critics
and enlarge on his intensely personal
vision of the meaning and end of human
existence. He labored to show that he
was an “evolutionary meliorist” and not
a mere godless pessimist, as some critics
asserted, and that when he called Tess
“a pure woman” he was concerned with
a morality higher than fashionable con-
vention.
These prefaces form one section of
Professor Orel’s collection, which also
includes Hardy’s introductions to the
books of other writers, a selection of
his literary criticisms (among them a
most sympathetic and understanding
study of the Dorset dialect poet William
Barnes), and—by far the most pleasur-
able part —some tenderly evocative
reminiscences of the Wessex of his
youth, much of which he used again
in more highly wrought form in his
novels.
Some of the more ephemeral pieces
were perhaps hardly worth reprinting.
But this is a book for the Hardy
specialist and for the Hardy enthusiast
to whom every scrap of the master’s
writing is dear.
Sacrifices
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Two Riders of the Storm. Jean Giono.
Owen. $4.15.
The Portuguese Princess. Tibor Dery.
Calder and Boyars. $4.60.
JEAN GIONO’S new novel contains,,
quite literally, some of the bloodiest
writing I have ever come across —blood
squirts from severed arteries, gushes
from slit bellies, and seeps from mys-
terious sacs; it gurgles into the snow,
it fills wooden tubs, and it reeks with
an overpowering stench. In a glorious
orgy of ripping flesh and crunching
bones, told with tremendous gusto, the
distinguished French author unfolds the
tragedy of two peasant-farmer brothers
and their strange obsessional love-hate
relationship.
The struggle between this modern
Cain and Abel is for power in its most
primitive form sheer physical
supremacy. The idea is old, but the
approach has a new, intense poetic
beauty that transforms all the gore into
an elemental force, a symbol of life and
death. At first, like a burnt offering,
Marceau proudly lays his great strength
at the feet of his 20-year-younger
brother “Mon Cadet.” He is expressing
his love for the boy when he kills a
mad horse on the rampage in a crowded
village fairground with a single knock-
out punch and defeats two renowned
Provence wrestling champions with ease.
Inevitably, as the younger brother
reaches his own prime, he catches the
lust for power and suddenly demands

another kind of homage. He forces the
aging Marceau to use him as a
wrestling partner and succeeds in over-
throwing him again and again. Marceau
is shattered. He refuses his blessing. Life
has lost its meaning. Ambushing “Mon
Cadet,” he slashes him open with a
meathook. The sacrifice is complete.
Just as powerful but entirely different
in style is the eminent Hungarian
Tibor Dery’s stark collection of war-
torn short stories. He achieves tremen-
dous impact with bursts of staccato
phrases, rapped out with the deadly
accuracy of machine-gun fire. His old
women and children, crammed into the
claustrophobic “underworld” cellars of
Budapest, smelling of fear, come loom-
ing in and out of the candle-lit shadows
like grotesques.
There is macabre humor, too, in “The
Parcel”; a disobliging corpse that is
mysteriously shuttled backward and
forward from outside a poor man’s
cellar to a rich man’s, and back again.
And miracles of rethink occur in “Fear”
as, overnight, Nazis become democrats
and Resistance workers.
The title story handles a sentimental
theme without a scrap of sentimentality.
Three homeless little vagabonds, claw-
ing and cheating their way through the
countryside, catch a glimpse of their
lost childhood at their first fairground
theatre, “The Portuguese Princess.”
This vision of magic gradually becomes
a terrible indictment of man’s senseless
inhumanity to man.
Modern condition
By J. M. COUPER
Alpha and Omega. Isaac Rosenfeld.
Macßibbon and Kee. $3.85.
WHEN YOU HAVE laid down this
book of short stories you have with you
the janitor, the postman, the prostitute,
the dancer, the paralytic, and George,
who put on his hat and walked out of
a window on the first floor. He was
taking action against a woman who had
removed her clothes and was standing
nude at the party. The view bored him,
so he left by the nearest place, peace-
fully.
With faceless people, nakedness is no
relief. Clothes are nearly off now, in
any case. But no exploit, however
glorious, can redeem these people into
persons. The janitor has, or is about
to have, 61 children, two wives, a
common-law wife not without hope of
promotion, and a long string of women
with first names only, like George. It is
impossible to care about any of them.
What are they among so many?
In order to communicate, the para-
lytic bores holes all over his floor and
makes a peep-show of the lonely dancer
below. She has tried to encourage mere
conversation, but that is unthinkable.
There must at all costs be loneliness,
whatever else. It is the modern con-
dition. Intelligent, sensitive, ironic, the
writer is staring into nothing. The
stories are honest, even cheerful, but
with nowhere to go, and Rosenfeld
knows it so well and says it so clearly
and he is dead: died of a heart attack
at thirty-eight. He is Rousseauish in
reverse, seeking no happy country, con-
tent to explore the stark, stark loneliness
of a civilised world.
The stories themselves are glimpses.
Or it is as if they were written with
the left hand. All the gifts are there,
but the drive is wanting. Without im-
pulsion of plot or character, they are
in danger of becoming essays, faintly
irritating, like prose that is not quite
poetry or poetry that is not quite prose.
Nothing is seen to move. There is the
landscape of life, but no interest in
people, and therefore the people, like
the Arabs, steal away.
The last three stories snap the lights
on at the critical moment, nail you
hopelessly at a keyhole with the im-
potent hero, drape you in a solemn
curtain to watch King Solomon in all
his satiety. Why should we be made so
jealous of other people’s performances?
But if you admire or need these polite
indulgences of greed and envy, if you
fancy yourself in the attitudes and with
the pulse of a comfortable Peeping
Tom, here is the tail-end of a book to
content you. Or to ruffle your peace?
Something is set on edge, but I think
it is only the reader’s teeth.

Whose Jerusalem?
The reference to schismatic Maronite
priests in your article “Whose Jerusa-
lem?” (8., July 29) is grossly inaccurate
and misleading. Apart from the fact
that there are no schismatic Maronite
priests in Jerusalem or anywhere else,
the Maronites have never been separated
from the Holy See by schism throughout
their long and glorious history.
Since 1895 the Patriarch of the
Maronites who resides in Lebanon has
been represented in the Holy City by a
Patriarchal Vicar. Life for the Chris-
tians under the Israeli regime is always
difficult, and the plight of the refugees
bears witness to this fact. The very
thought of Israeli occupation of the
Holy City must be viewed with the
greatest apprehension by all Christians
—orthodox and heterodox.

Value of the Fill
Mr. Barrett’s conclusions (8., July 29)
regarding the value of the Fill don’t
even get off the ground. It is axiomatic
that only the very best in military
equipment is acceptable to a people
willing to fight. Cost is secondary. The
Israelis have recently demonstrated
this point using Mirages; one may well
imagine a different story if equipped
with only Super-Sabres or Hawker
Hunters (FGA 9) against Mig 21s.
The disastrous decision to tool up for
production of Wirraways as “fighters”
early in World War II is still too
painful to contemplate. Yet, while
criticising the Fill as obsolescent, Mr.
Barrett would have us produce aircraft
which are now even more obsolete.
It is an unenviable task to choose
weaponry for our country and I am
glad the job is not mine. I’m also twice
as glad that it is not Mr. Barrett’s.

No subsidy
May I correct one misstatement in your
article on “Dairyfarming” (8., July 22)?
In fact, there has been no subsidy on
dairy products paid to British farmers
since 1961/62. Nor are there production
quotas for British dairyfarmers and. in
consequence, no penalty for failing to
meet these non-existent quotas.

Action painting
Elwyn Lynn’s “Puritans in Affluent
America” (8., July 22) made interest-
ing reading. However, I would like to
question his statement about the work
of Roy Lichtenstein . . but these
painters are mainly anxious about the
validity of their forms . . . Lichten-
stein is not sending up action painting
when he ‘paints’ a brush stroke, or
Picasso when he does a cloisonne benday
dot form from that master; he is after
new forms from old shapes. It’s too far
from Picasso to be parody and too in-
tent on form to be satire.”
Lucy R. Lippard, New York editor
for “Art International,” a writer of
one of the introductions to the Ameri-
can Art Exhibition catalogue, states in
her book “Pop Art” that Lichtenstein’s
paintings of brush strokes are, in fact,
a parody of action painting and of
Picasso when he does a “dot-version”
of a Picasso. I would be inclined to
agree with Lucy Lippard, who has been
involved in Pop Art produced in New
York, including Lichtenstein’s work.

Ties that bind
In “the ties that bind forever,” con-
cerning Old Boys and Old Girls of
various schools, one statement was abso-
lutely erroneous and I feel I can correct
it with authority.
The article stated that “Sydney Boys’
High moved from the place where
David Jones’ main store is now . . .”
Sydney Boys’ High was never on this
Elizabeth Street site. I was a first-year
student at the historic old stone build-
ing when the school moved to the
new building on the site of the old
Zoo in 1921—Sydney Boys’ High moved
to the now adjacent building some years
later. I cannot recollect where it was
before, but quite definitely it was not
in Elizabeth Street.
I correct your statement on behalf
of 20 of my old class friends of that
period, who still meet at private homes
about every two months—apart from
attending the annual Sydney Girls’ High
dinner at the Australia Hotel on Foun-
dation Day in October each year. An
average attendance at that dinner would
be about 400, and we feel Sydney
Girls’ High was equally worthy of men-
tion in your article, as it is as old as, if
not older than, Sydney Boys’ High.

Mr. Harry Jackman’s letter (8., July

Fine food
Cellarmaster’s experience in the Suf-
folk pub (8., July 29), to which pride
of place was accorded in “One More
Week,” was apparently too insignificant
for him to find words of his own in his
preceding three columns. With what
obvious relish was omission exploited
to serve a policy seemingly intent upon
persistently denigrating all things
British.
Your tendentious comment conceals
the fact that bread, cheese, and pickles
was the fare of a rustic England. City
dwellers of another age, who come by
car, usually look for catering on a more
ample scale and there can be few
country hostelries boasting a dining-
room from which today’s roving fami-
lies will not emerge well satisfied.
Fortunately, few of the thousands of
tourists who contemplate visiting Britain
will be discouraged by your malice.
British beer may be “warm” by our
frosty standards, but at least a stranger
of either sex can drink it in pleasant
enough surroundings in any pub in the

Ghana's currency
It was stated in “Ghana Example
for N.Z.” (8., July 22) that the cur-
rency devaluation announced in Accra
on July 8, 1967, was the second one of
its kind undertaken by Ghana.
This is not correct and probably
derives from a misinterpretation of the
first currency exercise undertaken by
the present Ghana Government; simply
one of reformation, after which the
unit of the new decimal currency was
shifted from 100 pence (8/4) to ten
shillings (10/-) for convenience. This
did not affect the external value of the
Ghana pound.
The later currency exercise initiated
by the present Ghana Government is,
therefore, the first, and, in fact, the only
one of devaluation so far undertaken in
Ghana.

No subsidy for rice
“Must We Butter Up the Dairy Far-
mers?” (B. July 22) takes a very per-
ceptive look at a complex problem.
The author is in error, however, when
he states that . . . “we would save the
money that goes toward subsidising
exports of butter, rice, and sugar.”
There is no subsidy—either Common-
wealth or State —in respect of rice
grown in Australia, whether sold on
the Australian market or sent for
export.
■ Certainly, the import of rice into
Australia is discouraged by an import
duty. Thirty-eight years ago this import
duty was fixed at 1| pence per lb. and
has remained unchanged ever since. Im-
port duties are a protective feature of
virtually every Australian activity from
nuts and bolts to textiles.

Your attack (8., August 5) on de

does not go far enough. Why not state
the whole truth—in its Australian appli-
cation—and acknowledge that our own
Sir Robert Menzies, the Lord Warden
of the Cinque Ports himself, is equally
a 1930 s chauvinist?
Menzies’ plea for a closer association
between the “English speaking peoples”
is equally chauvinistic and equally old-
fashioned. Many illuminating parallels
could be drawn between the Age of
Menzies and the Age of de Gaulle.
