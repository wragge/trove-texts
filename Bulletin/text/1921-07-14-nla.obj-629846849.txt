Napoleon’s values were masculine values.
But even Napoleon regretted that he had
not tailed more with women —“They would
have taught me much that I did not know.
He once closed his New Testament and said:
“Do yon know that I am an understander of
men? Christ was no man.” All his experi-
enced cunning was powerless to explain this
puzzle of a mortal man speaking angel-words
and behaving ■with so serene and exalted an
ignorance of the world. But was not Christ s
tremendous secret just His unique power-of
valuing life as a woman values it? With Christ
love is the categorical imperative, the hey to
life. Without love we can do nothing that
is of value; with love we are immediately
triumphant. Consider how this starry wis-
dom —beyond which, as Goethe sajs, the
human mijid will never soar—-became

the worldly Popes and in the subsequent

ADRIAN LAWLOR.
Henry Edward Manning
Nearly 30 years have passed since the
death or Cardinal Manning, who ■ was an
Archdeacon of Chichester Cathedral, in that
Sussex which has been praised by
Rudvard Kipling, Hilaire Belloc and many
others. He then became a Roman Catholic,
and after a few years was chosen as
Cardinal to govern the faithiu m
Britain. Manning showed himself tuUy
worthy of a clever selection. fit anew
how to play the part, lie was in Ins youth
reputed the handsomest man in England, and
he filled the Roman Catholic prmcely rc-
-alia in the manner of a medioivul Caidinal.
Moreover, he carried on the many eoutio-
versies for his church with a state pre
cision of both fact and argument that aid
much to let Roman Catholicism regain a
nower well-nigh lost. . . .
1 After his death his career was seized by
Purcell, who is accused of having written of
it from the point of view of the old Catho-
lics who had secretly hated Maniimg aud
grudged his rapid promotion. Lhen Ls tton
Struchey, a cousin of the editoro the
Ss'ectaxOß. in his •'Eminent Victoi ians,
wrote a life just as unkindly from the I. ro-
testaut point of view, but wrote it so cleverly
that Mt-ssrs. Chapman and Hull ibsuej about
a dozen editions of the book in its ‘"C 1
year. Now we have a biography of him
written by Shane Leslie, who endeavors to
put the best view of Manning. One of the
English garrison in Ireland, wherebistamy
has lived for several generations, he has
gone over to Rome, and has, therefore, al

PINKETTIS
FOR CONSTIPATION
Constipation is dangerous be-
cause it means that poisonous
materials which should have been
expelled from the body are being
retained. The appetite fails, diges-
tion becomes disordered and the
breath offensive. Pinkettes, the new
laxative, are a real help in correct-
ing constipation.
They do not aggravate the com-
plaint as strong purgatives do; and
they do not wear out in their effects.
Taken according to directions they
assist the patient so that the use of
an opening medicine is not a con-
stant necessity.

Molly.
If I could clash the cymbals of the seas,
And gather up the tongues of all the trees,
That could not even tell the world what
bliss
Clings to the uerfume of your first, pink kiss.
Poets compare their loves to summer days,
Roses and rapture, but there is no praise
Buried in words to sing my love for you,
Oh, wondrous woman, not yet nearly two,

Women.
I mused “There is no death,” and, with a
start,
I thought of a dear woman I had known,
Toung, lovable, and wise of soul and heart,
Who from the earth had flown.
I knew her grave, and went and sat awhile
Beside the quiet grasses listening
For her lost voice. Ah, could the dust defile
A throat which once could sing?
But no voice came; and so I rose in tears,
Groping with blinded hands and fingers
lame
About the stone that marked it all these
years,
And lo! I read my name.
I smiled remembering; and in that light
I saw another woman standing there,
And yet another, in loose raiment white —
Each with my eyes and hair!
Each looked on each, and, looking, laughed
to see
Her perfect, separate self. Then from the
stone
We heard a low laugh break, careless and
free
As ours, in rounder tone. ,
It mocked our unbelief. With mingled mirth
To her our sister self vte gladly ran,
Bearing all light, joy, color that in earth
From sun-stirred dust began.
I mused “There is no death,” and Mother
Eve,
Youthful and blithe to-day as long ago,
Breathed from the place where I had thought
to grieve,
“Love well, for it is so.”

ZORA CROSS.
The House of Time.
I met the chatelaine of Time
With all her keys upon a chain—
Gold keys that made a merry rhyme
About the mansion on the plain.
The ancient house was marked “To Let,”
The rent was low, the garden fair;
I caught a whiff of mignonette
And old musk-rose upon the air.
I thought to lease the house awhile;
I loved it for its vines and bloom;
And she, with welcome in her smile,
Led me from storied room to room.
I climbed the checkered stair of days;
I passed far up to Summer’s towers,
Where tapestries were all ablaze
With jewelled butterflies and flowers.
In Autumn rooms the purple suite
Was languorous and soft with ease,
With silken carpets for the feet,
Leaf-brown as paths beneath the trees.
The Winter basement lined with books
Was curtained to .my thought’s desire;
And by a hundred ingle-nooks
The pine-logs smouldered heartsome fire.
Spring’s windows to the shining east
Were balconied and creeper-twined,
Where morning, like a gentle priest,
Blest daffodils with happy wind.
The chatelaine who held the keys
Passed in and out through every door;
Strange lights went flooding round her knees;
Strange shadows fell along the floor.
And every window tall and fair
Looked to a mountain peak afar,
Where, dim and blue, in higher air.
The long thoughts rose to sun and star.
I dwell within the house awhile.
The maid who bears the keys is kind.
She turns the locks with easy smile
New places for my soul to find.
But gazing far and far I see
The mountain stooping from its throne.
It beckons. Will she go with me
Or must I climb the steeps alone?

McGinnerty.
I sometimes think I’d like to be
A person like McGinnerty.
He has good health, a placid wife,
And twenty pounds a week for life.
Although he’s loud and unrefined
And brainless quite, he doesn’t mind.
He eats and drinks a large amount,
And thinks that his opinions count.
He’s strong and sound in wind and limb,
His liver never troubles him.
When wise men peer his way askance,
In pity of his ignorance,
He s glad ; he thinks each glance is meant
To pay him fitting compliment.
Deride him, and with pride he’ll show
His stodgy morals all a-row.
The grossest thing that stains the sod,
He deems himself the child of God:
He is not meek like me and you—
He’ll tell God what He ought to do.
It must be rather fine to be
A person like McGinnerty.

THE PASSING OF A GUARANTEE.
At the Empire Conference last week leading
members of the Lloyd George Government
told us where we stand as regards naval
defence: —•
While Britain was prepared to defend her out-
posts as far as possible, she was unable to guarantee
that in time of war every dominion would be in-
violate.
Now, even our most vehement anti-militarists
—those who disapprove of compulsory train-
ing and who have passed resolutions against
anv Australian taking part in a war outside
the Commonwealth —possess a naval-defence
policy of a sort. They are not proud of it,
and so it -is rarely if ever mentioned in
public. It amounts to leaving the whole
burden of keeping Australia a high-wage,
white man’s country to the United Kingdom.
The men who at the recent Trade Union
Congress in Melbourne talked with such
scorn of any serious local attempt to defend
Australia in the only place it can be effec-
tively defended —and that is on the high seas
are by no means new r manifestations; nor
are they altogether fools. They are our old
war-time friends, the wary patriot who en-
listed “for home defence only,” and his
brother who refrained from even going as
far as that, but did his bit by keeping a
fi'ghting-man’s job warm for him. The weak-
ness in the position of sharp customers. of
this description is that their period of im-
munity from physical danger or material
expense depends on the willingness of others
to shoulder burdens of which the shirkers
should be bearing at least a part. The high-
spirited will always undertake such duties
up to a point, and are usually misrepre-
sented and hated for doing so. The eligibles
who refrained from joining the A.I.F. had
all sorts of arguments to prove that
those who did join were designing characters
—they were atter the pay and a cheap holi-
day, or they were eager to elude their
creditors. Similarly the local pacifists w r ho
want to leave Britain to defend this country
indefinitely at sea are full of reasons why the
British taxpayers must undertake the busi-
ness as a matter of self-interest. The
‘‘money-bugs” of the City of London have too
many interests here to let the Commonwealth
pass to Asia —that, hitherto, has been the
real sea-defence policy of many of those who
now call themselves Laborites.
. * * *
Who can doubt, apart from the Conference
statement quoted above, and the many others
like it which have been made since the
Armistice, that the old sea-defence standby of
our conscientious objectors has vanished for
ever? The Dominions got far more out of
Britain before the war than Britain got out
of them. The protection of places like Aus-
tralia and Maorilaud w r as in a sense a luxurj
un obligation entered into and sustained
more for glory than profit, like those super-
fluous estates which the landed proprietors
of England have been getting rid of under
the spur of war-taxation. That is a fairly
accurate statement of the situation. But
the British nation, lil* the British squire-
archy, is now cutting out its luxuries in the
endeavor to pay its monstrous war-debts, lhe
United Kingdom used to receive about 40
million pounds sterling per annum from the
U s.A. for interest on loans and for shipping
services. Now, on the authority of a Govern-
ment statement made in the House of Com-
mons last week, “the British debt to America
is approximately £850,000,000, and the
accrued interest upon it unpaid approxi-
mately 408,000,000 dollars.” Much ol the
Northampton boot trade has gone to Massa-
chusetts. American steel is about, L» a ton
cheaper than British, and most of England s
South American and Canadian trade has
been lost. Millions of one-time European
customers are out of action financially, which
is the chief explanation of Britain’s devastat-
ing unemployment problem. Instead of get-
ting it from Wales. France is drawing the
bulk of her coal supplies from the Hu In-
fields ; and while German and Austrian
labor averages (kl. an hour, British indium
tries are not only unable to compete in
the Teuton countries, but find difficulty often
in keeping alive in their own. Add to this
the Irish trouble, which amounts to a
foreign war in itself, and the facts that
lower-deck pay and pensions in the na\t
and marines have been about doubled, while
expeditionary-army pay has soared to fan-
tastic heights. Rankers in the Irish army
of occupation, for example, are getting
a day! When circumstances such as these,
which merely touch the fringe of the British
taxpayer’s troubles, are considered, it
becomes evident that Lloyd George .and
his colleagues, in announcing at the Gonter-
ence their country’s inability to go on pay-
ing the whole of the insurance charges on a
White Australia, spoke in deadly earnest.
The old volunteer army is a casualty, so to
speak. Are the Australians, whose defence
policy on the blue water has been to keep
the home fires burning, going to continue
that seemingly safe but in reality highly
dangerous practice? Do they propose to act
as the English did when, being little more
populous than we are to-day, they heat off
Philip of Spain, or as the natives of the
Indies did in face of the perils represented
by Philip’s ancestors? That more than any
question of wages or hours of lpbor is the
chief issue for the Australian worker; the
worker, like the mediaeval pacifists, who
knew the eonquistadores, and unlike the
modern capitalist, who can invest his money
elsewhere and go there when danger
threatens, being the individual who is chiefly
menaced in a rich and undefended country.
» » * *
The British Government evidently rejects
the notion that any political section in Aus-
tralia worth talking about favors no sea-
defence at all. But someone at the Con-
ference —whether it was a British Minister
or W. M. Hughes is not made clear by the
cable —talked of “a heavy subsidy, provided
adequate strength is maintained in the China
squadron and other forces, with bases in
Australia and Maoriland, co-operating with
the existing ships of the Commonwealth
fleet, which will be kept in a state of effici-
ency.” If there were no inclination in the
Commonwealth to slacken our defence effort
—and for various reasons, all more or less
rotten, there is fairly strong inclination in
that direction—then this subsidy scheme
might well create one. Australia, like
Britain, is in fairiy deep financial waters.
Our debts total £820,000,000, and they are
growing—chiefly by means of scandalously
unnecessary public expenditure. No one
but those immediately concerned would object
if the axe were put to the hundreds of prac-
tically sinecure offices which help to swell
the monstrous figures, in order that funds
might be available for a fleet such as Admiral
Henderson foreshadowed and Admiral
Jellicoe recommended. Few would jib
seriously at further taxation in the cause of
national self-respect as well as national
security. But there would be an almost
unanimous protest if it was suggested that
the Commonwealth should revert to any-
thing resembling the old hired defence
r6gime. The best type of Australian was
ashamed of that arrangement before the war
brought a consciousness of nationhood to
every section of the population; and since
then it has become unthinkable. There is
an unanswerable case for the adequate sea-
defence of Australia —a case which can only
be met logically on the basis that the anti-
defencite is ready, in certain likely eventu-
alities, to become either a coolie or an exile.
But the essence of it is that every penny
voted for the purpose by Parliament must be
be spent on Australian-owned ships carrying
an Australian personnel. If W. M. Hughes
or any member of the Empire. Conference
■wants to help the Internationalists, w 7 ho in
this threatened part of the world are talking
the pacifism which is preached _ though not
practised in Russia, only one thing is needed
—to talk mercenary instead of personal sea-
defence. If the aim is to kill the cause of
our largely-bogus Brethren of Man, the way
to do it is to establish that Britain is too
hardup to keep this a pound-a-dav country
any longer, and that the inhabitants must
do their full share, in men and money, to
prevent it from becoming a 35.-a-day one.
WHERE THE BIG CITY FAILS.
An odd belief exists in Australia, and other
countries are not exempt from it, that the
massing of about half the population of a
State in a huge, dusty, smoky, sprawling
city, abounding in flats, slums, advertise-
ment-hoardings and pony-racecourses, some-
how makes for high thinking as well as
high living. In the multitude of inhabitants,
in short, there is culture, and, population
being the measure of that unmarketable
commodity, Sydney is held to be the most
cultured, or least provincial-minded, city in
the Commonwealth, Melbourne coming next.
Adelaide, Brisbane and l'erth following in
that order, and Hobart, Launceston, New-
castle, Bendigo, Ballarat, _ Toowoomba,
Charters Towers and Kalgoorlie falling into
the humble places assigned to them by that
arbiter elegantiarum the statistician. U£
course, population as a criterion and stand-
ard of comparison of civic intellectuality is
absurd. One of the requisites of true cul-
ture, in the individual and the mass, is
toleration in religious matters. In this
respect the smaller Australian rank
high; the inland towns higher still. Gener-
ally speaking (there may be isolated excep-
tions), the various denominations in these
places are on excellent terms; outbreaks of
bigotry are discouraged; very often the dif-
ferent ministers of religion—Anglican and
Methodist, Salvation Army and ILL.—-are
warm personal friends. On the other hand,
Sydney is cankered with and
Melbourne is spasmodically worse. Bor a
fortnight or more the attention of both
cities was concentrated, to the exclusion of
every other topic of discussiou except the
Test match and the races, on a trumpery dis-
pute between a bishop and a nun. Queues
assembled at seven in the morning outside
the court in which the dreary business was
dissected, and pages of piffling evidence
were published in the daily papers, along
with portraits and sketches of all the people
concerned in the case, from the Judge to
“Soilence-in-the-Coort.” The S. M. llerald
gave as much space to the first day s pro-
ceedings as it did to the outbreak of the
world-war or the conclusion of the armistice.
It is hard to imagine a small sectarian
squabble in an obscure country township
getting even a paragraph in a reputable
London or New York journal; but to the
Herald, Sydney’s richest and most repre-
sentative daily, sectarianism is just as im-
portant as war or peace.
And sectarianism isn’t the only matter in
which the Big City is a fastness of
the provincial spirit. Although the fav-
orite recreations of its masses are
notoriously pony-racing and the moving-
pictures, the claim is made that it
is a musical centre <of vast tonnage, and
the enormous sums raked in by imported
performers are cited as evidence. And cer-
tainly if the money and adulation handed out
to foreign fiddlers and piano-pounders are
touchstones of taste and feeling, Sydney de-
serves to be ranked among the great music-
loving cities of the world, for it lias come to be
known abroad as a place in which any long-
haired poseur with a smart press-agent can
make a punch; and Melbourne is very
little different. But the habit of raving
over alleged Russian geniuses is no proof
of musical culture. The extraordinary per-
sons who make public exhibitions of them-
selves by mobbing sardonic Muscovite strip-
lings are either unintelligent amateurs, mar-
velling at a technical proficiency far beyond
their limited capacity, or gushing highbrows
feigning enthusiasm in order to be in the
fashion. If their minds were really culti-
vated they would take some interest in
native literature, yet it is precisely this class
of people that is most desperately ignorant
of the prose and poetry of Australia. More
heart and brain go to the making of a Quinn
or Lawson lyric than to the sawing out of a
Wieniawski concerto, but a Hairyvitcii
will get as much out of the Big City public
at six concerts as Lawson or Quinn in six
years The people of the bush are the real
patrons of Australian literature; if our
poets and story-writers had to depend upon
Sydney and Melbourne for buyers of their
books they would starve. Sydney’s real
attitude to music is expressed, not in its
quarterly fits of hysteria about well-adver-
tised importations, but in its frigid apathy
regarding the fate of the State Orchestra.
For months past enthusiasts have been hunt-
ing among its 900,000 people for individuals
willing to plank down a pound or more
(getting the equivalent in concert tickets)
to save that fine body of musicians from
extinction, the Government having decided
to cut off supplies. After the quest had
lasted many weeks, the number of subscribers
stood at 636 and the total amount promised
at £3012. There are country towns that
have put up as much as that to enable a
local band to take part in a distant compe-
tition. , . »
To some extent the two Big Cities of the
Commonwealth are nurseries of talent. But
of neither can it be said that it is to. the
Australians what London is to the British
and Paris to the French. Neither gives the
nation expression nor leadership; neither
is the custodian of its soul. Each is the
home of a certain hard and bitter local
patriotism, of a ruinous over-centralisation,
and of a demented Direct Actionism which
periodically convulses the country with
strikes. Absorbed in their own petty con-
cerns, they take no interest in the, larger
problems of the continent. They are both
capable of lending a hand in the development
of the inadequately-financed frontier States
which have been second homes to so many of
their sons —they are certainly rich enough—
but who ever hears now of Melbourne do ng
anything for Westralia, or Sydney for
Queensland? Perhaps the greatest benefit that
could be conferred upon the Commonwealth
would be a really national city. The huge
aggregations of provincialism that cluster
about Port Jackson and Port Phillip are not
national cities, but national disasters.
RAILWAYS AS AN AID TO
UNSETTLEMENT.
A pronouncement made the other day by
James Fraser, Chief Railway Commissioner
of N. S. Wales, shows that official patience
has its limits. Translated out of depart-
mental language into the vulgar, the high
expert says that under present conditions
the blighted mockery, blithering hypocrisy and
poisonous sham of building railways to “open
up the country” and "promote settlement,
and all the rest of the familiar Parliamentary
and election tosh, would be better dead, ihe
present conditions referred to include the
regulation of something the size of an empire
from one city (not merely the regulation of
its laws, which is easy enough, but of by-
laws, public and private finance, railways,
wharves, rivers, forests, schools, harbors,
lands, land settlement, roads, waterworks,
some of its quarries, meat-shops, fish-shops,
abattoirs and sundries), the said manage-
ment being in the city interest and by city
men. The legislators possibly think they
have some idea of real decentralisation, which
is the abdication of much of their treasured
authority; but they are what they are and
can be nothing else. “Present conditions
also include lack of growing industrial towns
scattered over the State to provide traffic —
towns which the concentration policy makes
impossible—and lack of available seaports
with lines to them from the hinterland to
cut out much of the absurd and costly dis-
tances.
* • * •
Mr. Fraser’s case is that there is little
use in building hundreds and hundreds of
miles of costly new country lines if they
add neither to the passenger traffic, goods
traffic, revenue, settlefnent nor anything else
that is desirable. In other words, there is
little reason in them if they are only an
excuse for big loans, so that Ministries and
parties may buy office and votes and popu-
larity. On this matter some of the evidence
before the Court is as follows: —
In the course of six years to June, 1020, the
Ma State spent £18,000,000 on 1500 miles of new
railway, raising the capital cost of the system from
£01,000,000 to £70.000,000.
The mileage was thus increased by over 30 per
cent. But the tonnage of goods carried—the results
of the great increase in settlement which all this
costly railway expenditure is supposed to create —
only grew by one-third of one per cent. In other
words, the expenditure was 92, and the result's were
1 (one) - . , „
The number of passenger journeys taken in all
N.S.W. outside thj; Big City grew from 8,890,612
in 1914 to 10,342,069 in 1920 (increase, 1,446,057).
The number in the Big City area grew from
77,431,809 to 104,311,991 (increase, 26,880,182).
Practically all the increase of railway facilities was
in the country, but there weren’t the new people
to use the facilities. And these country lines which
bring neither production, revenue nor settlement are
a huge direct tax on the community. Of the loss
of £725,944 made in 1920 on 50 non-paying lines
£121,164 was on 10 lines only about two years of
age —the later developments of the loan-settlement
craze.
On the evidence of the official statistics the mak-
ing of railways in the country and the drift of
population to the One Big City go together. In
1910, when the Labor Government began to reign,
N. S. Wales had 3643 miles of railway and 111,172
people in the farming and dairy business (30 per
mile). In 1919, where the figures stop at present,
it had 4825 miles of line and 92,602 farming and
dairy people (19 per mile). It is customary to
lay the blame on the departure of men for the
war. But the war didn’t shorten the supply of men
to build railways with loan money; it didn’t Rhorten
the supply of pastoral worker’s, who showed a solid
increase; and it didn’t account for the fact that
female workers in the agricultural and cow business
diminished heavily.

and promises to be a sea with the large,
breezy sea outlook, it can’t be other than it
is. 'So it is no use speaking to the HOL-
MANS and Dooleys about these things and
listening to their protestations of better
times to come. And it is little good replac-
ing them with other men unless the condi-
tions are changed. N. S. Wales may be
paltry in size as the great States of Aus-
tralia go, but it is equal to the American
States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connec-
ticut, New York, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, North Carolina and half of
South Carolina —144 historic States all in
one. The Holman who is o.ualified to man-
age and develop 144 States at once, and also
manage their railways, which the political
rulers of the 144 States abovementioned
don’t undertake, is as rare as a Napoleon.
The Dooley who is fit for the work doesn’t
hang on every bush either. And even if
John Storey’s salary was raised from the
present absurd £2445 to £204,000 4s. sd.
per annum he would be no more capable than
he is now and would have no wider outlook.
So, until the whole scheme of things is
altered, the Ma State had better leave off
using costly loans to build “developmental
railways to “promote settlement” and “open
up the country,” seeing that they achieve
neither of these blessings. But while some-
thing substantial would be gained by merely
leaving off railway building, not enough
would be gained. Settlement is desirable:
our population is absurdly and dangerous! v
small, and there are districts which could
support as manv thousands as they now
carry units. Therefore the thing that is
above all other things necessary is to chamre
present conditions. Those changed by the
creation of new States and new capitals, rail-
ways will be found capable of really doing
what now they actually retard in spite of all
the pretensions of the vote-chasing poli-
ticians. -
IS IT UNCLE SAM’S TURN?
That uncanny seer, L. J. Maxse, of the
National Review, who foresaw the salient
features of the Great War 10 or 20 years
before it happened, and urged every sort ot
preparation, is at it again, and has been
asking why the United States should aim
onenlv at an overwhelming navy. (An over-
whelming army, by the way, can be imp
Used at short notice if the navy is provided
in advance, as Britain lately showed.) The


navy that is proposed seems likely to fye not
only equal to any two others, but to any
three or even four others so far as new
ships are concerned, and by the time the
new ships are ready the old ones will have
practically ceased to count. At a very recent
date the U.S. Naval Department published
its own shipbuilding programme, and the
authorised programmes of two other big
Powers: and it isn't likely that it minimised
the other two so as to diminish the excuse
for its own. These were the figures:—
Three Naval Programmes.
United
Battleships, the Levia- States. Britain. Japan.
tbans that count . . 11 None 3
Tonnage of same . . 421,900 None 112,050

Tota ! ships .. . . 108 36 41
Total tonnage .. . . 840,100 76,710 349,060
There isn’t even a battle cruiser among the
small deer of the British programme, while
the U.S. has six (261,000 tons) among its
minor craft, and Japan four (160,000 tons).
These minor monsters would have been real
battleships before the war. The United
States departmental programme may be
varied by Congress, but the 10 battleships
and six battle cruisers lately under construc-
tion are certainties. As for the British
fleet it is already growing old, and the
exhausted country has let the trident go
without an effort; while, as for naval pro-
grammes apart from these three—U.S.A.,
Japanese and British —it may be said that
they don’t exist. Everybody is worn and
weary save the two big nations which made
big profits out of the war.
Why these gigantic American prepara-
tions? The United States isn’t forced to
keep the sea routes open lest it should
starve as Britain has been long compelled
to do. If Uncle Sam’s sea commerce was
interrupted those who foolishly interrupted
it would be more likely to go short them-
selves for want of U.S. cotton. His is the
most self-contained and self-supporting coun-
try in the world except China. The few
detached colonies which require defence, such
ns the Philippines, the Canal Zone and
Hawaii, don’t call for this stupendous
defence. The Japanese menace, on the
figures, doesn’t call for more than half of
it
It may be that the bloated sea armament
is merely an expression of national vanity.
Or the U.S. may build battleships to pro-
vide work for the unemployed as Australia
builds non-payable railways. If it isn’t
these, then it may be oil. The United States
has, in that case, come to the conclusion that
the big nation which has used up its own oil in
a magnificent razzle and can’t lay its hands
on other people’s will be a back number. The
United States has long been the oil centre
of the world. But vast as its output is the
demand has got ahead of it since the brick-
layer took to going forth in his own private
car to lay bricks, and the plumber to plumb
Meanwhile other deposits have been found
and Britain has secured so many of them
(widely scattered and difficult of defence)
that it has become a rival kerosene potentate
?/ ® potential one. It no longer really cares
it the U.S. stops exports and refuses to sell
oil to the world. But the U.S. is coming
to a point (has nearly come to it) when it
will matter if it can’t compel other countries
to supply it or can’t annex their wells and
supply itself. So far from continuing to
advance by a process of geometrical progres-
sion, the Republic, unless it is prepared to
take up a strong aggressive attitude, may
to sprag the wheels of material advance-
ment considerably, and no country is con-
tent to do that unless all the world sprags
at the same time.
It is not necessary to assume that the
U.S.A. even thinks of war. Least of all
war between “the two great branches of the
Anglo-Saxon race.” It is a pleasant cus-
tom to say that that is “unthinkable.” When
there is no remedy, as in the present case,
one gains nothing by saying anything else,
save that he avoids insulting his own intelli-
gence. War with anybody is, unhappily, think-
able enough. It isn’t, of course, likely that
the nation as a whole would go to war with-
out just and sufficient cause and provoca-
tion; but it is the stronger party, or the
party which thinks itself the stronger, that
decides what is j'ust and sufficient provoea-
tion. It may be oil, just as in the case of
Briton v. Boer in South Africa it was first
diamonds and then gold. A good cause and
one wholly commendable to God was found
when Texas was required in order to prevent
the extension of the Slave States being
stopped short at the Arkansas border The
formal annexation of California in 3848 was
divinely appointed, seeing that gold was
found there in 3547.
There isn’t much in the theory that Repub-
lics are less aggressive than monarchies sim-
ply because they are Republics. The Roman
Republic acquired territory heroically; and
the United States has done pretty much the
me ‘ l n , bright lexicon of acquisition
there has been no such word as “fail.” If it
wants the command of the Seven Seas and
the shores thereof it may plead that its
turn is due.

Closing Up.
Closing up is still in progress. The Federal
Government has announced further restric-
tions on the export of coal from NS W the
only exporting State. The output has be-
t f £“V° f pasi ?°f c , thr ough sectional strikes
Jn at e° Ca v. C famines are increasingly fre-
rr t Vi Wheref ° re the Government alms to
saie the precarious supply for local mir-
poses. Kalgoorlie, the only great goldfield
Australia has left, though it is sadly fallen
from its high estate, sees trouble ahead A
new award came into force at the begin-
nmg of the year, with the result that the
working of the poorer ores must be aban-
doned, and when the price of gold drops to
normal much of the medium ore will also
become unworkable unless conditions are
modified. Broken Hill, which never revived
after the great closing up for high pav and
a 30-hour week, remains dead. Mount Mor
gan continues closed, although the em
ployees look like taking matters out of the
hands of the union bosses, who have hitherto
dragooned them into idleness. The great
Government meatworks at Wyndham (W A')
which were closed because, under union
rules, a point had been reached at which
it cost more to kill a bullock than the ani-
mal was worth, remain dead because the
conditions haven’t improved, nor the unions
eitner. Ihe town and port are in process of
abandonment like the works. The only local
vessel that goes that way regularly is the
W .A., Government steamer Bambra, and it
wasn t received with applause on a recent
vmit. Instead, the local Robinson Crusoes
held it up for such a remarkable rise of wages
..at it left with most of its cargo unde-
livered. At the other great Northern port,
Darwin, where the A.W.U. runs the
industrial show, the meatworks are shut, and
ft recent accounts two-thirds of the dimin-
ished population were not working. In a
report the Administrator said :
The community is tyrannised and terrorised by a
camarilla of unscrupulous and disaffected persons
to whom no concessions should be made until the
peaceful inhabitants of Darwin are permitted to
live under normal civilised conditions.
There is a little extra trouble in the shipping
business, and it is complained that under
the new law even river hoats of 31 tons
must carry, a library. Public works show
signs of closing—in N. S. Wales—because the
rr°^ n^ nt which w a g blessed with
£O,4UO,IHX) more revenue than that of 1920
and £11,000,000 more than that of 1919, has
also got through £15,500,000 of loan money
and liasn t a bean in its possession. The
amount of meat, other food and groceries
which cost 20s. in July, 1914, rose to 38s. 3d.
at June, 1920, but is now down to 325. 3d.
and still falling. Other things, such as
copper, silver, leud, tin and wool, have fallen
also. But the bosses who issue orders to
enslaved Labor have laid it down that the
wagers paid for producing these cheapening
things must remain at the top level of June,
, ’-0, or rise higher. While these eloquent
out non-productive persons retain that view,
and while their followers think to order,
* n P l '^ oB n) akes the fight between
I.W.VY. dogma and the arithmetic book more
intense, and more industries must close. In
particular, the great wheat-growing business
must close. For years past thousands of
tanners have been on the bread-line; and if
the prices they can get for products fall
while the prices they have to pay for rail
and sea freight, lumping, and all their farm
and personal requirements are maintained,
then they will simply have to throw up their
rural job and move into a city to make the
national troubles worse. In the first days
of the war The Bulletin met the panic cry
of ‘ Spend, spend, spend !” with the counter-
cry of “Produce, produce, produce!” In-
creased production was important then; in
view of our tremendously increased debt it
is vastly more important now. And those
who attempt to impose or maintain condi-
tions which make production impossible are
making widespread hunger and misery inevit-
able.
U nemployment.
Though the N. S. Wales Government has
been inventing loan jobs for as many men as
it can scrape together wages for and has left
the bill to posterity, there are still 7500 un-
employed (and their families) in Sydney
and suburbs alone. In the search for reasons
these things come to light-
During the 10 months to the end of April N. S.
Wales imported £63,104,817 worth of goods, or at
the rate of nearly £76,000,000 a year, or about
£3B per head per annum, or £l9O (nearly £3 13s.
per week) for every family of five. There was
nothing like this heroic spending of money on
foreign goods in the Ma State’s record before and
very little resembling it in the world’s record.
Most of these imports were goods which could
be produced here.
As the exports don’t pay for the imports and for
the interest due in London by nearly £30,000,000
a year, the country is stripped bare of money ’and
goes further into debt to pay for them. It pays
735. per family per week for being out of work.
It is stripped a second time by new taxes to pension
and otherwise provide for the Government’s sup-
porters. It is stripped a third time for subscrip-
tions to loans to provide jobs for the people who
should be profitably employed making the goods
that are now imported.
Less and less money is left in the country to start
new industries with; for the swag of £lOOO notes in
the banks ( £22,000,000 of them) are not money.
And the Government starts no industries itself
except temporary and unproductive loan jobs.
And the panjandrums of Labor devote themselves
to stopping business with strikes and hold-ups and
threats and prognostications of “taking over” every-
thing. J
And they and the Government and Judge Beeby’s
Court spend their time devising new ways of making
production less and the cost of it more.
Nowhere in the world is more high-priced
employment sta. ing a small community in
the face. Yet part of the community has
taken to sleeping in the Domain. It is a
common saying that Australia is unique in
the extent to which the Government looks
after the people, makes itself responsible
for the people, and “enters into the lives of
the people.” Therefore nowhere is a Gov-
ernment more at fault when things go so
very far wrong with the people.
The Courts as Aids to Blackmail.
Justice Pring, senior Puisne Judge of
N 8. YY ales, heard a case the other dav in
which a former employee sued Hugh D.
Mclntosh for commission on certain sales’
°“ the pretext of testing the credibility
or the defendant, plaintiff’s counsel devoted
the greater part of his cross-examination of
that witness to his relations with various
women—-whether he had misconducted him-
self with them, whether he had bought them
motor-cars, what he had paid for jewellerv
he had given them, the details of excursions
he had made, and a hundred other things
ha\ ing no more relation to the alleged agree-
ments regarding the commission than the
color of the defendant’s socks or the cut
of the Judge’s coat. Naturally enough
counsel for the defendant protested against
the nature of the cross-examination ; where-
upon his Honor said that counsel was quite
within his rights—that if people came into
a court they must be prepared to have their
lives ripped open.” This paper has a pro-
found respect for Justice Pring, and an
ever-growing regard for his services to the
A. 8. YY ales bench; but in this maUer it
that his Honor has lined himself up
with the blackguards and the blackmailers
of. the community, and there is no man in
this country to whom the company will be
more uncongenial. In this particular case
Mclntosh did not go to the court volun-
tarily : he was dragged there by a man who
made a claim which the jury very promptly
threw out. If his Honor’s view is correct,
then because Mclntosh did not pay some
thousands of pounds to one who, the jury
decides, had no right to the money, he must
expect to have his life “ripped open”; in
other words, the courts will only help men
to resist unjust demands, or will only help
them to enforce just ones, if they are pre-
pared to have their past “ripped open” and
a vast amount of probably unjustified innu-
endo thrown at them. If such a practice is
established, then nothing is surer than that
the courts, instead of being a terror to the
unjust and a refuge for the oppressed and
the wronged, will be the sheet-anchor of the
blackmailer. The rogue will not only extort
money from a person who might be made the
defendant in a case of some sort, but he
will refuse to pay his just debts to men who
are suspected of willingness to lose their
money rather than suffer the ripping-open
process. If the cause of justice were ad-
vanced one step by the method endorsed by
Justice Pbing, we might perhaps be willing
to put up with the frequent wrong of it.
But how much nearer the truth about com-
mission on certain sales of shares do we get
for knowing whether Hugh D. Mclntosh
is generous to ladies or not? In another
court, before another N. S. Wales Supreme
Court Judge, a tremendous fight was going
on simultaneously against a man whose vows
of celibacy were under no cloud. But what
bearing did that have upon the contention in
that case? Or is it seriously suggested that
the man who breaks one of the Ten Com-
mandments is not to be trusted to keep any
of them —that the thief is also not to be
trusted not to be a murderer? This at any
rate seems to be one implication. Another,
of course, is that the most trustworthy wit-
nesses in the world are the male attendants
in a Turkish harem; and it is doubtful
whether any possible implication could be
more absurd than that.
Why the Sydney Road Loan Failed.
From the Land that Mutch forgot:—
It is raining on the Dorrigo. It has been doing
the same thing off and on—mostly on—since January
I. I have known the day to break with a frost
and close with a thunderstorm of tropical violence.
Signs are not wanting that fungus is forming in the
atmosphere. The weather would, nevertheless, be
more a blessing than a drawback if the Government
hadn’t decided to forget that the Dorrigo exists. As
it is the inhabitants are dependent solely upon one
road for their supplies, and that road serpentines down
a precipitous and dangerous mountain, liable to have
its centre of gravity disturbed at any moment.
A flood in April deposited a considerable part of
our main artery in the Pacific. The people decided
to wire to Tom Mutch, Minister for Local Govern-
ment, about it. That gentleman was not interested,
so they wired again. Mr. Mutch replied by letter
that he would think it over. Meanwhile Dorrigo was
isolated; its stocks of butter and bacon were accumu-
lating and deteriorating, while its supplies of other
commodities were running short. With bovine
patience Dorrigonians waited two weeks. They then
again wired to ascertain the result of Mr. Mutch’s
meditations. There was no result. The position be-
came desperate—for us, not for Mr. Mutch. Some-
thing had to be done, so more wires were sent. The
Department at Sydney was subjected to drum-fire;
“urgents” were sent every day; the local Progress
Association even prepaid replies. But nothing could dis-
turb the equanimity of Mutch. He simply intimated
that he hadn’t ceased to consider the matter. Six
weeks passed before the Shire received notice that
£lOOO had been granted to restore the roads—six
weeks after the damage had occurred. The delay cost
the district thousands. Incidentally, it gave Dorri-
gonians another taste of what it feels like to be
hamstrung by Sydney. And all the time the medi-
tative Mutch was appealing for loans to make nice
motor-tracks about the Big City.
The Dorrigo’s one trade artery is worse than an
abandoned goat-track through the Himalayas. To
travel it at the best of times is to fly in the face
of Providence; at the worst, to court mutilation
and death. Tet to us, whom the Government has
“settled on the land,” not to travel it spells
economic destruction and starvation. On a dozen
occasions it has been impassable, wherefore men have
been thrown out of employment and factories rendered
idle. The last relapse cost 100 men their jobs.
This road is really only the expression of that
paralysing policy which Sydney has always adopted
towards the country. Our atrocious roads, unde-
veloped land, untapped resources, wasting water-power,
stagnant or declining population; our comfortless
surroundings and homes, bare often of elementary
conveniences, are melancholy monuments to the un-
utterable failure of Sydney government, to the blight-
ing results of the centralisation madness. Many of
the pioneers whom the Sydney Government allured
to this isolated wilderness of scrub by lavish promises
of a railway and good roads now rest under the
sod, some broken in the hopeless struggle, worn out
before their time. But the railway isn’t here and
there isn’t a decent road this side of Parramatta.
And yet, if Sydney had given us but half a square
deal, the Dorrigo would before this have proved itself
one of the Ma State’s richest assets.
Dorrigo and the rest of the north will not sub-
scrioe to road loans for the betterment of Svdnev
They would, if they could, hang that part of Svdnev
which stands for centralisation, and which has mur-
dered the country—hang it to the topmost limb of
the tallest pine on the plateau, where the vultures
that hover over the untilled spares which bear wit-
ness to its cynical, criminal folly could pick its
bones. Damn Sydney! She has damned us, and we
want no more of her or the legislative and admin-
istrative rottenness for which she stands.
Doctors’ Ethics.
There has seldom been a better instance of
one mans meat proving another’s poison
than the agitation in Sydney to get Dr G
S. Thompson kicked out of the B.M.A Dr
Thompson backed Mrs. Farr, the M.L Pro-
fessors wife who, after being declared mad
in Sydney, recently was adjudged sane in
her own country. Opinions differ as to the
Pu OW T S. lve °Persons in authority under
the A. S. Males Lunacy Act. Many like
Dr. Thompson consider them too vast to
be consistent with British ideas regarding
the freedom of the subject. Others argue
that the safety of the subject is even more
important than the subject’s liberty, and point
to the free cretins and halfwits in our midst
potential homicides in many cases—in
proof of the contention that the Act does not
go far enough. The question is a matter of
sociological taste. But no one could fairly
claim that Dr. Thompson did not believe
in the desperate light he put up for a cause
which was, in effect, lost before the first
it had been fired. He was the per-
Bonification throughout the proceedings of
the fanatically convinced forlorn-hope fighter,
who is always hated and despised of his own
class and generation, but who, after all, is
the only sort that ever gets big reforms
through. In the course of the struggle he
advanced three arguments why the Act should
be amended, namely :—•
(1) At the instance of a private doctor it was pos-
sible for a person to be arrested and spirited away.
(**) Sane persons could be incarcerated in asylums
Someone had only to lay an information and eet
a medical certificate. Any doctor could give a
medical certificate of insanity. He was not such
a fool as to think that there were no doctors capable
of being bribed and bought.
(1>) Coroners findings and Royal Commissions
prove that an official visit is a farce. The public
has no control over official visitors. Some visitors
are doctors. We want a non-medical board of control.
The Medical Journal of Australia (which
is the official organ of the 8.M.A.) opened
with a leading article citing the above alle-
gations and urging disciplinary action.
Then the N. S. Wales Medical Ethics Com-
mittee wrote to Thompson as follows:
The committee was of opinion that the statements
are in derogation of the honor of the medical pro-
fession and defamatory of the profession as
holding it up to public contempt and hatred •
and the committee would be glad to havb a
reply giving a definite denial of the statements re-
ferred to.
As Thompson is not in a position to give a
detailed denial, but on the contrary repeats
lhat every word he said was true, his position
bp , regarded as perilous. Yet in August,
HU!), the same Medical Journal, which has
drawn attention to Thompson’s alleged "in-
famous criticisms,” printed a two-column
letter from a famous doctor on “The Nation-
alisation of Medicine” in which the follow-
ing occurs:—
(1) The very profession [Medicine] which ought
to be urging forward the new era apparently stands
in dread of it, and seems to prefer to reap its harvest
from, disease.
(■j) Health is served....by a make-believe “volun-
tary hospital system Let us cease to boast about
the free service we give to hospitals. Who would
deny that those hospital appointments are eagerly
sought for and are to the fortunate holder a most
valuable financial asset, if only as advertisement f
I have often wondered what would be the actual cash
profit to the hospitals if these appointments were
auctioned on their behalf. There would be a pretty
undignified scramble, anyhow.
(3) Many [doctors] have neither time nor leisure
to read even this journal, and are degenerating from
scientists to pedlars.
.. A competition rthat of the private practi-
tloner] which calls often for smart cars, rapid action
and bedside manner rather than careful scientific
efficiency... .Can there be any greater feeling of
subserviency than that which wells up in some minds
when a malade imaginaire sstys : “And the fee
doctor
The implications of Dr. Thompson’s charges
against the profession, made in the heat of
controversy . and in defence of a woman
whom he believed to be suffering an injustice,
are that certain medical men may be dis-
honest. In other words, that this profession,
like every other, has its wrong ’uns—which
is a platitude. The implications of his
fellow-practitioner’s letter, written in cold
blood for the information of the public, are
that many doctors are self-advertising hum-
bugs ; that others are on the make at all
costs; and that some are mere “pedlars.”
And the eminent specialist who gave the
weight of his name to that damning indict-
ment not merely suffers no reproof, but actu-
ally has his views printed in the B.M.A.
organ, while the suburban g.p. is at least m
grave danger of being cast into outer dark-
ness so far as the B.M.A. is concerned.

The Labor Congress anti White
Australia.
Titus Bob Ross, leader of the “intellectual
Socialists” :—•
“A Man Who Has Followed It” (B. 30/6/’2l) must
have followed it as one blind and deaf or he would
have been dumb. The All-Australian Congress, so far
from being a Congress of Cranks, was the most sen-
sible and statesmanlike gathering of importance that
Australia has seen for years. I was there and know.
Eminently sane, and clothed in their right mind, the
delegates did just the opposite to what “A Man”
alleges. “Non-Australian extremists” did not force
a programme upon the majority. Australian-born
trade unionists were easily in the majority, and their
outlook on things was in the ascendant. I say this
without disparagement to others. The “wildly im-
practicable policy” of socialisation and internation-
alism adopted will, when the critics (The Bulletin
included) wake up to the pregnant fact, be found
to be the one possible alternative to what the critics
fear. For, if it be agreed that Things As They Are
cannot continue, it follows that they must be altered
by either (a) social reconstruction along the lines
of the determinations of Congress, or (b) beastly
and bloody violence. I stand to this judgment as
in the last analysis incontestable. In its decisions
Congress is really saving its country and its move-
ment from the acceptance of worse, and any man con-
cerned for real citizenship and real progress may
see it, if he takes the trouble to drop a method of
attack that belongs to the days before the war and
no longer fits the situation. A Congress that applied
itself with thought and earnestness to the reconstruc- '
tive task of our times and went out to find a way
of escape from “the coming war” in the Pacific,
and also to devise a constitutional, peaceful and
constructive policy of economic change, deserves better
than to be treated as “A Man” and The Bulletin
editorially have done. Neither has yet “got wise”
to the real conflict within the ranks of Labor. Not
a split such as “A Man” hints at, but a split of an-
other sort is the likelier, though actually one of
the achievements of Congress was to make the way-
clear for the uniting of all sections of progressive
working-class thought on a common ground of action
for the socialisation of industry. Given a chance in
The Bulletin I would undertake to present a case
for the Congress plan that could, I believe, only be
met with the contention that Australia and the work-
ers are to forever remain catspaws of Capitalism. If
Congress “surrendered iteslf to the extremists” it
was because the old thought has stampeded and left
the new in possession. Men of the type “A Man”
derides constitute Australia’s one chance to reach a
bloodless haven of peace and prosperity-.
As a reader of The Bulletin since youth it hurts to
find it as neglectful of Australia’s thought in economic
reconstruction as it is protective and preservative of
Australia’s thought in literature, art and commerce.

at a Labor conference as at the one your contributor
accuses of rarely mentioning this great Common-
wealth.
Congress desires to build on industrialised founda-
tions of truth, beauty and utility.
And The Bulletin desires Australia to
remain self-reliant and while. Wherefore, it
asks: —
(a) Do the new internationalist Laborites believe
in the White Australia policy?
(b) If so, how do they propose to defend it should

Disease, Spectacular and Otherwise.
“Gregor”: During the past 10 years medical
science has concluded that leprosy is not
easily transmitted. Some hold that it is
not contagious or infectious in the ordinary
sense, or hereditarily handed down. Were
it not that an organisin' (the bacillus leprae,
discovered by 11 AN SEN, the Scandinavian
microbiologist) has been isolated which is
uettevea to uo one of the causatory influences
of leprosy, the disease would probably be
classified with cancer —a complaint which
spontaneously originates on account of some
mysterious deficiency or break-down in the
systematic metabolism. For the rest, the
"carrier” of leprosy has never been found
(though the common bed-bug is susplTct), the
manner in which it makes its entry into the
victim’s body is unknown, and there is no
sound hypotheses as to how the leprosy, toxin
carries out its work. The prisoners in the
different lazarettos in the Commonwealth
may be said to be victims of a misunder-
standing, since much of the dread of lejvosy
is a heritage from the Middle Ages, which in
turn derived their fear of it from the Biblical
descriptions, now known not to he descrip-
tions of leprosy at all. I have an acute
recollection of seeing, in my student-days at
a Sydney hospital, the father of a family of
three cail at the dermatological out-patients'
department for treatment for a persistent
sore on his leg. Amid great excitement it
was diagnosed as tubercular leprosy, and the
unfortunate was hurried away to Long Bay,
where he remained until he died, some years
later. Yet that man lived with his wife and
family for a year after he developed the first
symptom, and up to the present the disease
has not made its appearance among them.
In Asiatic countries, such as China, where a
rigorous segregation of lepers is not in force,
the disease must have become epidemic were
it as contagious as lay belief, and some medi-
cal belief, holds it to be. Compared with
syphilis or tuberculosis, it does not repre-
sent a one-thousandth part of the menace to
the community that these diseases do, yet no
attempt is made at segregating those who
suffer from them. History and experience
combined have shown that leprosy has never
vet threatened to wipe out a community, nor
has it even seriously threatened the health
of one. On the other hand, .syphilis and
consumption can exterminate a whole race.
Evidences of this can he found in some of
the Pacific Islands. Further, in only one
case in about 10 or more —again contrary
to general belief—does leprosy become really
horrible in its outward effects, and frequently
a leper may go through life exhibiting no
more signs of the complaint than a couple of
sores and an erythematous patch here and
there on his body. The medical officer in
charge of the leper settlement at Molokai, in
the Hawaiian Islands, some years ago assured
me that 19 out of every 20. of his charges
could live under ordinary conditions without
attracting the slightest suspicion that they
were lepers. But syphilis, if permitted to
run its course unchecked, speedily produces
fearful results, probably the identical ones
ascribed by the Bible to leprosy. Even now,
in spite of the employment of salvfersan,
arseno-henzol and the rest of the organic
compounds of arsenic and mercury, it is ques-
tionable whether a case of syphilis has ever
been really cured, with no possibilitv. of a
relapse in 15 or 20 years. But, within the
past few months, patients treated with gyno-
eardia oil have been released, under surveil-
lance, from the lazarette on Peel Island, in
Morton Bay (Q,). Tuberculosis, for its
part, unless something is quickly done about
it, soon kills even the healthiest and
strongest. In the past a cruel injustice has
been done to lepers. Medical science is
■extremely doubtful as to the very nature of
the disease; it is not known definitely
whether it is communicable or not, and, if
it is, the means by which it is, are unknown.
No doubt exists as to the ease with which
syphilis and tuberculosis may be spread, ami
the damaging effects of these two on the
nation at large are too well known to need
emphasising. Yet, by reason of our heii-
tage of fear, cant and ignorance, we consign
the victims of the one to a life worse than
death, while we allow the victims of the
others to go on spreading them broadcast.
A Missed Opportunity.
It was bad business at a time when recruits
for the K.A.N. lower-deck are being diligently
sought and rarely found for the naval
authorities to adopt the attitude they did in
connection with the missing Canastota. And
it was worse business that they should have
given reasons. The stated objections to a
work of mercy which a navy is particularly
well equipped to undertake were (1) that
that sort of thing costs money, in coal, de-
preciation and so on, and (2) that it is not
a navy’s job. There is no more abhorrent
marine phenomenon than the ship which
passes another in distress —because it would
cost money to stop and pick up the derelict
crew, or because the latter are under a
foreign Hag, and therefore the concern,
strictly speaking, of their own nationals.
Naval vessels never do such things, which
is one of the reasons why naval men
are popular. The analogy between our
navy’s refusal to look for a derelict
and the . refusal of an undesirable class
of seafaring man to notice a dere-
lict when found is a good deal too
close to be pleasant. And it is
just the sort of thing that makes a
service disliked. Most navies sillier under
the handicap of being uninspiring institu-

tions in peace-time. Under the old regime
here the local squadron was not merely un-
inspiring: it was a joke. It plodded from
one race-meeting to the other with the assidu-
ity of a bookmaker; from this round of
social festivities to that like a match-mak-
ing mother with daughters to "get on.
The R.A.N. threatens already to develop
many of the habits which cost our pre-war
squadrons almost as much in prestige as
they provided in diversion for the officers.
But the lower-deck personnel of that period
was not Australian. It would not have
affected the British naval enlistment figures
one iota if our subsidised fleets had never
put to sea at all from the time they reached
these waters. The position of the R.A..N.
is that it has to justify itself both m the
eyes of the taxpayers and in the minds of
the youths who are its prospective recruits
by continuous work of a useful sort. It is
futile for the naval authorities .to claim that
the Service can’t afford the time off from
training or the money for the coal to go
searching for missing passenger-ships—as
though these craft made a habit of getting
lost. As futile, really, as though the P.
and O. Co. gave as a reason why one
of its ships hadn't picked up the survivors
of a wreck the fact that, having mails to
deliver in a specified time, it vvas the liner’s
duty to pass on. Little side-lines, of which
the occasional, very occasional, hunt for a
lost Vessel represents a good example, are
preciselv what the public expects of a peace-
time navy. They cast a beneficent atmo-
sphere over the fleet; support the common
view that the Jack Tar is a handy man;
and give the burdened character who has to
find the cash for the Naval Estimates a
feeling that he is getting some sort of pre-
sent return for his money. All of which
reacts favorably on the Xavy's good name,
and hence on its desirability as a career for
young men of spirit. A Canastota search-
party would probably have been almost as
valuable, regarded as a recruiting-stunt, as
an announcement that owing to the exigen-
cies of training the fleet would not be in
Port rhillip during next Melbourne Cup
week.
“Solomon Malaprop” on Self-Determina-
tion :
The 4th of July (Independence Day) was celebrated
all over republican Ireland, and Old Glory "as
hoisted everywhere by order of President de \ alkra
on the plea that the United States is an ideal land
of self-determination where people are ruled by
themselves, with their own consent, and no other
wav. The United States began with nine or ten
States, and Washixutos was getting along on his
first Presidential term before Rhode Island and North
Carolina came in under some pressure. Florida was
annexed just like Ireland, despite the protests of
its sparse Spanish population. Louisiana (then in-
cluding Missouri) was bought without the inhabi-
tants (Louisiana is still mostly French) having any
voice in the matter. California was “occupied” by
the U.S. Army. Alaska was bought, and the natives
heard of it afterwards. Hawaii and the Philippines
were conquered. It was all very orderly and ordi-
nary, but it wasn’t self-determination.
From the Hist day of the Union South Carolina
treated it as a terminable partnership. It finally
treated ihe compact as such in December, 1860, when
it sent in jts solitary resignation, believing that a
republic of 31,000 square miles (almost exactly the
same size as Ireland) was safe under the Rights ol
Man, etc. It got the surprise of its life.
The first seven States went out because they were
tired. Three of them—Texas, Florida (conquered)
and Louisiana (bought)—had had no voice in the
making of the Constitution. The other four seceded
because they were called on to furnish troops to
suppress the first seven when the war broke out.
After the war, in which the Irish soldiers in the
Northern Army played a manful part in putting
down the self-determination ideas of the South, the
North took a picturesque vengeance on the Cotton
States. The North definitely freed the slaves. It
admitted them to the (franchise without any educa-
tional preparation, while disfranchising whites whole-
sale for their attempt at self-determination. Few
peoples ever, paid a greater price.
The conquered States have made no further attempt
at self-determination as yet. They have just stayed
conquered.
Altogether the mixing up of the United States
with the Self-Dctermination-of-Nations business looks
rather a blunder. It might move Ballymahinch and
Bally castle to laughter if those places weren’t in such
dead earnest.

Wise, P.M.G., is hopelessly disconcerted by
an agitation in Melbourne against the
attempt to deny book-post rates to the vast
majority of books. If ‘‘when Parliament
agreed to an exceptionally cheap book-post
rate, the concession was not intended to
apply to all books indiscriminately, but only
to the works of bona fide Australian authors,
how comes it that the regulations disallow
the “concession” to all books containing
matter previously published, or to books of
purely Australian authorship which contain
an aclvt. from which the struggling Austra-
lian author had reaped a profit, or to books
containing newspaper criticisms of the author's
previous Australian work > Wise is unable to
think of even an unsatisfactory answer to
such questions. The best of school-books,
written and compiled by local scholars,
couldn’t be mailed at book-post rates under
the present insane regulations. The
•’concession” was no sooner granted to Aus-
tralian book-producers than regulations were
made to prevent Australian authors from
benefiting by it; and if Wise didn’t super-
vise those regulations, then it is up to him
to show cause for being where he js. Con-
fronted with a deputation of mad booksellers
he could only say : “My impression is that
unless some definition enn be urrived ut
which will make the position clear, and en-
sure uniformity without the risk of mis-
understanding, the book rate will have to be
abolished altogether." So much for Wise’s
solicitude for Australian native authorship .
In Westralia the Commonwealth and State
Taxation Departments have formally amal-
gamated. The immediate result was the
reduction of the combined staffs by nearly
one-third. But most of the States are as
reluctant to come to a sensible arrangement
of that sort as they arc to abandon their
private Governors and the latter’s mock
courts; their two Houses and all the rest of
the paraphernalia of a European kingdom.
In the same way as a State cannot be made
by any outside influence to abandon its im-
ported Governor, so it cannot be made to
cut a piece out of itself to oblige the Mal-
content population of the area. But it
might be persuaded to do something equiva-
lent to that if its groaning taxpayers could
only be shown that there was immediate
financial relief to be got from the step. The
direct gain to be had by the creators from
the manufacture of a new State on tin* old
model is problematical. But anyone can see
the millions of pounds sterling that must, be
saved by the sweeping away of the existing
unnatural arrangement which has resulted
already in one Australian out of every If*
living either on the Federation or on a
State.
The olive-oil industry of South Aus. is
among the many that are passing through
a difficult time. In a normal winter the oil-
makers advertise that they want fruit, but
for weeks past there has been only .one such
advertisement. The reason for this is that
most of the oil-mills are closed because of
the enormous quantity of imported oil on
the market. When the franc and the lira
were 2.").22* to the £ sterling the duty was
adequate; but now the franc is about 40 to
the £, and the tremendous drop in exchange
has led to unprecedented dumping. Aus-
tralian olive oil is better than the imported
article, and commands a slightly higher
price, but the difference doesn’t nearly
counterbalance the fall in currency of Italy
and France. Nothing but a duty of 2s. per
gallon will save the smaller producers, at
any rate. Some of the larger oil-mills with
established brands might survive the com-
petition without this protection ; but that is
not going to be the best thing for the general
community. Its interests lie in the develop-
ment of the business and the multiplication
of mills. Both the small grower and the
consumer will have a better chance that
way. It is distinctly a case, in short,
where a fairly high duty is the best guar-
antee of reasonably low prices for the manu-
factured goods.

A dim memory of Max Pemberton’s “Iron
Pirate” may have prompted the belief that
several vessels posted missing in the North
Atlantic have been sunk by a scientific
buccaneer. Pemberton’s pirate, one re-
calls, worked the same beat; his lair
was a harbor in the region of ice and snow.
But his commerce-raider was a compara-
tively slow coal-driven cruiser, and, mainly
for that reason, he was never convincing.
Brought up to date and transferred to a sub-
mersible, he would look more like the part.
There is nothing inherently improbable in
the idea of a society of irreconcilable Ger-
mans having a pirate submarine shipped out
in parts to a secret rendezvous, and there
put together and manned by a crew of tin-
fishermen trained in the war. But the East
Indies would offer better hiding-places, and
Australian waters a less hazardous field of
operations, than the North Atlantic. And
if piracy were not the object, there would
be numerous opportunities for smuggling, a
pastime for which the commercial sub-
marine, like the cargo-carrying aeroplane, is
admirably adapted. Considering the un-
settled financial barometer and the almost-
universal maintenance of war restrictions,
the present is hardly the time for the forma-
tion of efficient piratical and smuggling
organisations. The picturesque American
story may, therefore —however reluctantly—
be discredited. But the time is coming
when no Customs Department will be com-
plete without submersible pirate-catchers and
seaplane coastguards—or. in the case of land-
locked countries, aerial border patrols.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Gallery after the Reps, had gone
through the Tariff :
Long study of the Reps, during the Tariff debate
convinces me that we want an improved breed of
politicians. The most outstanding defect is the
lack of a continental vision. Nearly every man is
a btate-1' rightcr, ready to yell for a prohibitive dutv
to foster tlie meagrest business in his own back yard,
and equally vociferous for a revenue duty or plain
Kreetrade for some other industry in another State.
Take, for example, the Queensland Nationalist squad
that split the welkin in its efforts to get a towering
impost on foreign timber and Fiji bananas, and
the other night led the Freetrade attack on the Vic-
torian manufacture of granulated cork, liven worse
than those were the political neophytes whom Labor-
ite Makin has damned with the biting epithet of
“the Foreign-Country Party.” Day and night they
were a combined gramophone, reeling off Alters
records on the brutality of Protection, but they gave
the hated faith three loud cheers when Japanese
onions came before the committee. And what can
be said of Charlton and Watkins? All through they
had worked hard for the Australian manufacturer,
but when it came to supporting the local explosives
industry their Protectionist tongues faltered and
iheir spines oozed away. There was no question—
at any rate, no proof—that the Australian article
was inferior to the imported, hut the peaceful
unionists of Newcastle had promised to down tools
if i he local explosive was “forced upon them,”
whereat Charlton and Watkins, pretending that thev
were driven by the threat of an industrial upheaval,
crossed the floor for the first time with the Free-
trade gang. No wonder Fenton grew wild at this
ehavior. Much of the Australian explosive is pro-
duced in his constituency!

admitted to Sydney Council committee meet-
ings, where details of bright schemes for the
for und eveloped eoal-
ioles and £-.0,000 for pubs returning a net
income of £62 a year are disclosed. When
the blinds were raised, according to A. G
Kaiston, K.C., who was an alderman at the
tune, there had been repeated charges of
bribery, corruption and wholesale graft in
regard to contracts, and the ratepayers had
been thoroughly aroused.” But the Council
is now run by a Labor Caucus, some of
whose gorgeous proposals have been ruined
by premature publicity, so last week the
b inds were pulled down again, which means
that in future there will be no publication of
details and no discussion. Sydney now has
the Tammany system of municipal govern-
ment in all its glory. The one thing lack-
ing is a Boss Tweed.

chaos, the slump of 50 millions a month in

thousand million dollars, the Greek-Turk
complications and some odds and ends. In-
cidentally it is proposed that the money, or
part of it, should bo spent on railways,
although Queensland already has 7.67 miles

elderly and whiskered Foster,
M.11.R. tor Wakefield (S.A.), is a Foreign-
trader m most things, but a proposal to lower
the duties on motor bodies roused him to a
passionate defence of Protection. Before
the war, it was explained, nearly all the
motor bodies sold in Australia were im-
ported. But Holdens, of Adelaide, set to
work, and by standardisation and mass
production turned out thousands of bodies
per annum at remarkably low prices. Orders
came in so rapidly that they had to provide
for an output of 4000 per annum. And not
only were they using Australian material,
out the workmanship was of the highest
class, and Holden bodies were being exported
to Java and Singapore. “Could the firm
carry on, interposed Riley, “if the duties
) VP1 'e reduced, as is proposed?” “It would be
in danger of destruction,” replied Foster,
forgetful of his dismal fiscal creed. The
House made the ancient happy by refusing
to give his pet industry a dose of Foreign
trade.
4he amalgamation of Federal and State
rolls in Vic., with coterminous subdivisions,
is not as simple as it seems. Every division
of a \ ic. electorate is a licensing dstrict for
local option purposes, and there are 217 such
areas in the present 05 Vic. electorates. If
these areas (called divisions in the State
and subdivisions in the Commonwealth) are
altered, the two drj r districts in Boroondara
may become wet, and wet territory may be
linked up with enough aridity to be converted
into dryness. When the electorates are re-
cast so as to reduce the number from 65 to
60 (Lawson’.s programme), there will have
to be another adjustment. A motion to post-
pone the next local option poll for 10 years
and leave the weeding-out of supernuous
drink-shops to the Licenses Reduction Board
would find favor in the Assembly. Then
divisions and si bdivisions of electorates
could be adjusted t<> suit community of inter-
est in regard to most essential things, and
not in relation to liquor alone.
Martin Hannah intends going on with

that can’t logically oppose the Tote.

The Lawson Government’s window-dress-
ing effort at the opening of the ses-
sion was sinfully weak. The goods
were hung up awry or thrown about
anyhow, and Noxious Weeds, Cattle
Compensation and Metropolitan Drainage
were poor stuff to offer the public after a
recess for six and a half months. But the
window became frosted later in the day when,
following upon an address of welcome to

several months, Argyle, of Toorak, let off
a tankini of gas about the value of imported
Governors.
The Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) New
State movement has been in progress for a
good while now and has published a lot of
literature, but it was only the other day that
the central executive resolved at Lismore to
“support only those candidates, Federal or
State, at future elections who declare them-
selves in favor of the New State movement.’’
So far nothing has been said about putting
up a secession candidate for every seat and
holding his signed resignation as a precaution
against cold feet, and furiously opposing anti-
secession candidates. These New States are
really too mild to offend a beetle.
Inevitable JEstell was at Ivurrajong
Hills, oO miles from Sydney, the other day,
promising a railway immediately. The cost
is to be £Ol,OOO or more, and when the sub-
ject was last mooted the Railway Commis-
sioners estimated the earnings at £l6OO a
year, a little over p.e. on a work to be
built with money borrowed at 61. There
are already three railways around the eit\ —
i 1° i*rlingford, Lidcombe to Regent’s
1 ark and Blacktown to Richmond—which
earn less than_nothing, and the last has been
doing so for •>7 years. Combined earnings
last .vear were £30,214, against working ex-
and interest on loan capital
£16,14 1 . So the loss was £36,002. At the
same bleak week-end Estell’s colleague
Dooley was out in the country telling people
whose land was taken last year or earlier
tor settlement, and who can get neither
principal nor interest though some of them
are m straits, that there is no money for
them. And that is quite true. The Doolev

KIEMEN’SCHNKIDER’S ADDRESS TO HIS ARMY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Still harping on the vanished imported banana,
the Akgus records that “the whole of the colony of
Fiji is np in arms at the very unfriendly act of the
Commonwealth Parliament in imposing a prohibitive
duty.” The leader of the agitation is Riemen-
M'hneidcr, M.L.C.
Boys who once devoured your vanquished dead,
Boys whom Riemensehneider’s often led,
W elcome to your sanguinary bed,
Or to Yictoree!
Sliall the House of Reps., depraved or “mental,”
Tax our fruit delicious, transcendental —
Tax it up to eight-and-four a cental?
-Never, proud Feejee!
Banish from your minds the thought of rum,
Kiss your dusky wives and bang the drum,
Crab your spears and war-canoes and come—
Come and follow me!
In your veins there flows the blood of freemen,
You were warriors once and still are seamen;
Forward, then, for Liberty and Rieinen-
Schneider, M.L.O. !
On to Melbourne, where the streets are wider,
Onward in the wake of Riemenschneider,
Leader as impetuous as cider,
Effervescing free I
Though the Aussies flaunt their tattered banners.
Though they sock us on the head with spanners,
Vet our green and duty-free bananners
They shall eat or dee!

Nowadays the profits claimed by the manage-
ment do little more than provide the amount
required for the 10 p.c. div.: for 1920 the
accounts showed £15,312 and for the past,
year £15,121. In the table £2500 set as.de
in an insurance and reserve fund in both
years has been added. Disclosed net earn-
ings have improved considerably since the
dull 1917-18 run; and, though the amount
disclosed for 1919 was £5OOO greater than
that for the past 12 months, that record pro-
fit was not wholly derived from trading:
the sale of four vessels to the North Coast
8. N. Co. uo doubt helped considerably.
Although Allen Taylor’s lias done well and
has, assisted by the profits from the sale
of a few assets, given its supporters an
average of 10 p.c. p.a., the business is vis-
ibly not what it was a few years ago when
Governments had little difficulty in raising
loans to finance construction booms, and
wage-rates in the scrub and elsewhere hardly
mattered. Profits were only a few hundreds
less in 1914, hut the eo. nowadays has timber
areas, mills and equipment with a hook
value of £60,795 compared with £35,590
seven years ago. Put another way, though
the co. has nearly twice as much sunk in
timber interests as it had seven years ago, it
is earning very little more. The comparison
which follows gives further details over two
seven-year periods, the 1918 figures being
included to show shipping interests prior to
the sale to the North Coast Co.:—

Taylor’s may, of course, be doing better than
its published balance-sheets admit. Profit
and Loss accounts are not communicative :
one line alone presents what tin- directors
declare to be the net profits. No hint is
given of the amounts provided for deprecia-
tion or of the basis on which stocks are
taken two vital factors affecting the vol-
ume of profit presented. Comparing the
various balance-sheet items over a number
of years there have been indications of sub-
stantial allowances made for depreciation,
while the directors regularly declare that
values have been carefully taken and that
the book debts shown in the balance-sheet
are all they should be.
Allen Taylor’s has been a very successful
concern. The present co. took over an old
business 16 years ago, and for the past seven
it has paid good dividends on a capital 21
times the size it employed in its earlier
years. There has not been the proportionate
amount of surplus profit after paying these
divs.; but, despite the troubled times, the
co.’s position has been steadily strengthened.
Between 1907-14 liquid assets moved from
£38,986 to £149,842 and the book value of
fixed assets from £33,789 to £72,773. But
£90,000 of new capital and £8125 of pre-
mium thereon aided the rapid expansion, and
the business was also assisted by about
£22,400 of accumulated profit. During the
past seven years the liquid assets have
mounted to £171,068, and the book value of
fixed assets to £101,882, liabilities mean-
time having increased £34,715. The co.
during this period has therefore benefited by
£15,620 of surplus profit. Its position is
snug: the surplus of outside investments,
book debts, stocks and cash over and above
liabilities represented, at the balance, 13s.
2d. per £1 fully paid share. Of that Od. has
since gone in a div. In addition there are
timber interests, mills, wharves, a 9-acre
freehold recently acquired on the Parramatta
River, vessels and various equipment with
a book value of Ids. 7d. So long as the in-
surance . reserve is not cut into—the extent
of the risks to which this fund is exposed is
not visible —there are thus, after paying the
™jal div., net assets with a book value of
2fc»s. 3d. to represent each £1 share.

Here is anotlfer co-op. agency concern whose
latest accounts give evidence of the troubles
which have beset sheep- and cattle-men. Hav-
ing built up a large wool business, a couple of
yours ago the directors decided to handle live-
stock in a big way, and Maiden Bros.’ inter-
ests were acquired. Lately the co. has also
operated successfully on behalf of breeders at
Jsydney sheep sales. But notwithstanding
its new activities, only on one occasion dur-
ing the period covered by the table have
profits been so poor. The year was full of
troubles. The wool position was so seri-
ous (hut ut the balance 23,000 bales were
on the co.’s hands compared with 4725
months previously. In the produce
department low prices made operations
dilhcult, many clients refusing to consign
their produce to the depressed markets.
Nevertheless, the Co-op. Wool and Produce
Co. s gross earnings were £25(.M.) larger than
toi the previous 12 months, but outgoings
including rebates, moved ahead £5727. Ex-
penses also included an appropriation for an
employees’ provident fund established a
couple of years ago, but the amount voted
this year is not made clear and cannot
be shown. The usual oue-fifth of wool
commissions was rebated, but iu other
departments only 10 p.c. of selling charges
was returned to producers—one-half of the
concessions made iu the previous year. After
paying these bonuses only £223 of profit
remained, and a dividend has been passed.
'\ itli the abandonment of the wool pool
there has been substantial shrinkage of the
balance-sheet figures. The following com-
parison of balance-sheet entries goes back
just prior to the time two storeys were added
to the co.’s big Pyrmont stores:—

Cash and public

The co. now finds that additional capital is
required, and a couple of months ago the
present nominal capital of £OO,OOO was
doubled, the new shares created carrying
preference rights. The directors offered
4n,MJO of these shares, present holders
having the right to take up one pref. for
each ordinary held. The new shares carry
P- c - P- a - and are preferential as to both
divs. and capital until March 31, 1020, when
they will become ordinary shares, ranking
with the present lot. As an inducement to
holders to take up the new issue, shares
applied for prior to June 30 were to be
issued as paid to os. each, a concession which
would take £11,250 of reserves, the issue
thus giving the co. £33,750 of additional
funds.

This Sydney electric supply co. is the Syd-
ney City Council’s only big competitor; "the
Corporation has captured municipalities
which otherwise would probably have been
fed from the Council’s mains. It started
in the suburb of Balmain over 13 years
a g o under a special Act which gave it tiie
right to supply light and power in return
for relieving that municipality of its garbage-
destruction troubles. Shortly after its
establishment adjoining municipalities de-
to su Pl )ort th o Cornoration, and several
ot the western suburbs are now lit by the
Balmain .concern. Leichhardt was recently
connected up, and that apparently marks the
“P 1 ? i- e ?l Ja ßsion. But having become
established in these municipalities the Corn
can, without fear of competition, develop its
house-lighting and power-supply business
there, and rapid progress is being made in
that way. Last year there was a record
number of new connections. Twelve months
ago ±loo,b€o of new shares was ottered and
rull} 7 applied for to finance additional plant
but, owing to delays in delivery of orders at
the balance only Is. per share had been col-
lected on this issue, though ss. has since
been called up. The development of the
Corporation’s interests is shown in this
comparison :—•

.Though dividends totalling p.c. were dis-
tributed during the past year, the enterprise
is not likely to grow fat. Its tariffs are
controlled, and, like the gas cos., it must
state its case in court if an increase is
desired. Last year expenses mounted
rapidly, the price of coal increasing 25 p.c.
and wages 33 p.c., and the co. is now
burdened with heavier taxation. Recently
the Court was applied to for permission to
increase prices six-tenths of a penny per
unit, but only two-thirds of the claim was
granted. The municipalities served by the
co. are also protected: they have the right
to take over the concern, on valuation, at
stated periods, but it is doubtful, if they did
want to acquire the undertaking, whether
between them they could find the cash to
finance the purchase. In any case, the co. is
under bond to treat them at least as liberally
as the City Council treats its municipal cus-
tomers. So long as the co. behaves itself its
position .should be assured, and with a con-
tinuance of good management it should he
able to give shareholders an adequate return
on their investment, and at the same time
give the public cheap and efficient service.
And that is more than can be said for the
City Council enterprise these days, which is
being buffeted by aldermen of Bolshie ten-
dencies, and, for two winters, has denied
•shivering citizens the use of radiators. The
E. L. and P. S. Corp. was put under go d
management from the beginning, and for
some years was chairmaned by ex-Railway
Commissioner Charles Oliver. On his death
last year the co.’s capable general manager
and engineer, John Donohue, was elevated to
the Board.

This little co. was established seven years
ago by the N. S. Wales Chamber of Manu-
factures to carry the workmen’s compensa-
tion risks of members, and the table shows
that the move has been fully justified. Some
manufacturers were slow in supporting the
concern which set out to handle the business
ot cost price, nevertheless it has developed
so well that, though there are about 70 insur-
ance cos. writing pelieies, the Manufacturers’
Mutual now carries one-tenth of the State’s
total emDloyees’ accident risks. Its figures
7 a , ve expanded in this way, premiums shown

The growth of premium income is not alto-
gether a reliable guide to the progress made:
a couple of years ago, when the cos. sniffed
the possibility of the Government making
the business a State monopoly, the under-
writers reduced rates, which last year were
again lifted—but not to the old level—when
the amended Act nrovided workers with addi-
tional concessions. This co., which natu-
rally enough has not been popular with the
associated cos. and had to go abroad to
arrange re-insurances, has followed the gen-
eral tariff. But though its net premium in-
now nearly four times what it was
in 191 1, there is still plenty of room for expan-
sion ; for there are many shameless manu-
facturers who, while impressing on the public
the iniquity of patronising foreign manufac-
tures, place their insurances with offices
which invest not a penny of their funds in
the Commonwealth and divide ail them Aus-
tralian-made profits overseas. However, the
Australian cos. have been securing a better
hearing of late years, and the Manufacturers’
Mutual, .up particular, is rapidly gaining
ground in its special branch of insurance,
lhe recent swift development of AustraLan
industry should further assist it.
Last year was an unfavorable one from a
claims noint of view: 51 p.c. of net pre-
miums went in losses, com oared with 42.3
p.c. for the previous year. But no less than
six points of that 5.7 p.c. difference was
saved in exes., the cost rate having been got
down from 18 p.c. to 12 p.c. That is where
lliis mutual co. scores; its business is writ-
ten cheaply, the latest cost being less than
‘■•third of that reported by many large
offices. So, despite the less favorable claims
experience, the year closed with a surplus
equal to 37 p.c. of the net premiums. Of
•he surplus of £25,917 interest
earnings) the parent Chamber was voted
£4OO. That left a balance of £25,517; but
only £10,592 has been taken credit far as
profit by the management. This shows how
the £25,917 in the first table was arrived at:
Profit as per accounts .. .. £1,0.592
Added to reserve for unexpired risks 11,259
Added to reserve for contingencies 3,000
War Loan interest .. .. .. 1,060
Apart from the appropriation for taxes,
reserves now amount to £43,230. That is
equal to 67. p.c. of last year’s net premium
income, which is an unusually large pro-
vision for unexpired risks. The reserves
have been accumulated in seven years with
the assistance of a paid capital which even
now amounts to only £4589. Meantime 10
pc. divs. have been paxl (from the begin-
ning) and about £47,000 has been distributed
m divs., bonuses to policy-holders and by-
way of grants to tlie parent Chamber. In-
vestments are a splendid lot: of total assets
of £74,715, £68,000-odd is gilt-edged or cash.
The Patrick Steamship Co., Ltd. —The
last inter-State shipping co. formed was in
the mid-’nineties, and that —the Melbourne
S.S. Co —was merely a pooling of the inter-
ests of three old firms. It was the last, that
>s to say, until Cant. ,T. B. Patrick estab-
lished this co. in 1919. Patrick had been a
well-known skipper on the Australian coast
arm was a lieu L-commander in the Navy
during the war. When demobilised he put
every penny he had into the old Timaru,
which he himself commanded. The enter-
prise proved successful, and a number of
friends augmented the capital of £lO,OOO to
extend the operations of the co.—the only
inter-State shipping concern, by the way.
which has established its headquarters in
Sydney. Paid canital has smee been in-
creased to nearly £BO,OOO, the Induna, Gabo,
Mawatta and Sealark and the schooner Abe-
mama have been added to the fleet, and fort-
nightly services are being run to inter-State
ports—to Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and
nor’-west Tas. The co. has so far been more
or less a private one, and the shares have
not yet been listed on ’Change. But a first
report and balance-sheet have now been pub-
lished, covering onerations for the six months
to March 31. Though the co. is not in the
combine and is faced with strenuous compe-
tition from that quarter, the directors state
that the volume of cargo to bo carried is
increasing daily, notwithstanding the general
slackness in business; and owing to having
several large contracts your directors look
forward to further satisfactory result's dur-
ing the curent half-year.” Having been

The Stanmore Preserving Co. is not the
only Australian jam concern which has been
rattled by collapsed markets and the tin-
plate smash. A Melbourne war infant.
Cockatoo Preserves, Ltd., has also been badly
knocked, and the writing down of £1 fully-
paids to ss. and the raising of additional
capital is being considered as an alternative
to calling in a liquidator. Incidentally, Lon-
don has had a similar experience: Preserve
Manufacturers, Ltd., a eo. which in 1911*
took over an old-established business and
had a paid capital of £385,000, has sustained
losses of £208,000. Besides being unable
to unload manufactured stocks this 00. was
caught with a large holding of sugar for
which £lOO per ton had been paid but which
slumped to £7O per ton.

The old Maoriland merchant concern,
Joseph Nathan & Co., Ltd. —it was founded
in the ’fifties and was passed over to a public
co. 20-odd years ago—is nowadays probably
best known as proprietor of a baby-food,
“Glaxo.” The co. was recently on the Lon-
don market seeking £300,000 of 8 p.c\. cumu-
lative preferred ordinaries participating no
to 12 p.c., aud in support of the issue—it
was snapped up within a few days—some
remarkable figures were presented. “Glaxo,”
which is described as “a standardised, lull-
cream dried milk for infants and invalids,”
was put on the market in 1908. By 1911
sales had grown to £14,509, for 1914 they
were £lOB,OOO, for 1917 £415,000, and for
1920 £1,413,425, last year’s turnover repre-
senting 10 million pounds’ weight of the
manufactured article. For the current year
sales are showing a 30 p.c. increase over
those of last year. The co. does a big dairy
produce and general merchandise business,
but it was mostly to provide factory exten-
sions for turning out “Glaxo” that the
new capital was sought. Paid capital will
now exceed three-quarters of a million, nearly
one-third of it 7 p.c. #
From “Old Banker” :
The Bank of England recently took the unprece-
dented step of appointing an influential Canadian,
E. 11. Peacock, to a vacancy on the Bank Court.
One of the lessons taught hy the war was that the
nations with a strong central reserve bank were
better able to weather financial storms than those
without. The appointment of a representative of
the self-governing dominions is the outcome of a
movement which has been proceeding for some time
in London with the object of securing closer co-
operation in banking, trade and currency between
Britain and the oversea dominions. The idea is to
forge a chain of central reserve hanks with the Bank
of England as the central link. The first move was
a recent act of the S’African Parliament to create a
central reserve bank there. In India, too, the Executive
has brought about a combination of three leading
banks under the title of the Imperial Bank of
India, which will function as a central bank.
Canada has no such institution, and co-operation in
hanking and trade between Britain and that
Dominion has Buffered. The intercourse between
the U.S.A. Federal Reserve Bank and Canadian insti-
tutions makes a move by London necessary if it is
desired that the centre of Canada’s financial world
shall not be New York. The appointment of Mr.
Peacock coincides with a movement in that
Dominion to establish a central bank to which the
Bank of England would give its benediction.
Australia presents a conundrum. Here we have
the Commonwealth Bank endeavoring to combine
the functions of a central bank and a competing
commercial bank. London critics contend that this
dual function cannot be successfully performed.
The central reserve bank should, they maintain,
hold the reserves of the trading banks, so that should
any crisis arise help would be furnished where
required, and generally it would apply corrective
measures when it observed the banking machinery
getting clogged, as in the instance of the breakdown
of London exchange last year. If Australia is to
keep in step with sister dominions a bank of this
character seems necessary. It would suit the trading
banks down to the ground if they could buy off the
competition of the Commonwealth Bank by turning
it into such a bank, and they would probably make
considerable concessions to do it.
Occidental Consolidated, Cobar (N.S.W.L
has been trying for some weeks to tune up
its collection of seoond.-hand machinery; but
apparently about four tons per hour is its
capacity. For the week ending June 23 the
mill ran 70 hours, crushing 276 tons assay-
ing 7.52dwt., and obtained an 88 p.c. extrac-
tion. Either the present plant must be
tickled up considerable or additional plant,
put in. Even then the future does not
appear rosy, if 7Adwt. stuff is to be the
average. The shareholders may possibly re-
ceive an invitation before long to subscribe
more capital, and it’s pretty common know-
ledge that a lot of coaxing was necessary
before the last preference shares or deben-
tures were taken up.
Adelong Estates’ No. 2 dredge has been
drifting through the poorest wash touched
since 1914, the average of 270,000 c. yd.
being 3.717 d. The lowest previous records
were 5.027 d. in 1918 and 5.059 d. in 1920, but
generally the plant has been luxuriating in
wash running 6d. to lid. Meantime No. I
dredge has maintained fairly well* a 6d.
average, though in 1916-17 it got down to
2!d. Last half-year this plant made a profit
of £1931, but No. 2 recorded a loss of £lBO3,
so the working profit was microscopic. How-
ever, the cheerful opinion is expressed that
No. 2 will soon be doing better, and as the
premium on gold built up the profit for the
six months to £2187, after £2027 had gone in
Board fees, taxes and other items, with the
assistance of accumulated profits £7500 was
passed out in divs. Finances are more than
comfortable: there is a surplus of liquid
assets of £13,601. The working account
tells how dredging costs have soared. Tak-
ing six months’ outgoings at £12,314, the
average weekly costs work out at about £23.>
per dredge. Of that sum nearly one-half
went in repairs and maintenance.
Golden Hope (W.A.) is going deeper. At
70ft. its prospects are promising. A Bulle-
tin man who saw the property at the height
of the Hampton boom ticked it oil' as a justi-
fiable speculation; but since then develop-
ments in the White Hope and at other parts
of the Block 48 field have somewhat dis-
counted its chances of success at depth.
Golden Hope requires a lot of cash tor
development, and in view of the depressed
condition of the Hampton L'lains market
the co. is likely to have some trouble in
squeezing it from dispirited shareholders.
The Hampton Celebration Co. has been
in existence over 18 mouths, but so far there
seems to have been neither a meeting of
shareholders nor a balance-sheet, and some
people are becoming uneasy. Meantime
development work continues to be barren ot
payable results. t #
Mararoa (W.A.) has been lately boring
outside the main ore channel in the hope of
picking up something new on the so-far dis-
appointing Light of Asia, at Cue. Five
holes have been put down without finding
anything to be glad about, and although
one or two patches of payable ore may ulti-
mately be struck the prospect of dividends
coming from it is remote. It looks as if the
mine had practically finished its payable
career before the Mararoa acquired it.
Associated (W.A.) shares have been in
demand in London on the strength ot a rich
find in the Keeley silver-mines at Cobalt,
Ontario (Canada), in which the co. is the
largest holder. Ore going from 300 oz. to
3000 oz. silver per ton over a width of from
two to 10 inches has been taken out for a
short length, and the face is still in stuff of
high value. Such bonanza silver occurrences
are quite characteristic of the Cobalt field ;
so also is the ribbon-like narrowness of the
veins. The management is having a hard
struggle to carry on operations at the co.’s
Ivalgoorlie mine without loss.
* * * •
Clyde Allan, who received his early train-
ing at the Ballarat School of Mines, has got
into the limelight in London as the dis-
coverer of a very promising gold show in
Northern Nigeria. Allan was for a time
handling the mining interests of the Wes-
tralian Bank and was later manager of
various shows in the West. He joined the
A.I.F. in 1916, and when demobilised became
a sub-manager of the Naraguta tin-mines,
a London-run Nigerian show. He was sent
to look over an alluvial gold area, but find-
ing it disappointing he commenced prospect-
ing for reefs or lodes. He has traced an
ore body for about three miles, and 50ft.
down has proved ft over a length of 140 ft..
reports values ranging up to 10oz., and
talks definitely of having unearthed a “valu-
able property.”
Last month’s yield of the Bendigo Amal-
gamated (Vic,) went close to the 7dwt.
mark, but only because of tributors’ contri-
butions. That is a matter on which the co.
is not frank; it does not disclose how much
of its gold is won by tributors and the quan-
tity dug on its own account. With gold
close to £5 10s. per oz.. even 6dwt. dirt
should pay present costs and leave a bit over.
But on a 6dwt. basis Monument Hill, North-
ern, Virginia and Hercules are all losing
propositions, unless the bulk of the work is
being done by tributors. Constellation
would scrape through with a 6.l4dwt. run of
stone, and Unity with s.Bldwt. ore would be
just behind the mark. Carlisle now fur-
nishes the best yield : 2166 tons averaging
o.93dwt. Fortunately this old mine can
keep up its record for a long time to come,
and as prospecting is going on from 11 other
shafts there is always a chance of some-
thing turning up to revive the field. But
it is a weary wait.
Jim Mackay has his half-yearly New
Langi Logan rhapsody finished, and the
market is moving. So it won’t wound him
if attention is directed to the fact that it
has taken £155,000 to work up to the present
patch. Yet the purse is empty: so power to
call up another £25,000 is to be taken. Im-
pulse at present comes from the good samp-
ling obtained in the drives on the east side
of the Langi gutter, opposite the spot where
the Catheart tributary drops into the main
lead on the west bank. If the current in the
old river has carried both Catheart and Langi
Logan gold to the east the best part of
£lOO,OOO has gone in prospecting the wrong
side of the gutter. The Bulletin years
ago suggested shoving a drive into the east
bank. Either the water was too heavy or
funds too short to get that job carried out;
but work is going ahead famously now. All
the same, it is unwise to go market-jazzing
over-freely because truck-load prospects are
good. The experience over the rich samples
in the South Langi ought to be a warning.
“M.”: “Oil and Gold at Taradale” is the
fantastic caption to the statement that a
co. is being formed to bore for petroleum oil
at Taradale (.Vic.). It seems that 47 years
ago the Comet mine was yielding 3oz. of
gold to the ton, when work had to be stopped
at 250 ft. because of a rush of gas, which
some people now believe to have been
petroleum gas. To force back this gas
water was poured down the shaft, and
when full the pump was started to lift
this water out again : but owing to the press-
ure of the gas, the water spurted 1001 1.
above the brace. That was the end of
things, and the mine was abandoned in the
full knowledge that payable gold was to be
won from a reef up to sft. wide. The diffi-
culty tliese searchers for petroleum will en-
counter is simple and primary. Gold occurs
in metamorphic rocks, which are sedimen-
tary rocks that have been subjected to heat.
Therefore oil cannot exist alongside gold,
because the heat which altered the rocks
would burn up the petroleum. Taradale had
better think again. # #
An attempt is being made in Adelaide to
raise capital to continue the bore at King-
ston (S.A.) which T. J. Whaley put down
to 1100 ft. in 1910. Ocean Oil spent 17000
on plant and 130(H) or so on drilling. Now
Southern Ocean Oil, in 150,000 shares of
11, is being floated to take over and sink
deeper. The vendor co. proposes to take
18,000 fully-paids and £5OO cash ; and 50,000
shares, to be paid to 10s. each by the be-
ginning of next year, are offered.
Although the Sardine mine has hitherto
supplied all the thrills on the Kangaroo Hills
field (N.Q.), the Shrimp looks as if it will
last longer and be the mainstay of the field.
The Sardine is, relatively, a small lode with
exceptionally high values, but the Shrimp,
which has always been regarded as low-
grade, has had its purple patches. ITobably
there are more of them underground, although
the bulk of the ore is low-grade. Since
George Blakoe discovered it, the pickings
from the Nos. 1 and 2 shafts have returned
.something like £25 for every ton of ore
crushed. A small shoot in No. 2 returned
20 p.c. tin. The lode is a crushed slate,
not too well defined as to width, carry-
ing tin values, but it promises to be very
large. The syndicate controlling it is am-
bitious, and despite the bad times is improv-
ing its treatment plant, which includes a 10-
head battery. Water in Oakey Creek is handy,
and further storage will secure an adequate
supply for larger operations. W hen the
plant is completed and in good going order
the Shrimp should do well.
* » * *
A report some months ago that a fine
silver lode had been discovered in the Cal-
ton Range, Cloncurry (Q.), led to a couple
of copper-gougers "oing out to investigate.
It turned out to be a silver-lead show carry-
ing good carbonates along __ the outcrop,
which was traced for about. 50 yards. The
lode is said to be from 2ft. to 3ft. wide, and
samples sent in assaved 30 p.c. lead and
51oz. silver. Silver-lead is not common in
the district, and the report of a silver find
probably led the gougers to expect horn-
silver, several deposits of which have been
unearthed in past years on the Duchess line
country. One used to give assays up to
20<J0oz'., but the veins were small and took a
lot of getting at.
The State arsenic mine at Jibbenbar (Q.)
has done a lot of development work during
the last few months, but results have not
been very unsatisfactory. The top stopes above
the 120 ft. level have shown less width, while
the No. 1 west drive missed the expected
shoot at the intersection with the other lode,
which was found to carry small leaders of
mi.spickel. The main lode itself is uncer-
tainly defined thereabouts. The stopes
between Nos. 1 and 2 levels look well and are
maintaining their size, but the search for the
extension of these shoots has been disappoint-
ing, and some of the other lodes in the vicin-
ity will have to be prospected soon for
supplies to keep the treatment plant going at
full pressure.
With big Mount Morgan off the list
Queensland has had a cold dividend spell.
For the first five months of the current
year only £4500 was handed out to share-
holders by gold-producing cos. in the North-
ern State. Over the same period last year
£54,103 was distributed.
A. Laurence Wilson, who has, in his
gentlemanly way, bossed all the main shows
at Ravenswood (N.Q.), including the Grant,
the Sunset and the Duke, has grown heart-
sick with the conditions in the old haunt,
and is turning his attention to Mt. Coolon.
He has secured several options there, and
is now after the nimble but needful shilling
to carry out development.
Waihi (M.L.), whose profits fell from
£157,W15 in 1919 to £146,811 last year, is
anticipating a further fall for this year. Not
only has the premium on gold slackened, but
there has been a heavy slump in silver
prices. Last year the old mine yielded
800,000 oz. of the white metal, which averaged
more than ss. per oz. Silver this year has
been under Bs., a falling-off which on last
year’s production would make a difference of
anything up to £80,600 to Waihi. Inciden-
tally, the return of 10s. per share to share-
holders cost the co. about £7OOO through
having to sell reserve-fund investments at
below book values. Waihi directors have
so far found no use for the £50,000 set aside
over 12 months ago for new mining enter-
prises. Several Maoriland shows have been
offered, but nothing of any value has so far
turned up.
New Ruby Flat, Branxholm (Tas.), has
not a penny to show from tin for the six
months to May 81. Sluicing was oft owing
to the dry season, a delay which, the direc-
tors’ report naively remarks, “can scarcely
be regarded as a calamity” in view of the
low price of tin. Also it gave manager
Holmes an opportunity of getting his races
and plant into good order. The half’s ex-
penses took £7Bl, and the balance to credit
of P. & L. slipped back to £259. The co.
closed its bgoks with only a couple of pounds
on hand and with £246 owing to creditors,
£2150f it advances to finance working. The wet
season has since set in, and the co. has been
working three shifts with a full water supply
on good patches of solid wash carrying fair
tin. A small clean-up since the balance has
given 84 tons metal. High costs are worry-
ing the little co., though, and, as Chairman
Smith puts it, New Ruby Flat has, for some
time past, “been merely a wage-distributing
concern.”

Mark Ireland, one of the old hands on
the Speck West Coast, has filled a gap in
mining records with reminiscences of “Pio-
neering on the North-East and West Coast
of Tas., 1876-1918.” It is an interesting
jittle volume which tells of the trials and
successes of the early prospectors and the
opening up of fields, and chats discursively
about old mines and miners.

At the distance she looked pretty. Fatigue

coast of Australia” and his wonder at the
way in which the craft of 30 years ago lived
through them. Yet some of those craft are
still staggering up and down on the old run,
though D. Jones has collected most of them.
“Ex-Dig.”: When the Digger named his
dug-out he hadn’t a meticulous regard for
the niceties of language, and a member of
the A.I.F. Graves Section, recently returned,
tells me that queer things are happening in
the reconstructed villages. In many cases
the ribald names of dug-outs found amongst
the ruins have been carefully copied and used
as house name-plates. One house proudly
proclaims that it is “ ville,” while an-
other is simply “The Blankards.” About
the latter domicile the occupant explained
with emotional enthusiasm : “1 understand it
was the name that your brave boys calied
their comrades. This is where some of them
fought for us: the least I could do was to
let the name stand in memory of the brave
Australians.”
“Sixenate”: The discontent among jury-
men has given birth in Sydney to an associa-
tion which is lormulatmg demands on good
union lines. These include a guinea a day
and no half-day fees when the jury happens
to cut out its work early, fares and focd-
money extra, proper bedrooms for juries
which are locked up, and double time tor
work after 4 o’clock. There are other
things, but the metiiod of securing them has
not yet been decided. Presumably agitation
and representation are to be relied upon in
the first place; but if these fail anything
may happen. The S. M. Herald’s tripe-
hound whose business is industrial news
may yet have to attend the courts to ascer-
tain the latest development in the strike
caused by the objection of unionist jurymen
to the employment of a non-unioinst; and,
years after that, a criminal may object to
be tried if the jury includes a man who
blacklegged in the great jury strike. #
From an old art-collector:
The latest absurd instance of how Felton Bequest
money is frittered away on minor purchases for Mel-
bourne National Gallery is a set of four small paint-
■ngs in oil by one Highmore, who seemingly lived
in the middle of the ISth century, and couldn’t
draw a cork. The pictures are said to illustrate
four scenes from the Richardson story of "Pamela,"’
and their value is alleged to lie in their depiction
of the period. But the period is already sufficiently
mirrored in the well-known works of Hogarth ; and
Highmore’s illustrations amount to no more than
inhuman caricatures of Hogarth’s. Pamela presents
such a figure as never could have lived and breathed
in tight corsets. The absurdity of those four pic-
tures is only exceeded by their ugliness. And £5OO
was paid for the set. A compensating purchase is,
perhaps. Prof. Rothenstein’s portrait of himself •
( £180) in fanciful winter garb against a snow back-
ground. The picture is unattractive, but full of
force. The face is coldly but convincingly real.
The costly picture of “Susannah and the Elders,”
to Millet, is a thing to be considered in
a" jftood of enthusiasm rather than in cold blood.
Gloomily regarded, apart from the half doubt as to
its being a Millet, it is not a picture to be rushed
with a cheque for £2400, whith was what it cost.
At a first glance Susannah looks dear at the price,
and you wonder why the Elders worried about her.
But probably she is worth looking at some more.
The picture deserves a chance to grow on the casual
observer, like the fine “Garden of Pan,” by Burne
Jones, which makes some Philistines cross on account
of its formal array of pre-Raphaelite vegetable
growth in the background.
“Domino” : Test examinations are in pro-
gress here in Vie., and there is the usual
crop of howlers. This w-eek : ‘‘Give the mas-
culine of ‘laundress.’ ” —“Launpants.” “Write

“Rounds” : In Melbourne Court of General
Sessions the other day Judge Dethridge met
a prisoner with a new tale. He was a 19-
year-old, described as a fencer and axelnrn,
but of late a liorse-stealer in partnership
with another young man from S’Australia.
The one had nothing to say; the other asked
to be flogged instead of “jugged,” giving his
reason as follows: —
I have been in Melbourne Gaol for two months
and it has done me no good. I have learned how
to open a safe and to use various tools. I have
heard other men state their experience- and I think
it is tending to make me more of a criminal than
I am now. I think a flogging would do me a world
of good. It would be a severe reminder, and the
next time the thought came into my head to do
wrong I would reflect that it would be pretty rough
to have to go back and get 12 or 15 strokes.
Judge Dethridge promised to consider the
youth’s request, which later on he found he
had no power to grant. But assuming that two
months in Melbourne Gaol had not done this
precocious youth any good, the question
arises whether a first offender, or a second,
third or fourth offender, doesn’t get good or
harm out of imprisonment according to
whether he is inclined to reformation or
otherwise. Humauitarianism might be im-
pressed bv the prisoner’s plea for a flogging;
but a cvnical old police-sergeant merely said
that “the bloke who tells the best tale is
often the smartest impostor.”
“Quill”: In Sydney’s “escaped nun” case
the other day Campbell, Iv.C., while ques-
tioning Bishop Dwyer, asked if something or
other was in the canon law. Shand, Iv.C.
(for the lady) : “I object, unless the canon
law- is put in for us to see.” “Right,” quoth
NO PROFITEERING.
"Yes, my divorce cost me more than my wedding."
"Bui, darling, you know yourself it was worth more."
Campbell, “I shall put it in,” and solemnly
handed the Bench a pamphlet about the size
of a race programme. ‘‘What’s this?” tusked
Ferguson, .1. "The canon law, y Onah,
answered Campbell, as grave as an under-
taker. Heaven knows what it was. It
went into the junk-tip of “exhibits” with
the rest, anyhow. Ilad the canon law of
Mother Church actually been wheeled up—
well, as there are merely 796 S vast volumes
of it and 2463 appendices thereto, and 27,000
acres of printed elucidation, the Court would
iiave had to adjourn to Centennial Park, and
there would have been work for the unem-
ployed till Christmas.

“Adelaide”: Prof. Wood-Jones, the anato-
my expert lately acquired by Adelaide Uni.,
is shocked at “the utter lack of facilities for
research and teaching in anthropology in
Australia.” He attended the recent confer-
ence of scientists in Honolulu, and when
different countries, even to the Philippines,
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
TRAVELLER: “Here, why didn’t that train
stop?”
PORTER: “Yon should have waved the red

vacancy in Parliament!"
had reported what they are doing in the
study of the dying races, he was “profoundly
humiliated” to have to. confess that we are
doing just about nothing. The late I rof.
Edward Stirling built up in Adelaide Museum
what is arguably the. finest collection of
native material in existence,. and Oo{l '
Jones urges that the local Uni. must found
a Stirling Chair of Anthropology. Prof.
David, who was present on a visit from
Sydney, warmly supported this, and urged
in addition the importance of keeping the
raw material (so to speak) on view for
study, by establishing Binghi in reserves
well away from temptation and infection.
“Gig”: At our capacious boarding-house
favored “guests” have balcony rooms, with
sleeping-o.t accommodation. The balconies
are partitioned by slim, pine walls, and I
found, after being in quarters a week, that
over against me slept Miss Barnes, a small
end not too juvenile typist. Miss Barnes
met me at breakfast the other morning.
“You have taken the room next mine,” said
she. “You sleep out, too, don’t you? But
you don’t snore. Mr. Jones, who had the
room before you, slept out also, but he was a
great snorer.” With a touch of admiration
she added, “Oh, a wonderful snorer!” Then
v,ith a sigh: “It’s such company!” Alas,
poor me, I have no accomplishments
“Fax”: What one specially likes about
Mackennal’s equestrian statue of King
Edward VII. in the Alexandra Gardens
(Melb.) is the absence of fal-de-rals from
the pedestal. The subject is simply named
and dated, and that’s all —as it should be.
Nobody laid the foundation stone, nobody
unveiled the work of art. Now, the memorial
to Queen Victoria, in the vicinity
of the Edward statue, is largely
devoted to fal-de-rals, apart from
four prosy allegorical presentments
of Goodness, Mercy, Wisdom and
Grace, or what not, and four little
lions that resemble four harmless
watchdogs. You leave this mem-
orial with a dazed recollection of
red granite pillars, incidental
figures and gold lettering. You
couldn’t throw a pebble at the
abomination without striking a
legend of one sort or another. The
lines that hurt most are out-of-
date advts. of persons now de-
ceased. The pedestal tells that
Lord Mayor somebody laid one
particular stone on a certain
date. Another piece of gran-
ite states that the thing was
“unveiled” by John Madden,
Lieut.-Governor, on a certain date.
And at a bottom corner of this
stone, carefully engraven, is the
postcript “Sir Henry Weedon,
Mayor.” Posterity is expected to
be interested in the fact that Wee-
don was the Mayor when a lament-
able memorial was extricated from
its winding sheet! Posterity could
be spared these insolences in a
measure by permitting the gold to wash out
from the lettering: but a safer plan would
be to chip the inscriptions away with a
chisel as a warning to future mayors and
acting-Governors.

“Dido”: The big blue motor-car had come
whirling out of Albert Park, heading for the
St. Kilda-road. The large party aboard was
a bit merry. Suddenly all aboard were con-
scious of the fact that some person, place or
thing had been hit. There was an outcry,
and the driver swerved off and pulled up.
Almost instantly an excited, breathless run-
ner arrived at his elbow. Back on the road
lay the white figure of a woman. The pedes-
trian grasped the motorist. “This is goin’
to cost you a bit.” he said. “We were on’y
married last week”—he pointed back to the
figure stirring on the ground—“and jist look
at her now!”
CHILD SONG OF THE WINTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
White lady, white lady,
The bilveT wind goes
Under green branches shady
To nip the world’s nose.
The morning is prancing,
His yellow hoof shines;
And his big eye is glancing
Through twists of the vines.
White lady, white lady,
Your dress is of blue;
Your hat broad and shady
Lets golden lights through.
One foot in the stirrup;
And off the girl goes,
While the little birds chirrup
To see her pink toes.
White lady, white lady,
The silver wind flies,
Now sunny, now shady,
To look in your eyes;
The brown leaves are dancing,
The green leaves are gay,
With the morning horse prancing
Down Hyacinth Way.

TASMANIA’S GARDEN FACTORY.
K +K D *T eW £ f amount of interest shown by the public in the establishment
by the Houses, Cadbury’s, Fry’s and Pascall’s, of a large factory at Clare-
mont, near Hobart, the following information will be welcomed by our readers.
The advantage of direct rail communication with the wharves was recentlv
demonstrated in the landing, transport and storing of 600 tons of cement on the site
of the new works in two days, which reflects credit alike upon the Marine Board of
Hobart, the Tasmanian railway authorities, and the Cadbury-Fry-Pascall organisation.
This British cement, with a further 1000 tons to follow, removes a cause of delay,
and makes progress possible. Henceforth local supplies will be available.
preliminary W ° rk upon plans and preparations is now largely completed, and
the buildings themselves are rising into view, the foundations resting upon a bed of
natural concrete only two or three feet below the surface.
A first instalment, of fourteen houses is being erected for workers arriving from
England. The number of such will be confined to experts, local labor being availed of
to the fullest extent possible.
It i ls *?°Ped that a start wiH .be made with the manufacture of confectionery toward
the end of the year (when Pascall’s confectionery, Fry’s cocoas and chocolates, and
Oldbury s cocoas chocolates, of the quality always associated with these names, will
begin to take their places on equal terms with other Australian-made goods, free from
the overloading which Customs duties have hitherto imposed.

“Sea-cook”: Queer things do happen at
sea. The N.S.W. State Government steamer
Kiama, loaded with bine metal and caught
in the other night’s big blow, was doing
nicely till the wheel chain controlling the
rudder slipped off the quadrant. Then, while
all hands were expecting the vessel to
broach-to and be swamped, the Queer Thing
arrived. The rudder jambed and the Kiama
turned in a circle and pulled up hove-to in
her original position. The sea-front is now
wondering how the D. Jones she did it.
“Trion”: Here’s a page from life that’s
got me thinking. The old man was trying
to make a tradesman out of him, and' the
boy was bright for his 16 years, and
doing well. Then the boy attended a
“thought-reading” show.and sent up a note:
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
ALISON: “ Would you call Jack's fiancee
pretty!”
JIM: “I would if 1 was talking to Jack
about her.”
‘Shall I ever be a successful jockey?”
ies. you will be a very successful jockey,”
the woman told him, answering, as usual,
without opening the note. The boy was
importunate, so the old man appren-
ticed him to a stable. Within a week a
horse rolled on him. The old man brought
the boy home one day last month and we’ve
just buried him in the cemetery by the river.

From a State which has had six years
of hard borrowing, drastic taxation, State
Socialism and Labor administration:—
I am waiting with a hundred others, mostly
women and children, in one of the Theodore Gov-
ernment’s rations bureaus. Lounging about the door
and sitting on boxes in the yard are another couple
of hundred, and the whole boiling have bags. From
the open door of an adjacent flook-faetory comes a
shower of flock-dust, which blows on just and un-
just. We cannot escape it, for if \ve travelled out
of range we should lose our turn, and that would
mean another three hours’ wait.
Enter a bustling official, spectacled and self-
important—a defeated Labor candidate, no doubt.
“Brown! Jones) Smith!” he shouts. The buzz
of conversation ceases, and two men and a woman
push their way to the counter.
The woman is “Brown.” Goggles peers at her
over his spectacles. “Brown,” he begins. “Bread
and meat —how much?” Armed with pencil and
receipt-book, he prepares to write out the docket.
“What?” the woman asks. The question is petu-
lantly repeated. Evidently imagining him to be
the butcher, “Brown” asks in a trembling voice,
“Well- —er —have you a nice small leg?” “ What?”
“Well —er —a nice piece of beef?” She is obviously
terrified. “Now, my good woman,” says Goggles
with heavy sarcasm, “dors this look like a butcher’s
shop ? Do you see any meat. hanging round here ?
Can you see any dogs outside?” “No —yes—well,
I thought,” stammers “Brown.” “Now,” he pro-
ceeds, “how much of your order do you wish to
spend on bread and meat?” Comes the reply that
4s. worth of meat and 3s. of bread might do.
Goggles scribbles on two dockets, an assistant writes
out another and a fourth is prepared for the use
of the police. The four papers are pushed at
“Brown,” and there is a deafening call for Jones
and Smith. The fact, that Jones and Smith have
been waiting at the counter for 10 minutes is loftily
ignored.
“Brown” turns away, and a dark, hairy function-
ary roars “Ninety-nine.” “Brown” nearly stumbles
over a wailing infant in her eagerness to answer
her number. “Ninety-nine,” the hairy one repeats.
Reaching out, he grabs “Brown’s” ticket and raps
the counter with his pencil. “You have 14s. here,”
he says. "Butter, sugar, jam, tea, milk.” Wearily
she assents. Moving along the counter, she hands
her docket to the grocer, who weighs in with the
articles required. “Brown” stows them into a
worn dress-basket and shuffles away.
* * *
“Fax”: The compulsory closing of Mel-
bourne s fruit-shops when they clamor for per-
mission to remain open is very characteristic
ot authority in a profusely-regulated city.
'V hen I landed here, nearly 40 years ago, I
was soon made to feel a much-governed person
and the impression has only worn off in
spots. A fat policeman roamed the plat-
form at Hobson’s Bay railway station,
threatening to arrest any ignorant new-
cnum who was smoking on the premises. I
went into the Botanical Gardens with a
cigar in my mouth and was ordered to cease
smoking. Wet mustard is forbidden on
public eating tables, and if the officials could
banish it from the home they doubtless
would. Could any regulation be too im-
probable for a city where Sunday news-
papers are forbidden and wet mustard is
agin the law ? Needless to say, restaurants
continue to fall in with this weird Board of
Health law, which originated in the fact
that mustard remaining for on a
metal spoon in a metal pot is likely to
acquire verdigris. It never occurred to
the Board to order restaurant mustard to be
served in plain glass vessels fitted with
glass or bone spoons. The Board com-
manded the condiment to be served in
powder form, and as this saves trouble in the
kitchen, and has practically abolished the
public taste for mustard, restaurants delight
to be law-abiding in that one respect.

“Riom”: I have seen some queer names
and inscriptions on drays and waggons, hut
the queerest was this blazoned on a dray
owned by a parson: “Reverend Herbert
Henry John , M.A. (Oxon).” The
gentleman once stood for Parliament, and
tickled the electors by concluding his posters
with “10 to 1 on the parson, and no takers.”
* # * *
“Det Selloc”: Hearing about the row at
Darkey Haless place in Fitzroy the other
night, I asked Rosie Sinithers how it happened.
“All through a singin’ bloke frum Richmond
that Emmy Holt brought with ’er,” she
drawled. “ ’lm ’an Emmy wuz in th’ parlor
singin’ ‘My Life is Love,’ an’ the others wuz
out in th’ kitchen talkin’ ter Darkey’s missus
oo wuz maehinin’-up a tear in Ella ’Oskins’s
skirt. Just as Emmy’s bloke finished up
with one uv them squeaky ’igh notes of ’is
somebody laughed.” “Yes?” I urged. “An’
then Darkey took the oilcan off ’is missus’s
machine an’ sent ’is nipper inter th’ parlor
with it. That’s all.” I didn’t press the in-
quiry. But I heal’d that the consequences
included two broken windows, some plaster
off the wall in the passage, a mouthful taken
out of someone’s shirt-cuff, and a corner off
Mr. Hales’s ear.

“Ruby Queen”: I had the Digger’s view of
military swank well illustrated one night in
France. One of my cobbers was a hefty six-
foot Dane who had served: several years in
the Danish army and was a dab at physical
jerks and drill. Round the canteen fire he
would tell tales of army life in Denmark,
and get very worked up about it. One night
somebody blew in with a French rifle and
bayonet. “Ah,” said the Dane, “this is just
like the rifle we used in Copenhagen. I will
show you how I march in ceremonial parade
in the Danish army.” And, holding the rifle
like the French, well up on the shoulder, he
goose-stepped impressively up and down the
canteen. Just then Blue, the cook, blew in
for a couple of nightcaps, and asked, “What’s
up, Hans?” “I show you,” said Hans, “how
Ive marched in Denmark.” After describing
every buckle and strap aud stitch of uniform
he started the solemn goose-step again. Blue
stared at him open-mouthed for a minute,
then, “Gord spare me day 3,” he exploded,’
what a blanking lot of silly blankards yous
must ave looked!”

“Flinders”: The Westralian end- of the
A.1v.1. is making a particularly larg6-sized
ass of itself over a squib of a row with the
Esplanade Hotel, Perth. In the beginning
a maid-servant was sacked for refusing, to
take a cup of tea to another woman-
employee. A union organiser-—also one of
the shriller sex —called the remainder of the
staff out, and the majority went, and
are still out. - The Trades Hall in-
sists that they shall be taken back
and the substitutes (unionists or not) given

ing noises, but failed to move the pub man-
gement. Another great demonstration was
engineered for the following Sunday, and
when the news spread that “the lumpers are
coming up from Fremantle to chuck the
‘scabs’ out of the pub, as they chucked Gole-
batch’s police off the wharves,” a crowd of
trade unionists and about ten times as many
spectators turned up to see the battle. But
from the gas-platform on the green the
demonstrators saw a sight that chilled their
zeal —30 mounted police with waddies 21ft.

vice rifles, a field dressing-station with two
nurses ready to mop up the blood, and
barbed-wire entanglements top and bottom

decided unanimously that it wasn’t a good
day for a war.
THE TRIBULATIONS OF ART.
“The severest criticism of the annual exhibition'
ot British art at the Royal Academy is always to
be found in the Tailor and Cutter.”
1ST ARTIST: “ How did you get on with the
critics?”
2ND ARTRIST: “ Rotten! That damned Taii.or
fellow objects to my Eve on the
ground that the buttons are in the
wrong places.”
From a city consulting-room :
In spite of stringent regulations the drug-habit
is more widespread in Australia than is generally
believed. Probably doctors, chemists and nurses,
with a fair sprinkling of dentists, make up more
than 50 per cent, of the victims, for the doctors
are able to get the drugs at all times, while the
olhers have access to them. The devotees of the
drug-habit are generally pictured as mental and
physical wrecks, while the popular idea of the
effects of these drugs ranges from wild and erotic
exhilaration to a profound stupor in which the
victim remains for hours. As a matter of fact,
there is nothing to distinguish the drug-addict at
first sight, although advanced cases can generally
be spotted by the medical eye. Morphine, instead
of stupefying the brain, as most people think it
does, tones it up, with the result that the faculties
are sharpened; while cocaine increases the physical
powers of endurance and brings about a state of
pleasant mental ease and relaxation. This applies
only to those addicts who are able to obtain the
amount their system requires. Should any stoppage
of this supply occur, it is quite a different story.
With morphine and the other opium alkaloids, de-
privation is usually followed by acute stomachic
pains, which may increase until they are unbear-
able, and collapse and death may occur. Cocaine
is in a different category, there being such a
craving for it that the eocairie-taker who cannot
get his ration of “snow” may have his reason tem-
porarily deranged. Because of this, one authority
lias laid it down that “morphinism is a disease,
eoeainism a vice”; but both, sooner or later, end
m the same way, viz., physical collapse and mental
derangement, the first sign of which is nearly
always failing memory. But the point is that there
are many addicts who are not suspected, even by
their families, for the drugs are seldom taken hypo-
dermically in real life, no matter what characters
in fiction and moving-pictures may do. Often the
discovery is made only after their death, when the
finding of empty morphine- or cocaine-tubes tells of
a habit ranging over years.

Watkin Wynne, one of the founders of
Sydney Daily Telegraph and its general-
manager since 1884, died in harness last
week, aged 77. A native of Essex, he came
with his family to Victoria and became a
printer’s devil on the Ballarat Times, which
failed. Then he joined the Tribune, which
also failed, and it began to look as if no
paper could employ Watkin and live. But
the lad was a sticker, and, serving his time
somehow, he got on the Evening Post,
turned reporter and then leader-writer (he
had studied shorthand under Isaac Pitman),
and was managing-editor at the end. Three
years in Melbourne, as sub-editor of the
Telegraph, followed, and then with Angus
Mackay, Randal Carey, Robert Sands, J. J.
Casey and others Wynne started the paper
with which his name will always be identi-
fied in the history of Australian journalism,
lie was sub-editor at first, but soon the strug-
gling Sheet needed a manager and there was
a unanimous call for Wynne. Keen,
tough, indomitable, he was the very man
for the job. For a dozen years or more he
grafted like a nigger on both the literary
and mechanical sides of the paper, but the
Telegraph became firmly established, and
that was his reward. Along with a keen
mechanical bent —he introduced the Mergen-
thaler linotype to Australia —he had a fine
head for business. lie fought hard but
never unfairly, and, although there were
pressmen who did not love him, they ad-
mired his unflagging industry and fine
character. In his youth Wynne was cham-
pion long-distance swimmer of Victoria and
X. S. Wales. lie married at 22, and his
wife, who predeceased him, brought him
five sons and six daughters, who are all
living.
The death of Roderick Murchison, for
many years manager of the Bank of N. 8.
Wales in Melbourne, leaves a gap among
those officials who do their best in silence.
His service dated back to the time “Tich-
borne” ran a butcher’s shop at W agga
(N.S.W.). His coolness was shown in the
burst .of “the boom,” when his was one of
the three Australian banks that didn’t have
to reconstruct. In his own investments he
was successful, too, and a few years ago
was able to retire from the service a com-
paratively rich man; whereupon the Board
secured the benefit of his great experience
as Victorian adviser.
Edward Cairns Officer, the Victorian
painter, died suddenly at Macedon last week,
aged 49. A Vic. Gallery student in 1893,
he went to Paris to finish his training, and
then became a member of the Royal Society
of British Artists, but later on resigned and
started hanging pictures at the British In-
stitute and the Paris Salon. After his
return to his own country he became Presi-
dent of the Australian Artists’ Assoc.—a
collection of the leading men in three States
—and during the war raised a fine lot of
money for the Red Cross by holding exhibi-
tions of his best canvases. The Officers are
well-known squatters in Far West N. S.
Wales, and this member of the family has a
faithful likeness of a woolshed in the Mel-
bourne Gallery, whereof he had been a trus-
tee for some time.
In addition to 27 Iv.C.’s, there is now a V.C.
at the X. S. Wales Bar—Percy Valentine
Storkey. He won his first case the other
day, and briefs are pouring in.
WILLIAM JAMIE HON, first General
Manager of the Broken Hill Prop., and
still —35 pears later —on the Board.
Steve Johnstone, Professor of Zoology at
Sydnev ’Varsity, has a dry wit. An inebri-
ated student, cavilling at the Prof.’s unre-
portably fast lecturing, chided: “Don’t get
ahead to-morrow sir!” The Prof., drawled :
“Very well, Mr. Bones, and take care you
don’t, too.”
Died a few days ago in S. Aus, Matthew
Sliearlock, of Riverton, who fought in the
Crimean war and the Indian Mutiny and
came this way in ’5B. He did not marry
until he was 60 years old, yet his widow has
four sons and five daughters to comfort her.
The Speck’s Clerk of Assembly, John Kid-
ston Reid (of the same clan as Wullie of
Bananaland), has just completed his quarter-
century of service as confidential whisperer
to a succession of Mr. Speakers. lie is 58,
and was Clerk-
Assistant in the
Leg. Council for
nine years prior
t o seizing the
Assembly clerkship
in 1896. In his
youth (he cam’
frae Stirling at
17) he was a
popu 1 a r athlete
and shook a hefty
hoof for the island
in inter-State foot-
ball. Mostly h e
has been exceed-
ingly p opula r
with hon. (a n d
other) members,
though one of them
once threw a glass
of whisky at him,
and the waste o’
it troubled li i s

mightily at the

BRYANT,
Victorian K.C.
Recently-promoted Rear-Admiral Duma-
resq, R.N., who rules the Australian Fleet
while at sea, has an inventive mind. The
“Dumaresq Instrument” is nowadays a neces-
sary commodity in naval gunnery. In the
service it is universally called “the
Dumaresq,” but modesty compels its in-
ventor when giving orders to refer to it as
“the instrument.” He is a great encourager
of sport oti the lower deck. Two other
pleasing features about his promotion are
that he is (1) Australian-born and (2)
many years on the right side of ziffage.
“C.H.11.” : Re old enlisters in the A.I.F.
My father, Trooper F. E. Hyde, enlisted in
the first remount section of S. Aus. at the
age of GDI. He made a mistake of a mere
20 years when filling in some papers. Un-
fortunately, after four months in Egypt he
was compelled through rheumatic fever to
return home.
Frank Anstey, whose hands are already
pretty full as a Federal member, has allowed
himself to be nominated as a Labor candi-
date for the North-East Ward of Bruns-
wick municipality. If he gets in he will be
either frightfully bored or will make things
so interesting that the dailies will always
have a man at the council meetings.
A mound has just been heaped over J. I\
McLennan, the Vic. State teacher win
showed that it was possible to teach primary
agriculture to youngsters with a taste
for it. After doing fine work at Warragul
agricultural high school he was given charge
of the school of agriculture and the horticul-
tural gardens at Burnley. He was only 51
when the harvester called.
Colonel Semmens, principal member of the
Repatriation Commission, who has been
acting as head of the War Service Homes
Commission during the inquiry into its ad-
ministration, will most likely remain in his
present job, in which case there will be a
vacancy in the Repat. triumvirate. _ The
man who will probably fill the gap is Lt.-
Col. A. G. Farr, Deputy Repat. Commissioner
in N. S. Wales. Farr is generally popular
among the Diggers he has been repatriating,
though one, annoyed by the rejection of an
untenable claim, did write this on a slip of
paper and tack it to a wall at the Repat.:—•
My sustenance you meanly bar;
Thou art so near, though thou art Farr.
From the Federal Gallery:—
F. W. Bamford, lately Acting-Speaker in the Heps.,
is about the only ancient there whose wisdom doesn’t
seem to be impaired by advancing years. The occasional
remarks he makes are always characterised by un-
common sense, and I know no man who so readily
shatters the illusions of youth with home-truths
couched in quiet but piercing language. His in-
terest to me, however, is that he is about the only-
one of the Labor Conscriptionists who has retained
his other principles regardless of his rejection from
the Caucus. Ex-Laborites like Poynton and Laird
Smith have largely compromised or completely-
turned their coats on accepting office, but Bamford
is still a democrat of the Tudor-Charlton brand, and
would be found with them on most questions affect-
ing the betterment of the working classes. As a
private citizen he is very engaging, his only vice
being the theatre, on which he talks with a judg-
ment and knowledge that, add to the charm of his
personality.
William James Dickie, who ended tragi-
cally at Lyndhurst (M.L.), represented Sel-
wyn in the Maoriland House of Reps, from
1911 until the general election in 1919. At
the re-adjustment of electoral boundaries
Selwyn went out, a large part of it being
merged in Ashburton, which Dickie con-
tested in the Liberal interest against Nos-
worthy, and lost. Born at Cobden, West
Coast, 00 years ago, he was a better farmer
than politician.
“Kudex”: You needn’t pay your fare to
England to see V.C.-winners rattling tam-
bourines for a crust. In Adelaide I’ll show
you one who avoids the inconveniences of
hunger by collecting the empties from the
back doors of a grateful beer-drinking com-
munity.
George Dunn and his wife, who reside near
Ashbourne (S.A.), the other day celebrated
the 70th anniversary of their wedding.
They had their “diamond wedding” 10 years
ago, but no one seems to have had a name
ready for the recent event. George Dunn is
a son of the founder of Charleston, near
Woodside, and a nephew of John Dunn, who
built S. Aus.’s first flourmill.
A promising career was cut short when
parson D. T. Whalley died at Port Adelaide
at 42. lie was a Lancashire man, an engi-
neer by trade with journalism as a sideline,
till lie studied for the Congregational minis-
try. lie came to Australia 12 years ago, and
did a lot for education in Westralia during
his pastorate at Bunbur.v and Kalgoorlie,
lie had been at Port Adelaide since 1916,
lecturing in his spare time to the Workers’
Educational Institution.
Judging by a faded letter found among
the papers of tin' late W. K. Murphy, who
was secretary of Melbourne Trades Ilall
during the 1890 maritime strike, Charles
Jardine Don, Vic.’s first Labor member
(1859-64), left his resignation in the hands
of a committee in case it should be held that
he had departed from his principles. The
resignation was addressed to the Speaker.
So even in those days there was the nucleus
of the junta which, half a century later,
Hughes perfected and then cut loose from.
They are not all Bolsheviks and Anar-
chists in the North. The N. T. Returned
Sailors and Soldiers’ Association is compiling
a list of the Territorians who took part in
the Great War. So far it includes 227
names (there are more to be added), and the
adult whites in the Territory when tin l
trouble started numbered barely 2500. One
V.C. was won (Borella collected it), one
Justice FERGUSON listening to the Liguori
case on the N.S.W. Supreme Court
Bench.
Croix de Guerre (Joe Cain), four Military
Medals (Rindberg, J. Garr, D. J. Whiteford
and G. H. Whiteford) and two Distinguished
Conduct Medals (J. M. Macdonald and
Munro), and 40 N.T. boys gained the little
wooden cross. An obelisk has been erected
to their memory.
Edward Wittenoom of Westralia —“Ten-
foot Ned” to the alluvial diggers of IS99 —
has been getting back into the limelight.
Invited to a banquet of the Sun Yat Sen
crowd in I’erth, Ted described the local
Chinese as a “respected and cultivated com-
munity, speaking two or three languages
where most of us can speak only one.” Giv-
ing evidence before a Royal Commission on
Education, headed by Peter Board, the same
gentleman agreeably remarked that N. S.
Wales was the home of larrikinism, disloy-
alty and rotten Parliaments, and that its
expensive educational efforts had been a
failure. And Ned was a Minister of Educa-
tion himself from 1894 to 1897, which might
have been utilised by Peter as a text for a
few pointed remarks. Privately Wittenoom
is an affable and courteous old gentleman,
but in political and intellectual matters he
is the woodenest Tory in his State.

THE SMALL FRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On the ocean trail, where the big ships sail, expanse
reigns, vast, complete,
With plenty of room to swing a boom or slacken a
flattened sheet j
And the shellback sings for the jog of things, and
laughs at the word “Romance,”
While he plants his feet on a thing complete that
nurses a fighting chance.
For the big ships fight with the right of might, and
shatter the treach’rous seas,
And little they reck for a filled well-deck —grim goad
of an angry breeze.
Rigid and strong they forge along where the ocean
greybeards roll;
Hut the little wee ships make coasting trips and the
ocean takes its toll.
And who makes bids for the sailor's kids when the
owner buys his sou If
Wiml-lashed with an east gale's fury, Pacittc’s jaws
wide gape;
She spews her seas on the beaches from Eden to
Byron Cape;
Whilst under the loom of the coastline, unstable but
unafraid,
Mocked by their racketing engines, the small fry
ply their trade —
Hatches that seldom are covered, speed that is less
than speed,
Telling of sly back-handcrs to fatten an owner’s
greed !
These be the gods, ye small fry, who e'en your des-
tinies shape:
Officialdom running berserk and tangled in crimson
tape!
And the shore-folk, reading the papers, will shout
till their throats are sore
If Eurythmic wins the Melbourne Cup or Arm-
strong makes a score;
They heed not the screech of the scare-type, grown
stale as the years roll on:
“A double wreck on the North Coast —Two well-
known coasters gone!”
Men of the coasting steamers, skipper and plain A. 8.,
Engine and stokehold toiler—bond-slaves of a tyrant
sea!
Leaking and overloaded, top-hampered fore and aft —
For a job near home you’d chance it, and go to sea
on a raft!
The dead wash up on the beaches. The horse-haired
experts sit.
“Act of God” is their verdict, and that is the end
of it.
0 Power that fashioned the ocean! 0 Devil that
sent the ships!
Hear ye the cries of the women with blanched and
quivering lips?
Women who begged their men folk no more deep
seas to roam:
“Dear, get a job on a coaster, and keep near us
at home!”
Women and little children! Drown’d souls on a
surf-swept shore !
Someone must be judged guilty, someone must
pay the score!
The staunch-framed ships make long, long trips on
lone, grey, rolling seas;
Their screws whirl round with a tuneful sound that
tells to the list’ning breeze:
“All-conquering we! Efficiency our slogan wide
we fling —
Efficiency! So what care we what weather dawn
may bringt”
Their great cranks turn with a purpose stern, and
laugh at the crankshaft’s goad;
Great bows cleave seas as a knife through cheese,
and trace the long sea-road.
The foiled wind sighs to the funnel guys its hate
of the tyrant Man,
Who builds things stout that put to rout the hosts
in the Storm King’s van.
Rigid and strong they forge along where the ocean
greybeards roll;
But the little ivee ships make coasting trips, and
the ocean takes its toll!
Dear God! bid high, when the sea goes dry, for
the coasting sailor’s soul!
LONGSHORE.

At a recent lecture at Orange (N.S.W.)
on “The Story of Gold Discovery in Aus-
tralia,” there were present four ancients
whoxhad worked on the Ophir diggings. One
of them, W. Coomber, used the pick, spade
and dish on the held 70 years ago.
“Kulgoa”: I nominate Susannah 3\lilcham
for the long-distance pensionship. She was
the wife of .Tames Milcham, Senior Assistant-
Surgeon of N. S. Wales, who died in 1824,
and she received a pension from the British
Government from that date until her death
in 1885, at the age of 89—over 60 years.
: At a recent speech-making a stout
speaker had mentioned “this town of Lawson,
named after Australia’s great poet,” when a
friend whispered urgently: “The man who
discovered the Mountains route.” “The man,”
vociferated the speaker, “who discovered the
Mountains and enshrined them in one of
his most glorious poems.” And the crowd
applauded. 1 wonder if that applause was
lack of simple knowledge or just mere habit.
‘'Torres?” : Austen de Paoli, soldier of for-
tune, is a patient in the hospital at Thurs-
day Island. He was born in Corsica in
1829, educated in France and served in the
French Army; then went to Melbourne by
the French ship Flores in 1872. He did
some digging at Ballarat and afterwards
went up to the Murray. In 1881 he shipped
at Newcastle (N.S.W.) on the American
barque Mariana for Java, but the ship
stranded on a reef off Kiwi Island in the
Gulf of Papua. The natives killed all on
board except De Paoli and he lived with
them for 11 years. Then William Macgregor
came across him there, and, he says, took Ins
land away ; so he set sail in a dinghy and
made Thursday Island in short stages from
island to island. He landed with consider-
able capital in the shape of a pearl which
realised £3OO. De Paoli spent eight ot his
vears in Papua without seeing a white man,
the first to meet him being missionary Mae-
farlane. .
“Phil Ilarum”: Though the \ ic. Agricul-
tural Society’s idea of an Institute of Re-
search to perpetuate the memory of the late
William Farrer is splendid, I wouldn t like
the job of collecting the suggested bag of
wheat apiece from the 24,000 A ic. wheat-
growers who have
benefited by the
Federation varietv.
When the Farrer
scholarship was
started in N. S.
Wales a few years
ago I made a col-
lection among the
farmers in my dis-
trict. My biggest
contributor was a
man who had made
his money from
wool, not wheat.
One ol d cli a p
hadn’t a good
word to say for the
experts, but swore
by Federation. And
he was staggered
to learn that Fed-
eration was the
product of an
expert.
J. E. MACKEY,
M.L.A., barrister-
at-law, Speaker of
the Vic. Assembly.
“Ex-Dig.”: Different people did their bit
in different ways; and some out of khaki
did better than some in it. lam thinking
now of Cuttem, the little barber who visited
us in the hospital in London. He was five-
foot-two, and about 2Sin. round the chest,
knock-kneed and asthmatical. They wouldn’t
have him in the army; but as the next best
thing he started his own brand of war-
work around the hospitals, and had
free shaves to his credit when I met him. The
half represented a man who, on account of
injuries, could only be shaved on one side.
Cuttem insisted on giving a packet of wood-
bines with each shave; and any attempt to
pay the shabby-looking little enthusiast
almost brought tears to his eyes.
“Skyrider” : The people who reported the
death of old Henry Newman, at Mt. McDon-
ald (N.S.W.) recently, stressed the fact that
he dug his own grave and made his own
coffin “to save trouble to others.” But no-
body seems to have heard of his fine taste
in coffins. For years the old man used his own
particular casket as a cupboard. It was
painted a pale blue, and it stood in a corner
of his bedroom, filling the place usually
taken by a wardrobe. The shelves were
movable, and one of Henry’s favorite jests
was to take them out, lay the box on its
back, and ask his visitors to see if it fitted
them as well as it did him. A friend called
his attention to a serious omission. “You
forgot the screw-holes in the lid.”
“Screws?” snorted the old chap. “Whoever
fastens that lid needn’t use screws. Nails’ll
do. I won’t want to open it again !”
On a warrior who struck it lucky:—
The man who broke the Hun line on Ludendorff’s
“black day” is content to be known nowadays as
plain John Monash. There are fighting colonels and
generals of brigade and division in the Federal
Parliament, but Uansaro simply refers to them as
“Mr.” or “Senator,” according to where they sit.
By contrast a dull person who never heard a shot
tired in either the war with Kruger, which began
when he was 29, or that with the ex-Kasier, is
advertised throughout Britain as “Major-General tlie
lion. Sir Newton Moore, K.C.M.G., M.P.” And the
Australian dailies slavishly repeat the legend. Moon-
used to be a volunteer-officer. While the Boer dis-
turbance was raging he led a troop from Westralia
to Melbourne to see that no desperate Dopper cap-
tured the Duke of York. Afterwards lie got com-
mand of a Light Horse regiment, and he was still
in that position when a party intrigue not uncom-
mon in Westralian politics enabled him to fluke the
Premiership. As Premier he was such a failure that
he not only destroyed his party but ruined his own
chance of regaining his seat (Bunbury). To get
him out of the way the Liberals sent him to London
as Agent-General. Frank Wilson, a far abler man,
succeeded him, and shortly afterwards went down to
defeat while the real architect of ruin was enjoying
a cushy job 12,000 miles away. When the war came
Moore stuck to his post. To two posts, in fact.
After Gallipoli a man was wanted to command a Ba<=e
Depot in Britain, and Birdwood couldn’t or wouldn’t
spare one of his fighting officers. So Moore got the job.
Very soon lie was made G.O.C. the A.I.F. in Britain.
He still clung to his A.-G.-ship, which carried a
salary of £1590 a year, an entertainment allowance,
and the use of an £BOO motor-car with a chauffeur
to drive it. Always greedy for rank, he applied
for promotion to major-general. Promotion was
granted and gazetted, but the recipient of the honor
was informed that a major-general was too exalted a
personage to be G.O.C. in Britain. So our major-
general retired in some dudgeon. But he became
M.P. for a safe Conservative seat on the score of
being “one of the leaders of the gallant Anzacs.”
At least that is how he was described. It is illegal
to exploit the term “Anzac” for sordid purposes of
trade. The question arises whether it should not
also be illegal to exploit the sacred name or the
deathless traditions of the A.I.F. for the equa >
sordid purposes of politics.
An explorer who may have justice done
to him some day is A. R. Austin, the sur-
veyor who did a lot
of battling in the arid
country of Westralia
and gave his name to
Lake Austin. The
records of his wander-
ings are pigeonholed
somewhere in Perth
and have never been
published. Long be-
fore Coolgardie was
thought of Austin set
down on paper the
prediction that vast
mineral wealth would
one day be found in
the regions which he
traversed.

WHEELER, who has

the Royal Academy
and the Paris Salon,
and who while a
scrycant in the
Royal Fusiliers teas
awarded the Distin-
guished Conduct
Medal for conspicu-
ous gallantry in
action.
“Sixenate”: The German is a strange
animal. The manager of a large mostly-
Syduey business, who was so respected that
the Defence Department not only did not
intern him but let him act as trustee for
German internees, left the country a while
ago. He took £60,000 with him. And when
he went it was by a Java (Dutch) steamer,
because, he declared, he wouldn’t journey
under the British or American flag, so much
ill-treatment had he suffered during the war.
“Iola”: (.'apt. U. C. Cardew, who becomes
Commissioner for Native Affairs in ex-
German New Guinea, had some administra-
tive experience in Fiji, and was then for
over 11 years a magistrate in Papua. He
was regarded bv black and white alike as
one of the best all-round officers the Papuan
service has ever seen, _a reputation gained
through his wide experience in exploration,
in ordinary administration, and in handling
more or less savage races. Governor Murray
placed it on record that two natives of the
Delta Division, dying away from home % in-
stead of sobbing the names of their fathers
and mothers, called for their district officer,
Cardew.
THE HOME-COMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Home from far roving at length came the rover,
Home, hieing home, o’er the round of the Earth;
Northern nights done with and Northern days over,
Southern stars lighting the land of his birth.
Why should the name of his country inspire him,
Thrilling his soul like a magical word?
Whence came the frenzy, the fury to fire him,
When praise or dispraise of her honor he heard?
Was it the breadth of her, seeming nigh boundless?
Was it her mountains, her rivers, her seas?
Was it her hinterlands, sunlit and soundless,
Save for the sigh or the song of the breeze?
Not for her place in the rank of wealth-makers,
Not for her riches he held her supreme,
Not for the width and the yield of her acres,
Not for the beauty of harbor and stream.
Neither he loved her for time-honored glamor,
Kuins, green-ivied, or towers overthrown ;
Kingship in purple and knighthood in armor,
Hatties and sieges she never had known.
Something, more potent to mould and to move him,
Dwelt in her keeping for ever and aye,
Bone of his bone in the graveyard above him,
Flesh of his flesh intermixed with her clay.
Eyes that had wept with him, eyes that had laughed
with him,
Lips that had lightened with love-words his toil;
Friends that had stood by him, thirsted and quaffed
with him —•
Friendship and love linked his soul to her soil.
Memories red as the reddest of embers,
Memories ashen and pallid and cold,
Glowing loves telling of golden Decembers,
Marshalling, made him a part of her mould.
Musing aloof and alone by the breakers,
Breasting the thrust of the easterly wind,
Back of him millions and millions of acres,
This was the uppermost thought of his mind.
Bright, like a bride crowned with flowers at the
altar,
So she stood crowned with the love of his heart;
Stars might be quenched, but that love would not
falter,
Blood run in rivers and rocks fall apart.

HERBERT MORRIS
Portable Jib Crane
(Tubular Type) Patent.
TAKING down, handling and re-assembling are
simple and easy jobs when you include a Morris
Portable Jib Crane in your equipment. In fact,
wherever goods are handled in warehouses, factories,
workshops, etc., the Morris Portable Jib Crane stands
alone as a handy time- and labor-saver.
The Morris Portable Jib Crane is something new,
embodying entirely new principles of construction, and
is thoroughly tried and tested to 50% overload on full
British ton rating of 22401 b. The long arm castings
eliminate all weaknesses found in the ordinary
tubular crane.
The Morris Portable is half the weight and twice as
powerful as many so-called portables —and the price
is lower. Why not get all particulars now from our
nearest address? Sizes available, }, and 3 ton
capacities.
We invite inquiries also for Herbert Morris Triple
Gear Blocks, Spur and Worm Gear and Gravity
Lowering Blocks, Electric- and Hand-operated Hoists,
Overhead Runways, and all lifting and handling equip-
ment. Special folders, giving all information about
Morris Equipment, will be forwarded immediately on
request.

The Logs on the Store-road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS travelling overland to Nepa to
take up duty as Warden of the I-ake-
kamu Goldfield, out towards the Dutch
border in Papua. Merely because three
other men had travelled in the same direc-
tion a year or so previously, marking theii
line of march with Knife-cuts on the under-
growth, it was now called a road. And
quite seriously, too, for such is the standaid
of the Lakekamu ways. After two weeKs
in this tangle I arrived at Tiveri, or ‘ ihe
Store,” as it is always called on the field.
“Oh,” said a man in response to my in-
quiries about the remainder of the way be-
fore me, “you’ve got a damn line road now
—your troubles are over. ’ _
And, indeed, they nearly were: for had
not Providence been guiding my footsteps
over the logs on the Store-road, my earthly
troubles, at any rate, would have been over.
1 can picture myself now riding the mossy-
green slime of those logs as 1 would a horse.
Seated astride an extra-long one about six
inches wide, swaying above a torrent 15 feet
below, 1 see myself, feeling very sore in
certain parts, wiping the sweat out of my
eyes and feebly asking my patient 1 apuan
escort if he had not made a mistake and
followed the wrong roud.
So much for the Store-road. It was really
the Store 1 wanted to tell you about; the
road should have been left out.
Everything radiated from the Store.
Every prospecting-party started from the
Store. It was the hub of the field. There you
could drink anything, buy anything, gamble
anything; there you could hire a team ot
carriers, there you could have a spell. If it
was the latter you wanted it would cost
you nothing: meals were always tree, and
there was the ground to sleep on. W hat
needed man more? If you died there, as
men did —well, there was always someone
to bury you, and there was not always some-
one to do it on the claim. If you were down
with fever you would get a bunk and old
Bill’s attention. When everything else failed
in that inhospitable wilderness, you could
reckon on the Store.
The Store! What memories the name
revives! What events it recalls! On the
field itself it was “Who’s down at the
Store?” “When are you going in to the
Store?” “Did yers hear that Bonrke was
down at the Store?” And sometimes “There’s
been a hell of a row at the Store!”
Often it would be “Did you see my dog at
the Store?" Man and dog were always wel-
come there. It was a haven of havens. If
there was no room on the floor you could
sleep on the counter, provided the bar was
closing that particular night; at the worst
there was alwavs room in the Dead House.
“Where’s the Dead House?” I asked on
that first visit.
“Why, Mr Warden, you’re not needing
the Dead House, surely?”
“No, no!” I hastened to assure Bill. I
was only wondering.’’
"Well, it's that bungalow over there,
he said, pointing to a dilapidated shed with
two sides missing, about a hundred yards
away. '
“But it’s full of goats and dogs! I ex-
claimed. ,
Here the grey-haired storeman up
the conversation. “When a man’s full,” he
explained tersely, “he don’t mind a few
goats, and dogs are a man’s mates any time
in this country. When a cove gets over
the odds and upsets things in the Store, he s
dumped in the Dead House, and gets no
more until he’s a Christian again. It’s not
so popular now the gold’s running out,” he
reflected sadly. “It needs a bit of a clean-
up, too,” and he turned away to complete
the damper he had left unkneaded.
A moment later he was back again with
an order from Sunset in his hand, and a
worried look on his face. “If the boat
don’t turn up to-day we’ll all be in Queer-
street right enough,” he said. ‘‘There s
nothing much in the Store. 111 kill a few
goats and send them out to the claims.
Things are pretty bad, Mr. Warden.”
I was only too well aware of it. ihere
were a lot of white men on the field and
several hundred natives. These men were
on starvation rations because others far
better off had refused to load ships in Syd-
ney It was only the resources and un-
selfish efforts of those at the Store that kept
the men on the claims supplied with even
the barest necessities of life —and the neces-
sities of life don’t run to a long list in
these parts. Yet little or no grumbling was
heard, and the adversity was met with dry
jokes and the usual goldfield phdosophy.
Meanwhile orders arrived daily from Sun-
set and Mosquito Creek hinting at the
struggle that was going on in those places.
But there were traces of humor in them
all. Thus wrote one battler at Sunset; —
Tlig Store.
Sending in two of my coves for something to eat.
Nothing doing out here in that line. Hear Hogan s
retiring on the sago [swamps]. Murphy is ham
pressed, but potatoes is supporting his middle, me
flour you sent last week is pretty crook, but we ie
bogging into it. Have you got any more? 1 want
a Gun Permit for Moses, and if there s no jam <u
butter send us some of that black treacle and ask
the Warden to renew my ticket [Miner s Kigm : ;
Who’s in at the Store? Mick said he dgo in it it
wasn’t for the logs on the road.
Big men! Brave men! I think most
of them hardened their bodies the better to
protect the tenderness of their hearts.

who told interminable stories of his adven-
tures in the pearling trade up north. NY hen,
years later, every illustrated magazine had
pictures of the world’s champion liar, the
Monaro folk saw once again the voluble sur-
veyor's cook.

To Imp rove Country Life!
NO need to sigh for more comfortable
conditions, they are well within your
reach by Western Electric Power
and Light. This wonderful plant will “citify”
any country home —giving electric light for
the house, barn, stables, dairy, and so on.
It provides electric power that enables
womenfolk to live a comparatively easy,
genial life through the help of electric labor
saving appliances such as electric Carpet
Sweepers, Irons, Fans, Sewing Machines,
Clothes and Dish Washers, etc.
Another practical side of Western Elec-
tric Power and Light is that its 3£ H.P.
Kerosene Engine drives the pump, separator,
churn, chaffcutter, and other machines.
The ability to render three definite ser-
vices is what makes Western Electric Power
and Light the finest investment for any
country home, hotel or store. The size and
strength make it the most satisfactory plant
for lighting schools, churches, factories, rail-
way stations, picture theatres and institutes.
The Western Electric Battery has a Capacity
of 288 Ampere Hours (S.A.E. Rating) which means
plenty of electric current for both light and power.
It is protected from repair troubles because, it is
not only charged the right way, but the engine
stops when the battery is properly filled —a gradual
process —exactly right.
The 3X H.p. engine is fitted with Pump Fuel Feed and
Splash Oil Lubrication, starts at the touch of a switch, is air cool-
ed and throttle governed. How easy the plant is to buy and run
will be apparent to you by asking for 20 Page Book, post free

gfh
BRITISH
BELTING
From the mightiest transmission to the lightest drive,
DICK’S Original Balata Belting gives exceptionally
efficient and economical service under all conditions
—but MOST exceptional under abnormal conditions.
DICK’S powerful belts are everywhere solving the “brute-
strength” and durability problems on heavy service and
great main drives. Equally so in light transmission, where
speed is terrific, accuracy essential, and vibration must be
reduced to a minimum ; and on individual motor-drives,
involving small-pulley diameters and severe fluctuation of
load.
BELT USERS. —If you have belts causing expense or
trouble by reason of exposure to excessive cold, dust, dirt,
acid fumes, grit, oil, because of stretching, warping, slip-
ping under load, or inability to resist hard wear —we will
undertake to correct that trouble with DICK'S
ORIGINAL BALATA BELTING.

HEDLITE HEATERS
and
ELECTRIC IRONS.
When buying electrical appliances, look for the name
Hotpoint. It is a guarantee of the utmost efficiency,
and of that great strength which ensures lasting service.
THE
CHIEF REASON
why the Hotpoint Iron is to lie
preferred is its ATTACHED
STAND.
When an iron with a separate
stand is used it is lifted on an
average five times a minute.
If it is a six-pound iron, this
means lifting thirty pounds a
minute —over a ton an hour.
How different with the Hot-
point ! It is so nicely adjusted
that a touch tilts it back on
to the attached stand —no lift-
ing. no clattering, no banging.
Further advantages of the
Hotpoint will be fully ex-
plained in our showrooms.
No Separate Stand Required
The Hotpoint Hedlite
Heater makes a cosy cor-
ner anywhere. Its glow-
ing warmth makes its
presence felt, immediately
the switch is turned on. It
radiates so that every
part of the room derives
full benefit.
The Hotpoint Iron takes
all the drudgery out of
ironing day. It saves
running from stove to
ironing board, it elimi-
nates heat, nervous strain
and discomfort.
Its patented thumb-rest
“rests the wrist” and aids
the guiding. The handle
is always cool—the point
always hot.
Hotpoint Electrical Appli-
ances also include Coffee
Percolators, Teapots,
Toasters, Grillers, Chafing
Dishes, Immersion Heaters,
Hot-water Apparatus, etc. —
each one perfect in its way.

279 Clarence Si j, Sydney
The presence of a really capable, energetic,
honest financier at the head of affairs
amounts to three-fourths of a successful Min-
istry, and the other fourth doesu t matter
much. It is easy to throw together a
Cabinet of two ordinary elderly hacks and
11 fervid young lions, full of sound and fury,
of poetry of a sort, and eloquence of a kind,
and of fire and ill-digested theory and good
opinions of themselves, and bad opinions of
everybody else, and patriotism about some
foreign land, and impatience and intolerance
and fresh green ignorance and raw haste, and
that restlessness which makes a £2GOO-a-year
Minister travel 200 miles to address an infant-
school or open a plank bridge over a brook.
It is easy to get such a crowd together aud
make history or at least comedy, but if the
fiuance of the team is left to the office-boy
aud the office-boy is off his head the result
is ludicrous failure. Ordinary sins of mis-
government may be repented of, but no re-
pentance will shift a £100,000,000 debt sunk
in public works that don’t pay for axle-
grease, and which were only constructed
because the flibbertigibbet aggregation in
power had to fill in time somehow.
The Cabinet at Sydney has just finished
its first complete financial year, during most
of which it kept Parliament shut to avoid
unpleasantness. And this is part of its
record: —
(1) Its £3,000,000 local loan failed, how badly
no one has been allowed to know.
(2) A joint ( £500,000) in the tail of the
£3,000,000 loan was rechristened a Good Roads
Lean, being a scheme for repairing the highways
round Sydney at the cost of posterity—the posterity
of the whole State. This thing was on the market
twice at once, so to speak—once as its new self and
once as part of its old self. It failed also, for
closing time found less than £lOO,OOO subscribed,
and though it has decided to keep the list open for
another month, the effort lias now been abandoned
altogether.
(3) The whole loan which was supposed to shut in
triumph six months ago is left open indefinitely.
(4) Of the half-crown per bushel to be paid to
the wheat farmers in prompt cash no money has
eventuated. The thing is never mentioned now. It
is expected that the farmers will get their money
when the wheat is sold just as if there had never
been any guarantee and as if the crowd hadn’t
bragged its way to office on the false promise thereof.
(5) The State Housing business came to a sudden
stop one day for want of money while the Cabinet
was away inaugurating the new theological hen-
house at Balivdesert and telling the people what a
coruscating Cabinet it was.
(6) People from whom the helter-skelter Govern-
ment acquired land for farm settlement say bitterly
that they can get neither principal nor interest nor
a civil answer out of the empty Treasury.
(7) As regards those who have got on the land it is
said that it is often a case of putting inexperienced
heavily-mortgaged men on areas where their chances
are hopeless. The lighter kind of factory work might
have suited them better, but factory work is sur-
rounded by so many regulations and restrictions
that it is difficult to get them planted there. Cocka-
too Dock. Sydney, lately contained 41 unions working
under more than 300 awards.
(8) The distracted State Treasurer says that the
Commonwealth should lend N.S.W. more money and
if it doesn’t it is responsible for the worst that may
happen. (He also wanted it to find the money for
the Ministry’s wheat guarantee.) The Common-
wealth Treasurer replies in effect that he has more
than enough troubles of his own ; that he can’t save
every fool from his folly ; and that the State which
stands for 38 per cent, of the Commonwealth’s popu-
lation and has screwed out of its people nearly as
much revenue as the other States put together should
be above asking Tasmania and S. Aus. to back its
bill.
(9) 'riie Government's promise to pay the farmers
£500,000 to make up wheat losses, said to be due
to mismanagement of the Holman Government, has
dropped through a hole. No one eien dreams
about it now.
(10) While mislaying its old promises the Minis-
try made a lot of new ones. It is pledged to pension
all children after the first two in a family; also
orphans and widows generally.
(11) Finally there is the deficit.
It has been suggested that the State’s Minis-
try might make a retreat with at least mock
dignity by resigning as a stern protest
against the continued maltreatment of Ire-
land. A little over a year ago about 90
candidates of the party went to tin* poll on
the woes-of-Ireland ti<-ki*t, among other
matters. For weeks they made 90 speeches
a day about Ireland, except when things
became heated and then they made ISO.
The island helped them to office, and they
have done nothing at all in return —not even
given its cause 5 per cent, of the extra
salary they voted themselves. The last and
best use they could find for the place they
have made to serve so many purposes would
be to retreat under cover of it.

Garrett’s, Ltd., motor-car importers, etc.
(Sydney).—This co. has been in the motor-
car business for 13 years and is agent for
two well-known makes —F.I.A.T. and Over-
land, the latter agency acquired three years
ago. Early in its career Garrett’s had a
rough passage, and in the three years 1909-
11 it went more than £7OOO to the bad. The
concern was thereupon put under new
management and the tide turned. Then war
conditions, which might have been expected
to hamper the business, assisted it, and in
1917 a first div. of ss. per £.l share was dis-
tributed, earlier profits having gone to re-
trieve the bad start and to build up the con-
cern. Later, additional capital was got
in, and during the past year, to finance ex-
tensive works for body-building and repairs,
a lot of new ordinary capital was raised.
Including the £l6OO of 6 p.c. cum. prefs.
capital has moved in this way: 1917,
£20,552; 1918, £28,108; 1919, £40,893;
1920, £63,678; 1921, £93,121. Profits dis-
closed since the co. was put under new con-
trol have been as follows:
1913.. £3449 1916.. £7232 | 1919.. £7039
1914.. 1053 1917.. 5973 | 1920.. 9623
1915.. 4329 1918.. 7027 1 1921.. 9071
Over the four years 1917-20 regular 10 p.c.
divs. were paid the ordinaries; but for the
past year, though a profit of £9071 has been
disclosed, in view of “trade conditions” and
“heavy commitments” there is to be no dis-
tribution. Besides being committed to a
large outlay on the new works the co. has
been heavily overloaded with stocks, and
though the figures disclosed are as at January
31 last the directors’ report does not admit
any improvement since. Capital and re-
serves at the balance totalled £118,255; lia-
bilities amounted to no less than £173,827.

stocks.

That 0 p.c. div. means 1- p.c. to old co-opera-
tors, for during the year reserves equu! to
the old capital were transferred. In its 21
years the co. has been run differently from
most co-op. concerns: in the good years it
did not distribute all its profits, wherefore 12
months ago it had nearly £5001) more reserves
than its paid capital of £12,191. This policy
enabled it to extend its works and interests
without dipping deeply into shareholders’
pockets. Nevertheless, though capital and re-
serves now amount to £82,174, £54,426 has
been spent on buildings, machinery, etc.
(£15,440 has been struck off to cover depre-
ciation), so that it has to lean heavily on
outsiders, overdraft alone amounting to
£29,801 at the latest balance. Further de-
tails are given in this comparison :

Book debts 6,708 19,740 22,393
Cash and War Loan .. .. 5,221 5,224
Shares in other cos. .. .. 800 1,280
In 1910 there were net assets with a book
value of only £6010; at the latest balance,
£86,290. That improvement of £30,274 has
been effected with the assistance of only
£9326 of new share capital.
The latest profits show a big drop from those
of a year ago, and the directors offer no ex-
planation. After providing for the div. and
for taxes, and allowing £5OO for depreciation,
there was a surplus of £2410. But on this
occasion there is to be no bonus on consign-
ments, ‘‘owing to the stringent conditions pre-
vailing in the money markets and to the fact
that a large expenditure has been incurred
at the works in order to bring them into a
position to cope with the increase of busi-
ness.”
Melbourne accountants J. L. Donaldson
and W. T. Charge have produced an excellent
little guide to “The Proprietary Co. in Vic-
toria.” It explains, concisely, the provisions
of the Vie. Companies Act of 1915, the
advantages of registering under the Act. the
procedure from the commencement of flota-
tion to establishment, and details the duties
of secretaries. There is a comprehensive
index.
“Old Banker”: The contemplated new de-
sign for £1 Australian notes recalls the
extraordinary situation which arose in 1915
when the notes printer could not work his
plant at sufficient speed to supply the notes
which were being rushed out to meet war
expenditure, and also feed the States, which
had secured large loans from the Common-
wealth. The Treasury officials, spurred by
the Minister, tried to speed up the notes
printer, but he strongly opposed any issue
except on the specially prepared paper and
with the approved design. He was finally
over-ruled, and an emergency issue was de-
cided upon. The printer saw the possibilities
of forgery, as the printing paper and plant
to be used gave little or no protection, and
he refused to carry out the work without the
written authority of the Treasurer himself.
And the Treasurer, being merely a politician
and not an expert in lithography or any other
’graphy, gave the necessary instructions.
These “white” notes hadn’t been in the
hands of the public many months when the
Treasury began to get a headache, and soon
afterwards urgent wires were flashing to all
parts of the Commonwealth recalling the
whole lot.
“W’gabba” : The inaccessibility of the old
Normanby goldfield (Q.) undoubtedly affected
its development, but “a man on the spot”
(B. 16/6/’2l) forgets that most other
N.Q. fields were handicapped in the same
way; there were no railways in the North
in those days. Of course, the Towers was a
powerful magnet, for it was not possible to
get the quantity of gold from Normanby
lodes by simple amalgamation as was won
at the Towers, and other methods were not
then known. The “new” Normanby is cer-
tainly the most promising goldfield in
Queensland at present, but it would be mis-
leading if the public were made to think it is
so good that it might come up to one of the
fields mentioned in the par.

The recent mining award has temporarily
settled the prospects of the Great Victoria,
25 miles south of Southern Cross (W.A.).
The lode is a. huge proposition, over 1000 ft.
long by 100 ft. wide, but under present
working conditions profitable extraction is
out of the question.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“F.N.”: “Leo Lear” (B. IG/G/’2l) is cor-
rect—a snake refuses to be murdered by a motor-
car. Last summer when travelling in a five-seater
Buiek, fully loaded, and with brakes partially
applied, we went right over an old-man tiger. The
squeeze didn’t even stop him. Total weight of load,
exclusive of car, 8001 b.
HIS FATAL PASSION.
S POT: “Poor Darkey, he always was too
neat and tidy.”
GINGER: “Neat?”
SPOT: “Yeh; I suppose he saw a speck of
mud on the motor-wheel and tried to
bite it off.”
“Veracitus”: While holding no brief for
De Rougemont, I submit a few extenuations. At
least one of his yarns was 0.K.; and perhaps a few
others, when shorn of the “artistic touch,” had
foundation in fact. For instance, his “turtle ride”
was laughed at, yet while on a biological stunt to
Masthead Island (Q.), in company with a Uni.-prof,
and students. I had many a joy-ride astride some
hefty soup-mersibles. Once aboard it was only neces-
sary to keep one’s legs clear of the strongly-beating
flippers while bearing backward on the steed’s com-
modious roof-saddle to prevent him diving. The
giant green turtle’s movements on shore suggest a
solemn variant of the jazz, but he can move swiftly
through water, and only lagoon jaunts are possible.
Then isn’t it likely that De Rougemont’s “flight of
wombats” was his foreign conception or confusion
of the flight of large fruit-bats known by the mis-
leading name of “flying-foxes” ? Likewise might
not his “monstrous fish with enormous hairy head
and fierce moustache” be just a ziff dugong or sea-
cow, travelling on an ancient mariner’s ticket ?
» » * *
“Gecko”: “Leo Lear” (B. 16/6/’2l) asks
how snakes burrow. My experience is that they
simply take up the ready-made domiciles of pro-
bably “outed” or certainly ousted mice, lizards and
other earth-boring fauna. But can “L.L.” bear me
out here? Last spring a 4ft. black-backed, cream-
bingied female snake was wriggling away from me
when she suddenly threw a twister, formed eights
and tried to tie herself into a brace of granny-knots
and then just disappeared. I walked to the spot,
but failed to ascertain where she had gone, till fin-
ally I moved a small, dry and hard piece of bovine
manure and thus disclosed a hole. After replacing
the lid I noiselessly retired. Later I visited the
spot again, and found that the lid had been moved
to one side; but in the evening the door once again
covered the hole. Next day similar manoeuvring
was carried out by both parties concerned. On
the third day I made a call early, met the lady in
the grass, and saw her hurriedly enter the hole —
and replace the lid with a final semi-circular sweep
of her tail. Might not this account for the time-
worn dictum, “Take your eye off a snake and it
will disappear” ?
* * * *
“Mirza”: “Does a patient ever go to a
hospital in a humorous condition?” Here’s one
from our ward. He had an abdomen full of fluid,
and, as it looked as though he had had similar
trouble previously, the honorary asked him if he
had ever been tapped. “Twice,” growled the new-
comer. “Did they get much out of you?” “Fifty
bob and a quid,” said the victim.
• * • *
“Woboy” : I can go one better than “Adel-
aide” (B. 26/5/’2l) with a high-jumping sheep. He
had been picked out for the butcher, and was in
a horseyard when a couple of kelpie pups started
chasing him. The sheep only went round the yard
twice; then, selecting the lowest part of the fence
where the top rail had been knocked out, he took a
short run and cleared it. I measured the fence, and
it was Oft. 3in. We put the jumper at it again
twice, but each time he touched.
• » « •
“Orara”: In his reference to rope made
from kurrajong bark “Steve Hurt” (B. 20/5/’2l)
has confused the tree which grows along the coastal
belt of N.S.W. with the larger kurrajong of the
western districts. He mentions that the leaves
arc “useful for feed for stock,” hut that is only true
as regards the western tree. Though the coastal
kurrajong never grows to any great size “5.11.” is
right about its value for rope-making. When a boy,
while living in the Orara district (N.S.W.), I
made some string from this fibre. I still have it
and although over 80 years old it is us strong
as it was the day it was made. I will back it
aganist any other string as regards both pliability
and strength.
“Boomerang”; “Leo Lear’s” statement (B.
16/6/’2l) that a snake cannot be killed by being
run over by a motor-car is absurd. Last month
while crossing the plains from Broken Hill to Men-
indie we ran over a black snake, and the next instant
the wriggler landed in the Inn of an occupant
of the back-seat. He nearly jumped the Darling; but
the snake was dead, its back broken iri several places,
in January the Wentworth (N.S.W.) police magis-
trate had a similar experience.
“Delhi”: Reports that aeroplane pro-
pellers are being manufactured from Australian rose-
wood are encouraging. Hitherto practically no use
has been made of it, splendid timber though it is.
Here on the Dorrigo (N.S.W.)
sawmillers will not handle it, as
they say there is no sale for it,
so it has to be destroyed by fire.
A Yankee visitor, when shown the
rosewood and told there was no
sale for it, gasped. If it grew in
the States, he said, it would be
eagerly sought by furniture-manu-
facturers.
“Sir Spen”: Circumstances can make a
deuce of a difference. The other day I heard a bush
youngster ask his cobber: “What does yer muvver
call that dawg, Bill?” Whereupon Bill: “How d’yer
mean—when she’s callin’ ’im ’ome or w’en she’s
’untin’ ’im out?”
* * # *
“Riom”: I nominate a wether owned by
O. H. Fulmer, of Goulburn (N.S.W.), for the heavy-
sheep stakes. Live weight, 3121 b., off shears. He
has been growing for three years. His owner gives
as one reason for his size a penchant for chewing
tobacco.
* * * *
“Aragun” : Can any Abo. writer produce
a bald-headed Binghi? Not a Yankee nigger or a
half-caste, but a dinkum full-blooded Aussie. I’ve
never struck one and every black I’ve asked has
given me a negative answer. B. E. Minns occasion-
ally omits to thatch him. Whaffor?
*‘» * *
“Wynfrith Revell”; The kaka vine in
Polynesia is a fine reservoir. A section, perhaps
2ft. long, as thick as your
wrist, when cut at both ends
will provide a small cupful
of clear water. If you cut
the section only at one end
it won’t turn on the tap.
Missionary Chalmers is said
to have imported the vine in
case of drought; but it is
now a pest, over-running the
virgin bush. As it may be
as thick at the base as a
man’s bodjq it makes clearing
an expensive and dangerous job.
“Hokum”: A motor-car driven over a
snake will rarely break his spine, but he will die of
the injury all the same. If “Leo Lear” (B. 16/6/’2l)
revisits the vicinity of his reptile’s accident about
four days later (less in Q.), he will be assailed by
a smell like that of a wheat pool.
* * * *
“New Chum”: I’m in the bush, and we
kill our own mutton. The pelt is of practically no
comfnercial value at present; but if it .were tanned
it could be put to domestic use. How would I set
about the job?
“Siloai”: The peculiar behavior of vessels
mentioned by “Te Babarantiko (B. 16/6/’2l) is not
limited to craft overtaking one another at low
speeds. Let him float two wooden matches in water,
taking care to thoroughly wet them, and he will
find one attracts the other. The action is purely
one of surface tension. The surface of a liquid
behaves as though it were covered with a film in
a state of tension, tending to reduce the surface
area. Hence, between the boats we have a liquid
film behaving as would a stretched piece of sheet-
rubber, and consequently the boats draw together.
Bodies completely immersed show no such attraction.
MAKING A LITTLE BOSS GO A LONG WAY.
JACKY : “ Gir-um shillun, mister Big alligator eat-ern loss belonga poor Hack feller.”
PARSON : “Oh, too had, too had! Here’s a shilling, Jacky. When did the alligator eat
your loss?”
J ACKY: “ Close-up ten year now.”
With regard to boats the effect would be extremely
small, and in seas at all ruffled it would be negli-
gible. The collisions “Te B.” mentions are pro-
bably due to the same reason that a boy learning
to ride a bicycle invariably steers into the nearest
tree or post. ,
“Mag”: There are pig freaks, too. In a
truck that passed through Maryborough (Q.) the
other day was one possessing the qualifications of
both sexes.
» * * *
“Country Drummer”: Allow me to join in
the chorus of scorn about the Wauchope kitten-
bunny. I spent a day there lately, and, although I
didn’t see it myself, I spoke to several who had.
They agreed that it was an ordinary puss, born with
a deformity. The hind legs were immovable at the
joints, consequently Tabby’s gait gtive her the
appearance of a rabbit.
* * * *
“Melos”When I read the remarks made
by “Bill Lannigan” (B. 26/5/’2l), old Jim Comers
remarked: “IVell, he’s a silly cow. I had a gammy
leg 42 years ago. an’ goanna ile cured it. I was
a bit skeered of th’ stuff fer awhile, because a bloke
told me it would rot me leg off ; so I gits some bones
an’ puts ’em in a bottle with th’ ile for six munce.
When th’ bones came out as fresh as a daisy,
‘That’s good enough fer me,’ I says; and I went
ahead.”
TROUBLE WITH THE ORCHESTRA.
“Music is a great enlivener, so why not have a
musical accompaniment to work —perhaps only a
gramophone, or perhaps a band? Several London
firms have installed gramophones in the work-rooms
of their factories.” —Sydney Telegraph.
UP-TO-DATE DAIRYMAN : “Here, cut out the
home-and-mother stuff, or I’ll he get-tin ’
lined for waterin’ the milk!”
“Mirza”: Mention of anthrax (B.
16/6/’2l) reminds me of an exceedingly severe case
that occurred in Mesopotamia. On admission to hos-
pital the patient was in a bad way, temperature
106, pulse 135, and the four M.O.’s thought they
would sign his death certificate within 24 hours.
Ten hours later a supply of “Sclavo’s serum” came
to hand, and the case was treated with it. 'lhat
evening the patient was reading a book, feeling O.K.
The use of this serum has reduced the mortality
from 60 p.c. to 5 p.e. It is now being produced at
the Commonwealth Laboratory.
•* * * *
“Saaedi”: “Hurra’s” instance of a calf's
vitality (B. 9/6/’2l) fails to impress me. Towards
the close of the recent drought I moved 30 head of
cattle from one paddock to another about two miles
distant. Included in the mob were three cows that
had recently calved, but I failed to notice this fact.
Eleven days later a neighbor told me he had seen
three calves standing together in a dense scrub in the
paddock from which I had moved the cattle. By
this time the cows were easily picked out of the mob,
and I started them back. At first they displayed
little interest in the proceedings, but when about
a mile from their calves memory or instinct or
whatever you like awakened, and they made a bee-
line to where the infants were patiently waiting their
return, apparently in the best of health and spirits,
despite their 11 days’ absence from mother.
* * * *
“Alex.”: “Aragun” says (B. 30/6/’2l)
that most meatworks take advantage of cattle’s
disinclination to stand on a hillside by raising the
killing-pen four or five feet above the yard-level.
Yes; but it doesn’t make much difference. At the
Merinda (N.Q.) meatworks I have seen thousands of
cattle killed. An electric “torch,” carrying a good
dose of hurry up, had to be applied to the stern
post of every bullock to make him face the man
with the knocking hammer. And Merinda had a
slope up.
* * * »
“Destiny”: I can support “Jim Carew”
(B. 9/6/’2l) about ground-nesters taking to heights
cn account of foxes. I recently came across a plain
turkey’s egg, laid in a stump, about 4ft. from the
ground. The tree had been burnt off, leaving a
stump 4ft. in diameter, with a very slight hollow'
which had filled with fallen leaves, etc., and here
ma had deposited her egg!.
“Semaj Eroom”: Re “Rainbow’s” hare-
and-eagle stunt (B. 2/6/’2l). Puss must have been
out for jokes if the eagle settled on the ground in
front of her six times in a vain attempt to stop her
from going home to her hubby. If puss was out to
win she could do the distance and stop to feed while
old Wedgey was getting up high enough to have No.
2 sweep —or swoop, whichever you like to call it.
(Continued on page 26).
THE DEAD TRIBE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Here they dwelt of old,
Breathed and had their being.
Yon gleams the spindrift.
Down the distance fleeing.
Hither came the Spring,
Flower and frond bestowing;
Bed dawn and gold noon
On their vision glowing.
Came the reaper, Death,
Hither, thither, reaping;
Pale dust in lone graves,
Lie they all a-sleeping.
Creeping slow and sure,
Thus did doom befall them.
Ti-trec and gaunt gum,
Do ye ne’er recall them?
Wherefore they were born
Wo shall know in season —•
Know that for all things
God hath rhyme and reason.
Faded are their fires,
Vanished ush and ember.
Lone dune and grey cliff.
Do ye still remember ?

“Monaro”: My nom. for the Reference-
brevity Stakes beats “Jim Carew’s” (B. 30/6/’2l).
It is simply “Try- him.” Among a bunch of papers
proudly exhibited by a Cowra (N.S.W.) abo. 1 came
across one that read “Blast him.” The most definite
testimonial I ever saw ran: “A damn good man.”
And he was. But the best reference I’ve known
weighed 13st. 41b. “I’m my own blanky reference,”
said its owner, a blacksmith. “Give me an hour's
work and we’ll have a talk.”
“Jim Carew” : Contrary to the usual idea
the wild duck seldom if ever nests near water.
I was once fishing on the Lower Macquarie when I
saw an old black bird arrive carrying a young one,
holding the top of its wing in her bill. She entered
the water, and after swimming round for a few
minutes left the youngster near a reed-bed and
flew away, returning in about half-an-hour with
another young one. She made in all seven trips.
Taking into consideration the rate a black duck
flies, it was easy to get a line on the distance the
r.est was away from the water. It certainly was
mile?,.
* * * *
“Aristide”: Concerning “Lofty’s” par (B.
2/6/’2l) re an epidemic among the horses of West-
ern Bananaland. The disease is common in the
Northern Territory. There we call it the walk-
abouts, because an animal once affected will make
immediately for the nearest human habitation and
walk round and round the camp until exhausted,
when it will cast in its alley (if you’re not careful)
right alongside your mosquito-net. In >he early
stages the horse exhibits the same symptoms as one
afflicted badly with worms; then follows a rapid
falling-off of condition, ending in collapse. If taken
early the disease can be checked by severe drench-
ing; but after that it’s as hopeless as an English
cricket team.
“Hobble Chain”: “Jim Carew” (B.
19/5/’2l) asks for the name of a good buckjump
rider who successfully followed his occupation after
be had reached middle age. Lance S'kuthorpe is 51.
* * * *
“Hamer”: A sort of record canine litter
has been produced by a kangaroo-hitch at Never-
tire (N.S.AV.). This lady dog brought into the world
10 pups at one birth, and no two were alike in
markings.
# * * *
“Werac”: “Mag” (B. 9/(J/’2l) is a long
way out when he says no animal in the wild state
can rear more young than she has teats. On the
South Coast (N.S.AV.) I once found a dingo litter
of nine pups hidden in a log, and managed to shoot
the mother. She had only six teats, yet all the pups
were fat and healthy. Another time I found a field
mouse’s nest containing 27 j'oung ’tins; and I’ll
swear the lady of the house couldn’t accommodate
that many' at once.
“Eddyson”: Carter was in a measure re-
sponsible for AViley’s death, although the coroner
absolved him, and he left the court without a stain
on his escutcheon. It was Carter loosed the log
that rolled upon AViley; but it was Carter’s duty
’to loose the log, and Wiley had no business to be
in the way. However, Carter seemed to find some-
thing expected of him, and went courting AViley’s
widow. Eventually he married her, and in due
course we had the reason lucidly explained in
Hinde’s bar-parlor. “You see, Jimmie Wiley's
ghost was always at me,” Carter said. “He come
to my bed night after night, and his yarn was
always how I ought to marry the poor widow.
AVell, as you know, I married her. I thought it
was pity set Wiley hauntin’ me. But I was mis-
took.” Here Carter pounded the table-with all the
strength of his hard right hand. “It was d —d,
dirty revenge!”
DESERVING CASES.
’O RACE: “'Ullo, 'Erbert, they're going to in-
sure against drought
’ERBERT: “Now, that's statesmanship. I
wish they'd taken out a policy for me
when I was a kid.”
“Aussie-ite”: “Merlin” and “Exul” (B.
16/6/’2l) notwithstanding, cats and rabbits do inter-
breed. Some years ago the M.L. Government intro-
duced cats into the rabbit-infested areas in the hope
0 f eradicating the pest, and the rabbits not only
increased in numbers, but hybrids were also found,
Shooting near Deniliquin (N.S.W.) last j’ear I saw
cat disappear into a warren with some rabbits,
l came back a little later, and shot what I took
THE ILL-TREATED WOMAN.
THE WOMAN: “Help! Murder !”
BREATHLESS STRANGER (arrived to give assistance) : “Why docs your mother call out
like that when your father's trying to get away?"
THE KID : “Oh, she wants someone to help catch dad so's she can murder him!"
to be a rabbit. The cat was again in the open when
I fired, but immediatety made for the warren. The
tiling I shot had a head more like a cat’s than a
rabbit’s, and the ears were fairly short. The hind-
quarters were certainly those of a rabbit. That con-
vinced me. A family near Glen Innes (N.S.W.)
have a domesticated cat-rabbit, which will eat either
grass or meat. It is similar in form to the one I
shot.
“Te Whare”: The wobbegong, or carpet
shark, first turned up in Sydney Cove. One was
caught by Lieut. Watts (of Governor Phillip's staff)
in 1788. The spotted monster was hauled on board
a vessel, lay quiet for over two hours, and then
seized a dog which incautiously sniffed at its head.
It was christened Watt’s shark. Some of Phil-
lip’s people, too, first caught the bull-head, known
then and ever since an the Port Jackson shark, and
by scientists labelled Ileterodontus phillipi in mem-
ory of the old Governor. That lying treacherously
quiet when caught is a habit of the wobbegong. In
one instance an abo. fisherman rashly put his
fingers into the mouth of one to extract the hook,
and the awful incurved teeth immediately closed on
them. Binghi never lost his presence of mind.
“Wait a bit,” he said. “Him open mouth by-em-
by.” The shark presently did so, and Binghi jerked
the gory fingers out, explaining afterwards that if
the wobbegong had been interfered with it would
have snapped its jaws and torn his fingers clean off.

“The Librarian”: For the first time since
I established my lending library in Melbourne (and
it is now an institution of ten years’ standing)
a new patron the other day took out the Bible on
the customary terms, value down, and 3d. charged
for the reading. He had come in asking for “The
Book of Job.” He looked like a person fresh from
Toodlembuck as I ran a puzzled eye over him.
“The Book of Job?” said I. “I haven’t it sepa-
rately, but you'll find it in the Bible.” “Gimme
one, and show me where,” said the caller. I pointed
out of the Book of Job, and my new customer took
Hie Bible out. He returned it on the third da.v.
“When was that writ?” said he. I explained that
it was about 2000 years since it was first put upon
the market. “I s'pose an old chap name of Job up
at the Slip couldn’t have writ it?” I didn’t think
it at all likely. “I always told the missus Job was
a. liar,” said the new customer. He went away, but
about a week later I received a letter from the
Slip. It assured me that Horis Job, livin’ there,
did write the book, and what’s m6re said he’d do it
again if any city bloke disbelieved him.

“Bill Bowyang”: A merry-go-round visited
our township last week, and Mrs. Jumbuck offered
to treat Maggie to a ride. “No, by cripes, Missus,”
said Maggie. “One time alonga Mac-kay me bin see
Billy Barlow spendit five thillin’ ridin’ that fellow
wooden yarranian, and ebbery time it bin stop he
bin get off alonga same place he bin get on ; and I
bin say alonga him: ‘By cripes, Billy, you plurry
fool, you spendit all your money, but where you
bin ?’ ”
“Iola”: Papuan magistrate Richard Hum-
phreys, having completed his book down
south, returned and led an expedition of American
journalists into the mountain districts north and
east of Mt. Yule. One of the interesting discoveries
claimed by the expedition is a group of wild moun-
taineers who keep family virtues in the family- by
eating the bodies of their dead relatives. Tire prac-
tice will cause a mild sensation in ethnological
circles, since it is a method of burial not hitherto
noted in New Guinea ; and it will also set in
motion the legal minds of the Territory, for the
present law controlling cannibalism was not intended
to suppress religious manifestations of this kind.

“Monaro”: In Chinchilla (Q.) in 3912
I saw a horse sold for “a pound a pull.” Yoked
to a substantial sapling, 36 times did that animal
put forth the best that was in him, and that wasn’t
the end. But his owner capitulated. “To tell you
the God’s truth,” he remarked, “I’ve been so inter-
ested I forgot myself. He’s yours for 36 on one
condition—not another pull 1 ”
“Bill R.” : I discovered the best method
of sweetening a foul pipe when l left mine on the
farthest corner-post of the back paddock. When 1
called round for him a week later alternate frosts
and sunshine had drawn every drop of nicotine from
the wood. Since then he has undergone several such
exposures, and always with the same renovating
effect.
“Peter Pan” : At a friend’s house lives an
Australian terrier bitch, and last week a kitten was
introduced into the family circle. At once the
tender became strongly attached to the kitten, and
commenced to care for and mother it as though it
were her own puppy, and she is now suckling it. It’s
the first case of the kind I've heard of.

“Te Pana” on the artlessness of Brown
Brother:—-
Lei was run by a native king, ruled by a native
council and kicked in the shins by a native Depart-
ment of Justice. Lei was rather a joke to the
outside world, and that is why Cartwright, South
Sea Island trader, decided to set up a store on
its coral beach. He had arrived a month ago, and
was still waiting for the schooner from Sydney with
his trade goods. Consequently, the shelves of the
store being empty, he had not yet taken out a
trader’s license.
Sitting on the verandah, bashing at mosquitoes,
Cartwright was interrupted by the appearance of
a native boy who held out a bundle of smelly fish.
“Malolelei!” greeted the youth. “A present to
you, Katilight, from the king.”
Cartwright sniffed. “No,” he grunted.
“But you take them,” answered the bearer, “or
the king will be offended.”
“I don’t eat fish,” snapped the trader. “Take
’em away.”
Another boy. who had idled along to hear the
conversation, stepped up.
“Can I have them, Katilight?” he asked.
“Yes, yes. Take ’em and get out of this.”
Next day a native policeman waited on Cartwright
and demanded a dollar (Chile) for the fish he had
purchased yesterday. Cartwright was surprised. In
fluent Australian mixed with choicest vernacular, he
said so.
“But,” replied the dusky official, “you told the
boy Fini he could have the fish the king sent you.
So it is just the same as if you had taken them
yourself. One dollar, please.”
Cartwright wanted to remain friends with the
nat’ve potenate, and parted.
Next Sunday he went to church on purpose to
have a heart-to-heart talk with the king after the
show. Naturally his Majesty, pleading it was all
a mistake, offered Cartwright back the dollar. This
toned down the trader’s wrath, and, thinking he
hgd maligned the king, he showed reluctance in
accepting the money.
“All right, Katilight,” assented the royal one.
“You keep the money and I’ll call at the store
and get a tin of beef for it. That will make us
square.”
“Sorry,” replied the trader, “but I can’t sell you
any meat till the schooner gets here. If a tin
of salmon would do”—
It would.
Early Monday morning two native policemen
appeared on the scene with a summons for Cart-
wright to immediately appear before the Court.
“Katilight,” queried the magistrate, “why did you
trade on Sunday?”
“I did not,” was the reply.
“You sold the king one tin salmon for one dollar.”
“But that was my own money,” parried the
trader. “The salmon was a gift.”
“When the king offered you the dollar did you
not refuse to accept it?”
“Yes, but” ———
“Consequently the dollar was his property, and
when he gave it to you in payment for the salmon
you traded on Sunday. Ten dollars fine.”
As Cartwright turned to leave he was called back.
“B.v the way. Katilight, where is your trading
license?”
“I’m not trading jet,” replied the victim.
“Oh yes, you are. Yesterday you traded a tin of
salmon with the king. Twenty dollars fine for
trading without a license.”

“Pongo”: Allow me to tell “Merlin” and
“Exul” (B. 16/6/’2l), who sneer at the idea of
a rabbo-cat hybrid, that 30 years back at Pad-
dington, Sydney, a contractor owned a monkey ami
a cut who contracted a mesalliance , the result
being a litter (four, l think) of Jacko-kittens wearing
monkey’s heads and tails, but all cat amidships.
They weren’t allowed to live long, but many old
Paddingtonians remember the incident, and the man
who owned the animals is still in the suburb.

“Riom”: A local man lately took his
fourth wife, this venture being with a widow. The
wedding invitations concluded with: “Come along,
this is no amateur performance.”
“Chakagigi”: Civil rule is now operating
in the Pacific territories lately held by Germany,
and the world is waiting to see how Australia will
carry on the reputation for handling savage races
won for her by the district officers of Papua, only
one of whom has a place on the staff in ex-German
New Guinea. The policy of Australia, as set out
by Governor Murray, is one which leads the canni-
bal gently from the Stone Age to civilization with-
out injury to him. I n Papua that policy is guided
by two anthropologists, Strong and Armstrong, and
operated by a staff of district officers with long
experience in administrative worrk. In the late
German territory the process of “leading gently”
will be infinitely more difficult because relatively
little of its inland population is under control, and
the staff, excepting a few excellent officers who
served during the military administration, is prac-
tically untrained and without experience in handling
“STRUTH, BILL, WHAT IF 'E LOST
HIS NERVE!”
savages. As an example of what comes before a
district officer for adjustment take this custom from
the Markham River neighborhood: “On the death
cf her husband a widow has herself shaved, and,
when dressed in her best clothes and ornaments,
requests' her friends to strangle her and lay her
alongside the dead body of her husband so that Oie
can accompany him in the land of the dead where
things are as they are here. Fearful of the wrath
of the husband’s ghost if they deprive him of the
company of his widow, they do as she requests and
then make presents to her family. It is not re-
corded that any husband has followed his wife in
this way.” A tough problem to put before a young
man just up from the South! It should be intense-
ly interesting to watch him trying to break the
Markham River natives of this ancient practice.

Motorists all know what this means: A pleasant
outing, no mechanical troubles, no roadside de-
lays for tyre repairs. Many enjoy this experi-
ence month after month, others always appear
to be in trouble—and in most instances they
have only themselves to blame. It does not
matter what the car is, nor how much it cost;
constant care and attention are essential to the
“good run” habit. Again, what an important
part the tyres play in this connection. Some
motorists are careless as regards the tyres
used, and have an unsatisfactory experience.
WITH DEPENDABLE “RAILROAD”
DUNLOP TYR
fitted, one can be sure of many months of
pleasant motoring, free of tyre troubles.
All you have to do is to see that they are kept
properly inflated, and it’s amazing how
the thousands of miles add up before your
“Railroads” show any material signs of wear.
They do not chip or cut, their fine quality with-
standing the hardest driving; and as regards
value—they have no equal. The day you fit
“Railroads” you ensure tyre satisfaction and
economy, and at lower initial cost than any im-
ported tyre. Why not enjoy “Railroad” service?

deftly sketched the comforts which were
already secured for them by the success of
the strike. All the meeting listened, while
you could have heard the proverbial pin drop,
and in his final exhortation the vote was car-
ried. Then the Irish crowded up to get a
chance of touching his Eminence’s dress.
Several times I called to see him during
the year, and before I came to Australia in
1890 he asked me if I had any friends there.
I said that I knew no one in Australia. He
said that he would give me something which
would find me friends if I ever wanted any.
Producing a cheap little copy of “The Gar-
den of the Soul,” he wrote in it my name
and the date (July 3, 1890), and signed
with his initials, “H.E., C.A.” Said he:
“Whenever you need help, show that to any
Roman Catholic and he will help you.” I
did show it to the late Archbishop of Mel-
bourne and he at once said “What can I do
for you?” but I did not require any help.
It is undoubtedly true that the views of
Cardinal Newman and of Manning were
antagonistic, and that Newman was harshly
dealt with. But was not Manning, from his
point of view, obliged to act harshly? New-
man had a brother, Professor Newman, a
man of great ability and an agnostic. I
went once to call upon him and met Arthur
Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer with Dar-
win of the idea that even the most able man
is the descendant of an ape. This gentle
professor imbibed a plate of lentil soup dur-
ing my stay and styled his brother the Car-
dinal “a perfect ass.” Anybody charged with
the welfare of the Roman Catholic church
during the close of the last century might
perhaps have been pardoned for being a
little hasty with the author of “Lead, Kindly
Light,” beautiful though it be.
H. H. CHAMPOIN.
And After That?
When the pretty, demure little miss with
the outlook of Queen Victoria and the ex-
perience of a cloistered maiden-aunt is wooed
and won by the large, brutal, silent, ill-
educated but very noble man, the novelist
rings down the curtain on what is really
only the first act of a drama. The fault of
most modern n.ovels is that they have no
ending that can satisfy an imaginative
leader. The tale is only beginning, but
the novelist is sufficiently tired of his own
theme; and the royalties on sales will be
about the same whether he puts some
honest work into the conclusion or lets it
go with an unlikely kissing incident by
way of full stop. For the young woman
whose anxiety to marry glamorously is the
mainstay of the best-seller a long-drawn out,
rapturous, picture-show kiss may no doubt be
sufficient ending for any book; but to the
reader who tries to see the persons of a
story as living characters, that final flop
is strangely disquieting.
The writer of books of mere incident often
worries his readers by leaving his people
in a mess which would require several more
volumes to clear up; but he, too, uses the
kiss at the end of eighty thousand words as
sufficient excuse for taking his work to
market. One pair of lovers—a beautiful
Japanese girl and an English clerk from a
China treaty-port—were recently left in the
mountains of Japan under circumstances
that called for remonstrance. The man had
only a few pounds, had lost his passport and
had no business prospects; the girl had been
stripped of nearly all her clothes; between
them they had cut the head off an important
official of the Japanese Imperial Court in
the presence of a number of witnesses. Only
a real humorist could have handled such a
situation; but the writer, oblivious of the
mountain wind that whistled round the bare
legs of his heroine, just set the happy pair
kissing, and mentioned that afterwards there
were some charming half-caste children. The
absurdity of such a conclusion is in no way
greater than the ending of many books of
higher pretension.
. Ey e n the big novelists often make a sorry
0 » tkeir last pages. Thomas Hardy, in
"Tess,” after the shocking melodrama of
the murder, ended with the suggestion that
the broken-hearted lover was alreadv making
good with the younger sister of the woman
who had just been hanged ; and as the black
flag fluttered on the tower of the gaol the
reader got up and kicked the book three
times round the room. Yet there is nothing
unsatisfactory about the last words of “Pen-
dennis,” “The Tale of Two Cities” or “The
Egoist.” The really big things cam. end in
almost any way the author likes, dfid still
make the reader feel that the tale is told.
Telling the tale is everything; and nine-
tenths of the skill in telling it lies in mak-
ing the reader thoroughly know a group of
human creatures worth knowing. A plot
counts for everything in the fiction of mere
incident; it is of very great importance in
the novel of middle flight; in the big novel it
can afford to be insignificant. “The Cloister
and the Hearth” has no plot in any strict
sense: “Vanity Fair” has none. “Oliver
Twist” has, and needs, a good deal of plot •
“The Bloodstain on the Milk-Jug” is ali
plot.
A novel dependent on a plot must finish
that plot in a satisfactory way; a novel
deoendent on the painting of character is
fairly enough finished when all the char-
acters are fully developed. But the author
whose novel depends on plot is usuallv a
wretched plot-maker; for the man Who
cannot see the really interesting side of
men and women in the interplay of their
character is hardly likely to evolve a con-
vincing human story at all. It is specially
to this person that the gods have granted the
crowning mercy of the fictional kiss. While
the world is male and female, and the voung
female has most time on her hands, the pos-
sibility of ending on that kiss will keep men
and women writing for cash —men and
women who by true vocation should be
ploughing or knitting socks.
But afterwards? Consider what a hell of
imagination these writers have created!
Follow their lovers out into the fields of
bread-and-butter endeavor. Nothing that
Dante ever pictured or Virgil saw in Tar-
tarus could compare with the frank meeting
0 n wo ozen P a i rs of lovers from the best-
sellers 10 years after the inconclusive kiss.
P. O. M.
The Birth of Advertising
It is not easy to imagine a \yprld without
advertisements, yet advertising in the modern
sense is a tool of very recent invention. It
is not yet three centuries since the first timid
movement towards it was made in England ;
and those responsible would certainly have
received a horrible shock if the idea of such
a phenomenon as the S. M. Herald, with
some half-dozen columns of advts to one of
' a( * en t ere d their minds. On February
I, Ib-o, a solitary advt. appeared in the Cor-
ant°, °r news-sheet, published at London,
for Mercurius Britannicus.” This sheet,
started the year before by John Chamber-
lain, had been coming out somewhat irregu-
larly, but the new departure was too much
rnu- no f ur ther numbers appeared,
-this may be accounted for by the subject
ot the advt., a book with the title of “Epi-
thalamium Gallo-Britannicum” and about a
quarter of a column more. It was 22 years
before another advt. in the same medium
appeared. In 1047 one Henry Walker, who
had been a schoolmaster, an ironmonger,
a parson and divers other things, was run-
ning a weekly news-sheet called Perfect
Occurrences in London. In his issue of
April 2 he shoved in an advt. of a book
about the divine right of church govern-
ment. The idea caught on and advts. soon
appeared in most of the news-books of the
time. The charge was sixpence for each
advt., equal to about 2s. fid. to-day. The
things advertised were mostly books, quack
medicines, runaway servants and apprentices
and things lost or stolen—mostly horses.
Ihe word “advertisement” was not invented
till about 1660; before that “advice” was
mostly used, though an advt. was some-
times called “siquis,” from the form with
which “hue and cry” announcements com-
menced. Ipcredible as it may seem, it is
alleged that the publishers of news-books
did not desire too many advts. lest they
should be accused of “bombasting it out.”
But in 1657 there was a new development
anticipating the modern use of trade cata-
logues, free advertisement-sheets and the like.
In that year there was issued a “Book of
Intelligence in Print,” consisting entirely
of advts. This publication, the “Publick
Adviser,” was not free, however, but was
sold at a penny. It met an early death, and
after that advertisers fell back again on the
news-books,” the forerunners of the real
newspapers which were soon to come into
existence.
DONALBAIN.
A Satchel of Books
They Did it, by Gerald O’Donovan (Methuen).
The story is obscured by matter of a not particularly
bright kind dealing with English war-muddling.
As a satire it moves too heavily.
The Root of All Evil, by J. S. Fletcher (Hodder
and Stoughton). One girl went after money and
clidn t get it; the other didn’t worry over wealth and
got some suitable babies. The characters are well
enough drawn, but not particularly interesting.
An Australian Rip Van Winkle, by William Hay
(Allen and Unwin) This is in the style of Washing-
rmt yvmg s Sketch Book,” though the resemblance is
not veiy close. There is plenty of color and interest-
lng matter on a variety of subjects, but the author’s
reading h JS sentences makes rather difficult
ty Ernest Poole (Macmillan). A well-
wntten book, but a little overloaded. The story
seems to be subsidiary to the purpose. There is a
good dea! about Russia and many of the scenes live?
Ire hlin e ri ral nT,H all is tllat the nations
ae lnd and that sight is only coming to them
by slow and painful experience. The people in the
book are-convincing and the color is always good!
The Breaking Fufirow, by Mary E. Fullerton
(Sydney 3. Endacott). Though here and there the
faThea?ilv qUa Th y e’ ° f the and
tail heavily. The author appears to have a nerfectlv
good verse sense, but has been at very little pains
Always the method chosen fe the easiest;and P Very
eldom is a quatrain allowed more than two
rhymes. Sometimes, as when the second line ends
in beneath and the fourth in “death,” there are
no rhymes at all in a stanza. But the chief fault
clusfon Here is the con-
rough h^ndliS 6 :- , ade ’ a fine thought s P° iled *>y
“Forth from the earth
Living it rose,
I saw it come forth—
The bulb’s conscious nose.
“I thought it winter
By nip and by sting ;
She without science
Knew it was spring.”
Far worse than that is the flop into bathos at the
end of “The Slaughterman’s Child.” The slaughter-
man comes home and, instead of killing his child
with a cleaver on the garden path,
“He is free of the shambles—-a father,
No butcher enfolds her.
Thank God that we, who condemn him
To violence and thunder,
Have only disfigured the surface,
And not the man under.”
What on earth is it like to be condemned to thunder 0
The author knew well enough that it could mean
nothing, but cheerfully destroyed the verse to save
the trouble of rewriting four undistinguished lines.
Lhe lack of craftsmanship or the unwillingness to
use it is to be greatly regretted, because there is
excellent material m the book. Even in the verv
fine opening poem, “Eclipse from a Range,” there
is the nerve-shattering line “ ’Tis like when Christ
died . Here is a little thing called “Ministry”
W jj}. in itself goes far to show both the strength
and the weakness to be found in the volume:
A blank wall made beautiful
For those who come
With the exuberant blues
Of my delphinium.
“A rough hut made beautiful,
Where quiet folks dwell,
By the delphinium-blue
Eves of young Annabel.
“A man's life made beautiful
By those same eves,
That are of no land or place
Except of Paradise.”
But this is perfect in its way:—
“Young John, the postman, dav bv dav
In sunshine or in rain, *
Comes down our road with words of doom
In envelopes of pain.
“What cares he as he swings along
At his mechanic part
How many times his hand lets fall
The knocker on a heart?”
Yellow Death, by Uel Key (Books, Ltd.). An-
other story inspired by Sherlock Holmes and the
current mild outbreak of spiritualism. But it, is
done clumrilv, written by an apprentice at the
business, punctuated weirdly and, like so many
books oi tne last year or two, printed carelessly. It
has nothing to recommend it.
Fips from Thistles, by Isabrl M. Peacock (Ward
Lock). A capitally told yarn which holds the
interest well. The girl has been brought up by
J' ] ch relations, but comes home to her mother’s
boarding-house when that lady hurts her spine. In-
stead of being a failure she takes hold of things and
makes the hash-establishment a model of its kind.
Then she marries one of the boarders—an ex-forger
who proves to be a man.
The Old Mans youth, bv William de Morgan
(Ileinemann). This is the last of the de Morgan
books which were left unfinished at his death. Large
gaps have been filled up by his wife; and th»
editing has been very well done. The yarn probably
contains a lot of autobiography. It is garrulous
in a charming way, and the reader will forgive the
long-windedness for the sparkle of the detailed
observation that in a worse writer might make the
story tedious. The main plot is slight, but there are
many sub-plots and the characters are splendidly
drawn.
The Inky Way
“Pollio”: The “Satchel of Books” ma.n (B.
16/6/’2l) talks of Stephen Leacock as “the most
humorous of modern professors.” Not so, kind sir!
Leacock would be a very commonplace humorist if he
were not a don also. He appeals to the crowd just
because he is one of the crowd, bored stiff with his
commonplace job and looking for relaxation in com-
monplace comic stuff outside his job. He is just
the “tired business man” running a Pollies show
instead of merely looking at it. Put him against
J. C. Squire, and see him shrink and dwindle. For
my part I back the professor (or business man or
journalist or any other sort of man) who masters
his job instead of escaping from it, and gets out of
it all the humor there is. And I nominate for the
humorous-professor belt one A. E. Housman, once the
Shropshire Lad,” and later a classical don at Lon-
don and Cambridge. There is more humor, coupled
with a mordant and exuberant wit, in two of his
prefaces to classical textbooks than in all Leacock’s
volumes ; and it is got out of his own subject. E.g. :
“An editor of no judgment, perpetually confronted
with a couple of manuscripts to choose from, cannot
but feel in every fibre of his being that he is a
donkey between two bundles of hay. What shall he
do now? lie confusedly imagines that if one bundle
of hay is removed he will cease to be a donkey,”
And again:—
“Three minutes’ thought would suffice to find this
out; but thought is irksome, and three minutes is a
long time.”
Or, on a larger scale:—•
"If a man will comprehend the richness and variety
of the universe, and inspire his mind with a due
measure of wonder and awe, he must contemplate
the human intellect not only on its heights of genius
but in its abysses of ineptitude; and it might be
fruitlessly debated to the end of time whether Rich-
ard Bentley or Elias Stoeber was the more marvellous
work of the Creator.”
The average man—the Leacock-lover—doesn’t under-
stand getting humor out of your job; he thinks it
in bad taste, if not actually blasphemous (this scribe
was rebuked with violence in old davs for letting
schoolboys know that Cicero went to the circus and
Xenophon’s ideas about riding are screamingly
funny). But I do maintain that humor should be
home-grown, not imported or sought in distant lands ;
and that the most humorous professor is the one who
is humorous without ceasing to be a professor. Hous-
man, by the bye, is in the line of true classical
scholarship as a venerator of Charles Badham, “the
one English scholar of the mid-century whose reputa-
tion crossed the Channel, received from abroad the
praises of Duebner and Nauck and Cobet; but at
home was excluded from academical preferment, set
to teach boys at Birmingham, and finally transported
to the antipodes.”
“Vandorian” (London): Had tea with novelist
E. V. Lucas the other day. He enthused about Aus-
tralian artists, wondered why they didn’t hold a
show of their own in London from time to time, and
heaped praise on the work in a chance copy of Art
in Australia that came his way. One of the most
unassuming of “lions,” Lucas wrote a preface in
°ne of Dennis’s books, and he asked about this
“brilliant Australian” (whom he has never met)
in terms of warm admiration. A new and revised
edition (the fifth) of his own “Life of Charles
Lamb” has just been printed.
“T. 0.1.”: The newspaper owned by the wordy
Ulster visitor, W. Copeland Trimble, is Tiie Impar-
tial Reporter, published at Inniskillen, which at
one time was a Parliamentary borough, represented,
by the Tory James Whiteside, afterwards Lord Chief
Justice of Ireland.
“O’h Aonian”: Joseph Conrad, in a preface to
‘ ’Twixt Land and Sea,” in the collected edition of
his works, says, referring to “The Secret Sharer”:
“The basic part of the tale I had in my possession
for a good many years. It was in truth the common
possession of the whole fleet of merchant ships trad-
ing to India, China and Australia. The fact itself
happened on board a very distinguished member of
it, Cutty Sark by name....l do not know the date
of the occurrence. It came to light about the middle
eighties, though I had heard of it before among the
officers of the great wool fleet in which my first five
years in deep water were served. It came to light
under circumstances dramatic enough, I thiivk,
but which have nothing to do with my story.” The
bare plot of Conrad’s story is the killing of a refrac-
tory seaman by the young mate of an English sailing
ship for refusing to obey an emergency order, the
mate’s imprisonment on board, his escape while the
ship was at anchor in the Gulf of Siam, his being
taken on board another ship unknown to the crew,
his successful concealment in the skipper’s cabin
until the skipper at some risk to the ship brought
her near enough to an island lower down the Gulf to
enable the fugitive to slip overboard in the dark
and swim to the shore. lias any Bulletin reader
a recollection of the happening on the Cutfv Sark?
And what were the dramatic circumstances under
which it came to light?
“G.P.L.F.”: I’ll never forget the rumpus raised
some years ago on the Orange Leader through the
lino-operator dropping in a facetious catch-line which
tho slugger omitted to lift. A country correspon-
dent was in the habit of sending in his copy on the
backs of playbills and tea-wrappers. This annoyed
the machinist, who sent the proof out with this in
big black: “For Krise sake send this bloque some
copy-paper.” The amazing line appeared in the
middle ot a solemn column, and the “slugger” went
to the reptile contemp.
ENVY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do not envy man his lot,
Nor covet anything he’s got
From matching his “I wjll” with mine
And winning out with logic fine.
I do not envy him his wit,
His conversation apt and fit,
Nor company that he may keep
When I, perchance, am fast asleep.
But what I’d give the world to own.
To keep for my full use alone.
Is just that gift my vain soul slights—
His punctuation when he writes.

A lady who deserved well of her country
was Mrs. John Patch, 89, who passed out
at Coraki ( N.S.W.) recently, after living
there for half a century. She left nine child-
ren and 75 grandchildren, and the great-
grandchildren are already 15 past the 100.
Talk about dying for the flag 1 William
Bennett, of Adelaide, a decrepit old man,
having been sacked from the job of standard-
bearer in the Salv’army the other day, in-
serted three bullets behind his right ear. He
survived the barrage, and a few days later
pledged himself to the extent of £lO to leave
intact what remained of his head.
“D.F.”: The South Coast of N. S. Wales
will soon be the best lighted rural region in
Australia. It will not be long before the
electric belt runs for nearly 50 miles along
the coast. The Bulli Shire, north of Wol-
longong, is already lighted, very soon
the State power-house at Port Kembla will
be supplying current to Wollongong and to
the cow-villages in the miles of country be-
tween that town and Kiama. The juice has
to go to the State metal-quarries at Kiama,
which explains why the cocoanut has milk
as well as the Strawberry.
“Offsider” : The Stokes gun mentioned by
“Emsee” (B. 23/6/’2l) was lost by an Aus-
tralian company, and the Tommies didn’t
forget to rub it in. In the early days of the
French campaign “(lot a Woodbine,
choom?” was the popular mode of address-
ing stray fragments of the B.E.F. encoun-
tered on the road to Armentiferes, and at first
Tommy had no suitable retort. But the loss
of the lethal weapon enabled him to renlv,
with labored but effective sarcasm, “No
cliooin, but Ah can tell y’ where y’ can get
a Stokes goon, if that’ll do instead.” After
that the Aussie decided that the old saluta-
tion had lost its savor, and it was dropped.
“E.T.”: When the arch leg-puller De
Rougeinont was in the centre of the stage,
monopolising every ray of limelight in Eng-
land, London Daily Chkonicle published
a paper-covered brochure entitled “Groin on
Rougeinont: or a Story of a Modern Robin-
son Crusoe.” It was a narrative of the
adventurer’s life, with a copy of his birth-
certificate —he was born in the canton Valid,
on the borders of Lake NeuchAtel —and por-
traits of his family. But the most interest-
ing thing about it was that Phil May had
done 11 drawings (including the colored
cover) for it. They are fine specimens of his
work, full of humor, and looking at them
23 years after they were executed one realises
that Whistler’s dictum for that day was
good: “English black-and-white art is
summed up in Phil May.”
Captain Gilbert Mair one of the best living
authorities on the Maori, his history and tra-
ditions, lately wrote to a friend in Sydney
telling of a delightful journey he had just
completed through the Urewera country —the
M.L. Tyrol. “My ears,” he writes, “were
ravished with the heavenly chorus of the
koromiko, or bellbird, which 30 years ago we
had thought to be extinct! Now, in count-
less numbers, they break forth into music
from 3 a.m. to sunrise. No human voice or
instrument can rival their superb song.
Strange to say, these dear little creatures
have developed a new instinct, and, instead of
nesting as of yore on strong, erect shrubs,
now build their nests on thin, swaying
drooping branches which afford no foothold
to the predatory cat, rat, stoat or weasel.”
“G. 8.” (Bombay) comes again
Since my recent growl about Australian trade
with India” (B. 26/5/’2l) I have had another
experience. In Aussie last year on leave I was
struck with the excellence and comparative cheap-
ness of ouir sparkling wines. On my return I
ordered 4doz. through Thos. Cook and Son, being
fired with enthusiasm to give Aussie a bit of an
advt. by distributing a taste round to interested
firms. The case recently arrived, and of the 48
bottles paid for I received 30, so that each full
bottle cost me more than I have to pay for Dry
Monopole, 1906, delivered here from stock.
As proof I enclose the Customs bill of
entry, from which you will see that I was 11
bottles short by the time the case reached India,
and owing to the defective packing the other seven
were probably pinched in the docks. It was the
same old story, absolutely inadequate casing—just
the same as if it was being sent a few miles up-
country in Aussie. Naturally I feel discouraged,
not the less so because the wine inside the bottles
is fine and has received great praise from those to
whom I have given a taste. Incidentally, the corks
used are very inferior. One was so bad that the
bottle was half-empty, and all the fizz gone.
“N. or M.”: When “Glen Orchy” medi-
tated among the early Tasmanian tombs of
Old St. David’s Cemetery (B. 2(i/5/’2l), he
missed the oldest of the lot Here it is :
George Kearly was Born July the 9, 1802 and
died the 13th.
Joseph Kearly was born May the 30th, 1805,
and died the 5 of August.
Come Lord make ready our bride
Our Saviour no longer delay
Come quickly our God and our Guide. . . .
A concluding line is sunk in the encroaching
earth. George was evidently not a Cur-
rency Lad, as there was no settlement in
Tas. until Bowen came in 1803. and the
graveyard was pegged out by Knopwood
shortly after Collins’s arrival in 1804.
Probably the youngster died and was buried
in England, and when his brother Jo fol-
lowed him west the parents put up a stone
in memory of both babies. The wooden
slab mentioned by “Glen Orchy,” that used
to mark the grave of Knopwood’s house-
keeper was some years ago sent to an exhi-
bition in England as an example of the dura-
bility of Tas. blue-gum. While on epi-
taphs, listen to the defiance of Elizabeth
Belton, who died in 1810, aged 42 :
Farewell vain world
Enough I’ve had of thee,
Careless I am
What you can say of me.
Take care to shun,
Look at home
There is enough to be done.
Elizabeth had evidently suffered at the claws
of cats. Richard Clebourne claims the
hospitality of the same tomb as Alexander
Beauvais.” Beauvais, whose property at
Sandford is now miscalled Booby’s Hill,
was a witty Frenchman who kept his con-
temporaries chuckling. Summoned as wit-
ness in a criminal case, he was delayed by
a restive horse and torrential rains, and
arrived late. “I ask pardon, your Honor,”
he gasped breathlessly, “but I have come
here at the imminent risk of my neck, as
many a poor fellow has done before me.”

HAIR IS SPOILED
BY SOAP WASHING.
Jmo girl or woman who prides herself on
lovely hair would dream of using harsh
laundry or scrubbing soap for a shampoo.
But they really run just as great a risk
with most .soaps or ready-mixed shampoos,
which also contain excessive alkali, hidden
perhaps by some heavy perfume. And alkali,
you know, dries the scalp, burns the hair,
and makes it brittle.
Undoubtedly the most elegant and safe
thing for a proper hair wash is ordinary
colinated cocoanut oil (a pure, saponified
but quite greaseless liquid). It is not the
least expensive, and is far, far better than
anything else. Every chemist keeps it on
hand, and a few ounces are ample for all
the family, for a long time.
Merely wet the hair with water and rub
it through—thoroughly. A teaspoonful or
two is sufficient. It creates a copious
amount of rich, creamy lather, cleanses from
roots to taps, and rinses out without the
slightest difficulty. The hair dries rapidly
and smootlkly, and comes out brilliantly,
lustrous, sofit, silky and fluffy. You can’t
find a speck of dust, dirt or dandruff scurf
anywhere. Best of all, the hair is never
left slippery, but is as easy to dress as if you
hadn’t washed it at all.— Advt.
Mrs. J. Parker, of Charters Towers (Q.),
who has just passed out at 71, was one of the
nrst women to settle on the Northern gold-
neld. She went there in 1874, soon after its
discovery by Hugh Mosnian, and her husband
carried the first mining machinery to the
field.
"Mr. Mae.” : Our N.Q. Gaiters created a
stir in Townsville the other evening by
marching into a fashionable restaurant with
a bicycle lamp (lighted) in one hand, and
a bike-pump in the other. Absent-minded-
ness? No fear. The worthy bishop is fast
learning the difference between bush brother-
hood and the town variety, and is taking no
risks where portable property is concerned.
Reorganisation of the professional side of
vie. Public Works Department is in the
air. There is talk of reviving the Inspector-
Generalship which became dormant when
M illiam Davidson retired. If the position is
resuscitated, George Ivermode, Chief Engi-
neer, may be asked to take it and carry on
his present work. The added experience
may be useful if he is to become chairman
of a Port Phillip (Melbourne-Geelong) Har-
bor Management Commission later on.
“Bat”: The vagaries of military tribunals
were simply wonderful. Take the case of
Clinker, who had done about one-third of his
military service in the place that gave him
his name. The charge was that he had
attempted to sell a signal-service bicycle to
a Belgian, and on account of the timidity of
the latter there wasn’t very strong proof.
Still Clinker pleaded guilty. After hearing
evidence the Colonel promptly dismissed the
case. “But, sir,” whispered the Adjutant,
“you can’t do that—the man has pleaded
guilty.” “Nonsense,” roared the Colonel; “I
don’t believe him —lie is one of the damnedest
liars in the A.1.F.”
“Bio-Chem” discusses thyroid :
“Gregor” (B. 36/6/’2l ) is incorrect in saying
that Or. Ratten’s ease of thyroid transference in
Tasmania is not unique and that the operation :s
done; almost weekly in Australia. In a year at a
big public hospital I haven’t seen such an opera-
tion or heard it suggested, though there have been
fully 30 leases of myxoedema—the condition due
to thyroid deficiency. A careful search of medical
and surgical literature gives no reference to thyroid
transference except to say that it has been occa-
sionally tried but never successfully. This is not
to say that treatment of myxoedema and cretinism
by gland extract is not successful, for, to quote
Osier, “our art has made no more brilliant advance
than in the cure of these disorders.”
‘The Oldest Inhabitant”: Only once was
the Australian (Sydney) Gas Co. seriously
threatened prior to the arrival of the electric
light. In September, 1869, a prospectus of
a new concern, The Consumers’ Gas and Oil
Company, was issued, the capital to be
iioO.OOO, in £1 shares, with power to in-
crease. The proposed co. was to purchase
the Hartley Kerosene Co.’s mine and plant
and had the option of a site for works at
I’yrmont. The directors were Thomas Holt,
John Hay, G. W. Lord, T. W. Smart,
•Tames Henderson, Richard Lloyd, T. S.
Mort and F. L. Sentis, and the secretaries
pro tem. were Richardsop and Wrench. The
cost of the Hartley estate (of which the
directors were R. J. Want, Saul Samuel,
Augustus Morris, J. de V. Lamb and J. C.
Raymond) was £30,000. There is a legend
that the A.G.L. Co. secured the majority of
the shares and shelved the proposition.
“Sixenate”: A hole big enough to pour
large quantities of beer through has been
found in the N. S. Wales, law relating to pro-
hibition orders. A prohibited man caught in
the liquor booth at a country show was
charged with “being on licensed premises”;
but the Law decided that, though a booth was
licensed, it wasn’t a licensed premises within
the meaning of the Act, and the charge was
dismissed. So the restricted beer-maniac can
look hopefully to show-time and race-meet-
ings for the breaking of his drought—if he
has any difficulty at other times. Mostly he
hasn’t, because of the fluid sympathy of
acquaintances who sneak drinks to him in
alleyways, and even thrust beer upon him
when he doesn’t want it. A Sydney writer
against whom an order was in force for a
time put it this way: “I wish the blanky
thing would run out and give me a chance to
get sober.”
While the Sydney Government is toying
with gorgeous schemes for the construction
of the North Shore bridge and the city rail-
way, a helpful report has been issued by the
Chief Railway Commissioner. Since *1914
1560 miles of country lines, practically all
leading to the congested city, have been
built at a cost of £18,000,000, but the tonnage
of goods carried has increased by only one-
third of one per cent. The country passenger
traffic is likewise disappointing (largely, no
doubt, because a considerable proportion of
country passengers buy single ticket? to Syd-
ney), but the suburban traffic has gone up
34.7 per cent. In the circumstances the
Chief Commissioner suggests that “further
new construction” should be cut out. ' A
better plan would be to abandon the maniacal
centralisation policy and buil<l railways to
their natural ports, but that would mean cut-
ting Sydney out. And Sydney must be
bloated even if production dwindles and coun-
try towns decay.
“Costs”: Though we don’t hang the enter-
pausing lady who murders her husband so
often as we used to, she isn’t getting much
other encouragement. She can't now even
depend upon a cut out of his estate. Nearly
20 years ago Selina Sangal, with the assist-
ance of one Tisler, shoved her spouse down
the family well at Keysborough (Vic.).
They sent Selina to gaol nominally for life;
but, in expectation of a release arriving
some day, the curator on her behalf applied
for one-third of her husband’s estate —the
proportion a wife would be entitled to if
her husband was in so much hurry to fall
down a well that he did it without making
a will. The matter went to Sehutt, J., and
it made him do some hard thinking. Cer-
tainly the course is marked where there is
a will: there are English precedents for
disregarding a direction where the person
who was to benefit sought to hurry matters
with poison or an axe. His Honor thought
that what was good sauce for the goose
where there was a will was good sauce, too.
for the gander where there wasn’t; and
Selina Sangal won’t be as rich as she might
have been if a Judge hadn’t come to the
conclusion that the murdering 0 f husbands
is against public policy.

REDUCE BEARING REPAIRS
Lost Production can never be made up
The vital importance of Scientific Bearing Lubrication
THE lubrication of a single bearing in a
plant may not seem important. But
bearings are scattered throughout every
plant by hundreds and thousands. Every
important machine must support its moving
parts on bearings.
And—if the bearing fails the machine
itself must stop.
Thus trouble with a single £f> bearing
may waste worth of workmen’s time;
lay up a machine and cut off
worth of production.
Production is the important point.
Burned out bearings do
not cost so much to replace,
but they do eat seriously into
production. And lost pro-
duction can never be made up
It always has been and
always will be cheaper to
wear out oil than bearings.
“Worn-out” oil can be re-
placed with little or no mechanical interrup-
tion. But worn bearings take expensive
time to replace. Operators are realising this
to-day as never before.
In the lubrication of machinery bearings
have too often been slighted. Too common-
ly the impression has been that “any oil
would do.” This mistake is now being
realized and corrected.
Mechanical troubles to-day mean serious
manufacturing interruptions and costly loss
of production.
If you are not using Gargoyle Bearing Oils

Richard Davies, of Rocky Springs station
(N.Q.), was one of the first settlers in the
Far North. Coming to Vic. as a boy in
1851 he became a police cadet at 16, and in
1853 rode one of the leaders of the team
that hauled the cannon from Melbourne to
Ballarat to splinter the Eureka stockade. In
1860 he was in charge of the depot at Royal
Park when the horses and equipment of the
Burke and Wills expedition were got to-
gether. The - old chap recently passed his
85th milestone.
Over in Mexico the length of a man’s
life may still depend on his trigger-finger, as
in the bad old days of western U.S.A. That’s
how a Tasmanian Anzac, Thomas Clyde
Whittle, a brother of Sergeant Whittle,
V.C., found it. After the war he drifted to
Durango, and there he lately got into holts
with a poker expert who had an ace in his
boot. The Mexican won on the draw and
Whittle had a funeral. But his friends
evened things by stringing up the gambler.
Then they dropped a line to Whittle’s rela-
tions in the Speck, “whoever they may be,”
to express sympathy and sorrow.
Parson John A. Waddell, who reached the
77th milestone at Rockdale (N.S.W.) the
other day, can look back on a sentence of
death. It was a few years after he, ns a boy,
hud come with his family to settle at Col-
lector. Bushranger Ben Hall, interfered
with in the pursuit of his plans, pronounced
the sentence, declaring that the whole \\ ad-
dell family was to be wiped out, and its
house burnt; but the Collector people organ-
ised a defence party and held the ’rangers off.
Finally Ben Hall and Gilbert were shot by
the police, and Dunn, who had previously
murdered Constable Nelson, was caught and
supplied with an undersize in neckwear.
“Ex-Dig.”: The theory that small-pox
vaccination is good for only seven years is
sound, if my own case could make it so. Early
in 1912 I contracted cow-pox; and after I
joined the A.I.F. the quacks made repeated
futile attempts to vaccinate me. I still smiled
with confidence when on my way home in
1919 vaccination time came on again. In a
few days, however, my arm was swollen like
an inflamed leg of mutton, and the gland in
the armpit rose to the size of an egg. Then
I remembered that, though the original cow-
pox was a pledge of immunity, it lasted only
seven years, and the ticket had run out.
Dr. J. A. O’Brien’s friends say he was
treated shabbily when the Vic. Government
deprived him of a pension of about £6OO a
year on a technicality, and early in the new
session a select committee will probably
probe the matter. llis point is that he
holds a document signed in the early ’eighties
by his departmental head, the Inspector-
General of the Insane, telling him he had
no need to insure his life, as he was entitled
to a pension. In the case of an Education
officer, a similar claim was allowed. All
that O’Brien was given on retiring was nine
months’ pay.
General Joseph Maria Gordon, whose
“Chronicles of a Gay Gordon” are to be
published by Cassell’s next month, will be
chiefly remembered in South Aus. and N. S.
Wales, where he was Military Commandant
for years, for the amount of wax which he
applied to his exiguous moustaches. He
took local society and his job very seriously,
and attended every sort of function in the
correct London garb for that type of enter-
tainment. One of his pet schemes in Syd-
ney was to form a corps d’elite, officered ex-
clusively by young men of wealth and posi-
tion, but he was baulked by the fact that
the potential Guardsmen were too busy help-
ing dad in his shop or his office.
“Malua” (Fiji) : Some of these days,
perhaps, somebody will invent a wireless
station that will ring a bell or fire off a
cannon or something when an operator is
wanted on the premises. Until then wireless
won’t be all it is cracked up to be. For in-
stance, here at the Suva station only at cer-
tain hours can messages be sent or received,
and the Atua was so tactless recently as to
strike a rock outside those hours. Then the
only way of getting help from Suva, 20
miles away, was to send by wireless from
the Atua to the Niagara, which repeated the
message to Awanui (M.L.), which cabled
it to Fiji. One disadvantage of this system,
of course, is that the Niagara can’t be de-
pended upon to be where it can act as a
repeating station.
Mitchell, K.C., with Dixon as junior, is
to appear for an elector of Prahran who
has challenged Labor-member Parker’s right
to hold the seat in the Assembly whicn
Donald Mackinnon formerly sat upon.
Cohen, K.C., M.L.C., with Rex Hain as his
junior, will represent Parker. Snow’ball is
chairman of the Elections and Qualifications
Committee (three Liberals, three Laborites
and one Cocky) which has to decide the
point at issue—whether or not Parker was
an uncertificated insolvent when he became
a member. Parker says an order nisi was
granted on an ex parte application, but that
there was no appearance on the day the
question of an order absolute was to have
come on, and the application lapsed. Donald
Mackinnon is in the Cold Country—more
interested in cricket than in politics at pre-
sent.
“Bill Bowyang’s” send-off to an old friend :
Duncan Graham, who died at Innisfail (N.Q.)
recently, was one of the early adventurers of the
Far North. His father, a retired Anglo-Indian
officer, failed as a squatter in S. Aus., and young
Graham went off to the Northern Territory. He
was selected as guide to Baron von Mueller’s expedi-
tion, and it was one of his delights to tell how
the German scientist posted sentries every night
and conducted his camps on war-time service lines.
Graham was brought all the way to Brisbane to give
an exhibition of buck-jump riding before the King,
then Prince of Wales, and after sitting a noted
outlaw he slipped the saddle off and rode the animal
bareback. Returning to the Territory he leased a
small island off the coast, bought a schooner, and,
among other things, worked a guano deposit. He
employed several Chinese, and once when they struck
he put all the food on his schooner and anchored
off the island until they agreed to his terms. In
recent years Graham invested his money in pastoral
properties and sugar-farms around Innisfail. Fate
ironically ended an adventurous life by a fall from
a tram in Brisbane. I raise my hat to the memory
of one who shared his last piece of damper with me
in days that are gone.

CLEOPATRA’S VISION
THE great queen who reigned
centuries ago was one
famous user of Palm and
Olive oils—perhaps she pictured
the day when modern science
would combine them for universal
toilet use. For even in the
sumptuous days of ancient Egypt
these great natural cleansing
agents were only obtainable in
their crude natural state. If
Cleopatra lived to-day she would
revel in the greatest of all toilet
luxuries—the perfection of these
famous oils in the fragrant,
creamy cake of Palmolive Soap.

The Making of Maivon
“ESTELLE.”
I HAD a note from Manon this morning,
asking me round to spend the after
noon at her microscopic flat.
I went. I am fond of Manon, although
I consider her unnecessarily good-looking.
Her features are not extraordinaiily fine,
but the whole effect is dangerously charm-
ing. I looked forward to seeing her arming
for conquest.
By 4 o’clock we, were in her little bed-
room. ‘‘Sit down, there’s a dear, she said,
"and while you are finishing that sash I
will reveal to you my horrid secrets.
While she was examining herself criti-
cally in the glass, I had time to observe
she was not looking her best. She looked
pale, and little lines were visible round the
eyes and mouth. V.A.D. work is tiring,
and it had left its mark on her. There were
two little blackheads on her chin, her hair
was lank and straight, and her hands and
nails needed attention.
“Yes, I am ugly, am I not?” she said gaily,
as if in answer to my unspoken thoughts.
“Do you think Sidney will get an awful
fright when he sees me?”
“It doesn’t seem to worry you, anyway,”
I said, biting off a thread.
“It doesn’t,” she said, “because I am going
to make myself pretty here and now.”
“Paint and powder,” I said acidly, “will
not banish those spots on your face. If you
don’t want to frighten your fiance you’d
better take a few days’ rest and keep severely
to yourself.”
“You dear old puss!” said Manon, who
was washing.
“You don’t use soap on your face!” I
exclaimed, as she rubbed a creamy lather
into her skin.
“Not ordinary soap,” she explained, as
she rinsed and dried it. “Pilenta. You
wouldn’t call my skin so bad, would you? I
can't use anything but a neutral soap, and
my chemist tells me this is the nearest to'
neutral you can get.”
Her next movement interested me. Be-
fore her skin was quite dry she rubbed some
white stuff, like rather solid cold cream,
on her face and neck, and then wiped it off
with a clean towel. “What’s that?” I
asked.
“Mercolised Wax,” said Manon; “I never
use cold creams: they clog your skin up
and make it muddy. Whenever I get tired
of my old skin I just put some of this on,
which removes the outer cuticle, leaving a
nice new skin underneath. No, you can’t
see it peeling, silly! Look!” I examined
her closely, and certainly her skin looked
wonderfully fresh and clear, and there was
no sign of roughness.
While she was brushing her hair I re-
marked, “Aren’t you going to have any
sleeves at all in this frock?”
“Of course not; it would ruin it. One
must have one decent dance frock.”
“But, Manon,” I expostulated. She smiled.
“I’ll tell you another little secret. Pheminol
for removing superfluous hair—is sold in
powder form at any decent chemist’s, and
you mix it with water yourself so as to
make a paste. It’s simply wonderful, and
the process isn’t a bit painful, and doesn’t
leave any red marks or irritation.”
Manon was still brushing her thick and
pretty hair. It is fairly ordinary in color,
darkest brown, but there are soft lights in
it, and it is beautifully glossy. “You wash
your hair with stallax, don’t you?” she
asked me. I replied in the negative.
“Oh, but, my dear, you should; there’s
nothing like it. I washed mine last night.”
“Good gracious!” said I. “I could never
do mine up properly so soon after a sham-
poo.”
She smiled absently. Now she was brush-
ing a few' drops of some liquid into her hair
and fussing about with a comb. When I
saw her clearly two deep and becoming
■waves were visible over her forehead.
“All done by kindness and silmerine,”
she laughed.
“If I’d put it on last night my hair would
have been a mass of curls to-day. But it
doesn’t suit me so, and I just comb a little
in before I do it up.” And she , nodded a
charmingly dressed head at my reflection
in the glass.
“Hot to-night,” I remarked.
“Very,” she said. “If I don’t put some
eleminite on I shall be a pink and shiny
fright by the end of the first dance.” She
was covering her face with some lotion.
“Practically home-made,” she said. “Most
chemists keep eleminite, and you make it
up at home. Don’t you think the effects
rather good?”
It w r as. There was a soft bloom on her
face and neck which had no look of “make-
up.” but which had removed all unbecoming
“shine.” “And the beauty of it is,” said
she, “I am sure of looking the same all the
evening. No rushes for a looking-glass and
a pow’der-puff for m»e. I say, Estelle, I’m
rather pale, though. Just for once!” She
rubbed a trifle of powdered colliandum on
her cheeks. It gave her a tiny soft flush
which was most becoming, and brought out
the color of her eyies.
“What glorious eyelashes you have!” I
sighed enviously. “Don’t you ever touch
them up?”
“Never,” she said. “I rub a little menna-
line in now and then to make them grow’, but
that’s all. Now give me my frock, there’s a
dear. Where’s my nail, polish ? Liquid, you see :
saves a lot of trouble, and looks twice as
nice. I’ve run out of bicrolium jelly, so
my hands look a bit rough. Still, I must
have some proofs to show Sid how hard I
work. Oh. there’s a taxi! I’m sure that’s
Sid. My gloves and cloak, there’s a dear.”
She brushed her lips, with a stick of prolac-
tum. leaving them with a soft tint -that was
healthy but not too bright.
“Am I pretty?” with an enchanting smile.
“Horribly.” I said, with a pang of jeal-
ousy.
“By-bye, Estelle. Tell you some more
mother day.”
A nd she was gone.' l —Advt.

The Sanity or Otherwise of Omelet.
[FRO THE BULLETIN.]
THE alleged sanity of Hamlet was lec-
tured upon recently before the N.S.W.
Shakspeare Society by the pro-
foundly learned H. M. Green, 8.A., LL.B.
It is an old subject and a vexed one. It has
turned up in many books —even one of
the mad doctors in Charles Reade’s “Hard
Cash,” published in 1863, was so earnest on
the subject that he wouldn’t certify that a
patient was sane unless the patient agreed
that Hamlet wasn’t.
For his part, Mr. Green decided that Ham-
let was more or less unbalanced and showed
reasons for coming to that conclusion. But
another idea is that Shakspeare (whoever he
was) gave no attention to whether his
character was crazed or not, and had no
idea that posterity would worry about the
mind of a shadow in a book, any more than
the man who makes images of Buddha con-
siders whether one particular image is more
out of its mind than another. The men who
wrote the Bible said plainly that Saul was
occasionally cracked; that Nebuchadnezzar
was mentally dispersed for a season; but
that David was only shamming .when he
put on a vacant look and “scrabbled on the
doors of the gate.” As Shakspeare gave no
such information regarding Hamlet I opine
that he didn’t know’.
But whatever we may decide about Hamlet,
it is time to raise the neglected and import-
ant problem of the alleged sanity or other-
wise of Omelet. Hamlet was the shadow
that Shakspeare made. Omelet was the one
he w’ould have made if he had felt that way.
Circumstances thus make him much the
deeper and more intricate character of the
two, for we not only want to know what
he was but why he wasn’t. Whether he
was so mad that Shakspeare didn’t like to
publish him out of regard for his (Omelet’s)
relatives; whether Shakspeare was mad
with himself for not publishing him;
whether Omelet started well but sank into
imbecility in the second act and couldn’t
be persuaded to carry on any longer;
whether he became dangerous and fled after
tearing up the manuscript; or whether he
was sane all the time —so uninterestingly
sane that it w r as decided, after an attempt
to use him, that his dulness was incurable —•
all these are matters of speculation. The
fact is that something happened to Omelet
to prevent him appearing, whereas Hamlet
got into print; and the mystery ought to be
cleared up. The whole business of Shaks-
pearean investigation halts on the threshold
until Omelet is found.
I have formed many theories about this
character —the most completely mislaid one
in fiction or drama. One possibility is that
he was either Irish or Portuguese, for the
scarcity of men of these nations in Shaks-
peare’s works suggests that one has dropped
out —perhaps more than one. The care with
which he concealed himself from the reader
suggests a furtive and suspicious disposition
carried to an excess, which suggests in its
turn a mind cut on the bias. On the other
hand it may merely indicate a miserly dis-
position and a secret brooding over wealth
in a cellar, but I hardly think so. The
manner in which he avoided committing him-
self in writing points to the fearful mind of
the person who looks back over his shoulder
for imaginary enemies, or else to the born con-
spirator. It couldn’t have been that he was
unable to write, for so common and illiterate
a figure wouldn’t be worth concealing. To
the fact that he was also chary of speech I
attach less weight. He might easily have
had a harelip and been unintelligible, and
his deformity might have embittered him
and led to the consequences which were too
horrible for the dramatist to mention.
There is a certain weight of evidence that
he was a bad character. Of bad actions the
perpetrators of which have never been traced
there are thousands, while there are at
least two claimants to every good action.
Therefore there is reason to believe that
Omelet committed some of the bad actions,
the good ones being already done several
times over. But whether he committed his
crimes and wallowed in blood because lie
was mad, or whether he became a dangerous
lunatic through wallowing, must with many
other things be decided by learned re-
search. It would be especially interesting
to know whether his case was incurable
and something about the manner of his
death. Supposing he perished by sponta-
neous combustion it would clear up a medical
point, the existence of that distressing
malady being much disputed. And it would
greatly improve Shakspeare, whose • deaths
are of limited range.
J.E.
“T.C.” comes home from the war: —
After two or three years’ absence I found poor
cousin Emmy ironing, and looking a little more
faded than of yore—if possible. “And how’s
uncle?” I asked, after a few preliminaries—“still
the same quarrelsome old bird, with the whole
world against him?” Emmy hooked a wisp of tow-
colored hair from across her lean, freckled nose, and
sighed: “Y’d better go in an’ see him. He reckons
the end ’as come again; but he won’t have a doctor,
of course.” Knowing uncle well, I pushed open the
door of the little back bedroom and entered, some-
what boisterously. “That’s no way t’ come
into a dyin’ man’s room!” he snarled from the
centre of a pile of pillows. “Why, how goes it,
Unk!” I exclaimed. “They tell me you’ve got your
ticket all right this trip—is that a fact?” He poked
irritably at his ear with a carpenter’s pencil and
scowled at a crumpled sheet of paper that lay on
the bed before him. “I don’t want no sarcasm
from you,” he snapped. “You’ve just about got ’ere
in time, anyhow.” “What, you’re not makin’ your
will, are you?” I asked. There came a fearsome out-
burst from the direction of the sick bed. “That
settles it!” he snapped. “I was just makin’ a list
er them t’ be invited to me funeral! Now I’iJ
scratch you off alonger them other ’s!” After
that there was nothing to do but depart. But I
promised Cousin Emmy that, for her sake, I’d behave
a little better next time Uncle was dying.

“YZ”: Arthur Salmon, of Leongatha
(Vic.), disclosed in his will the hiding-place
of certain valuables. He had bestowed them
in the beehive. Shrewd! Yet who is more
persistently robbed than the bees?

“Itellu”: Money in sugar? At Innisfail
(Q.) the production this year is calculated
at 40,000 tons. At current market rate
the value will be £1,333,333 Os. Sd. The
number of persons on the Innisfail roll is
rather less than 3000.
“D.Y.”: My Federal income-tax assess-
ment has just come to hand in an envelope
conspicuously branded “Made in U.S.A.”
It helps to explain why there’s such a hand-
ful of people in Australia to carry the Com-
monwealth's heavy load of taxation.
“Te Pana”: Maoriland’s Department of
Industries has turned in its sleep and noticed
that much money is spent on American hick-
ory handles for picks, axes, etc. Southland
still grows great areas of birch or beech
trees, and the Forestry Department, after
testing the wood, says it is every bit as good
as U.S.A. hickory. But the hardware men
are still importing, and cocky continues to
use the firestick in the forests.
“II.II.”: The United States used to supply
the world with oil; but so furiously has it
taken to the motor-car habit that last year
the local consumption was 531,000,000 bar-
rels, against a production of 443,000,000.
This may explain why the U.S. is planning
a fleet which will at least equal the two
next-best on the seas. It may he necessary
soon to go out with a high hand and demand
oil.
* * * *
“C.L.M.”: In the cow districts thousands
of calves are slaughtered annually, yet the
cheese industry during the war was con-
fronted with disaster owing to our habit of
importing the rennet, which is extracted from
the fourth stomach of the young calf. Be-
cause of its scarcity and price in the war
years, rennet was eventually supplanted by
the cheaper pepsin—also an importation. But
now the industry is again using rennet,
mostly imported, and still very dear. Some
real effort should be made to manufacture a
high-grade article of standard strength locally,
as we are now simply wasting the material
necessary for its preparation.

“Two Seas”: When “D.Y.” (B. 23/6/’2l)
says this is a two-men-one-job age he is well
within the mark, particularly as regards the
railways. In the dim past two men handled
a sleeper; then a third man was put on the
job; now we see four men shifting a sleeper,
which about cuts out the price of it. But
Cocky uses old sleepers as fencing posts and
drops them into the holes all day on his
lonesome. He lays no claim to being one
of “the workers,” and when he sees a dozen
per.-way men weeding the track so close
together that a blanket would cover them he
is ready to back his old woman to yank out
more weeds in an hour than the “wage slave”
does in a day.

Arthur Griffith starts an industry:—
This is what I struck in the timber business.
Three years ago I put up a small mill at Medlow
(N.S.W.) to cut mountain-ash. Since then the
Forestry Department has increased the royalties three-
fold ; the Railway Commissioners have materially in-
creased the freight to Sydney; the bullockies have
doubled the cost of haulage to the mill —and the
price of imported timber (oregon) has been reduced
20 per cent. Naturally I’ve had to close down, with
the result that (1) the Forestry Department doesn’t
get even the old royalty; (2) there is no railway
freight at all; and (3) the bullocky is looking for a
job.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Adelaide’s famous Light
Square has been congratulated by Mayor
Moulden on entering on its third phase. It
is just off Hindle.v-street, which used to be
the city’s most important thoroughfare.
Afterwards business in part, and fashion
altogether, deserted Hindley-street, and the
west end of it was taken over by the Afghan
and the Chow and those who consort with
them. For years it has been the most
damning indictment open to the police to
speak of a vagrant of either sex as “frequent-
ing Light-square, v’r Honor.” But modern
manufacture is changing all that. The
square is now nearly built round with fac-
tories, and in welcoming the latest of them,
the new Charles Atkins building, Moulden
said that the day of the one-storey residence
there is past. The sharp rise in price per
foot of the limited frontages still available
says so too.
“Gros Michael”: The importers of Fiji
bananas are saying that the Levuka is likely
to go off the trade because the duty has been
raised from 2s. (id. to Bs. 6d. per cental. Six
shillings per cental means Is fid. per hunch,
and as each Queensland bunch contains 12
dozen fruit, and the Fijian probably the
same, the increase of duty has added lid. per
doz. Last year Fiji sent to Australia
240,000 hunches, while Queensland produced
(1018-19) 1,267,641 bunches, N. S. Wales
259,427 cases, and Westralia 3381 bushels.
If the cases and bushels are reduced to the
common denomination of bunches, it is clear
the Fiji contribution is of no great account.
The duty was increased not so much to pro-
tect Australian growers from Fiji as to stabi-
lise the market, which every now and again
was dislocated by the dumping of a shipload
of Indian-grown fruit from that island. The
Argtts states that there is an increased
wharfage rate of 41 d. on each imported bunch,
which means an additional fai thing. and
over per dozen. In New Orleans machinery
for unloading bananas and distributing same
into cars, with labor at 2s. per hour, has
brought the cost of delivery at the waterside
down to lid. per bunch, or 3d. less than the
Melbourne cost. If the Freetraders still
want to import Fiji bananas they should
lay down proper unloading plant, save the
3d. per bunch, or Is. per cental, and then
the increase in duty would only be os. per
cental, or Is. 3d per bunch, 01 hve fai things
per dozen.
“Macquarie Street” on charlatanism: —
It is not always necessary to use the prefix
“doctor” in order to secure a comfortable living out
of the public’s ailments. All one has to do is to pre-
tend to have knowledge about diseases of the nervous
system, and stick up a brass plate with that fact
inscribed upon it. Shellshock has been a godsend to
these adventurers, and so has the craze for what
they call “new psychology.” Some put up Nerve
Specialist,” without any letters to their names;
others, believing that brevity is the soul of business,
are content with the single word “Nerves. These
charlatans select this specialty for the simple reason
that most people have “nerves” at some time or
other, or, what is quite as profitable, think they
have; and they pocket guinea fees and delude
the public, not in obscure street) - or in suburban
thoroughfares, but right in the heart of big cities,
and even in the same building as the elite of the
profession occupy.
“W.R.”: “Jean’s” par. re Gimlet, the
railway-yard carpenter who wangled his
ladder past the watchman (B. 16/6/’2l),
reminds me of my assistant while I was
doing odd jobs at the Tel-el-Ivebir base
camp. One day I needed an extra piece
of timber, and, knowing how requisitioning
was fraught with delay, I asked Jones
to look round and see what he could
find. Before long he turned up with
a fine 12ft. length of 3 x 2. He
told me that, seeing some niggers building
huts, he went to their timber stack, selected
the piece, and while the nigs, interestedly
watched him, he placed the stick on the
ground, marked the position of the end on
the ground, then moved it towards our cam])
its own length, marked the end again, and
so proceeded all the way up the hill, as if he
were measuring the distance. When he was
out of sight behind a hut, he picked the loot
up and brought it home.
* * * *
“Kidwhacker”: Non-State secondary
schools are having a tough time. The cost
of maintenance has increased amazingly ; and
though school fees have also risen, elevation
in this direction has a tendency to kill, or,
at least, frighten off, the goose who sends
his gosling to such schools. Most of them
have kept up the standard of their teachers,
even though it has meant doubling their pay :
but there are others which have economised
by taking on cheap, inefficient teachers. The
only thing one of these men could do after
he had lost his scholastic billet recently was
to go out as a. jobbing gardener. Such
schools are frauds upon children and parents
alike. Recently the heads of many reput-
the 6 T ® ( 'J? ools around Sydney got together at

“Mack”: Some country firms, to attract
customers, offer a full refund of all cash
Putd for goods on a certain day. A hie firm
at Moree (N.S.W.) had the scheme gS
fast month. Every date except Sundays and
Holidays is put into a separate envelope:
tnen one is drawn and is lodged with a bank
manager and opened on the first of the suc-
ceeding month. When the thing was worked
at Narrabri a few years ago the* firm,
after the hidden day had been disclosed'
started going through the dockets of
that date, and ticked off Mrs. Brown’s
two yards calico, Mrs. Jones’s doz.
e SS s > and so on. Then the boss’s face went
white, and we heard him gasp. The next
docket read “Windmill and accessories, £6s
10s. 6d.” The holder of the invoice turned
up the following week and calmly said:
‘You can send me out another windmill ’’
He got it.
“J.F.H.”: Another imported curse. At
the annual meeting of the London Colonial
Church Society in London, Canon Dart, of
Nelson LM.L.), alleged that he had I'oinM
Outback settlers reading infidel publications,
which “showed that the Devil did not let
go when people left the homeland, but fol-
lowed them wherever they went.” While
Massy Greene is at it he might ns well
put a prohibitive duty on oversea devils.

“Herodot” : The exhibit in a recent Syd-
ney murder trial of the head of a woman
who had been dead for over three months re-
calls the persistently-recurring story of a
head-preserving factory. Its principal cus-
tomers are wealthy curio collectors in
America and Europe, to whom the human
heads are sold after they have been
through some process which shrinks them to
the size of a large orange. Some years ago
the factory was stated to be in Valparaiso,
Chile, where it was operating under the guise
of a shipchandler’s business. Before that it
was believed to have been in San Francisco,
where the police found several large copper
vats full of an infusion of vegetable matter
possessing the power of shrinking animal
tissues placed in it. But no traces of human
heads were discovered. Then a witness in a
case in London in 1012 said such a place did
exist, and that those connected with it Were
Brazilians, who obtained their supply of
heads by bribing morgue and hospital-mortu-
ary attendants, and from sailors who brohght
them in a pickling liquid. But the police
failed to uncover any traces of the establish-
ment.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM his seat in the centre of the
Council House the Deputy Commis-
sioner looked thoughtfully across
the table and out under the eaves of the
thatch, between the rough-hewn pillars of
coral conglomerate supporting the lofty roof.
The octagonal ship’s-clock secured to the
great king post of the maneaba showed a
minute to ten. Glancing back to the dial
the Deputy Commissioner arose and opened
the sitting of the Court. Resuming his seat
he turned to the men assembled on the palm-
leaf mats, and called the first case.
A good-looking, violet-eyed man in white
duck stepped toward the table.
“Tong Fat,” said the Deputy Commis-
sioner, “you accuse Mr. Trevor of personal
violence ?”
Tong Fat shuffled forward, a diffident little
smile on his intelligent ivory-smootli face.
One hand clasped the long-nailed fingers of
the other hand before him on the neat cotton
blouse hanging loosely over the baggy
breeches. Down the centre of his back the
long, silk-tasseled pigtail hung like a glis-
tening black snake suspended by its neck.
Meekly he paused before the seat of judg-
ment.
“Now, what precisely are your accusa-
tions against Mr. Trevor?”
Tong Fat smiled.
“All time Jimmy he stlike-um me. See
me tekawai, he stlike-um me. See me my
own ’ouse, he come stlike-um me. Me no
like-um Jimmy stlike-um me.”
“How do you plead, Mr. Trevor? Have
you struck him as he asserts?”
“Of course I have!”
“Why have you?”
“Isn’t he a Chinaman? And didn’t lie
come here trading when we were too many
at the game already?”
“Mr. Trevor,” said the Deputy Commis-
sioner abruptly, “is your hand heavy?
Would it weigh two pounds, do you think?
Well, then, pass that much in compensation
to plaintiff—now.... Are you satisfied, Tong
Fat? Good —and you might keep your hands
off him in future, Jim. Next.”
“Wha’for?” shrieked another Celestial, of
the coarse-haired, brown-skinned type of
Amoy. “Wha’for dat blurry .Jimmy Tlevol
he alle time klick-um me, eh? Wha’for?
Allee time catch-um me, klick-um me. Wha’
for? White man he no good. Black blurry
Kanaka he more better.”
“Remove that person!” snapped the out-
raged Court to the native orderly. But be-
fore the brown constable could move, Trevor
had skilfully caught the indignant Celestial
by neck and overflow of breeches and run
him out of the maneaba.
“Now, Captain,” said the Deputy Commis-
sioner to a newcomer, “what exactly is your
grievance ?”
“As stated in my formal complaint, I
landed on the station occupied by Mr. Trevor
to take possession. Our people had acquired
the property by right of transfer from the
original owners, but Mr. Trevor, claiming
the property, warned me off at the point of
his revolver.”
“And you vacated the premises?” sug-
gested the Deputy Commissioner.
The captain grinned in response to some-
thing he thought he saw in the Deputy Com-
missioner’s eyes.
“Yes, sir,” he admitted. “There seemed
nothing to stay for.”
“What is your version, Mr. Trevor?”
“Oh, I saw him off the premises, all right.
As you are aware, I have occupied the sta-
tion for a good many years. When the
departing company finally squared accounts
the supercargo informed me that his com-
pany did not claim the station, and that, be-
ing in possession, I could consider it my
property. Therefore I did not feel called
upon to leave my home on the first bluster-
ing comer’s say-so.”
“Did you show Mr. Trevor any documents
in proof of ownership. Captain?”
“No, sir,” replied the embarrassed skipper,
and handed the Deputy Commissioner a
parchment.
“The deeds, Mr. Trevor, are in perfect
order,” said the Deputy Commissioner, pre-
sently. There was sincere regret in his
tones. Trevor, the trader, remained morosely
silent. The Deputy Commissioner ran the
flat of one hand over his close-cropped red
hair. Coming back the fingers lingered over
the bristling moustache; then, with the elbow
on the table for support, the broad chin
sank into the cup-shaped palms.
“Boys,” he said softly, yet the authority
could not be misread, “shake hands; forget
the past. And, Captain, while he sells you
a fair share of copra Trevor remains un-
disturbed.”
"That suits-ine,-” agreed, the captain, cor-
dially. “Shake, Jim.” And Jim Trevor
took the outstretched hand.
“I have,” continued the trading captain,
tentatively, “some stuff out there in my boat
I’d like your opinion upon.” He looked the
question from the Deputy Commissioner to
the trader.
“Oh, well, if we must. . . . ” said the official
resignedly. " Titiamoti ” —he changed into
the vernacular, addressing the native magis-
trate —“the Court’s adjourned. Have your
Council and native litigants here in an
hour.”
“What is his transgression?” The Deputy
Commissioner looked questioningly at a de-
jected youth, slim, yet graceful even in the
unbleached cotton prison loincloth.
Ungainly to attention on the left-hand side
of the prisoner stood a very tall, loose-lipped
policeman resplendent in new red-ribboned
uniform, and on the youth’s other side was
a short-statured, bow-legged, squint-eyed
minion of the law whose scared eyes fever-
ishly followed the white man’s lightest move.
The Deputy Commissioner wanted to laugh,
a frequent impulse while in the seat of
judgment, but the decorum of the Court
must be maintained. Controlling his quiver-
ing lips he listened gravely to the native
magistrate’s peroration.
“Attempted suicide,” explained the poten-
tate disgustedly. “Kaitaba and Kuireru
were crossing the tide-reef toward Ikiki,
when they saw Toto, which is the name of
the accused, ascend the beach, climb up the
bole of a palm-tree leaning lugoonward, tie
one end of the strands of tokoro coir-twine
around his neck, the other end to the trunk,
and” —he paused impressively for effect—
“let himself fall.”
“And how did he escape death?” asked
the Deputy Commissioner with a show of
interest.
“Toto did not understand the art of tying
an effective knot, master. Also, so great
was Toto’s excitement and so immense his
despair that he failed to measure accurately
the distance to the ground. Moreover, being,
as you perceive, little more than an un-
tattooed youth, Toto allowed not for the
elasticity of the new fibre. P’or these rea-
sons his toes touched the ground. Show
the teramitena the string, Ba,” he said sud-
denly, remembering Exhibit A.
The Captain of Police looked embarrassed.
“The string is no more,” he explained. “Hav-
ing no coir twine for the tying on of the
new thatch for my roof, I perforce used the
rope of Toto.”
“And you a Government servant!” ex-
claimed the native magistrate, horrified.
“Never mind the rope,” interrupted the
Deputy Commissioner, “what was Toto’s rea-
son for attempting his own life?”
“Tell the great white Government man
your object,” commanded the native magis-
trate sharply.
The youth hung his head and muttered
something unintelligible.
“He says he was ashamed,” explained the
magistrate amusedly.
“Ashamed? What of?” demanded the
Deputy Commissioner, and bent his head to
catch the whisper.
“Oh, of nothing of much consequence,” in-
terrupted the magistrate hurriedly.
“Speak up, prisoner!” commanded the
white man.
Startled, the youth looked up toward the
seat of judgment. “I am not long mar-
ried,” he said diffidently. “My wife was,
as is right and meet, claimed according to
custom by my relatives, and she being young
and good to look upon, the claims of my
adopted father became over-frequent, despite
her protests. Yet was I unable to interfere,
because of the custom. And for shame I
would not live.”
“And who,” asked the Deputv Commis-
sioner, quietly, “is your adopted father?”
“Oh, he is a wicked young man to wish to
take his own life!” interposed the native
magistrate hastily.
“M ho.” repeated the Deputy Commissioner,
“is your adopted father?” Involuntarily the
youth looked at the magistrate, and the
Deputy Commissioner’s eyes fell the same
way.
“Yes,” admitted the titiamoti, “Toto is my
adopted son, cared for tenderly since his
birth, and now has he put shame upon me bv
attempting his life.”
For once the Deputy Commissioner was
nonplussed; he knew it would be as unwise
as futile to attempt interference with the cus-
tom. Looking back toward the prisoner in
search of inspiration, he saw a comely
middle-aged dame take her stand bv Toto’s
side. Catching the Deputy Commissioner’s
eye she came unconsciously to his aid.
“There is also,” the woman said, “a pig
in the case.”
“A pig?” repeated the Deputy Commis-
sioner, inwardly grateful, yet not surprised,
for pigs play a role in native daily life.
“1 am Toki, Toto’s wife’s mother,” con-
tinued the woman, “and it grieved me about
the pig.”
“You shall have justice,” the white man
promised gravely; “tell the Council about this
pig- - ’
The Councillors know well the transac-
tion ; hence I am telling you. white master,”
said Toki loudly. “The pig was large and
fat, standing high as a woman’s hip, and
many a man cast covetous eyes upon it. One
day a man came to my daughter and said':
’Kiki, thy mother’s father has failed to weed
his portion of the village road, therefore must
he go to prison.’ My daughter cried very
much and begged that he be forgiven. T
am not hard of heart,’ replied the man, ‘and
for the present of thy pig will I remain silent
and allow his crime to pass unpunished.’ But
my daughter would not part with her pig,
so the man came to me and to my sister and
my brother, and said: ‘Your father left one
tuft of grass on his portion of the road un-
pulled, and must therefore go to prison. Duty
compels, yet my heart bleeds for the feeble
old man, and for Toki’s daughter’s pig will
he be forgiven.’ But Kiki would not give her
pig, for she loved him more than her
mother’s father. ‘lf Kauno neglected to clean
his road let him go to prison,’ she said ; ‘I
will not give my pig. Since he was no larger
than that, until he grew too large and heavy,
did he sleep beside me on the mats. I washed
him, combed his hair, perfumed him with
scented oils, worked for him, found him
food every day, and have gone without itv-
self that he might have plenty—l will not
give my pig.’ She refused utterly to listen
to reason, so we took the pig from her;
but she threw her arms around the pig
and screamed, and the pig squealed, and it
was very sad. Wherefore the man took
his long knife and stuck the pig and there
was much blood, and my daughter, who is
Toto’s wife, cried until she nearly died of
grief; but the pork was very good because
of the food Kiki had given the pig. Yet
did the pig die in vain, for my father was
taken to prison for one day.”
“And who,” asked the Deputy Commis-
sioner ominously, “was the man?”
“ Titiamoti replied the woman.
This was the fourth magistrate the
Deputy Commissioner had given the people
from among themselves, and all had failed
him. The first conceived the idea of mulct-
ing his villagers in cocoanuts on trumped-up
charges. The next had driven a thriving
trade in prohibited gin. The third lent
money and kind on a thousand-per-cent,
repayment basis, with prompt foreclosure
and the magistrate himself as official pro-
secutor and adjudicator. And now this last!
“Toto is acquitted,” said the Deputy
Commissioner. “Constables, release him.
But take this dishonest magistrate into cus-
tody. Lock the irons upon his wrists and
take him on board the Government ship,
whence he shall go to the Central Prison, to
labor for five years. Old Men of the Council,
select from among you another titiamoti, and
woe betide him if he too prove false to his
office.”
ERNEST OSBORNE.
The Gardeners.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY came out into green shadows in
the early dew, while the curtains
were still drawn about the columned
sleeping-places of the palace; and all day
long they went among the flowers, dipping
the spade here and plying the knife there,
but always with beauty before their eyes
and a sweetness about them in the air. Nile
w r ater ran in stone channels between the
flower-beds; and a great sun flamed in the
sky ; and the world made many noises outside
the garden wall. The master of a million
slaves walked at evening in the blossomy
quiet, and his face was the face of a god.
Outside, his word was death, his presence
terrible, the lifting of his hand a thing to
redden swords and destroy nations of men;
within the garden, he went delicately, fondled
by the growing sweetness into an ecstasy of
quiet. Outside, he met the dagger and the
poisoned wine, the sudden treachery, the
crushing weight of the invader, the fear of
himself, of his gods, of the people; inside
was sanctuary and a ouiet heart shelter.
Outside, thrones shook and dynasties fell;
inside, the gardeners dug and watered and
pruned—dug and watered and pruned for
6000 years.
By the Nile and the Euphrates, in Athens
and Rome and London, by the banks of old,
sweet rivers, and in the close by the castle
wall the gardeners went on. Gates clanged
and streets clattered; spears flamed in the
sun ; guns boomed over the valleys; but some-
where in the quiet the gardeners went on. A
brown Egyptian turned the Nile silt; a white
the wise garden of Epicurus in Athens; a
Sythian slave, happy even in bonds, tended
thousand monkish hands made sweetness in
the darkness of old France. Always the
winds caught the fragrance of glowing flowers
that through all the ages laughed down the
despot kings. They were no mean workers
in the artistry of the sun and soil, those ole
gardeners. Here and there in southern
Britain a hardy grape-vine clings to a shel-
tering wall that looks towards the summer
of the south; in Saxon times there were
vineyards, where grapes grew to make wine
as far north as Norwich. A rude people
those Edmunds and .Edwards and Etheireds
before the Norman Conquest; but they were
not rude gardeners. They had the reputa-
tion of being the best cultivators in Europe ;
and there was fragrance about their doors at
a time when they had only the haziest notion
of building a stone wall. I like to think of
the Lady Edith —they did not call her Queen,
though she was royal in her goodness and
learning—among the flower-beds by the
King’s house. The gossiping Norman idlers
at her husband’s court might defame her
through hatred of her father, but by the
lavender squares and the lilac walk there
still was peace..
Consider the League of Gardens that was
and is before all Leagues of Nations. China
and Damascus, Provence and Ayrshire, Aus-
tria and Japan meet and mingle in the grand
parentage of the rosary The Inca plucked
the fuchsia and the Aztec the dahlia; the
Romans brought the scented violet to Britain :
the pansy grows wild near the Arctic Circle:
coleus is from Java; begonia from South
America : carnation from southern Europe;
azalea from India. What exchanges of lov-
ing care there have been from garden to gar-
den ! The Kaiser could not stop Genna n
roses from blooming in every settled land,
nor can Sinn Fein prevent the “Ulster Stan-
dard” waving in new beds the world over.
No alien exclusion measure can stop the
Chinese wistaria from making a lavender
glory in the spring on its bare grey stems;
and though Wilson’s light be darkened
American “Radiance” breathes the old deli-
cate perfume of “La France.” I think if all
men were gardeners there could be no more
war. There are still leaves of healing for
the nations in the flowery city of God.

Nightmare.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And suddenly I know the moonlit street
Was stretching, stretching like a blind
white eel,
And for a thousand miles there rang the beat
Of tossing, twitching, writhing, dreadful feet,
Of tortured toe and thrice-demented heel,
Which lurched along and shook the ground
with fear,
And ever hurried on and came more near!
The eel-skin shivered like a thing afraid ;
I saw it tremble in the pallid light;
But those mad leaping feet could not be
stayed—•
They swept along; I saw them come arrayed
In all the terrors of the ghoulish night.
I only saw the feet and nothing more;
I did not dare to see the things they bore.
Ah, God ! The dreadful feet that thudded by,
Twisted, contorted, clutching at the eel,
The poor, affrighted road that tried to fly,
And in the dark was trampled down to die;
The fat, red toes sent up an awful peal
Of music to the blank face of the moon ;
The bloated ankles beat a timeless croon.
And never had the ears of any man
Listened to such a song of woe as this ;
It had no tune, no rhythm nor any plan,
But throbbing, sighing, through the midnight
ran:
Now deep as thunder, now a serpent’s
hiss.
And suddenly it beat upon my brain
That they who thus sped by were things not
sane!
’Twas then I knew, alack! the mad were out.
Had swept away the walls that hemmed
them round,
Had broken down the bars set all about,
And in a frantic, whirling, gruesome rout
Were pounding round the earth until the
ground
Shook ’neath the trample of their frenzied
charge—•
Trembled because the mad folk were at large!
Woe! Woe ! They sought for me, and I
was bound
In ropes of strange inertia hot and tight;
I lay so still, my breathing made no sound.
They’d dance upon my brain if I were found.
Their feet would batter it as black as
night.
There was no hope, no air, but only feet
Which throbbed and thudded down the fright-
ened street.
A cock crowed and across the happy world
Pink javelins of light were swiftly hurled;
The wad feet fled, the white eel slipped away,
Before the calm serenity of day!

The new Sydney Theatre Royal appro-
prmtely opened on Saturday night with
Adam and Lva, a new comedy—American
built, of course—packed for the first half
with easy laughs and trailing off into the
usual jerry-built suburbs. The plav, in
which i rank Harvey is Adam and Maude
Hanaford is Eva, concerns a wealthy Ameri-
can father tired out with his family and
his poor relations, who seem to regard him
as merely an animated cheque-book. The
play opens with the beginning of the month
the arrival of the fashionable family’s bills
and a burst of worse-than-usual temper on
the part of dada OVilliam J. Kelly). The
family (even the pampered worm will turn)
decides to ship dad off to his rubber planta-
tions up the Amazon, and have at least three
months of peaceful extravagance. The family
doctor (Cyril Mackay), in love with little
Eva, obeys that dutiful daughter’s injunction
to order dad away: and all is going well with
the conspirators when Uncle Horace I’ilgrim
exposes the whole plot to dad. Dad is so
enraged that he determines to go away, and
place his business manager, Adam Smith, in
charge of his household, with limited finances
How Adam gets rid of the fortune-hunting
doctor and unexpectedly proves Lord Andrew
Gordon (Kenneth Brampton) to be a true
lover although a penniless Scot ; how he tells
a tale of poppa’s ruin, and gets that family
to become hard-working, selLsupporting
chicken-raisers, clothes-salesmen and life-
insurance-agents : how he finally wins Eva
against a background of chicken-coops,
apparently leaving the left-overs, Andrew
and Corintha (Clarice Hardwicke), to con-
sole one another—this is the story, told in
the good old saccharine American way that
is as close to real life as modern American
“home brew" is to the best that Penfold’s
ever grew.
* * * *
The acting is pretty evenly good, but the
star honors go to Cyril Mackay as the suave
Dr. Delamater and to George Blunt as Uncle
Horace Pilgrim. Maude Ilanaford would
be a good excuse for Adam’s infatuation ii
she didn’t overwork her little half-gasping
laugh; she doesn’t let it have five minutes
off through the whole piece. Frank Harvey
looks handsome and convincing as the senti-
mental Adam who longs for a home; Aunt
Abbey Rooker adds another to Mrs. Brough’s
successes; and good work is done by Clarice
Hardwicke, Rodger Barry, Kenneth Bramp-
ton and Beryl Bryant.
When “Scandal” moved out of the Syd-
ney Criterion Humphrey Bishop moved in,
with an intriguing burlesque of the bedroom
play, among 'other things. These are days
tvhen Sydney is uncommonly interested in
bishops, and nobody will controvert the pro-
position that Joseph Brehann, Gelu liaaidie,
Louise Meadows, Edward Elliott and others
earn their dividends from the offertories,
whatever they may be.
To an overwhelming audience in the Syd-
ney Town Hall on Saturday night Jascha
Heifetz played in company with the State
Orchestra. TJjje somewhat intellectual
Tschaikowsky Concerto in D major was the
big work, and served well to show what some
people call the spiritual quality of Jascha's
fiddle. The house was tumultous in its
applause, and the further violin solos of
the evening—the Rimsky-KorsakofT “Hymn
to the Sun,” a Tschaikowsky Waltz and
Wieniawski’s Scherzo Tarantelle—raised
the audience to a crescendo of enthusiasm.
But Jascha didn’t move a muscle of his face.

Alexander Watson is in the second week
of his success at Sydney King’s Hall. Last
Saturday night his “Boots at the Holly-
tree Inn” was as inimitable as Dickens him-
self. Under his changeful voice Nora, aged
seven, in her sky-blue mantle, tucked under
the arm of her eight-year-old lover, climbing
the shadowy candle-lit stairs of the old inn,
became a clear-cut etching. Watson’s Kip-
jine: and Barrie and Mark Twain are fairy
wishing-carpets for transporting listeners to
new scenes. To-night is given to Dickens,
and Saturday night closes the season. *
“The Little Whopper” arrives at Sydney
Majesty’s on Saturday. All interest in the
details of the show, which has never before
been seen in Australia, has been swallowed
up by the news that Blanche Browne —
sometime this country’s beloved “Miss
Gibbs” —will return to musical comedy in it.

a typical Thomas Meighan picture: Tommy

but there is ever some loving spouse to pull
him back to righteousness, so watery fade-

on the programme. “Cousin Kate” is on

miles dfiring his recent Dominion tour, and
the camera-man trailed after him. The re-
sult is at the Palace —Billy Hughes and all.
The style of Annette Ivellerman’s show
is so pretty, and the personality of the ex-
Australian girl so pleasing, that Melbourne
Tivoli may expect a crowd of customers
during her stay, apart from any considera-
tion of a Katherine MacDonald film, super-
fluously added to the bill. In the second
part, for instance, the effect of a brief
“kaleidoscope” dance by two limelit damsels
clad harlequinwise is almost as charming as
two appearances of Annette in a dancing
capacity, Jbetween which turns is sandwiched
the vision of a young woman whose hair
hangs down her back as she blows a cornet.
Annette, toe-dancing on fake shoes, is not
Gen£e as regards the leg work, but her arm
waves and body sways couldn’t be more
graceful, apd the notion of a masked execu-
tioner to support her in her poses is essen-
tially artistic. It is as though he came on
with orders to cut Annette’s head off if she
failed to please, and was ultimately spell-
bound- by ■ her gracefulness and her smile.

“Oh, Lady, Lady!” is not to be shifted
from Melbourne Majesty’s, as was threat-
ened. That artless story of converted crooks
and queer complications, intercepted by
inoffensive songs and unexpected dances, will
continue at the old spot until further notice.
“The Lilac Domino” breaks out at Mel-
bourne Koyal on Saturday. The fact that
it is a comic opera which ran 150 nights in
Sydney has become ingrained in Melbourne
consciousness, and the new show, with some
new people in it, is awaited hopefully.
Levitzki, at Melbourne Town Hall, will
hold one more animated discussion with the
piano ere proceeding on his tour. Last
Saturday fie played a Beethoven sonata,
which is called “Pathetique” because a
famous symphony by Sneezowsky has taken
first call on the name in English; but why
a German composition should be spelt witL
a “que” is one of those musical mysteries
which only “souls” can explain. Anyhow,
the pianist knows his Beethoven very well,'
and is even happier with Chopin as a rule.’
One night last week he played “The Erl
King,” but in that high test of pianoforte
expression he wiped out no memories of
Carreno, not to mention Paderewski, whom
he is declared to have succeeded. But per-
haps that means that he only succeeds where
the other artist excelled.
A one-man show in Melbourne:—
J. W. Tristram, a founder of the school of which
J. J. Hilder was the most brilliant disciple, is mak-
ing his first Melbourne appearance at the Fine Art
Society’s gallery. The artist produces the delicacies of
tone and has the fondness for stealthy twilight effects
that made the brilliant Hilder famous, but his low
washes grow weak at times, and the consequence is
a watery transparency that damages the decorative
nuance he is trying to achieve. But this is only
noticeable in “Shadows Grey” and “The Deserted
Quarry"— two subjects that might still retain their
poetic quality with a little more help from the
color-box. In his nocturnes Tristram is insidiously
appealing. He doesn’t get the Hilder note of tender
melancholy, but bis depiction of the period between
sunset and nightfall is frequently distinguished by
an exquisite sense of the beauty of plain things in
u fading light. Two or three saplings, a trifle of
broken fence or a few scattered stones are practi-
cally all the details of these compositions, but the
color, the simplicity and the dexterous suggestion
of atmosphere give, them charm. Probably the most
alluring effort, is “Grey Landscape” (No. 28), but
there are several others, including some desirable
little moonscapes, that should set connoisseurs feel-
ing for their cheque-books before the show doses.

The love of a good woman is performing
a familiar miracle at Melbourne Majestic
this week. Hobart Bosworth, down, out
and apparently irrecoverable, is hauled back
to respectability by the usual angel and
becomes a candidate for a halo. Yet the
picture-fakirs evidently thought he was a
bad case, because the odds against his return
to decency are reckoned “A Thousand to
One.” In “An Arabian Knight” Sessue
I Jaynkawa turns out into the Kgyptian
desert, near Bos Angeles, and pretends a
fathomless a flotation for a romantic flapper
who regards him and herself as the reincar-
nation of a pair who snuggled and played
handies 2000 years ago. Hoyt’s are giving
screen space to a new Australian film, “A
Girl of the Bush,” which has a melodrama-
tic story, but brings the Outback to the
front in some excellent snapshots of cattle-
branding, sheep-dipping and other station
activities. In “All Dolled Up” Gladys Wal-
ton reveals an exuberant personality and a
charming countenance to atone for the feeble-
ness of the plot. In Hoyt’s third item,
Worlds Apart,” Eugene O’Brien, as the
rich lover, is most circumspect. He never
suggests that he wears his cheque-book next
his heart. Norma Talmadge, as “The
Branded Woman,” is the prevailing draw at
the Britannia. “Forbidden Fruit” is on
the menu at the Melba, and crowds are roll-
ing in to see if the leading charmer will
take a bite.

HONEYMOONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Speaking at a dinner Mr. George Lambert (recently
returned from England) said, “Australia is a stern,
hard land, whereas the local artists seem to turn
out renderings suggestive of honeymoons.”
’Twas Lambert spoke, “Your art is faint,”
Amid the forks and spoons;
“The tripe that local artists paint
Is just like honeymoons.”
Immediately, to queer the pitch,
A voice roared out, “Desist!
You babble of a state in which
J am a specialist! ”
And, sudden as an artichoke,
With wild and bloodshot eye,
An old bald-headed, married bloke
Talked fearsomely and high.
■“My first was spent with Lazy Kate,
A fat, bucolic queen;
A quiet, torpid sort o’ state —
Prevailing color, green.
“The next I tangled in my mesh
Was Sylvie. When we wed
Our honeymoon was post-impresh,
With blobs of vivid red.
“The next two ’moons, I grieve to say”—
Ho paused to quaff champagne—
“ Were filled with little landscapes grey
Composed of Maud and June.
“Then with a burst of orange chronic
And streaks of purple madder,
I took a full-grown barmaid home:
I wish I ’adn’t ’ad her.
“I flung her o’er the Gap and then,
The inquest safely through,
I vvedded little sehoolma’m Gwen—
Thisi honeymoon was blue.
“And then I took to wives at last
As drunkards take to dope;
The honeymoons went whizzing past
Like a kaleidoscope!
“Black Hooker’s green and cobalt blue
Across life’s sky they piled;
And some of them were quickly through,
And all of them were wild.
“And now you dare compare these stings—
These colored bursts of Hades—
With modest pussv-catty things
Designed by maiden ladies!
“liah!” and so turned upon his heel
With this contemptuous ban;
Amidst a silence you could feel
That ramping married man.
Half-stunned by that weird tale of moons
Stole out each bard and etcher;
And Lambert, after several swoons,
Departed on a stretcher.

“0.K.” : If Yeats’s “Land of Heart’s De-
sire” be a repertory play while “Belinda”
isn’t, 1 am in favor of cutting all rep. efforts
out of amateur theatrical hills. Yeats's play-
let, as performed at Melbourne Playhouse
recently, was a ridiculously tiresome thing,
nor could adequate stage management and
professional acting make it in any d gree
educational. There isn’t a new thought in
it. Its Christian dogma and superstition
are old, its incidental fairy is ages older than
Gilbert’s fairy comedies, its prosaic peasants
and village priest are older than Boucicault’s
melodramas. Such things are only permis-
sible on the stage as entertainments —and
they don't entertain. They bore. People
who talk admiringly of “symbolism and far-
awayness” as suitable subjects for amateur
theatrical treatment are talking cant. The
repertory theatre in Australia has never yet
been more than a school for stagestruck ama-
teurs, who went to see one another act and
implored their friends to do likewise. With
the amateur thespian element omitted from
the audience.the repertory “movement,” as
it is called, would never have got any sort of
move on. Let us he honest. Why talk non-
sense in the interests of literary drama?
Literary drama, as a rule, is not a paying
concern for the commercial theatre to bother
about, nor is it a truly interesting matter
wljien played by mostly amateurs. I have
been fairly well entertained by a few of the
“repertory” plays I have seen, but I usually

came away with the idea that “souls” who
crave for .the gloomy plays of unsuccessful
dramatists had better get them in printed
form, and read them. The interpretation of
important characters was often painfully
unlike my conception of them in cases w here
I took the trouble to conceive. As for alleged
“fine plays which are over the heads of the
public,” I deny that they exist. Clever dull
plays may fail to persuade public heads to
bother about them, but that is different from
being too intellectual for popularity.
“F Major” : Melbourne has been described
as an “unmusical city” because it is back-
ward in providing its share of the cash for
keeping the Verbrugghen Orchestra afloat.
The amount required, I understand, is about
£2OOO, and I suggest that the numerous
musicians w T ho are clamoring for the exist-
ence of the band should try the innovation
of writing out cheques, instead of preparing
for a descent upon the Philistines. In my
experience the person who rhymes Chopin
with furious work at the woodheap finds
most of the coin for these musical funds,
thereby demonstrating a larger generosity
than the scornful highbrows who consider
that an oration at a committee meeting or
a letter to the papers is all that may be
reasonably expected of them when a cadge is
being arranged. The truth is the musical
multitude become very wearisome. Their
meanness and intellectual snobbery are as
conspicuous as their impudence in claiming
national recognition for their art, regardless
of how the other arts fare. You will have
to toothcomb Melbourne to discover a
musician interested in literature or painting,
but writers and artists freely attend con-
certs, and moreover pay for their seats,
whereas some of the greatest advocates for
national orchestras, quartettes and the like
include the most hardened deadheads that
managers know\
“G.Y.”: About 15 years ago a Russian
pianist, Bollotin, brought to my studio in

tional Anthem, I recognised the poorly-clad,

my ivories in Antwerp in 190(1.
On the commercial side of the movies,:—
These moving-picture people squeal too much. Tt
is one of the reasons why they have so few friends.
A month ago they were squealing about the censor-
ship, the only sound objection to which is that it isn't
half strict enough. Now it is the duty of 3d. a
foot on foreign films, and again the public, which
sees huge cinema-theatres going up by the score, is
informed, with the usual hypocritical clamor, that
the Industry is on the verge of Roonation. And
Albert E. Iluckerby, general secretary of the Theatri-
cal and Amusement Employees’ Association (Vic.),
joins in the howl. “The Industry,” lie wails, “em-
ploys an enormous number of people.” How many
of them are full-timers? “We have 53 theatres in
our metropolitan area, employing something like
1500 members of this association ; and it [the new
duty] will mean that some of these places will close
down.” In the name of the prophet, figs!
A worthy fugleman of the film-importing interest
is Albert Huckerby. “A few pictures have been
produced in Australia,” he proceeds, “but have met
with only a certain amount of success. The field for
the sale of films as far as Australia is concerned is
limited. J. C. Williamson, Ltd., and also, I believe,
Mr. E. .J. Carroll have spent an enormous amount of
money to try and establish the film industry here,
but they have not been able to put the business on
a sound financial basis.” By an odd coincidence,
while Huckerby was penning these noble sentiments,
Steele Rudd was holding forth in quite a different
strain in Brisbane. “The Australian picture-produc-
ing industry,” said Rudd, “is only in its infancy,
but it will do a great deal for Australian writers, and
a good deal more for Australia generally, if it gets
a fair deal. At present it is getting quite the
reverse from the big proprietors. The cost of making
an Australian picture is anything between £4OOO
and £6OOO for a film of five to seven reels. Then
it has to be put on in the big places in the big
cities first, and. these are controlled by the combine,
which is in a position to ask whatever sum it likes
out of the gross takings. Then when it has taken
that lump sum out it deducts the expenses of run-
ning the theatre. Then only it thinks of dividing
the remainder, say, on a fifty-fifty basis. My recent
picture—‘Rudd's New Selection’—which went into
the combine’s theatres, was a success. The gross
takings for one week amounted to £2345. All we
got out of it was £519 as our share. Mr. Carroll
told me that under such circumstances the industry
could not survive in Australia. And I said I would
not have any more of my books ‘picturised.’ ”
A remark made by Riley, M.H.R., during the tariff
debate is significant. "If Mr. Jackson, the member
for Hass, were here to-day he would be able to
tell the committee his experience of running a pic-
ture-show. lie was not permitted to show an Aus-
tralian production, and was told that if he did so
he would not be supplied with American pictures.”
1\ hat would happen to a grocer who refused to stock
Australian sugar or jam, or to a bookseller who put
up the sign, “No Australian authors need apply”?
The makers of Australian pictures must be freed
from the unconscionable tyranny and arrogance ol
the film-importing interest. The threepenny duty
is a good start, but much more needs to be done.
“Fax”: Rudolf Dimmer, whose death was
mentioned last week, practically killed him-
self with Kaiser-worship, llis tongue was
so junkerish at the outset of the war that
none but Herman-blooded singing pupils had
any patience with the good-looking old
swanker. lie and his friend Edouard Scharf
stood around and talked of what Shermany
vos going to do with the Pritish Lion’s tail.
Scharf, who lost his university billet through
his indiscretion, left, the country as soon as
it was convenient for him to go, and resumed
his German nationality, but Ilimmer stayed
on and made a pathetic attempt to reassert
himself as a musical personage. Alas! Fond
parents talked of the number of line voices
that had lost their natural sweetness under
the tuition of one or other German professor.
“Where are the sweet German warblers?”
they asked. So the sun of poor Ilimmer, of
the warlike moustache, sank in a sea of sad-
ness.
Moses Baritz from Manchester :
Roy Agnew, the pale pianist of Sydney, is already
better known in England than in his native Aus-
tralia. When Moiseiwitsch returned from Sunshine-
land, he announced that lie was going to play a
few of Agnew’s compositions. The audience at the
Queen’s Hall, London, backed up the Russian’s high
opinion of the young man’s work. He played
Agnew’s delightful “Danoe of the Wild Men” and
lhe delicious “Diordre’s Lament” on Saturday, May
21, and they won golden opinions. 1 had the plea-
sure of hearing Agnew play about 15 months ago.
For two hours or more lie regaled me with preludes
that Debussy might have written, other composi-
tions that came near the standard of Brahms, others
again which in their well-developed imagination
combine some of the beauties and weirdness of
Scriabine and Ravel. He will not have to labor long
for recognition throughout Europe.
“Copy Boy” (London) : Fraser Gauge and
Amy Evans have just furnished the Daily
Express with a moving narrative of their
Australian adventures. At one place at
which they gave a concert (whether Sydney
or Mirboo North wasn’t mentioned) ' they
were prayed for by "a native preacher,”
while at another —vaguely referred to
as a “famous mining town”—“the des-
cendants of the red-shirt brigade varied
the monotony of the customary bou-
quets of flowers by casting gold nuggets at
Miss Evans’s feet.” It wasn’t stated whether
any of the missiles struck the lady, but as
1 happen to possess one or two shares in a
concern located in one “famous mining
town,” I would be obliged if the Wild Kit-
ten would ascertain where this painful event
came to pass. I hate to think of my poten-
tial dividends being squandered in such a
manner.
“Hamfat" : A very old actor I know still
carries a small tin-trunk which he had a
score of years ago. When I visited him
recently iu his room (he calls it “my apart-
ments”) I noticed it and said “Still’got the
old life-saver!” Whereupon he said: “My
boy, that trunk holds manuscripts of plays
which I estimate to be worth hundreds —
probably thousands —of pounds. My own
work, sir ! That and other valuable doc-u-
-ments. ’ He forgot that years ago he showed
me the contents. They consisted mainlv of
tea, sugar, tinned goods, and other ‘dry
groceries that would keep. He explained
then that he was an old actor who knew the
vicissitudes of the pro-fession, and wasn’t
to be caught; he stored his portable larder
in times of plenty so that when lean times
arrived he was prepared for them.
“O. Blin”: The most excruciating Hamlet
I ever saw was given at the Washout
Mechanics by the head on the Grogan Dra-
matic Co. Grogan was a martyr to sciatica,
the result of .sleeping in damp places
when pub beds were too expensive,
and on the night of his masterpiece
lus enemy had bent him double. Never-
theless he Hamleted heriocallv until the
gravevard scene, where Yorick’s brain-box
was presented for inspection. Grogan had
tne skull in his hand, and was about to
address it in the immortal lines, when he was
gripped in the hips. With his mind sud-
denly switched from his job to his disease
he groaned out feelingly: “Alas, poor Uric,
I know him well!”
England has struck a new idea in enter-
tainments —the gramophone lecture. The
idea is to take an opera—say “Faust”—
give reproductions of all the striking por-
tions, vocal and instrumental, accompanied
by remarks upon the artist who wrote the
music and the people who have produced it.
A selection can be made of the artists, so that
A LOVELY JOB.
THE GALLERY GIRL (at “The Liguori
Case"): “Fancy jurymen getting an
extra guinea a day and front seats re-
served for them and all. Shows it's
time tee had women on the jurics,
doesn't it?"
the audience gets a cast such as never was
on one stage for a single performance. Moses
Baritz, the remarkable man who spent some
time in Australia educating the international
ists and writing musical criticism for Thk
Bulletin, is in great demand as a lecturer,
and is already booked for a busy winter.
“Old I’ot”: Apropos the non-professional
production of “Ruddigore” (B. 30/6/’2l)
J.C.W. may be tempted to bring it out of
cold storage before long. Another of the
Gilbert series, but in musical association
with Edward German, which probably lies
side-by-side with “Ruddigore,” is “Fallen
Fairies.” It was produced at the Savoy in
1905); but somehow Gilbert’s verse didn’t
fit German’s music, or vice versa; and that
was the end of it.
“E.T.”: F. C. Philips, novelist and drama-
tist, died in London last month. His best
known play was “As in a Looking-glass,”
adapted from his book of the same name,
which went all round the world with Mrs.
Bernard Beere in the Camille-like leading
part. Philips, who had an eventful life, was
72 at the close of it.
“Hamfat”: Another Australian who has
made good in America is Jack McGowan,
After taking part in the S’African war he
set out on world wanderings and got a good
deal of experience in circus and show business,
including those excellent farcical dramas,
South American revolutions. He wrote and
directed the picture “The King of the
Circus,” now being shown in Australia, and
is a director of Universal Films. Hisfathcr
was a contractor from Scotland who made
money on some big railway jobs. His
brother Edward went west on Gallipoli,
and another brother is a picture-show man-
ager in Melbourne.
London, without any opera at Covent
Garden, was lately concentrating on the Carl
Rosa Co. at Hammersmith, where two Aus-
tralians, Beatrice Miranda and Eda Bennie,
figured regularly in important parts.
“Make Up”: We were favored a few years
back with a visit from an American star
whose most valuable assets, off stage and on,
were an enthusiastic and pushing little wife
—his third venture in matrimony—and a
studious, intent, almost taciturn cast of
features. Though he had changed his wives
so frequently, the mummer never changed the
expression of his face. It became a kind of
trade-mark. On the first night everything
went well. The piece scored a success; the
leading-man was a hit. Behind the scenes
his recently-wedded wife had busied herself
all the evening. Though occasionally getting
in the way of the working staff, she infused
no end of joyousness and vim into the pro-
ceedings. At the end of the piece there were
many calls for the star. With set face he
bowed low to the storm of applause. His
spouse, all excitement, had invaded the
“prompt corner,” and at the second call
shouted out to him “Smile, Willie, smile!
Tip them a smile!”
LAMENT
Over a theatre that has gone into the shades.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Here I have heard the grand old dames
Who sang in “Faust” and “Trovatore.”
A column list ot' goodly names
Would not exhaust the men who wore
The sock and buskin on this stage—
The Hamlets and Othellos whom
I’ve seen exhort, and pray, and rage
In what now seems a bygone age:
All, all have gone into the gloom !
Here first 1 heard the tuneful strain
Of Sullivan who music wove
About the rhymes of Gilbert’s brain.
These two with merry magic drovt
Black sorrow front our blood. All da,.
We felt the joyanee, and might see
The happy jest’s delightful play ;
And all a countryside was gay
With titillating melody.
Here good men for our pleasure gate
The throb of passion and the beat
Of human hearts, the weak and brave ;
But now the films have rule complete.
Hero creatures wove of flesh and blood
O’er raptured souls have held a sway;
But where they living, breathing stood
In all their gifted womanhood,
Now see the vapid shadows play!

More than once at Flemington last Satur-
day the smash of falling records could be heard.
Even In the opening Lawn Handicap, a flutter over
six furlongs, the time was within Isec. of the New-
market Handicap record —linin. 12isec. —scored by
Queen o’ Scots on the same course. And seeing that
Molly’s Robe carried 9st. 101 b. as compared with
7st. 91b. for Queen o’ Scots, the latest performance
spoke well for the levelling of the “straight six.”
Over the sticks the times made were remarkable.
When Telecles won the Doutta Galla Hurdle (the
blundering of Gold Coin making things easy for the
Poseidon horse) he clipped 4see. off Bright Plume's
record for 2j miles. And when Mountain God got
home in the G. N. Steeple the board showed Gmin.
12)sec., or 3J sec. better than the record credited
to lolaus a year ago. Three years back old Cobram
took Gmin. 32)see. over the job. A difference of
20sec. in the times for two Nationals reminds one
that steeplechases are slow or fast, according to
whether the speedy ones fall or stand up. lolaus
was in the field again this time, but he had 261 b.
more to carry, nor was he in quite such good nick
as before.
Cotswold was responsible for the Gmin. 12}sec. To
the astonishment of the crowd, who had seen him
shaping like a stale one of late, the son of Sylvan
King showed the form which enabled him to run
away with two steeplechases at Randwick a month
ago. For about 2J miles Cotswold had the field chas-
ing him. Then stamina became the all-important
thing, and old Doiran was pushed into the lead, with
Mountain God and Wooloo still in the rear of the
tiring pacemaker. But they also had passed him
before coming to the last jump, where Doiran had
a lead of four or five lengths. > Mooney, on the
S’Australian horse, rode a good race, seeing that
he had no chance of winning save by going his
darnedest at the last jump with the hope of bring-
ing his brighter rival down. Mountain God was
bound to beat him on the flat if he cleared the last
difficulty, though it seemed just as certain that
Doiran would beat Wooloo, a labored goer in his
most recent outings. Wooloo, however, was the
surprise of the race. Mountain God caught Doiran
before turning into the straight from the steeple-
chase course, and as the favorite strode along he
looked the proverbial eert. Meanwhile Wooloo was
outpacing poor old Doiran, and when it came to
the last 60 yards he was gaining so distinctly on
Mountain God that the leader seemed to be tiring
more than he actually was. The good thing lasted
long enough to win by a couple of lengths, for the
pursuer’s flue run was hardly maintained to the
bitter end. Doiran repeated his third place of last
year, lolaus was fourth and then Cotswold. They
were the only five that counted in the race. Adolph
and Monrose fell early, Lumut and Miss Rosslyn
fell later, and Cobram and Algous were never really
in it. Algous showed that his recent dead-tired way
of proceeding was quite natural to him. as Two
Blues had shown in the Doutta Galla Hurdle. When
these ancient geldings go off color they are very,
very off.
The rush to back Wooloo a quarter of an hour
before the start for the National was one of the
most significant features of the betting, but it didn’t
appear to impress the books. They couldn’t quite
see Wooloo winning, anyhow. He never was bril-
liant, and with lOst. 91b. up he was not likely to
cause a surprise. All the same, the baelcers must
have known something.

Although not a blow has been struck, a
few spec doubles excepted, the Svdnev bookmakers
have determined the favorites in the big Soring
Handicaps. They are: "Epsom Handicap. Beauford ;
Metropolitan, Eurytbmie: Caulfield Cup. Violoncello;
Melbourne Cup, Violoncello. Sam Hordern pulled
Quinologist's half-brother out of the Epsom and
Metrop. almost as soon as the weights appeared. He
couldn't help it, after seeing the difterenee in opinion
of the N.S.W. and Vic. handieappers.

The winner of the first prize in Tatt.’s
Sweep on tne Winter Stakes is a Hoolumon (N S.W.)
schoolboy, who got the money for the lucky invest-
ment from the sale of rabbit-skins, lie gave niS
mother and father a half-share in the ticket: but
he has a. 2500 less tax to commence life with.
“Nemo”: At Victoria Park (Sydney)
last trotting meeting Globe Derby won the A.T.C.
Handicap, and two of his sons, His Pal and One
Step, won successively the first division of the
Encourage Handicap and the Flying Mile. They
are all owned by J. Corby and were all steered by J.
Williams. A record?
“Yarra Ben”: At the Richmond (Vic.)
“ponies” last week John Wren made a six-hour day
of it. Racing started at 12.30 and finished at 5.30.
There were 16 events. One was run in six beats and
a final, and, to quote the Arcus, “The race suited
the bookmakers, as with one exception all the seven
favorites were beaten.” If this kind of thing did «of
suit the bookmakers vve should soon see an end of it.
Queensland’s Turf Club’s receipts of
£102,080 showed a net profit of a; 11,005 last year.
The club will dispose of some of the surplus among
owners during the coming season.
Governor Weigall (S.A.) is not going to
become a racing-owner, after all. The Pistol-80. tess
filly which he so much fancied has gone back to
Richmond Park, arid no other embryo champions are
being considered. He has the money to run a stable
and all the inclination in the world; but. holding
the job he does in the place he is in, he lacks the
nerve.

In the second round of the City Cup
last Saturday, at Sydney Cricket Ground, Balmain
licked North Sydney by 20 points (4 tr.es 4 goals)
to 2 points (1 goal), this being Norths’ first defeat
si,ire the Dockers vanqui< hed them In the first
round of the 1920 premiership. ’Mains reorganised
their rearguard for the occasion, and Norths played
young Cuneo instead of their star half, Dune Thomp-
son. The Norths’ forwards, headed by Farnill and
Ives, worked hard, and Geo. Green, as rake, snared
the leather with great regularity; but Border and
Blinkhorn absolutely refused to be brought into the
argument. The four Red and Black three-quarters
are members of the team chosen for the Cold Country
tour, ai cl are evidently scared of becoming casual-
ties. Fraser was the best man on the grass, and
fully vindicated his selection as vice-captain of the
expeditionary side. In the other games Easts headed
St. George by 28 to 5, Newtown walloped Wests by
15 to 7, Glebe accounted for Souths by 10 to 5, and
’Varsity drew the bye.
On Saturday ’Varsity did what they liked
with the hitherto unbeaten Easts, who lead in Syd-
ney Rugby Union competition by one point from
Manly. Black, on the wing for Uni., unwound a
deadly tackle, arid nothing got past him, and Walters,
the five-eighth, initiated many fine- clashes. Nothling.
as is usual in these games, was like a bank, and in
addition kicked an impossible goal. Manly beat
Glebe-Bulmain in a fluctuating game. There was
not much between the teams save the weakness of
one of the G.-B. players. Mingay was outshone by
Chambers, who played a great game; and Erasmus
and Mayne were a splendid attacking medium for
0.-8., and Elliott was easily the best forward on
the ground. Wests accounted for Newtown . easily
enough, Shute and Wogan playing fine football for
the winners. McKay stood out from the Newtown
battlers. Old Boys played their best game to date
against Norths, despite the look of the score—34
to 15. They carried out several dashing evolutions
right to their legitimate end. and in these Phillips,
Christie and Hall sparkled. Cooney, of Norths, played
one of his occasional fine games, and Oatley and
Sheppard were always prominent.
From now on the Melbourne football
crowd will go where Carlton plays ; for the Old Blues
are r o far undefeated. On Saturday they were at
home to the Richmond Tigers, and rubbed in memories
of the thrashing administered previously by handing
out a real dirty doing—99 points to Richmond’s 48.
Up % to. the last term the
Tigers were but 15 points
in arrear, but thence to the
end only one team counted,
Carlton piling on 37 points
to the enemy’s one! ’Roy,
which so far bad managed to
win but one game this season,
surprised all present by scor-
ing as many goals as the
Magpies and nine more be-
hinds —65 points to ’Wood's
56. Essendon. strengthened
by a few recruits from the
defunct North Melbourne team,
got Melbourne down early,
and kept them there, finishing
with 80 points to 54. South
naturally opted St. Hilda—
-87 points to 74. As things
are, Carlton. ’Wood and Rich-
mond are practically certain
to get into “the four,” and
Geelong is trving to keep
South out of that select com-
pany.
FRANK REID,
who has been secre-
tary of the Essendon
Club (Vic. League),
for 14 years.
Under Australian rules at Brisbane on
Saturday Queensland defeated N.S.W. by 100 points
to 76. The Norf'e-ners took the lead from the
bounce, and led 56 —28 at balf-tf rr, e. In tv. geonn I
quarter N.S.W. lost Kruschert with a broken hand.
McCaul, Q.'s captain, kicked six out of his side’s
14 goals, and Skuce and Gingell got three each.
Evans, of N.S.W., booted five.
The Springboks’ tour in M.L. is extensive.
Three tests wiH be played—at Dunedin, Auckland
and Wellington—and there are 14 fixtures against
district XV’s.
A. J. van Heerden, the flying three-quarter
of the Springboks, is a great athlete at home.
Last year he won the S’African 120yds. hurdles
(16sec.) and 440yds. hurdles (58 l-ssec.) champion-
ships. He has a leautiful stride and style, and his
height (6ft. 11 in.) is a big help when the touch-
line is near. He represented S’Africa at the Olympic
games at Antwerp last year, but didn't show out
prominently owing to a strain. Australia will pro-
bably see the living Dutchman back again for the
Australasian championships at Adelaide next year.
REASON ENOUGH SURELY.
THE BOY : “So you have left the old club!"
THE BRUNETTE: “Oh, yes; its colors only
suit brondes.”
The Lancashire match pointed to at least
one of the Hungs taut aie wrong with iiaigusu
cricket. Bardsiey, who made 71, was missed twice,
the first time when he was only 18. Taylor (30)
was missed th-ee times. And Hendry was Lau.y
missed in the long field at 24. With it all the Aus-
tralians compiled only 284. Such mistakes have a
disastrous effect on the moral of tne side that
uumes mem. Tne Lancasffire batsmen collapsed piti-
ably before Gregory and Hendry in the first innings
and Gregory and JiluLey in the second, and considera-
tion of the team’s Lad performance in the field no
doubt had a lot to do with it.
The XI that met the travellers at Glasgow on
Saturday would be unrecognisable as a ciass side
but for the presence of Carr and the two Gunns
from Notts. Its status may be gleaned from the
fact that the skipper went on at an early stage with
underhand lobs —and incidentally bad bad luck not
to immediately get Mayne, who eventually collected
69. Bardsiey kept up his average with a 74 that
might well have been cut short in its youth. He
has had his fair share of luck in this tour. The
feature of the big Australian score was Ryder’s 129,
which ssems to have been pretty nearly chanceless.
The Victorian is in great batting form just now and
is beautiful to watch in such circumstances.
When McDonald scored his 21 not out in
the third Test, a new record was established in
cricket history. The deed lifted his tally to 111
runs for 11 completed innings, making his average
10.1, and simultaneously giving every member of the
Australian ,XI a double-figure batting average.
McDonald, by the way, with a batting average
in Test games of 48, stands fourth on the combined
list of Australian and English batsmen in this
department. He has been twice n.o.
•* * • •
Writing in the Manchester Guardian
“Cricketer ’ (who is Neville Cardus) discourses plea-
santly on the difference between Australian and Eng-
lish styles of play. In Australia, he says, the hard
turf and the white light tend to produce standard-
isation of technique and the predominance of one
type. In England, on the other hand, “we have a
variable climate, and. as a consequence, a variable
technique. A man is at Lord’s one day in sun-
shine on a turf of lightning pace—to-morrow he is
in the mud and mire at Bramall-lane. Diversity
of setting assists towards diversity of style. These
material factors alone, leaving out differences of tem-
perament. would explain the collectivism of Aus-
tralian cricket and the individualism of English
cricket.” To “Cricketer” Armstrong is “the Aus-
tralian all over.” At the wicket “he bespeaks vigi-
lance, suspicion, determination. His batsmanship has
a quite cruel sort of toughness. Not graceful, but
thrilling to watch all the same. The Australian
game is not as attractive as ours, but it is hardier.”
And evidently more effective.

Frank Burns, who met Tommy Uren at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, possesses a
tremendous reputation—at Newcastle. During the
past 12 months or so he has come to be regarded
there as another Les Darcv. He is not that by
miles, but he has plenty of time yet—he looked a
good 10 vears younger than Uren when they shook
hands. He began in the first round bv dropping
the middleweight champion with a wicked left hook.
After that Uren decided it was wisest to box the
youth. Also he seemed to consider it good general-
ship to do as much fouling as Joe Wallis would stand.
He held and hit with much earnestness, and in this
way did a lot to wear the visitor down. He was
well ahead on points, though always in danger and
often in distress, when a right hook found his jaw.
He went down, out to the world, but had his wits
about him half-way through the count, and was
getting up when it ended. The ringside crowd made
deafening lamentations, and talked of a short count;
but the fact that many of them had laid three to
one on the loser may have accounted for a good deal
of the distress. So passed the middleweight crown
of Australia. The new wearer may not retain it
for long, but if he loses it to-morrow he should get
it back the day after. He has many of the Qualities
of a fighter.

Melbourne is beginning to think that it
has produced a world-beater in Jimmy Semmens, the
Vic. bantam champion. In any case, Semmens pro-
mises to be a worthv opponent for Ledoux when (or
if) that doughty little Gaul comes thi9 way. At
the Stadium on Saturday night Jimmy got all over
“Packy” McFarlane, of N. S. Wales, and in the Bth
a tender-hearted referee stopped it. Probably Mac
could have gone on a few rounds longer, but he had
taken the father of a hiding, and his prospect of
getting a haymaker past the Semmens defences was
faint.

An attempt is being made to revive box-
ing in Adelaide. Harry Holmes (Syd.) heat Harry
Swift (Melb.) mainly by battering away at his ribs
till the towel was thrown in in the 12th. “Red"
Mitchell (S.A.) had more science than Jim Dale
(Vie.), but he also had more years and less weight,
and 10 rounds were enough for him. Another fight
at Austral Gardens carried the welter championship
of South Aus. Mitr hell showed more skill, but his
punch was not deadly, and Sogar finished him off
in the 13th.
Horace Rice won two more tennis titles
last week —the hard-oonvt sine) ° ’’id do >des f'v't'i
R. V. Thomas) at Dubbo (N.S.W.). The veteran
showed a return to the form of many years ago. The
find of the meeting was J. Bailey, of Urange. a tall,
bronzed player who got to the finals of three
championships. In the women’s matches. Miss Jonn
Scott won the singles, doubles with sister Gwen, ami
mixed doubles with D. Yeo.
* * # *
Randolph Lycett, who was again unable to
reaeli the singles finals in the championships at
Wimbledon, managed with Woosnam to capture the
doubles from the Lowe brothers in three sets. As
the Americans Garland and Williams, who won the
doubles last year, did not appear, the doubles cham-
pionship goes to the new pair, and will remain their
property so long as they can defend it. This is
Lycctt’s first big win in England, though he was
an Australasian doubles champion as far back as
1000. With Miss Ryan, the Californian expert.
Lvcctt beat Max Woosnam and Miss Hawkins for
the mixed doubles trophy in two sets, whereof the
latter pair won onlv three games. The ineormwr-
able Suzanne Lenglen again ran home in the ladies'
singles. When she comes to Australia, as she has
promised to do, the problem will be to find suitable
opponents.
» s * *
Although the English Lawn Tennis Assoc.
lias accepted Lycett s explanation of his much-criti-
cised behavior against Shimidzu in the Wimbledon
tennis tournament, it is still doubtful whether lie
will appear in the British team that is about to
leave for America. A recent cable announces that
F. G. Lowe, Woosnam, Turnbull and Gilbert have
been invited to go over, and the team is limited to
four. , « * »
S.A. Amateur Athletic Assoc, makes the
usual complaint of lack of interest on the part of
the public, the championships having meant a loss
of £6O. Sport, however, is booming, there being
now 16 clubs affiliated ; long-distance running—
formerly a blank in Adelaide —lias been taken up
with enthusiasm, mainly by veterans who learned
the game in England. Boxing is now included in
the programmes. The Australasian championships
are due in Adelaide (for the first time) during the
coming year.
Forty-five of N. S. Wales’s best amateurs
turned out for the A.A.A. three-mile road-raoe at
Hurstville (Sydney) on Saturday. F. J. Phelps
(2niin.) hung out long enough to win by 4sec.
from J. H. Dillon (50sec.). W. Porter (lOsec.).
who finished sixth, made fastest time (lGmin.
35sec.) ; and H. L. Sheaves (scr.) was 13th in
lGmin. 474 sec. The handieappers didn’t give the
scratch men a dog's chance.
With Murdoch removed to Sydney and
Tom Cheadle ill, the golf championship of the Seaton
Club (and practically of South Aus.) seemed a good
thing for Legh Winser, Inter-State wicketkeeper and
A.D.C. But the Struggle was very keen. In the
semi-finals he beat Digby Giles only oil the last
green, while Swift had to play an extra hole to
win from Forbes. The final was a matter of long
driving by Winser and clogged recoveries by Swift,
with erratic putting on both sides. Winser won by
two up and one to play.
Adelaide lacrosse is much as usual this
season; that is, Sturt a bit too good for East
Torrens, and either of them too good for everybody
else; Universitv 3rd. Hopkins, a pre-war Adelaide
player, writes from Oxford that he threw three goals
of the 13 to 2 by which the ’Varsity beat Cambridge,
and that he has been appointed captain for next
season.
John Douglas, the elder, father of crick-
eter J.W.H.T.D., lias a younger son, C.H., or
“Pickles.” He is following in father’s footsteps, and
has annexed the old man’s place as referee at the
National Sporting Club’s big boxing contests in
London.

FAMOUS VICTORIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dempsey defeated Carpentier easily in four
rounds... .‘lt wds a great figat,’ said the winner.”
“A great fight,” murmured Dempsey as he gathered
up the purse, '
“His left swing only missed by twenty feet.
He nearly hooked me twice; but still it might have
been much worse—
I might have got less dough or met defeat.”
“A great race,” neighed Eurythmie, as he cantered
up the straight
To pas 3 the post two hundred lengths ahead;
“I’m sure I’d have been beaten had I had a pound
more weight”—
He winked his eye—“or if 1 had been ‘dead.’ ”
“A great game,” quoth Mcllaggis, as he holed a
twelve-foot putt,
► Which brought him home ten up and nine to play.
“If he hadn’t sliced his niblick or done that final
cut —
He made me play my hardest, anyway.”
“A great game,” chortled Warwick as he warmly
wrung the hand
Of Johnny Douglas. “England went great guns.
The way you fellows battled with adversity was
grand;
We only won by fifteen hundred runs.”
The moral of this story (that’s to say if there is one)
Seems to be: “Knock your opponent off the roost,
Then grasp his hand and bellow, ‘A grand fight’
(when you have won),
For the greatest game of all's the game of
‘boost.’ ”

Nal Ber Majesty's These
On the final day of the Grand National
there was a packed crowd at Flemington. The
Karl went out with the Countess and Aide
Haggard of the Navy. They lunched with
the stewards . and only had a nodding
acquaintance with the formal vice-regal pen.
Kady Stradbroke wore a coat of velour with
straight panels of mole fur. The Gaud
Mayor had a good win on the Hurdle-and-
Steeple double, llis lady, in a brown frock
and an excited air, poured out libations of
tea and champagne in the afternoon. Young
Womersley, who owns Wooloo, was much
f6ted for his sensational second in the
Steeplechase, lie came out in two pairs
of socks —pink silk over purple silk—a novel
way of sporting his racing colors. Mrs.
Mills brightened the birdcage with a coat-
frock of Robin Hood green. Dr. Joyce
was in evidence, looking much better for his
health-wanderings. Mrs. Staughton, from the
Western District, came in a perfectly tailored
black cloth checked with huge squares of
scarlet; she wore gaiters to her knees
and her brolly had a vivid red jade handle.
Edmund Jowett’s pale yellow suede gloves
were perfect, and he left the five-guinea
suit at home. Mrs. Alan Currie found fox
furs and navy cloth a good combination.
Mrs. Mawallok Russell was in glistening
black. Mrs. Eric Byron Moore mixed squir-
rel furs with purple chiffon cloth. Mrs.
Lauchlan Mackinnon staggered under (he
weight of a coat in two furs. Mavis Cliirn-
side turned up the brim of her hat with a
magenta feather. Fiscorn’s owner, Moore-
house, was there with his tall lady, she wear-
ing a wonderful fur coat over a one-piece
frock. They gave a dinner-party at Scott’s
before the theatre as the last of the junket-
ings. Mrs. Hayden Starke challenged the
color craze with a hat of brilliant turquoise.
Mrs. Rupert Greene had navy cloth and
black satin pieced together in a fascinating
way. The Hennessy lady wore henna
feathers in a wreath, and had big henna
circles embroidered on her black cloth dress.
The youngest daughter sported a Parisian
toque and a narrow frock neatly knife-
pleated.
The opening of the Session at the State
House put a little pomp into Race Week,
but the Wednesday meeting clashed with
the Parliamentary show, and sporting coun-
try-women chose Flemington. Still, the
ladies’ gallery was crowded. The Earl got
through his job in record time and then
streaked for the horses. The sick Countess
made a brilliant re-appearance with a striking
scarlet feather turban topping the straight
lines of her beaver tailorings; and Lady
Helena Rous, in a carnation pink hat, took
a. back seat after a long spell of opening
things for mamma. Speaker John Mackey
and his lady gave the usual tea-party. She
wore a frock of green velvet with little jet
aviator wings straight across the upturned
brim of her turban. The Chauvel lady took
the cold look off her pale blue silk frock by
muffling in musquash. These tea-parties
always draw a number of menfolk. Besides
the members there were Chancellor Mac-
r arland and various ‘Varsity profs., Big-
nigger Monash, alert young General Stanley
who defies Time, Gellibrand of the Police
Dr. Sugden and Dr. Gilruth. Hennessy him-
self came along, and his lady had a colleen
or two in her wake. The Speaker’s school-
girl daughter Joyce was in vivid turquoise
blue wool with a black hat.
A cheque for £3OO .will be divided between
the Alfred Hospital and City newsboys as
the loot from the Charity Ball at Green-
knowe, Toorak, which was lent for the occa-
sion by the Bob Knox pair. The frivol wore
a first-grade party aspect, the dance floor
being a garden of sweet young things and
heavenly chiffonery. If a shortage of boys
sent coveys of the prettiest girls to perch dis-
consolately in the dressing-room, it was
nobody’s fault. A light supper was served
up on old mahogany in the dining parlor,
and eaten mostly with antique silver spoons.
Mrs. Bob Knox was attractive in trailing
draperies of gold-flecked black, richly pan-
elled with blue, and her brown locks were
girded with diamonds. Norman Bayles's
wife was absent owing to the death of
Edward Officer, her cousin by marriage, but
her ex-political husband was there and obvi-
ously enjoyed it. General White and his
dame watched the dancing sedately from the
fhstness of a sofa. Mrs. Leslie Stuart, in
black trappings, clutched a bouquet of pan-
sies, given her as a present, which, according
to her two chicks, made her “look like a
banana.” Chicks are terribly severe on
maters these days. The Alec Russell matron
struck a new note on the dance floor with
winte satin draperies covering the ankles.
Art and the squattocraey have lost their
strongest link by the passing of Edward
Cairns Officer, of Macedon. Son of Sue-
tonius Officer and grandson of that Sir
Robert Officer who introduced trout into
Tasmania, and of Dr. Cairns, of Chalmers
Kirk, East Melbourne, he had guid forebears.
Returning to the wattle, after a long absence,
only a year or two before the war, he sold
every picture he painted during the Big
Trouble to swell the Red Cross funds. Not
being a wealthy man this was done at a
considerable sacrifice, and he got too little
kudos for it. His widow, who has been in
indifferent health for some time, is the
youngest daughter of the late surgeon Thomas
Fitzgerald.
The hand of sympathy goes out to Major-
(leneral Tivey in the loss of his wife. She
died after several weeks’ illness following
on an appendicitis operation. Mrs. Tivey,
who was one of the best-liked matrons in
Melbourne, worked ceaselessly for the sol-
diers while her husband helped in France.
Her death is a cruel loss for her small son
and daughter, who idolised her. She was
the younger daughter of the late John Robb
of Toorak.
It is not expected that Hood, J., will con-
tinue on the Supreme Court Bench after the
vacation which terminates on July IS. His
Honor is 75, and has worn the judicial wig
for 51 years, lie has been as near tin* ideal
Judge as Vic. is likely to get. Well-equipped,
just, dignified, aloof, industrious and free
from prejudice, he has maintained the Court’s
best traditions, and the State will cheerfully
pay him his pension of £l5OO a year.
Our Earl is to be the chief guest at a
Parliamentary banquet—for which the
State will pay—on July 10.
There was a great gathering of the Winter
Irving family to farewell Baroness von Omp-
teda before she left by the Narkunda for the
Orient. There this Winter Irving daughter
will shed her Herman title and become the
spouse of Captain Stringer of the 18th Royal
Irish Regiment. The night before sailing
the clan fed together at the Oriental, amid
decorations of mauve and violet, the colors
of a widow-bride.
The Arts and Crafts, who carry on their
show of work in the upper regions of Clyde
House, hope some dav soon to have a down-
town shop. To help things along, Mrs.
Charles Courtenay arranged a loan and
gift exhibition in Queen’s Hall, Collins-street.
Miss Butchart and artist Jessie Traill are
helping; also the potters, Merrie Boyd and
Alan Findlay. As well as local work, the
show contains some exhibit objects—baskets
from natives in the Islands and from North
America, South Africa, India, Arabia and
Korea are shown as examples of design.
There is a fine range of Australian-made
articles, from bronze and pottery to book-
bindings and rugs for floor covering.
Vida Sutton, L.A.8., an Australian born
at Broken Ilill, got some of the Bar-
rier silver into her voice. The clever young
person, pictured here by Elizabeth ‘Nash
Boothby, is a dra-
matic soprano, and
she seems on the
way to make a con-
siderable name for
herself. In her early
teens she bagged the
gold medal for
singing given by the
Royal College an d
the Royal Academy
o f Music, London,
and, studying at the
Elder Con. in Adel-
aide, won her
L.A.B. degree two
years later. Then
she had Melba help-
ing her at the
Albert-street Con. in
Melbourne, where
she studied unde r
Mary Campbell. She has appeared with
much effect at the Vic. Liedertafel and North-
cote concerts; and Perth and Hobart as well
as Adelaide and Melbourne have applauded
her.
On Friday afternoon the Athenaeum Hall
was crowded for the opening of Christine
Asquith Baker’s exhibition of paintings, but
local artists were noticeably absent. Miss-
Baker got her first training at our National
Gallery; then, after studying under Philip
Fox. she spent some years at the Julius
sti.c >in Paris. Later she exhibited several
times at the Salon, Royal Academy, etc.
The Royal Portrait Society handed a fine
compliment to t!’.' little Victorian when,
after her show at Ba‘ley’s Gallery, it asked
her to exhibit a pastel at its annual affair.
Two were sent to choose from, and both
were hung. Christine is a cousin of ex-Premier
Asquith. But she can’t help that.
Although money is not too plentiful and
generosity has sagged of late, a committee
of citizens decided last week to try to raise
£20.000 towards meeting the responsibility
of "adopting” Villers-Bretonneux, which Bill-
m..made a of undying glorv. General
Gellibrand was made president, and possiblv
he can think of a plan, but £20,000 takes a
iot of getting, as the organisation for helping
the Blind Institute knows.
Customs Minister Massy Greene, who has
m >en L strenuous months in piloting the
lanft through the Heps., has been com-
manded by his colleagues to take a spell, so
he is starting off to his seaside cottage at
Brunswick Heads, up near the Queensland
border.
, Emily C harlwood, the presswoman whom
, “| s . photo faithfully depicts, was the power
behind Raymond ParerJs story of his aerial
night. Lowell Thomas was the instigator
of the book ; he went
to Miss Charlwood
and asked her to
help the bashful
y oung lieutenant
tell his story in
print. Extracting in-
formation from her
retiring little hero
was a tough task,
hu; the hook is
ready at last. Emily
Charlwood is a lov-
able personality—a
sister-in-ink who is
never denounced as
a cat. Nob o d v
would think, to look
at her, that she has
been doing editorial
work on Ta» i. e
Talk for more than 20 years. Time is
very good to good women who keep busy.
Men who used to .speak kindly of “little
Aiikernian, ’ the (’ollins-street tobacconist,
will .speak more kindly of him since he died
and left a will. The simple-minded little
identity, who went stone-blind in his latter
days, seems to have had no family ties. The
few thousands he left were bequeathed to
friends and charities, and in his charities
Havnl (said to be a Belgian Jew) showed the
proper spirit. Every sect and every sort of
institution gets a cheque, and the residue
goes to Melbourne Hospital Sunday Fund.
Walter Kirby has been awakening silvery
echoes around Mount Gambier (S.A.). The
Mayor and Mayoress gave him a civic recep-
tion, then invited the leading lights to meet
him at supper after his song-recital. On
the second day the Mayor spread himself
on a lake motor picnic. Mrs. Mirrie Cowle,
wife of a banker at the Mount, also enter-
tained the artists. She is an artistic soul,
and before her marriage was a professional
musician in the Apple Island. .She arranged
the tour, and at his concert Kirby sang one
of her songs, “The Morrow’s Morn.” Soprano
' era Carew and pianist Isabel Stewart
helped in the recitals. The trio scored an-
other success at Coleraine.
As a pat on the back for the practical
interest he has shown in Newman College at
the ’Varsity and in the Foundling Hospital
at Broadnieadow.s, Father Quilter. of St.
Francis’s, Lonsdale-street, has been made
an archpriest. Father O’Meara, a predeces-
sor at this the mother Catholic Church of
Melbourne, held a similar title.
In his maiden speech in the Uppah
Chambah, Cohen, K.C., advocated not only
deductions for children in assessing State
income-tax, but the abolition of exemptions
for single men. Naturally Cohen has an
admiration for tine families with a fair pro-
portion of athletic sons—sons who, like two
of his own, can win boatraces for their
school. There are some childless men in
V ictoria who would willingly pay a tre-
mendous income-tax to feel the pride Cohen
must have had when his two lads helped
Scotch Col. to win the present and past
boys’ events on the Barwou last May.
Actor Arthur Styan’s handsome wife is
taking notice again after six weary weeks
on the sick-list with typhoid.
Mrs. George Bruce, better known by her
pen-name, which is also her married name,
Minnie Grant Bruce, climbed off the sick-
list last week and hurried back to her hus-
band’s Gippsland allotment to be greeted
rapturously by her two small sous. The
family reunion was shadowed, however, by
the loss of the baby-sister who died a few
hours after the Stork brought her in.
The Primrose dames of the inner circle
of the A.W.N.L. are at loggerheads, and
some of them have become quite catty over
it. Mrs. Arthur Robinson, wife of the
Attorney-General, has thrown up the vice-
presidentship of the central executive be-
cause she objects to the pre-selection of
candidates. The first explanation given that
ill-health was the cause was scornfully repu-
diated by her friends. The squabble may
lead to reforms in the league’s constitution
and changes on the executive. Many mem-
bers would be prepared to believe any polite
explanation supplied if some of the unpro-
gressives would bow themselves out.
Hobart is in the fashion with a police-
woman. The first Johanna Hop is Mrs.
Priest, who ran a State school in the saw-
mill country. A woman who can manage
a school in those parts can tackle anything.
A returned tripper gushes of the appear-
ance in a big Californian hotel of Mareeiin.
u Alroy, who showed oft the gladdest

Australia. Mareeline, whose frocks are said
to have stunned Californian Sassiety recalls
Marguerite Leroy, the daughter of‘an Eng-
lish parson, and a specialty dancer for "the
Firm some years ago. After leaving the
Williamson management she joined one of
Branscombe’s concert parties, subsequently
taking a salary from the Fullers for a song-
andance turn with a couple of male partners
She is a dark-haired, attractive charmer of
considerable education, and could safely pose
as a I‘arisienne owing to her surprising
knowledge of the language.
When last heard of, Irma Caron had been
through the Panama (’anal and was looking
forward to a long talk with Aunt Irma (the
late Leon Caron’s sister), who dwells at
Dijon. The songstress and her husband will
run across to France for that purpose after
arriving in London. Auntie lives with a
daughter who holds French ’varsity degrees,
and is, in fact, a professor of her native lan-
guage; so if Irma junior has any misgivings
about her grammar and accent, the cousin
will put her at rest. By the way, the
wonderfully versatile young woman is said
to be making great strides in her violin-
playing now.
Adelina Leon is playing her divine ’cello
during the interval at King’s this Marie
Tempest season. She lias taken up the run-
ning from violinist Mcßeath.
The Education Department wants a nurse
to follow up the work of the school medical-
ofncers and see that dad or mum has the
kiddies’ physical defects attended to. In
calling for applications Public Service Com-
missioner Morrison asks for “a recent photo-
graph” of each candidate, who must not be
over 40. The salary is only £3 ss. a week,
with allowance for uniform, equipment and
travelling exes., and a charmer is expected
for that!
The State which gave Australia its first
skirted M.L.A. has weighed in with the
pioneer lot of feminine footballers. There
are three clubs at Kalgoorlie. But a local
critic moodily observes that “they give exhi-
bitions of girl rather than of football,” and
recommends the damsels to drop it. Kal-
goorlie can’t be what it used to be.
The Countess has promised to go to the
Misses Montgomerys’ flapper dance for the
Church of England Boys’ Home and the
Society for the ('are of Other Young Animals.
The way the tickets have sold suggests that
there will be many very grown-up children
at the ball.
By tlie time you see this the Melbourne
Hospital, which appealed for a shower of
1000 blankets, will have its wish realised.
The big institution generally gets what it
wants once it makes its needs known.
Adelaide sends the local Court news:—
The lial Masque in aid of the Babies’ Home at
Walkeryille was a great success. The preliminary
meal at the Grand Central, for which a well-known
Adelaide man contributed several cases of wine,
proved an inspiration. There was not much origi-
nality about the dominoes, in which -ed predomi-
nated. Prior to the arrival of the vice-regals a
feverishly patriotic member of the committee tore
up and down stairs, and three times stopped the
band in the middle of a jazz to introduce “God Save.”
It lent variety to the programme but anno.ved many
who had paid to dance.
The kiddies’ shivoo the next night was well pat-
ronised. and in an interval little Priscilla Wei gall
gave “The Dying Swan” as a solo-dance, and did it
surprisingly well. The youngsters had a great time:
the girls specialised in dancing, the boys in supper.
The other afternoon feminine Adelaide filled the
ballroom at Government House while the two vice-
regal ladies and Herbert Phillips asked people to
go forth and gather a few thousand pounds for the
Queen s Home, which has to be enlarged to meet
the increasing demand for its services. It was
mentioned that one lady had had 17 babies, having
kept up the habit because the conditions at the
Home were so comfortable. After the mothers’ meet-
ing everyone drank afternoon tea on the lawn.
Ihe G.-G. a few days ago officially opened the
Pulteney Grammar School on South-terrace—really
the new home of the old Pultene.v-street School.
The vice-regal party was received by Bishop Thomas
and Dean Young. The key with which his Ex. did
the trick was made qf Broken Hill silver, and pre-
sented for the occasion by J. T. Hearne.
A day or two later his Ex. opened the Fair in
aid of the Church Mission to Foreign Lands. The
advertising poster showed the back view of a copper-
colored damsel in a ballet skirt of grass. “Blessed
if I can see why the women are making so much
fuss about clothes for the heathen,” said one dour
individual. “Why, at a dance last week some of
0111 d'dn i have any more than that on themselves.”
They all do it now. The Mission to Seamen is
arranging a dance at the Palais Royal on July 27.
M. 11. Foote, whom the Uni. Conservatorium
brought from London as teacher of the bassoon and
other wind-vessels, has given his first concert. He
claims that his is the king of instruments, and
nearly weeps at the familiar name of “clown of the
orchestra ’ given to it —mostl.v it is the performer
who is the clown, he wails. He has an accomplished
young daughter for a pianist. The attendance was
poor.

some L l U haS lts b . eiug> and aspires to
some day be a power in the life of strug-
gling genius. its new president, Justice
Jheri 0n w htt Ti e^ Wlte ’. gave lie ‘- ni-st party
ere last bnday in an atmosphere ail
ablow with Iceland poppies and music. Mrs.
Gordon had netted a non in Beatrice Unf-
ntlis hwinson who managed to pour into the
bijou piano (the only size the lilt will carry)
her own Carreno-like qualities. With her
long gold earrings and farm round arms con-
veying more than ever an impression of
Europe, Mrs - Swinson magicked
the little rooms into an Albert Hall recital,
tlie last composition or her first group being
a dramatic bit of Scriabine’s Russia. Mrs.
Uordon, slim and light as a puff of thistle-
down in her blue coat frock and necklet of
jade, sang some charming French songs and
an English poem set to an accompaniment
that sounded like gold sunlight and silver
rain. Maorilander Harold Heck played lus-
ciously on the ’cello, und Mrs. Allard in
lobelia-blue shades of froeking sang in
creamy tones of the wind and autumn leaves,
ihe housewifely Mrs. Jessica Lee, poetess
Dorothea Mackellar, Mrs. liabett, the Wade
lady and a tailor-made Miss Teece with a
genius for accompanying were others at the
party.
In the not so long ago a man wrote an ode
to the fleas in the Theatre Royal. Well,
the fleas have all fled before the varnish and
the paint and the new upholstery; and a poor
beastie would be hard put to it to find a corner
to hide in the new brilliantly-lighted Royal.
Ihe vestibule is all brown carpet and marble
and topaz gleams from the yellow-shaded
lights. -Iwo blocks of black marble flank
the d.c. stairway, and on these are wide-
mouthed shallow bowls of autumn-tinted foli-
age and flowers (poinsettia or bougainvillea),
the crimson tones more brilliant because of
the cunningly-inserted electric bulbs under-
neath the shallow bowls. The theatre itself
is all brown und gold like a chocolate breeze
the walls with the tint of a just ripening
apricot, the carpets and upholstery of the seats
brown, the circle banded with old gold, and
the drop-curtain of the same rich tone. The
boxes and proscenium are picked out with
little yellow lights, and the gods have
separate, numbered seats, so that Olympus
can now hold only 350 instead of the 000 who
used to be sardined in the high places. On
►Saturday night the Dooley Ministry came in
force, and so did vice-regality. An acre or
so of violets with trimmings of black and
gold were additional ornaments to the State
Exes. box.
The Prunes and Prisms being assured (the
prunes were before her on the supper-table,
and the prisms shone in every imaginable
tint overhead), Dame Margaret Davidson,
amiast a hush that was almost sacred, set
her foot across the threshold of the Went-
worth Caf6, the occasion being the supper-
dance given by Mrs. Maclurcan to the Syd-
ney Hospital Auxiliary. But the mere
guinea-ticket buyers hadn’t waited for her
arrival to get going; there were about 250
couples already at jazz holts when the Dame
arrived. Our vice-regal lady doesn’t fox,
but she sat at a table decorated in black and
gold (Sir Walter’s colors) at the end of the
room, with an uninterrupted view of every-
thing that was going on. With her were
Sydney Hospital chairman Stinson, the
much-decorated Commander Edwards with
his sparkling little wife, Nell Knox in apri-
cot satin,. and Joan Rolin in green—the
other Rolin sister frolicked in grey panne.
Little Auxiliary-secretary Mrs. Watson Hold-
ship for once took her hat off and prepared
to sit still for an hour or two. She was
surrounded Sydney Hospital vice-presi-
dents. Nancy Stewart’s red head was dis-
tinctive in a roomful of mere blondes and
brunettes. Mrs. Pitt Rivers was like a bit
of summer’s night in blue tissue. The Lough-
borough coronet came in jade green. Russian
princeling Oblenski was also present and
didn’t seem to care that crowns were among
the vanished rolling stock of Russia. Mollie
Little was another dancer ; and Sydney still
remembers that Mollie has danced more than
any other girl in Australia with English
royalty. A Moreau girl in leaf-brown tulle
and grass-green looked like a bit of a Pas-
toral ; good-workers Eadith Walker and
Edith Hill brought parties and Mrs. Hol-
man a cluster of gold grapes in her hair.
Nearly everybody you ever heard of was
there—Mrs. Willie Collins, Joskes, Jaqueses,
Hangars and Rabetts; and Pauline McMor-
ran, in pale pink, who won the jazz prize.
The film of the Prince’s 50,000-miles tour,
which was screened at the Palace o n Satur-
day night, is complementary to "H.M.S. Re-
nown in Australasia.” The much-discussed
book which Flight-Commander Rolleston
edited told us what the Prince and his friends
did, and the Palace picture shows how they
did it. There is more low comedy in the
film than in the book, which is, on the whole,
a dignified volume. Only the pictures, for
example, could adequately present the hand-
ing over to H.R.H. of the Ballarat girls' gift
ot pyjamas, and only the pictures are
capable of doing justice to W. M. Hughes in
the role of courtier.
St. John’s suffered the fripperies of trails
and arches of pink and yellow and crimson
blossoms among its rich panellings and
stately columns one night last week when the
College held its annual dance. Rector Father
Hercules O’Reilly made an ideal host, and
all the principals from the University col-
ony came to the party.
The girls and boys of the banks who last
year trooped to a ball in aid of Prince Alfred
Hospital are cheerfully spending their half-
guineas again this year, enticed thereto by
the popularity of Mrs. Walker and Mrs.
Core-Jones, the strong supports of the big
institution’s Auxiliary. The trysting-place
is the Town llall; the date, July 14. And
if the vice-regal Forsters and Davidsons
aren’t present thev’ve at least promised
their blessing.
The killing thing of the Sydney Hospital
Auxiliary Ball is to be the Statues in the
Park come to life. It is Theo Cowan’s idea ;
and what will happen when Consort Albert
hands the somewhat weatherbeaten Victoria
down from her Queen's-square pedestal
beggars imagination.
Winifred .Tenner has cabled from London
to say that her-recital at the Wigmore Hall
was a great saccess. Old friend and teacher
I hilip W.lson managed the concert for her;
and V inifred’s husband and baby over in
Mosman raised a cheer at the ambitious
little woman’s success.
Here is Mrs. Charlotte Cameron, who
has dropped in on Sydney full of New
Guinea and Samurai
(where, of course,
she visited Beatrice
Griinshaw) and Mo-
lokai, the lep e r
island, bastioned
with rugged rock.
Within those pali-
sades there is a
smiling garden of
brilliant skies and
tropic blooms. Hope
once more walks
there hand in hand
with sickness, for
nowadays there i s
no one so sick on
the prison island as
not to busy the
brain with plans for
the day when h e
will be clean again.
Mrs. Cameron is the first woman to visit
the Island since Jack London and his wife
were at Molokai; and she went with the
Administrator of the Hawaiian Group, who
pays an official call twice a year. The Gov-
ernment party drew close to the island in
the early morning, and the jazz band aboard
started, to toot and blare and syncopate a
greeting to the inhabitants of the little red
houses with the green roofs. To the visi-
tors’ astonishment the jazz outburst was
answered by real music from the Molokai
patients’ band. There is a medical inspec-
tion once a day, and, since the cure has been
proved, everybody rushes to the appointed
place at the ringing of the bell, for all,
especially the young girls and boys, are
eager for their dose in either capsule or
injection. There are young girls on the
island taught by a community of nuns, and
they strum their ukeleles and sing their
part-songs with as much dash as any petted
flapper of Darling Point. For they' are all
going to get well, and there’s romance and
the joy of life waiting just outside the prison
fastness. Here are babies, too, for babies
are being born all the time in Molokai; and
since the disease is believed not to be heredi-
tary, the baby is taken away from the
mother, who must not even lay a finger on’
it, and is placed in a home. One side of the
home is of glass, and here the mother comes
and looks through at her baby, seeing it
grow dimpled and round under the
trations of the jolly-looking little Jap nurses.
The women of the island are clever dress-
makers; Mi?s. Cameron saw them in the
afternoon strolling down to the rotunda to
listen to the' jazz band dressed in light gar-
ments, mostly white, made quite in the new
styles, smart in their white shoes and stock-
ings and shady hats. Not far from the
rotunda is the big auditorium, where twice
weekly there is a picture-show, Bill Hart
and Charlie Chaplin being first favorites.
Many of the residents are wealthy and have
motor-cars and all the comforts money can
give.
P°P u^a ti°n of 590 the clean number 90,
and of these heroes the beloved are Dr. Deane,
Dr. Goodhue and Brother Joseph. Brother
Joseph Dutton came to the island 38 years
ago to take up the work of Father Damien
'' hen the disease had stricken that wonder-
ful man to the grave that is marked by a
black marble cross. A large white cross
marks that of Sister Marianne, a nun who
worked 35 years among the island patients
without contracting the disease.
A revealing touch of the distance the vol-
untary residents of the island place between
thern and the rest of the world was given
by Brother Dutton, who said, when Mrs.
Cameron handed him her fountain-pen to
write his name in her book of autographs:
“Will you show me how to use it? I have
not seen one before.”
A line from “Vandorian” in London:—
Met a flue, breezy Australian the other day, and
we lunched at the Forum Club. She is M.s. F. S.
Stanley-Low, formerly Hilda Wright, daughter of
the late F. A. Wright, of Wright, Heaton & Co., and
a Minister in the Stuart and Dibbs days. With
Roxie Barton she came over this way years ago to
pursue a theatrical career, begun successfully in Aus-
tralia. Matrimony intervened—her husband, also
Australian, is a mining engineer. The Low home is
in the beautiful Chorley Wood district—an easy
train journey from London. And the lady of the
house can chat about out-of-the-way corners in
Europe as intimately as if they were included in
local attractions.
At a Royal Colonial Institute lunch to ex-Governor-
General Buxton (S’Africa) and ex-. Viceroy Chelms-
ford, I had an unrivalled view of a crowd of celebri-
ties. Buxton, slight and scholarly, made easily the
best speech. Chelmsford, who seems to have been
too small for his big billet in India, has aged very
much since he was Governor of N. S. Wales. His
face has grown yellow rather than tanned, and his
eyes are sombre. He spoke fluently as usual, but
with the note of a man with a grievance. His
lady, in handsome black draperies, had a rope of
pearls which, in spite of the sudden uprising of the
“cultured” species, I wanted to steal. The largest
voice present belonged to Sir Hugh Clifford, Governor
of Nigeria; and John Findlay, of Maoriland. sat
near. But (apart from the lady with the pearls)
there wasn’t for me anybody there except Admiral Sir
Edmund Fremantle, who sat entrenched behind a
Gladstone collar and a high black stock. Think of
it, he entered the Navy in 1849—72 years ago—and
married a N. S. Wales girl in great-grandma’s day.
And still swings a tennis racket!
If there were no Stars and Bars anywhere
else on Independence Day, Uncle Sam’s flag
got an airing at the Wentworth, where the
American Colony assembled to kiss the
newly-made Mrs. Victor Audette, who had
been Vivienne Berk until the Rev. Taumas
Tuit conjured her into her new name and
estate at Scots’ Church. The American
I lag that formed the canopy under which
the blonde couple received their friends’
congratulations was a mere pockethank.v
—4sft. by 17ft. Draping the wall at the back
of the bridal table wos more bunting; flank-
ing this were two tall brolgas standing on
turtles; browsing among the floral hearts
and darts before the bride and her ’groom
were two eagles; and above all swayed a
Petal wedding-bell. The arrangements at
the church were unique. Every guest had
received three cards—the invitation proper,
a permit for the church and a dinner ticket.
In the church porch a group of groomsmen
greeted the guest. To one he handed his
card ; to the second he murmured his name;
a third O.lv.’d it on the guest-list. Then
(xroomsman No. 4 presented his arm to
the lady of the party, and gravely handed
her up the aisle into a flower-decked pew.
In addition to the five bridesmaids who
preceded the bride up the aisle there were
two tiny girls in pink and blue. Each
bridesmaid wore a black-ribbon wristlet with
her initials in diamonds as a trophy. The
bride, in a knee-length dress of soft white
satin and tulle, looked more like a doll-bride
than the flesh-and-blood article, and mother
and father looked on with a sort of amazed
pride at their suddenly-grow’n-up chick. All
told there were about 300 guests and, so it
seemed, a million wedding-presents on view
in the balcony.
The only daughter of the Louis Hender-
sons, who lost her husband during the war,
was recently married quietly to Dr. Cato, of
Melbourne. When they left Svdney for
England they had a brilliant send-off, their
cabin being a bower. The bride is a very
beautiful woman and has one little son
who accompanied the newly-wedded pair.
Dulcie Robins, of Kurraba, Neutral Bay—
her dad is Reg Robins, the Fullers’ scenic
director has just promised herself for keeps
to James V. Woods, ex-A.l.Fer, of Mel-
bourne.
Old age has scored a romance which will
appear more like a scandal if the indignant
third party fulfils her threat of airing it in
the courts. The third is a young lady who
lived with her wealthy grandparents and
was engaged to a young man. drandpa died
not very long ago, leaving all his money to
his widow; whereupon the young man, for-
getting his engagement to the damsel, mar-
ried her grandmother.
The engagement that is thrilling Svdnev
at the moment is that of Dorothy Luscombe.
bhe is one of those clever young things who
have managed to combine a business career
with the flutters of a social butterfly Mrs
Oliver Osborne took her to Colombo for a
trip, and Dorothy ended up by picking out a
matrimonial location there.
, ill ton btudios have made this picture of
Ceeile Adkins, who has just been appointed
to the staff of the
State Conserva-
torium, and has
taken over Stephen
M avrogordato’s
pupils. Miss Adkins,
who is well known
in Sydney and the
northern towns as
a soprano of much
merit, came from
Camden Haven and
spent most of her
early years in Tam-
worth, Lismore and
Armidale, where she
won a vast number
of medals and dip-
lomas, Before
studying with
“M a v.” she was
taught first b.v Miss
Coglan, of Armidale, and then by Ella Cas-
pers. It is Mavrogordato’s method she in-
tends imparting—a method acquired from
Delle Sedie (Paris), Sir George Ilenschall
(London) and Edmund Myer (New TTork).
Graham Browne was rather a darling, too,
to the S.U.D.S. lie went out to the Uni.
one afternoon and talked stage-craft and
stage-management, and what he told those
lucky young things about lighting effects, and
how a play could be charmingly staged with
a minimum of properties, warmed the heart
of everyone in that somewhat liard-up society.
Levitzki devoted an afternoon to the dis-
abled soldiers at Ilandwick ; and a specially-
arranged matinee for the nuns—this was at
the Repertory—was a little courtesy which
not only gave joy to the religious communi-
ties but will benefit musical education.
On Saturday next our Miss Gibbs, who
was Blanche Brown before she found her
matrimonial Eden, comes back to the stage ,
in “The Little Whopper.” The little ser-
pent that lured her from her apple-orchard
was a theatrical contract naming a salary
that would make the Prince of Wales look
thoughtful.
Here is a gracious thing George Lambert
did last week. The red-bearded giant took
a collection of his paintings and went along
to Julian Ashton’s school, where he was busy
for a whole day, tacking and hammering and
whistling while he hung his canvases in the
best light. The girl-students were thrilled
to the bone. In the evening the artist gave
them a lecture full of charm and practical
hints. And the best part of it was that the
whole thing was a precious secret between
him and them —the outside world knew no-
thing about it. Even Gayfield Shaw wasn’t
permitted a glimpse of the group, which are
to be in the next Society of Artists’ Show.
The only daughter of Judge and Ethel
Turner Curlewis has had a book accepted
bv a London firm. It is “The Ship That
Never Set Sail.”
On Violet Day (July 29) a monster
Lucky Dip is to be motoi-ed round the city,
and everybody can have a throw with for-
tune. The whole proceeds, from buttons
and badges, collection-boxes and stalls, go to
keep the roof on the Soldiers’ Club.
No, it isn’t the Sisters of Mercy who are
required to. close up their boarding-schools—
it is the Sisters of Charity. Probably as a
natural sequence the Loreto Convent at
Normanhurst, which has been in existence
over 25 years, has had to add several wings
to accommodate a new flood of boarders.
When the Orange men and women were
farewelling the Neville Howses the sensa-
tion of the evening was created by Annie
Chandler, an embryo Alexander Watson,
who recited a poem by Mrs. Kearney, a local
writer. Its title is “Young Australia at
Gallipoli,” and it is so sincere that Annie,
who is only 14, and Mrs. Kearney had the
joy of seeing a great part of the assembly
in tears.
Australia is to have a new monthly with
an intimate name— Ours. The editor is
Florence Fourdrinier, whose “Story of the
Wheat” was one of the most attractive educa-
tional lectures this city has heard. Ours is
to be a little magazine for the home.
A new searcher has arrived at the Mitchell
Library—Miss M. E. Deane, a daughter of
a former engineer-in-chief of N. S. Wales
Railways. She has recently been engaged
in raking over the ashes of the past for the
Australian Historical Records. An Austra-
lian brother of hers, by the way, is engineer
to the Port of London Authority, which
means that he has the biggest job of the kind
in the whole wide world.

Studebaker Had a Reputation
SECOND TO NONE in the waggon-building
days—all over the world their vehicles
became known for their honest workmanship
and ultra quality.
The arrival and development of the motor
vehicle forced them into the automobile
business. They purchased out-right plants
already in operation, and ever since have —
through using only the best-quality materials
and mechanical knowledge procurable—been
striving to make their cars the best quality
values obtainable.
In 1916 new cars were designed and tested
out, but STUDEBAKER was too busily
engaged on war work for Britain and the
Allies to think of any new production, and it
was not until the latter part of 1918 that the
public became aware of the great Studebaker
changes in design and make-up of their cars.
In 1920 their new and world’s most modern
and complete motor-car manufacturing plants
at South Bend were completed and the new
LIGHT SIX, selling at the price of a FOUR,
announced.
This gives STUDEBAKER a compre-
hensive and modern line of quality
SIXES at appealing public prices.
They are known as the LIGHT SIX,
SPECIAL SIX and BIG SIX.
You have got to SEE AND TRY THEM to
realise their beauty, comfort, quality,
economy and great ability. Fact is, they
are obtaining for STUDEBAKER a reputa-
tion equal to that held by them in the
waggon-building days.
The U S.A. is the greatest buyer’s market on
earth, and STUDEBAKER cars are OUT-
SELLING EVERY OTHER MAKE with
the exception of FORD.
* Since the new models in 1919 public opinion
has been veering STUDEBAKER way.
DON’T buy anything until you have inspected
the new STUDEBAKER cars, and, if YOU
ARE NOT MECHANICAL, BRING
ALONG AN ENGINEERING ADVISER—
we relish an expert’s comments.

THE
“LONGREACH
IN RIDING
. I like your “Longreach”
Saddle very well; it is both
comfortable and safe, and 1
am indeed pleased with it.
That is what Mr. Win. McGarvie, of Pom-
borneit, Vic., writes about tins saddle. It
is a high-grade saddle, built on our best
"Fouright” Tree and its outstanding fea-
ture is comfort. The flap is sewn direct
on to the seat, doing away with the
regular skirt and giving a narrow non-
chafing grip. The pads are a departure
from the shape of the usual stock saddle
pad, are set well up the rider’s thigh, and
give perfect security. Fitted with folded
girth, bevelled leathers and solid nickel
stirrups.

nno' l^ Cl fvf iSati ° ri ! S tlle Spsrit of the A ge, and
disnosiH™ m ? st interesting tendencies is the
idpntff* of t , he modern manufacturer to
rpj • ais Soods by means of Trade-marks.
r±T*% St ? m . must continue to develop if
* . taia 1S to maintain her pre-eminent
u V* the markets of the world, because
nrndSX? atlon r^; uds to a hi^her standard of
nona • , lho V sancls of pounds are ex-
pended j early in advertising registered
wi'do<f" ma *j ks ’ , aad in many instances this
widespread publicity has made the public so
„“£ iai '. Wl t h these lines that the Trade-
- ai ,4 actually supplants the ordinary name
ot the goods in question. This sometimes
leads to merchants unintentionally passing
on to the buying public ordinary goods under
tiie name of the genuine trade-marked article,
\v ulst, on the other hand, an unscrupulous
trader may be tempted to substitute an imi-
tation as the genuine article.
A case under notice is that of the Tootal
tJroadhurst Lee Company, Limited, of Man-
cnester, Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers
of high-class cotton fabrics. This is an old-
established and reputable company, and is
the proprietor of the following registered
lrade-marks, which have been extensively
advertised in Australia and throughout the
world, viz:—“Tobralco,” a cotton fabric of
high quality, for dresses and shirts;
-1 ui tulle, u liner fabric for lingerie
and baby wear; “Lissue” handkerchiefs
tor ladies; Pyramid” and “Lova” handker-
chiefs for men; “Tootal Cloth,” a plain or
corded velvet “Tootal Pique,” “Tootal Shirt-
ings and “Namrit,” a high-class voile in
white and colored designs.
The Company recently discovered that there
existed in Sydney a widespread practice of
passing off to the public cotton fabrics im-
properly described and represented us their
genuine trade-marked lines. Tootal Broad-
hurst Lee Company, Limited, in the inter-
ests ot their customers and the public, took
immediate steps to stop this method of trad-
ing. I heir solicitors, Messrs. Minter, Simp-
son and Company, of Sydney, were in-“
structed to engage agents to investigate the
matter. A three days’ investigation, yielded
astounding results. It was ascertained that
no less than 25 business firms in Sydney
were selling cotton fabrics improperly de-
scribed as the genuine Tootal Broadhurst
Bee Company, Limited, products. Acting
upon the advice of their solicitors, Tootal
Broadhurst Lee Company, Limited, at once
instituted proceedings in Equity against
several of these firms. In all cases in which
proceedings were instituted, with one excep-
tion, they were withdrawn at the request of
the defendants, who entered into bonds
against any future passing off and paid all the
costs incurred by Tootal Broadhurst Lee
Company, Limited, in instituting proceed-
ings. In the one case in which the matter
was taken into court, an Injunction was
granted by Mr. Justice Harvey in the Equity
Court on February 23, until the hearing of
the Suit.
In many, cases the defaulters produced
evidence showing that the goods had been
purchased by them in good faith from whole-
salers as the guaranteed “Tootal” products.
In other cases it was found that ill-informed
shop assistants had misrepresented the goods
without their employer’s authority or know-
ledge. It was with a view to bringing be-
fore the public and trade generally the fact
that their registered Trade-marks are pro-
tected, that the Company sought an injunc-
tion against one defaulter. Under Australian
law the person who actually passes off and
the person who originally passes off are
equally liable apart altogether from the lia-
bility of employers, under Section 29 of the
Prices Fixing Act.
The Tootal Broadhurst Lee Company,
Limited, are not claiming damages. They
seek, as stated before, to protect the buyer
and seller of their fabrics, and to establish a
respect for their registered trade-marks.—

The Four-year-old Twins of Mrs. Elizabeth
Arundale, who were cured of Whooping Cough
by Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
“My little boy and girl, four years of age (twins), were suffering severely from
Whooping Cough, almost choking with phlegm, the coughing fits causing them to
turn black in the face, and greatly exhausting them,” writes Mrs. G. Arundale, 27
Russell Street, Dunedin, N.Z.
“We could get no remedy to relieve them, and we had tried a great many at
considerable expense, but they were of no curutive value whatever. A lady friend
mentioned Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to us as a sure remedy, and from the time
they started taking it they speedily improved, and in a very short time indeed they
were completely and permanently cured, thanks to Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery,
for which we are very grateful, and will recommend it on all possible occasions.”
Safeguards the Home.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a safe and certain remedy for children’s winter
ills, and has brought health and strength to thousands of sickly children. It can
be relied on to check the cold so quickly that the rosy cheeks have no time to grow
pale, and the little brain remains clear and sensitive for the day’s study. No coughing
at night when Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery has been taken before bedtime, but
deep, refreshing sleep to fit the children for another day of school.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery has become the Australasian mother’s refuge la
relieving Croup, Whooping Cough, Influenza and Bronchitis.

Nurses rarely have Corns

NURSES and doctors are
rarely bothered by corns,
because they know too
much to let corns worry them.
So do millions of people the world
ov e r—w ho use “B 1 u e-J ay”
Plasters.
To cut a corn invites trouble. It
t>-"Vps corn more painful.
“Blue-Jay” is gentle and sure.
You apply “Blue-Jay” in a
moment, and at once the pain
stops. Soon the corn withers,
and comes right out—forever.
“Blue-Jay” is a scientific prepara-
tion. The man who produced it
had made a life study of surgical
dressings. Note the illustration
below.
The felt pad, marked “A,” re-
moves pressure and stops the pain.
The wax, marked “B,” acts on the

Erst, when tue glades were golden, and
pale leaves lax with heat;
Bearing a white girl, petal-pallid and ruddy-
haired, . , ~
Prize of a hunter s wooing, bride or a
mating sweet.
Braving her kin, I took her, aye! from the
tribal fire,
Where brooded her swarthy brothers,
mouthing their guttural speech ;
Close hid in the primal blacßness, with
insatiate parched desire,
Swaying, we trembled wordless, passion-
ate, each to each.
’ held her, my wonder-woman, of red flame
wrought und snow,
With eyes that were pools of shadow, and
lips like a scarlet bud ;
Seathless I kept her, grimly answering blow
for blow
The giant-thewed avengers, ravening red
with blood.
Deep in the granite gorges, perilous, moun-

There in the guarded cavern our dim, red
hearth-fire glowed ;
Where, o’er rock-fauged depth, beneath us
a foam-grey torrent brawled,
And the ice-white mists at dawning in
swirling eddies flowed.
I was her lord, unrivalled, I whom my tribe
held chief
By virtue of proven manhood, and the
right of the strongest one;
Shared we the battle-rapture, shared we the
famine grief,
As the warrior-days leapt deathward, sing-
ing from sun to sun.
l’et ever my kin were wand’rers, all of them,
son and sire,
Fain of the steaming jungle, of river and
cloud-peaked grey.
Silent I grew* and sullen, fierce with a
shouldering fire ;
Then I loosed her white arms from me,
blindly, and went my way.
Adventure.
Ha, for the charging mammoth, blind in the
baffling dusk!
For the leopard quivering, couchant with
challenging orbs of flame!
For the splendid peril of fang, death-ven-
omed and furtive tusk!
For the terrible sweetness of passionate
lusts without pity or shame!
Savor of flame-bright blossoms crushed in
the vivid dawn.
Sweet of the scented forest, scarlet and
golden dim,
When, by lure of the listening distance deeper
and nearer drawn.
Day reddens the green and amber of
frondage and fruited limb.
Ooze of the evil river, reeking with foetid
slime,
Born of the swamps that fester, choked
in their crowding reeds,
Horror of sunless jungles, where dim mid
,the dark boles climb
Drab, wide-jawed serpents swaying down
where the lithe doe feeds!
Splendor of straining sinew, tireless and
leopard strong,
Vigor of massive torso, of corded and
supple thigh ;
Apd deep and far in the silence, like a vast
heart-shaking song,
The roar of the rolling war-drums, of
battle beating high !
These I have known, and with ever a
smouldering fire at my brain
Have braved the blind jungle, a,nd trodden
the precipice pathw.ays of stone.
Alone have I hungered and hunted, have suf-
fered and striven and slain
Men of tribes skin-clad and reed-clad, and
males of the ape-men, alone.
Out of the fog-w*alled dawn-w*orld I leapt
on them sleeping, and slew.
Dusk of the west behind me, flame and
their spears ahead.
Blindly they broke and sundered, as golden
the day-flower grew,
And far o’er the lake beyond us the fire-
wide east flared red.
Return.
Here where the fire of the wild moon whitens
the deep still night.
Through the dappled forest murmurs the
sweet, far mating call.
Lo, dead in me is the wander-lust at its
triumph height.
And over the ash-white embers love’s
scented petals fall.
I will turn again to the white girl who is
even as I, alone.
Afar in the shadowed cave-mouth I and
and none other found—
Ah, turn from the lair I have made me,
sated and weary grown.
To the girl with flame-white wonder of
awesome beauty crowned.
QUEENSLAND.

On the Side of the Law.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. SNORKY JEPSON slumbered
peacefully and contentedly in the
sunshine. The location of Snorky’s
siesta was at the of the ironfoundry of
Dobson Bros., on ground used bv the firm
for dumping boilers and other ships’ iron-
mongery awaiting repairs or the scrap-heap.
It was well removed from the busy haunts
of men—or, rather, from those who alone
were likely to take more than a passing in-
terest in Snorky and his doings. His cobber,
Mr. Joseph Briggs, was earning a more or
less honest penny or two with a fruit-
barrow; and Snorky deplored the fact that the
minions of the law had “got him in the gun,”
insofar as they had ordered him to absent
himself from his usual haunts for a while,
“(let to Hell, if you like; but get,’ - one
member of the force had told him, tired
at last of shooing the undesirable from the
doorways of hotels where Snorky made him-
self a nuisance by touting for “work”—
carrying bags and luggage up the steps.
A sound of crunching feet amongst the
machinery caused Snorky to waken with a
start. Cautiously up-ending himself, he
peered over the top of his reclining-post.
Picking their way hurriedly among the
ddbris were two well-dressed young men,
and Snorky ducked swiftly as they paused a
few yards away.
"You’re sure it was Bantry?” asked one
of the pair.
“Certain,” replied the other.
Snorky strained his ears to catch more.
Bantr.v ! There was only one Bantry as far as
he was concerned—Detective Bantry. What
was the game?
“And you think he spotted you and fol-
lowed?” asked the first speaker anxiously.
“Well, of course, I’m not sure; but he
seemed mighty interested in me, and as I
turned down the lane I saw Ceilings join
him.”
Snorky drew a sharp breath. Collings was
another of his acquaintances of the detective
force.
"well, let’s hoof it. They can’t prove any-
thing against us. But it’s just as well to
keep out of their way.”
Then Snorky sneezed. The two young
men gave a start, and the bigger of them
rushed forward and grabbed the derelict by
the shoulder.
“Who the devil are you?” he asked.
“What’re „vou doing here, eh?”
Snorky wriggled in his grasp. “’S orl
right, mister; I ain’t doin’ no harm,” he
whimpered. “I was only havin’ a doss here.”
Then, remembering the conversation he had
overheard, he added, cunningly—“ Away
outer sight of the hops.”
The pair eyed the untidy loafer critically
for a minute or two. Then the smaller of
the two remarked : “Let it sleep if it wants
to. Get back to your doss.”
Snorty slid to a reclining position to think
out the problem.
A deep voice suddenly broke on his pon-
derings, and Snorky dropped on his stomach.
Wriggling like a snake to a large ship’s
boiler, he crept through a hole and lay trem-
bling. “Holy smoke !” he mumbled. “Bantry
an’ Collings!”
The voices came nearer, and to Sijprky’s
horror the speakers pulled up alongside his
haven of refuge.
“I could have sworn they came through
here,” said a deep voice.
“Oh, well,” said the other, “if w r e had got
W'nm l doubt if we could have done anything.
They’re a pair of fly birds are Skinny
Thompson and Banger Curran. The bank-
messenger affair and the South Yarra hold-
up mightn’t have been anything of theirs”
and the voices faded away.
A quarter of an hour later Snorky pushed
his head from his hiding-place, and after
listening for a few minutes wriggled out
and shuffled away.
That evening at the Three Stars he
related his adventure to Mr. Joseph Briggs.
“Would yer know ’em agen if yer saw
em?” asked Joseph, as he tugged at his
pocket and drew out a paper.
“Yes, I’d know ’em agen orl right,”
affirmed Mr. Jepson. “I had a good screw
at ’em. I thought they was new d.’s at first
till they got yappin’ ter me. Why?”
“Well,” answered Joseph, opening up the
paper, “course th’ blokes you seen mightn’t
have anything to do with it: but th’ bank’s
offerin’ £lOO reward for th’ blokes what
slugged th’ messenger th’ other day an’
shook a thousand quid off him.”
“What’s that goiter do with us?”
“Yer can’t tell. Yer might see th’ blokes
agen, and put th’ Johns in their track,
an’ ” •
“Gerrout! Whatcher givin’ us?” replied
Snorky, derisively. “Me put th’ Johns on ter
anyone? Me?”
“Don’t get yer hair off. A hundred quid’s
a hundred quid,” retorted Joseph. “An’ if
yer was th’ one to pot ’em, yer'd be made an
hero of.”
Three days later Snorky hurried into the
bar-room of the Three Stars, and found
Joseph waiting there.
“Come over here, quick,” whispered
Snorky, and, grabbing up the pots Joseph
had thoughtfully ordered, the pair shunted
to a corner of the room.
“What’s up?” asked Joseph eagerly.
“It’s them, orl right,” said Snorky. “It’s
them.”
“Th’ blokes what did th’ bank messenger
in?” interrogated Joseph.
“Yes,” replied Snorky. “Y”see, I gotter
keep outer sight of th’ Johns, so I been
hookin’ it to a little pub I know, an’ it’s
there I run against th’ pair of ’em. They
gotter fright when they saw me there; any-
way, they clears out pretty soon. I asked
old Paddy if he knew who they was; but he
said he didn’t know ’em—they’d on’y been
cornin’ in fer a few days.”
Joseph pondered over this information
thoughtfully. “Looks a bit fishy,” he com-
mented. “Well, keep on th’ watch, an’ we
might land on that hundred vet.”
Next day Mr. Jepson mooched into the
bar of the Bricklayers’ Arms, and to his
satisfaction found the two men engaged in a
whispered conversation. They looked up as
he entered, and then resumed their talking.
Snorky sipped leisurely at his beer, and
strove hard to catch w’hat they were saying,
but couldn’t make out a word. Presently
the pair rose, and, eyeing Snorky critically,
strolled out in the street.
Had Snorky been able to follow* close
behind them he would have heard conversa-
tion that would have gladdened his ears and
warmed his heart. The taller of the two,
a fat-faced man with little, pig-like eyes,
grabbed his companion’s arm as they reached
the corner.

We all seek life’s comforts and pleasures, but many of
us pay too high a price for them. Continued over-
working, late hours and loss of sleep gradually roll up an
account that brings sickness and enforced rest. Weak
kidneys is the common penalty. Daily backache, dizzy
spells, headaches, rheumatic pains and kidney irregu-
larities are warnings of kidney weakness. Don’t wait!
Neglect may lead to gravel, dropsy or fatal kidney
disease. For quick relief help the weakened kidneys with
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS. Doan’s have
brought new health and happiness to thousands of
sufferers. Many of them live here in Sydney. Ask
your neighbor.
SYDNEY PEOPLE TELL OF THEIR CURES
BY DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.
FROM ROZELLE.
Mr. M. Dowling. 25 Roseberry .Street. liozelle, Sydney, says: ‘*For about
three years I suffered a good deal with my kidneys, and during that time was
treated by doctors and tried different remedies, but nothing did me any good. My
back used to ache fearfully, and it was as much as I could do to stand up straight
after bending over a little while. I had liniments rubbed in. but the relief was
only temporary, the pain being soon as bad as ever. The kidney secretions were
very much disordered, being highly colored and scanty. My general health was
far from good, and I often used to feel so ill I could hardly attend to my work.
One day I saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and the thought
occurred to me to try this remedy. I bought a bottle, and in a few days I began to
feel better. As I went on with the treatment the improvement was maintained,
and by the time I had used four bottles I was cured, all signs of backache and
kidney trouble having entirely gone. I am in splendid health now. and have only
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to thank for my recovery.”
FROM CAMPERDOWN.
Mrs. T. Smith. 25 Bridge Street, Camperdown. Sydney, says: “A member
of my family suffered agony from rheumatic pains all over the body, and was
completely crippled with the ailment for months. The pains were particularly
severe across the small of the back, just over the kidneys. We had a doctor
treating the case for. a good while, but his medicine did not do any good, and
at last he said he was afraid nothing more could be done. We then tried hospital
treatment, but that also failed. It was right on top of this that we were advised
to use Doan s Backache Kidney Bills, and although we had very little hope that
they would do any good, we got some to try them. After taking two or three
bottles there was a little improvement, so we persevered, until a perfect cure was
effected, using in all 12 bottles. We cannot say enough in praise bf Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and consider the cure a marvellous one.”
h our years later Mrs. Smith says: ‘‘The cure referred to still holds good. I
ani sure if Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were better known there would be less
suffering in the world.”

“Tell you what, Banger, he’s a pimp, or a
d. in disguise,” he remarked.
“Oh, cut it out, Shinny. You’re losing your
nerve,” retorted his companion. "Didn’t
Paddy tell us he’s known him for years, and
that he’s only a bummer looking for cheap
beer and an easy life? And Paddy wouldn’t
put up any crook stunt on us—we know too
much about him.”
“Oh, I suppose it’s all right. But it’s
queer him showing up like this.” Then, in
sudden alarm. “Damn it all, there he is
now,” and he nodded down the street.
Snorky, having spent his last sixpence,
and seeing no prospect of getting further
supplies of liquid refreshment gratuitously,
had decided to go for a ramble until it was
time to meet Mr. Briggs at the Three Stars.
He .shuffled along past them on the other
side of the street. Then suddenly they saw
him stop dead at a corner, peer around it
for a moment, and turn and break into
au amble back the way he lmd come.
“What’s up with him?” queried Banger
curiously.
lie was answered the next moment by
the appearance of a uniformed policeman
who strolled quietly to the corner which
Snorky had peered around. The John
looked after Snorky shuffling hurriedly away
in the distance and grinned. “Suddenly re-
membered an engagement,” he said to the
two onlookers. They grinned in reply, and
the policeman strolled on.
“There you are, what did I tell you—the
bummer’s got on your* nerves!” remarked
Banger. “lie’s more scared of the police than
we are. Anyway, we haven’t got much longer
tc wait.” Then he grabbed his companion
by the arm. “I’ve thought of something.
We’ll make use of him. Come on back to
Paddy’s, and I’ll put you wise.”
They retraced their steps to the Brick-
layers’ Arms, and in the bur-parlor talked
long and earnestly.
That evening Snorky reported further pro-
gress to Mr. Briggs, and next day Mr.
Briggs did not ply his calling in Flinders-
street. Instead, he accompanied Snorky to
the Bricklayers’ Arms. In a corner of the
bar sat a young man, Mr. Banger Curran.
His companion was nowhere to be seen. Mr.
Curran was reading the Sporting Chron-
icle, and he looked up and nodded quite
affably as the pair of undesirables walked
into the bar.
“Have a drink?” he asked.
The invitation was accepted with enthusi-
asm, and Mr. Jepson and Mr. Briggs spent a
most pleasant hour with the stranger, who
iusisted upon shouting repeatedly. Then,
bidding them good-bye. he drew a handker-
chief from his pocket, wiped his mouth, and
walked out. Unnoticed by him ;i crumpled
paper dropped to the floor, and Snorky with
a dexterous shuffle placed one of his hoots
on it. While Paddy turned to pull the
pints which Joseph hurriedly ordered, Snorky
stooped and thrust it into his coat pocket.
With unusual despatch they consumed their
beer, and hurried out.
“What’s the e\ame?” asked Mr. Briggs, as
they hurried up the street.
"That’s him,” replied Snorky—“th’ one
called Banger. Dunno what’s in tli’ letter,
but there might be something. Let’s go lip
to th park an’ read it.”
Seated on a bench in the park Snorky pro-
(luced the letter. There wasn’t much in it,
but what little there was caused the pair to
regard each other with looks of intense satis-
taetion.
I tell yer?” croaked Mr. Jep-
so“-,’HIy cri P es » we’re on t’ that hundred.”
Banger,’ he read—that was the cove

things are fixed up all right for Friday
night. The old chap lives on his own, anil
I ve found out he takes home all the sparklers

too mean to have anyone working for him,
and it ought to be easy to get the lot. They
ought to be worth a few thousands. It's
best for us not to be seen together for a
few days. The house is a small, five-roomed
place with a lot of trees and bushes growing
about it—l 7 Pinewood-street, Balaclava.
Meet me there at 9 o’clock. Then it’s us for
Sydney, Shinny'—Shinny’s th’ other bloke,”
explained Snorky.
“What’ll we do now?” asked Joseph—
“hand it to th’ p’lice?”
Snorky snorted disgustedly. “Hand yer
gran’mother t’ tli’ p’lice. Th’ p’lice! An’
have ’em get th’ hundred quid ! Garn, no;
we’ll catch ’em ourselves—catch ’em red-
handed. An’ then th’ p’lice can come in.”
“But we can't tackle them two,” objected
Mr. Briggs, as bo ruefully surveyed Snorky’s
wizened frame, and his own flabby beer-
strengthened muscles; “They’d—they’d kill
us.”
“We ain’t goin’ ter tackle ’em on our
own,” replied Snorky. “There’s Tiger Wil-
son an’ Bed Ferris—Tiger’s big ernough t'
oat th’ pair of ’em himself; they’ll come in
on it for a fiver each. They ain’t done any-
thing since they come out from doin’ their
last stretch, an’ it’ll help tor put ’em right
with th’ n’lice.”
“Cripes, yer do think sometimes, Snorky,”
remarked Mr. Briggs.
“I’ll take a run out termorrer an' look
tli’ place over,” said Snorky, “an’ you get
in touch with Tiger an' Bed an' put it to
them.”
At about the same time the heads of the
detective force were puzzling over- a letter
that had arrived at headquarters by the last
mail.
“It may be a hoax, and then again it
mightn’t,” remarked Bantry.
“It looks a bit like a bust-up,” replied Col-
lings. “One of the gang’s got sore over
something. Anyway, it’s worth a fly.”
The letter that was causing these com-
ments was opened out on the Chief’s table,
and read: “It has come to my knowledge
that an attempt is to be made on Friday
night to break into the house at No. 17
Pinewood-street, Balaclava, lately occupied
by Moses Blaubaum, the diamond merchant.
The parties on the job evidently do not
know that Blaubaum shifted only three days
ago to another suburb. They are the men
you are looking for, Banger Curran and
Skinny Thompson. They plan to raid the
place on Friday night at 9 o clock.”
The letter was, of course, unsigned.
“You’ll take charge of this, Bantry,”
ordered the Chief. “Make what ai'rangements
you think necessary. There’s a hundred
hanging to it if you get your men. We’ll
find they’re the chaps who robbed that
bank messenger, I’m certain.”
At about 8 o’clock on Friday night
four men alighted from the train at Bala-
clava—Mr. Snorky Jepson, Mr. Joseph
Briggs and the estimable Messrs. Tiger Wil-
son and Bed Ferris —and hurriedly made
their way, under the pilotage of Snorky, to
No. 17 Pinewood-street. They found the
place much as it had been described in the
letter Snorky had picked up—a small, weather-
beaten cottage standing far back from the
street, and surrounded by a garden of un-
kempt trees and shrubs. No lights shone
in the place.
“S’pose he’s gone ter bed,’’ remarked
Snorky, as they cautiously crept into the
garden.
Tiger’s professional instincts at once
obtruded themselves. “Why can't we give
it a go ourselves?” he said. “We’d have
time ter get off with th’ stuff ’fore th’
other blokes come.”
“No good ter me,” whispered Snorky, in
alarm. “Cripes, don't start any of them
games, Tiger, or I'll give th whole show
away.”
“Oh, orl right,” growled Mr. Wilson:
“whatter we gutter do?”
“You an’ Bed get behind that bush on
that side of tin* path, an’ me an’ Joe’ll get
behind this one on this side. Don’t do any-
thing till they’re right in th’ garden—they’ll
have ter come up th' path. Then rush ’em.
If yer quick about it we’ll have ’em before
they know what’s happened.”
For tin- next hour they waited in silence.
The street was a quiet one; only at rare
intervals did anyone walk past. Snorky
crouched shivering alongside Joseph, their
nerves on edge, and it was only by frequent
nips from a flask Joseph had thoughtfully
brought along they were able to keep their
courage up ror the job they had set them-
selves to do. That, and the thought of the
hundred pounds reward.
Suddenly Snorky raised his head, and
listened. “Shish!” lie whispered to bis con-
federates.
Along the street came the sounds of foot-
steps—not the loud clatter made by leather-
soled boots, but the soft swish-swish of rub-
ber soles. The sounds paused by the gate for
a second or two. Then noiselessly the gate
was opened, and the swish-swish came to-
wards them up the path. How many wore
in the party arriving could not be seen in
the blackness of the garden.
“Now!” piped Snorky. and four figures
rose from the earth, and threw themselves to-
wards two forms standing on the garden
path.
The next instant a voice cried “Hands
up!” and a whistle purled shrilly. Other
men tore through the gateway, and an elec-
tric torch flashed out on the struggling fig-
ures. Squealing, Snorky found himself
hurled on bis face, and a pair of handcuffs
snapped on his wrists. At the same time he
heard Joseph appealing for mercy. Messrs.
Wilson and Ferris, after the first rush, had
stood paralysed at the sound of the voice.
They knew it, knew it only too well —
Bantry’s.
“Play the light here, Gregory,” cried Ban-
try. Then as the light flasUed on the quar-
tette his mouth opened comically. “Well, I’ll
be damned!” lie ejaculated. “Come on, out
of here !” and the four prisoners were marched
to the street and hustled into a car that had
just driven up.
The next afternoon four chastened citi-
zens foregathered in the bar-room of the
Three Stars.
“Lucky ter get outer it ’swell as we did,”
affirmed Tiger Wilson, eyeing the woe-begone
Snorky truculently; “fer two pins, I’d”
“Cripes, how was I ter know it was a
stall?” whimpered Snorky. “O me Gord!
that big brute Codings nearly broke me
arms!”
Mr. Briggs was moodily poring over that
morning’s paper.
“What’s it say, Joe?” asked Snorky.
anxious to divert the attention of the angry
Mr. Wilson.
“Not much. I’ll read it t’ yer” :
Last night the residence of Mr. Moses Blaubaum,
tlie well-known dealer in precious stones, at No. 56
Eskdale-road, Box Hill, was broken into. Mr. Blau-
baum, who lives alone, was bound and gagged, and
jewels valued at over v 5000 were stolen from him.
The police, are prosecuting inquiries.
“Cripes!" wailed Snorky. “That damn
pair ot rooks! They worked us, an’ we fell
fer the joke.”
Up at the C.I.D. another letter was the
subject of angry debate.
H. R. McDUFFIE.
Pan Laughed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Six inches through, those walls of brick :
The gate of iron barred and scrolled
And spiked at top. A clever trick,
Each point a sentinel enrolled;
A type entrenched, it seemed to be
A suburb's smug morality.
Green paint, of course, the crudest kind;
And staring, red picked out with white,
One begged the moon might strike it blind,
And thanked the velvet mask of night,
For only in the cryptic hours
Could one believe in grass and flowers.
Surely no bird would dare that wall,
Nor perch upon that armored gate!
No butterfly pay casual call,
Wing-touching with its summer mate!
If there were blooms, who can suppose
Aught so seductive as a rose?
And yet, I swear, one starlit hour
I loitered in the road outside,
And drank the fragrance of a flower
That spilled its honeys far and wide,
And where those guarded gateways frown,
Pan laughed, and all the walls went down!

A Specially Prepared Case of
Automobile Lamps at
a Low Price .
Accurate centering of filaments and careful inspection make
Westinghouse U. S. A. Automobile Lamps give exceptionally long
and satisfactory service. To enable dealers to become acquainted
with these lamps the manufacturers have prepared an assort-
ment of 1 70 lamps.
Lamps in this Display Case will equip all standard makes of cars using 3-Cell
Generator Systems, also Ford cars fitted with Magneto Lighting Equipment.
Each lamp is wrapped individually; ten lamps to a carton. The entire caso
packed for overseas trade in a light, but very strong container.
This case is being offered at a very*unusual price. It is a great opportunity
for dealers to start a splendid trade at a very slight initial expense. We
are desirous of receiving inquiries.
