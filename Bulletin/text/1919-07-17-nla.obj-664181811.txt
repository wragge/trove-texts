For Your Liver
Pinkettes, the new laxative,
give excellent results in cases of bil-
iousness and torpid liver. People
who are unnaturally drowsy and
sleepy, who lack ambition and
energy, are usually victims of their
liver.
Pinkettes have a specific action
on the liver and speedily banish the
feeling of lassitude and weariness.
They are effective without being
drastic and they have none of the
bad effects of strong purgatives.
Pi ikettes also regulate the stomach
and liver, correct bad breath, clear
the complexion, and are an ex-
cellent remedy to use ’uring colds
and fevers.

Can We Write Short Stories?
This is an interesting note from Dr.
Sloason, the Literary Editor of The In-
dependent, of New York, one of the best-
known and best of American literary news-
paper-magazines :
Every week Bince I visited Australia Borne six
years ago I have read The Bulletin diligently for
the purpose of getting acquainted with Australian
litel-ature, and there is one thing that I cannot
understand about it. Why is it that the short stories
published in The Bulletin are decidedly inferior
to the average in American periodicals, while your
poems, cartoons, editorials and book reviews are
decidedly above the American average? I have
worn out scores of your sketches and verses carry-
ing them around in nay pocket to show to friends,
but I have not seen a single short story that was
worth reading twice and, for the most part, once.
I am sure this cannot be because of their local
color, for nothing could be more deliberately indige-
nous than your poetry and jokes. The short stories
seem to be lacking in the vividness and originality
that characterise other forms of Australian literature
as reflected in The Bulletin. Most of your stories
read like Australian imitations of London stories of
Australian life.
Evidently American taste in short stories is
quite different from Australian; for the
average Australian literary critic regards
she short stories as being, next to verse, the
poorest part of the American literary out-
put. To the Australian palate the Ameri-
can short Story isn’t a short story; it is,
a rale, a protracted story. Australian
short-story writers discovered a good many
years ago that, as Dr. Slosson might have
told them, they would have to alter their
style to find an American market. They
found no difficulty in managing it; all they
had to do was to pad their Australian stuff,
and then they achieved' success.
It would be interesting to learn how the
American taste has been vitiated in this
way. One explanation is that, since the
American' magazine carries a vast quantity
of advertising matter in its tail, it was de-
sirable that everybody who read anything on
page 9 should be practically compelled to
turn also to page 90; wherefore a mau who
told aH he had to tell on page 9 was no
good. The Australian publications that
handle short stories have no jungle of ad-
vertisements in the back yard to which they
are under an obligation to carry their
readers; hence they encourage a short-story
writer to tell liis tale and go.
If - there is any other striking difference
between the so-called short stories of the
two countries it is due to the pretty general
absence of the purely sentimental from the
Australian production. The American, on
the other hand, is highly sentimental. And
that is just as one might expect from an
extraordinarily emotional people. Perhaps
the Australian is really emotional, too. But
he absolutely refuses to show his feelings.
It was that way right through the war. He
was “the bloke who laughed when he was
dying.” Confessedly, that is rather the
snirit of the Australian short story; and we
are not a bit surprised that the American
cannot appreciate it.
Red Russia
It should 't be impossible to get the truth
about a’ . thing at all in this world which
ttearu and petrol and electricity have so
harrowed; yet the Russian. Bolshevik stiil
remains something of a mystery. English
trade-union conferences have enough faith in
him to say, “Let him alone—he will work
out Russia’s salvation in his own way” ; and
in Australia there are even a few members
of Parliament who exclaim: “Call us Bol-
sheviks if you like—we want no better
name!” Yet at 90 per cent, of what they
can read about him decent people, even
decent Radicals with Australian notions of
a fair deal, can only shudder. Anything
written by an apparently unprejudiced
person who has seen with his own eyes the
happenings in Russia during the last three
years is therefore of solid value, even
though it only throws s?Jelights on the per-
plexing question.
Under Cossack and Bolshevik (Methuen)
is by an English woman who went to Russia,
soon after the war started, as a governess
iu a Russian “bourgeois” household. The
family’s home was at Rostov, in the Don
Cossack’s country, and she looked in at
Petrograd on the way there. She—her
name is Rhoda Power —has no love to. spare
for the “bourgeoisie.” There was among the
servants a “sweet, withered old woman who
suffered so much and so patiently. She was
crippled with rheumatism, due, she told me,
to having been obliged to- sleep on the floor
outside a nervous mistress’s room.” The
servants in these houses rarely had beds or
bedding. They slept “rolled up in shawls
on the kitchen table or sometimes on the
floor.” They were underfed and were paid
very little; aud one can’t be surprised to
hear that they were, as a rule, liars and
thieves. Their masters and mistresses had
no consideration for them, and they had
none for their masters and mistresses. Then
came the Revolution, which most of them
didn’t understand, except that it was for
“Liberty.” Naturally they had queer ideas
of Liberty.
Our cook did the marketing, and was blamed by
the'servants for the laefc of variety in their meals;
and one day the coachman followed her into her
room and beat her till she was badly bruised. Her
cries brought Mme. Sabarova to the rescue. She
remonstrated with the coachman, whose face ex-
pressed the utmost amazement. “What, does the
barinia mean Jo Say that I may not even beat her
cook’ 7 —a pause—“how it is Liberty?”
Miss Power watched the turmoil for month
after month ; to-day the Republic overturned
by the Bolsheviks, to-morrow the Cossacks
in command, then the triumph of the Red
Guards and Bolshevism once more, after
that the sbdden .emergence of the Anarchists,
and again the Cossacks triumphant. Atro-
cious things Were done during the rule of
the Bolsheviks; yet for the' worst of them
she does not hold the Soviet directly respon-
sible. The gaols being filled with people who
had committed offences against property
and. the persons of the propertied, of
course they were emptied; in the very
first procession that Miss Power watched
after the Revolution there was a
group of rascals carrying a banner
with the legend: “The Committee of Thieves
Greets the Republic.” And thieves and
murderers were many; and with the means
to do ill-deeds the ill-deeds were done. As
a matter of fact, the Soviet punished rob-
bery; it did not itself rob: it only “ex-
propriated” and “took over.” The sufferers
may he forgiven if they failed to appreciate
the difference.
The most deplorable feature of the whole
ghastly business, and the one which not only
makes it certain that the movement must fail
but ought to deprive it of even theoretic sup-
port from Australia or English Labor
bodies, is its hatred of education, > This
writer quotes from her diary;
On the other side of the road a student was
walking, “Ha!” cried a tovarish (comrade), “an-
other of the intelligentsia. So vou will educate
yourself above the people, will you? There!” and
he shot him through the head. The boy fell with
a little cry, and before he was quite dead his clothes
were taken off and sold to a passing peasant.
Incidentally we get a delightful little peep
into the back of. the Bolshevik niind to ex-
plain why religion was ruled out. “God
had been ‘above the people,’ and was there-
tore in the same category as the aristocrats
and must be abolished.”
But, after all, Miss Power’s book is not
of so much value for what it says about
Bolshevism as for the glimpses it gives of
the conditions that produced Bolshevism.
And nothing is clearer than that Bolshevism
isn t the end of the journey. In. the mine the
explosion seems to make merely disorder.
Then comes even more disorder when the
broken ore is mixed with flux and fuel. But
out of the furnace into which the confusion
goes comes the metal. Bolshevism is the
disonler, which with guidance may lead on
to the metal. With our universal suffrage
all power being in the hands of the people,
jhe richest “bourgeois ’ having no more power
than the poorest workman, we have the
democratic metal—-the thing that Bol-
shevism may come to when it succeeds. The
Australian who wants to reproduce the con-
tusion of Bolshevism wants to put the pro-
cess back. He already has what the
Bolshevik is more or less blindly groping for
and doesn’t know it. ° ’
The Shearers' Library
Of late years there has been a move in
the back country to establish shearing-shed
libraries. No modern shed is considered
complete without a reading-room. The sub-
scribers are shearers, rouseabouts, musterers
hands, ’ and the librarian is usually
the station bookkeeper—the most permanent
of all the employees. It is not an easy
institution to get going and to maintain, as
the shearers and rouseabouts are in the shed
tor only a few weeks in the year. Still there
are many of them about.
Formerly only a few newspapers were sub-
scnbed for by the men at shearing time,
and these only at the sheds that lasted over
a month. The hat was sent round imme-
aiately after roIl -call. The collection was
handed to the rep., -who either invested it
at the nearest newsagency or sent it awav
to the newspaper offices direct. I remember
a rep. in a big shed who once wrote to a
dozen different offices for 14 copies of their
weekly publications. H e meant a copy of
each issue for 14 weeks, and was annoyed
when each office dropped in 14 copies of one
week s issue.
Besides the few papers there are usually
several soiled, dog-eared books among the
team books that have been carried for
months, over hundreds of miles in different
swags, swapped in hut and camp, and passed
from hand to hand in pubs and sheds. These
books seldom have any covers on them: and
very often a page is missing when sensa-
tional developments are expected. The
break provokes Bill the presser to hurl the
aggravating volume at the tarboy, which
assault and battery knocks further holes in
the yarn. There is, as a rule, good Literary
ir -^ e dilapidated collection—princi-
pally fiction and nearly always bush verse;
but mostly the books are of the penny-
dreadful class, which Bill reads because he
must read something. After weeks of “fifteen-
two. fifteen-four.” he is ready to consume
anything. _ And he gets hold of rubbish
becaus e it is chiefly rubbish that is sent into
the Backblocks.
E. S. SOBENSON
The Pasteur Play
If Sa eha Guitry has not succeeded in
writing a great play he has given Parisians
something to think about by introducing
drastic change in their theatrical bill of
i;ire, at a time when the French stage badly
needed it. Ilis play “Pasteur” was pro-
duced in Paris on January 23, at the Vaude-
ville Theatre. The author had been
fascinated three years previously by the
perusal of the great scientist’s biography
written by his son-in-law, Rend Vallery-
Radot, and had contemplated writing a drama
on the subject, but had almost abandoned
the scheme when his father. Lucien Guitry,
asked him to write a piece for his use. The
result was happily produced at the psycho-
logical moment.
From the play the feminine element has
been ruthlessly eliminated. That th' : s omis-
sion was intentional is obvious on comparir"
the biography with the play. In the
b oaraphy the first patient to be treated for
rabies is an Alsatian boy named Joseph
Meister. who is brought to the Ecole Normal®
by bis mother. In the play he is brought
by his srrandfather. Also in Act IV.. which
is devoted to a tender interview between the
grateful boy and Pasteur, the author is
oaieful to cause the boy to be presented to
Madame Pasteur off the stage. B-sides
Pa.teui there are in the scanty cast a
doctor who gives the first inoimlntions for
tables m JBBi>, under the direction of
Pasteur; the subject of the experi-
ment; Joseph Master: five pupils; and the
of t | ie , Romib,ic (Carnot) and of
the Academy of Medicine.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Cactus Flower.
Once, long ago, I crept in quick delight
To where the garden lay as in a swoon
In the ineffable great arms of night.
About her were the sleeping flowers strewn.
The wild convolvulus had closed her cup,
The rose lay flushed with slumber’s dainty
wine,
Jasmine her languorous spices yielded up,
And every tendril of the sweet-pea vine
Like a babe’s sleepy fingers w T as upcurled
In drowsy clinging to a day-time treasure.
There was no smallest sound in all the w r orld
But my heart beating to a charmed
measure.
And as I gazed the sandalled moonlight
stole
Upon a silver path the garden through,
To where, pale-gleaming on a great tree’s
bole,
A slumb’ring cactus-bud lay drenched in
dew.
There stirred a whispered name upon the
breeze.
And a low-murmured laugh of full content
Woke from dim dreams the shadowy cluster-
ing trees.
Broke on a sigh, and into silence went.
Then borne upon a sudden argent flood
That seemed like some great pearl dis-
solved in air,
Floated in ecstasy the cactus-bud
And slipped into the moonlight’s bosom
there.
And lo! there pierced a radiance to her heart
That waked to pulsing all her petals white,
Till clinging tip from tip so loth to part
Strained open to a miracle of light.
A glory steeped her who in dreams had dozed ;
Gleaming she passed from bud to splendid
flower,
As if an ivory casket, ages closed.
Oped to a magic touch in that still hour.
And I, enchanted, thought it but a dream,
A phantom frail that in sleep’s garden
grew,
And hid it deep where jewelled
gleam
Until vou taught me that the dream was
true 1

Release.
Another dawn : more torture and more strain !
How shall these quivering nerves respond
to more?
How wait to meet that grim ambassador
Who signs my passport with the pen of pain?
Ah, pitying God, it comes, it comes again!
Oh, dull my senses, still them, I implore..
’Tis past: is pain the creaking of the door
That opens outward into Heaven’s domain?
Music and light. ...am I unconscious now?
New colors glow beneath my wondering
sight;
I hear new grades of sound, breath after
breath;
I see my thoughts in form 1 see them —
how ?
Light, light is everywhere, and I am Light!
And this is Para— God! There is no death!

I Have No Lover.
I have no lover. No, not I! But lam free —
Free as the morning wind, the swaying tree,
The fleecy cloud. What should I want with
him
When all the world to ocean’s silver rim
Is spread for me? What need have I of love
While there are starry heavens spread above?
Oh, I have seen men’s ways!
Once, long ago—there have been other days.
But now I watch; and many things I’ve
seen;
Much have I learned the while I looked
between
Down-drooping lashes, and it seems to me
’Tis better free.
And, too, of other women’s hearts I sing.
Those that I know, and nowise guess. The
Spring
Contents me. And the stars, the flowers, a
tree
Goldenly clad; a glimpse of summer sea
Between the yellow sand-dunes as the sun
Is setting; and the hush when day is done.
Others may dream and sigh,
And blush in fond deceit! But not so I.
I watch the shallow play a little while
As one would watch a children’s game and
smile —
But morning skies and sunlit earth and sea
Suffice for me.

The Truth.
I am prepared, dear heart, to swear
By all the gods there be,
Or anything beyond the gods,
That I am true to thee.
But still, if truth were to be told,
Sans flattery and ruth,
I, in my inmost soul, confess
That would not be the truth.
I do not fancy yon believe
The oath that’s sworn with ease:
But you admire the ardent zeal
It shows in me to please.
Let this suffice: my heart so loves
That it seems well worth while
To swear a large though perjured oath
To win your flattered smile.

AUSTRALIA AS A FIELD FOR
COLONISATION.
It is a steady rule of life that when a small
nation —small in numbers or fighting power
or both —possesses something which has be-
come of surpassing value it is all up with
that small nation. There was a time when
the canal-making industry was revived and
improved, and when the introduction of steam
made- the narrow, treacherous Red Sea a
highway for big ships instead of a grave-
yard. When these things happened it was
all up with debilitated Egypt as a sort of
self-governing Power, for it owned an isth-
mus that had been worth 2d. but was now
worth millions; and everybody began to take
a fatal interest in the sick Power. Nica-
ragua was also the owner of an isthmus and
a practicable road which became of immense
value when the gold rush started to Cali-
fornia and canal routes between the Atlantic
and Pacific rose to a premium. Morgan
and Garrison ran a service across by
the San Juan River, Lake Nicaragua and
(where a short canal was required to make
things complete) the Transit road. They
financed Walker, the Yankee fiilibuster, who
went out to “regenerate” the country and
ultimately make it part of the United States.
Vanderbilt, a rival shipowner, sent men of
his ow T n to regenerate Nicaragua. The
British authorities, who wanted a monopoly
<of shipping, canal-promoting and regenerat-
ing, recognised a nameless nigger whom they
called Robert as king of some Indians on
the Atlantic coast, and took possession in
his name of one side of the luckless country,
while- Walker raged at the other. As it
happened, attention was diverted to the
rival route of Panama, the possession of
which was naturally disastrous to its weak
original owner, Colombia. So Nicaragua
has preserved a shadow of its poor little
independence to date bv keeping its route
closed and sacrificing the profits. But it will
come up for judgment if it ever pays some
big Power to use the lake road again.
Everybody knew that the finish of the
Transvaal and the Orange Free State was
in sight when rich gold and diamonds were
found in these feeble political properties.
They had been shoved out of the empire and
told' to sink or swim for themselves when
they were considered valueless, but with the
new finds it was realised that the blessings
of union were due again. Denmark had no
gold or diamond m.nes to be stolen, but it
was in the same category as Egypt and
Nicaragua—a weak State with an isthmus
which a strong State wanted to build a
canal on. Mexico was obviously up a tree
when the great race for westwaid expan-
sion between the slave-owning south and
the anti-slave north of Uncle Sam s country
set in, and the only expansion ground west
of the slave States was Mexico, a place
which once spread so far north as to touch
Canada. A pious reason for annexing the
upper half of the Latin Republic had to be
found. In all these cases and many others
that could be quoted the reason assigned for
looting the State which had a men jewel and
no burglar-proof safe to keep it in was so
pious that it imposed on most people. That
is because the big aggressive Dower can
afford to own the newspapers which tell the
story. If Australia was absolutely “on if 3
own” and the inducement seemed sufficient,
this country would be in process of invasion
now to put down the disorders in North
Queensland, protect foreign residents aud
property, and maintain the authority of the
feeble Government. Quite a good case for
interference could be made out, the story
beginning with “The Most Important Town
in the Hands of the Rebels” and going on
with “The Spread of Disaffection,” aud the
other stereotyped headlines. The y case of
Paul Freeman alone would justify the
occupation of Melbourne, that person having
been murdered in cold blood (oh paper) by
Watt's orders.
* * # *
There is, it is true, about £G00,000,000 less
gold in Australia as a temptation for inter-
national thieves than there was in 1850;
and in some respects the reputation of the
island-continent hasn’t improved. It has
been discovered that there is no inland sea,
though there are countless brine lakes; that
the second biggest river system isn’t like
the Mississippi, but perishes of thirst in the
interior; and that an enormous p -, oportion
of the country has no rain calculated to
cause a leakage in the roof. Still it is prob-
able _ that Australia is twice better worth
stealing—plausibly and with moral snuffle
or by plain brutality—than it ever was be-
fore and that its value will increase. The
demand for mere standing-room, if it isn’t
absolute rock and sand, has grown wonder-
tuliy in recent years. During the period
between 1851 and 1911, thanks to improved
medical science and other circums.ances,
Europe gained about as much population as
in all the previous time since the first para-
graph of Genesis. Between 1801 and 1911
it nearly quadrupled its population, as far
as estimates go. Yet it was the great period
of emigration, when Europe was throwing
new nations off its chest and using up the
spare globe, and when it also struck the idea
of cleaning and draining Asia and Africa
and making new colored nations as fast as
possible to limit the space available for emi-
grants. During last century the United
States supplied the great outlet for the over-
flow of Great Britain, Germany and other
countries, though with all this overflow they
are in more need of an outlet than ever
before. It is a sign of how the old outlet is
being used up that at last census one of the
States in the American Union had 508 people
to the square mile; another 419; another
“37; and the District of Columbia —-Uncle
Sam’s Canberra —had 5518. Therefore the
demand for Australia is bound to increase.
If it finds work in abundance for desirable
immigrants—not merely land that is far
below the’ average, but ordinary drought-
proof employment of the manufacturing
kind, in which line it is as good a country as
any other—and attracts desirable immi-
grants, it will become a garrisoned fortress
like the United States. If it remains empty
- —a borrowing, importing, non-industrial
freak— hen it will rank as unoccupied terri-
tory waiting for annexation. The definition
of unoccupied territory now is quite differ-
ent from that of 1851, to say nothing of
1801.
* * * *
The great war has damaged Australia’s
position among the nations. In 1913 the
world held eight Great Powers, and their
relative importance was hard to estimate.
Still, some good authorities, making a rough
guess at their aggressive strength when land
and sea forces were combined, and making
allowance for relative degrees of prepared-
ness, put them thus: Germany (1) ; British
Empire (2) ; France (3) ; United States
(4) ; Italy (5) ; Russia, regarded strictly
as a European Power, (6) ; Japan (7) ; Aus-
tria (8). Now two are off the list, and the
order looks more like this: United States
(1) ; British Empire (21 ; Japan (3) ;
Fiance (4); Germany (5); Italy (6).
France has deteriorated through its stupend-
ous losses, and so has Britain. The Pacific
Powers have risen very high, for the com-
bined losses of Japan and the U.S. were
only about 50.000 men, and their gains were
large. Also the U.S., having large interests
in this direction, .is l’kely to devote much
more attention to the Pacific than it used to
do. Formerly France was jambed between
the biggest and second biggest Power. Now
Australia looks I'ke being jambed between
the b : ggpst and the third on the list. The
two rising, or rather risen, Powers are be-
coming mixed, and mixed very close to our
borders. On the principle that two lions
on the same shore, however friendly to
begin with, always find each other a nuisance
one day or other, Australia’s particular
ocean is going to be a serious battle-ground
for the first time in modern history. One
party to the probable argument is very badly
pressed for room. The other, having multi-
plied its population fourfold in 60 years, is
tend’ng that way. Bulging consn:cuous 1 y
on their battle-ground is the one big empty
country on earth which isn’t frozen —the
only one which makes it a sort of gospel to
keen away population by restricting employ-
ment in the interests of import°rs and absen-
tee capitalists. And Australia’s’ assert’on
of its status as a semi-independent member
of the League of Nations, -’nstead of a mere
eo’ony and section of the Empire, makes it
look a more promising sneeulat-’on than of
old to raise the question whether this is
really unoccupied territory awa'ting coloni-
sation. When the problems aris’ng out of
the war ha' 7 ° time to take shape they pro-
mise to be full of interest.
AUSTRALIA AND THE GREAT
PEACE DREAM.
The war against Prussianism being over, and
a League of Nations which has a satisfac-
tory appearance to Britishers having been
formed, there is a tendency to conclude that
human nature has been revolutionised, and
that the thing which has crucified mankind
since history began is a horror of the past.
Already representatives of the workers —the
class which must suffer most by an unsuc-
cessful war—are talking of the abolition of
compulsory service; the military autnorities
are shelving the veterans of the A.I.F.
wherever possible, the idea being to use the
army as a means of livelihood for those who
were connected with it before the war; and
the Navy promises to be Australian in name
only in a year or so. A small and purely
ornamental army, and a navy whose chief
purpose is to provide entertainments and an
occasional husband, would be more or less
in the picture if the League of Nations satis-
fied everybody. But it does nothing of the
sort, and one of the nat.ons must bitterly
distrustful of it is Japan. China, whose
national spirit is rapkny developing along
Caucasian lines, is not even on speaking
terms with the scheme. The objection lodged
agamst it by the Asiatic press, to quote the
S. M. Herald (9/7/T9), is that Britain
“must come to occupy a position in the
League similar to that occupied by Prussia
in tne German confederacy, and by co-oper-
ating with the United States a position of
perpetual Anglo-Saxon dominance will be
established.” The view may be unjust, but
it is honestly held, and it happens that Aus-
tralia is one of the countries which is most
imperilled by it.
In the current number of Science Pro-
gress Major-General Boss analyses in an
impartial spirit why nations make war.
Having suggested a number of reasons, legi-
timate and otherwise —chief among the
former being injuries to national or racial
pride—he concludes; “But it is o'nly a sense
of absolute security as between nations, the
eradication of ambition and the existence of
comfort and prosperity amongst'all classes
and conditions of men, which can give im-
munity from war.” Most reasonable people
will agree with this, though it involves the
recognition of a number of unpleasantnesses.
There is nothing resembling universal pros-
perity in Australia much less in Japan ; the
world'has never felt less secure, internation-
ally ; and ambition still flourishes, more par-
ticularly amongst the proud and capable
race which inhabits the neighborhood of the
Commonwealth’s back door. Japan aimed
by its secret treaty with Russia, in 1910, at
a half-share in the domination of China ; by
the Versailles treaty it has secured a prac-
tical monopoly. It emerges from the war
with a more efficient army, a relatively
stronger navy, an immensely increased mer-
cantile marine, a decreased debt and a won-
derful grorvth in wealth, represented by
added trade and manufactures. One of the
chief outlets of its growing commerical
activities is inevitably Australia. It is
absurd to imitate the mummery of the old
diplomacy in such matters, and to refrain
from saying aloud what the whole world is
thinking. It was that idiotic policy which
helped to prolong and nearly lose the war
for Britain. And the Japanese are the last
to be impressed by anything of the sort.
Between them and us there is the unbridg-
able gulf of race. The very men who are
now talking disarmament in Australia are
members of the class which would be ruined
by the logical result of such a policy; that
is. by the arrival here of unlimited numbers
of Japanese workers. Their justification is
a belief in the Brotherhood of Man, the doc-
trine which failed so badly in the case of the
Hun socialists, but which would be expected
to operate as regards the Japanese in the
direction of making them refrain from taking
their Australian brothers’ jobs. For those
who don’t support disarmament, and who
believe in keeping the blood of the nation
pure, there is but one policy in the very
awkward circumstances, a„nd that is to see
that Australia is placed in such a position
that it will be too dangerous to be worth
attacking on a racial or any other issue.
» * * *
What is being done, or even seriously
discussed, in the way of practical defence
measures? Absolutely nothing! If tne
Commonwealth were attacked to-morrow it
would find itself not only almost weaponless
and munitionless, but without the means to
manufacture guns or shells. In the last
few weeks both heavier- and lighter-than-
air machines have crossed the Atlantic, and
the fact has profoundly impressed the Gov-
ernments of the world—outside Australia. The
machines we have here find difficulty in fly-
ing between a couple of Victorian towns;
and the fact in no way disturbs the Gov-
ernment. Yet anyone who was in England
or France during the closing stages of the
fighting had it vividly impressed on him that
the flying arm is going to be the weapon
when war breaks loose again. During the
final battles on the Somme the airmen, in
addition to their normal work of aerial
photography and reconnaissance, helped the
cavalry to destroy the bolting divisions,
reconnoitred for tanks and infantry, identi-
fied guns in action for the artillery, blew* up
railway stations and junctions and dumps,
and even carried small-arms ammunition lo
the front-line trenches. People who were in
London or in any English East Coast town
during 1917 will remember the damage the
primitive German aircraft d'd then; mon-
sters of destruction have since been de-
signed capable of bombing Berlin from Lon-
don. England removed the German air
menace in time —by becoming so strong m
the air that it was suicidal to fly over Eng-
lish territory. A certain feature of the next
war w'll be the whoVsale invasion of ql-
defended countries by aircraft. If Australia’s
northern coast-line is reached, the bombard-
ment of the big'cities and towns of the
Commonwealth will be a simple affair —pro-
vided we are still, as now, devoid of anti-
aircraft guns and detachments able to use
them, and without up-to-date machines and
practised fighting air-men.
* * * *
This continent’s first line of defence for
many years to come must, of course, be
its navy. Since it is impossible to import
a national Australian spirit from England,
and since without it our navy will never
be of value as an isolated force, the imme-
diate duty of the politicians is to take mea-
sures to retain those Australians who are
already in it, and to attract others to re-
place officers and men on loan from the
It.X. The Jekram Committee’s recommenda-
tions resulted last May in a number of re-
forms which have left the R.X. more con-
tented than it has been in all its history.
The R.A.N. is discontented, and till the
causes are removed it will remain a poor
national investment, if not a danger. Again,
some of the world’s best flying men are
either in Australia now or on the way here.
There are men available for the A.A.F. with
an intimate knowledge of the staff side of
air-fighting in both the British and French
armies; if they are employed it will he
unnecessary to send anyone on a joy-trip to
study conditions abroad- There are men
with administrative experience in and out
of the field ; one such had command of half
the A.A.F. in France. There are skilled
pilots, bombers and machine-gunners by tne
score; and there are instructors by the
dozen. At present the chief aim of the
authorities seems to be to push them into
private life. If the Government checks that
tendency before it is too late, and if it gives
its chosen experts a fair deal as regards
modern machines and equipment generally,
the inhabitants of this country will be justi-
fied in feeling a lot more secure than they
can now. If the Defence question in all its
aspects is allowed to drift, or if it is ex-
ploited in th’e interests of influential ineffici-
ents, a dozen Leagues of Nations will not
save Australia from attack and possible de-
struction.
BOUGHT SHIPS.
Though the manner of doing it is bad.
probably the best thing has been done over
the Shipping problem: Prime Minister
Hughes has intimated to the magnates of
the Shipping Conference that his Govern-
ment has come into the business to stay.
A few years ago the word “probably” would
have been left out; but tilings have changed:
Public Enterprise has grown to be unbeLev-
ably corrupt. Still, Public Ownership can’t
leave oft' altogether because a tty has got into
the works.
f * * *
In this business it is necessary to go ahead
on a big scale or else sell out and abandon
it _ altogether. A third or half-way course
might be imagined by sanguine folk—that
the Commonwealth fleet should become part
of the shipping combine like any privately-
owned fleet, obeying the orders of the com-
bine like any other member, and taking
what share of business came its way by
arrangement. But the combine shows no
sign of holding out the glad hand of friend-
ship to a Government concern, and, anyway,
it isn’t much of an idea to be a subordinate
member of a world-wide syndicate. Besides,
the points of view of the Commonwealth
and the syndicate are wholly different. The
syndicate naturally wants to charge as much
as ever it can—as much as it believes can
be squeezed out of its customer Australia.
The Commonwealth wants to see how little
need be squeezed—how much, in short, can
be left for the producers of Australia. At
the best an arrangement between the two
could be only a compromise.
* * * *
Shipbuilding has been in progress hehe in
Australia some years in a snail-like way.
Something or. other, said to be the third
effort of its kind, though it was a mere cargo-
carrying effort calculated to hump 5500 tons
deadweight, was launched the other day at
Sydney. The proceeding was regarded as
so extraordinary that the Governor-General
and State Premier were both present. But
Hughes has apparently little faith in his
ability to .“speed up” the Australian ship-
building industry—in fact, he has never
shown much faith or interest in any Aus-
tralian industry, though of late his talk has
been full of promise. So an order has been
with a firm in England for three
22.500-tonners, with presumably more to
follow; and they are all to be ready in about
tw T o years. Ship building is, however, quite
as important to Australia as skipomniwp. At
the moment it is even more important. Aus-
tralia is clamoring for employment on a
vast scale to prevent its returned soldiers
from taking to the disastrous trade of revo-
lution, and men are being shoved almost by
force _ and at great expense into the very
questionable wheat-growing business. Vic-
toria alone talks of spending £10.000,000 in
one act to. subsidise the precarious trade.
Yet even in this time of stress the con-
tinuous occupation of shipbuilding, with a
permanent local demand for the product, is
regarded as so hopeless by Ministers who
lack the organising capacity that large
orders are placed in England for prompt de-
livery, while our own country struggles
with one or two little cargo-carriers de-
livered on the Day of Judgment. The
British Isles have 160 yards devoted to the
construction. of sizeable vessels, but nothing
of the. sort is likely to happen here so long
as it is the assumption that this -country is
only entitled to . the skim-milk of industry
while the cream is for strangers.

Whether the Australian will develop into
a great seafarer no one can say. In the
70 years since he really began to develop
he has lived in a whirl of gold boom, silver
and copper boom, land boom and loan boom,
finishing up with war and industrial insur-
rection. and he hasn’t taken definite form
.vet. One thing is certain—no race ever
became a sea-power with bought ships. All
the. way from Tyre to the United States,
talcng . Carthage. Athens, Ven'ce, Genoa.
Byzantium, Portuanl, Spain, Holland and
Britain on the road, the sea-king has built
his own ships. Incidentally, the fact that
Australia has only 5 000.000 people is no
proof that it is is incapable of being its
own ark-builder. It doesn’t, in the first
place, require more than half as many ships
as it uses. They exist largely to carry
many raw materials 12 000 miles further
than they nerd go if this was a manufactur-
ing country—to hump raw wool (and dirt)
and raw ore (and dirt) and raw hides (and
dirt) and unground wheat (with trade


offal) for which there should be a local
market among the industrial population, and
to bring back finished goods that shouldn t
require bringing. A community wh.ch
learned to make its own ships would learn
to make other things. Then it wouldn’t
need such an absurd number of ships in pro-
portion to population. In the last year of
peace the United States depended on the im-
porter to the extent of only one-fifth as
much as Australia. This country would
set itself no extraordinary task if it decided
to be its own seaman in the fullest sense of
the term —not an amateur afloat in a pur-
chased tub with a mortgage dragging behind
it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Peril of the Old Men.
If the Kaiser really is surrendered for trial,
and if on being- surrendered 'he is got into
the dock and found guilty of a fraction of
the crimes of which the world suspects him,
and if he is then adequately punished—in
the event of these unlikely th.ngs happening,
a principle of great value to mankind will
have been established. For centuries now
the old men have been making the wars and
the young ones have been fighting them.
The boys who were called on to die before
they had properly begun to live did not
know in most cases why they were fighting.
The censorship, which became more and
more rigid in proportion to the magnitude
of the nation’s task, saw to that. If they
inquired into the merits of any particular
campaign they were told —as in the South
African War—that a patriot's one principle
in such matters was expressed in the apho-
rism : “My country, right or wrong.” While
the youths went through hell, the oldsters
lived in comfort. When the war ended the
old men continued to live in comfort, but the
fighting-men who survived returned, in many
cases, to neglect and indigence. Tims Field-
Marshal Haig told the Pensions Select Com-
mittee a week or two ago that some disabled
ex-officers of this last war were starving
and numbers were living in poverty. When
the war was a success the o’d men —the
politicians, the diplomats and the political
soldiers —reaped the high honors they had
gambled for with the lives and welfare of
others. When the war was a failure they
were left in a position to organise another.
If the Kaiser is found guilty of crimes
analogous to murder and punished accord-
ingly. it should make the heads of States
careful in future of starting wars, and even
more careful of how they wage them. It
may be that the Kaiser is morally innocent,
If the statements of Hinoenberg, Luden-
dorff and others are true, neither he nor
the Crown Prince deserves more than about
seven days, or a. 40s. fine. It may be that
they were futile puppets in the hands of
other criminals. In that case the safety of
mankind demands that the real malefactors
should be put to serious trial. The point is
to establish the fact that henceforth an un-
just or wickedly waged war is going to be
as dangerous for the highly-placed people at
home as for the humble persons in the field.
That done, the tremendous sensitiveness of
chancelleries and the sabre-rattlings of
Courts should be greatly lessened.
His Minor Excellency Speaks a Piece.
When Governor Stanley spoke his bit of
patter at the opening of the Vic. State Leg-
islature in Melbourne he naturally said that
it was necessary to promote setdemen*" and
develop the great natural resources of the
country. To that end £10,000,000 is to be
spent by way of a beginning in order to nx
returned soldiers on the land,. and the Mallee
country was specially mentioned as usual.
The railways that are opening or to open
it up were also specially mentioned as
usual. No official patter at the opening oi
a Legislature in Melbourne or elsewhere
would be complete or in order without some
such remarks. Ten millions is roughly £ll4
per square mile of the whole State, or about
3s. 7d. per acre of the whole State, or £7
per inhabitant, so it requires a lot of money
to promote land-hunger in the country dis-
tricts, though the thing once grew sponta-
neously. In the brief space between 1912 and
1917 Victoria built exactly 500 miles of new
railway in order to promote settlement
under the management of people in Mel-
bourne, with the result that it lost 53,887
settlers —23,190 from country towns and
30,(597 off the land itself. As a set-off Mel-
bourne, where the people who control the
railways and organise the land settlement
live, gained 79,810 people. One theory is that
the people left the land because the decay of
the country towns, through all industries and
shipping moving steadily Melbourne-wards
(just as in other States they moved
steadily towards Sydney or Adelaide or
Perth), made them feel more and more lone-
some and uncivilised and backblocky. In
1912 Victoria had 746.651 .country, inhabi-
tants scattered along 3639 miles of line (say
205 per mile of line), while in 1917 there
were 692.764 to 4139 miles of line (167 to
each mile). So in that short time they be-
came a good deal wider apart, and had to
holler more loudly to communicate with each
other, and travel further to meet their best
girl. What was worse, they became, fur-
ther from a market. This removal of coun-
try settlers to the city was effected by iln
expenditure of about £9.000.000 in railway
construction, so the expenditure of £10.000.000
ought to remove more. An outlay of
£50,000.000 should remove everybody. It is
not sufficiently recognised that the object
of a railway system, with all the lines con-
centrating on and managed from one city,
which is at once the commercial, financial,
manufacturing and political centre, is to
fetch people there, rot to carry them aw.ay
from there. A railway farther out isn’t
meant to "be in the nature of an emigrant
ship, but rather a relief expedition to bring
back the lost. Melbourne tries to be the
sole sea outlet for probably 100.000 or
110.000 square nr’les of country, inc’udine
the bit of N. S. Wales which trades wPb it
as a matter of oonvenmnee:
(N.S.W.), the natural outlet of Gippsland,
has no railway connection, and Portland is
kept dead on .purpose. Nowhere in the
world has a countiy made a great succe c s of
settlement under such unless tne
remote lands were of extraordinary fertility
or rich in minerals, or were served by rivers
navigable for big vessels. No country in
Western Europe dreams of attempting what
Victoria is trying and what Governor Stan-
ley patters about. The United States suc-
ceeds fairly well, by using practically all
the available harbors on both oceans and
its river and lake uorts, in keeping out of
Victory’s situation. The question is whether
it is worth while to attempt to convert the
Czar, who is Melbourne, to con? itu.ioual
ideas, or whether it would not be much
better to depose him as a bad job and cut
up the dominant. No Czar has ever been
converted. The pa v t of the State and the
adjo'nmg State of N. S. Wales which pros-
pers under Melbourne control obv oasly be-
longs to the Czar. The part which is going
to the dogs under his management is an
unnatural and artificial appanage, which
wants separation and a new Czar.
Work.
The outstanding feature of the seamen’s
strike all along has been a curious vague-
ness as to the “final objective.” It is not
higher wages or better cond.tions. Arbitra-
tion wou’d have given the seamen those
things, and their union bosses know it. The
essence of the propaganda which is now
being directed at the working-classes was
stated long ago in the famous p~-ise
“Demand upon demand, strike upon strike,
blow upon blow until the Capitalist State
is destroyed.” Yet not one Australian
unionist in 50 wants to see the “Capital'st
State” —which is to say Australia —de-
stroyed. He strikes for quite different
reasons: in part for more money and com-
fort, of course, but much more because he
has to, and because revolt, the aftermath of
all great wars, is in the air. It lias produced
a revival of the age-old dream that if only
things are broken on a sufficiently heroic
scale, an era of universal loafing will dawn.
The view was naively voiced last week by
the Sydney Worker in a series of scan-
dalised gasps : : —■
Lloyd Georte, fresh from his misdeeds at Paris,
told the workers of Britain that they inrst greatly
increase their output. They are “NOT PRODUCING
ENOUGH.” •
“Permeate Australia with your spirit,” said
Hughes to the Diggers in London. “Go back —AND
WORK.”
That is to be our “New World.” if the Rich can
arrange it so. Work, work —more work I
Strike-leaders and journals like the Worker
are ti'emendously eloquent, but they never
get down to details. What have the people
who make a living by talking revolution
got to offer in place of work? They propose
Syndicalism—the owning of every industry
by the Union. But that would not do away
with labor. On the contrary, labor would
have to be more strenuous, in order to pro-
duce the same results, because of the absence
of scientific management. Whether the
worker in certain callings gets as much of
the fruits of his labor as he ought to get is
questionable. Whether his conditions are
what they should be is also questionable.
These are matters for inquiry; and they
demand inquiry—constant inquiry and con-
stant adjustment. But to lure men on to
revolution by holding out the promise of a
long, long loaf is criminal.

A New Storm Centre.
The Prime Minister of Japan has at any
rate given fair notice to ail concerned :
I do not believe that the League relieves any
nation of the obligation of developing its own
strength. Japan must make further efforts.
And within the next few hours this report
came through : —•
The Japanese military commander in Trans-Baikalia
has protested to the Chinese Government against the
movement of Chinese troops on the Mongolian border
as being a violation of the Chino-Japanese agree-
ment.
The Chino-Japanese agreement, which the
Peace Conference felt itself powerless to
interfere with, is so far-reaching that the
hapless Chow is even remonstrated with for
moving troops in his own territory. Japan
is in a far better position than Germany
occupied in 1913. It has much the same
area, a bigger population, a great army and
navy (relatively much greater than they
were through the destruction or detenorat.on
of various rivals), and the same feverish in-
dustrial expansion which calls for new
markets; and it wants colonies, while in
1913 Germany had them. It has two
supreme advantages—the countries handy to
it are broken Russia, that rich old piece of
smashed crockery called China, and empty
Australia, instead of Britain, France and
Imperial Russia ; and all the Powers except
the United States are too tired to argue
much, whereas Germany ran up against
them when they were fresh. So Japan, like
the Hun, proposes to put up “further
efforts.” On the other side, the United States
threatens in future to maintain three fleets
—one in the Atlantic which doesn’t require
so much police work now that three navies
have vanished off the waters, and two in the
Pacific, one of them being on the Asiatic
coast. Busy times may therefore happen in
these seas, where Formosa, the toe of the
Japanese Empire, is nearly in s'ght of the
U.S. Empire in the> Philippines, and the tail'
of the U.S. Empire isn’t far off our own
heated property in Papua. We are no
longer remote. We no longer have the
security of splendid isolation. How do we
propose to meet our changed and still-
changing circumstances?

Sugar.
It is estimated that as much as 170.000 tons
of nigger sugar may be imported to feed
White Australia dur’ng this financial year.
White Australia having left off da’ng white
labor to an even greater degree than usual.
The Government, in reply to the regulation
cry about the eo?t of l ! vine. steaie-'te-
ont that it oou’dn’t promise that the price
of won’t go un except as regards the
Oueensland which it has bought itseff.
For the rest the mgger. or rather the prop'e
who exploit the nigger, will fix the cost, as the
outside exploiter always does in countries
that are not self-dept nde'nt. In 1916-17,
wh.ch was reckoned a bad year, the importa-
tion of cane-sugar ran as high as 118,111 tons;
but things have become worse s.nce then.
Sugar-growing has its stronghold in North
and Cential Queensland, where semi-revolu-
tionary condit.ons, which are largely the
work of disgruntled aliens, are hand.eappirig
all industry. No earthly reason ex.sts, how-
ever, why beet-sugar grow.ng should not
be a big element of mixed farming in Vic-
toria and N. S. Wales, and posuoly in S.
AustraLa and Westralia. There is a great
local market, while for any additional wheat-
growing there is only a precarious and re-
mo. e foreign market. And even when there
is a local market for both products, beet,
judged by the experience of France, Ger-
many and Austria, pays the bigger divi-
dends. Unfortunately, Australia hasn’t yet
learned to take its agriculture seriously. The
generation isn’t finished yet which bought
from the Government for a song the land
which the Government got for nothing, and
settled down to grow a few perfunctory
shrubs while waiting for the loan railways
and the loan roads and the loan population
to fix things so that it could sell out at 400
or 800 per cent, profit. Partly owing to
this state of mind, and partly because the
One Big City policy is emptying the country
towns and mak’ng the market more remote,
no new agricultural industries of any size
have been founded in the last 40 or 50 years,
though some have faded or died. Hence
even the news that there is a big and increas-
ing local demand for sugar has caused no
vis'ble movement. But in a crazy, upside-
down fashion it has caused fierce grumbling
about the jam factories, especially those that
do an export trade, because they use up
large quantities of sugar, and thus offer
Work to the primary producer if he would
only do it. There is a sjnrlar plaint also
ag"inst local confectioners, who, some people
hold, should be discouraged and their goods
replaced by imported stuff, for they likewise
use up sugar. These are among the very few
lines of manufactured food in which, for the
year to June. 1918. the Commonwealth not
only supplied itself, and was thus independent
of the importing curse, but had a surplus to
sell abroad. The jam export business alone
brought a surplus of £1,418 500 into the
country to help pay our foreign liatrlities.
Yet there is this demand that jam and its
allied fruit business and confectionery should
be pushed less strenuously and a lot of then-
workers discharged, for no better reason
than that the agriculturist hasn’t kept up
the supply of raw- material! Surely the
slaughter of infant industries for want of
raw material comes rather early in this
mostlv-empty and unused land. It has a
horrble of Herod at Bethlehem
about it.

The Topmost Cockatoo.
Dear Bulletin, —An impression prevails in
many quarters that because a talking cocka-
too is an extra-successful cockatoo therefore
he is wasting his time by being a cockatoo,
and coul<j make a chest of drawers if he
tried. This delusion applies to —among other
people—the new generation of Ministers.
When anybody is unusually critical about
purely elocutionary government and purely
barnstorming finance, it is the habit of the
cockatoo politician to admit reluctantly that
he is sorry he ever took up the ungrateful
trade of public affairs, where the highest
prize is perhaps £35 a week salary, seeing
that, with his obvious talents, he could have
made more in almost any other walk of life.
This is a pleasing delusion —assuming that it
is a delusion. The only other place the cocka-
too person w-ould shine is the Church —-some
stirring hysterical kind of Church —and in
that poor game it is real success if one shines
to the extent of £6 a week. He doesn’t scin-
tillate in the law, for the reason that the
law is a matter requiring an exact and
studious mind as well as a large mouth. He
doesn’t shine at medicine, which requires
intense application if the practitioner aims
to be up-to-date and high in his profession.
In journalism he is only a blower-off of
fireworks, and there is much competition
and little profit in the blowing-off business.
As a business man his record is apt to be
disastrous because he can’t charge his losses
to the taxpayer. In the beginning he is, as a
rule, one of the multitude of fervid, inexact
orators, with a neglected trade in the back-
ground. He rises to be an organiser, and
at this stage he leaves the vast majority of
his class behind. Fie becomes a man in the
running, a favored candidate, a party man
in Parliament, a Minister, and finally, for the
very few, the man at the top. Judds and
Brookfields and Gardens and S. A.
Rosas and, a trifle higher, men like Hard-
acre and Pearce just miss discoursing
themselves on to the top branch. Among
them there is the same lack of versatility,
the same absence of any indication that
they could make a decent living—not a
scrambling existence, but something at least
equal to a Member’s salary—outside the
cockatoo business. The most successful
have climbed highest because their talk was
best. As a rule they have been too
busy to take more than a perfunctory in-
terest in other pursuits, and that unfits them
for the precise job oU’publie finance, wlrc'h
is the great job in a mortgaged country like
this. A few of them become barristers, but
not the kind that are employed in intricate
financial or technical cases —there is a
terrace of Premiers of that sort down the
east coast of Australia. They don’t become
solicitors—-the men w-ho sit in offices and
have little eloquence to do. I don’t know
if there is any remedy for this state of things,
though it might be desirable to enact that
every Premier and Treasurer should pass
examinations and take a degree in Political
Economy and should also possess an ac-
countant’s certificate. The law man of
the Government has to possess a legal cer-
tificate. and the idea that the money-man
needs nothing but a secret nomination given
in caucus by men who in many cases don’t
know a financial expert from a crow, is
absurd. Apart from this sus-gestion I merely
enter my protest aga-'nst the idea that the
cockatoo on.the top branch, simfely because
he is on the top Ranch, is wasted as a
cockatoo and is capable of a bank
o- paintine masterpieces.—Yours, etc.,

Can History Be Truthful?
“Morlancourt” has doubts about it
Charles Beak, the Commonwealth war-recorder,
stated last week that in his history he will tell
“the whole truth about the part played by the
A.1.F.” There was a time when I took history at
its face-value, but I know now that veracity, much
less bold candor, has little to do with it. Dreadful
mistakes were made by highly-placed officers, mis-
takes which caused the loss of hundreds of members
of the A.I.F. Some of those who were to blame
went back to Australia; others were rewarded with
decorations and otherwise. Will the historian weigh
the facts and apportion the blame fairly in dis-
regaid of the libel laws?
Will his picture reveal the shadows as well as
the lights even so far as the lower ranks are
concerned ? Is he in a position to expose the
shirkers at the same time as he gives the heroes
their due? Every base camp in England and
France contained its quota of notorious frauds —
men who wore the same uniform as Murray and
Jacka, and yet never dreamt of risking their skins.
Some of them had visited the line for a week or so
and then got out; many had not even done as
much as that. These men dealt with the genuine
soldiers who came under their authority in much
the same spirit as their prototypes in Australia
are now dealing with distinguished returned mem-
bers of the A.I.F. They got rid of them without
delay. There were colonels who had lengthy careers
in the A.I.F. without so much as seeing the dust
raised by a shell on the distant horizon. Some of
them got C.M.G.’s, others D.S.O.’s. And there were
adjutants who adjutanted steadily in England for
years, and collected M.D.E.’a at the finish. Will
Bean impartially weigh the value of their services
to the A.I.F. and express an opinion on. the value
or otherwise to the reputation and moral of an
army of a body of officers who would neittier do
the job they nominally went away to do nor go
home so long as they could keep a soft billet ?
Our big cities are teeming with elderly colonels
who wear the uniform immortalised on Anzac and at
Villers-Bretonneux because they went as O'.O. troops
aboard transports—the easiest, safest and most
luxurious military duty yet invented. Will Bean
distinguish between warriors like these and the real
article?
It is casting no reflection on a man who has done
his own work admirably up to a point to say that
he won’t. The true history of the A.1.F., the correct
estimate of many of the prominent names associated
with it, will never be written. It will be related
by word of mouth alone. I never realised the infor-
mative advantages of oral tradition, and contrari-
wise the unreliability of the written word, until I
participated, in however small a way, in the making
of history, and read afterwards what the historians
had to say about it.
The “Social Evil.”
“Feminist” continues the controversy: —
The question is, seeing that the public would be
asked to recognise the “registered house’’ as a social
institution, necessary (in a passing sense, at any
rate) to the safety of the race, could 6uch house be
branded as a house of vice?" And can society afford
to publicly recognise vice in any shape or form?
Further (1) does The Bulletin stand for a dual
standard of morality for men and -women? (2)
Would The Bulletin include with the registration
of such houses the registration of all patrons
thereof, seeing that medical authorities do not
guarantee the registered house to insure the com-
munity from disease; and the patron who went home
to his wife, or, more disastrous still, to the servant
girl, would be a secret menace to the Public Health?
With regard to The Bulletin’s assurance that
low wages are a smaller factor in prostitution than
many people imagine, there is only this to be said —
all social and economic history is against the state-
ment. The fact that women during the last four
years have been much better off financially and
much worse morally does not help the assertion one
jot. Women, rightly or wrongly, have during the
last four years more nearly approximated to men
in their rebellion against personal restraints. Like
Lombroso’s “most determined prostitutes—women
of means” —these women, in a period of world-wide
human hysteria that went nigh to dementia, have
emulated their brothers in dissolute as in industrial
proficiency. Why then lump them as prostitutes ?
A certain percentage certainly were so in the narrow
or generally-accepted sense; but in bulk - they were
only prostitutes in so far as the men who accom-
modated them were also prostitutes. I do not claim
that equal pay for equal work done will make all
women more moral; but it will cut out the need
for prostitution on their part—a need which is, or
should be, the white man’s shame.
Venereal disease is a modern problem that must
be fought apart from prostitution, seeing that most
of the actors in the grand tragedy are well out
of range of either the registered or the private
bagnio.
Perhaps the most rational solution of the “social
evil,” as of some other of our modern “dead ends,”
is, to treat all generations save the one in maternal
arms as beyond redemption, and to concentrate on
educating that one, so that it will at least begin
life with its eyes open- and trained to recognise
facts. Social regeneration may then commence.
In reply:—
Society can not only afford to recognise vice, but
it is, in duty and in self-defence, bound to do so,
just as it has to recognise crime, lunacy, influenza,
garbage and other unpleasantnesses. Society’s
genteel habit of pretending that vice was not there
has been the staunchest bulwark of venereal disease
in the past.
As regards morality, The Bulletin in this matter
does not stand for a dual or any other standard.
The moral appeal no doubt does its share in the
controlling of the procreative instinct, and to that
extent it helps in the fight against disease; but the
state of the hospitals is enough to show that
additional measures are needed. This paper is con-
centrating on those, measures, leaving the moral
aspect to be put by parents, the clergy and others.
It is indifferent as to whether certain edifices are
labelled “Houses of Vice” or are known by numbers
or by names. Such matters are immaterial. Its
whole case is that there is a terrible affliction in
our midst; that it should be removed ; and that no
steps to that end should be neglected. Certain
women are chrpnic sources of infection. In the
words of the Medical Journal for Australia
(21/6/’19): “Prostitution, regarded in a broad sense
of the word, is the main, breeding-ground for venereal
disease, over 25 per cent, of prostitutes suffering
from, and therefore spreading, the disease.” That
is why this paoer advocates control. To again quote
the current Medical Journal: “In spite o c difficul-
ties and the varying results of its adoption else-

where, supervision of prostitution seems the only
reasonable means of mitigating the evil.”
For the rest: (1) It is self-evidently impossible
to register the patrons of registered houses. It will
be time to begin registering men when such a re-
versal of human nature occurs that men are enabled
to support themselves by the sale of their bodies.
(2) It is not a rational or other solution of the
Social Evil to wait another couple of decades before
coping with it, and to then rely solely on verbal
appeal as a prophylactic—a method which never has
achieved anything considerable and never will. (3)
Of course The Bulletin advocates, and always has
advocated, a living wage for women. And of course
such a reform will minimise prostitution. But it
will not remove it, and so long as it exists it should
be controlled.
Which for the present ends the controversy.
The World and the Vatican.
“Mr. Cecil llarmsworth, Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, announced in the House of Commons
to-day that France had refused to have diplomatic
relations with the Vatican. Whether Britain would
continue her relations or not had not yet been
decided.”
France, in recent years, has been the same
scourge to Rome that Italy was under
Victor Emmanuel. In Pius IX.’s day the
Church lost 15 provinces and 21 million in-
habitants. Pius X., if the French have any-
thing to do with it, will lose his very
patrimony. And yet a Frenchman is a
Catholic or nothing, and probably always
will be. The national bitterness against the
Vatican is purely political, and goes back as
far as the closing days of the Franco-
Prussian War, when every Frenchman knew
that Rome—for whose cause French soldiers
had died in thousands during the preceding
20 years—was negotiating with Germany for
the Pope’s temporal benefit, though none
knew what proposals it was making. Those
were days when Rome backed the wrong-
horse, in a political sense, as consistently as
Germany has done in the last 10 years. Leo
XIII. succeeded, to find almost every great
Government hostile. By a bold change of
policy—by putting the Church forward in
its natural role of a conservative institution
—and by his own charm and genius, lie
forced the Vatican back to something re-
sembling its old diplomatic position. But
the anomaly could not last. Democratic
France can have no sympathies, other than
spiritual ones, with unchanging Rome.
Despite Leo’s efforts, in his later years, to
come to an understanding with the French
republicans, they would have none of him.
Anti-Semitism, as evidenced in the Dreyfus
case, Anti-Nationalism, as evidenced by
the Catholic aristocracy’s refusal to
share in the government of their country—
these and. other disruptive forces were
ascribed, and rightly, to the Vatican. When
the war began Rome could hardly help
being pro-German. Practically all Austria-
Hungary and three-fifths of Germany were
Catholic, in a sense that France had not
been for 20 years or Italy for half a century.
Rome’s Teuton-inspired efforts on behalf of
peace, at a time when peace-discussions were
most embarrassing to the Allies, exasperatetf
every -patriotic Frenchman, Italian and
Britisher—fervent Romanists such as Focii
no less than Nonconformist Protestants
like Lloyd George. It is on the cards that
one outcome of the war may be the final
arid complete overthrow of the Vatican as
a diplomatic force. A certain result of that
must be to strengthen it as a spiritual factor.
The Pope as a politician has been an irritant
to the bulk of the faithful for about a
thousand years; the closer he is brought
to the old apostolic ideal of simplicity and
poverty the more tremendous will be his in-
fluence in the one sphere where the head of
a Church should wield power.
“Adolphus Bedstead” writes:—
I notice that Randolph Bedford is against the
deportation of unnaturalised aliens (B. 3/7/T9).
He says: “The war is finished and wholesale depor-
tation without trial must leave a legacy of bitter
hatred. Not one deportation should be permitted
now without open trial.”
I would like to ask Mr. Bedford this: Supposing
an uninvited guest comes to his house, and passes
unpleasant remarks -about the house-management,
and says the furniture is damn rotten, and possibly
incites the family to discord, will Mr. Bedford
guarantee not to deport him into the street except
after a trial in the law-courts? Or will he run
the risk of the stranger leaving a legacy of bitter
hatred among the pots and pans in the kitchen and
a deposit of anger and loathing in the coal-cellar
and undying animosity in the bookcase —will he
chance all that and throw Schmidt out?
'The war may be over. But the next war isn’t
over. In fact, it hasn't begun yet. And it is the
next war that counts.
A certain class of uninvited guest may possibly
hate us and our system of government-by-all-the-
people a little worse for being deported. But he
will hate us a great deal further off, and I for
one don’t mind much how venomous he may be at
Timbuctoo or how he may be filled with loathing
at Hamburg. This community is divided into two
classes —the one that believes in always giving the
alien the benefit of the doubt and the one that
believes in taking it ourselves. The first sounds
more pious and philanthropic and fetches the
applause of the Dorcas society. The second is more
practical.
The gag about the sanctity of the marriage-tie
and the preservation of the home is so seldom heard
now that I thought it was extinct. As the Hun
person has refused even to apologise for dropping
bombs on the home, it should remain extinct. Any-
how, where does it come in? Has anybody connected
with the deportation of undesirables ever used it to
Mr. Bedford’s knowledge, or is he talking generally?
And is “Jingo” the new name for the people who
have been anti-Hun and anti-Turk? It was invented
to describe the pro-Turk.

“Bouragi” : In a review of Judge Murray’s
last report on Papua The Bulletin said
that it isn’t expected that Papua’s white
population will be a very big one, for “the
brown man fills a lot of space.” The area
of Papua, excluding the islands, is about

“German trade with Britain is to be allowed with certain reservations. Trade relations between the
United States and Germany will be resumed immediately. Great activity in German ports is reported.”
90,000 square miles. The natives’ number is
only a guess, estimates running from 300,000
to 400,000. Of these by far the most are
in the Central and Western Divisions, where
there are villages of from a thousand to
two thousand people. Going east the popu-
lation thins out till in the N.E. and North-
ern Divisions there are only small villages
far apart, mostly along the coast and the
big rivers which have thousands of acres
of land behind them untouched by cultiva-
tion and unused by the natives except as
hunting grounds. In the Northern Division
alone it is possible to travel for days through
virgin and uninhabited forest land, all of it
fit to grow tropical produce. The valley of
the Mamba, with its mountain-range run-
ning up to 14,000 feet, never more than 30
miles from the river, would support a large
white population and leave ample territory
for the maintenance of the sparse native
population along its banks. Certainly there
is malaria; but malaria vanishes with the
clearing of the jungle and the drying up
of the swamps. Thirty years ago the Malay
Federated States were as hopeless a proposi-
tion for white men as Papua is supposed
to be to-day. Where once was festering
jungle and swamp are now fine roads, open
country and rich plantations supporting in
health and comfort a big white population
which could be bigger if the grip of the
great rubber corporations was not so tight.
Money and progressiveness could make
Papua fit for white men to prosper in and
would return a handsome profit. Whether
the present methods of the Papuan and
Federal Government serve to this end is
another story.
The House of Reps, is getting too finicky
altogether. It suspended Considine, of Broken
Hill, the other evening merely for calling his
brother-members murderous thieves.
Prince Henry of Prussia evidently wants
to get George of England into trouble too.
He has cabled to Buckingham Palace “beg-
ging the King to prevent the extradition of
the Kaiser.” Being a wise man the King
will probably reply that bis relative has
applied to the wrong George.
Dear Bulletin, — After listening to the
official Peace service at the Anglican Cathe-
dral at Sydney I arrive at the conclusion
that in order to be saved one must believe
in Our Sovereign Lord the King. In the
printed programme which I still retain
George appears in large capital letters even
in the middle of a paragraph, while the
Almighty has only a big initial, as though
it might be Smith.—Yours, etc., Worship-
per.
The Nationalist conference sitting in Mel-
bourne has decided to continue the machine
system of pre-selection ballots. With, the
help of “Harrison 0.,” Senator Bill Plain,
the president, will now address a few words
to the conference: —
The principles of Junta rule
We will not tolerate.
The Preferential vote, which we
Obtained, leaves each elector free
To choose the candidate
We most prefer. The commonsense
Of this plan you will note:
First we record our preference,
Your task then is to vote!
In a paragraph (19/G/T9) about "the
privileges of the profession” it was said that
a lady much referred to in cross-examination
in a Sydney case was not named in the
petition (it was a divorce matter) and
therefore could not come in and defend her-
self. The Bulletin is informed that the
lady was named in the petition at the time.
To that extent, therefore, the lawyer con-
cerned did not take advantage of any
“privileges” he might have. That he was
actuated only by a sense of duty to his
client was freely conceded at the time.
“Subaltern” (Eng.) : The one excuse for
Pearce coming to England was that military
red-tape might be done away with wherever
it impeded satisfactory demobilisation. But
from that point of view Pearce’s visit has
been a ghastly failure. Westralians are
now pulled out of their quotas and put aside
until there shall be enough of them to make
up a boatload. The same thing is done
with men of other States. There may be
a very good reason for that, but it wasn’t
obvious to the men. To them it meant
breaking up units and campaign friendships,
and reclassifying men according to States:
and that is a thing for which these Diggers
have no time any more—they are Australians;
not Victorians or Queenslanders. The West-
ralians at Codford sent a long urgent wire
of protest to Pearce. Receiving no reply a
deputation of three obtained leave to go to
London and ask the Minister for Defence to
explain the advantages (if there were any)
of this new scheme. He told them to go
back and put any statements they had to
make through the proper military channels!
A note from Parliament House, Hobart:
Dear Bulletin, — Your love and religion—-Aus-
tralia and authenticity—make you my Bible. So
oui differences sink to mediocrity. Let us settle
them within the family. One of your Tasmanian
political correspondents says my easily scoring a
record number of votes for Denison was a surprise.
Perhaps it was to him. lie overlooks causes when
he estimates effects. My lack of education—book
learning is my badge of genuineness. It stamps
me as a representative who has cbme right through
the class struggle. It also indicates an awakening
of the workers to the fact that commonscnse backed
with common honesty is preferable to miseducated
intellectualism twisted and turned. The political
world is jambed full of bunglers, of hit-and-miss
men who use their heads for everything except
thought—who confuse random ability with capacity.
Half the writers don’t realise that their visions
haven’t the value of a bandicoot skin until a
practical man takes them in hand. —Yours, J. 11.
Cleary,
“Willie Woodbine”: There has been a
great battle at Melbourne Uni. The Public
Questions Society invited Considine, M.11.R..
to deliver a lecture at the shop on “The Case
for the O.B.U.”—one of a series of short
mid-day addresses on subjects of current
public interest. But either the man or the
subject was too much for the Right Thinkers,
who organised a petition, to which they col-
lected about 140 signatures, protesting
against the fixture, Considine being a dis-
loyal person. The P.Q.S. called a general
meeting to discuss the question, and after
bursts of eloquence from some leading profs,
it was decided that Considine’s personal
character and political views were no bar
to his eligibility to expound the principles of
the 0.8. U. In fact, as one prof, remarked,
*if we wanted to hear Germany’s version
of the war, who could we get better than
the ex-Kaiser himself?” After a heated
debate, the meeting had the good sense to
endorse the action of the P.Q.S., observing
that the very next lecture on the syllabus
is “The Case Against the 0.8. U.,” by
another prominent unionist.
The mostly-imported leaders of the sea-
men’s strike when the compulsory conference
met in Melbourne put the case into very few
words. If their principal demands "were
granted as a concession to force, they were
willing to arbitrate about the rest. 'Other-
wise no business was doing. There was
every reason to believe that the Arbitration
Court would grant the demands; in fact, the
Judge went out of his way to state that he
was strongly sympathetic. But the strike
leaders, who have a Czar-like pomp of their
own to keep up, required that the com-
munity, the community’s courts and the
Government of All the People should confess
themselves licked—defeated—stamped flat, so
that the autocrats might pose as gods and
excite their slaves and dupes to new cam-
paigns. Like that old Plantagenet who made
his son appear before him on all fours,
saddled and bridled, they demanded complete
humiliation as a tribute to their greatness.
Me used to hear a good deal about “scab-
bing.” But there is a new generation of
scabs—men who are scabbing on democracy;
and they are more dangerous to the people
than the old sort.
Tudor, nominal leader of the Federal
Labor party, is thankful for peace because
attention may now be given to domestic
problems. People were finding it more
difficult to live, because of increasing prices,
“and the Government would have to take
action to deal with the matter.” But it
isn’t high prices that Frank Tudor need
worry about; it is that Australia isn’t
earning high wages to pay them with. Hun-
dreds of millions of pounds’ worth of stuff
is coming into the country, at almost fabu-
lous prices in many instances, while," as in
the case of wheat, we are getting no more
than we did before the war; and our copper,
silver and lead production has almost
stopped. If Tudor knows how Australia
can earn high wages to pay the high prices
for foreign goods in these circumstances he
ought to shout the information. Certainly
he may cut out the local profiteer; but the
local profiteer is very Small potatoes com-
pared with the foreign profiteer, over whom
Australia has no control whatever. One
sure thing is that a people can’t long get
more than it earns; and the most certain
way of getting nothing is to knock off work
and earn nothing. How long since the Par-
liamentary Labor-leaders thundered that at
disaffected workers?

REGISTRATION OF DEBENTURES
and FEDER \L INCOME TAX.
The Company would remind Holders of Deben-
tures that a Register has been established, and the
Registration of Debentures may be effected at any
time without cost.
The advantage of holding a Registered Debenture
as against an unregistered Bearer Debenture is obvi-
ous, but registration also' relieves the holder from
He liability of having a material deduction made by
the Company of Federal Income Tax from each
Interest. Coupon.
Under the Act (see Section 16, Federal Income
Tax 1915-191 S) the .Company mav be assessed for
tneome Tax on all Debentures remaining unregis-
tered. and such assessment, if made at the current
rate of tax, would amount to about 235. per £3 Coupon.
The inconvenience to which holders of Bearer
Debentures will be put if such a deduction is made
can be avoided if they change their debentures to
“Registered’ - Debentures, which may, if required, be
reconverted to “Bearer" Debentures at any time also
without charge.
This change, to he effective, should be made prior
to the Ist July. 1919, when the next interest pay-
ment falls due.
Debentures should be lodged at the Company’s Office,
Equitable Building. Melbourne, for the purposes of
Registration and endorsement, and must have
Coupons attached. ~ jj DICKENSON. Secretary.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“It was impossible for me to receive the
Irish delegates,” said President Wilson to
certain Senators, “because they so thoroughly
identified themselves with the revolutionary
movement.” Well, what did G. Washington
identify himself with?
The first vessel flying the League of
Nations flag has turned up in Sydney harbor.
Like almost every other flag, it consists of
three bands—in this case white, blue and
white. Pity the League didn’t buy up the
simple old Siamese design—a white elephant
on a red ground.
Hughes, presumably with the sanction of
his Government, has nlaced an order in
England for three vast cargo-carriers to
cost about a million. It is probably good
to get to grips with the shipping combine ;
but it is also about time Australia got to
grips with the combine which has thrown
Parliamentary government into the rubbish-
bin. That, however, will not happen until
Australian politics get out of the control of
the machines. No Parliamentary majority
in Australia dare quarrel seriously with its
Ministers: it simply has to get up and lie
hard about all the bad things they do, and
hardest about the worst things they do,
otherwise the other crowd would win its job
at the next election. The public will be fooled
and robbed until it gets elective Ministries.
Then members may not be afraid to be
honest; and when that happens Ministers
will go straight, too.
The Federal session started with a motion
of censure; but it was a mere scuffling of
ghosts in a fog, since neither party wanted
to mention the matters of real importance.
The financial mess, the huge borrowing, the
waste, the creation of highly-paid and un-
necessary jobs—these things were taboo.
Andrew Fisher provided the N. Territory
with an Excellency and suite and a b : g civil
service and all the fuss and feathers of a
young empire, and finished up as an ambas-
sador at £5OOO a year. His followers have
been doing that sort of thing or hoping to do
it ever since. So the Labor party had no
desire to be nasty. And the Government
with its Pearce and his “mission” and its
shams and its own political old age to
provided for out of the public funds,
didn’t want to rouse the sleeping dog either.
The abolition of imported and expensive
State Excellencies has been on Labor pro-
grammes for years, the idea being to replace
them with local deputy-Excellencies as in
Canada, which only imports its great vice-
regal potentate. But it was left to Vic-
toria’s Treasurer McPherson, who isn’t a
Labor man and never has been, to move in
the matter. Being in* London, he inter-
viewed Lord Milner, and asked him not to
send any more minor satraps, and Milner
was acquiescent. Now a number of people
have oidered a new freezing machine to
give McPherson a cold reception.
Beeby, who has resigned—for the third
time —from the Holman Government, is
quite hopeless as a Minister under our
present system. His idea is that, having to
share the responsibility for every act of
every Minister, he ought to have a chance
of agreeing with every act that every
Minister proposes to do; he cant under-
stand that a Minister’s job is to merely
support his colleague, right or wrong, and
make the public believe that the heavens
would have fallen if anyth.ng else had been
done. In the days of elective Ministries,
whep an administrator would be responsible
only for lus own misdeeds, Beeby might be
at home with a portfolio. But as th.ngs
are his habit of wanting to know, and of
insisting that the Premier's job is to see
that every Minister does know, is most
distress.ifg. His colleagues were delighted
to send him cruising round the world eight
months ago. They assured themselves of
eight months of comfort, anyway.
“Lord Birkenhead added that it was the King's desire to make Mr. Hughes a King's Counsel,
blit there were difficulties in the way, for though Mr. Hughes was an honorary bencher of Gray’s
Inn, he had not been called to the Bar. However, by goodwill and ingenuity a way out of the
difficulty had been found.”
GEORGE MICAWBER: “Thank Heaven, that's paid.”
There is a vast outcry on behalf of the
Hun who is deported without trial; but a
publican can have his living taken from him
in Adelaide and the goodwill of his business
destroyed by the mere nod of the head of the
local Commandant, and there isn’t a whisper
from the same crowd. Under the War Pre-
cautions law all pubs within 20 miles of
Adelaide must close when a troopship is in ;
and, presumably for breaches of that or
some other military instruction, one hotel in
the centre of the city has been ordered to
close absolutely till the last soldier is home
and dry. It may be a just punishment; but
even if it is ’t ought to be preceded by a
fair, open trial.
Accepting the assurances of his friends
that the election in caucus to the Presidency
of the Vie. Uppish House was only a for-
mality, the thing being cut and dried, Mani-
fold ordered his ruffles; but he nearly lost
the prize, Arthur Otto Sachse, Chairman of
Committees, getting very close to him in the
voting. To Manifold’s 15 Sachse polled 13.
It was one of the biggest political surprises
for years. Sachse claimed that he had 17
promises, and hinted that the honorary port-
folio relinqtrshed by Kendell had been
dangled before three members to induce
them to vote for Manifold. Sachse’s in-
s'nuations were resented by the Govern-
ment, and there was a mild scene ; n the
House of Dullness. “Contemptible” and
“German” were the worst words used.
Sachse finally withdrew his insinuations
after Robinson, Clarke, McWhae and Bail-
lieu had admonished and Adamson had (ver-
bally) spanked him.
As the Scotchbyterian character of the
Vic. Government has been fully maintained
in recent changes, Bung has given up hope
of getting an extension of trading hours.
Lawson nas boldly declared that legislation
will be introduced this session to make six
o'clock clos.ng permanent and to better regu-
late temperance bars earned on in connec-
tion with pubs. If through any boil-over in
Vic. politics a dissolution ce.rne suddenly,
there might be a prompt reversion to late
trading hours. In any case, a local option
poll is to accompany next general election,
and Bung’s organisation for that is not
nearly complete.
The next annual gathering of the National
Federation promises to prov.de entertain-
ment for all parties. The show is to be
held in September at Bendigo, in Hughes's
consti; uency, and William the Silent is to
attend and make a few dozen speeches.
Meantime, dressed in its old pants, the
Farmers’ Union will be p’ottmg beh.nd the
haystack. Whether Williams sword of
speech will prevail against the V.F.U.’s
billhook of quiet but determined action re-
mains to be seen ; and it is possible, though
not probable, that some unheard-of person
with barley in his whiskers may push even
the Bendigo seat from under its holder.
The war is over, but these are still troublous
Lmea for little Willie.
The S. Aus. Commission which has
been sitting to inquire into the Vaughan
Government’s purchase of land for a mental
hospital has recons.dei-cd the damping ver-
dict passed on Styles (one of Vaughan’s
Ministers) by Noel Webb, S.M., sitting
alone as a former Commission. Webb said
Styles had “betrayed the business of the
Government” to an agent who was making
a big profit by purchase and resale of t:h •
land. The new Commission (Blackwell and
Southwood, M’s.L.A., and Hannaford,
M.L.C.) thinks there was no “graft” but
plenty of carelessness and a leakage some-
where of inside information to the profit of
outsiders. So Styles (who has since lost
his seat in Parliament) is not much to the
good, except that the awkward word “be-
trayed” is negatived.
Liberal members held aloof from the
benches behind the Lawson Government
when the Vic. Parliament reassembled. This
freezing attitude was particularly noticeable
while the House was waiting for the Gover-
nor’s summons to attend in the “other
place.” When the Assembly resumed busi-
ness the corner was packed, with Bowser in
the nrddle of the centre seat, and only
Purnell and Wynne directly supporting the
Ministry. Three months’ supply, the first
test of confidence, was granted with almost
lightning rapidity lest something should
blow up before anybody was ready.
In N. S. Wales the Digger is being given
no encouragement to push another settler off
the land, the idea being to increase settle-
ment. But in Queensland some queer things
are being done. At Tolga (Atherton) land
is being compulsorily resumed, on the pre-
text that it is being worked by Chinese,
although in plenty of instances farms are
collared which have employed only the white
Australians who have carved them out of
the scrub. In plenty of other cases farms
which have been worked by Chinese are ex-
cluded from resumption; and in one case at
least where Chinese are employed the origi-
nal idea to resume the proper tv was aban-
doned; and there is a nasty smell about it.
“Dismal Dick” Butler, of S. Aus., is still
a Jonah. Until a month or two ago it
seemed certain that the State would have a
deficit of £150,000. Then Butler left the
Treasury; immediately things started to
improve, and the fiscal year ended (.June 80)
only £BO,OOO to the bad.
Mitchell, Premier of Westralia, knows his
difficulty. His Government will introduce
legislation living authority to fix prices; hut
the articles which the Stat( ..i effectively
control are, he adds, few owing to the heavy
consumption of imported goods. Still, he will
request tlie Chambers of Commerce and
Manufactures to warn their members
against profiteering, and to introduce ruW
which will convince delinquent menutos of
the seriousness of the offence against the
community ih its present temper.
In the four years of Ryan management
the Queensland railway deficits have -been
£508,244, £737,888, £1,028,008, and '(for the
year just closed) about £1,420,000. In the
year beforfe Ryan the receipts covered work-
ing expenses and interest on loan money, and
left a trifle of profit. At present the system
—the biggest in Australia —is paying about:
14s. 6d. p.c., which, seeing that the money
is costing about £4 p.c., leaves a yawning
gulf. There are no base, commercial
instincts about Ryan’s Government. It isn’t
“bourgeois.”
Out of compliment to Governor Stanley,
who was making his last appearance in
plumed hat and stage-hero uniform, Watt
attended the State session opening, and was
given a seat at the clerk’s table facing the
chair. As his Ex. read page after page of
what was surely the windiest “throne
speech” on record, William’s face was a
study. If his thoughts had been translated
into words they would probably have read :
“The men responsible for this guff should
be interned with nothing but statistical
tables to read, and then tried by naval court-
martial.” The full history of Vic., including
the doings of its troops at the Front, could
be told in the same space by a skilled hand.
Before Labor in Vic. allowed the red-
flagger to take a firm grip on the party’s
nose, there was usually a lengthy nomina-
tion list for the Senate selection-ballot.
This year there are only nine candidates —
Senators Steve Barker and John Barnes;
ex-Senators McKissoek and F.ndley;
Parker Maloney* ex-M.H.R.; red-flagger
Katz, of the tar-and-feathers; uproarious
Riley, of the Builders’ Laborers; Morris
Joyce, of the Richmond A.L.P. and the
Carters and Drivers; and old-stager Ted
Russell, who keeps the red flag flying at
Port Melbourne. The list has a threadbare
look.
From the Gallery :
Dr. Maloney’s supremacy In emptying the House
is seriously challenged by Pigott, of Calare. Despite
all his rhodomontade, the little doctor is frequently
interesting, but there are few occasions when Pigott
can keep a quorum in any part of the Chamber.
Pigott is never touched by these demonstrations of
disfavor, however. Playing the three-card trick
with his sheets of figures, he goes on spluttering the
narrow arguments of the narrowest type of farmer,
and makes a special pride of the fact that the cocky
holds a monopoly of his heart and tongue. He is a
little pink citizen, with a toothbrush moustache, and
a trick of temper Which has the unhappy effect of
deepening his resemblance to an infuriated terrier.
He once held a good place in a bank, but went on
the land in search Of large profits. Either luck or
industry stood by him, for his cockying is alleged
to have been vastly more successful than his political
life.
N. S. Wales Local Government Depart-
ment has thrown out a hint to the municipal
councils between Wollongong and the Shoal-
haven that they had better merge into one
shire big enough to hire a qualified engineer
to supervise the spending of main-road
grants, etc. The main-road grants to the
10 municipalities concerned totalled £3806
last year, and this, together with local rates,
wns spent without professional guidance.
Of course most of the councils snort at the
suggestion: they are quite able to manage
their own business without having an en-
gineer poking his nose into it. The trouble
is that the state of public roads concerns
more than the handful of local residents; and
if local councils won’t do the economical
act and abolish themselves, the best thing
for the Government to do is to attehd to
the main road jobs itself and levy a contri-
bution on the local body to pay for the local
people’s use of the highway.
North-Central Queensland is the only
populous part of tropical Australia or of
the tropical world where white labor has
challenged in real earnest the old-established
superstition about white labor and the
tropics. And the struggle of a gang of
traitors to make white labor fail has been
so strenuous that Queensland, with little
more than one-third of N.S.W.’s population,
now holds the strike record. The lady who
remarked that strange things were done in
the name of Liberty was a knowledgeable
person, and her death before she got off
other valuable remarks was a loss.
SOMETHING TO EAT.
[Foil TUB liUl.LBTIN.J
“Mr. AVatt announced that the Federal Government
would grant money to all States to relieve distress
during the celebrations. No one was to go hungry
while the joy-bells were resounding.”
Let no one go hungry ; the peace bells are ringing.
We triumph in honor by lar.d and by sea.
The sun of new hope on the nations is- flinging
A light of clear promise for ages to be.
And we celebrate this
In a way you can’t miss
By seeing that folk have bread, mutton and tea!
Australia is great and the breadth and the wonder
Of pasture and cornland arrest and surprise.
The war has blown past with its tumult and thunder
And the time has arrived to awake and arise.
Our plenty is such
That the poorest may touch,
If but for a moment, our buns and meat-pies.
Come out and'be glad 1 All. the world has grown
wiser.
The earth and its plenty shall none take away.
We have broken the foe and defeated the Kaiser;
And the march of our progress no despot can stay.
• So hear the bells ring
In their sway and their swing:
“Ho! children, there’s something for dinner to-day.”
And this is Australia, the land of great plenty,
Full of mutton and beef and potatoes and grain,
Where each man might eat up a dinner for twenty
Each day of the year and then do it again !
Yet the hunger is here;
And to give the folk cheer
We offer them food lest our gladness-be vain.
Come out and be glad! The peace plaudits are
ringing.
We triumphed in honor in places remote;
But the time of the triumph goes wrong iri the
singing
When hunger at home is the dominant note.
Here, we’re not paupers quite!
Get this matter put right.
It’s time that Australia should pull off its coat!

Maoriland did relatively better during the
war than Australia. Wheat, almost the
bulkiest of food cargoes, never became a
fetich in the liicketty Islands. In Australia
an idea took root that a man who used good
country to graze sheep ought at least to be
drawn and quartered. There was some
excuse for that murderous feeling, too, be-
cause among the men who did grow sheep
there was a pretty common notion that the
land must never be broken up—that nature
must do everything except shear the animals.
Maoriland never had either of these ideas
badly, and has got rid of them altogether ;
with the result that her exports consist
mainly of meat and wool, with butter and
cheese a good third and fourth. And though
towards the end of the war it Was very
difficult to find insulated space for the
perishables, nevertheless of these four prci;
ducts alone .Maoriland shipped, to the middle
of May, about £97,000,000 to the British
Government under the war control of food-
stuffs- —an amount equal to about three times
the total banking advances of the Dominion,
and roughly £97 per head of the population.
Meantime, in order to finance Maoriland’s
share in the war, the net public debt'was
increased from £91.000,000 in 1914 to
£106.000,000 as at March 31 last; and in
addition there has been a very large increase
in the paper currency. There is no Dominion
note; but this bank alone has £3.728 249 of
notes in circulation, as against £989,882 five
years previously.
In the circumstances no wonder the
B.N.Z.’s figures wear a bloated look by com-
parison with those of pre-war years. Here
they are in more detail:; —

An uncertain amount of some of these items
represents a temporary inflation. For in-
stance, there was in money at short call in
London and in apparently-temporary invest-
ments there £13,179,286, representing, no
doubt, payments made by the British Govern-
ment on produce, and shown on the other
side as deposits—money awaiting transfer
to Maoriland, where some of it will go to
other banks. Or, worse still, it may—-and
most of it probably will—be used to pay for
foreign goods, the money _ itself remaining
“abroad.” At the same time advances have
increased pretty rapidly, though not so
rapidly as in the preceding year. By now
the total is probably a bit still higher. For
the Maoriland merchant has been caught just'
as the Australian has been.' Orders sent to
America as far back as two or three years ago
for goods at sky-high prices- were filled with
remarkable, promptitude upon the signing of
the Armistice; and, while in some lines the
wholesalers have been able to get rid of even
high-priced stocks, there being little or no
prospect of a slump (woollens and cotton
goods, for instance), in others the. whole-
salers can’t shift their stocks except •at a
sacrifice. And this has meant a further call
on the banks for support. But the circum-
stances ape’ not such as to land a prudent
hank in trouble.
Circumstances couldn’t, indeed, have been
kinder to banks if they had been shareholders
and wholly dependent on the divs. for their
support. Banks might have received a bad
blow if peace had been signed promptly and
the nations, tired of war. had rushed' back
to industry and started the old trade fight
" wit’ll renewed' energy. The consequent slump
in prices would have been very awkward
for a lot of people. But social unrest,
coupled with the tremendous increase in
paper and the serious shrinkage in gold pro-
duction, has not only maintained war prices
in many lines, but has actually increased
them. How long the hysteria is going to
last this page does not know. It is some-
what odd that there should be a connection
between the jazzing 'craze and big profits in
the B.N.Z. and some others; but there is.
When the world gets normal the jazzers will
wonder how ever he (or she) tolerated the
noise of the “band” ; and the B.N.Z. won’t
find it easy to make 25 p.c. profit on its
capital after writing down investments hard
and providing for contingencies. But the
chances are that we shall not recover our
sanity all of a sudden.
Meanwhile it can at least be said that the
M.L. Government is making a fairly reason-
able attempt to lighten its heavy load of war
debt. The revenue has reached £22 per
head; and this bank alone is paying 22 p.c.
on its capital in taxation. This shows how
the latter item of expenditure has moved -
1914 .. £61,267 1917 .. £198,052
1915 .. 74,549 1918 .. 346,385
1916 .. 137,096 1919 .. 386,273
But, in spite of these good payments into
revenue, the M.L debt is by now some
shillings over £l5O per head, about one-half
of which is unproductive ; and on top of an
interest burden of over £3O fqr every family
of five there will be a pension liability of
£l5 pe.r annum —probably more. Further, it
was at one time the deliberate policy of the
Dominion to raise its loans abroad, which
adds to the difficulties of the situation. Those
difficulties can only be met by increased pro-
duction ; and fortunately M.L. rural co-
operators in particular realise that, and are
setting out to eliminate waste and use up
by-products as one means to that end.
It is hardly necessary to say that the
B.N.Z.’s position is exceptionally strong. It
holds liquid over 62 p.c. of its liabilities to
the public, exclusive of the guaranteed stock
(£529,988), which is not due till 1934 In-
cluding that stock as capital the bank has
something over £8 of the public’s money to
every £1 of its own funds; and it is therefore
quite justified in asking the Government to
permit of the calling up of the: unpaid
£3 6s. Bd. on the old 150.000 ordinary shares.
The two lots of pref. shares (together
£750,000) belong wholly to the Government.
In the dark days, before the frozen sheep
had come into its kingdom, the Government
had to rescue the bank ; and a 10 and a 15
p.c. investment is its reward.

Just: over 11 years ago this co. was hatched
in Balmain, one of Sydney’s closely-packed
western suburbs. In return for cooking the
municipality’s garbage the E.L. and P.S. was
given the right to sell electricity. The special
Act required to set the plant singing also
permitted the Corporation, to extend its
mains outside Balmain, and nowadays it
has contracts to supply a number of other
municipalities. Progress has been very
rapid. The £50,000 of paid capital of a few
years ago soon proved insufficient, and, since
the concern had not then shown what it
could do in the way of profit-earning, to
secure funds for further expansion was ex-
pensive : £50.000 of Ist debentures cost
5i p.c. and £125,000 of seconds called for
7 p.c. The latter had the right to convert
their certificates into shares, and since the
directors have been able to pay a regular 8
p.c. with ease for four years practically all
these drbenture-holders have got on to the
good thing. But there is not going to be any-
thing very fat about the investment. The City
Council enterprise is always on the door-
step; while the municipalities served by the
Corporation have the right to “take over”
on a valuation basis at certain specified
periods. Still, there is no great likelihood of
the enterprise being taken, over if the co.
behaves itself, while, in any case, the basis
of acquisition guarantees a fair deal for
shareholders.
Despite disorganisation in the factories
owing to the ’flu (many have been working
at a loss during the past few months), and
notwithstanding Government restrictions,
which rang curfew on the movies and ail
other entertainments, the co. has had a
wonderfully successful half-year. The 800-
odd new consumers helped to lift the revenue
several thousands above the figures of the
similar term of a year ago. Though ex-
penses have been bumped up all round, so
far rates to consumers have not been hoisted;
but the latest increases iu working costs may
have less pleasant consequences.
Capital is now £2q6,100 in £1 fully-paids.
Apart from the £03,600 of debentures
(£50,000 representing the 5$ p.c. issue, the
remaining £3OOO being the last of the 7 p.c.
convertibles which fell due a month after
the accounts closed) the Corporation at
Apnl o° owed only £11,276. On the other
side f0i1,430 had been put into land, build-
ings, mains and plant, while reserves for

The experience of this co. suggests that it is
more profitable to pump beer in a Little
Lon pub than cater for the more affluent.
Even in the good years when tourists were
plentiful and the sheep and wheat cockies
were doing very well, the Grand was never
able to show fat profits. Carrying the table
further back, more “nils” fill the gap where
dividends ought to be. Between 1911-1913
things were looking up slightly; then Wilhelm
torpedoed the tourist traffic and generally
made hash of the visitors’ book. After the
war got going the politicians did their bit
by scattering paper money regardless of
consequences. The more lOU’s they put
around the higher wages and prices soared ;
and meantime hotel managements have found
it increasingly difficult to raise their tariffs.
The Grand’s war record has been dismal—
revenue has barely met expenses. A couple
of years ago the directors apparently de-
cided that too much money was tied up in
unproductive pub accommodation, so portion
of the premises was converted into self-
contained fiats, and this move has helped
to save the situation somewhat. One of the
Grand’s troubles is that it is leaning heavily
on other people. Capital is £39,319, and
with reserves there are shareholders’ funds
totalling £62,104. But in premises and fur-
niture there is no less than £110,478 (book
value), and to finance that pile the co. now
depends on a mortgage of £50,000. So while
the business showed a profit of £3561 last
year, no less than £2600 was passed out in
interest. Though it is a drab concern for
shareholders, the butcher and the baker have
no cause to worry; apart from the mort-
gage (reduced from £52,000 to £50,000 since
CCOIl i nt ? dosed), the co. owes only
±2_,02, and there is nearly twice that amount
in liquid assets.

For some years past the co. has been paying
4s. p.a. In the past year just half of that
was managed. Certainly when it is possible
to have a cleaning-up things may be better
than they look in that last line. Hughes,
assisted by his friend Higgins, who got a
knighthood for his services, “solved the
metal problem”; and actually there were
daily papers and other fools that believed it.
\Vhile the trouble was not to sell metal, but
to keep some very eager buyers from getting
it, Hughes and his advisory genius managed
pretty well. They didn’t get anything like
the prices which some others got; but we
wrote the balance off against loyalty. Then
came the time when salesmanship was really
called for; and of course there was a com-
plete break-down. Hughes, as we ought to
know by this time, owns Australia. lie and
nobody else lias a right to trade in metals,
wools, meats, wheat or anything else. “Want
a few ships, Mr! Hughes?” the shipbuilder
asks, “les—yes, yes. I could do with a
few. Send me round a bunch —er, they
grow in bunches, don’t they?” “Now, what
about this wheat of mine, Mr. Lloyd
George? I’ve got—er—what shall I say?—
er—a million tons. What shall we—er—
say for it?”
Lloyd George wanted wheat —wanted it
very badly when he could get it at ss. 6d.
f.o.b. Australia, while he has to pay Uncle
Sam 9s. (id.—but lie didn’t want any cop-
per; so the unsold copper in this co.’s hands
on May 31 was 3788 tons. Of the metal
in hand and unsold at the end of the pre-
vious half-year, apparently 450 tons were
sold. None of the past half-year’s produc-
tion was sold ; and the 3788 tons on hand
are, in accordance with the co.’s practice,
taken into account at £55 per ton. As last
week’s quotation for electrolytic was £lO2
per ton, it looks as though there is a wide
margin for. additional profit here —when the
present disgraceful restrictions on sales of
all kinds are removed. True, it is highly
probable that present prices for several
metals are quite artificial, being maintained
by Governments and other holders of large
slocks. Still £55 is a long way from £lO2.
Meantime this co. has been trying to keep
the pot boiling with the gold in its blister;
hut after the term ended even that scheme
was temporarily broken down by Lie sea-
men’s strike. Premier Ryan, of Queens-
land, managed to arrange for work to be
restarted ; but the extra cost of getting the
stuff to the refinery will be considerable.
And Mt. Morgan can’t stand much more in
that way. For the past half-year working
costs ran to £345,840; and that , means £129
per ton for the half-year’s copper. To that
must be added £l2 for maintenance and exes.,
apart from income-tax. Certainly the gold is
standing to the co. Last half-year’s gold
output was worth about £BO per ton of
copper. But that it should cost over £l4O
per ton to produce copper from ore worth
well over 2 p.c. is shuddersome. It is a
bad look-out for mines of average-grade ore
which haven’t gold to help them through.
And in this case the richer gold stuff is
being heavily drawn on to tide the co. over
its difficulties. Reserves as at Dec. 1, 1918,
were worth G.lSdwt. gold. The ore taken from
reserve during the half averaged 6.90dwt.,
reducing the average grade of the balance
to 6.l3dwt. Even then a bank overdraft
and other liabilities amounting to £193.477
had been contracted by May 31, though
there still remained a surplus of more or
less liquid assets of £490,527.
As to mine and plant operations, there is
nothing to note that hasn’t already come
under the glass. Perhaps the most cheerful
feature of a generally grey landscape is the
prospect that leaching holds out. The
small plant is of course still experimental,
but it is “running smoothly and treating its
complement of ore successfully.”

Shortland Islands Plantations, Ltd.
—This is. one of the two Burns-Pliilp off-
shoots which got into the Solomons about the
same time. Choiseul Plantations, Ltd., se-
cured substantial concessions in the old Ger-
man territory; the Shortlands people took
up a couple of estates in the British Solo-
mons. ‘Choiseul is not only the larger, but
has been the more fortunate of the two
ventures. The German administration al-
lowed Choiseul to recruit natives from other
islands, and there has been little trouble in
maintaining its labor team. At the Short-
lands the labor supply has always been a
problem; at one stage there were only 30
natives at the roll-call. British authority did
not countenance recruiting in other islands,
and when the Hun was pushed out of the
Pacific the new administration would not per-
mit the co. to rope in Black Brother even
from adjoining Bougainville. At the end of
1917 the native force numbered 195;
a year later 137; and when the present
accounts closed on January 31 last only
<9. This number was barely sufficient
to tend the planted area, and further de-
velopment work had to stop. However, the
position has since eased with the capture of
fid more recruits. So, as the directors put
it, there have been “wearisome delavs in
achieving the co.’s object.” Of the‘total
area of 19,-93 acres, only 1345 acres have
been planted (72.852 cocoanuts and
rubber trees). Last year 127| tons of
copra were obtained, and 200 tons are an-
ticipated for the current term. Capital is
™ 500 shares of £lOO each, and of the
£33.012 so far called up £32.421 has
been outlayed on land and development. A
lot of money has yet to go in clearing further
ground, and the end of shareholders’ “weari-
some wait” is not in sight.

The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.E. Mercury Arc Battery
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the eflieiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should

For grinding all (lasses of material in Ball Mills
and Tube Mills it is necessary to have a suitable

also numerous cement plants, are using balls of forged
tyre steel, and find that they give excellent results.
These balls may be obtained in various sizes from
the Austral Otis Engineering Co. of Melbourne, who
have put in a special plant for forging them, and
can give delivery of most sizes from stock. This

CORRESPONDENCE INVITED.
Hooper, the new man at Butler’s Tin, is
niKung out, that Torrmgton is a dry patch
ot A. S. Wales. Lonsdale Smith and J. B.
Lewis each had certified to that, and prayed
that a waterspout would fill the three dams
lacy built. But when rain did come the
supply of water lasted only from February
to hi ay. So Hooper wants to reach out to
tile Highland Home Creek for a permanent
supply. That collected, he is satisfied But-
ler’s is a mine which can be worked on a
wtg scale. This also preached J. B. Lewis.
While water was there Hooper scraped 1300
tons ore from Nos. 1 and 2 levels, which
gave him 15J tons concentrates, the ore
averaging 1.25 p.c. of something not stated.
It may be tin ; it may be wolfram. What-
evei-- it is, Hooper reckons he will do better
now', because with the faces squared to the
lode he will be able to deal with a run-of-
the-mine output. Whether he floats higher
or not, that job won’t be half as hard as
securing the £4OOO necessary, to get the
water scheme going, for holders are very
tired. The co. owes its banker £2037, sun-
dry creditors £1607, and there is a balance
of £2300 due to the vendors. Of course
some stores are in hand, and there is the
tons of the tin-wolfram concentrates;
but who knows the value of that delectable
mixture?
* * * *
White Crystal. Ardlethan (N.S.W.), has
a nominal capital of £75,000 in 150.000
shares of 10s. each. The eouipment is a
10-head battery. A movement in the share
market followed a run of calls, the money
being used to open up a deposit of low-grade
tin ore by tunnelling and crosscutting. As
a result of this work some good faces have
been exposed. How much payable ore there
is has. of course, yet to be proved, but the
stopes are showing fairly well and the little
battery is kept running three shifts. Share-
holders should not be dismayed by an out-
put of only 28 tons concentrates, worth
£3616 for a year. The mill has been run
but intermittently, and should now be able
to show better results.
# * * •
This at least can be said for the people
who lately put the Big Bygoo and other
Ardlethan shows into a co. —they took up
all but three or four hundred of the shares
themselves, merely swapping one lot of scrip
(if the old syndicate had any scrip) for
another. The cash amounts mentioned in
the prospectus were transferred from one
pocket to the other; and for the most part,
if not wholly, represented payments made
for the leases, nlant and dams. The darn
for the new mill has been completed ; all it
now wants is water. A heavy drought still
hangs over the district.

A growl from “Kimo”: —
Why the gibes at Gundagai mining shows, par-
ticularly the Big Reef (B. 3/7/’l9) ? This show
will stand any impartial investigation. There is
a shoot of ore 500 ft. long, and a general average
for widths up to 12ft. is 16dwt. per ton—sdwt.
from battery and the balance in concentrates
(arsenical pyrites). These are recovery results
from trial lots sent to a local battery. A few shots
at the bottom of a shaft disclosed 3oz. ore. Isn’t
that good enough to justify Tiie Bulletin in
giving us the helping word? The Long Tunnel
people are making an honest effort to develop their
mine on sound lines, such as prospects warrant.
The industry here ought to be an extensive and
prosperous one. It has been kept back only by the
want of capital.
On which, the Wild Cat remarks: —
Unconsciously “Kimo” seems to support all The
Bulletin statements. The explanation of why Big
Reef has remained so long umvorked must 'be the
fact that of the 16dwt. value, 11-16ths is in
arsenical pyrites. Where does “Kimo” assume that
these concentrates are to be treated ? Cockle Creek
will not look at them, though Bendigo arsenical
men may make an offer. How much is likely to be
left after defraying bagging, cartage, railage,
(double handling), treatment and other charges?
And the industry is languishing because it has not
had capital to help it along! What about the tens
of thousands of pounds spent by the Howell syndi-
cates at Mount Kimo, Prince of Wales and other
places, and by the London-Mclbourne Co. at Booth’s
Reward? As to Long Tunnel, “Kimo” is right
as to want of capital—that is admitted. But, as
Tiie Bulletin said, it is ridiculous to assume that
a tin-pot cyanide plant will relieve the financial
stress, especially with present eyaniding costs.
* * * *
The Bulletin long ago said that Edna
May pumps were the controlling factor in
connection with Westonia’s problem. Warden
Walter, in giving judgment recently in favor
of Edna May and against Consolidated for
£4750 and costs (equal to about £6000) as
compensation for mine drainage as to March
31, and in ordering the defendant co. to pay
Edna May £lOO per month as drainage dues
from that date, supported that view. As to
the future, Edna May, though in the ordinary
course of events it will exhaust its ore re-
serves during the current year, appears to
hold a strong hand. It is a pity someone
will not state what Central Deeps and Con-
solidated intend doing after the parent co.’s
pumps cease operating, on the exhaustion of
its ore reserves. It is not denied that there
is a quantity of fair-grade ore in the proper-
ties adjacent to Edna iUay. but during rive
years they have not figured high on the divi-
dend list. In view of the fact that Centrals
have seen 1205., Deeps 455. and Consoli-
datods on the market, it would, in fact,
be a shame to say what the three have paid
to shareholders. If the cos. do so poorly
with the assistance they unquestionably re-
ceive from Edna May pumps, what may be
expected of them should these pumps be
thrown out of commission? And JaUna May
is preparing to put up the shutters. To-
wards Christmas time the water will be
permitted to rise, and if the other cos.
haven’t decided on a policy there will be an
unholy scramble.
Edna Central has exposed the various
Consolidated lodes at 321 ft. level in Cen-
tral ground. These bodies were not great
dividend-makers for the Consolidated, but
Central will handle them as well as anyone.
During the past two years all has been right
with Central but one thing: the gold con-
tent has weighed in light; but the co. has
done very well with such ore as has been
at its disposal. An increase of £-dwt. would
mean much to the co.
Nine months ago Shaw, who was ap-
pointed manager of the Deens, turned out an
optimistic report and a most encouraging
list of assays, the result of a lot of sampling.
This looked a rood start; nevertheless
Stuckey was induced to come in once more as
manager, although he had told shareholders
last year that he wouldn’t take the job on
again. But what has become of Shaw’s high
values? They have certainly not been sup-
ported by monthly outputs. When Stuckey
addressed shareholders last year he said:
“My view at present is that we have a mine
with ore reserves valued at £151.000 above
the No. 5 level. This should yield, and will
yield under reasonable management,
£BO.OOO to £lOO,OOO in dividends.” As the
workings are down to No. 0, shareholders
are beginning to ask for the address of
those dividends.

Sons of Gwalia’s accounts for 1918 show
a net profit of £12.720, but all but £7l of
this is mopped up by English and Australian
income taxes. The year’s revenue amounted
to £190,092, and working costs were 21s.
per ton, compared with 19s. Id. for 1917.
Ore reserves are estimated to be equal to
about three years’ supply for the mill.

The Kanowna, at Kanowna, fufnishes
another Westralian instance of a rich find
made in an old, abandoned mine. In the
last six months the owners have dug out
£12,000 worth of gold, and are busy getting
more. Reports of weighty crushings are
also to hand from old ground on the adjoin-
ing Broad Arrow field; but Bulong, which
lies on the other side of Kanowna, and
which produced a lot of gold in the ’nineties,
is doing nothing,

In order to satisfy itself and silence
critics Golden Butterfly (W.A.) recently
commissioned De Jersey Grut to report on
its Banker option at Burbridge. near
Southern Cross. Grut doesn’t consider the
prospects which attracted the co. amount to
much, but recommends sinking to see if
there is anything better at depth. The show
was turned down some time ago by the
Bullfinch,, and is in a locality where de-
lusions abound.

Mines and plant of the Thermo Electric
Co. at Chillagoe (N.Q.) are to be taken
over by the Burma Queensland Corpora-
tion —a British concern with a share capital
of £OOO.OOO. formed to operate wolfram
mines at Tavoy .(Burma) and at Wolfram
Camp and Mt. Carbine (N.Q.). The pur-
chase of these properties will be covered in
part by an issue of debentures carrying 7-J
p.c. The National Metal and Chemical
Bank (London) has recently been offering
£225.000 worth of this paper. The pro-
moters are remarkably optimistic about the
future price of rare metals, and estimate a
profit of £102.000 a year from their pro-
perties. Enormous issues of paid-up shares
and debentures are becoming characteristic
of London’s dizzy-day finance.

“Mulga”: After 3£ years Queensland
Mines Department has 'closed the State
coal-mine at Warra with £45.000 on the
wrong s : de of the ledger. Certainly a good
deal of this is represented by elaborate plant
and buildings on top. The mine was pur-
chased from Private Enterprise on the
quality of a 3ft. seam that was being worked
at 200 ft.. and also on the quality of a sft.
seam that boring had revealed at 500 ft. The
reports were more than confirmed later on
by the Government’s own boring plant. On
the advice of Government experts the old
w r orkings were closed, and sinking com-
menced half a mile away, alongside the rad-
wav line, the intention being to go to the
500 ft. seam. At 310 ft. sinking was sus-
pended owing to the pumps being unable to
cope with the water. Work was then com-
menced on the seam at 200 ft.; but whereas
in the old workings it was 3ft. thick, here it
was only 2ft. For various reasons this
seam was never payable, and it was given
out that it was only being worked until the
sOoft. seam was struck. A few weeks back
elaborate preparations were completed on
top for the handling of the coal from the
500 ft. seam. Electrical pumps and appli-
ances for dealing with the water were in-
stalled, and then, to the surprise of every-
one, operations were abandoned. The reason
given for not sinking to the 500 ft. seam is
that the quality of the coal does not justify it.
If such is the case, it is up to the Govern-
ment to explain why it has taken three
years to find this out, especially as no bor-
ing has been done meantime. As the matter
stands there is a nasty aroma about the pur-
chase, working and closing of the mine.

Lindesay Clark’s report on Briseis for
1918 is out. The London Board’s screed
follows later; but Clark lifts the curtain
sudiciently to show that the co. did well,
thanks to an average price of £320 per ton
received for metallic tin. Result, a working
profit of £16,050 from the sale of 284| tons
metal got from sluicing 546,950 cubic yards,
against £28,966 made in 1917 from 241 tons
won from 512.300 yards. Two divs. took
£30,000, and depreciation, income-taxes and
minor, charges chewed up the rest. The
cash _in hand at the end of the year was
£14,678 —about £lO 000 better than it was
when the year began. Clark is still at work
switching the Ringarooma River into a new
bed, and he won’t pledge himself to get on
to good yields untd' the winter rains let
him sluice out the new inlet. Nor is he
out to wash off more Ringarooma over-
burden yet awhile, and his plans for 1919
don’t include the tapping of the richer Ring-
arooma drifts. So whether these will come
up to the boring has still to be demon-
strated.

A little nest of wasps is attacking the
Nuggety Ajax Board. The convening of a
special meeting didn’t, however, bring the
directors on the carpet. Hot air was blown
off safely, and a new Board and legal mana-
ger were selected by those present. But
they mav not represent the majority of the
shares—probably don’t. Even though the
meeting was convened with legal formality,
books, documents, the co.’s seal and its
titles have to get into the possession of the
newcomers to vest them with authority. In
any case, Nuggety is a gutted mine.

The time-machine, as far as the Maori-
land railways are concerned, was put back
many years on July 2, when a curtailed
passenger and goods service was begun, with
the object of saving coal. Strikes in Aus-
tralia have practically cut off supplies from
Newcastle, and the Maoriland mines are
hewing less and less. The run between
Wellington and Auckland, for instance,
usually covered in 18 hours, now takes
three days. On the day the railways cut
all fast trains the Miners’ Federation
pressed for a new agreement with the Mine
Owners’ Association. It wants a change
from contract work to wages, at the rate
of £1 a day for miners and 17s. 6d. for
truckers and others, a seven-hour day bank
to bank immediately, and a six-hour day in
January, 1921. with a five-day week. Also
it wants holidays pa : d for and free light,
coal and tools. At least, it says it wants
these things;, what it really wants is State
control, the idea being that since the capi-
talist would not open up new coalfields
when he had the chance, he shouldn’t be
allowed the chance now when the state of
the market makes him want to. From all
of which it can be concluded that much the
same sort of bee is buzzing in the head of
the M.L. miner as in that of his Go-Slow
brother of Australia.

Philippine Dredges, floated a.d. 1912. was
chookful of promised dividends. Had not
one engineer estimated the Paracale options
to conceal £1,637,770 of profits; and did
not an Aussie expert give the show a tip-
top blessing? Since the co. was shoved off
to work Is. 2d. ground at a cost of 24d. it
has produced these results:—
Profits. Divs.
1915 £2,275 ..
1916 22,511 ..
1917 24,338 .. £8730
1918 4,184 .. 8730
The co. has issued £174.600 of capital, while
its pup, the Paracale Bucket Dredging Co.,
has floated off 150.000 shares of £1 each.
If the 1916-17 tallies had kept going things
would be in a state of bliss; but the
“highly remunerative” epoch ended suddenly
in 1918. Fuel* shortage and tropical storms
started troubles in 1917. but the real smash
•ame later, when the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment forbade the export of steel. This
cut off the supply of spares, and the buckets
and bands were worn down pretty well be-
fore word went over the cable to stop on
all plants save No. 2, The little brown
brother threatened to go off to plantation
work if he didn’t get higher wages, and
when persuaded to stay had a bad run of
the ’flu. These ills make up a bothering
uut Liiey would not matter so much
if there was assurance that the rest of the
£1,600,000 profits were still waiting to be
bucketed up. After reading manager Tel-
ford's last report, however, ttie average man
concludes that either the official was down
in the dumps or the show has to be
labelled as far below expectation. These
are his sad refrains: “future chances de-
pend a good deal on prices,” and, “Peace
having been declared, prices of materials,
freights, etc., should drop. If not we can-
not expect to get far ahead.” To follow
that up by saying that, with “lowered rates
and more facilities for securing renewals,
etc., we still have good chances,” is poor
comfort. Surely it is time for secretary
Showers to flit off to Manila again. He
straightened opt things once before, and
may find the silver lining if there is one.

K.C.: Killed Conscription.
Billy Hughes, K.C.. is not the first Eng-
lish Silk to be at the Bar in Australia.
Many years ago Sergeant Sleigh, Q.C., of
the English Bar. was admitted to practice
in Victoria and N. S. Wales. But the
attorneys did not seem to take to him, and
he returned to London.
BRIGADIER-GENERAL J. IF. McGAY,
who had an experience or two at the Front.
George Georgeson, the man who bought
the 70,000 tons of N. S. Wales 1916-17
explosive wheat which has blown up the
Government, came to Australia as sales-
manager for the Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration in the days when that concern was
wasting a million or two. As part of his
job he had to do some lobbying in the
Federal Parliament, and that made him
acquainted with many politicians. They
afterwards consulted him on various busi-
ness matters; and when Hughes formed his
abortive metal exchanges Georgeson was pul
in charge of the one in Sydney. Things
didn’t, however, proceed to his liking, so
he retired, and has since been handling
various business propositions in Sydney.
“Fax” : Melbourne notices of Father
Robinson’s death made no mention of his
having been a convert from Protestantism,
but Archbishop Mannix casually alluded to
it at the funeral. When he came to Aus-
tralia 30 years ago it was said that Robin-
son had ’verted because he was an ambitious
young man who loved the limelight, and saw
greater scope for his talent in the R.C.
Church than in the others. It is fairer to
suppose that, having the religious tendency
and the artistic temperament, he naturally
turned to the more picturesque ritual. He
was a showman at heart, but an excellent
priest all the time. His activities were
checked many years ago by a stroke of
paralysis, which somewhat marred his hand-
some countenance. Presumably it left ill
effects, too, for he was only 54 when they
buried him in the beautiful church he had
built at Camberwell.
“K.”: The allegation of “Gleniris” (B.
10/7/T9) that there are more than two or
three amply-qualified medical men in the
Army as capable as Gilruth to look for beef
nodules at £1750 a year, and that therefore
the appointment of the latter by Watt is
wrong, lacks only one thing—the names of
the persons he is talking about. The in-
vestigation of parasitic diseases in stock is a
branch of science
which medical
men have nothing
to do with. It
is Gilruth’s job.
He was trained
for it. As an
administrator of
the Territory he
may have been
anything you like.
But Gilruth as a
veterinarian and
a bacteriologist
measures 12
inches to the
foot. What he
did in Maoriland
in connection with
“bush sickness”
an d “blackleg”
and contagious
mammitis had a
value that could
scarcely be ex-
pressed in terms
of cash.

A fine old citizen was Charles Dashwood,
just dead at 75, at Dashwdbd’s Gully, near
Adelaide. He went back to the beginnings
of South Aus.; his father, retired Naval
Commander, nominee member of the first
Leg. Council of the province, and P.M.,
settled at the Gully, and Charles was born
there in 1843. He was one of the very
earliest St. Peter’s boys, and after a
University coui-se in Belgium found law
attract him more than land. Pupil and then
partner of Judge Bundey. he was a member
of S.A. Assembly from 1887 to 1892, and
then was made Resident and Judge of the
Northern Territory. He held that job for
13 years, a record not likely to be ap-
proached again. When he got back to
Adelaide he still had 10 years left of public
service as Crown Solicitor. After which he
retired to the family estate, and married —
for the first time —at 73.
Robert Bell, one of the best-known and
most capable men in the .Australian coastal
shipping trade, who died at Sydney recently,
was a Maorilander. He hailed from Green
Island, and, away in the long-ago, went up
to the Union Co.’s office in Dunedin as an
office boy. Later he was passenger agent in
Sydney for the ’Frisco service when the
Monowai and Mararoa were on the Pacific
run, and dropped that job to become assist-
ant to manager Jackson. Twenty years ago
John See beckoned him to the North Coast
Shipping Co. For half of the time he had
been managing director. He was 58 when
he heard the knock-off whistle —he had been
listening for it ever since the doctors said
cancer a year ago.
Robert Harper, chief partner in the
grocery firm which he founded with his
brother, left £170,000., It was solely an
importing business in the beginning, but of
later years the Harpers manufactured so
many things that 20 unions were repre-
sented at their factories. The deceased
Robert had been a great worker in his
time, putting a lot of good brains into the
concern, and if he had been in rags he
would probably have left a million. The
trade that is always clearing out goods at
far below y cost is the one where the money
is.
“Personnel” about the managers of the
Soldiers’ Homes scheme :
Colonel Walker, the chief commissioner, may have
been a bricklayer—l hope he was —but he has been
his own boss since he came to Queensland in 1882.
He has .been building and contracting, and was
doing big jobs for the Government up to the be-
ginning of the war. He had a commission in the
Queensland Infantry as far back as 1897, he fought
with the Queenslanders in S’Africa, and he com-
manded a battalion, in the late war. Toll, the
manager of the scheme in N. S. Wales, knows the
timber business from A to Z. He was a major as
far back as the Boer trouble, and in the late war
scored a D.S.O. and bar. On the business side he
started at the beginning—at the bench —but for six
years before the war (after a lot of contracting in
between) he was maryiger for the Mt. Molloy Tim-
ber Co. There is a very proper demand that all
available billets in the Government's gift should
go to returned soldiers if any are suitable; and the
Government had exceptional luck in finding men
who had not only proved themselves as commanders
but also as successful men not.only in the building
business but also in handling building materials.
In the Vic. Cabinet there are now four
lawyers—Lawson, Robinson, Baird (solici-
tors), and Mackinnon (barrister). There
are seven of the Devil’s Brigade in the
Assembly, and Snowball and Bayles are the
only two who have not had an innings in a
Government, though both have been triers.
Mackey (Speaker) is one of the seven who
has had a pretty good share of the Parlia-
mentary pickings. The four best jobs avail-
able to M’s.P. are held by lawyers—Premier
(Lawson), leader of the Leg. Council
(Robinson). Speaker (Mackey), and Presi-
dent (Manifold). No wonder Labor-member
Slater (Dundas) is following Up his legal
studies to get fully fledged.
Watt, who reluctantly moved the motion
for the suspension of Mahony and Considine
in ■ the House of Reps, recently, narrowly
missed suspension himself. 12 years ago in
the Vic. Assembly, when, he was a free-lance
sitting in the Ministerial corner. Solly, who
seemed to be stonewalling a bill his own
party favored, was aaked-hr.. Wiitt,. “Whafe
the little "garn-e?” Solly flared up and com-
plained. Craven (Chairman of Committees),
who was presiding, insisted upon withdrawal.
Watt refused. Bent, as Premier, was called
upon to move Watt’s suspension, but
paralysed the House by saying, “No, I
won’t.” Members waited breathlessly for an
earthquake or something. Then Watt rose
and voluntarily withdrew his remark.
Crossed over, at a big age, Donald Reid,
of Dunedin (M.L.). A woolbroker and
owner of wool stores, he was on the job
until near the end, and helped pile the last
notes on a fortune of £70,000. His brother
Charles, who died in 1897, was founder and
first general manager of the Standard In-
surance Co. They were among the earliest
settlers in Otago.
Wilfred Law Docker, dead in Sydney at
73, was the fifth son of Dr. Joseph Docker,
an old-time M.L.C., and was born near
Scone. He was one of eight sons. Wilfred,
leaving school, got a billet in the Oriental
Bank; and when that wobbly institution
finally fell he was appointed local liquidator.
The obituary notices mention two brothers
as still living—the ex-Judge and Edward
Hay Docker. There is another, now. or
until very recently, living in England,
Arthur Robert Docker, well known as a
member of the Albert Cricket Club many
years ago.
Hugo Wertheim, who has died in Mel-
bourne, was sufficiently German, in spite of
his 47 years in Australia, to be practically
killed by the war, like many other old Ger-
man residents of this country. He was in
Berlin at the time the war broke out, or
just previously, and did not return to Mel-
bourne with his family until a little of the
truth about Hun treachery, conspiracy and
widespread intrigue had begun to leak out.
Consequently Wertheim found some of his
friends and acquaintances interned, ' and
almost from the day of his landing he
looked a sick man, and the longer the horror
lasted the more he seemed to shrink. His
son served as an interpreter on Monash’s
staff, and carried through the interrogation
of thousands of prisoners.
The other Australian Agents-General in
London will be glad that Peter Mcßride is
to remain at the Yic. office for six months
beyond August. If there is any joint enter-
taining to be done Peter is always given the
job of seeing it through.
Mrs. Atherton, who shot herself in London
last week, had a queer career and came of a
queer family. Her father was Sir Edward
Dean-Pane, the banking baronet who served
a long sentence for fraud. When she mar-
ried Colonel Atherton, of the 12th Lancers,
about a quarter of a century ago, she was
one of the prettiest women in England.
During the S’African War her husband began
divorce proceedings, naming seven co.-res.
one of them a duke, and all of them intimate
friends of Edward VII. Edward used his
influence to quash the case. Some years
later the Colonel unearthed a new co-re. —
the heir to one of the wealthiest peerages in
the U.K.—and got his divorce. The young
man declined to do what is usually con-
sidered the right thing in such affairs, and
hurriedly married a musical-comedy actress.
Much upset, the other lady went to Cairo and
had a sensational row with a hotel manage-
ment there: for years she specialised in rows
with hotels. Six weeks ago she married
Captain Eliot —part-author of “The Better
’Ole” —and younger brother of the wealthy
young Earl of St. Germans. He immedi-
ately quarrelled with her, and that was her
finish.
THE END.
JILL: “And so they are going to try the
Kaiser! I wonder what his sentence
will be!"
JACK: “Dun no —but it ought to finish with
a full stop."
Long Jack Pennington, member for Kara
Kara, succeeds Andy Robertson as Vic.
Government Whip—a job for which £3OO a
year is paid out of Ministers’ stipends. II
will be no irksome task for Pennington to
take soundings. He revels in that sort of
thing.
Daniel Batman Sellars, dead at Maffra
(Vic,), had his middle name from the
pioneering Batman, his grandfather, who
helped with the early settlement of Mel-
bourne. Sellars, who was a civil engineer,
belonged to a family for long identified with
the ancient Heidelberg district, the still
beautiful region in which- so many of Mel-
bourne’s oldest inhabitants staked out then-
home allotments.
“Subaltern”: No paper in Australia, ex-
cept The , has done justice to Miss
Bout, formerly of Maoriland, who has been
one of the greatest friends the Digger (an#
incidentally the Digger’s country) has ha#
in France, and particularly in Paris. Not
long ago the boys at the Corps Educational
School at Rue (near.Abbeville) decided to
make her a presentation, and consulted her
as to what she would like. All she asked
for (and remember she’s the woman who
has even pawned her insurance policies to
get money for her work) was an Australian
flag. But 3(JO Diggers are going to give her
more than a flag. If there’s a Billjim who
ever forgets her kindness I’d like lii’s photo-
graph.
A vacant trusteeship of the State Bank
of S.A. has been filled by Col. George Dean.
He is an upright and active man of just
60, who has divided all his life between
soldiering and his stock and station agency.
His first chance of active warfare was on
Gallipoli, where he nearly died of fever; for
the rest of the war he was in charge of trans-
ports, while his five sons and only son-in-
law all did big work, all earning commis-
sions, and one becoming colonel of artillery.
But it was his knowledge of land-values
which gave him the State Bank appoint-
ment. The chief work of that institution
these times is financing returned soldiers
who want homes.
W. Walter Watts, Presbyterian minister
at Wycheproof (Vic.), who has been made
a Fellow of the Linnsean Society, knows as
much about ferns and mosses as any man
alive, though he does not find many of them
around Wycheproof. Pie used to fix the
pedigrees of both for the Sydney Herbarium,
and lately he and 11. N. Dixon. F.L.S., an
English bryologist, have been writing mono-
graphs on the Antarctic mosses which Maw-
son brought back. Plis colleague in this job
was to have been Cardot, the F’rench autho-
rity ; but. Cardot lived too near the border,
and all his collections and material fell into
the hands of the Huns.
VIRTUE, GENTILITY, INTELLECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I was gazing down upon 250 earnest men and
women, all keenly alert, each with ideas firmly
fixed, and while eagerly waiting a chance to present
them to his or her co-delegates, carefully noting
the points of weakness in the argument advanced by
others. Yes, with motions of censure galore,
criticisms keen, discussions by the dozen, and tire
atmosphere electric; but with it all, the one common
desire —how best to improve the industrial, social
and moral conditions of their fellows. No doubt
the contrast is great.”— -N.S. W. Labor-leader Storey,
apropos the degeneracy of his opponents.
I am a modest personage;
And yet I take myself aside
From time to time, and boil with rage,
And also swell with honest pride,
As I compare my little band
With some in this disgraceful land.
Take manners. There are parties here,
As all will readily allow,
Whose members, wild with hate and beer,
Kmploy such terms as “scab” arid' “cow”
And other words the gentle shun.
With us, these things are never done.
Wire we assemble to discuss
The conduct of a worthless world, ;
No adjectives discourteous ' . '
Are by the persons present hurled.
The hall is saintly, calm and cool
As some fair sylvan Sunday-school;
The intellect displayed is—well,
1 hardly care to state the truth.
One naturally hates to tell
About such things; and yet in sooth
The Party’s brain and mental grasp
Have often made me fairly gasp,
For hours the verbal give and take
Proceeds while all, like perfect gents.,
Cry “Pardon!” “Granted!” “My mistake!”
..“Carried with no dissentients!”
And thereby raise their fellowman
As good example only can.
Our foes are the antipodes
Of this: from moral codes exempt,
Their brains are minus quantities,
Their social ways beneath contempt.
Thank God that we were never thus
Arid that, they cannot be like us!

IN THESE SERIOUS EPIDEMIC DAYS
Get CLEMENTS TONIC for your Blood
Pure Blood means less risk of infection and greater powers of resistance to epidemic attacks.
The purer the blood the stronger the body. Epidemic disease thrives on the debilitated system.
These are anxious days for Australia, when it behoves all persons to take every care of themselves and ward off to their greatest
effort the menace to health that threatens them. No one can afford to take any undue risk, and the person who has the best condi-
tion of health and the greatest powers of resistance to any invading force, whether it is epidemic disease, privation, oppressive
climatic conditions, worries, or minor illness, is best fortified against it. It is the old story in a new way of the soldier well armed;
he is shielded from attack of destructive and destroying forces.
Clements Tonic, which, for a quarter of a century, has beenadmitted a medicine of rare health value in keeping the nerves sound
and the blood cool and pure, should now be used as a means to fortify the body and the general health. It tones up the stomach <*«
well, has a palliative effect On the bowels, stimulates the liver and kidneys, and imparts a healthy influence Clements Tonic i 3
largely a blood and nerve medicine, and should be a part of the medical equipment of every home at the present time.

Peacock’s tact has been praised by Holman
on the strength of what he observed at the
conference of “National” associations in
Melbourne. But on that point one might
also consult, say, Ilagelthorn. The latter
went with Peacock and McCutcheon to
represent the Watt-Murray team at a
similar conference six years ago. A lady
described a suggestion made by McCutcheon
as “What nonsense!” whereupon Peacock,
who was chairman, bridled up and admon-
ished the lady for talking in that way to
“a member of the Government and a cour-
teous gentleman.” “Oh, indegd!” muttered
the lady. Peacock was slow at interpreting
the press on his pet corn given by John
West, and there was nothing for it but to
pointedly introduce him to the lady. She
was Mrs. McCutcheon.
“Hamer”: The man who
abjectly at his musketry tests
in Blighty was put back in his
training for further instruc-
tion ; and this was an oppor-
tunity for the lead-swinger.
But the man who had made up
his mind to miss- d.d not
always have it his own way.
There was the ease of Bingley.
Once, when I was marking, the
officer in charge, the sergeant
and two more of us decided
that Bingley, who boasted that
he had failed twice already,
was ripe for France. When
we learnt the target he was
firing on the rest was easy.
His bullets, when they were
sighted at all, raised only dust;
but as far as the scoring went,
Bingley registered bulls’-eyes
with astonishing regularity. ‘‘l
don’t know how the hell I did
it,” he confided to a hut mate.
“First of all, I was aiming al
the next target, and when I
found that was no good I tried
the target two places away.”
He went to France, but, of
course, being a lead-swinger,
he achieved a lead-swinger’s job there, too.
The making of W. M. Hughes a King’s
Counsel of England was a hurried proceed-
ing. It was probably the only case except
in “lolanthe” when the Lord Chancellor
got a move on. But George V. issued his
command, and, even if the great embodiment
of the law fell over the tail of his robe
in his haste and broke a neck that is worth
£lO,OOO a year, it had to be done. Hughes,
not being a member of the English Bar,
had to be put through all stages of his
career at once. He was first garbed as
a student and studied the law earnestly for
two minutes. He was then admitted as a
plain _ barrister and practised in that
capacity for five minutes, conducting
imaginary cases and staggering the Bench
that wasn’t there by his brilliant cross-
examination of the atmosphere. After that
he was made a K.G. for long service, and
walked in silk attire to interview the great
brass-hats of the profession. The Chan-
cellor was apparently rather grumpy about
it and explained that the matter was un-
precedented and had been done with
struggle and difficulty. He also said it had
invomd much ingenuity, and seemed to
hint that there had been a great deal of
brain-fag for very little. He didn’t add that
lie r would chuck his job if this sort of thing
became a habit, but he probably looked like
that.

“Aaron-go-bragh”: The man who arranged
the service at the Melbourne Synagogue on
the afternoon of Peace Sunday is a brilliant
satirist. One of the anthems was “This Is
the Day.”

The two Townsville strike leaders who
were arrested on a charge of riot —it was
-the attempt to release one of them which led
to an unfortunate shooting episode—were
promptly acquitted. Stacks and stacks of
evidence was forthcoming to prove that they
were present on the tumultuous occasion
purely as a restraining influence, and their
voices were so worn out with shouting coun-
sels of moderation that they had to cancel
all singing engagements. Probably if every-
body else had been arrested the result would
have been much the same: it would have
been shown that the real damage was done
by a small boy whose fury the other 1999
people present tried vainly to ameliorate.
The new theory is that the heads of the
movement are always pushed aside and the
rank and file take charge; and as the rank
and file is hard to identify after dark, ap-
parently nothing can ever be done. It is an
even moi*e difficult problem than that of the
Kaiser, for in his case almost evex-ybody
seems willing to be responsible except the old
man himself. There is haidly a kid in the
Imperial family who isn’t ready to swear
that he made the war single-handed.
“Lex”: Justice Gordon, of N. S. Wales,
dismissed the costly Hopkins divorce peti-
tion last week. It was inevitable on the
evidence, which was practically all provided
by private detectives—-people who lie so
freely in the ordinary way of. business that
they are not believed without corrobora-
tion when they happen to tell the truth.
In any event, the petitioner’s case rested on
identificat : on. and identification in the dark
at that. Modern courts are very chary about
such evidence. In the classic Adolf Beck
case the accused, who was charged with de-
frauding women in a wholesale fashion, was
unhesitatingly picked out of a mob of 14 men
by 15 of his alleged victims. After he had
done seven years the real culprit was nailed
in the person of one Thomas, who bore but
the most .superficial l-esemblance to Beck.
The drove of detectives employed by Rawdon
NO WISH TO GIVE TROUBLE.
“By the way, Maty, I forgot to tell you that
we have breakfast at 8 o'clock sharp."
“All right, mum, if I ain't down don't wait."
Hopkins may have honestly imagined that
the lady they saw with the co-re. was the
one in the suit, and yet have been wrong.
The Judge would probably not have chanced
the matter had they been archdeacons.
“Zillebeke”: General White overdid it
when, commenting on C. E. W. Bean’s un-
doubted courage, he said that “no man in the
A.I.F. had taken more chances.” The
General nr'ght as well make the claim for
himself. Bean lived, as White did, at Corps
H.Q. I was there once —when it was at La
Fletre. The spick-and-span moated villa was
so far back at the time that it never had a
bomber over, much less a shell. Bean visited
the line mostly when there was an Allied

stunt on—he could hardly have got up in
time for a Boche assault—and that was
about the safest time to be in the accursed
place. The noise was terrific, but it came
mostly from our guns; and, further, the Hun
had to concentrate on such occasions on cer-
tain objectives. Anyone who avoided them
was all right.; It would have been Bean’s
duty to avoid them. Not so a captain in
charge of a company or an artillery section
officer with his guns in action. A glance at
the bald official account of the deeds done by
V.C., D.C.M. and even M.M. winners will
give a line as to some of the risks run by
members of the A.1.F., dead and alive, and
Bean would rightly have been sent back to
England had he attempted to take them. He
did his job like a man ; everyone is agreed
about that. There is no sense in gilding the
lily of adulation further.

“O. Blin” : Behind the main fight in the
seamen’s strike I suspect a personal struggle
between Walsh and Clarkson. Their bitter
antagonism is obvious. To my mind there
is no more unfortunate circumstance than
the appearance of these two on opposite
s'des. Walsh is a wind-bag suddenly swol-
len to the point of explosiveness by unde-
served authority. He has all the artless
vanity of the actor, with the intellectual
pride of the half-informed economist, and
the spirit of concession is not in him.
Clarkson is a big, vain man whose ego has
been nourished on the adulation of news-
papers. Yet he has even been called a
“muddler” in circles where that sort of
criticism is usually absent. He hasn’t the
slightest idea of compromise, either; ' and
while he plays the immovable autocrat to
the irresistible despot of Mr. T. Walsh, the
deluded workers and the general public
have to pay to watch the comedy.
* •:* * *
“Trot”: An embargo erected against pas-
sengers from Australia by the Maoriland
Government pending the construction of ad-
ditional quarantine huts hung up several hun-
dred people from the Dominion in Sydney.
Then came the strike, which hung them up
some more, in spite of 17 indignation meetings
every week and the bombardment of Massey’s
understudy with burning protestations per
cable three times a day. There were some
hard cases among them. One elderly gentle-
man had been recommended by a medical
man at Wellington to take a short sea trip
for the cure of insomnia. He reached Syd-
ney just as the supply of sea trip was
turned off at the meter, and in the subse-
quent three months he got about four hours’
slumber during the intervals of speculation
as to why he hadn’t gone on to Yokohama.
The shipload of infuriated islanders who got
away a week ago threatened to form them-
selves into an indissoluble party the day
after arrival and present the local Govern-
ment with a bill for £171,(142 19s. 4d. to
cover cost of maintenance and worn-out boots
and as compensation for the severance of
family ties.
“Itepi’o”: Returned men are being pam-
pered by the Shire of Sliepparton (Vic.)
with the help of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment. They will be given preference,
qualifications being equal, for the job of
curator of the municipal gardens and street
trees at a salary
of £2 a week pay-
able monthly. As
if that weren’t
enough the Fed3ral
Government will
pay the man who
gets the billet £l2
a year for taking
charge of meteoro-
logical instruments.
A while ago there
was a fairly decent
municipal job going
at Shepparton, but
it was far too good
for a soldier. Any-
way, the Sheppar-
ton Council went
to a lot of trouble
to see that a soldier
didn’t get it.
“Stanley B.” : If Australia wants to hold
the complete affection of her travelled sons,
she will have to wear a rose over one ear.
Last week two Diggers from France just off
a transport hailed a street paper-seller with
“Hey, son, which of the parks is the baud
playin’ in to-day? We gutter couple of
hours to put in.” The Melbourne youngster
grinned back at them. “’Strewth, Diggers,
you d go stone-cold before you’d strike a
band in this town. Yer only hope’s th’

associate parks and sunlight, with band
music shrugged their shoulders and went
off to a pub,
“Seebee” : Some of the Aussies camped on
Salisbury Plain left their mark on England
all right. The Wiltshire hills are composed
of chalk, overlaid by a thin covering of turf,
and a little work with the shovel will clear
the latter, exposing the snowy carbonate of
lime. Billjim and his cobbers got busy on
the hills parallel to the Salisbury-Shafts-
bury road, and now miles away can be seen,
gleaming white against the green, a huge
Rising Sun badge, an albino ’roo and a
large map of Australia. These emblems are
not alone, however, for various Tommy
regiments have added their regimental
crests. The White Horse of Wiltshire, made
in a similar manner, and long famous, is
only an also-ran these days.

“It is contrasts that mate best. Physical charac-
teristics reflect temperament; the young man in
search of a mate, therefore, should study the color
of her eyes, her hair, complexion, and so on.”
To heights like this I cannot rise,
No matter what the cost may be;
I never found a fault in eyes
That did not find a fault in me.
To stop and pass a judgment cold
On hair is simply wicked waste
Of time when brown and black and gold
Have equal claims upon one’s tgste.
I like to follow good advice,
. Though how to, herb, I cannot see.
To me it seems that she is nice ~
Who is the nicest girl to me.
My temp’rament is versatile;
So, therefore, would it not be well
To have a dark girl for a while—
And then a fair one for a spell?
Pray, give me all the aid you can:

If it will help out Nature’s plan
I’ll have a wife for every phase.

lowest; you can get instructive afternoons

a bob a week, refreshments thrown in.
Italian is the same price, but there’s nothing
to eat. Japanese is 2s. a week, but in this
case there are lantern views of Japan as
well as free food. Anyone capable of col-
laborating with an authoress can get French
and singing as payment in kind. Short-

“F.R.” salutes:
I never heard their names, but they came from
Maoriland, two of them, and opened the M.L. Rest
Club at Ismailia, on the Canal. It was the best-
conducted establishment of its kind in F.gvpt, and
the Aussie and the Tommy who were so unfortunate
as to be dumped in this most wretched village were
as warmly welcomed as the Maorilanders. Soon
after the outbreak of war the “heads” in Cairo
caused every white woman of the oldest profession
to remove herself from Ismailia, with the result
that the soldiers were left to the mercies of the
lowest type of Gyppo and Soudanese female. The
M.L. Rest Club opened up in the vicinity of the
wazzir, and the home-cooked meals, library and re-
creation rooms kept the men away from the hotbed
of filth next door. We ought to have decorations
of our own for such women.

“Clingstone”: The news that Australia
has commenced to make its own pennies and
half-pennies inspires me with nothing but
regret. The principal reason people put up
with these uHv and cumbersome coins is
that most of them have never known any-
thing better. Why can’t we eliminate the
coppers and substitute neat, clean little
nickel coins? And if Canada, for example, can
have a metric system, why can’t we? Con-
sider how easily the change could be made.
The half-sovereign could be taken as the unit.
It is composed of 10 shillings, so all that

would be required would bo to coin two nickel
tokens representing one-tenth and one-
1 wontieth of a shilling to take the place of
the pennies and kalf-pennies. Possibly the
best coin to use as a model for the new
nickel penny would be the Belgian 10-
centime piece. It is an artistic little token
about the size of a shilling. The 5-centime
piece, or half-penny, is of the same design,
only smaller. Its special feature is that it
has a hole pundhed through it. When
packages of coppers are sent out by the
banks the seals have to be broken before
the contents can be checked. When coins

A coo-ee from Bagdad :
Australians lent a hand in some out-of-the-way
parts of the world during the war years. How many
people at home know that some of us did wireless
service in Persia and Southern Russia? In 1917 a
party accompanied the withdrawing Russians as far
as Kermanshah, and remained there nearly nine
months. They were snowed-in part of the time, and
no transport or supplies of any sort could reach
by or dinary means. Later another party went
£ amadan to take over a wireless station that
Russians. A hand-

Rad »> dunn ° *he up-and-down experiences of the
sniall Brltlsh f ° rce there. Meanwhile the Ramadan
lofc had moved north towards Tabriz, eventually
coming to a halt at Zinjan. The road traversed was
a mere track over the mountains, known only to a
few natives, one of whom acted as guide. The
station was erected and dismantled every night-no
light job in unsuitable country-and as the trans-
port was heavy, the party had a tough time. On
the return to Bagdad, an almost continuous trek
of between six and seven hundred miles was made,
all with horse transport. For long-distance work,
tile experiences of this party will take some beating.
“T.S.”: Things are happy now on the rail-
ways in North Queensland, where the
I.W.W. is supreme. Nobody takes much
notice of orders except those of the Union
boss, but to be reported to him is very like
being reported to the Council of Ten in old
Venice. Young officials occasionally swear at
passengers, not with
the slightest ill-feeling,
but because it is neces-
sary to show that they
are no longer slaves.
They keep the trains
late for the same rea-
son. They drop bag-
gage hard for the same
reason; a man who
didn’t drop baggage
hard enough might be
suspected of “smoog-
ing” to the monopolist,
or approving of mili-
tarism, or not being
enthusiastic about the
wrongs of Paul Free-
man. So far they are
happy children play-
ing at pirates and half-
inclined to establish a
republic at Cloncurry
and issue unlimited
paper -money, and
otherwise make things
hum. They haven’t
done much real harm
as yet, and they are a
refreshing crowd if you
don’t argue with them.
The best way is to
listen to their ideas
and then tell them
they aren’t one-tenth
as revolutionary as
they should be and are
only fit for a Sunday-school. Under that
reproach you can see their heads shrinking.

“Denholm” : “We can’t do too much for the
Digger.” Some people have misread it and
think they can’t do the Digger for too much.
Bill, in a Brisbane case, was attracted by an
ad. which announced “a well-established
poultry-food manufacturing business” for
sale, “with good plant, well stocked, and
turnover capable of £l6O per week; pur-
chaser taught the business ; price £200.” Bill
bought it for £lBO, the other £2O being
knocked off because “he had fought for us.”
When the Digger woke up and asked a Judge
about it, an expert valued the plant at
not more than £25, and the Court finally gave
Bill a verdict for £l7O, with costs, plus an
order that he should retain the machine,
which was valued at £25. Chief Justice
Cooper said he “would not be surprised if
hundreds of these things were started now
to take down the foolish soldier.” Evidently
Pope Cooper has met the patriot before.

“Quack”: It is alleged by “Steve Hart”
(B. 3/7/T9), who “got it from a dinkum
source,” that a doctor made over £lOO out
of a tin of condensed milk in inoculating
for ’flu. This is an ancient yarn now, and
I refuse to believe it. I have heard it
told over and over with gusto as an argu-
ment against inoculation. It is to be pre-
sumed that the medical authorities checked
up their issues of the serum and could
easily have disproved the widespread scandal
if disproof hadn’t been considered beneath
their dignity. But, if the source from
which “Steve Hart” got his information is
d : nkum, the offence is so dreadful that his
duty is obvious. Nobody with knowledge
doubts now that the serum has had ex-
cellent effects in reducing the death-rate.
Medical men with few exceptions agree that
the mortality would have been much greater
but for the serum; which fact lifts the
alleged substitution up to the level of poison-
ing. there being no moral difference between
p- : T"T-.a. nouon in secret and privily with-
holding a lifesaver, substituting therefor, for
gain, something that could not possibly be
beneficial. A man who did it on the scale
alleged would run 200 separate chances of
being unfrocked and losing his means of live-
lihood ; and no man with so large a practice
as this one seems to have would be such an
ass.

“D.” feels homicidal:—
I would like to see something drastic done to
the Dago fish-and-oyster pirate of Sydney. De-
portation, gaol, assassination, assault—all these have
occurred to me as reasonable; but they are not
feasible, in the present defective state of the law.
At the Markets it is possible to buy a whiting, fresh
and fairly bulky, for 6d.: I know because I have
done it. For a similar fish, from 12 .to 24 hours
older, I was asked 3s. at a Circular Quay shop the
other night. There is- a glut of flathead, but the
fish-ring- keeps up the price, and not less than
Is. 6d. is charged for sufficient to put before one
normal person.
It is impossible to dogmatise about prices since
they vary as regards exorbitancy in the different
shops ; but it is safe to say that the lowest charge
for any sort of fish,-is 50 per cent, above what is
required to return the seller a generous profit. In
all but a few establishments the practice of “wash
ing” oysters in filthy water contained in a bucket
or sink prevails. In most of them fish is wrapped
up firstly in an aged piece of newspaper, and then
in the unpolluted wrapping which the law demands.
Rarely are fish scaled nowadays, and the gutting is
only half done.
Here are some possible methods of discouraging
the fish-profiteer. Let every fish-retailer be given
a license, the same to be retained as in the case
of milkmen, motorists and judges quamdtiu si bene
ffcsserit. On a first conviction for profiteering, or
selling bad fish, or handling it in an insanitary
manner, or keeping his shop in a filthy state, or
doing any one of the hundred other things that
our exploiters from the isles of Greece are up to
every day of their lives, the retailer would have
his license endorsed and pay a heavy fine. The
second offence would lead to another endorsement
and a heavier fine: the third to cancellation of
the license and a term in prison.
If the result was satisfactory to the public, as I
feel sure it would be, the method could then be
applied to other retailers—beginning, say, with
fruiterers, and passing on to butchers, grocers and
gas cos.
* * * *
“Searchlight”: Most of the shoplifting
nowadays seems to be done by the customer.
When I worked in a city house years ago
the thieving was largely done from the
other side of the counter. Remember a
young chap who used to grow pot plants. He
was a great enthusiast —used to bring in
one or two in the morning and take them
out to a florist who bought his stuff at
lunch-time. Of course the usual accident
happened, and it was discovered that hidden
under a thin layer of soil was any small
article worth purloining, from fancy studs
and links to a watch or two. A girl assist-
ant was passing out one evening when her
presence was requested in the office, and the
lady searcher unwound something like a
hundred yards of ribbon silk from Miss
Giggle’s leg. Those were bad old days when
some firms allowed as much as 10 per cent,
for thefts by employees—and paid less wages
accordingly, the honest employee being there-
by victimised.

to be in possession of clothing of the same pattern
(with minor alterations of course) as the British
officer, plus a large variety of maps, books and
technical gear which the “other ranks” do not
have to carry. It is a physical impossibility for
him to hump this lot about on his back, and regula-
tions provide for a baggage waggon to
become part of a battalion transport solely for
this purpose. In the Metcren affair the orders
were that everybody was to travel only with
the uniform he stood in, and they were carried
out; all surplus was stored in Meteren School,
where it was ultimately lost by the Tommies
while we were stopping the Hun at Dernaneourt.

When I was laid up with the ’flu,
And told my love ’twixt cough and sneeze.
My temperature was one-nought-two.

She smiled and squeezed my hand next day ;
I wheezed with joy and pinched her knee;
She tweeked my ear and slid away.

And felt ’twas good to be alive;
With bliss I gurgled, choked and gasped.
My temperature rang one-nought-five.

I’d backed both ways my hopes of Heaven.

"I've seen some things before through
Grogan’s booze, but this — cripes!”
’ “Rolling Stone”; The narrative o£ “Al-
manac” (B. 15/5/’l9) of how- one Mick O’Callaghan
jacked a bogged lorry with his shoulders brings to
memory big Bert Gillespie. At Timaru (M.L.),
Where Bob Fitzsimmons got his punch, I saw Bert
pick up in his arms and throw into his timber-
waggon an overturned phaeton which was blocking
the roadway. Gillespie in those days was anchor-
man in the local champion tug-of-war team. The
only practice before a big “pull” that he indulged
in was that of dragging one of his draught horses
round the backyard whilst his wife kept busy with
a whip enticing the prad to pull against her
hubby!
“Werrimee”: Apropos Judge Bevan’.t
struggle to find out what a hogget really is. In
most sheds I have been in a suckling sheep was a
lamb; after it was weaned it was a hogget until
the second (or first adult) shearing. It was then
about 17 or 18 months old. Its earliest coat was
lamb's wool. People ask for lamb chops, etc., at
the butcher's. I don't think any lamb is sold in
the shops. What passes for lamb is hogget—some
of it ripe enough for common mutton.
* * * *
“The Dreamer”: I have just made the
acquaintance of a water-spidrr. I was standing on
a bridge which spans a small
river in the north-east corner
of the Speck when he came
floating placidly down stream.
With eight legs outstretched
he lay flat upon the surface
of the water, black and grey
in color, and about two arid
a half inches from toe to
toe of outstretched leg. There
was not a' particle of his
anatomy under water; it was
all on top as though he
rested on a sheet of glass.
Suddenly and quick as a flash
he jumped an inch or two
skyward, probably at a pass
ing insect, 'then continued his
voyage -until the stream
carried him against a partly-
submerged log, up which be
climbed. With a small stick
I touched him gently and he
at once submerged by crawl-
ing under the log, and there
lie remained, about two inches
below the surface, apparently
quite at home and comfort-
able. A second application of
the stick brought him out of
the water on to the log again.
Now most things animate or
inanimate are more or less
wet when they emerge from
water, but this chap was
bone-dry ; his glossy black
and grey check suit had not
a trace of moisture on it.
Water, apparently, runs off him as it does off a
duck’s back. I again applied the stick and once
more he submerged, a little deeper this time and
farther under the log, and there I left him.

“Almanac”: This is how to prevent your
boots slipping when out shooting or fishing. Paint
the soles and heels with warm coal-tar, then dust
over with dry sand and stand, with soles upwards
for 48 hours. That will provide you with a non-
skid, waterproof foundation with a grip like a
moneylender’s.
» * * *
“Oowpuneher” : The cow (B. 22/5/’ I'.) )
which lias milked continuously for 121 years has
probably been spayed, an operation which involves
the removal of the ovaries. Any Strawberry which
has undergone this operation is liable to milk in-
definitely, every Spring breaking out in full flow
again. But once she goes dry she is of no further
use except to the slaughter-house.
* * * *
“Chloe”: One of the most hospitable Lach-
lan (N.S.W.) homesteads in the old days was Bar-
veenong, where, on Sundays particu-
larly, all guests were sure of a welcome
and good entertainment, a feature of
which was the “bird magic” of the
host. He was perhaps the best, if not
the most scientific, of Australian bird-
men. He had thousands of pets, not
one caged. The guests used to as-
semble on the lawn or verandah and
keep silence while he, going a little
way off, commenced his imitation calls.
Magpies, shrike, the shy thrush, quail,
jay, woodpecker, peewit, parrot and
parrakeet all came in turn for JV .1.
Strickland. He could reproduce per-
fectly the whistle, note or cry of each.
Even the shy apostle-bird, with its.
strident and curious cry, was lured to
the homestead. Each too, was feted
in turn—flies to one, raw meat to
another, a little sugar, crumbs, a crust
smeared, with jam, and other titbits.
The familiarity of this great bird
family became in time an annoyance to
the cook and to the women folk of the
homestead. The visitors flew in and
out of the rooms at any old time, until at last
verandah and kitchen had to be protected with wire-
netting.
* * * , *
“A. Borig”: As a bird-lover I agree with
“FY7” (B. 29/5/’l9) that the native-companion
is a beautiful thing and worthy of some sort of
protection, but then I -am not a grower of maize.
In the late ’sixties and in the ’seventies and early
’eighties I lived at Canberra, where many thousands
of bushels of corn were grown annually, and every
year about September the brolgas arrived, sharpen-
ing their bills on the soles of their feet. I have
seen a flock in 10 minutes so completely destroy
two acres of young corn that the paddock had to be
replanted. The dogs were trained to sool ’em with-
out being sent when they heard the yell of the
thieves.
“Wart”: Re the half-castes of the Bass
Straits Islands (B. 5/6/’ 19). Survejmr-General
Galder, in 1868, reckoned their numbers at 80 or
90. From the very early days many of them have
been noted for beauty and for their light color.
Briggs, who was with Kelly in his whaleboat
journey round Tassy, had two black wives on Flin-
ders Island. One of them was the daughter of
Lamanbunganah, chief of ti e Ringarooma tribe, and
one of her daughters was Dolly Dalrvmple, born at
the Tamar Settlement in 1808. Lieut. Jeffreys, of
the Ocean (1820), described the latter as being re-
MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
HIS REVERENCE : “ It's very distressing to
see the boys fighting loike this on a
Sunday. Who is the other wan besoides
Dinny Ryan?"
REGAN : “ He's wan of thim Wesleyan here-
tics, father .”
HIS REVERENCE : “Go for him, Dinny."
markably handsome, of a light color, with rosy
cheeks; large black eyes, the whites of which were
tinged with blue; long, well-formed eyelashes; teeth
uncommonly white; and limbs admirably formed.
During the black “war” she was living with a
stock-keeper named Johnson, at Dairy Plains. One
day in Johnson's absence the place was attacked
by a party of aborigines, and one of the children
was speared in the thigh. Dolly had to pull out
the spear before she could get the girl through the
door, and then she kept off the attackers for some
hours till Johnson arrived. Governor Arthur gave
her a grant of 10 acres for this act. He also gave
Johnson 10 acres and a free pardon on condition
that the pair married. Mrs. Johnson brought up
a family of girls celebrated all over the Speck for
their beauty. All the authorities agree that most of
the women that the sealers had on the islands came
from the Tasmanian coast —mostly from the ltinga-
rooma and Waterhouse tribes. One man had ten
“wives” on different islands.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: A kangaroo with two
joeys is not quite as rare as backing a winner.
Away back in the ’nineties I shot a young doe on
the headwaters of the Buffalo River (Vic.). She
had two joeys about the size of beans in her vanity
bag. I have also found three “black” wallabies
carrying twins. In one case the joeys were so im-
mature that they bled when pulled off the teat.
Two joeys were fairly common with the kangaroo
rat, especially the “white tip” variety , ditto with
the common grey ’possum of the box and red-gUm
country, but I'never saw the big black-pointed silver-
grey “mountain” ’possum of the messmate and
peppermint forests with more than one little ’un,
possibly because the full-growns were comparatively
rare even at that time. I don’t know whether
Missus Wombat ever presents the Old Man with
twins, but judging by the grumpiness of Old Man
Wombat I hardly think the lady would risk it.
Anyhow, although I have examined several thousand
wombats, dead and alive, I never found more than
one joey in the pouch.
• * « •
“Macropus”: It is evident that “Jim
Carew” (B. 22/5/’l9) is not acquainted with the
recent history of the late Daniel O’Connor's accli-
matisation experiments on ceratodus, when he says
that the species can only be found in the Burnett
and Mary rivers of Queensland. Nearly 23 years
ago —in August, 1896 —16 specimens of the fish
obtained from the Mary were introduced into the
Upper Coomera River (South Queensland) by
O’Connor. No information was put on record in
regard to the experiment until last year, when a
ceratodus measuring approximately 191 inches was
caught in this stream by Whalley Bros., about
eight miles from the locality where O’Connor liber-
ated his fish. The specimen was presented to the
Bananaland Museum, and in September, 1918, it
was exhibited by the director of that institution
before the Royal Society of Queensland. As O’Con-
nor’s specimens ranged from 33-45 inches in length,
it is obvious that the Whalley capture was bred'
in the Coomera.
* * * *
“Romney”: “Sapit” (B. 5/6/’l9) asks if
anybody has an explanation as to the relationship
between rabbit-poisoning and blowflies. When feed
is dry and somewhat scanty sheep are usually
healthy and offer no attraction to the blowfly; but
in the same circumstances the rabbit accepts the
poison bait. On the other hand, when feed is rich
and abundant bunny has no time for artificial food,
while the sheep over-gorge and develop liver, kidney
and other disorders, in consequence of which they
become prey for the blowfly. It is only when flocks
are allowed to get into an unhealthy condition that
the fly attacks them. They can be maintained in
perfect health by the use of prophylactic sheep lick,
and consequently immune from the blowfly curse,
whether the rabbits take poison or not.
“Pat Lander”: Although rabbits have
never been known here on Norfolk Island, yet, from
as far back as the oldest inhabitant can remember,
Phillip Island, only three miles away, has had a
colony of bunnies. Phillip Island is uninhabited,
and is- only about 500 acres in area, very precipi-
tous, and practically destitute of grass; consequently
bunny has to live on leaves, and has acquired great
skill as a tree-climber. Norfolk Island tradition
credits the Phillip Island rabbit with having de-
veloped cannibalistic tendencies owing to his
struggle for existence, but whether this is true or
not I don’t know.
“O’North”: On the subject of the re-
juvenation of corroded tanks. Swab inside with
wafer, freely perforate walls from outside, thus en-
suring jagged iron keys inside for the cement.
Plaster inside with a mixture of two parts sand to
one of cement, fin. thick at thinnest part. For
appearance the outside might also be given a coat
of red oxide paint. A 1000-gal. tank will take
three bags cement and Jyd. sand, and occupy a
plasterer arid his laborer for about a day. Total
cost, about £4 ss. Hundreds of Queensland Govern
ment tanks have been treated in this way during the
war, though in some cases wire-netting reinforce-
ment was used to walls in lieu of the keys formed
by the perforations. The cost militated against the
continued use of the latter method. The conserved
water is always exceptionally cool and sweet, and
the reinforced tanks are practically everlasting.

“Senex”: “F.R.S.’s” par. (B. l/5/’I!M
about good : Australian mothers rouses me to cham-
pion my own little district. It’s in Far North
Queensland, where, I’ve heard, the white man can'l
thrive. There are 21 families, with 104 children
under 18 among ’em, including three pairs of twins
A DOUBLE EVENT.
“Come on, lesh ’ave ’ nother; whash it morrer

“Fes, yesh, dear boy; but y'see you're be-
ginnin ’ to be twins, and I (hic) gotten
prej’dish ’gainst twins."
At one time there were 22 children attending the
local school from three families. Only one child
has died in the settlement since I came here 11
years ago, and that fatality was caused by a falling
tree. Three cheers for the splendid mothers, and
three more for the awful climate!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some songsters gaily chant in tuneful praises
The glories and the splendors of the track:
The way the merry swagsman spends his days is
To stroll from town to town and then stroll back:
Just like Elijah, tuckered by the ravens,
With kindly squatters to assuage his wants,
Then gently bow him from their peaceful havens
Dressed in said squatter’s Sunday coat and pants,
lie sees the stars, the moon, the flush of dawning
That heralds in the east the new-hatched day,
And, turning over, slowly rises, yawning.
And curses in his bright melodious way.
Once, once, 1 sought* cool corners where the breeze is,
When summer punts the mercury sky-high;
And read and sighed “How dull this life of ease is
Compared with pitching .camp. as dusk draws nigh.”
I pictured the dark outlines where the trees ran,
The billy, and the camp-fire’s fitful glow;
1 pictured every item that could please man,
And nothing that a durn fool ought to know.
I yearned to spurn my own dull social trammels
To see the jumbucks bucking on the plain,
To toddle with an Afghan after camels,
But travel first-class smoker in the train.
Ah, would that 1 had been content with yearning,
Resigned to track 'mid Sydney’s sinful whirl!
Alas, I scorned good money 1 was earning;
1 shook my job, and also lost my girl.
Yet still 1 joyed ; the open road lay waiting.
1 bought a billy (second-hand) and swag,
As funds were rather low—l don’t mind stating
My swift departure followed on a jag.
Since then I've tracked by river, town and station.
By waterholes where microbes swarmed galore;
And now, I state, with firm determination,
1 don't intend to wander any more.
Mo more for me the prickly-.pear. shallvpfickleV-
The Bathurst-burr may burr like any Scot :
No muddy slime shall in my billy trickle
From holes where drought-slain sheep are left to rot.
No grilling ’neath a blazing sun near Cobar
At pick and shovel yakker in a tank, r
Where she with whom we boarded thought it no bar
To bathe each day in water that we drank.
Farewell to ants, mosquitoes, snakes and sandflies!
My travelling in future is per tram.
And if for my laborious aid the land cries
I will not listen to its crying worth a d—n.

“H.V.E.”: The quaint antediluvian fowl
known as musk-duck is becoming rare—at any rate
on Monaro and the extreme south coast of N. S.
Wales. In the former district the strange bird was
fairly common two or three decades ago in lakes
and in deep, still reaches in the rivers. Same is
true of the Bega district, where it once haunted
THE BUSH FIRE BRIGADE.
THE OLD 'UN: “ What are yous lads 'angin ’ round here I or?"
MICKO: Well, dad, me an ’ me cobber thought yer might need a hand if yer crop caught
alight."
the lagoons and swamps. The fowl, so far as my
experience goes, lays only two eggs, hence the rate
of increase is comparatively slow. The eggs are
very rounded, and in size about equal to those of
the wedge-tailed eagle. It is jpnly in the breeding
season, I believe, that the male exhales an odor of
musk. In some parts of Westralia the abos. con-
sider the flesh a delicacy, especially the breast.
But it is not easy to catch a feed. This duck is
a mighty quick diver, and gets below the surface
in the fraction of a second.

“Wanderer”: Travelling from Nice to
Marseilles, back from Italy, where the ’flu was
raging, I was surprised when a madame with two
small children produced a packet of fags and gave
one to each of the nippers. At once the smell of
the gum struck my nose. On inquiry madame
assured me that the eucalypt kept the “Spanish
fever” away. Ask any Dago what he thinks of our
despised gum 1 It was good, riding along in the
train, to see miles of them. In private gardens in
the cities our tree is an ornament, every garden
having one at least; and after coming from the
cold lands (North-Eastern France, Belgium and
part of Germany) where all trees except the pines
lose their foliage, to see the evergreen Australian
with his shiny old leaf glinting was glorious. Any
person who when I get back tells me our eucalypts
are not pretty will be liable to stop one.

“O’North”: Here it is at last—an un-
failing white-ant exterminator. Make a sandwich
of two one-inch pine boards, spreading treacle and
arsenic on the two contiguous sides, and place under
building in a secluded place near the ant-run. The
slaughter is thorough, as the arsenic never dis-
appears, and ants flock to the holocaust from all
quarters, dead ants being very choice morsels (all
ants are cannibals). I have seen whole colonies
of them eradicated in a few weeks in this way from
low-lying buildings where no other method of ex-
termination was feasible.

“Mrs. Lance Rawson”; Anyone know why
the skin of a black snake used to be considered a cure
for headache? In the ’fifties and ’sixties it was a
very common thing to see women with, a snake skin
bound round their heads. The boys and the blacks
used to do good business selling the remedy at ss.
and 7s. 6d. a time. Have heard women declare that
their headache went away after wearing a black
snake’s wrapper for an hour or so. Faith cure, no
doubt.
“Agricola”: There seems to be an impres-
sion abroad that an oyster-lease is a fine dumping-
place for a returned soldier. It looks lovely to
the outsider, who watches the lessee poking oysters
into bags and cashing cheques at the rate of £3
10s. per sack; but the leases which have been
granted on the N.S.W. South Coast to soldiers are
mostly “sick” (those where oyster-blight is always
liable) or very muddy or tide-swept. Further,
Billjim is not told of the weary time he will spend
raking out grape-weed at every low tide. Neither
is he informed that the star-fish and stingarees are
as fond of oysters as any chorus-girl. He is left
to discover for himself, too, that a flood like that
which lately ruined three-fourths of the leases from
Bermagui to Eden (N.S.W.) is liable to lay bare
one portion of his patch and spread three or four
feet of silt on the rest of it. Let me know if you
see a returned soldier buying a motor-ear with the
profits from his bivalve farm.
“Binnong”: Re “Myall’s” query (B.
f>/6/’l9) if anybody has seen a litter of dingo
puppies during the summer or autumn months. I
saw one lot taken out of a log in January. There
were seven of them, about three weeks old. I have
also seen dingo pups in the middle of winter about
six months old, which would suggest that the visits
of the dingo-stork are not confined to any special
time of the year.
* » * *
“Agricola”: I thirst for information as to
why the mangrove does not grow in lakes or lagoons
which are not continuously open to the sea. The
mangrove is a persistent vegetable, and its wants
appear to be few, so the above-mentioned lapse ex-
cites comment. Wapengo Lake, Middle Lake, Nelson
Lake, Bega River mouth and Wallagoot Lake form
a series of inlets south of Bermagui (N.S.W.), and
they average about two miles apart. Wapengo and
Nelson are continuously open to the sea, and in only
these does the mangrove grow. The Bcga closes sea-
ward only during a long, dry spell, usually once in
two years; Wallagoot is closed for varying periods
every year; Middle Lake remains open only for a
few days after a flood; and during the past four
years Bega River has been closed for not more than
five weeks altogether. Yet the mangrove avoids them
all with equal care.
* * * *
“Pick”: Does any poacher know the Angora
rabbit? Anyhow, that is what they call the very
rare specimen at the Bungendore freezery (N.S.W.).
He is a “grizzly” blue, with white face and ears.
He is somewhat larger than the ordinary bunny, and
he doesn’t burrow. Being a non-scratcher he can-
not bo trapped, but the peagun is employed for his
destruction. His chief quality is the length of his
coarse and shaggy fur, which grows to a staple of
three inches or more.
’ Hannibal”: A cobber of mine, aged 30,
living in the Comboyne district (N.S.W.), was left
at home alone the other day. While he was busy
hoeing some weeds a snake bit one of his big toes.
The future Digger cut the puncture and attempted
to suck the poison out. 1 inding that his mouth
and his leg’s extremity wouldn’t meet, he smeared
the toe with cream and pushed it into the mouth
of a calf not yet weaned from the “finger. When
dad and mum returned home their hopeful was
little the worse for the accident. Neither was the
calf, except that it went off its food for a few
days.
* * * .
“Young Australian”: Peeramon scrub
(N.Q.) is the home of two of the most remarkable
bodies of water in Australia—Lakes Barrine and
Eacham. If the Irish Killarneys are Heaven’s reflex,
then I know a better place than Heaven. Peeramon
has a beauty unrivalled, a sweetness and majesty
of environment that would make a soul develop
in a female Yankee revue “artiste.” Take into
your mind’s eye a magnificent pool of still, green
water, rivalling the emerald in the intensity of
its color. That is Lake Eacham. Receiving no
tribute from river or stream, it returns nothing
visible to any ocean. It is a marvel of nature.
Dense scrubs wander to the edge, and halt as if in
amazement. Save that the forest on the far side
re-echoes the chirp of the cricket, the croak of a
frog, or the scream of the catbird, the waters of
Barrine and Eacham lie in a silence as of the
giave. Yet there is no weirdness, no uncanniness—-
only a sweet and penetrating air of delicious lone-
liness.

“0. Coral”: A big rusted anchor alongside
one of the reefs close to Darnley Island, Torres Strait,
marks a tragedy of many years ago, when a 'big
ship hit the spot. .The crew made a raft and
got ashore in an exhausted state, but their white
skin gave the natives the impression that they were
fiom the spirit world, since the deceased natives’
peeled-off skin revealed whiteness beneath. Conse-
quently a council of the islanders resulted in the
shipwrecked men being clubbed to death. Their
heads were cut off and put into the oven
to clean all the flesh , off, so that they might
be preserved, this being the local custom when
those from other islands were killed in warfare,
and the bodies were placed on the raft and sent
out to sea. The skulls were hanging up in a house
in the central portion of the island when the first
missionary happened along, but were afterwards
taken down and cremated. Nothing from the boat
has ever come to light.

“Wilga”: “Steve Hart” asked (B.
19/6/ 19) whether a dog “on the wing,” or ringing
a mob of sheep, should turn out or in when coming
back. My answer is that a dog on the lead of
bolting jumbucks should turn out. By so doing
he meets sheep that are breaking behind him. A
stockman on the lead of rushing cattle or horses
always turns his mount’s tail to the herd for the
same reason.

The modern kangaroo can’t jump much
better than an elephant. Now, in the good old days
—well, read this from a book written about New
Holland by J. Olney, in 1837, and published in New
York: “The most remarkable animal is the kan-
garoo, which is said to leap SO yards at a single
bound.”
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
DINER: “Here, what d'you call this? Beef or mutton?”
WAITRESS : “ Carn't yer tell the difference?”
DINER: “No!”
WAITRESS : "Then why worry about it?”
“Ida D”: Malcolm Mac’s” (B. 5/6/’l9)
cure for a fish sting is very like the one we bush-
whackers use when we burn or scald ourselves—the
skin not being broken. We just grease the injured
part and hold it close to the fire. The pain makes
us hop for a minute, but that’s the end of it.
“Melos”: The stiffening of the young
porc.’s quills begins about the fourth week of the
youngster’s life. About the end of winter, ma de-
velops a temporary pouch with mammary glands, in
two tuft-like groups studded with numerous small
pores, and therein the young is nurtured till it is
capable of assimilating ant diet. Pore., jun., is
about three inches long on starting out on the first
ant campaign. Incidentally, there are three specie's
of porcupine, viz., the typica, measuring about 15
inches in length and provided with prominent spines
and short hair (habitat, all Australia) setosa, of
Tasmania, larger than typica, and covered with long
hair, which almost conceals the quills; and the
lawesii of S.E. New Guinea, the smallest of the
family and adorned with shorter spines than its
relatives. The three-toed genus (the echidna has
five) is confined to N.W. New Guinea.

“Steve Hart”: Called into Bourke recently
to have a look round the old place once again. I
found it half gone. What hasn’t been carted away is
falling down or has been burned. Goats are every-
where, and camels wander aimlessly about the place.
The pub bars are like morgues. In a butcher’s
shop I saw two frowsy-looking livers and a goat’s
head. I couldn’t find the famous Darling River,
but, looking down 40ft., I saw some greenish
water-weeds on which rested a stranded punt.
Upon it hung the only humorous thing in the whole
show—a sun-scorched lifebuoy! I went down the old
bed of the river past the empty gaol, and struck
numerous dead goats. That settled me. A town that
can’t chuck out enough jam-tins to keep its goats
alive wants cremating.
* * • *
“Lantana”: There is a remarkable in-
stance of self-grafting on the river bank of one of
the upper reaches of the Clarence, where, in the fork
of a sound bottle-brush ti-tree, about four inches
in diameter, there is a peach limb forming nearly
half the top of the tree. This limb for several
3 7 ears bore peaches of the late white variety, but
they were not of very good flavor.
“FY7”: “Steve Hart” asks should a dog
“on the wing” or “ringing” sheep turn out or in
to come back. All depends on how far he is from
the sheep. If he is right on them turning in
may mean a break. If he is well out, turning in
keeps them steady.
MAGPIES IN THE RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Come, out with your flutiest strain,
You happy-go-lucky quartet,
You rollicking rogues on the fence !
You’re surely not making pretence
Of sorrow, you’re getting so wet
Out there in the rain—in the rain?
Pipe up, you redoubtable four!
There isn’t a choir in the town
To such an occasion can rise
As rain after drought. To the skies
That pour their soft melody down,
Your answering melody pour!
You well know the meaning of rain:
For me ’tis the grain that is gold:
You you ’tis the grub and the worm,
Delectable morsels that squirm
As you gather them into the fold—
So out with your choicest refrain!

A Plain
Fact!
Act 11. is devoted to the hydrophobia
experiment, which was one of the greatest
ever made in the history of medicine.
Pasteur has just completed his observations
on animals, and is looking forward to doing
the same on a human being; yet he is
terribly shocked when liis first case turns
out to be a child of nine, who had been
bitten by a mad dog two and a half days
previously. The boy, who has 14 wounds
on the hands and leg, causes Pasteur sleep-
less nights until the success of the experi-
ment is assured. The boy writes thereafter
regularly to him every month; a letter
comes at the moment of liis benefactor’s
triumph at the Sorbonne on his 70th birth-
day.
Some day, a new fashion having been set,
a play may be written dealing with the
career of Pasteur’s great disciple, Joseph
Lister. While Pasteur was engaged in con-
tinual wrangling with dilettante scientists
aiid sceptical surgeons in Paris, who read
the pamphlets recording his experiments
without lifting a hand to aid him in his
investigations into the germ theory of
disease, but on the contrary placed
every obstacle in his way. (Pasteur
wasn’t a doctor, you see!) Joseph Lister,
then at Edinburgh, was putting Pas-
teur’s principles into practice, and carrying
out tlio antiseptic method of treating wound ’
with tremendous enthusiasm. Instrument
and dressiDgs were sterilized, the skin washed
with carbolic lotion, and a spray of the same
liquid was kept going in the operating
theatre during the progress of operations.
The antiseptic treatment, started by Lister,
was afterwards abandoned in favor of the
aseptic method; but we have come back
to the antiseptic method again, for wounds
in the war were treated by constant irri-
gation with antiseptic fluid —the highly
successful Carrel-Dakin method.
Act 11. is the most interesting of all
for in it the author has been allowed to re-
produce the seance at the Academy of Medi-
cine in 1880. Mounting the tribune of the
Academy, Pasteur proceeds to give the
audience a bit of his mind. Amongst other
things, he remarks that spontaneous genera-
ion is myth, and he holds Jules Gu6rin
up to ridicule for his hazy views on the
virus of.,smalT-pox. M. Poggiale then tackles
him, and next it is M. Fremy. “Do you
know what you lack, M. Fremy?” he shouts.
“I’ll tell you—skill with the microscope!”
The infuriated Guerin afterwards rushed at
Pasteur, necessitating the closing of the
seance.
In Act V. Pasteur reaches the pinnacle
of his fame —on his 70th birthday—Decem-
ber 27, 1592. Representatives of every
learned society in France have assembled at
the Sorbonne to do him honor. He is sitting
in the vestibule of the Sorbonne, everyone
else standing waiting for the arrival of
President Carnot. He hears a great clap-
ping inside the building:
Pasteur: Who has just entered?
A Pupil (alter making inquiries ) : Lister.
Pasteur: What—Lister! At his age! How
good of him!.... I feel quite overcome!
The President of the Republic arrives, and
embraces him in the name of France, Pas-
teur remarking
And I invincibly believe that Science and Peace
will triumph over Ignorance and War, and that the
nations will unite not to destroy but to build.
“Marseillaise” by the band of the Repub-
lican Guard, and cries of “Vive Pasteur”
from the amphitheatre of the Sorbonne.
In Louis Pasteur’s experiences there was
enough material for a dozen plays. His was
a full life He was never off duty during
the whole of his scientific career, except on
one lamentable occasion when he was
stricken with paralvsis. He had not. been
inside a theatre more than ten Times in his
life, while amongst fashionable assemblies
his name never appeared. Gounod, who had
conducted his,own “A™ Maria" ft the great
entertainment at the Crocadero in aid of
the Pasteur Institute, ’Timed round at the
dose and kissed his hands to the great man,
who bad to tell them afterwards that he had
heard their compositions for the first time.
Born in a humble home in the Rue des
Tanneries, Dole, the ooy was sent to the
primary school attached .0 lie college at
Arbois, where he evinced a taste for crayon-
drawing at an early age, and that was all.
Then he was sent :o Paris his first scien-
tific joy was the making 4’ some phosphorus
cut of old bones he lad lurchased. He put
it in a phial and labelled t “Phosphorus.”
His first real success diow. J he »ri -duality
of his mind. It was quite 1 riuroali in
crystallography. He explained whv v.stals
of para tartaric acid had no effect on a ray
of polarised light; a thing that had escaped
cho observation of everyone else. Biot, the
great chemist, who had studied the subject
for 30 years, had to sav, on watching the
experiment, "My dear boy. I have loved
science so much luring n.v life that this has
touched my very heart.” He was soon ap-
pointed to the Professorship of Physics at
Dijon, much to Biot’s disgust. In Septem-
ber. 1854, he was made Professor and Dean
of the new Faculty of Sciences at Lille,
where he began bis studies in fermentations
and, in particular, that of sour milk, called
lactic fermentation. Other chemists had re-
jected the idea of an influence of life in fer-
mentation. In connection with these studies
we soon had a new English .word, “pasteur-
isation,” as applied to wine, beer and
milk. Soon afterwards he was trru . red
to the Ecolc Normale in Paris, his duties
being to look after the students’ economic
and hygienic necessities. On Juno 16. 1865,
at the request of his great friend. J. B.
Dumas, he departed for Alais to ascertain
the cause of the disease in silkworms which
was ruining chat part of the country. This
investigation took him five years. Thar
him on to the investigation of anthiax.
Pasteur wondered if anthrax spores might
be found in fields after the lapse of 14
months. He found that flocks were exposed
to infection by merely grazing over certain
fields in which stock had been buried. An
examination of some earthworms revealed
anthrax spores in the earth cylinders which
filled their intestinal tube.. Chicken-cholera
and swine-fever were then investigated, after
which he turned his attention to saving
human beings. He brought his scientific
mind to bear on puerperal fever, which was
till then surrounded By impenetrable dark-
ness. He was of opinion that his discoveries
might be as useful to obstetrics as they had
been in surgery. Paris doctors were accus-
tomed to come from the post-mortem room
to the maternity wards, with direful results
to the unfortunate patients. In 1864 310
deaths occurred out of 1350 maternity cases.
Pasteur told the Academy of Medicine that
the infection was carried by the medical and
nursing staffs, who brought it. from an in-
fected woman to a healthy one-. He drew
the organism on the blackboard, remarking,
“That’s what it’s like.” When common-
sense and cleanliness prevailed in maternity
cases the mortality dropped to 3 and finally
1 per cent. —another win for laboratory
methods.
After the successful results of the inocu-
lation experiments on the lads Meister and
Jupille, Pasteur’s treatment in rabies began
to take a firm hold of the public imagination.
Paris was thrilled by the sight of 14 moujiks
from Smolensk, wending their melancholy
way twice daily to the laboratory for in-
oculation. Nineteen of these wretched
people (five had to be put to bed), who knew
only one word of French and that “Pasteur,”
had been bitten by a mad wolf which had
torn to pieces everything it met for two
days. Bites from mad wolves are of the
most dangerous kind, owing to the lacera-
tion of the tissues by their sharp teeth, but
Pasteur managed to save 16 of them, whose
return to Russia was a triumph. The Tsar
sent him the Order of St. Anne in diamonds,
and forwarded 100,000 francs in aid of the
already-proposed Pasteur Institute. In 1886
the English Government appointed a Com-
mission to inquire into the inoculaton method
for the cure of rabies, and Pasteur was very
pleased at being able to lay the Commission’s
favorable report on the desk of the Academy
of Sciences.
Rich and poor subscribed to the Institute,
the subscriptions totalling 2,586,680 francs.
Pasteur himself could not attend it, but
the work was carried on by pupils, among
them Yersin, who discovered the plague
bacillus, and Roux, who 'worked at the
anti-toxin of diphtheria; while others
formed Pasteur Institutes at Lille, at
Tunis and at _ Constantinople—the last
under the direction of Nicolle, whose name
appeared in the cables only a few weeks
ago in connection with discoveries in in-
fluenza. So his work goes on; and, after
an orgy of killing, no wonder France turns
for relief to the work which her great son
did in the finer work of life-saving.
L. G. D.
The Inky Way
“E.S.S.”: Mother Bush has a big family
of Australian writing girls. Kathleen
Walker belongs to the beautiful Victorian
lakes. Enid Derham is a native of Haw-
thorn, with an outside ramble ground.
Marion Miller Knowles was born in Gipps-
land, and absorbed the scenic beauties of
the Southern State from end to end. Jessie
Mackay’s childhood and girlhood were spent
on a squattage in Maoriland. Mabel For-
rest was born at Yandilla (Q.), and has
been a bush student and lover all her life-
time. Her sister, Ethel Mills, was cradled
in th.. same inspiring northern bush. Queenie
Halloian was born at Barraba, and Mary
Gilmore is a native of Goulburn. Of the
same State is Ella McFadyen, whose play-
grout 1 was among the big gums and iron-
bark.-.. Rena Wallace belongs to the
N. S Wales South Coast. Iviama, a little
lower down, claims Myra Kendall, a niece
of Henry Kendall. Mrs. Campbell Praed
was born at Bungroopla station, on the Logan,
and lived through the thrilling early history
of that river. Stella Franklin hails from
a Bine Mountain cattle-station, Talbingo:
Mrs. Langloh Parker passed her early life
among the blacks (on the Macquarie, I
think) ; and Mrs. JUneas Gunu did the same
in the wild North.
“D.F.” : Australia’s first bird-painter was
•T. W. Lewin, who reached Sydney in the
Buffalo in May, 1799. His book of plates
of Australian birds, of which there is a per-
plexing variety of editions, some in Sydney
a lid some in London, seems to have been his
main work. The original Sydney edition
was probably the first illustrated book pub-
lished in Australia. Lewin went down to
Kent’s Group and Cape Barrel) with a sealer
in 1800; later lie visited Tahiti and other
Pacific Islands; 1 In his declining years he
doubled painting with the job of coroner at
Parramatta.
Fred Cutlack, of Renmark, who used to
be secretary to editor Sowden, of Adelaide
Register, but went to London before the
war to try his luck at literature, pulled off
a double event on April 25. when he was
(1) entrusted with the Times memorial
article on Anzac Day, and (2) called to the
Bar. He intends to return to Australia
almost at once.
“Seebee”: Sammy Lunn, Adelaide’s own
laureate, is one of the few Australian
rhymers who have acquired a competency
through his efforts. Originally boss of an
ice-cream cait on the Semaphore beach, ho
attracted and held custom with a running
fire of observations on things in general, all
conducted in rhyme. Biz boomed so much
that years ago he retired to enjoy life as
landlord of several houses. When the war
arrived Sammy started battling for Belgian
and other funds, including one of his own,
wherefrom he hands each returning S.A.
Digger ss. pocket-money. He has collected
over £3OOO to date, and his rhyming talk is
responsible for the bulk of it.
Easiness, Robbery, etc.
“Dial Sight” : No one in the Cold Country
will miss the departing Digger more than
the Yids of tlorseferry-road. When the
A.I.F. picked on the Methodist College in
this narrow back alley fpr H.Q., it found
itself surrounded by a colony of old-clo’
vendors. One son of Abraham was lucky
enough to have a small crib that in pre-war
days was worth £.l Ills, a week. As soon
as Billjiin arrived he did a roaring trade in
votehes, identification discs, color patches,
and other side-lines, and I’ll bet my deferred
pay he wouldn’t have taken £25 a week for
his possie.

A talked-of expedition in quest of a
problematical quantitv of gold, drowned with
the Monumental City when that vessel was
wrecked off Gabo Island in 1805, has had a
cold douche from a son of the J. 11. Wheeler,
M.L.A., who formerly sat for Daylesl’ord
(Vic.), and was one of 11 survivors of the
wreck. Old-man Wheeler was invited in the
long-ago to join a syndicate for the recovery
of the gold, but he reckoned the spec, not
good enotisrh. His idea was that the vessel
didn’t carry nearly as much as rumor
then credited it with, and Wheeler’s recol-
lection of how much treasure was supposed
to have been lost is probably worth more
than yarns current about it 50 years after
the event. Anyhow, the Monumental City
broke up on the rocks, and the gold that the
contain < who was drowned) had put away
in a safe, and the gold which some of the
unlucky diggers were said to be trying to
escape with, has had plenty of time to get
lost beyond recovery.
* * * *
“The Pariah”: “Eddyson” (B. 3/7/T9)
asks why we don’t grow goats of the long-
haired variety, so that we might have, be-
sides a crop of mohair, a plenteous supply
of kids for stews, etc. Well, one reason is
that the fence that will keep the Angora
in (or out) will do the same for a lion or
thereabouts. And once adrift the beast lias
an uncanny habit of chewing off exactly the
vegetable that you wanted to preserve.
* * * #
“E. J.H.”: I am as well aware as
“H.M.S.” (B. 26/6/T9) that in wine
tasting and judging at the R.A.S. (Sydney)
bottles are numbered and do not bear a
label. After the judging. however, as
‘“H.M.S.” knows, a list of the wines awarded
prizes and their growers’ names is published.
A few years ago a very sound Burgundy
could be obtained : but of late I haven’t been
able to get a decent glass of this wine
except at the Show 7 . Is it another case of
the best for export and anything left over
for the Australian, as a big meat-exporter
recently stated was the case in the meat
trade ?
* # * *
“Chanco”: “S. Q. Wliyffe” (B. 29/5/’l9)
laments the cost of his pickled olives, which
he reckons run him into 2\A. per berry. It was
the impossible price that blocked me from
indulging in the luxury till I set to worlc and
found out things. Write to Mildura and
ask for a box of green olives to be forwarded
to you. The price is Is. Gd. a doz. pounds.
Then throw the berries into boiled salt-and-
water and, after six weeks, you have a finer
nickle than the best American or English
imported, for per lb. No Australian need
deny himself a plentiful supply of one of the
best of all table delicacies.
-* * * *
“0.K.”: Time goes rolling on since Watt,
the then Premier of Victoria, paid £30,000
for the recovery of the Grange Estate, which
had been filched by some Jong-forgotten
Government from Melbourne’s public park
lands. The conversion of a part of the
stolen property into a public thoroughfare
has been proceeding by fits and starts for.
say, 15 years, but the old original private
gate stands where it did, and some build-
ings remain in an inner enclosure, which is
apparently being carefully nursed for future
use by some l ' ,dy or other. To what some-
body or other has that considerable slice of
£30,000 property been dedicated?

“Dusty Folio”: An experiment with Aus-
tralian dyes was carried out as far hack as
1803. when Governor King got It. Oontance,
the master of a French schooner from the
Mauritius. .to try what he could make of
the wild indigo plant which grew round
Sydney. Con lancet who had an indigo
plantation at Mauritius, reported that the
plant reacted like indigo at every stage of
tl''> process, . but the only color lie could
get_ out of it was more like amber than
in (I mo. King proposed to see what effect
cultivation would have, but nothing more
seems to have been done about it.
LEANDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Leander swam the waves, but I do more.
He only did what I each day am doing;
His aidor all undamped, he stepped ashore;
I’m in deep water ever with my wooing.
The seas of wet adversity 1 woo
To win your smiles, and whate’er else you’re giv-
ing.
While I can swim, or somehow struggle through,
The game is good, and life is well worth living.
But, sweet, your tastes, to me, seem somewhat dear
For one who tries to live by making verses
And such small products; creditors, I fear,
Because of them heap on me bitter curses.
Still, since to please you pleases, I’ve assailed
Each stormy buffet, heedless of cold water,
By pawning things when hard-earned verse-cash
failed,
And pruning all my needs with ruthless slaughter.
I sometimes wonder do you notice, dear,
My clothes are scant, my boots are mainly upper ?
You did observe 1113' greatcoat is not here;
But did you guess you had it for your supper ?
I lack the things I need, for your delight,
To please your whim, your taste for teas and
laces
And many things. You might have seen, last night,
I had no waistcoat and my pants no braces.
The game must cease, though it was sweet and rare.
Ceasing, ’twill make earth’s garden seem buc
plantless.
I’ve parted now, dear love, with all 1 dare —
I dare not come to do my wooing pantless.

Brig.-Genera'l Grant, just home, is a
nephew of Vic.’s notable old Lands Minister.
James McPherson Grant. In civvies he is
an engineerhe was associated with Paster
and Saddler, the contractors, when they were
building railways in Southern Riverina, but
for some years before the war he was squat-
ting on the Darling Downs. *
Charles Stevens, just back in Adelaide
from war service, has seen more of the
world than most men. He was one of the
amiable enthusiasts who left for Paraguay
in the early ’nineties to found a New Aus-
tralia. After he had learned his lesson
he returned to S-A.., and lias been a good
fruit-growing citizen. Being, too old for
active service, he did his bit in helping to
run the Anzac Buffet in Cairo, and many
Diggers have pleasant recollections of him.
Mclvor, Vic. Secretary of Lands and
Chairman of the Closer Settlement Board,
has had his screw raised to £lOOO a year.
He lost nothing by withdrawing his ap-
plication for the Auditor-Generalship at the
reouest of Lawson. The clinching argument
employed was that £lOOO a year is to be
paid to the unknown Owen Jones. 31, who,
mainly on the recommendation of an Oxford
professor, has been appointed chairman of
the new Forestry Commission.
Captain Duncan Grant, R.A.N., who has
resigned the position of head of the Naval
College at Jervis Bay, and a few days ago
sailed for England, is a nephew of Admiral
Grant, the new first naval member of the
Naval Board. Before taking over at Jervis
Bay Grant was on the staff of the Naval Col-
lege in the Isle of Wight, where one of his
pupils was the present Prince of Wales, who
was then learning how to become an admiral
of the fleet, like his father, Jellicoe and
Beatty. He is spoiled for active service by
extreme deafness.
“Gallery”: A recent addition to the curios
of the Federal Parliamentary library is the
passport which took the indignant Jens Jen-
sen on his long journey to the ear of W. M.
Hughes. There is nothing specially remark-
able about the document, except Hector
Lamond’s attached certificate of character,
testifying that Jens is “a fit and proper
person to receive a passport.” The other in-
formation afforded is almost painfully color-
less. Jensen is given a straight nose,
straight chin, and full face, and is stated
to possess “no special peculiarities;” The
official responsible for that last opinion could
never have spotted the ex-Minister’s boots.
Two of Adelaide University’s vacant pro-
fessorships have now been finalised. Both
go to local students who have made a name
elsewhere after finishing at Adelaide. Brails-
ford Robertson, who takes the chair of
Physiology in succession to his father-in-
law, the late Edward Stirling, gained a
science degree at Adelaide in 1905, and has
since earned high honors in America, hold-
ing professorships in Toronto (Canada) and
California. J. R. Wilton, who is to be Pro-
fessor of Mathematics, is a son of the Adel-
aide Advertiser's Chief-of-Staff. . After
taking his science degree at Adelaide in
1903 he went to Cambridge, and there was
fifth wrangler. Uo has since been a lecturer
at ShefiW 1 and an X-ray expert at . St.
George’s -pital (Lond.), and he brings
back a big name in his special subjects.
“Boomerang” has a large idea :
There are outlets still where public money might
be very profitably employed at no risk whatever, and
with great advantage to the State. All Australia
has to do is to play trumps and make a Govt,
monopoly of the wholesale import trade; also
monopolise the wholesale trade in our own manu-
factures. In this way Australian manufacturers can
get a sure preference over imported goods, which is
necessary for the purpose of keeping our money within
the Commonwealth. Government can in supplying
the retailers get a reasonable commission. The
process should be gradual in order to gain ex-
perience before plunging in up to the neck. Make
a monopoly, say, of the hardware import trade for
a start. Properly managed it would be a golden
egg as good as the Commonwealth Bank, or more
so. The profits might be applied to paying off our
war loans and after that the State loans. In
time we would kill the import goose, but would
continue to get the golden eggs through the com-
mission on the sale of our own wholesale trade with
the retailers. As it is largely the high cost of
imports that make high wages necessary in Aus-
tralia, both prices and wages would naturally fall,
thus allowing Australia to become an exporting
instead of an importing country. Further, the State
could keep its carrying business for its own ships,
and thus foster shipbuilding in Australia. It may
look Utopian, but we simply must get out of old
ruts —or come an almighty smash 1
“Gleniris”: The Argus printed the other
day “a report from Mr. William Perry,”
which was alleged to disclose “the possi-
bilities of poultry-rearing as an industry for
returned soldiers.” Perry, who is a long-
established hen-merchant, stated that in
April of last year he sold 100 chooks to a
customer. In the following 12 months
the birds laid 210 eggs each, and thus earned
£ll6 gross, “leaving a profit over the cost of
feeding [£37 18s. 4d.] of £78.” Perry fur-
ther assessed the end-of-the-season market
value of the stock, for table purposes, at a
minimum of Is. 6d. each, and added this to
the “profit” for the year to show that the
actual return was 17s. per bird, figures
which suggest “that the poultry industry
could be made very successful by the Re-
patriation Department.” Against Perry’scheer-
ful conclusion must be placed the facts (1)
that the original cost of the birds wasn’t
mentioned; (2) that a 200-egg fowl is a rare
animal, and is not usually to be bought for
less than 10s.: (3) that no soldier can go
straight into the market and buy enough
200-egg fowls to start making a regular in-
come; (4) that a good many soldiers have
already started poultry-farming, with dis-
couraging results in most cases. The most
successful fowl-farmer is the man, like
Perry, who raises stud stock and sells it at
handsome prices to egg-hatchers commenc-
ing at the game; and another sort is the
rural producer who grows his own grains
and feeds a mob of fowls as a side-line.
Undoubtedly the best poultry-farm for re-
turned Bilijim is one having 2 doz. nice
Leghorns inside a fox-proof fence, to provide
eggs for the table, and 1 doz. milking cows
on the rest of the ranch to guarantee a
steady income for the family. And in that
case pretty well everything depends on the
location of the ranch.

The Soft, White Light of
Laurel
is a great boon to those who read or write
at night time. Its clear, brilliant light deals
gently with the eyes of both young and old,
and eliminates all risk of eye-strain.
Housewives, too, appreciate Laurel,because
it is economical and makes less work on
lamp day.
The chimneys do not become fogged, and
there is no sediment left in the bowl.
There is no charring of the wicks, therefore
they last longer, and feed freely to the last
thimbleful.
Laurel Kerosene is giving satisfaction in
thousands of homes, and its users are careiu
to order it by name.
They don’t say Kerosene-they ask for
Laurel.
For lighting, heating and cooking, it cannot
be excelled.

As McWhae does not now intend to visit
Europe for some time, the idea of malun„
him Acting Agent-General in London for
several months has apparently been aban-
doned. In any case, it is stated on very good
authority that McWhae is not now in the
funning for the London job, which Peter
Mcßride will probably hold beyond August.
Australian sculptor Harold Parker re ‘
cently exhibited at the London Academy a
marble statuette of
version of the work for which the late
Gallery paid him £lOOO from the Chantrey
Bequest. Parker went to Brisbane with his
parents in 1876 when three years of age,
and was a student at the Art School theic
fmdei Mr. Clark and R. Godfrey Rivers.
He crossed to England m 189 b.
As soon as the vacancy occurred in the
Lawson Ministry by the retirement of Bow-
ser, Donald Mackinuon silenced. commenta-
tors and speculators by . announcing that he
would not touch salaried office. He was
content to assist in soldier settlement as an
lion. Minister without any reward Like
McWhae, who is also doing a full day s
work every day as Acting Munster of
Health without pay, Maclunnon lias an
come large enough for his needs.
Big Stuart Robertson is the novelist of'
the N. S. Whales Labor party. While he
lived at Cobar, nearly 20 years ago, he wrote
and published “A Woman,’ though he was
too shy (it was before lie got into pohtics)
to sign it with liis own name. His only
other effort of the kind, so far as this paper
knows, was a love-story of the back-country,
entitled “Lost,” which ran through Ihe
Navvy while “R.J.S.R.” was editing the
paper for the Railway Workers Union.
Belgium’s new' Consul in Sydney is
Henri Segaert, w r ho set out on his diplo-
matic career in 1904, when he was secre-
tary to the then Belgian Premier. Later he
travelled on commercial missions, through
the Levant, and organised the Belgian Board
of Exchanges with China and Japan, in
ho served with liis national army, but
was afterwards recalled and sent on a mis-
sion to South Africa, and later on as Pro-
curer. du Roi in the Congo. Ihe Belgian
Colonial Star is his, and he is a Knight ot
the Orders of St. Olaf and Nassau.
<l K&yleG” i I don’t want to stait an aigu
ment, but I believe Johnny Burnett, now
buyer at Adelaide markets for the Either
butchering firm, is the champion killer-and-
dresser in the meat industry. Old Bill
Ivither had a great regard for Burnett, and
some years ago put up £lOO for a com-
petition between him and one Meyers, ot
Melbourne. Burnett knocked down and
dressed 11 bullocks in an hour, and the Mel-
bourne man was only three minutes behind.
Former’s feat was the more remarkable wffien
the weights of the competitors are considered,
Burnett scaling about Bst. against his oppo-
nent’s 14st. or so.
Sam Johnson, black tracker, who. died
recently at Longreaeh from pneumonic in-
fluenza, was the chief witness in the Kenniff
case, which gave Queensland something to
talk about for quite a long time. James Ken-
niff (junior) and his brother Paddy wmre
(junior) and his brother Paddy were
“wanted” for liorse-stealing. and Dalke
(station manager) and Constable Doyle, with
Johnson at heel, rode out to read the neces-
sary bit of paper and bring the culprits m.
Johnson alone came back out of the scuffle
that ensued. He told liis story, and the
charred remains and some bones and buttons
in the ashes helped to piece together the
story that hanged Paddy and sent Jim up for
15 years. Sam was supposed to be 52 when
he was called for.
While Governor of Vic., Stanley has had to
do with four Premiers —Watt, Peacock, Bow-
ser and Lawson. He refused a dissolution
to Bowser 16 months ago, but before coming
to a decision —following a precedent set up
by Munro Ferguson—consulted Peacock,
Elmslie, Mackinuon and Lawson as to the
possibility of carrying on with other ad-
visers in a Parliament then only four months
old. Both Stanley and Bowser, the one as a
student and the other as an unsuccessful ex-
perimenter, are now cogitating on the ups
and downs of political life and wondering
whether Tay Pay O’Connor was right when
he said that whichever way the wheel turns
the political career is sure to end in dis-
appointed hopes and baulked ambitions.
When Chomley was Chief Commissioner
of Police in Vic. he regarded with suspicion
the policeman with a spotless sheet. He
classified him as either a do-nothing or a
risk-nothing. One of his yarns extolled the
resource of a chap with a wild past who.
desiring to enter the mounted police, ap-
plied to his mayor for a reference. His
w’shup didn’t like doing it, and didn’t like 1
refusing because the youth’s father was a
somebody. “I’ve already got one from the
member for the district.” lied the applicant.
That settled it. “If it's good enough for
Charlie it’s safe enough for me, ’ argued
the Mayor, and he wrote a glowing letter.
Armed with this the wild one went to the
legislator, who convinced himself with a
similar argument. “And,” said Chomley,
“that voungster became a holy terror to evil-
doers.” No high tariff on bluff is needed by
Australians.
“Wart”: The Tasmanian Act for the pro-
tection of the public’s eye has been in force
about five years, and 'has. been very
beneficial. The Board of Five has two
doctors on it, and the other ex-
aminers are one optometrist and one
doctor. Before the Act was passed, watch-
makers, jewellers, storekeepers and iron-
mongers alii did “testing,” while the country
v\as travelled by a host of quacks whose only
qualifications w r ere a hide of brass and a
hand-bag. One man I knew' had failed as a
w'ild-cat promoter, another as a fried-fash
merchant. Hardly any of them made any
attempt to pass the examination. Some sold
their test-cases, others cleared out and are
now ruining eyes on the mainland. Inci-
dentally, the possession of an American
diploma is no guarantee that a man know r s
his job. A few years ago I received a
circular from “The College of Opticians” in
TLS.A. These people for 20 guineas offered
to provide me with a book of instructions,
a test-case, three dozen frames and lenses and
a beautiful certificate.

‘AUSTRALIA
WAS
THERE"
ON APRIL 25th, 1918, the Hun
was right on the edge of over-
whelming victory. The spearhead of his
great advance was beyond Villers Breton-
neux, threatening Amiens ; our vital
lateral railways were under fire; a wedge
was being thrust between the British and
French; the Channel ports were in dan-
ger. It was probably the most critical
moment of the war. That night Aus-
tralian divisions, advancing in darkness
in a difficult converging movement over
unfamiliar ground, pinched off the Ger-
man spearhead and regained Villers.
When April 26th dawned, Fritz was
reeling back from the Australian punch,
never to advance again in this region.
That night was a definite turning point
in the. future of the Allies, and was a
glorious example once again of our boys’

“L.C.S.”: An efficient substitute for cop-

Eleonora de Cisneros, the gigantic mezzo-

The bridegroom was a Military Medallist,
but his nerve went when he was called on
to respond to the toast of the bride. At last
the parson leaned over and assured him
that it was absolutely necessary to rise and
say something. Bill arose, fidgeted nerv-
ously, unconsciously grasped the back of his
bride’s chair, and blurted out: “F-r-riends —
this thing has —been —thrust—upon—

he collapsed.

Mary, wife of Sir Harold Arthur Burke,
“Norrey King of Arms.” who is a son of the
late J. Bernard Burke, “Ulster King of
Arms,” author of many boohs on the peer-
age. beerage, etc. The lady is the eldest
daughter of the late H. P. Palmer, one time
a partner in Paterson, Ray, Palmer and
Co., predecessors of the present Paterson,
Laing and Bruce firm of wholesale fluff-
men.
The first mining regulation in Australia
was issued in 3804, and ran this way:—
The Governor having been informed that the coal-
mines at Newcastle have been dug by individuals in
the most shameful manner, without having props,
which has occasioned much labor to rentedv the mis-
chiefs occasioned bv those neglects, and from the
necessitv of fixing such restrictions as the local state
of the re settlements requires, the Commandant at
Newcastle is directed not to allow coals to be worked
bv individuals, as the prisoners will be employed at
that labor (under the direction of professional
miners i.
The price of coal was fixed at the pit’s mouth
at 10s. a ton plus 2s. Gd. a ton to maintain
the orphanage at Sydney.
“Gleniris” : One of Melbourne’s big rag-
shops employs a useful sort of spruiker.
There are several lifts and at 3 to 4 o’clock
on bargain-days there is a swarm fight-
ing for admission. The spruiker is retained
to direct the mob into the safest channels.
On a busy day he uses a gag which saves
a deal of scrouging. In the midst of
the turmoil his saccharine voice will be
heard calling attention to the stairway near
by. “I’m only appealing to th’ young ladies
to walk up to th’ first floor,” he urges,
plaintively. “If th’ young ladies will kee-
indly walk up to th’ first floor, everybody
will get there sooner.” Dozens do, too,
rather than admit themselves to be out of
the chicken class.
“M.D.”: Mildura claims that it now leads
Australia, and makes a good bid for the
world’s championship, in primary production
per acre. There are 13,000 acres under irri-
gation at Mildura itself, 6000 at Merbein (a
lot of which is young and producing little
or nothing as yet) and 800 at Curlwaa, on
the N.S.W. side of the river, or less than
20,000 acres altogether. Though a good part
of it is not productive, last year it turned
out over £750.000 worth of raisins, currants
and sultanas, and with fresh fruit and dried
prunes, figs, anr'cots and peaches the total
output was well over £1,000,000. The nor-
mal population is about 8500. There are
plenty of side-lines —olive oil, for instance—■
which might easily be made a lot bigger.
By “The Loafing Statistician”:—
When the 30-hours working week comes to pass
the- community will have a let of time-killing- to do.
There are 168 hours in the week. An average man
may sleep for 56 hours and eat for 10J hours—•
three meals per day and 30 minutes chewing per
meal. Even a slow eater can’t average much more
than that, and people who bolt their food take much
less. That leaves hours to be filled in somehow.
Odd-jobbing for hire wouldn't be permissible, for
that would be trenching on other people’s province.
A man here and there might write poems for the
papers, but regular newspaper work would be barred
by the Pressmen’s Union. Some men might read
books, though study that leads to no remuneration
attracts very few; or touch up the house, of keep
a garden. But gardens are rare in many places
and many men have little taste that way, while
touching up the landlord s house is a thankless job
and too much of it is stealing employment from
some fellow unionist. There isn’t cricket or football
or even two-up every day even if one could pay for
them; and no man wants to do 18 hours’ extra
drinking per week even if the pubs were open after
six. Preaching is a dreary recreation at best, and
like football, it has to be paid for. And the cost
of everything produced in the country will go up if
16 men have to be paid for doing the work now
done by 10, which will be equal to a serious re-
duction of wages. There will be less spare cash to
spend and more time to spend it in. In fact, with
the cost of local production raised from 10s. to 16s.
while there is no corresponding reduction in the cost
af imported goods, some industries may close up,
and then so far as they are concerned there will be
no money to spend. After that it is hard to see
what there will be to do except hold a stop-work
meeting. There are certainly some unwholesome
industries such as rock-chopping in which 30 hours’
work per week is enough for any man, but rock-
chopping- is largely dene by public bodies and paid
for out of loan money, and, anyhow, importers don’t
compete with it. But on the 30 hours’ basis bricks
will be imported, u: 1 s competition is shut out.
And in that case, though brickmakers may be em-
ployed, the price of houses will go up. To put
it shortly, if a man is worth even Is. 3d. per hour
and buys 18 hours, more leisure per week he will
naturally pay 225. 6d. for it. And if he spends 2s. 6d.
in filling in the 18 hours—less than two-penn’orth
of filling per hour —he will be out 255. In some
cases it is hoped that the employer may be made to
pay, but if an employer of 20 men is called on to
buy 360 hours per week, his week of 168 hours
will be pretty crowded. Of' course it is said that
the man who works long hours can’t work as hard
as the man who works short hours : but this isn’t j
question of long v. short hours—it is a question of
short v. shorter; and the statistics on that point
(Woodrow Wilson’s country has: produced a good
many lately.) bring no comfort.

Lauder at the Palace offers Sydney a
great variety show; and as that is some-
thing which Sydney hasn’t had for a long
time, the season should be a success. The
comedian himself is as good as ever so long
as he sticks to his proper business of sing-
ing songs and pattering. But when he re-
fuses the appeals of his paying patrons for
just one more of the old favorites and be-
comes a glowering Presbyterian elder, or a
reciter of very ordinary verses, there is a
crash. Perhaps he has gone so far up the
glen that he can afford to disregard the
usual restraints of good showmanship. Un-
doubtedly he is a very sincere man making
his patriotic appeal with all the force he
can command. But the good siller that
jingles at the door is paid for entertainment.
The old songs—the few selected ones he
chooses to sing each night—are given with
irresistible charm by the quaint little man
who doubles up with silent laughter over
his gnarled stick. The simple, lilting airs
have been heard again and again by every
body; but when he sings them with chuckles
in his throat and eyes, they swing the house.
And the new ones are just as good, except
when he has lapsed into patriotics or tried
to write a song to suit an occasion. That’s
when the.sawdust runs..out. Lauder is great
in the observation and expression of homely
sentiment. His humorous by-play as the
vaiu Scotch soldier waggling his kilt scores
a bull’s-eye. And he surprises his audience
as the leering old sailor who sings, winks
and yarns while he cuts up. his. tobacco.
That masterly bit of characterisation, with
its sly, chuckling song, is well away from
the broader kilted work. In it the Scotch
comedian is barely recognisable in make-up
or voice. As artistic contrast the thing is
invaluable. Most people will want to see
him do it twice.
* * # *
Muriel Window is the other bit of con-
trast. On to the stage, already adorned w.th
a stuffed peacock on a pedestal and a breast-
high settee which conceals the rapid hands
of a dresser, flutters a strong American ac-
cent topped with golden-brown curls. Muriel
is pretty, cheeky, plump, clever, daring and
a rapid changer of wonderful duds. A
chattering song about a “bur-rdies’ bahl”
is tried first, and just holds the attention;
then the singer suddenlv stops talking in
time to music and starts to imitate the
birds’ ballroom quarrel—chirps, whistles,
coos, an indignant pouting and ruffling of
feathers, a sudden scream of profane rage
from the parrot —the song is finished and
the audience delighted. Of course she has
to do the trick again before she slips behind
the breast-high screen, whistles “Lights
out!” (all but the spotlight), and does one
of her quick semi-public changes. But the
bright little Window dims slightly, too, when
it dips into sentiment. The next supporting

turn is supplied by Eddie Montrose, a chunky
little man who calls himself the Broadway
Clown and does extraordinary side-somer-
saults. He was nrobably trained for a ooli-
tjcian. Heather Belle, a thistledowny Scot

puts the house in the proper haggis-and-
swordMance frame of mind. Colin Crane
baritones proudly at great length, and the
Creightons fill the air with twinkling Indian
clubs and tennis racquets and dizzying dex-
terity. Laurie Kennedy and Dorothy Mac-
Bride put in a finished instrumental turn,

“A Message from Mars” will be rubbed
out at Sydney Tivoli on Friday night—to
the relief of Gregan McMahon, who

“The Silent Witness” still keeps Muriel
Starr and Frank Harvey battling with their
emotion and a hardened jhry for the life of
their son; and Sydney Majesty’s audiences
are thrilled at the right moments —Muriel
never fails to cause woman’s spinal cord to
quiver with her famous “You don’t under-
stand /”
Like the ’flu, Wirths’ Circus can’t go on
in Sydney for ever. The big double show
may be seen for the last time on Saturday
night (19th). The mysterious Howard
Bros., thought-readers, extractors of secrets
and diviners of mental undercurrents,
are particularly anxious that W. C.
Grahame (N.S.W. Minister for Agricul-
ture), ex-Minister Beeby (N.S.W.), John
Brown tcoal-mine owner!, and Mrs. Walsh
(nee Pankhurst —wife of T. Walsh, secre-
tary of the Seamen’s Union on strike)
should look in during their turn at the
Hippodrome.
The clever Lee youngsters, Katherine and
Jane, put up a riot of mischief at Sydney
Piccadilly and the Australian under the
title of “Swat the Spy.” They carry the
film on their shoulders; but as the plot is
the tiniest thread and the scenes a succession
of pranks, there isn’t much chance to see
whether they have advanced in their art. Jewel

In “A Tailor-made Man” at Melbourne
Royal Dr. Sonntag, whose ponderous
volume on the proletariat is presumed to
make the world unsafe for autocracy, is
John Bart’s rival in the affections of the
heroine; and it is a sad reflection on the
taste of the dramatist that a shabby Hun
economist, with a postponed haircut and an
explosive manner, should be considered a
probable partner for such a girl. At the
Royal the whole idea is absurd, because the
gulf between them is exaggerated by lan
MacLaren and Lolita Robertson. To marry
Lolita’s beauteous Tanya to the gaunt and
riotous Sabbath of Mr. MacLaren seems
like fastening an orchid to a mangel-wurzel.
Only'the sudden shortage of trams in the
evenings can affect the cash-box at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s. So far as light is con-
cerned, “Going Up” is apparently above the
strike. Kaiser Walsh may declare the night
black elsewhere, but the Firm’s oil-driven
dynamo will serve here.
At Melbourne King’s “De Luxe Annie”

launch Jerome Patrick in the “fragrant

The title of “The Officers’ Mess” at Mel-
bourne Tivoli continues to bear a strong
resemblance to a pun on an embarrassing
situation. When two of the officers in-
terested are Bert Clark and Hugh Steyne
some sort of mix-up seems inevitable.
This week Hoyt’s cinema in Melbourne is
busy with the evolutions of Elsie Ferguson
in “Heart of the Wilds,” a too-Western

mendous backgrounds, and the landscape is
also a feature of Tom Mix’s misdirected

A load like elephants was lifted off many
minds when news came that Hughes had

Adelaide, where men don’t seem to get old
till they are 80, is really worried over losing
a lot of public servants who have just had

enthusiastically farewelled by the Marine

Board, he has long done good work at the
Port. lie was a captain close on GO years;
he was in charge of the Cathay when she
was wrecked in Torres Strait as far back
as 18GG —his only loss, by the way.
It is a sign of the times that Petersburg,
the railway town of S. Aus., between Adel-
aide and Broken Hill, has got tired of the
fancy which suddenly changed its name
when Petrograd did the same. It was
originally called after a good Australian
named Peters, who kept the first store there,
and hardly knows itself' under the new
statutory name “Peterborough.” A local
petition to S.A. Parliament sets out that 00
per cent, of the inhabitants prefer the old
name to the new one which was thrust upon
them, and argue that “burg” is an old
Anglo-Saxon term and as thoroughly British
as “borough.”
In backing up his application for a cer
tificate of fitness to take up land, Edmund
Dawes, of Bunyip (Vic.), told Donald Mac-
kinnon and the other members of the Vic.
Qualifications Committee that he had had
experience on a German farm in Silesia
while a prisoner of war for 17 months. “Have
you a reference from that employer?” a
member of the committee asked jocularly,
“I’d be ashamed to have one,” said Dawes—
‘.‘the methods are miles behind those of Aus-
tralia.” Dawes mentioned that he was paid
3d. a day, but was permitted to kick back
if a civilian employer kicked him. It was
only the military Hun he longed to kick;
and the place where Dawes wanted to kick
him was out of bounds.
The busted Kaiser probably stopped saw-
ing Dutch wood to curse when news reached
him that Hindenburg was claiming all the
discredit due for frightfulness since 1916,
insisting that 'he and not Imperial Bill had
issued the orders from that date on. It may
be an affecting display of faithfulness to an
old and jumpy boss, or just a heartless theft
of limelight. Hindenberg’s pre-war reputa-
tion was that of an impressive village
drunkard who sat still all day and consumed
immense quantities of liquor. He may be
calculating that if he instead of the Ivaiser
is sent into exile it will be the duty of the
Allies to provide him with the means of
drinking himself to death; while if he re-
mains in disarmed Germany he will probably
be forced to get a job as storeman in a
brewery. It isn’t an alluring prospect for
an old blood-and-iron specialist who is used
to having it brought to him on a tray
directly he grunts.
“Baarmutha” knows the stormbird: —
Vance Marshall, the young journalist and author
of a book entitled “Jail from Within,’’ was last
week awarded three months for his share in the
Circular Quay riot—when a mob went down to the
Sonoma to “rescue” Paul Freeman. Marshall, son
of an Australian-born Presbyterian parson, was born
in the early ’nineties at Casino (N.S.W.). He
spent his early years in Sydney, and is a product
of old Fort-street School. While yet a boy he was
working at Vladivostock, and, later, was clerking on
the China coast for the Chinese Engineering Co.
While there he wrote for the North Ch,ina News,
Shanghai Bund and other publications. Then he
crossed to Canada and passed into the United States.
In Chicago he got on the staff of the Tribune.
After a year of it he moved on and saw most of the
States, now working at the smelters in Montana,
now toiling for railway contractors or packing
apples. After a spell on the European side he
returned to America and went down to the Latin-
American Republic of Colombia, where he became
secretary to one of the consuls. He learnt Spanish
there. An instinctive rebel, he returned to Aus-
tralia in 1916, during the first conscription cam-
paign. Naturally he took a hand and helped the
cause of “No” again in the succeeding year. Since
then he has been twice gaoled for speechifying, re-
ceiving four and six months respectively. Now it's
three months. Incidentally, while 27-year-old Vance
has been kicking and serving sentences, his three
brothers have been serving their country—one as a
doctor of medicine, another as a captain in the mili-
tary forces, and the third in a civil capacity.

‘■Cyril “Grumpy” Maude has decided to

brought higher re-
ceipts than the play
whic h Australia
associates with his
name. This means
that Alfred Turner,
who was here with
him, and has been
his business-
manager for over 20
years, will be out
of a job. Turner,
who was actor
before he was
manager, reports
that he got back to
the greasepaint at

where “I played

“0.K.”: Sadler’s Wells Theatre, the
ancient and historic suburban playhouse in
London, which is to be reopened shortly, pro-
poses to experiment with a number of
ancienjt melodramas such as were played at
the Wells nearly a century ago. The mana-
ger mentions “George Barnwell” in par-
ticular; also “Maria Marten, or the Murder
at the Red Barn.” Carefully produced, with
due regard to the costumes and “atmosphere”
of their periods, some of these antiques might
draw the curiosity of the town. George
Coppin had the idea of such revivals last
time he ran Melbourne Royal on his own,
but he _ was then far behind the times in
his riotions of expenditure, and his produc-
tion of “George Barnwell” (written in 1730)
was only a suggestion of what it should have
been. All tbr same, it ran two or three
weeks, and was taken vex-y seriously by some
of Melbourne’s impressionable youth. George
Barnwell was the Hogartian apprentice who
got badly into debt on account of a lydy, and
slew his uncle, with her connivance, in order
to get more cash. The curtain fell on a
gallows where both of them were about to be
hanged, after George had delivered a lot of
moral -discourse, impressive because of its
simplicity. Many a young fellow had wet
eyes at the Royal on the first night of
“George Barnwell.” The drama hit them
unexpectedly. As a curio it was instructive
to everyone who didn’t know that blokes
used to address their donahs by their sur-
names in 1730, without any prefix, and as a
performance it had the advantage of a con-
vincing George Barnwell in young George
Majeroni, then a crude, intelligent beginner.
Reg Wykeham, just back from the war,
has lost no time getting into grease-paint.
J and N. Tait have given him a part in their
new comedy, “Daddies,” which is presently to
be seen at Melbourne King’s.
“Vaudeville Veteran”: Peggy Pryde’s
return to Australia among the war-brides
is one more of those surprising things the
profesli has come to expect of the little
lauy. Peggy Pryde, Marie Lloyd and Vesta
Victoria —what a trio of performers! 1
never heard Peggy deliberately “blue,” but
she could be amazingly “common.” Her
vulgarity, however, invariably had the excuse
of truthful character-
isation. Marie Lloyd
could wrap the “blue”
stuff up wonderfully.
Her “Thing of the
Past” was sung so
that baldheads could
snigger and school-
girls laugh innocently.
Marie had a big heart
and never forgot her
childhood friends of
the East End. Vaude-
ville folk gathered in
crowds at her London
house on Sunday
nights, and I am
afraid many of them
were loafers. When-
ever they needed any-
thing to pawn they
took it from Marie’s.
I met her once super-
intending the hanging
of some very large
pictures. “I’ve got
to have ’em big like
this,” she explained,
goo d-naturedly, “be-
cause they take the
little ones under their
coats.” Her young
sister, Alice, married
one of the Macnaugu-
tons, and when the
latter went to star in
American vaudeville
the new wife was

the bill. Clean, dainty, delightful and
unheralded, she made a bigger hit than her
husband, and became a star in a night.
“M.P.A.”: Dearth, whose concert-platform
methods have been under discussion, _ is
really the Dick Deadeye of the profession.
He rolls on like a deep-sea diver. When he
lurches alongside the piano, as if to heave on
the capstan or something, he has his
audience well bluffed into the idea that
singing is a mere nothing. But “Pax”
should watch him then. He gradually
straightens his back, moves his arms quietly,
and assumes the position with his chest and
tummy that all well-trained singers adopt.
His breathing is right, and if one watches
the tip's of his vest one will very soon see
where Dearth gets the wind for his long and
well-sung phrases. Dearth’s ways and re-
marks, as instanced by “R.S.V.P.” (B.
10/7/’l9), would make him a very suitable
performer in vaudeville. He would not
have the management on tenterhooks, as
Cappelli does —a touch-and-go whether he
gets the bird sometimes. No wonder, as
the tavern-keeper in “Gipsy Lov.e” at Daly’s
Theatre, London, Harry Dearth was a
feature of the show.
“Norbell”: Gregan MacMahon, who makes
a specialty of the egregious Horace Parker
in “Message from Mars,” first played that
part with the original W. F. Hawtrey Co. at
Wanganui (M.L.) in 1901. Herbert Ross,
the_ imported leading man, had gone sight-
seeing up the river, and found he couldn’t
get back in time. MacMahon, who was
playing the small part of the lawyer, stepped
into Horace Parker’s goloshes at the usual
“moment’s notice.” It was an anxious night
for everybody concerned, for the part is about
the longest known, but Mac got through it
creditably. A few months later the show
was in Perth, with Mac as the leading man.
One day he defied lor-’n-order in Hay-street
by refusing to move on, and an outraged
John “took” his name. Mac was duly fined
before Roe, P.M., and of course the papers
gave him an unsolicited ad. That night,
when Horace Parker exclaimed “Splendid
force, the police!” with unconscious venom,
a crowded house gave him three sympathetic
cheers. By the way, The Bulletin
credited W. F. Hawtrey with playing Horace
Parker. Here, at any rate, Hawtrey was the
tramp. Charles Hawtrey was the original
London Parker.
“T. D. Emdee” : Although Allan Wilkie is
the first actor in Australia to appear in
Shaw’s “Mrs. Warren’s Profession,” he is
not the first mummer who has been in Aus-
tralia to do so. Julius Knight was in the
original cast when it was produced by the
Stage Society at the New Lyric, London, in
January, 1902. Julius Supremus was Praed,
whom Shaw describes as “hardly past middle-
age, with something of the artist about him.”
Another who appeared in the piece was
Madge Mclntosh. She played the extra-
ordinary Vivie, daughter of Mrs. Warren and
Lis Dickens has it) of the “Lord Nozoo.”
Madge Mclntosh was probably the plainest
actress who ever made a hit in this country.
Superadded was the fact that she was a poor
make-up. Still, she was the best Camille I
have seen in 40 years, and was an acquisition
to any company. Elizabeth Watson was
another who not only lacked good looks, but
had the failing of making grimaces when
simulating emotion. Her sister Henrietta
was comparatively good-looking, but as an
actress was not in the same street.
According to a letter which The Bul-
letin has received from Australian Tom
Skeyhill’s manager in New York, the “blind
signaller” will return to Australia in April
of next year, and then in January, 1921, he
proceeds to Oxford for the full four-year
course. He has almost half-vision, and, al-
though very near-sighted, can read, and write.
“Will L.” : Lieut. Pat Hanna, artist and
soldier, recently returned from the Front, is
now O.C. “Diggers”—one of the divisional
Pierrot Companies which provided entertain-
ment for the troops in France. The band of
troubadours is touring Maoriland at present,
and gives one of the most original shows
these islands have seen. The irrepressible
Aussie provides a good deal of the humor on
the bill. One scene is of a leave train, with
types of British soldiers entering in charac-
teristic style. Last to come is the Aussie.
A Tommy, looking out of the window, sees
him approach. “Here comes an Aussie! He’s
just passing a tin-hat. Strike me, the
Colonel’s got the wind up!” “What for?”
asks a Canadian. “The Aussie’s .saluted
him!” the Tommy explains. Hanna returns
shortly to the pictorial advertising business
which he left when he enlisted.
When Shakspeare wrote “If you have
tears prepare to shed them now” he was
probably thinking of profiteers.
“Biobox”: The movies have meant more
money to Beaumont Smith than to any other
Australian producer. He has been wisely
economical, and you won’t find many ex-
pensive interiors and elaborate lighting
effects in his well-known “Hayseeds” series.
The air, the park and the bush are free;
even railway stations and politicians with
their own silk hats can be had for the ask-
in". His present effort is a Barry Lupino
picture, with the well-boosted comedian in
familiar stunts.
Digger Ted Scott, the Sentimental Bloke,
who intends to break into the professional
show business presently, had to postpone a
trial for one of the managements last week
and see his doctor instead. The m.o. diag-
nosed it as nervous breakdown, and advised
the entertainer of the A.I.F. to take a
month’s rest and go easy for six months.
“But,” Scott adds threateningly, “it won’t
be that long before I make a start.”
“W.J.M.”: The revival of “The Silver
King” by Allan Wilkie calls to memory an
experience I had with it in India some
30 years ago. In addition to producing the
play I “went on” for the part of the king.
The first night I was very tired after a
strenuous day spent in the theatre, and sent
my native boy for a whisky and soda. He
hadn’t come back with it when I had to go
on in the murder scene in Geoffrey Ware’s
rooms. Waking from the drunken, chloro-
formed sleep and discovering Ware’s dead
body, I was just about to cover it with the
tablecloth when my boy strolled on to the
stage, between me and the cadaver, armed
with a tray and glasses, blankly smiled and
said, “Whisky-soda, Sahib !”
“The Happy Historian”: The opera
“L’Orkcolo” mentioned in a recent Bulletin
was made from a story, “The Cat and the
Cherubim”; but the idea 'of a murderer
placing a corpse in a sitting position to
avoid immediate detection is old and univer-
sal. There are Australian and M.L.
examples. Two men were hanged at Bal-
larat in ’67 for the murder of the manager
of the Smythesdale branch of the Bank of
Australasia; his body they left in a life-
like position in a buggy. And the year
before that the M.L. Burgess-Kelly gang gave
the tip when they strangled surveyor Dobson
and propped him in a sitting attitude against
a tree.
“Chanco” : There was a pathetic feature
at a Melbourne Town Hall concert given bv
the Orphean Choristers. The society was
founded by Horace Harrison, a young man
in the thirties, who came here with the Shef-
field Choir and liked Australia so much that
he remained. Last year he ordered from
London the parts of Elgar’s beautiful un-
accompanied part-song, “Go, Song of Mine.”
The parcel of music arrived a few days after
his death, and last week the song was given
by the choir under its new conductor as an
“In Memoriam” to the dead musician. As
part of the tribute Stanford’s “Peace, Come
BOB GREIG, Associate Director, Tivoli
Circuit.
Away,” was also done. But to the distress
of many friends present the audience, after
the last line—“ Adieu, adieu for evermore” —
burst into applause. Similar bad taste
characterises every performance of “The
Messiah.” Although specially requested not
to applaud, a proportion of the audience in-
variably claps and otherwise shows signs of
satisfaction after the poignant tragedy of
the Passion section.
“L.W.Y.”: The Cheer-up Concert Party
of Adelaide has been touring for nearly two
years, and with one or two exceptions the
original members are still going strong. Dur-
ing the period they have travelled thousands
of miles and given nearly 700 concerts. The
direct net results —over £3OO0 —have gone to
soldiers’ funds. But, according to William
Sowden, president of the Cheer-up Society,
“the committee could not estimate what the
tours had teen worth to the society in other
ways, such as foodstuffs and donations sent
to the Adelaide Hut.” The party consists
of L. W. Yemm (manager . and musical
director), Trooper L. Symons (secretary and
treasurer and one of five brothers who
answered the call), Sam Stanley and Herb
Errington (jugglers), Lieut. Fewster (char-
acter singer), Abe Farrell (dancer) and
Pte. C. Crisph (baritone). The party has
devoted itself very largely to small country
towns; and the difficulties and incon-
veniences of travel obliged it to make itself
an all-male company.
The death of stout Agnes Nicholls was
reported not long after the last visit of the
Quinlan Opera Co.; and if the story of her
decease was contradicted the contradiction
didn’t get much publicity. The gifted lady
was singing recently in “Falstaff,” done by
the Beecham Opera Co., and her colleagues
included many of the old Quinlan performers
—Gladys Anerum, Edith Clegg, Maurice
D’Oisly, Arthur Wynn and others.
“Ike Pagliacci”: The best fake-name I’ve
seen placed on a playbill to make the show
look pretentious was “Mr. Audley Real.”
“Floater”: It was in Randolph-Bedford’s
“Lady of the Pluck-Up,” and the villain was
taking an ethical survey of his intentions
towards the leading lady. “I wonder if I
am acting crook,” he soiiloquised in a deep
baritone. “My Gawd, you are!” came a roar
from aloft.
“Petramos” : St. Peter leaned against the
gate And bade the pallid pressman wait.
Inside the harps began to strum. The press-
man sucked his inky thumb. Then stammered
quite impatiently. “The House is not yet
full, I see. I pray you do not be too hard.
But kindly recognise my card.” St. Peter
scanned the pasteboard o’er. “Kodak?” he
said. “Not on the door!”

As the horses for the G. N. Steeple lined
up at the barrier last Saturday a bookmaker might
safely have laid 9 to 4 against each of them
getting round the course. The proportion of falls
must have been about the highest on record,
although the field was - not overcrowded and the
average quality was good enough. Nor was the
ground very heavy. But the rain that fell over-
night and on the previous day may have made it a
bit greasy, and the pace set by Murrangong worried
some of them under the circs. So the 13 starters
were reduced to four when there were still two
fences to be cleared. Old Mungindi, who went
out a distinct first favorite, met his Waterloo at
the stone wall in front of the lawn, possibly be-
cause he had not been sufficiently familiarised with
it of late. He was running second at the time,
and had accomplished the same treble at a faster
pace when he won the race two years ago. With
the favorite out of the hunt, Murrangong, Vanitor
and Sir Prim were of most importance for the
next mile and a half, Jack Rice and Cobram being
considerably behind, whilst the others were disap-
pearing one by one. Vanitor, the last of the fallcrs,
was tiring off ere he came to grief, and at about the
time when impetuous Murrangong was seen to
have nearly had enough it was also evident that
Sir Prim must win, bar accident. The son of
Sir Tristram had triumphantly settled any doubt
as tt> his stamina for steeplechase purposes, and old
grey Cobram was coming along at the right end of
the journey, in his old style and in spite of being-
outpaced bv the leader. Cobram passed Murran-
gong (who had well earned the third place-money
he was about to get), and his rider kept him going
his hardest when he saw that Sir Prim was being
eased. It was almost a risky thing to ease Sir
Prim with Cobram still sticking to the job, for
hr his old age the grey has improved his pace.
The easy winner passed the post only three-quarters
of a length ahead of Carbine's conspicuously
coated grandson. Murrangong came six or eight
lengths later, and Jack llice as far behind him.
The rest were silenced.
The Doutta Galla Hurdle, run on Steeplechase
day, is regarded as a sort of ■ consolation stakes for
nags that had bad luck in the G. N. Hurdle a week
earlier. Last year the classy Havston won from
t’astolf and Will Comfort. On Saturday the notable
unlucky ones, Tinana and Mount Miltsin, got a
chance to be revenged on the books. Calais, how-
ever, carried most money of the three. Calais
fell early, as it happened, and then Mount Miltsin
was declared by his S’Australian following to be
home and dry. He jumped winsomely, but he
wasn’t home and dry. At the last hurdle Tinana
joined Mount Miltsin and came away as he liked,
leaving the other fellow to dry up. Whereat punters
from Adelaide bemoaned their fate some more and
hoped for a recovery on Doiran, or perhaps the
outsider Ferrignite, in the Steeple. But it was
not a meeting for visiting nags and their devoted
followers.
The old-time glories of the Miller stable were
faintly suggested by the victory of Hubert Miller’s
I’inon in the Footseray Steeplechase. For that mat-
ter Cobram’s effort in the National was a reminder
that his sire, Bundook, carried the late Albert Mil-
ler’s colors on the flat long years ago.
On two occasions in the ’Bo’s the Grand National
Steeple threatened to lose interest for racegoers. In
’Bl and ’B9 the number of starters fell as low as
seven, the winner in the second case being the Mil-
lers’ horse, Eaglet, a hot favorite at the post. Its
stable companion, the incomparable Redleap, had
won the Hurdle Race and would have gone for the
double had his feet not cracked in the meantime.
Three years later Redleap landed the double and
followed it up bv taking the big Steeple at Caul-
field under a record weight. He was a horse. His
feet didn’t permit of the gigantic animal being
properly prepared for the Spring handicaps, other-
wise Redleap, let in at 7st, could have won a
Melbourne Cup.
* * * *
E. Moon, being a Sydney horseman by
adoption (he actually comes from S. Aus.), is
somewhat lightly regarded in Melbourne. They
blame him there for being in too much of a hurry
to win, for rushing his mounts at the jumps, and
for riding in a butchering fashion generally. How-
ever, nothing could have been more discreet than
his handling of Sir Prim. He has been seen at
his best of late on Jack Rice, who is by no means
an easy horse to ride away from Randwick. Moon
only got the ride on Sir Prim by a fluke: S. Reid
was originally booked to pilot the Sir Tristram
gelding, in which case Moon would have steered
Jack Rice.
Only one other horse in the history of the race
has beaten Sir Prim’s time for the G. N. ’chase,
which was 6min. 23sees. The Rajah’s great fencer,
Old Mungindi, did it in 6min. 19Ssecs.

Of the five brothers Gough, well-known
jockeys, one, Dick, went west last week in Sydney.
At one time he was in the lead in his profession
in three States. He came second on Ronda in
Melbourne Cup, and won two Brisbane Cups and
other classic races. He headed the list of winning
jockeys in Brisbane three years in succession.
* * * *
Jumping ability, like other gifts, runs in
families. Thrace, the best hurdler in M.L. at the
present time, is by Poseidon from Cremona; while
Old Mungindi, Australia’s greht ’chaser, is by the
same sire from Gret, a daughter of Cremona, who
is directly descended from imported Manto, the an-
cestress of Trenton, Havoc and other celebrities.

The English liandicappers treat their
champions better than ours do. Poethlyn, who won
the last Grand National, followed that up by taking
the Lancashire Handicap Steeplechase, carrying 12st.
91b. This made his tenth consecutive victory, and
amongst them were such classics as the War National,
the Grand National and the Lancashire Steeplechase.
It would be interesting to see what weight Poethlyn
would have been asked to carry by our handicappers
had he won 10 important races in Australia.

J. McCormack, who has died at Wasleys
(S.A.), was official starter for the Gawler and other
northern racing dubs in the State. McCormack
adopted the old method of a walk-up start and a
dwell at the tapes, and the manner in which he got
his fields away offered a marked contrast to many
of the starts at metropolitan race meetings, where
all kinds of mechanical aids have been tried.

In buying a site at Waterlea to super-
sede the Riverlands course, the Marlborough Racing
Club (M.L.) noted in accordance with local tradition,
which favors bringing racing as close to the towns-
folk as possible. Races were first held in Marl-
borough in 1854, near Renwiektown. As this was
found to be too far away the course was moved
several times, and at last a two-niile course was
laid down about a mile from Blenheim. Later the
clubs amalgamated and moved to Riverlands. The
new course will be still nearer its patrons. The
history of racing in Marlborough revolves about the
name of Henry Redwood, who died not long ago.
He began with the famous Strop, and his sire Sir
Hercules established a line of top-notchers which
included Flora Mclvor and Waimea.

The long-threatened Bill for an Act to
place horse-racing under Government control will
probably appear in the Queensland Assembly next
session. The ostensible aim is “to give the public
more confidence.” The real explanation is that the Q.
clubs, like most R.C.’s, have been too arbitrary in
their disciplinary measures. That and the fact
that the control of racing will mean a big annual
income to the Government coffers.

Rand wick-trainer Kelso has a wonderful
two-vear-old in Milleme, and a lot of people are
wondering what is going to beat him at three.
But no one knows better than Kelso how- much
difference a year makes. Last season he had Peat.
Peat’s time for 51 furlongs at Randwick has never
been beaten on that course. This season the animal
is unsuccessfully struggling on suburban courses,
handicapped at about the minimum.
A couple of maiden two-year-olds likely to
be heard from later on were busy at Canterbury
Park (Sydney") on Saturday—Coble, a
filly trained bv Richard O'Connor for Hunter White,
and a Holdsvvorthv gelding, Fair Value, owned by
P. Marsden. Both were badly served it the barrier.
Yet Coble, who was a couple of lengths back at the
top of the short straight, dead-heated in the first
division; and Fair Value, after being knocked back
last at four furlongs, came again and was only
beaten by a length.
* * * *
“Imp” figures more and more after the
names of winning and placed horses—and even
ponies. At Canterbury Park on Saturday, out of
24 nags placed at the end of the eight races run, 19
were of foreign descent,
The one-time brilliant sprinter Some Boy
took another distance handicap on Saturday—at
Canterbury Park. He missed one a fortnight before
at Moorefield, but on Saturda.y, with 9st. 51b., was
backed down to evens. There was a thrill in it,
though. Urney and apprentice H. Lillyman were
just touched off in the last stride.
NORMAN BROOKES (Vic.),
ex-champion.
Lawford, an English lawn-tennis champion
of over 30 years ago, has earned praise for ad-
mitting that both volleying and service have much
improved since his day. But he does not think that
the driving, especially backhand, is now as good.
London Field draws on Australians for illustration
in both departments. “Fourteen years have elapsed
3inee Mr. Brookes, coming from Australia witti a
service at once new and destructive, first competed
in the championships. A fresh epoch in stroke-
play and tactics was opened in that year; those
with discerning eyes saw the evolution of the game
registered.” As for the old play from the ground,
the new volleying keeps it in check. “Its growtli
is impeded by the methods of the newer school. If
Mr. Lawford had been at Roehampton last week
and seen Mr. Patterson (young enough to be his
grandson) stultify good-length driving by his drop
volleys and short-sliced returns off the ground, he
would have been provided with a further proof of
the game’s progressive tendency.”

The A.I.F. Rugby Union team beat Aus-
tralia (though not half of Australia plays Rugby)
in Sydney on Saturday, by 28-18, chiefly owing to
combination, but in part, strangely enough, to
superior condition. There was plenty of gore about,
but the proceedings, though distinctly rugged, were
devoid of ill-feeling on either side. Sheppard
played a great game for Australia. His tackling
was deadly, and the speedy Suttor repeatedly felt
the force of it. The Manlyite, Mingay, is improving
(his play is somewhat reminiscent of “Pony”
Finley’s), and so is Rankin. Rankin had a lot
more to do than in the previous match, so had
more chance to make mistakes;' yet, with it all,
he stood head and shoulders over Francis. Mayne
worked like a tiger, and was mainly responsible
for the Diggers winning by as small a margin as
they did. But he tends to overdo the “Dally” Mes-
senger business of getting all over the field. The
soldiers are a remarkably level lot, none outstand-
ingly brilliant, but all sound, and it will take
the approaching M.L. Union team all its time to
extend them. Their win over the Maorilanders at
Bradford (Eng.) was considered by many English
writers to be a fluke. But as on that occasion
the A.I.F. forwards admittedly ran right away from
their opponents, it is hard to get at the basis of
the argument.
* * * *
“R.A.”: Thirteen years ago the M.L.
Rugby Union disqualified Te Reinga for life. Last
week, at the request of the Gisborne R.S.A., they
lifted the ban. It seems up to somebody to say
a word for Problem (aged), alias Carmo, Warepa
and Redeem, disoualifled in 1891 for ever. Alive
or dead, he should be past running schlenters now.

__ Balmain demolished Norths (41-8) in
N.S.W. Rugby League round on Saturday, and so
widened still further the sizable gap between them-
selves and the also-rans. In the Easts v. Newtown
game the board showed 15 all at whistle-time. In
the other matches Wests defeated Souths by 18-8,
and Glebe jumped on Annandale by 9-2.
* * * *
England v. Scotland, which is, and is
likely to remain, the world’s biggest Soccer event,
has been re-started. In fact, to make up for lost
time, two matches were played at the beginning of
May. The first was drawn, hut in the return game
at. Glasgow England just got home bv 4 goals to 3.
There was a gate of over 100,000. Mostly they only
naid 6d., so the takings were only £3650. The
hero of the occasion was a new and bustling English
centre-forward; with the inappropriate name of
Puddefoot.
There was nothing to choose, except in
the one important matter of judgment, between the
South Aus. and Vic. teams in the recent football
match. South Aus. lost through an old weakness —
leaving an attack man unguarded just in front of
goal, and this accounted for more than the margin
by which Vie. won, 9.8 to 8.8 Vic.’s back men
showed great judgment, and won them the game.
There was for Adelaide a startling innovation in
the welcome given by that city to the Vic. foot-
ballers. They had the usual drive in the Hills, re-
ception by the Mayor of the city, and good feeding.
But there was also a Sunday-morning entertain-
ment, of music and boxing, at the rooms of the
West Adelaide Club !
The League matches in Melbourne were
ruined at the latter end by a blizzard. ’Wood
beat Souths (59 —36), which leaves Souths and
’Roy at the top of the Premiership list with 2S
each. ’Roy over-ran Carlton (41 —39) and Rich-
mond upended ’Don (51 —46) in a close game which
went on after darkness and the tempest had
descended on the players. Richmond thus occupies
second place in the competition with ’Wood —24
points each.

In the Vice-President’s final at South
Brisbane last week, Green’s rink was leading be
23-8 at the 19th end. The opposing four then
called upon one another for an heroic effort, scored
all the points at the next six ends, and secured a
victory as glorious as it was unexpected by 24-23.
And there are dolts who claim that there is no
excitement about the classic old game!
Cable item (14/7/T9) : “Air-mechanic
J. Bell, an Australian, won the Wimbledon Cup.”
It is like an army to make an air-mechanic of
perhaps its best rifle-shot. Bell was one of the
Melbourne Railways Rifle Club’s crack performers
before he enlisted in the A.I.F.
At Townsville (Q.) last week Browlock.
a local horse, jumped 7ft. 4Jin., which was a
record for the State. The previous best was 2in.
lower.
* * * *
The A.I.F. hit up 551 v. Leicestershire
last week. C. E. Pellew (187), Willis (156 not
out) and Collins (121) were the centurions. The
great hunting county still occasionally plays Poughcr
(who is 54) and C. E. de Trafford (who is 55). It
lost four of its most promising youngsters in the
war.
Fritz Holland and Clabby met for the
fourth time at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night,
and for the fourth time the smiling, curly-haired
Jimmy won. Both are front-rank boxers, alive to
every shift in the game, and they gave a great
exhibition. Holland might have contrived a knock-
out in the early stages of the conflict, when he was
strong; but, that failing, Clabby shaded him for
skill in almost every one of the 20 rounds that the
battle went. The preliminary was a slashing affair
between Tom Reeder and Dan Tierney (welters).
Daniel rushed into the breach at the last moment —
Stone (no relation of Harry) was originally hilled
to meet Reeder —and lived to wish probably that
he had been less eager. He was knocked endways
in the second round bv a right cross, and in the
third had to be saved from utter ruin by the
referee.
* * •* *
Eugene Volaire, the French lightweight,
knocked out Rud Kee at Brisbane Stadium on S-t”r-
-day night. His plan of campaign was to bombard
the Celestial about, the body tut weariness super-
vened, and then hit him on the jaw. The scheme
worked well, Kee passing into Slumberland by the
agency of a right cross during the fourth session.
* * * *
Cabled that Benny Leonard, the great
Yankee lightweight, is leaving the ring worth
£50,000. His record-book age is only 21, which
hardly tallies with the claim that in 1912 (when
he would have been 16) he scored 14 knockouts.
Most of his other' affairs have been “No dc.” In
1914 15 out of the 16 scraps he fought were of
this description. He made his wad speculating in
motor-tyres and is, of course, a Jew.
* * * *
Jack Humphries, whose weight was an-
nounced as 9st. 111 b., but who looked half a stone
heavier, easily beat Kilrain (9st. 91b.) at Sydney
Stadium on Monday night. Humphries has a ser-
viceable right-handed wallop ; and he is as flash as
Kilrain is game. The referee stopped the engage-
ment in the sixth, the lighter man being by that
time in a bad way.

Seven main routes were to be opened in
England on May 1, when civilian flying first be-
came lawful. But it was bad weather, and only
two were found practicable, London-Bristol and
London-Manchester. The latter flight was a real
commercial success, taking 10 passengers, with 6cwt.
of luggage, about 200 miles in four hours, against a
-strong headwind.

Petersham (Sydney), lacrosse premiers,
defeated Manly for the Proud Shield on Saturday by
four to two. A N.S.W. team is to visit Brisbane on
August 9, and a fortnight later the Ma State’s
best will meet Victoria in Sydney.
H. W. Sweeting (South Sydney), winner
of the five-mile cross-country race on Saturday, in
36rnin. 9sec., looks to hoid a mortgage on the
coming N.S.W. novice cross-country championship.
Behind him were such top-notchers as Tom Morris
(Botany), J. W. Cain (East Sydney) and Bob Fitz-
simmons (South Sydney).

At Randwick (Sydney) Rifle Range on
Saturday the champion of champions title was won
by T. Smalley (Penrith) —who, by the way, also
won it last year. His aggregate was 98 (33, 33, 32),
which was creditable considering the wind that
raged. The runners-up were A. D. Carmichael (West-
ern Suburbs) 96, and J. A. Brogan (Police) 95.

• “At a meeting of the Burdekin Turf. Club on
Thursday a horse entered as Limerick, who was
favorite, won the Hurry Scurry. It was subse-
quently discovered that the horse’s name was Left

town a week before. He had been covered with
molasses, and when hosed down turned from a brown
to a bay.” —Brisbane Courier.

As Boils, a chestnut gelding, of the untried maiden
class
(The whole of which, of course, was utter rot) ;
And then, by way of furthering his machinations
snide,
He sent him to a friend to be prepared—and also
dyed.
“They tell me that the Paddock of that peaceful
rustic course
Was stupefied when Boils (so-called) appeared.
His color —well, it wasn’t that of any decent horse.
He gleamed like fire. A greenish hue, as weird
As what you see in drama when the limelight is
applied
Illumined every cranny, hook and crevice of his
hide.
“He won by twenty lengths, or more, and then the
row began:
His ribs were streaks of crude electric blue,
With yellow as a background, and a dash of black-
and-tan
In places where his proper coat shone through.
Old Paralytic’s trainer, in his wish to do things
right,
Had used his wife’s peroxide on the horse the pre-
vious night.
“Of course the Race Club stewards warned all parties
off for life;
Which brings me to the point I wish to make —
In eases of this sort don’t borrow nostrums from the
wife,
Or trust to treacle. Any makeshift fake
Will doom the scheme to failure. Either see the job
is done
On regulation lines, or leave it carefully alone.”

With Health Everything is a
Source of Pleasure
—without it nothing else, whatever it may be, is enjoy-
able. Even the other temporal blessings—a great mind,
a happy temperament—are degraded and dwarfed for want
of it. Everything should be made secondary to health.
There’s no reason why you should not be healthy—
Nature intended you to be so.
The various organs of your body have certain functions
to perform. It is your duty to see that these organs are
not overtaxed or run down, which will prevent them
from properly fulfilling their respective functions. For
instance, constipation, indigestion and other disorders of
the system are the direct result of your internal muscles
being much below normal —failing in their duty.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles
that govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health ? Then
why not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture?
I should like you to have mv Booklet, “HEALTH
AND STRENGTH FROM SELF-CULTURE.” which tells
about my methods, fees, etc. Just write name and
address across this advertisement and send it to me,
with three stamps for postage.
Those desiring to avail themselves of personal tuition,
are invited to call and have a chat with me about then-
needs, when I shall be interested in conducting them over
my modern Institute—the most up-to-date of its kind in
the world.

MOST Horseman experience difficulty
obtaining breeches that are
faultless as to fit. There is so often some minor incor-
rectness in the cutting that renders the garments u'pcom- ,
fbrfable in wear and possibly shortens the period of\
their serviceability. For instance, have not YOU had \
breeches that were just a little too tight at the knee with
the consequence that difficulty was experienced Iwhen
mounting or the stitching gave way just as the strai p was
put on the left knee?
**L.S?* Breeches are cut by men experienced in the production
of Riding Garments —men who know exactly how preeches
must be cut to be completely satisfactory. We quote opr special

1 rom time immemorial rare jewels have ever exercised their fascination and
made appeal to the love of beauty latent in every personality. To-day
Ivhoda u ager strikes the note of perfection in this art of personal adornment.
Out of the mists of antiquity this jewellery gathers a tribute of barbaric
splendor while modern ideals of dignified simplicity and exquisite taste

designed and wrought by hand, so that each piece is del.ghtfully exclusive.
A tribiile by Julian Ashton: —

setting, conspire to place these works on a high plane of artistry.. ”

The big jumps at Flemington are as a

from their winter fastnesses. But strike

were over from Sydney to see their horse
Old Mungindi run and topple over at the

hnmKi S * v i oung “ an >. Aesculapius, spurned the
h'vev of three’s best friend, Thalia,
to the embitterment of the latter. Being
moved to revenge, Thalia presented the kev
of Circe s chambers to Mrs. /Esculapius—
a rotten thmg to do. And behold! the en-
rhged wife came there, in the early hours
of the morning questing for her husband,
who was allegedly out attending to a sick
call - Gut he was onlv attending to Circe
who fled m great disorder and her pyjamas
up the street, and so to the front door of
a certain Guesterie, where she hammered
loudly, demanding admission. The sage
Diodorus, awakened by the uproar, came
down and let her in, and forthwith—proof
nw , sagacity—took her temperature.
k ‘A’p , take the temperature of
beautiful ladies who call at 3 a.in. in their
pyjamas.) D odorus immediate’y diagnosed
an acute attack of whatever distemper was
then current; and, telephoning for a taxi
despatched Circe to the hospital of yEscu-
lapius. And all parties were more or less
satisfied.
Flight-Lieut. Paul McGinness, D.F.C., of
Framiingham, in the Western District, who
returned only the other week from England,
is off again this month to hunt for the Com-
monwealth's £lO,OOO England-to-Australia
prize. Sam McCaughey is financing McGin-
ness's effort, and the airman will be offs'ded
by Flight-Lieut. V. P. Turner and Seigeant
W. A. Beaid.
Lieut. Aubrey Lock, who built one of the
earliest ’plane-engines to push a ’bus in this
country, is home again at Malvern. lie was
with the travelling workshops in France
during the busiest part of the year; and in
those roaring years he lost an eye and gained
a son.
The Digger’s resourcefulness is shared by
his nurse. Overstaying her leave, an Aus-
tralian sister arrived at the Southampton
docks to find her ship had just departed,
leaving her broke, homeless and dudlcss.
When the embarkation-officer tartly to'd her
to repdrt to 11. Q., London, he found him-
self facing a sample of beauty in distress,
lie was used to jibbing donks and rebellious
males, but melodrama was out of his line,
so he was glad to pack tearful sister off on
another boat to Le Havre. At the French
port Red Tape gibbered at her. so the tear
began again until officials became scared
men. She was franked through to Marseilles,
where she picked up the transport. Later on
a very contrite and broken-up woman ap-
peared before the crusty S.M.O. Some tenta-
tive remarks about the penalty for being
A.W.L. were being made when a l'ttle hanky
began to dab at two misty eyes. “Oh, never
nrnd !” muttered the doctor, and got rid of
her at once. “Tlow on eaith d d you
manage it all?” cried the other Nightingales
in chorus a f tervv'”-rl ■ “Oh t fust wept my
way through,” said Sister Sobs.
Me’boume people who knew of his fetch-
ing personality still refer with regret to the
loss of Lieut. George Manders, an Aus-
tral'an who, after serving on Gallipoli, was
killed with the R.F.A. in Mesopotamia.
While st.ll very young Manders’s ability
got him on to the Age reporting staff. Later
he travelled to London and became Geo“ge
Re'd’s secretary. With a fine presence and
voice he was turning his thoughts stage-
wards when the call sounded. Amateur act-
ing and go’f had long been a couple of his
hobbies. The Manders family has been for
years in the leather-bag business in Mel-
bourne.
Ronald Forbes, who hurried off not long
after he had his 18th birthday to get
into British khaki, is coming home this
month Captain Forbes, M.C. His mother
and sister Rtay left the Tcorak house nearly
four years ago to look after the soldier-boy’s
place at Ballan.
The Diggers who returned to Tasmania
early in July got the coldest welcome on
record. Snowballs flew from the crowd on
the wharf, and later served as confetti from
the city windows. The welcome-hoine
motors had to slide through a foot of mush,
and the boys complained that they saw more
snow in one morning than they did during
a French winter. It was the heaviest fall
Slowbart had seen for 34 years.
Mrs. J. 11. Dodds lately took over com-
mand of the Vie. Crbche Association from
Mrs. Alfred Deakin, who was obliged to
resign owing to her
husband’s ill-health.
Mrs. Dodds has con-
centrated half a
Lifetime on the day-
nursery movement.
She has a record of
more than 20 busy
years with the Rich-
mond cr§che, and a
decade of equally
valuable efforts on
kindred organisa-
tion s. Nowadays
the lady is the
official head of nine
creches, with an
annual attendance
(last year ) of
55,000, and she is
always striving to
bring a little more sunl'ght into the lives
of her innumerable family. Also just now
she is battling for a bit more clothing, and
considers that many Susies who have
stopped knitting for soldiers might get the
needle and start again for baby. This pic-
ture of Mrs. Dodds comes from the Bur-
lington Studios.
The energetic Ilennessy knight is busy at
the Investigation: branch at Barracks. lie
has Repatriation-secretary Palmer at his
l ight hand, and all complaints are handed in
to them for preliminary investigation. The
Ilennessy touch is applied at the next stag :,
and by all accounts it promises to be magical.
A good many set out as plain Diggers
and presently became padres and put up a
pip; but Congregational parson Thomas
1 erkms, just home, upended the procedure.
He started to do his war-bit as a chaplain,
and then reckoned he could do more go„d
in the ranks, so joined up us a plain BJI-
- When the armistice was signed he got
back into his chaplaincy.
John Fisken, whose health came to sudden
grief just before Easter, returned to Toorak
from St. Luke s the other week, apparently
much better. The improvement d.dn’t last,
however, and the affable stockman now lies
in a precarious state. Fisken, who has inti-
mate sheep-connections of his own, married
the Widow of the late Dav.d McCaughey, of
Coree.
Everard Browne, who several weeks ago
had a nasty mishap which caused his pais
to shake the moths out of the.r best black
toggery in anticipation of the worst, has
quite recovered. For some time he hovered
on the brink, but at last took a turn for
the better and survived the concussion. He
has been showing his repaired dome in
dur.ng the past week or two.
F. W. Eggleston was heading for the war
as an infantry private when his legal train-
ing was commandeered for the T.dworth
camp. It was not
the front-line job
that the warrior
craved, but it of-
fend a pood and
conscientious lawyer
plenty of oppor-
tunities for patriotic
service. Eggleston
later on received
unsolicited publicity
when he was ap-
po.nted “ expert
adviser to the Prime
M.nister of Aus-
tralia,” and hurried
off to the Peace
Conference in the
train of Robert
Garran. He cer-
tainly had a claim
on a ticket to Paris. Apart from his wis-
dom as an internat.'onal lawyer, , he is one
of the overseas publicists who pour their
thought into the Round Table quarterly.
He is the secretary of the Victorian group,
aid while in London had a seat on the
central council, which includes Lord
Milner and Lord Selborne and Lloyd
George’s political secretary, the brilliant
I’hd:p Carr. The Round Table crowd had
much to do in shaping the British frame-
work for the League of Nations agreement.
One of. the Table’s S’Afriean represent
tatives is Botha’s big lieutenant, General
“Janny” Smuts.
There is to be a big ’Varsity Ball on
August 15 in St. Ivilda Town Hall. The
\ arsity Council is taking the responsibility
?, sea n ~ tone and prestige surround
the affair like a blanket. The State Com-
mandant has allowed it to be gazetted as a
mil’tary ball, as it is by way of being a
monster reception to returned so!d : ers and
sailors who are grads or undergrads.
I eter Power, who was run over by a
tram and atterwards onerated on. seemed
to be recovering but collapsed and died in
a tew hours. He was the son of a former
famous London eye specialist, and came to
the Melbourne Mint about 30 years ago. A
general favorite, much sympathy is felt
for Jus invalid wife, who was a Toorak
W liliamson.

This week has seen the granting 1 of probate in
three well-known estates—F. C. Howard’s at
£23,300, Walter Reynell’s at £28,000, and Dr.
Gilbert Harvey’s at nearly £67,000. The doctor
was a son of the late James Harvey and died in
France in November, 1917.
On Thursday the Governor was well enough to
be at the opening of Parliament, which occurred
with all the pomp and fuss of pre-war daj's. In
the evening Miss liyffin Thomas dined at Govern-
ment House and was given her 0.8. E. for good
work as Red Cross secretary. She would have been
invested during the Jdlieoe visit but for the ’flu.
An Oxford M.A. degree has ccme to the Rev. G.
M. Searcy, a son of lloffe Searcy, of Adelaide.
He left here about two years ago for a billet at
the North Sydney C. of E. Grammar School.
The trouble between the Anglican gaiters and
Canon Wise has advanced a stage, and Josiali
Symon is to appear for the Canon before the
“ecclesiastical tribunal” that is to give final
judgment. The Church advocate will be Clelend,
I\.C.
Dr. Malcolm Scott is to be the University’s new
demonstrator in anatomy. He has had three years’
service with the A.1.F., and was for some time
surgical specialist at the Ist A.G.11. at Rouen.
Surgeon-Major Turner, M.C., is to succeed Dr. West
as medical superintendent of Adelaide Hospital.
The Arnold Daveys’ son returned from England
on Thursday, after four years’ service divided be-
tween the kite-balloon section of the R.F.A. and
the ’planes. His brother, also a flying man, was
killed early in the war.
If the statistics are right, skirts have become far
too numerous in this State. At the end of 1911
there were only 600 more women than men. Now
ihe girls have a majority of 30,000. Even the return
of the sohtiers won’t straighten the balance, for
there are only 10,000 more due in South Aus.
Gone west during the week, the Rev. D. A.
Kerr, once on the staff of Prince Alfred College,
then headmaster of Pultr.ey-street School and of a
school of his own at Glenelg. He had been ill
for some time. His elder son won his M.M. at
Gallipoli.
In spite of ill-lit streets and the dearth of
trams, Dolores has had packed houses for her con-
certs at the Town Hall.
The irony of things! Col. Hal Nowland is back
in Adelaide from the war, after safely running all
the risks attending a surgeon at the Front from
the early days. His brother Clive, also a doctor,
was unable to go—and was killed last y n af in a
motor-cycle accident: near his .own home.
The best-laid plans go' wrong. S. Aus., which
has been hard up for teachers, thought it would be
all right when Bill came home from the war. Now
it finds that Bill is' marrying the girl-teachers—
the engagements have been piling up. for four years
—and the Department is nearly as badly off as
ever. Still, Acting-Director Charlton has hope-;:
there are more students in training for pedagogues
than ever there were before.
Solicitor Arthur Davis’s elder daughter,
Gwyneth, has accepted a diamond half-hoop
from Major Powell, D. 5.0., of Avoca. Twin
sister Beatrice yiarrhd medical Captain
Harvey-Sutton when she and Gwyneth were
war-work.ng in England. The soldier is
hastening back from two years in Egynt to
be introduced to a son. The two ‘Davis
soldier boys are expected home shortly.
The Norton Grimwade pair are waiting
for the confetti storm to blow over. Having
lent, their Toorak house. Ilomeden, to Mrs.
Askiu Foster for the Freddy Grimwade-Jo
h oster wedding, they are sheltering tem-
porarily in a Cliveden flat with the bride-
groom-elect. The Foster twin daughters,
who have been in London for nearly four
years, have hurried back to Australia to be
sister Jo’s bridesmaids.
General Hughes has got another step—he
is now a grandfather. Daughter Erica has
just a coni red a baby girl in London. Pier
husband is a P. and O. officer who passed
into the navy.
The only son of Dr. Pat Deary, of Sand-
ringham, had a great christening recently.
The pampered infant was given the full
string of Scawtch names belonging to rich
grandfather Macßride. But he will be plain
“Mick” when he gets as far as school.
Anthony Lucas, of Greece and the Aus-
tralia cafe, has decided to go ar.d live right
among his best customers. Pie has bought
Whernside. the late Albert Miller’s massive
pile in Albany-road, Toorak’s most distin-
guished thoroughfare. Several woody acres
of land go with the property, and Pmcas
will move in when a new coat of paint has
been applied to the dog-kennel. Not long
since Lucias also bought the late C.-J. Mad-
den’s country property at Frankston. with
the idea of turning the rich, sandy holding
into a lettuce-garden.
Until lately church choirs have generally
been conducted by the organist, frequently a
bald old boy with a crusty disposition and
a predilection for German musical goods.
Now, however, woman, reaching for her
supports, is stepping up into the choir-master’s
job. One of the pioneers of the new order
is Reba Rangan, a Melbourne singer of
some note, who professionally conducts the
anthems for the Congregationalists at Can-
terbury;

VANITY FAIR SILK MILLS
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There is an uneasy feeling abroad that
the Peace junketings are not quite right;
and many well-known people are leaving
town for the week-end. The first sponta-
neous leap of joy at the news that the car-
nage had stopped was understandable. A
round of mechanically worked-up festivities,
culminating on the anniversary of one of the
most blood-stained days in the annals of the
A.1.F., is rather too much like dancing on
the still broken surface of one’s offspring’s
grave. The Rand wick Council has a more
practical method of displaying' its gratifica-
tion. The told the sand-shifting foot-
ballers at Matraville last Saturday that in-
stead of spending money on peace celebra-
tions the Council wap devoting a special vote
of £lOOO to building four soldiers’ homes. It
is not nearly so much fun for the seekers
after State-supplied ‘ amusement, but it is
much more beneficial to the men who did so
much to make Peace possible.
The Dunduln, one of the plain Janes of
our dockyards, lay at her Cockatoo moorings
last week, bedecked with streamers and a
bouquet, smiling the rather bleak_ smile of
the working woman upon the visitors who
had gathered at her christening. The sun
shone, and some good Australian wine was
wasted on her bows to the accompaniment
of Mrs. Holman’s God-speed—and "may all
who sail in her go in confidence, peace and
security under the great flag of the Aus-
tralian nation.”
Then the Dundula sped down the slip-
ways to join the Commonwealth’s fleet
of cargo-carriers. There was a cry of “She
goes!” and a breath of relief. Mrs. Holman
hugged the bouquet that blue-clad Elsie
Bevan had handed her. The G.-G.,4n a silk
tile reminiscent of the grey beavers worn by
the yoUng bloods in the days of Bath, made
his speech. It sounded like a .recitation
learned, by some likeable little chap deter-
mined to surmount a difficulty connected
with the letter “R.” Lady Helen in blue
tailorings, with a touch of gold in her hat,
smiled a benison. More speeches, the first by
11. W. Curchin, the Commonwealth ship-
builder ; then a tense moment when Premier
Holman faced the small crowd of dockyard
workmen. “One, two, three” —till the final
“Out!” came on a full-throated note. The
effect upon the rather sick-lcoking man was
electrical. His back straightened. He
finished his speeph. They counted him out
again. But they had listened, SO the honors
went to Holman.
Afterwards there was tea on the Kiflg-
Salter lawn, where Mrs. King-Salter, in navy
and grey, was suonorted by daughter Peggy,
whose rose topcoat and rose velour hat
brightened a grey landscape. Joe Cook’s
lady wreathed the title in roses and brought
her daughter; arid the Fuller dame wore
furs worthy at least of a baronetcy. Ameri-
can Consul Brittain’s wife walked in navy
ard sqxe blue. The Navy handed round the
cakes.
The Institute of Journalists arranged a
lunch for Charley Bean last week, and then
Mrs. Harrison (Amy Mack she was)
arriving in time with her big soldier-scientist,
husband, the Institute dec’ded to make a
double event of it. The blue ribbon exlrb’ts
were enveloned by politicians and other high-
lights. Preliminary talk by president Tom
Heney and others over, the simplicity of
Bean unfolded its bronze-topped length, and
made an flnejipected p’ea on behalf of the
under-dog—the people of the slums. The:?,
getting into his easy stride, he told once
more of the virtues of the other chap. Of
Conan Doyle he sa ; d: “No"man, except per-
haps Birdwood. ever received such an ovation
from the Diggers. To besin with, he was
Sherlock Holmes to them; afterwards ,he
was the fine, big-hearted chap, simple enough
to tell them -the high opinion he had ’of
them, and they returned the opinion with
compound interest.” Mrs. Harrison, a hand-
ful of cheeriness in a blanket coat, responded
to her toast by telling how glad she was to
be home once more. Mrs. Holman in black
purred over white furs.
Charley Bean, who is off to Canberra for
seven years to write his part of the history
of the great war, yarns about the Australian
nurses. His eye and his bronze top-knot
take on a deeper glow as he tells of their
heroism right from the early days of Gal-
lipoli, when the preparations were totally
inadequate for the heavy rush of wounded.
They won a reputation for efficiency and
capacity for work that made many an oiu-
world surgpon change his ideas about the
hospitals of “down-under.” At Lemnos tne
tragedy of unpreparedness was felt to its
greatest degree. Here they were housed in
tents, and very often their only supplies
were bullv-beef and biscuit. At Salonika
every wounded Tommy made a resolution
to adventure to the land of sunshine and
laughter and the finest women in the world.
Luring the 1916-17 winter in France the
sister swept to the pinnacle of the heroic.
Circumstances didn't give her time to think
about climbing to it: Joan of Arc was faced
with her only serious rival, and Digger, as
Charley llpan says, declared the competi-
tion a'dead heat. At that time the No. 2
Aus. Gen. Hospital was merely a collection
of tents, in each a miserable oil-stove giving
out the only pretence of heat. Here the
women from our warm old continent drew
the tops of sock and stocking above their
ordinary hose in a futile attempt to keep
away frost-bite and chilblain. But they
kept the frost-bite away from their faces —
they were always sunshine for the boys.
Will Dipper forget them? Well, judging
by the good time he gave s-'ster whenever
a London or a Cairo furlough offered him
the chance to show his devotion. Bean ntijy
hopes that his history will live as long in
the memory of Australia.
This is the newest
photo of Mrs. Gib-
son, who will be re-
membered as Eva
Mylctt, golden-hair-
ed and golden-voiced.
Many years have
passed since the
beautiful contralto
voice was taken to
Europe for further
study. Since then
the popular
girl has achieved
success in oratorio,
New York recogni-
tion. a manufactur-
ing husband, arid the
only baby in the
world.
The little Shimizu lady was to have beet)
farewelled by Mrs. Mergentheim at the
Women Painters’ Club last Thursday, but
’flu laid a restraining hand upon her shoulder
at the last moment; so the Consul, in a
miniature morning coat, bowed and smiled
at the complimentary words of Mrs. Holman,
who was the offic al mouthpiece of the
party. Consul Shimizu, as radiant as the
Jananese ensign, replied on behalf of his wife
and himself, and said should they not return
(but they sincerely hoped they would) he and
his wife would be proud to welcome Aus-
tralian friends in any part of the world
where he might be stationed. Then Mrs.
Holman called for three cheers for Madame
and the baby, and after the exchange of
more- polite speech and bows Mr. Shimizji
made his'escape from the atmosphere of fur
and purr. The Cook and Fuller titles were
represented, the first in nigger brown, the
second in violet and sables. Mrs. Holman
wore black tailorings. Mrs. Rix Nicholas, in
black charmeuse and the handsomest white
fox present, came late and brought Mrs.
Nesbitt. Mrs. Mergentheim welcomed and
sped her guests in an irreproachable costume ;
and small groups of women painters dis-
cussed art and their postponed show (it
doesn't take place till November) with great
vigor.
One of the embarrassments of modern
entertaining is to arrange things in such
a way as to keep the divorced, the about-
to-be divorced and the separated apart. Each
social set has a few samples of all varieties
in it, and in the cases of some there is
b'tter partisan feeling. At tjie Wentworth
the other night a sailor, roaming at large
over Sydney’s (to him) uncharted social
seas, insisted on introducing a divorced pair
to one another, and actually completed the
ceremony before he realised there was some-
thing wrong somewhere.
On the sth of this month, at St. James’s
Church, Broughton Richmond, of Singapore,
son of Padre and Mrs. F. Richmond, of
Wollstonecraft, proclaimed himself liable for
the mdlinery bills of Mabel Alford Rae,
only daughter of the John Alford Raes, until
recently of Woodstock station, North
Queensland. The bridegroom’s father, who
tied the knot, 40 years ago shepherded in
the Northern State. South Aus. and N. S.
Wales have also known him as a pilot
of souls. Uncle E. B. Wareham, of the
Adelaide S. S. Co., gave niece Mabel away,
while bridesmaids Elsie Wareham and
Dorothy Richmond entered no protest. The
bridegroom’s gift to his bride was a fine
t’ara of black and white pearls. The
Carlton saw the wedding feast. An uncle
of the br'de, J. G. Macdonald, was one of
Queensland’s first magistrates.
The Freddie Shipmans are back at ikeir
old Sydney haunt, the Australia, full of
tlieir doings and success in "the East.” Mrs.
Shipman, sparkling as of old, says she and
Freddie are beginning to regard themselves
as a matrimonial agency. Every company
they take away boasts at least one engage-
ment at the end of the tour. This time it
is Vera l’assmore, of the b autiful contralto
voice, who comes back with a half-hoop
from J. V. AVatkins. a lawyer of Calcutta.
The difficulty of travelling was brought
home with a bang to the little lady, who had
crossed to America, when she tr.ed to join
her husband in India. Ordinary passenger
boats were out of the question, so Mrs.
Shipman and a girl chum got a lift on a
cargo vessel.
Harry Plimmer and Albert Gran report
all well from America. Margaret Linden
is topping the score in Vampire parts. She
will be remembered as the Madame X of
Pert Hoyle’s co. in Maorilaud, who on the
first night startled the audience by wearing
the same pair of silk stockings—a remark-
able pair at that—through the vicissitudes
of 30 years. Another friend, little Florence
Scapini, the violinist who played during the
Dufault season, is studying with Leopold
Auer, the brilliant Russian master, one of
whose pupils is Mischa Elman. Paul
Imfault expects to open with his old manager
in “the East” in October. Never had
concert-singer such a riotous success in
Shanghai as the well-groomrd French-
C’anndinn ; his audiences took to him as to
a new iced drink.
The cable about the theft of Mrs. W. K.
Darcy's diamonds from Claridge’s Hotel in
London will interest a line of Australian
connections. The slender, good-looking
widow of the late Mt. Morganaire was
s’ster to Dion Boueicault. Her first adven-
ture in matrimony was under the name of
Nutting. Later she married Darcy, who.
among other gifts, bought for her the
Countess of Dudley’s town -residence and
some of the Countess’s jewels—probably
these are the stolen gems. Among tue
treasures the Darey money brought from
the Dudley safe *vas a tiara so heavy that
it was a good load for a woman’s two
hands.
W. Iv. Darcy was one of the few men in
the wbr’d who owned a private racecourse-
stand. His was at Epsom, and was in great
demand on Derby and Oaks Days.
May Moore fixes the glad-to-be-back smile
of Mrs. Lancelot Harrison —formerly Amy
Mack —clever Sydney writer in pre-war days.
While her husband was helping in Mesopo-
tamia, Mrs. Harrison was on Welfare pro-
paganda, and it was an important part of
winning the war to
preach the gospel of
the stiff upper-lip
to a people who
were getting it in
the neck so badly.
Mrs. Harrison was
lucky enough to
secure, a flat in
Mayfair during her
labors at Whitehall.
Of the ducal houses
of Westminster and
Buccleuch, where her
work also took her,
her memories are of
shabby furnishings
and dark, narrow
staircases. In strik-
ing contrast was
Norfolk House, with
its beautiful appointments, its wonderful old
staircase, and its old masters in art
and literature which the owners had
left in their places. Mary and Mother-Queen
Alexandra were charming to the Australian
when she met them during the 1917 Welfare
Exhibition in connection with the Ministry
of Munitions. Dorothea Proud, of South
Aus., was doing great work for the same
department. Hall Caine, with his long hair
and longer talk: H. G. Wells, as explosive
as any of the shells; and Annie S. Swan lent
color to the day’s work by their frequent
visits. Old-frierd Lady Poore had another
book ready for the press when Mrs. Harrison
turned her back on the shocking price of
things in England ; and Lady Denman was
in the forefront of the open-the-lands move-
ment.
Notice that the Prince of Wales has been
handing out his autograph among the
Diggers? Here you are—you can all have
it:—
■
Ex-Agent-General Coghlan and his wife
are back in Sydney and are staying at the
Austialia. How long their visit will last
is not settled yet. If it rests with Aus-
tralia’s great statist, Sydney will be home
till the end. But in 14 years the girls have
made their friends in London; and that
may mean something else.
New Belgian Consul Henri Segaert was
a popular man aboard the Osterley on the
trip across. He has written a book on the
Congo, and is also something of a poet.
His wife is described as charming, and
little-girl Sophie and the two boys were
among the joys of the ship.
Because the new memorial playing field
at Northbridge must be paid for, the Old
Boys of North Shore C. of E. Grammar
School are to jazz with the girls they like
best in Sydney Town Hall on Julv 25. The
half-guinea tickets are to be had at Paling’s
and the Australia.
The Mayor will give a big official Peace
d'nner on Saturday. The G.-G., the Stale
Governor and all the world without his
wife will be there.
Captain Duncan Mclntyre, a brother-in-
law of Mrs. Harry Peters, w.'fe of the news-
editor of the D.T., is in Sydney. He has
received a cable saying that his son, who
is only 19 and a daring aviator, has won the
Flying Cross.
Captain Dumaresq will be At Home
aboard the flagship on Saturday. He has
received a cable announcing the birth of
another child to add to his quiverful. The
little Dumaresqs will leave for Sydney
shortly with their mother. •
The Jack Playfairs are home. She was
pretty Madge Hardy, who crowned her war-
work by immolating herself in the “Cupid
Camouflaged” movie.
Mrs. Will Smith, wife of the Commis-
sioner of Lands and Director of Works at,
Port Moresby, is in Sydney, where she has
come to place her little daughter in Lewis-
ham Hospital. An item from the land of
the cocoanut is that Beatrice Grimshaw has
sold her plantation and is busy preparing a
new cottage where her brother is about to
welcome an English brid'e.
An interesting exhibit at the Women
Painters’ show will be a painting by Mrs.
Mackey, who was Constance Jenkins, of
Melbourne. In 1908 the Victorian artist won
the Australian National Travelling Scholar-
ship ; she was the second woman to land
this coveted prize. (By the way, Lambert
got the only pne given here, and Wolinski
ran him a close second.) During the inter-
vening 11 years Mrs. Mackey has studied in
Italy, France and London, and has had her
work shown at the greatest salons of the
Old World. She also showed at the Panama
Pacific International Exhibition.
Lieut. Seppy Alison, of the Guards, was
married a few weeks ago to Miss Rita Rose-,
daughter of an English colonel. The young
man is the only son of James Alison, of
Sydney and Queensland; but he would be
well off, anyhow. His mother was the eldest
daughter of Sydney Burdekin. Young Alison
was working for an Army examination when
the war began, and he got to France in
time for the tail-end of the great retreat.
He was taken prisoner within a few hours
of arriving in the line, and spent the re-
mainder of the war in a Boche prison-camp.
One of the cloud of pretty girls who have
just “come out” is Betty, only child of the
Nevill Dangars. She is tall and dark and
very much after the style of her father’s
sisters, generally. Another remarkably
pretty girl of a quite different type is her
first cousin, Helen Laidley, who is slim and
fair and the owner of a fine complexion and
wonderful hair. Their mothers are sisters
and caused a notable stir by reason of their
good looks when they first appeared on the
social horizon.
After nearly five years in the blue uni-
form of France, Corporal, Henri Boggio re-
turned to his North Shore home last week.
When the bugle- sounded he was growing
sheep in Bananaland, and answered the call
at once. For two years he served with the
French, was then transferred to interpret
for the 8.E.F., and late- did similar work
for the Canadians. At Yimy Ridge he won
our Military Medal, and later his own Croix
de Guerre, with star, which indicates that
the- decoration was acquired while on
brigade work. One wound is the other
souvenir brought home, and that w T as issued
just before the armistice.
Died at Waverley, at the age of. 83,
William Smyth, who was for many years
Chief Tide Surveyor in the Customs. Death
was busy in the Smyth family that week.
First went Mrs. Smyth as the result of a
chill, then the second daughter, who was
carried off by pneumonia. The shock was
too great for the old man, and he died a
couple of days later.
There’s a story going round that a man
of great wealth having taken to himself a
wife of youth, the demure little thing is
blushing over the undressed female adorn-
ing the walls of the family mansion. So
shocked was she that on the night of her
return from the honeymoon all the painted
ladies in the nuptial chamber ran the risk
of permanent catarrh bv having their little
noses flattened against the new plaster.

Beauty Allied with Giant Strength
GREAT beauty, suck as that materialised in the graceful lines
of Studebakers, is, for itself, one of the most desirable
features in a car. Titanic strength, such as that produced
by the Studebaker engine, is a servant whose power is measured
practically only by the will. Beauty and strength are usually
contrasted. But in Studebakers you meet them united for the
gratification and service of the owner.
Convenience is present, also, to the
fullest. All external parts of the engine
are placed within easy reach. The
internal parts are arranged with the
same helpful regard. The Studehakep
saves time hy saving trouble.
The balanced distribution of weight;
the absence of vibration and the
luxurious cradling of the long, under-
slung springs mean more than riding
comfort alone. They produce a
wonderful tyre-saving that makes for
definite economy.
STUDEBAKER SPECIAL FEATURES : The famous Silent L Head Engine;
the newly-designed Gear Box, swung on a Sub-Chassis amidships ; the Double

A Thoroughbred
Saddle.
The“LONGREACH”
for Comfort.
All our ideas of a comfortable saddle, giv-
ing at the same time long wear and security
to the rider, are embodied in this latest
saddle of ours. It is made on our high-class
“Fouright” tree with steel stirrup bars. The
flaps and skirts are combined in one piece and
seamed direct on to the seat, giving a very
narrow and non-chafing grip. The pads are
set very high up and give a grip along the
rider’s thighs. It has wide leather points to
the panel extending beyond the flaps—a little
point that will appeal to the bushman. The
leather used throughout is nice flexible kip
leather, and the color is a nearly-old color
that only needs a few rides to bring it to the
color most men like. The fittings are bevelled
stirrup-leathers, folded girth and solid nickel
stirrups.

Plain B.: If you want to make sure of a
.sub-editor’s curses' you’ll go on cramming your
lines so close together that a pen can't poke in
between T. L. Tow: But that wasn’t as bad as
the case ot the other probably mythical journal
which on making a correction and apology described
the warrior as “bottle-scarred” Wanderer:
Thanks; but hardly enough interest. Glad to hear
from you again.... Exile: Right; obliged. .. .John
A. L.: Don’t know how many times we’ve printed
the same protest V. Bryant: Thanks K. H.
McW.: “The Wattle” is returned... .Old Jack:
Dymock’s, Sydney, would get it for you J.0.C.:
Not nearly good enough Righto: Come in here: —
“I do not like these writing men”—
The mild mechanic shook his head—
“ And if to live you drive a pen
You’ll have to pay my money when
The goods are landed in your shed,
Or else the job is off,” he said.
“I once did work for one like you.
He edited a paper here.
I had to make him, sound and new,
Three solid mission chairs, and two
Verandah seats. 1 was not dear
He’s owed me for them now a year.
“I sent him word the other day,
Demanding back goods specified.
He answered me in such a way
I think his wits have gone astray.
‘We can’t return the things we’ve shied—
You Should keep copies,’ he replied.”
.... Bonehead: Fifteen times too 10ng.... J.0.D.:
The kangaroo can’t “stalk from his lair” here
M.P.C.: N0....Mem0: Pretentious commonplace.
M.C. (Mt. G.): Nothing interesting in “Mac”;

somewhere about it.... Bottlenglass: Too crude....
Enciem: Lacks interest.... T. J.R.: Try to strike a
new note....R.G. (Casino): The metre kills it....
L.8.D.: Nothing in it; and very lumpy.... Oug-

of bad rhymes and lumpy scansion. .. .Willow: Good
enough of its sort; but there is very little market

careless and bad as the writing; and that’s saying
something. .. .Harrison: Not nearly... .E.J.G.: No.
J.R. (Abbotsford): Verses nowhere near....
98 point 2: Sorry it doesn’t strike us E.L.R.:
Built up of commonplace, print-worn phrases....
A. 8.5.: Sonnet won’t d 0... .W.J.8.: Weak and arti-
ficial E.J.L.: Not enough in either yarn or
c010r... .E.C.F.: Very small tale long drawn out.
L.K. (S.A.): Not quite Cynic: Well written,
but impossible R.S.Y.S.: The poor pro. should
lament in better scansion. .. .R.E.F.H.: “Memory”
says hardly anything... .The Heretic: Why not take
the trouble to say it well?. ... J.A.W.: Yes, it fills
us with sadness: —•
A school-kid darting out from school
(“Fed up” with Euclid hoary),
Didst headlong ) usheth in a dray,
Awhere-in —goes the story,
A “squatter” and 1 is “man” who met
A doom both grim and gory !
. ...E.J.H.-: “Fourth of July” falls flat.... Francis
Foxtrot: You don’t foxtrot. You just b01t....
The Jackall: Poor verse and tangled thought....
Alan B.: Say less and mean more... .H.P.W.: Un-
usual, but doesn't grip any where.... Oliver B.: The
“Battle of Jutland” does it:—
Oh, may this battle never be forgot,
That punished the German fleet;
Who thought to put us in a knot,
Only to find that they were fairly beat.
Oh, may we think of the day which was fought
in May,
» And long live Admiral Jellicoe;
They who thought had it their own way,
Only to find they were far below.
....Tom Jones: No mirth there.... Dorrid W.: Less
likeable verses than “The Return” have been
printed. Keep going... .A.H.: “Looking at the
map of Australia one is struck by its appearance—
resembling a cocoanut without the nut.” Original;

A musical wonder —
The NEW EDISON.
Since the completion of his wonderful instrument—The NEW
EDISON—Mr. Edison has constantly invited world-famed artists
to sing and play in direct comparison'with his re-creation of their
work. Many of the great musical critics of the day have been
present on these occasions, and have freely admitted in their own
newspapers that they could not distinguish the living voice from
Mr. Edison’s Re-creation of it.
No talking-machine manufacturer dare make such a ruthless test
as this—the NEW EDISON being the only instrument in the
world capable of Re-t reation —-without a flaw or loss of an
. overtone.
Think what it would U to have this instrument in your home!
Write at once for full particulars, post free, if unable to call for a
demonstration.

If You Have a Bad Leg
This will Interest You.
You cannot afford to take chances with a bad leg. If you have a sore on the leg, whether
it be an old one which has been troubling you for many months or years, or whether it is one
of only recent date, which refuses to heal, you should give it prompt and careful attention.
ħ
It is particularly in the treat-
ment of severe sores of this kind
that Rexona has been used with
such success.
The letter below was entirely
unsolicited, and was written to
us by Mrs. Hutchings, Main Road,
Woonona, South Coast, N.S.AV.
Read what Mrs. Hutchings says:
“I am writing to you
expressing how grateful
I am to Rexonai Oint-
ment. I had read so
much about the ciures it
has effected that I felt it
was my duty to try it. I
had iiad a bad leg for
eight years, and had been
under several doctors to
no effect, and after six
weeks’ treatment with
Rexona I was perfectly
cured, and that is two
years ago. I always Keep
a tin of Rexona in the
house. 1 am writing
this for you to make
whatever use you like of
it. I am sending, you a
photo of myself to pub-
lish.
“Yours sincerely,
Mrs. TJUTCIUNGS (. Jrom a photo.).
"(Sgd.) MRS. HUTCHIINGS.”
DON’T NEGLECT A BAD LEG.
TRY THE REXONA TREATMENT.
Try the Rexona treatment If you have a bad leg, and note the result. First
carefully wash the sore with warm water and Rexona Soap, then apply Rexona
gently over the sore, binding with a soft cloth. Repeat this treatment night and
morning. If the sore is an old one, a course of Laxo-Tonic Pills taken at the same
time is of the greatest help In producing prompt results. No one with a bad leg
can afford not to give the Rexona treatment a trial. The price of Rexona is 1/6. or
large pots, holding nearly four times the quantity of the 1/6 size, which are sold
at 3/- *?exona Soap Is l/- per tablet, and Laxo-Tonic Pills are sold in two-
size quantities at 1/- and 2/-

The Rover’s Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
a cloud in the sky gives warn-
\ ing—
-1 Brave the vision of hollow and
height,
Dewy jewels the grass adorning!
Trouble scouting and sadness scorning,
What’s to do on this splendid morning
Rich with the wine of all delight?
Take the way that the wind is blowing,
Roving folk and a roving wind ;
Gold forgetting and gain foregoing,
Nought but the joy of the wild-heart know-
ing,
Feeling the blood-fires flaming, glowing—
One with the wind-sprite, body and mind.
Why toil on through the years forever
Wearing chains that are ill to wear,
Making life but a long endeavor,
Fainting, fearing and resting never,
Vain and foolish or wise and clever,
Caught like flies in the web of care?
He who mates with the wind must hurry,
Staying never to look behind.
Pausing never to court or curry
Fortune’s favor weighed down with worry;
Helter-skelter and hurry-scurry—
That’s the way of the rover’s wind!
Now in the tree-tops piping, dancing,
Now at play with the laughing flowers,
Now as a fairy host advancing.
Heard but seen not, the sunrays glancing
Round about them, their horses prancing.
Goes the wind through the wine-sweet
hours.
Brushing the dews from the cool, green
mosses.
Velvet verdure or valley and hill :
Tossinsr the wheat as the sea-wind tosses
Lnke-like waters that no keel crosses.
When the day dies out, with its gains and
losses.
Hither and thither it speeds at will.
Roving n ”d roaming the great, green spaces,
Counting never the march of days,
Treading the looms where the rope-vine
laces
Trunk to trunk, it r ? ots and races.
Guest of the things of the hidden places,
Secret fountains and twilight ways.
Sportive and reckless singing and sighing,
Harp-strains weaving from trees and reeds,
Strength with the strength of the tall trees
trying,
H ; gh on its wings the torn leaves flying,
Oft as a. hunter’s hound-pack crying.
Wild with the music of earth it speeds.
Gathering sweets that the flowers deliver,
Bearing odors of apple and rose,
Scattering health like a generous giver,
Setting the grey grass-stems a-quiver,
Cooling its ardors in pool and river,
Rollicking over the land it goes.
Trouble forgetting and gain forsaking,
Casting care with its web behind ;
Up with the birds when the dawn is breaking,
Earth and the earth’s wood-folk awaking,
Take the way that the wind is taking,
Yield your will to the rover’s wind !

WALTER ROSSITTER left Kundi
Kundi station for a half-holiday-
kaif-busmess journey to Sydney
and an examination of Giigai
Plains, tlxe Darling River station he had
managed 20 years before. He packed up, at
Sydney, by earlier arrangement, his friend
Judson, and together they entrained for
Bourke, and found there a station buggy and
four dorses for the long drive down-river to
Gilgai Plains.
“I’m a bit excited at coming back to
Gilgai, Juddy,” said Walter Rossitter.
“Get over, you big brown horse!”
“How long since you were manager
here?”
“Twenty years, nearly, Jud. I was only
about 25 when I left it. Pretty young, they
said, I was to manage a station that size;
not much more than a jackeioo. But I got
past with it all right. .1 had a lot of good
niggers on Gilgai. I s’pose they’re nearly
aJi dead. They don’t last long with us.”
“I expect they’ve forgotten you, Walter?”
“Not much —they were nearly all pretty-
fond of me. Watts wrote me that he told
all the old bucks and lubras I was coming
back, and he says they’ll all be camped
around the station when we arrive.”
"They've got longer memories than I
thought.”
“No fear! A black man is just like a
white man—he remembers his friends longer
than he does his enemies. Quite natural.
Which do you remember best —your losses
or the times you won? The days you had a
liver or the days you were hanniest on?”
Judson got down and opened a gate where
no gate had been in Rossitter's time: and
Judson got up again, and the team drew the
buggy swiftly through the saltbush. Every
turn in the - track awoke Rossitter's
memories: a colony of crows in a great
grey gum ; a brace of emu trotting clumsily
off the track and southward: a few bus-
tards. with wings half-trailing, running
through the saltbush until they had suffi-
cient way to carry them into the air: and
the dust rislnc and hanging in the sunrays
as it seems to do only in the clear, . till, dry
air of Riverina.
And then came the station buildings:
“Government House,” of white stone, and a
gracious garden that was a fitting frame for
a palace; and, a mile ahead and by the
river, the shearing-shed and pens, the wool-
shed and the men’s huts.
Watts, the manager of Gilgai Plains, wel-
comed Rossitter; and aftpr dinner they sat
on the wide stone verandah and talked of
Rossitter's old days on Gilgai until long
after nrdnigbt.
“All y-our old nigs came in.” said Watts.
“At least all the old lot that are alive.
BaprPcoof’s with them.”
“Old Bandmoot? Why, he was close-nn
an old man when I left. Is General Jack-
son with ’em?”
“No—dead. Did you know George
Reid?”
“The big fat buck from Terry walka?
Yes! They called him George Reid because
he made ’em all laugh at the qo roborees.
He and Lord Jersey—is he dead, Watts?”
“No fear; alive and k.ckmg! Dye re-
member that big young gin they called LiLv
Langtry ?”
“Yes, I saved her from a waddying from
another gin once. What about her?”
“She left the bush; had a year here with
Kendrick’s missus. I followed Kendrick
here, and sue wouldn’t go back to the
blacks’ camp again. She’s an A 1 laundress;
starches all my collars stiff, and it’s no good
telling her I hate starch in collars, shirts or
peonle. Why, she starched the shirt-tails
once, and I was in a hurry • and didn't
notice it till I’d been in the saddle an hour
or more—good luck to Lily!”
“There was a buck name of Monkey. What
did they call his gin?—yes, Kitty.”
“They’ve been out at the Thirty Mile
gums for years. They’ve come in to see you
with the others.”
“Go on ! Well, I’d like to see those two.
I remember them better than most of the
others; for a good reason, too.”
“Well?”
“It’s about 20 years ago, just before I
left, that Lily Langtry came to Government
House to tell me Kitty was going to have a
baby close-up and that she'd said openly
she’d kill it at birth.”
“Cold-blooded devil! What for?”
“I went down to ask. I was going out
on the run for a fortnight or so. and
thought she might kill the child while I was
away. Lily Langtry—rone of the best ef
them —told me that Kitty was determined
to kill the baby; so the morning I was leav-
ing to go out back I went down to the
camp. Kitty had a comfortable enough
hut. but she wouldn’t live in it; she and
Monkey camped outside of it under a
few sheets of bark and o’d bags. Kitty
wasn't much to look, at, but Monkey was
the limit: —the Ugliest man I've ever seen,
and I’ve seen an ugly lot in my time.
Kitty was lying on her b'ankets on the best
side of the wurly; Monkey, with his head
out in the sun, was making faces at the
light—too lazy to move his head into the
dhade. I wanted to take Kitty easy, so I
said. ‘Kitty, why you no go inside hut, more
better a'onga little baby? When you been
catchem ?’
“ ‘ Ryembye catchem.’ said Kitty. ‘Then
I killem; no been wantem hut.’
“That made me wild, and I said, feeling
hot, ‘S’pose you been killem baby I beatem
you longa wadd.v!’ That scared her a bit,
but she said (very sulky, too, she was),
‘Why no been killem sposen no been
wantem?’
“Monkev looked as sulky as she was, and
he says. ‘That one Kitty been thinkem that
one baby been too much cry,’ and I saw he
was lying. I stuck to them, and cross-
examined ’em both until I got the truth.
Some old medicine-man down river told
them that somebody up river had pointed a
bone at Kitty; and that the bhbv, if it were
allowed to live, would grow up to kill plenty
feller. I asked them how long ago the
med'eine-man had told them that, and they
said plenty moon ago. So I sa’d. ‘You bad one,
Kitty; you been think along that one plenty
moon, then. baby been thinkem that one
too!’ But it was no good arguing. Kitty
said, ‘Snosen that one baby no been hearem,
how that one know when I been thinkem?’
You can’t answer that, so I finished with
saying. ‘Spose you killem baby when I been
out a longa run, I beat you two-feller longa
weddv: then I takem you alonga gaol.
Byembve pleesrran been hangem you lonea
rone longa neck!’ I put the fear of God
into Monkev. though, and it looked safe
enough to leave them. When I came
Kitty’s baby was born and A boy.
They were too frightened to kill him.”
. “So that’s the history of Tigersnake, is
it?” said Watts.
“Tigersnake they call him? What’s he
like?”
“He’s not as ugly as Monkey, but he’s
twice as bad-looking. In fact, h's eye
slants, and he’s got that rotten folded-in
upper lip, and shows all the eye-white of a
baulky horse. But you couldn’t call him re-
pulsive. He’s well conducted, but sulky. A
gloomy, inoffensive chap. About 20 he
looks.”
“That’s about his age. Got a gin?”
“No. A bit on the superior end for the
blacks’ camp. Can read and write; learned
it at a mission. Lives in a hut; a good
stockman; always clean; a b’t of a bush
dandy, with a weakness for red silk hand-
kerchiefs and flash pipes.”
“Then he doesn’t live with Kitty and
Monkey?. They’re incurable walkabouts.”
“No —lives here. They came 30 miles
from dowm-river to see you. Thev haven’t
seen Tigersnake since he was about 10 or
12- He d'dn’t seem to want to see ’em,
either. Well, you’ll meet the lot to-morrow.
Time to turn in. I think.”
The night wind softened in its passage
across, the plains: they slept the sleep of
open-air men. ard awoke to a dawn that
looked and tasted like the golden wines of
Hunter River.
A little after daybreak Ro-ssitrer met all
of his old blacks left alive—Bandicoot grey
and reverend, silent, but genially surfing
and running his hands light!v over Ros-
s’tter’s clothing to make up for the fact
that his affect’o.n. was without words. Then,

TEDIOUS HOURS

Tells a Story."

Through all the tedious hours ot a woman’s day the
symptoms of disease are sometimes present.
And often women think it is their natural lot to suffer in
the way they do —that every woman’s duty is to struggle on
—to think only of her family and her housework—and that
her weakness is the penalty of sex.
This is the great mistake so many women make.
It is not natural, and it is not necessary that women
should be always ailing.
You may be ill and your kidneys the cause, for kidney
weakness soon destroys your health. Harmful waste and
poisons which the kidneys should remove are left in the system
to work havoc in the tissues, nerves and joints, causing
languor, dizziness, nervousness, backache, pain in the loins,
gravel, stone, dropsy, drowsiness, rheumatism and sciatica.
Never neglect weak kidneys. Give them the help they
need at the first sign of trouble. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are solely for the kidneys, and if taken in time will
soothe and heal the delicate kidney membranes, and enable
the kidneys to resume activity and to rid the body of the
poisons which have caused so much distress.
A Sydney Woman Endorses Doan’s Pills.
Lasting: Cure of Four Years.
Mrs. Chas. Clift, 30 Wellington Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says“ln common
with many others, I have nothing but good to say for Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. This remedy cured me of a" bad attack of kidney trouble of long-standing some
six months ago, and I have had no return since. Before I took these puls 1 was
suffering a lot with my back, the pain at times being almost unbearable. I cou ■
not stoop or move freely, and always felt tired, and had no energy. The secretion
were effected, being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment, and I had dropsical swell-
ings on my legs and ankles. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were one day broug 1
under my notice, and I sent for a bottle. They gave me great relief almost at
so I persevered with the remedy until I was quite cured, using in all fourbottles. 1
cannot speak too highly of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and recommend them with
every confidence to other sufferers.”
Four years later Mrs. Clift says“l have had no reason to alter my good
opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me over four years ago, and
I am still well. I always keep them in the house, and take a dose now and then,
just as a preventive against any return.”

Backache Kidney Pills
A Sydney Woman Cured by Doan’s
Ointment.
Mrs. A. Moore, 90 Wyndham Street,
Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“l suffered
from broken varicose veins on my leg,
the pain and irritation being very severe.
My leg was almost raw from the knee
to the ankle, and I was laid up with
it for three months. During the time I
was suffering I was treated at the hos-
pital, doctors attended me and I used
all sorts of ointments, but nothing did
me any good. One doctor wanted to
take off my leg, but I would not agree
to this, hoping that I would be able to
get something to cure me. At last I
heard of the wonderful curative powers
of Doan’s Ointment, so I sent for a pot
at once. I applied tins remedy, care-
fully following the directions, and in a
little while I noticed a slight improve-
ment, so I continued using it, with the
result that six pots completely cured
me. The irritation has gone, and the
wounds are quite healed. I cannot speak
too highly of Doan’s Ointment, and re-
commend its use whenever possible.”
Mrs. Moore confirms her previous
statement two years later: —“My cure
has proved a permanent one, a fact that
speaks volumes for the merit of Doan’s
Ointment.”

Lily< Langtry, standing first on one leg
and then on the other in her cruel em-
barrassment, denied the facts with her
mouth and admitted them with her eyes.
“Baal that one, Marmi —I likem plenty
whitefeller clo’es —plenty ’tarchi!’’
“All right, Lily—more better now. Who’s
this? —of course, Merrilegs! I remember
you. Little girl that time. Now you gottem
little girl, eh? Four! My word, Merri-
legs, that one all right. This your Benjamin?
What name? Carbine, eh? Who’s this old
chap? Charley Kingston, e'h? . Why, this
old chap used to be the. King of the Darling.
All right, Charley; plenty bacca I stop,
after been' makem big-feller tuckout we
gettein’ plenty bacca. And who’s this,
NVatts?”
“This is Tigersnake—and here’s Kitty
and Monkey.”
Kitty, about to wither from the fat con-
dition of strong middle-age to the flaccid
dwindling of the old gin, was recallable;
but Monkey, a grotesque ugliness withered
t;o skin hanging loosely over bones as if he
had been long dead, had passed out of all
remembrance. Supporting himself on a long,
rough bush staff lie faltered to Rossitter, his
joints seeming to creak as he moved, and
laid a monkey’s hand on Rossitter’s arm.
The white man recoiled, and disposed of
Monkey with tobacco on the instant. Mon-
key left Rossitter, and hobbled to the tree
near the tree of Bandicoot; but Kitty stood
up while Rossitter spoke to Tigersnake, re-
garding her son with pride not innocent of
fear.
Tigersnake, a rather good-looking fellow
but for the cruel, selfish mouth—the upper-
lip folded- in on itself, so that when he
laughed it suggested a rosette—and the eye
of a baulky horse, was not at all disquieted
at the arrival of the great white man. He
held out a hand —the clean hand of a man —
and Rossitter found himself taking it.
“Hallo, Tigersnake! I knew you when
you were little feller!”
“I heard so, six - ,” replied Tigersnake, in
perfectly correct English. “I heard you
saved my life.”
“No fear! There was no chance of your
losing it!” said Walter Rossitter, for he saw
Tisrersnake look frowningly at Kitty, and
Kitty draw back from the glance as if it
hurt her.
To end it Rossitter dismissed them all to
tuckout and tobacco; he bought presents
from the station slop-chests for men and
women; print wrappers and towels, mole-
skin trousers, shirts, tobacco and red hand-
kerchiefs for the men; and to Tigersnake
he gave a silver-mounted bi’iar pipe made in
Germany—-where also the silver was made
by other means than those of mineralogy.
Tigersnake thanked him, and his eyes
softened as he held the bridle of an over-
fresh horse while Rossitter mounted for his
trip of inspection. But before that the old
blacks had given Walter Rossitter a corro-
boree of lionoi-, dancing themselves to ex-
haustion as they illustrated and sang of his
doings in the old days.
The last Rossitter saw of the station that
time was the gi-oup of blacks collected to
bid him good-bye for a week or so. Tiger-
snake, smoking his new pipe, stood apart, as
if he did not belong to the blacks’ camp, and
waved a farewell for himself. ,
When they returned ten days later they
saw that the blacks from down-river had
not departed.
“They can’t leave you, Walter, you old
Simon Legree,” said Judson.
“There never was any Simon Legree,” re-
plied Rossitter. “We didn’t own these
boys, but Legree did; and what man ill-
treats and kills his own property? Why, if
these nigs were slaves they’d be xyorth
money, and be as well treated as horses,
taking them all round. But it’s not like
these walkabout boys to stand around ten
days after the corroboree’s over. And
they’re all here—George Reid and Lily
Langtry and Carbine and Merrilegs and
Charley Kingston. Where’s Monkey and
Kitty—and I don’t see Bandicoot any-
where.”
As he spoke a man in the uniform of a
police trooper walked out of the woolshed
and advanced to the horsemen.
“Something wrong,” said Watts, touching
with his heels the barrel of his horse, and
cantering towards the trooper-.
“What’s the matter?” asked Watts of the
trooper.
“A nigger run amok and killed three
others. I’ve got the chap who did the
killing chained up in there.”
“Tigersnake,” said Walter Rossitter.
“Tigersnake, by God!”
“Yes, that’s the chap.”
“He killed his mother and father —Kitty
and Monkey?”
“Yes, and old Bandicoot.”
“Bandicoot! Why did he kill - Bandi-i
coot?”
“I don’t know. Why did he kill Monkey
and Kitty?”
“I know why. Let me see him.”
“Certainly! I only waited for Mr. Watts
to hold the inquest and commit him. There’s
not another magistx-ate for 30 miles. I
knew you’d be back; the killing was
three days ago, and I only got Tigersnake
yesterday.”,
They entered the woolshed. Tigersnake.
chained to a staple in the woolpress, looked
at them with eyes that softened as they rested
on Rossitter. He refused to say anything ex-
cept to the man who had saved his life
20 years before; but when the others had
gone he told all—of the 21-year-old curse,
empty as the wind at its beginning, but
crystallising to fact in the alembic of a
womb and the long, long thoughts of preg-
nancy.
“When you go away, Marmi.” said Tiger-
snake, “I think I shall be good boy. I look
at my new pipe and my eyes are softer,
Marmi. You go away-—then I forgot what
you are like and the bad thoughts come
back.”
“What bad thoughts, Tigersnake ?”
“Bad thoughts that I have always—be-
fore I go to the mission; when I with the
mission: asleep, awake, bad thoughts. The
foi-ehead altogether go away. The blood in
the head say. ‘Kill!’ The blood in the
wrist say. ‘Kill! Kill!’ all dav. all night.
The horse gallop ‘Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!’ the
sheep say ‘Ki-i-i-11’, the crow say ‘Kill!
Quark! Kill!’ the wind say ‘Kill!’ It is
not of my head that it come. It is there
when I am baby—one year, two year old,
tracking up my mother for the milk of the
breast when I am thirsty. Always 'Kill!’
And you are gone, Marmi; there is none to
make my eye soft. Four day ago Monkey
and Kitty hear my blood say loud feller,
‘Kill! Kill!’ They are frightened—they
run away in the night. I wake at the time
for horse-hunting. Then I look, find three-
feller tracks.”
“Three!”
“Bandicoot is the other —he is afraid.”
“But why?”
“I do not know, Marmi; but if he is
afraid he run away, and if he run away he
shall be killed. I track them all day. They
have been frightened—they turn back to the
station. Few miles away I catch them.
They are old, they cannot run. First I kill
Bandicoot.”
“Poor old Bandicoot! He did no harm to
anybody.”
“He is afraid. He run away. He is
killed. Then I kill Monkey. He is easy.
Then I kill my mother. That is hard. I
kill them all. Then I am at rest. I could
not kill any more. All the killing is done.
I feel better inside and I sleep. When I
wake I have these on my hands.”
He held out his hands, and Rossitter saw
the handcuffs on his wrists.
The inquest was over and the trooper
had left Gilgai with his prisoner, bound for
Wilcannia gaol, before the white men talked
of the tragedy.
“The quick development of your little
story of Kitty and Monkey wanting to kill
the child that killed them —that’s the mar-
vel of it. More things than we wot of,
Walter.”
“No, it’s simple! You first prophesy, and
then you do all the things certain to make
the prophecy come true. The medicine-man
tells Kitty and Monkey to kill the baby be-
cause it will kill people if it grows up.
They talk of it, their thoughts run on
murder, and the unfortunate child gets the
fixed idea of murder as a maternal impres-
sion. His killing of these particular people
was just a coincidence. But why did he
kill Bandicoot? There’s Charley Kingston,
let’s ask him. Hey, Charley !”
“Yowi, Marmi.”
“Why that one Tigersnake kill Bandi-
coot?”
“Marmi, you know when that one medi-
cine-doctor tellem Kitty, tellem Monkey,
killem Tigersnake, so he no been killem
plenty man when that one grow up?”
“Yowi, what about it?”
“Tigersnake not been know that one Ban-
dicoot. Mine been know that one Bandi-
coot.”
“Well, well?”
“That one Bandicoot been medicine-doctor
that one time.”
The three white men looked at each other,
their eyes full of wonder.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
On the Table.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ANN and Bannerman were clerks;
they boarded and lodged (wash-
ing, bath,, latchkey and piano) with
Mrs. Scarlett, whom Miss Winnie Skewes,
instructress in calisthenics and elocution,
also favored with her patronage.
Tann and Bannerman’s affection for Miss
Skewes was simultaneous and of the same
forced growth. Within a month both were
mad about her. For her part, she acted in
a wholly impartial manner. The first man
to offer to take her to the theatre or to pro-
pose a taxi scamper found his favor graci-
ously accepted, with the result that both
young men got up early in the hope of arriv-
ing well ahead —a superfluous precaution,
seeing that the lady invariably arose late.
On this particular Saturday, however,
Bannerman had booked Miss Skewes for a
bay trip through the, keyhole of her bedroom
door at 5.30 in the morning. Tann con-
sidered this taking an undue advantage.
Shortly after lunch, while he still felt sore
about it, he found his enemy lying on his
back on the couch in the smoking-room wait-
ing for Miss Skewes, and sound asleep, with
his mouth ajar. The sight inspired Tann
with an infamous idea. Deftly he inserted
forefinger and thumb and removed the small
plate containing Bannerman’s three best
teeth; then, slipping them into his pocket,
he stole out. With a lighter heart he went
to the cricket match, thinking that Banner-
man would have to plead illness to shelve the
steamer trip, and intending on his return to
place the teeth where they would eventually
be discovered by the victim.
When the villain of the piece landed home
in the evening he found Mrs. Scarlett’s in a
state of violent eruption, and fearful doings
under way. Poor Mr. Bannerman had
swallowed his front teeth in his sleep, plate
and all! He had nearly perished. Medical
aid had been sent for, experts had been
rushed in and had thrown X-rays on the
miserable victim, revealing the presence of
a dark patch, inexplicable to science, some-
where in his diaphragm ; and hurried steps
w T ere now being taken for a speedy operation
to save his life, and incidentally restore the
swallowed incisors. The operation was to
take place at a private hospital three suburbs
off at half-past six.
Tann hurled himself at the telephone, he
crowded himself into a car, being blocked in
his effort to connect with the hospital, and
broke all speed limits in his meteoric rush.
They had Bannerman under the ana;sthetic
when he tumbled in with the missing teeth
and a lucid explanation.
The disgusted medical gentlemen permitted
Tann to remove his friend in the car before
the latter had quite come out of the chloro-
form, and before Bannerman reached home
he had been persuaded to believe that Tann,
hearing of his dilemma, had been whirled to
the hospital, with an infallible, bloodless
method of inducing unfortunates to disgorge
swallowed sets. The method had been
wholly successful in Bannerman’s case.
In his gratitude Bannerman insisted on
paying for the car. But the dark spot in
his diaphragm is still inexplicable.
