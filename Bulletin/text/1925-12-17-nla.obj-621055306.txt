The Exile of Erin
“C.0.M.,” arguing that Robert Burns was
really Irish (R.P. 26/11/’25), speaks
of distressed people from the “top cor-
ner of Ireland’’ slipping across “the
strait narrow enough to cross in an
open boat” and settling in Galloway. That
was in the far-baclc days of the English
invasion. But the “Iff miles of sea” leads
to Cantyre and the wild Highlands. Gallo-
way isn’t Ayrshire, where Burns was born,
and the passage from Ireland to Ayr would
be a serious proposition for an open boat.
The Scottish Highlands are supposed to have
got much, or most, of their population and
the Gaelic language from Ireland in remote
ages, and Galloway very long ago talked the
Gaelic which is presumed to have reached
it from Wales, but I never saw or heard or
read of Gaelic speech or other distinct Irish
traces in Ayrshire. That county was full
of fierce Covenanters in the later Stuart
period, and it fought with a holy hatred
against the cause which the Irish and High-
land Gaels adopted with their whole hearts.
There is no evidence that Robert Burns’s
father came from the Highlands. It is
only said (by “C.0.M.” anyhow) that he
said he did. It isn’t even said that he
said he was Irish. If he had a genuine
Irish ancestor he might easily be himself
only one-eighth Irish, otherwise an Irish
octoroon. Robert Burns himself was never
expelled from Ireland, so lie doesn’t fill the
bill as an “exile of Erin.” He may have
been born, on very close measurement, rather
nearer to the anglicised north-east corner of
Ireland than to Edinburgh, but he wasn't
born closer to Dublin than to Edinburgh.
Many great men are born nearer to one
place than another.
The assertion is made by “C.0.M.” that
the poet’s name was really Burn, but that
the “s” was, added because Burn was “so
unfamiliar in Scotland.” The rule that a
man with an “s” at the end of. his name, as
in the case of Jones, has affixed it in order to
avoid detection ought to be better corrobo-
rated. Extra corroboration is > called for if
the rule applies to the man with an "s” at
the beginning of his name, such as Smith,
and to men of the Stiggins type, with au
“s” both ways. “Burn,” being the regulation
Scottish term (of Saxon origin) for a small
stream of what people drink, should be
common enough in that wet country, for a,
poor nation can’t live wholly on whisky.
The facts that Robert Burns had a Scot-
tish mother-, a father who is said to have
lately turned Irish, was born in Scotland,
wrote in the Scottish dialect, and never
visited or showed the slightest interest in
Ireland, don't prove him to be Irish, though
they may help a little. -
Among Scotsmen, according to “C.0.M.,”
Burns stands, in a literary sense, “isolated
and utterly lonely,” with, i suppose, Walter
Scott and the half-Scottish Byron and a
few more for company. This is advanced iu
proof that he was Irish, yet the striking
individuality and aloofness of Shakspeare
don't similarly show that he came from
Austria.
It is further advanced on behalf of the
“Exile of Erin” view that, while Scotland
isn’t turning out the Burns class of litera-
ture now, Ireland is, and that “much modern
Irish Verse, though written without dialect,
shows a spirit and emotional color in every
way kindred to the best work of Burns.''
That apparently means that there are people
living iu Ireland, whether they belong there
or not, who are writing, in English, matter
which is near or remote kin to that of the
Ayrshire bard. Whether any of them will
prove to be the national and outstanding
singer whom Erin has always lacked, .and
whom Moore was almost mistaken for. is
a very different affair. A catalogue should
have been attached for purposes of reference.
Life without a catalogue is a deleterious void,
a tangled waste of assertion and a valley of
dry groans.
J. E.
We are told that the poet’s name was
not Burns but Burn, the “s” having been
added “because the name of Burn was
so unfamiliar in Scotland.” Oddly enough,
the only family of Burns I know are out-
and-out Pats from the uttermost bogs, while
the single Burn I have met radiated an atmo-
sphere of heather and haggis. Doubtless there
are Irish of both names, just as there are
English Bruces, Wallaces and Scotts; but
the word “burn,” Scottish in very essence,
spreads itself over the map of Scotland, and
asserts itself in surnames. like Burnside,
Birnie, Raebturn, Cockburn, Thorburn, _ etc.
Moreover, Burns’s father wasn’t called either
Burns or BJurn, but Burness or Burnes,
which, in ultra-Caledonian fashion, would be
pronounced with an approximation to two
syllables. It Robert himself who sim-
plified the spelling. Now for a fact on the
historical “side. William Burness, or Burnes
—the father—did not come from “some un-
specified ’place in the highlands,” but from
Kincardy ie, on the east coast, where he was
born on. the. estates of the Earls Marischal;
so that if he, or his forebears, escaped from
they got about as far away from
it as they could without falling into the
North Sea. William Burness’s history is
authen tic enough. The estates of the Earls
Marischal were forfeited after the rebel-
lion of 1845, and, although the canny Bur-
ness took pains to dissociate himself from
“the late unhappy rising,” his livelihood was
gone. An uncle of the poet was also settled
in Montrose, quite handy to Kincardine,
where he begat another distinguished Burnes,
Sir Alexander, who died in India.
ALEX. MELROSE.
The Doric used by Burns was the language
of the Ayrshire peasant and farmer. If he
did not get his alleged Celtic strain from
the North he is much more likely to have
got it from the Mull of Cantyre, across the
Clyde estuary from the Ayrshire coast, or
from the Western Isles adjoining, where
Gaelic was, and still largely is, the language
of the common people. That western Gaelic
is akin to Irish Gaelic, but has little in
common with Lowland Scots, which is
largely derived from old Saxon. That
part of Ireland nearest to the Ayrshire coast
is much less Celtic than the closer Western
Isles of Scotland. It was, and is, largely
peopled by the descendants of the Ulster
Plantation from the borders of England and
Scotland. It is unnecessary to invent or per-
vert facts to provide Burns with a Celtic
strain, but if the strain was there it was
not Irish but Highland. Probably Burns
was not a typical Scot any more than Shefiev
was a typical Englishman. Both were
“sports,” as all great, poets probably were.
His lyrics may have the note of sadness that
characterises Celtic poetry, Irish or High-
land ; but sadness is not confined to Celts.
It is characteristic of lyric poetry every-
where. The Irish are not the only people
to lament lost causes in verse, and they have
no monopoly of sorrow.
J. L.
Being a Scotchman, and, in consequence,
a little dull, I cannot be quite, sure whether
“C.0.M.” is indulging in delicate satire, or
expressing what he considers to be a matter
of fact. But, in either case, I wish to thank
him for relieving my mind of a life-long
burden. He has proved to my satisfaction
and his own, that Burns was not a Scotch-
man, and that it is, therefore, not a sin
against the great Scottish virtue of patriot-
ism to have but a slight admiration for him,
and to believe that there are several who
are much bettoy—and really Scottish.
“C.0.M.” is kindly welcome to Burns—so
long as he leaves me the others.
C. H. SOFTER.
The Australian Theatre
One of the many problems that confront
theatrical firms is the obtaining of suitable
material for actors and actresses under their
management/ Many plays are submitted to
entrepreneurs; but, while some may possess
great merit, the trouble is that they are
of no value to the managements in question,
because they are unsuitable for the various
aggregations of artists the firms have under
contract. Flays that have been written with-
out any regard to the personality of the
“stars” or the personalities necessary for
successful production are not likely to be
rushed by managers. The personal experience
of the writer of this article—during the years
that he has had to seek suitable plays for both
male and female stars —is that the majority
of the plays submitted would make in-
teresting magazine-stories, but, so far as
the dialogue is concerned, would be quite
devoid of dramatic interest on the stage.
The difficulties and risks of production
in Australia are not generally understood.
Abroad, when a brand-new play is produced,
it is seen, as a rule, in the provinces for
a few weeks before it is presented in one
of the capital cities, and by the time it
reaches London or dSew York weaknesses
of play and cast have been eliminated. The
result is that the lessees of metropolitan
theatres and the entrepreneurs are willing
to risk their'money in producing a play
which has had a comparatively successful
“try-out” and a judicious pruning. Iu Lon-
don the play that gains the favor of the
public may run for two or three years. In
America, if a theatrical offering does not
register a. big success iu New York there
are other large cities—‘Chicago, Boston,
Philadelphia— where it may score so heavily
that it will be one of the attractions for
the best part of the season. In Austra-
lia, on the other hand, the risks of new
productions are tremendous, because a play
either lives or dies in Sydney or Melbourne.
A ten-weeks’ run in either of 1 these cities is
regarded as a happy achievement, while a
total run of 26 weeks in the Commonwealth
is a' matter for jubilation on the part of
the manager.
Any man with goods for sale must find
a market. If the first person he calls on
does not want to buy, the intending seller,
does not write to the newspapers to com-
plain that the person who refused to buy
is “downing local products.” If the seller
has faith in his goods* he will continue to
search for his market. In Australia the
embryo playwright apparently does not look
for markets outside his own country. Yet
all the world over there is a shortage of
good plays (“apparently good” would be
a more correct term, for less than 25 per
cent, of plays produced are financial suc-
cesses). Consequently play-bureaus have
sprung into existence in practically every
country. All plays submitted are read, and
as these bureaus have scouts out to see
which of the producing firms are wanting
fresh plays, the embryo playwright of ability
has a chance of having his work “placed.”
The play-bureaus have on their lists all the
leading theatrical producers in the world,
and the name of J. C. Williamson, Ltd.,
will be found on these lists, for the Firfn—
on account of the small playing-time in this
country for dramas and comedies —has the
most difficulty in selecting plays likely to
be successful.
The writer during his stay in Australia
has spent considerable time in looking for
suitable plays for Guy Bates Post. A
number of Australian authors have sub-
mitted manuscripts, but, while some of these
offerings have possessed merit, they have
all been regretfully refused, because in the
majority of cases they were plays written
for women stars and did not contain any
part suitable for Mr. Post.
Generally it needs actual stage experience
to become a successful playwright, as
mechanics play a most important part.
Winehell Smith had years on the stage be-
fore attempting to write a play, and many
years before he was successful. Yet very
few hetors are a success at writing. A
very fine comedian, Jack Hazzard, con-
ceived the idea of “Turn to the Bight.” The
play was written round his idea by Win-
chell Smith. “High trim’ ” was conceived by
Frank Bacon, and also written by Winehell
Smith. “The Eyes of Youth,” by Frank
Glidden, had to be re-written by Max
Marcin before it was a financial success.
David Belasco generally re-writes the plays

submitted to him. George M. Cohan re-
writes his musical comedies.
Theatrical critics very seldom figure as
successful authors of plays, and the reason
is hard to fathom. They certainly have the
opportunity of seeing plays by the world s
greatest authors. They, I presume, read the
old and new Masters’ works. They cer-
tainly criticise and tear plays to pieces—
to do this seems tlieir greatest pleasure and
sole ambition, especially in Australia; it
one cares to keep a record of Australian
critics’ reports one will find them mostly
destructive. They are certainly not con-
structive, neither do they encourage or help
the local managers to give an Australian
artist a leading role. It is not so in Lon-
don or New York. Australian papers- will
give a premiere a quarter- or half-column.
They will mention one or two out ot the
cast. The merits of the play will be dis-
missed in as few words as possible. A
manager can only give the public the class
of fare that he feels it will go and see,
because the press will not encourage him to
produce the highest dramatic art.
The press should realise how difficult con-
ditions are in this country. Our great dis-
tances from the art centres of the world
make it tremendously difficult for managers
to induce artists to make the journey.
Great artists receive big money in the
other parts of the world, and managers can
pay those big salaries cheerfully, as prices
of admission range from 2s. (Id. to 255. per
seat, according to the success of the play,
whereas in Australia the limit seems to be
Bs. Yet wages are far above the average;
consequently the cost of producing a play
in Australia is as high as, and in many cases
a great deal higher than, in England of
America. To induce artists to visit Aus-
tralia the manager has to pay them from
50 to 100 per cent, more salary ; also pay first-
class return fares and guarantee that the
artist will receive at least 44 weeks’ salary
in each year, whether the plays are suc-
cessful or otherwise. In England and
America most artists are engaged for the
run of the play, with a much smaller guaran-
tee as to period; and if the play fails the
manager's liability is the amount he has
actually lost to the date on which the play
closes. The Australian manager, on the
other hand, must seek new material and
keep on risking more and more of his capital.
In some cases it is the artist that does not
appeal to the public at the first presenta-
tion, and no matter how excellent the artist
may be in the second production the season
has often been doomed to failure. This
does not happen in isolated instances; I
know of quite a number of artists and many
plays that have failed in Australia on that
account. The press could step in and help
the managers in many of those _ cases.
It is surprising, however, to look at influen-
tial Australian newspapers and observe the
very scant attention given to the dramatic
and musical arts and compare it with the
publicity meted out to prize-fighting, horse-
racing, pony-racing and sordid divorce de-
tails from all parts of the w T orld.
GERALD PRING.
Place Aux Dames
As a male born and brought up in the
best traditions of the Victorian period, I feel
that I insult my very hearthrug by writing
this paper. All the nicest laws of nature had
settled it for ever that man was the superior
of woman ; that was axiomatic —so much so,
indeed, that we never troubled even to
examine the axiom.
We grew up and out of that majestic aeon.
They slipped the dogs of war on us; and
these, like Swinburne, stamped on all our
top-hats and worried us out into this place
in the back seats, leaving the sand well
cleared for our “inferiors.” Every man knows
what they do to him in the, so to say, hearth-
rug aspects of life; and every man will soon
know what they can manage in the matters
of business, science and the lesser arts. My
preoccup tion here is with their activities
in the fiction section of the major art. part
of my job in the back seats being the looking-
on at current novels.
It cuts me to the quick of my solemn in-
heritance to confess it, but in this matter
the men are not worth tuppence compared
with the women —certainly not in the one
great essential of flexibility. E. M. Forster
and Hugh Walpole are the only two who, I
think, have developed the range of their
sensitivenessal All the other men would
seem to have fixed their reactions and
sympathies impregnably. The vision of
Wells's “The Dream” is not essentially wider
nor deeper than that of “Kipps” or “Tono-
Bungay.” Bennett’s “Riceyman Steps,”
beautiful as it is, goes not one step farther
than “Clayhanger” went. Galsworthy still
expounds in “The White Monkey” the grace
of sex with no more insight into the heroic
power of sex than “The Man of Property”
could disclose. D. 11. Lawrence goes tur-
gidly along with his dark formula: his
canary-colored stockings have become love-
sick trees and rivers, but they are not any
nearer the sympathies of his readers, how-
ever significant they may be to the intel-
ligence of the sophisticated critics. Aldous
Huxley is still bitter and clever, Stephen
McKenna still clever and shoddy. Compton
Mackenzie has worked backward to melo-
drama and the social scene; so has W. B.
Maxwell, with the one peak of “The Day’s
Journey” a couple of years ago. Conal
O’Riordan is merry and bright as hereto-
fore, unconquerably fresh and permanently
young. And William McFee paints the psy-
chological pictures to-day which he began
to paint 10 years ago; there is no advance in
either the pictures or the painting.
May Sinclair, the chief and most perma-
nent British woman-novelist of to-day, began
her real work in 1904 with “The Divine
Fire,” a story of a Bloomsbury poet who,
beyond his poetry, was drunken and “com-
mon.” Times changed, and superficial com-
monness became unimportant and was
scrapped—“ Harriett Frean” and other books
turned to inherent commonness and senti-
mentality for themes. The deep, flexible
mind followed out a passing idea to its logi-
cal conclusion, and “A Defence of Idealism,”
an erudite philosophical textbook, was the
result. Psycho-analysis came over the hori-
zon, and the sensitive mind had a shot at
that, “Ann Severn and the Fieldings” em-
bodying the shot. Her vision having the
true artist’s habit of taking nothing for
granted, of going forward step by step into
whatever may befall, bluff and the empty
shell irked her, and one of the great ironical
pictures of our day, “A Cure of Souls,” en-
riched us. The concentrated-historical man-
ner enticed her, and “Arnold Waterlow,”
brimming with sympathy and life and doing
the work of 1,000,000 words in 100,000, was
published last year. That done, a defence
of idealism in novel form seemed due, and
“The Rector of Wyck,” my most treasured
example of the high art of modern fiction,
came to me for review.
Sheila Kaye-Smitli has come a long way
from the easy character-studies and rustic
charm of “A Tramping Methodist” and
“Tamarisk Town” to the epic bucolic rich-
ness of “Joanna Godden” and “The End of
the House of Alard.” In Margaret Ken-
nedy’s “The Constant Nymph” the spirited
satire of “The Ladies of Lyndon” is thrown
overboard as if it were valueless instead of
brilliant, and the author gives us a beauti-
ful picture of up-to-the-minute conditions
in a simplified, austere style which is yet
miraculously sympathetic and pungent.
Stella Benson shifts kaleidoscopically from
the laughter and tears of “Living Alone” to
the fiery concentration of “Pipers and a
Dancer,” seeking, always seeking the for-
mula which shall best express her vision.
G. B. Stern rejects first the grace of “The
Room” and then the speed and sweep of
“Tents of Israel” to see what she can do
with the tender throbbing detail of “Thunder-
storm.” From the structural affectation
of “Echo” Margaret Rivers Larminie rises
gradually to the still, telling, quietude of
“Soames Green.” The tricky cleverness of
Rose Macaulay’s “Potterism” blooms at last
into the rare allegorical flower of “Orphan
Island.” Kathleen Coyle’s piquant, ultra-
modern “Piccadilly” grows into “The
Widow’s House,” a picture far beyond the
powers of George Eliot.
Rebecca West, Dorothy Richardson, Vir-
ginia Woolf, Amabel Williams-Ellis, Vere
Hutchinson, Ethel Sidgwick, Beatrice Kean
Seymour—what 70 of the men can show an
aggregate of the life and sympathy in the
fictional work of these seven women ? Not
technical skill, nor grace of style, but groiv-
ing life and sympathy which drive and will
drive them on until they can say all that
they mean, or have perished, still striving
after the perfect form.
Of the men only Walpole travels forward
from the nonage of “Mr. Perrin” and “The
Duchess of Wrexe,” through the grandeur
of “The Dark Forest” and “The Cathedral.”
out to the open, tender magic of “The Old
Ladies.” E. M. Forster, the other flaw in
my argument, writes little and seldom, which
makes it hard to gauge his rise ; but there is
much more than 12 years’ development be-
tween the strange charm of “Howard’s End”
and the brooding splendid immensity of “A
Passage to India.” But these two alone
cannot save the hearthrug or, it seems, even
the pen, so far as fiction is concerned.
HILARY LOFTING.
Still—What is Art?
If “W.M.W.” has cooled down sufficiently
since lie penned his spirited exposure of the
New Movement in Art (R.P. 29/10/’25),
perhaps he will re-read his interesting ser-
mon and explain to ordinary cold and fish-
like members of the congregation likd myself
what he really understands by Art. The
extraordinary vagueness of his oratory
arouses a suspicion that, like the parson in
the pulpit who avoids trouble by generalis-
ing on virtue, righteousness and Christian
conduct, he hasn’t the clearest notions about
the subject himself; and the aroma of sus-
picion is deepened by the fact that he selects
the absent and defenceless Rupert Bunny
for his text.
Anyhow, why does he pick on Rupert
Bunny as typical of the Bolsheviks of art?
All Bunny does is to see landscape in a
very vivid and very lovely way. But, accord-
ing' to “W.M.W.,” it isn’t truth. What, then,
is truth? Is the camera version of visual
objects truth ? As I write, from my window
I can see a gum-tree sapling —I think it is
a spotted gum—which, as the sun gets
nearer to the western rim, is slowly changing
from a drab, untidy slattern into a miracle
of beauty. No artist could put inside a
frame its intricate pattern of blood-red and
henna-colored leaves, edged with moving
silver and backed by a soft riddle of softer
tones, or the many-tinted halo it casts into
the air, which halo is itself a torrent of
golden insects whirling in their wedding-
dance. Even if he were a master with a
capital M, and an old one at that, all that
he could do would be to convey to canvas a
crude adumbration of its visual appearance
plus something of the emotion he felt in
looking at it. If he felt no particular emo-
tion his picture might be a good enough
colored photograph of nature, but it would
have no value as a work of art.
Rupert Bunny’s pictures have emphati-
cally conveyed to many people some of the
emotion he must have experienced when he
painted them. Apart from the significance
of the forms, the color in which they are
embodied is a physical delight, and as satis-
fying as those pictures made by Nature her-
self in a certain dusky marble that the
Chinese frame and hang upon their walls.
Bunny’s approach to actual appearances is
usually remarkably close —at any rate, the
discrepancy isn’t great enough to enrage any
but the wilder dervishes of orthodoxy, the
modern representatives of the mob that
foamed at Whistler —nowadays one of
“W.M.W.’s” Old Masters —because he saw
Battersea Bridge emotionally instead of in
the way the millions who had walked across
it had always seen it.
M. G. S.
World History at a Glance
To compile an accurate, fairly compre-
hensive comparative history of the world in
six pages looks like a record-breaking per-
formance ; yet this is exactly the task which
has just been completed by Frederic Aarons
and which now appears under the title Con-
temporanea: the World’s History 1129 B.c. to
1900 a.d. It is true that the pages are very
large, but it is just in their size that the
whole ingenuity of the scheme lies. By the
use of folding sheets, which tit in small
compass, the comparison of country with
country becomes possible; and the eye takes
in at a single glance the contemporaneous
history of an age. Thus, opening at the
second sheet and looking at the period of the
Norman Conquest of England, we see that
in France it was marked by the growth of
monarchical power, in Germany by a 50-
years’ dispute over the denial of Papal
authority, in Spain by the substitution of
Moorish rule for that of the Saracens, in Por-
tugal by the first establishment of the king-
dom, in Russia by the spread of Christian-
ity through Greek agency, in Italy by the
Norman occupation of Naples and conquest
of Sicily, in south-eastern Europe by the
final separation of the Greek and Roman
churches, in Asia by the Turkish conquests
of Asia Minor and Jerusalem, and in Africa
by the rise of Edrisi, the Arab geographer
and philosopher. By the plan of compara-
tive columns it is possible to see these and
many more similar events in their world
setting and to get the general scope and
trend of the age instantly in focus. On
turning to another sheet, we see that at the
time when Abel Tasman was in Australian
waters, China was settling down under the
rule of the Mancliu Tartars, the French
were driving the Portuguese out of Mada-
gascar, Louis XIV. was ‘about to become
King of France under the regency of Anne
of Austria, and the first guns wore being fired
in England in the civil war between King
and Parliament. Meanwhile Germans were
tearing each other to pieces in their religious
strife, Van Tromp had become the supreme
name in naval affairs, Russia had just been
hammered by Sweden, and Galileo, having
been forced by the Inquisition to deny his
scientific creed, was dying in shameful
retirement. One of the great advantages of
the comparative statement is that it in-
stantly brings back to mind huge areas of
history which may have been long forgotten
by the average reader, and not only brings
them back but places them in their true re-
lation to other dimly-remembered masses of
information. In this way the large pages
with their ruled columns really convey far
more than i s actually printed there; and the
whole compilation may reasonably claim to
be a brief history of the world in the only
practicable form in which such a history
can be presented. An immense amount of
patient labor must have gone to the task of
making the record as complete as it is:
and a very just sense of proportion has been
maintained. There is no massing of minor
British or American events to the exclusion
of big things in other lands. Where blanks
occur in some of the columns it is exceed-
ingly difficult to find anything of world im-
portance that might have filled them; and so,
left blank, they give a more valuable view ot
things in that particular country than would
have been the case if they had been filled
with detail. It is rather a happy age tor
any decent land when it makes no history
worth recording. The book should be ot
great value in schools and to the student,
but it should also make a strong appeal to
the general reader. It is much more easily
used than any dictionary of dates, and as a
companion to a good dictionary of dates it
is beyond price. The compiler—an Austra-
lian —promises further issues of “Contempo-
ranea” in similar form dealing with litera-
ture, art, music, Australian history, mven-
tion and production.

A Satchel of Books
The Letters of Hannah More (John Lane). Hannah
More wrote a forgotten novel and much bad vefse;
but in her own narrow way she was a great phi-
lanthropist. However, it is not that side of her life
that you see most of in these letters: they were
well worth resurrecting because of their intimate
pictures of the interesting people who were her
friends —Dr. Johnson and Boswell and Garrick
and Joshua Reynolds and scores more of that
fruitful period.
About Jesus, by David Ross (Nisbet). The author
is the minister of St. Kilda Presbyterian Church,
Melbourne. The Jesus of the Christian faith is por-
trayed in the four gospels—one gives His ministry,
another the historical aspect of Ilis coming, the
third deals with the human relationship, and the
fourth holds the ponderings of the thinker, John.
The purpose informing this book is, by an examina-
tion of these gospels, to reach the heart of the
Christian faith, with an eye on “the bettering of a
broken and a bleeding world.”
Social Classes in Post-War Europe, by Lothrop
Stoddard (Scribner’s). Stoddard’s stories are enter-
taining, if not taken too literally. His first book,
“The Rising Tide of Color,” painted a world in
which white civilisation was threatened with extinc-
tion bv the Asiatic increase; in “The Revolt of
Islam,” the fanatical children of the Prophet were
to do the job; in “Racial Realities in Europe” the
Nordic peoples were to be swallowed by their white
brothers of other races. In the present book the
urban populations are to be passed the death-knock
by the people of the country. It has already hap-
pened in Russia, where cities like Petrograd and
Moscow stand dying in their boots, and the move-
ment is spreading elsewhere. The return of a modi-
fied feudal system is expected. England is the
exception. Having mislaid her peasantry and ’ost
her manufacturing monopoly, she has no visible
means of support either way, according to Stoddard.
Viewed from the American publicist's angle, recent
events in Australia no doubt reflect the old-world
tendency. The Australian cocky-peasant showed quite
plainly that he was not going to let the proletarian
mob of the cities, represented by the amiable Garden,
start a revolution which might end in the national-
isation of the land, and an incipient Green Inter-
nationale—as Stoddard calls the counter-movement —
cropped up in several places, notably in Bowen (Q.).

The Winds.
The west wind is a wet wind;
It brings the welcome rain.
The east wind is a dry wind;
It blows it off again.
The south wind is a cold wind
That soothes the panting land;
But the north wind is a hot wind
That strews the earth with sand.
The west wind is the best wind
To make the crops to grow;
The east wind is the least wind
Of all the winds that blow.
The south wind has a sweet breath
And a strong and gentle hand;
But the north wind is the scourge of God
That scours the earth with sand!

Singing Waves.
Along the waking coast,
When morning broke,
The waves sang like a host
Of joyful folk.
As in they ranged and rolled,
Lit skies above,
It seemed a tale they told
Of youth and love.
As long they sang and clear
In morning’s glow,
It was most sweet to hear
Them singing so.
To Age, grey Age, they gave
Bright counselling:
“Youth is not in its grave,”
They seemed to sing.
As on the beach they flung
Their shining spray,
“Be young, be ever young,”
They seemed to say.
“Make merry while you live,
And care forsake;
For joy is sweet to give
And sweet to take.
“Regret not perished things,
Lost lights of old.
For each new morning brings
Fresh rays of gold.”
To youth, fair youth, they voiced
All rich delights,
And rolling in rejoiced
’Neath radiant lights.
Bright counsellors were they
With splendor graced.
As plumed with flying spray
They inward raced.
As rose the sun and flung
Gold beams aslant,
It seemed all things grew young
Thrilled by their chant.

Favorite.
She dwells apart among the starts
By joy companioned, happy one,
Removed from all that frets and jars
Or clouds the splendor of the sun—
A stranger to the moth and rust,
The conflict waged among the dust.
Her dewy dawns have rosy wings;
The happy hours are sweet and long.
For her the note of mellow strings
Vibrates in melody and song.
Content is hers, a lovely face,
Unclouded eyes, the spirit’s grace!
And yet . the water’s level lapse—
Her tranquil life’s unruffled calm—-
May be a weariness perhaps,
For sweetness cloys. The victor palm
Holds more of worth; the rest at last
Is dearer for the danger past!

ETHEL MARTYR.
Feud.
Too glad is' my heart for song
That is sad in singing
Of a love or a life wrought wrong
Or an old pain clinging.
Yet blows a wind I hear
Morrow on moTrow,
Telling me, tear by tear,
Ages of sorrow.
Blithe though the part I play,
Jest on jest flinging,
Yet at heart’s heart for aye
Time’s grief is singing.
What shall it profit me,
Song’s wistful magic?
Still seems the goal to be
Dreamless and- tragic.
Glad is my heart, ah, glad
As song can make it!
How wild and strange and sad
That song should break it !

AN UNDENIABLE MANDATE.
Having captured every Senate seat which
was on the market and as many seats in the
other House as he can possibly require;
having got rid of Gardiner, who in the red
fool-fury bf his bumptiousness promised to
try the Australian-born Ministry in his own
court and deport it from its own country;
having averted Theodore and disposed of
Joel Moses Garb, who didn’t live up to liis
early promise of providing the House with
infinite mirth. Prime Minister Bruce now
has the path clear before him. He asked for
a mandate to take the management of Aus-
tralia out of the hands of Communists,
strike-promoters, job-controllers, blatant and
avowed revolutionists, Red objective cranks
and other undesirables, largely imported, and
to make the Australian Government and
Parliament supreme. He got his mandate
beyond any shadow of doubt. It was given
in a way which showed that the country ex-
pects large and sudden and energetic doings
from Bruce. The position is that he has
won a great victory, and if he doesn’t make
use of his victory he hasn’t won anything.
If he doesn’t make full use of it he hasn’t
won much. A Government may be furnished
with complete authority and given a free
hand in the choice of methods and means to
make war on revolutionaries, or rabbits, or
prickly-pear, or even on emus, and yet may
make no progress. If it is too polite and
soft-hearted, or too averse to hurting the
feelings of an enemy who may possibly be an
orphan or the sole support of a widowed
mother-in-law, the end of three years may
find the position even worse than at the be-
ginning. History is cluttered up with the
record of cases in which the minority came
out on top because, while the mandate and
the majority were all right, the man to whom
they were entrusted wasn’t. That is one
reason why a rampant type of Laborite is
anxious to stop the teaching of real history,
and to substitute a bogus article.
* * * *
The local world of sixes and sevens, which
was none too good when the Bruce Ministry
took office and has become worse since, is a
remarkable sample of demoralisation. From
the beginning the new apparatus of deporta-
tion was too slow and cumbersome to give
much hope, and at the first test in the High
Court it has broken down. Yet so large
a proportion of the worst conspirators
against Australia’s self-governing rights have
come from outside, and have accumulated
here because this is the country above all
others where the alien firebrand has been
not only tolerated but allowed to roar with
impunity at the native-born, that rapid de-
portation on a pretty large scale is wanted.
The arrears of a decade wait for attention.
No sane and civilised citizen would, of course,
propose a deportation law on the lines of the
Storey Cabinet’s original draft Profiteering
Bill —the one which struck a reef in the
Upper House. That document provided for
trial before a court of three, two being lay-
men selected by the Minister, paid what he
thought fit and removable at his pleasure.
This body was not to be bound by any hide-
bound conventions as to evidence or proce-
dure, but to pursue its own carefree way with
the widest powers, and the measure was
dotted all over with the information that
there should be no appeal. But iin Bruce’s
deportation law the unbidden guest who lias
made himself a nuisance, a public danger
and the malicious cause of immense loss was
allowed so much appeal that the long list of
candidates for expulsion seemed likely to last
for ever. Also, the imported revolutionary
performs as if he owned this land and was
here by right; and Australian Labor poli-
ticians, who pose on other occasions as anti-
imperialists, protest that their country,
being merely one of ‘‘the colonies,” has no
right to throw him out. Nothing but the
removal of the extraneous. Bolshevik ele-
ment is likely to ease the situation, and at
the present pace the situation appears to
have all the best of it. As for taking some
measures such as Great Britain has adopted
against the native revolutionary, the first
beginning hasn't yet been made.
So Australia has become a land of comic-
opera happenings. A general rule has been
laid down that no ship shall go to sea till
the last fireman has finished drinking. It
may be a vessel the detention of which will
cost hundreds or thousands of pounds and
inconvenience hundreds of people, but the
rule stands just the same. It is no visible
advantage to the coal-sliovelling squadron to
drink at that particular time more than at
any other time, but it is viewed as an asser-
tion of manly independence, and it is an
item in the programme of “class warfare.”
Hopes are entertained of the arrival of a
blessed revolutionary time when no work of
any sort will be permitted to start until
every unionist has finished drinking, but
when that day comes both the drink and the
money to buy it with will probably be short.
In Queensland, where the railways seem to
have passed entirely out of the control of
their nominal owners, the late running of
trains has long been practised because those
responsible, instead of being fined, were paid
overtime. The latest narrative concerns a
train timed to set forth at noon, which was
set back by union orders till 4 p.m. for the
sake of overtime. At Fremantle, some little
time ago. 400 imported strikers, wljo had
been induced by imported characters to
strike here instead of in the distant country
where their alleged grievance lay, armed
themselves with lethal weapons and attacked
the wharves and the shipping. They were
routed and many arrests were made, because
the scanty police force, after suffering seri-
ous damage, abandoned the passive attitude
prescribed by the terrorised State Labor
Government and smote in self-defence. As
a result, half a dozen of the armed would-
be murderers were fined a trifle for “dis-
orderly conduct,” much as if they had. been
drinking beer on me footpath, and there are
suspicions that the fines have not been paid.
It is intended, in quarters which ought to
be inspected by the police, that a time shall
come when no man may earn a living unless
he belongs to a union, and when refusal to
join in any legal or illegal act commanded
by union authority will lead to expulsion and
the complete loss of living. Then the machine
of government will have wholly changed
hands. Against this wave of insurrection
the Commonwealth has hitherto made no
headway, because it hasn’t provided itself
either with the laws which it might have
passed or with the courts or gaols or police
which are handy in an emergency ; nor has
it cultivated the only attitude which makes
a lasting impression on the communists.
What the people think of the situation was
clearly indicated on November 14, and if
more power is required by the Government
in the light of the Walsii-Johanson judg-
ment the people will assuredly grant it.
DOLE-SEEKERS AND WORKERS.
The groat race movements of the world have
been due to two causes—the economic pres-
sure of an overpopulated country- and the
great fear that went before the footsteps of
a conquering race. The actual conquests
were in few cases race movements. Even the
enormous Tartar invasions of Russia did not
greatly alter the population of that land ; for
the waves of invaders quickly rolled back,
leaving only a rearguard to see that the tri-
bute was duly paid. The Saxon conquest
of England was probably on a much smaller
scale than has been supposed: and the de-
cided check to the advance after the battle
at Mount Badon suggests that there was no
numerical force that could maintain itself
against the organised Britons of the west.
At any rate, the invaders made no further
progress for half a century, and the British
elements left in the eastern part of the island
seem to have been very large. The various
conquests imposed new laws, new formulae of
government, new language and new religion
without in most cases seriously altering the
basis of population. What did alter the
basis of population was the fear of invasion.
There can be little doubt that the advancing
Saxons in Britain drove many Britons, who
could realise on their possessions, to other
countries, and that something of the same
sort could be traced in connection with the
invasions of Goths, Vandals and Franks on
the continent of Europe. It was doubtless
some similar kind of dread of an invader
in the rear that sent the great wave of Gauls
over Greece and Asia Minor. These people
were definitely moving with all their posses-
sions piled in their carts and living by
plunder as they tried to follow the line ot
least resistance into any sort of fairly habit-
able country. We know a little more accu-
rately about the flight southward of the
.-Egean people in a still earlier age; for they
descended in countless numbers on Egypt,
where they fought furiously for admission
and were hurled back to the coast of Pales-
tine to establish new cities and become known
as the Philistines. But even fear of a con-
queror was probably of less real importance
in changing the basis of population than the
migrations due to economic pressure. The
great modern migrations to America were
only part of a long-continued movement of
which history has taken very small account,
mostly because such migrations were con-
ducted in a wholly unspectacular way by
people who in twos and threes booked their
passages hither and thither with the idea of
getting more food, a better job or a climate
where they would be less subject to rheuma-
tism or plague.
* * * *
To-day there is great congestion of popu-
lation in certain countries, and a very badly
balanced world uses up half its energy in
trying to obtain its bread in the most dis-
advantageous way. Half Europe is uncom-
fortably crowded; and the open lands which
could receive the surplus population are at
distances that make it impossible to get
there by means of a fishing boat or a
donkey cart. There is not one promising
field for the bread-and-butter hunt which can
be reached in a month by a man who hoists
his swag in Belgium or Italy ; for the econo-
mic pressure is great over all Europe, and
the political restrictions are more serious than
in any previous age. The crusaders of the
First Crusade could carry their swags over
the Alps and down the Danube without find-
ing serious obstacles; and no doubt the man
who looked for a job ploughing or vine-dress-
incr could have followed the same course with
equal safety and discomfort. To-day he
would be asked to show his passport at all
frontiers and arrested as a vagrant as soon
as his cash ran low. Every country has
enough of his kind, and is jealous about keep-
ing the small jobs for its own hungry. Yet
Africa has huge spaces which a white man
has rarely seen, much of South America is
still short of human stock, and Australia has
only a fringe of settlement, some tassels of
unnecessary congestion and a few silent men
moving over huge regions of the interior to
keep the sheep and cattle from acquiring bad
manners. How the continent of Europe is
going to adjust its population difficulty is in
the main of' little more than academic interest
to Australians; but the case of Britain is
urgent, and on the face of the problem it
would seem that the Australian open spaces
are the natural home of the tens of thousands
who are treading upon one another in the
country which gave Australia its start. Since
the war it has become the British habit to
pay good money to people who do no work;
£300,000,000 has already been spent in this
way. A million people are walking about
viewing the scenery in that land of stubborn
will and dangerous experiment; and the
mutton to feed them is growing in the middle
of our continent, often at a greater distance
from the more thickly-populated centres of
Australia itself than the people who will eat
it are from the Mediterranean or the Baltic.
To bring the dinner for a perfectly idle man
from such a distance w-ould seem economically
insane when it is considered that the man
if taken to his dinner would be in the very
centre of a job of the biggest kind the white
race has ever tackled. But just there lies
the main difficulty. The man waiting for
that dinner is not of a type likely to seriously
tackle that job or even to understand that
it is a job ; and every day that he continues
to get his long-travelled dinner for nothing
he is likely to become still more unfitted for
such work. England could with great advan-
tage to the people who are at work there get
rid of the idle and semi-idle who are fed at
national expense. It would be much cheaper
to export them than to feed them; the danger
is that the burden of keeping them would be
merely transferred to Australia’s shoulders.
* * * *
The pick of Britain’s manhood would make
good and self-supporting settlers; the dole-
seekers would be for the most part thoroughly
useless in any country except Britain itself.
There with a certain amount of driving they
are capable of filling small places in the
industrial machine; here they would find the
conditions hard for work and pleasant for
resting, and would contrive to still exact a
dole, whether it was officially paid or not.
That fact is so patent that in any scheme of
migration it should be firmly laid down that
no dole-getter would be allowed to enter the
Commonwealth until he had been at least a
year in regular work in his own laud; and
even then it would be desirable to lay it
down that he should be in this, new land for
at least two years before he was entitled to
a citizen vote or to take any office whatever
in a labor union. What we need beyond
that is a definite scheme for attracting to
.Australia a steady inflow of England’s best.
If that should have the effect of lowering the
English standard for a generation or so it
can hardly be said that the blame would be
Australia’s. Britain itself is very largely
responsible for its conditions; and at bed-
rock the grand old fallacy of Freetrade is
the principal cause of the demoralising dole.
The real question before us is by what means
we can make our continent attractive to tilts
best British workers: and tin* answer is to
be found in the consideration of the real
causes of Britain's own economic pressure.
That pressure is due to lack of national
work; and the lack of national work is due
to the British habit of giving away jobs to
other nations. If Australia gets down to a
steady policy of doing all that can be done by
Australian hands, builds up a genuine pride
of industry and of wealth-producing energy
in every field, there can be no doubt about
the result in tin* matter of population. The
best workers will be attracted by the clear
indications that here is a living; moving
nation with full hands which offers the best
place for the best. All the wholesale schemes
for placing people here and dumping them
there must remain in the nature of doubtful
experiments. We can carry some of those ex-
periments, and possibly as we grow stronger
a few more of them; but they cannot be
looked to as the main solution of the pro-
blem. That solution lies in our own hands.
With adequate protection, sober industry
and a determination to make the best of
our huge resources we can win through. To
make the country attractive to the people we
should like to see here we must first make
it thoroughly attractive to ourselves.
HOLLYWOOD AND ASIA.
There are indications that when the police
in Java were startled out of their somnolence
by the news that an Australian woman had
been murdered in a hotel at Garoet and
that the murderer might prove to be a white
man, they did not want to find the culprit.
The effect of such a discovery on white pres-
tige, in a country where the white and part-
white are outnumbered by about 200 to 1,
might have been unhealthy, especially as the
Dutch have economised on their army and
navy to such an extent that white prestige
is to-day their chief instrument of rule.
They can take no risks that can possibly
be avoided, because the status of the white
demi-gods from overseas has been badly
undermined of late —they have, for example,
been driven to imprison communists galore
and deal sternly with the communists’ leader,
who happens to be a white man and the
descendant of that Decker who roused the
world to Dutch tyranny in Java with his
famous novel, “Max Havelaar,” some SO
years ago.
But the most dangerous upheavalists they
are powerless to deal with. These are the
irresponsible anarchists of Hollywood, wdio,
when the history of the twentieth century
comes to be written, will probably be credited
with doing more harm to white supremacy on
this troubled globe than all the clumsy
chicane of Bolshevik Russia. Twenty years
ago its first picture-show came to the remote
corner of Java in which I was then stationed.
It was a French production, America not
having realised the commercial possibilities
of debauching an entire planet; and it was
harmless enough. For 10 cents for a front
seat and three cents at the back of the
screen, a shed full of docile brown children
watched half a dozen white people, after over-
indulging in water-melon, fight for entrance
to a door marked “Retirade,” and the crowd
went home mildly wondering at the meaning
of the spectacle. The other day I stepped
into a glittering palace in a Javanese seaport
to see to what degree Hollywood had elevated
the native taste in the intervening years. It
was a strange sensation to sit in the scented
darkness of that theatre cheek-by-jowl with
Chinese, Arabs, Javanese, Soudanese and
Malays and watch the celluloid images of my
fellow-whites thieving, boozing and commit-
ting every form of gilded infamy that the
cultured minds of the Los Angeles bravos
could dredge out of their imagination or
personal experience. Soft “adoliais ’ of
astonishment and awed delight came
from the lips of a dainty bit of
painted porcelain at my left elbow; she
was the gundek or concubine of a Chinese
sugar-magnate, and doubtless she contrasted
in her unsophisticated mind the amazing
freedom of the lialf-dressed adulteresses on
the screen with her own state of chattel
slavery. A flat-faced man of mixed blood
noted with keen interest the expert way in
which a white “crook” of New York's
Bowery picked a lock and subsequently “put
a dozen cops to sleep.” A row of green-
turbaned Arabs, with noses like drawn
scimitars, stirred and murmured when a
vivid picture of France’s war with their
compatriots in Morocco rattled across the
screen, and the whole house seemed to hold
its breath as if the world was on the point
of ending when some enterprising service
of international news projected a confused
vision of soldiers chasing white rioters off
the streets of a European capital. That
assemblage of a score of fighting races had
not been subject to the European interloper
so long that they had forgotten the apocry-
phal glories of their days of independence,
and they probably saw the incident as the
final Armageddon of the whites. Violence
being done to whites, thanks to the energy
and enterprise of Hollywood’s advance-agents,
is now a familiar spectacle to the Asiatic:
it is available to him in almost every town of
any size in Asia.
It is hard for Australians who have only
known the free-and-easy relations of a white
democracy to realise the aloofness of Euro-
pean rule in colored countries. Hundreds of
Europeans never pass the word of day with
any native other than their room-boys ; and
in their attitude to them they drop with
comical ease into the role of lord and villein.
The vast majority of white women have
never been inside a native house, and even
white officials rule through the medium of
native clerks or hereditary chiefs. When a
white man takes a native woman into his
establishment he does it with the gesture of a
feudal baron, and when the woman returns to
her own kind she gains prestige for having
been a tuan’s mistress. It is into this world
of white supermen and native midgets that the
moving-picture nihilists have flung their
packets of high explosive.
One of tin 1 consequences is already seen
in the changing attitude of our brown and
yellow brothers towards such tacit assump-
tions of superiority as the White Australia


policy. It is hard to convince a decent,
law-abiding and well-educated gentleman
iu a yellow or tawny skin that, the Com-
monwealth is the habitat of a higher race
of mammals after he lias spent an evening
watching Hollywood’s white he-men behaving
like crooks and morons. It takes a lot of
argument to assure him that Australians
enjoy a happier and more comfortable life
than he when lie sees people of the same
genus on the screen involving themselves in
unpleasant complications unknown to liis
society. The white communities in Asia are
aware of the danger of this anti-white propa-
ganda, but they arc almost powerless to
oppose it. When Australia has a film in-
dustry—let us hope it will be a film art too
•—commensurate with her needs, one of her
most important duties will be to make a
counter-attack abroad against the Hollywood
offensive.
M. G. S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Cause of Solidarity.
The inquest on Labor’s defeat at tlie Federal
election continues, and so many hard things
are being said about so many comrades by
other comrades that the Labor camp isn’t a
conspicuously comfortable place to be in just
now. A particularly outspoken diagnosis of
the diseases that affect tlie party has been
given by C. L. Robinson, who blames
Charlton for “failing to impress the elec-
tors with our honesty of purpose,” and Lang
for “the way he is giving voice to our State
Labor policy,” and pleads for “an open
inquiry into the Tammany and corruption
that has so white-anted our once glorious
movement.” But all this is merely by way
of emphasising Robinson’s view that it is
inexpedient to harbor hostility to "the ex-
treme faction” and “the advanced element,”
since to do so is to divorce a “great body of
the industrial section” from the movement. A
Labor movement that does not admit all
schools of thought to its ranks, this critic
holds, must relinquish the claim that it
represents the workers of the country.
On the academic side there is something to
be said for the Robinson theory of all-
embracingness ; thoroughly applied it would
redeem the Labor party from the disability
of being so obviously and visibly a class
party. But it is doubtful whether unlimited
extensions would be good business politi-
cally ; certainly it has been proved that a
leaning to the revolutionary Left is very bad
business politically, and is too high a price
to pay for the appearance of solidarity. The
trouble is that Communism in the Labor
movement is very much like alcohol in the
system of the sort of people who oughtn’t to
take it. It soon becomes, not an incidental
but a central fact, to which everything else
must be oriented. The fitness of political
leaders, the usefulness of union officials and
the capacity of any individual to give loyal
and honest service to his fellows are made
subservient, in a communist-tainted Labor
party, to docile acceptance of communist
theory and practice. The only sort of soli-
darity acceptable to the communist is a
communist solidarity, and a Labor party
with a communist wing has no more chance
of achieving solidarity on any other terms
than a laboratory novice has of mixing
nitric acid and glycerine without promoting
a grand explosion.
Speeding Up.
Five minutes by the town clock after the
Federal Treasurer had got his own renewal
loan out of the way he was arranging to
raise another £5,100,000 of new money for
the five Loan Council States, and to back
their lOU’s for that amount. N. S. Wales,
being an unsociable Nark, proposes to bor-
row, on its dignity, separately. In addition
to this all the States are on, or going on, or
just coming off, the London market for gold
loans with which to pay interest abroad, so
the prospect of a meeting of Australia’s
creditors one of these days is becoming quite
bright. The four years from June, 1920. to
June, 1924, were years of activity. In 1920
only a single State (Westralia) had a net
liability exceeding £IOO per inhabitant, and it
owed £ll9 12s. 4d. The peace debts of tlie six
States then averaged £76 10s. 4d., this being
the result of some 70 years’ effort. By 1924
five. States out of the six had passed the £IOO-
- mark; the most embarrassed State
(Westralia) owed £l4B 3s. 4d. for each in-
habitant; and the average liability was £99
10s. It probably averaged £lO5 last June,
but the figures are not complete yet, and it
will probably average the very devil next
June. Only Victoria has failed to score its
century. ' France, in the roaring days of high
finance before the Revolution, showed the
same thing on a bigger scale, but hardly
bigger according to the respective sizes of
the communities. Among the results have
been a certain hectic prosperity, suggestive
of the flush upon the cheek of a woman
corned and the reflection from her golden
teeth; a growing tendency to do less work,
because work seems less and less essential
with money coming in at such a rate and
being mistaken for real income; and a grow-
ing confidence among the worst revolutionary
elements, who expect the collapse of the
house of cards to furnish an unrivalled op-
portunity. Whatever the climax may be,
Australia will always be able to say that
it had a boshter time.
Sweated Auditors-General.
The S.A. Audit Act was amended the other
day to admit of the Auditor-General being
awarded a rise of £2OO p.a. from July 1. In
introducing the bill, Attorney-General
Denny explained that the salary was fixed
by statute at £BOO p.a. and had not been
altered since 1907, although the heads of
other Government departments had received
considerable increases in the course of the
17 years. Denny might have added that
what the Auditor-General could have bought
for 17s. lid. at Adelaide in 1907, according
to the Commonwealth Statistician’s calcu-
lations. would have cost him 335. lOd.
in 1924. but the Minister did not enlarge on
the subject, being probably ashamed of liis
State’s parsimony. If there is one indispen-
sable public office it is that of the Auditor-
General : yet, compared with other Govern-
ment employees whose work is much less
onerous and important, the people’s financial
watchdog is shamefully underpaid. The
Westralian A.-G., who has to wrestle with
the accounts of numerous State enterprises
in addition to the ordinary duties of the
position, is also on the sweating rate of
£<Boo p.a. The man in the Speck gets £BSO,
the Queenslander £IOOO, the Victorian
£1250 and the N.S.W. man the same.
The Commonwealth Auditor-General was
appointed in January, 1902, at £IOOO p.a.
and remained at that figure until a couple
of years ago, when he was granted a com-
passionate allowance, or something of the
sort, of £SOO p.a. Before the allowance came
along he was drawing less than a young man
40 years his junior who, having been pri-
vate" secretary to W. M. Hughes, was made
secretary to the superfluous Prime Minister’s
Department at £1250 p.a., since increased to
£I3OO. Even now the veteran Israel, who
has 220 officers under him, and whose sur-
vey of the Commonwealth’s financial opera-
tions extends from Melbourne to Loudon and
from Perth to Port Moresby, receives £IOOO
p.a. less than the Chairman of the Public
Service Board and £SOO p.a. less than (1)
each other member of that body, (2) the
Public Service Arbitrator, and (3) “the
Official Secretary of the Commonwealth of
Australia in Great Britain,” to give the title
in all its glory. The last-mentioned gentle-
man was also private secretary to a Prime
Minister (before that he was a post-office
clerk), and was thence promoted to the
absurd Prime Minister’s Department, which
has no counterpart in other countries, and
which seems to have been created for his
especial benefit. In fact, the young civil
servant who aspires to a more or less am-
bassadorial position at a large salary may
be confidently recommended to get himself
appointed private secretary to the head of
the Government or some pushing Minister
who lias prospects of becoming head of the
Government. But if he joins the Audit De-
partment, Heaven help him!

Premier Gunn Considers the Film
Octopus.
S. Aus. Premier Gunn is not going on with
his plan for securing some contribution to
the cost of governing his State from the
foreign film interest, which has had the loan
of this country’s leg for years. Gunn’s
idea was to clap a tax of Is. in' the £on (10
p.c. of the amount paid for the hire of films,
the showman being empowered to deduct the
equivalent of the tax from the price agreed
upon with the other party to the contract,
who was to be allowed a corresponding
deduction in his income-tax return, if any.
But on reflection the head of the Labor Gov-
ernment decided that his proposals would
not hit the slippery foreigners aimed at,
whose film business with S. Aus. is chiefly
transacted by post:—
It is not possible for the S. Aus. Government to get
any income-tax from these people. In contracts now
being made the full hire figure has to be paid by the
hirer, notwithstanding anything contained in State
legislation. It is obvious therefore that if a tax
were levied, the hirer would pass it on to his patrons.
It would virtually be an additional amusement-tax,
and we do not propose to tax the public further.
Yet Gunn is convinced that “people who
export films from, America to Australia, and
earn a very large income thereby, are not
paying their share of income-tax, if they are
paying any income-tax at all.” According to
his information (“and I have no reason to
doubt it,” he adds) the oracle is worked by
setting a fictitious value on a film—
“ Doped Darlings,” it may be, or “The Sala-
cious Sheik” —with the result that, although
Australian contracts may bring in £20,000,
“no profits are shown.” Gunn complains that
“the Federal Government has not moved in
the matter.” It is a just complaint, for the
Federal Government should have taken dras-
tic action long ago, not only by rendering
it impossible for the foreigner to escape
taxation on his Australian profits, but by so
adjusting the tariff that an increasing pro-
portion of films (and those better in every
way than the frequently vile foreign
article) will be produced in the Common-
wealth. In 1923-24 20.040,746 feet of ex-
posed or developed films came into Aus-
tralia. 19,102.141 feet being of U.S. origin.
On that 20,040,746 feet a mere £109,631
was paid in Customs duties (lid. per foot on
foreign stuff), and the £109,631 was no
doubt passed on. If the tariff was raised to
Is. per foot, most of the films exhibited in
Australian theatres would be made by Aus-
tralian companies. Such companies would
provide clever Australians with work of
w hich they are now deprived ; their produc-
tions would promote healthy Australian
sentiment, instead of inspiring the young
film-fancier to become a Hollywood moron or
crook; and they could not avoid paying
income-tax on their profits, whereas foreign-
ers find avoidance as easy as lapping up
bootlegged whisky. In view of the S. Aus.
Premier’s statements, the Federal Treasurer
should certainly instruct his Taxation Com-
missioner to put some intimate questions
to foreigners in the film business, and just
as certainly should the Minister of Customs
include an effective film duty in the tariff
schedule with which Parliament will shortly
wrestle. Meanwhile Gunn suggests that it
might be possible for N. S. Wales to move
by taxing the gross income of the foreign
film gentry who exploit the Australian
market from Sydney. It is a “comrade’s”
broad hint to Premier Lang, and that roar-
ing gentleman would assuredly be more use-
fully engaged in tackling the film octopus
than in trying to persuade the public that
he doesn’t read his Own newspaper.
Spoils to the Burglar.
The law respecting unlawful possession is so
loose in Queensland that a motor-’bus laden
with stolen goods can be driven through it.
A ten-times convicted thief may have his
house full of stolen goods, but unless these
goods can be identified by the owners they
remain the property of the thief. If the
goods are found in the prisoner’s possession
in the street, he may be called upon to prove
that he came by them lawfully; if they are
found in his house he does not have to nrove
lawful possession—the onus of proof falls on
the prosecution. It frequently happens that
it is impossible to obtain the necessary proof,
though there may be no reasonable doubt
that the goods were stolen. Goods stolen
from the wharves, for instance, cannot be
identified by the consignees who have not re-
ceived them. In a case which came before
the courts a few months ago, a convicted
thief who was given a long term of imprison-
ment for stealing had in his possession a
large quantity of goods, manifestly stolen,
but not the subject of the charges
on which he was convicted. The Judge
said he had no doubt that these goods
were stolen, as alleged by the police. The
police took the opinion of the Crown Law
Department as to what was to be done with
the articles. The reply was that they must be
returned to the thief or his nominees. Goods
found in the possession of a prisoner, and
not identified by other owners, must be re-
turned to the prisoner or his nominees, no
matter how strongly theft may be suspected!
It is a law which safeguards the burglar, the
cargo-pilferer and the shoplifter in the posses-
sion of his spoils. For years past the police
officials have been calling for an amendment
of the law to give them at least an equal
chance with the thieves, but Ministers have
turned a deaf ear. Queensland Judges are
continually remarking on the influx of
southern burglars. Perhaps the law as to
unlawful possession supplies the reason.
The Stage Managers.
Dear Bulletin, —The ancient history of
Canberra sketched under the heading “Set-
ting the Stage” (B. 26/11/’25) is interest-
ing, but the recent records are more thrill-
ing. Canberra is, directly or indirectly, the
offspring of lying, meanness, bad faith and
parochial bigotry. George Reid, taking up
the Federal cause which he loathed in order
to dish Parkes, found the thing on his hands
when Parkes, being dead, required dishing
no longer. He connived at, if lie didn’t engi-
neer, a breakage of the agreement lie had
made with the other States, and tried to
secure the rejection of tlie F'ederal Consti-
tution by demanding what, it was hoped,
would be an impossibly large minimum vote
as a condition of acceptance in the Ma State.
He stumped the State as an anti-Federalist;
but when he realised that he was backing the
wrong horse he became again an admirer of
the Constitution, barring one or two alleged
defects. In tlie process of repair he pro-
cured the insertion in hole-and-corner fashion
of two new devices—one of them to secure
that the Federal capital should be in N.S.W.,
and also on land which wasn’t in N.S.W.,
having been taken out. Promptly a heroic
cat-fight of vested interests, land and politi-
cal, set in. The State Parliament of Joseph
Carruthers (Joseph was a real individual
once, and not a myth or a legend) got busy
in both Houses, and affirmed two things.
One was that N.S.W., in addition to the sole
right of supplying a capital site for the
continent, had the further right of choosing
that site. The other was that the area sur-
rendered must be a minimum for size—so
small that the unearned increment created
by the investment of Australia’s money
would necessarily spread largely into N.S.W.
and enrich some fortunate inhabitants there-
of. The Federal Government got a Commis-
sion to work early on the inspection of pro-
mising scenes, and the candidates were clas-
sified in two groups, the first including
Albury, Tumut, Orange, Lyndliurst, Armi-
dale (this was the only look-in that the
North had) and Bathurst; and the second
Lake George, Bombala and Dalgety. Later
the Commission gave a solid vote for Dal-
gety by reason of its water power and other
advantages. Yass was treated with scorn,
while Canberra and Queanbeyan, of which it
is now a suburb, were not even mentioned.
Finally there emerged from somewhere under-
ground a new site with the double-barrelled
name of Yass-Canberra, and, the N.S.W.
State Government condescending to approve,
this mixed place arrived. Yass is some 40
miles from Canberra and about 28 miles
from the nearest part of the Federal capital
territory, so it can’t be said to be in the
picture at all. Queanbeyan, also in N.S.W.,
is very much in the picture, for the Federal
city is so close up to a corner of the 900
square miles of Federal territory that the con-
necting railway is less than five miles long,
and beer can be smelled across the inter-
vening strip. Land on the Queanbeyan side
of the boundary line, formerly sheep or
rabbit country, has been sold by the foot,
not only to local people, but as far away as
London, and the possibilities of the case were
illustrated to the coy Cockney with the
assurance that frontages to Castlereagh-
street, Sydney, had realised £1577 per foot,
or nearly £1,000.000 per acre. Land has
been sold at Jervis Bay, where the Common-
wealth owns an isolated scrap of soil with
the right to join it by railway (about 140
miles long) with the capital proper. Lately
an unfortunate Sydney butcher, who had
speculated at the Bay not wisely but too
well, was made bankrupt through failure to
keep up the instalments. Probably N.S.W.
land will be sold along the 140-mile railway
if it is constructed, for the financial aroma
of the capital spreads. There is even a little
bustle of land-dealing on Twofold Bay, pos-
sibly with the idea that the settlement of
Canberra may lead to the completion of the
dead-end N.S.W. line which passes its door.
Nobody takes the trouble now to profess that
Canberra was selected because any authori-
tative body declared it the best site, or the
fifth best site, and it is hardly mentioned as
a possible aid to the settlement, in any ex-
tensive way, of any empty region. It is
rather viewed as a place where the inhabi-
tants will be paid overtime rates for being
inhabitants. But much profit has been made
out of it by N.S.W. capitalists, and more
is coming.—Yours, Solomon M.
Journalism and the University.
Dear Bulletin, —The proposal to establish
a course in journalism at Sydney University
and to grant a diploma in that art or science
or whatever it may be is doubtless well-
intentioned; but' it has a French-before-
breakfast and inquire-within look about it
which may make a good many people scep-
tical as to its value. The business of the
journalist is a bit wider than life and a
shade deeper than experience, and is learned
in a school with class-rooms in the slums,
the jungle and the stars; and, this being so,
it is not remarkable that, with a few bril-
liant exceptions, university men have proved
particularly bad journalists. As matters
stand, tlic University is necessarily pedantic;
and the one solid rule of journalism is that,
whatever else it is, it must not be pedantic.
There are classes at all Universities which
might tend to make those journalists who
take them better craftsmen ; there are Uni-
versity courses which end in degrees avail-
able to journalists as to others; but there
is no apparent course in journalism, in its
widest sense, which could do otherwise than
give the student a pedantic smattering of
many things and generally shoal up the deeps
of learning in a way which is good for
neither the man nor his readers. The
essence of all true knowledge is a knowledge
of limitations. No man can be quite sure
what he does know; but a full understanding,
of what he does not know is very sound
learning. The trouble about a University,
from a journalist’s point of view, is that it
must be sure of its knowledge or make a
very hrm pretence of being so ; the strength
of successful journalism lies in the fact that
it is not sure, but is always willing to go
and look. The University takes stock of
its wares once in a half-century or so ; jour-
nalism is taking stock all the time, not of
its own wares alone, but of everybody else’s
as well. In the training of a young jour-
nalist the probabilities are that three years
on a farm or three years on an ocean-going
ship or three years in a big war are all
preferable to a three years’ course in Uni-
versity-set subjects conducted by excellent
and learned men who could never themselves
be journalists. Yet the proposal at present
in the public eye is not to be lightly dis-
missed. There is no special reason why the
staffs of a daily newspaper should be on a
lower level of general culture than the mem-
bers of a carpenters’ union—a state of affairs
which has sometimes been the case in the
past. In an English-speaking country the
first requirement of a journalist is a decent
knowledge of the English language; and the
painful fact is fairly obvious that many of
our Australian publications are not written
in decent English. But can a University
remedy this? The equally painful fact must
be recorded that only a very few text-books
written by University men for students are
produced in decent English. That appears
to strike at the very root of the matter; and
it would seem that one of the most im-
portant jobs of the press, as the mouthpiece
of the public, should be to insist that the
Universities select educated men —not merely
so-called experts of long training—for their
teaching staffs. To put the matter plainly,
most of the best University men would be
mere lisping children compared with the
best journalists in putting any matter accu-
rately. quickly and convincingly before the
general reader. So the proposal should not
be lightly pushed aside; for there are the
possible seeds of true University reform in
the scheme. Once a University gets down
to the plain task of working out what it
should teach young journalists it may dis-
cover a great deal about itself. —Yours, Old
Blue Pencil.
A Den of Thieves.
“Te Babarantiko” : Agents in Sydney muni-
cipal fruit and vegetable markets are said to
be perturbed over the legislation now being
enacted for their control. Tlie agents occupy-
ing these markets are no -worse and no better
than consignors and customers; and con-
signors’ shipments should be controlled no
less than agents’ methods. The whole atmo-
sphere is bad ; during some months of whole-
sale buying in the markets I found that, with
some exceptions, ordinary business ethics do
not apply. Desire to establish a reputation
and a connection seems lacking. The one
purpose is to sell, no matter the condition of
the produce, at the highest possible price. It
is apparently argued that the same buyer
might never buy of that agent again, and if
he did he’d probably have forgotten that he’d
been taken down. Customers are no better
than consignors and agents. In the fruit
section cases are opened for the inspection
of buyers, who usually bite into a fruit “to
try it,” thus continually diminishing the con-
tents. Everyone seems to chew fruit; some
undoubtedly breakfast gratis on “samples.”
Cases of rotting stone fruit stacked prepara-
tory to being emptied into the City Council
lorries for conveyance to the tip are pros-
pected by unsavory men on the chance of find-
ing a few sound peaches for hawking. Cases
of apples stencilled with growers’ names are
sold at big prices, though sometimes every
expensive apple is inhabited by codliu moth:
others have “brown heart,” as the consignors
must have known perfectly well, for the fruit
went direct from the orchards to the markets.
Wholesale vegetable “Johns” are expert at
“topping off” new potatoes and tomatoes,
thus rooking their customers. Meanwhile the
agent himself must be unceasingly vigilant to
avoid being taken down by tlie small pur-
chaser. Once when I was buying at a Con-
fucian’s stall a quite nice sort of woman-
buyer sidled about, spreading her skirt and
screening me from the stallkeepcr in a way
that puzzled me until she looked back over
her shoulder and, smiling pleasantly, whis-
pered: “Did you get some?” With such
methods in vogue it is not surprising that
the Chinese never hestitate to demand that a
customer’s bag be emptied for inspection, nor
do they apologise when suspicions prove un-
founded. The regulation of the agents is all
right. But the whole business wants purify-
ing.
Licensing the Newsboy.
The Vic. Government, in its Street Trading
Bill, proposes to give the State some rights
of supervision over newsboys. A Board is to
be set up, presided over by a magistrate,
and with a representative of the Neglected
Children’s Department as a member, to con-
sider applications for permits made by
youngsters who desire to purvey the morning
malediction or the afternoon atrocity. The
proposal, of course, has aroused a good deal
of indignation. The mothers of newsboys
have been rounded up and assembled in halls,
and long-winded resolutions have been unani-
mously agreed to. The grounds of the pro-
test in such cases are that the newsboys are
not criminals nor neglected children, that
their parents are buying things on time-
payment and will have to default if their
sons are denied licenses, and that if a Board
is to be appointed it is wrong to deny the
newspapers representation upon it. The ob-
jections are not impressive. The newsboy, like
certain other features of metropolitan life, is
largely a product of poverty. In the ideal

city lie would not exist. The plea that
restrictions on him mean a restriction of the
earnings of the poor, effective though it
sounds, is the sort of plea that has stood
athwart every step of the road from the
bestial industrial conditions of a century ago,
and it has continually been proved to be
founded on fallacy. The newsboy’s method
of adding to his family’s income is objection-
able not on the ground that lie is too young
to work, but because he plies his calling
without control or discipline and amid sur-
roundings that no one outside a lunatic
asylum would choose as a suitable environ-
ment for the formation of good character.
Whether a State-appointed Board, headed by
a chairman as remote from newsboys as the
average P.M. is, will achieve much good by
selecting the juveniles who are to take the
risk of ruin through news-running is a very
moot point. Approval of the move, until it
is seen how licensing works, can only be
given on the broad ground that it indicates
appreciation of the existence of a social
danger. That the newsboy is a social danger
can hardly be doubted. 1 listory records that
certain men rose to eminence from such a
commencement, but police-court records, if
they were analytical enough, could present
another side to the medal of portentous

Education in Victoria.
A recent deputation from the A.N.A. to
the Vic. Minister of Education submitted
several interesting proposals for the exten-
sion of technical education throughout the
State, the principal being the establishment
of correspondence classes for students and
the equipment of a travelling technical
school and a similar domestic-arts school,
something after the style of the “better-
farming” train. There is nothing wrong with
any of these suggestions; but they touch
only the fringe of the problem of the higher
education of country boys and girls. The
Department has endeavored to supply their
needs by providing higher elementary
classes attached to the primary schools in
various country towns; but these classes
merely continue to a higher degree the aca-
demic lessons of the primary classes. Of
instruction practically useful '■here is very
little. Some of the schools rtainly boast
a sloyd room or a cookery class ; but far more
than that is needed. Since a farmer now-
adays has to be a business man and an
engineer or mechanic as well as a mere
tiller of the soil, the farmer's son needs to
learn farm book-keeping, commercial corres-
pondence, plumbing, tinsmithing, metal-work,
carpentry, blacksmithing and farm-engineer-
ing, with special reference to the petrol-
driven and suction-gas engines. The girls,
too, need to learn more than mere cooking:
indeed, as part of their home-life they usually
learn to be fair cooks before they are 14.
At school they need to be taught dressmaking,
millinery, home and personal hygiene, and
other domestic arts and sciences. Corres-
pondence tuition, coupled with observa-
tion-trains, certainly offers many more
advantages than are apparent under the
present system; yet it will not go far,
since technical, like any other branch of
education, must be continuous to be really
successful. The true remedy is at hand
without recourse to anything spectacular.
The present high elementary schools, and
all other schools centred in convenient
country towns, should be turned into consoli-
dated schools equipped for the three divisions
of education, where children will be daily
conveyed from the surrounding farms for
instruction not merely in primary subjects,
but right up to the intermediate-certificate
standard for those who desire to qualify
for clerical positions in life, and to the
highest standard reached by the present
junior technical and domestic-arts schools
for the great majority. For the few who
will proceed farther still, the high schools
and senior technical colleges offer legiti-
mate satisfaction. As a natural concomitant,
the leaving age must be raised from 14 to 16.
But, as Alexander Peacock told the depu-
tation, these schemes cost money, and that
is the rock on which most proposals for im-
proved educational methods go smash.

“Dingo” : The statement made by “W.H.E.”
(B. 3/12/’25) that the milk of “obviously
diseased” cows goes into consumption is made
periodically by all sorts and conditions of
people, invariably those who have no qualifi-
cation or experience to guide them. But
when the officials whose business it is to see,
inter alia, that only “eye sound” cows are
milked ask that a concrete case be submitted
(in confidence), they are met with a stony
silence. There are, apparently, thousands of
cases in general, but not one in particular.
The inspectors of the N.S.W. Department of
Public Health and the Stock Branch of the
Department of Agriculture visit dairies at all
hours (their favorite time for a visit is dur-
ing milking), but the numbers of “obviously
diseased” animals found are few and far be-
tween. During the early part of 1924 the
Stock Branch raided dairies wholesale in the
metropolitan area and closely inspected thou-
sands of milking cows, practically without
finding, a diseased beast. “W.11.E.” says:
“There are few dairy herds that can success-
fully pass a bacteriological test.” If he
means the tuberculin test he is right, and
would be equally right about almost every
dairy herd in the world. But if he means the
microscopic examination of milk, which is,
after all, the main thing, lie will be flatly
contradicted by the bacteriologists of the De-
partment of Public Health who arc continu-
ally making such examinations. As regards
the question of tubercular meat, it may in-
terest “W.H.E.” to know that the flesh of
animals that have suffered from tuberculosis
is passed for consumption by the State abat-
toirs and, incidentally, by every other abat-
toirs on earth. Where tuberculosis, actino-
mycosis or cancer is localised, the portion
affected is removed and the remainder of the
BLONDIN UP TO DATE.
carcase passed for consumption. Where
disease is generalised (not a very common
condition when the numbers handled is taken
into consideration) the whole carcase is con-
demned. If “W.H.E.” is still doubtful he
can go to Flemington yards on any Monday
or Thursday and see “suspect” cattle, a large
proportion of which are tubercular, sold at
practically normal prices, or he may read any
standard work on meat inspection.

“Old Unionist” : Most unions have got
past the stage when they paid “honorary
auditors” half a guinea each to have a look
at such books as the secretary presented and
to certify that they were correct; but queer
things can still happen. Witness the affairs
of the Goulburn (N.S.W.) Eight Hours
Association. The mix-up here was so bad
that even the honorary auditors discovered
and reported on the shortage, while imputing
no dishonesty to a secretary “who had got
his books into a hopeless muddle and could
not make head or tail of them.” The sec-
retary himself optimistically remarked that,
though he was no book-keeper, there was no
cause for alarm. Maybe he is right ; but
the actions of people who are no book-keepers
yet secure jobs where there is book-keeping
to be done are often remarkable. It de-
volved upon me once to report that a certain
union’s funds were short by a large amount,
the secretary, when asked for an explanation,
having reserved his defence, so to speak.
The official faced a meeting, rendered angry
by the news, with the utmost cheerfulness.
“As a matter of fact, gentlemen,” he ex-
plained, “I lent £2OO of the funds to Bob
Scratchem, who had had a bad spin with
his pony Alsoran and was up against it, but
reckoned he could get clear if lie had the
money for another go.” Loud cheers greeted
this announcement of his altruistic behavior.
“Unfortunately the pony lost again; but,
for my part, I'm not sorry at what I done.
Give a man a chance, I say.” At that the
applause was loud and prolonged, and the
promptly-proposed motion that the secretary
should be granted an honorarium of £2OO to
cover the amount of the shortage was carried
unanimously. At the next elections that
secretary secured additional votes for having
been a good fellow, and his opponent was
almost declared “black” for having remarked
that the incident showed that the good
fellow was unlit to look after the union’s
affairs.

John Drayman reports a birthday party:
Tasmania has celebrated the centenary of its
“Independence Day” in a mild manner. Beyond a
reference in Parliament by Acting-Premier Guy and
Opposition-leader McPhee and a few impai'tial com-
ments and comparisons by Deputy-Speaker Woods,
the centenary was not pushed into the public, eye
by the Legislature. The Royal Society, with botanist
Leonard Rodway in the chair, gave a dinner to
prominent personages; but the speeches were neither
inflammatory, declamatory nor magnificently inspiring.
Statistician Giblin and Denis Butler, the chief
speakers, made some interesting remarks on the out-
standing historical events which had occurred since
December, 1825, but neither waxed eloquent over the
progress made in the century towards material pros-
perity. Indeed, Giblin rather pointedly suggested
that it might be as well to seek cause for congratu-
lation in quite other directions than that of the
facilities offered by Tasmania for the production of
great wealth —such, for instance, as the excellent
field a small State offers for experiments in political
and social reform. They might even experiment with
a soviet form of government (consternation) ; at any
rate, they might concentrate on a bit of useful town-
planning, at the same time prohibiting the erection
of such pretentious uglinesses as, say, the Athenseum
Club and the Mercury buildings (modified cheers).
Opposition-leader McPhee enhanced the general un-
joyousness of the gathering by quoting from a
century-old Hobart Gazette the account of tne
hanging, on December 2, 1825, of 24 men at the
old gaol in Macquarie-street. And, last of all,
President Rodway deplored the fact that the century
had witnessed the complete disappearance of the
original owners of the soil; a most interesting race
had vanished without leaving even a poor half-dozen
of their skeletons to embellish the local museum.

“Larrapinta” : “Buttenderry,” writing
about our next drought (B. 2(3/11-5), strikes
a mucli-needed note of warning; but there is
one piece of drought-insurance he omitted to
mention. Pit silos are excellent for storing
surplus feed, hut surface water is liable to
drain into them, rendering their contents
useless. Over-ground silos are better, but
very costly to build and a labor to fill. Hay-
stacks are always liable to be destroyed by
fire, and mice play havoc with them. The
champion staudby is to plant the banks of
every dam and watercourse with willows.
They are easy to plant—-green sticks cut from
willow are simply driven into moist soil
and left, and 90 per cent, will grow—and
are fire- and mouse-proof. During the 1914
drought one S.A. pastoralist who had the
foresight to plant every creek on liis property
with willows was rewarded by bringing 75
per cent, of his flock through without auy
expense save the trifling one of cutting the
trees down. His neighbors either brought
themselves to the verge of bankruptcy by
buying hay or killed off all but a few of
their best sheep and left these to battle,
through.

Sydney City Council has sent on to the
State Parliament a unanimous request that
legislation should be passed to bring into
effect the Greater Sydney which has been
discussed for a quarter of a century. A
referendum of ratepayers will be necessary,
but, in spite of some dread about the mis-
management likely to result from a domi-
nant Labor majority, samples of which the
citizens of Sydney have already had, the
scheme lias so many virtues —-especially in
the creation of a central authority to construct
arterial roads —that it ought to go through.
The scheme provides for the amalgamation
under one civic administration of all the areas
on the Sydney peninsula between the harbor
and Botany Bay, with a boundary going no
further south and west than Cook’s River and
that salubrious waterway the Leichhardt
canal. The wider proposal should give the
death-knock to the nefarious proposal
to absorb Waterloo and give that district,
which should be entitled to only two repre-
sentatives on its voting strength, four aider-
men —a barefaced plot to augment the Labor
strength in the City Council.

Not for nothing has Australia maintained
a High Commissioner in the U.S.A. for the
last dozen years. They begin to know us
quite well. One Emanuel Hertz, “attorney
and counsellor at law,” of Broadway, New
York, writes to this paper to say that he is
making an earnest effort to “bring to the
attention of the entire world” the 117tli anni-
versary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.
He therefore proposes to send us a copy of
an address which he will broadcast from
New York on Old Abe’s natal day, and he
will let us have it right early, so that it may
be “translated into your own language.”
There is a job-printing order attached to the
transaction —a little reprint of the address —
on which The Bulletin is invited to in-
scribe, “in addition to the title in your lan-
guage, the English name — ‘Abraham Lin-
coln. by Emanuel Hertz.’ ” If Emanuel’s
notions of biography are as original as his
ideas about geography and ethnology his
piece about Abraham will be warmly wel-
comed.

“N.Q.”; When is it going to be possible to
buy prints of the best pictures in the Mel-
bourne Gallery? Surely it is not too much
to ask for decent copies of the Corot, the
Van Eyck and the new Raeburn! It is not
as if Australian printers were not good.
They can photograph and reproduce any-
thing, plain or colored- —especially for adver-
tising purposes. Take up any one of several
elegant Australian magazines, and you will
find they consist mainly of specimens of
printers’" “stunts,” with a few pages of
articles thrown in. Wouldn’t the printer
be just as willing to operate on the repro-
duction of some of the finest pictures in the
world? For it is a fact that the Felton Be-
quest is gradually securing for Melbourne
what Europe is very sorry to lose. All over
the world Melbourne is envied for its oppor-
tunity. So far the pictures are wretchedly
housed, huddled in meaningless association
on ill-lit walls. But they are there, and it
copies of them were obtainable the country
which can’t come to Melbourne could enjoy
them, and perhaps the city would in time
insist that a better gallery, with alcoves and
good lighting, should be available to do the
pictures justice.

POLITICAL
POINTS
So far from endorsing the conduct of
Walsh, Johanson and other strike-leaders,
the High Court’s decision makes the pro-
ceedings of those people all the more inex-
cusable, Half the talk of the strike-fomenters
in defence of direct action has been about
t! ciaSS-COnseious” Judges—they couldn’t trust
Judges, and therefore they couldn’t trust
arbitration; they could only trust “the
YytirkersJ’ Now comes a decision which
Shows that there is not one single Judge of
the very highest court in land—the ulti-
mate court of appeal—-who is not prepared
to do exactly what the Walshes and Johan-
sons have said they wouldn’t trust even a
majority of the Judges to do.
By 33 votes to 28 Prendergast’s no-confi-
dence motion was rejected by Vic. Assembly,
but Labor scored a moral victory over the
Allan-Peacock Ministry all the same. Labor
hoped that it might tempt four Ministerial-
ists to desert. They didn’t, but more than
four talked of the possibility of luring Law-
son to lead on the non-Labor side again.
Lawson isn’t disposed to oblige. Nothing but
a unanimous non-Labor call and pledge of
support on essentials would induce him to
step out of the ranks. His recollection of
the bad treatment he got 20 months ago is
still keen.
The electoral problem which has been
haggled over lately in Victoria is as old as
it is tough. The drift to the city is so great
that the lack of country members begins to
look ridiculous ; on the other hand the lack,
of constituents also looks ridiculous. There is
need, as a matter of cold logic, for a redis-
tribution of seats; but there is a thousand
times more need for a redistribution of popu-
lation, lest the country should be divided
into a slum and a wilderness. But no one
takes any visible real interest in that.
Bax-well, S.A. Premier for four years and
Opposition-leader since, is to be a candidate
for the Senate seat vacated by the late J. V.
O’Loglilin, and Joel Moses Gabb, the reject
of Angas, will be the Labor nominee. Bar-
well will px-obably win, for the Libs, and the
Cockies are now on cordial terms, and there
are 36 in the two Houses, allowing for Bar-
well’s empty chair, against 30 Laborites;
but there will be no glory in such a victory.
An ex-Premier who is not yet 50 should have
faced the Federal electoi-s (he could have got
a nomination) instead of relying on the favor
of 16 Leg. Councillor's.
“If Bruce did the decent thing he would
resign,” the swollen-headed Walsh said after
the High Court had decided what the law
was in the deportation matter. Walsh forgets
that Bi-uce asked for and got a mandate to
do all things necessary to rid Australia of
persistent makers of industrial tx-ouble after
the Deportation Act had been passed and
the proceedings taken against Walsh and
Johanson. If Bruce had been satisfied with
the authority he had he wouldn’t have asked
for the mandate; it was for authority to
take other measures, if necessary, that he
went to the country. And the country said
“Go ahead.”
After stubbornly maintaining for 70 years
that it has a divine right to amend or throw
out money bills, the Speck’s Uppah Cliam-
bah has unbent to the extent of suggesting
that the Assembly should join with it in
setting up a committee to define the
powers of the two Houses in such matters
and provide a means of settling future
squabbles. The proposal, which has been
accepted, staves off the impending alterna-
tive of au appeal to the Privy Council, which
is rather a pity.
Even if it hadn’t turned out a mare’s nest,
as seems likely, there is some cant in the
indignation of the Pai-is papers over the
alleged discovery of a British plot to spy
into France’s aviation secrets by a British
trio assisted by an artist’s model. Every-
body knows that every country’s defence
requires a knowledge of what every other
country is doing in a military way, and that
the polite interest isn't confined to potential
enemies. Baden Powell made that quite
clear during the war, when he boasted of
Jus secret-service exploits in Turkey at a time
that country was believed to be a friend of
Britain. It is also all in the game for a
country to disown its poor devils of agents
when they allow themselves to be caught.
The only crime in espionage is being found
out.
The Vic. Compo. Government creeps into
recess shattered in morale. The effort to
foist prematurely on to the country a Redis-
tribution of Seats Bill that didn’t redistribute
met with small approval, and gave the Labor
Opposition the opportunity of launching a
sham no-confidence motion. To prevent
the rest of his legislative chickens being left
oil the roost for Christmas Premier Allan
had to withdraw the measure. The refusal
to give the Blarney case a judicial airing is
another action that is likely to have serious
consequences for the Ministry. Nationalists
are beginning to regard their gift of the
Premiership and six portfolios to the Coun-
try party as an act of hasty generosity.
FLOATING.
“The last-minute rush to contribute to the Commonwealth £67,000,000 conversion loan has filled
Federal Treasurer Page with joy. Nearly £22,000,000 of the total is new cash.”
EARLE PAGE: “Look, John — he's floating!”
JOIIN BULL: “Yes. I see. When will he be able to swim?"
A matter on which the Federal Govern-
ment hasn’t broken the speed-limit is in
regard to reciprocity with the Shivery Isles
on the subject of old-age pensions. The
M.L. Parliament put through a Reciprocity
Act 12 years ago, and Prime Minister Coates
stated recently that “repeated representa-
tions have been made to successive Govern-
ments in Australia” urging the necessity for
a mutual arrangement. The latest heard about
it was a statement last month by the Com-
monwealth’s Commissioner of Pensions, who
remarked that it had been “under considera-
tion for some time,” but there were “serious
difficulties, including that of cost, to be over-
come.” The maximum Australian pension is
£45 10s. a year, whereas the M.L. limit is
£3O, with an extra £l3 for two or more
children under 14, and there are other dif-
ferences ; but it should not be beyond the
wit of man to arrive at an agreement fair
to both countries.
Supporters of Lang’s bill giving compul-
sory preference to unionists claimed that
such preference is conceded by a Maoriland
Act. It isn’t. Preference is not a matter
of statute law in M.L., but for the Arbitra-
tion Court, which in its awards almost always
inserts what is known as the “Court’s
Clause,” providing that so long as a union
is open to all persons of good character on
payment of a defined fee, members shall be
given preference of employment by em-
ployers in any case in which a member of the
union “equally tvell qualified” is available.
But the clause is worth little, since the quali-
fications of an applicant for employment
must be judged by the employer. A clause
more favored in Labor circles, inserted in
some M.L. awards, decrees that any worker
employed in the industry concerned who
does not join the union within a given
period must be discharged. But that clause
is only inserted by mutual consent of em-
ployers and workers, and where such consent
is obtainable the union rarely asks for it.
Some of the talk that followed the High
Court’s decision in the deportation case
sounded as though Walsh and Johanson had
been given illuminated addresses by the full
bench of Judges. As a matter of fact, the
Judges might think a thousand times worse
of the pair than the Deportation Board did
and still have to find that they were not
properly proceeded against.
A feature of the N.S.Yv. Government's
Industrial Arbitration Amendment Bill was
that, though employers should be under
penalties for breach of an agreement, unions
might break every agreement from A to Z
and be liable for nothing. The Assembly,
being gagged, had no chance to make ad-
equate remarks about this proviso, but the
Upper House knocked it out in a summary
way. Willis advanced the argument that the
Law was such a helpless mass that it
couldn’t collect fines from unions, but the
Council held that it might as well try.
If Tom Walsh did give way to blind rage
when he learned that his deportation was off
there was. no lack of justification. Boor
luck attended the effort to run an English
strike in Australia under the auspices of
that curious “scab” organisation, the Amal-
gamated Marine Workers’ Union of Shinwell,
the Jew tailor. Though the strike was an
appalling loss to Australia it didn’t shake
Havelock Wilson, the object of Thomas’s un-
dying animosity, or the big Seamen’s Union
which he represents. But Walsh, becoming
somewhat of a hero in dubious British
circles, was offered a promising job in con-
nection with Shinwell’s show, and it was
understood that he was going. In that case
he could either go at his own expense, or be
presented, with first-class tickets for self and
family, together with sustenance money for
the family till time of leaving, and a halo of
sorts as a deported martyr. Tlie loss oi
these things was enough to aggravate any-
body.
The lifting of the ban on German immigra-
tion was coincident with a brisk row be-
tween German factions in the Hume
(N.S.W.) electorate, which contains thou-
sands of Fritzes and Johanns and Gretchens
and Willielminas. During the recent cam-
paign the electorate was flooded with copies
of a letter headed “Lest We Forget,” in
which settlers of German descent were urged
to support “Mr. Parker Moloney and his
party, who have always stood for fair play
for us,” and bidden to remember that “both
Nationalist and Country parties voted dur-
ing the war to treat us worse than black-
fellows.” The writers insisted that “every
German descendant with a spark of manhood
in him should not forget to wipe out this
insult to the country of our forefathers,” and
remarked how harrowing it was “to find some
German descendants asking to let bygones
be bygones.” A few of the latter called *a
meeting to repudiate the letter, but the meet-
ing was broken up by irreconcilables and
navvies from a Government loan-job. With
such allies, the Labor member retained the
seat by a narrow majority. But such a vic-
tory will hurt the winning side more than
half a dozen honorable deteats.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party
has handed its official organ a testimonial
which must be unique in the history of politi-
cal journalism:—
Members of this party condemn and repudiate the
publication in the Labor paper of all statements in
that paper which alleged or implied that any member
of this party is of such a character that any National
agent would approach him with a corrupt offer.
It is reported on the worst authority that
the resolution was written on the Dack ot
a Randwick betting ticket and delivered to
the offending editor by Alderman Mick Burke.
The burying of the hatchet on the part
of the Tory and Liberal tribes in M.L. seems
foreshadowed by the expected appointment
of John Findlay as leader of the small Do-
minion’s House of Lords. Findlay, who was
Attorney-General under Ward, has been out
of politics for six years. His views on the
correct way of settling industrial disturb-
ances, which were drastic, contributed
substantially to the downfall of the Ward
regime and the formation of a Labor party.
He and his partner Dalziell hold a con-
siderable interest in the.N.Z. Times (Wel-
lington), which latterly has gone over to
the Coates camp, after long years of Liberal-
ism with an interregnum of Socialism. A
man of much culture, with a nimble mind and
a keen sense of humor, Findlay could never
resist the temptation to make fun of col-
leagues with duller wits, a characteristic
that did not improve his standing in Liberal
circles.
A Rural Workers’ Accommodation Bill is
being steam-rollered through the N.S.W.
Legislature by Lang and co., and one of the
stock arguments in its support is that if
Maoriland can stand such a measure the
Ma State can. Setting aside the fact that
the M.L. laws regulating shearers’ accom-
modation and the like are not so drastic
as those Lang proposes, it has to be re-
membered that these laws in the Shivery
Isles have always been administered by
Governments friendly to the farming in-
terests. In such cases everything depends
upon the instructions given to the inspec-
tors. A Labor Government, if maliciously
inclined, could cause an insurrection in the
cow-country of M.L. without going an inch
outside the law.
It is lamented in some daily papers that,
though the receipt of tenders for building
the Kyogle (N.S.W.) to Brisbane railway
finished two months ago, nothing has yet
been done. This is the proposed duplicate
or possibly triplicate link which the Com-
monwealth Government has agreed to build
for the benefit of two States which should be
rich enough to pay for their own link.
Meanwhile it isn’t as generally lamented as
it should be that the receipt of tenders for
the South-to-North line (which is Federal
business) has neither finished nor got- half-
way—in fact, hasn’t even commenced.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not in a careless hour this bottle was built,
Nor as a shelter on a sudden sought
By one tossed up among the hhinan silt
Of some fast-rushing flood, where terror caught
At safety on the banks of higher land.
Each room is hallowed by a freeman’s thought,
Each door has opened to a gracious hand;
And all of beauty that it holds was wrought
Under wise, heedful eyes that held far dreams,
Deep lessons in that sun-steeped garden taught;
And those broad fields that slope to singing streams
Live with the memories the years have brought.
Shall this be broken, torn and turned to nought
For some crude vision seen in broken gleams ?

Losses over the past live years have averaged
49.2 p.c., and the available facts indicate
that big concerns like the Queensland,
writing world-business, must accept a loss
rate of close up to 50 p.c. as somewhere
about normal.
Expenses gained a little. That the
Queensland should find its charges growing
throws a bright light on the difficulties which
confront less efficiently managed offices and
especially those young concerns born in the
flotation boom of a few years ago. Coin-
pared with these offices, the Queensland’s
solidity makes it easy to hold old business
and win new. Funds (paid capital and re-
serves combined) amount to £927,992; so,
without getting in another penny of pre-
miums or earning another liap’orth of in-
terest, the co. could next year meet losses
approximately equal to those of the past four
years heaped one upon the other. Moreover,
funds are in the best possible form —three-
fourths of them are cash and public securi-
ties which could be turned into cash within
a few hours. And in addition to the visible
reserves there is an unknown amount in con-
tingency funds—unknown, though suspected
on good grounds of being very substantial.

value. Furniture, fittings and stationery
have no place in the balance-sheet _at all;
and the co. is too modest to mention _ the
figure at which some of its public securities
stand in its books.
Approximately half the Queensland’s busi-
ness is won beyond Australia, and the pre-
mium income from foreign sources showed a
gain last year. The new branches in New
York and Montreal (the latter was opened
last year) contributed. The management is
moving with great care in New Y'ork, but
that centre, in the years to come, may prove
a rich field. There is a tremendous volume
of business to take there —and a tremendous
volume to decline.

In running the eye down such a ■ column
of figures as you will find in that table it
always has to be kept in mind that £1 in
1925 doesn’t mean the same ■ thing as £ 1 in
1915. Prices of pretty well everything have
increased very much in the past 10 years;
and a profit of £05,071 in 1925 was really
only equal to a. profit of £45,800 in 1915.
If a co. has not increased its profit during
the period by 40 p.c. then one can fairly
say that it has not held its ground. And if
(assuming that there has been, no distribu-
tion of bonus shares) ,tlie co. lias not in-
creased its dividend by two-fifths (say, from 5
p.c. to 7 p.c., or from 10 p.c. to 14 p.c.),'then
one can also fairly say that shareholders are
not doing as well now as they did 10 years
ago. In the case of a fire-insurance office
the increase of profit ought to have come
about almost automatically, because as values
have risen insurances have tended to rise
with them. And as the value of the great
bulk of city and suburban property has
increased more rapidly than the value of
general commodities, insurances on these
risks should have risen with more than
average rapidity. All these facts have to be
taken into account in assessing the progress
that an insurance office has made, whether
you judge it by its profits or by its premium
income. .
On the foregoing basis the Colonial Mutual
has done only moderately well in the past
19 years; or it would be better to say that
it did poorly in the first seven years, and
only in the last three lias it atoned for
sticking in the mud so long. The truth is this
office was for many years very hungry for
dividends, and did not give its reserves much
of a chance; in consequence, people with new
insurances to place didn’t rush it. Even
now. though it is 10 years since the last
bonus-share issue, reserves (including re-
serve against unexpired risks) total only
£191,728; and if 40 p.c. of last year’s pre-
mium income is a fair thing to hold against
unexpired risks, there should be £124,712
in that reserve alone. However, largely be-
cause policies have not increased rapidly,
their holders are very well protected—better
protected, in fact, than in some much more
progressive offices.
Assisted by that rise in insurable values
already mentioned, underwriting income was
almost as’great as it was in 1921, when the
co. ventured into the marine business and got
into deep water before it got out. Losses
were light, although not quite so light as in
1924

The average underwriting profit is not
large; for a co. which wins no more new
business than the Colonial Mutual does the
expense rate has lately been too high, and
the downward movement is welcome.
The co. lately felt itself driven to acquire
a Sydney freehold, and this has made changes
in assets which don’t for the moment im-
prove the look of the balance-sheet. The
nature of the assets has been changed as
follows
t 1921 — f- —1925
p.c. p.c.
Public securities & cash £394,699! 73,0 £313,020 54.2

Mortgages .. .. 12,000 2.2 ~/
Sundries . . . . 34,144 6.3 33,681' 5.8
The acquisition of premises which have a
certain advertising value may indicate a
more vigorous policy; and there are other
indications of the same thing. Meantime
clients for whom the co. is carrying risks
may lie comfortably in their beds knowing
that the office could pay losses about 2| times
greater than last year’s with its liquid assets
alone.

The year’s profit shows the fourth consecu-
tive increase since the old Evening News
was brought under the control of Holdings,
Ltd., and the management was placed in the
hands of E. G. Kuox. Certainly paid capi-
tal also has largely increased; as at Oct. 31
it was £328,804 including calls paid in
advance, as against £150,000 in 1921.
Though on figures there has thus been no
improvement in earnings to speak of in pro-
portion to share capital, actually the history
of the co. has grown steadily more cheerful,
inasmuch as the new capital (over £lOO,OOO
was got in last year) has so far earned very
little: by far the greater part of it has been
put into the new home in Elizabeth-street,
which is not yet out of the builders’ hands.
Before the next accounts close the old pre-
mises in Market-street will have been vacated
and the P. and L. account will benefit by
the saving in rent. But too much should not
be expected from this current year, because
it will have to carry many extraordinary
exes, that might be charged to capital, but
probably won’t be.
The next comparison shows what money
has been got in and (in a general way) what
has been done with it: —
1922. 1924. 1925.

Book debts . . 33,056 38,522 48,913
Cash, etc. . . 6,656 2,424 1,305
Goodwill is disclosed at £62,ooo—said to be
the figure which the new co. paid when it
took over. That seeing modest enough. The
market values it at about £28,000 more.
Much of the strength of the old News has
been won back and tin; control of Holdings.
Ltd., plus skill on the literary side gives good
jiromise of continued success. Yet, for all
that promise, goodwill in a newspaper is such
a mercurial thing—Sydney has plenty of
proof of this —that the best place for it is
off the balance-sheet. There is a certain
amount of comfort, no doubt, in the fact
that accumulations at October 31. were m
excess of the goodwill item by £ll, lBB. But
that is only so on the assumption that plant
replacement reserve is ail accumulation ot
true profit. If it isn’t the co. has still about
i£35,000 to make and lay by before it has
all its capital represented by tangible assets.
After a half-century’s occupation of the
old Market-street building the co. is now
shifting to its own fine premises fronting
Hyde Park. That, as already indicated, is
the principal cause behind the big movement
of the chief balance-sheet items—including
the rise in sundry creditors from £41,857 to
£116,008. The bank overdraft which forms
part of this will probably just about dis-
appear when the last two calls bring in their
£96.196. This will carry the capital to
£425,000 —a very moderate amount indeed
for a metropolitan daily to carry, especially
with the assistance of one or two handy sub-
sidiary sheets.

For years York-street and Flinders-lane have
been looked upon as gold-paved avenues.
But conditions are not quite what they were.
First the big department-store which is its
own importer and manufacturer has; devel-
oped enormously. Next Dame has
grown more capricious with age —“the
Street” and “the Lane” have had some bitter
experiences of that of recent years. The
importers must carry very large stocks. They
must order long distances aiiead. Even
while the summer sun is turning the flapper’s
thoughts to the surf the softgoo'E man has
to think about the next season’s bathers;
and when his order is on the water a craze
sets in for, say, cretonne costumes! Faced
with that the big retailer unloads quickly
at the best price. The smaller retailer who
gets his supplies from York-street or Flin-
ders-lane doesn’t order —or he cancels his
order. Again, with the big retailers indent-
ing or importing, the wholesalers have to get
a multitude of orders from smaller shops to
make their volume of business; and that is
expensive. Furthermore, the growth of small
shops makes the question of bad debts acute.
And, finally, there is the uncertainty of over-
seas values, partly the result of the foreign
exchange troubles, and the growing competi-
tion of Australian manufacturers.
These remarks emerge out of a considera-
tion of last year’s reduced profit and the
general tendency disclosed since the boom
of 1920. Robert Reid’s is in a better
position than some other houses in that it has
very close connections with one or two big-
retail stores, at least one of which has been
a good money-spinner. However, the public
is interested only in the prefs., and their
rate of dividend is fixed. But if, therefore,
they haven’t anything dazzling to look for-
ward to they also have nothing dismal to
fear. This shows their security:—

Of tangible assets of £2,197,065, £1,895,032
is in more or less liquid form. There is
£150,000 of 6 p.c. mortgage debenture stock,
and, after providing for trading debts, for
the debenture debt (plus interest accrued)
and the first prefs. there was £1,128,687 to
cover the quarter-million of second prefs., or
£4 10s. 3d. per share. A pension reserve
amounted to £56,902; it has not been counted
with liabilities. On the other hand a plant
and fixtures depreciation fund which amounts
to £32,260 has not been included in reserves.
And the hesitation as to tlie one offsets the
hesitation as to the other.

The mild summer from Marchant’s point of
view was “unsuitable,” but business is said
to have been “well maintained.” Neverthe-
less profits shrank a little further, and
although reserves have been steadily built
up, at £14,469 they can- still do with sub-
stantial additions. The net profit is shown
after providing for depreciation, and much
depends on whether that allowance has been
sufficient. Of assets of £98,208 as at May 27,
upwards of one-third was in more or less
liquid form. Here is a comparison covering
the last four years :

Book debts and cash 15,658 11,492 21,359 19,463
With less than £2OOO of debt and £4369 in
cash alone, the position is comfortable. The
accounts are free from intangibles, goodwill
of £5300 having been written out of re-
serves two years ago. As goodwill was not
considered an asset in the introductory table
the movement is not shown. Net tangible
assets amounted to just on 245. for each
fully-paid £1 share. The co. gets its pro-
portion of trade, but it wbuld not need much
further shrinkage to imperil the 10 p.c. div.

Look at September, 1924, for a comparison :
or place the £84,463 won for the past 12
months alongside the £57,806 won for the
preceding year. There is progress in those
figures, and it would have been greater but
for the British seamen’s strike. “A consider-
able quantity of goods sold to arrive was
in Australian waters in September, but not
available for delivery”: stocks afloat and in
transit as at September 30 were £85,477, com-
pared with £72,662 in 1924. A new issue
of capital (£76,457 was in by the close of
the accounts) had little bearing on profits,
for the co. had the use of the money for
two months or less. Balance-sheet figures,
however, show its influence: —

with over a million of assets there are such

London-controlled Kalgoorlie mining cos. —
will be held in London this month to consider
the matter.

Depressing admissions made by chairman
of Ives Reward (W.A.I at the recent share-
holders’ meeting: “At first returns were
reasonably satisfactory, then they unaccount-
ably fell off and went from bad to worse.
When the mill started, the mine was not
sufficiently developed to allow of a continu-
ous supply of average-grade ore for treat-
ment. The manager expressed an opinion
but didn’t oppose the erection of the plant.
There is a discrepancy between assay
values of broken ore and battery returns
which the manager is unable to account
for.” The Bitilletin said before the bat-
tery started that, owing to an accumulation
of broken ore. crushings would probably be
encouraging for a while, but when this
accumulation had been used up they would
be the reverse. The fact of mill results not
confirming official estimates is, in view of
the erratic nature of the values in' the mine,
not surprising; but the manager’s inability
to account for same undoubtedly is. So is
the chairman’s suggestion that the battery
was installed in the face of the manager’s
opinion that the mine was not ready for it.
These are matters which shareholders should
insist on having cleared up before providing
further funds.
After all that was promised would happen
from the amalgamation of Lake View and
Star with Ivanhae, the net result is 3d. per
ton profit from ore treatment plus 7d. per
ton profit from treatment of the old Ivanhoe
sand dump.

Empire Extended, alias Lass o’ Gowrie,
has moved again. It successively drew
blanks at Mt. Mongjer, Hancocks, Laverton,
Southern Cross and elsewhere in the West,
and then flitted to Tasmania. Now it is
interested in a mica, show somewhere east
of Arltunga (S.A.), which is the furthest
out back it has ever been. The co. is very
pushing, but, like a lot of other small Adel-
aide cos., its most prominent features are
cheerful reports followed by calls.
South Ivalgurli (W.A.), with a share
issue of 250,000, n»w has an ore reserve of
220,000 tons, plus probable ore reserves
90,000 tons; total, 310,000 tons, or about
1J tons per share. Profit per ton being
made on treatment is 7s. 6d. per ton, while
market price is 12s. buyers. On figures, a
buyer requires confidence in the mine to
justify his paying that price, but all Kal-
goorlie considers the South as good as all
other Westralian mines put together. Pro-
bably the mine-manager has something up
his sleeve in the way of ore reserves.
A few cheerful corks popped at. Orallo,
but nothing else. Oil was off and the party
of heads who had gone up to see the test
was disappointed. The New Year will see
the attempt if luck holds. After the amaz-
ing state of affairs which appears to have
prevailed at Orallo, it was dubious policy to
exclude anyone who looked like a pressman.
Mines Minister Jones turned a Brisbane
Inky Wayfarer down simply because his
paper didn’t like Jones, or had attacked his
optimism or something else in a tender spot.
This action recalls the days when Milsom
had armed guards around the borehole and
was seriously contemplating a barbed-wire
barricade. If there is any scarcity of oil at
Orallo the limelight supply is certainly good.

Isa Mines has issued a circular dealing
with the purchase of the Isa Prop, leases.
These were “not only valuable in themselves
but scattered over the very heart of the
parent co.’s area.” In the Ibus it is esti-
mated that “the resulting saving in mining
costs alone will more than cover the pur-
chase price of all the leases.” And there is
the addition of 1,500,000 tons to reserves.
Altogether the big co. sees cause for mutual
congratulations. “As an amalgamation, and
with metallurgical works installed commen-
surate with the ore deposits to be worked,
the mine should become one of the largest
producers of silver-lead in the world, and
yield handsome returns to the shareholders.
There isn’t much professional backing to a
Vic. prospectus concerning 200 acres of tin
sluicing lands on Tableland Mountain, 22
miles from Cooktown (N.Q.). J. H. Walters
signs the document for “self and co-part-
ners.” The 200 acres, “on being thoroughly
prospected, is estimated to yield from 31b. to
101 b. tin ore to the lineal yard.” Further,
“it is estimated that the whole of the block
would yield a similar return, or better.” A
computation gives five tons tin ore JP er
month, which at £165 a ton means £9900 a
year, at a cost of £3300, leaving shareholders
with £6600. Share capital asked is £3OOO
in 20s. shares, of which the vendors are to
get 50 fully-paids each and £lOO each in
cash from the first yield. The document
states that seven alluvial miners on the
western slope of Tableland Mountain got
£4OOO worth of tin in four months to a depth
of nine inches with primitive sluicing appli-
ances, and that “700 tons of rich crystal tin
ore was won from about 17 acres of country
in the vicinity of our lease.”

There is sufficient brown coal at Yallourn
for briquetting and electricity generation for
3000 years, according to Dr. Emil Guadlitz,
the German engineer, in his report to the
Vic. Cabinet. On the financial side lie says
the industry is overloaded with . capital
charges and that capital expenditure is being
thrown in with working expenses. If this
is so the State Auditor-General and the
Electricity Commission might go into con-
ference. Guadlitz’s remarks on the technical
troubles of the industry are definite enough.
The high water content (62 p.c. to 65 p.c.)
is stressed and the consequential necessity
of reducing handling charges. A raw pro-
duct of such low value as Yallourn brown
coal can be manufactured economically only
if working costs are kept at a minimum.
Hand labor needs to be displaced, particu-
larly iu the removal of the huge amount of
overburden. He recommends that the works
themselves be progressively enlarged and
particular attention given to the latest
methods in steam technique and to the sell-
ing end of the business. Compared with
profitable German deposits, the overburden
is thinner and the coal thicker. Which is
something to encourage the Commission.
A Bendigo crowd is out to re-make
Oswald’s old mine at Maldon. Parkin’s Reef
runs through the claim, a splendid formation,
but too low-grade to pay. Into it saddle
reefs make, and it was some of these which
built up old Bob Oswald’s w-ealth on a
massive scale. His beneficiaries kept the
show going until lately, when Bendigo
took over the claim, intent upon having a
dash at the droppers and spurs between 500
and 600 feet. Those cut so far are small, but
are worth chasing, for they often average
well, and there is a bare chance that another
jeweller’s shop may be broken into. The
mine is fully opened up, so work is cheap,
and a bit should come from the odd spui-s
run into, even if nothing sensational is cut.
Flagstone (N.S.W.) shareholders would
feel better if the office had something more
definite about battery construction than the
bald statement that “all the concrete work
nears completion, and erection of ore-bins
is in progress.” Engine, boiler, stamps,
water connection —what of these? Is all
the heavy stuff still lying 12 miles away at
the Butler? Where is the hustle that was
going to give a Christmas div.? Neither
tunnel holds the goods at present, but on
the Cartwheel lease the crosscut at 15ft.
shows solid ore giving 6 p.c. oxide. West
Flagstone has better news than the parent
co. No. 2 tunnel, operating on the new
lode, is 15ft. in on what seems a solid ore-
body 10ft. wide, and averaging 5 p.c.
McKenzie estimates 100 tons of £lO ore at
grass, all told. But till the Flagstone drops
its stamps the whole position will be vague.
With one dredge the Melbourne-owned
Adelong Estate (N.S.W.) handled 344,081
c. yds. of alluvial for 28590 z., which was
not as good as the previous run 9f 310,499 c.
yds. for 30920 z. Gold sales of £11,365 were
just £lOOO less, but wiu* cash in hand the
profit of £3877 for the campaign gave enough
to comfort Collins - House with a bob div.
Debts are down to £lB5B and liquid assets
are £13,531, most of it cash, so there isn't
any doubt as to the co.’s solvency.

Weary of the slow progress in the erection
of the battery, Mt. Patterson, Attunga
(N.S.W.), has appointed W. Bale consult-
ing engineer. He promptly recommended
suspension of all plant construction except
a unit to try what SOO tons of the stuff is
like. The dams need reconstruction, says
Bale; also portion of the machinery and
plant. The Board concurs. It looks as
though Patterson shareholders got Mt. Dud-
ley’s persistent bad luck along with its old
20-head battery.

Believing that 700,000 of the 1,000,000
2s. 4d. shares in Huey Yot (F.M.S.j are
held in Australia, a Sydney meeting last
week expressed strong disapproval of the re-
construction scheme launched at the Malayan
end. The circular announcing the terms gave
out that capital should be raised to £140,000
by handing present Holders 70,000 20s. shares
and issuing £70,000 worth of 12 p.c. prefs.
Philip Cohen, chairman of the dissenters, ex-
plained that failure of the suction-cutter
dredge had forced reconstruction, yet it
seemed that a further £20,000 was to be
spent on it. The sum of 89,600 dollars had
been spent on mine account for the year,
although there was no mining work done.
Although the property was one of the best in
“the East,” and should have a life of 20 to
30 years, it seemed to him that the £70,000
of pref. capital would be spent before pro-
duction was reached, and tiie co. would still
be in debt. Gould MacDougall contrasted
the offer of £70,000 with the capital value
of £116,000. But there is not much in that
point, seeing that only £58,000 was actu-
ally subscribed in the first place, the
other half-million shares being the vendors’
cut. With regard to the talk of the potential
greatness of the property, it seems to be
overlooked that an attempt to float it as
Trang in 1923 failed utterly; and the most
destructive critic of the project on that
occasion was one of the leading spirits when
the present co. was placed on the stocks. Dis-
crepancies between the Trang and Huey Yot
prospectuses were most marked, and caused
some hot criticism in the F.M.S. press.

Additional ground secured by Sydney Siam
Tin, Ltd., raises the area to 8000 acres —a
respectable block if borings, prove payable
deposits. The three areas comprising the
total were all secured direct from the Siam-
ese Government, which means that the usual
intermediate vendor and his cut are absent.

The past year’s profit on working account is
£17,425, which depreciation on four dredges,
etc., cuts down to a net £ll,BB2 —a great
deal better than the loss of £8620 for the
preceding campaign. But it took another
600,000 c. yds. of drift and an additional £lO
a ton on tin oxide sold to get even that far
on the right side of the ledger. Knowing the
ups and downs of the jam and other trades,
A. Ashbolt, Henry Jones and others who
run the co. don’t spill divs. unless the till
overflows; so £63,897 of undivided profits is
left at the credit of P. and L. at the year’s
end. As tin has remained at high levels that
credit must have been mounting solidly the
last six months. Costs got down to a shade
under 4d. a yd., but that was because three
of the dredges had to work in already treated
ground, and this brought down the average
yield to 0.4171 b. a yd. Yet results were
not shabby. No. 6 plant on the go at
Chelong Bay from March to September
pretty well saved the situation, as it won
£35,236 of product—a big slice of the total
return of £88,670. No. 4, at Bao Tang, came
second with £29,713. The other two plants
merely limped along. Puket Sound will be
deserted until the new No. 7 is ready to test
the deep water. That plant is also to try
its luck beside No. 6 at Chelong Bay. It
won’t, however, be on the job till April,
1927. The co., having other areas to con-
quer, will place the re-constructed No. 2
plant on the Bidor concession, where it is
to be joined later by No. 8. As the wide
world knows, 50,000 shares of a new issue
have been underwritten at 255. each by that
bold old speculator, F. Bond, of Hobart, to
furnish cash for converting No. 2 dredge, and
to provide the full cost of Nos. 7 and 8. If
the co. gets back to divs. in April next he
won’t suffer even if shares are left on Ins
hands for keeps.

Bundi (F.M.S.) has declared its second
shilling div., and concurrently announces a
contract for No. 2 dredge, which should be
in commission “early in i 927.” This second
string to the productive bow will have a
capacity of 145,000 yards a month. The co.
has only 5000 reserve shares over and above
the 80,000 issued, and so will lean on a group
of its affluent holders for £30,000. Shares
hover around 50s.
Since the closing of the books for the
annual balance at June 30, Kamunting
(F.M.S.) has improved its position as a
dividend payer. The second interim of Is. 6d.
a share is to come in January, which means
30 p.c. p.a. if maintained —which should be
dead easy with £98,000 in hand and current
production of 100 tons and upwards a month.
At market price of 655., however, the div. is
the mimimum that should be looked for on
a mining stock, meaning less than 10 p.c. to
the purchaser. At a cost of £9700 the co.
has added 540 acres, and now has 2187.

“and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS”
“G.M.P.” : They were wedding-breakfasted
in the usual way, and, while the young guests
were dancing in the kitchen and the guests not
so young were discussing crops and polities
or recipes .and babies in the front room, the
young couple set out for their honeymoon.
It wasn't a trip to either the Yallin-
gup Caves or Nornalup, but to a self-con-
tained flat in the country. In a corner
of the cow-paddock, up near the lucerne-
patch, the enterprising ’groom had turned an
unused wheat-stripping machine into a snug
little nest. The stripper-box, whose proper
function was to hold wheat, was converted
into a dormitory; a kitchenette of flattened-
out kerosene-tins was rigged up near the
windmill, and for a bath there was the water-
trough. What more could they want?

“Keppel” : The hard-doers of Gallipoli and
St. Quentin left just as hard-doers behind
them in the cradle. The other day a 18-
year-old Rockhampton (C.Q.) boy went for
THE BLACKLEG.
“My dear, have you heard?—Trixie has been
expelled for unwomanly conduct!”
“Heavens —was her offence very terrible?”
“Perfectly awful! She was discovered giving
rebates on her alimony.”
a day’s fishing in the Fitzroy. Early in the
morning he trod on a big fish-hook which
passed through the flesh under the big toe,
twisted over and stayed there. He couldn’t
get it out, of course, yet he couldn’t see a
good day wasted either, and it wasn’t until
three hours later, when he had made a
fair-sized haul, that he thought it time to
see about the hook. He had another go at
it himself, but found it embedded too firmly,
so he went to the ambulance station and
calmly watched a bearer remove it.
“Curlew”: Cloncurry was not the only
place in North Queensland that “nearly saw
a lynching” (B. 22/10/’25). At Clermont
(Q.) in the ’eighties a doctor, the only one
within hundreds of miles, was one night
called to a mining camp where a woman’s
life was in the balance. The night was
boisterous and the country rough, and the
doctor sent the messenger back to say he
would attend the case in the morning. Some
diggers, rendered desperate by hearing the
cries of the woman in her extremity, saddled
up and galloped into town, taking with them
a spare horse and a greenliide windlass-rope.
They called the doctor out from a game
of poker, and the spokesman of the cavalcade
gave him the option of “stretching his legs
or of trying his weight at the end of a bit
of greenhide.” The doctor did a quick think
and a comfortless ride, and the outcome was
satisfactory.

“Roycha” : The bobbed-hair craze has been
responsible for at
least one court
case. At Parramatta
a few days ago a
lady begged the
magistrate to bind
over her husband,
as she feared fur-
ther violence from
him —she had been
subjected to some
already because
she had had her
hair bobbed against
his orders. The
night she sacrificed
her flowing locks he
burst into her
locked room armed
with a pair of scis-
sors and, shouting
“I’ll give you
bobbed hair!” tried
to shear off, as the
witness put it,
“what the barber
had left.” The wife
raised such shrieks
that the police
arrived and dragged
the would-be male Delilah to a cell.
“Aorangi”: A pathetic little story of
thwarted ambition has been recalled by the
death of an old military pensioner, J. S. W.
Jackson, at the age of 100, in Auckland In-
firmary. Three years ago, when Jackson
found himself incapacitated for further
struggle with a hard world and entered the
institution, there was another old chap in the,
home a couple of years his junior. For years
this inmate had enjoyed a sort of special
glory as the “father of the home,” and he had
been looking forward happily and contentedly
to completing his century there. Jackson’s
arrival, however, robbed him of his distinction
and his life of its flavor, so he turned his face
to the Avail and died.
“Coppertop”: The youngsters were being
put through their facings in grammar. The
inspector wrote a sentence on the board and
the star boy of the class Avas called upon to
parse a particular word. The lad rattled it
off in fine style: “Common noun, third per-
son, singular number, neuter gender, nom-
in-at-ive case to the verb” When
he had concluded, the inspector complimented
the master on his charges’ proficiency. Then,
turning to the lad who had distinguished
himself, he asked: “And now tell me —
what use is grammar to you?” As promptly
came the star’s reply: “It learns yer ter
talk proper!”

“Sixenate”: Thirty-six years ago the Jus-,
tice Owen of the day listened to an appli-
cation made on behalf of Winifred Marian
Butler, a child 13J years of age, for per-
mission to change her religion from R.C.
to Protestant; her father, “Paddy” Bufier,
had willed that she should be educated as
an R.C., and the application was an effort
to upset that direction. It was refused,
but the Full Court granted it upon appeal,
after examining the girl as to her wishes.
Last week Mary Christabel Tickle, 17,
daughter of the infant applicant of 1889,
was the heroine in tAVo cases heard by the
Judge in Divorce, the present Justice Owen,
son of the adjudicator in tlie former case.
In one of them, after interrogating the girl
as to her wishes, his Honor made an order
that the father should have the custody of
her from March next in order to take
her with him on a trip to Europe; and
the next day leave was granted to her
mother to haA'e the custody of the child in
order to spend a holiday with her in any
part of the Commonwealth, with the pro-
viso that she must be returned to the juris-
diction of the Court by March 2.
“Dingo”: “Oxmead” (B. 3/12/’25) may
well be dubious as. to whether the two de-
funct S’African republics issued war medals ;
who was there to issue them after the first
few months of the struggle? I met quite a
number of men during the Great War who
had fought against the Empire in S’Africa,
and none of them had any decorations to
show for it. Most of them were Afrikanders,
but there must have been a fair sprinkling
of men from such forces as Lynch's Irish
Brigade. Many members of the 3rd Division.
A.1.F., will remember an officer attached to
the camp staff at Lark Hill (Eng.) who
was never tired of discussing the S’African
campaign with our veterans. When asked
by newcomers about his lack of decorations
he invariably replied: “I fought on the
side that got a devil of a beating—and no
ribbons.”
“Windsor”: A lone-handed Fascist has
turned up in Melbourne. He was an elderly
individual who ceased his sedate walk along
Little Lon. the other night to seize an in-
offensive stranger by the shoulders and hurl
him headlong off the footpath into the gutter.
Then he resumed his progress, presently
stopping to treat two more unsuspecting

“Darling Dorothea, how I love you!”
“That’s right, old chap. But don’t tell your
wife-my husband might get to hear of
it.”
pedestrians in the same manner. When he
reached Russell-street, however, he struck a
snag. He grabbed an apparently preoccupied
loiterer and sent him spinning, only to
discover that it was a member of the police
bicycle patrol. The assaulted person ex-
pressed a heated desire to know what the
game was. “You must learn to keep to
the left,” returned the public-spirited indi-
vidual. waggling his finger in stern reproof.
Hut the constable called it “offensive be-
havior,” and an unsympathetic beak made it
twenty shillings.

“P. Pinktape”: The latest tale of a
typist told in the Sydney Divorce Court
was a neat example of feminine guile. The
wife, bursting into the locked office of her
husband, discovered there the typist he had
assured her he had sacked; but after the
storm which tore the lock from the door,
she was calm—and subtle. “Oh, I thought
I would find the girl from the beauty parlor
here,” she remarked. The jealous wrath of
the typewriter lady as she demanded in-
formation about the beauty-parlor girl was
a complete exposure of the intrigue; and
the wife withdrew from the scene of hos-
tilities with her evidence more or less com-
plete, and the satisfaction that she had sown
thorns in the Eden of her husband and his
lover.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: A Sydney costumier, who
optimistically sued the husband of a client
for the value of goods supplied, got a set-
back when the Court, after hearing the de-
fendant's declaration that he had forbidden
his wife to incur debts without his authority,
declined to order him to pay for articles
bought without his knowledge. The decision
was to the effect that it is the business of
a firm, before extending credit, to ascertain
whether the person it will hold responsible
is agreeable to accept the responsibility.
That is a fairer interpretation of the law r
than has hitherto prevailed. Some light was
thrown upon another dim legal point when
a pawnbroking firm sued for the recovery of
a ring held in the possession of the police.
The ring had been stolen and pawned; but
the pawnbrokers maintained that they had
only lent it to the Hops as evidence against
the thief, and that, as at the time it wms
pledged there had been no notification of
the theft', they had acted bona fide, and the
jewellery was their lawful property. The
police offering no obstacle, an order for its
restoration w r as made. The original owner,
unless he cares to risk expensive litigation.
will have to reimburse the people with the
three-ball sign for the money they have paid
out if he wants the ring back again. Had
it been pawned after notification of the theft
had been circulated, the loss would have been
upon the pawnbrokers.

“X.D.”: Victoria has provided another
intriguing death mystery, with gruesome
details, one of them being that the children
of a large school romped for 10 days in the
playground adjacent to the paddock where the
dead body lay without discovering it. A set
of false teeth was in the throat of the un-
pleasant cadaver; and, as one discerning
paper remarked, this led to “the opinion that
the cause of death was suffocation owing to
the teeth slipping. An empty whisky-bottle
and a flask found near the body support this
theory.” Some papers on the body, and the
teeth themselves, seemed to prove beyond
doubt that the body was that of, say, Bjones;
but, unfortunately for that easy solution,
credible witnesses are prepared to swear that
they have seen Bjones since the day on which
the alleged Bjones must have died. Such
testimony offers alluring material for a mys-
tery story. It is possible, for instance, that
the real owner of the grinders, having slain
an enemy for reasons to himself good and
proper, may have shoved his own false teeth
down the corpse’s throat to divert suspicion
and to help him to make an escape.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig” : The German Fascist believes in
carrying out the doctrine of hate properly,
to the extent of threatening to do it to him-
self most bitterly if he fails to keep his bile
in good working trim. The order of
the Knights of the Fiery Cross was re-
cently formed in der Vaderland (incidentally,
Henry Ford was accused of having helped
its initiation by sending across three emis-
saries of the Kn Klux Klan), and its com-
prehensive oatli pledged members to “take
up the struggle . . . against the enemies
of my German Fatherland, especially against
the hereditary foe, the Jews, the French, and
their supporters, the black, yellow and other
colored races.” Further :
I swear to despise my enemies and hate them
with a deadly hatred. Their insidious gold shall
not blind my eyes, but I will destroy their possessions
and avoid them like putrefying carrion. If, like a
miserable wretch, T betray the aims of the Order to
anyone, I will take upon myself the most horrible
tortures. All my bones shall be broken, my eyes
shall be put out. My body shall be cut up, torn
in fragments and thrown to the crows as their proper
food.
Eighteen “knights” were arrested by the
German Government when the organisation
was discovered. They were subsequently re-
leased ; it was decided that the boil-over was

“Avon” : The tumult about Dang’s 44-hours
Bill in N. S. Wales recalls one of the classical
stories of M.B. politics. Seddon was endeav-
oring to get through a not particularly entliu-
siatic House a clause in an industrial bill
definitely affirming the principle of the eight-
hour day. The attempt failed, owing to the
obstinacy of one of the Maori members, who
voted against that feature in various amended
forms. After the House adjourned King
Dick, sternest of disciplinarians, carpeted
Ilenare, who was supposed to be his follower,
and demanded to know what was biting him,
or words to that effect. “What’s your objec-

tion to an eight-hour day, anyhow?” was the
boss's peroration. Henare looked grieved.
“Too dam’ many!” he ejaculated softly, and
lifting a hand like a well-smoked ham he un-
folded four fat fingers. And the eight-hour
principle has remained outside the M.L.
Statute Book even to this day.

SPRING FEVER!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis spring- !—and to the poet, as he cried,
Came visions of a blossoming countryside:
The busy chicks; the sleepy hum of bees ;
The gentle cattle, wrapt in drowsy ease,
Chewing the cud,
Watching their calves endeavor to surpass
The sportive lamb at gambolling i’ the grass,
And come a thud.
And thus the Poet. But for urban me
The spring lamb plus the succulent green pea ;
The city chicken, dainty, full of grace
From neat-turned ankle to her piquant face,
My spirit salves.
Should more I need than these my heaii to glad,
1 drop my gaze and see them, silken-clad—■
Her fatted calves.

“McDuff”: The statues in the Fitzroy
Gardens, Melbourne, are not the only ones
that receive attention from roystering spirits
(B. 3/12/’25). The figure of Captain Cook
on the St. Kilda foreshore, unveiled some
years ago, presented a weird spectacle the
next morning, the intrepid navigator wear-
ing a battered belltopper, perched at a rakish
angle, while from one hand dangled a string
of saveloys. I have seen the effigy of Thomas
Bent, at the corner of Bay-street and Point
Nepean-road, Brighton (Vic.), brandishing
an empty beer-bottle. And not so long ago
Bobby Burns attracted considerable attention
one morning as he stood in his place on the
St. Kilda-road holding a dainty jazz-garter
for the delectation of all and sundry.

“S.T.S.”: The medical man ought to be
very careful in expressing himself. x\n
Adelaide dentist used to advertise with pride
that a patient who had been nervous before-
hand about getting hurt finally enthused
thus: “Never anywhere else for me; I think
you are marvellous.” And the superb artist
spoiled it all by thoughtlessly mentioning
that those were the patient’s “last words.”

“Emgee”: I knew a stewardess on one
of the steamers from “the East” who landed
a deal of opium before she was caught. Her
plan was remarkable for its simplicity. She
always went ashore with a small parcel, and
would blushingly whisper to the Customs
officer: “Only my nightie; I’m going to sleep
ashore.” In the end an uncliivaltous per-
son persisted in investigating the slumber-
wear, and a mighty expensive nightie it
proved.
THE BAD SYMPTOM.
“How is your insomnia?”
“Worse. I can't even sleep when it’s time to get up.”
“Up North” : There are a few sunken trea-
sure-ships off the Australian coast (B.
19/11/’25), but, as far as is known, their
cargoes are not worth any fabulous sums.
When the Gothenberg foundered on the way
from Port Darwin she had £3OOO of gold
aboard, apart from what passengers carried
in their belts. Several ships loaded with
diggers, who in turn were loaded with gold,
have gone to Davy Jones’s locker. A per-
fectly authentic story is that of Jardine’s find
off Cape York Peninsula. Glancing over the
bows of his cutter at very low tide lie saw
the mud-covered ribs of some queer craft.
He sent his diving-boys down, and from be-
side an almost-vanished anchor they brought
up heavy lumps of metal. The lumps proved

the action of sea-water. .Tardine sold his
trove for more than £3OOO. It is a pity he
hadn't divers properly equipped. Who knows
what that old Spanish wreck was, and how
much specie may still be lying there feet
deep in the mangrove mud! Happy-go-lucky
native diving-boys would never have brought

“Bris” : Queensland religiously honors the
national saints of the old country—George.
Andrew, Patrick and David —by gazetting
their name-days as public holidays. The
celebration takes the form of paying an
extra penny for the first section on the
trams. These half-baked holidays would
pass unremembered by the general public i£
it were not for the tram-conductor’s litany:
“Twopence to-day.’’ The passenger, as he
hands out the extra penny ejaculates piously
“God bless St. Andrew”—or St. Patrick, as
the case may be.

“Moreton” : Queensland Registrar-General
Porter lias put a stop to “sticky-beaking”
into the birth and marriage records. The
inquisitive person who wants to ascertain
whether Mrs. Nexdoor is really married,
or if Mrs. Overthcway’s baby did not arrive
too soon after the
wedding, now finds
unexpected
obstacles in the
way. The clerks
have instructions
to send all such
inquirers in to the
Registrar - General.
If he is satisfied
that the informa-
tion is required for
a legitimate pur-
pose, it is readily
given on payment
of the usual fee;
but if the visitor
has no better mo-
tive than idle curi-
osity or spite (with
perhaps a suspicion
of blackmail) it is
withheld. If the
“stick.vbeak” per-
sists, he (or sue)
is told: “Very
well; I will give
you the informa-
tion, and I will
w r ri t e to the
w o m a n ” —it is
generally a woman—“telling her that you
made the inquiry.” That always settles it.

“Topee” : Reference to people with strange
initials after their names (B. 19/11/’25)
recalls the Royal Commission appointed in
1888 to “enquire into the practice of medi-
cine and surgery in New 7 South Wales.”
Sydney then swarmed with quacks, and there
were strange revelations when some of the
more prominent were worried for their cre-
dentials. An Ultimo specialist in painless
childbirth owned up to being a baker by
trade; and a certain Dr. Julius Caesar ad-
mitted that he was a tanner. It was dragged
out of one Dr. Moore that, he had acquired
his knowledge of electro-hydrotherapy as a
doctor’s coachman by reading up the subject
while waiting on the box; for the boss. Dr.
Burnaby, who claimed to be brother of the
famous Colonel Fred, denied indignantly
that he was a barber; under cross-examina-
tion, however, he admitted that he had spent
some months in a hairdresser’s saloon, and
claimed that lie had found it an ideal field
for phrenological research. The Commission
naturally got an occasional jolt. One was
when the aged consulting physician to the
Marston Remedy Bolus Co. (Bligh-street)
was found to be really qualified, and another
when Dr. E. H. T. Bottrell, in reply to the
chairman’s query whether it was true that he
was worth £lOO,OOO, replied: “Yes; and
another on top of that!” An Austrian, Dr.
Prosper Stanich, M. 8., M.C., etc., was one
of the last examined. When asked what his
M.B. stood for, he replied promptly “Munici-
pality of Brunswick,” and produced a letter
from the Brunswick (Vic.) Council thank-
ing him for treating its deaf poor gratui-
tously.
“M.H.H.” : I remember an aged wanderer
who took a steerage berth in the old Kal-
goorlie at Fremantle years ago. He wore
bowyangs, and his only luggage was an old
and tattered coat. Shown to his berth, he
stated his intention of turning in at once, as
he was very tired after a long tramp. He
hung his coat up by the side of his bunk,
and was soon fast asleep. In the morning
he refused to be wakened, and the chief
steward, summoned to investigate, pro-
nounced the passenger to be dead. The cap-
tain came down and ordered a list to be
made of the ancient’s personal effects. The
steward remarked that there was nothing
except the old coat, but a casual examination
of this produced £l6O from the pockets.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Three churches
were made in England in the early ’fifties
t<> the order of a pious lady and forwarded
to Victoria to help convert the heathen. One
was erected at Port Melbourne, then known
as Sandridge ; another in Iloddie-street, Col-
lingwood, on the north side of the spot
where the Town Hall stands; and the third
at Gisborne, on tho top of a hill overlooking
the town. The three churches were made 'to
the one design, so that if a nail, a screw, a
beam, a sheet of iron, window, door or any-
thing else went astray a similar part of
either of the other churches would fit. The
Gisborne church, St. Paul's, is the only
survivor of the trio.
“Hasen” : I have long since ceased to look
for brightness in medical journals, but a
recent issue of the Lancet provides a plea-
sant exception. Our Own Correspondent,
writing from Vienna, under the interroga-
tive heading "Is the human saliva poison-
ous?" records: “An incident occurred re-
cently in a public bath which has caused
comment in medical circles. A girl of 15
was playfully bitten by a young man on the
thigh whilst the two were enjoying them-
selves in one of our public sunbaths.” The
correspondent goes on to relate that the
biting was sufficiently business-like to send
the maiden in search of medical help, with
a circumstantial tale about a dog, where-
upon she was duly given prophylactic injec-
tions for rabies. It seems difficult, to believe
that the comment was confined to “medical
circles.”
“Adelaide”: A sort of judgment-of-Solo-
mon has been successfully offered to an
Adelaide police court. A truck said to be
exceeding the speed-limit was chased by
constables, who declared their speedometer
showed about ,’>s before they could overtake
if. The driver when charged said tersely:
“What, in this old ’bus!” His counsel offei*ed
the Court a trial under any sort of condi-
tions, declaring that the truck had been
tested and proved unable to do more than 22.
The P.M. thought the challenge a fair thing,
and, on the police declining to accept it, dis-
missed the charge with costs against them.

“Linklater”: Comfortably ensconced, two
railway-travellers commended the cleverness
of the third, who had nosed out the empty
carriage on the crowded Northern IQ.) mHail-
train. Half an hour later they were found!
protesting when a railway official requested!
them to find accommodation on another part
of the train. The protests ceased suddenly and
the exodus was hurried when the guard
explained that the carriage they were in

having been used to convey lepers to the

“Sidweelan” : In an old file in the Govern-
ment department to which my war injuries
have assigned me you may find a letter
written in 1915 by the wife of a man on
active service. It was the reply to a de-
partmental request for settlement of a small
outstanding account (Bs. lOd.) owing by her
husband, and ran : “The Accountant, —-—.
Sir,—l beg to inform you that my military
allotment will not permit of payment of any
of my husband’s back-debts. I would sug-
gest That you send the account direct to him
at his present address, which is, as yours
probably ought to be, ‘Somewhere in
France.’—l am, Yours faithfully, .’’
THE SKIRTS OF GREECE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Athens correspondent of the Morning Post
says: ‘A decree issued by the Premier (General
Pangalos) forbids the wearing of short skirts on
the ground that they are repugnant to the Hellenic
sentiment of beauty. Skirts must be lowered to 12
inches from the ground.’ ”
What though the arts of war and peace
Have gone unquestionably bung
In storied, once-heroic Greece
Where iEschylus and Sappho sung.
The love of beauty, don’t forget,
Remains unvitiated yet.
While Cabinets in other climes
But metaphorically fall,
The Hellene article at times
Is lined a-row against a wall
For death—without the grim event
Outraging public sentiment.
When peculating colonels try
To loot the regimental till,
They hang the miscreants gallows-high
Upon the handiest lofty hill.
Nor find the corpses, dangling tense,
A strain on the aesthetic sense.
But overmuch accented calf
True artist souls is apt to hurt ;
They draw the line at more than half
Beneath the Doric mother’s skirt,
Or that of the Athenian maid
Who trips along the esplanade.
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
Drink to the dauntless General,
The statesman who decreed the line
To where the petticoat must fall.
Is Zoe Mou, 1 wonder, cross
With interfering Pangalos!

FORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“To say the least of it, the fashion of dress
adopted by many modern girls is distinctly bad
form.” —S. M. Herald.
The girl who through the sunlight goes
Within the city’s busy swarm,
And more of her own beauty shows
Than hides with ornaments and clothes,
If but her ways are kind and warm
Shows virtues quite enough for me,
Though wowsers eyes may evil see.
I am myself prepared to praise
Economy in every shape,
And if the girl by saving ways
Much of her loveliness displays
Which editors with rags would drape,
1 will admit I’m one of those
Who like young beauty more than clothes.
Let killjoys in their wrath declare
The form each damsel shows is bad;
The killjoys have such limbs, I’ll swear,
They need a lot of clothes to wear;
But undraped beauty makes me glad.
I revel in each sight I see—
The form seems right enough to me.

Teddy Needham, probable leader of Labor’s
depleted squad', in the Senate, dates, politi-
cally, from 1004, when he was returned to
the W.A. Assembly for Fremantle, in those
days he scheduled his occupation as "boiler-
maker’s assistant.” Teddy fell out of the
State Parliament in 1005, but managed to
secure a party nomination for the Senate a
year later, largely out of sympathy for his
local set-back, and, gaining a seat, has hung
on to it ever since, except for the three years
between T 9 and ’22 when lie was given a
rest by the electors and accommodated by
the Perth Trades Hall with a job. In his
early days he won and maintained the repu-
tation of being about the most confused and
least inspiring platform speaker in the W.A.
Labor movement and the comrade who could
empty a hall quickest. But he has improved
since then. He was always a hard worker.
A Melbourne resident was present at
Lagnicourt, in France, the other day when
excavations were being made for the erec-
tion of a war memorial. Hxactly at the
point, marked for the centre of the monument
and a metre under the sod a body was ex-
humed. It proved to be that of Second-
Lieutenant E. F. S. Ilayter, of the 87th Bat-
tery, Royal Artillery, who was reported miss-
ing after the battle of March 21, 1918. The
Australian onlooker was his father, who up
to that moment had no exact idea of where
his son was buried.

Some uneasiness was expressed in West-
ralia —and the Government was urged to
interfere —when Mrs. Marion Bell, who runs
a char-a-banc service between Perth and
Fremantle, announced her intention of
motoring round the continent with no com-
panion but her 11-year-old daughter. But
the apprehension seems to have been
unnecessary; the plucky lady has already
accomplished the worst part of the journey
with the minimum of mishap. She left
Perth on October 14 and arrived in Bris-
bane last week, having travelled 5000 miles
by way of Northam, Meekatharra, Port Hed-
land, Marble Bar, Broome, Derby, Hall’s
Greek, Catherine Waters, Newcastle Waters,
Daly Waters, Camooweal, Cloncnrry, Black-
all, Longroach, Dalby and Toowoomba. She
even managed without a compass or a map,
utilising always tracks of some kind, even
if they were only those used by drovers. She
had no trouble with blacks. Petrol for
1000 miles was carried in eight drums and
the tank of the car (an Oldsmobile Six) ;
there were also two tanks of water and half
a dozen bags. Mrs. Bell returns to Perth
via Sydney, Melbourne (where she will pick
up a sister), Adelaide and the route of the
Trans, line.
Died last Saturday, Lieutenant-Colonel
A. Paul, father of artist Mick. He was born
82 years ago at Windsor, his father also be-
ing of the proverbially hardy “Oxbury”
stock. Before the Commonw T ealth compul-
sory-training scheme came into force the
Colonel was head of the N.S.W. cadet sys-
tem, and subsequently was for some time
director of school drill in the education
Department.
Long-distance records are held by some
municipal pillars who were re-established at
the recent elections in N. S. Wales. Dr.
Shaw is doing his 20th consecutive term as
mayor of Wyalong; H. L. White has had
only a year less as president of Upper Hun-
ter; and John Byrnes, of Gwydir, is in his
17th year as president. Harold Morgan, of
Newtown, has had an unbroken aldermanic
run of 35 years (with many terms as mayor) ;
and A. C. Anderson, of Colo, has attended
every one of 351 meetings since he was
elected. In a record poll of 1598 votes at
Randwick ex-M.L.A. Goldstein scored all but
84—the fine work he did for returned sol-
diers as chairman of the local repatriation
committee isn't forgotten.
The Peter Russell Memorial Medal, the

northern railways
and has made im-
portant contribu-
tions to the science

The Adelaide mayoral allowance to Wal-
lace Bruce has been reviewed, in the light
of H.C.L., and raised to £1250 from the
£lOOO at which it has stood for close on
40 years. The Labor minority on the council
made the vote unanimous, but hoped it would
suggest a similar liberality in the matter of
wages to corporation employees. In the
suburbs Port Adelaide and Norwood made
records by returning the whole of the old
councils unchanged, .1. J. Woods, the famous
old local footballer, became mayor of Nor-
wood, and the persevering Mrs. Agnes
Knight Goode (of whom an opponent once
pleasantly remarked that it was always
“Good-night, Agnes,” when the numbers
went up) has at last; achieved her ambition
and got on to a council—St. Peters.
Gone to his account, Thomas Johnstone,
who helped to build the foundations of Sale

from Ulster over 70 years ago, was an early
chairman of directors of the famous Long
Tunnel mine, and for 30 years coached the
rough stretch of country from Sale to Wal-
h'alla to attend the monthly directors’ meet-
ing. He was 88 at the end.

Marianne was born.
Tom Hotsmmi, lately elected an official of
the Melbourne Branch of the Seamen’s Union,
is a stormy petrel with some sense of humor
but a poor idea of when to use it. lit* was
the man who organised the Weeroona strike
at the time of the arrival of the American
Fleet. During the elections he was very
busy; on one occasion he swooped down on
a South Melbourne factory where the hands
had been assembled to listen to an address
by a Nationalist speaker, who when he
arrived found the men cheering a Labor
address by Botsman. Tom would also be able
to explain to sundry puzzled National-
ists the deep mystery of “Mr. Elliott of
Castlemaine.” A man giving that name
called at the Nationalist rooms and was
accepted as a volunteer to address meetings.
People who knew “Fompcy” only by re-
pute imagined that “Mr. Elliott of Castle-
maine” was the Senator, and gave him a
cheer—and were subsequently amazed to hear
him denouncing Nationalism and all its
works.
The Parliamentary friends of retiring
Supt. Linehan (Vic.) now seem intent upon
demanding an inquiry on his behalf into the
raid on a house in Fitzroy, where badge
No. 80, belonging to Police Chief Blarney,
was flourished by some person unknown.
Chief Secretary Argyle rapped Linehan over
the knuckles for the procedure he adopted,
bu: Linelian’s friends are not disposed to let
him go out admonished —unjustly, as they
believe —-after serving for 40 years. So an
inquiry of some sort may be forced, after
all.
Robert Stout, the retiring Chief Justice of
M.L., is now 81 but exceptionally hale and
hearty. In his time he has been a Uni-
versity lecturer, an Attorney-General, a Pre-
mier and Chancellor of N.Z. University. IBs
political career extended from 1872 till 1897 ;
he was the most formidable debater of his
day—“a bonny fighter,” as W. P. Reeves
puts it in the “Long White Cloud.” He
shocked the early- and mid-Victorians by
his agnosticism, and bored the succeeding
generations by his prohibitionist views. On
the Bench he prided himself on his know-
ledge of commercial law and usages, and de-
lighted in bankruptcy proceedings, the dodges
of ingenious debtors and his own acumen
in seeing through them pleasing him in
equal proportions.
Death has ended the T.B. Sailors and
Soldiers’ attempt to test the Spahlinger
treatment on its own account. The asso-
ciation decided to send A. P. Jorgensen, an
ex-soldier, to the Montana Sanatorium,
which is patronised by Spahlinger, the asso-
ciation paying all exes. When it last heard
from the patient he was in the sanatorium.
Now t , however, a cable announces his death
from a chill contracted whilst crossing the
Channel to England. Apparently Spahlinger
had none of his much-advertised serum avail-
able, and Jorgensen had decided to attempt
a return to the sunshine of Australia.
Two motor-cars t.<*ok in Collins-street,
Melbourne, as part, of a long, long trail last
week. One was a 7Uh.p. Citroen which N.
R. Westwood is driving round the continent
from Perth via Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney
and Adelaide; and the other was a Rugby
which has brought R. F. Hopkins from
Darwin with his family aboard, and which
he intends shall take him home again by
umy of Perth.
The first home-grown product to bag the
job of M.L. Police Commissioner is William
Bernard Mcllveney, a bald, clean-shaven,
medium-sized stick of dynamite who came
cut of a West Coast goldmine to be teacher,
telegraphist and borough councillor before be-
ginning his 32 years’,contest with criminal-
ity. One of his first cases was that of the
baby-farmer Minnie Dean, the last woman to
be hanged in M.L. His last big case was
that of the baby-farmer Cooper, hanged in
1922. Mcllveney works by lightning in-
tuitions, then sits down to compose classic
reports at white-hot speed upon a little
typewriter of the same brand as that on
which President Wilson beat out his Four-
teen Points. His memory is so constructed
that he can quote with accuracy from these
same reports for 30 years back. His pet
relaxation is his gramophone.
“S.T.S.”: “The largest block held by any
one man on this continent” was the claim of
just-dead Andrew M. Wooldridge for his hold-
ing of 20,000 square miles at Barrow Creek,
Central Australia, in the ’eighties (B.
10/12/’25). Adelaide-born, he was in the
crew that won the first boat-race for St.
Peter’s School, on the Port River. He leaves
descendants in every mainland State.
Colonel Mackesy, of Whangarei (M.L.),
over whom the Last Post was sounded last
month, was one of those volunteer officers
who welcomed the Great War with both
hands. The son of a Maori War veteran
who received a valuable grant of land for
distinguished services, Mackesy made such
an enthusiastic job of his command of the
North Auckland Mounted Rifles and pressed
so many of his relatives into its ranks that
its initials were locally understood to mean
“Nearly All Mackesy’s Relations.” He saw
service on Gallipoli and in Egypt and
Palestine, was Military Governor of East
Jordan and liaison officer to the King ot
the Iledjaz.
William Pember Peeves, economist _ and
litterateur, is visiting his native Maoriland

successor to Ballanee. But Dick Seddon,
Colonel MICK BRUXNER, who
last, week resigned the position of
leader of the Progressive party
(N.S.W.)
Minister of Works in the same administra-
tion, made his big voice and presence felt,
and intimated to his colleagues that those
who were not prepared to serve under him
might get elsewhere. Reeves and the
rest acquiesced in Seddon’s leadership and
carried on ; but when the Agent-Generalship
was offered him Reeves gladly accepted it.
He is 68 now, and is visiting M.L. as chair-
man of the National Bank of N.Z.
The retirement of Captain T. S. Weston
from the N.Z. Shipping Co. after 47 years'
service recalls the drift of the Waikato in
1899. Weston was in charge when the
steamer left London. On June 5 her pro-
peller-shaft broke 180 miles south of the
Cape, and she wallowed about the southern
Indian Ocean for six weeks before being-
sighted by the barquentine Tecora. Failing
to tow her, the Tecora pushed on to report
the matter, and the Waikato drifted for
another month. Then the Asloun appeared
on September 15, and after 22 days’ towing
got the derelict to Fremantle on October. 9,
after she had drifted 4500 miles. A livelier
experience came to Weston during the war
when the Hurunui was torpedoed in the Eng-
lish Channel. But he came out of it well —
only one man was lost.
A martyr to indigestion in his later years,
it irritated John Woods, formerly one of
Berry’s Ministers, to see fellow-legislators
going gaily through the whole menu. _ One
(lay while he was toying with a biscuit lie
watched Albert Harris, then Walhalla’s
choice, despatching all that came along.
“More sweets?” queried the waitress to
Harris. “Sweets !” echoed Woods bitterly ;
“bring him a bran mash.” But they are
both under the sod now. There were times
when those who knew them would have given
anything to see Woods as amiable as Harris
and Harris as angry as Woods could be.
“Cue” : The names of Westralia’s first con-
signment of colonists who landed from the
ship Parmelia in 1829 used to be preserved
in the State year-books; the list included
some names that have since been cut deep
into the annals of the land. The last sur-
vivor of the historic band was a woman who
lived well into this century; she was one of
several children on board. I remember see-
ing another of the original Swan River
settlers who had also arrived in his early
youth. It was 30 years ago, and he was being
tried for sheep-stealing at the age of 80.
However, lie was acquitted, and left the dock
with the cheerful alacrity of a man who feels
that a whole lot of life is still in front of
him.
Morris Jacobs, the 99-year-old Geelong
ancient whose wife helped him to celebrate
the 72nd anniversary of their wedding the
other day, used to be known as “the Walking
Till.” His eyesight was not too good, and
he did not rely upon it completely in dealing
with money; he kept his coins upon his per-
son, each denomination in its own pocket.,
With remarkable accuracy and speed money
received was dropped into the right recep-
tacle, and if change was wanted the two
hands dug out the required amount rapidly.
The human cash-register could estimate the
amount of a day’s takings with astonishing
accuracy, even before he had made the nightly
count. '

•* * * *
“Jim Crow”: I wonder how thick the
skin on the sole of a Binghi’s foot is. One day an
old fellow came to me complaining that he had sore
feet, and I saw that their soles were badly cracked.
Asa poor joke I handed him a bag containing a
dozen boot-protectors, and told him how they were
used. To my surprise he sat down on the floor,
stuck them into the soles of his feet and marched off.
I saw him about three weeks later and asked how
his feet were. He proudly exhibited them —the pro-
tectors were still in.
* * * *
“Alastor”: “Up Top” (B. 19/11/’25) re-
fers to the cunning of the crow in avoiding baited
meat at his camp. But it didn’t matter. When the
crow takes a bait and feels sick, it flies to the
nearest tree and settles on a thin limb, where it
swings, head downwards, until it vomits the bait.
If there is no tree within reach, the wiseacre selects
a fence for the ceremony. Despite the statements
of ‘’Two-Up” my experience compels me to put the
eaglehawk before the crow for cunning in avoiding
baited meat. The jaw-bone and tongue of a sheep
are first favorite with the hawk; so those who
wish to beat this wily prowler must never neglect
to bait these parts.
* * * *
“ Jimsey”: What, is the biggest eel on re-
cord? On the Upper Hawkesbury recently I helped
to drain a lagoon which to my knowledge had been
silted up for over 25 years. In the mud we found
dozens of big eels. The largest was a few inches
short of 9ft. long, and weighed 531 b. They were
too rank for us to eat; but the pigs enjoyed them.
“ Larrapinta ”: “L.R.L.” states (B.
l/10/’25) that it was the late David Lindsay, and not
1, who presented Cubbagee’s skeleton to the Adelaide
Museum. He is mistaken. David Lindsay had very
little to do with Cubbagee, living or dead. As
this is the first time my word has ever been doubted
in print, let me remark (1) the “old men” of the
Warramung tribe made me Cubbagee’s blood brother;
(2) the records of the S.A. Museum contain no
mention of David Lindsay’s name in connection with
this matter; (3) David Lindsay was not in Adelaide
at the time of Cubbagee’s death; and (4) Mr. Conroy,
one of the S.A. Museum officials, remembers Cub-
bagee’s death and is prepared to corroborate my
statements.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: A deal has been said about
the eucalypts on the Andes, in Argentina, California
and other places; but I don’t think their conquest
of Abyssinia has been mentioned. The late King
Menelik had them planted around his new capital
(Addis Adaba) about 30 years ago, and they have
also been extensively planted in the Shoa uplands.
They sometimes grow a dozen feet a year there, and
there are now mighty forests of them. The blue-gum
is the favorite.
* * * *
“Alastor”: “Atherton” (B. 19/13/’25)
refers to the liking of the North Queensland abos.
for roast goanna. I know whites whose favorite
dish is the goanna’s tail. A cattle-station in Springsure
district (C.Q.) has for years protected the lizard, and
any hand found killing one is sacked. Near the
station one will see any day five or six goannas
ied up to an ironbark-tree. Only the tail is used,
and w’hen the tail is secured the victim gets its
freedom. The manager swears the joint is the
sweetest thing on earth.
* * * *
“Lance Jack”: “Bill R.” (B. 5/11/’25)
reckons that it’s beyond a 10-year-old Australian to
yoke 18 bullocks “on his only.” Why, it’s every-day
work to many bush kids. When I was 10 I many
times yoked eight bullocks, put them in the dray and
went carting. As for lifting yokes being a strong
man’s job, if a yoke is that heavy it has no business
on a bullock. My method was to first shove the yoke
across the neck, put in the near-side bow and then
go under the near-sider’s neck to put in the off-
side bow —I was not tall enough to reach over.
* * * *
“Mephisto”: There is another explanation
of the fire-walking ceremonies (B. 12/11/’25). The
soles of the feet perspire more profusely than any
other part of the body. When the fire-walker places
his foot on the stone for a fraction of a second
the perspiration vaporises and there is formed
momentarily a thin blanket of gas. This is a
very bad conductor of heat, and as the foot is
on the stone for the shortest possible time, the
vapor does not become very hot. When the walker
lifts his foot the perspiration flows afresh and is
vaporised on the next stone. It is known that
the hand may be dipped into molten lead for a
moment without injury if it has been plunged into
water first. The blanket of water-vapor protects it.
“Green Yale”: “M.G.” (B. 26/11/’25) is
incorrect in stating that the brolga, or native
companion, dances only at sunrise. Before the
western plains of Vic. were cut up for wheat farming
I have seen numbers of birds—up to eight—holding
corroborees at all hours of the day.
“Huffin-Guffin”: In my ringbarking days
we did the job properly. We always cut. through
the bark and sapwood into the “brown.” Using
this method, I have seen trees rung in the forenoon
quite dry in the leaves by night. This in the
summer-time only, however. The only trees from
which we took the bark alone were honeysuckles
(Bankaias) ; a strip of bark about 6in. wide from
around the trunk did them. With our method of
ABSOLUTELY TRUSTWORTHY.
“I wouldn't mind giring you a couple of days' digging, my man,
if I could be sure you would not be helping yourself to things
behind my back.”
“Not me, sir — why, I was caretaker at the public baths for seven
years an' never took: one, sir.”
ringing, no suckers grew, except on young stringy-
bark. You could cut them, right down and they
would sprout again. The most difficult tree to kill
is the she-oak. A she-oalc trunk grows in sections,
with folds of bark almost into the heart sometimes.
But surely nobody is fool enough to try to kill the
few remaining she-oaks. Ringbarking or wattle-
bark stripping on a spring or early summer morning
—what better life could one have ? It stirs my old
blood to think of it.
* * * *
“R.S.” : “Jim Carew” says most wild ducks
build their nests in trees. That is not correct, at all
events as to the N.S.W. west, where they mostly
nest on the ground beneath some bush which gives
protection from the attack of hawks.
* * * *
“Henry Pannikin” : Among Australia’s lucky
men I drop David Henson, of Richmond (N.S.W.). Em-
ployed to clear the ferry-wire by chopping the hya-
cinth away with an axe, he missed his stroke one
evening and fell overboard between the wire and
punt, where he was pinned by. the neck. An ocean
boat was coming up the river and threatened to
drown him in its wash. In his fall he had kept a
grip of the axe, and although only his head was
clear of the water he chopped enough from the side
of the punt to get his head free before the steamer
passed. But he had only a few seconds to spare.
DRY GIN.
“Mauve Milanese”: A good many of the
old homes in the Tasmanian midlands were built of
piss, and stood well. One 1 know was pulled
down after 50 years, and where the pise was
dumped hundreds of young wattles sprang up. The
seeds must have lain there for all those years and
germinated when exposed.
“Golub”: It is a little-known fact that
all snakes, venomous
and non - venomous
alike, are possessed of
glands which secrete
a toxic liquid.. In
the non-poisonous
snakes these glands,
which are a modifica-
tion of the salivary
glands in warm-
blooded creatures, are
without ducts, and
consequently their
secretion escapes di-
rectly into the ali-
mentary tract. There
it plays the part of a
digestive juice,
ing to activate fer-
ments and to bring
about the solution and
absorption of matter
that would otherwise
remain insoluble and
undigested. This seems
to establish clearly
that it is the digestive
function of the venom-
glands’ secretion which
is the primary one,
while the use of the
poison against ene-
mies is a secondary
function. It has been
asserted that one use
of the venom is to
enable fanged snakes
to capture birds and
small animals for food

doing so a poisonous
snake invariably bites
its prey. Probably,
however, the reason for
This is that the reptile
is preparing the food
so that it will be the
better and the more
promptly digested
when it enters the
snake’s alimentary tract.
“C. Coral" : A Straits island woman out on
the reefs the other day trod on a stonefish. Her com-
panion, a hefty girl of 18, picked the baleful thing
up cautiously to see whether it had left its spike
in the foot, and herself got a dose of the poison as
the apparently-dead fish shot round and pierced her
thumb. The two women had to be carried ashore,
and the second developed such serious symptoms that
a hospital trip to Thursday Island was necessary,
tetanus and fits supervening. The fish that did the
damage seems to have been unusually well charged ;
but both the patients recovered.
* * * *
“Harry J.”: As a youngster I learned the
abo.’s way of hauling a ’possum out of a hollow
tree. Old Black Charlie secured a six-foot green-
box stick and broke the branches off so as to leave
a fork with ragged-ended prongs about an inch long.
These he spat upon several times; then he lowered
the stick into the hollow until it touched the prey.
When he slowly turned it round, the fur adhered to
the wet prongs until he actually had a grip of the
’possum’s skin. In a few seconds he had the
makings of a strong-smelling supper.
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: Some time ago a resi-
dent oi Furner, near Millicent (S.A.), came across
a dormouse opossum, a very rare little marsupial.
Zoologists were deeply interested, and secured it for
museum purposes. Recently W. E. Gard, of the same
locality, whilst splitting a dry log brought a second
specimen to light, and succeeded in capturing it
without injury. As it takes to honey readily, and
seems contented, it is hoped that it will survive the
trip to Adelaide and become an interesting exhibit
in the; Zoo. It is a beautiful little creature, about
Sin. long, and resembles a ring-tail ’possum in every
detail.

“Pick” : Though the menagerie elephant is
at times of great assistance in the transport of
the circus caravan, he sometimes takes a playful
turn and acts contrariwise. Once when Eroni’s
circus was fording the Queanbeyan River (N.S.tN.)
the elephant was requisitioned to push behind the
heavier vehicles, which had become bogged in the
sand. For a while he heaved mightily at his task,
then suddenly floundered off into the deeper water
below the crossing. There for hours he con-
temptuously disregarded the frantic appeals of his
keepers, who, by command and cajolery, sought to
induce him to come out and behave himself. He
drenched those who approached him with showers
of water from his trunk, and with a bombardment
of mud and sand held up everything that attempted
to pass over. When he had a big crowd of travellers
stemmed back on the bank and had delayed the
circus trek long enough to compel an abandonment
of the performance billed for the night, he wallowed
out and resumed his place in the march with an air
of having for once thoroughly enjoyed circus life.

The Super-Six principle to-day, as always, is the
most import ant exclusive patent held by any
automobile manufacturer. It is responsible for
Hudson-Essex being the largest selling 6-cylinder
cars in the world.
That leadership is the result of ten years’ concen-
tration in refining notable motor-cars around the
Super-Six principle. The constant improvement
of quality, performance, appearance and relia-
bility has been paralleled by astonishing reductions
in price.
In to-day’s Hudson and Essex, economies possible
only to the largest production of 6-cylinder cars
in the world give value advantages never held
by any builder. Never before was their supremacy
in quality and price so outstanding.

“H.E.R.”: Apropos of destroying green
timber other than by ringbarking (B. i9/11/’25).
Would not the old-time method of cracking up logs
by boring holes iii the trunks and filling with un-
slacked lime, plus a few spoonsful of water, and
then plugging, be more effective? Of course with
green timber the adding of water would be unneces-
sary. If this plan were carried out, I fancy it.
would be more active than sulphuric acid in killing
tha tree and likelier to shake the stump to the
roots. It was the method used before dynamite
came in vogue, and still does much service in split-
ting slabs of granite.
* * * *
“Feng-Sliui”: “Serintan” (B. 3/12/’25)
makes unnecessary mystery about the derivation of
“cockatoo.” Malay kakak means elder sister, and
tua means old, and the Malays are an observant race
with a gift for descriptive nicknames. The hook-
nosed bird is plentiful in Malaya, and Malayan tre-
pang-fishers traded to Australia long, long ago.
“Te W.”: “Serintan” (B. 3/12/’25) is right as to
the Malayan origin of the word “cockatoo”—in Malay
it is kakaktua; evidently the name was manufactured
from the sound of the bird’s call, as so many (trivial)
bird names are. For over two centuries some—it is
not known exactly which—members of the cockatoo
family have been so called, the screechers being pecu-
A MOST INCONSIDERATE WUMMAN.
O’REGAN: “I’ve good news for you, Mac. The hospital has just

liar to the Australian region, including part of the
Malay Archipelago, except one species which homes
in the Philippines. By the way, the name “emu” is
not of abo. origin, as many think, but is a form of
the Portuguese word “ema” applied by early naviga-
tors to the Ceram cassowary.
* * * *
“D. Ennis” : Mick Iliney, of Spring Creek
(N.S.W.), owns a comeback ewe that isn’t doing her
whack to keep Australia white. Lately she produced
twin lambs, one black and one white, both male—the
sire was a pure merino. Would you believe it, she
favors the black fellow 1
“G.S.M.”: I am no lover of the crow, but
fairness bids me say that he does many valuable
acts. He certainly is a black horror during lambing,
but most lambs (say 97 per cent.) are protected by
their mothers, except in a bad season. “Xamile”
(B. 3/12/’25) must be singularly unobservant if in
25 years’ experience he has never seen the crow do
one useful act. Doesn’t John Crow clean up carcases
that would otherwise be breeding-places for flies?
Burning is not always advisable on account of bush-
fires, and timber is not too plentiful on most stations.
Of course the crow is a curse to bogged, cast and
weak stock; but, as “Buttenderry” pointed out
(November 26), we as stock-breeders are far too
casual in our treatment of our money-getters. By
proper insurance (and by insurance I mean irriga-
tion) there should be no such thing even in a bad
drought as large numbers of helpless animals just
waiting to give up the ghost. Poisoning during lamb-
ing is not difficult. Strychnine is good, easily
handled, safer and easier to carry than phosphorus,
and is in every way more efficient if used sparingly.
Too big a dose makes John Crow vomit the bait.
* * * *
“Sigs” : What a difference between hacks
about country towns and hacks away out! The
townsman generally owns a middle-aged, harmless-
looking thing whose walking gait jogs the rider’s
inside out, and whose canter resembles a cow’s—a
prad that is ridiculously over-tackled and just a
hide-full of discomfort and ungainliness. The cove
out yonder teaches his to walk fast, he canters it. on
a loose or tight rein according to its gait, and some
can be taught to amble, which is the most comfortable
gait of all to ride. Rare good hacks will, when
being pulled up, “swing” froiii a canter into a run-
ning amble without giving a jar; and occasionally,
on a cattle-station, you may come across a hack that
will, when turning with a beast, “swing” in his
stride, instead of propping to turn ; but no travelling
musterer or bagman is likely to strike such luck in a
purchase unless the animal’s a “bad cow” that has
the wind up all the permanent hands. The judging
of hacks at country shows is all wrong. None of
these virtues are taken into account. No man can
judge a hack from the ground. He must be on its
back.
* * * *
“Barra”: I nominate as the most maligned
Australian reptile the harmless but ugly little gecko.
Known by such misleading names as rock-adder,
wood-adder and rock-scorpion, it has a reputation
as bad as one can be. Its bite is supposed by
many bushmen to be poisonous, and its saliva is
alleged to cause painful skin-eruptions. But it is
absolutely harmless. Australia has about 60 species,
the most common being the broad-leaf-tailed varie y.
This, when handled by man or pursued by an
enemy, oftegi throws off its tail, which continues
to wriggle for some time, thus engaging the atten-
tion of the pursuer whilst the gecko makes its
escape. A new tail soon replaces the discarded one,
and is generally different in color and size.
“Up Top”: The N.Q. abo. loses no chances
where his tucker is concerned. Any hollow log
lying by a likely-looking waterhole he slings into
it, for fish have a
habit of nosing into
hollow logs in search
of tucker. Passing
that way later he
dives in, blocks the
hollow with his hands,
and brings the log to
the surface. There’s
always the off-chance of
an inquisitive fish being
inside. In the river-
ways eels have a liking
for submerged tree-
trunks as residential
chambers. Lying on
the bank above, Binghi
patiently probes the
log with a long, pli-
able strand of lawyer-
cane, the probing end
of which has been
chewed. On with-
drawal, should the end
be touched with a film
of slime, he knows the
cane has grazed an
eel. Then follows a
game of skill and
patience. With persua-
sive prods Binghi
gently lures the eel
from its inaccessible
cranny into the main
hole of the log. Then
he pan dive into the
wat£r and thrust
straight down with his
long-pronged fish-spear.
Most sea-eels are very
vicious, strong, and
quick as greased lightning, thdfr hideous heads being
armed with a formidable array of needle-sharp teeth.

“The Jumper”: More important happen-
ings than weddings are not to interfere
with milking (B. 12/11/’2s)j I know of at least
one instance in which a Ban gnalarid cocky compla-
cently tugged away at the while the district
scoured the countryside for IhisklO-year-old daughter,
who had disappeared from homp* mysteriously. When
someone remarked on his seemifcig\ callousness, “Dam-
mit,” he grunted, “th’ fl;u Din* cows gotter be

“Yacko”: Touching some of the fare to
which our explorers and pioneers have had recourse.
About 1885 V. V. Brown and his companion, Har-
wood, an assayer, while on their way to examine
a tin-mine at Bynoe Harbor (N.T.) were bushed
for 10 days. Their food for three days consisted
solely of March-flies. The only nutriment that Riche,
one of the naturalists of the D’Entrecasteaux expedi-
tion, found to sustain him when lost for several
THE NEWCHUMS SAVE THE FAMILY HEIRLOOMS.
days was the berries of the Leucopogon richei,
commonly known as “old man’s beard.” Leichhardt
was once reduced to soup made from greenhide, and
flying-fox stew. Ernest Giles, on a forced march
alone, was thankful to find a young dying wallaby.
The scarcity of water compelled him to eat it
raw. Poor Wills had a liking for roasted bush-
rats. Ernest Favenc and Burke both sampled
carpet-snakes and goannas. The fat, white timber-
grub (bardie) Favenc voted delicious. Koalas were
on the menu during Strzelecki’s expedition into
Gippsland. And camel-skin and viscera were part
of Warburton’s diet when he crossed the continent.
“Coot”: Two districts in Centralia per-
petuate the names of horses. Roan’s Plains were
named by Sturt after the Roan, a horse which
was turned out to die near Cooper’s Creek when the
fate of the expedition seemed sealed. Fifteen years
later HoWitt found it alive and well. Bawly’s
Plains take their name from another horse used in
the same expedition.
* * * *
“Ivoolamarra”: Do the Bulletin’s dry-
snake experts know anything concerning a reptile
called the adder-brown snake, frequently found in
the district between Mackay and St. Lawrence.
(N.Q.) ? This wriggler is by far the most venomous
of any of our Queensland reptiles, and if given the
opportunity can put “finis” to the chapter of life
in much quicker time than even the dreaded death-
adder. With the exception of the rock-python, well
known in the Cloncurry district, it is also the
largest of the venomous species, and while not as
aggressive as the “tiger” it will nevertheless show
fight with little provocation. The biggest one I
have seen measured 10ft. 4in. and accounted for
two good cattle-dogs, both splendid snake-killers.
Both dogs were dead in less than 12 minutes
from the time of being bitten. The snake is a
much darker brown than the ordinary brown crawler,'
and the head is very large and exactly the same
shape as a death-adder’s.
* * * *
“ Jesmond” : This is in the farthest-south
of Victoria. The old willow-tree at the dairy was
cut down during the winter and sawn up into 3ft.
lengths. Half of it was burnt during the cold
weather; the remainder is now a mass of green wil-
low shoots. The winter was almost the driest on
record, and as the tree had seemed to be dead for
years it is a mystery what the shoots are living on.
They are not in contact with the ground at all.
“Mate”: Tlie sailing-ship shellback be-
lieved that a shark’s heart, when cut out, wo ' l
continue to beat until sunset, whatever time
operation was performed. In calms, shark-ca c
was the most popular sport. Any sizable s 1 was
thoroughly dissected. The parts in demand we
the teeth, the skull fin some species alleged o re
semble a woman’s torso), and the backbone 01 a
walking-stick—and a messy job to clean this 1 was.
On one of my apprenticeship voyages we had an
old whaler who swore by the liver-oil for “rumaties,”
but the trying-out did not make for popularity.
The heart was usually left on the for’ard bitts or
some such accessible place, and occasionally inspected.
The pulsing would keep up for hours, but I don’t
remember satisfactorily testing the sunset theory.
Shark-catching was a tropical pastime, and dark-
ness followed quickly on sunset, which made observa-
tion difficult. Another disturbing element was lack
of scientific sympathy from a mate whose “You
boys, get buckets and brooms and clear up this
mess” generally ended things. Incidentally,
the saiiorman—usually most kindly to all living
things—took a delight in torturing a shark. When
one was landed on deck, all hands were eager to
get a dig at it in some way. A favorite method.
When the scavenger was too small for backbone or
teeth to be any use as curios, was to chop off the
tail and let the rest go, to be eaten by its cobbers.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: One of the best ways
to catch a cunning dingo is to set a tempting bait
on a branch or a stake, about which a number of
steel spring traps have been set, in the shallow part
of the creek or waterhole at which Warrigal usually
drinks. When the wily one trots down to fill his
“billycan” and whiffs the offering, after a few suspi-
cious sniffs he wades cautiously in to have a close-up
smell, and invariably gets a foot in one of the hid-
den traps. By the time he has given up waltzing
and hoTvding he will probably be fast by every foot,
ai d is often drowned when the trapper comes round
in the morning. Of course this dodge can’t be worked
in water deeper than 18 inches or so.
* * * *
“Ivriz”: There are some decent sardines
to be caught on the Nor’-Westralian coast. While
a steamer was anchored in Shark Bay a member of
the crew, trying to hook one of the large sharks
seen around the ship, lately got a pull on his line
and took a turn round the bollard of the steam
winch. But the winch itself was required to hoist
on deck the 2801 b. rock cod that had attached
itself. The head alone weighed 841 b.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: I once asked an old N.Q.
Binghi what fish he considered the best eating. He
thought seriously for a while ; then his face lit up
with, a reminiscent smile. “Shark,” he said emphati-
cally. “By cripe, you taste him two-three day.”
THE SEEKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Upon a lonely forest rise
She stood serene and fair;
Her hands were shaded o’er her eyes
To hide the sunset glare.
She gazed around in mild surprise
To see no lover there.
Her hair that bands could never tie
Waved in its wild unrest,
A tawny gold that tongues defy,
Though seen within the west—
The color of the evening sky
When Nature goes to rest.
A form such as the painters see
In fancy’s mystic glass
Stood here in warm reality
Upon the forest grass;
The scented winds were loath to flee
And loitered round that lass.
I pictured then the loving knight
Who should this maiden woo—
And sure he was a tardy wight
To leave her waiting too!
I would that I were young to-night
To see such loving through!
I spoke to her in accents meek,
And leant upon my staff—
“ Who is this lover that you seek?”
She answered with a laugh:
“I’ve searched for him for nigh a week—
The brindle heifer’s calf!”

The really swaggah party of the week was
the forgathering at the Royal Colonial In-
stitute. Here the dressing was all ft Ja carte,
and music as good as the ornate food was
supplied by a group of artists directed by
Charles Smythe. Composer May Summer-
belle played the march from her pen which
is a London topic of the moment —it has been
made so by the band of the Grenadier
Guards. Once you had crossed the draw-
bridge and shot through the chasm traversed
by the lift, you found yourself standing be-
fore the chiefs of the Bligh-street fastness,
Hugh Denison and his lady. In true baro-
nial manner they were greeting the guests,
while sturdy henchmen and knights-at-arms
like Arthur Rickard, Albert Gould, Alfred
Meeks and Kelso King presented the daunt-
less front of perfect laundry to the oncomer.
Hugh Denison’s lady, very satisfactorily
clothed, according to the female eye, in ropes
of pearls and many diamonds, added a frock
of roseate georgettes; and very handsome
was Mrs. Kelso King’s black-and-silver
apparel. Mrs. George Earp’s georgettes
were sable, but with a vampish glitter of
rhinestones. Impressive among the hun-
dreds that pressed politely but relentlessly
on one another’s heels was Ruth Beale, and
anotner eye-arrester was Sydney Hospital’s
matron Kellctt. The Roystone Davey couple
came to the gathering; so did the Justice
Jameses, the Major-General Brands, Town
Clerk Layton and just-home-again Inspec-
torrGeneral of Police James Mitchell. From
which specimen handful you can glean the
extent of the party and the glory thereof.
Women take their club-life much more
seriously than men do, and regard their
president as quite a personage. Last week
the Feminist Club laid down the red carpet
in honor of a former president of a sister
institution, the Lyceum. The guest of
the King-street eyrie was Mrs. Robert
Williams, one of the cleverest of her sex
and most indefatigable among its students
in Sydney. The lady, who knows the Nor-
thern Territory better even than she' does
the North Shore suburb which is now her
home, is a sort of modern Lady Mary Wort-
ley Montagu in her commentaries on the
many lands she has known. The McMillan
dame was honored on her own hearth, as it
were, the Women’s Club being festooned
with blue delphiniums and wreathed in rosy
smiles to the glory of its ex-president. A
crystal rose-bowl and a silver filigree basket
heaped with red roses were handed to her
to the accompaniment of dulcet-toned com-
pliments by the new president, Mrs. W. 11.
Read. The afternoon was set to music by
Mrs. 11. B. Allard, whose singing is of the
quality that can never be heard too often.
Marie Narelle, in a shimmering silver dress
that trailed the green of Ireland in its train,
oanie home again on Saturday to the public
that has loved her so well and so loyally
through 15 years or more of absence.
The Town Hall was crowded with the old
admirers and hundreds of iicav ones, and
Marie, in a voice higher and lighter than
Sydney had remembered it, poured out her
Irish heart. Newly-returned Marr Thomp-
son and his wife sat in the audience, and in
the interval the veteran Showman recalled
stories of the days when Marie, in a Colleen
Bawn cape and with a black curl drawn
over her shoulder, was known as one of
Sydney’s prettiest girls and sweetest singers.
Justice Gordon, too —he married another
sweet concert-singer—turned an attentive
ear. and there were banks of flowers and
tornadoes of applause. This week the lady
revisits Armidale and the Northern Rivers.
The eye wandered from splashes of summer
frocks in high sunlight to the riding-breeks
of dashing competitors on the heights of
Crow’s Nest on Saturday afternoon. The
occasion was an R.S.P.C.A. gymkhana, or-
ganised by Amy Marshall, and the grounds
of the old Hay home were thrown wide, both
for the events and the tea-drinking that
followed. The Christmas-fodder account for
the Long Bay Horses’ Home should be con-
siderably strengthened, for over one thousand
came to the gee-gees’ party. The local
Mayoress (Mrs. Watt) tied the ribbons
around the necks of the winning nags, though
it was evident that her love for the per-
formers didn’t quite equal her timidity. Miss
Compton-Legge was kept busy during this
part of the proceedings in enticing them with
plump carrots to behave like gentlemen.
Those famous ice-skaters, the tall Wilson
sisters, stuck to the polar atmosphere and
dispensed ice-creams. And sticking recalls
that of a field of one hundred in the musical
chairs only two riders and their mounts
came unstuck.
Girl Guides and Wolf Clubs excepted,
every branch of any service that wears a
uniform has been busy farewelling General
Brand, who leaves for Melbourne early in
1926. There’s been a dinner from the Staff
Corps in Victoria Barracks’ mess room while
the old silver wine-waggon trundled round
the ancient cedar-table to the hum of soldier
songs that made the rafters ring, with Brig.-
General Phillips in the top chair, and
Artillerymen Cox-Taylor, Alderman. Bruggy,
Thompson and a score or more besides to
swell the chorus. The Rifle Association,
with veteran rifle-shot Edwin Brown, of
I arramatta, as chief spokesman, also for-
gathered to thank the departing Base Com-
mandant for his interest in their pet weapon.
The United Service Institution, which has
taken a new lease of life since Commodore
Wardle shook it up, rose gallantly to the
same occasion. Its luncheon to General
Brand at the Wentworth combined angels on
horseback with ladies at table—the latter a
startling innovation at United Service cele-
oration s.
Sydney’s scribes laid aside their tablets
on Thursday night, and even while an ex-
pectant continent palpitated for their next
words of wisdom or of merriment they sat
in a great body to do Rod Quinn honor.
The concert at the Conservatorium was
unique in this, that it was a complimentary
gesture to the poet and the programme was
gemmed with works of his composition.
One of his poems of -the sea was sung by
Bar tie Philp; Charles Smythe sang “St.
Mary s,” another of Rod’s works, to which
Alfred Hill has written some of his good
music; Lawrence Campbell gave fine value
to “The Men Who Try,” and Hilda Aiken
finished up the concert with Rod’s “Cushat
Dove.” The poet himself sat up in the front
seat with niece Marjorie (herself a poetess)
when he was not wandering round to the
back of the stage to have a word with Nor-
man Campbell, who was stage-managing
amid difficulties. It was a cheery gather-
ing, and a feeling of great friendship warmed
the hearts of all, so that when the notes
of “Auld Lang Syne” burst forth the hall
rang with the response from hundreds of
throats, and. there was a warm clasping of
hands throughout the great audience. On
the stage the performers and Rod and Nor-
man Campbell were linked in a tight grip,
and there were laughing voices that trembled
on the verge of tears.
Leader of the Opposition T. R. Bavin and
his lady gave their usual big end-of-the-year
party at the Queen’s Club the other night,
and singer Ethel Lewis was the unofficial
guest of honor. _ She sails back to her hus-
band in India before Christmas. Another
party that attracted the best brands of silk
hose was staged by the new Mrs. Ganger
Owen. This is her first big function since she
began her reign at Dilbur, and she dressed
her part in lioney-colored raiment. Gladys
Owen cheered up her own neutral-toned frock-
ing with a currant-red hat, and the woman-
kind of almost every professional personage
in Sydney walked in the sun and shade of
the gardens—there wasn't a male in the
landscape. That made it an afternoon party
after the best Dunedin precedent! In that
serious city it is only after dinner that men
are available as social appendages.
Herewith Victoria Cowdroy, the girl in
her teens whose clever hands have won her a
schola rsliip
worth £l5O.
Tli e artistic
one is a stu-
dent at the

lege, has been

and is his

and is respon-
sible for many
o f Farmer’s
effective adver-
tisements. The
present award
is a result of the ball held by the Society of
Artists during the winter. May Moore made
the little picture of her.
Zella Lewis, now of Darling Point and
formerly of Young, rustled up the aisle of
St. Mark’s on brother Cardiff’s arm the
other night to exchange “I wills” with Gor-
don Butterworth. The bridegroom, not so
long ago of Brisbane, is now of the same
suburb as his bride; and both of them as
they bent their knees to the plump white-
satin cushions considerately placed in posi-
tion by two picturesque pages might be re-
garded as improvements and decorations of
the waterfront. The bride, slim and fair,
trailed ivory georgettes weighted with pearls;
in her wake came a silver train like a trail
of phosphorescence, and a tulle veil that cas-
caded to a hem of pearls helped a bunch of
Madonna lilies to round off the effect. Vera
Lewis, JMollie Lewis and Nell Skinner
’maided in georgette pink as a sunset, and
wore Zuyder Zee bonnets of gold lace.
“Scotch” Campbell best-manned. There
were arches of pink roses, efficient and effec-
tive groomsmen and ushers, a peal of bells
and a full complement of choir-boys, with
Padre Rix to actually do the job. And,
later, there was a perfectly stunning party
at Craig-y-Don—brother Cardiff’s home—
with Mrs, Cardiff Lewis, the bride’s mother,
and Mrs. Skinner, the ’groom’s mother, help-
ing to do the honors.
Are you of those happy ones with leisure
to walk beneath the flowering ti'ees in the
Sydney Botanic Gardens, brushing your
shoulder, may-
be, in passing
against the
honeyed
blooms of some
delicately-
tinted shrub?
If you are a
lover of the
greeny vistas,
you have, no
doubt, rejoiced
over their ex-
tra dower of
beauty this
summer, and
here in the
picture is the
man who is
responsible for
a great mea-
sure of it. He
is Dr. Darnell
Smith, who
succeeded J.
H. Maiden as head of the Gardens. Since he
took control he has been enhancing the value
of land- and sea-scapes. But behind the gaily-
painted veil of Nature lie prosaic but vital
matters—the study of plant diseases, seed
testing and top dressings: with such Dr.
Smith and his experts are busied the sea-
sons round. Last year, from his storehouse,
no less than 150,000 trees and shrubs were
distributed to other parks and gardens and to
public schools. Nor is the city alone the
gainer by this Nature-lover’s knowledge; to
the farmer go grasses and fodder plants pro-
perly tested and tabulated, while the seed
museum is bursting with information of
value to the Outback. The portrait is one
of May Moore’s.
A pretty bride came from Wollstonecraft
to St. James’s to be married last week. She
was Doreen Marian Dunstan, and Norman
Robert Allen, the young man in the case,
had come even farther for the fulfilment
of his romance. He hails from Vancouver,
and is in Australia on a job for the C.P.R.
Ivory crepe Romain, silver-encrusted and flar-
ing in the new way from the hips, formed
the wedding garment, and impedimenta such
as a train in the form of a froth of tulle
and silver, a Ilohiton lace veil and a cascade
of white roses and Cattleya orchids were
duly noted as the principal lady shyly
slipped up the aisle on father's arm. Two
maids, Phyllis Shay and Doreen Strick,
ruffled after her iii brocades of gold and
larkspur blues. They achieved a mediaeval
effect in their head-dress of silver bands
with a floating backwash of tulle, and sought
the atmosphere of the Victorian era for
their posies, which were of yellow roses
edged with silver-lace frills. Mel Sheffer
came from the country to best-man, and
bride’s brother James was also alongside.
After Dr. Pritchard had declared the matri-
monial rivets welded for life the bride’s
aunt, Miss Strick, took the spotlight and
presided over a many-course dinner at the
Carlton.
Another wedding with attractive frills to
it happened at St. James’s when Thelma
Robins, only daughter of the G. T. Robinses
of Pymble, married Harvie McCallum, of
Murrumba, Goulburn. Layers of georgette
and tulle that blushed rosily swathed the
bride ; her maid, Olive Faviell, was a study
in mauve and silver. The toasts were drunk
at the Australia.
Although the wedding invitations were re-
stricted to the Bridge and Brenan families,
half of Ivirribilli bolted an early, dinner to
get over to St. Patrick’s for the bride’s pass-
ing. Muriel, who is one of the Clarence
Bridge clan, floated up the aisle in a billow
of tulle like a golden cloud. Brother Dr.
Reg squired her, and Ivy Macdonald, in pale-
lilac georgettes, was her only maid. The
groom, Dr. Andrew Brenan, was best-manned
in most orthodox fashion by brother Jack.
Father Piquet and Father Gartlan super-
vised the vow-making; and the Wentworth
liquidated the toasts. The doctor and his
hride started on a world-tour by the Or-
monde.
Margaret Frazer, the elder daughter of
the Dr. Ewan Frazers, did not marry the
son of the S’African millionaire after all;
but the other dav with great pomp and cir-
cumstance she linked up in London —at St.
Paul’s, Ivnightsbridge—with George Carbutt.
of Sussex. The wedding dress was of ivory
velvet stamped on georgette, and its train
was a lovely lace veil, Point d’Alengon, not
less than 300 years old. Younger sister
Nancy bridesmaided; and hundreds of guests
assembled at Hyde Park Hotel for the re-
ception.
Another well-known pair in the before-
Christmas wedding rush were Alexander
Cahill and Bessie May Lovelace. They
dived into matrimony at St. Matthias’s
in Paddington, with Padre Newton Stephens
as official starter. Bessie May is known
to every mermaid in the State, having served
(for love) as secretary of the N.S.W.
Amateur Swimming Association for four
years.
Episcopal circles are purring felicitations
over an engagement. The newly-ringed girl
is Norah Wright, a daughter of the Anglican
Archbishop of Sydney, and the happy man is
Maorilander Greville. Warren, the eldest son
of Major Warren, of Ilawkes Bay. Norah
brings a Sydney and an Oxford degree to
the union, so the new home is sure of two
diplomas to hang on the walls.
Mini Shelley, who came to Sydney from
England by way of Maoriland, gave the right
answer when Captain Chris. Baily put the
question to her a week or two ago. The
young lady owns a remarkable voice, and
was chosen to represent Wanganui in song
during 11.E.11.’s visit. Her father, who was
a playwright, was a descendant of the poet.
Captain Baily hails from London, served in
the Royal Engineers, and was for some time
in the Malay States.
After a very strenuous two or three years
spent taming an ogre which he now pats on
the head quite familiarly—he calls it the
Exchange Problem —big John Garvan, chair-
man of directors of the Commonwealth Bank,
will pay a visit to London early in 1920.
Wynne Whear Roberts, the clever amateur
actress, is resting in the Never Never in
preparation for London and a try for recog-
nition on its boards. She will stay with
cousin Daisy Kennedy, who before she be-
came, Mrs. John Drinkwater was the wife of
pianist Benno M'oiseiwitscli. Daisy and
Benno, by the way, are the best of friends,
meeting constantly, and living in the same
street. Moiseiwitsch is one of the artists
lucky enough (and there are few of them)
to command a crowded Albert Hall. John
McCormack is another who can draw a
packed house at the huge place. With him
still is ’cellist Lauri Kennedy; and lie’s a
cousin of Daisy, too.
Among the, feted ones of the week was
Mrs. R. R. S. Mackinnon, just returned from
her junketings in Europe, which took in the
Geneva Conference, at which she was an
Australian delegate.
Some Brisbane doings :
y vonne Banvard is off to England, and Sadie
Gale fills the gap at Bohemia. His Majesty’s re-
mains closed till things cool down, but the Empire
still crowds up for George Wallace’s revues.
Charlie Chauvel is in Sydney looking after the
Unfurling wings of “The Moth of Moonbi,” and all
around Brisbane is the innocent atmosphere of school
breaking-up concerts and amateur dramas.
Jean Crammond has resigned from the press sec-
retaryship of the Country Women's Association be-
cause she is to be married soon. Mrs. Fairfax
gave her a farewell luncheon.
Nell Douglas Graham filled the Albert Hall upon
a night of storm with her students’ elocutionary
recital. Marjory Mant, a mite with personality,
was one of the most successful. Grizel Gibson
was watched by proud Lockhart-Gibson parents in
Brunton Stephens’s “Chinee Cook” and other items ;
and Agnes Finney contributed one of the best
numbers. The audience seemed most pleased with
the play “Manakin and Minakin,” a quaint item
staged here for the first time.
On the same evening the Exhibition Concert Hall
heard Ethel Osborn singing at the benefit concert
backed by the Austral Choir. E. R, B. Jordan
conducted, little Enid Tardent played brilliantly,
Ted England gave “The Wanderer,” Archie Day
was at the organ, T. Waldron played the flute, and
baritone Ralph Moffatt sang “Eri Tu.”
Causeries Frangaise met for its last shivoo this
year in the Women’s Club rooms. The Comte de
Tournouer and his Countess were there, the Comte-
taking part in the musical and elocutionary pro-
gramme, to which Luis Pares and Mrs. Burstall also-
contributed.
Mrs. T. G. Lahey had a tea-drinking for the
wives of visiting bowlers at Bayview, Clayfield.
The terrace, decked with Dorothy Perkins roses,
was set with little tables. Pearl Lahey, Mrs. Gordon
Lahey and Mrs. Britten (M.L.) helped with the*
entertaining. The day before that party the Gar*
dens kiosk was decked out for another tea-drinking,
the wife of the president, Mrs. J. Johnston, being
hostess to the bowlers’ wives. And an afternoon for
the bowlers, as well as their spouses, was arranged
by the East Brisbane Club down by the river. The
C. Spurgins did the entertaining.
Gladys Frost, who has such lovely gowns, wore
saxe-blue figured marocain for her recital. She had
her usual large audience in the Albert Hall, and
was handed many bouquets, verbal and vegetable.
Southport has had a hectic time with its 50-year
celebrations, shingle competitions and tennis tour-
naments, clances . and a crowning of queens—Mrs.
E. M. Walsh the Automobile Queen and Miss E.
Ryder the Diggers’ ditto.

Is there any country household which cannot tell of meat,
milk and other foods being spoiled by the heat and wasted
because unfit? This means a considerable loss in a few seasons.
“ISKO” soon pays for itself by saving the cost of food 4
deterioration.
“ISKO” provides wholesome, appetising meals and co [ d l
drinks when the palate is jaded by long-continued heat. Well-
nourished folks are fortified against summer fag, those °
all ages in the “ISKOFIED" home must benefit in health.
"ISKO," which may be attached to any ice-chest,
connects with the house electric service and uses very lit e
current. It may be supplied either air or water “oled-we
strongly recommend the latter as being much more efficient.
“ISKO” is safe, silent and fool-proof-uses no ammonia
nor other dangerous substance—is extremely simple, having
only two moving parts.
“ISKO” is manufactured in various sizes for household,
hospital, confectioners, hotel, club or butchers use.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
Viscount Dunwiek, R.N., has forsaken a
life on the ocean wave to be assistant-secre-
tary to his father, Lord Stradbroke, for the
remainder of the State Governor's term here.
There was a family reunion last week when
he arrived from China. Already, though the
Stradbrokes don’t depart until the first week
in April, farewells are being said. His Excel-
lency, his Countess and their son mean to go
back to England by way of America, where
they propose doing much motoring. Lady
Helena Rous is booked to leave for a visit to
Cairo in February.
A full house tit the Auditorium uprose at
the conclusion of an advanced students’ pro-
gramme to sing “Gor Save” for the last time
under the baton of Professor Laver as Or-
mond Professor of Music. Two maidens,
white-frocked, handed up ribbon-decked laurel
wreaths, and the popular director, whose
teaching-period at the Uni. Con. covers 31
years, and who still looks far too young and
fit for swan songs, said his thanks for loyal
support from teaching staff and public, and
also to Dr. Sugden, who had prefaced the
evening with a few words upon “the occasion
we celebrate,” so to speak. Bernard Heinze
and J. B. North paid their chief a neat com-
pliment by leading the violins of the orches-
tra, though they conducted the concerti
respectively played by their star pupils, vio-
lists Helen Flam erton and Hazel Guest.
Of well-rendered numbers the offerings of
Elizabeth Lester, a movement of the Cello
Concerto in A Minor (Golterman), which
had tone, technique and soul to recommend
it; Senta’s ballade from “The Flying Dutch-
man, ’ sung by Isis Williams, and the piano-
forte concerti by Marshall Sumner and Mona
Nugent stand out for mention.
The changing years have failed to put one
old-timer out of action meaning Santa
Claus. He still comes in the regulation one-
piece garment of crimson cloth and white
fur, with pointed cap and white ziff. Already
replicas of the kindly old gentleman hold
out cordial hands to the young folk who
with lagging steps are doing the shops. Even
the lassie who steps out of the family limou-
sine has a brightening eye as she sees Father
Christmas, and wonders if she dare accept
the trivial gifts he offers. And she does;
for Christmastide makes just plain, natural
children of all the young.
Looking within a city emporium window
laden with a collection of rare Christmas
gifts, including much tortoiseshell and silver
plate, this Chatterer heard behind her a
masculine voice : “Young woman, those are
not for the workers; only for the parasites.”
Evidently some of the left-over “class-con-
scious” sentiments of the late election were
being aired. And there was nothing about
the speaker to suggest poverty, either.
One of the large wards of the After-care
Home of the District Nursing Association
bears the name of Lady Stradbroke, and a
presentation portrait of the Governor’s
popular wife with her small son Chris-
topher. who died about a year ago, hangs
over the mantelpiece. This rest home cost
over £20,000, and the bill has been receipted ;
but for the furnishing and upkeep the asso-
ciation must look to a generous public, there
being no invested funds to draw upon.
Old Omar’s bones must have rattled joy-
tully when his pagan sentiments fell upon
the listening ears of guests at the P.LC
garden party the other day. The themes of
the Rubaiyat seem quite unsuited to the life
of a kirk-school; but “Why fret about them
it to-day be sweet?” The delightful inter-
lude was a re-performance of the picturesque
arrangement of the Persian poet’s philosophy,
given by Beatrice Tern ah and her dancing
maidens at Mrs. Dyer’s home a few days be-
fore The gathering concluded celebrations
of the jubilee year of the P.L.C. Guests
were heralded by the skirling of pipes, so
Omar didn’t get an entirely free run. The
Old Collegians’ Association hostessed the'
party: its president (Mrs. J. Dyer) had
French embroidery in rose design upon her
mack gown and Mrs. Alec Adeney and
Mrs. J. p. Bainbridge helped her to say “So
pleased you came.”
Albert-street Conservatorium housed a
good audience when Howard Edie staged f<tr
its premiere _ in Australia Rabindranath
lagores Chitra,” on which some beautiful
Oriental robes were hung. Beatrice Touzeau
in the name roje. trailed lilac satin and white
with glistening turban. Crimson and purple
bands prinkedWAlice Mallon’s orchid mauve
sweeping gargqnt, her head swathed in gold
tissue. The other two maidens put their trust
in ivory and dull gold draperies.
Charities which come within the kindly
ministrations of the Lord Mayor’s Hospital
Fund will have a share in the distribution
of £30,000 within the next few days. This
year’s appeal for a Christmas box for philan-
thropic institutions brought in a handsome
£32,000.
Harry Green, who is teaching folk to laugh
in Give and Take,” took his fellow-artists
along one morning last week to entertain the
inmates of the Benevolent Asylum, tenor
Walter Kirby adding his notes ‘to the pro-
gramme. The entertainers were lunched by
Dr. and Mrs. Berlitz.
The Musical Society offered a programme
at the Assembly Hall the other evening as
a preliminary to the annual meeting. The
British Music Society's quartette, led by
Alberto Zelman. gave some Beethoven, and
Maud Cromb, Emily Stevenson, violinist
Gertrude Carruthers and basso Alexander
Raff were acceptable soloists; but it was
pianist Katie Fiddle who presented the star
offering in a fine performance of the Schu-
mann “Carnival.”
Violinist J. B. North, of the teaching staff
of the University Con., who has also waved
the baton over the Uni.’s Symphony Orches-
tra, has severed his connection with both,
and will do private work. At the final
rehearsal for the students’ annual concert
he collected some silverware, along with
eulogies from Professor Laver, Weston Pett
and Bernard Heinze.
The learned J. G. Latham, whom the gos-
sips have already made Attorney-General
in a slightly reconstructed Federal Ministry,
spent part of Saturday afternoon opening a
floral fete organised by Mrs. ,T. J. Buchan
in the grounds of Finliaven, which overlook
a charming stretch of the Yarra at Studley
Park. The takings went toward the Streets
and Lanes section of the C.E. Diocesan Mis-
sion, whose interests include the House of
Mercy at Cheltenham, St. George's Interme-
diate Hospital and general streets and prison
work. Sister Esther, who has -boon in
charge for the past 35 years, is at present
enjoying a well-earned holiday in Colombo,
but is expected back early in the New Year.
Mrs. Buchan had the help of General
Chauvel’s lady as president and of Flo Shaw
and Jessie Bage as lion, secretaries ; and W.
•T. Roberts looked after the treasury. Flower-
decked stalls were scattered around the lawn,
and fairies and elves tripped in a mystic
garden where there were lucky blossoms
guarded by Mrs. Ronald Buchan and Miss
Smale. A tennis tournament, demonstrations
of putting by golf authorities, and jazzing
helped to gather in coins. In the evening a
smart dance with accessories in illuminated
grounds helped to fatten the proceeds.
Lafayette’s camera presents graceful and
good-looking Pauline Curran, of the Apple
Isle, who in
January Avill
in arry her
Russian fiance,
Prince Maxi-
milian Melik-
off, according
to the rites of
his church.
Ta s man ia,
wh ic h has
long known
the Curran
family, chiefly
through the
late head of
the house-
hold's interest
in Tatt.'s con-
sultations, is
already work-
ing up a thrill
over the titled
foreigner.
There was a
time when his family owned large estates.
Bat these have gone, apparently; and an
expedition to Moscow to recover them
wouldn’t he likely to do much good.
Though Mrs. W. A. Burton, professionally
Minnie C. Bull, introduced a surprise packet
of singers the other day in the Cecilia
Choir (ladies’), the students presented at
her end-of-the-year concert on Saturday night
were all pianists, arrived or aspiring. It
Was a relief when the white-frocked choris-
ters appeared once again and gave the five
songs from Tennyson’s “Princess,” arranged
melodically by the modern Gustav Holst, and
followed that group with the same com-
poser's elaborately harmonised “Ave Maria”
and the clever conductor's own choral work,
"Morning.” All were unaccompanied ; never-
theless the singers dead-heated tunefully.
From the batch of pupils who fingered the
keyboard the efforts of two stood out as
promising—Jean Blatclily, whose offering
wms the Allegro of the Beethoven C Minor
Conceito; <ind Olcidys Godfrey, who showed
some brilliant technique in the “Hungarian
Fantasie” of Liszt. Teacher gathered in a
garden of flowers.
The first contingent of Little Brothers
who came from overseas last Friday had
evidently been well instructed about our
blacks, rabbits and kangaroos. A St. Kilda
hostess who gave some of the lads cheer was
a bit nonplussed when one of her visitors
solicitously inquired if she had much trouble
keeping them out of her garden.
To give Christmas cheer to those who come
within the Melbourne City Mission’s wide
arms, the superintendent and secretary A.
W. Bean ask kind-hearted old General
Public to do a little special scattering of the
seeds of kindness. The Mission wants gro-
ceries, clothing and toys, and will welcome
them at 235 Exhibition-street this week. It
is now in its 71st year of usefulness, is
entirely unsectarian, and the staff has per-
sonal knowledge of all cases relieved.
There was some elegant finery at the wed-
ding last week of Alison Mary Austin, only
daughter of the late A. J. Austin and Mrs.
Austin, of Murgha station, up Deniliquin
way, and Kenneth Garnet Mackinnon, whose
father owns Daribong, at Dandaloo. The
leading lady was a symphony in pale-gold
satin and lace, tulle and Christmas lilies.
Dolly Parbury, Joan McArthur and the
bride’s cousins Peggy and Joan Austin were
charming supports in clouds of hydrangea-
blue georgette with gleams of silver, their
coiffures banded with foliage and yellow
roses. Mrs. Austin, in black lace and dull
silver tissue, held the after-ceremonies at
No. 9 Darling-street.

He once raised his attractive voice as a
chorister in St. Paul’s Choir; he is an ex-
student of Scotch College, and gained his
musical knowledge at the University Con.
under A. Homewood.
Passed over the hill on December 6, Mrs.
H. C. A. Harrison, of Kew, who was a
daughter of Horatio Spencer Wills, of Lex-
ington station, one of Victoria’s first settlers.
Always a splendid philanthropist, she set the
younger generation a fine example in her
Red Cross work during the Great War,
though she had already passed her seventieth
milestone.
Tenor Gregor Wood and his handsome wife,
whose notes are contralto, were passengers
by the Moldavia that left last week. The
singers, who have put up some records here
in oratorio appearances with the Philhar-
monic, expect to have six months’ seeing and
hearing in Britain and the Continent.
Mrs. Leon Jona, wearing a black gown with
relief in ecru lace and millinery in magpie
tones, provided much tea and cake prior to
an excellent musical menu at the Austral
Salon. Her guests crowded even to the
corridors, and the afternoon was pronounced
one of the nicest. Glad welcome was extended
to Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson, of Adelaide, a
former active member of the salon. She wore
blue splashed with pink blossoms, and sang
as attractively aS ever. Kathleen Roehfort
and Jessie Shmith were two other singers
who were easy to listen to; and Madge Koz-
minsky, who topped a cream satin frock with
a black hat. was successful in songs at the
keyboard. Something with a touch of the
brogue was contributed by Mrs. Frank Ap-
perly—three of Moira O’Neill’s poems. The
guest-list was very imposing.
After 12 months’ absence from these parts
Mrs. A. E. V. Richardson, whose home is
now in Adelaide, is here to say au revoir
again, for her trunks are packed for an
extensive tour with her professorial hus-
band, Dr. Richardson. S’Africa, the British
Isles and the continent of Europe, with re-
turn by way of “the East,” is the mapped-out
journey. The doctor is due at the Science
Congress in Japan during the year. Mr. and
Mrs. Arthur Woolcott lunched many folk
at the Lyceum Club on the 9th in honor of
the visitor.
Moonee Valley Racing Club’s secretary A.
V. Hiskens, Mrs. Hiskens and their daughter
Lorna wander home from Colombo this week,
and intend spending the Christmas season at
Mornington with Miss Cox.
Christmas visitors from other States will
get a better first impression of the Dusty City
this year, as Railway Commissioner Clapp
expects to have his new country platform
ready for the holiday traffic. The platform,
which will be 5(00 feet long and roofed over,
sprawls between the suburban platforms and
Spencer-street. A luggage subway and a
country line booking-office, with six windows
and a luggage-room, are included in the
plans.
The Stuart Bruntons and their son and
daughter make a nice little party for a long
world’s-jaunt by way of America in January.
Mr. Brunton has sold his home and its sur-
rounding acres at Ascot Vale.
There is bad news from across the Strait
that Ruby Lipscombe Taylor (“Ar.elti”),
of Hobart News’ social columns, is seriously
ill in hospital. The trouble may be merely a
temporary breakdown, but her friends, lay
and medical, fear that the clever and con-
scientious little penwoman may be out of
the business for a long time.
Paris sends the latest in feminine golf
apparel. It is an oiled-silk, double-breasted
short coat for cloudy weather, and such a
lightweight that it doesn't hamper the stroke.
With similar millinery and skirt of water-
proof material, rain won’t matter much to
the fair putt-er.
From an Australian in London:—
The remaining furniture of Melba’s house in Mans-
fleld-street was sold by auction a few days ago, and
as many people wished to possess some belongings of
the great singer, high prices were offered by private
bidders. A mahogany sideboard of the Adam period,
with six legs and a gilt frieze, brought 360 guineas,
and a side-table to correspond went to 200 guineas.
Two Adam wine-coolers in carved wood, with gilt
decorations and mask mounts in metal, were sold
for 185 guineas. Four old English dining-tables
fetched the same figure, and four panel oil-paintings
which have been inset in the walls of earlier homes
of the singer brought £360. Melba has very good
taste in matters of decorative art, but this quartette
of pictures was not one of her happi&st selections.
Artists F. R. Thompson and V. M. Grif-
fin, who are holding a combined show at the
Athenaeum, are both graduates of the
National Gallery Art School. The first
lately concluded his course of study by
painting bis scholarship picture, judgment
of which does not thke place until the New
Year. He intends to go in chiefly for por-
traiture and figure-work. His fellow-exhibi-
tor, wlio is an ex-student of Scots’ College,
leans towards decorative landscape.
Rosa Pinkerton, who took her pleasing
soprano notes to London early this year for
further polishing, sends greetings to her
friends here. Thanks to the interest of Lady
Stradbroke, who furnished her with intro-
ductions, the Aussie singer has made some
very influential friends. Ada Crossley,
Alymer Buess't and Evelyn Seotney arc
among those of her own land who extended

Our burned and blistered Town Hall is to
be rebuilt at a cost of £126,500 by Massey
and Sons, and if the acoustic properties of
the concert hall come up to promise visiting
songsters and musicians will have nothing
to blame. Tenders for the pipes of an organ
at least as big as the old one, and superior
in quality, will be called in both England
and Australia; but the job of making the
casing will certainly stay here.
A philanthropic movement that had its
genesis in Perth during the war has come
to Melbourne, which will shortly be asked
to choose its Ugliest Man. Warwick Arm-
strong, Norman Brookes, “Slogan” Clapp,
Ben Cliaffey, John Monash and W. A. Watt
are amongst the competitors for whom votes
will be asked. The winner will get a silver
cup, and the hospital appeal hopes to get
£lO,OOO out of the stunt. Perth’s ugly men,
who still keep up tlieir patriotic and charit-
able activities, are frequently citizens of quite
average good looks, and sonie are even hand-
some. Hence the indignation of an old lady
who had always harbored the idea that the
passport was an adamantine cliiv, when a
platform-speaker for the movement disclosed
a visage of almost bewildering charm. “The
conceited popinjay,” she murmured to her
neighbor, “he’s gone and done himself up!”
Mrs. R. G. Baldock. whose Queensland
station home, Ellangowan, is among the
most enticing on the Darling Downs, gave
luncheon and Christmas cheer at Menzies’ to
a merry party of southern friends during
the week. Among those who sat around the
delphiniums and pink carnations were Mrs.
Murray Morton and daughter Ula, Mrs. de
Bavay, Mrs. Fred Ivrcrouse and Mrs. Horace
Wimpole.
A line from Hobart -
The Royal Yacht Club lost one of its best-
liked members when popular Dick Whittington was
drowned in the Derwent through the upsetting of his
craft during a recent gale; although his whole life
might be said to have been spent on the water, he
could not swim. He was a crack rifleshot, too, and
a fine all-round sportsman, as well as a good fellow,
Hobart’s musicians turned up in a throng at the
Imperial to farewell Frank McCann and wish him
good luck in Sydney. For generations past the
McCanns, father and sons, have made their perch on
the top branches of the musical tree in Hobart,

NOTIONS
McShortodds had cold feet at Canterbury
Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday, and his prices were no
better in two cases, and very little better in others,
than those returned by a tote which declared three
dividends after about 13i p.c. had been deducted
for the Government and the club. Pteropod won
the first division of the Flying Handicap at 5 to 4
on (the tote paid 17s. 6d. for 10s.) ; Dabble (5 to
4 on) took the first division and Kelgoola (evens
and 5 to 4 on) the second division of the Juvenile
Handicap (the tote paid 16s. and 18s. respectively) ;
and White and Black (evens with some bookmakers)
o-ot away with the second division of the Highweight
Handicap (tote div., £1 Os. 6d.). If the Lang Gov-
ernment wants to do something really useful lor
the N.S.W'. punter, it will insist on the installation
of straightout 10s. and 6s. totes. Kelgoola finished
gamely in his race after getting an unfavorable stait,
and though he may never be as good as brother
Easingwold, he is obviously going to be useful.
The lathy Freddie C. (9 to 2) beat Royal Roue,
Luddenham and six others handily in the 10 furlongs
Canterbury Handicap, which carried sweep money
as well as a £250 stake, and has since been
discussed in connection with the Christmas handicaps
. he has 7st. 71b. in the Summer Cup and 21b.
more in Tatt.’s Club Cup. The Dancer (7 to 2)
who runs well at Canterbury and nowhere else,
downed Valais Queen and Soorak in the second
division of the Flying Handicap, in which the
burly-looking Soorak showed a flash of his three-year-
old form; and Dunmoogin (12’s), an aged mare
by Charlemagne II. —Grafton Lassie, accounted for
Waracre and Pigeondor in the first division of the
Highweight after a spirited tussle. Her party put
£25 on the machine as soon as the windows opened,
but the public did not follow the lead. Lastly,
Kiga (20’s), who was thought to be unready, out-
staved the hot favorite L.A. and Avrom in the
Welter. Like Dunmoogin, he was ridden by Munro.
* * * *
The Yilliers Stakes is generally a trap
for backers, and Saturday’s race at Randwick looks
desperately hard to pick. Hemisphere (Bst.) is the
popular fancy at the moment, but Sir Alick (sst.
51b.), Roval Dighton (Bst.), Valdoona (Bst.), Irish
Prince (Bst.), Meenah (7st. 131 b.), King Cyllene (7st.
101 b.), Beauford’s brother Anambah (7st. 71b.), Quan
Tart (7st. 51b.), Valicare (7st. 21b.), Lucy Thrice
(6st. 91b.) and Pigeon Pie (6st. 91b.) have plenty of
admirers, whose confidence is based on recent form
with the colors un, or good track gallops, or both.
Perhaps Pigeon Pie is the most attractive proposi-
tion, for he is a well-bred and lightly-weighted four-
year-old who has done really well in his last three
races and should relish the Randwick straight.
Four-year-olds have won a power of races this season.
Failing Pigeon Pie, Hemisphere may do it, and
tote backers of Valdoona will possibly earn decent
interest on their money. Player (7st. 61b.) is
nicely treated in the Holiday Handicap, 10 furlongs
w hich has a 7st. minimum, and The White Diamond
(Bst.) is a Highweight Handicap possibility.
Lady Stradbroke hasn’t had much luck
with Trice, but, jumping out smartly, the mare
scored easilv in the Open Handicap, six furlongs, at
Epsom (Vic.), Lydia Nance and Lady Yarrien being
the nearest of her pursuers. Jack Holt, who has
had a thin time of late, trains Trice, who was
favorite at 3’s, and Duncan was on top. The
Mentone Handicap was won by the consistent Lady
Warwick (first choice at 3’s), with the jumpers’ flat
horse Woolpack second and Warwickshire third. The
Kenilworth mare carried Bst. 21b., but the time,
2min. 81 sec., was very ordinary. That good horse
Englefleld, top weight with 9st. 61b. had backing,
but looked far too chubby to do himself justice.
He ran a fair race, however, and is sure to be
dangerous in one of the holiday handicaps. Robes-
pierre (7 to 4), a Sol Green importation, was suc-
cessful in the Trial Plate, and while there was nothing
impressive in his half-length victory over Red Page
and Oriental Gem, such a well-bred horse (he is by
Phalaris —Austral) is likely to do much more notable
things. A 33-to-l shot in Rex Tertius (Thrice—
Regal Queen) just downed a hot favorite (Cross
Word) in the Two-year-old Handicap, with a rather
good sort in Cattaro, by Cetigne— Syiphlike in third
place. The winner, who was having his first run, is
one of E. M. Pearce’s team, and is traihed by A.
Mortimer.

“Hasen” • The names of two horses in
a recent Kedron Park (Q.) programme stood out as
mute testimony to the uncertainty of „ th q bu o sl "f*®
of buying racehorses. One was Our Home, a ful
brother to the useful All Home, who . ran secondi in
Blackadder’s Epsom; the other was _ Pipul, wh
appeared in the same auction-list as Windbag, and
was then considered something like £4OO.. the better
bargain Our Home and Pipul are handicapped on
the minimum and a pound above the minimum re-
spectively in the 4th Division (the lowest) at Kedron
The distance between a Melbourne Cup winner and
an also-ran in the lowest flight of "the ponies is

“Shrewsbury” : The list of winning owners
for the just-concluded English flat-racing season has
a cosmopolitan appearance. Pride of place goes-to
Viscount Astor, son of an American millionaire who
earned the curses of his countrymen by changing his
nationality. Solly Joel, the Whitechapel Jewbcy
w'ho rose to social eminence on vnngs of Johannes
burg share certificates, is second; the Aga Khan,
head of Indian Islam and a living saint m the ejes
of millions is third ; and the China Coast merchant,
Morris, is fourth. The head of the historic house of
Stanley, Earls of Derby and Kings of Man, is an
also-ran. * #
“11. P.” : The committee of the Coleraine
/•Vic ) Racing Club cannot have much poetic senti-
ment in its make-up. It has reported against the
continuance of the Great Western Steeplechase
•which was revived at Coleraine after many years
absence from the winter programme This was the
race in which Adam Lindsay Gordon rode in the
’sixties, and of which he wrote: —
“On the fields of Coleraine there’ll be labor in vain
Before the Great Western is ended;
The nags will have toil’d and silks Will be soiled,
And the rails will require io be mended.
If for that verse alone the race should be worth
keeping up. # , *
“Ascot”: Recent Bulletin discussions on
the tote have not
mentioned one safe-
guard for punters in
use in Maoriland,
France and elsewhere;
that is, the practice
of bracketing the
horses running in the
nomination of one
owner. An owner
may start two, three
or more horses in a
race, but for tote pur-
poses they are re-
garded as one entry.
If any of the team
wins, backers collect.
This saves punters the
worry of wondering
which is the stable
“elect.” It sometimes
happens, too, that the
owner himself is sur-
prised when the out-
sider of his string
boats the favorites.

The betting Was 2 to 1 on Harry Collins
ClOst 1141 b ) when that champion middleweight met
Geo ge Eagel (10st. 3*lb.) at the Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night, but those who backed the Aus-
nlentv of anxious moments before they
collected. The Californian appears to have definitely

Those apparently killing left-swings found the jaw

tv,™ and yet by the aid of his abnormal
neck muscles he survived, and actually drove two
no vrl riehts ’to the body before closing-time. The
excitement S was intense,' and continued throughout
the second during which Collins was all but out,
lint still refused to .go down. He was half-awake

body-punch! and managed to back-move one .swing

ropes, while Bagel staggered backwards and
fell. As referee Wallis commenced to count, the
American, perfectly cool and undistressed —-his con-
dition was superb—shook his head, pointed to his
left ankle and informed the official that it was hurt so
badly that he could not continue. Hundreds did not
believe him, and hooted fiercely, while there were
wild cheers for Collins. A Newcastle lad fought
in each of the five four-round preliminaries, and
three of them were successful. Takings were £2452,
of which Collins and Eagel drew £613 apiece.
“Jobber” : Dave Smith, nominated by "S.
Guinm’’ (13. 10/12/’25) as the first cx-bruiser to
enter public life in N. S. Wales, is just three yeais
behind “Ranji” Burns, who was elected to the
Katoomba Council in 1922. Through a political
move “Ranji” was put in the mayoral chair in
1924.' His regime will live for ever m the histoiy
of the town. » * *
The spectators at the Melbourne Stadium
on Saturday witnessed a crude and one-sided slogging
match between negro “Tiger” Payne and Max Gor-
nick Gornick was badly knocked about in the
second round, and the affair might have been
stopped there and then, but it dragged on until
the ninth, when the referee said Gornick had had
sufficient. Max is a plucky fellow but he has
taken more hidings than are good foi him. hi
would be well advised to game.
“Oxmead”: Notice that a baronet (one
Lane-Devitt), a Cambridge three-quarter back, is
tipped for his international Rugby cap this year.
It is a reminder that persons with titles are vei>
rare' birds on the football field. English cricket, cn
course, has had Lord Harris, Lord Hawke, Lord
Darnlev (sometime Ivo Bligh), the Lytteltons, Sn
Timothv O’Brien, the Hon. F. S. Jackson and a few
other plavers with more or less storied names ; but
considering its opportunities Britain’s old nobility
and sub-nobility lias not figured very strikingly even
at the less strenuous game. A sprig of royalty w»o
could clout sixes and skittle stumps might get
nearer the great heart of the people than by pro-
ficiency at polo, or falls in the hunting-field oi
straight-shooting at grouse and pheasants. Bu-
the reigning house doesn’t appear to have produced
even a mediocre performer at the national game
since the Georgian prince who came to his death
at the sport. Edward VII., when ouite a young
man, was induced to play in a regimental match
at Windsor. A loval guardsman gave him a lull
toss to leg for an opener, but the Prince stepped
back and inconsiderately tipped it on to his wicket.
Also he missed several catches and flatly refused, it
was said, ever to take the field again, Nor have any
of his descendants, it would seem, been drawn
towards the games that command the widest popu-
larity, save as spectators.
* * * *
Grimmett’s bowling and the batting of
Collins and Gregory were the features which dis-
tinguished the closing day of the match at Sydney
between Australia and The Rest. At one stage the
slow bowler had 3 for 10, his victims being Andrews
(2), Kippax (0) and Woodfull (42) ; he finished with
5 for 91. He has been wonderfully successful on
Sydney wickets. Collins’s cool courage was shown
in both his performances—lo 2 out of 226 in the first
innings and 81 out of 296 in the second. With Jack
Gregory (100) he put on 138 for the seventh wicket,
and neither man has ever batted better. Love made
54 in The Rest’s second innings, and his work behind
the wickets was quite as good as Oldfield’s. The
fielding, on the whole, was below the international
standard, but Rvmill, Woodfull and Vic Richardson
gave very good exhibitions indeed. All three should
be taken to England, even if it means booking 18
passages, for they can do things in the field which
are quite impossible to men who have grown old
and stiff in the joints. Nor should Kippax’s claims
be dismissed because of one failure; this bright
voung batsman would probably do well on English
wickets, and he is a better outfield than Bardsley.
The Rest won by 156 runs.

part of it) is to be picked on Dec. 30, and the
indications are that it will consist of' Collins,
Gregory, Macartney, Kelleway, Taylor, Oldfield,
Bardsley, Andrews, Mailev (N.S.W.), Ryder, Pons-
ford, Hendry, Love (Vic.), Arthur Richardson and
Grimmett (S. Aus.). It is a combination strong in
batting, not so strong in bowling, and not at all
strong in fielding if you take away Gregory, T '\vlor
and the wicket-keeper. And for an Englisl "-ur
which is expected to be the most arduous i. the
history of the game, it is distinctly too old. Pons-
ford is the youngest member of the band, and he
was 25 on Oct. 19. Oldfield is rising 29; Gregory,
Taylor and Hendry are 30 (all these men, of course,
are in their prime) ; Grimmett is just on o 4 ,
Andrews is 35; Collins will be 37 next month,
Kelleway in April and Ryder in August; Mailey is
within a, few weeks of 38; Macartney has turned
39 and Bardsley is 41. I haven’t Arthur Richardson s
age, but if he isn’t in the late thirties his appear-
ance belies him. In the famous touring teams of
the past there was a much greater infusion of youth.
Spofforth, for instance, was one of the veterans oi
the 1882 side, yet only completed his 29th year as
the tour was ending. Murdoch, the captain, was
between 26 and 27 ; Massie, Bonnor, Horan and Black-
ham were 27; Giffen and Alick Bannerman were
23, Percy McDonnell 22, and Sammy Jones 21. Ana
the splendid 1902 side, which beat perhaps the finest
eleven England has ever put into the field, was very
much younger than our 1925 lot; its batting heroes
were Trumper (25), Noble (29), Clem Hill (25),
R. A. Duff (24) and Armstrong (23), while the
bowling was mostly done by Trumble (35), Saunders
(26), Armstrong, Hopkins (26), Howell (32), Noble
and Jones (33). If all the old stagers are taken
there will be a tragic number of cripples limping
about the green fields of England towards the end
of the summer. For Heaven’s sake let a few of them
be dropped in favor of brisk young fellows like
Rymill, YVoodfull, liippax and Vic Richardson, who
are always on their toes when fielding and are not
at all likely to break down.
“E.W.” : The refusal to admit Queensland
to the Sheffield Shield competition has become a
bad joke. In the Northerners’ last 11 matches with
N.S.W., each State has had two wins, and the drawn
games were mostly in Queensland’s favor. Admittedly
the N.S.W. team was in no case the selectors’ first
choice, but there is not such a wide margin between
the first and second elevens. In the latent match at
Brisbane, the Bananalanders got 506 for 9 wickets,
which beat N.S.W.’s record of 506 for 10 wickets
at Sydney in 1921. On top of this effort the
Queenslanders downed M.L. by an innings and 9i
runs, wicket-keeper O’Connor scoring 103 and R.
Higgins (a colt) 80, while Noyes took 2 for 62
and 6 for 48. In the last two seasons O’Connor has
been wonderfully consistent with the willow, and he
has caught and stumped many good batsmen, besides
keeping sundries down. He is at least equal to Ellis
as a wicketkeeper and to Love as a bat, but his
chances of inclusion in the Australian XV are
small. I don’t think the selectors have ever seen
him in action. They never visit Brisbane, and are
always absent when he makes the trip to
Sydney.
* * * *
Goulburn (N.S.W.) will not soon forgot
the visit of the M.L. XI. For the tourists R. C.
Blunt hit up 216 (out of 515), and took 6 wickets
for 25 and 6 for 72. Worker and Lowry contributed
88 apiece to the M.L. score, which would have been
still more bulky but for the fine wicketkeeping of
Walker. M.L. won by an innings and 156 runs.
“Gobble”: In picking the team to meet the
Maorilariders the Vic. selectors have again shown
their -talent for the unexpected. They have certainly
chosen four promising colts —Cosgrave, Mitchell and
the two young expresses, Gamble and Ebeling—and
placed the seal of approval on Stan Wooten an
excellent wicketkeeper. But the rest make one think
that the future of Victorian cricket is in the past.
Mayne (42), Tarrant (44) and Liddicutt are the
onlv regulars; but F. Baring, whose cricket before
1914 gained him a place in the Australian XI that
didn’t go to England, Ransford (41) and the retired
Hartkopf have been dug up. Wilkinson, a left-
hander who can bat and bowl, is 12th man, and
should be playing, but so, too, should Rayson,
Millar and Schneider, who have been flattered by a
game or two in the past. The selectors still seem
to believe that the best friends are the old friends
—and the older the better.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: They were arranging
a cricket match between the married and single
members of the local social club, and Tom, whose
prowess as a player had been enthusiastically praised
bv Mrs. Tom, called to see the secretary, who had
the affair in hand. “Count me out of it,” he said,
“I don’t know the first thing about cricket. Gh
hang it, Tom!” the sec. expostulated. “Your wife
told us you represented your battalion during the
war” “What did she say exactly?” asked her
lord. “She said you told her your colonel con-
sidered you the best batsman in the battalion. Tom
let loose a burst of merriment. “Good Lord! 1
said batman , not batsman,” he explained.
. * * *
An unusual bit of cricket strategy was
shown in Sydney last week by the Melbourne Uni
skipper, who closed his innings after his team had
lost 6 wickets for 38 in response to Sydney Uni. s
218. He wanted to put his opponents in again on
a sticky wicket. Six Svdney men were dismissed
for 100; but the tail wagged so strongly that 335
was the total, and Melbourne was left the impossible
task of making 516 runs to win. It amassed only
79 Jim Garner taking 8 wickets for 9 runs. Which
shows what a capable left-hander can do on a wicket
that suits him.
* * * *
In a Parliament v. Press cricket match at
Hobart on December 10 the first-named team included
two ex-internationals, Joe Darling and Charlie Eadj.
\s both veterans are still fairly formidable at the
game Darling especially so, the pressmen hadn t
a chance Parliament declared at six for 200, and
outed the press gang for 102. Premier Lyons skip-
pered the legislators; A. J. A. secretary Ronald
Brooks the scribes. I.yons did not bat, but skittled
several wickets; the other captain achieved a not
ignoble end with the line “Brooks, c Eady, b
Darling, 9.”
The first record of any importance to be
made on the Maroubra (N.S.W.) speedway goes to
Don Hark ness and Phil Harbutt, who, driving an
Overland, fitted with Australian tyres, covered 1236
miles 122 yards in 24 hours. It is an Australian
record for "a car of any power,' but the average
spee( l_- 5H m.p.h.—is not high in comparison with
Northern ' Hemisphere performances in the same
class, and there is plenty of scope for future
aspirants.

“Uallacher, the Scottish international whom
Newcastle United acquired for the record fee ot
£lO 000, made a brilliant debut against Merton,
scoring two goals. The previous highest transfer
fee paid was £6500.”- — Cable.
Ten thousand pounds he brought. A powerful
Dollop of evil’s root, you’ll say with me.
It beats the price of many a shorthorn bull
Or stately ram of shining pedigree.
’Twould be a decent figure for a gee
Below Heroic’s class. And it astounds
A homo sapiens (even Scotch) to see
In open market fetch ten thousand pounds.
Did lynx-eyed vets, his whole anatomy
Test with unceasing vigilance and grim
Persistency before they d guarantee
The human purchase sound in wind and limb.
Aye, you may bet they took no chance with him,
The star performer for their crowded grounds;
They’re canny folk at Newcastle and slim;
Be sure they’d never waste ten thousand pounds.
Sport or commercialism? Well, you know
There’s many an undisputed turf grandee
Who’s won his way into the limelight’s glow
By buying horseflesh less sagaciously.
Cannot a club be similarly free,
Presuming that the wherewithal abounds?
Even a football pro., ’tis clear, may be
A real bargain at ten thousand pounds.

Happy Christmas Gifts
“TV/TY ‘Swan’ Pen is a perfect joy” is
1 said or thought over and over by
millions of users throughout the world.
This quality of giving joy, of giving
satisfaction, has made “Swan” Pens famous.
It has established the fashion, custom
or habit of carrying one’s fountain pen in
pocket or handbag as a matter of course,
just as one carries a watch. In some
countries, India for example, a fountain pen
displayed in the pocket is regarded as
evidence of education and modernity.
But all fountain pens are not as good as
“ Swans.” Apart from its quality and per-
fect working, the “Swan” is distinguished
for its strength, fine lines and balance in
the hand —there is no cramp or fatigue in
use. As a writing implement, it is a thing
of beauty, and its many and varied forms
of ornamentation meet every aesthetic taste.
At this moment there are many
“Swan” Pens in regular service which are
over thirty years old —and in case of accident
a new nib is immediately obtainable;
an allowance being made for the old one.
Let “Swan” Pens be your joy giving
presents.

THE INKY WAY.
‘Cue” : M.L.’s retiring C. J., Stout, once had a brother
in Australia, whose lines were cast in very different
places. He roamed the Inky Way in Westralia some-
thing over 40 years ago—l have an idea he was
once editor of the Geraldton Express in the bond-or-
free days of Groperland—and he left the name of a
vigorous if somewhat erratic personality behind him.
He died in the ’eighties.
“Topee” : The late John Norton always claimed
to hove invented the term “wowser,” lately pro-
moted into the Vic. public-school press vernacular
(14. 19/11/’2f>). All he did was to import it from
England, and he must have known that he was
skating on very thin ice when employing it. In the
English Midlands it is a mere colloquial obscenity.
The use of the word in the streets of, say, Birming-
ham or Leeds would earn the speaker £5 or three
months.
“Clerk”: Henry Pottage, a well-known Vic. rail-
way engine-driver (his home is at Coleraine) and
the writer of countless Bulletin pars, in the last
30-odd years, will this month, all going well, spend
his 38th Christmas on a loco. He has been engine-
cleaner, fireman and driver for close on two-score
years, and has never once had a holiday off the
footplate at Christmas-time. Even the Government
service has its drawbacks.
“M.H.H.”: Great is the number of gratis papers
now published in Sydney. Every suburb sports one
and some have two, their columns filled with ads.,
reports of council meetings and suburban parties. The
infection passes to business houses, and various city
shops publish flimsy rags with a few jokes and
the latest price-lists. Now one city publican dis-
tributes a paper consisting mostly of racing gossip
and tips, to he imbibed with the beer.
Tom Gilchrist, Clerk Assistant of Vic. Assembly,
who is likely to succeed Pearson as Clerk Assistant
of the Uppah Chambah at the end of December, as
a stepping-stone to the Clerk’s chair later on, left
the Argus 33 years ago to become assistant sec. of
the Railway Committee, and has since vacillated
between the civil service and the Inky Way. W.
V. Robinson, third clerk of the Vie. Assembly (1891-
1902), was, like Gilchrist, a reporter before becoming
a Parliamentary official.
Lyons, who beat McCombs (Labor) for the Lyttel-
ton (M.L.) seat by four votes on a magisterial re-
count, is a well-known Christchurch pressman, agri-
cultural editor of the Sun, and an earnest believer in
the national value of lucerne and the necessity for
butchering robber-cows and all that sort of thing.
Universally known as “Tiny,” because of his 76 inches
of height and proportionate circumference, no A. and
P. show in his province is complete without him.
He is President of the Canterbury Branch of the
N.Z.J.A.
The sudden death in Geelong (Vic.) of William
Thacker was a shock to fellow-printers who had
met him a few days before at the Provincial
Press Association conference in Melbourne. His dad,
Henry, established a printing business at the Pivot
in ’59, and William succeeded to it after a grounding
at Geelong Grammar School. He had travelled a
good deal, and found room for the exercise of
philanthropic and public service on the committee of
management of two charitable institutions and the
Chamber of Commerce.
With the passing of George H-awksley at 50
Sydney journalism loses a prominent figure. Since
1889 he had been on the Evening News except for
a short stay on a Newcastle sheet. At the time ot
his death he was in charge of the shipping depart-
ment, and no one knew the Sydney waterfront better.
Cadets and junior reporters owe him much for the
conditions they work under nowadays His spare
time was filled as president of the N.S.W. branch
of the vice-president of the Institute ot
Journalists and an alderman of the Waverley Council.
“Coot”: Melbourne’s new morning daily has as its
motto: _
“Here shall the Post
The country’s right maintain,
the word “country” presumably standing in this in-
stance for anything that isn’t city or town. lh.
Argus is the only other Melbourne daily which in-
dulges in the luxury of a motto. Its phrase from
John Knox, “I am in the P where 1 am de-
manded,” etc., was first of all the slogan of the Port
Phillip Patriot ; it was annexed by the Argus when
the PATRIOT passed out in 1851 Melbourne Herald
h a d a motto once—“lmpartial, not neutral but
mislaid it somewhere in the years that have gon ..
It dated from the time when the paper was the
Tort Phillip Herald.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Like myself, the Geelon„
Advertiser is 85 not out. Its first issue was on
November 22, 1840 (I arrived on May 9). James
Bonwick’s “Early Struggles of the Australian Press
SlS“hatTo copy 'o?the M-jWk
in London libraries. It w-as edited by Jame,
Harrison and printed and published for John Pascoe
Fawkner (sole proprietor) by William Walki
Corio, Australia Felix.” In the first ’snrties I knew
James Harrison, sometime an M.L A., as the di.
coverer of a method of making artificial ice. i
lived then in Franklyn-street; the ice factory was
in an Ron shed next'door. Harrison’s ice was not
made in blocks, but in bars, resembhng pig-iron
The venture did not take on, and he lost what
little fortune he had.
“0.H.”: C. R. Long, who has been editor ot the
Vic. School Paper for 30 years, retires at the end
of December. It was in 1895 that he induced Pea-
cock, then Minister for Education, to authorise the
publication ; it happened during a train journey from
Ballarat to Melbourne. The idea was borrow-ed fiom
the Children’s Hour Journal issued by Johii A.
Hartlev, permanent head of S.A. Education Depa „
ment. Long has the status of a senior inspector,
and also edits the Education Gazette (a publication
for teachers). In his spare time he has helped to
promote a taste for Australian literature besides being
a force in the Shakspeare Society. He has reared
10 children of his own while helping to guide, say,
a million belonging to other people, and the young-
sters will testify their appreciation for him on the
dav of the break-up (Dec. 18). His School Paper,
bv the way, has a circulation of 230,000, including
20,000 or so that are sent to Tasmania and W.A.
'.J V O’Loglilin, the S. Aus. Senator who died a
day or two after the count for the new men in his
State had been finished, got into Parliament via
a country newspaper office. He started life as a
farm-boy," but was still only 30 when he founded
the Terowie Enterprise, which he edited quite
successfully. His nearest press neighbor in those
davs was Fred Holder, who ran the Burra Record,
and was afterwards Premier of the State and first
Speaker of the House of Representatives. Getting
into the Leg. Council, O’Loghlin found the need
to do something for a living (he had sold the Enter-
prise) , so he promoted the Southern Cross, an R.C.
weekly, was its first editor, and continued to be its
managing director for 35 years. Bill Denny, now
Attornev-General of S.A., succeeded him as editor
when lie left the chair to join Kingston’s Ministry
in 1896. He had the job of making the arrange-
ments for the first meetings of the Federal Con-
vention in Adelaide; he was Chief Secretary at the
time.
“Seebee”: Just dead Lauchlin Maekinnon, formerly
part proprietor of the Argus, though he never
courted popularity, was thoroughly esteemed by
the staff. In 30 years I never heard one member
of the literary staff speak a disparaging word about
him. The late Jack Nish, when chief sub., was imp-
ish enough when giving evidence in a libel case to
say “Oh, signs the cheques,” when asked what the
general manager did, and it was said Maekinnon
was none too pleased. He was immensely pleased,
however, when Bill Letcher, when speaking in the
Arbitration Court on the A. J. A. salaries claim,
mentioned that he would unhesitatingly take a ver-
bal undertaking given by the Argus that it would
carry out any specified thing in relation to pay and
conditions, but would not do so in relation to all
newspapers—lest there should be misunderstandings.
When Mac. heard that a reporter who had rendered
fine service had had his pa.v stopped (after a certain
period) because he was absent owing to a break-
down in health, he stormed properly and had amends
made. Peace to his ashes: they lie in Devonshire.

Marie Narelle opened her Sydney concert
on Saturday night with Needham’s “Exile’s
Return,” and ended it with "The Minstrel
Boy.” In between she sang other songs of
Old Ireland in a charming lightweight
soprano, using the middle voice with subtlety
and distinction. But it is the “young girl”
quality in the voice that is its most potent
charm. This was particularly felt in such
songs a.s “Killaruey” and “My Mother Bids
Me Bind My Hair,” and in the “Joan of
Arc” aria. A crystal clearness of enunciation
marked every number. The singer had for
support Alexander Hmelnitsky, a Russian
pianist whose interpretation of Beethoven
and Chopin was imaginative and full of
Pan-like beauty. The ’cellist, too, Lusi
Estrim, seems to have tuned her ear to real
music rather than staggering effects. Her
style is magnolia-smooth.
“Wildflower,” after an Australasian run
of over a year, will fold its petals at Sydney
Royal to-morrow night. “Katja” blooms

For 20 minutes twice a (lay Sydney Tivoli
has a holiday from sophisticated vaudeville
turns. The refreshing change is provided
by Mantells’ Mannikins, a clever little
marionette show which should draw big
crowds to the matinees during Christmas
time, for it appeals to the love of the fan-
tastic in every child. There is an amusing
little orchestra and an old-time chairman
who announces each new appearance and
comments humorously upon the antics of the
performers. Other attractions different rrom
the hackneyed are the impersonations of
Ella Shields —her “Wide-awake Walter from
Wimbledon Way” is very bright—and the
artistic work of the Flemings in their poses
plastique.

From the grey cruisers in Farm Cove,
Sydney, a stream of sailors is pouring south-
west to the Crystal Palace. The reason for
this unprecedented attack by the silent ser-
vice on the George-street citadel of sheiks
and vamps is the screen version of “The
Storming of Zeebrugge.” The blocking of
the harbors of Zeebrugge and Ostend and the
sealing-up of Hun torpedo craft and sub-
marines that were a continual menace to
English trade and transports in the Channel
is followed step by step in a series of vivid
and gripping scenes. Commencing with
glimpses of picturesque Bruges, explanatory
diagrams and views of preparations at the
home base, the story hastens on to the stir-
ring incidents of that memorable St. George’s
Day in 1918. Destroyers with belching guns
surge through troubled waters, motor-
launches speed hither and thither, ghostly
searchlights penetrate the gloom, obsolete
concrete-laden cruisers are sunk and count-
less heroic deeds are performed. Another
feature are the model ships used to illus-
trate manoeuvres. Considering that the pic-
ture of the attack was filmed six years after
the actual event, it is amazing how convinc-
ing the mock battle appears. The prologue
is extraneous, and no harm would be done if
it was deleted.

At Syduey Fullers’ Gayle Wyer is
utilising the week prior to his evacu-
ation to make a scrutiny of his forces and
the ammunition at his command. The in-
spection, appropriately labelled “A Review
of Revues,” includes the most popular songs
and dance turns from former revues, and is
a striking demonstration of the company’s
preparedness for its expedition amongst un-
tried audiences. The other half of the bill
requires judicious handling if the house is
to capture Christmas trade. There is too
heavy a crop of unoriginal musicians.
** * *
The young man who is “Fighting the
Flames’’ at Sydney Lyceum is not so much
interested in fire-prevention as in saving his
soul from the furnaces down below. A
Chinese magician separates the penitent from
the other half of the programme, which con-
tains “A School for Wives.” “The Lady
Who Lied” is at the back of the trouble at
the Piccadilly, where a triangular battle is
fought on a front ranging from a canal in
Venice to a desert outpost. “Are Parents
People?” is a rather dreary attempt at the
Empress to investigate the relations existing
between husband and wife on the one hand
and parents and children on the other.
Hoyt’s still relies on Rudolph Valentino as
“The Sainted Devil” to rope in customers,
and Rudolph does it; if it was left to the
supporting film, which drags in Abraham
Lincoln by the beard, the firm wouldn’t be
able to afford cheese for the rat-trap. The
Prince Edward has a choir of 25 voices to
beef out “The Marseillaise” and lend atmo-
sphere to “Scaramouche,” a story of the
French Revolution.

Paris de Lare de Cliaumente, the young
French pianist with the untended shingle
and the iiale and pensive face who has just
given four recitals at Melbourne Playhouse,
has the courage of his convictions. On his
initial evening he mixed with Dvorak, Ravel
and Scriabine some less familiar and more
recent practitioners such as Rebikoff, Harold
Vincent, Bassin and Amani. The bewilder-
ment of his hearers at being confronted with
these Dadaists in melody was reflected in
the chill and furtive mutterings of the critics.
When a not very plentiful array of devotees
turned up at his second frenzy they were
presented with a challenge to their civic
patriotism in the form of a note that said :
In view of the modern composers’ works being so
little known in Melbourne, to-night M. de Chau-
niente will play Variations in A Major, Mozart, etc.
A list of uncontroversial titbits suitable for
school break-ups followed, through which
the versatile foreigner clawed his way in un-
exceptionable style. The revelation of a
very fine technique and a budding plaintive
and poetic art made the audience forget the
painful slight that had been put upon it;
and a loud demand for more followed his
final item, a vigorous rendering of “La Cam-
panella” (Liszt). The youth is only 21,
made his first public appearance at Cracow
at 13, and played before the late Czar of all
the Russias —presumably in rompers. He
should mature with time.
Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet,
was presented for the first time in public
in Australia at the Albert-street Conserva-
torium (Melb.) the other evening to an
indulgent audience of Philistinish occiden-
tals. “Chitra” is the mystical story of a
King’s daughter, bred to manly arts, who

falls in love with the warrior-prince Arjuna,
and, in order to wean him from the gross
passion for her body to appreciation of the
superior nourishment provided by her soul,
enlists the magic of the God of Love, who
turns her for a year into a voluptuous beauty.
At the end of the stated period Arjuna,
being satiated with sensual delights, sighs
for another sort of mate, and the lady obliges
him by returning to her former shape. The
argument is far from clear and failed to
illustrate the claim of Howard Edie, the
producer, that the play was a symbol of
humanity’s urge to higher things; the
unmystical Bernard Shaw would have

to the thumping of a drum while a posse.of
dancing-girls makes sensuous explanatory
movements. However, four heroic maidens,
the Misses Mallon, Touzeau, Stach and Arm-
strong. did their best to make drama out ot
the often extremely charming poetry, and
succeeded fairly well. Indeed, Miss Touzeau,
in the name part, succeeded more than lairly
well.

Melbourne’s Philharmonic had record box-
returns from oratorio patrons —a type unto
themselves —for a quite commendable per-
formance of “The Creation” under Alberto
Zelman’s baton at the Auditorium. Choris-
ters keen to make good rather overdid their
well-meaning efforts, missing some of the
gentler side of the new-created world. Ihe
Heavens Are Telling” just missed the honors
which were scored by “Achieved Is the
Glorious Work.” The orchestral accompam-
ment of uneven balance lacked also light and
shade; and the feeble portable-organ support
to the recitatives was a cry of anguish to
the Town Hall authorities to hasten the
arrival of new pipes. Violet Jackson’s clear
soprano notes, intelligently used, soared well
in solo offerings, particularly in “With Ver-
dure Clad”; basso Alexander Raff stood
favorably in a comparison with singers heard
before in the work, and Edwin E. Hooke,
whose tenor voice hasn’t much quality,
showed, at any rate, appreciation of the
text. The most praiseworthy feature of all
was the capital enunciation, in choristers
and soloists alike, so that the book of words
might have been left at home. The Phil,
announces two special performances of ‘The
Messiah” at the Exhibition on the 22nd and
Christmas Night. Clara Butt and Kennerley
Rumford will assist in these, the centenary
and 101st attacks on this work by the society.
“The Street Singer” * will supplant “The
Farmer’s Wife” at the Royal (Melb.) on
Monday next (21st), and on Boxing Day
“The Maid of the Mountains” will begin to
worry the scene-shifters for one week only.
$ * *
Next Saturday night Renee Kelly and
half a dozen others will make their first
appearance in “Polly with a Past” at Mel-
bourne King’s. Good frocking and fun
appear to be the chief ingredients of the
goulash.

Melbourne has discovered that “Give ajj.d
Take,” at the Athenaeum, is a worth-while
comedy, and its approval has moved the
management to extend the season, which is
in its tenth week, for another three.
The Palace Theatre (Melb.) will take the
lid off “The Music-Box Revue” on Boxing
Day.
** * *
“Archie” will dance and dazzle at Mel-
bourne Princess for only three nights more.
On Boxing Day Hugh J. Ward’s contribution
to the city’s Christmas cheer, “Jack and the
Beanstalk,” will recommence the famous
horticultural feat.
** * *
“Aladdin” is to be J.C.W.’s great Boxing
Day sensation at His Majesty’s (Melb.), as
it was at Christmas, 1923. Ada Reeve was
a frabjous “boy” in that production, and
Jennie Benson will be the star in this; and
the imperishable story of the youth who
rubbed a ring and found a Golden Mile has
been entirely retold for the occasion.
** * *
“Sweet Genevieve,” “The Cat Came Back,”
and other ancient melodies with the cachet
of a dead generation’s fond approval hanging
around them, are making the eclmes and the
management at Melbourne Tivoli glad they
are alive. In delving into old strata of for-
gotten vaudeville Will Whitburn, Charles
Pope, Andrew Higginson and their team of
nigger minstrels have struck a paying vein,
and full houses are demonstrating that they
like the old songs and wheezes better than
the new ones —if there are any new ones.

The Romano Bros., two gladiatorial giants
who show that, even if Greek art has been
submerged in jazz, the Greek physique is
still attainable by homo neanderthaliensis in
1925, are the star features of the Bijou
(Melb.) bill this week. Some of their imita-
tions of ancient statuary recall Praxiteles at
his best. For the rest, Wendling and Molloy
supply vocal melody, Phil Lopez eccentric
humor and Bella and Morris some noisy and
rather tedious farce. The stories puryeyed
by Maude Courtney and Mr. C. are risible
enough to make even a reverend listener
forget that he oughtn’t to be there.

Hoyt’s De Luxe, Melbourne, this week is
offering a picture called “The Fool,” which
makes a dramatic plea for tolerance and
brotherly love. New York went to see the
picture for a year, which may possibly ac-
count for the recent improvement in the
divorce figures for that sinful city. There
is plenty of weather at the Majestic, which
is screening “Judgment of the Storm.” The
story was written by a newchum, who never-
theless has worked up his plot to an in-
telligible and exciting climax.
Melbourne’s orgy of art-sliows:—
An aristocratic crowd is keeping company at the
Decoration Gallery. Heysen’s fine “Hahndorf, 5.A.,”
looks as if the German settlers had altered the scenery
in a fit of reminiscence. David Davies sends from
Europe a fetching Venetian study, and Cumbrae
Stewart passes on from London some rather niggling-
sketches of ladies in lobster pots. Follen Bishop
is another expatriated Australian who has bolted
the English tradition, cottage gardens, country lanes
and all; and Streeton is likewise in an English
mood. J. H. Scheltema casts the eye of an agri-
cultural expert on some cattle; and Carl Hampel
has some trees and glades that are nicely behaved,
but lack incident, like a wet Sunday. W. B.
Mclnnes has two children stiffly posed but well
painted. Much of the sincerity and allurement of
the show is contained inside the frame of Withers’s
curious picture of a tin shed set in autumn-tinted
bush.
Judging by the examples of pictorial publicity
displayed at the Queen’s Hall by past and present
pupils of the Commercial Art School, a night-
class for the aesthetic education of advertising
managers is badly needed; and if the 62 young
terrors here exhibiting are to be the future decorators
Of our hoardings, the grave for at least one citizen
will be robbed of its sting. To the above melan-
choly dicta James Flett, Oliver Dale (Trans.
Railway poster), Vern Ditchburn and Beryl Hart-
land are only tentative exceptions. Bad taste and
valiant bad drawing distinguish practically all the
rest.
A glimmering of soul and plenty of sound
draughtsmanship are displayed by F. R. Thompson
and V. Murray Griffin, two young Victorians, in
their show of oils at the Athenneum. Thompson
has, perhaps, a larger helping of the soul, can see
a landscape (as in No. 25) emotionally, shove it
on canvas in a moment of excitement, and stop
when the mood has died. He sculpts his foregrounds
carefully with the brush, but gets atmosphere into
his distances as well. Griffin paints a trifle more
sedately, but he too has been cuffed in passing by
the great god Pan, and in “Dusk and the Billa-
bong” and “By the Quiet River’’ has placed the
poetic encounter on record. Both have portraits
of themselves and other people that show promise,
v * ; I ;
Adelaide shows are light and bright. At
the Majestic, Con Moreni’s crowd provides
about half the programme, to which three
Janetzskis and three Kuhns contribute some
good music. In pictures, Jackie Coogan, at
the York, has something fresh in his life
among cannibals (more or less). The Rav.
has taken a long stride from Rin-tin-tm to
Moses, who brings his Commandments on a
second visit. Wondergraph contrasts Betty
Balfour with Bebe Daniels; and West’s
brackets Colleen Moore with Henley-on-
Torrens. At the Garden (open air) George
Gee is genuinely funny when devising dance-
steps to any tune which a malicious orches-
tra under Cade can set him; and Ernest
Sefton does the gentlemanly-inebriate busi-
ness well. Nellie Bramley is just starting a
season at the Royal.

The Oriana Madrigal Society made glad
melody at Melbourne Auditorium one night
last week in madrigals and folk- and part-
songs covering the whole period from 1552
till to-day. “As Vesta Was from Latinos
Hill Descending” (Thomas Weelkes) was a
triumph over difficulties, for there was much
running up and down the eminence in intri-
cate scale and fugal form, and W. C. Fra-
zier’s little band of men and maids made no
slips. “O Little Snowflake,” by the Welsh
Cyril Jenkins, and “A Cradle Song,” by
John Ireland, were real harmonic soothing-
syrup. Assisting talent included the Clarke
scholarship winner Roy Shepherd, whose
technique guided him safely through the
“Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue” of Bach,
and lesser numbers.
“John’s Wood”: J. N. Maskelyne, the
magician and chief director of “England’s
Home of Mystery,” which for over 50 years
has delighted a section of Londoners, is so
pleased with the success of his recent visit
to S’Africa that he is contemplating an Aus-
tralian tour. Amazing as many of the items
are, the show would probably need song or
dance items to make it a sure draw in the
Commonwealth. The matinee, which is now
often the best-paying performance of the
London amusement world, was invented by
Maskelyne half a century ago, and for many
years was advertised as “the only afternoon
entertainment in London.” Henry Irving
dropped in one day, and, finding a crowded
house, soon afterwards gave an experimental
matinee at the Lyceum. Other theatres
quickly followed.
“A.G.M.” : Pessimism is the main cry in
England to-day whether in the world of poli-
tics, finance, music or drama. Lamentations
are loud and long in the theatrical world,
and Marie Tempest is among those who in-
sist that all the vitality of English drama
is centred in New York. Forbes Robertson
adopts the standpoint that the decadence of
the theatre—in so far as there is such de-
cadence —is due to the disappearance of the
actor-manager and the too-great domination
of the glorified stage-manager now known as
the “producer.” The actor-manager had a
dual interest, but the commercial manager
is wholly concerned with £ s. d. and cares
nothing for art. Sir Barry Jackson, the
millionaire director of the Birmingham
Repertory Theatre, a man who has done
great things for the drama, has also been
saying that commercial direction is bringing
a blight on the English stage. The business
man who has entered the theatrical world
seeks out the easiest road to a handsome
credit balance, he says, and, playing down to
the groundlings, provides the meretricious
stuff that will make the quickest appeal. The
,actor turned manager, according to Sir
Barry, even in spite of himself, always keeps
an eye on Art with a big A, and tries to
give the public what he thinks the public
ought to want.
“ Adamascus ”: Someone asserts (B.
12/11/’25) that “the present generation has
had no opportunity of viewing ‘Are You a
Mason ?’ ” This may be true of the big
cities, but D. B. O’Connor has been doing
the “smalls” with “Are You a Mason?” and
“A Night Out” for 12 months or more.
I encountered him in Geelong in October,
1924, and he was in Rockhampton a couple
of months ago.
“H.J.Iv.”: The years haven’t been alto-
gether kind to Charlie Pope, who is re-
appearing with Will Whitburn in the
once familiar half-circle for the first time
since the early ’nineties, but they haven’t
robbed him of his sense of humor. Of Pope
it is told that when a hotel was raided by
policeman in search of Sunday traders (lie
very massive comedian was discovered under
a bed. Asked for an explanation, he said:
‘‘Think- dis chicken am gwine t’ let every-
body see him sayin’ his prayers? No, sail!”
On his name being taken, he adjured his
ABOVE SUSPICION.
MRS. BERTIE FITZGOOF : “I’d be glad to help you. I wonder if I
could trust you to clean ou t the fowthouse.”
MR. HENRY IRVING : “ Madame, in the tragedy of the fowthouse, I
am the understudy of C[?]sar’s wife.”

Goldilocks : Kitty Reidy, too, has fallen
on tee t in London, the lead in Wild-
dower . having come her way soon after
her _ arrival. Kitty, nursing the very usual
feminine stage-dreams whilst in a humdrum
job in Sydney, vanished from the Con., where
her likeable voice was being given a polish,
before the job was half done, and appeared

Bm <ie then 5 the complaint which afflicts many
ra I )1( ”y exalted stars handicapped her. Her
P rom Pt success in London is therefore rather
surprising; but Australians are fashionable
Giere at the moment.
“Hamfat”: Barrie is objecting to the re-
vival of “Walker, London,” the rights of
which he sold in 1892 for £250. The revival
now would be worth £lO,OOO to him; but
“the play was an early indiscretion, which
would be better dead,” says Barrie. The
last two words act as a reminder of Barrie's
earliest book. It was “Better Dead,” a
whimsical story of a society formed for the
purpose of doing without some people.
“C.Q.” : Another homing Australian mum-
mer is James Hughes, who played with
Muriel Starr and M. Superbus Knight. Geo.
Highland has fished him out of U.S.A. to
play the sergeant in “Rose Marie,” one of
the Firm’s new productions.
“Caul-boy” : To judge by the programmes,
the Drury-lane performance of "Rose Marie,
the lyric of the Rockies that comes this way
shortly, beats Wembley as a booster of trade.
Here are some of the items from the pro-
gramme :
Indian and Sports Dresses in Act I. and Totem
Costumes by Comanche, Ltd.
Uniforms and Men's Suita by Snip & Son, Ltd,
Men’s Modern Suits by Cuttem & Sewem,
Boots and Shoes by A, L. Brogan,
Hosiery by W. J. Fleshtint.
Woollen Goods by Puremerino, Ltd-.
Electrical Fittings by Galvanic & Co-.
The Fan used in Ballroom Scene by Monsieur J.
Carlovanloux.
Also three of the stars give the customary
testimony that they use no other pen but Bo-
and-so’s. Incidentally, there is a play
attached to the affair, but it probably feels
apologetic, like a drunk at a Board meeting.
“Huffin-Guffin”: My memories of Wirths’
Circus go back to 1832. It travelled by road
then. The day it came to our village the
attendance at school was 10; the average was
70. School broke up early that afternoon, and
the whole TO, good
boys and truants,
viewed the wonder-
ful work of erect-
ing the big tent.
Ilow to get into it
in the evening was
the next problem,
for boys did not
have money to burn
in those days. Our
family was lucky.
I was deputed to
hold the big drum
for the artist who
manipulated that
instrument, and my
brother was ap-
pointed feeder to
the monkeys. He
was, by the way,
such a success that
he was taken on
the staff. He got
two towns —two
days—away before,
growing weary of
waiting on apes, he
bolted home; and
great was the re-
joining .over the re-
turn of the prodi-
gal son.
“F.A.”: Sydney
Royal has
had a jubilee.
On December 10,
1875, it was opened
by Sam Lazar, of
Adelaide, the play
being H. J. Byron's
comedy “Daisy
Farm.” On the site
of the Prince of
Wales’s Theatre,
which had been
burnt down three
years before, the
Royal was built in
28 weeks and had
seating aecommo-
tion for 2300
people. It was a
cold time for theat-
rical enterprise,
and “Daisy Farm” ran only four nights. The
Royal was destined to be intimately associ-
ated with the ‘fortunes of J. C. Williamson;
but lie did not see it until 1879.
Frank Talbot writes :
“Schnorrer,” who states that Melbourne has a
tendency to keep away from performances in which
Jews are featured (B. 10/12/’25), evidently has
not paid a recent visit to the Athenaeum Theatre.
So far from Harry Green and Roy Rene getting a
lukewarm reception in “Give and Take,” the thing
is now in its ninth week, and the season has been
extended for another four weeks. As a matter of
fact, “Give and Take” has proved one of the greatest
successes of the year, and it is safe to say that 90
per cent, of the big audiences are not Jews.
“Loud”: A quite new version of “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” has reached London. There
is a determined attempt to make it agree
with modern (American) ideas. It is full
of songs, not only negro “spirituals” of the
Edna Thomas type, but comic ones. The
Little Eva death-scene has been cut right
out —she dies, but not on the stage. And
Uncle Tom is allowed to “get” Simon Legree
with a “gun.”
“Alwyn”: Exactly S 6 years ago this
month Australia’s first pantomime was pro-
duced- at the old Victoria Theatre, Sydney.
That long-demolished playhouse was then
only IS months old. The performance took
the form of a benefit to Belmore, the mechan-
ist, and a composition of his own was pro-
duced "The Fairy Whale, or the Harlequin
Headsman.” Mrs. Knowles was Columbine,
and Miss Winstauley (known as Mrs. Win-
Stanley when she became a member of
Charles Kean's London cb.) Was the Fairy
W hale.
“Imbgen”: The metamorphosis of MeF
bourne Playhouse into a dance club will
embarrass for a tiine the Repertory move-
ment in Victoria. The Playhouse w;is not
well situated, theatrically speaking, but it
possessed accommodation superior to tlifc
average hall, had an intimacy which gave
"atmosphere,” and w r as inexpensive. It be-
came in the public mind associated with ama-
teur acting, and that helped. Melbourne has
many halls, but few of them attractive for
theatrical work. The Atlienmum, once the
home of shows untainted even in Methodist
eyes with a suspicion of the playhouse, is
now a regular theatre—and dear to hire.
The Queen’s Hall, shrine of Theosophy and
similar eclectic societies, is too small, and
is innocent of stage or dressing-space. There
are church halls and friendly-society assem-
bly-rooms, but they have no facilities for the
manipulation of scenery, etc.; moreover, it
is the hardest thing on earth to lure tin l
casual playgoer into a building that looks
like a chapel or a lodge. The Heps, hope
piously at every session for means to erect
or adapt a “little theatre” Of their Own.
“John's Wood” (Lond.) : When Ttini
Quinlau took John Qoates to Australia a
dozen years ago as his principal dramatist
tenotj many scoffed and considered Coates
unequal to demands. John was then at iiiii
height of his powers, and had sung operatic
leads with Melba, Nordica and other great
stars. A few months ago Coates made an-
other visit to America, and in the teeth of
competition such as Australia could never
offer won great acclaim in New York and
the other big centres. Early in November
he gave a recital in London, of which the
Daily Telegraph said: “Probably there is
no man living who could have carried off
with flying colors so fine a programme as
that given by John Coates last night.”
“H. Hardupp”: The average Australian is
a travelled person compared with the Eng-
lishman of “the provinces,” but even in Aus
tralia you encounter queer instances of people
who are fastened to one spot. There is a sales-
man in a Sydney Haymarket shop—he lives
in a lodging-house nearly opposite—who for
10 years has not strayed farther from his
regular haunts than Batlmrst-street on the
one side, the railway-station on the other,
and Elizabeth-street towards the east. He
seems satisfied with his cloistered life, but
his interest in matters outside his work is
slight. A friend remarked casually that
“The Barber of Seville” was at the Hippo-
drome. “I don’t care if ’e is,” replied the
recluse; “I’ll still ’ave me ’air cut at Joe’s.”
“Curtain Baiser”: The notion that the
mummer is a casual sort of laborer isn’t
always true. Many a city clerk in these days
of economic maladjustments would envy the
steady job enjoyed by Maude Courtney and
Mr. C., the couple whose specialty is after-
dinner stories of the ncar-the-knuckle order.
They_ have been continuously on the Fuller
circuit for nine years.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : There are some queer
birds on the Australian stage or thereabouts.
One of them, with the aspect of a butcher’s
assistant who had put an extra load of
mutton-fat in his hair, I met outside the
G.11.Q. of a theatrical firm. After telling
me that he had “been playing in the
country,” the indignation burning in his soul
seethed forth. “These blokes,” he breathed,
“won’t give me a job. They don’t care ’ow
well a bloke kin liact; all they kin tork
about is ’ow he ought to speak Hinglish.”
“Hamfat”: Joyfully resurrected in the film
version, which is having a prosperous run
in Australian picture-theatres, and profitably
revived on the boards by the Neil-Tuohy co.
in Melbourne and Sydney. “Charley’s Aunt”
is to be played by the Nellie Bramley co.
in Adelaide. Three appearances at the same
time! It reminds me of the days when
theatrical managements with a metropolitan
success on hand formed No. 2 (in some cases
No. 3) companies to reap the country har-
vest.
“C. Ockney” : Quaint are some of the rea-
sons given by theatrical managers for the
untimely disappearance of play productions
from their stages. A very candid one was that
of Rutland Barrington, who, in withdrawing
Gilbert’s “Brantinghame Hall” after a few
dreadful nights at the St. James’s, announced
that the piece had “failed to attract.” But
this has been beaten by the American man-
ager-author Edgar Selwyn, who staged a
piece of his own with the fateful title “Some-
thing to Brag About” at the N.Y. Booth
Theatre. It proved the biggest failure of
the season, running for four nights only.
On the day of its last performance the fact
was notified thus: “Edgar Selwyn apologises
for ‘Something to Brag About.’ and bogs to
announce its withdrawal from the Booth this
evening.”
IN THE MORNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Alderman Rivett was of opinion that Toowoomba
girls were sufficiently honorable to swim between
(> and 8 o’clock in the morning without misbehaving
themselves.... After further discussion the motion
to permit mixed bathing at the public baths between
6 a.m. and 8 a.m. was carried by five votes to four.”
“1 trust her!” cried the alderman, and waited for
the cheers.
“I trust her!” Through his voice there ran a hint
of hidden tears,
As if the wicked thoughts of men he viewed with
honest scorning.
“I trust each staid Toowoomba maid,
Without the need of warning,
To be as good as maiden should,
Sweet modesty adorning—
That is (ahem!) from six a.m.
To eight, say, in the morning.”
“I trust her,” in a little while he hastened to
repeat,
“Despite insinuations vile by evil minds you meet,
Whose foul and stupid breath, indeed, they’d better
far be saving
Since all they say, Toowoomba way,
We treat as so much raving
Of knaves and churls. Toowoomba girls,
Though dull com ention braving,
1 staunchly rate (from six to eight)
Above all misbehaving.”
And straightway then that Council grave went into
solemn session,
To think if there was need to save from every sweet
transgression
These simple maids who seek the baths when summer
suns awaken;
And pro and eon. they argued on
The risks and perils taken
When baths are fixed for bathers mixed
And old conventions shaken.
Resolved: We’ll trust them to be good
But only, be it understood,
Before the eggs and bacon.
QUEENSLAND.

HORNBY TRAINS
BRITISH AND GUARANTEED.
Real trains are made of steel and then painted in their correct colors —so are
Hornby Trains. Real trains pull heavy loads over long distances —so do Hornby
Trains. Real trains don’t run round and round a circular track all day, neither
do Hornby Trains. You can build up a REAL railway system in miniature
complete to the smallest detail —if you like. That’s why Hornby Trains are such
good fun —they’re so REAL that you don’t just play at trains you own and
run a real railway. Ask your Father to buy you a Hornby Train Set for Christmas.

GUARANTEE.
Hornby Trains are tested and
their efficiency is guaranteed. A
form of guarantee is furnished with
each loco, and we undertake to
repair or replace, at our option,
any loco that fails to run satisfac-
torily from any cause other than
misuse, within 60 days of purchase.

At Christmas
5 Minutes of Your Time Spent in Selecting a T>uofold Ten
Means 25 Years of Happiness for Someone You Love
ONLY a pen of permanent value is worthy of the
Christmas occasion. And Parker Duofold will
signify to anyone who gets it, that you gave the finest
that money can buy.
Even at higher prices you cannot get Duofold improvements
—nor a pen with Duofold’s place in the world’s admiration.
Besides, the Duofold’s black-tipped lacquer-red colour
abounds with Christmas cheer. A gift that will preserve the
memories of this Christmas as long as its point shall wear—guar-
anteed, if not misused, for 25 years, good for 50 years.
Not once —but several times a day will friends and loved ones
write with this inspiring reminder of you a pen so
beautiful and smooth and balanced that day by day
one values it more. Hence will one’s affection for the
giver grow accordingly.
Five minutes of your time spent buying a Duo-
fold Pen means 25 years of happiness for someone
you love. But look and look carefully for this honour
stamp —“Geo. S. Parker DUOFOLD.” Then imi-
tations cannot deceive you. For sale by all leading
Stationers, Jewellers and Departmental Stores.

Energy: Yes, we dare say there were
plenty he didn't mention ; and there is no particular
reason for picking out one,.. .Q.M.F.: Can't find
the space for it. ...Bank Pad: May be true, but it’s
not interesting, and that settles its hash.... Dorothy
K.: “Answered” very nearly managed it. .. .K. J.C. :
Can’t you give “Jumbuck” a better ending?....
J.K.L.: Just slops on in the old way... .F.J.1.:
Far too slight. Packard: The verse hasn’t a pulse
in it. ...A.A. (Turramurra): No use to u 5....
Arthur M.: Doesn’t strike us Bert B.: Not with-
out some glimmerings. Try to improve the form. .. .
Eadie: “Critic” hasn’t quite the necessary distinction.
....Burnt Fingers: You’ll have to call the ear-
tuner in before you'll do much good A.G.M.:
Afraid you don’t say anything that even looks new.
.... R.W.: But how would ybu suggest that the
department should get over its difficulty ?....
Herbert B.: Doesn’t suit Red Page and is too
long for Poverty Point. But there’s matter in it
for several P.P. pars H.H.S.: Thanks, but it
won’t quite St in.... Veritas: No market here....
M.S.A.: First rate. We’re always wanting to hear
things we don’t know about people we do know.
G.M.C.: Better let it drop. The writer didn’t
condemn him for it. ...Quiz: But he did stand it.
He has been at the job for 40 years... .C.8.M.:
The verse isn’t good enough to carry it through....
Douglas E.: Doesn’t grip u 5.... J.C.8.: Very rough
stuff. . . .S.E.R.W.: Ends well ; see if you can’t make
the rest less commonplace. Frank W.: Why do you
worry a perfectly nice stream by asking it all those
uninteresting questions in heavy verse?... .J.H.
(Gympie) : The triolets miss. . . .E.A.D.: Not up by
a furlong or more... .O.W-P-The, verses must be
a good deal better than those you send .... J.8.M.:
Not quite enough in it... .H.L.G.: The point is too
5ma11.... Dreary Dick,: They miss.... N.E.R.: You
try some impossible tricks with the verse... .P.H.C.:
Rather an old subject and with nothing fresh about
the handling... ..J.D. (Dubbo): The verse doesn’t
carry it... .E.L.0.: A thing like that needs to be
very dainty; yours wallops along rather heavily....
Raymond R.: Doesn’t strike us hard enough....
Blue Wren: Not much in our line 0.L.: Regret
that we have room for only the gist of it: —
Adventurous men in many a clime
On outpost duty, without a dime
Of recompense, but glory be
A Douglas to the rescue he!
In the Argentine, far Timbuctoo,
In Russia’s cold, in Woolloomooloo,
India and China and in Peru,
A Douglas you’ll find, some foo the noo.
But alack and alas, the bard is defunct,
His lyre and his lore in oblivion sunkt.
He never heard, he never told
Of our Douglas, whom we now unfold.
W.E.B.: A yarn told in that manner couldn’t be
convincing, no matter how the details were twisted.
. ...H.N.H.: Your mirth tramps in heavy bluchers.
. ...M.A. (Marrickville): Wooden little yarn....
Fredrick F.: It may save space to leave the sen-
tences without verbs, but it makes the tale jumpy
and hysterical.... Kinothe: Not enough there.... B.
Derry: You thin it out too much.... Curtis A.:
Horrible story without much of a point.... J.D. A.:
The ode to the odor is feeble... .C.W.K.: Too slight.
....Minnie M.: Falls far short... .M.G, (Bendigo):
Much too p00r... .Florence I.: Nothing in the story;
and the stuff written like verse bears no relation to
the genuine article. .. .R.L.J,: The New Year yarn
gets to very little and the verse is awkward and thin.
Ripponlea: Since Charles Kingsley died nobody
has shown much tender feeling for the delicate iicue
creatures: —
I’ th’ garden morsels sweet
The faithful father fondly gets—
Bits o’- this and that to eat,
For his darling little pets.
Snugly in yon lowly lair
How tenderly th’ mother squirms!
Protecting from th’ chilly air
Her family of baby worms.
See them snoozing safe and snug
Beneath this ivy-leafed geranium;
See each tender, youthful slug
Wag its rosy little cranium!
When they learn the way to wriggle
In and out through roots and staiks,
The mother, when they’ve all grown big’ll,
Take them out for little walks.
Of animals I’m very fond.
Aiid when the ground is pretty muddy
Down beside our poultry pond,
’Tis the time the worms do I study.
. ...J.S.D.: Doesn’t make us want to cheer anybody.
....Gertrude R.: No use. ... Valoreen: Only repeats
commonplaces in bad verse.... P. O. Mac.: I ull of
lumps. .. .Bohemian: Both the verse and the grammar
might be improved.... T.McC.: A succession of
stumbles, and the roads idea has been worked almost
to death... .J.T.M.: Verse of that quality can be
turned out by’ the mile... .J.J.H.: Narrowly misses
being a shocking example. .. .J.R.L: We couldn’t add
to the gloom of Christmas like that.... J.H. (Mary-
borough): Poor verse: old thought... .C.0.C.: It’s
about the thinnest sketch of the future that has yet
come our way. ..-.D.W. (Old Guildford): Couldn’t be
much worse... .W.J.W.: Hardly any thought there;
merely a repetition of what is most often said.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.G.: First joke is a centenarian and the other is
his twin brother... .A.R.M.: A circle enclosing two
dots and the letter T upended is a crude way to
draw a face... .M.A.: You really ought to take the
mis-shapen infant to the nearest baby clinic for
overhauling... .A.T.: Your outlines have the ague.
... .C.M.: Sorry, but we can’t give stabling for your
lean and hungry moke... .H.D.R.: Not much good
getting inspirations until you learn to master your
drawing pen. ... J.A.K.: Not too bad, but overstocked
with drawing-room jokes. Try something with action
in it, and let the picture tell the story.
“Area Officer” : We lost the run of young
Bill Jones. Heard his mother lived at Won-
thaggi. Wrote her for information about the
missing one, and enclosed a stamped and, ad-
dressed envelope for reply; but none came to
hand. As a last.resort we threatened the lady
with proceedings against her for “illegal de-
tention of Government property, to wit, one
stamped and addressed envelope.” This
worked —the stamped and addressed envelope
was returned. But our hopes were dashed
when we opened the envelope. It contained
a piece of toilet-paper.

“My heart with pleasure thrills
- And dances with the daffodils”
When penning these lines Wordsworth must have felt in a rather
exultant mood. A heart that wants to go jazzing with the daffo-
dils is unusually rare, and what a merry old world this would
be if we could all have those feelings. But, modern conditions
of living intervene. The constant race againSt time means
hurried and irregular meals, which in time claim their pitiless
toll in the form of Acute Indigestion
And it’s when the digestive organs become clogged with poisonous
secretions that those dull, nagging pains in the stomach arise.
Headaches, constipation and despondency follow—life doesn’t
seem to be worth living
In this state you require a true service medicine, such as that reliable old family jnend

“Wessel” : Lately there was a controversy
between Joey Carruthers and P. J. Nally
about the number of species of bananas
grown in the Hawaiian Islands, given by
the knight as 120. According to E. Baxter
Riley, who has had a deal of experience in
those parts, the Papuans of the delta of the
Fly River, one small corner of Papua, grow
50 different kinds of bananas, so the 120 for
the whole Hawaiian group seems nothing to
write home about.

“Hiram”: The rebuilding of Sydney is
proceeding more sedately. In 1924 new
buildings valued at £14,500,000 were erected ;
for the first half of the current year the
value was only £5,500,000, or at a rate of
£3,500,000 a year less. For the present the
oflice-building business has been so much
overdone that some hungry landlords are
angling for tenants by offering to shift them
from their present premises and set them up
in new ones without charge.
* * * *
“Waaksamheid”: The Philadelphia was
not the first vessel under a foreign flag to
enter Sydney Harbor (B. 20/11/’25). That
distinction belonged to the Waaksamheid,
from Batavia, which arrived with provisions
in 1791. She was afterwards chartered to
take Hunter and the shipwrecked crew of
the Sirius to England. I fancy, too, that
the Philadelphia was the second arrival from
TJ.S.A. According to Governor Macquarie’s
list she was preceded by the Hope of'Khode
Island.
“Pigskin”: “Fish Creek” (B. 19/11/’25)
asks where pigskin comes from. Before the
war most of the pigskin used in Australia
came from Germany and Austria, grown
and tanned there. During the war Japan
supplied a fair amount; and very poor stuff
it was, with an artificial surface to cover
the scratches and scars. Nowadays some
is tanned in Victoria, but most of the
choicest skins come from Ehgland and Scot-
land. The big, thick skins used in making
leggings are generally from wild boars
gi’own in Germany and tanned in England
or Germany.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Melbourne’s building boom
shows no signs of fading. In 1914 the City
Council approved ot 768 new buildings, in-
volving an expenditure of £694,104; during
the war years operations slumped as low as
£259,596 in 1917* After that things became
brisker; a million and a quarter was spent
on 723 buildings in 1921. Since then there
has been a yearly jump ; in 1924 there were
1178 applications for permission to erect
£2,352,530 worth of edifice, and the sum is
likely to be exceeded this year. A multi-
tude of the new buildings rise to the height
limit of 132 feet, and many of them are as
architecturally beautiful as a packing-case
placed on end and slitted for windows.
* * * *
“Spare Part” : In Melbourne a man who
had been sold a motor-car “in good running
order” for £45 refused to pay for it because
soon after he took delivery it developed de-
fects that called for expensive repairs. He
was told by an unsympathetic Justice that
he would have to pay, as there could have
been no warranty of condition at such a
price. In trade usage “Good running order”
means merely that the motor can be made to
mote at the time of sale. How long it will
keep on moting is a matter for the buyer
to find out. If the contraption won’t run,
then the correct way to describe it, accord-
ing to trade ethics, is “suitable for mechanic.”
“Hamer”: Melbourne still gets home o’
nights, but it travels less comfortably than
it used to before the ’Bus Act came into
operation. The groans of the ’bus pro-
prietors as to what would happen if the Act
was introduced weren’t all bluff. The big
’buses have been sold, mainly to Sydney,
and only 51 ply in Melbourne where 300
used to —these in addition to 21 coaches
registered under the old Act and not affected
by the new one. The railways are now
running motor-coaches to Geelong in oppo-
sition to Private Enterprise. Apparently the
idea is to beat the private motors off the
road, and then, by withdrawing the service,
force people back to the trains. That has
been-done already in one case.
* * * *
“Petrie”: At the first sale of Brisbane
land (held in Sydney on July 16, 1842)
what is now one of the best business sec-
tions of the city was disposed of. This
was the block bounded by Queen, Elizabeth,
Albert and George streets. The lots (36
perches) averaged £132. Nowadays land
in this quarter is valued at £3OO to
£4OO a foot. A small lot a little lower down
Queen-street changed hands the other day
for £5OO a foot. The corner lot, opposite
the Treasury building, where the Bank of
New South Wales now stands, was sold
originally for £230. The purchaser failed
to meet, his bills; the lot reverted to the
Government, and on being put up to auction
again it was knocked down for £26. The
bank is preparing to put up a modern six-
storey building to replace the present quaint
old structure.
• * * *
“Ces”: The Vic. State Fruit Advisory
Board has devised a scheme for bringing
producer and consumer closer together. The
idea is for all sections of growers to trans-
port their fruit in special trains to depots
to be established in various parts of the
State, from which the goods will be distri-
buted to the consumer by van and kerb
market. To test the scheme the Govern-
ment has advanced £2OOO to the Board,
mainly for establishing kerb markets and to
conduct a fruit-eating publicity campaign.
If the test is a success, the growers will
carry it on and extend it, paying for this
by a levy on fruit sold or by a small
orchard tax. Incidentally, the Government
intends taking away from municipalities
the power to prohibit kerb markets, which
have nroved a success in several Melbourne
suburbs.


In case there are any “Mr. Cook’s” in Australia and New
Zealand we reproduce this advertisement as it appeared in
the September 12 th issue of the Saturday Evening Post
Dear Mr. Cook:
You defied us to prove that any car could travel 400,000 miles
in three years. Truth is stranger than fiction when
dealing with One-Profit Studebakers
Our ad in the July 11th “Post” said:
“One Studebaker Big Six Touring Car traveled 94,000 miles on
mountain roads in California during its first 2 1 /z years of service.
Then it was sold to a newspaper carrier company, and as a ‘used
car* traveled 400 miles a day for 3 years more, adding another
400,000 miles.’’
Which caused Mr. Walter F. Cook of Larkspur, California ,
to write to The Saturday Evening Post as follows:
“One of my ideals has been shattered, that is my faith in the truth of any
statement appearing in a Saturday Evening Post advertisement.
“The cause of this, is that statement appearing in the Studebaker ad in the
July 11,1925, issue, which stated that a used Studebaker Big Six car was driven
400 miles a day for three years for a total of 400,000 miles. It is my firm
belief that that would be a physical impossibility, and I defy anyone to prove
it; figure it out for yourself—if you’ve ever driven a car you will see the
absurdity of it. This is the first letter of this nature that I’ve ever written.”
TWO affidavits, reproduced on this page, attest the
truth of our statement. The car itself is now in
the Studebaker museum at South Bend. After having
traveled more than half a million miles under its own
power it was retired in January, 1924.
This Big Six was purchased by Fenton Norman
of Santa Paula, California, on June 13, 1918. During
the ensuing two years and four months he drove the
Ctfr 94,000 miles. These were hard miles too. through
California, Oregon. Washington. Wyoming, Nevada,
Arizona and Old Mexico. Then he sold the car to a
company engaged iif delivering newspapers.
Every morning for three years this veteran picked
up a load of Los Angeles Times. It traveled to Santa
Barbara, more than one hundred miles distant, over a
hard route, dropping bundles along the way. yet main-
taining a schedule of 30 miles an hour.
Kept two drivers busy
Then it hurried back to Los Angeles in time to pick
up a load of afternoon newspapers copies of the
Express. The same car. with a new driver, made this
second round trip, of more than 200 miles, each day,
except Sunday—often pulling a trailer On Sunday
afternoons and evenings it was used only for pleasure
driving. Multiply 313 weekdays by 400 and 52 Sun-
days by 200 Add the results and multiply by 3 years
and you have a total in excess of 400,000 miles.
The original owner drove it 94,000 miles. As a
second-hand car it added 400,000 miles. Then Stude-
baker bought it back, and it was driven in winter across
the continent to the New York automobile show. It
was never rebuilt.
No wonder you found this record hard to believe.
Mr Cook. It would take 80 years at 6,000 miles a
year to pile up such mileage. Yet we have records of
hundreds of Studebakers which have traveled more
than 100,000 miles each
The tremendous excess mileage for which Stude-
baker cars have long been noted, is largely due to the
inherent advantages of the Studebaker "one-profit”
basis of motor car manufacture.
Studebaker is the only fine car manufacturer today
building all of its own bodies engines. clutches, gear sets,
springs, differentials, steering gears, axles, gray iron
castings and drop forgings This not only eliminates
extra profits v but also enables Studebaker to offer you
o lunch better car for the monev
A better car because Studebaker, being a complete
manufacturer of automobiles, is .able to control the
quality of materials and workmanship from the time
of purchase until the finished product leaves the factory.
One-profit car built as a unit
In its own great plants, Studebaker converts raw
materials into finished units, designed solely for Stude-
baker cars. These units are brought together to form
a perfectly balanced whole. Thus every Studebaker
car is a harmoniously co-ordinated unit, with all of the
advantages of unit construction.
Wm/WM
This is the Stud choker Big Six which
traveled more than half a million
miles under its otm power
As an example ot a "one-profit” value, we urge that
you see the Studcbaker Big Six Duplex-Phaeton, suc-
cessor to the car which made the 500,000-mile record.
Here is a car big in power, big in comfort, big in
reserve transportation.
POWER—OnIy eight American cars equal it, ac-
cording to the rating of the National Automobile
Chamber of Commerce, and these eight sell at prices
100% to 300% higher than the Big Six.
COMFORT—It is built to hold seven people with-
out crowding—big springs—big snubbers—full-size

cealed within the steel-framed

out leaving his seat. The Duplex is a feature offered

Lights are operated from the steering wheel. In
addition to the usual instruments on the dash, there
is an 8-day clock, also a gasoline gauge. The improved
one-piece windshield has an automatic wiper One
key opens the coincidental lock of ignition and steer-
ing gear as well as the tire lock.
No "yearly models ”
Remember, too, that Studebaker has discontinued the
custom of presenting a new line of cars each year.
This policy of ‘‘no yearly models” means that the
Studebaker you buy today is completely up to date—
and will not suffer unnecessary depreciation through
spectacular announcements of new "yearly models."
Any Studebaker dealer will be glad to show you this
sturdy, dependable “one-profit” car, and finance its
purchase on a fair and liberal Budget Payment Plan.

Queerly enough, the annual allowance of
Melbourne’s Gaud Mayor is passed under
the terms of an old N. S. Wales Act. My
Lord draws £l5OO a year; Henry_ Condell,
the first of the mayoral line, got £350.
Clifford Book has been appointed assistant
Crown Prosecutor in Vic. “Brought to
Book” will have a new meaning for Vic-
torian wrongdoers now. He will get £BOO
a year to start with.
Dr. Norman Maclean, of Edinburgh, who
is to occupy the pulpit at Scots’ Church,
Collins-street, Melbourne, for a few months
late next year, has spun a good many yarns
—outside the pulpit. “Children of the
Mists” is his best-known bit of fiction.
The will of Septimus Miller was the long-
est ever lodged in the Vic. Probate Office.
It contained over 14,000 words; the previous
record was about 10,000. The shortest for
which probate has ever been applied in Vic-
toria consisted of the six words: “I leave
all to my wife.”
Bendigo had a double funeral of a brother
and sister —their name was Lohmann —the
other day. They had spent all their lives to-
gether, the sister, who was the senior, being
02 when death came. On Thursday the
brother died; on Friday the sister was found
dead, sitting upright in a chair. Evidently
grief and shock had caused her death.
“T. 0.1.”: Amongst pubs doomed to dis-
appear through Sydney street improvements
is the Swan with Two Necks on the corner
of Park and George streets. The sign dates
back 92 years, when the house was kept by
Thomas Avery. In 1850 the licensee was
Benjamin Palmer, who became Mayor of
Sydney a quarter of a century later.
“T.P.’ 1 ’: To stop the slaughter of pro-
tected native fauna the receivers must ue
squelched. One culprit heavily fined for an
ungodly haul remarked to a friend: “It’s
all right; my orders are to shift ground
and carry on as usual. They’ll pay all
fines.” Gaol without the option must come
if our native friends, both quadruped and
biped, are to be saved from extinction.
It. J. Champion has retired, through fail-
ing health, after over half a century of
Government service for South Aus. He made
a name in the Audit Office in Adelaide, and
in 1901 was sent to London, where for 20
years lie was accountant in the Agent-
General’s office, under Grainger, Jenkins,
Kirkpatrick, Young and Lucas in turn. Since
returning home he has been secretary to the
Adelaide Hospital.
“ILK.” : The first cargo of ice to reach
Australia arrived at Sydney in the American
ship Lowell on January 11, 1855. There
were 494 tons of it, contained in 44 re-
frigerators. A wooden sawdust-lined bin was
built on Circular Quay for storing the ice.
Two exceptionally hot days delayed unload-
ing and caused a lot of wastage. The
Lowell also brought the first ice-chests. They
fetched from £l2 10s. each; the ice was sold
for Is. per pound.
Bob Solly, member for Carlton in Vic.
Assembly, who has been placed on the Uni.
Council in succession to the late Speaker
John Mackey, will get a friendly reception
from the dons at the seat of learning, since
he led a deputation to Lawson, then Pre-
mier, a few years ago and wrung from him
a promise to provide more than £200,000 for
additional buildings—a promise that was ful-
filled. Solly is always game to say blunt
things to a Government.
A grim little incident in the nautical
annals of the Speck. In 1846 the barque
Fortitude left Hobart on a whaling cruise ; and
off the south coast of Maoriland the captain’s
boat was capsized by a dying whale. The
crew of six lashed themselves as best they
could to the overturned boat, but one by one
they were washed away until only the skipper
remained. He had his finger in the plug-
hole and thus hung on until the mate’s boat
rescued him. His finger had swollen so
much that it could not be withdrawn from
the hole, and the rescuers had to hack it off
with a sheath-knife.
“I-lerodot” : Although the natural perfumes
that can be made from some Australian
native flowers, such as boronia (B.
29/10/'25)., compare more than favorably
with those extracted from the flowers of any
other country, it is not very likely that the
manufacture of them will ever develop with
us into an industry of importance. Nowadays
there is hardly a natural perfume which
cannot be imitated synthetically in the
chemical laboratory, and, generally, the cost
of these products is only a fraction of that of
the natural ones. In many instances only
an expert can distinguish between the arti-
ficial product and the other, and there are
hundreds of perfumes which are made in the
laboratory only.
“M.11.H.”: A feature of the century,
particularly of the post-war period, has)
been the decline and fail of the clerk. A
few years back his was considered a job
on the fringe of the professions, and a youth
who showed some ability in figures at school
and no marked inclination towards any
particular class of work was pretty certain
to drift to a high stooL The invasion of
women supplanted a lot of them; but the
most severe blow was dealt by calculating-
machines and labor-saving systems. One
Sydney firm I know of —doubtless one of
many—recently dismissed a whole staff of
clerks and set up a system which the ac-
countant and his assistant can run with the
co-operation of a few typists. Altogether
the future looks black for the men who know
nothing beyond the things that go into
ledgers.
“Jog”: If ever the Spencer-street bridge is
built —the project has got as far as the selec-
tion of a design—passengers by steamers
leaving the Yarra will find the Melbourne
wharves the most inconvenient in Australia.
No trams go near them now, but when
steamers are unable to come past the
Spencer-street bridge, there will be a further
half-mile to travel. The principal sufferers
will be those passengers arriving or departing
by Geelong, Tasmanian and M.L. steamers.
As the swinging basin will be in that por-
tion of the river above the bridge, it looks
as if the Harbor Trust will have to spend
vast sums in improving the lower Yarra for
navigation and berthing, and there will also
be a heavy loss through scrapping sheds and
wharves and river improvements above the
site of the proposed bridge. Little wonder
that vehement objections to its construction
are already being raised.

CREAM SEPARATOR
(Self-oiling)
is British-made throughout in Britain’s largest Separator Works.
British products, made of best materials, are cheapest in the long run.
With ordinary care the Lister will last out two or three generations of your family.
It will save you the money that would have to be spent in keeping some
machines in running order.
THE LISTER EMBODIES THE EXPERIENCE OF THIRTY
YEARS’ CREAM-SEPARATOR MANUFACTURING.
It is fitted with—
(a) OILBATH, with gears running in same, affording a continuous oil-spray
to bearings and neck-bearing making the oiling automatic. T
The accurately-cut spiral gears and the efficient oiling system make the New
Lister” an easy turning and almost silent separator.
(b) Few Conical Plates, which can be inserted in any order.
(c) A Seamless Anti-Splash Receiving Tin, with Special Safety Tap, preventing
the possibility of leakage.
The rubber ring does not fit into a groove, but being loose in the bowl is easily
removed for cleaning.
The frame is completely rigid, and so designed that gears are fully protected
from milk, water and dirt. ... . , - ol
Its initial cost is reasonable and commensurate with the high quality of material
and workmanship in the machine.
There is a reason for you to investigate the New Lister, and any one of the
Agents will supply information and Catalogue “B” on request.

Surfing Time is
Rexona Time!
To all lovers of outdoor sports, a dip in the roaring breakers on a summer s day is
indeed romance. Next day the sunburnt, blistered hands and scarlet face are painful realities.
This distress can be avoided by the application of soothing, cooling, healing Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, to the face, hands and arms. , ,
Try the following treatment after your swim and you will be delighted with the happy
results. First bathe the face, hands and arms in fresh water, making a good lather with
Rexona Soap. Massage with this, then softly dry and apply Rexona, the Rapid Healer
gently to the skin. If this is done, there will be no after-effects from exposure to the sun,
no regrets after a happy day, for the skin, soothed by the wonderful influence of Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, will quickly regain its normal temperature and comfortable coolness.
You will find Rexona Skin and Facial Soap ideal as a shampoo for the hair after your dip.
Rexona Soap and Rexona, the Rapid Healer, in its dainty pot, should stand on the
toilet table of all who indulge in outdoor sports.

THE 1925 MECCANO
-new parts - more models - more fUnt
So many new parts have been added to the Meccano system,
and the instructions have been made so clear, that it is now quite
easy to tackle the largest model. A splendid Revolving Crane like
that illustrated below, for instance —a wonderful structure of shining
steel and polished brass—ever so simple to build. This is only one
of the models you can build with Meccano; however, there are
hundreds of others illustrated in the Manuals of Instruction and
they all work.
If you haven’t a Meccano Outfit see that you get one this
Christmas. Talk to Dad about it to-night. If you already have
Meccano, ask for some of the new parts for
Christmas, and you will be able to build bigger
and better models than you have ever built
before.

The Auction Sale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
i.
|npj HE dusty windows to the yellow street
Look down with pale blind eyes that
speak no cheer;
Only a red flag calls to passing feet
To loiter, for a wealth of loot is here.
Loot to divide and spoil of every land
Hangs round the walls and makes a narrow
space
About the littei-ed wonder of the stand
Where color leaps on color and the face
Of a pale Parian goddess, cobweb-tressed,
Smiles over broken Derby and green jade.
Here Birmingham against old India pressed
Flouts art with cheapness; and things
German-made,
Dragged from the dust that ten years hid
their sin,
Challenge the prize of some lost mandarin.
11.
Now rises in his pi-ide the auctioneer,
Smiles solemnly o’er solemn faces bowed;
And, in the strident voice to dealers dear,
Reads out the sale conditions to the crowd.
Up goes a lot, held high that till may see.
A pi-ice is named. The clamorous tongue
repeats
Fast rising numbers from the nods of three
Old dealer-women spread in faded seats.
The hammer falls. Ten shillings buys the lot
Of pewter “brassware” used to break the
ice.
A jug at half a crown falls on the spot,
Its cracked blue lustre dear at any price.
And, sadly languid, the di-ooped raidei-s wait
The chance to lift their eyes and test their
fate!
hi.
Lacquer and bronze, a painting, tapestry,
China of Staffordshire that might be Bow,
Limoges and Dresden, and a set of three
Gild wooden images in one squat row,
Sold with all faults and virtues they possess,
Keep the bids moving. Now, a chance at
last!
How many here that small bowl’s worth will
guess?
Six eyes upon the fadeless green are cast,
Six eyes that doubt and gaze and hesitate.
The bids mount slowly. “Going at a
pound!”
The clamorous repetition will not wait.
Another nod. Another. Then the sound
Of the dull wooden hammer upon wood —
The buyer smiles, and knows his bargain
good!
TV.
But here is something better; and no doubt
Hangs on its dusty fame. The mark is
clear.
The fat assistant hands the thing about,
While smiles, like garlands, wreathe the
auctioneer.
He pauses, readies up some ancient jest—
No need to hurry bids for such a prize—
Then rises with his hammer to the test
And catches glints of fire in twenty eyes.
Ten bobbing heads begin the worldess fight—-
Only the umpire makes the needed noise. . .
Eight bidders cease, but still with glances
light
Two eager faces watch the hammer poise;
And “Going going!”-—one head does not
stir—
“ Mr. Collector! It’s a bai-gain, sir !”
V.
I know not out of what strange homes they
came
In many sundered lands, these varied
wares,
What dust of what dead years may be to
blame
For the rich tarnish that enamel bears,
What breath of lovely women, speaking love,
Moistened the air to make that copper
green,
Or whether, stooping that blue cup above,
There paused a. village fishwife or a queen ;
But I can guess the light in other eyes,
Where siantinig sunlight fell along the
floor,
When skilled artificers fondling their prize
Touched a fine point to add one merit
more.
And these, perhaps, are more than satisfied
In pride of dust to dream of dusty pride.

DAVID McKEE WEIGHT.
The Joys of Gold.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A MAN always knows what a woman
J\ ■ , , . „ i i i x)
is going to do next, concluded Bar-
ney. “But the trouble is to get her
to do it.”
The epigram was merely intended to round
off the latest club-yarn which he had been
telling me, and the whimsical twist was char-
acteristic .f Bar»e y . It was this which gave
suc-h pleasant piquancy to the seemingly
endless supply of his fictitious experiences.
At least we generally assumed they were lie-
titious, because his tone of raillery rather
belied his sentiments, though at times I found
myself wondering if this were a protective
a ■ j, ,
pose, a camouflage for possibly intense emo-
tions. Or perhaps it was that irrepressible
Australian tendency which, one imagines,
would beget jokes about ice-cream sundaes in
the tropics of Eternity.
111 any case, Barney was an interesting
talker. He could always bo depended upon
for a little freshness of phrase, and under
his control even a platitude would frequently
skid round the corner of absurdity in quite
an exciting manner. Also lie had the peculiar
smile of the Australian—a smile that seemed
to be lounging indolently against his eye-
lashes, a quiet, lazy smile, but a charming
one, especially, I should imagine, from the
point of view of the ladies. That is why I
am still wondering how much truth, if any,
there may have been in the story he told
Fred Silvan.
It was just as he had made his epigram-
matic pronouncement thajt Silvan strolled
into the wine-bar where we were seated. I
beckoned him across and introduced the
two. . _
“Unusual name, Silvan !”. commented Bar-
ney, and glancing at Fred’s greying hair, and
probably making a quick calculation of the
passage of years, he asked: “By the way,
you’re not Silvan, the Silvery Tenor used
to sing on Rickards’ some years ago—are
you?”
“Same,” admitted Fred. “But I’ve mended
my ways since then—become a mercenary
follower o.f commerce; given up the silvery
tenor for the golden tenner, only they’re all
paper nowadays. Good while since I sang
on Rickards’ —must be about 15 years.”
“About that,” agreed Barney. “I was
just thirty when I heard you. I remember
because one of your confounded songs caused
me the second great disappointment of my
life; spoiled my journey, so to speak, just
as I was about to embark for paradise—
earthly paradise, of course. The lady can-
celled the tickets.”
“I did sing some rotten songs at times,”
Fred apologised.
“Yes,” said Barney, “especially that maud-
lin mid-Victorian piece of mush called”
Laughingly Fred intercepted him: “Called
‘The Joys of Gold.’ ”
“That was it,” responded Barney. “And
the darn thing used to pack the house.”
“But how did the second disappointment
come into it?” asked Silvan.
“Well, to begin with, it was a direct result
of the first,” explained Barney. “And the
first disappointment, naturally, was my mar-
riage.” . „
“That goes without saying, remarked
Fred.
“It usually does,” admitted Barney, “but
mine did not. It didn’t go at all. The only
product of the union was that well-known
infant Incompatibility. The brat grew apace.
Thrived of its own volition —no need for
patent milks and such things, like mere
human kids. And it didn’t favor either of
its parents. It was carried unanimously. I
doubt if the world ever saw incompatibility
so mutual as ours. It became almost a
hobby with us.”
“If only it had gone on,” I interrupted,
“it might have constituted such a bond of
sympathy between you that the marriage
would have become a really happy one.”
“Fact was it had almost reached that
stage,” Barney replied. “But the course of
true hate never did run smooth, and about
that time we met the Vaines. Percy Vaine
himself was a dull, uninteresting fellow, a
conceited, self-confident fellow, thoroughly
unpleasant, with a fancy that all women
were crazy for him. My dislike for him gave
me all the more sympathy for his wife,
Phyllis. Wonderful little girl. Phyllis.
Beautiful as a divorcee, and as fascinating.
I told her so. That was when she suggested
divorce publicity as a horrid possibility. I
told her she was simply wasting her time in
the obscurity of matrimony. Her sphere
was the columns of the daily press. As I
say, I was infatuated. I used to dream of
her, and every time that squawking little
brat Incompatibility ran through the house
I would think how different it would have
been had I met Phyllis first, how different
it still could be if only Phyllis would pluck
up courage.”
He sipped his marsala reflectively and con-
tinued :
“You see, her own marriage was not
exactly happy. I pointed this out to her. I
pointed it out that I was not merely unhappy
but utterly miserable. I pictured to her how
together we could make the earth a paradise.
At last, one evening, when she had slipped
quietly into the office to tell me she feared
hex-self, and that we must never see each other
again, she let me kiss her. Just one good-
bye kiss. And then the gates of paradise were
ajar.”
He hesitated, and apologetically held the
narrative aside to remark:
“Somehow it seems hardly right to be tell-
ing of the incident, but you'll appreciate the
confidence.” Fred Silvan nodded sympatheti-
cally, and Barney, as though instantly
repenting his moment of sentiment, con-
tinued whimsically: “Of course, don’t for a
moment misunderstand me. My intentions
towards the lady were sti-ictly dishonorable.”
“Naturally,” agreed Fred as he caught the
mischief dancing in Barney’s eyes.
“After that first embrace,” resumed Bar-
ney, “I made somewhat better progress along
the first side at least of the eternal triangle.
Phyllis did not repulse my pleadings. She
listened while I told her how much greater
was my love for her than her husband's
could possibly be. She even listened while
I said that, though I knew she would never
consider such a thing, still I was much
wealthier than Percy, and could therefore
lavish on her the dresses her beauty merited.
At that she implored me to say no more.
She was helpless. A love so divine as ours
could not be denied. She would come to me
the following evening. She was mine—or
she would be then.”.
He sipped a little marsala and reverie be-
fore resuming.
“Next evening Phyllis arrived strictly on
time, and announced that her courage had
failed her. She could never face the pos-
sible publicity—l must forget her. As I
said before, a man always knows what a
woman will do next. The trouble is to get
her to do it. I suggested that, anyway, we
might have dinner together—no harm in that —
just to talk it over. She capitulated. We
had turned the first corner, as it were, of
the eternal triangle. After dinner she agreed
that we might have one last evening together
—no harm in that —at the theatre. We
then could part, if part we must, with a
memory of bright lights, of music and a few
hours of congenial company, of hinted
ecstasy. She capitulated. We went to the
only decent show on —Rickards’. There
was no fear of being seen, because Percy, the
dull, undeserving dog, had been called out
of town, and my wife had been quite relieved
when I had told her that I would be de-
tained at the office. She had been intending,
in any case, she explained, to stay the night
at her mother’s.”
“Good old office!” ejaculated Fred Silvan.
“Yes,” concurred Barney, “overtime covers
a multitude of sins. But I had not exactly
lied. Phyllis did keep me working overtime,
or at least my wits, to get even that far
round the eternal triangle aforesaid, and I
began to think the triangle really was eter-
nal. At the theatre the exhilaration of the

Holiday Mishaps
SUPPOSE during the holidays you, or one of your
family, meet with an accident! You are miles
from a doctor or a chemist! What are you going to
do? If you are wise you will prepare for all such
emergencies by having a box of ever-ready Zam-Buk
with you.
As a “first-aid” there is nothing to compare with
Zam-Buk —nothing else will end pain, stop bleed-
ing, or draw out soreness so quickly. There’s such
,safety and certainty in Zam-Buk that it is well
described as “The Safety First Healer.” It soothes,
purifies and heals quickly and cleanly, and prevents
injuries festering and going “the wrong way.”
. Again, you never need have a holiday spoiled by
the tortures of sunburn, heat spots, rashes or swellings
if you have Zam-Buk at hand. It cools a fiery sun-burnt
skin, ends the tingling, smarting sensation, allays the
soreness, and prevents blistering. Zam-Buk is equally
good as a remedy for sore feet, mosquito bites, cuts,

bruises, sprains, strains, and all skin
injuries, sores and eruptions.
Don’t forget to include, then, a
box of Zam-Buk among the holiday necessities.
Nothing else can do the same good or have the
tame wide range of usefulness.
A Daily Need

gala atmosphere soon had an effect, and
Phyllis's reserve fell from her like an opera-
cloak. She slipped her hand into mine and
caressingly held it. Thrills! Never mind !
She snuggled closer to me, and at the first
black-out lifted her lips to mine, kissed me
for fully five bars of the music—she even
included the grace notes in that kiss —and
as the lights came on again she whispered
that she could no longer resist me or herself
—she was mine. The second corner of the
triangle had been turned, the gates of para-
dise were wide, and all now required was a
good skid round the third corner; then para-
dise, divorce and home, sweet home with
Phyllis.”
Turning from Fred Silvan, whom he had
chiefly been addressing, Barney looked rue-
fully at me and continued :
“Then came this blighter’s turn —-Silvan,
the Silvery Tenor, with his sentimental dam’
ballad, ‘The Joys of Gold.’ I did not at
first realise the ghastly possibilities of it.
His voice was fine; he sang nicely, affect-
ingly. But as the theme unfolded itself
Phyllis gradually wilted. When he came to
the sloppy couplet:
The tempter came, his story told.
She left me for the joys of gold,
Phyllis was shrinking as far from me as
the chairs would allow. What I had mis-
taken for an aurora of love had been merely
the glint, of the footlights on a stage glacier,
and her voice was harsh as she muttered:
‘No, I couldn’t now. I couldn’t now. I
couldn’t leave Percy after that song. Take
me home!’ It was plain that the tickets
to paradise were cancelled, the infernal
triangle was shattered hopelessly at the third
corner. I took her home, but I was not so
much an escort as a sort of hovering unwel-
comeness. You could have floated a refrig-
erating company on the sound of her voice
as she said good-bye. And all through your
blasted ballad.”
The last sentence was specially for Silvan,
and _was delivered with a friendly grin. After
a slight pause Barney resumed :
“There was an unexpected sequel. Percy
had left her that night—run off with another
woman. When I heard of this I hurried
along to her. That was the next day. But
she upbraided me badly—said she was the
most undeserving woman in the world, and
that I had caused her to lose the best hus-
band on earth ; she realised that now it was
too late. In the end she screamed hysteri-
cally : ‘Get out of my sight.’ And I got.”
Fred Silvan made the obvious rejoinder:
“Whereupon you went back to your wife,
and the hobby of Incompatibility flourished
exceedingly so that you lived happily ever
after.”
“Well, no!” replied Barney. “Y r ou roe.
my wife was tin* woman who had run off
with Phyllis’s husband, though what on earth
she could see in Percy”
Barney left us shortly after on a, business
appointment, and I explained to Fred Silvan
that the only flaw in the intriguing incident
was the fact that Barney had never been
married. .

Little Travel Tales
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
HE was little and old as old. His black
eyes glittered like onyx under the
V-shaped brows; his skin was dead-
white, his lips a scarlet thread.
For five years he lived aboard the s.s. Bur-
man on the Africa-fo-England run. In all
that time he scarcely spoke ; when he needed
anything he wrote in a queer cramped hand
on a scrap of paper and handed it to a
steward. He never left the ship. The com-
pany saw to it that he w r as not a refugee
nor a “wanted” nor mad.
All day long he sat in his cabin writing,
always writing; yet he. posted no letters.
Each night wflien the other passengers were
seated at dinner he crept, cat-quiet, to his
far corner of the saloon. Seated, he bow T ed
to the captain, then leisurely he drew from
his hands a pair of crimson silk gloves, dis-
playing long pallid fingers crinkled to their
tips with rings of gorgeous rose diamonds
set in vivid green-gold.
A morsel of fruit, bread and a glass of
white wine made bis meal. For a while he
sat apparently deep in contemplation; then
slowly he drew on his gloves, and crept
again to his cabin.
Thus for five years: then one dark night
he went ashore in Durban and never Came
back.
There w r as a woman in the ship. She had
eyes blue as delphiniums in the spring, and
hair the color of marigolds. Her profile was
irreproachable. All this made for loveliness.
Yet against it was her squat, solid shape
on feet that looked too little; a voice like
a peacock’s screech; pudgy red hands over-
ringed wflth emeralds.
She was disconcerting from the first.
Accompanied by a ‘ bodyguard of servants
she came aboard at a sunstraked little port
in Borneo w.ith a deck-load of trunks. Wife
to a rajah’s liorsetrainer. Her frocks
exuded Paris; her emeralds were so rare
that she feared to take them off. The sim-
plest thing about her was her wedding-ring.
She was rude to everyone, as the over-rich
have their chance to be.
Three nights out from Singapore we were
waked by blood-curdling screeches, and the
Begum (ship-christened) rushed into the
alleyway with her hands all hacked and
bleeding, and blood streaming from her ears
and face. A Malay had crept into her cabin
through the big porthole and crushed a
drugged cushion over her head ; thinking her
smothered, lie tore the emeralds from her
ears and hands. One ring staying stub-
bornly on ; he took his knife and hacked at
the poor pudgy fingers. The sharp pain
roused her, and she shrieked.
The Dutch captain had the ship’s com-
pany lined up, and lie and the hoffmeister
went down the line feeling the hands of them
all. The native with the coldest fingers was
handcuffed and taken away. “But why?”
one asked. Cold hands proved them lately
washed. The culprit confessed.
Three moons later the Begum yelled her
peacock-screech laugh as she saw him hanged.

The tropic sun slanted in through the gun-
boat’s red-and-green-striped awning and lin-
gered caressingly on the face of the Bishop’s
beautiful sister. Beautiful in spite of her
hats; and so good that when the comet turned
in its orbit and we all got up to see, she
clad herself completely to her gloves and
tightly tied-on veil.
a She lectured on prohibition.
The Dutch gunboat had put in unex-
pectedly and asked us off to tea. Delight-
ful hosts, these Hollanders. They came for
us in whaleboats towed by launches, with
purple velvet billowing over the water to
keep the spray away. There were ices and
gin-pites for the men, and all the rest of it.
One drink we quite liked: it was one of
those simple fruit-things the Dutch do so
well. Apricot juice, maybe,, with a cherry,
red as the Bishop’s sister’s beautiful rod
lips, floating languorously through the amber,

In the blue deeps of Torres btrait there
rests many an unknown ship. Old Santiago
Simplicio, the Mamlaman diver, tells of one
built of wood with three great, high-rising
decks that would seem to be a Spanish gal-
loon. There is a bell on its poop, and shapes
in armor lie,about the decks. It is a ghost
ship, says Santiago, and must stay there till
the Resurrection; no one may board it and
come away alive. That, is . ?■ '’*■

Lau Lu Ivee, having amassed a competency,
was returning to his land, as behoves a man
of China. When his ship, the Tsinan, reached
Thursday Island, lie went ashore and drank
deep; and when the tropic night rose up in
all its glorv he set out to board his ship,
On the narrow plank he swayed five times:
the sixth, being a hairbreadth too much, lie
lunged over and pitched headlong into the
swirling tide-rip.
His countrymen offered big moneys for liis
remains. How could a man of China sleep
unless amongst his ancestors? Also, word
flashed round the island that he had worn a
belt stuffed with gold sovereigns. Soldier
A set out his shark-lines each sunset.
Many sharks he caught, but none of much
account. And then, one evening as the Red
Star rose between two peaks, he hooked a
giant', In its belly lay a man’s leg and part
of a leather belt, empty ! That night in the
iittle beach-pub Soldier A—— drank very
deep. Said he couldn’t get the look in that
shark's eyes out of his head.
No doubt, said the Island, it was the devil
(ghost) of that shark which took A— him-
self in three feet of water seven sunsets later.
Madame, the missionary’s wife, had gold-
backed brushes.
When she and he came across from their
Outer Isle in their power-launch, with two
maids to attend on Madame, and took the
best rooms in the little Island hotel, with
the gold-backed brushes, well displayed, it
took the sheller-wives rather on the raw.
Shell was down, and all the world was grey.
.\ow r , the Anglican and Roman Catholic
missionaries never ride roughshod over
native belief. They, for instance, turn that
unholy rite, the giving of the firstfruits to
the Yam God, into a decent and in-order
Harvest Thanksgiving. The drum they in-
troduce into the church service. And so on.
This missionary and his madame were an-
other kind. On their Outer Isle they reigned
supreme. Their station reared itself in the
shadow of a humpbacked hill that was the
resting-place of an age-long belief. Beneath
its strange crouched shape slept an Island
god. He who made earthquakes.
When Madame required her garden en-
larged she just told the mamoose to get it
done. He protested that the god would be
angered if waked. “Don’t you dare to talk
that wickedness to me. Get it done!’ she
shrieked. The mamoose, still protesting,
set his prisoners unwillingly to work. The
undergrowth was heavy, and required much
adzing and many fires for burning off. No
Island god approves of fires, he being the
fire chief.
That night the god waked. He spat great
stones. Three were cast on the roof of the
mission station and stove it in.
In escaping, Madame lost both her gold
brushes.

In Papua, as in Africa, there are usually
tales of white dwarfs and men with tails.
Ai-hc-ho, of the Western Division Police,
told me of a tribe lie personally came across
on the side of a mountain. Their village
houses wei’O built high up on 12ft. poles.
The floors were full of holes, so that the
tails of the tribe could hang through, “And
we crept into the village one very dark night
and tied knots in their tails that were hang-
ing through the holes, so that they couldn’t
get away. They did squeal!” He smiled
reminiscently. “But how do you know' that
they were really tails?” I asked. Cannibal-
ism in Papua is an indictable offence; so
Ai-he-ho looked carefully about to see that no
one was listening. Then he whispered: “I
know, because I ate them.”

THE
“ATCO”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.

“Colder than Ice!”
\ • ' •" *’ 1 ; . .' ' 1 ■ ■ • ,
The modern way of keeping foods for
long periods and in a state of > perfect
preservation, safe from contamination is the
RELVINATOR
a fully automatic refrigerator which eliminates ice worries and saves money.
WHAT IS
KELVINATOR?
KELVINATOR is an
unobtrusive little
• machine which does
away with the neces-
sity for ice. Placed in
any position out of
the way, it keeps the
temperature of the
ice-chest at a uni-
form degree of cold
day and night. It
works itself, and re-
quires no looking
after or adjusting.
“Colder than Ice
and never melts.”

WHAT ARE KELVINATED FOODS?
KELVINATED foods are foods that have been kept for some time in the frosty, dry
cold produced by Kelvinator electric refrigeration. Under the influence of this dry
cold they undergo a remarkable change.
Meats become mellow, tender and flavory. Green vegetables “crisp up” until they
are as fresh as when the dew was still on them. All foods stay as wholesome and
appetising as when they were carefully selected.
Then, too, you can prepare dainty sherbets, ices and other desserts without using
ice. Or you can freeze sparkling cubes of ice, either clear or' colored, just the right
size for chilling beverages. Kelvinated fruits and fruit salads are other delicacies
easily prepared.
HOW DOES IT KEEP AND IMPROVE FOODS?
Few persons know that there is a certain kind of refrigeration that not only keeps
foods a long time, but actually improves them. This is refrigeration with air that is
not only very cold, but dry and frosty as well.
This zone of dry, uniform, intense cold is the Zone of Kelvination, and is produced
by Kelvinator Electric Refrigeration.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN THE HOME ?
It means convenience, cleanliness, good food all the time, saved money, and the
finishing touch to the well-appointed home. It is not a cheap article, but its cost
will be the best investment you have ever made for proper living conditions.
WILL IT GIVE ME ICE IF WANTED ?
In the freezing trays you can make more ice than you can use, if you want it. Ice-
cream, too, and numbers of frozen dainties.
It costs nothing to inquire about it!
You have only to post the Coupon.
