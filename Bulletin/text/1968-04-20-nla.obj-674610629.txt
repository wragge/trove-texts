This bin is a different kind of plastics pro-
duct. It’s made out of Hostalen high density
polyethylene, the raw material that is changing
plastics for the better.
Products made out of Hostalen are virtually
unbreakable, unaffected by boiling water,
rigid, hygienic and easy to clean.
The manufacturer who makes his products
out of Hostalen wants to give you the best
and so does the shop that sells them.
So it’s worth looking for the label that
says “made from Hostalen”.

One of the fast strongholds of the
vine in the suburbs ofAdelaide
Elbowed aside by an expanding city
population, many valuable vineyards
that sat in Adelaide’s foothills have
long fallen to new suburbs. But
Modbury Estate has stood its hal-
lowed ground, on the lower western
slopes of Mount Lofty only 12 miles
north of the city and about the same
distance east of the coast. The
climate is temperate. A little higher
and the vines would be subjected to
the extreme cold of the range. A little
lower and they would encounter the
extremely hot conditions prevailing
during summer on the nearby plains.
In this comfortable hammock be-
tween hill and plain, the 561 acres of
Modbury Estate vineyards follow
gently contoured slopes some 550 to
700 feet above sea level. It’s no
wonder that people want to build
houses and live here, (you need a
street-map to find it, not a road map),
but Wynns have resisted the des-
truction of their precious vines.

Reluctant millionaires:
A property developer has called them
"reluctant millionaires” but they call
themselves “Winegrowers” ... a
description they have adopted which
is distinct from ‘winemakers’, ‘vint-
ners’ or ‘vignerons’. It appropriately
describes them as people who pro-
duce wines from grapes of their own
growing.
Contour planting:
Because this is one of the largest ‘dry
area’ vineyards in Australia, soils are
doubly important at Modbury Estate.
So to make maximum use of variable
rain, Wynns have reconstructed and
replanted the original square plan
vineyard. Since 1947 all plantings
have been on newly contoured slopes.
This conserves 25% more moisture,
together with irreplaceable top-soils
that were previously washed away
and lost forever on the undulating
terrain. These soils are the heart and
soul of Wynn’s high quality white
wines. Red loam over various forms
of limestone sub-soils; chocolate loam
over quartzite rock, slate schists and
ironstone gravel. With a ‘Wine-
grower’s’ skill and experience they
have planted vines that are best
suited to these soils pedro, shiraz,
semilion, Rhine riesling, palomino,
white hermitage, cinsaut, mataro,
grenache, doradillo.
The limestone soil is reserved for
Sweet and Dry Sherries, under the
Romalo label; the quartzite for the
light table wines under the Modbury
Estate label.
The unique grape variety, Cinsaut
(pronounced san-so ), is cultivated ex-
tensively at Modbury Estate. Of the
total 174 tons of this variety processed
to wine in the whole of Australia in
1967, 132 tons were grown at Mod-
bury Estate. Wynns now make a rose
from this variety which is picked
early for lively acidity and the free-
run juice is quickly separated from
the skins to give light colour and
tannin. This wine is sold under the
brand name of WYNNS ESTATE
CINSAUT rose:
Wynns take pains
to crush . . . not press:
This is a unique aspect of Wynn
winemaking technique. They stress
that pressings tend to coarsen the
wine, so they use only the high
quality juice that runs freely from
the crushed grape.
From such gentle and painstaking
processes come:
Wynns Modbury Estate • Riesling
• White Burgundy
• Semilion (Sauternes) • Moselle.
Mark the name ‘Modbury Estate’,
it’s a Wynn trademark. These wines
are not available everywhere but are
well worth seeking out.
This account of Wynns Modbury
Estate is only a small part of a story
which will be continued as a series;
we hope it will add yet another
dimension to your appreciation of
Wynns Estate Wines.

MAN FOR THE JOB
ONE OF OUR regular contributors,
Mr. Ross Campbell, has been appointed
to the N.S.W. Advisory Committee on
Publications, which came out of the
recent Obscene and Indecent Publica-
tions Act.
In a recent piece Mr. Campbell
found himself standing in tears amid
the alien porn. He pointed out that
Australia’s pornography industry was
still struggling to establish itself.
“What,” he asked, “will its hopes of
survival be if the floodgates are thrown
open to unfair overseas competition?”
We are pleased that Mr. Campbell
got his appointment in spite of this
tendency to treat a serious subject
lightly; in our more optimistic moments
we feel he might have got the job be-
cause of it.
BACKWARD GLANCE
WE READ a piece by a former Syd-
ney artist and critic, Robert Hughes, in
the London “Spectator”on why he left
Australia and why he stays away. Mr.
Hughes writes that 1964, the very year
he left, was “the last year of Aus-
tralia’s political virginity,” when we
stopped thinking about Asia as the
Far East and realised it was the Near
North; in 1939 Sir Robert Menzies,
not necessarily the most forward-look-
ing Australian, had begun thinking and
talking of it as the Near North.
We hear now that entertainer Barry
Humphries will be returning here once
Humphries ... returning
more this year. In preparation, he is
already writing whimsical letters to
the Melbourne “Age” about a new
housing development, Wattle Park, with
a view of the Dandenongs. A more
elaborate preparation is an exhibition
of murals.
“I hope,” he tells us, “you will see
the great artifact which will make
Napier Waller’s epic work in the Myer
Mural Hall and Michelangelo’s Sistine
Chapel appear as minor works. It will
contain all the beloved old things, the
Saunders Malt Baby, the Pelaco Mine
Tinkit it Fit man, the Skipping Vine-
gar Girl, and, of course, Dr. Morse of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pill fame,
plus some charming studies of the
Pyjama Girl.”
Both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Humph-
ries, each in his own way, cling to an
Australia which no longer exists; at
least Mr- Hughes keeps his a decent
12,000 miles away.
UNDER BOND
SOMETIMES the inconsistencies of
censorship are more than ordinarily
baffling. Consider the case of English
writer Edward Bond: he wrote the
scenario for Antonioni’s “Blow Up,” a
film which didn’t trouble the censor in
England but which had one whole
sequence scissored from it in Australia;
his play “Saved” was refused a licence
for public performance in London un-
less he made cuts, but the unexpurgated
version is about to have a production
in Sydney.
Britain’s Lord Chamberlain objected
particularly to one scene in “Saved”
which has a group of young toughs
stone a baby to death in its pram. The
play was restricted to a short season
of Sunday-night “club” performances
at London’s Royal Court theatre in
1965. In Sydney it will be shown, baby
stoning and all, to anyone who cares to
buy a ticket. Aarne Neeme, a student
member of the University of New
South Wales Dramatic Society, is
preparing an uncut production due to
open at Sydney University’s Union
Theatre on April 24. “We haven’t sub-
mitted the play to any local
authorities,” he says. “As far as I’m
concerned, it is a first-rate work which
shows, in brilliant Chekhovian terms,
the problem of moral illiteracy.” Mr.
Bond, 32, has written two other plays
—“The Pope’s Wedding,” in 1962, and
“Early Morning,” a recent work which
depicts Queen Victoria as a lesbian
and which last week drew a total
ban from the Lord Chamberlain’s
office.
Bond claims the Lord Chamberlain
robs him of every cent he might earn
from the theatre in Britain but collects
regular royalties from Continental pro-
ductions of “Saved.” He earns the bulk
of his living as a screen-writer; finds
the film censor only marginally more
permissive than the Lord Chamberlain.
“You can put more sex in films but
only as titillation,” he says. “You can-
not tell the truth about society. Why
they got so worried about a shot of a
naked woman looking at herself in the
mirror I can’t imagine. One day I
hope to find the ideal film heroine for
them — a girl with no nipples and
no pubic hair.”
BURSTING OUT OF TASMANIA
TONY WOODS, who has just had an
exhibition at the Bonython Galleries in
Sydney, is one of this year’s Harkness
fellows. At 27, he is the youngest-ever
winner. Many of Woods’ fellow-
Tasmanians will probably be very glad
to see him go on his scholarship to the
United States, although their reasons
may differ.
In Hobart, where the 120,000-odd
people tend to live in one another’s
pockets (how many can be expected
to tread the arts measure in a popula-
tion that is less than many suburbs in
mainland cities?), the careless mention
of Tony Woods’ name can liven up a
party in a way matched only by the
innocent newcomer delightedly telling
of coming on record in the early history
of Hobart of one or other of the landed
families.
The first time Woods slightly upset
Hobart was in 1965, when his Honor
Mr. Justice Gibson opened a Woods’
exhibition a short time after the Police
Department had visited the gallery in
response to a report that the exhibition,
which included life-size male nudes, was
worth the attention of the police. His
Honor, it was reported, spoke rather
well on the occasion. He didn’t mention
the paintings, but said some things
about art in general, and left right
afterwards.

winner of the Archibald prize, Tas-

manian painters today tend toward
watercolor; it is watercolor country.
Woods was happy enough to go along
with this until his first (and last) joint
exhibition with the Tasmanian Group.
The exhibitors, including Woods,
hung their work and .went. home. Bqt
Woods came back. On his gentle pastel
riverscapes and landscapes he stuck 1
cut-out paper nude figures. Oi\ one
there was a man and a woman almost
covering the glass in front of the paint-
ing.
The other artists were quite properly
irate when they came next day and
saw Woods’ paintings. But even at this
exhibition Woods sold. No longer to the
Governor of Tasmania or to the
fashionable people of Sandy Bay, but
to a man whose taste in art Hobartians
are timid to question: Lord Talbot of
Malahide, who lives at Fingal. Lord
Talbot bought a watercolor of beach,
hills, and rocks with the cut-out paper
figure of a woman sitting on a rock
and a man watching her.
Up to now Kym Bonython has been
Woods’ weightiest patron. “I’ve got
every confidence in and admiration for
the work Tony Woods does,” Bonython
says. “He is quite unique. Not only has
he chosen to live away from the estab-
lished art centres and is not moved by
other painters, but he’ll literally starve
himself to get paint and canvas.”
Bonython showed. Woods’ work at the
1966 Adelaide Arts Festival. He thinks
he will become established as a figura-
tive painter.
With the Harkness, Woods will make
his assault on the big, outside world
next August. He planned to go years
ago. He worked shiftwork and night
stints to get the money together. Then
he left the job and used the money
to keep himself while he painted.
A year ago he was painting massive
figures in cages, men exuding their
own bars; Mrs. Hobart looking blankly
at a black man behind bars that were
her bars, too. Today he is painting his
friends, young, unlined faces, boys
immature, and girls lovely; girls and
boys relaxed, going nowhere, doing
nothing; a girl alert, waiting; a boy
afraid of himself.

apricots, they take little nibbles out
of apricots, but best of all they just
pelt each other with fruit until there
is not one left on the tree.
And, of course, the adorable creatures
are fond of humans. They hate to be
too far away, so they live up in the
ceiling. At first you hear them at about
3 a.m., a gentle scratching noise. This
is terrifying, it sounds like someone
jemmying their way in. But later this
is nothing. Possums are capable of great
gorilla like grunts and sonorous deep
breathing noises. Some of them seem
to cough and suffer from asthma giv-
ing off terrible wheezes. You feel like
offering some of Dr. Mac’s bronchitis
cure.
As said earlier, these possums are
friendly. One night while we were hav-
ing guests a large male possum trotted
down our hall, looked into the living-
room, more or less said “good eve-
ning,” then trotted on. Then a friend
of ours reported that he felt something
warm in his bed. He reached down
and it was nothing more inviting than
a large possum. It refused to move
until finally he picked it up and threw
it out the window, whereupon that pos-
sum, offended, furious, sat on the
windowsill and spat at him.
Possums are common all round Aus-
tralia, but we would submit that Mel-
bourne is the possum capital of the
world. In this city they exist in hundreds
of thousands. But the point is they are
protected by law. It is a fearful crime
to kill a possum. You can knock a
fellow down with a bottle in Hoddle
Street and probably escape with a $5
fine, but possums are much nicer than
humans. Here the fine is $2OO or six
months or both.
So citizens go ratty trying to solve
their possum problems. A friend of ours
had a superb idea. She knew the possum
was in the chimney, so one night she
laid a trail of apple, from the chimney
right out through the front door, which
she left just ajar. Possums will eat any-
thing at all, including anything your
trees like to bear, but they are partic-
ularly devoted to apple.
The trail was laid and she waited.
Next morning instead of having one
she had two. Then another friend of
ours traps the possums and dumps
elsewhere, but they are so devoted to
the establishment somehow they keep
coming back. At last he is beyond all
reason. He doesn’t care if they give him
life in Pentridge. Coburg is not good
possum country and the chances are he
would sleep in peace. So now he catches
his possums, takes them in the cage
out to the back garden, and a real
Bonnie and Clyde execution takes
place. He starts up the car to muffle
the noise, takes out his .22 rifle, and
bang, bang.
Your correspondent went to interview
a genuine possum catcher, Mr. Herbert
Tippett of Possum Control, Clifton Hill.
One learned from him that possums
really preferred the nice suburbs. There
was barely a possum in places like
Williamstown, Pascoe Vale, and Altona.
The good possum suburbs were Toorak,
South Yarra, Kew, Camberwell, Mal-
vern, Caulfield, and right round the
Bayside through Beaumaris to Frank-
ston. Possums preferred the well-heeled
suburbs. No doubt this was because here
they found a better class of tree and
a better class of attic.
So how did Mr. Tippett cope with
the problem. “I do a very good job,”
he said, “and guarantee a place for
ten years. What you got to do is seal
a roof. So that a possum can’t get in
or out. Now some of these big buck
“If the RSL has its way we'll soon have
a housing shortage!”
possums grow to several feet long, but
they’ve got very small skulls and they
can get through a hole the size of a
cricket ball.
“And they are intelligent. I remem-
ber a doctor out at Kew thought his
place was possum proof, driving him
mad they were. One moonlight night
he sat up with pair of binoculars and
finally he saw the possum family come
home. He swears this is true. He sighted
on top of the chimney a young possum
lift the flap so that it’s mother and the
young possums could get inside. Then
the mother, when she was in, held the
flap open for the other young feller.”
Mr. Tippett uses a wire cage with an
apple on a hook inside. When the pos-
sum grabs the apple it releases the catch
and the spring door, and the possum
is trapped. What then does Mr. Tippett
do? He does what he is obliged to do
by law, and all other possum catchers
do the same he releases his possum
a mile or so down the road.
So the Malvern possums are released
into Toorak, and the Toorak possums
are released into Malvern. The Kew
possums are released into Camberwell,
and the Camberwell possums are re-
leased into Kew. There used to be a
dream, several years back, that possums
would never cross the river. So if you
caught a possum you speedily took him
over the other side of the Yarra. This
came to an end one evening when a
gentleman from Ivanhoe was rowing
some possums across to Kew when he
noticed a gentleman from Kew rowing
some possums across to Ivanhoe. Oh,
Melbourne possums get to know each
other very well. They move around
like Rotarians.
Mr. Tippett says his worst possum
case was at the old PLC homestead.
There were squadrons of possums up
in that ceiling and after nigh on a
century possum dung was so thick it
was no longer possible to see the rafters.
Eventually, Italian workmen took out
that dung in wheelbarrow loads.
People call him at all hours of the
day and night for possum emergencies.
At one house in Kew possums had a
lovely time galloping around the living-
room. They knocked down ornaments,
ripped curtains, scratched pictures, and
in one afternoon did $l4OO worth of
damage. And then there was the woman
who complained that a possum
awakened her every night at exactly
3 a.m. Herbert Tippett could find no
evidence of possums. Then he said,
“How do you get on with the woman
in the maisonette next door?” “No
good,” she said. Mr. Herbert finally
discovered that the lady next door got
out of bed for a few minutes every
morning at 3 a.m., then just for the
heck she gave the wall a couple of good
belts with the chamber pot.
But sadly Mr. Tippett cannot offer
any solution to our possum worries. He
says that in this city they now out-
number dogs and cats. Frankly, I think
humans need protection against the
possums.

Charles Moses, who’s in charge of
wood-chopping, says the best act
they’ve had in years was the tree-
climbing fellah: 32 seconds up and
down a 150 ft. trunk.
So, while the Colonel’s up there with
his life in one hand risking everything
to thrill the masses, it is not possible
to say that the masses appreciate the
compliment. In fact “. . . aw, c’mon,
let’s give him a hand. What about the
biggest one we’ve ever heard? C’mon,
Sydney, let’s hear it,” urges the pro-
gram announcer, selling the idea like
it’s for Queen Anne whisky. Or some-

in the world”
thing. Actually, a little something does
keep the Colonel up there longer than
his customary 15 minutes, and it is
freelance photographer John Davies,
who is fool enough to shin up this 2 Jin.
diameter pole and take pictures of the
Colonel through his fish-eye lens. If he
falls, says Bill Perrott, who lured the
Colonel to Australia for some colossal
sum, if he falls it’ll be at the back,
where there’s no one to fall on to and
kill. He wishes Seabright would hurry,
they’re gonna see some wood-chopping.
Mr. Perrott consoles himself by reading
a news item about racing-driver Jim
Clark’s death. He is always, he says,
telling millionaire Kym Bonython to
chuck up driving, but he takes no
notice.
Eventually the Colonel arrives, hav-
ing climbed down the iron ladder by
the side of the Events Today board in
Army overalls to keep his bare torso
and white tights clean, then changed
in a dark corner under the Events Board
into green brocade dressing-gown and
clogs, which, in theatrical circles, are
called slop shoes. You know, says Mr.
Perrott, allowing himself a glimmer of a
smile, to keep your pumps clean from
slops. Sure, says the Colonel in broad
Texan, sure, Sydney’s a swell place, he
is having a ball, notwithstanding Mr.
Perrott’s efforts to take him off the
straight-and-narrow with late nights and
things, eh, what, Bill? But he is looking
forward to playing to capacity-filled
audiences. Come on Easter weekend.
There is nothing like having lots of
eyes on him, as he stands on that 15in.
by 6in. platform and sways on what
Mr. Perrott calls his chrome-oily pole,
to inspire him. Today’s performance
was OK, but no more. But infinitely
better than the other night on the
ABC’s “This Day Tonight.” They built
a 10ft. pole with a cage on top and
said get up it. Why, he and Perrott just
fell about laughing. “I tell you what,
though,” says Bill Perrott, “Bill Peach’s
never been so scared in his life, he
climbed up, too.”
Marvin Seabright is 36 and has been
up the pole for 18 years. He went up
it, so to speak, straight from school
when aerialist Ben Morton sold him
the rigging. Well, he wanted to live.
So Marvin goes off to the Korean War
and returns with the rank of corporal,
which he uses for a while, but then
Ben says Colonel sounds er better.
From then on, everyone wanted Mar-
vin up the pole, from coast-to-coast
in America, in Europe, Expo 67,
everyone’s criterion of fame nowadays,
and now good old Australia. The pole’s
fare alone cost Mr. Perrott $7OO, a
fact he would rather not be reminded
of. It makes him feel sick.
While Marvin is saying he is not
bragging but his is the best circus act
in the world he offers $lOOO to
anyone who can better it, but no one’s
challenged him so far while he’s
saying this, Mrs. Seabright is the other
side of the fairground saying her pink
ticket isn’t good enough for the Mem-
bers’ Enclosure. But that’s my husband
up there, she said, pointing to Mar-
vin doing his 15deg. sway and other
blood-freezing gymnastics, but it made
no difference. Officialdom sent her to
another stand. Actually, when she met
Marvin she had no idea what he did
for a living. It was something of a
shock when he told her. Now she does
his rigging. He has fallen twice: once
when he was learning, the second time
four years later when he hung on to
the pole long enough to be rescued.
What they want to see now is some-
thing less nerve-racking, like the Easter
Show’s famous wood-chopping. Where
only two days ago one of the New
Zealand team cut through to the bone,
and this reminds manager Wally Baker
of another man whose axe went through
his calf and out the other side. “Ah,”
says Sir Charles, “but what about the
fellah who chopped his toe off and
didn’t know till he saw it on the
ground . . .?”

Doing more if
the Americans do less
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
SOME OF THOSE people who are
among the strongest supporters of our
alliance with America may also be
among its greatest enemies. This para-
dox derives from the fact that their
support for America, comes from a
down-grading (conscious or uncon-
scious) of Australian potential almost
to the point of disappearance. They see
Australia as incapable of almost any
action of its own, as a kind of non-
power that can exist only as a province
of a great power. Within their imagina-
tion there are only two real possibilities:
America looks after everything, or we
scuttle back to Australia and stick our
heads in the sand.
This attitude is not fair to Australians
and it is not fair to America. It is
unjust to Australians because it casts
us in the permanent role of a nation
of urgers and polers, in which we ex-
pect a great power to do more for the
protection of our interests than, pro-
portionate to our resources, we are pre-
pared to do ourselves. It is unjust to
America because it makes demands on
America’s unrivalled generosity, already
overstrained.
From the viewpoint of expediency it
is also extremely stupid. No one can say
to what extent America will disengage
itself from South-East Asia if some kind
of settlement is achieved in Vietnam.
But even before the present crisis it was
already obvious that Americans, if they
were going to help anybody after Viet-
nam, would only help those who do a
fair bit of self help.
Anyone who keeps a file of The
Bulletin at home should re-read the
article “Asia after Vietnam” by Rich-
ard Nixon in the issue dated October
14 last year. It is worth quoting at
length the key passages in the article,
written by the man who may be the
next President of the United States.
Mr. Nixon said: “One of the legacies
of Vietnam almost certainly will be a
deep reluctance on the part of the
United States to become involved once
again in a similar intervention on a
similar basis. The war has imposed
severe strains on the United States, not
only militarily and economically but
socially and politically as well. Bitter
dissension has torn the fabric of Ameri-
can intellectual life, and whatever the
outcome of the war the tear may be a
long time mending ... If another
friendly country should be faced with
an externally supported Communist in-
surrection . . . there is serious question
whether the American public or the
American Congress would now support
a unilateral American intervention,
even at the request of the host Gov-
ernment. This makes it vitally in their
own interest that the nations in the
path of China’s ambitions move quickly
to establish an indigenous Asian frame-
work for their own future security . . .
The role of the United States as world
policemen is likely to be limited in the
future . . . Asia today needs its own
security undertakings, reflecting the new
realities of Asian independence and
Asian needs.”
What this should mean for Austra-
lian policy is clear enough. If we want
our alliance with America to have
continued meaning, we should assist
our immediate neighbors to maintain
their own stability. It was reported
from Canberra last week that there was
dismay that on the one hand America
had put pressure on Australia to in-
volve herself more deeply in South-
East Asia (by giving money to Indo-
nesia and troops to Malaysia), while on
the other hand there were signs that
the prospect of an indefinitely con-
tinuing American military role was
diminishing. However, there is no
puzzle as to why the Americans should
ask us to get more involved while they
might be intending to get less involved.
The two things go together. They want
us to do more, because they want to
do less. What’s wrong with that?
It should be a matter for reproach
in Australia that we did not do more
to assist the British in their role in
Malaysia-Singapore. Both in their con-
duct of the counter-insurgency cam-
paign in Malaya and of the counter-
confrontation against Sukarno, the
British did an excellent job. Propor-
tionately, they put into these crises
much greater resources than Australia
and they conducted both campaigns
with great intelligence and skill.
Our own contribution to this British
effort could be described as the bare
minimum it was almost as if we
were merely helping Britain, out of
friendship, in some matter that did not
directly concern us. And at the time
when the British began to think of pull-
ing out, we did not put up anything
more of our own. Nothing. For this
reason, when they announced their de-
parture there was nothing we could say.
One word of reproach and the British
could rightly have turned on us and
told us that we were in no position to
complain.
If the Americans now say to us
that we should pick up a bit more of
the bill for Indonesia and take a few
risks in Malaysia-Singapore, how can
we argue against them? They have
risked billions of dollars in Vietnam,
and the lives of half a million men in
pursuit of a policy that we, among
others, have urged on them. Why
should they not suggest that, in pro-
portion to our population and our
wealth, we should now make something

of the same sacrifice in our own
neighborhood? Why should we expect
them to stay in South-East Asia at all
if we do not show a growing practical
obsession with it ourselves? Why, for
that matter, should we expect anyone
in the world to give a damn about Aus-
tralia if we do not give a damn about
other countries?
In any case what kind of a nation
are we likely to appear to our neighbors
if we reject their requests for assistance,
or meet them with more shadow play?
It is difficult to maintain goodwill be-
tween nations, but it would be very easy
for us to build up a tradition of bad
will that it might take many years to
eradicate. To those who compare our
economic strengths with their economic
weaknesses it can seem simply a calcu-
lated lie if we plead smallness. And
to those who understand the heroic
nature of action it can seem mere
cowardice if we refuse to act because
there is some risk in decision.
Even more important, what kind of
a nation are we likely to appear to
ourselves? Foreign policy goes beyond
rationality: in its mysteries, even
narrow calculations of self-interest can
be romantic dreams. The role a nation
plays in the world, or in a small part
of the world, is one of the most
important elements in its definition of
itself. It is one of the most significant
ways in which it can imagine what it
is, and what it is going to be. Are we
to think of ourselves as nothing but
poor whites locked up in a desert island
with no purpose other than the saving
of our own skins?
These are not problems in adminis-
trative detail but problems in imagina-
tion. Even some of Australia’s friends
in South-East Asia see us as a suburban-
minded people, incapable of extending
our horizons of the possible. If this is
a judgment on the Australian people,
it is unfair. Ordinary people cannot
make foreign policy: but they can have
a potential to create better than they
know, if political leadership releases
that potential. There is no reason to
imagine that the potential of the Aus-
tralian people is not much larger than
the present performance of the political
parties.
Political parties are oligarchies, with
their own histories. The parties are not
usually expressions of the nature of the
whole people. The nature of the whole
people is something that provides the
limits of action of the parties, but it
does not exactly determine the nature
of the parties themselves.
That it has become fashionable to
boast of Australia’s smallness is a mea-
sure of the desperation of present politi-
cal imagination. One can only hope
that out of the present chagrin of the
Government in its reaction to changes
in both British and American policy
there will later come a sharp, stimu-
lating redefinition of what it is to be
an Australian, not rejecting old friend-
ships but sealing them by greater con-
fidence in the possibility of new and
independent action.

AUSTRALIA
Australia —Japan: the continuing
McEwen crisis
AUSTRALIA’S DEVELOPING re-
lations with Japan have for long been
paraded as exciting evidence of grow-
ing involvement in Asia, and the fact
that Britain has become for us just an-
other European country. Geared into
the rapidly growing Japanese economy
by becoming its major supplier of fuel
and raw materials, we have been able
to weather the severest drought in a
generation and to spend over a billion
dollaxs on modern defence equipment
without suffering stultifying balance of
payments proble'ms.
Tied by contracts to expand the flow
of minerals, Australia’s ability to pay
its way in the world in the years ahead
is steadily being shifted from the back
of the sheep to the head of the mine.
Within three years as a result of
huge Japanese purchases minerals
'may displace wool as Australia’s num-
ber one export. Possibly within a
decade an individual mineral or metal
product may again become for Aus-
tralia what gold was in the few amaz-
ing years around the end of the 1850 s.
Visions such as these have been
commonplace, but in the past few
months they have been increasingly
muddied by what appears to be a con-
certed campaign by Trade Minister
John McEwen to discredit Japan as a
trading partner.
Statements alleging malpractices and
conspiracies among Japanese exporters
have followed one another over a
period of months, interspersed with
James Bond-type rhetoric about Can-
berra journalist Maxwell Newton, and
the generation of great concern for the
future of the Australian motor vehicle
industry. The view that all this adds
up to a deliberate campaign is based on
the following observations:
When the Customs evasion charges
were first made, it was put around by
the Trade Department that they mainly
concerned textile and chemicals im-
ports from Japan.
Initially Trade Department officials
and representatives of the closely re-
lated Associated Chambers of Manu-
factures said specifically that cars were
not involved, and that inquiries they
had made into Japanese car-pricing
showed conclusively that there was no
malpractice involved in their sale in
Australia.
Only in the last few months, when
Japanese cars have been selling par-
ticularly well, have the allegations
changed focus to concentrate on cars.
Despite the passing of many weeks
since the first allegations by Mr. Mc-
Ewen and his subsidiary Ministers for
Customs, only one specific example of
malpractice has been mentioned
and that was the trivial matter of sev-
eral dozen replacement clocks for
Mazda cars being left undeclared in
the boot of a car. None of the promised
charges have been laid, and none of the
cases brought to court.
And, despite the fact that the Govern-
John McEwen ... vague statements that inquiries are continuing
ment claims it has established that
Japanese cars are being dumped, they
continue day after day to be allowed
into Australia on the same basis as
before. (The normal procedure is that
when Customs officials have established
dumping they impose a compensatory
deposit equal to the amount of duty
being evaded.)
Yet, using the cover of parliamentary
privilege, Japanese companies and their
Australian trading associates have been
condemned in the most extravagant
language. Journalists inquiring from
time to time when concrete legal pro-
ceedings are likely to begin have re-
peatedly been brushed off with vague
statements that inquiries are still pro-
ceeding and preliminary work must be
completed. Litigation is continually six
or eight weeks away.
Last week the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” came upon the document the
Trade Department says is its major
piece of evidence for allegations of a
conspiracy to give Australian Customs
officials false information and evade
duties. The document, by its language,
is obviously a poor translation from
the Japanese and many passages look as
though they could be interpreted quite
differently if there were an original
Japanese version to check from. To
give one example, the translation speaks
of price figures being “cooked,” but
Japanese linguists say that this was most
probably a mistranslation of the word
“prepared,” a word which makes just as
good sense in the context of the sen-
tence.
It mentions adjustments to cost in-
formation about advertising and war-
ranty expenditures in Australia as
compared to Japan, but the amounts
involved are not significant and could
not be the subject of a major dumping
inquiry. The only other evidence of
note in the document is the statement
that Japanese firms were notified of the
forthcoming Customs inquiries (not by
dreaded Maxwell Newton) and that
they got together to formulate a similar
response.
It has for long been known that this
is the Japanese custom. Japanese trad-
ing firms have traditionally kept in
close touch with one another in almost
all matters affecting their joint interests,
Hard-bitten Australian Customs inves-
tigators can hardly be astonished at the


news that they got together on this
occasion.
Some sceptical officials are saying
that the evidence so far collected will
simply not stand up in the High Court
if this is where the Japanese companies
elect to contest the charges. But it
appears that they are being persuaded
to have the litigation in a special Cus-
toms Court, which dispenses its justice
quickly but allows no appeal.
One possible outcome of a special
court case would be a decision leading
to granting the Minister for Customs
the power to personally determine the
export price for Japanese cars being
exported to Australia, an ultimate
power he has under the Customs Act.
He could then arbitrarily adjust the
competitive position of Japanese cars
in the Australian market.
This possibility leads to a widespread
belief in Canberra that the dumping
allegations campaign is just another
attempt to introduce a form of import
controls. In the meantime, the Depart-
ment’s plan for the Australian motor
industry, the failure of which has caused
so much of the current difficulty, is
being left unamended, perhaps so that
it can be adapted to the outcome oj
the dumping charges whenever they are
concluded.
Mr. McEwen has plenty of justifiable
complaints against protective measures
applied by Japan against Australian
rural exports. Apart from staple raw
materials like wool, minerals, wheat,
and meat, our products face almost
impossible restrictions. Japanese farmers
are so cosseted by protective devices
that we are hardly able to sell any
dairy products or fruits whatever in
Japan. Yet if de Gaulle should ever
do the wrong thing by Australia and
remove his veto on British entry into
the Common Market, it would be most
valuable in cushioning the impact to be
able to have a chance to sell these
products in Japan.
But Mr. McEwen appears to have
decided that trade with Japan has gone
far enough.
The Department of Trade argues
that the Japanese will buy their
minerals from us, come what may in
the way of worsened trade relations
generally. They are probably right
about this, though in the supply of some
minerals products Australia is only
marginally more competitive than other
countries. By general non-cooperation
in trade with Japan, we could lose
some mineral sales.
Even if this is appreciated within the
Government, it appears that it is a
sacrifice Mr. McEwen may be prepared
to make. A fatalist attitude is being
taken about the poor prospects for ex-
panding exports to Japan of non-staple
agricultural products, and it is thought
there is little hope of ever selling manu-
factured goods there. So, in accordance
with a doctrine of protection for Aus-
tralian industry, Japanese exports to
Australia will be confined and trade
between the two countries generally
frozen.
This unimaginative attitude toward
relations between the two countries de-
rives its origin from a number of
sources. One is a fear that Australian
industry cannot ever compete with
Japanese industry and that freer trade
between the two countries must in-
evitably lead to Australia becoming
more a quarry and less a manufacturer.
Rapid improvements in Japanese
technology have led to defeatism about
the ability of Australian industry to
keep up and compete. Another barrier
between the two countries lies in the
almost wholly commercial character of
the relationship.
In contrast to the situation with the
U.S., personal contacts with Japan are
small. The Japanese community in
Australia is tiny, with only 500 Japanese
having settled here since the war. Cor-
respondingly, the number of Australians
going to stay (as opposed to visit as
tourists) in Japan can be counted in
tens.
Government-to-Government contacts
are minimal, many Cabinet Ministers
(including the Prime Minister) never
having visited Japan.
Victorian Labor
The Whitlam gap
By ALAN REID
ROOM FOR COMPROMISE between
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam and
the Left-wing Victorian ALP executive
has contracted. Whitlam has indicated
that he wants certain persons removed
from the executive, and this week the
Victorians plan a counter blow.
The persons Whitlam wants removed
are from unions with Communist Fed-
eral or State secretaries and either
Communist-controlled or subjected to
strong Communist influence. Whitlam
regards them as being improperly on
the executive. He has clearly pointed
the bone at two executive members.
His supporters including the Tas-
manian delegate to the ALP Federal
executive, Mr. Brian Harradine, who
was elected with Whitlam support and
as a Whitlam supporter —say there are
four whose political heads Whitlam
must have if he is to win his long-
drawn-out battle.
Whitlam’s difficulty is that, whether
it is two or four, the present controllers
of the Victorian ALP executive recog-
nise that this, if yielded to, would be
only the beginning of Whitlam’s claim.
Floating round for some weeks in Labor
circles has been a list showing the
names of the 30 members of the Vic-
torian executive. Against 14 of the
names is an ominous tick. These are
the ones all slated for removal from
the executive by the pro-Whitlam forces
if they can get their way.
Until Whitlam made it clear that he
would regard it as a defeat unless he
could get a major purge of personali-
ties on the Victorian ALP Conference,
there was room for a face-saving com-
promise.
For example, one of the charges
launched against the Victorian ALP
executive is that they have hand-picked
their parliamentary candidates. Theor-
etically, they have picked only persons
they could rely upon to support the
executive, though this has not always
worked out in practice. The executive
selected Captain Sam Benson, mainly
for his electoral appeal, for the seat of
Batman. But his electoral appeal proved
stronger than his regard for the Vic-
torian executive.
When the executive confronted him
with the choice between quitting the
Defend Australia Committee (in which
there were Liberal and Democratic
Labor Party representatives operating
on a non-political basis) or the Labor
Party, Benson chose the Defend Aus-
tralia Committee. He walked out of
the ALP to win Batman at the next
elections as an Independent.
But even before Whitlam’s public
intervention in Victoria the Victorians
were taking measures to improve their
pre-selection system. They had set up a
committee to see whether local ALP
members could be given a larger say
in who was going to represent them in
both Federal and State Parliaments.
The committee will probably come up
with suggestions for widening the basis
on which ALP candidates for Parlia-
ment are selected.
There was room for other com-
promises. But now Whitlam has nailed
his flag to the mast in a way which
Cairns...potential successor
suggests that at this stage at least he
is going to carry his anti-Victorian fight
to the bitter end, whatever the conse-
quences.
But unless he wins (and the numbers,
particularly on the Federal executive,
seem against him) he will have dis-
credited the Victorian executive even
further, without reforming it. He will
be in the position, at elections, that his
opponents can use his own words as
confirmation of the fact that the Vic-


torian ALP executive is either Com-
munist-influenced or has on it persons
who, in his opinion, should not be on it.
Furthermore, he is running into diffi-
culties with his Parliamentary Party.
The Party is aware that behind many
of the pro-Whitlam forces’ manoeuvres,
including the move against the Vic-
torians, is a yearning to make a deal
with the DLP.
These pro-Whitlam forces want
office. To them it is a matter of figures.
They estimate that without the DLP
they have no chance of securing
Federal power, and their belief is that
one of the reasons Labor exists is to
secure power to use for the improve-
ment of the lot of the people who elect
them. But elements within the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party (and they
include the former Labor Leader Mr.
Arthur Calwell as well as others who
are equally as influential and vocal)
believe that there should be no deal
with enemies. They want the DLP
opposed, not appeased.
They believe that the DLP quite
cynically is taking the pro-Whitlam
forces for a ride. Their view is that the
DLP is saying, “Clean up the Victorian
ALP situation and we’ll talk to you.”
But once the pro-Whitlam forces clean
up the Victorian situation, the DLP,
which is not lacking in guileful political
leaders, will say “OK, but you’d now
better do something about revising your
foreign policy along lines more accept-
able to us,” and will continue nudging
the ALP along for concessions until it
is discredited as a Party.
Evidence is also emerging that con-
tinuation of the Whitlam onslaught on
Victoria could produce strained rela-
tionships between Whitlam and Dr. Jim
Cairns, whom Whitlam defeated in the
contest for the Labor leadership when
Calwell retired from that position, but
who is always viewed as a potential
successor.
Since his defeat, Cairns’ behaviour
has been impeccable. He must feel
deeply about Whitlam’s ambiguous atti-
tude on Labor’s Vietnam policy. Cairns
recently told a meeting of ANU
students: “If Labor is elected at the
next elections on our policy, which in-
volves withdrawal of Australian forces
from Vietnam under certain conditions,
I would be a Minister in such a Labor
Government. But if we did not with-
draw, as our policy requires, I would
resign from office.”
Despite his intensity on Vietnam,
however, Cairns has been above re-
proach in his public loyalty to Whitlam
as Leader. He has refused to identify
himself in any way with those who
have been critical of Whitlam’s ambi-
guity on Labor’s Vietnam policy.
On Victoria, Cairns takes a contrary
view to Whitlam. He believes that the
Victorian ALP executive (of which he
is a member) can be improved and its
public image bettered. He appears to
favor a more democratic method of
selecting Labor’s parliamentary candi-
dates. But he believes that the executive
should be provided with a wider base
rather than purged. He does not accept
that any individual or union is on the
executive improperly, and he has
refused to participate in any moves to
get certain individuals or unions put
off the executive.
The wash-up may have to be decided
by the ALP Federal executive in Can-
berra this week. Whitlam originally in-
tended to make a report to it about his
dealings with the Victorian executive.
But, lacking the numbers to do any-
thing effectively at this stage, he would
probably have preferred to avoid a
showdown. But the Left-wing record is
that it usually has carried fights within
the ALP machine to its opponents. And
on numbers as they stand at present
in the Federal executive, there are
more executive members who are pre-
pared to back the Victorian ALP than
are prepared to back Whitlam.
Papua-New Guinea
Dual outlook?
Territories of Papua and New Guinea,
as one and the same people moving
gradually toward the same independent
destiny, most of them apprehend the
possibility that, somehow, either
Papua or New Guinea might get (or
be forced into) independence first.
A report to go before the United
Nations Trusteeship Council early in
June is expected to be generally sym-
pathetic to Australia’s policies in the
New Guinea Trust Territory. In the
present climate of the United Nations,
however, a sympathetic report could
complicate rather than ease the progress
of bringing nationhood to the singularly
reluctant New Guineans. The report
will certainly not attempt to set any
target dates for self-determination in
the Trust Territory, although it will
probably comment on the need for New
Guineans to begin thinking in terms of
a target date. The report will come
from the four-member mission which
completed a six weeks’ visit to New
Guinea early this month on behalf of
the Trusteeship Council.
The Mission had a final round of
talks in Canberra before flying to New
York, where their report will come be-
fore the Trusteeship Council late in
May or early in June. At a news con-
ference before leaving Port Moresby
the Mission’s leader, Mr. J. McEwen, of
New Zealand, declined to indicate the
immediate or likely trend of the
Mission’s thinking, but its pattern
could be gauged to some extent by the
trend of its inquiries and the nature of
the public submissions it received.
The terms of the trusteeship under
which Australia administers New
Guinea give the New Guineans alone
the right to say when and how self-
determination will be achieved. How-
ever, it is proper and, indeed, most
likely that the McEwen Mission will
comment at some length on whether
the New Guineans themselves are mov-
ing at a suitable speed. Public meetings
made it quite plain that there is no
general call today for self-determination
either immediately or in a specific
future. The mission may consider, how-
ever, that the New Guineans have an
urgent need to at least begin thinking
in terms of a specific future.
This would place on Australia an
EARLY THIS month when External
Affairs Minister Barnes was asked in
Parliament, with notice, whether or not
eventual independence for Papua would
require a referendum to be held in
either Australia or in Papua, he said
it was “a constitutional question involv-
ing legal opinion” which it would not
be appropriate to answer in reply to a
parliamentary question.
But however far off independence
for Papua x»r New Guinea may be, the
fact that the two adjacent Territories
come under different control provisions,
though administered as one, creates
puzzlement and even friction among the
New Guineans. Papua is an Australian
Territory, New Guinea a Trust Terri-
tory administered by Australia under
the United Nations. As the Minister
said further, “People born in the Terri-
tory of Papua are Australian citizens
and British subjects by virtue of the
Nationality and Citizenship Act.” What
the people born in New Guinea are is
not so certain.
While Australia regards all who live
in the eastern half of the island, in the
The UN Mission in Canberra (l. to r.) Caine (Nigeria), McEwen (N.Z.), Allen
(U.S.), Gaschignard (France)


increased immediate responsibility to
educate the New Guineans to every
possible political path which they could
take. At present Australia’s guidance in
this regard is vague and there are indi-
cations that even in Canberra there is
no clear-cut thinking on what form
the future could take.
The report is likely to call on Aus-
tralia to take immediate steps to pro-
mote a sense of unity among the frag-
mented communities of New Guinea.
Australia and the New Guineans both
recognise at present that existing frag-
mentation is one of the greatest hurdles
in the way of nationhood.
The need to streamline certain
aspects of the administrative structure
in New Guinea will probably form
another section of the report. Mem-
bers of the Mission were obviously con-
cerned at some of the overlapping
which occurs, particularly in civil en-
gineering and capital works projects.
In general, however, the Mission has
reflected a sympathy with Australia’s
policies and problems in New Guinea.
This was noticeable time and time again
in the reactions of the members at
informal discussions. If the ultimate
report rides too easily on Australia the
result could be embarrassing rather
than helpful.
Already the Trusteeship Council suf-
fers under the suspicion of being an
administering nations club and the at-
tainment of nationhood by other Trust
Territories has narrowed the horizons
of the Council. Under these conditions
a general upheaval could be started by
nations which are critical on principle
of colonial-type links.
The West
Top-end targets
THE WESTERN Australian Govern-
ment, after having been delayed for
three seasons, has called tenders for con-
struction of the main stage of the Ord
scheme now Federal finance has been
promised. Tenders close on May 14;
work is expected to start within 90
days of the contract being awarded
about April next year, after the Wet.
And the whole job is to be operational
by the end of 1971. Irrigation will be
■extended by this scheme from the
present 26,000 acres to 178,000 acres,
financed by a $20.9 million Federal
grant from the main dam, and $27.25
million interest-bearing loan for irriga-
tion works, the loan to be repaid after
a ten-year breathing space.
North-west of the Ord development,
the Amax group have been working to
prove up a big deposit of bauxite
the raw material of aluminium. Amax
are already deeply involved in Western
Australian mining through their share-
holding in the Mount Newman enter-
Model of the Ord’s main dam
prise. They have gone far enough to
allow negotiations to begin with the
State Government for continuing devel-
opment. This vague prospect is put into
perspective against comments made dur-
ing a visit to the area several months
ago by Amax president Mr. lan Mac-
Gregor. He said then that 200 million
tons of bauxite would have to be proved
up to ensure the project going ahead.
If this could be done, Amax would
hope to mine 800,000 tons of bauxite
initially each year, building up to four
million tons.
Such a scheme, if it were to be eco-
nomically efficient, would call for an
alumina refinery, which, on Mr. Mac-
Gregor’s calculations, would bring the
total cost of mining and processing from
the $2 million level, which could be
reached at the end of this year, to
$lOO million “within three to eight
years.” And if a conversion plant were
found to be feasible for smelting the
bauxite into aluminium metal, this
could follow in a further five to ten
years. The implication of such a long-
term plan would be far-reaching. A
refinery alone would be a most import-
ant step; a smelter, which calls for a
high level of power supply, would go
considerably further, possibly exploiting
a power form new to the State the
vast untapped tidal power of the region,
nuclear power, or hydro-electric power
from the Ord.
Amax are negotiating with Mr.
Charles Court, Minister for Industrial
Development and the North-West, who
says he is hopeful the coming weeks
will see an agreement with the company
calling for development after geological,
engineering, and economic studies are
finished. Admiralty Gulf surveys have
found that a port would not be a limit-
ing factor. “It would be a tremendous
break-through for us if we could suc-
cessfully achieve this industry,” Mr.
Court says. “It would mean the estab-
lishment of a town of about 2500 people
where there is virtually no development
or population at the present time out-
side of the Kalumburu Mission.”
So far, the third of the potential
developments is only an academic exer-
cise. Geologists believe that the Kim-
berleys was once a mainland; their
maps show a monolithic chunk of
Precambrian rock in the area. Around
this mainland, they believe, was a ring
of barrier reefs which are now a
Devonian reef complex, partly exposed,
partly submerged. Similar submerged
reefs, particularly in Canada, have
recently become a prolific source of oil.
Next month, a team of geologists
and paleontologists go north for three
months to study these reef complexes,
led by Dr. Phillip E. Playford, of
Geological Survey, who last year studied
the structures in Canada, where he
found that oil occurred only in a narrow
belt around the reef’s rim. This poten-
tial oil-bearing belt, he believes, can be
pinpointed accurately by study of the
fossils; hence the paleontologists, who
will study fossils which flourished in
the Devonian era and are seen as pre-
cise time-indicators, enabling time-lines
to be drawn through the rocks to guide
drilling.
If the theory is proved, then the
Kimberleys could be ringed with
several hundred miles of oil deposits,
on land and offshore towards Timor.
Such developments would give a new
perspective to other schemes. Of the
prospects, Dr. Playford says: “This is
certainly one of the top targets in
Western Australia. If we can locate
significant sub-surface reef complexes,
under favorable conditions, there is a
good chance they will contain oil. In
Canada, and elsewhere in the world,
similar structures have become big oil
producers, so they are of extreme inter-
est to petroleum geologists.”
Adelaide’s Hills
New frontier
ADELAIDE IS slowly, in its charac-
teristically cautious and rather con-
servative way, awakening to the possi-
bilities of its new frontier: the Hills.
The instruments of the awakening are
the yellow machines of picturesquely
assorted shapes and sizes which the
Highways Department is using on the
construction of the Measdays to Stirl-
ing section of the Hills freeway. This
long-drawn-out operation, which will
complete only a two-mile strip of the
full planned length of the freeway, now
seems at last to be in its final stages.
The Hills have been put in a com-
pletely new setting. They are now
clearly accessible for suburban develop-
ment. When the new section of the
freeway is opened, Stirling will be
about eighteen minutes’ easy driving
from the centre of the city.
The Hills are no new thing in Adel-
aide’s consciousness. Far from it. From
the early nineteen hundreds, and even
further back, they have been a respected
social symbol in Adelaide’s system of
values, having been all that while the

chosen area for the out-of-town houses
of the oldest and most amply wealthy
South Australian families. One could,
in fact, call them the correlative of the
stately and gracious North Adelaide of
fifty or so years ago.
Actually it is from this association
with the past that they derive today an
important element of their charm,
Along the roads one sees the old pillar-
flanked driveways, and behind them
the discreet big gardens filled with the
vivid yellow tones of English trees in
the autumn. The massive roomy houses
are also still there, with their large
drawing-rooms, their servants’ quarters,
and the solid-stone stabling long since
converted to garages. Many of them,
to be sure, are now riddled with salt
damp and falling into dilapidation, but
many have been handsomely preserved
and remain in the occupancy of
descendants of their founders.
But one no longer drives up to Mount
Lofty by the old winding road in a
chauffeured Rolls or the family
Minerva; the freeway is opening up
the whole region to the Holdens and
Falcons and Valiants of the multitude.
The Hills are topographically and in
other ways an extremely eligible living
area. It was for this reason that they
were settled by the well-to-do in the
first place. And because they are still
sparsely settled there are only 7000-
odd voters in the largest Hills electorate
at the present time their natural
beauty is so far largely unspoiled. Even
if the population doubled or trebled in
the next decade, there would still be
plenty of room for all the new arrivals
among the trees.
The transport difficulties being in
process of removal, the Hills as living
space have taken on a quite new interest
and importance. In this aspect they
seem to offer a paradise for the domes-
tic architect. The twists and turns of
their tree-lined roads, their slopes and
valleys and creeks and outcrops are rich
in character and individuality and pro-
vide an endless variety of interesting
sites for the contemporary designer with
a feeling for the adaptation of a house
to its situation. There are also many
ridges and high plateaus from which
one looks out on superb panoramic
views. No other State capital, Hobart
excepted, has within such easy distance
of its business centre a region in which
such opportunities exist so abundantly.
The contrast with Adelaide itself,
which is built on an unrelieved plain,
is notable. Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth,
and most of Sydney have the same
character. This, however much it may
lend itself to easy foundations and reg-
ular street patterns, inevitably prolifer-
ates sameness and monotony. It is only
in the harborside suburbs of Sydney,
and along the Barranjoey peninsula,
that the elements of surprise, individu-
ality, and charm of outlook are to be
found which are everywhere present in
the Hills.
In the Hills, land values are quite
substantial at Crafers and Stirling, the
two oldest areas, both of which are now
fairly closely settled. But this is only

in relation to Adelaide values generally.
Sydneysiders, accustomed to prices of
$12,000 and more for suburban-size
allotments in Pymble and Warrawee,
will smile to be told that as much as
$6OOO is asked for half an acre in the
best part of Crafers, a prestige area
only about seven and a half miles from
town.
Elsewhere, however, the land is
almost given away. In Aldgate, Bridge-
water, and Heathfield, lots of from
half an acre to two or even five acres
can be had for from $l2OO to $7OOO,
and a little farther out, at Piccadilly
and Verdun, they sell in five- to ten-
acre sizes at from $3OOO to $lO,OOO. In
all these areas land is plentifully avail-
able.
The particularly promising regions
are to the east and south of Aldgate
and round Bridgewater. These areas
will be within half a mile or so of
the big exchange point on the freeway
near Bridgewater, and from there will
be within twenty-five minutes of the
city. The Verdun region, which will be
dlose to another exchange point, is also
interesting. Land there is even cheaper.
Adelaide is expanding rapidly, and
on the city plain has just about reached
the limits of its growth. Moreover, it
can only expand there over flat country,
on which development will unavoidably
be conventional and uninteresting, with
long access roads from the city through
unrelieved tracts of suburbia. Here the
route to the Hills is itself a selling
factor. Along it the suburbs end with
abrupt finality at Glen Osmond, where
the sharply rising foothills form a
natural perimeter. From then on one
goes through pretty countryside all the
way. And nothing, it is to be remem-
bered, has so far been done to promote
Hills values.
The real basis for expectations, how-
ever, lies in the overall future of Ade-
laide and South Australia. The South
Australian primary industries are now
moving into advanced production tech-
nologies, big natural gas discoveries will
be in full production in a couple of
years, mineral discoveries are confi-
dently believed to be just around the
corner, migrant intake on a population
basis is the highest in Australia, and
the State is already well into a phase
of unparalleled industrial growth.
For big overseas investors, especially
in the U.S.A., Britain, and Holland,
an exploratory study of real estate
development might be well worth the
relatively small sum it would cost. A
point here is that the resources of the
Australian development groups are at
present pretty fully engaged, and the
field is thus wide open to overseas capi-
tal. For such interests a careful buying
program spread over a few years would,
relatively speaking, represent only petty
cash, and returns could fairly confi-
dently be expected to start accruing
in about five years. Institutional inves-
tors can easily afford to look this far
ahead, or considerably further.


OVERSEAS
The American dream
becomes a nightmare
From ANTHONY HOWARD, in Washington
IT MAY BE unusual to portray the
United States as an introspective nation,
but no one who has watched it trying
to pick itself up and shake itself down
after all the blows and shocks of the
past two weeks can be in any doubt
that America’s mood is now firmly
turned in on itself. The change is re-
flected in any number of ways, but
nowhere perhaps more noticeably than
in the bookshop windows of the nation’s
capital.
Judging by the titles currently on
display in Washington, one could indeed
be forgiven for believing that there is
now only one subject that preoccupies
this normally exuberant people a
sudden rush of doubt about the role in
the world of American power. Its
“arrogance” is analysed by Senator Ful-
bright, its “limits” by Senator Mc-
Carthy, on top of that Theodore Draper
has just come forward with a trenchant
treatise, “The Abuse of Power,” while
Mr. George Ball has only this month
produced the sorrowful dissertation on
the “discipline” he believes must always
in future accompany the exercise of
America’s power in the world.
The great attraction of America
felt nowhere more strongly over the
past decade than by impatient and
frustrated young Europeans has
always been its self-confidence. It was
not a self-confidence that was acquired
casually: it was born of a very real
sense of moral mission. It was this sense
of mission that allowed Woodrow
Wilson in 1913 sternly to announce,
“I am going to teach the South Ameri-
can republics to elect good men,” and
again, va,ther more comically, permitted
an isolationist Senator as late as 1940
to declare, “With God’s help we will
lift Shanghai up and up, ever up, until
it is just like Kansas City.”
It is easy to mock and deride such
sentiments, and, of course, in American
self-confidence there has always been an
element of self-righteousness. But it
needs perhaps to be recognised more
widely than it is that, unlike any other
great nation, the U.S. has always set
itself the one simple aim of doing good.
It did not go into Vietnam in the
hope of profit, trade, or riches: it
intervened because it was persuaded
just as it was in the time of the Truman
Doctrine in 1947 that it was the
duty of the strong to help and protect
the weak
Inevitably what has happened in the
past two weeks has led to a wholesale
reconsideration of that outlook and
attitude. Never perhaps has the tradi-
tional pattern of Greek drama
Hubris followed by Nemesis found
quite such an illustration in the life of
any nation.
It needed possibly the almost unbear-
ably poignant atmosphere of Martin
Luther King’s funeral in Atlanta last
Secretary of State
Dean Rusk,
General West-
moreland, the
President, and
Defence Secretary
Clark at the
White House after
talks on war and
peace strategy
week to bring home just what the Viet-
nam involvement has cost this country.
When that huge crowd on the
campus of Morehouse College linked
arms and, swaying gently, started sing-
ing “Black and white together, we shall
overcome,” it was as if the past five
years had rolled away and the whole
nation was back at the great moment
of optimism and hope in the shadow
of the Lincoln Memorial that bright
summer’s day in 1963. But, of course,
the years cannot roll away, the locusts
have eaten and taken their fill and
there is no way that this Administration
or any other can avoid having to live
with the domestic consequences.
No one should minimise the impact
that the slowly dawning awareness of
the tragedy which has overtaken this
country at home is going to have on
those who rule it. It was not only Mar-
tin Luther King who had a dream: at
least during the past seven years it has
been generally shared by all those who
run its Government. And most of them
now face having to live with the know-
ledge not just that they will never see
it come true, but also with the even
more painful consciousness that it was
their own actions, decisions, and judg-
ment of priorities that made it impos-
sible for it to be realised.
For the moment there is, in fact, no
easy way out whether for Lyndon John-
son or anyone else. It may have been
cowardly of the President last week not
to have gone before Congress and laid
out his plans for the healing of the
nation and the reconciling of its
peoples. On the other hand, it. can be
seen as merely shrewd political sense —
for, in the wake of the riots, Congress
was certainly in no mood to respond
to any appeal for “rewarding law-
breakers.”
In the past the fact that vast power
existed —whether for the President per-
sonally or for the nation collectively—
carried with it the automatic assumption
that it should be used. That assumption
was the product of this nation’s extra-
ordinary self-confidence, its belief in its
own manifest destiny. Take away that
faith and it is not just national pride
that is shaken: shattered also is the
whole historic sense of America’s pur-
pose and mission in the world. For good
or ill, that is now what this nation is
coming to terms with—and probably
the only safe prediction is that it is
going to be a long and painful process
before it discovers a new and more
fitting drum to march to.
Martin Luther King’s assassin
The chase
that never was
ELABORATE THEORIES of a con-
spiracy to murder Martin Luther King
are back in full spate after the lull


brought by his funeral. The strongest
evidence of conspiracy comes from the
murder’s biggest mystery: the chase that
never was.
To understand this bizarre episode,
one needs to appreciate how many
Memphis citizens are tuned in to police
radios. Although the monitoring of
police wireless messages is in theory
illegal, radio firms here—backed by ex-
tensive advertising: “Keep up with
what’s happening in the community
with your own police radio”—have sold
3400 monitoring sets since the murder.
Within minutes of the shooting, police
car 160 was broadcasting a confused
account of a 100 mph chase with gun-
fire between a blue Pontiac and a white
Mustang. It now emerges he was merely
relaying to headquarters messages
picked up by a radio on a student car.
The “chase” apparently heading north-
east out of town ended when both cars
drove unseen through police roadblocks
■—and the student noticed the signal
strength hadn’t changed, although both
cars should have been out of range.
But the “fake chase” unquestionably
diverted police attention for a crucial
10 to 15 minutes after the assassination,
and adds considerable weight to the
conspiracy theory.
A second mystery is that witnesses
now say there were two white Mustangs
parked outside the lodging-house on
South Main Street from the bathroom
window of which the shot is believed
to have been fired. Both left soon after:
one driven by the man seen to discard
a suitcase and brown paper—later found
to contain a rifle with telescopic sight—
the other a few minutes later driven by
a man of roughly the same description.
A white Ford Mustang was seized by
police on Wednesday after it was found
parked in Dr. King’s home city of
Atlanta, Georgia, 400 miles from here.
A bulletin issued by police at Miami,
Florida, on Friday described the driver
as Eric Stafvo Galt, a white man aged
36, sft. 11 in., 1751 b., with blue eyes
and brown hair.
The bulletin—withdrawn without ex-
planation five hours later—said the FBI
should be notified, but there was no
warrant for his arrest.
The driver’s licence lists Galt as an
unemployed merchant seaman with a
lodging-house address in Birmingham,
Alabama. Residents there said they had
not seen him for three months.
The FBI refused any comment on
Galt or the investigation. But agents
have questioned shipping authorities
and checked the files of Seamen’s
Unions and fishing companies in the
port of Mobile, Alabama, and also
examined United States Coastguard
records in Washington.
Yet another mystery is “The man
with the hood.” Dr. King’s driver and
another man have both said they saw
a man with a close-fitting mask or hood
running away after the shooting. But
they report him running in different
directions—and the evidence is that the
killer escaped through the front of the
lodging-house where they could not
have seen him.
A further problem is why—if the shot
was fired from the lodging-house—the
killer took the risk of standing in the
bath of a communal bathroom without
a lock on the door and firing at an
angle that would almost certainly have
involved the barrel of the rifle protrud-
ing well out of the window.
But the most explosive question
behind the assassination and one
largely unaired in public here —is why
police were unable to prevent the mur-
der or to catch the assassin afterward.
Police Chief Frank Holloman—in the
days before he retired behind an im-
ported public-relations officer and the
issue of stencilled slips saying virtually
“no comment”—admitted that “40 to
45 policemen were guarding Dr. King
when he was shot and were on the
scene within a minute.”
And the Attorney-General, Ramsey
Clark, who has taken personal charge
of the investigation, has said: “There
was a heavy FBI presence in Memphis
before, during, and after” the murder.
On Friday he said there was now “a
very substantial amount” of physical
evidence and that every possible
resource was being devoted to the
investigation. But he wouldn’t predict
when an arrest might be made.
Vietnam peace talks
Nailbiting in Hanoi
PRESIDENT HO CHI MINH is
finding it just as hard to make up his
mind how far he can go toward a com-
promise in Vietnam as President John-
son is. It took the North Vietnamese
three days to make their first response
to Mr. Johnson’s partial lifting of the
bombing of their country. It took them
another five days to agree to send an
envoy to meet Mr. Averell Harriman.
This is too slow to be the normal pace
of North Vietnamese diplomacy. The
North Vietnamese seem to be still argu-
ing among themselves.
There are two things that the North
Vietnamese policy-makers are presum-
ably trying to make up their minds
about. The first is whether General
Giap’s troops are capable of putting in
another offensive some time this spring
or summer that will work as well as the
one of January 30. The general assump-
tion is that they are: certainly their
withdrawal from Khe Sanh cannot be
taken as evidence that they are not. But
the assessment of what General Giap’s
forces are still capable of depends in
part on knowing what condition they
were in before the January 30 offensive,
and what happened to them during the
February fighting; and here the
evidence is by no means as clear as it
seemed to be a few weeks ago.
The first reaction of most people
after January 30 was that General Giap
had totally exploded the belief that the
Americans and their allies had begun
to make some real progress in the previ-
ous months. Those estimates of Com-
munist casualties, of roads opened and
of hamlets made secure in the second
half of 1967 had been exposed, it
seemed, as pure fantasy. It may be that
this is still the right conclusion to draw.
It is the conclusion that a great many
Americans have drawn. But another
interpretation is also possible. This is
that the American estimates of what
had been happening before January 30,
though exaggerated in some ways, were
basically correct. The Tet offensive, on
this interpretation, was a masterpiece of
staff work and good generalship con-
jured up by the Communists out of
what they had begun to realise was a
steadily weakening situation. If this
interpretation were correct, it would
give a new importance to the Com-
munists’ failure to achieve all they had
hoped to achieve in the towns in Febru-
ary, as well as to the heavy casualties
they suffered in the attempt. It would
explain why they have apparently failed
to exploit their advantage in the
countryside as sweepingly as most
people expected. It would also make
Mai Van Bo, Hanoi’s top diplomat in
the West, and a key peace negotiator
UN Secretary-General, U Thant, leav-
ing after talks with Mai Van Bo in Paris


Officials arrive for Kremlin talks on
Vietnam and power shifts in Europe
General Giap think twice before he
tried the same thing all over again.
Very likely the planners in Hanoi
are themselves not sure how things
stand in the south: they may be just as
much the victims of their local com-
manders’ over-optimism as the Ameri-
cans are. And they must set their un-
certainty about the military situation
alongside their uncertainty about the
political prospects in front of them.
The second question they do not know
the answer to is what concessions Presi-
dent Johnson has in mind to offer them,
and how far they can count on public
opinion in the United States pushing
him into making more concessions than
he has already made up his mind to
offer.
Of course they can deduce, from the
things he has said and done, that Mr.
Johnson has changed his terms for a
settlement. He is presumably still trying
to prevent a government taking power
in Saigon that would organise South
Vietnam as a Marxist society, and unite
it with North Vietnam, until there is
evidence that the majority of South
Vietnamese wish both these things to
happen. But it is reasonable to assume
that he no longer expects the National
Liberation Front to submit itself with-
out demur to all the men who compose
the present regime in Saigon. He may
be willing to allow the NLF what
would amount to a right to veto over
appointments to certain key positions
in the post-war Government of South
Vietnam. He may even be prepared to
see the NLF occupy a number of posts
in that Government.
What the North Vietnamese do not
know is how far he has privately made
up his mind to go to accommodate the
National Liberation Front. No doubt
many people in Hanoi see the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin primaries as
the swelling of a wave of anti-war feel-
ing that will eventually insist on peace
at any price. It would be in keeping
with a primitive Marxist view of things
to see the trend as irreversible. But
there are doubtless other men in Hanoi
—and there certainly are in Moscow—
who know the United States better.
They will be saying that, if North Viet-
nam holds out for its maximum terms,
it is in danger of seeing American
opinion swing round in its tracks. And
if that happened Mr. Johnson, if no
one else, would be in a position to take
some very tough military action indeed
this summer.
Pretty, plainly the men who take an
optimistic view of the military situa-
tion in the south, and who believe that
it is safe to extrapolate from what hap-
pened in New Hampshire, will argue
that negotiations should be limited to
the terms for a complete halt to the
bombing; or, if that is felt to be impos-
sible, that North Vietnam’s negotiators
should stick unyieldingly to the claim
that the National Liberation Front must
unequivocally run the post-war Govern-
ment of South Vietnam. The others,
who have reservations about both the
Viet Cong’s strength and the weakness
of American opinion, will be replying
that this could be North Vietnam’s best
chance to start bargaining seriously
about the shape of a coalition govern-
ment that would at least give the NLF
some of the things it wants. It is a situa-
tion that places an enormous responsi-
bility on the Russians. At long last they
may have a chance to swing the vote
in North Vietnam’s politburo in favor
of a compromise. Will they take it?
The Polish purges
Darkest Stalinism
THIS IS NO minor reshuffle: it is a
major purge. The resignation of Mr.
Ochab as Poland’s President last week
is only the first of the changes at the
top of the Polish power structure. There
are more to come, and they will reflect
a new balance in the leadership. But
the purges that have already taken
place confirm the view that the
grotesque “anti-zionist” campaign that
has been waged since the beginning of
March has been merely a smokescreen
put up to conceal a struggle for power
and, ultimately, for Mr. Gomulka’s
succession.
To a reader of the Polish Press the
divisions became particularly obvious
after Mr. Gomulka’s relatively moderate
speech on March 19. Those journalists
who were trying to resist the approach-
ing changes emphasised the cautious
aspects of the speech and its warnings
against making unwarranted accusa-
tions. But they were clearly on the
defensive. The purgers had the upper
hand, and not only in the Press. They
intensified their campaign, organising
mass meetings in factories and offices
throughout the country and recruiting
new Communist Party members. Paying
lip service to Mr. Gomulka, but
ignoring his candid admission that
Zionism cannot be a real threat to
Polish society, they went on clamoring
for victims: they branded their oppon-
ents as “Zionists, Stalinists, and re-
visionists.”
Even the officially announced dis-
missals make quite an impressive list,
and there must be many more that
have not yet been made public. Six
well-known professors have been kicked
out of Warsaw University, where the
faculty of Philosophy is now virtually
non-existent. A Deputy Minister of
Foreign Trade has been removed from
his job and so have two senior officials
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
Minister himself, Mr. Adam Rapacki,
may soon go. The editorial board of the
Polish encyclopedia has been disbanded.
Edward Ochab, out last week
in the Polish power tussle
New Polish President Marian Spychalski
addressing Parliament after his election
The Lodz Academy of Theatre and
Cinema, which had produced some of
the best young Polish directors, has been
beheaded. Even the leaders of some
sporting bodies have been found guilty
of ideological sins.
Of course, the purgers, whether they
follow the “partisan” Minister of the
Interior, General Moczar, or the
Silesian Party secretary, Edward Gierek,
are hungry for jobs. All the same, they
would not have set the country in a
turmoil simply in order to get their
hands on new posts. Mr. Ochab’s de-
parture provides confirmation that they
are aiming higher. Their purpose is
probably to pack the Party Congress in
the autumn with their nominees and
gain real power in the Politburo. Only
then will it be possible to say who is
the winner in this power game.
One particularly painful aspect of the


whole affair is the exaggerated part
played in it by the Jewish question.
Poles in official positions are now pro-
testing violently against an alleged
Western Zionist plot to blacken their
country’s name with charges of anti-
semitism. To counter this accusation,
the Polish papers are daily filled with
touching stories about Polish gentiles
who helped Jews during the German
occupation. The aim is to discounten-
ance any attempt to lift the blame for
the massacre of millions of Jews from
the shoulders of the Nazis. But the
authorities must blame themselves for
the present charges of anti-semitism,
since it is they who insisted on the
“Jewish origin” of the men they
accused.
But the new bidders for power in
Poland are apparently ready to resort to
any means to achieve their end. It is
a bad omen. While the Czechs are ven-
turing into uncharted territory, the
Poles seem to be reverting to the
methods of the darkest Stalinist age;
it was in 1952 that the Georgian tyrant
launched his own “anti-zionist” cam-
paign with the notorious “doctors’ plot.”
Asian Development Bank
In need of a shove
From HARVEY STOCKWIN, in Kuala Lumpur
THE AUSTRALIAN commitment to
the Asian Development Bank is rela-
tively strong, but the Australian
presence in the ADB ledgers is rather
weak. It is true that Australia’s self-
imposed subscription to a club that
could end up doing a great deal for
overall regional advancement was
SU.S.BS million greater than the
combined subscriptions of non-regional
ADB members West Germany, United
Kingdom, and Italy and ranking
Australia third among regional ADB
members, after Japan and India. But
in the field of special funds, as of now
while the United States has pledged
$U.5.200 million, Japan $lOO million,
Canada $25 million, and other countries
smaller amounts, Australia has pledged
nothing.
It is true that the American pledge
is currently snarled in Congress and
that only $2O million of the Japanese
pledge is in the pipeline, but both the
U.S. and Japan expect matching
pledges from other countries, including
Australia. Australia has made neither
a pledge nor a contribution. In the field
of special funds for technical assistance,
according to ADB president Takeshi
Watanabe, pledges have come from
Canada, Denmark, West Germany,
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States.
Maybe Watanabe’s current visit to
Australia—the last of his familiarisation
tours to all ADB members since he took
office 18 months ago—will help improve
matters. As things stand the ADB is the
one regional co-operative effort to which
Australia belongs which has purpose
and direction, momentum and
organisation. Just about the only way
Australia will be pushing it along is
through Treasurer McMahon’s election
to the chairmanship of the Board of
Governors. The speedy arrival in ADB
accounts of special fund contributions—
rather than the arrival of pledges in
newspaper headlines —would seem likely
to be a crucial determination of the
momentum and effectiveness with which
the ADB sets about enhancing Asian
economic growth.
For one thing expectations in Asia
have already run ahead of the bank’s
capacity to respond. Wisely, President
Watanabe has not tried to run before
he could walk as some of the more
naive countries, chafing under the tight
discipline which World Bank loans
impose, half hoped he would. Watanabe
has made it abundantly clear that the
ADB will impose similar discipline and
will not be a handout institution.
At the first annual Board of Gover-
nors meeting in Manila the week before
last, the bank was able to present a
modest annual report setting out how
the bank had been organised. It showed
that personnel recruitment presented
many difficulties since the demand of in-
ternational institutions currently outruns
the available supply of talent. Can-
berra is not the only capital keeping
its talent whenever possible for itself
when one would have thought some
migratory encouragement would be
justified.
Be that as it may, the bank’s first
preparatory phase has been completed
at some risk of increased impatience
among the prospective donors and
Takeshi Watanabe ... “no time to pull
in financial horns”
already some significant action has been
undertaken. The first loan to Thailand
has been granted, another is evidently
coming up for Afghanistan. Two techni-
cal missions on agricultural problems
have been organised, one for Indonesia,
one for Korea. Most important of all,
an Asian agricultural survey has been
undertaken and completed which seeks,
in the President’s words, “to identify
certain priority investment areas for
this bank which can stimulate imme-
diate impacts” in those self-same rural
areas where progress is slow, neglect is
rife, and insurgencies not infrequent.
This is where the special funds’ signifi-
cance lies. The ADB’s ordinary sub-
scriptions (such as Australia’s $B5 mil-
lion) are in any case only available in
five annual instalments, will be natur-
ally subject to the high rates of interest
now prevailing, and as a result of other
technicalities in the ADB structure will
only be fractionally available for soft-
term lending and financing. Leaving
aside the fact that not a few of our
neighbors already have overswollen debt
servicing accounts, the hard fact remains
that many worthwhile projects, especi-
ally agricultural ones, can only be justi-
fied in “soft” terms.
Hence President Watanabe’s plea in
Singapore last week that “this is not
the time for advanced nations to pull
in their financial horns.”
In a nutshell the Asian Development
Bank is on its way, but requires a
heartier shove. Since it looks like being
a profit-making enterprise, politically
as well as economically, one would
have thought this was not the time for
Canberra to pull in its regional as well
as fiscal horns.
Singapore elections
Risks of victory
TO THE noteworthy if questionable
achievement of becoming the first
democratic Government re-elected on
nomination day, The People’s Action
Party has added the dubious honor of
ushering in the parliamentary one-
party State to Singapore. The PAP
captured all seven of the contested
seats in this year’s “general” election
held on Saturday.
The seven “opposition” candidates
polled a meagre 12,000 votes, roughly
one-seventh of total votes cast. Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew lost no face
since his independent opponent lost
his deposit. Two others did likewise,
thus making one of the more positive
aspects of election the accretion of
$l5OO lost-deposit revenue to the
Treasury.
The PAP’s 58 out of 58 sweep is,
of course, as anticipated. On the sur-
face and for the time being unanimity
by consent will have some stabilising
advantages for Singapore. For the
longer term the fact is that one-party
States are one-party States. Parlia-
mentary or Presidential, Communist,
Neo-Communist, or Fascist, one prob-
lem is the same —the use and abuse
of unquestioned and unquestionable
power. It remains to be seen whether
the PAP has the capacity and Lee
Kuan Yew has the wisdom to guard
against this total victory from being
at least a factor for instability at worst,
but a prelude to self-defeat.

Can we look after ourselves?
By PETER SAMUEL
MINISTERS HAVE GIVEN such
conflicting impressions of late that the
Australian people ’must by now be
thoroughly confused about what the
future holds for defence-spending. Mr.
Gorton started his career as Prime
Minister announcing that he wanted to
make his impact in the fields of develop-
ment and social welfare, saying there
were strict limits on our capacity for
defence. Having apparently suggested a
permanent ceiling on our Vietnam troop
commitment, and having emphasised
mainly what we could not do in Malay-
sia, and the Impossibility of expanding
economic assistance, he looked as if he
might actually cut the defence budget.
This fitted in with the theme which
his Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, had de-
veloped on occasions, the theme that
continued high or rising defence-spend-
ing could endanger economic develop-
'ment. But then the emphasis changed
completely. The Treasurer made the
point that, despite the defence build-up,
the economy was growing more quickly
now than in the cosy, defenceless 19505.
And he got into an argument with
Labor Minister Bury, which he fought
through and won.
And as if to confirm a new aware-
ness of defence needs, Mr. Gorton said:
“It is required, now in a greater degree
than it has ever been required before
in our history, that burdens should be
laid upon us that we can provide toward
our own defence. I think I hardly need
remind you that for something like 200
years we have existed as a nation behind
the shield of the British Navy and the
British people and that that shield has
been removed, and that changes the
situation and the world we have grown
up in . . .” He spoke of defence-spend-
ing rising this year beyond $ 1200 m.,
and was widely interpreted as presaging
tax increases.
All sorts of co'mplex explanations for
these changes can be devised, but the
true explanation is probably simple.
With a few exceptions, most Ministers
are not very interested in the outside
world. They have a basic desire to
concentrate their efforts at home. At
first, new to office or away from depart-
mental submissions because of the sum-
mer-holiday break, they thought wish-
fully out aloud. But forced by the need
to do the routine jobs of preparing
for talks with allies, forced to discuss
Interdepartmental recommendations,
and generally jockeyed along by the
detailed pressures of administration,
certain inexorable facts came to light.
One was that the bulk of the s27om.
or s2Bom. for the F-11l must be found
next financial year. It was too late to
cancel the order, however much Minis-
ters may have been convinced the pro-
ject was a mistake. The planes Aus-
tralia has ordered are actually there
now on the production line, being built.
And only a portion (sBom.) of their
cost is covered by credits, with hardly
a hope in the world of extracting more
credits from the U.S. Government at
this time. In addition, submarines are
being built for us in Britain, the Macchi-
trainer order is running on, and there
are brigade and battalion group com-
mitments in Vietnam and Malaysia. All
this means that there is virtually no
way of keeping defence costs below
sl3oom. next financial year short of
cancelling half-completed projects, an
unthinkable action except in times of
severe balance-of-payments crises. In
relation to 1968-9 the Government has
no scope for manoeuvre; and "there
is nothing to be done to prevent the
foreign-exchange bill on defence from
mounting from about sl6om. this year
to about s27om. next year.
The real choices in defence-spending
lie beyond 1969 and that is what the
Government, in its own way, is starting
to look at. But between now and June
it must make up its mind on some
purchases if it is to use up the credit
arrangements made in 1964 with the
U.S. Government, because these expire
on June 30. The arrangements provide
for SU.S.3SOm. worth of equipment
repayable over 7 years at 4.75 percent,
and in April, 1965, another s2om. was
agreed at 5.5 percent. These terms were
good at the time, but now with inter-
national interest rates up around 7 per-
cent they are exceptionally good and
the Government will want to make full
use of the unused SU.S.9Om. of the
SU.S.37Om. credits.
What are we likely to get for this
SU.S.9Om.? The purchases are most
likely to be related to operational
requirements in Vietnam, where our
troops at present suffer many equip-
ment deficiencies. For a start six
percent of each soldier’s operating time
is wasted in the sea-trip to and from
Vietnam, made necessary by the fact
that the Air Force hasn’t the number
of troop-transport planes required to
take more than a quarter of the men
by air. On average 400 Vietnam troops
are sitting around on the old Sydney
at any time each year, going to or
from on the 12-day voyage. If planes
were used entirely there would only
be about 15 men in transit. So by con-
verting from sea to air, the 8000-man
Vietnam force could be maintained
with about 385 fewer troops at
around $lO,OOO a head for pay and
provisioning this would save $2,850,000
a year. Or else provide a five percent
increase in troop strength at Nui Dat.
Lack of adequate air transport also
affects efficiency, since there is a six-
to ten-week delay on all but a small
range of items of material requested
Prime Minister Gorton poured tea ...
from stores in Australia. And the w'ay
morale is affected by the need to send
mails by U.S. and commercial planes
the roundabout-route through Hawaii
is well known.
The best plane for this sort of task
is said to be the C-141 Starlifter (not
unlike a Boeing 707) which the
Americans currently use, but the
Government has missed out on that one.
Production has ceased with the U.S.
Air Force buying the giant 800-man
C-ss, which are far too big for our
requirements. The Government is most
likely to buy more of the C-130
Hercules, an enlarged and improved
version of which (C-130 E-100) is now
coming on to the market. A squadron
of these would be about s2sm. That
leaves s6sm. of the unused credit.
The Air Force may spend another
slom. of this on heavy troop-carrying
helicopters of the twin-rotor, 30-pas-
senger variety either the Chinook or
the Sikorsky CH-53 —so that our troops
in Vietnam do not have to call on the
American pool for this transport. That
leaves sssm. >
The Army is keen to spend some of
this by replacing its thoroughly worn-
out squadron of 72 Armored Personnel
Carriers, the maintenance costs of which
are getting extremely high
for the 36 in Vietnam. At $40,'000 each,
a squadron costs less than s3m., so that
the simple replacement of existing
vehicles would therefore be relatively
cheap. But a full squadron of 72 could
easily be justified in Vietnam alone,
as this is the number needed to trans-
port a battalion of troops, another


... and reviewed the 1st Battalion before it departed for Vietnam recently
battalion having helicopter transport
with the help of the American pool. In
that case the rest of the Army in Aus-
tralia would want a second squadron of
APCs, so the total cost of re-equipment
might be s6m., which leaves s49m.
The Army is at present testing the
Sheridan light tank with a view to plac-
ing an order. Initial problems with its
paperboard shellcase have now been
overcome, so there are no longer the
technical problems which the Govern-
ment mentioned early last year. About
60 of these would probably be bought
at a total cost of around slsm., leaving
s34m.
Most of the rest of the s34m. might
go on replacement parts and a range
of smaller purchases. No new, big
orders are likely to be placed until after
the five-power talks in Kuala Lumpur
on defence co-operation in the Malaysia-
Singapore area, and the preparation of
a three-year defence program in July,
August, and September this year.
What happens then?
If Mr. McEwen is correct in attribu-
ting Svengali-like powers of persuasion
to Mr. Maxwell Newton, then the
growth of defence-spending is going to
be curbed, in a recent pamphlet, “De-
fence and the Economy,” Mr. Newton
says that the “well-being of the Aus-
tralian economy will be seriously
affected unless there is a limit placed
on the expansion of defence-spending.”
He claims that the defence build-up is
already “sapping our economic
strength.”
This seems to ignore the rebuttal
already given by Mr. McMahon in the
recent statistical discussion sparked off
by Labor Minister Bury. Mr. McMahon
showed that during the period of the
defence build-up personal consumption
rose by slightly over two percent a year
on average, compared to 1.7 percent
during the 19505. The economy is now
expanding faster than then, primarily
because of a quicker expansion of the
workforce, as we harvest the crop of
the baby-boom years. Defence-spending
has not been large enough so far in the
scheme of things to have any noticeable
effect on our economy.
One of Mr. Newton’s worries for the
future is that defence-spending may
zoom out of control. He bases his fears
on the assertion that “there is no auto-
matic equilibrating mechanism” to
keep defence or other Government
spending within reasonable limits, no
control analogous to the profit motive
in the private sector. Leaving aside the
point that since Keynes, few economists
have believed in any “automatic equilib-
rating mechanism” within the private
sector, it is surely true that the political
process acts to restrain democratic gov-
ernments from completely unreasonable
public expenditures. Ordinary people
who vote in elections every couple of
years have to pay' the taxation to
finance defence-spending and in a free
society they will act as a pretty power-
ful “equilibrating mechanism” to keep
defence-spending under control.
Mr. Newton and other critics of
defence-spending also try to make an
economic case against it on two other
grounds: first, balance of payments and,
second, domestic- resource allocation.
The first assertion is that defence-spend-
ing overseas has become an “enormous
burden.” From about sloom. a year in
the ’fifties it has grown to around sl7om.
in the past couple of years. Next finan-
cial year will be the really burdensome
one, because the bulk of F-11l costs
will have to be paid. So in 1968-69
something of the order of s2som. to
s3oom. will be outlaid overseas for
defence. Assuming the full U.S. credits
of SU.S.4SOm. are taken up, as seems
likely, repayments of these credits plus
general costs of operations and pro-
visioning overseas will maintain the
foreign-exchange bill for defence at a
little over s2oom. until 1972, tailing
away as the final credits are paid off
in 1975.
For this financial year the bill repre-
sents five percent of our export income
of $3000m., rising next year to eight
percent, and thereafter falling back to
five percent again for three further
years, and falling off to insignificant
proportions after that. Is this really a
“very heavy burden” on our balance
of payments?
The answer depends on the import-
ance the community attaches to
defence. Five percent of our export
income is also spent on the import of
food, alcohol, and tobacco. The same
proportion is spent on clothing and
textiles. And ten percent on motor
vehicles and parts despite Mr.
McEwen’s hearty protection.
Whether five or eight percent on
defence overseas is too much depends
on the importance attached to it in
relation to other possible uses for export
income. We may as well spend the
money on something. Australia has no
particular balance-of-payments problem.
If wool prices in the years ahead are
unlikely to rise and more likely to fall,
this is certain to be offset by higher
meat prices. Next financial year starts
to see the big money from minerals
sales come in: s7oom. compared to an
estimated s4Bsm. this year. By 1971
minerals are thought likely to have over-
taken wool as our principal foreign-
exchange earner. By that time most of
the s2oom. annual bill for crude oil
will most probably have been displaced
by local production.
No doubt our outgoings on foreign
capital and freight will continue to
rise, without compensating increases in
new foreign investment. But even taking
this into account only a terribly pessi-
mistic economist would argue that we
will not be able to maintain into the
mid-’seventies an annual expansion in
imports and other spending overseas of
about five , percent or s2oom. If our
payments overseas rise each year
$4000m., $4200m., $4400m., etc., then
annual increases in defence-spending off
the order of ssom. are not going to

DEFENCE
in the future should be greater than in
the program which is ending. That was
devoted to an emergency buy-up of
equipment which should have been
progressively acquired through the
course of the ’fifties. The really big-
ticket weapons systems have been
bought for the Air Force and Navy.
It is true that the Air Force is arguing
that by the early 1970 s it will need
a supersonic ground-support plane (this
is a poor reflection on its choice of the
Mirage), but even so, such a program
will not start costing money for two
or three years, and it should be pos-
sible with planning to achieve
a high Australian content.
Tactical air transports will be needed
in great numbers in future, but fortun-
ately they are relatively cheap. A whole
flock of 40 Iroquois helicopters or 20
short-take-off-and-landing Caribou
transports can be bought for the price
of One F-111.
The Army is the most economical
of the Services in foreign exchange.
Ninety percent of its equipment is
already purchased from Australian
manufacturers. To entirely re-equip the
Army with the superior M-16 Armalite
rifle, now standard in the American
forces and' being acquired by Singapore
and Malayasia, would cost only s3m.
New field radio sets for the field
battalions cost $BOO each, so the Army
could be given the most modern com-
munications for something like slm.
The most expensive items of equip-
ment wanted for the Army are tanks
and artillery. The undoubted choice in
tanks is the Sheridan, a light tropical-
warfare tank just starting to be mass-
produced for the U.S. Army. The Army
will probably argue for about 60 a
bill about equal to the cost of the new
VIP fleet.
In artillery the Australian Army is
lacking in the range of medium and
heavy guns which are standard to all
the armies of Europe (and perhaps
more to the point, of North Vietnam
and China), ft would have great diffi-
culty holding its position in Phuoc Tuy
province in Vietnam if it did not have
these guns on loan from the Americans.
But if our artillery regiments are to
acquire experience in the full range of
field guns and if the Australian Army is
to have the firepower to fight as an
independent unit, it will soon have to
get some of its own. The medium gun
at present on the market is a 155 mm.,
self-propelled and with light armor,
which gives it the superficial appearance
of a tank. It fires a shell twice the size
of our 105 mm. gun, and fires it half as
far again with much greater accuracy.
In heavy artillery, NATO armies are
■equipped with both 175 mm. and 8-inch
(203 mm.), the first of which has a
range up to 30 miles (compared to
the 8 miles of the 105 mm.), and the
second of which delivers a bomb-sized
shell very accurately up to 10 miles. The
Dutch Army has recently purchased 100
155 mm. guns from the U.S. A. at a price
of SU.S.I4m. Fifty would very
adequately equip our Army. A dozen
each of the 175 s and 8-inchers would
provide plenty of heavy back-up and
add an important element of flexibility
to the Army’s overall firepower. The
cost of the program would be between
s2om. and $25m., but it would so
I am told by experts add more to
the strength of the Army than a hun-
dred ground-support planes. And they
would cost at least sloom., leaving
aside their lesser degree of accuracy and
their infinitely higher cost of operation.
How much the Navy costs depends
on the role we give it. It can be very
expensive in foreign exchange and a
burden on the balance of payments, or,
like the Army, it can be substantially
made in Australia. If our objective is
to provide some sort of strategic counter
to the growing Chinese submarine
strength, then we will have to go on
buying more submarines-at slom. each,
buy 'more anti-submarine planes at s3m.
each, and perhaps convert the troop-
carrier Sydney or buy another old
carrier—sloom. could easily be spent
in the U.S. in two or three years buying
up anti-submarine gear. Similarly, if it
is thought necessary to have something
the Russians would at least hesitate to
knock over in the Indian Ocean, we
need more of the Adams-class guided-
missile destroyers we are now acquiring,
These are frighteningly expensive at
s4sm. each, and there is no chance of
producing them anywhere near that
price in Australia. And strategic deter-
rence with carrier-based bo'mber-planes
would run us into at least $200m., even
if we bought an old carrier.’
But if we don’t think of our Navy
in this way, but consider expanding its
counter-insurgency or defensive role, it
will cost very little to the balance of
payments. For ships of the Type 12
frigate class, or smaller, can be built
HOW WE COULD BUILD UP MILITARY
STRENGTH WITHOUT REALLY TRYING


Ninety percent of the Army’s equipment
comes from Australian manufacturers
adequately, reasonably, and competi-
tively in local shipyards. To take an
example: if we were to plan to build a
Navy which could patrol the coasts of a
country like Thailand, the Philippines,
or Malaysia, and provide substantial
assistance to the local navy in a time
of limited war, we could do that at
virtually no cost in foreign currency.
Five or ten frigates and 20 or 30 patrol
boats would help provide substantial
protection against arms infiltration by
sea, as well as giving artillery cover to
ground troops up to 20 miles inland.
Such an addition to our naval strength
might also be thought necessary for
the defence of New Guinea.
All this should ’make it clear that
there is no simple argument against
expanded defence-spending on balance-
of-payment grounds. What we have to
spend on our military forces depends
on the role we imagine for the’m. An
ambitious program for air and naval
deterrence against sopmsucated equip-
ment or long-range troop transports
would be expensive. But soldiering
could be as inexpensive in foreign pay-
ments as anything we buy. Our econo’my
provides the base for a very powerful
counter-insurgency-support army.
Not that we should exaggerate the
difficulties we have in finding the money
to buy equipment overseas. At s3ooom.
a year our export inco'me is as large
as that of Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, and Thailand grouped to-
gether. Even though stricken by
drought, our wheat industry this year
will earn almost as much foreign cur-
rency as all the plantations, mines, and
oil wells of Indonesia. We have a
greater spending power in foreign mar-
kets than India or China, thanks mainly
to the huge surpluses our farmers can
generate.
There is no danger whatever to our
living standards or development in
allowing defence-spending overseas to
grow with our export capacity. And
the balance of payments can, if neces-
sary, be adjusted to allow for greatly
expanded defence-spending overseas
by the well-known methods of encour-
aging exports, replacing imports by
domestic production, or getting credits
on equipment purchases overseas. At
8 percent of our foreign-exchange
income next year, defence-spending
overseas is no great problem.
But what of internal burdens? These
express themselves in terms of taxation,
withdrawals from the civilian work-
force, and conscription. An idea of the
burden is best given by a hypothetical
example: what would happen if we
decided to maintain over the five years
from now to 1973 the rate of defence
build-up and budgetary-allocation
increases of the past three years? This
has been an annual increase of ten
percent in military manpower and 17
percent annually in the overall defence
budget. Continued until 1973, these
rates of increase would allow for an
Army of about 75,000 with a field force
of two divisions of regulars compared
to today’s single division; and an Air
Force and Navy expanded by roughly a
third each. Alternatively, it would sup-
port an Army expanded from nine
battalions to 13, with the other Services
also expanded by 50 percent, and a
nuclear-development program rising by
1973 to about s3som. a year.
Such programs would require a
defence vote of about s2ooom. in 1973
and assuming the burden were being
borne entirely by consumers (business
and civil government capital expendi-
tures being maintained fully), then tax-
ation would have to rise by a little over
ten percent each year (assuming also
that the economy grows at five percent,
'as it has tended to do this decade).
As the table shows, taxation would
have to take 27.2 percent of our incomes
by 1973 rather than 25 percent now.
Per capita consumption-spending or the
standard of living would be $l2BO
compared to $1042 now, a rise of 22.8
percent. However, had defence only
grown at the same rate as other ele-
ments in the economy, per capita con-
sumption would have been $1326, a
growth of 27.3 percent. By 1973 the
defence program would be costing each
Australian $46 more. Instead of per
capita annual taxation rising by $ll3
over the five years, it would have to
rise $159 per person.
If the extra spending was concen-
trated on the Army, then the drain
on the civilian Australian workforce
would be at a maximum. It would take
approximately 15,000 of the normal
annual increase of the workforce of
120,000 to 140,000. This would repre-
sent a loss to civilian employers (pri-
vate and Government) of 11 to 14 per-
cent of each year’s increment and the
civilian workforce would rise from
4,500,000 to 5,040,000 instead of to
5,100,000. By 1973 conscription would
be taking approximately one in six
young men turning 20 compared to one
in ten now. However, if spending was
concentrated on air and naval equip-
ment instead of soldiers, the numerical
strain on the workforce would be less
but the strain on skilled men,yvould
be greater.
The conclusion to be drawn from this
figuring is that an expanded military
effort is well within our economic
power, and could be accommodated
within the growth of our large
economy. The economy grows by about
$ 1000 m. a year and the total volume of
defence-spending has hardly reached
this figure. The growth of $ 1000 m.
gives us a considerable amount of extra
resources each year which can be
devoted to a variety of different ends.
To take one-fifth of the slooom. each
year and add it to military strength
would leave a substantial sBoom. to be
spread between various civilian needs
while providing the financial basis for
greatly improved defences by 1973.
And it should be pointed out that
for “defence” we could anywhere here
substitute “economic aid” the
burdens on the economy are similar
in nature. If diplomatic assessments
dictated that aid rather than arms
should be the avenue for profitable
spending, the figuring would stand the
same. The economic burdens would be
comparable.
Government leaders have constantly
belittled our economic capacity to
project our power in our region. Mr.
Gorton has said that our population is
no bigger than that of metropolitan
London, or Tokyo, or New York
as if those cities did not constitute
power centres in their own right. In
any case, what is the point of that
comparison? Is it not more to the
point to compare our economic
strength with the economic weakness
of our neighbors? Our economic
strength is greater than that of all the
countries of South-East Asia. Our
industrial production, for instance, is
ten times that of Indonesia, 14 times
that of the Philippines, 20 times that
of Malaysia. It is almost as great as
all India’s. China’s is only twice as
great. We don’t yet know our own
strength.


New ways of death
Something different in the way of predictions comes in a new book,
"Unless Peace Comes," by 14 international experts. It is edited by Nigel Colder, who outlines here
the new ways for men to kill each other that science has made possible. This
survey, he says, is meant "not to frighten people pointlessly but to revive public interest in
disarmament, in view of the widespread ignorance of the new horrors ahead."
NUCLEAR WEAPONS are certainly
not the last word in the long story of
human effort to find more ingenious
ways of killing one another. A lot of
money and talent continues to go into
research and development of new
weapons. Many of the current advances
in civilian research can be adapted to
military ends progress in molecular
biology, for example, may be applied
to the development of original viruses
for biological warfare, and increasing
knowledge of the effects of drugs on
mental processes can lead to new kinds
of psychochemical weapons. The ambiv-
alent character of the uses of new
knowledge is as old as science itself,
and there is no ground for hoping that
the weapons-makers are neglecting the
opportunities.
Consider the weapons that have be-
come operational for the first time in
the past 20 years. They include the
H-bomb and the so-called “tactical”
A-bombs, jet bombers with a wide range
of guided and ballistic missiles,
nuclear-powered submarines armed with
H-bomb missiles, and satellites for mili-
tary communications and intelligence.
Anti-ballistic missiles are the principal
current innovation. If the arms race
continues, we must expect a fully com-
parable crop of new weapons in the
next 20 years.
Biological weapons, it seems to me,
are already reaching the point where
they become not only an alarming pros-
pect but a practical threat. In his con-
tribution to “Unless Peace Comes,”
Carl-Goran Heden, a Swedish micro-
biologist professionally concerned with
precautions against biological warfare,
concludes: “The war-games men who
balance the costs of anti-ballistic mis-
siles (ABM) against ‘acceptable’ mega-
deaths, seem to walk on thin ice, in
presuming fair play or expected gentle-
manly behaviour (EGB) by the oppo-
nent, as far as biological weapons are
concerned.” These weapons are 'much
easier for any nation to develop than
are H-bombs and the associated delivery
systems.
What are biological weapons, after
all? Primarily micro-organisms that
cause diseases of known kinds among
hu’mans, or farm animals, or crops.
They can be prepared for distribution,
probably in aerosol form, against a
target and the agents used can be
selected according to military need,
perhaps to kill, or to spread something
like non-fatal but acute fever to in-
capacitate.
Heden’s figures for the spread and
decay of an infectious cloud indicate
that a ton of some highly infectious
agent rabbit fever, for example
carried on the wind, might strike down
all the inhabitants over an area of
about 7000 square miles.
The cloud could be released in min-
utes from a fast boat offshore or from
an aircraft. Some commentators on
biological warfare have dismissed as far-
fetched the notion of a man with a
suitcase distributing biological agents to
reservoirs and through ventilation sys-
tems. But Heden, on the contrary,
thinks that modern city life, with its
highly organised supplies of food and
water, and its swift transport, makes
such acts of biological sabotage rather
easy to accomplish.
Defence against biological attacks will
be correspondingly difficult. Even with
an aerosol detection system (of a kind
that no nation yet possesses) it will be
very hard to discover that an attack
has begun in time to protect the popu-
lation. Unless pneumonic plague, for
example, is treated within 24 hours of
detection, it is almost always fatal.
Mass treatment would be very difficult
to arrange suddenly and might indeed
be impossible if the attack were by a
micro-organism of an unexpected type,
or one that had been rendered re-
sistant to standard medical procedures.
As Heden points out: “Microbiological
laboratories themselves would be choice
targets, and, of course, there is plenty of
scope for using a multiplicity of agents
to confuse the identification.”
That is one positive menace: an-
other is a new kind of psychological
warfare make people mad. At the
very time when civilians have come to
realise that the use of LSD and similar
drugs is by no means as safe as some
enthusiasts have suggested, they are
being added to the chemical arsenals
as “incapacitating” weapons of war. To
give one example, a ton of LSD could
turn the entire population of London,
for a time, into schizophrenics.
In “Unless Peace Comes,” two
French chemists, Marcel Fetizon and
Michel Magat (Professors at the Faculty
of Sciences, Orsay), point out not only
that a wide range of psychic poisons
already exists but that our knowledge
of the effects of drugs on the brain is
likely to make great progress in the
near future. They also forecast the
development of other chemical weapons
so potent that the toxic dose will be
of the order of a few micrograms
in other words, with 10 kilograms of
one of them, in principle, the entire
human species could be poisoned.
Another possibility, mentioned in two
of the forecasts in the book, is the crea-
tion of a “hole” in the ozone layer. This
thin layer of gas, high in the atmos-
phere, protects life on earth from the
otherwise deadly ultra-violet radiation
of the sun. Without it, life on land
would never have evolved. One can
imagine that a rocket could release an
agent that would eliminate the ozone
over a wide area of land. Even if the
effect did not last long, the exposure
of the land beneath to solar ultra-violet
would be immensely destructive, human
beings might take cover, but crops and
farm animals would be fatally “sun-
burnt.”
Biological and chemical weapons have
for years figured on the agenda of dis-
armament negotiations, and they have
recently begun to receive something of
the public attention they deserve. An
equally pressing danger is that of the
spread of nuclear weapons to many
more countries: the reason for the
present attempts to secure a non-
proliferation treaty. In a contribution
to “Unless Peace Comes,” written
shortly before his death, Sir John Cock-
croft was chiefly anxious about the
likelihood of a political chain-reaction.
For example, if three nations made
nuclear weapons for the first time in
the 19705, ten might do so in the 1980 s
and 30 in the 19905. But both Cock-
croft and Dr. David Inglis, an American
physicist, have drawn attention to the
horrific proliferation of nuclear wea-
pons among the existing powers that
is likely to follow the introduction of
anti-ballistic missile systems.
Inglis was a wartime bomb-maker
who became an early advocate of the
test-ban. Looking to the possible
development of new types of nuclear
weapons, he expects no great surprises,
although he does note that the idea of
a nuclear “doomsday machine,” cap-
able of destroying all life on earth, is
not technically absurd: it could be
constructed by means of a few widely
dispersed cobalt bombs.
But what about the new environ-
ments of war in outer space and
the oceans? The limited treaty banning
the deployment of nuclear weapons in
outer space unfortunately does not rule
out a continuing arms race for domina-
tion of the earth’s immediate sur-
roundings.
Progress with spy and communica-
tions satellites makes such control pro-
gressivclv more significant militarily


and politically. Andrew Stratton, form-
erly Head of Weapons Assessment at
the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farn-
borough, points out that present satel-
lites are very vulnerable to anti-
satellite defences, and envisages the use
of manned spacecraft to inspect satel-
lites for example, to see if they
could carry nuclear warheads. In his
view, deployment of such warheads in
orbit would create a most hazardous
situation, even if anti-ballistic missile
defences existed.
For the oceans, our expert forecaster
is Director of the Scripps Institution
at San Diego and formerly Assistant
Secretary-General of Scientific Affairs,
NATO,, William Nierenberg. Exploita-
tion, for civilian purposes, of the
resources of the deep ocean will be
one of the radical developments in
human affairs in the coming decades.
But because of Polaris-type submarines,
armed with H-bomb missiles, the oceans
have already assumed enormous
strategic importance. Nierenberg fears
attempts by nations to appropriate large
tracts of the oceans for commercial and
military purposes, alternatively he fears
an intermingling of civilian and mili-
tary activities of various nations, in the
course of an unending race to improve
submarine and anti-submarine systems.
He expects to see very fast “surface-
effect” craft, related to the Hovercraft,
operating at speeds of 100 knots or
more, as cargo carriers and warships.
Fixed bases may be created on arti-
ficial floating islands, or at the bottom
of the sea.
Everything so far may seem to the
non-specialist reader vaguely familiar,
conceptually, at least. Bringing these
forecasts together helps to emphasise
the multiplicity of risks to the human
species and also to indicate how great
the scope for spending great resources
and effort in novel weapons systems
will be, if the arms race continues.
But there are more bizarre possi-
bilities. Some of those I am going to
cite may seem far-fetched, but it is
legitimate to include them in the fore-
casts and not only because of a
long-term plausibility. They must repre-
sent those new departures in weaponry
which though they cannot be reliably
predicted at present are bound to
come, given the present vast investment
In military research.
One prediction by Meredith
Thring, a London Professor of Engin-
eering, who is an authority on robots
is that men may virtually disappear
from weapons systems. He expects the
invention of Dalek-like infantrymen,
controlled by built-in computers giving
them rudimentary powers of recogni-
tion and reasoning, and serviced by
other robots. They would patrol a fixed
area, and be able to kill any human
being who entered it. In aircraft and
submersibles, men may come to be
regarded as a nuisance: creation of the
proper living conditions is expensive,
and severe complications arise if the
crew is to be given a reasonable chance
of a safe return. Thring believes the
expendable self - controlling robot
“pilots” will assume great importance
in such weapons systems.
He also conjures up the vision of
a walking bomb: an impregnable
machine on legs that lumbers inexorably
across the countryside toward its
target, navigating around obstacles and
delivering an H-bomb, if you like, at
the front gate of the Kremlin or the
White House. Such machines, he
expects, can be so engineered that only
nuclear weapons could stop them, so
that by the time they had entered the
enemy’s territory the defence would
tend to be as destructive as the attack.
Or what about a guided hurricane?
According to Gordon MacDonald, a
geophysicist on President Johnson’s
Science Advisory Committee, this is
one way in which present studies of
weather and climate control could be
adapted to military purposes. Although
the inherent energy of natural storms
is far greater than human beings can
deploy, even using H-bombs, there is
growing evidence that relatively
moderate action can alter their be-
haviour.
More drastic even than steering a
hurricane toward an opponent’s coast-
line would be the creation of artificial
tsunamis (“tidal waves”), by tipping
loose material off the edge of a con-
tinental shelf. MacDonald, perhaps the
boldest prophet of the group, takes as
his theme: “How to wreck the environ-
ment.” He suggests that one day it will
be possible to trigger a major earth-
quake by remote control perhaps
destroying San Francisco by phased
explosions in the China Sea.
The most drastic military measure
envisaged by MacDonald is the deliber-
ate starting of a new Ice Age, by inter-
ference with the Antarctic ice cap. His
oddest suggestion though he shows
that it is not entirely absurd is that
manipulation of thunderclouds and
lightning strokes could set up low-
frequency disturbances on the other side
of the earth, which would impair
mental performance in a target popula-
tion, over a long period of time.
What has struck me most forcibly,
in compiling this group of forecasts, is
the opportunity that various new tech-
niques afford for undeclared warfare
of a primarily economic kind. Natural
disasters are sufficiently commonplace
for populations to suffer them without
undue surprise. Artificially induced
disasters, indistinguishable from the
natural kind, could, over a period of
time, enable an aggressor nation to
impose its will without its victim even
realising that it has been under attack.
Clandestine economic warfare could
be waged with biological agents attack-
ing livestock or standing crops. Disease
of plants and animals can cause great
losses, especially in countries where
protection services are weak and where
agriculture is of extreme importance
in the economy. China and India spring
to mind as vulnerable nations. One or
two men could discreetly plant the
disease and then rely on the natural
infection to sustain the attack. If it
did not “take,” no one would be any
the wiser, and they could try again.
There are other possibilities. Besides
his transworld brain vibrations, Mac-
Donald suggests that rainmaking tech-
niques might be used strategically: con-
tinuous cloud seeding over a long
stretch of dry land could remove suf-
ficient moisture to prevent rain 1000
miles downwind. A nation dependent
on water vapor crossing a competitor
country could then be subjected to years
of drought. Present experiments in
weather and climate modification, for
strictly civilian purposes, raise difficult
problems in international law. They
may provoke disputes between nations
about, for example, what rain is whose.
Even if the Americans attempt, quite
peacefully, to stop hurricanes attack-
ing their southern coast, the climate of
Europe might be affected. Add to such
problems the threat of military use
or allegations about such use and the
urgency for drawing up some inter-
national convention on weather control
is unmistakable.
One kind of chronic, undeclared war-
fare, though not so clandestine, is
already in progress the electronic
intelligence war, spotlighted by the
Pueblo incident in January. In his dis-
cussion of the military uses of com-
puters, Harvey Wheeler - an American
political scientist who was co-author of
the novel “Fail-Safe” gives special
attention to their present applications
in intelligence and in the development
of strategy by games theory. “Com-
puterised intelligence and war gaming
can only grow and tighten their hold
on human affairs, as techniques
improve,” he writes.
Of the computerised intelligence
analyses under development in Viet-
nam, Wheeler suggests: “It is not far-
fetched to suppose that sufficiently
accurate information would make it pos-
sible to predict a probable enemy man-
oeuvre even before the enemy himself
had made his decision.” The logical
consequence will be pre-emptive strikes
to forestall expected action by the adver-
sary.
The men who have to implement the-
decisions will, increasingly, be simply
worse informed than their own com-
puter systems. It is in that sense, more
probably than by a technical fault giv-
ing a false alarm of nuclear attack, that
the computers may lead us into war.
Much as I love science, and the
knowledge and opportunities for good
that it brings, I find it hard to quarrel
with the conclusion of the chemists,
Fetison and Magat—“The question may
arise: Is all science damned? We must
either eliminate science or eliminate
war. We cannot have both.”

Why should we
be sorry the
British have gone?
By K. TREGONNING
IN NEARLY all the varied comment
and discussion that has broken out in
Australia since Britain announced its
intention to withdraw its forces from
South-East Asia by 1971, one basic
assumption has gone largely unchal-
lenged. Commentator and politician
alike have assumed that this withdrawal
was wrong, that it was bad, that
however necessary it was for Britain
it was creating a most unwelcome
vacuum. Almost without exception it
has been criticised.
It may be difficult to appreciate, but
Liberal and Labor alike, in their facile
acceptance of British force in South-
East Asia, are perpetuating a doctrine
or attitude suspiciously similar to the
imperialists of the 19th century. The
British and French then justified
their presence and power in Asia (and
Africa) by claiming first that it was
an intelligent and humane use of power,
that it prevented wars on the frontier;
secondly that it was civilisation’s role
to educate those less fortunate; and
thirdly, that economic developments
and a rising standard of living for all
were ensured.
When we lament Britain’s “loss of
greatness” we are lamenting that to the
modern British (and, indeed, to all
Europeans) these ideas and attitudes of
their former politicians are extraneous
to what they now regard as worthwhile
national objectives. To them, defending
South-East Asia (or West Africa) is a
concept totally irrelevant, something
stranded on a 19th-century beach. It
is an anachronism, to them, that men
and wealth should be expended and
lost far away, when so much is needed
at home. Are we not in danger our-
selves of refusing to examine the logic
of this, and of supporting a false im-
perialism for our own interests?
Our own interests will not be served
by a retention of British power in Asia,
and we should dismiss from our minds
any thought that stability would stay
should it remain. Rather, we should
accept that the direct involvement
forced on the countries directly con-
cerned is basically as healthy as open-
ing a window on to fresh air.
The nations of South-East Asia can
become involved in war in two ways.
There can be, as in the past, quarrels
between themselves. Cambodia conceiv-
ably could attack or be attacked by its
neighbors, an act of folly not without
precedent; or Indonesia could lunge at
Singapore. Secondly, a great power
could invade. China could move into
Burma, or Thailand, or Vietnam.
To take the earlier hypothesis first,
the only part Britain could play here
would be to protect Singapore and to
help Malaysia. Nowhere else in the
region would its miniscule forces be
able to contribute, and Asian would
have to fight Asian. Is it not more
sobering for all concerned that this
logic should be? Even in Singapore-
Malaysia, the removal of the almost
colonial defence umbrella has produced
The Bulletin invites the expres-
sion of views which need

the changing shape of South-
East Asia.
already a far less fevered outlook
among leaders who can now see that
direct confrontation means their own
involvement, not that of others. It is
their own survival that is at stake, and
as with other countries all over the
world, it is time to grow up and to
accept responsibilities. This is better
for all concerned.
It is even clearer that to the threat
of a large power invading the region
Britain could offer no response. Are
there any signs of this occurring? In
one way, yes. The classic Communist
technique is clearly in evidence. Infil-
tration by agents trained in Peking,
radio broadcasts to Communist groups,
the establishment of anti-government
forces are all proceeding. But what
could Britain do about this? Is it not
better for the nations of Asia to fight
for their own destiny and to appreci-
ate fully the challenges to that national
identity a great power presents?
On both counts, Britain clarifies the
position by withdrawing, and we should
welcome the decision, not lament the
belated recognition of a colonial era
that ended in 1941.
We speak foolishly of Britain creat-
ing a vacuum by her withdrawal. Can
Australia fill this vacuum? we ask, for-
getting that it is not a vacuum but an
imbalance. There are forces galore in
South-East Asia with armies every-
where. What is needed are not more,
but an Asian sense of responsibility.
Can Britain (or Australia) supply this?*
It is better, indeed it is now imperative,
for Asians themselves to seize the oppor-
tunity presented by this withdrawal of
European troops from the Asian main-
land, and to recognise that their
reliance on them is as debilitating as it
is to Australia.
And what should be the response of
Australia to this, if not one of regret
and apprehension? Australia must
always bear in mind that although it
feels it should be involved in Asia,
Asia is not involved in Australia.
South-East Asia does not accept Aus-
tralia as an Asian, still less as a leader.
It is very necessary for Australia not to
rush in, and to be well aware that a
brash cry of “we’ll save you” or “we’ll
fill the gap” has little to commend it.
Our role in South-East Asia is a dif-
ficult one, doubly difficult as it goes
against several of our accepted national
characteristics. It is to be a careful
helper, a quiet assistant, participating
prudently, if discreet soundings reveal
an acceptance, in any number of bi-
lateral and inter-Asian agreements.
We must play it cool, and encourage
Asians themselves to take the initiative
and to lead. In this way, as my own
experience on a smaller scale has shown,
indigenous strength will result. But
should we beat the drum, and endeavor
to act as if we were Lalor at Ballarat,
nothing but folly will result, for this
is not the 19th century and a colonial
area, but a time when young and
sensitive nations need to grow. As
Europeans, we must never try to lead in
Asia.

AUSTRALIA'S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
Conservation:
THE MIDDLE WAY
By PETER SAMUEL
FRANCIS RATCLIFFE wrote “Flying
Fox and Drifting Sands” more than
30 years ago. A classic appreciation of
the Australian bush and outback, the
land and animals, prescribed reading
in many secondary schools since World
War 11, it is one of a number of
books which have contributed to a
growing interest in conservation of Aus-
tralia’s natural resources.
This interest manifests itself in many
ways: noisily in massive public protests
against the killing of kangaroos, and in
demands for the retention of trees as
suburbs and factories and farms move
into bushland; more quietly in the
rapidly growing numbers of people who
visit National Parks and sanctuaries
and who take bus trips through Central
Australia.
Caravan and camping equipment
manufacturers are growth industries
which have done spectacularly well
financially out of all this.
The clash of this natural environ-
ment with the processes of economic
development are obvious enough. Kan-
garoo-shooting was turned into a major
meat industry with over 1,500,000
animals slaughtered each year, and
some varieties are threatened with ex-
tinction. Many graziers would like to
see them extinct, viewing them as pests
which compete with their sheep and
cattle for scarce grass.
Preservationists, on the other hand,
reacting emotionally to the gunning-
down of the animal which is closest to
being Australia’s national symbol, want
kangaroos proclaimed a protected
animal and kept out of the gunsights.
The preservationists and the developers
clash head on.
Francis Ratcliffe is a leader of a
group of people who call themselves
conservationists and want to find a
middle way between single-minded
preservation of the natural environment
and single-minded commercial develop-
ment. As secretary of the Australian
Conservation Foundation, he hopes to
be able to draw compromise arrange-
ments between the two groups. “One of
the tasks of the Foundation is to con-
vince people that conservationism is
not just a creed for naturalistic cranks,
unappreciative of the need for economic
development and progress, but adds up
to nothing more or less than the appli-
cation of scientific understanding,
wisdom, and foresight to the handling
of the land and its resources,” he says
in an article in the “Australian Quar-
terly.”
The Foundation, established with the
help of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Bar-
wick (now its president), got a
$20,000 grant from the Government but
relies mainly on public support. It’s
only fulltime officer, the director, Dr.
D. F. McMichael, works from an old
house on the site of Macquarie Univer-
sity in Sydney. In the two years it has
been going it has collected six firms
as benefactor members, contributing
$3OOO a year, and 1700 private members
who only pay for their own secretarial
costs.
The. Foundation sees its main task as
education. Within its voluntary State
Councils it has most of the scientific
and Government people engaged in
research into conservation problems. It
can get its research and writing done
without having to commission and so
devote its finance almost entirely to
publishing.
Its first projects have been two
pamphlets on subjects of topical
interest. One is on the controversial
kangaroos. It dismisses the idea that
they need to be regarded as pests in
sheep country, because scientific investi-
gation shows that they mostly eat dif-
ferent grasses and are not seriously
competitive in feeding.
They are, in addition, more efficient
in plant-to-meat conversion than either
cattle or sheep, and, therefore, need to
be regarded as an economic asset. But
at present kangaroo-shooting is un-
controlled and certain varieties are in
danger of being completely killed off.
The Foundation advocates a
“planned policy of management and
utilisation,” saying that “Between those
who want to see kangaroos killed off as
pests and those who would not have
them killed at all there can be no com-
promise. However, between landowners
who want the numbers pruned when
over-abundant and the ordinary citizen
who likes to see kangaroos with reason-
able frequency when travelling through
the country, a practical compromise is
possible. It must be based on the recog-
nition that kangaroos constitute a
natural resource which should be man-
aged to ensure its perpetuation and the
provision of a continuing: harvest . . .”
It argues for management programs
for each major species, based on sur-
veys of their numbers and breeding
habits, and control over shooting.
A second pamphlet points out that
irrigation and flood-control schemes
endanger the whole waterfowl popula-
tion of Australia. Dams at the head-
waters of our main river systems are
eliminating the river floods which
create breeding conditions for inland
species. Drainage and reclamation of

drinkers know they’re right
swamps are eliminating the reproduc-
tive environment of others. If irrigation
authorities were to co-operate with
waterfowl biologists in planning their
schemes then often it would be possible
to avoid this. Dams could be designed
to create alternative waterfowl breed-
ing areas, and the release of water from
them programmed to create the minor
floods required. The Conservation
Foundation recommends co-operation
between south-eastern States to work
out a co-ordinated policy.
It plans to build up its publishing
so that it can put out about five such
studies a year. In preparation is one on
the Great Barrier Reef how coral
can be commercially exploited while
maintaining the aesthetic and scientific
interest of the Reef which constitutes its
tourist attraction. Another study will
examine Australian coastlines and the
delicate balance of sand dunes and
coastal vegetation which keeps them
intact a problem which, if under-
stood by the Gold Coast Councils,
would have saved local investors a lot
of money.
The system of national parks and
reserves will be examined in detail. Mr.
Ratcliffe says that development-minded
people must be helped to understand
that the natural landscape and wild-
life are assets of real value, economic
and aesthetic, and that they deserve
a place in the cost-benefit analysis on
which development projects are (or
should) be designed. Nature conserva-
tionists, on the other hand, must accept
that development will inevitably pro-
ceed: “Land with agricultural potential
will be cleared for cultivation and low-
yielding native forests made over to
more productive stands both changes
that will affect wildlife and landscape
unavoidably.”
Multiple use of land offers the best
compromise in many situations, allow-
ing the retention of much of the natural
wildlife and landscape while allowing
commercial development to proceed.
Complete clearance of gumtrees from
land being opened for grazing is now
thought by agricultural scientists to be
bad business, as well as unnecessary
destruction of the natural habitat.


Welcome to Sydney—
a good Asian Headquarters Town
WHERE should an international cor-
poration set up its Asian headquarters?
Sydney ranks third out of eight in a
comparison recently done by the
magazine “Business International.” And
Sydney’s high status is notwithstand-
ing that it is geographically so far
removed from the centres of Asian
business that it got none out of five for
“location” in “Business International’s”
score-card.
The other poor scores that held Syd-
ney back from matching Hong Kong
and Singapore as the most-favored
centres for Asian regional headquarters
were on taxes; the height of both per-
sonal income taxes and corporate taxes
gave Sydney two items of only two
points out of five in the survey so
tending to confirm the assertion by the
Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, in
last week’s Bulletin, that Australia was
by no means “lightly taxed” in an
international sense.
But apart from taxes (and the rela-
tively high cost of office space and
office staff compared with Asian cities),
Australia scored maximum points for
almost everything although local
lawyers and accountants may be upset
to note that their counterparts in Hong
Kong and Tokyo get better ratings.
The cities that Sydney beat on total
points are Taipei, Bangkok, Manila,
Tokyo, Naha, in Okinawa. But
many firms would place far more im-
portance on some of the 22 important
factors that are equally listed in the
comparison than others in making de-
cisions about locating their regional
headquarters in Asia. For instance,
Sydney’s high total score would not be
very impressive to a firm that wanted
to use its regional headquarters mainly
as a distributing centre for Asia
unless, like so many international cor-
porations it also manufactured in
Australia.
Similarly, Tokyo would be even less
impressive as an Asian headquarters
site than it appeared in the survey (it
came equal second-last) if the high
cost of all its services were especially
important to a company.
On almost all factors in the com-
parison, “Business International” rated
the eight cities according to the way
things work not on just how they
are supposed to work. So “air trans-
portation” covers not only the
extent of the service but also whether
the airport is frequently closed because
of bad weather or strikes, and how long
it takes to get to the airport (Sydney
dropped a point on this, probably more
as a result of Qanta.s strikes than the
ride in from Mascot to the city. Sydney
ought to appeal to the stewards over
this one).
Ratings for “employment of expatri-
ates” (Sydney scored the maximum)
and “clearance of goods” (maximum
again) take into account immigration
and customs regulations, but, more im-
portant, they also cover red tape, delays,
and “payoffs” that an Asian office
would have to live with.
Sydney was the only one of the eight
to get full marks for the availability
of personal housing for foreign business-
men and for the provision of adequate
schooling for their children. Tokyo and
Sydney were the only two to score
fully on “general living conditions,”
and Sydney was one of only three that
failed to drop a point on “political
stability,” “storage and warehousing,”
and “communications.”
This sort of comparison is more than
just academic; Asia holds some of the
world’s most rapidly growing
economies, and increasing numbers of
international companies are faced with
the need to set up an Asian head-
quarters office to co-ordinate and
direct activities in the area.
Making a decision about location is
getting harder, as more countries are
candidates for such offices and are try-
ing to attract them and as last
summer’s disturbances in the front-
runner, Hong Kong, have tarnished the
colony’s reputation and brought
renewed doubts about its long-term
political future.

The new way Qantas
opens up the world for
Australian exporters.
Five new freedoms to boost
your exports and save money.
1
Freedom from costly delays. When
you’re ready to send it, Qantas can take
it. Speed your exports fast, direct with no
delays. Wherever your market, it’s only days
away. Every day, Qantas jets give you more
cargo capacity with daily flights to Europe,
Asia and the U.S.A. And goods that reach
their market quickly and safely by air,
return your investment that much faster.
2
Freedom from size problems. Whether
it’s teeny or truck-size, Qantas can take
it. From early May Qantas introduces the first
regular international jet freighter service from
Australia. Massive new cargo capacity in our
giant Boeing 338 C’s (73 feet long, 10 feet wide
with 7 feet ceiling) takes more goods, bigger
goods. 5 times more capacity than ever before.
And air speeded deliveries of big, weightier
cargoes release tied-up capital faster.
3
Freedom from expensive packaging.
You pay only for the weight of your goods
when you send them in selected Qantas
approved end registered containers. Qantas
will advise you on containers tailored to your
particular needs to save you money on
separate packaging, on chargeable weight
and give you special container rebates.
4
Freedom from market limitations.
Wherever in the world you want to send
your exports, Qantas can speed them there.
Qantas flies to 32 countries world-wide;
Qantas offices there keep you informed on
your product’s market potential, help build
your business. Improved cargo handling
techniques move your goods more efficiently,
protect your investment.
5
Freedom from transhipment. When you
send cargo direct with Qantas to most
major export markets, it stays with Qantas.
Because Qantas flights go direct from
Australia to more cities world-wide, more
often than any other airline. Next time you’re
thinking export, think Qantas Jet-Enterprise.
Think about the five new freedoms. And the
new world they can open up for you.

When container traffic comes ashore...
Rail transport is best
Having used containers on rail since 1949, the Rail-
ways of Australia have played a leading part in the
development of this modern concept of moving freight.
In association with the Searoad Cargo Service of the
Australian National Line, the railway industry has
also helped pioneer the sea-road-rail movement of
freight between Tasmania and the States of mainland
Australia.
With years of experience in the container field, the
rolling stock and terminal facilities, the Railways of
Australia are able to provide efficient service, at low
ton-mile ratings, for the developing overseas’ con-
tainer traffic.
Standardisation of gauge on main trunk lines, as well
as bogie exchange at key centres, ensures fast through
schedules, unmatched economy for inland line-haul
work by the Railways of Australia—the nation’s oldest,
yet most modern, transport medium.

The
exploding
plastic
inevitable
By SANDRA HALL
Above, Miss Judy Gernes, a leader of
the group which has established 10
Cunningham Street, where happenings
happen Jive times a week. Below and
at left are two people who happened
to be there
“ABANDON YOURSELVES to your
environment all those who enter
here.” Nobody actually says that at 10
Cunningham Street, Sydney’s newest
and most ambitious temple to audio-
tactility, but one feels somebody might.
For environment is all at 10 Cun-
ningham Street, whether you choose
to watch the flickering lines on a TV
screen from your perch on a padded
purple sun inside a giant papiermache
rabbit or be bombarded by sound as
you dance beneath the 625 flashing
bulbs of an electric cobweb.
It’s a five-times weekly happening,
engineered by a group of self-styled
drop-outs rebelling against such bas-
tions of a visual generation as a theatre
in which people do something as pre-
dictable as speaking words written by
somebody else, and each member of
the group has his own personal god—
whether it’s McLuhan, Andy Warhol,
Salvador Dali, or, in the case of Judy
Gemes, Grotowski’s Theatre Laboratory
in London.
Miss Gemes, described in 10 Cun-
ningham Street’s Press release as a
Sydney University drop-out, NIDA
graduate, and globe-trotter, spent some
time working in the theatre in London,
Blonde, with a tense, electric smile and
a dab of paint on her upper lip (it was
two hours before opening time, and she
had taken time off from papering the
walls with tinfoil to explain the Cun-
ningham Street philosophy), she sat on
a stuffed pedestrian crossing inside the
rabbit and expounded her feelings about
conventional theatre.
“It’s a live museum a poky little
event, and one of the few places where
I’m bored. Words are not an adequate
form of conviction any more, and in
trying to make them do, playwrights are
just becoming more and more verbose
and more and more inactive.”
So, she went on, she and her friends
had leased 10 Cunningham Street for
“a six months’ open rehearsal to explore
our basic medium, which is emotional,
not intellectual.”
“We’d like to let four or five actors
take over a floor for a night and put
on non-verbal theatre in which they
communicate rhythmically. But first we
want to introduce people to these ideas
with fun —exploration in the lighter
sense, so they won’t be embarrassed at
total bombardment. They’re in no way
being attacked.”
Miss Gemes and the co-instigator of
10 Cunningham Street, Martyn San-
derson, both bring their ideas from the
theatre, but with a couple of excep-
tions the balance of the group seems to
be made up of products of the Uni-
versity of N.S.W.—drop-outs and other-
wise.
“I’m not against the university,”
Brian Thompson, the dropped-out
author of an exhibit titled “Things That
You Should Never Do in Architecture,”
stressed. “The lectures are hopeless, of
course, just old information that isn’t
relevent to anything that’s happening
today, but it does provide you with a
framework for discovery for taking
off . . . into the exploding plastic
inevitable.”
Although the group has been together
only two months, most have been mak-
ing individual excursions into “the ex-
ploding plastic inevitable” for the past
18 months now, and Brian, who has
white-blond hair recalling the Okla-
homa cornfield in the song, helped to

Sanderson, who has written scripts
for the ABC television series “Contra-

Commonwealth Film Unit, is a little
less sweeping in his condemnation of
conventional theatre than Judy Gemes.
His is the calm of total detachment.
“It’s a folk art fun to go to, fun
to direct, but it just doesn’t touch me.
It was in New Zealand when I was
directing Beckett and lonesco, that I
got interested in what I’m doing now
because of the frustrations of con-
ventional staging.”
Sanderson’s contribution to 10 Cun-
ningham Street’s opening was a cellu-

around dotted lines ... so you, too,

If anyone on earth wants to travel faster
and more ferociously than one can in our
S.C. (single carburettor ) model, here's the
way to do it. This is our "T.C.” model. It’s
almost identical to its brother, but hotter.
For an optional extra $2OO, you get a 19%
lift in horsepower from a twin-carburettor
engine with a newly-designed head and
manifold plus a tachometer of the hero-
driver genre. That’s all. Like we say, you
need to be a real enthusiast to buy one. Be-
cause our single-carb. 2000 is already so
far ahead of normal automobiles that it's
like comparing a supersonic jet to the
puddle-jumping planes of the Biggies era.
However, being almost fanatical perfec-
tionists themselves, the Rover people

genuine luxury sedan, yet it’ll go screaming
through a corner at a rate that’ll leave a
lot of pur sang sports cars wallowing in its
wake. If every car on the road were as
good as this one, they could raise every
speed limit in the country 15 miles an hour
and still have a reduced accident rate."
They go on to say: "We have driven a
Rover 2000 T.C. for nearly 3000 miles, on
all kinds of roads and in every kind of
weather, and we believe it is absolutely the
best sedan that has ever been presented
in the pages of this magazine.” If this is
what you want, this is what you want.

A.P.M. plants trees for tomorrow
Since 1950, A.P.M. through its
subsidiary company, A.P.M.
Forests Pty. Ltd., has planted
and tended more than
60 million pine and eucalypt
trees on large tree farms in
Victoria, New South Wales
and Queensland.
Some of the early plantings
are now being harvested to
provide part of the two
hundredweight of paper and
paper board used by the
average Australian each year.
A.P.M. is still planting trees,
eight million of them every
year. They will be ready for
use when today’s children are
grown up. They are a growing
national resource and a big
contribution to Australia’s
development.
A.P.M. is helping to shape
a better future.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
A story of two U.S. investments
in Australia...
NO ONE WITH much sense really
opposes foreign investment as such any
more; the need for it is too self-
evident. But the question of what kind
of foreign investment is needed is still
well and truly open and the Govern-
ment has yet to show that it has really
thought the problem out, although the
current review of its “guidelines” for
fixed interest borrowings here by foreign
firms may eventually bring some sort
of coherent policy into an area where
crossed fingers and platitudes have so
far prevailed.
For the facts are that some sorts of
foreign investment here are very much
in our best interests and that other
sorts are exactly what we do not want
—indeed, what we can well do with-
out.
For instance, this is the story of two
American-controlled companies operat-
ing in Australia. One of them is 51
percent owned by its U.S. parent and
is involved, at the invitation of its
local partners, in mining, refining, and
smelting a local mineral—and exporting
large amounts of it to earn sizable ex-
port earnings. It is currently involved in
a massive expansion program and is
raising the cash in a SU.S. 46 million
loan in Eurodollars. It has raised no
long-term loans on the Australian mar-
ket to “gear-up” its equity here, and
is using foreign funds (including large
amounts at cheap rates lent by its
parent company) instead.
The other is a 100 percent subsidiary
of its American parent, which happens
to be the biggest company in its field
in the world. In conjunction with Aus-
tralia’s biggest company, which invited
it to participate, it has found a massive
reservoir of oil. It intends to pay for
its share of the cost of development by
borrowing 20 percent of the funds
locally and the rest from overseas in
order to gear up its existing equity
stake—which it is not prepared to share
in any proportion whatsoever.
The first company, Alcoa, is provid-
ing the sort of investment that Austra-
lia needs; its local partners have joined
in the risky part of the venture (indeed,
it will be some time yet before their
years of patience are rewarded with a
dividend) and they are as a consequence
to share in the rewards.
The other, Esso, is getting the best
of both worlds by keeping both the
risks and the rewards to itself and
yet gearing-up the profit I'ate on its
own investment (a profit rate under-
pinned by Commonwealth Govern-
ment pricing policies on the crude oil
to be produced) by borrowing local
funds on which it will pay only a
modest fixed-interest return.
Nothing that Esso has said about
the small proportion its proposed $3O
million local loan-raising will make
of all the further $125 million or so
it plans to spend here in developing
its Bass Strait oilfields in the next
couple of years even dents the simple
proposition maintained here and else-
where last week. The fact remains that
no matter how much money Esso plans
to raise abroad, it should have no right
to rake in Australian fixed-interest
cash in this sort of volume without
offering some equity.
Not that Esso’s effort should be be-
littled; its local spending, which will
bring the company’s total investment
here up to $330 million by 1970, in-
volves a large-sized addition to our
capital inflow, and stimulates demand
for Australian goods and services. But
it will involve a large-sized outflow,
too, once the wells begin to flow in
any sort of volume.
But Esso points out there is nothing
unusual about its $3O million proposed
fixed-interest issue here (our biggest
ever) because it traditionally borrows
20 percent of its funds locally. Well,
a stop should be put to that.
And Esso’s pleas about the amount
of money it is spending in Australia
would be a little more impressive if
it excluded the cash poured into the
petrol station side of its business; the
financing of the proliferation of road-
side bowsers that form an inelegant
guard-of-honor along most arterial
roads out of our major cities is hardly
the sort of expenditure to point to
with any sense of pride.
But while excoriating Esso and
adulating Alcoa, there 'must still be
reservations. Because Alcoa is doing the
right thing in an investment sense, it
does not mean that Australian author-
ities should not remain ever-vigilant in
making certain it, like all other inter-
national companies, is doing the right
thing on the trading front.
As The Bulletin pointed out last
week, there see’ms little reason why
Alcoa should produce aluminium to sell
to Japan at “cost” (which is what the
Japanese claim in the recently an-
nounced 30,000-ton ingot deal Alcoa
has signed with its associated company,
Furukawa) when balance of payments
considerations and the interests of the
local 49 percent shareholders in
Alcoa demand that a profit should be
earned.
Indications are that the Japanese
view of “cost” may differ from the Aus-
tralian company’s ideas. For Alcoa
seems pretty firmly committed to mak-
ing profits on all its deals and the
likelihood is that it is making money
out of the Furukawa deal. If so, it
should drop its absurd reticence and
say so. Otherwise the probably unfair
impression will re’main that its Japan-
ese associated company got aluminium
at a price that is not in Australia’s
best interests.
Foreign investment
...and one British
ABOUT THE MOST downright
cheeky mob in Britain who’ve lately
been buying up bits of our farm is the
Slater Walker group. One of its in-
vestment analysts (Mr. D. Docherty)
was quite barefaced about its intentions
here when talking in Melbourne last
week. Slater Walker has already bought
up a number of companies two in
Esso-BIIP’s Barracouta platform


Brisbane and Melbourne and another
in N.S.W. (Lithgow Collieries). This
year, said Mr. Docherty, it intended to
buy half a dozen more, using the take-
over strategies that have proved so suc-
cessful thus far building up a hold-
ing of from 10 to 20 percent of the
equity through purchases on the mar-
ket, and otherwise, before going in for
the kill. “We think there are great
assets potentials in Australia,” Docherty
affirmed. Yes, but why on earth should
■we leave them to be exploited by for-
eigners?
When overseas companies send capi-
tal out to their Australian branches or
subsidiaries in the shape of capital
equipment, plant, raw materials, com-
ponents, and suchlike —as “direct
investment in companies” as the statis-
tician knows it the cause of Aus-
tralian development is advanced with-
out question. This direct investment is
what we want most. Of the other forms
of capital inflow the reinvestment of
undistributed profits earned here by
such concerns is not quite as useful
perhaps, but probably more so than
portfolio investment even though the
latter directly benefits our overseas re-
serves. The worst sort of capital in-
flow is undoubtedly hot money, whether
In the guise of fly-by-night portfolio
Investment or in its more blatant form
of money balances placed in temporary
employments ready for sudden repat-
riation.
Then, for all its more salutary effects
on the balance of payments, the next
worst is surely overseas capital sent
here for the purpose of buying up
Australian-owned companies. Unfor-
tunately, we have lately been getting a
plethora of capital inflow of the worst
two types, while the flows from direct
Investment in companies and from un-
distributed profits have been reduced.
Loan raising
Tenuous guides
THE GOVERNMENT’S guidelines
policies on local loan-raising by foreign
companies are very hard indeed to
follow. Provoked by Press comment
like ours last week, Treasurer W. Mc-
Mahon issued a three-page statement
in Canberra at the weekend. We quote
the more pertinent parts: “Companies
long established in Australia could
expect that borrowings in accordance
with their past financing practice
would be regarded as conforming with
Government policy, provided that
their past policy did not involve undue
reliance on Australian borrowings . . .
Regard is had to the total funds em-
ployed in Australian activities in re-
cent years by the company concerned
and the sources from which the funds
have been drawn, as well as the
extent to which overseas funds will
contribute ... In the light of the
information provided, the Reserve
Bank makes a recommendation to the
Treasury. Decisions in larger cases,
or those involving unusual features, are
normally made by the Treasurer . . .”
Referring to the go-ahead on Esso’s
$3O million debenture flotation, the
statement said it was • “handled in
accordance with normal procedures
and an increase in its outstanding Aus-
tralian borrowings conforming to the
company’s past financing practice was
approved . . . The proposed $3O mil-
lion debenture issue will not operate
to increase Esso’s dependence on local
borrowings about 20 percent
for the financing of its Australian
activities beyond the level which has
traditionally applied in the past . . .”
This is about as clear as Burley
Griffin mud.
It seems on the one hand to con-
tain the implication that the guidelines
provide that there may be no increase
in reliance on domestic capital by
foreign firms. On the other hand, it
doesn’t say that. On the one hand
it implies that there are degrees of past
reliance on local capital by foreign
firms which are unacceptable as the
basis for future financing policy, while
on the other hand it does not say what
this unacceptable degree actually is.
And what, precisely, are defined as
“larger cases” and what are “unusual
features,” which take the administra-
tion of guidelines out of the hands
of the Reserve Bank and put them in
the control of the Treasurer?
And in the case of the Esso OK,
evidently the company has said that
while raising $3O million debenture
money here it will 'maintain the com-
pany’s traditional financing pattern by
bringing in 80 percent on $l2O million
from overseas. But is it actually com-
mitted to doing that or has it simply
stated that at the time of the guidelines
application the introduction of that
huge amount was its intention? And
what on earth happens if Esso finds,
after having raised $3O million, that
“by golly, we overestimated those
tender prices and we just don’t need to
bring in that whole $l2O inillion”?
The policy as expounded by the
Treasurer is distressingly vague and it
has the distinct flavor of arbitrary regu-
lation about it.
“Program-budgeting”
Tidying up the Nation's accounts
A NEW FORMAT for Government
accounts called “program-budgeting” is
under close study in Canberra. But it
.is just as applicable at the State and
local Government levels, and an im-
portant article in the latest issue of
the journal “Public Administration”
shows how it could usefully be applied
in the State of N.S.W.
Traditional budgeting is designed
primarily as an aid to stewardship, to
allow Parliament to direct the expen-
diture of taxpayers’ money through
approved channels and later check that
it was in fact spent in the intended de-
partments, in the intended ways. It
involves a classification according to
expenditure items—like salaries, main-
tenance, working expenses —by depart-
ments. But it is very poor in making
clear the end uses to which Government
revenues are being applied and there-
fore most unhelpful in the Govern-
ment’s job of deciding how to relate its
set of priorities to the format of the
budget.
The current N.S.W. budget papers
(and those of other States and the
Commonwealth are similar) make it
extremely difficult to work out exactly
what is being allocated to even as broad
an item as health, since health expen-
ditures are hidden within a number of
agency classifications and must be found
in different financial papers. The
N.S.W. Ministry of Health, Education,
and Child Welfare gets a revenue
allocation and also a loan fund grant
and an unknown proportion of each is
used for health. In addition, the Hos-
pitals Commission gets a grant and
raises moneys of its own for health,
The Director-General of Public Health
puts out a report for the year just
finished which is somewhat more help-
ful in grouping health expenditures to-
gether, but any further subdivision of
programs as between control and pre-
vention, treatment and rehabilitation,
long-term care, training, etc., is im-
possible. There is no way of seeing
how these are faring and no way of
considering priorities between them,
Program-budgeting is a supplemen-
tary accounting format which attempts
to tidy up the budget framework so
that the functional purposes (or pro-
grams) on which money will be spent
are clearly identifiable. It lumps to-
gether revenue and loan-financed items
of expenditure and cuts across depart-
mental and agency divisions to provide
a single figure for the amount being
allocated to a particular end-purpose,
Within that it may provide sub-
divisions.
Within the framework of program-
budgeting in the U.S. Administration,
Mr. McNamara was able to introduce
the pathbreaking management tech-
niques he brought from Ford to the
American Defence Department, earn-
ing him the reputation for getting much
greater value for the taxpayer’s dollar,
President Johnson has since extended
the new program-budget system to
civilian areas of the administration,
If parts of Mr. Spigelman’s paper
are rather esoteric, the section showing
its application to the N.S.W. accounts
will be of great interest, as a practical
step to better government.

MEN AND MATTERS
THE LAWN TENNIS Association of
Australia attracts a catholic lot of con-
tenders for its presidency. The present
officeholder, Air. C. A. Edwards, a
pharmaceutical chemist, took over from
Norman Strange, a former top civil
servant and later one of Stanley Kor-
man’s cohorts in the Stanhill complex.
“Big Bill” Edwards mixes his tennis
administration with a deep interest in
the Royal Agricultural Society in Bris-
bane, of which he’s a councillor, and
also the Brisbane and South Coast
Hospitals Board. At the age of 63 he
has shown himself still highly compe-
tent in all fields. This year, however, he
is going to have to match his 20-stone-
odd in the presidency contest with a
Victorian weighing only three stone less,
and less than half his age—the manag-
ing director of Victorian Quarries, Mr.
Wayne Reid.
Wayne Reid belongs to a family
whose name is synonymous with
quarrying in Victoria, its main interest
now being represented by G. H. Reid
(Constructions) of which Wayne is a
director with a host of other Reids on
the board, and its subsidiaries sprinkled
over the various Australian States. Vic-
torian Quarries, whose sites are on the
Mornington Peninsula, has had a
chequered career (like the Indoor
Bowling Association, of which he is
chairman) since listing in 1964. But
then this is rather typical of the
family’s interests (especially in Western
Australia) in recent years, what with
the Exmouth contract and all that.
Now, however, the quarrying and con-
struction shows are back in the black
and Wayne has acquired something of
a reputation in getting them there.
AN ACCOUNTANCY training seems
an unlikely background for a sales
and advertising manager of a fashion
knitwear and sportswear business like
Jantzen (Australia) Ltd. But this is
what happened to John N. Walker
when he was appointed to the company
in January, 1938.
Later in the same year he became
a director, and in 1940 managing direc-
tor. His retirement a couple of weeks
ago, at the age of 64, after 28 years
in that position opened the way for
yet another ex-accountant, Mr. Alex
Blain, a New Zealander who was first
in practice for himself, then with Bur-
roughs (business equipment). Blain
joined Jantzen in November, 1964, and
became marketing director before in-
heriting John Walker’s position as chief
executive.
In the 28 years of Walker’s managing
directorship, Jantzen’s sales have grown
from $209,000 to $2.8 million, and
capital from $117,500 to $563,000. His
services to manufacturing industry won
him an OBE in the 1964 New Year
honors. These included serving on man-
power committees during the war, in-
dustry training, presidency of the
Knitted Textile Manufacturers Associa-
tion of N.S.W., vice-presidency of the
Australian Institute of Management in
Sydney, presidency of the Chamber of
Manufactures of N.S.W., and of the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures
of Australia, adviser to the Common-
wealth Government on manufacturing
industry during Common Market talks
J. N. Walker
Wayne Reid
in London and Brussels, and being
foundation president of the Australian-
Japan Business Co-operation Com-
mittee.
WHAT WITH the Belgium mattress
ticking group Bekaert and the Swiss
dyestuffs people Santoz building new
establishments in Melbourne and Total
linking with Boral things are looking
up for European investment in Aus-
tralia. Between them, Bekaert and
Santoz will have spent about $lO mil-
lion on industrial developments in Mel-
bourne and Sydney (where Santoz will
soon be spending a further $2 million
on a pharmaceuticals set-up) when
their present investment programs are
completed. The promise of more to
come from Switzerland looked the rosier
when 67-year-old Werner Stauffacher,
one of the most respected members of
the financial establishment, whose purse
is reputed to be as fat as that of
Aristotle Onassis himself, dropped in
for a week or so for the opening of the
new Santoz show at Chadstone last
week.
The Stauffacher family has been an
integral part of the Swiss-based Santoz
group (which has interests in various
commercial and manufacturing shapes
in 67 countries) from the earliest days
when Edouard Santoz and Alfred Kern
started it 82 years ago. Werner has been
with the firm for 47 years and is still
a member of its international board, a
position his father held for the 34 years
to 1932, and he has also been on the
Australian board since the company’s
agency business was turned into a pro-
prietary company in 1956. Although
fluent in five languages, this retiring
millionaire preferred to stay in the
background at the Santoz opening.

HOW TO RELIEVE
THE SIEGE OF
INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT
By J. C. HORSFALL
THE ONLY sensible thing happening
to interest rates in the present extraord-
inarily liquid situation is that first-
class companies are getting new funds
on debenture at knock-down rates. For
the rest, any easing of borrowing terms
is patchy. If one discounts the capital
appreciation element in the low yields
on the shares of certain growth in-
dustrial companies, generally speaking,
industrial share yields are most gen-
erous and show little inclination to
come down in reflection of the high
availability of investment funds. Nor
is there any reflection of this in un-
secured notes, where yields of at least
nine percent are the rule, and appetite
for them minimal.
Against this, during the past year or
more, a spate of risk money has poured
into mineral shares, lifting many of
them to heights which, even if in some
cases below last year’s peaks, bear only
remote relationship to prospective
rewards. For better or worse, however,
most of this risk money has stayed put
in mineral shares. Very little has left
to take its chances in industrials, at
least those without minerals attach-
ments. In retrospect, it goes without
saying that a goodly proportion of this
risk money has come from overseas and
that these overseas funds have given
industrials a wide berth. By the same
token this has also been the pattern
for locally owned risk money; that is
pretty obvious to anybody. This goes a
long way toward explaining why
industrial investment is still in the
doldrums.
Before the attractions of minerals
captured the fancy of investors (to the
grave exclusion of industrials), the main
reason advanced, say in 1966 particu-
larly, to explain the lethargy of
industrial shares was the pull of attrac-
tion of fixed interest securities but-
tressed by high official interest rates
and the various devices for snaring
investment funds for Government loans.
Now, in fact, industrials still have these
devices and high interest rates weighing
against them, with the pull of funds
into minerals investment superimposed.
As there’s little sign of the latter being
removed and nobody in their senses
would wish it to be the question is
whether the Treasury should now recast
its interest rate policy and relax some
of the various strings attached to it for
pulling funds into Government loans.
The first thing to say about this is
simply that if the Government abated
its demands on the capital market, the
private sector’s demand for funds from
it could be better accommodated, leav-
ing a bigger space for fitting in
industrial demand between the favored
two claimants, the Government and
minerals investment. With all the
pressures from the States and its own
departments working to increase the
Government’s demands on the market,
I am not saying that this would be
easy nor that it is likely to happen. But
it is something the Premiers should
think seriously about, that is if they
want their States to thrive industrially,
before having their next talks with
Federal Ministers in Canberra.
The next point seemingly worth
making is that in the next two months
or so, when tax money is pouring into
the Treasury and when the latter’s need
for temporary finance will be sharply
reduced (if not obviated altogether by
June), it would seem feasible to reduce
very considerably the rate of return
offered on Treasury notes. Indeed, it
might be a good idea for a time to
suspend issues of new Treasury notes
and force potential subscribers to seek
employment for their funds elsewhere.
At the same time a general reduction
could be effected in fixed-deposit rates
over the banking system, where some of
it would undoubtedly lodge itself.
Equally, some of it would go directly
into the short-term market with the
effect of reducing yields on Government
bonds. Alternatively, the Government
could continue with its Treasury notes
issues and use the funds to buy bonds in
the open market, thus getting a reduc-
tion in interest rates that way. It would
be a great shame if some impact could
not be made on interest rates with all
this hot money floating around.
I have little doubt that the authorities
would be horrified at the idea of sus-
pending Treasury notes issues, and
so would the short-term money market,,
for whom they are so useful. On the
other hand, the present crossroads lead-
ing to flush pastures for the Federal
Treasury (and the usual retirement of
most of its Treasury bills) is a danger-
ous one which could well require
unorthodox steps. The worst thing that
could happen is that the Federal
Treasurer would come out with one of
his “little Jack Horner” statements and
with hot-money plums in his hand pro-
ceed to give super-generous treatment
to the Premiers and be encouraged to
go on new public-works excursions on
the strength of them on the Federal
Government’s own account as well.
Thus an opportunity to get interest
rates down and relieve the siege of
industrial investment would be lost.
However good his intentions were in
August last year toward the private
sector, this could be the very worst
course he could take now, especially if
he is sparing a thought for it still. But
maybe by this time it has sunk in that
it is not really the private sector or
the level of industrial share prices anv
more than public works and the avid
demands of the States that should be
demanding first attention in the
Treasury and that, rather, it is defence
and the mounting and unpredictable
bill for it in the year ahead.

BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Government is completing
a review of its “guidelines” policy for foreign borrowers in
Australian markets against a background of controversy
over Esso’s proposed $3O million local raising.
The controversy raged on over alleged dumping of
Japanese motor vehicles in Australia.
Farm Development Loan funds of the major trading
banks are being increased from $5O million to $B7 million.
For the markets: In London the index climbed to
a new all-time peak, while on Wall Street, prices moved up
sharply, and the previous Wednesday’s volume record of
19,290,000 shares was surpassed; at one time the high-
speed stock ticker was 41 minutes behind floor trading. The
feverish trading was the consequence of news surrounding
the Vietnam peace talks, and making up for lost time as the
market was closed on Tuesday in memory of Dr. Martin
Luther King.
On Australian share markets, a stronger tone developed in
metals and minerals, supplementing the rise in inudstrial
shares.
With sharebrokers hazarding guesses of BHP’s immediate
worth, short term targets of $4O, and $lOO a share in three
to eight years, BHP shares rose from $18.05 to $19.25, just
15c short of an all-time record . . . Recognition of the
proximity of Anaconda-CRA-New BH’s lease to Metals
Ex. nickel strike pushed CRA shares up to $13.70 (only
30c short of a record); Metals Ex. itself climbed from
$3.50 to $4.85, slipping to $4.81 at week’s end, but still
below this year’s peak of $5.90 . . . Hamersley went to new
heights of $10.20, but finished at $9.28 . . . During the
week WMC recovered from a low of $7.10 for the shares
land $4.10 for the rights to a final $7.60 and $4.58, after
peaking at $7.68 and $4.62.
A special parcel of 100,000 shares in Consolidated Press
was traded at $4.36, 14c below the then market.
Evidence of the impact of the mining boom on Australian
stockmarkets came in the news that the value of share
turnover on the Stock Exchange of Melbourne in the six
months to March 31 was 16 percent higher than the record
volume for the entire year to September 30, rising by 285
percent to $425.9 million. Mining share turnover rose 549
percent to $194 million.
For companies: Without allowing for any increase
in sterling terms caused exceptionally by devaluation,
ES and A Bank’s profits showed an improvement in the
December half, and this trend is likely to continue for the
year . . . The Australia Hotel, now controlled by MLC and
Lend Lease, will be open for two years yet before the site
will be redeveloped. Anthony Horderns’ earned $74,000
pre tax in the February half. L. J. Hooker Investment Cor-
poration Ltd. proposes to change its name to Hooker Cor-
poration Ltd. Stirling Henry, now effectively controlled by
Mr. W. Shapowloff, will change its name to Kwikasair
Industries Ltd. Anderson Meat (under receiver- and
managership) lost $70,000 in the December half.
A one-for-ten issue is announced by J. Blackwood, and
the company expects to hold the 16 percent dividend, as
sales and profits should show further progress for the full
year . . . An institution will take up $1 million of seven per-
cent preference shares in Gcllin Holdings. Queensland Press
lifted sales and profit in the December half, but costs rose
and are expected to rise further. Swan Brewery’s first half
to March produced satisfactory progress in sales and general
performance and an increased profit.
On the fixed interest market, AGC is raising up to $25
million (and offering slightly higher rates), Cambridge
Credit is looking for $4 million, and Trade Credits seeks $|
million. A client of A. B. S. White and Co. sought 500,000
Direct Acceptance Corporation shares (about 10 percent of
capital) at 51c on a first-come first-served basis, and
secured more than 700,000 on the day.
Perch A-l, Esso-BHP’s latest discovery, appears on testing
to be uneconomic . . . The feasibility study by BHP and
Lysaght into the establishment of a joint steel plant may
take a year . . . Boral, which swallowed Mr. R. E. Ross’
Bayview Quarries, could face some price competition when
Mr. Ross’ newly formed Hillview Quarries are developed
at something like $3 million.
In the December half, Coal and Allied sales and profit
rose. In the year to December The Invincible Colliery Ltd.
lost $25,000.
Metals Exploration and Freeport cf Australia intersected
nickel sulphide assaying up to 16.55 percent nickel at their
Nepean prospect in W.A. . . . Rutile and Zircon Mines
(jointly owned by a Kathleen Investments subsidiary and
Peko-Wallsend Investments) will supply 97,500 tons of rutile
ore to an American paint manufacturer from 1969 to 1974.
Issues of Southern Pacific Petroleum NL and Central
Pacific Minerals NL for flotation were heavily over-
subscribed.

SO FAR INVESTORS have had a
tricky year. Already in the months
to date we have had to contend with a
mining boom; a fall off in the mining
boom (turnovers in the oil and mining
sectors are now only about half what
they were six weeks ago); a U.K. Bud-
get with more than usual bite for Aus-
tralia (although this was probably less
important than it was played up to be
by most); an international monetary
crisis (not yet solved but temporarily
shoved under the mat); and a dramatic
bid for world peace which sent most
major overseas markets into a flurry
but which has left our local one cucum-
ber cool. It will be interesting to see
what’s next on 1968’s agenda. Stock-
broker friends tell me they wouldn’t
be surprised to see a few more really
good mineral and oil strikes set off the
boom again. I wonder . . . ?
One company I don’t wonder about
is Brooker Holdings. Although probably
best known for its aluminium boats,
Brooker, in fact, makes most of its
profits from its automatic lathe work,
press work, and steel and aluminium
fabrication divisions. And the profits
that Brooker has been making lately are
very much on the up and up. Last year
they vaulted up by 31 percent and this
year they look like doing even better
(which is no mean order). So far it’s
■been so good. The interim report was
an extremely encouraging one. Profits
were up by 33 percent and the six per-
cent half yearly dividend was covered
2.25 times by earnings. Directors also
announced that they expected the
present trend in profits would continue
for the rest of the financial year. It
all sounded good. So did the announce-
ment that the company was now in the
foamwall building panel business —it is
using the same polyurethane foam that
gives its boats bouyancy. The company
developed a system for using the poly-
urethane which was tested by the Uni-
versity of N.S.W. and found to amply
meet the requirements of the building
trade. Not only do Brooker panels help
reduce the costs of buildings but they
will also give them a longer life ex-
pectancy. What Brooker will get out
of the deal will be more profits, and
being interested in companies that are
likely to make more profits I bought
200. Although the company’s shares
have already gone up by around 20 per-
cent this year, there is still a lot of
room for improvement if the company
continues to go the way in which its
nose is currently pointed.
Another company that looks like hav-
ing a good year is Hardie Trading.
This company is in the merchandising
game and caters to the chemical textile
and engineering trades. Over the past
two years, although its profits have been
reasonable, they haven’t shown the
growth that they should have. The
reason was simple. They were held
back by losses incurred in getting a new
subsidiary off the ground. The guilty
company was Glas-Kraft Laminates
(Australia) Pty. Ltd., which makes glass
fibre reinforced laminated papers and
foils for use in packaging and build-
ing; unfortunately for Hardie Trading
it also makes losses. Last year it lost
$158,439 and Hardie’s suffered accord-
ingly. Hardie doesn’t own all of Glas-
Kraft. Its exact interest is not known
(to me anyhow), but it’s generally
thought to be substantial, and some-
where around the 80 percent mark.
Prospects are now brighter in the Glas-
Kraft camp. When Hardie Trading re-
leased its interim in early March it
announced that its problem child was
improving. It had incurred a
“greatly reduced loss” and was making
good progress. With Hardie itself an-
nouncing that it had “record sales” and
“improved profits,” the future looks
pretty good all round. If you take
the company’s 1966-67 profit of
$798,000 and add back somew r here
around $lOO,OOO for its share of the
Glas-Kraft loss, you get to a figure
of around $900,000. If Hardie earns
this much in 1967-68—and in view of
the information to hand so far this does
not seem unreasonable—its earning rate
will move up to 30 percent. If this
happens, it also seems equally feasible
that its share price will adjust accord-
ingly. I hope it does. I bought 200.

Good cheer in share index
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
ALL IT NEEDS is a bit of success
on the oil front or some nickel news
from BHP and the market will be
through the roof again. By the time it
closed for Easter, the Stock Exchange
had recovered all but one percent of
the ten percent fall it suffered after
reaching its peak in early February.
But the latest healthy state of the
Index was due much more to the non-
mining section of the share list than
was the case in February; in fact
mining stocks are still about five per-
cent below their February peak at
present as the latest bout of nickel
news is not having much of an impact
on the big stocks although Western
Mining is looking a lot healthier nowa-
days and could easily get back to its
presplit equivalent of around $9 or
so if the market keeps up its present
enthusiastic mood. In any event, there
have been a lot of call options taken
on WMC recently, indicating faith in
its upward course.
Leading the market’s rise has been
BHP, whose disappointing news from
Its Perch well did not prevent the stock
from closing for Easter at $19.25, or
within only 15 cents of its February
peak. BHP shares do not have far to
go before they begin to pay off for the
big buyer of call options noted here
late last year, who still has a month
left to see them over his break-even
mark of $2O. It could be that the buyer
had nickel in mind more than oil; a
report is rumored to be due shortly on
BHP’s Rockhampton prospect,
In addition, industrials generally have
looked pretty healthy; our old favorite
ACI has come good again following last
week’s comments here. (There is more
on ACI in this week’s Melbourne
market comments.)
All this good cheer in the share price
index has happened despite the lack of
anything that even smells like good
news on the oil front, where the big
hopes for offshore oil outside Bass
Strait have yet to come to fruition and
where oil searchers are taking advan-
tage of the speculative interest in the
market by scooping out large sums in
calls or new floats,
Last wee k we suggested that some
’mining stocks may have extra appeal
while their prices were temporarily de-
pressed; the same goes for oil. But one
of the most interesting is the Alliance
group which is being very active right
now. Although oil expert Quentin
Cameron in his “Oil Digest” calls the
Penjobe well that Alliance is currently
drilling in the Springsure area of
Queensland “rather an unknown
quantity,” he is clearly interested in
the prospects for the Alliance group’s
scheduled drilling in the Chandos area
next month (where it has already had
favorable indications). After that, of
course, there will be the even 'more in-
teresting offshore project in the Bona-
parte Gulf to follow later in the year.
At the moment, the shares in the group
are relatively high, but they could well
rise further as these wells go down.
There are unconfirmed reports that
next month Oil Search will spud in an
offshore well, closer to the Papuan coast
than the interesting Phillips well drilled
earlier this year, in conjunction with
Esso, which can earn a 50 percent in-
terest in the area by drilling four wells.
Oil Search shares have held up well fol-
lowing the temporary abandonment be-
cause of high winds of the neighboring
Phillips Well on the Uramu structure
and the decision not to return to this
site until late in the year. But this
market strength could be because of
mounting interest in Phillips’ current
well at Orokolo, miles offshore and
also near an Oil Search area.
There are plenty of oil prospects
that are well down fro ! m their best
prices now, however. The Associated
group is having a rough trot; its first
five wells of the 20 planned for 1968
in the Roma area have been dry and
so the group’s shares are at their lowest
point for the year. As the company’s
program is to continue and as only one
quarter of its 20 chances have been
used up, the market may be a little
severe in chopping one third off the
group’s peak prices for the year. This
is a cheap spec right now.
The disappointing result in AOG’s
Aquarius offshore well, following the
abandon'ment of its Capricorn one, has
knocked the shares back 70 cents to
$1.65. But, as Quentin Cameron points
out, AOG’s drilling partner, Gulf Oil,
has discovered that a substantial thick-
ness of prospective sediments are
The Chartist says:
SANTOS LTD. is an oil stock with exciting possibilities for investors. It is a
perfect example of a long-term trendline study where the basic 20 percent primary
uptrend has been “tested” five times since 1960. There have been some steep
intermediate uptrends at various intervals and the current position suggests that
buying power is gradually increasing and that prices could rise sharply very soon.
Once the downtrend is broken and prices move above the $2.60 level, targets of
$3.20 and $4.00 are indicated and these are also related to major resistance levels;
the first major move is in excess of $5.00. However, there is also a possibility of
a longer-term target of $lO.OO, and the situation would call for reassessment after
the first move to the $5.00 level. Last sale price on 10/4/68 $2.23.

Another cheap speculation in the oil
market is Farmout Drillers, which are
still below the 20 cents mark. The
company, 43 percent owned by Free-
port Sulphur, holds an 8 l-3rd interest
in two interesting-looking wells to be
drilled in the Amadeus Basin by the
Magellan group in coming months.
Farmout also has a small stake in
Mereenie, w'hose exploitation could well
be hastened if Exoil-Transoil’s well at
Munyarai, which is due to begin drilling
next month, strikes oil.
Planet Oil is another punters’ stock
now that its Bancannia North well is
on the way down, under an agreement
with the Australian Gas Light Co. It
would have to be pretty lucky to strike
it rich, but even a moderate gas dis-
covery would be welcome in view of
the strategic location of the well—about
half-way between Mereenie and Sydney.
At best it is fairly cheap now at around
45 cents, which seems a fair price.

Spinning money
from fibreglass
WHAT MAY BE poison to the num-
erous companies which are going to
meet heavy competition in the materials
they make from ACl’s rapid develop-
ment of fibreglass usage gave a nice
meaty look to the latter’s shares in the
market last week. They had no trouble
topping the $3 mark again after the
news got out that in combination with
its American associates, Owens Corn-
ing Fibreglass Corporation, it is
engaged on spending $1 million on a
fibreglass development program. ACl’s
long association with this American
group which is about the biggest
in the business is clearly going to
pay off handsomely from now on. ACI
has been producing fibreglass and a lim-
ited range of products on its 148-acre
site at Dandenong for about eight years
now, but clearly this has only been a
small beginning to what will ultimately
be one of its biggest money-spinners.
Production of fibreglass wool insula-
tion is being increased by 50 percent
in the first stage of the development.
Plant will be financed from ACl’s in-
ternal funds and by Owens Corning in
proportion to their present respective
interests in their jointly owned Austra-
lian Fibreglass Pty. Limited.
The extensions to the fibreglass wool
plant are due to be completed by the
end of April. The wool manufacturing
line has been extended to give increased
production capacity, and new equip-
ment has been installed to widen the
product range and to give improved
quality to all products.

will do all this. A label that will sell itself while staying
with Coke's fresh, lively image and providing some
brand association with the traditional bottle.
Coca-Cola chooses a Foil Label.
First consideration : to establish the most economical
and efficient combination of paper, foil and adhesive.
A problem. Alcan adds ideas. Able to draw on experience,
here and overseas, Alcan is able to give the precise
specification, on thd spot. Coca-Cola decides on the
graphic design. It is a combination of transparent and
opaque inks cleverly arranged so the clean brilliance of
the foil shines through. The familiar Coca-Cola symbol is
used for brand association. Together the elements make
a brilliant, eye catching point of sale piece.
For Coca-Cola this is a success story. Foil gave them a
louder voice where they needed it, a better looking
package and was surprisingly economical.
And that's just a few of the things foil can do. Like to
find out what foil can do for your product ?

facture of a range of acoustic and de-

The second stage of the development
will be the construction of a chemical
factory in which the company will make
its own resins, sizes, and plastisols for
wool and textile products.
Work is to start shortly on the third

THE CLAIMS of sound, smallish com-
panies find it hard to get a hearing
on ’change these days with so many big
noises demanding attention from the
market. Among the lesser lights some
brokers have been talking higher is
J. S. Grey, the paper-bag and wrapping-
paper maker, though that’s about all
that has been happening to the 50-cent
: shares all this year; they’ve kept pretty
close to 58 cents, the present price, all
the time. It hasn’t helped them that
profit slipped slightly last year, making
people forget that even at the lower
level the steady 10 percent dividend
was covered 2.1 times, so that at 58
they give a dividend yield of 8.6 per-
cent and an earnings one of more than
twice that. Recent reports suggest that
the full year’s result will be distinctly
better after a very good first half (un-
fortunately, no figures in support).
OH, DEAR. That name Marchant has
returned. We thought it had gone from
us for ever, having long since done a
Second Century or, worse, a Cox Bros,
act, in writing down its 50-cent shares
to ten (then doubling back to make
them 50 cents again). Now it’s done
something quite different to these two
ill-fated shows, one of which stayed in
its old line of business to conduct it on
more conservative lines and get back
to profits and the other . . . well, you
know what happened to Cox Bros.
The fizz having been taken out of
Marchants by British Tobacco, the
company that now returns has nothing
to do with the drinking business and, to
avoid confusion (and perhaps help it
on its new Stock Exchange way), it
should forthwith change its name to
something more suggestive of its new
activities as a holding company for
subsidiaries engaged in real estate
development, building, and motels.
Anyway, what’s it still doing on the
Melbourne Stock Exchange, where few
investors will be interested in a com-
pany whose line of country and most
of its ownership lies in Sydney? Take
it away, please.

Security analysis
The spark in Century Batteries
THE MOTOR INDUSTRY is by far
the greatest customer of storage bat-
teries, taking about 90 percent of the
industry’s output. But they have many
other applications: for example, they
are used for traction in supplying
power to drive fork-lift trucks used in
materials handling and for some heavy-
duty road vehicles (80 percent of all
milk floats in England are battery-
powered), to supply stand-by power for
telephone exchanges, to operate
switches in electric power stations (the
first commercial application of storage
batteries was in power stations), for
home lighting and emergency power
supply, railway signalling, and car
lighting, as the means of propulsion for
non - nuclear - power submarines, for
powering the telecommunications, and
instruments in aircraft.
Transistor radios using dry-cell bat-
teries of carbon zinc have revolutionised
in the consumer mind the concept of
cordless electrical-powered products,
but dry-cell batteries do not have the
capacity to drive heavy-duty industrial
tools, field pumps, golf buggies, and a
new race of storage batteries has been
designed. The beauty of storage bat-
teries is that they are rechargeable -
unlike the dry cells they don’t burn up
their chemical innards to release elec-
tricity. Lead-acid batteries have the
necessary capacity but can’t pack the
power in a tiny enough volume or
weight for the new cordless breed of
electrical-powered products, and here
alkaline batteries have come into their
own.
There is an enormous amount of
battery research going on overseas
spurred by the spacecraft program,
military requirements, and from within
the motor-car industry to devise storage
batteries with a longer life and higher
energy content at a reasonable cost
performance. With the American Gov-
ernment and Congress concerned about
air pollution caused by cars with con-
ventional internal-combustion engines,
the new twist is to come up with an
acceptable economical battery to power
electric cars.
In the meantime, lead-acid batteries
remain the cheapest and most economi-
cal form of storage batteries for start-
ing, lighting, and ignition in conven-
tional motor cars.
As the name implies, Century Stor-
age Battery Co. Limited makes stor-
age batteries and plates, but they make
other products besides. As a result of
diversification in the late 19505, the
company now earns about 40 percent
of its annual turnover from a combin-
ation of photo-engravers zinc, graphic-
art chemicals, and zinc strips and sheet
for building and general purposes. Sales
within Australia represent about 90
percent of turnover and the balancing
10 percent is exported to about 20
overseas countries.
Exports are balanced, about 50 per-
cent each, in storage batteries and in
the zinc-division products, and the
value of exports is growing at the rate
of about 15 percent a year. Century
is Australia’s largest exporter of stor-
age batteries and plates, and in 1963
won the Hoover Award for Export
Marketing.
Century’s decision to manufacture
batteries in Malaysia has paid off hand-
somely. A factory of 15,000 sq. ft.
(since extended to 20,000 sq. ft.) was
built at Kuala Lumpur in 1959, and
45 percent of the equity in the new
subsidiary was sold to local interests.
In 1967, net profit before deducting
tax and outside minority interest for
the Malaysian operation represented
about 15 percent of Century’s group
pre-tax profit.
A further expansionist move overseas
came in 1966, when Gaco Chemical
Products (N.Z.) Limited was formed
(Century’s share 66 2-3rd percent) to
produce graphic-art chemicals in New
Zealand.
There are five major manufacturers
of storage batteries in Australia, who
collectively account for about 90 per-
cent of the industry output, whilst
another 30 to 50 small firms make
up the balancing 10 percent. The
leaders in approximate order are As-
sociated Battery Makers of Australia—
the ABMAL group (“Exide”
“Masse” “Vesta”), Dunlop Rubber
(“Dunlop,” “Marshall”), Century
(“Century,” “Civic,” “Ajax”), Clyde
Batteries (“Clyde”), and Joseph Lucas
Australia (“Lucas”).
ABMAL and Lucas are wholly owned
subsidiaries of major U.K. companies,
whilst Clyde Batteries belongs to the
Clyde Industries stable. Century is be-
lieved to hold about 14 percent of the
Australian storage-battery market, with
about half of its output produced for
private brands and the balance sold
under its own trade names. About one-
sixth of Century’s batteries are sold
as original equipment, and the balance
goes to the replacement market
margins are much greater in the re-
placement side of the business.
The company operates two plants in
Australia, in Sydney (originally opened
in 1928) and Melbourne (opened in
1964), has sales offices in ali the main-
land capital cities and at Young, Tam-
worth, Dubbo, Hornsby (N.S.W.), and
Townsville (Qld.), whilst there are also
nearly 20 independent distributors sell-
ing Century batteries throughout Aus-
tralia. In photo-engravers zinc used
for photographic reproduction in news-
papers and magazines, the company is

the sole Australian manufacturer and
controls about 90 percent of the Aus-
tralian market in graphic-arts chemi-
cals.
Century is also the sole commercial
producer in Australia of zinc strips and
sheets. In the building industry, zinc
products used as guttering, downpipes,
valley, ridging, and roofing are slowly
gaining an increasing share of the mar-
ket it is a lifetime material com-
pared to other products and sells for
one-third the price of copper. In some
markets, zinc sheets are replacing gal-
vanised steel sheets, although it is two-
thirds dearer than the steel product.
There is currently an annual rate
of growth of about 5 percent in storage
batteries, about 4 percent in photo-
engravers zinc and graphic-art chemi-
cals, and about 5 percent in zinc strips
and sheets. The company is technical-
oriented -- its Managing Director,
Albert Luciano, is a M.Sc. of Sydney
University, and all the production
executives are university graduates.
The accent is on quality and quality
control, and the company employs ten
chemists. Good overseas know-how links
are maintained with Stolberger Zink,
West Germany, and with Eagle Picher
Co., U.S.A.

Over the four years 1963-67, total
assets increased by 37.7 percent, pre-tax
profit by 29.7 percent, and earned for
ordinary by 25.7 percent. The down-
turn in 1966 reflected mainly fluctua-
tions in the price of lead. Whilst the
company has shown little capital growth
in earnings per share (the last issue to
shareholders was made in September,
1956, with an issue of two for seven
at par), dividends per share have con-
sistently stood at 7.5 cents since 1961.
Usually the interim dividend paid in
March has been declared at 3.125 cents,
but this was increased to 3.75 cents in
March, 1968, suggesting a dividend for
the year of 8.125 cents. The company
reported a substantial increase in sales
and profits in the December, 1967, half-
year compared with the corresponding
period the year before and the results
for the full year look promising.
SUMMARY: At $1.16, the shares
command a dividend yield of 6.5 per-
cent and a price-earnings ratio of 7.0.
This is a good, safe company, ably man-
aged.

Behind the balance sheets
Full steam for Steamships
IT HAS BEEN all in such a rush.
Steamships Trading Ltd., the Port
Moresby-based island trader, has grown
so fast in the past eight years that its
capital has multiplied by five times, to
$7.4 million, with the result that the
earning rate, dividend, and share price
are all down. So has it all been worth
while? The answer is, clearly, not yet.
But it could be eventually, particularly
for those who buy in at current low
prices in a market that has been pretty
soft since last year’s $2.1 million two-for-
five par issue.
The race to expand is still well and
truly on although the market was
somewhat reassured to learn that the
$3 million mixed property development
recently announced would mean no call
for further equity capital.
The $1 million hotel in Lae, The
Melanesian, completed last December,
will be totally eclipsed in Steamships’
affairs by the latest plans, which com-
prise an international-class hotel, bou-
tiques, and office suites in a 12-storey
building on a newly leased site opposite
the company’s main store in Moresby.
The building will be completed in two
years. In a relatively new departure,
Steamships will finance this venture
wholly fro'm borrowings in Europe.
There will be no strain on Steamships’
liquid resources. The only other loan
moneys used have been the $700,000
loan for general development obtained
in September, 1965, from Common-
wealth Development Finance Co. Ltd.
of London, repayable in 1974 and
1977. In association with this loan
122,000 shares were issued at a prem-
ium to CDFC. The bill for fixed in-
terest in 1967 was $56,000, but bank
overdraft extended from $2,136,000
to $3,299,000 —would have imposed a
considerable burden on profits, although
some of the proceeds of the latest issue
could go toward reducing it. So Steam-
ship trading is changing its character
quite considerably by moving so heavily
into the hotels business. The company
began in the hotel trade about four
years ago with a small hotel at Popon-
detta, near Kokoda, and the acquisition
of the Mt. Hagen Hotel, to which a
new wing costing $154,000 has been
added. There is further scope for hotel
developments in the territories. All
Steamships’ hotels have proved very
successful. Development of tourism, as
recommended by the World Bank, will
be assisted by a new Qantas stopover in
New Guinea en route to Manila and
Tokyo.
It will be some time before these
develop'ments contribute their full
potential to Steamships’ profits. So the
earning rate of Steamships was prob-
ably not maintained in the first half
of the current year —a 40 percent in-
crease would have been necessary be-
cause of the higher capital but
directors have reported that profit was
substantially higher, even before some
new developments were contributing at
all to group finances.
The main contributor to profits re-
mains, of course, the merchandising
operations. The evolution of Papua and
New Guinea from primitive subsistence
to a money economy provides a con-
tinually increasing market for the
island traders. Steamships, however, is
the only major one to concentrate solely
on these areas, without diversifying to
Australia, and without relying on con-
siderable investment income. In the
latest half year, product prices, especi-
ally copra, favored trading, but the
biggest area for improvement was in
costs containment, and there is reason
to believe tremendous improvement
was made. Improved plantation produc-
tion last year was offset by lower prices,
especially for copra. But this year the
typhoon that ruined the Philippines
crop (source of 60 percent of the
world’s copra) has brought improved
prices that should last through 1968.
Most important single factor deter-
mining the general level of expendi-
ture in Papua-New Guinea and the
rate of growth of the economy is the
size of the grants from the Australian
Government. These have risen from
$56 million in 1964-65, to $7O million
in 1966-67, to $7B million for the cur-
rent year. In March, 1967, a $5O mil-
lion loan was sought from the World
Bank for Territory development; with
continuing world pressures to bring
these areas to the stage of self-govern-
ment, their economies must develop at
a rapidly increasing rate.
Takeover of Colyer Watson (NG)
Ltd. in July, 1962, for around $1 mil-
lion in shares, was Steamships’ first ven-
ture from Papua into New Guinea. It
also meant a new foray into coffee
and cocoa marketing.
Steamships’ coastal shipping acti-
vities are primarily a service for the
rest of the group, delivering for the
merchandising activities and collecting
the primary produce, but they are
nevertheless quite profitable. The com-
pany is building a new 65ft. vessel in
its own shipyard, and has contracted
for the building of another.
Since incorporation in 1924, the com-
pany has managed the four publicly
listed rubber companies, Mariboi,
Kere'ma, Lolorua, and Rubberlands,
and shares in these companies account
for 'most of the listed investments,
which were valued on the market at
balance date at $121,000 less than book
value of $204,077. The world price of
natural rubber is determined by pro-
duction of synthetics, and for some
time has not been encouraging to pro-
ducers.
Although the World Bank Mission of
1963 recommended that coconut and
cocoa areas be doubled, Steamships has
apparently no intention of expanding
the plantations side of the business. As
it is, only 18 percent of fixed asset in-
vestment is in plantations and sawmills.
The company owns a sawmill at Bai-
muru, and a subsidiary, Brown River
Timber Co., with valuable timber leases
from which it cuts sawn timber, around
Moresby. A natural extension of this
was the Moresby plant to make timber
dowels and mouldings for the building
trade. Output of this plant, and of
continuous guttering and downpiping,
sheet metal, and of the quarry, is for
local needs.
Other diversifications include pro-
duction of industrial gases in a 40-60
percent partnership with Societe
D’Oxygene, began in March, 1966, and
a new soft-drink factory, which was
built last year at a cost of $103,000
for bottling Coca-Cola under licence.
The co'mpany has no plans to extend
these industrial operations further, and
is concenerating on improving its facili-
ties in wholesale and retail outlets in
eight centres.
The company has valuable agencies
for shipping companies, insurance, and
distributes for International Harvester,.
Vacuum Oil, Carrier Air, and such like.
Capital expenditure has been grow-
ing steadily in recent years, and this
development has been financed by two
issues at 50 percent pre'mium, ratio one-
for-five, in 1963 and 1965; by share
issues to vendors of business acquired;
by placement of 300,000 shares for
$390,000 in 1964 and by placement of
one million 50c shares in July, 1966,.
at 93c, with institutional investors
mainly in U.K.; and finally by the two-
for-five par issue last June.
Additional capital expenditure on
fixed assets in 1966-67 amounted to
$1,681,000, including the $103,000 on
the soft-drink factory, $120,000 on
Kami Coffee Estates, $500,000 on the
Lae hotel construction, $350,000 on new
bulk stores, office extensions and equip-
ment, and new motor showrooms, and
$427,000 on new accommodation for
native and European staff. This is part
of a large investment in staff accom-
modation (at 1963 balance date over
$1 million, and expenditure in the past
two years alone has amounted to
$677,000), which is available at a nom-
inal rent and therefore constitutes idle
capital, but is essential to obtain and
keep employees.
After representations to the tax
authorities, the company obtained a low
depreciation allowance on new staff
buildings from the early ’6os. Since
company taxation was introduced to
Papua and New Guinea in 1959, the
rate has been 20 percent of profits until
1966-67 when the rate was increased


CATARRH
SINUS
ANTRUM
Cleared up without Operation
Here is a treatment completely different from all others. Nothing to take into
the stomach—no drugs, drops, or menthol to be used year after year. Instead,
two inhalations daily for a while. The dry healing fumes come in direct contact
with all the air passages in the head and chest clearing away that offending rub-
bish which causes all the discomfort. Head .noises disappear, hearing and sense
of smell are frequently restored, running eyes and nose and the constant sneez-
ing fits disappear. You wake in the morning with nostrils and throat quite clear,
one handkerchief is sufficient and you are able to mix with others without
embarrassment. Here is a report telling how one very bad sufferer was healed.
A nurse had to give up her work—she suffered dreadfully from Catarrh, with
badly infected Antrum and Sinus, had terrific head noises and was almost stone
deaf—after using Membrosus for a time she wrote,
“Membrosus has worked wonders; I am back nursing again and bless the day
I started using it. I am breathing freely—my head and chest have cleared up —
my hearing is almost normal—and head noises have disappeared. The local
doctor cannot believe /am better—l feel wonderful, thanks to Membrosus."
You, too, can get similar relief by inhaling the wonderful drugless Dry Inhalant
— Membrosus—proved over a period of 40-odd years.

CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for .cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

to 22£ percent. Companies used to pay
provisional tax, but now they pay tax
in the year subsequent to that in which
it was earned. The changeover induced
Steamships to appropriate $251,655 for
tax on 1967 profits payable in the 1968
tax year.
Independent valuation of all free-
holds, leaseholds, and buildings in 1962
(before the Colyer Watson takeover)
showed a $1,371,000 surplus (42 per-
cent over 1962 book value), but the
company felt it was not good account-
ing policy to write the assets up, and
has no present intention of doing so.
The revaluation was a manoeuvre fol-
lowing the March, 1962, takeover offer
from W. R. Carpenter, at the time
worth about s7.3'm. It was rejected
out of hand by directors as inadequate,
and certainly the income aspect was not
very favorable to Steamships’ share-
holders.
But in capital terms, Steamships’
shareholders are worse off. A purchaser
of Steamships shares five years ago for
a price of $l.lO, would now have an
investment worth $127, which costs
him $172, assuming he took up all
issues a 26 percent capital loss. On
the other hand, an investor in Car-
penter five years ago at $2.60 ex the
January, 1963, rights issue, would now
have an investment worth $3OO if he
retained bonus issues, to show a 15 per-
cent capital improvement. Maybe
the current year’s results of Steamships
Trading will occasion a market rally to
close the gap between the two. Steam-
ships shares in the present situation do
not look overpriced, but generally
speaking, the forces which will do
most to strengthen Steamships’ earn-
ings healthier product prices and
greater development in Papua and New
Guinea—apply equally to Carpenter.
Nevertheless, there is more scope for
improvement with Steamships. In May,
1967, anticipating lower profit (pre-tax
profit eased slightly), directors cut in-
terim dividend to 5 percent, so the
year’s payout was then 10 percent, com-
pared with 13.4 percent in 1966, and
13 l-3rd percent in prior years. From
a low of 52c this calendar year, the
shares are staging a fairly solid re-
covery. As last year’s earning rate was
18.6 percent adequately covering the 10
percent dividend (which has been con-
firmed by the 5 percent interim this
year) the scaled-down payout rate
looks safe enough.

The search for offshore oil
SO FAR, it has been a bit of a flop
outside Bass Strait. But offshore drilling
is by far the most exciting and poten-
tially rewarding part of the search for
oil right now. And the failures of recent
months have not discouraged operators
from mounting an even greater search
over submerged potential oilfields in
the remainder of this year.
“Petroleum Newsletter No. 32,” re-
cently released by the Department of
National Development, reflects the ex-
tent to which the search for oil is being
concentrated on the offshore areas of
Australasia. Of the seven stratigraphic
wells reported in this newsletter as re-
ceiving subsidies totalling $2,789,998,
four were drilled offshore from floating
vessels for which the operators were re-
imbursed $2,591,100. In addition,
Wapet’s Peak Island well was subsidised
to the extent of $117,011, so that we
see offshore operations receiving 97.1
percent of the total subsidy allocated in
the December' quarter for stratigraphic
drilling. Subsidised seismic surveys
followed a similar pattern, but the per-
centage of moneys paid for offshore
work was lower at 69.9 percent of
$1,174,039.
Despite the costs involved—which, as
these subsidy figures show, are high
more operators are proposing to drill
offshore. The North West coast is to
become the scene of major activity this
year and will present a challenge to
Victoria for first place in the offshore
drilling stakes, at least in terms of the
number of operators.
Western Australia’s first offshore hole
drilled from a “floater” is expected to
spud late April or early May. This will
be the BOC-Woodside-Shell well, to
be located in the south western portion
of their permit P2I3H, in the vicinity
of Barrow Island and Roebourne. To
drill this well, and a number of others
in their permit areas, the partners are
bringing out a new drilling vessel, the
Glomar Tasman. The location of this
well is only some 70 miles north east
from Wapet’s producing oilfield at
Barrow Island and is to be drilled on
a large anticlinal structure delineated
by extensive seismic surveys. With
favorable geology, as evidenced by
Barrow Island and a closed structure,
this well’s chances must be ranked as
considerably better than an out and
out “wildcat.” Western Australian Pet-
roleum Ltd. (Wapet) is also about to
enter the offshore arena with a float-
ing rig.
Unlike the BOC-Woodside-Shell
craft, which is a self-propelled vessel,
the offshore company’s rig Jubilee is a
self-contained jack-up drilling plat-
form. The first of its type to be used in
Australia, its choice was dictated by the
shallow waters of the Barrow Island
area which is to be the scene of its
initial drilling. Although of 7000 tons
displacement, this platform barge can
float in as little as ten feet of water
which will enable it to be used on the
tidal flats and shallow coral reefs preva-
lent in Wapet’s offshore acreage.
While drilling, the barge stands 20-30
feet above sea level on its four legs and
is able to drill in water depths as great
as 200 feet. Because it is too wide for
the Panama Canal, the Jubilee is
being towed to Australia by way of the
Cape of Good Hope and is expected to
take 140 days to complete the 14,000-
mile voyage.
Upon its arrival at Barrow Island in
mid-August, the rig is expected to first
test the structure to the south of Pasco
Island which recent marine seismic has
indicated. This is undoubtedly the off-
shore culmination of the structure
whose perimeter was tapped by the
Pasco No. 1 and No. 3 wells. If the
results of the No. 1 well can be taken
as a guide, this structure holds consider-
able promise of being a more prolific
producer than the Barrow Island
field. On test Pasco No. 1 flowed 42.2
API gravity oil at the rate of 625
barrels per day from the 5750-foot level
and 415 barrels per day of 44.2 API
gravity oil from the 6000-foot horizon.
Like the lower two producing horizons
at Barrow, the sedimentary section is
Jurassic although the sequence does not
correspond, being 500 to 700 feet
higher at Pasco .and the gravity of the
oil being higher. However, these facts
do indicate the likelihood of the sub-
sea section between the two islands as
also being a substantial reservoir.
Not quite as advanced as Wapet or
the BO.C group but, nevertheless, to
drill this year with a floating rig, is
the Arco-Canadian Superior consortium,
who are the operators in PI27H of the
Bonaparte Gulf. Here, Arco et al have
defined a number of suitable structures
and have contracted with South
Eastern Drilling Company to use the
Sedco 135 G, at present under con-
struction in Japan, to drill the first of
these, commencing in November.
British Petroleum, as the operator, is
to drill an offshore hole commencing
May, but unlike those referred to pre-
viously, this is to be drilled, as so many
of Wapet’s have been to date, on an
island. The hole is to be a 12,000 feet
stratigraphic test on Gun Island in the
Pelsart Group, about 50 miles offshore
from Geraldton. This will be the first
test in this area, although onshore be-
tween Geraldton and Dongara has
been the scene of the Dongara and
Yardarino gas and oil finds by Wapet.
Current maps do not show the area
to lie in a defined sedimentary basin,
although geological and geophysical
work undertaken by the partners indi-

In view of the very large subsidies
provided by the Australian taxpayers,
which most of these offshore wells will
attract, and having written of Wapet,
BOC Arco, and British Petroleum,
the question may well be asked, “What
share does the Australian public have
in this particular sector of offshore oil
exploration?” While in the case of the
BOC-Woodside-Shell group the ques-
tion appears to be answered in the
name, it is not quite that simple. Nor
is it with any of the groups excepting
Wapet. In Wapet, Ampol Exploration
provides the means of entry, for it is a
one-seventh shareholder in Western
Australian Petroleum, and is 63.9 per-
cent owned by Ampol Petroleum with
no large foreign ownership of the re-
maining shares. '
Woodside has a 25 percent interest
in the BOC group while its sister com-
pany, Mid-Eastern, has an 8 l-3rd per-
cent interest. However, there are cross
shareholdings with Mid-Eastern and
in addition Burmah Oil Australia Ltd.
holds, subject to a court appeal, 9 mil-
lion of the 29 million Woodside shares
issued.
With Arco et al, this consortium is
earning a 52 percent working interest,
leaving the balance split between
Alliance Oil Development, 36 percent,
and Alliance Petroleum Ltd., 12 per-
cent, the total working interest being
arrived at after providing a 5 percent
royalty interest to Gulf Oil Syndicate.
Abrolhos Oil N.L., a subsidiary of
Hawkestone Oil Co. Ltd., itself 46.8
percent owned by Longreach Oil Ltd.,
is shortly to float as a public company,
thus providing a direct entry into this
exploration.
Offshore oil search in Western Aus-
tralia is about to move into top gear
and the Australian taxpayer, besides
contributing large sums by way of sub-
sidy, has the opportunity of risking his
capital to participate in what may well
prove to be as rewarding an area as
the Gippsland Basin has been for BHP
shareholders.

THE LAND
Farmers’ unity moves
THERE WAS A TIME, not so long
ago, either, when the Australian
Primary Producers’ Union was in no-
man’s land, a sort of odd man out
among national farming organisations.
The argument ran, in Victoria anyway,
where its main strength lies, that it cut
across the clearly nationally recognised
organisations representing the man on
the land. For this reason it tried in vain
for a long time to convince anybody
outside its ranks that it should have
separate representations on the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference. All
this is now changed, of course, and, in
fact, the organisation has gone from
strength to strength in the past couple
of years, closing its ranks and by good
organisation and public reactions firm-
ing up impressively in the farming
hierarchy.
However, there was always a fair
contention that it did indeed duplicate
the representations of wheat- and wool-
growers in bigger and more powerful
bodies (say, in Victoria, the Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association) even if it
also had its unique aspect in that
within its ranks of heterogeneous col-
lections of farmers, from dairy through
to dried fruit, pig, and mixed farmers
generally, all found it a useful focal
point for their several causes. One has
always felt that the latter interests were
the real backbone of an organisation
whose wool and wheat aspects would
well be catered for more effectively by
the more powerful Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association and, indeed,
that in talking from a minority back-
ground in those industries the present
members of the APPU diluted their
effective voice.
All this is now in the process of
change, because after a long period of
shadow-boxing it looks very much as
though proposals to merge the APPU
and the Victorian Wheat and Wool-
growers’ Association into a Victorian
Farmers’ Union are going through. The
VWWGA’s annual conference unani-
mously ratified the merger arrange-
ments and the APPU is likely to do
so when they are put to its members in
July. At this stage the two other major
rural organisations in Victoria, the
Victorian Graziers’ Association and the
Victoria Dairyfarmers’ Association, are
standing out, though they also were in-
volved in the original merger negotia-
tions. One of the conditions provided
for in the VWWGA’s agreement to the
merger proposals was that representa-
tion of the industry divisions of the Vic-
torian Farmers’ Union on the Aus-
tralian Wheatgrowers’ Federal Council,
on the Australian Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Association, and on the Federal
Produce Divisions of the APPU will
be maintained for not more than two
years after the merger agreement is
signed. In the interim the Victorian
Farmers’ Union will determine which
Federal body its commodity divisions
will be affiliated with after the two-year
period is up.
From this proviso it becomes pretty
clear where the APPU considers its
most useful functions lie; that is, in its
various produce divisions, where it has
been able to produce most effective
results for its members, both in Vic-
toria and nationally, over the years.
Indeed, the merging of these divisions
in the bigger Victorian Farmers’ Union
betokens a great adhesion of strength
to the previously rather specialised
wheat and wool activities of the
VWWGA. Equally, the wheat and wool
industry elements in the APPU should
now improve the effectiveness of their
voice nationally in being co-ordinated
with those in the VWWGA, where, of
course, wheat and wool matters have
up to this been paramount.
The APPU in Victoria gave a taste
of its continued independence of spirit
at a meeting of its wool division last
week, when it was deliberating the
Australian Wool Board’s marketing
report, which of course doesn’t recom-
mend the setting up of a statutory
marketing authority such as the
VWWGA would dearly like to have.
When an amendment to a motion ap-
proving (without prejudice to its exist-
ing policy) the report in principle was
moved, calling for the setting up of a
statutory marketing authority, it was
roundly defeated. Incidentally, the pro-
poser of the amendment (Mr. R. Pol-
lard) seemed to think the report a
toothless object, whereas if the industry
had a statutory market authority it
would go from strength to strength.
“The basic thing wrong with the wool
industry is that it lacks business prin-
ciples. With a statutory marketing
authority a way would be provided for
a more businesslike approach to mar-
keting. The industry will never get any-
where without a board of directors
empowered to act quickly in matters
vital to it.”
Be that as it may, differences with the
VWWGA on the proprieties for wool
marketing are unlikely to delay the
merger, which is symptomatic of a
wider recognition among rural organ-
isations over the whole country that
the farmers must speak with far fewer
voices. Already a large measure of unity
has been achieved among farmer or-
ganisations in South Australia, and com-
posite organisations have also emerged
in Western Australia and Tasmania. In
N.S.W. unity discussions have borne
fruit also, in that negotiations are now
in an advanced stage. However, a
long road has yet to be travelled from
unity in the States to unity at Federal
level, and the consolidation of the com-
modity divisions of the various Federal
organisations, without which unity
could be more apparent than real.

What's impeding this vital discovery?
CSIRO’s DIVISION of Animal Physi-
ology has affirmed its faith in the fea-
sibility of getting sheep to double or
even treble their rate of wool growth
by feeding them small supplements of
treated protein. The organisation has
now taken out a patent on its novel
methods of feeding ruminants so that
the implementation of its discoveries
can be controlled in the best interests of
graziers. Both local and overseas feed
firms are said to be keenly interested,
because although the new techniques
promise to make their greatest
economic impact on the wool industry,
they apply to all ruminants. Dairy, beef,
mutton, and lamb production could also
be lifted to a new level by the judicious
use of the new supplements,
Measurements of the effects of the
feeds have only been made to date in
teims of wool growth. They suggest
that on ordinary farms sheep could be

p rospectj N.S.W., have increased their
rate of wool growth by over 200 per-
cent when given the special protein
supplements. Because meat and milk do
not contain nearly as much protein as
wool, their yield would not be in-
creased to the same extent by the new
feeds. {

commercial scale is not expected to be
unduly costly. Several different methods
of treating the protein in the supple-
ments may be employed, but one of
the most effective relies on formalin,
which is a plentiful and cheap by-
product of the burgeoning plastics in-
dustry. Details of the progress, pros-
pects, and principles of the new feed-
ing techniques are clearly described in
the latest issue of the organisation’s ex-
cellent quarterly journal, “Rural Re-
search in CSIRO.” This magazine, in-
cidentally, should be regarded as essen-
tial reading by every progressive farmer
and student of modern agriculture. It
is a veritable mine of readily accessible
information and costs nothing.
The new proposals for boosting pro-
duction are soundly based on knowledge
gradually acquired over some two de-
cades by the scientists at Prospect con-
cerning the nature of the digestive pro-
cess in ruminants. About 20 years ago,
Dr. I. W. McDonald, who now heads
the CSIRO Division of Animal Physi-
ology, set the ball rolling, though he
probably had no inkling at the time
that his original finding would lead
to revolutionising production from
ruminants as is now apparent. Back in
the mid-1940s he showed that proteins
in the fodder consumed by ruminants
are almost entirely destroyed by the
hordes of micro-organisms that inhabit
the forestomachs of these animals.
Indeed, ruminants get very little of
their protein requirements directly from
the pasture or other fodder. What they
get comes to them second-hand from
the dead bodies of the microbes when
these pass down to the fourth, or true,
stomach, called the abomasum. Hence
the amount of protein that a sheep or
cow gets is controlled by the population
of microbes in the forestomachs. Their
numbers in turn depend on the amount
of plant fibre and other carbohydrate
swallowed by the animal. Therefore,
the productivity of ruminants tends to
be governed by the quantity of pasture
eaten rather than by its quality. This
is why ruminants disappoint when fed
protein-rich fodder. It also largely ac-
counts for Australia’s historical pros-
perity, which was built on the ability
of sheep to thrive on poor-quality nat-
ive pasture. No doubt, too, it is a basic
reason for the economic tightrope under
the feet of those striving to make a
success of wool production.
McDonald’s lead inspired Mr. P. J.
Reis and the late P. G. Schinckel to
conduct a vital experiment. They
argued that if protein was put into the
abomasum directly and so bypassing
the microbes farther up the alimentary
canal a sheep would grow more wool.
By surgical means they arranged for
this to be done. The effect was astonish-
ing. Wool growth far exceeded their
expectations. The results of this import-
ant experiment were announced in
1964. Since then Mr. Reis has shown
that if certain fragments of proteins,
notably the sulphur-containing amino-
acids, are put into the abomasum a
similar effect is obtained. Wool is
largely composed of cystine, one of the
amino-acids built around atoms of
sulphur.
The next and crucial step was to find
a means that farmers could use for
getting proteins or amino-acids past the
microbes unharmed and into the abo-
masum. At this juncture four possible
ways of doing this are being developed.
The most promising employs formalin
to make the protein or amino-acid un-
attractive to the microbes. Protein-rich
meals such as fishmeal, meatmeal,
cottonseed meal, and peanuts and soya-
beans have been treated with formalin
and offered to sheep in the normal
way. Good results with these practical
feeds have been obtained in pen trials,
but it has also been found that formalin
damages some types of fodder and that
more research is needed to work out
the best proportions of formalin to add,
how to mix it properly, and so on. The
next move is to see whether lucerne and
other cheap but relatively poor sources
of protein can be made into formalin-
protected meals at a cost which will be
more than offset by the value of the
extra wool produced.
Another method currently being ex-
plored, which should commend itself
to the sheep farmer’s mind, is the
direct injection of long-lasting amino-
acids. This method may call for some
skill, but most farmers these days have
had plenty of experience in giving in-
jections. Pelleting proteins or amino-
acids in plastic capsules which resist the
microbes but dissolve in the digestive
juices of the true stomach is also re-
garded as a practical technique. The
fourth method that has been tried
works, too, but is mainly of theoretical
interest. It involves giving the sheep a
high-protein diet liberally laced with
common salt. This causes them to drink
heavily. The great intake of water
washes the food through the microbe
zone before its protein can be attacked
to any appreciable extent.
Clearly, the Division has achieved a
breakthrough in ruminant nutrition.
(Breakthroughs are exceedingly rare
occurrences in biological science, and
this is the first time the term has been
applied in this column.) However, the
“Rural Research” article warns that
it will still be a long time before a
farmer can drive into town and order
delivery of a truckload of power-
packed protein supplement. A multi-
tude of relatively minor problems
remain to be solved, and farm-scale
trials have yet to be undertaken,
because only a small team is engaged
on this research and development pro-
ject. This is frustrating. It must have
been obvious to the scientists four years
ago that they were on to something
with immense economic potential.
Neither shortage of men nor money
should be allowed to impede the con-
version of this tremendous discovery
into routine procedure down on the
farm.

In Fear of China. Gregory Clark. Lans-
downe. $3.00.
TWO YEARS AGO Mr. Gregory Clark
emerged by resignation from the
obscurity of the External Affairs Depart-
ment, an earnest young fellow protest-
ing both the lack of intellectual basis
for, and general orientation of, the
Government’s Asian policies. Quickly
embraced by the Vietnam protesters and
projected as a celebrity on their teach-
in platforms, Clark became one of the
leading spokesmen for the Left-wing
line. At times it looked as though he
might eclipse Dr. Cairns as the hero
of the Left, and people spoke of him
as a potential Australian Bobby
Kennedy. But his speaking gave him
very little time to develop, for his posi-
tion, any of the intellectual basis that
he (correctly) criticised his former
bosses for lacking. He became just
another wielder of the slick phrase and
the cliche proposition, backed by selec-
tively culled evidence.
In the first sentence of this work on
Chinese policy, Gregory Clark says it is
a book which “should not have been
written.” It was prepared in haste, he
says, which did not permit time for
proper reflection. His intense feelings
about our Vietnam policy (in his view,
a by-product of China-fear) led him to
publish the book, despite his misgivings
about its quality. It is by implication
only a rough weapon in the rough politi-
cal polemic on foreign policy, not to
be judged as a serious contribution to
intellectual dialogue. Mr. Clark, there-
fore, disarmingly erects a defence for
himself against readily substantiated
charges that he lacks rigor in his argu-
ments, that he conspicuously fails to
document or substantiate his general
assertions, and so on.
It is, therefore, not much use examin-
ing his many arguable points thrown
in along the way, though cumulatively
these become significant in that they
always reflect well on China: e.g., that
in collectivisation China avoided the
■“excesses” of other Communist regimes,
that China has no security police, that
only eight percent of the national budget
goes on defence, and the use of force
against opponents has ceased since the
mid-’fifties, that restrictions on religion
are mild.
His suggestions that the North
Korean 1949 invasion of the south and
the Chinese 1962 invasions into India
were provoked by military incursions
into the Communist countries are on
a credibility par with the Goebbels
claim in 1939 that the Poles had
attacked Nazi Germany and are un-
characteristically crude.
But Gregory Clark follows a con-
fusing trail of propositions. For his first
eight chapters he seems to be out to
prove that China is a very “normal” sort
of power, non-aggressive, concerned
mainly with regaining neighboring areas
traditionally regarded as Chinese. It
entered the Korean War reluctantly and
with limited aims, reacting to American
threats to its security. In Tibet its
actions in imposing its authority were
“legally correct,” and its handling of a
“minority problem” no rougher than
other examples in history. Its bad rela-
tions with India had their origin in
Indian sympathy for Tibetans, and the
Chinese “had reason to believe” that
they had supplied them with arms
against the Chinese. The 1962 invasion
was provoked by Indian attempts to
regain control of border areas claimed
by the Chinese. Relations with Russia
deteriorated from the time of the off-
shore islands crisis, when they refused
nuclear help against the U.S., and have
deteriorated since solely because of the
fact of the Soviet-American detente,
and its confirmation of the status quo
in the Taiwan Straits.
And this is where Clark comes to his
central proposition: “Taiwan is the
primary if not the only obstacle to
normal relations with the U.S.” (page
86), and repeated later: “The Chinese
have no ideological objections to normal
relations with the U.S. provided the
necessary concession is made over
Taiwan . . .” (page 106). If only the
U.S. would withdraw its support from
the Taipei Government and let the
island pass to Peking, its problems with
China would be at an end. There are
at least three huge reasons why this is
ridiculous, and I think that Chairman
Mao himself would endorse several of
them.
1. The force of Chinese nationalism
which gives rise to border claims against
almost all neighboring countries, based
on the territory held by the Manchus
in the early 19 th century. These “his-
torical culprits of unbridled aggression
against China” will, in the words of
Peking, have to make their border
settlement at “the appropriate time.”
As the domestic propaganda basis for
generating support for future clashes,
Chinese schoolchildren have been
brought up on various maps of Asia,
the most remarkable of which is the
famous Li Pei-hua map of 1960 showing
Chinese boundaries extending to take in
all the mainland of South-East Asia,
and huge chunks of India and the Soviet
Union, as well as smaller Japanese
islands.
Together with the xenophobia of the
Great Cultural Revolution its dir-
ected brutalities against diplomatic
missions and foreigners nationalist
chauvinism alone could bring the
country into conflict with any of its
Asian neighbors, and, short of a com-
plete withdrawal from Asia, with the
U.S.
2. The strength and single-mindedness
of China’s ideological commitment to
leadership of world revolution. must
maintain it in conflict with the U.S.
The venerable Chairman himself would,
I am sure, join me in scorning Clark’s
suggestion that his dispute with one
force of imperialism and revisionism is
about anything as piddling as the isle
of Taiwan. It is most patently about
great issues about the correct char-
acter and leadership of world-wide
revolutionary forces, about China’s
rightful claim to be the sole repository
of the true Communist faith, and about
the inevitability and supreme impor-
tance of the destruction of U.S. im-
perialist (and Russian revisionist) power
on this world. Through one medium or
another, almost every hour of the day,
the Chinese proclaim their total com-
mitment to these objectives: “We are
determined to defeat U.S. imperialism,
the ferocious common enemy of the
people of the whole world. This is the
bounden internationalist duty of the
Chinese people.”
What horrible heresy it would be for
a Chinese to suggest that this funda-
mental responsibility be traded for
Taiwan!
3. The current Chinese glorification
of violence and commitment to the use
of military power in pursuit of these
aims is a danger. Gregory Clark,
extraordinarily, contests these facts.
“Glorification and emulation of military
virtues, the creation of a military elite,
the intervention of the military in
politics, the frequent display of armed
might, These features common to mili-
taristic nations in the past do not appear
to be shared by the Chinese.” Clark
evidently does not know that one of the
most sustained and important of recent
domestic indoctrinational campaigns has
been “Learn from the People’s Liber-
ation Army,” that the military control
directly over half the provinces of
China, that Marshal Lin Piao is now
second in godliness only to Mao. And
have we imagined those endless parades
of soldiers and weaponry on television?
Clark makes a great deal of the point

that Mao’s aphorism about power grow-
ing out of the barrel of a gun is 30
years old. So it is, but its contemporary
importance lies in the fact that it is
requoted as a contemporary and rele-
vant truth in most major doctrinal
statements. It is there in the little red
book, “Quotations from Chairman
Mao.” Indeed that important book is
virtually filled with such pronounce-
ments: “War is the highest form of
struggle . . .” “Revolutionary war is the
anti-toxin which not only eliminates
the enemy’s poison but also purges us
of our filth . . .” “The seizure of power
by armed force, the settlement of the
issue by war, is the central and highest
form of revolution . . .” These are the
slogans which are chanted in monot-
onous repetition in China as funda-
mental biblical truths.
Right at the end of the book, Clark
does an astonishing about-face. The
Chinese do after all seek, he quietly
admits, “to promote the spread of
Communism in Asia.” But he hastens
to find this “legitimate.” The U.S.
allowed East European refugees to
“campaign openly for the ‘liberation’
of Eastern Europe,” supported Army
officers against Sukarno in 1958, pro-
vided boats for the unfortunate Cubans
who died in the Bay of Pigs! Clark for-
gets to give the CIA a run in justifica-
tion of Chairman Mao. Apparently
readers of such books are bored by
tales of its notoriety.
China is promoting a legitimate
national interest in seeking the over-
throw of governments which encourage
a Western presence in Asia, Clark con-
tinues, since this threatens Chinese
security. Two points are obvious, first
thalt the U.S. “threat” to China would
not be extinguished by withdrawal of
its forces from Asia. It has bombers
and missiles of intercontinental range.
Clark’s neutralist formula does not
explain Chinese aggressiveness toward
countries which have eschewed U.S.
military support Nehru’s India,
Sukarno’s Indonesia, Burma, Nepal, and
even, to a small extent, Cambodia.
There is now not a single Asian country
in which the Chinese have refrained
from promoting subversive activities of
one sort or another.
Clark does have some points against
the Australian Government. It has been
simple-minded in its statement of
Chinese aggressiveness. China’s actions
in Korea were defensive, and its actions
in Tibet, against the offshore islands,
and against India do not in themselves
provide proof of Chinese expansionism.
The fact is that Chinese expansionism
has not manifested itself because it has
been successfully contained.
The Vietnam War is not part of a
downward thrust by China in the sense
of posing a direct Chinese threat. And
the Vietnamese Communists, like other
Asian Communists, are not Chinese
puppets and would not form a mono-
lithic force against us. It is enough for
us to be worried that they will be like-
minded in their desire for further Com-
munist takeovers and prepared to work
together against imperialists like us.
Despite their deep differences, the poly-
centric Communist world works together
in support of the Vietnamese Com-
munists, and there is no reason why
they should not work together with
Thai, Malaysian, or Indonesian Com-
munists.
There is certainly no case for
generating fear of China. We would
only be justified in fear of China if
Clark had his way and we abandoned
the collective security arrangements
which keep Chinese aggressiveness
mainly exhortatory.
Welcome mutation
By FRANK KING
Three Persons Make a Tiger. Dal
Stivens. Cheshire. $3.75.
IN DAL STIVENS’ new satirical spoof
Ned Kelly rides again as Jed Kell Lee
or, rather, St. Jedward. He is one of
four Christian saints whom the Monkey
King (actual hero of a traditional
Chinese saga) is deputed to find and
return to Buddha. The Monkey King
and his crony, Pigsy, make, during the
saint hunt, some very uncomfortable
Dal Stivens ... pointed satire
and allegorically compelling observa-
tions about Australia and the world.
Deep in the Southern Continent they
contrive to offend the Bunyip. He, poor
monster, is hungry, since the Aurorans
with “poisoned flour and diseases which
I forbear to name in your presence”
have wiped out his accustomed diet of
Aborigines. The two observe the curious
social distinctions of Macropus where
size of genitals determines caste; Apar-
theid, where anal endowment and its
windy manifestations poison both the
air and politics; Euphemoria, where
Pigsy discovers a curious but logical
development of an ossified monarchic
system; Lubberland, among whose sky-
scrapers the rat race has reached a
beautifully inevitable form. But four
Christian saints they cannot find, al-
though, apart from Jed, an old Auroran,
Gros Simonyi seems, with his Franciscan
idealism and powerful newspaper back-
ing, a possible candidate.
The book is handled with an intelli-
gence and gusto that necessarily, at some
levels, invites comparison with Swift
and Rabelais. Words excite Stivens: “A
shrew-swayed, shrew-screwed, shrew-
shagged, shrew-possessed, shrew-
oppressed land! How that Pigsy would
prattle, propound, pronounce, and
pontificate about this pettifogging ped-
ant and his penal principality” is a
sample of the sheer fun of the mock
antique style which the author uses.
For the ancient manuscript of this
book was allegedly rescued by a Dr.
Tzu Hsu, who found it packed round
jars in a Sydney Chinese shop. Tzu Hsu
made the translation from the Chinese
of Wu Yu punning names are only
one facet of Stivens’ joy in the sound of
language. And, from a lustier age than
ours, he is, by this chicanery, able to
borrow an appearance at least of pre-
Freudian unself conscious pleasure in the
external and absurd manifestations of
sexual and physical function.
Pointed as is the satire, and rumbust-
ious as is the adventure, it is not alto-
gether an easy book to read because
of its chaotic organisation. Monkey can
duplicate himself at will and can,
therefore, engage on several adventures
in several places at once with some-
times confusing results. On the whole,
however, “Three Persons Make a Tiger”
is a surprising, welcome, and not unim-
portant mutation in the evolution of
the Australian novel.

The ineffectuals
By JOHN BAXTER
The Nice And The Good. Iris Mur-
doch. Chatto and Windus. $3.85.
BELIEVE, if you can, that a Head of
Department in the British Foreign
Office would gather about him at his
country retreat a variety of disaffected
divorcees, two frustrated teenagers,
some ex-residents of Dachau, and a set
of twins who commune with flying
saucers; that one of his employees
would perform rites of devil worship
in the cellars of Whitehall after office
hours; that the inquiries arising from
the latter’s suicide would resolve all
the entangled relationships, bring the
ex-POWs to an understanding of their
problems, and even put the teenagers
into bed together; accept all this, if you
can, and you may have the potential to
enjoy Iris Murdoch’s newest and most
circumlocutous novel.
The Head of Department is Octav-
ian Gray, another of Miss Murdoch’s
self-sufficient and self-indulgent intel-
lectuals enjoying, in her own words,
“the deep superiority of the socially
secure.” His jovial aura encompasses
all those with whom he comes in con-
tact, specifically the salon which in-
habits his country home, a group in-
cluding his wife, Kate, two unattached
friends of hers with attendant children,
the Grays’ teenage daughter, Barbara,
and a pair of European intellectuals
named Willy and Theo who mope on
the edges dispensing angst and Latin
aphorisms to order. Other characters
include Richard Biranne, divorced hus-
band of Kate’s friend Paula, and John
Ducane, occasional expert in Roman
law and Kate Gray’s not-so-secret
lover.
Miss Murdoch’s cast is a large one,
and when she embarks on a plot of
daunting complexity one is soon out of
one’s depth. It becomes apparent, in
fact, that she sets little store by the
story as such, fobbing us off with the
feeble devices of bad thrillers whenever
we are tempted to let our attention
drift from her characters. It is they
who really engage her mind, and the
variety of their responses to life pro-
vides the core of this book.
Its subject is what she terms “one
of the great paradoxes of morality.”
“In order to become good,” she sug-
gests, “it may be necessary to imagine
oneself good, and yet such imagining
may also be the very thing which
renders improvement impossible.” This
father high-flown concept has, on
examination, a wide application in
modern life, especially among the self-
indulgent intellectuals who people “The
Nice And The Good.”
Kate Gray’s relationship with John
Ducane provides an interesting primer
of the theory. With the amiable and
presumably sexually motivated conni-
vance of her husband, she conducts
with Ducane an autumnal affair in
which casual kisses in a drowsy grave-
yard and occasional beachside romps
stand in for more serious confronta-
tions. Virtuously she confesses to Octa-
vian her interest in Ducane, to be re-
warded by his jolly passion. “How
lovely it is,” she muses, “to be able
to fall in love with one’s old friends.
It’s one of the pleasures of being
middle-aged . . The pleasure fades,
however, when a blackmailer reveals
that Ducane has a girlfriend in London
whom he is unable or unwilling to dis-
card, and Kate finds herself delivering
to her lover the sort of speech which
only Noel Coward’s malicious wit seems
capable of rendering adequately in
print. The point, however, is made;
good, nice, lovable, intelligent Kate has
fallen victim to the paradox which
Miss Murdoch expounds relentlessly.
She is not alone in her misery. Her
friends Paula and Richard, divorced
after a ludicrous scuffle in which he
upended the family billiard-table on to
her lover’s foot, resulting in its ampu-
tation, indulge their need to “behave
like sensible adults” by maintaining
separate and unsatisfying menages,
sublimating their needs by flirtation
with domesticity or homosexuality.
Following the dictates of her conscience
to do the right thing, Paula encourages
the attentions of her lover, now lurk-
ing fashionably in remote Australia, and
prepares herself for the sacrifice of
marrying him. Fortuitously he meets
another girl on the boat back to Eng-
land and decides to marry her, destroy-
ing Paula’s carefully constructed
gesture. Nothing is left but a return to
logic and her husband.
This reconciliation and a number of
others throughout the book are
engineered in a burst of clear-thinking
by John Ducane, who is able, after a
flirtation with death by drowning, to
see clearly the essential confusion in
which those around him live. A high-
camp cupid, he strings couples together
with smooth assurance, untangles his
own personal life, and solves also the
thimblerig mystery which motivates
most of the plot. The revelation which
induces this is, unfortunately, slightly
deficient, a pale epiphany expressed by
Miss Murdoch as “. . . it is in the
nature of life to discern good, and the
best love is in some part at any rate
a love of what is good.” Unite, then,
the good with the good, the nice with
the nice, and all is solved.
If one can accept the essential simple-
mindedness of this attitude to human
relations, there is much in “The Nice
And The Good” to interest the writer’s
regular followers. It is a long book,
but smoothly written in a pale cream
and gold style which exhibits Miss
Murdoch’s unfailing good taste in
phrasing. Perhaps it is the ineffectuality
of the characters which gives the novel
its feeling of lassitude, though one
wonders if modern writing has not made
books like this as old-fashioned as the
rock-collecting and Dan Dare-type
flying saucers which the twins find of
such interest.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Living inside a sculpture
by SANDRA HALL
WHEN THE Western Australian Min-
ister for Development, Charles Court,
opened Frank Hodgkinson’s recent
exhibition in Perth, he said the expatri-
ate Australian painter had brought a lot
of Spain to Western Australia. Now
perhaps he could take some Western
Australian influence back to Spain.
Hodgkinson, whose home is in
Majorca, has just completed a month’s
tour of the Kimberleys at Court’s invi-
tation, followed by two weeks in Syd-
ney, where a collection of his vibrant
Spanish paintings are on exhibition at
David Jones’ gallery. He is returning
to Spain with a notebook full of
sketches and notes about the Kim-
berleys, which he plans to translate into
paint for a Perth exhibition in Septem-
ber. But, for the main part, Hodgkin-
son’s intentions are firmly fixed in
Europe at least for the next ten
years.
“I’m very excited about Australia
and what’s been happening here, but
there’s still so much going on in
Europe that I couldn’t come back for
a while. It’s not so much the paintings
I’m seeing as the people I talk to.”
Among them is the English painter
Victor Pasmore, who, with other
European and American painters, be-
lieves that art is becoming increasingly
part of environment that houses will
become pieces of art in themselves, that
small paintings and pedestal sculptures
have no purpose any more, that paint-
ings should be large enough to cover a
wall, and that sculptures, if they aren’t
big enough to live inside, should be
small enough to carry in your pocket
or fondle in your hand.
Hodgkinson, influenced by these
theories, has built and sold five sculp-
tured houses in Majorca, and lives in
one himself with his Irish wife, Phyl-
lida, and their two-year-old son, Leon.
“The peasant cottages in Spain are
all sculptured walls often lean with
crooked door frames for which the
doors have been carefully cut on a
slant to fit perfectly. And it’s all done
with no feeling of self-consciousness.
The walls are a metre thick, and when
they want a shelf, they build one into
the wall, so that walls becomes sort
of moving sculptures. I’ve built modern
versions of this. Ours,” he said with a
frankly delighted smile at such opulence,
“has five bathrooms and a swimming-
pool. It’s a U-shape, which protects an
enclosed terrace.”
In Majorca Hodgkinson paints nine
hours a day, in addition to spending
two hours each morning at work on
the houses (“our secondary industry
which is rapidly becoming our primary
industry”), and he and his wife employ
50 workmen (“all the able-bodied men
in the village”) on their construction.
“I usually act as a sort of overseer,
which means I walk round looking at
things carrying my son on my shoulders.
But Phyllida is a tour de force
organising the workmen and the
deliveries of all the materials. She
makes sure the men get coffee and
cognac twice a day, then we have a
day-long fiesta at the completion of
each house.”
When he is not concerned with houses,
Hodgkinson, relaxed and fluent, with
black-grey hair, deep tan, and wide,
white smile, carries on his painterly
inquiry into the Spanish temperament.
“I’ve been visiting Spain for years,
but when I first went to live in Majorca
five years ago I was working on an
Australian series of paintings. It petered
out, and I thought it was pointless to
go on painting Australia while I was
living in another country, so I started
my Spanish paintings. I suppose the
vastness and aridity of Spain, which is
like Australia in a way, appealed to
me first. Then I got more and more
interested in the Spanish character.
“The Spaniards’ attitude to death
fascinates me. They accept it as part
of life. Death is called the intruder,
and they feel they should go out and
challenge him they prefer death by
violence, rather than dying in bed from
an illness, because they feel they can
give death meaning with violence. I
couldn’t live that way because I hate
violence, but it’s certainly interesting
to paint.”
In his paintings Hodgkinson has
attempted “to reduce things to their
essence,” using the Spanish national
colors, red and yellow, but sharpening
their ‘blood and sand’ quality into
vividness. Some are based on the poetry
of Lorca, others on the bullfight.
“I see the bullfight as a taming of
the bull temperamentally the torero
mesmerising him with personality. It
reminds me of the Roman myth about
the god who, when he killed the bull,
overcame his own bestial passion. It
was a kind of cleansing act, and bene-
ficial products sprang up from the body
of the bull. It’s a mixture of mythology
and realism, with something of the
Frank Hodgkinson...a painterly
inquiry into the Spanish temperament
spiritual, that appeals to me more than
Christianity.”
Hodgkinson exhibits in London every
two years, and has made two trips ta
the United States, the last in 1965,
when he had a show in New York.
“New York is the scene at the moment,
and you have to keep going back and
looking at it, even if you’re not part
of it.
“It’s become almost a game of ideas
there of one-upmanship, where the
aim is to date the other man as quickly
as possible. If he brings something out,
you must go a little further. It’s tre-
mendously exciting and amusing to see
this going on, because they’re deliber-
ately trying to develop a definite Ameri-
can school. Whether this is a good or
a bad thing I don’t know.”
Jlodgkinson’s Western Australian
tour took in all the mining and in-
dustrial towns from Port Hedland to
Broome, but the State’s wildlife, rather
than its industrial development, com-
municated to him as a painter.
“The wildlife, the bird life the
minutiae of growth amid all the vast-
ness that’s what I’ll be painting.
The industry doesn’t fit into my work,
I’m afraid, unless it’s in contrast with
the picturesqueness of the remains of
the early towns. There’s something very
poignant about these places, with their
decaying buildings where nobody lives


anymore. And I’d like to play that off
against the modern pioneering.
“The Aborigines up there interested
me, too. Then I’ve done a series of
drawings in the Broome jail, which is
very well run for what it is, but still a
sordid place. What interested me was
that men of all nationalities are there
Aborigines, Malays, Chinese, Japan-
ese, white men, and even a few Fili-
pinos. The same in the bars in Broome
all drinking together, and all getting
on well together.”

Opera
Making sense
of Mozart
by JOHN CARGHER
The Magic Flute (Mozart). Tannhauser
(Wagner). Elizabethan Trust Opera
Co., Princess Theatre, Melbourne.
LOCAL BOYS make good; it’s as
simple as that. The Trust’s “Magic
Flute” may get most of its magic from
the brilliant conducting of Carlo Felice
Cillario, but its strength lies in its fine
cast (local), a fine production (local),
and fine designs (local). Between them
they almost manage to make sense of
Mozart’s masonic gobbledygook. The
use of slides and modern abstract
designs really works for once, and if the
flow of the numberless scenes is not
always completely smooth, it is vastly
more rapid than it could ever be in any
traditional staging. Stefan Haag has
wisely decided to drop the broad
comedy which normally ruins produc-
tions in English and his collaboration
with designer Desmonde Downing
results in a most satisfying production.
The greatest asset of the scenic and
musical picture is Robert Gard’s
Tamino, who is truly the central figure
of the action, as he should be and too
rarely is. Gard looks like a young Sieg-
fried and acts and sings far better than
any imported tenor the Trust could
afford. He is backed by a solid cast
almost without weakness. Rosemary
Gordon and Neil Warren-Smith are
vocally, visually, and dramatically fine
as Pamina and Sarastro. Ronald
Maconaghie strikes just the right note
of pathetic non-burlesque as Papageno.
But the gems which lift the average
standard abnormally are not so obvious.
John Pringle’s impressive debut in a
serious role, as the Speaker; a most
beautiful voice, superbly projected, adds
Immensely to the action. Robin Gor-
don’s Monostatos is judged to perfec-
tion. The three Attendants of the
Queen of the Night, often played by a
star trio overseas, are sung equally well
Neil Warren-Smith (Sarastro) and
Rosemary Gordon (Pamina) in
Mozart’s “The Magic Flute”
by three local ladies with fine voices
and distinct personalities, Betty West-
water, Maureen Howard, and Diane
Holmes. The three boys, however
anatomically incorrect, were almost as
good (Joan Shute, Mary Hayman, and
Beryl Biggs). An evening full of joy
which is not spoiled by the tentative
singing of the immature but fine voice
of Helen Kerby as the Queen of the
Night.
The Melbourne “Tannhauser” must
be mentioned for two cast changes of
some worth. Ronald Maconaghie’s
unexpected appearance as Wolfram
may prove the artistic event of the
season. This was singing of truly inter-
national standard which shows what
permanent employment in opera can
do for local talent. His “Blick ich
umher” had a Fischer-Dieskau-like
lyricism.
Robin Gordon sang Walter von der
Vogelweide with the most immaculate
German diction imaginable and proved
a great asset in the ensembles. The cast
change needed in “Tosca” because of
Tito Gobbi’s departure was less for-
tunate. Raymond Myers certainly has
the right voice, but for some reason he
chooses to act Spoleta instead of
Scarpia.

Starched sky
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Les Demoiselles de Rochefort.
Director, Jacques Demy.
The Happening. Director, Elliott Sil-
verstein.
AS ONE WHO has always effortlessly
resisted the specialised appeal of
Demy’s movies, I fell all the harder for
“Les Demoiselles de Rochefort.” This
musical is no cinema landmark, cer-
tainly, but it’s lively, pretty, and has
undeniable charm.
To judge by “Lola” and “The
Umbrellas O.f Cherbourg” I haven’t
yet seen “Baie des Anges,” which
sounds as if it might have its feet more
firmly on the ground—Demy is a senti-
mentalist, a misty-eyed dreamer, a con-
fessed believer in true love, tremulous
maidenhood, youthful idealism. These
juvenile attitudes, to me quite un-
acceptable when applied to a sup-
posedly serious theme, fit delightfully
into the unrealistic framework of a
romantic musical set in a Rochefort
that never existed, where the only love
worth considering is love at first sight,
where separated lovers are always re-
united, where you inevitably find your
ideal mate.
The improbable events of a festival
weekend at Rochefort are recorded in
enchanting color photography, in which
not only the costumes but the houses,
the people, even the sky look as if
they’ve been washed, starched, dried in
the sun, and then ironed crisp. Demy
uses bright, clear pastels and in the
scenes in the music store, an almost
completely white decor to lend a dis-
arming unreality to his wispy, oddly
engaging fairytale.
A good deal of the film’s appeal
comes from a talented and remarkably
personable cast, headed by Catherine
Deneuve and Francoise Dorleac as the
young girls of the title. Gene Kelly
bounces back as if he’d never been
away, and such improbable players as
Danielle Darrieux and Michel Piccoli
seem remarkably at home in this airy
musical.
Nothing could be further from the
sentimentality and romantic prettiness
of “Les Demoiselles” than “The
pening,” a harsh, disillusioned, mor-
dantly funny movie deserving a wider
showing than it has been afforded in
Sydney. In a deceptively jolly, free-
wheeling style, Elliott Silverstein’s film
strips the pretensions from various
aspects of modern life the “good
life” of the rich reformed mobster, the
supposed freedom of the hippie drop-
outs. The movie is an ultimately
alarming look at contemporary society,
but it never preaches; indeed it is ex-
citing, swinging entertainment.
Anthony Quinn, who can for me
make any film worth watching, plays
the prosperous ex-gangster who’s kid-
napped almost inadvertently by a quar-
tet of beatniks who, having nothing
real to do, amuse themselves by acting
out a fantasy. But the gangster believes
in their evil intentions, and their foolish
game has the unexpected result of
showing him the unreality of the wall
of wealth, loyalty, and affection that
he’s built around himself.
It’s a savage film, quite free of any
comforting insulation of faith in the
basic good of human nature; but it’s
extremely funny and as brutally stim-
ulating as a plunge in an icy surf.

Revelations by
expatriates
by ELWYN LYNN
Arthur Boyd. Kym Bonython’s Gallery,
Sydney.
Frank Hodgkinson. David Jones’, Syd-
ney.
CURRENTLY two expatriates, Frank
Hodgkinson, away five years, and
Arthur Boyd, nine, reveal the course
of their imaginations; Boyd’s magnifi-
cently sustained saga on Nebuchadnez-
zar includes 17 works not seen in
Adelaide, and these are more savagely
expressionist. In Fallen on a Field,
Nebuchadnezzar turns white as yellow
flames curl from his back and, on the
green earth beneath the bitter green
sky, crimson flowers ring him; which
is which when he’s with the hunter as
the black ram embodies Nebuchadnez-
zar’s passions? He catches on fire on a
starry night, spans the painting (in
the way Boyd’s figures have done since
Arthur Boyd at work
1942) as he is held by an Australian
soldier, and fangs of flame blaze from
him by the waterfall. In such works
the intensity of the lyricism is pushed
beyond the rapturous color of White
Nebuchadnezzar Wailing and In a Bed-
of Lilies to an expressionist turmoil
of pigment that enables Boyd to reveal
the world metamorphosed through the
abject fears and creative delusions of
grandeur of Nebuchadnezzar.
Boyd no longer uses nature as a foil;
he is no longer the commentator; in
the Half-Caste Bride series Chagallian
bouquets grew from figures’ ears with
a surreal dissociation, but here they
sprout as naturally as the flowers of
the field from the king’s tattered, riven
body. The works have, in fact, a cre-
ative naturalness that has little to do
with the Biblical or historical Nebu-
chadnezzar, and raise no issues of illus-
trative appropriateness.
It’s a totally different matter with
Hodgkinson; Boyd fruitfully re-examines
his work of the ’forties, Hodgkinson re-
verts to his decorative, glowing shrimp
and lobster hues of the late ’fifties. Un-
like Boyd, he wants to tie his recent
works to the atmosphere of Spain, to
its “abrupt and seductive red and yel-
low national flag” and to Lorca’s
poems, extracts of which, inserted in
the catalogue, show that these lambent
and seductive canvases, with abstract
designs and references to reality, have
nothing of the starkness and Imagist
force of those lines dedicated to a dead
bullfighter: “A pail of lime prepared
and ready,/At five in the afternoon . . .
Oh, white wall of Spain, Oh, black
bull of anguish.”
In the paintings and the bronze
sculptures there is not the coherence
with Lorca that Hodgkinson seeks; the
bronze, severe-enough figures have
Rodin-like impressionist surfaces, but
the paintings on which they sit or stand
against do not “extend the space,
painter’s space,” as Hodgkinson says
in his introduction, as they are about
decorous, abstract areas and lines. For
all his literary evidence there is not
much visual proof that he is as
impressed with the Spanish tragic view
of life as he was in his funereal texture
works of the early ’sixties. One harps
on this a little for Mr. Hutchings,
reviewing this work in Perth’s “Critic,”
said Hodgkinson emerged “as a con-
siderable painter indeed,” and Mr.
Hodgkinson has been locally reported
as saying that he did not expect to
find any advance in Australian painting
on his return. ;
Harsh as it may sound, Hodgkinson
has not advanced; his view of Spain
is not Lorca’s, but a tourist’s; David
Boyd, much less of a painter, is closer
to reality with his old-hat notions of
God and State domination. When sun
and bull are combined in exploding
mosaics of color we simply have the
superficial liveliness of some Paris
painting; even in the pleasant, reddish
refulgence of At Five in the After-
noon the matador is tossed rather
fastidiously, and the swords and
banderillas in three similar paintings
are tired embellishments rather than
weapons of destiny. In Death of
Ignacio Sanchez Mejias there is some
anguish, but whereas Lorca’s images
evoke grim associations, this corpse
creates heartless, flat abstract patterns
around it. He’s died in a Paris studio,
not in the dark morgue near the
arena.
Hodgkinson’s technical range, sure
sense of serene color, and happy de-
ployment are undiminished, but his
view of Spain is not giving him that
thematic impetus that Nebuchadnezzar
has given.

AUSTRALIAN ARTHUR BOYD
Arthur Boyd's latest exhibition of oils opened
. a i i •< c . , , . -ml
at the Adelaide restival and also Will be
shown in Sydney and Melbourne.
ARTHUR BOYD is among the
most distinguished Australian
painters; his stature has increased
yearly since he left to live and
work in England in 1959. With
Dobell, Drysdale, and Nolan he is
among the best-sellers of Australian
art, and his latest exhibition
now on view at the Bonython
Gallery, Sydney, after opening at
the recent Adelaide Festival has
been a distinctive financial success.
Of 58 paintings in the exhibition,
26 were sold before the Sydney
opening for a total of more than
$60,000
Boyds expressionism on this
occasion deals with the dream of
Nebuchadnezzar, a tyrannical figure
in the Old Testament. There is
Nebuchadnezzar with a Crying Lion

little apparent relationship between
the Nebuchadnezzar of the Bible
and that on Boyd’s canvas; he
appears to deal with him as a
desperate lunatic and has trans-
ported him to an Australian land-
scape. The theme is strong evi-
dence of Boyd’s early fascination
with “the beast in man and the
man in beast.”
Boyd first exhibited in Australia
in 1937. It wasn’t until he went
overseas that his popularity in Syd-
ney began to match that in his
hometown of Melbourne. He has
sent back paintings for seven Aus-
tralian exhibitions since 1959, and
now he himself is returning. He is
due to arrive by boat at the end
of April for a visit.

Theatre-Restaurants
Reviving Broadway’s best
by DENIS O'BRIEN
WHEN Broadway’s durable musicals
have been counted on the fingers of
both hands, there aren’t many left that
itch for recognition in 1968. Jon Ewing,
though, already is counting on a third
hand and has thought of another four
or five musicals he hopes to revive be-
fore the end of the year. After that,
there might be a shortage of titles
suitably free of conditions, but someone
recently suggested an inspection of the
Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire, and
he’s thinking about that.
Ewing, a young actor-director grad-
uate of the Ensemble Theatre, has in-
herited from Hayes Gordon the job
of producing edited versions of some
of Broadway’s most esteemed musical
plays in the Emperor Room, a 450-
seat theatre-restaurant on the first floor
of Sydney’s Menzies Hotel.
Sixteen months ago the hotel with-
drew from the chancy competitiveness
of big-star cabaret and asked Mr. Gor-
don to inaugurate a policy of mini-
musicals with a professional company.
He opened with “Oklahoma!” and pro-
duced six other shows before accepting
the lead in the Williamson production
of “Fiddler On the Roof,” one of the
diminishing supply of musicals still last-
ing long enough on Broadway to be
exported outside an LP album. Jon
Ewing (Gordon’s successor and one-
time protege) is now readying a pro-
duction of “Little Me” his fifth
show for the Emperor Room.
“We are catering,” says Ewing, “for
an Australian audience which still has
a fond regard for the American musi-
cal.” Sometimes his company also
caters for audiences determined to do
the entertaining themselves; he remem-
bers one traumatic night when a bunch
of clothing manufacturers, in town for
a convention, almost ruined a perfor-
mance of “Bye Bye Birdie” with their
demonstrative celebrating. “There was
nothing we could do. After all, the
people that employ us are, primarily,
hoteliers. It’d be foolish to do a Bassey
and demand a suspension of service
during performances.”
The company which controls the
hotel spends about $5OOO a week on
the production of its mini-musicals and
quotes an average price of $l2 a head
(cover charge, meal, liquor, and danc-
ing after the show) to cautious'patrons
who aren’t on expense accounts. Of the
five principal theatre-restaurants now
flourishing in Sydney (and permanently
employing close to 100 professional en-
tertainers between them), the Emperor
Room is narrowly the most artistically
ambitious. Ewing and Hayes Gordon
before him have aimed their produc-
tions at a point midway between the
audience for conventional musical
theatre and that for the spontaneous
participation encouraged at the Music
Hall. Allowing for the unreliability of
human behaviour under the influence of
expense-account expansiveness the aim
is usually nicely judged.
Ewing edits about 30 to 45 minutes
of running time out of each original
musical to try to achieve a production
lasting about 90 minutes. Usually he
retains most of the music, and sacrifices
dialogue which doesn't lead to a high
point. He never has any trouble with
authors or their agents over the editing.
“It’s a customary technique for stock
company productions in the U.S., and
we pay stock company royalties, which
are less than the professional rights.”
Several Emperor Room productions
have been of musicals never before seen
in Australia (“Gypsy,” “Out Of This
World,” “Bells Are Ringing”); nostal-
gists have been able to look again at
such Broadway charmers as “Briga-
doon,” “Kiss Me Kate,” and “South
Pacific.” Only a few Rodgers and
Hammerstein titles are available be-
cause Richard Rodgers is unwilling to
have his shows cut in any way; stock
company rights to “Guys and Dolls”
and “West Side Story” two musicals
Ewing most wants to produce are
elusive.
Ewing mounts each of his productions
with a cast of about 20, including 12
dancer-singers. His principals have star
quality, and sometimes are stars sud-
denly left without a stage from which
to shine Nancye Hayes, for example.
After her big-star build-up by J. C.
Williamson for “Sweet Charity,” Miss
Hayes was sphering the let-down of
theatrical neglect after the show ended
its Australian season. Now she’s back
at the Emperor Room in “Bells Are
Ringing” and rehearsing for “Little
Me.” It’s unfortunate that Broadway’s
supply of durable musicals seems to be
the limiting factor to the whole enter-
prise.
The theatre-restaurant boom in Syd-
ney has helped to give entertainers
more hometown employment security
than any time since the collapse of
commercial radio serials robbed them
of their breed. The Menzies mini-
musicals, for example, offer pay rates
equivalent to the J. C. Williamson
average without the tortures of having
to tour. And with a 9 p.m. start an en-
tertainer has time to tape a TV appear-
ance in Melbourne and be back in
Sydney by showtime.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
See Naples
and die
fat but happy
IF FRENCH is the language of love,
then Italian is an agonised call from
the waistline. Italian food, some of the
best and most interesting of any pre-
pared in the world, is unquestionably
not slimming. It has the further disad-
vantage of being sufficiently stimulating
to the palate to tempt one to second
and third helpings and to encourage
one to sample the dessert.
But if you think this is going to be
an article about cooking spaghetti,
you’ve got another think coming. One
of the great things about Italian food
is that there is plenty of pasta if
you like it but there is an infinite
variety of far more stimulating food.
This is one of my main gripes with
Italian restaurants in Australia. There
is really no need to be as repetitive as
most of these establishments appear to
be. They open a restaurant with a set
menu and stick to it, word for word,
until they close or change the manage-
ment.
Trattorias, the traditional eating
places of Italy, where one goes strictly
for food that is good and not expen-
sive, do not, in the true sense of the
word, exist in Australia. The cook of a
trattoria goes to market and sees what
is a good buy on a certain day, makes
his choice, and then returns to the
restaurant to prepare his dish. That is
precisely what a good housewife should
do. Handling a menu in that way one
gets variety and keeps an eye on the
budget.
Sardines, rich in vitamins and very
cheap to buy, make a most appetising
first course or, with a salad, provide an
ample luncheon. First you have to find
a fish shop that caters for immigrants;
here you will find fresh sardines. The
local fish-and-chip shop is not a likely
venue they haven’t got enough imag-
ination.
A pound and a half of sardines will
be sufficient (as a starter) for four
people. Clean the sardines and remove
heads. Split on one side and bone.
"Wash and dry. Prepare a marinade by
mixing a teaspoon of powdered mus-
tard, l teaspoon of pepper, 1 tablespoon
of chopped parsley, \ teaspoon oregano,
3 tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of
lemon, and 1 tablespoon of chopped
anchovies. Let the sardines steep in the
mixture for at least an hour. When
required, remove from marinade, flour,
dip lightly into a beaten egg, and fry
in hot olive oil. Serve with lemon.
Veal is very popular in Italian
cookery, probably because beef there is
usually slaughtered too young and sold
too fresh, or flattened with great
cleavers that remove the best juices.
Cotolette alia Piemontese requires large
thin fillets of veal. Allow two fillets per
person. G.n one half of each fillet place
a slice of mozzarella cheese, a slice of
salami, and some chopped shallots, and
parsley. Fold the fillet over the filled
half and secure the open end with a
toothpick. Dip each fillet into beaten
egg, then breadcrumbs, and fry in a
mixture of butter and oil until browned.
Approximately 5 minutes on each side.
In the meantime prepare a sauce to be
served over the fillets by melting two
ounces of butter in a saucepan. Add a
small tin of anchovy fillets, finely
chopped, a dash of pepper, 2 table-
spoons of chopped parsley, and the
juice of 1 lemon. Remove the tooth-
picks from the veal and pour the sauce
over each fillet.
This dish is excellent served with
Risotto alia Milanese, a bright yellow
rice prepared with saffron (probably
the most expensive spice in the world,
because each thread must be hand-
picked from a special kind of crocus
flower). Place 2 cups of rice into a
saucepan; add 1 teaspoon of saffron
threads and 4 cups of cold beef broth
(beef consomme will do). Add 1 tea-
spoon of vegetable extract, such as vege-
mite, and bring to the boil, stirring
occasionally. Reduce heat, cover, and
simmer for 15-20 minutes when the
liquid will be absorbed and the rice
tender. Remove from heat and stir in 1
cup of grated Parmesan cheese and a
good dollop of butter.
Italian desserts are manifold. There
are rich, alcoholic cakes, fruity ices, and
crisp macaroons. After a particularly
filling meal just a piece of Torrone
(nougat) may be served with black
coffee. (Motta makes an excellent one,
now obtainable here.)
For an occasion when you require
something out of the box, I would
recommend a nut pudding. You will
need -Jib. of nuts: walnuts, hazelnuts,
pistachios but not almonds. Pound
the nuts together with -|lb. of castor
sugar until they are a smooth, oily mass.
Stir in £lb. of grated bitter chocolate
and, when well blended, add 5 egg-
yolks well beaten. Add 1 heaped table-
spoon of grated orange rind, 1 level
teaspoon cinnamon, and £ cup of
brandy or rum, and a dash of salt.
Fry a cup of fresh breadcrumbs in
butter until golden. Butter a shallow
baking dish and cover the bottom with
the fried breadcrumbs. Beat the egg-
whites very stiff and fold into nut mix-
ture. Pour over crumbs and bake at 325
degrees for half an hour.
And, if after all this you’re still
worried about your waistline, stick to
the language of love (although it does
give you an appetite).

LETTERS
Art and art critics
During a visit to the art exhibition
at Sydney’s Royal Easter Show last
week I was reminded of the letters
Messrs. Lynn and Brook have been
exchanging in recent issues of The
Bulletin. Their subjects—art, criteria,
excellence, fallibility, etc. seemed
really wayout when one faced up to,
presumably, the kinds of paintings they
are writing about. Beyond one or two
of the Show exhibition’s sectional
winners, there were another half dozen
works which had any value to my lay
eye; which only a few months earlier
had been refreshed by more obviously
modern paintings exhibited around the
street-level fence of a city building pro-
ject. The contrast made me wonder.
Perhaps Messrs. Lynn and Brook could
explain?
Simon Raye
Sydney, N.S.W.
I am trying very hard to follow the
very noble argument in your Letters
column between the two distinguished
art critics Mr. E. Lynn and Mr. D.
Brook. So far as I can understand the
point seems to be: is a work of art a
work of art before you look at it or
after? Before you talk about it or after?
The point is delicate indeed and I
would not dare to take sides.

Twelve thousand memories
I was delighted with Miss Sandra Hall’s
flattering account of my Index project
in “Australian Film Guide,” in the cur-
rent issue of The Bulletin.
However, there was one error
doubtless on my part which I would
like the opportunity to correct. When I
said that we see “more bad American
pictures than good,” I did not mean to
imply that the number of bad Ameri-
can pictures outweighed the good
far from it! What I meant was that in
Australia we see more bad American
pictures than good Continental films.
Also, there is another thing you
might perhaps help me with. We are
encountering a little difficulty tracking
down details of some films especially
in the early sound period, though there
are even some films in the ’forties that
have defied our efforts to obtain infor-
mation on. I was wondering if any of
your readers had old stills, or clippings
and scrap-books, or old fan magazines
' — these often prove a very useful
source of information. If anyone hold-
ing this sort of material could contact
me, it would be of great assistance.

Manning Clark's misfits
While I have not read Manning
Clark’s book “A History of Australia,
Vol. II,” I have read his “Short His-
tory of Australia,” and would generally
agree with Peter Coleman’s review (8.,
March 30) of Manning Clark’s literary
style.
However, in my view, Manning
Clark’s “Short History of Australia” is a
little gem, and should become a classic
of Australian literature. Not that
Clark’s somewhat pessimistic humanism
and clinical detachment are the only
way of looking at history, but that his
style is a useful corrective to both the
more physical portrayals of history and
the conceited man-centred philosophies
of the Christian sects (with their an-
thropomorphic God) and the more
smug type of humanist (with “Man is
the measure of all things”).
Personally, I class his “Short His-
tory of Australia” with H. G. Wells’
“Short History of the World,” and
recommend them to nationalists and
internationalists alike.

Towering Tchaikovsky
A Sydney Prom Concert this year in-
cluded Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 1
—the first performance in 20-odd years;
not a mention in The Bulletin’s notice.
The 1968 first subscription concert
included the same composer’s Sym-
phony No. 4 (described by Hans Kel-
ler also a Mozartian —as “one of
the most towering symphonic struc-
tures in our whole literature”); The
Bulletin’s notice barely mentions the
composer’s name.
What gives, Mr. Frolich?

The real origin of money
The title of Peter Samuel’s article
“Where Should the Money Come
From?” (8., Feb. 24) prompts me to
ask: where does all money come from,
anyhow?
A realisation of the real origin of
money could bring about an entirely
new light on the financial woes of the
States. What is essential in these cir-
cumstances is not more argument about
the appointment of taxes and loan
raisings but a challenge to the present
operations of the monetary system.
This is the fundamental issue in-
volved. It is idle to argue about the
effects of a money shortage, unless we
are prepared to get at the cause of that
shortage.

playground equipment for years. Hills
products are in 35 countries now.
So if you think marketing your product
overseas is a problem, listen to Jim
Buckman again: “If you can market your
product interstate, you can market it
overseas.”
Sure, marketing overseas has its problems.
But invariably they’re no greater than
those you experience interstate. You
still have to appoint agents, supply stock,
arrange shipping, and paperwork; that’s
common whether you sell here or
overseas.
It’s certainly not necessary setting-up
a special export department immediately.
Select some plump overseas markets,
and apply your domestic marketing
skills! Results can be phenomenal.
Note: Exporting can increase your
turnover; can lower unit costs of your
product; can iron out seasonal
fluctuations; and can increase profits.
Your company will gain extra marketing
knowledge, and prestige.
The government helps you with:
Payroll tax, travel and promotion costs;
EPIC export insurance cover; Trade
Commissioner Services; promotion
publicity; and Department of Trade and
Industry facilities.
Why not start by telephoning now?

Why? Because the nature of rubber is flexible. To slice a
layer thin enough to be microscopically perfect, it must
first be frozen rigid.
And why must it be microscopically perfect? To make
sure the manufacturer gets Optimum dispersion of carbon
black and oil in rubber so that the consumer gets the
best possible rubbec, products.
This is just one example of the care that is taken in the
laboratories of Australian Carbon Black. Staffed with
experts in their field, most of whom have been with us
since our beginnings over eight years ago, they offer to
manufacturers the most advanced technological develop-
ments available today.
So, even though we make only the ingredient carbon
black, when the manufacturer of tyres or rollers or rubber-
soles orders from A.C.8., he knows he’s getting the black
that’s the very best of its type.
Because we’ve applied many tests, including the “ice-
berg”. And because we’ve never given any problem the
“cold shoulder”.
So the next time you think of black, think of us.
