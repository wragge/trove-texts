OLD SARUM, A LINK WITH BRITAIN'S ANCIENT PAST
SARUM stands on high ground a mile and a quarter from
the English Wiltshire city of Salisbury. On three sides the
ground falls steeply, and the crest of this naturally strong position
was encircled by a wide and deep ditch except where a causeway
leads up the hill to the two entrances. The type of earthwork
implies a prehistoric occupation, and that its site was of importance
during the Roman occupation of Britain is suggested by the fact
that the ancient Roman roads from Winchester, SilChester, Dor-
Chester and from Marlborough converged at this point, which, at
the time, was. known as Sorbiodunum.
The ruins of Old Sarum, as they are seen today, date from the
reign of William the Conqueror (1066-1087), and, although deprived
of its walls, towers and cathedrals, it is regarded as the largest early
Norman fortress of the “motte and bailey” type in Britain.
After harrying the north William the Conqueror assembled his
victorious armies at Old Sarum in 1070, where they were disbanded.
In 1070 he transferred the ancient Saxon bishopric of Sherborne to
Old Sarum, or “Searisbyrig,” as it was then called. From this time
the vast earthworks which are seen today transformed the site into
an imposing citadel, within which were erected a castle, cathedral
and the residences of the principal inhabitants. In 1217 friction
developed between the military and ecclesiastical authorities which
led to the foundation in 1220 of the present Salisbury Cathedral,
The castle fell into gradual disuse and decay, and in 1446 was
described as no longer of value. With the final abandonment of
the castle in the 15th century the inhabitants left for the new city
of Salisbury. Although without a house or inhabitant, Old Sarum
continued to be represented in the House of Commons until the
Reform Act of 1832, by virtue of its early mediaeval charter of
incorporation as a borough. For 13 years William Pitt, afterwards
the great Earl of Chatham, was returned as member of Parliament
for Old Sarum.

LIFE OF GARRICK.
As good a reason as any for reading
Margaret Barton’s Garrick (Faber) is to
remind oneself how the stage of the 18th
century hacked, mutilated, misinterpreted
and generally falsified the plays of Shak-
speare. If the study of these unpardon-
able offences does not provide an excuse
for later villainies —and some sort of
cutting and contorting occurs almost
every time Shakspeare is played or
filmed —it shows at least that there are
precedents.
As play after play, after a century of
neglect or distortion, is restored in
Garrick’s lifetime to something like its
original condition, one sees the rebirth
of Shakspeare ; and with that, the rebirth
of the English stage, the health, the depth,
the stability of which is founded on the
Elizabethan poetic drama and still de-
pends on it today. Though Wycherley
and the Restoration dramatists had
brought laughter back to the earth and
though—to the perpetual bewilderment of
Sam Pepys —Shakspeare, or a version of
Shakspeare, was played in the time of
Charles the Second, it was not until
Garrick’s day that the stage fully re-
covered from the almost fatal blow dealt
it by the Puritans. Significantly, it was
two Irishmen who, simultaneously restor-
ing Shakspeare and the naturalistic style
oil acting, liberated the English theatre:
Garrick and Macklin.
Macklin was the first, an ugly, fiery
man, whose great opponent was the sar-
donic Quin who intoned Shakspeare in
the stilted and sonorous style that would
only have been suitable if the plays had
been written by Milton. In 1740, when
Garrick, prancing about at Goodman’s
Fields in the mask of Harlequin, was find-
ing his way from the wine-trade to the
theatre, Macklin decided to play Shylock
seriously as a villain. “The Merchant of
Venice” had for many years been super-
seded by Lansdowne’s adaptation, “The
Jew of Venice,” in which the play be-
came a farce and Shylock merely comic.
Miss Barton describes the revolution;
Only Macklin’s most intimate friends
knew what to expect. At rehearsals he
walked through his part without a look
or a gesture. On the night he came a
little defiantly into the greenroom, the
natural lines of his face scored deeply in
black, a wispy beard on his chin and wear-
ing a red hat and loose black gabardine,
the distinctive dress of the Venetian Jews
of the 16th century. His fellow-actors
stared at him with dismay; they were
accustomed to see Shylock in the non-
descript clothes of a buffoon, and never
before had any actor paid any attention
to the historical accuracy of his dress.
“Well, sir,” said Macklin, as he recalled
his great night, “hitherto all was right
till the last bell rang; then, I confess,
my heart began to beat a little. However,
I mustered all the courage I could and,
recommending my cause to Providence,
threw myself boldly on the stage and was
received by one of the loudest thunders of
applause I ever before experienced.”
It was a performance that alarmed
George the Second; he lay awake all
night after it and, next day, discussing
with Robert Walpole ways’ and means of
frightening the House of Commons, sug-
gested “sending dem to see dat Irishman
play Shylock.” But the age was ready
for Shakspeare ; and increasingly ready
for Shakspeare as Shakspeare wrote it.
Garrick’s first performance, in which
he leapt to fame overnight—“ That young
man,” said Pope to Lord Orrery, “never
had his equal and he will never have a
rival” —was, it is true, in a “Richard the
Third” not as Shakspeare wrote it but as
Colley Cibber had rewritten it: with
Clarence’s dream and Queen Margaret’s
curse omitted and with half of its two
thousand lines, including some famous
“Shakspearean” quotations (“Conscience
avaunt ! Richard’s himself again”) writ-
ten by Cibber. But Garrick at least gave
to this roaring*, ranting, supremely vil-
lainous version something of which
Shakspeare would surely have approved:
a realism of characterisation—or what,
to the age, seemed realistic —totally op-
posed to the sing-song elocution of
Quin:
Before he had uttered a word, Richard’s
evil passions were legible on every feature
of Garrick’s expressive face; he identified
himself with his part as no actor had done
within living memory. Here was a Richard
who set himself so high a standard that
he actually went on acting between his
speeches! “If the young fellow is right,”
said Quin, “I and the rest of the players
have been all wrong.”
There is the same disregard for Shak-
speare’s text, yet the same emotional
sympathy with Shakspeare’s characterisa-
tion when Garrick goes on to another
triumph in “King Lear.” The version
played was that made by Nahum Tate in
the Restoration period, with a happy
ending in which Lear regains his throne
and his sanity, the wicked sisters die of
poison and Cordelia marries Edgar, and
from which the Fool —poor Tom was in-
deed a-cold! —was omitted. Despite these
jollifications of the tragedy, Garrick’s per-
formance was interrupted by open sobs
and weeping from the audience.
Garrick played “Macbeth” not only
with feeling but as Shakspeare wrote it —
more or less. Something of William
Davenant’s Restoration version was re-
tained, in that there was comic singing
by the three witches and some dancing by
imported Furies, and Garrick “judi-
ciously pruned” a few speeches and
added a few of his own, notably a long
dying speech to enable him to perish be-
fore the audience in his best agonised
fashion, but still, it was near enough to
the real play almost to justify the ad-
vertisement “as written by Shakspeare,”
and it startled Quin. “Don’t I play Mac-
beth as written by Shakspeare?” he
asked, unaware that he had been playing
the Davenant atrocity all his life. He
wanted to know where Garrick had got
the line “The devil damn thee black
thou cream-faced loon” —it was not in
the “Macbeth” he knew.
Against what was creditable in this
performance, £s a tolerably faithful
representation of Shakspeare’s text, must
be set the extremely discreditable per-
formance of “The Tempest,” in which
Garrick used Davenant’s and Dryden’s
adaptation, “that rubbishy concoction
that had held the stage ever since the
time of Pepys, on the strength of its
trapdoor magic, its catchy tunes and the
rollicking dances of the sailors.” But
whether he played the correct text, an
altered text or an utterly falsified text,
there is no doubt that Garrick idolised
Shakspeare and that he made -his plays
live; as witness Miss Barton’s notes on
the “Macbeth”;- —
As usual, it was where rapid changes of
facial expression were needed that he earned
most applause. His start on seeing the
visionary dagger was accompanied by an
extraordinary sense of real seeing in his
face, which seemed to whiten and grow
haggard as he looked. Nothing like it
had been seen before Garrick’s sincerity
of acting affected even those on the stage
with him. When he said to the murderer
in the banquet scene, “There’s blood upon
thy face,” the actor was so taken aback
by the intensity of his look that he put
his hand up to his face and cried involun-
tarily, “Is there, by God?”
Garrick’s acting, Garrick’s revitalising
of the English stage, Garrick’s redis-
covery of Shakspeare; these are fascinat-
ing subjects ; but they are not, of course,
Garrick’s whole life, which Miss Barton’s
biography purports to cover. And, in a
sense, does cover. The whole story is
here, from birth to the extreme point of
fame when the House of Commons,
someone having moved that “strangers”
be excluded from an acrimonious) debate,
allowed Garrick to stay, while member
after member, famous men, rose up to
pay tribute to the master of eloquence;
from that great day to the day when,
swallowing his last dose of medicine, he
said softly, “Oh dear!” and fell back
dead.
And the period, too, is covered as it
should be. There is Dr. Johnson, rather
too circumspectly handled; there is Peg
Woffington, charming and singularly un-
inhibited; there is the first night of
“Irene,” the first night of “She Stoops to
Conquer”; there are dealings with
Smollett; there is the sinister exchange
of letters when the mysterious “Junius”
suspected that Garrick had discovered
his identity; there is Lord Monboddo,
who wanted to marry Mrs. Garrick after
the actor’s death, and one of whose many
oddities consisted of taking what he
called an “air-bath,” naked at his win-
dow, at three o’clock every morning;
there is the rise of Sheridan —another
great Irishman of the theatre.
Miss Barton has left nothing out. But
she has, unfortunately, not added much to
her material; not much in the way of
grace, wit, spirit, drama, life. Her style
is on the heavy side; wordy. Almost,
though the book is crowded with theatri-
cal triumphs and disasters, with loves
and hates and great ambitions, though
she deals with a great actor and a great
renaissance of the stage, she conveys the
impression that the period was colorless
and Garrick dull. The great fault is in
the failure to dramatise Garrick as a
personality.
It is a faithful rather than a dis-
tinguished biography. Its merit is that it
does set down the facts and that it does
not, by attempting to oversimplify the
characters for dramatic purposes, falsify
the period as do so many other recon-
structions of its kind.
Maugham without Effort.
Somerset Maugham’s Catalina (Heine-
raann) is set in Spain at the time
of the Inquisition. It deals with a
crippled girl who, on the steps of a
church, has a vision of the Virgin, who
tells her that she will be cured by the one
of the three sons of a certain family who
has best served God.
The three sons are: (a) an obscure
baker; {b) a swaggering and ferocious
military gentleman ; and (c) a bishop who
has had much to do with the burning of
heretics. Since it is obvious that the
baker is going to be the miracle-worker,
Maugham’s plot would not in itself en-
gage attention for more than two
minutes. The reader is kept waiting while
the bishop tries his hand at the miracle
and fails,' and while the military man
tries and fails, but there is no real sus-
pense in the waiting, for it is not estab-
lished —it is hardly even suggested—that
these two have the faintest chance of suc-
ceeding. One has the uneasy suspicion
that the climax is merely being delayed
while Maugham beats out an amusing
short story into a thin novel.
But, up to the point when the baker
at last cures the cripple and the military
man is abashed and the bishop ashamed,
the story is not quite so thin as its bare
outline would suggest. It is enriched,
first, of all, by Maugham’s limpidity of
style—an effortless murmur which some-
times descends to mere colloquialism be-
cause the writer can hardly be bothered
to control it or because to lapse into
carelessness amuses him; which some-
times, because Maugham likes to show he
can turn the tap full on if he wants to,
becomes eloquent and impassioned ; and
which at all times conveys the impres-
sion of absolute ease and mastery.
Then, further enriching the mechani-
cal plot, there are the period color—
warmly laid on, again without any ap-
parent effort—and the wit, the irony and
the sarcasm which fall lightly, readily
and steadily on the easy mark of the
Inquisition.
There is, too, more important than
style and wit, some genuine interest in
the characterisation: a rascally uncle of
the crippled girl, who believes that men
were born to be happy rather than to be
burned; the ambitious founder of a con-
vent who insists that the bishop attempt
the miracle so that her church may be
glorified, and who tries to make a saint
of the girl after the baker has cured her ;
the girl’s impetuous but unreliable
lover; and, most notably, the bishop,
who, it transpires, regrets having burned
a Greek philosopher and lover of the
arts, formerly his friend and tutor—or,
rather, regrets having mercifully had him
garrotted before the burning, thus depriv-
ing him of his last-minute chance of re-
pentance.
At this point, when style, color, wit
and the development of remorse in the
bishop have justified the expansion of the
short story to a length of about 40,000
words, the novel is finished. It reads
more like a Norman Douglas novel or a
fantasy by James Branch Cabell than
the usual Maugham offering, and, per-
haps, like They Went, it is meant to be
understood as: an allegory. The fatal
mistake of the bishop’s life was his
destroying the Greek, who is a symbol
of the arts and of the humanities im-
plicit in the arts.
But a novel, normally, runs to at least
60,000 words ; and Maugham, in a final,
triumphant burst of effortlessness, has
tacked on to the completed story of
Catalina about 20,000 words of picares-
que adventures in which there seems to
be no sense or meaning whatsoever. The
heroine of the novel, crippled no longer
hnd determined not to become a saint,
runs away with her lover, joins a com-
pany of strolling players and, for a brief,
pointless! and singularly feeble interlude,
meets Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.
Perhaps this concluding section is
meant as a last demonstration to the
bishop that the truth of life, as well as
its joys, lies in the arts. Perhaps it is
intended merely to fill out the novel to
the required length. Perhaps it is meant
as a return to the conception of the
novelist as simply a story-teller, a narra-
tor of entertaining tales; a return that
would be welcome if Maugham could be
bothered to take himself, as even an en-
tertainer must, seriously.
Whatever may have been the purpose
—if any—of this concluding section, it
does not “work.” More, it weakens the
entire structure of the book. It is as if
a juggler, ineffably expert in the art of
tossing and catching tennis-balls, had
suddenly decided he couldn’t be bothered
catching them any more. He lets them
fall with a clatter to the stage. The final
impression which Catalina makes is that
Maugham doesn’t even believe in his own
novel: a view which the reader, though
grateful for the moments of entertain-
ment, cannot help sharing.
One Fine Day.
The three of us had to be clothed, we
said:
So I of this evident flesh walked off to
the tailor.
And I with the spirit and soul who at
this moment
Was living the dream of a poet or soldier
or sailor
Came to the door of the shop and waited
outside:
The stuff and the fit were for carcass
and limbs to decide.
And he who bestrides us both like some
old salvage
Charioteer with a foot on the back of
each racer.
Lashing now doer, now dreamer, left and
right with his furies,
{Would we could give him a taste of the
toss and the tumble.
But his hand is iron on the mouth, draws
blood at a stumble )
Walked inside with carcass, where the
shopman said “Good-day, Sir.
“Something heavy and wartn, for the
days are growing colder ?”
—“Something to turn a whip. Quick!
Here, on my shoulder!
Quick! See the welts, man, the weals.”
And as he backed and murmured
“Certainly, sir; fust a moment” —slipping
away to inform —
/ at the doorway scribbled, escaped on
to paper,
Poked this one message out of the chinks
of my bondage
Ere a furious hand on the bit hurled us
together
And away we went up the hill from the
shop hell-for-leather.
And the cobbles were hard and the whip
was a flagellant’s flail.
But a spark was alive in my heart as I
reeled and ran with the gale.

Concise Handbook of Australian
Fishing: “Taggerty” (Robertson and
Mullens). This pleasantly-written little
volume, which tells you how to fish for
everything from flathead to Murray cod
and which goes so far as to tell how to
deceive trout with worms, grasshoppers,
wattle-grubs and centipedes, is certified
by the Religious Editor as edifying for
the beginner and of interest even to the
expert.
Sixty Home Interiors: Introduction
and plans by Dorothy Senior (Associ-
ated General Publications). A practical
booklet telling how to design and
furnish a house from back bedroom to
the front door, with illustrations of the
furniture and a price-list —to which, says
the editor, ten per cent, must be added
for “inevitable increases.”
The Growth of Physical Science:
James Jeans (Georgian House). From
the Babylonian system of counting to the
atom bomb. It concludes with Edding-
ton’s theory that the universe is, after all,
only a complicated and messy-looking
algebraic formula. And, by the time the
scientists have finished with it, mats
probably all it will be.
The Unclouded Years: Marion
Thomas and Innes Cameron (Georgian
House). Something new in the way ot
books for and about children. Marion
Thomas has photographs of children
riding rocking-horses, feeding chickens
and making sand-castles, and mnes
Cameron has stories and verses accom-
panying them.
How Runs the Road: Bernard Cronin.
Briefly outlines the history of roads, from
Roman paved ways to modern macadam
and concrete highways, including Aus-
tralia’s. Of interest to those with petrol
enough to see where they run.
Music for the Man Who _ Enjoys
“Hamlet”: B. H. Haggin (Dennis Dob-
son). The author argues that, as
Shakspeare’s word pictures, which are a
reflection of the Bard’s greatness of mino-

if he knows little of technique, so tne
mental illumination conveyed by grj
composers through “organised souno

a Beethoven sonata, reproducing the bas

FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER INVESTED
IN COMMONWEALTH LOANS
1. When do your Bonds or Inscribed Stock mature?
2. When will Interest Payments from them cease?
3. What should you do about it?
I£ you have ever bought
Commonwealth Bonds or In-
scribed Stock (War Loan
Bo Ads, for instance), it is
important that you know
when those securities will
mature. Otherwise your
money may lie idle and you
may lose valuable interest
payments. •Here’s what to
do.
If you have lodged with your
bank for safe custody more
than £lO worth of any of the
securities listed below, you
should have received a letter
from the Prime Minister,
accompanied by a folder
explaining how your securi-
ties may be converted.
If you have not received such
a letter check the maturity
dates of your securities in
one of the following ways:
1. If your Bonds are in
your own possession. Look
at them at once and compare
the maturity date printed at
the top with those shown in
the list at right.
2. If you lodged your Bonds
with your bank for safe
keeping. Most banks issue
a receipt or acknowledgment
for Bonds left with them for
safe custody. If you hold
any such receipts compare
the maturity dates shown
with the list below.
3. If you cannot discover
maturity dates. Go to your
bank to-day and ask whether
they hold for you any of
the securities listed below.
HOW TO CONVERT
If you find that your securities
are about to mature, ask your
bank or stockbroker for an
application form for Conversion
into the Sixth Security Loan.
Fill in one form for each series
of Bonds or Stock maturing and
hand it back. That’s all. You
will then possess Sixth Security
Loan Bonds or Inscribed Stock
of the same value as your
maturing securities, and interest
on. your securities will continue.

What causes glaucoma ? Is surgical
treatment necessary? If not, what
other treatment ?
An interference with circulation of
aqueous humor within the eye causes
the disease known as glaucoma, so
called because the pupil which is
normally black tends to a greenish
coloration. There is an increase of
pressure or tension within the eyeball,
with resulting dimness of vision,
blindness, etc., according to develop-
ment of the Glaucoma may
be acute or chronic. Apart from
local treatment, various operations
have been devised for the re-estab-
lishment of this aqueous circulation
so that harmful pressure is reduced.
Prompt ‘treatment under medical
supervision is essential.

Brief Answers.
M.A.; Relationship between fuel
consumption and speed varies with
different makes of cars. The most
economical speed may be anywhere
between 25 and 35 m.p.h., the higher
figure applying t,o the larger American
cars. There is in all cases a large
and disproportionate increase in fuel
consumption as the speed increases
above 35 miles per hour, which is
mainly accounted for by increase in
wind resistance... .D.M.C.: ,By “sea-
level” is meant “mean sea-level,” and
one way of determining it is that of
taking a reading of the height of the
sea over a long period and taking
an average. It is from this base that
the height of Mt. Everest wtpuld be
measured above, and the level is taken
“by definition” to be the same at hny
part of the coast. The process of
finding the height of a mountain
should give the same result from
whichever point one starts... .0.A.P.:

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Graded Spies.
One of the numerous Russians
who now prefer America to
their native “paradise,” Kirrill
Alexeev, in “Saturday Even-
ing Post,” grades Com. spies as
seen from inside the Soviet net-
work in, among other places,
the U.S.:
“Group I, professionals, hard-
bitten enough for espionage, and
too smart to have rosy dreams
about the character of the Stalin-
ist regime ; Group 11, the dupes,
the idealistic Communists who
believe the Moscow propaganda ;
Group 111, that company of
smiling idiots, the fellow-
travellers.”
In espionage the “smiling
idiots,” alias fellow-travellers,
are rated “useful for boys’
errands, nothing more.” The
actual Corns (no doubt because
they’re known to the police, so
to speak) are mostly useful for
Soviet purposes as “propa-
ganda agents.”
Alexeev gives the palm to “the
iron-bound professionals i n
Group I,” who, unlike the
spaniel Corns, have to be paid—
“not in lofty dialectic, but in
cash.” Consequently, “the most
dependable of the lot.”
On spy-pay, however, the
Russian adds the somewhat dis-
couraging information that the
Soviet Embassies he worked in
found that “a little cash went a
long way.” These mercenary
employers subscribe to the stingy
dictum: “Only the Americans
are silly enough to pay well for
espionage.”
Moscow Manifesto.
It was not mere coincidence
that America’s sharp action in
rounding up its leading Corns
to stand their trial should
have happened shortly after
one of them, as editor of
the party newspaper, the “Sun-
day Worker,” had published the
oil
latest manifesto from the all-
high Kremlin aymg down what
is now ordered as the party-line
everywhere.
in tbf. nictnmurv
Couched m the customary
Marxist jargon, what the mam-
festo amounts to in simple
lanmiatTp is a reversion to the
SS5£ oVw~ n volntiom
which to some extent was sus-
pended during war-time. The
“popular-front” disguise for the
party m different countries—
in fact, the whole pretence of
being what Mr. Chifley considers
it, merely a non-violent “politi-
cal philosophy, and hence as
tolerable as any democratic
political oartv—is aonarentlv
political party is apparently
discarded.
To quote from the manifesto:
“Experience has shown that any
vinlafirm of the basic oreanisa-
violation or me basic organisa
tional principles m building
Marxist parties weakens and
dilutes them, reduces the parties
from strong independent or-
aaniKafinnti tn mmv sectarian
gamsations to puny, sectarian,
bureaucratic groups In
similar jargon, the declaration
emphasises a demand for
“the ideological Marxist-Leninist
steeling of the ranks of the
party” and, “above all, of the
IpnrUncr nprsnnnpl ”
leading personnel.
It amounts to the Kremlin
cracking the whip for action by
its fifth-column everywhere on
revolutionary lines. As N. Y.
“Times” interpreted it, the mam-
festo is in effect a directive of
the Russian Government to all
branches of the Communist
party throughout the world to
streamline themselves according
to the Russian model, and to
place themselves under direct
Russian command for new revo-
lutionary conflicts and new
“victories in the struggle for
democracy and socialism.”
The new manifesto, N. Y.
“Times” points out, breaks com-
pleteiy with the “Trojan Horse”
party-line adopted in 1935, in
conformity with which the Com-
munist party posed merely as
one of the “progressive” and
democratic parties willing and
anxious to form “popular fronts”
with other progressive and demo-
cratic parties in order to widen
its popular base and gain power
by boring from within.
Instead, the party is ordered
to be the “leading force” (under
Moscow direction and by
Moscow orders) in “the struggle
for socialism, which is merely
another name for Marx’s revo-
lutionary class-struggle for the
overthrow of our present society.
In other words, the Communist
party and all its national sectors
are ordered to drop the demo-
cratic camouflage and to become
again ‘genuine revolutionary
parties’ consisting of a small
elite, aiming at a monopoly of
power and pursuing that goal
not by electioneering or Parlia-
mentary methods but by revolu-
tionary activity.”
Seeing the manifesto as “an
attempt to strengthen the strik-
ing power of the Communist
party by trimming it of all
doubtful elements and making, it a
reliable and obedient instrument
in Russian hands,” the influential
U.S. paper set forth what
could well have been the inspira-
tion of the American action on
the Com. front: “The new mani-
festo must destroy the last illu-
sions of the Western Powers
which led them into such grave
political and military errors dur-
ing and after the war. And that
would seem> to call not only for
a new appraisal of the whole in-
ternational situation, which has
been slowly getting under way,
but also for far greater speed
than has been visible thus far
in measures for coping with it.”
The U.S, round-up of leading
Corns has been carried out under
a law passed* in June, 1940; the
Alien Registration Act. It was
passed without any flourish, and
nothing much was made of it at
the time, but it is a sweeping and
drastic law, particularly in its
“anti-sedition” provisions, these
making.it unlawful for any per-
son:
To advocate or teach the
“duty, necessity, desirability or
propriety of overthrowing or
destroying any Government in
the United States by force or
violence.”
To “print, publish, edit, issue,
emulate, sell” written or printed
matter aimed at causing such an
overthrow of Government.
To help organise or have
membership in any “society,
group or assembly of persons”
who “teach, advocate or en-
courage” the doctrine of violent
overthrow.
Alleged Neurotic.
Cables dealing with the ex-
poS'ing by the American woman
Elizabeth T Bentlev of Soviet
"r uu V t T c
spy-ring activities in the U.S.
have curiously dwelt on allega-
tions tha( . Miss Bentley is
“ ne nrotic” • the inference of
eoursebein’g that hersStements
u u Deil JBJ na r ri er siaremenis
s b o uld not be taken seriously.
An aspect of this not men .
tioned in cables is that Eleanor
Roosevelt in her “World-
Telegram” column, applied
“ neuro tic” to Miss Bentlev and
| n tke same j ssue tke “World-
ii, , „ . „ , ” u “ u
Telegram” was impelled to dis-
own its columnist, anything but
politely, in a leading article
headed “Mrs. Roosevelt Fooled
Again?” Some comments from
the article:—
“In her column Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt attempts to discredit
as an outrageous smear Eliza-
beth T. Bentley’s testimony of a
Communist spy - ring which
reached high into Federal de-
partments. Without offering the
slightest proof she implies it is
all a Republican plot. Actually,
the Department of Justice and
F. 8.1. under the Truman Ad-
ministration took 13 months to
present Miss Bentley’s story to a
Federal grand jury.
“In her sweeping indictment
of the Bentley hearings, Mrs.
Roosevelt refers to Miss
Bentley as ‘this evidently
neurotic lady.’ Now, it so hap-
pens, Mrs. Roosevelt never met
Miss Bentley. So far as we
know she never heard of the
lady before her name was made
public in Washington. Here
again she gives no proof to back
up her psychiatric analysis of
Miss Bentley’s mental and emo-
tional processes.
“Had she consulted J. Edgar
Hoover, the F. 8.1. chief could
have assured the former First
Lady that Miss Bentley is not
a neurotic. For three years his
staff worked closely with Miss
Bentley in an effort to crack the
spy case. We doubt if the F. 8.1.
was taken in by a neurotic lady.
Like any other columnist or re-
porter, it seems to us, Mrs*.
Roosevelt can be expected to do
a little research of her own be-
fore reaching conclusions.”
Anti-War.
“The danger of war with
Russia,” declares David Law-
rence as editor of “U.S. News
and World Report,” “is not
that the Russians may sud-
denly bring on an incident and
provoke war. It is rather that
the Truman Administration,
through incompetence and mis-
management, may make war in-
evitable.”
Though that may be quite un-
biassed, it’s perhaps as well to
bear in mind that a Presidential
heave-ho is going on just now
in America. Further comment
by Lawrence is typical of the
new anti-war note being increas-
ingly sounded in the U.S.:
“No people anywhere today
wants war.
“What, then, causes wars?
One cause is pride of position—
a feeling that to accede to a de-
mand from another Power is
humiliating. Another stems from
the failure to render assistance
to countries striving for eco-
nomic reconstruction.
“There never was any need
for a war with Japan. But it
couldn’t have been prevented in
1941. It was during the ’2o’s
that we, by our mistaken course
in the Far East, helped to in-
flame Japanese public opinion
and gave the militarists) their
chance.
“There never was any need
for the recent war with Ger-
many. But it couldn’t have been
prevented in 1939. It was in the
’2o’s that we made our mistake
in failing to stand by the Ger-
man republic. We gave Hitler
his chance. It was in the early
’3o’s, moreover, that we failed
to show the necessary firmness
in dealing with Hitler, who was
exploiting the very German eco-
nomic distress which the Allies
had neglected to alleviate.
“There is no need for war
with Russia today. It is now
that we must prevent the world
war talked of for five or 10
years hence. To avoid this our
diplomacy must, of course, be
firm so that no Government any-
where will misconstrue forbear-
ance or patience for weakness.
But our diplomacy must be en-
lightened as well. It must see
the whole picture in perspec-
tive and not focus on some small
segment.
“The Berlin blockade in and
of itself presents no insurmount-
able issue. It is merely the re-
flection of previous inability to
achieve an overall settlement
with Russia on the whole matter
of Germany. Wrapped up in
the diplomatic question is the
economic future of both Ger-
many and the whole area con-
trolled by the Soviets.
“If we are realists at all we
must recognise that to put forth
the European Recovery Pro-
gramme of billions of dollars as
a weapon of diplomacy neces-
sarily raises questions of re-
prisal in Moscow. We cannot be
declaring the Truman Doctrine
one day and sending hundreds of
millions of dollars the next day
to help the Greek Army fight
the guerrillas who are spon-
sored by Russia’s satellites with-
out realising that such issues are
not going to be settled on any
one front until they are settled
on all fronts —economic as well
as political.
“The failure of post-war
diplomacy to get peace treaties
for the establishment of free
Governments in Germany and
Austria is a failure to adjust re-
lations between the United
other. It is a quarrel between
v j ctors ,— cer t a in] v n o novelty in

sacrifices ever brought an era of
peace. worth the pain of
prolonged negotiation. For the
fighting of another war would
be senseless. It would mean
that‘pride’ was being carried to
the point of utter stupidity
What we must show now is that
we know how to deal with
the cantankerous, irritating,
materialistic Government that
for the moment has: control of
the Russian people by a system
of iron discipline. For the sake
of humanity as a whole, we
must not permit pride decisions
to inspire our diplomacy.”
At any rate, these are cer-
tamly not fighting words—and
that’s a bit of a change. Still,
not many, even in a now less-
pugnacious U.S., accept that all
has been &t issu£ Berlin
is “pride.”
War's Labor Lost.
Some comments by William
Henry Chamberlin, in the course
of an article in “Wall-street
Journal,” may well be included
in the already-noted widespread
swing away from earlier war-
talk in the U.S., the Chamberlin
point being that in certain im-
portant respects there wasn’t
much profit in fighting the last
war:
“Two words, Manchuria and
Czechoslovakia, have often been
invoked as a reproach to what
has become known as appease-
ment. But the present state of
both those countries indicates
that the issues involved when
Japan took over Manchuria and
Hitler closed in on Czecho-
slovakia were not so simple as
ardent crusaders like to repre-
sent.
“There is today no shadow of
Japanese power or influence in
Manchuria. But much the
greatest part of that rich north-
eastern area of China is under
the control of Chinese Com-
munists and under the more in-
direct domination of Russia.
And the question might arise
whether it was justified, in retro-
spect, to work up so much
crusading spirit over Manchuria
(and over a number of coun-
tries in eastern Europe) when
the consequence of a gigantic
global war was merely to trans-
fer these regions to the Soviet
empire.
“There was rejoicing over the
re-creation of an independent
Czechoslovakia. But it became
evident last spring that Czecho-
slovakia, like Poland, had merely
exchanged one form of servitude
for another. A Czech editor
who escaped into the American
zone in Germany recently was
quoted as expressing the rather
gloomy opinion that only an-
other big war could save
Czechoslovakia from permanent
subjugation to Communism.
One is reminded of the Thirty
Years War, which started over
Czechoslovakia. By the time it
was over most people had com-
pletely forgotten the rights and
wrongs of the issue which set
off the conflagration.”
As for the general harvest, or
aftermath, of the late war,
Chamberlin compares the con-
viction, while it was being
fought, that the reward for its
sufferings and the justification
for its cruelties would be a world
of peace and order under law
with the plain fact that actually
the world we are living in is
more like what might have been
anticipated if Hitler had retained
much of his strength and power.
Dragnet Digest.
Problem No. I. —Packed in a
sentence by Scripps-Howard foreign
editor, William Philip Simms: “The
problem of the Western democracies
in their current effort to settle the
Berlin dispute without war is not only
to obtain a new agreement with Stalin
but to get him to keep it.”
* * * *
Soaking the Rich. —“U.S. News and
World Report” contrasts the present
tax position in the U.S., where- “it is
official policy, as expressed in the 1948
tax law, to give big taxpayers a break,
to provide new incentive to earn more
money, to save and to invest,” against
that of Britain, where “under Social-
ism, the Government’s policy is to
drain off big fortunes through a new
capital levy while at the same time
using other taxes to speed the process
of levelling incomes.” For about
12,000 in Britain taxes this year will
exceed income; they will have to dip
into capital, sell property, etc., to pay.
In the U.S. taxpayers in all brackets
are “feeling the lift of substantial
reductions.”

Goldminers’ Lament. “From
Alaska to Africa, from Canada to
California,” states a “Wall-street
Journal” article, “goldminers have
the same lament. Their costs have
raced skyward in the world-wide in-
flation, but the price of their precious
product is still stuck at the pre-war
level. The global pacemaker in gold-
pricing is the U.S. Treasury. In
1934 the Treasury set the price it
pays for gold at $35 an ounce. And
it hasn’t been changed.” Results, a
drop in miners’ output in the U.S.
from 4.8 million ounces in 1940 to
less than half that total last year,
and a corresponding drop in world
production (excluding Russia and
Japan) from 34.5 million ounces to
21.8 million ounces.
* * *
Spy-story Variation. When Igor
Gouzenko, the Soviet Embassy cypher-
clerk, decided to expose the Com-
munist spying in Canada, he went
first to a newspaper office and
couldn’t get a hearing. Whittaker
Chambers, an important witness in
the current U.S. spy-ring case, went
first to the Department of Justice.
There, says N. Y. “Sun,” he was
ignored: “Nervous and alarmed for
the safety of himself and his family
but equally frightened at the menace
of Communism, Chambers continued
to search for receptive ears.” Even-
tually N. Y. “Sun” secured his
original affidavit and passed it on
to the F.8'.1. Whittaker Chambers
was formerly city editor of the Com-
munist “Daily Worker.”
* * * *
High Cost of Futility— Terse criti-
cism of U.N.O. being voiced at
Geneva and quoted by a correspon-
dent of N. Y. “Times”: “The
United Nations budget has risen
from $19,000,000 to nearly $40,000,000
in two years, largely as a result of
the immense cost of servicing in-
numerable conferences, most of which
are premature and lead to nothing.’

Uncertain Satellites. —If Russia does
force a war Communist fifth-columns
everywhere can be relied on to spring
into action; b'ut the Kremlin might
have its share of headaches in that
line, too. “The Tito rebellion, the
conditions in Czechoslovakia, in
Poland, in Hungary and in Finland.’’
comments Walter Lippmann in N. Y.
“Herald Tribune,” “do not permit the
Soviet general staff to rely upon the
satellite armies. The fact that they
have to enforce their control by ex-
treme measures is a certain sign that
they could not, in case of war, count
upon the undivided loyalty of their
allies.”

Private Diplomacy. The Moscow
negotiations on Germany have at least
represented a discarding of “open
diplomacy openly arrived at” with,
as David Lawrence puts it in N. Y.
“Sun,” “a half-hundred aides stand-
ing around and then seeing that in-
formation leaks to the press so that
the negotiators cannot alter a posi-
tion once taken.” Instead of the
“open-diplomacy” fallacy, a belated
realisation that “the process of reach-
ing an agreement is often attended by
retreats and concessions, and publicity
frequently prevents a successful out-
come.” The result of that, as a
British writer has described it
has been merely “public disagree-
ments publicly arrived at.”

Compared Empires. “Christian
Science Monitor” writer on foreign
affairs Joseph C. Harsch looks at
Russia’s empire, and others: “Some
people in the past have seen the new
Russian empire after the pattern of
ancient Rome. As time passes it
appears more and more likely that
the closer parallel would be to
Napoleon’s empire, which was built
on exploitation and came apart largely
because Paris was never able to see
the conquered provinces as anything
more than sources of wealth and
recruits.”

Humbug Over Spain. —“Christian
Science Monitor’s” Madrid cor-
respondent reports: “Spain had to
be brought back into the general
scheme of the European economy ip
the interest of recovery. Because it
was politically barred from entrance
into the European Recovery Pro*
gramme it was brought in by a side
door.” The “side-door” humbug-
while keeping up the superficial
ostracism, includes Spain’s now hav-
ing Consuls in Germany and engaging
in two-way trade there towards get-
ting back what used to be one ot
Spain’s steadiest markets. The Frencn-
Spanish trade is also already big
again; Britain and the rest 6f the
E.R.P. countries are in it, too.

RADIO HOT NUMBER.
In order “to explain Government actions
and to fight the swing away from Labor,
newspapers report that the Prime Minister
is reconsidering a proposal of last autumn
that he should undertake 'regular radio
“fireside chats” to the nation. But under
the Chifley “full employment” there was
no coal for winter firesides.
The party need for correction of the
“swing from Labor” is still urgent even
more urgent, for the judgment of the
electors is by six months nearer falling
upon Mr. Chifley. The business of being
vetted at general elections is one abhor-
rent to all dictators and aspirant dictators.
It compels them to emerge from the
cloistered seclusion where every decree
is published by pushing buttons and to
become spellbinders. Therefore into the
medley of Government-run news, jazz
and sporting sessions are to be introduced
five-minute Sunday-night jerks of Chifley
build-up.
The Chifley of 12 months ago saw no
prospects of “gearing the country to
meet a depression” without (1) transfer
of all control of prices and charges to a
dictatorship at Canberra, and (2) sociali-
sation of banking by wiping out the
trading banks. The Chifley of today
cannot maintain this stand, for he would
have to confess that he no longer has
any programme for saving the country.
Now a weekly Chifleyian radio chat is to
confess to this long-suffering people that
the Socialists’ planned economy is no
match for capitalist dollar's, and that even
a Chifley-moulded Australia cannot haul
itself out the mess by its bootstraps.
Subjects so far mentioned for Mr.
Chifley’s projected series of addresses are,
along with the “dollar crisis,” the Mar-
shall Plan and the Western Union. These
matters are certainly of great import.
The Marshall Plan—or the European
Recovery Programme, to give it its official
name —is, if faithfully carried out, the
only international co-operation likely to
save civilised Europe from destruction by
those Communist “philosophers” with
which Mr. Chifley has proclaimed his
sympathy; and the Western Union, a
political offshoot from it, promises to
replace Dr. Evatt’s U.N.O. idol as an
international governing body.
Of much more immediate popular in-
terest are subjects about which the Prime
Minister’s advance-publicity agents re-
main mum. If Mr. Chifley is thinking of
opening thus early his 1949 election
campaign, some of the things he ought
to explain to the people are :
The continuance of his excessive war-time
rates of taxation.
The means he intends to adopt to bring
that greater production from industry with-
out which, he has said, Australia faces dis-
Whether he intends to practise for him-
self what he preaches to the State
Treasurers —that they must cut down ex-
orbitant expenditure estimates.
Whether the “Labor” party now stands
or falls on the whole-hog programme of
socialisation for the revolution which the
party’s governing council has decided must
be implemented within 10 years.
What he proposes to do by way of
checking the Communists, especially that.
infiltration into Government departments
which has led the U.S. Government to re-
fuse to disclose any atom-energy secrets to
Canberra’s “push-button” defence-planners.
Mr. Chifley’s position, as he faces the
pre-election session of Parliament, is that
he has, in the interests of establishing a
socialist dictatorship, twice attempted
violence against the Constitution, and
twice been rebuffed by the High Court.
He has three times —twice during the
past two years—tried to cajole or threaten
the electors into granting at referendum
appeals dictatorial powers over industry,
and each time been heavily repulsed. He
has been found out in an underhand
scheme to enact, through a subservient
Parliamentary majority, legislation to by-
pass these referendum decisions and instal
socialisation by creating a Government
monopoly of banking, and doing this
without a mandate, refusing to seek a
mandate, "and even confessing, in effect,
that he did not care whether he had a
mandate or not.
When he burnt his party’s boats by
going all-out for bank-socialisation in
defiance of overwhelming popular pro-
test, he took up the extraordinary
stand that it did not matter that, as
leader of the party, be had, in his elec-
tion policy speech, pledged himself
to moderation. The Government, hay-
ing won the elections, was entitled (said
Mr. Dedman) to regard itself as having
been given “a blank cheque.” Mr.
Chifley’s pose was that the country should
have been aware from a generation-old
plank in the “Labor” platform that a
vote for “Labor” entailed a vote for revo-
lution by socialisation of all means of
production, distribution and exchange.
Mr. Chifley’s crippling taxation, the
riotous expenditure of his departments,
and his insatiable draining of the labor
market to swell the unproductive army of
Government employees have combined
to counter every effort of industrial en-
terprise to meet the demand for con-
sumer goods. The Prime Minister’s per-
sistent refusal to release these brakes on
working output is equalled only by his
persistent, but vain, appeal that produc-
tion shall go ahead despite them.
“Uncle Ben” on the theme —“Is it true
that you won’t work for Chifley?” might
be worth listening to.
The Chifley fetish about the blessings
of a controlled economy and high taxa-
tion are not new. They were derided
120 years ago by Macaulay in his criti-
cism of Southey’s “Colloquies on the
Progress and Prospects of Society”—after
Napoleon’s world war —and the theory
was moth-eaten then:
In every season of distress which we
can remember Mr. Southey has been pro-
claiming that it is not from economy, but
from increased taxation, that the country
must expect relief....He seems to think
that no money can set industry m
motion till such money has been taken by
the taxgatherer out of one man’s pocket
and put into another man’s pocket.
“A people,” he tells us, “may be too rich,
but a Government cannot be so.” What is
useful expenditure? “A liberal expenditure
in national works,” says Mr. Southey, “is
the surest means of promoting national
prosperity.” What does he mean by
national prosperity? If he means the
wealth of the people, of how'gross a con-
tradiction is Mr. Southey guilty. A people,
he tells us, may be too rich, but a Govern-
ment cannot, for a Government can employ
its riches by making people richer. The
wealth of the people is to be taken from
them because they have too much, and is
to be laid out in works, wljich will yield
them more.
Macaulay winds up with his famous tri-
bute to the enterprise of the English
people “in spite of all the misgovernment
of her rulers,” and his prophecy for our
own times, then a century ahead. It is
as true today as it was then that “it is
not by the intermeddling of Mr.
Southey’s idol, the omniscient and omni-
potent State, but by the prudence and
energy of the people, that England has
hitherto been carried forward in civilisa-
tion.” A Government, he says, serves
that end “by leaving capital to find its
most lucrative course, commodities their
fair price, industry and intelligence their
natural reward, idleness and folly their
natural punishment, by maintaining peace,
by defending property, by diminishing the
price of law, and by observing strict eco-
nomy in every department of the State.”
A Macaulay today would give the same
advice to the sponsors of our own
“Golden Age” programme, soon to be put
on —and given—the air.
The Need for a Programme.
The result of the Tasmanian elections
should dispel any Liberal-party com-
placency that may have been derived
from “Labor” rebuffs at the price-control
referendum and other State elections.
While Tasmanian results disclosed a
slight swing from “Labor” in electorates
which are far more stable than in any
of the mainland States, and also more
aloof from great national problems,
they were not very encouraging to the
Liberal party. And what is known of
likely Federal electorate redistributions
is not so encouraging either.
The natural cut-up of many electorates
favors an extension of Country-party in-
fluence. Local interest is making itself
felt as never before in the history of the
Commonwealth. Simultaneously groups
of communities at the extreme northern
and southern ends of New South Wales
are in agitation against Sydney rule, even
if they have not reached the stage of
actual rebellion against the present State
boundaries.
Exactly the same process is going on
in Queensland’s Far North, which has
long been weary of being governed from
a capital planked down unscientifically in
one corner of the State, as far from some
of the centres which it “governs” as Rome
or Athens is from London.
During the next two sessions of Parlia-
ment it can be taken that every expedient
which political cunning can devise, every
promise which will buy a vote and every
expenditure which will affect the issue
will be employed by Mr. Chifley and his
followers to help bring the present Ad-
ministration back to power by hook or
by crook. The new session now opening
calls for an address-in-reply. It will be
designed with an eye on the election. So
will the subsequent Budget be planned to
hold the votes of small men, and drag
back into the fold sections of the floating
vote which deserted on the bank issue.
In consonance with the plan that the
King should perform a constitutional act
in the Commonwealth capital and each
of the States, His Majesty will open Par-
liament on April 4 next year, and on that
day Parliament will undoubtedly have its
largest listening audience on record. The
“Labor” party will have ceased to be
“Labor” if it does not make the most
use of the occasion. Within certain very
ill-defined limits it can put into the King’s
speech almost anything it likes.
All this will, of course, be open to
Opposition criticism, but criticism is not
enough, dreadful as are the doings of
the so-called “Government,” shameful as
are its surrenders and wicked and uncon-
stitutional as are some of its plans for
the future, with its general flouting of the
accepted constitutional practices and prin-
ciples of British and Australian govern-
ment.
Never at any time in Australian history
was there a moment when advocacy of a
clear and constructive programme by an
Opposition was needed more ; but, except
for some plans which, have been put
forward by the Country party for hydro-
electric ' development and for new States,
and some State projects which have been
or are being evolved in Victoria and
Western Australia, Liberal and Country
party alike seem to be vague about their
intentions if returned to power ; either
that or they are all too coy in explaining
and popularising them.
The Liberal party, which has the
biggest problems on its hands since it is
the industrial-area end of the Opposition,
is at sixes and sevens everywhere except
in the States in which it is in power. Its
organisation in New South Wales is
carrying a war against the Country party
into rural electorates. Some of its tactics
in N.S.W. are in strong contrast to those
of the party in other States, and at
variance with the fact that the joint
executive of the Opposition parties in
Parliament operated throughout the last
session as a single unit in perfect amity—
as amity is understood in Parliament.
What the nation wants to know at
present is what kind of Government
it is to receive in exchange for bring-
ing about a change of Ministry—what, in
precise terms, will be the policy of the
Liberal-Country-party combination on
taxation, on expenditure, on dealing with
slipping production, on satisfying the
local-government aspirations of the New
State advbcates, on handling the acute
problem of foreign exchange and parti-
cularly the dollar position. It wishes to
know what the candidates for office have
in mind to reorganise or wipe out controls
over business, what solution they have
prepared for the present untenable in-
dustrial situation under which the Com-
monwealth is largely governed by a few
members of the Central Committee of the
Communist party, whose associations have
been described openly by the Minister for
the Navy as “subversive.”
It desires to be told how and to what
extent the aspirants for power are pre-
pared to deal with the growing inflation
of the civil service, what their foreign
policy is and what they propose to do
with Dr. Evatt’s expanding External
Affairs Department. It has reason to ask
for the concrete ideas of Mr. Menzies
and Mr. Fadden on defence, which may
have become a very urgent issue by the
time they have a chance of assuming
control. And above all it wants to be
assured that the two Opposition parties
can work together harmoniously as a
Government,
A Warning in Spring.
Spring came to the Australian country-
side this year after one of the bitterest
winters! on record. Had it not been
for heavy rains last summer and autumn
which, for the most part, set a , body of
feed that stuck to grazing animals
through savage frosts and biting winds,
there would have been heavy losses.
South-west Queensland suffered, and is
still suffering, a bad autumn-winter
drought. That area aside, rural Aus-
tralia can expect another good season,
with the run of higher prices for land
products continuing. The country, in
short, is in good heart.
How encouraging it would be if the
same could be said of our political and in-
dustrial affairs! To country people, who
live close to the heart of things and who
know from experience that hard work
and honesty are still the only sure
foundation of individual as well as
national life, the general political and in-
dustrial picture is frightening. Barely a
year ago they saw the Prime Minister, in
a fit of spite, bring in the Bank Grab Act.
In the attempt on the banks Mr. Chifley
destroyed all pretence that he was any-
thing but a stubborn Socialist leading a
starkly Socialist Government, and thus
revealed himself and his Government to
country people in a way that his political
opponents could never have done, .
With a new clarity of vision they then
examined past acts and have been
closely scrutinising what has happened
since. The list is a long one, its high-
lights the Keane trunks case, the New
Guinea timber-lease scandal, land-sales
control, the Communist ban on Dutch
shipping, the Mulcahy attack on Blain,
the attempt to kill private airlines, the
failure of soldier land-settlement, the
employment of centralised financial pres-
sure against the States and the people,
Communist stultification of the ex-service-
men’s training scheme, the Communist
ban on arms for Malayan residents, the
shocking news that America, former ally
and powerful friend, will not trust us!
with military secrets while the Chifley
Government permits agents of Moscow to
do pretty well as they please in the affairs
of the country.
Wheatmen have an uneasy feeling that
they are simply licensed agents of Social-
ism. The various wheat-“stabilisation”
schemes have been characterised by loss,
muddle, chicanery as in the notorious N.Z.
wheat deal, bullying and waste. Payment
from the pools is slow and niggardly,
there is an uneasy feeling that the
growers have lost millions, a feeling
shared by woolgrowers>, who know that
somewhere about £2O million made by
this Government on war-time wool deal-
ings has been shoved into the bulging
Federal Treasury.
And the cumulative effect of truckling
to Communists on the coalfields has
struck the land. With another good har-
vest coming on, nearly half the N.S.W.
wheat from last year is jamming country
silos and bag-sites because the railways
can’t get the coal to carry it to waiting
ships. A new wool clip is rolling out of
the sheds to add its weight to a broken-
down transport system. In Queensland
a fresh sugar harvest is coming in, though
most of the storage space is full of the
old one, slow turn-round of ships, lack
of coal and general industrial anarchy
having brought sugar almost to a stand-
still. A million tons of cane may have
to waste in the fields.
In other directions the rot is as pro-
nounced, Country roads have gone back
20 years because shires haven’t the cash
for repairs and the States can’t give it to
them while Mr. Chifley hangs stolidly on
to £lO7 million gathered from a petrol
tax which began at 3d. and is now 10yd.
a gallon, imposed for the prime purpose
of financing roadbuilding and mainten-
ance. The niggardly extra million
dragged out of him by the Premiers for
roads will go nowhere. Landmen cannot
get new machinery or parts for old imple-
ments, the rabbit runs riot and there is
no netting to stop him ; orders for essen-
tial goods take months to fulfil. In
country towns housing and other jobs
stand idle for want of material. Labor
has been drawn from the land into the
city, and the gaps are not being filled.
It all stems back to Canberra, and
country people know it. They know that
if a good farm starts to run to seed
something is wrong with the manage-
ment. It isi the same with a good country.
Is it any wonder that when H. S.
Roberton, president of the N.S.W.
Farmers and Settlers’ Association, a
farmer from Old Junee, came to Sydney
the other day he let himself go?:
It is common knowledge to country
people that there are forces that threaten
to destroy our democratic way of life....
These forces have met with singular suc-
cess.... It is no longer possible to provide
the basic goods and services that are neces-
sary.
Up to this point we have been able to
feed our people... .Prevailing high prices
for all our surplus primary products have
made the nation rich, but that is the limit
of our capacity, and it is only true because
the land industries are still functioning under
the rules of private enterprise.
But secondary and other industries
are not in the same happy position, and,
as a result:
There is an acute and desperate short-
age of all the materials, machinery, equip-
ment and services that are vital to the
ordinary processes of life....We cannot
house our people, provide them with the
elementary necessities, give them adequate
transport services, postal or health services,
we cannot nurse our sick or educate our
children. All because secondary and ter-
tiary industry has been made subject to a
new political nostrum and geared down to
create a condition of chronic scarcity that-
is deliberately designed to be permanent.
After which Roberton warned any wh°
would listen that though it was possib e
to indulge in “political excesses” while
the people are fed and land production
kept at a high level, the land had just
about reached its limit, and if it were not
for the goodness of the season the posi-
tion would be alarming. If “Labof
aimed at. socialisation through incM-
trial attrition,” its intention would tan,
because landmen would stop producing.
Here and there, although Roberton din
not say so, they are doing that now. but
he did say, and herein lies the gnm
warning for the cities, that when t
happened the “general breakdown wi
not be confined to coal, or gas, or elec-
tricity or transport.” The man is n
Jeremiah. He has simply put it into
words the fate that awaits Australia un-
less it deals with its; Socialist-cwm-Com-
munist masters and re-establishes
rule of social and industrial law.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Price-control.
Australia will know more about the
extent and nature of price-control later
this month, when the responsibility is
taken over by the States. Mr. Chifley
has made one thing clear: though he is
levying tens of millions of pounds a year
in taxes for the special purpose of paying
subsidies on essential consumer goods
that would otherwise have risen more
steeply in price, he is not going to con-
tinue some of these subsidies when the
States take over. But crippling Federal
taxation levies will go on.
This is another illustration of the lack
of economic equity in the “Labor” policy
—another example of Chifley retaliation
against the people for not toeing the line
when he has asked for more coercive
powers over them at a referendum. And
when a High Court verdict is against him
the same mulish and irresponsible strain
reveals itself in the Prime Minister.
High taxation and profits-control have
both been made instruments of Canberra
socialism, other instruments having been
blunted at the ballot-box and by the High
Court. Yet this toying with socialism
and truckling to Communism have be-
come wanton, wicked things in a world
in which misery, economic frustration and
social confusion are the main features
of its post-war life.
Especially since the New Zealand cur-
rency revaluation, frankness and plain-
dealing are wanted from the Federal Gov-
ernment as never before, particularly in
view of the huge economic influence that
Canberra wields over the nation through
the inflated public purse. But Canberra
Socialists, plotting to enchain the coun-
try by stealth, have turned sour upon
their plans being uncovered and re-
buffed ; and frankness and plain-dealing
are the last things the country can ex-
pect from them.
Premiers and Big Money.
With one eye on the clock—most of
them were due to board the Orion for
London and the Empire Parliamentary
conference the Premiers somewhat
hurriedly agreed to a loan programme
running into £lOO million, and then set
about the Prime Minister in an effort to
get more tax money out of him. They
got £lo£ million more than last year,
including £2 million for roads, and, with
sundry mutterings about the uniform-tax
system, grabbed their bags and headed
for the boat.
The loan-money was split up like this:
Commonwealth, £14,131,000; N.S.W.,
£16,283,000; Victoria, £15,089,000; Queens-
land, £8,655,000; S.A., £8,100,000; Wes-
tralia, £3,473,000; Tasmania, £4,000,000.
Semi-government and local-government
borrowings in the respective States:
£13,000,000, £9,935,000, £5,957,000, £133,000,
£600,000 and £900,000.
“The result of the conference,” according
to Mr. Clive Evatt, who is Mr. McGirr’s
Assistant-Treasurer when not acting as
Minister for Housing or chairman of the
Com.-colored Australian-Russian Society,
“was a great personal victory” for the
Sydney Premier. His State got in loan
allocation, extra tax-reimbursement and
grants for roads and hospitals a sum of
£52 million, Victoria being a long way
back in second-place with about £3B
million. Whether this is a “personal
victory” for Mr. McGirr or an indica-
tion that “Labor” has the jitters about
NJS.W. in next year’s Federal election
depends on the point of view. Pouring
money out as election bait is a favo'rite
“Labor” dodge.
Mr. Chifley took pains to say that the
loan allocations were “subject to review,”
which the reporters took as meaning that
if “further works were needed to take up
any slackening of employment, borrow-
ings could be increased.” As to that, the
general loan programme is obviously a
sort of insurance against unemployment,
it being equally obvious that under
present conditions there are neither the
men nor the materials to carry on the
works. Steel, for instance, is the most
important material in all public works,
and national steel production is only
about 60 per cent, of normal, partly due
to lack of manpower and mainly to Com-
munist domination of the N.S.W. coal-
fields. If the inferred “slackening of
employment” does arrive in the near
future, the blame will lie bang against
the door of Chifley Socialists.
Despite their high hopes the Premiers
managed to get only an extra £8,680,000
out of the colossal revenue Canberra has
collected under uniform taxation. Their
share is £53.6 million, compared with
just on £233 million collected by Mr.
Chifley in 1947-48 solely from income
and social-service taxation. He wanted
to limit the increase to £6 million, and
added the extra only after he had been
reminded of inflated State costs arising
from the 40-hour week and all-round
wage increases.
In its general aspects the story justi-
fies the Premiers’ complaints that at
present the Commonwealth Treasurer
exercises a disproportionate power over
State finances. Some of them believe that,
because uniform taxation places the
money with the Commonwealth
Treasurer, uniform taxation should go.
The people don’t want to revert to the
old system of multiple income taxes, and
they’re right. Uniform taxation is a
sound enough principle. What is wrong
is that it is being administered by a
power - drunk Socialist Government.
When the Liberal-C.P. Opposition be-
comes the Government it will have to
revise the present system of grants and
reimbursements.
A Brighter Food Picture.
September brings spring to Australia and
autumn to Europe. Our August went
out with a final burst of cold and rain—
the rain of splendid benefit to crop and
pasture; the European August went out
in howling summer gales and floods that
must have reminded Europeans of the
approaching winter and caused them to
lift their thoughts from their confused
politics to the urgent question of how
they shall eat when snow blankets the
land.
Fortunately for them, the food posi-
tion this year is better than it was last.
In Britain, when the weather cleared,
a rush was made to save the
harvest. All in all, Europe is likely to
gather a grain-crop 12,000,000 tons above
that of last year, and the best since 1943.
World grain prospects are good. The
U.S.A. forecasts an exportable surplus of
1000 million bushels of wheat and corn
and assures the world of “an adequate
cushion against a basic food shortage
in 1949.” Canada expects to reap 325
million bushels of wheat, 6,000,000 above
last year; good crops are expected in
India, Russia, North Africa and the
Danube Basin; an early forecast for
Australian wheat is around 180 million
bushels, Canberra’s Bureau of Agri-
cultural Economics, somewhat opti-
mistically, perhaps, believes “the shortage
of bread grains in the greater part of the
world may be overcome this year.”
American, Canadian and European
harvests will soon be in ; ours has yet
to grow and ripen. The grain picture
generally is a cheering one, though there
is no warrant to slacken land produc-
tion, and, for our part, the British people
will still need all the food we can pos-
sibly send them. In meats and milk
products the picture is by no means as
good as it ought to be. Our dairy, sheep
and beef herds are below 1940 numbers,
and our milk and meat exports well be-
hind pre-war figures.
The world, like ourselves, suffers from
a rash of politics that blinds and deafens
men to their own needs. Britain and
Australia are absorbed in a battle be-
tween moth-eaten Socialism and plain
commonsense, the U.S. is in a hysterical
election year, Europe for the most part is
the sport of Communism and its oppo-
nents, Asia is in no better shape. The
wonder is that anybody gets enough to
eat anywhere. That the food position is
as good as it is proves that the soil,
the farmer and nature in benevolent
mood can triumph over the general
foolishness of mankind.
Why Coal Is Short.
When Mr. Chifley goes to address the
northern miners next week he should be
at no loss for illustrations, if he wants
to use them, of (1) how coal production
is deliberately restricted by the miners
and (2) the fatuity of looking for correc-
tion of irresponsible strikes when dis-
ciplinary action is left to the Miners’
Federation.
In an official report on the darg
dispute which had laid idle for a week
the Burwood Colliery, the biggest on the
Newcastle fields, Joint Coal Board
officials reported to the Coal Tribunal
that they had found the fixed darg of 20
skips per pair of miners so low that 25
per cent, of the miners' were out of the
mine before 1 p.m. and 50 per cent,
before 2 p.m.
Lodge representatives opposed any de-
parture from the 20-darg, and the Tri-
bunal, having made “a further inspec-
tion,” reserved its decision.
When 17 wheelers at the Maitland
main colliery were fined £3 each by the
miners’ own disciplinary board for an
“unauthorised stoppage” the mine was
promptly laid idle again in protest.
Directed back, they resumed work next
day, but went on strike again the day
afterwards in protest against newspaper
reports of their one-day’s return to work.
Appeal against the fines was to be heard
by the miners’ board that imposed them.
The Federation has also been resisting
every move to extract with machines coal
left in pillars—which, under Minister
Baddeley’s control, amounts to 50 per
cent, at 200 ft. below the surface to 85
per cent, at 2000 ft, Since 1941 Baddeley’s
Government has also banned the use of
mechanical loaders in extracting pillar
coal —though modern practice overseas
recommends it.
Now the three overseas coal experts—
two British and one American—invited
to Australia by the Joint Coal Board to
pronounce on this polemic in miners’
politics have reported that;
Many millions of tons of coal have
already been lost by the hand method of
extraction, upon which the Miners’ Federa-
tion insists.
Of the 239,000,000 tons left in pillars and
available today, at least 170,000,000 could
be extracted successfully, and should be
removed without delay.
That mechanical extraction is feasible,
will lead to greater safety, more efficient
working and reduced loss of the national
coal resources.
That multiple-shift work should be used
in mechanical extraction and uninterrupted
operations from day to day are a cardinal
necessity.
Chifley now has a text for a straight talk
to the miners—if he is game.
Handshakes and Humbug.
Australia’s Parliamentary deputation
has returned from Japan, its luggage “well
filled with silks” (£lO-worth allowed in
free of duty), and its political consciences
a little disturbed because its members all
shook hands with the Emperor of Japan.
If we want to trade with the Japanese
—and they are for the time being largely
a section of the dollar area—then it
should be recognised that good trading
relations demand at least good manners.
If we appreciate the fact that our country
is going to have to develop its statecraft
(Continued on page 10.)
SHERLOCK CHIFLEY ON THE CASE.
“Under headings of ‘Chifley Uncovers Dollar-Wool Racket’ and the like, press reports credit the Prime Minister with having discovered some foreign buyers of
Australian wool reselling to the U.S.A. at a lower price, but for dollars. Other rackets nearer home have escaped his attention.”
“Confound that dog! He’s making it difficult for me to concentrate.”

quality is something you
can rely on—always

i
in the highest degree during the next
couple of generations, in order to meet
the challenge coming out of all Asia, then
let our foreign policy be based on the
practical politics of the situation. History
does not encourage confidence in the stay-
ing-power of a numerically-weak people
dominated merely by prejudices. The
atrocities Australians and other white
people suffered at. the brands of Japanese
during World War II might easily be
exceeded in an Asiatic onslaught during
a World War 111.
The more vocal among the returning
Parliamentary tourists promise “explana-
tions” in Parliament. They mean to ex-
plain, it seems, that while they can see
no objection to the defeated Emperor
being required to receive without option
any visiting politician however contemp-
tuous, yet they may have humiliated Aus-
tralia by shaking hands with him.
If it was politically or diplomatically
unwise or derogatory for an Australian
party-politician to shake hands with the
Emperor of Japan under his own roof,
why visit him at all?
POLITICAL POINTS
McGirr was the only one out of step
on coal and railways at the Premiers’
Conference. Because Victoria intended
to buy coal from Queensland and Britain,
he demanded a cut in that State’s alloca-
tion of N.S.W. coal and asked whether
the Victorians knew what “sacrifices the
N.S.W. people were making for them.”
Even Chifley couldn’t stomach that and
called it a “parish-pump” attitude. Then
McGirr complained that the rail-stand-
ardisation plan would run his State into
£lO million, though only £3 million would
be spent on work in N.S.W. Rail stand-
ardisation is Ward’s baby, and he was
mighty curt with McGirr when the
Sydney Premier said he’d have to refer
the thing back to his Cabinet.
With the McKenna free-cough-mixture
scheme still in the bottle, reports coming
in from overseas suggest that it had better
be left there. Dr. Metcalfe, Common-
wealth Director-General of Public
Health, after a world tour of inspection
of “nationalised” schemes, found them all
to be failures. Maorilanders, according
to Victoria’s A.-G. Oldham, are now
“consuming between eight and ten bottles
of medicine per head a week under the
New Zealand Government’s free-medicine
scheme.” From Britain come similar
stories. John Bull’s free list includes
spectacles, deaf-aids, false teeth and
similar items, and dentists and opticians
are flat-out trying to cope with the rush.
Original estimate for “specs” was
£2,000,000 for the first nine months;
latest guess multiplies that by six. If the
Federal plan is extended to include optical
aids there’ll be a rush of “Labor”
members after rose-colored glasses for
use in studying the party’s election
chances.
When Sydney people heard that trams
were to run last Sunday they were
momentarily delighted to think that the
Commissioner had resumed control of
public transport. They were quickly dis-
illusioned ; it was for one Sunday only,
the drivers and guards having decided
that on future Sabbaths only a “restricted
service” would run.
N.S.W. State A.L.P., in its game of
shadow-sparring with the Reds, has at last
declared the Australian-Russian Society a
Communist-dominated organisation, which
means that Clive Evatt and Eddie Ward
will have to make up their minds whether
to toe the line and get out of the Red
outfit or stay put and risk expulsion from
the A.L.P. The decision affects N.S.W.
only, so the society will still enjoy the
patronage of the other Ward—South Aus-
tralia’s elderly Senator. The old boy
should know better ; he was a member of
the A.L.P. before young Stalin, then
Josef Djugashvilli, was expelled from his
Georgian priest-factory.
There is no confirmation of the rumor
that Clive is clinging to his chairmanship
of the society because he has heard the
concern is to erect a new building in
which his name will appear on the foun-
dation-stone.
Queensland Ms.H.R. Davidson and
Francis, questioned on their return from
Japan regarding a suggestion that Japs
be allowed to settle in New Guinea, spoke
for all Diggers when they labelled the
idea “offensive and fantastic.” Hirohito
is the latest to bring up the subject, but
Chicago’s Colonel McCormick has openly
advocated it. A straightout “No” from
Canberra is called for before other busy-
bodies start evolving plans.
Final figures for Tasmania’s election
confirmed earlier estimates —“Labor” 15,
Liberals 12, Independents three. Cos-
grove intends to form a No-Government
and hope for the best. Young K, O.
Lyons picked up the third Liberal seat
in Darwin, the electorate his mother re-
presents in the Federal House. His
brother Desmond was not so successful;
he tried for a Denison seat at a time
when the success of Townley had raised
the stocks of Independents in that divi-
sion. Six of them stood for Denison and
two, Townley and Wedd, made the grade.
“Labor” retained three seats, leaving the
Liberals one, which Brigadier Strutt won
by eight votes over his colleague Duncan.
Ex-servicemen and others who have
paid “hungry” owners, agents and tenants
key-money or agreed to buy a few sticks
of furniture or worn-out floor-coverings
at exorbitant prices in order to get a roof
over their heads should get grim satis-
faction from a case before a Brisbane
Court last week. An agent was alleged
to have asked £6B key-money for
a flat, telling a prospective lessee
that “those who were desperate
would pay it.” The S.M. who first- heard
the charge dismissed it, holding that
the regulation invoked “lacked the
word ‘proposed’ immediately before
the word ‘grant.’ ” The High Court
on appeal ruled that the regulation
applied to a proposed grant as well as to
an actual grant of a lease, and referred
the case back to the magistrate to fix a
penalty. Verdict, £25 with £6 6s. lOd.
costs. Go-getters elsewhere should note.
“S. M. Herald” got a valuer to give a
N.S.W. Housing Commission house the
once-over. It was a two-bedroom
asbestos-cement cottage in a distant
suburb. Valuer considered a “reason-
able capital cost would be £1100” and
a fair rent £1 16s. Housing Commission
is collecting £2 9s. and claims that figure
fairly reflects the cost of construction and
administration. If it does then it’s time
the Housing Commission was compul-
sorily wound up, unwound or otherwise
disposed of.
The Federal Arbitration Court has de-
registered the Building Workers’ Indus-
trial Union, a Commo-led show that has
tried to dictate housing policy and has
succeeded in hampering building opera-
tions all over the place. Judge Foster said
of the union that
it had withdrawn men from their employ-
ment. It had imposed black bans on shops.
It had issued threats to employers and
employees, and it had publicly announced
its determination to achieve its end by the
force of its own economic power.
In other words, like every other union
captured by the Reds, it has grabbed all
the benefits of arbitration without accept-
ing any responsibilities, and when beaten
on any point has fallen back on direct
action.
Victoria is to import 2000 prefabri-
cated homes to house British migrants—
railwaymen and teachers. The Common-
wealth Government has agreed to waive
duty, primage and sales tax on the houses,
which will arrive in batches of 200 ahead
of their destined occupants. Prefabs are
not a permanent answer to the housing
problem, but their use may help to over-
come the anomaly of Australia cry-
ing out for immigrants when it cannot
adequately house its own people.
Residents of the Sydney suburb of
Woollahra are in revolt against a proposi-
tion to build an electric railway-station
in Rushcutter Park —a lovely sports and
recreation area. It’s to be part of the
new Eastern Suburbs railway, and filching
a bit of the park is necessary to save
pulling down one of the holy of holies
of the McGirr Government and John
Wren —Sydney Stadium.
When a gust of wind blew a bundle of
taxation returns from an open truck and
scattered them on a Sydney roadway,
afternoon papers ran stories of passers-
by scrambling for “souvenirs.” First re-
action of officialdom was that there was
nothing to worry about; the information
had all been copied out before the papers
were put on the truck. Apparently as
long as no one escaped being billed for
income tax it mattered nothing to the
department that documents giving details
of the private affairs of citizens should
be blowing around the streets. The Com-
missioner’s final report, which expressed
regret at the mishap and reported that
“all except two or three returns” had been
recovered, added that “as the returns had
been finally dealt with, no delay or in-
convenience would be caused to tax-
payers.”
Despite shortage of coal to keep
N.S.W. locomotives in full employment
and shortage of trucks for the locos to
pull when they get the coal, it is still an
offence for road hauliers to compete with
the McGirr railways. One carrier was
recently fined £7 for delivering Adelaide
beer in Canberra when his Road Trans-
port permit for the trip was endorsed for
the carriage of motor-bodies only. Desti-
nation of the grog was Federal Parlia-
ment House bar, which appropriately
comes within the purview of the Minister
for the Interior.
“Some ulterior motive” was suspected
by a Sydney magistrate in a case where
a man who had in his possession “a
quantity of Communist literature and a
membership card of the Communist
party” was convicted of stealing gelignite,
detonators and fuse-wire from the Warra-
gamba Dam. The Comrade, who had
previous convictions and a military record
of desertion, was arrested in Brisbane
when his suitcase burst open and spilled
1100 rounds of .303 ammunition on the
railway platform—he had already con-
signed another 1000 rounds by rail to
Mt. Isa, and his story was that he tvas
going up there to shoot crocodiles. The
gelignite, presumably, was for use against
bunyips, notoriously a pest in the Mt.
Isa area.
Newcastle miners aroused exclamations
of joy last week for working in all mines
(except one) “for the first time this year.”
The allegedly unnatural conditions of
work underground were highly popular
with the coalgetters ; workers up top had
to put up with cold,, biting winds.
When the far-south-coast district of
N.S.W. heard of the Victorian suggestion
to move the border 35 miles north and
make Eden a Victorian port for
East Gippsland and the Monaro,
10 towns sent delegates to the “biggest
meeting ever held in Eden” and they
unanimously supported the motion,
saying that N.S.W. in 150 years
had done nothing for the place—
nothing, that is, except compel Twofold
Bay fishermen to send their catch up to
Nimmitabel and there leave it until a
train wandered along and dragged it up
to Sydney. Anyhow, the Edenites have
invited the Hollway Government to send
somebody up to explain the whole thing.
Hollway himself wants to see Eden as
the port of a new State.
While in London McGirr will try to
place orders for “millions of pounds-
worth of rolling stock for N.S.W. rail-
ways.” Time was when such a disclosure
would have raised howls of protests from
the “Labor” movement; this one got by
without even a yelp.
“Chifley Uncovers Racket” ran the
headlines, and a startled people was told
that “he uncovered an international plot
to get dollars from Australia.” But it
was merely deals whereby some countries
bought our wool and skins and resold
them to dollar countries. Nothing new
about it —months ago it was here pointed
out that wool was as good as gold for
people with jittery currencies—and there
is nothing dishonest about buying in one
market and selling in another. As for
rackets, there are plenty of real ones
nearer home howling for the Prime
Minister’s attention.
Five years ago a resolution for
a United Front with Communists was
carried at the Trade-Union Congress in
Melbourne ; and what that United Front
has cost the Australian people, in wasted
millions, larrikin and revolutionary strikes
and cruel deprivations, is nobody’s busi-
ness. These consequences and others have
so revolted the Queensland A.L.P. execu-
tive that it came out for a ban on the
Communist party as “subversive” and
for the exclusion of Communists from
all Government services, “particularly
security, transport, the P.M.G/s depart-
ment and the teaching bodies.” If the
executive hasn’t changed its mind, the
programme will be put to the Federal
A.L.P. conference this month. Chifley
is expected to try not to be there.
Doc. Evatt is surely U.N.0.-mad. His
South Pacific Commission (headquarters,
Mosman, N.S.W.) is blossoming out like
a little offshoot of the Lake Success pan-
tomime, with a secretary-general, an
assistant secretary-general, a director and
a staff of appropriate proportions, and it
is going on to send a “working com-
mittee” on tour of the South Pacific to
report on the best site for its permanent
home. Members (given in order of en-
thusiasm apparently) —Australia, N.Z.,
U.K., U.S.A., France and Holland, the
bite noire of Australian (wharfies’) foreign
policy. Objects: to co-ordinate native
policy, or something like that; alko, to
provide cushy jobs for another little in-
ternational bureaucracy.
General Council of Britain’s T.U.C.
has suggested that Government controls
should be “streamlined and simplified.”
The Government’s reaction will probably
be to establish a Streamlining Department
and a Board of Simplification.
Wheat ships lie idle in Sydney Harbor
because there is no way of getting the
grain to the seaboard from the Govern-
ment-run silos on Government-run trains
—no way, that is, in the “Labor” lexicon
of management. Meanwhile disastrous
floods in Britain have ruined thousands
of acres of crops, and autumn arrives
there as a grim prelude to another winter
of short commons. No responsible
Labor Minister seems to care a hang.
But then, are any of these fellows “re-
sponsible”?
It is a “Labor” habit to quote as evi-
dence of Australia’s economic wellbeing
the “rising” statistics of this and that.
“Labor” might as well quote the rising
line on some hospital patient’s' fever-
chart.
A Victorian Liberal committee on
transport has recommended control by a
single Minister, instead of seven or eight
boards and commissions, and elimination
of non-paying railway lines in favor of
road transport. But it suggests an in-
crease in motor-registration fees to
“finance road maintenance.” Owners,
already paying 10yd, a gallon on petrol,
a tax imposed for the same purpose which
has yielded £164 million in the past 20
years, will greet this Liberal notion with
a derisive blare of klaxons.
“Labor” trembles at the word “com-
pulsory” in reference to military training,
though approving its use in most other
matters. Chambers’s militia parade-cards
dodge it by using “Obligatory.”

The nearest land approaches to his ele-
ment an old seadog can get in Sydney are
the signs of nautical terms directing one
to the harbor-master’s office—and, of
course, the weather signs on that
mariner’s face. Captain Finlay Murchi-
son first breathed salt at 16, in a 600-ton
barquentine-rigged yacht trading to Nor-
way and Channel ports. Sailing to Mel-
bourne at the turn of the century in a
wool clipper he liked the landfall so
much he’s been on and off our coasts ever
since. Before he took to piloting, he
skippered windjammers on the Sydney-
Frisco run. On one trip the second mate
fell while bending a new foresail in a
blow and shattered the bones of one
foot. It was Murchison’s job to doctor
him ; he set the bones with the aid of
a medical journal. Weeks later, nearing
Frisco, it was decided to risk removing
the mate’s bandages. The “doctor” was
so pleased with his work that all hands
were called aft to see the patient “wiggle
his toes.” ‘'During the recent pilots’ strike,
Murchison and two assistants conned in
33 ships—a tidy effort even for a man
who’s been piloting ’em for 23 years.
The last ship he piloted before anchoring
in the Harbor Trust building was Queen
Elizabeth. His ohly son crossed the bar
when cruiser Canberra was sunk.
New First-Lieutenant of Flinders
Midshipmen’s College, Lt.-Cdr. W. J.
(Nigger) Dovers, D.S.C., is one of the
Navy’s best footballers. Captain of the
Service team, he won his college colors
for cricket, rugby, hockey and athletics,
plus the G.-G.’s Cup for all-round best
games-player. More serious pursuits were
divisional officer in cruiser Canberra
during the war, a spell with the R.N.,
appointments to Fleet destroyers Nestor
and Quickmatch, and, last appointment,
officer in charge of training carrier
fledglings in customs of the Service be-
fore letting ’em loose in the air. College
middies can hardly lay claim to a seden-
tary life —the word “walk” is unmention-
able—and their future activity will rest
safely in the hands (or feet) of their
new Number One.
Had Percy Miller, dead last week in
Sydney at 67, inherited a ready-made
stud-farm, his contribution to Australian
blood-horse breeding would still have
made him noteworthy: it is all the more
remarkable in that he built up Kia Ora
Stud from scratch. Born and educated
in Glebe, when that suburb contained
Sydney’s abattoirs. Miller made his first
crust butchering on a small scale. John
Inglis helped the youngster make good as
a carcass-butcher. Trotters were Miller’s
first love in horses; they were trained
for him by Peter Riddle, and driven by
Peter’s brother Bert. Years later Bert
was stud manager at Kia Ora, and
auctioneer Reg Inglis sold Peter Riddle
the Kia Ora-bred champion Shannon. In
1914 Miller bought a property at
Scone and established Kia Ora. He
offered his first three yearlings at the
1916 sales; and by 1939 was able to
put more than 100 top-priced yearlings
in the sale-ring.
Commanding 8.C.0.F. Air Group,
Group-Captain Brian Eaton, D. 5.0.,
D.F.C. and Bar, had to “walk home”
three times when on ops. in the Middle
East. Hailing from Canterbury (Vic.),
he No. 3 Squadron in the M.E. in
1943 and won his D.F.C. in a Kitty-
hawk bombing attack at Elhamma
which helped to blast a way for
British tanks. He later commanded a
fighter-bomber wing and got his D.S.O.
for a spectacular bombing raid on
Bjelovar, in Yugoslavia, in the face of a
thick barrage of a.-a. fire. When he left
No, 3 Squadron to command the
wing he had 240 operational hours in his
log-book, which in fighter types isn’t bad.
With the Italy invasion Eaton landed a
squadron of his bombing wing on an air-
field in the Heel, the groundstaff flying
over in Dakotas escorted by the fighters.
Within half an hour of the landing his
aircraft were headed for Salerno in sup-
port of hard-pressed ground forces.
Following on the visit of Richard Lane,
of the Penguins, Heinemann’s have sent
their representative, H. L. Hall, to Mel-
bourne to investigate the possibilities of
opening a branch. Outside Britain, the
firm’s largest trade is with Australia.
Hall signalised his arrival by supervising
the publication of Somerset Maugham’s
novel Catalina, which appeared simul-
taneously in Melbourne, New York and
London.
“Telarb”: Former Papuan magistrate
Eric Graham, now working Madiri plan-
tation up the Fly River, thinks he has
located the remains of one of Torres’s
ships. From natives of the Dudee coun-
try he got a story of a white chain disap-
pearing into the earth ; and it is known
those natives possess gold coins, about
which, as the area is ju-ju country, they
are reluctant to talk. From experts down
south Graham found that an anchor-
cable would become covered with verdi-
gris, which over the centuries could turn
white. Torres, passing through the Strait
in 1606, did lose a ship, possibly in an
earthquake. Graham’s notion is that in
the resultant tidal wave the craft was
thrown bodily inland, and now rests under
tons of silt brought down by the Fly. If
he can overcome the local aversion to
penetrating the area with a white man,
Graham will take a party in to solve the
mystery. There is one snag—the first
patent for a chain cable was taken out
in England in 1634, 28 years after Torres
threaded his strait. But if an old ship
does lie under the Fly’s silt, its discovery
will be of great interest, whatever its
origin.
Senior lecturer in anatomy at Otago
University (M.L.), Dr. Alan Richmond
Ellis, has been appointed to the Chair of
Anatomy at King Edward VII Medical
School, Singapore. Out of 35 chairs, of
anatomy in the Empire, three are held
by Maorilanders, all pupils of Professor
W, P, Garland, of Otago. The other
two are A, Durward, of Leeds, and W.
E. Adams, of Otago.
Following a successful tour of Maori-
land, Webster Booth and his wife,
soprano Anne Ziegler, are taking in Aus-
tralia under the Tait house-flag and
demonstrating how the romantic duet
really should be sung. The big,
athletic English tenor has the jib-cut of
a footballer —in fact, he might have fol-
lowed that youthful ambition in the pro-
fessional soccer line had not his college
head jumped on it with both boots. He
still keeps tryst with sport, though
vicariously—golf is, for tenors in big de-
mand, just when you can get it. Aus-
tralia’s old friend Patsy Hendren,’ of
Middlesex, is an old pal of Webster
Booth. The left-hander Frank Foster,
who, with Barnes, plagued a decade
of Australia’s batsmen with the greatest
trundling partnership England has fielded,
is Webster’s cousin. The tenor kicked off
WEBSTER BOOTH, record-maker.
in musical life as a boy soprano at Lin-
coln Cathedral. When his voice broke
he trained as an accountant. With his
vocal chords at last resettled, he forsook
trial-balances for a trial balloon with
the D’Oyley Carte Gilsullivan Co. and
was found to fit in nicely. Thence he
went to the films —he has made about six,
including “The Laughing Lady,” a techni-
color musical now on the Australian cir-
cuit;—and to the concert platform. Of
an easy and cultured stage presence, he
can unleash a respectable volume of
power in the vocal stratosphere when the
dramatic climax demands it—and his
voice has a distinct quality that makes
it instantly recognisable. He bids fair
to break records by making them.
There may not seem to be much con-
nection between knocking Parliamentary
bills into legal shape and building homes
for the homeless, but whatever link there
is, as far as South Australia is copcerned,
is provided by Jack Pickering Cartledge,
here depicted by Coventry. Cartledge
has been Assistant Parliamentary Drafts-
man since 1926 ; his other job—chairman
J. P. CARTLEDGE, home-maker.
of the South Australian Housing Trust
—he more or less grew into. In 1937 he
was appointed chairman of the Building
Act Inquiry Committee, and after that
body presented its final report in 1940 he
was placed on the Building Act Advisory
Committee and became deputy-chairman
of the Housing Trust. He has been
chairman since 1945. The trust has built
over 4000 homes, and is at present erect-
ing them at the rate of 100 a month and
at a lower cost than corresponding houses
anywhere in the Commonwealth.
Nat Gould in a bookshop:
A rare sight in any bookshop these days, a
batch of Nat Goulds that somebody brought
in to Jim Tyrrell’s didn’t last long—they
promptly went to Canberra with W. Farmer
Whyte, who, in time off from the Federal Par-
liament press gallery, is working on a book
about the writer of racing best-sellers. Asking a
question or two about this at Tyrrell’s, a
Bulletin scribe, whose interests happen to in-
clude horses as well as books, was taken along
and introduced to J. W. Earnshaw, who has
the same sort of associations. Interested par-
ticularly in early Australian books, J.W. is a
son of that one-time topnotch Randwick trainer
Ike Earnshaw, who also liked, and bought,
books, and whose stable held one of the best
in the whole racing calendar —that really great
horse • Poseidon, winner of both A.J.C. and
V.R.C. Derbys, the Caulfield Cup and the Mel-
bourne Cup and both St. Legers; all in the one
racing season! Trainer Earnshaw and Nat Gould
were personal friends; it was one of J.W.’s
regular jobs as a boy to roll up the Australian
sporting sheets for dispatch to Gould in Eng-
land, where Nat at the time was still writing his
Australian racing stories. J.W. was able to
send some early Gould clippings to Farmer
Whyte, and no doubt there are others who
could similarly provide clippings or informa-
tion about Nat.
Rev. Father A. MacDonald, S.M., of
Wanganui (M.L.), stationed on the tiny
Pacific atoll of Nukumono, in the Tokolau
Group, is a modern Robinson Crusoe.
The native population is 400, and he
rarely sees a white man. Old men of the
island remember the blackbirders of 70
years ago, when men and women were
seized and shipped to labor in the salt-
and guano-mines of South America. The
missionary is convinced that his island’s
happiness is directly due to its remotenfss
from civilisation; he doesn’t need to
worry about its coming closer —its only
contact is with a rickety wireless-set.
Sydney solicitor A. J. Reynolds, who
has passed on at 83 after 52 years in
harness, was a member of the N.S.W.
committee which worked under Edmund
Barton in 1889-90 on framing the Federal
Constitution. His public offices included,
as well, hon. treasurer of the Barnardo
Homes, member of the Big Brother move-
ment, foundation officer of the first
N.S.W. Department of Agriculture and
vice-president of the Millions Club for
over 20 years. There is a lasting memorial
to him in his own Harborside suburb: he
had a lot to do with Cremorne Point

it with a scholarship. He learnt law at
Melbourne Uni., then went to Oxford.
A leading jurist, he was responsible for
the Uthwatt Report on the post-war plan-
ning of Britain,
Major-General F. K. Norris, recently
appointed honorary physician to the
King, was a medical-corps Lt.-Colonel
in the first scrap, and Deputy Medical
Director of the Ist Australian Corps in
the second. He was in the thick of the
scrub-typhus, malaria and other enemies
that helped the Japs in the Owen Stanley
campaign, and was decorated for his part
in quelling them.
The Boyds are another Victorian
family which, like the Creswick Lind-
says, breathes artistic talept. Arthur and
E. M, Boyd were noted watercolorists,
and a son of one of them, Penleigh,
studied at Eaglemont school with
Streeton, Norman Lindsay and Tom
Roberts. Another is Martin Boyd, who,
as “Martin Mills,” published a string of
English novels. Martin, back in Mel-
bourne after 35 years in Britain, was born
in Switzerland but reached Australia
six months later. He served as pilot and
observer in the R.F.C., settled in England
and wrote The Mqntforts * a history of
his family ; it won the Australian Litera-
ture Society’s gold medal. Another novel,
Lucina Brayford, sold half a million
copies in America. Next on his list is an
Anglo-Australian book, to be written in
Melbourne.
Exit of George Tallis (B. 25/8/’4B)
recalls that J.C.W.’s Queensland manager,
George Matheson, was the youngest
member of the Firm’s staff when Tallis
first joined it more than 50 years ago. To-
day, .Matheson holds the long-distance
record for service, his “front of the house”
years eclipsing those, of Johnny Farrell,
who watches the Tails’ interests in Maori-
land.
Lord Robinson, second South Aus-
tralian to reach the peerage—Maurice
Hankey was the first —is back to inspect
Australia’s forests, with nearly 40 years’
experience in afforestation work in
Britain behind him. As chairman of Eng-
land’s forestry commission, his main con-
cern, next to planting trees, has been
prodding public interest in this national
gardening. Now the time is in sight when
five million acres of the Old Country will
be under well-managed forests. Among
“firsts” claimed for him are the first
Rhodes scholar to win an Oxford cricket
blue, and the first peer in English history
to take his title from a forest —Kielder
Forest, in Northumberland, his commis-
sion’s biggest job.
Into the silence ;
In Sydney,, at 53, Judge Hilary James
Studdert, member of the District Court Bench.
He was wounded in France in 1916, returned
to graduate in law with honors and took silk
in 1924.
In a crashed Dakota freighter near Picton
(N.Z.), Commander Makgill and Commander
Macleod, two of M.L.’s outstanding fliers.
Makgill collected the Air Force Cross for ex-
ceptional skill in handling Sir Cyril Newall’s
aircraft in a storm. Macleod had flown 10,500
hours.
In Melbourne, at 55, C. D. Gabel, Com-
monwealth Public Service Inspector for Vic-
toria. He was one of the three District-
distribution Commissioners appointed to draw
up the new Federal electoral boundaries which
were announced the day after his death. He
served with the A.I.F. in War I and was Ad-
ministrator of Nauru for three years.
In Brisbane, at 67, A. E. Aitkin, recently
retired Chief Stipendiary Magistrate. An Old
Digger, he had been with the Justice Depart-
ment for 44 years.
In Sydney, at 80, knight Sam Cohen, out-
standing identity in the business world.
At Ararat (Vie.), at 82, Monsignor Edward
O’Sullivan Goidanich, one of Victoria’s best-
known clerics. He came to Australia from
Ireland in 1893. Served as an A.I.F. padre on
Gallipoli, where he was wounded and won an
M.C.
In Innisfail, at 60, Jose Paronella, whose
dream was to own a castle. He finally built
one, at Mena Creek, near Innisfail. Costing
over £20,000, it was one of the North’s tourist
show-places.
At Heywood (Vic.), Ron Brisbane, founder
of Gowrie Park Ayrshire stud.
In Sydney, Jack Lumsdaine, a pioneer of
radio entertainment and one of the prost like-
able men in the game. Pre-war visitors to
Sydney knew him as the Harbor Show-boat
commentator.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Ray Whiting”; In these times of beer-
drought there must be many a Middle
Easter sighing for the Syrian days of
plenty. Fairly free from pink goannas,
it was made, I believe, in Tripoli under
the supervision of a couple of Melbourne
brewers. Wherever you found yourself
in the mountains of the Lebanon, per-
haps in a lonely olive-grove with never
a soul in sight, if you felt like a gargle
you simply hollered to the heavens,
“Hey, George! Any beer?” And lo!
from the rocky ground would rise the in-
evitable grinning Arab urchin with a
sackful of Almaza beer. If you were
broke and it was too cold to part with
your blanket for payment a tin or so of
bully would do, and George, minus his
sack, would vanish back happily into the
terraced earth. But stand outside a
Collins-street pub and bawl “Beer! ” No,
I doubt if it would work.

“C. 8.”: A precedent established by
Harold Herbert has been followed by
another Melburnian, G. J. Chappel,
officer-in-charge of the Criminal Branch
of the Crown Law Department, who-
has just died after a short illness. When
his safe was opened it was found to con-
tain a sum of money with instructions to
his colleagues to remember him in a
final deoch-an’-doris. In artist Herbert’s
case an announcement on the notice-
board of the Savage Club confronted
friends returning from his funeral inform-
ing them that “from one till two all
drinks in the Club are on the late Harold
Herbert.”
* * ♦ ♦
“Oxmead”: These ingenuous persons
who try to sub-edit Shakspeare or to sug-
gest emendations for lines beyond
ordinary comprehension on the ground
that they were distorted on the stage or
mutilated in the First Folio —Olivier had
something to say on this vexed subject
in Sydney—remind me of a happening in
London over 50 years ago. Some
humorist wrote to a rather ponderous
literary journal with the suggestion that
the line in “Macbeth,” “Now the hurly-
burly’s done,” should really be “Now the
early purl is done,” a social ceremony, he
explained, corresponding in Shakspeare’s
time to the moming-tea of Victorian
days, with the exception that spiced beer
was substituted for “the cup that cheers
bpt not inebriates.” The editor of the
magazine showed himself disinclined to
accept the suggestion, but he didn’t alto-
gether rule it out, and found space for
some informative remarks on the “early-
purling” habit and the composition of the
brew. At this point another humorist —
or perhaps the same one —dashed into
print to air his conviction that what
Shakspeare really wrote was “When the
Earl o’ Burleigh’s done,” in reference to
the Elizabethan nobleman of that name,
and it became apparent that the whole
business was a leg-pull.

“L.P.”: There’s a Melbourne man
who finds the Electoral Office a bit hard
to follow. Recently he received a letter
asking him why he had voted twice on
the referendum —once in person and
once by post. Before he got a reply
to his disavowal.another letter came ask-
ing him why he had not voted.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: I refuse to believe that
“quick study” went out with the old
blood-and-thunder Thespians in “stock”
companies who learned a new part every
week. In Sydney early this year Lloyd
Lamble swotted the lead in “Blithe Spirit”
in four days and never fluffed a line on
opening night. Now comes Kath Esler.
She was given seven days to study the
Annie Oakley role in “Annie Get Your
Gun” in Brisbane. Kath had the issue
pat, including 11 songs, when she went
on to give Evie Hayes a week’s spell
after 13 months of consistent playing in
the part.
* * * *
“Etiwanda”: So far no thriller-writer
has exploited the vast and secretive Vic-
torian Mallee as a “hideout” for gangs,
though .anyone who knows those track-
less wastes of scrub on the Victorian-
S.A. border would agree that a man, or
group of men, could vanish into them
and remain hidden until they chose to
emerge. Food could be stored, though
water would be a problem, except in the
“ You'll stay like that till you give me your answer ‘ yes' or ‘no’ !
uttermost corner, where the scrub runs
to the Murray River. The other week
some word of an unusual number of cars
at a shack in the scrub about 40 miles
out of Mildura got to the police, and
they went out to look it over, being at
the time concerned about increasing re-
ports of car thefts. When the law ap-
peared three men bolted into the scrub.
Two of them surrendered when fired
upon; the third, after a journey afoot
through 80 miles of the waterless waste,
was arrested at his home. Six missing
cars were at the shack, two of them
burnt after being stripped of valuable,
parts and allegedly to destroy finger-
prints ; they came from places as far
apart as Wentworth and Murrumbeena.
The captured men are to stand trial,

“V. Cluse”: A bobtailed black cat
with two forelegs and one hind-leg ap-
peared in our street. The local Toms
hailed him with antagonism and delight,
and set out to demolish him. But some-
how he was as good as any other two
cats in the place, and after they’d shed
some fur and blood the locals adopted
him into their councils, Blackie hopped
merrily over fences and sang as loudly
on the tiles) as the rest until an out-
raged citizen arose one night, charged
his d.-b. gun with No. 6 shot and let
drive. Since he shot blindly against a
howling westerly, there were no fatal
casualties, but the suburb now has two
bobtailed, three-legged cats, both blacks,
and a report from the south says that a
tabby which left thfire recently fully up-
holstered returned home minus' an eye
and an ear and hasn’t budged from under
the back step since. Meantime, the
shooter, a humanitarian at heart, is
strongly suspected of sneaking forth at
night carrying small parcels of chopped
meat which he places surreptitiously in
spots favored by the felines for their
nightly fiestas.

“Zake”; Sifting the commercial ether
in search of the microscopic grain of
good music, I patiently waited for the
announcer to finish his passionate adjura-
tion for me to buy somebody’s something
or other —so evanescent is the effect of
the radio advertisement that I’d forgotten
the product and its makers a minute after
I’d heard it. Whatever it was the pro-
duct would be notable by the fact that
put up in “a streamlined tube.”
tfow I know why I’ve always been catch-
ing my fingers on thoss old-fashioned
tubes of tooth-paste, shaving-soap and
suchlike —they must have corners stuck
out down what I mistakenly took to be
sleek sides. I can now appreciate, too,
the wife’s moan about her old tube of
hand-lotion offering too much wind-
resistance. In future I shall stoutly re-
fuse the salesman’s blandishments when
he offers me an ordinary tube of some-
thing—it’s a streamlined tube for me
or nothing.
* * * *
“Burong Hantu”: Decision to land
the Royal visitors at Westernport (Vic.)
because the Vanguard can negotiate its
70ft.-deep entrance is a reminder that
that stately sheet of water was once con-
sidered as the site for the capital of
Victoria. Long before Batman entered
the mouth of the Yarra, Phillip Island
had been settled by sealers and their abo.
houris, and a naval expedition established
a station there for some years, remains
of which still exist. Objection to
Westernport as Victoria’s chief port was
lack of fresh water, whereas Melbourne
had the Yarra. The Yarra is now use-
less for domestic purposes, and Mel-
bourne draws its water through expen-
sive pipes from expensive reservoirs miles
away in the mountains, to which Western-
port is much nearer. Thus it? principal
disadvantage has been removed. Its
advantages above Port Phillip are numer-
ous. It is an attractive sheet of water,
has the picturesque Phillip Island shelter-
ing its entrance and has French Island.
Had it been selected as the place for a
village Melbourne would have been very
different. It would have been more like
Sydney with its ferries and its suburbs in
sheltered bays, its surf beaches not far
away and, no doubt, two majestic bridges
spanning the entrances at both ends of
Phillip Island. But there would have
been no seals, no muttonbirds, no koalas
and no penguins, and Melburnians would
no doubt have sought unspoiled Nature
on the banks of the Yarra somewhere
about Collingwood and Fitzroy.

“Curate’s Egg”: Melbourne under-
grads’ spoof with Trinity College cow
(B. 11/8/’4B) recalls the occasion of the
Mulgaville Picnic Races when Sergeant
O’Flaherty got a phone-call informing
that a female was behaving rather up-
roariously in the environs of the Royal.
Knowing that a lady commercial had
booked the pub sample-room for the
race week, O’Flaherty chivalrously de-
cided it was not a police matter, but
when a second ring informed him that
the female, clad only in “scants and bra,”
was drinking in the public bar he pedalled
furiously to the Royal to,find that the
wearer of the intimate garments was
Father Hogan’s house-goat, who was
luxuriating in buckets of beer straight
from the wood.

“Dekko”; Queensland can’t beat that
longwinded monicker from M.L., but it
has a few jawbreakers. One hill in the
Blackall Range, near Elimbah, is named
Miketeebumulgrai; another south of
Kilcoy has the lengthy appellation of
Goonneringerringi. In former days 1
often climbed over a hill in Perthshire
near Loch Tay ; its name is Creagnachoi-
rechreagach. I could pronounce it once ;
I’m not so sure now.

“Pongo”: That cove noticed squinting
down a street-grating at Circular Quay
(B. 11/8/’4B) was probably taking a
gander into one of the G.P.O.’s 12 miles
of cable-tunnels into which have disap-
peared the thousands of overhead wires
that once almost obscured the light from
city streets. It is possible to walk erect
in these tunnels from Circular Quay to
Paddington, Pyrmont, Newtown and so
on, and the variety of objects that find
their way into them through the street-
gratings is astonishing. Coins are a
commonplace. Once a walking-stick
found its way in, and a woman who had
lost a yearly rail-ticket and a bunch of
keys was most surprised and grateful
when postal officials returned them to
her. Probably the most unusual find
was a glass eye. Its owner, unlike the
lady of the yearly ticket,* had kept his
good eye open and saw his “glassy” dis-
appear through the grating. Inquiries
sent him hot-foot to the G.P.0., and
within an hour he had the lost eye in its
socket again.
* * * * •
“Minto”; Medical red-tape (B.
28/7/748)? An air-crew trainee at Mary-
borough (Q.) was carted off to hospital
after a minor crash. Finding the airman’s
regular quarters in disorderly condition,
the adjutant issued an order: “Airmen
proceeding to hospital will Notify H.Q.
24 hours beforehand so that arrangements
may be made to collect and store their
equipment.”
* * * *
“Craiser”: “Butterfly,” up to date the
star turn in the Melbourne opera season,
had a curious history. David Belasco
wrote the straight play based on John
Luther Long’s book, and it had an im-
mediate success on Broadway. It was
transferred to the Duke of York’s
Theatre, London, and was seen by
Francis Nielsen, stage-manager of Covent
Garden. By an unusual stroke of in-
tuition he thought of Puccini, and a cable
to Milan brought the composer promptly
to London. In 1904 the opera was pro-
duced at La Scala, and flopped badly.
The audience booed and hooted and
poor Cho-cho San had real tears cours-
ing down her cheeks as the curtain fell.
The reception didn’t shake the composer's
belief that he had started a new phase
of lyric drama.
* * * •
“Yard-glass”: The time - honored
order, “mugerbeerplizmiss,” was reduced
to puerility the other day in the jewellery-
store where my long-haired mate went
to buy me a birthday gift. Confronting
the suave high-priest of the joint, she
asked to see some pewter-mugs. “Cer-
tainly, madam,” he replied, producing an
array of metal measures of about liqueur-
glass capacity. The missus eyed them
dubiously, commenting, “They seem a bit
small.” “That is the customary size,
madam.” “But it’s for an adult, you
know.” Light dawned, the H.P.’s nose
tilted a few degrees further north. “Oh,
madam desires a tankard,” he explained.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
“Old Firm”: Word “spiv,” now so
often used in news items from Britain,
goes back half a century. According to
one authority, it comes from a phrase—
“suspected persons and itinerant vagrants’
—contained in one of the Vagrancy Acts
of Victoria’s reign. For reference pur-
poses police condensed the phrase to its
initial letters.
♦ ♦ * ♦
“H.W.M.”: Reported sale of Dam-
man’s corner, opposite the Melbourne
Town Hall, will number the days of
Damman as the occupier of corners.
This tobacco firm has occupied three of
the four corners of the Collins-Swanston-
street intersection, the corner on which
the Town Hall stands being the only one
missed. Started about 1851 by two
Danes, Gustav Damman and his brother,
the firm is close on 100 years old.
First location was the Victoria Building
site; next what used to be Stewart Daw-
son’s corner. They shifted to the present
corner in 1909. When Damman opened
his first shop there was a fountain in
the centre of the intersection, now the
busiest in Melbourne.
* * ♦ ♦
“Muskeen”: Melbourne also has a
memorial to war-horses (B. 4/8/’4B). B
was erected at the junction of St. Kilda
and Domain-road by the Purple Cross
Society of Victoria as “A Tribute to Our
War Horses” of World War I. Em-
bodied in the memorial is a drinking-
trough—rarely patronised these days—
with the inscription:
He gains no crosses as a soldier may,
No medals for the many risks he runs,
He only, in his patient, puzzled way,
Sticks to his guns.
Not 200 yards away another memorial
keeps green the memory of an animai
and a man. It is the bronze monument to
Private Simpson, “The Man with the
Donkey,” who by means of his donke}
evacuated many front-line, wounded from
the day of the Gallipoli landing until he
was killed on May 19, 1915.
HE KNEW ENOUGH ENGLISH FOR
THAT.
“Expressing surprise that a petitioner for divorce —
an Italian who had lived and worked for 20 years
in Australia —had not learned to speak English, a
Sydney Judge inquired: ‘How does he get on when
he wants a beer on a hot day?’ ‘He says that he
knows enough English for that,’ replied the inter-
preter.”
He came from the home of the olive and grape,
The melon, the fig and the quince,
And probably holds it a lucky escape
From all that has happened there since.
He adopted our land, but the language we use
Left him groping bewilderedly at;
He hadn’t a way of expressing his views
Except in the matter of thirst-quenching brews —
He knew enough English for that.
He guided the plough and he tilled with the
spade,
The pick and the Kelly he swung,
While his thoughts, as he labored, could not be
conveyed
In aught but an alien tongue.
But when summer descended, oppressively hot,
Where he yackered, in gully or flat,
And fancies turned lightly—as why should they
not?—
On pleasure to come from a foam-crested pot,
He knew enough English for that.
He couldn’t, as you or as I might, discuss,
Our home-made vernacular in.
What Commos are planning, nor yet what the
Russ
Projects in the case of Berlin.
But where counters are breasted and whistles are
wet
With tack from the brewery vat
In measures abrim before customers set,
It’s perfectly safe, I imagine, to bet
He knew enough English for that.
And his Honor as well, I’m impelled to suggest,
When he’s finished an arduous day,
And discarded his wig and his gown and the
rest
Of his stuffy judicial array,
And is back in some club, with its lashings of
lures
And comforts all ready and pat
On shelves and in bottles, experience assures,
When hailed with a genial cry of “What’s
yours?”
Knows quite enough English for that.

T. THE R.


“Yank”: Television is now sufficiently
well-planted in the United States to war-
rant the minor war that is now going on
between the big cosmetic companies as to
who should supply the necessary make-up
for the actors. The winner should have
a lucrative sideline as, depending on the
lighting used, women’s lipstick varies
from blue to brown, and there is a vast
assortment of colored creams to go with
it. Male actors will have to be cus-
tomers, too, since to appear human on
the receiving-sets they must thoroughly
shave, kalsomine their faces with founda-
tion cream, touch-up with shadow
powder, and varnish their eyebrows. The
final effect is a little different from what
one might imagine. Recently when a
televised cowboy fired his six-shooter
straight at the camera, beer was spilt
in every Broadway bar possessing a “see-
hear” set,
* ♦ * *
“Uramao”: For the last 12 months
Maoriland’s river of ice, the Franz
Joseph Glacier, has been advancing at
the rate of about 3ft. a day, in contrast
to its recession of half a mile in the
previous decade. The tremendous pres-
sure of the ice is pushing all before it,
and the lake at the face of the glacier,
caused by the melting, is being gradually
filled in by the debris. It is calculated
that at the present rate the lake will be
completely filled in three years. Unlike
glaciers in other parts of the world, which
are environed by barren earth or rock,
the Franz Joseph is fringed by luxuriant
growth of vivid color, the crimson rata
in season framing the virgin white in an
attractive setting.
* * * •
“Cauboy”; I see that the Stratford-on-
Avon Shakspearean Company, threaten-
ing to visit Australia, wants to know
what plays we want to see. A daily-paper
quiz in Melbourne produced a diversity
of opinion. Nobody wanted “Romeo and
Juliet,” one man wanted “Macbeth” be-
cause he had a private theory about
Duncan’s murder; several expressed a
wish to see the Bard’s “School for Scan-
dal”! My nomination would leave out
all the comedies and would include all
the historical plays, few of which have
been done in Australia on professional
lines. Of the tragedies I would name
“Troilus and Cressida,” “Measure for
Measure,” “Coriplanus,” “Timon of
Athens,” and “Pericles,” provided the
expurgator did not practise his surgery
on them. These are never included in the
conventional repertoire, but they contain
some great passages; Masefield calls
“Measure for Measure” a “marvellous
piece of unflinching thought” written with
“that smoothness of happy ease which
makes one think of Shakspeare not as a
poet writing, but as a sun shining.” When
it was put on by Allan Wilkie at the
Palace, Melbourne, it drew shrieks of
shocked dismay from the critics, brought
up on the expurgated Shakspeares of their
schooldays.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
“A.A.”; Red Page reference to the
fact that much of Shakspeare’s prose
comes very close to poetry recalls that
Dickens’s works contain many passages
which scan correctly as blank verse —
particularly is this true when the mood
of pathos was on him. That is one rea-
son why Dickens was so popular for
reading aloud at the “penny readings”
of last century. The rhythm of his writ-
ing is extraordinarily attractive to hear
read, and his work is more attractive to
listen to than to read silently—because
of that rhythm.
“Findy”: Britain, in a belated effort
to save the countryside from being com-
pletely obscured by advertisements, is
bringing in legislation to control the size
and number of hoardings and posters and
to give local councils power in some
cases to forbid them altogether. South
Australia tried something of the sort
years ago and ordered the removal of all
hoardings along the tourist roads through
the Adelaide hills. As befitted legisla-
tion arising in the City of Churches,
religious notices were exempted from the
ukase. A wine concern whose advertise-
ments were dotted here and there about
the landscape took advantage of the loop-
hole. The old slogans were painted off
its hoardings and replaced by such in-
junctions as “Use a little wine for thy
stomach’s sake,” “Wine maketh glad the
life” and other carefully selected quota-
tions from Holy Writ.
* * * *
“Kinross”: While a “monster rally”
of interested landholders, N.S.W. poli-
ticians and others gathered at Narrandera
(N.S.W.) to urge the Prime Minister or
somebody to divert the Snowy River into
the Murrumbidgee a young woman of
Holbrook (N.S.W.), Jocelyn Henderson,
was publishing a little book called Fire —
or Water ? No, it had nothing to do with
woman’s rights or anything of that sort,
but the crowd who went to Narrandera,
including the 28 politicians, ought to
read it. It proves pretty conclusively that
unless' something is done mighty soon to
protect the catchments against fire and
overgrazing there’ll be no Murray,
’Bidgee or Snowy to conserve, divert or
waste.
* * * *
“Dong”: As well as the bursting pride
one achieves in successfully handling the
manual part of winning a driver’s licence
(B. 25/8/’4B), there is the wealth of
knowledge that comes in studying the
traffic regulations for the oral test. The
learner finds that all those hopscotch
movements he made back in his walking
days when, half-way across the dotted
lines, he seemed likely to be smitten by
a truck were needless; he should have
continued walking and, when hit by the
vehicle, would have had the consolation
of knowing that its driver was violating
paragraph 22 of the handbook. He
learns, too, that he has the right to say
rude things to people who refuse to dim
their lights 200yds. away. If he gets
really immersed in the rules he will find
that as well as giving way to ambulances,
fire-fighting vehicles, Red Cross outfits
and restive horses, he must also step down
for clergymen at punt crossings. The
motor-school bloke who taught me to
drive paid particular attention to the
“advice for pedestrians” section, which
I had skipped as obsolete, and grinned
ominously when I did not know that
pedestrians should not stand on street-
corners because of restricting the view
of motorists desiring to turn. However,
when I’d scraped through the test and,
elated, asked my coach to share a sher-
bert when he knocked off for the day, he
replied, “Sure. Half-past five. Corner
of Pitt and King.”
* * * *
“Bo”: I had always regarded as the
champion pest the fellow who, in re-
sponse to some idle, unimportant ques-
tions regarding a mutual casual acquaint-
ance, says with definiteness, “Yes, saw
him in town last Thursday”—then, when
“Dad fixed it all right, Mum!"
the conversation has switched to another
topic altogether, the Gnawing Doubt stirs
maggot-like in his brain, “No,” he’ll
break in suddenly, “I believe it was
Tuesday I saw George.” It doesn’t
matter a damn to you, of course, if it
was Sunday week or Friday at dawn, but
following an effort by you to swing the
conversation on to politics or sport the
Gnawing Doubt remains. I’ve known
fellows, after correcting themselves about
four times over a fancied day that some-
thing happened, break in after a long
spell, during which they’ve taken not the
slightest notice of your conversation,
with, “I do believe it was Tuesday I
met George —I remember now because
I had to take some collars to the laundry
that day,” etc. —and by that time you
feel like massaging him with a meat-axe.
“The audience is enthusiastic tonight, Sadie."
But the champ.-of-champs. in the human-
pest line is he who, walking along with
you, keeps bulldogging you over to one
side by almost leaning on you. He will
inexorably impel you gutterwards or
windowwards according to the side he’s
on in a city street. I have worked out
a sure cure —when I strike one of these
pests, by whom I’m always outweighed
and out-heighted, I get on the side where
he will “work” me over to the gutter-
then I step nimbly aside and let his
volitions argue as best they can with a
passing truck. «

“Flathead”: Because he was not per-
mitted to build a two-story home, a
Sydney man settled for a place with one
floor and particularly high gables into
which he incorporated a bedroom and
bathroom. The plumbing was well under
way and the roof just on when the in-
spectors pounced with news that he would
have to either demolish or brick-off the
attic section. He chose to brick it off
(the extra materials involved didn’t seem
to worry officialdom) and will soon have
a very nice home —without a bathroom.
Probably a spot of hammer-work will
fix that up half an hour after he moves
in.

“Biggest Mac”: Meteorologists get it
in the neck so often they’ve learned to
use language that isn’t too definite. A
former Adelaide weatherman, Bromley,
once used a phrase, “Good weather at
week-end.” There was a drought on and
primary producers had ideas different
from city folk as to what constituted
good weather. Present meteorologist Mc-
Kay, steering for sheltered water, amended
an unqualified statement reported as
“Meteorologists are not always 100 per
cent, correct, but would be right 75 per
cent, of the time.” Claiming misrepre-
sentation, he said the exact words were,
“Forecasts are not always 100 per cent.
correct, but if they were only 75 per
cent, correct the user would still show
a profit.”

“Uco”; “Zake” mentions that five-bob
and four-bob bits were unpopular be-
cause of the wear and tear on trouser-
pockets (B. 25/8/’4B). The same argu-
ment caused the demise of the half-
crown, at the time of
its extinction the
most handsome coin
in circulation. At an
early stage of my
career as a merchant
prince when for a
stipend of 30 bob a
week, paid monthly,
I looked after the
firm’s postage-
stamps and petty
cash, there came
into my possession a
George 111 half-
crown, dated 1816. It
was in perfect con-
dition, and I added
it to the Yankee
dime and the French
five - centime piece
which comprised
my coin collection.
But after a few days
funds were low and
the end of the
month a long way
off, so into the petty
cash it went and out
came its equivalent
i n sixpences and
threepences. Came
payday, and I re-
deemed the treasure,
and for the next few
months old’ Farmer
George’s half-dollar
followed a regular
routine. For the first
week or so after
payday it would be in my pocket, but it
never managed to see out the month with-
out going into pawn in the cashbox. I
would probably have it still but for a
dose of ’flu which kept me home for a
couple of days late one month. To my
deputy a coin was merely worth what it
would buy—on that occasion 30 penny-
stamps. In my disgust I put the dime
and the French ha’penny in an empty
chocolate machine and retired from
numismatics.
“Melbn”: The five-bob ‘ cartwheel
minted for George V’s silver jubilee (B.
25/8/’4B) made a surprise appearance in
a Melbourne tram the other day. Con-
ductress gazed at it hypnotically and
then indignantly refused it. Nothing
would induce her to accept it as legal
tender and its owner was faced with
having to walk home. Finally a fellow-
passenger came to his assistance and lent
him tuppence. “I’ve nine more of them
in the house,” said the owner ruefully.
* * * ♦
“LA.”: Sleep disturbed by silence (B.
11/8/ ’48)? Years ago I lived at the
terminus of a Melbourne cable-tram line.
Although the cable was running all day,
its rhythmic zoom never disturbed me,
but every night at midnight, when the
cable was stopped, I invariably woke up!
No matter what time I went to bed the
cfeasing of the familiar sound never
failed to wake me.

“South Coast”: Dad was a disciple of
Coue (B. 11/8/’4B). He held that there
is no finer example of auto-suggestion
than seasickness. When we hit the Tas-
man at its worst Dad just fortified him-
self with Coue and went down to break-
fast. Ten minutes later he was back,
and he ate nothing but dry toast all the
way to Auckland. And all because he
“saw a bally officer eating stewed goose-
berries.”

“Sixty-fiver”; Can’t let “Pongo” dis-
parage old-time funeral fashions (B.
28/7/’4B), though his description is
accurate to the last inch of crepe. Now-
adays the fashion is to bury the deceased
from somebody’s funeral parlor, whither
the cadaver is transported almost before
it is cold. And how the rising generation
is cheated out of one of its most interest-
ing spectacles! To us kids of 60 years
ago a funeral was an outstanding event.
Long before the appointed hour we would
be gathered near the bereaved home,
watching for the arrival of the hearse and
mourning-coaches. Then, as the coffin
was carried out, on the shoulders of
strong men, followed by weeping rela-
tives, we watched, lined up at the gate,
with an urgent, yet respectful, curiosity;
noting whether the coffin was only
covered with plain black cloth, or was
uncovered and polished, whether there
were signs of wealth or otherwise. The
number of mourning-vehicles also held
interest; private buggies, traps and cabs
for hire. Later, in Westralia I found
townships where the hearse was unknown,
the coffin being carried all the way to the
churchyard, relays of bearers walking
behind ready to take their turn.
CHEQUES THAT “BOUNCE.”
There’s one crisp metaphor that takes my fancy,
-One pungent phrase for which we have to
thank
tjncle, and give therefor sans hesitancy
Top marks to some imaginative Yank.
Who was the first to think of it, I wonder,
And with a pleasant turn of wit denounce
All worthless promises of payment under
The memorable term of “cheques that
bounce”?
It has a meaning more direct and rawer
Than any memories you may retain .
Of documents endorsed “Refer to Drawer”
Or mild suggestions to “Present Again.”
It shows no assets to be called possessive,
No cash equivalent whereon to pounce
Sbon as it’s handed over. How expressive
And apt that terse description—“cheques
that bounce.”
The word bears implications mostly dinkum.
Who is there, for example, doesn’t enjoy
The knowledge that he earns a “bouncing”
income
Or, it may be, has sired a “bouncing” boy?
In this new setting, though, it needs no telling,
In words from those who fume or frown or
flounce,
There’s something that’s unspeakably repelling
And sinister attached to “cheques that
bounce.”
The Lord deliver us from double-dealers
Of every sort and kind, including Corns,
From noisy demagogues and spivs and spielers,
From floods and earthquakes and atomic
bombs!
And in all quarters may they find reprovers,
And'Nemesis retributively trounce
Addicts to shady mercantile manoeuvres,
The blokes responsible for “cheques that
bounce”!

This more - than - century - old wool-
broking, pastoral-finance, agency and
merchandising business keeps on expand-
ing. It is strongest in South Aust. (its
home State), and has wide connections in
Westralia and Victoria. Principal factors
in the growth of last term’s profit figure
were: (1) exceptionally high prices for
wool and livestock; (2) a good season,
except in the north of S. Aust., and heavier
clip and large yardings of livestock ; and
(3) purchase (price not disclosed) of the
70-year-old stock-and-station business
of De Garis Sons and Co., Ltd., operating
in the s.-e. portion of S. Aust.
Australia’s cheque for last season’s wool
clip was £ 155-odd millions (up £63-odd
millions), the biggest ever. After pro-
viding for contingencies and writing
£45,343 (up £8317) off premises and plant,
the spring in the co.’s gross earnings
(£1,434,851) was £238,503. Including an
extra £46,000 for taxation (£206,000),
exes. (£1,189,878) took £208,968 of the
gain. The net result (£244,973) was thus
£29,534 stronger at 8.8 p.c. on capital as
against 7.9, 6, 6.2, 6.8, 6.8, 6.9 and 7 p.c.
back to 1941. Half a point was added
to the div., making it 8 p.c., the average
for the last decade being 6f p.c.
With another satisfactory season in
prospect—except in the north of S. Aust.,
where conditions are still very dry—and
what looks like a reasonably firm price
background, the outlook for pastoral and
brokerage cos. over the next 12 months is
good. The major portion of the world’s
wool clip has been open to all to buy
freely without difficulty by way of alloca-
tion, discrimination or arbitrary price
fixation. This return to freedom has justi-
fied itself in respect of both producers
and consumers, though it has had results
less satisfactory to the latter than the
former.
Now Prime Minister Chifley has
“discovered” that some European pur-
chases of Australian wool have been for
resale to dollar areas, thus depriving Aus-
tralia of the dollars involved. This he
seeks to prevent by asking overseas
purchasers to declare to Australian ex-
change-control authorities the purpose
for which the wool is bought. What
effect, if any, this and withdrawal of the
Australian subsidy on wool bought for
local consumption will have upon prices
bid at auction is difficult to say at the
moment. Much depends upon the extent
to which American interests resume direct
purchases on the Australian market. Any
lack of strength in bids from local mill-
men is not expected to have much in-
fluence upon the general price trend, be-
cause Australia consumes only about one-
eighth of its own wool production.
The satisfactory statistical position of
the industry reflects partly the eagerness
of post-war world demand and partly
shrewd handling of accumulated war-time
stocks in conjunction with current clips
by J.O. Total wool stocks held by J.O.
have been reduced from 10,407,000 bales
at mid-1945 to about 3,500,000 bales at
end June last, an achievement at one time
thought impossible before the 1950’s were
well into their stride. The world shortage
of textiles has been so great that there
has been as yet little competition between
cotton, rayon and woollen manufacturers.
But in time it is certain to be resumed.
For this and other reasons woollen and
worsted manufacturers consider that last
season’s closing prices were unduly high.
The immediate outlook for all Merino
and fine crossbred wools is one of strong
demand.
The co.’s balance-sheet figures further
reflect the effects of season and prices,

Australian beer consumption per head
of population rose steadily from 10.34
gallons in 1936-37 to 13.43 gallons in
1945-46, and then shot up to 15.94
gallons in 1946-47. The figure for 1947-
48 is not yet available, but Q.B.’s accounts
suggest that it has continued to rise. After
allowing £30,952 (up £13,036) for depre-
ciation and whatever was considered
necessary for “contingencies,” the
cautious board figured net earnings
£2392 stronger at £123,204, best yet. It
was a surprisingly good result consider-
ing the lift in wage rates and prices gener-
ally, introduction of the 40-hour week,
the fact that barley, hops and malt were
scarce and dear, and that bottles were in
short supply, which meant that more of
the brew than usual had to be sold in
bulk, which is slightly less profitable than
the bottled stuff. Except for lifts in excise,
selling prices, fixed by officialdom, have
remained steady since 1920.
After paying the pref. div., enough of
last term’s profit remained to show 10.7
p.c. on the £1,047,432 of ord. capital,
compared with 10.5, 10, 10.5, 9, 7.9 and
6 p.c. back to 1942. Since the visible prop
for capital is none too stout, and since
money will be wanted in the business, the
div. was kept at 7 p.c., and it is doubtful
whether better need be expected for a
while.
With a fixed price for output, brewery
profits depend mainly upon the relative
levels of turnover and costs, and, in the
long-run, costs promise to be the more
stubborn of the two —they are still on
the up-grade. There is nothing in
sight at the moment to suggest a recession
in turnover. And the Government’s
policy of “full” employment, the indus-
trial and other development of the
northern State, with consequent growth
of population, and the fact that the trade
usually holds well, even in bad times,
augur well for the future. Plant is
efficient and up-to-date, and there is a
comfortable margin between earnings and
distributions. And between them Q.B.
and Castlemaine Perkins slake most of
the State’s thirst. It all gives the 7 p.c.
div. a comfortable appearance, and adds
to the attractiveness of the scrip as a
holding proposition.
During the eight years to 1940 share-
holders put up £947,815 of fresh capital
at par. The lot, and more besides, went
into fixed assets, including hotel
properties, thus widening and anchoring
turnover. Here are balance-sheet figures:

Managing-director Selwyn King retired
at the end of March, after 55 years’ service
with the co. He had succeeded his uncle,
Kelso King, the co.’s chief executive
officer from its formation in 1878 until
he retired in 1943. Alan Maitland, 32
years with the co. and secretary and
manager successively, now steps into the
vacant chair.
The Mercantile enjoys a high reputa-
tion throughout the Commonwealth, but
has never been very vigorous in the
hunt for business overseas. And, apart
from some war-time plums in the inter-
national marine pie, it hasn’t misised
much. Premium income and earnings
grew steadily during the war years, de-
spite shrinkage in motor-vehicle and
local marine business. The loss experi-
enced throughout has been moderate, and
the management has kept a tight grip
upon controllable outgoings. Since war
ended there has been a quick rise in in-
surable values which followed on the
heels of inflation, full employment and
expanding volume of trade.
The spring of £15,462 in last term’s
profit figure (£81,541) was the result of
a bigger premium income and a more
favorable loss experience. An extra
£230,068 of gross premiums (£1,104,702)
was gathered, but reinsurances (£587,968)
were £156,748 heavier, leaving the gain
in net premiums at £73,320:

Despite the unsatisfactory nature of
motor-vehicle and third-party risks, the
overall loss rate was £2 p.c. lighter, and
the larger business was handled at Bs.
p.c. less cost. Gross underwriting sur-
plus was £14,955 stronger at £55,409, of
which £20,000, together with another
£20,000 from inner accumulations, was
added to the reserve for unexpired risks,
making it £240,000, equal to 46.4 p.c. of
the year’s net premium income—4o p.c. is
usually considered adequate. There was
little change in the return from invest-
ments (£26,132, up £507). Deducting the
appropriation to reserve for unexpired
risks, the year’s net result from all
sources was £61,541 (up £15,462), or 15.3
p.c, on capital as against 11.5, 13.6, and
15.7 p.c. for the three preceding years.
So the board added 2 p.c. to the div.,
making it a liberal 12 p.c. Whether that
rate can be maintained will depend en-
tirely upon underwriting results, which in
turn are governed largely by the loss rate.
Both policyholders and shareholders
are well protected, and assets are worth
more than their book-value, as the dis-
closure of inner reserves suggests:

The drop in profit and cut in the div.
fitted in pretty well with market antici-
pations. In June, 1947, the price of "the
f.-p. pound ords. fell from 31s. 4d. to
295. The figure last week-end was 295.

295. also yield a shade over 4 p.c. Includ-
ing the depreciation reserve (£130,000),
net tangible cover is £24 11s, prefs. and
335. 6d. ords.
After allowing for depreciation
(£10,000) and taxation (£15,000) —same
amounts as for the previous term —there
was a drop of £6440 in net earnings,
making the contraction £35,255 over the
last three years. The £27,105 of profit,
lowest since 1933, covered the pref. div.
and 5.3 p.c. on the £467,003 of ord. capi-
tal, compared with 6.7, 11.3, 12.9, 12.4,
10.2, 7.5, 7.6 and 7 p.c. back to 1940.
Another point was chipped off the div.,
reducing it to 6 p.c. For the five war
years to the close of accounts in 1945
net earnings averaged £49,190, compared
with averages of £33,953, £13,902 and
£52,685 for each of the three preceding
quinquenniums.
The trouble has been, and still is, the
rapid growth of costs in relation to turn-
over, a development to which net earn-
ings of large and fashionable hotels like
the Australia, which have to maintain a
high standard of service and comfort, are
particularly sensitive. Last term guest
occupancy was satisfactory and turnover
was “well maintained in most direc-
tions” ; this despite restricted travel
facilities and the Sydney brewery strike,
which interfered with beer deliveries and
takings during part of the last half of the
term. The benefit from the small in-
crease authorised in meal prices was
shortlived, owing to the steep rise in costs

tion of the 40-hour week and rise in

Way back in 1896, an expedition from Queensland found
sugar cane growing wild in the jungles of New Guinea.
In 1914 a special party of C.S.R. Co. scientists brought
back specimens of a high quality native cane. This cane
was crossed with strains from India, Barbados and
Mauritius. From this mixed pedigree a new champion
cane called “Trojan” was bred.

This co. is on the stocks in
Sydney with a nominal capital
of £200,000 in ss. shares, of
which 430,000 —underwritten by
Sydney broker G. D. Wharton
at 3d. a share —are offered,
2s. 6d. each on application and
the balance as required. The ven-
dor, D. I. Hartley, takes 170,000
paids (no cash) for leases, leav-
ing 200,000 shares in pickle.
The money is to be used £10,400
building and plant, £750 pre-
liminary exes., £5375 brokerage
arid the balance working capital.
The board may proceed to allot-
ment when 303,200 of the shares
offered are subscribed.
It is a prospecting proposition
which appears, on geological
evidence, to have possibilities,
testified to by M. R. McKeown,
F. Grey-Wilson, W. Barag-
wanath, B. V. Barton, F. B.
Stephens and George Lane. The
idea is to take over, dewater
and investigate half a dozen
goldmining leases, embracing the
old Ajax group, near Dayles-
ford, Victoria. From the be-
ginning of this cenCury to 1926
the five Ajax mines together
treated 546,286 tons ore for
269,0380 z. gold, an average of
9.86dwt., and paid £388,394 in
divs. They gaye up because of
rising costs, lack of funds and
the low price of gold. It is be-
lieved that about 300,000 tons of
7dwt. ore has been left in the
.mines above bottom levels.
Deepest shaft is the Central
Ajax, 1450 ft. There is no
evidence of falling-off in values
at depth. * The folded and
heavily-faulted sandstones and
slates have been worked to a>
depth of about 900 ft. The
Central Ajax shaft bottomed on
a saddle-reef, similar to the
Bendigo series. Only explora-
tion above and below 1450 ft.
can determine whether the pros-
pect will develop into a worth-
while mine. If it does a lot
more capital will be needed.

Keown, F. Grey-Wilson and G.

A two-months investigation of
black-sand deposits on some 200
miles of the Queensland coast,
between Southport and Fraser
Island, was recently made by
Government geologist T. H.
Connah. The work was
financed by the Commonwealth
as part of the hunt for radio-
active minerals, of which mona-
zite is one. The aim was to de-
lineate the approximate mineral
composition and extent of all
major concentrations of buried
heavy minerals, and so deter-
mine areas, that might be profi-
tably worked, for further investi-
gation. Such areas were found
to be confined to the southern
sides of Indian Head (Fraser
Island), Noo s a Headland,
Double Island Point and Cape
Cliff (Moreton Island), and also
a section of North Stradbroke
Island. The black-sand con-
centrates of Stradbroke Island
contain rutile in proportions
comparable to the beaches now
being profitably worked between
Southport and the N. S. Wales
border, and also carry a small
amount of zircon. Further
north ilmenite is everywhere the
predominant mineral, with zir-
con and rutile also present.
Monazite was found as a minor
constituent (mostly less than
1 p.c.) of the black sands
on practically all beaches ex-
amined. Whether its extraction
is a practicable and worth-while
proposition has yet to be deter-
mined.

Currency and Costs
The economic eggs laid by the
1939-45 war and incubated by
the public administrations of the
period are beginning to hatch
out. Where war and Socialism
and/or Communism combined
to fertilise the egg the chicken
looks like being of a particularly
nasty strain. It seems as though
democratic government will
eventually have to take the axe
to the British, Australian and
Maoriland economic chidcens
and see that the weapon is used
in the right place—that is, in the
neck.
the revaluation of the New
Zealand £ by bringing it back
to parity with sterling is in-
tended by the Maoriland
Socialists to reduce the cost of
living in the Dominion. It will,
it is hoped, bring down the cost
of imported goods by 20 p.c.,
and so alter the complexion of
the country’s internal price
structure. It is contended that
the high prices which the farmers
are receiving abroad for their
produce, combined with the use
of equalisation funds estab-
lished in years past from the
sale of land products, will com-
pensate for the loss of the “ex-
port premium” that exporters
have come to rely upon over the
past 15 years.
But this exchange-rate mani-
pulation is only a financial
manoeuvre—a readjustment that
makes something cheaper for
one person at the expense of
another. It does not make
the cost of living any lower for
the country as a whole. Cer-
tainly it can be used as a re-
adjustment at times with good
political and psychological effect
upon the entire community.
But no lasting good will be re-
ceived from the Maoriland move
unless an attempt is made by
the community—and particu-
larly the trade-union section—
to reduce real production costs
by increasing output per man
per hour.
In Australia and New Zea-
land, because of the high cost
of British and U.S. goods at
current rates of exchange, a
great deal has been made of our
apparently “low” costs. But
even at $3.20 to the £ the U.S.A.
finds our wool at present prices
“too expensive,” recent tariff
concessions notwithstanding.
During the war every bel-
ligerent created an excess of
paper money because of muni-
tions-production and mobilisa-
tion of manpower for war pur-
poses: there was a great deal
of activity and payment for ser-
vices, but an inadequate supply
of civilian goods to be bought
out of wages and pay. Since the
war Communists have intro-
duced a “cold war” to industry,
sabotaging production, and
Socialist Governments have not
been game to enforce industrial
law. But they have encouraged
the working of a shorter week,
and have taken manpower away
from productive industry. In
our part of the globe production
has fallen far below consumer
demand, and production costs
have soared.
There is too much loafing
among trade-unionism in New
Zealand ; too much is being paid
in wages in a short working
week for which too little is re-
ceived in return. The altered
value of the £NZ will, through
reducing the cost of imports,
place additional purchasing-
power in the hands of trade-
unionists unless their wages are
reduced by 20 p.c,, or something
like jt—a quite unlikely happen-
ing. The proprietary and in-
vestment side of industry will, on
the whole, again be sufferers
from Socialist Government
financial action. Profit-margins
will tend to shrink, and there
may be losses on merchandise
stocks in hand.
In Australia the possibility of
an exchange-rate adjustment
along Maoriland lines involves
many more factors, and raises
questions considerably more
complex. But the situation may
perhaps be best summed up this
way: When the Australian £
was depreciated in the early
1930’s it was soon followed by
a nation-wide attempt to get
costs down, to increase the pro-
duction of saleable goods and
fo restrict output of those things
which were not so readily dis-
posed of. And an effort was
made to keep the tax burden as
“Dad says his new hobby's more profitable than
stamp-collecting."
light as possible at a time when
Budgets were sadly off balance.
'Actually taxation was increased
to finance unemployment-relief
in most States, and perhaps in
a political atmosphere more
stable than that existing at the
onset of depression the whole
operation could have been
carried out with less hard-
ship than was actually experi-
enced. But labor at the start
was rebellious and badly led,
and the Premiers’ Plan had this
problem to contend with as well
as the purely financial ones. As
a result of the Plan and the co-
operation of the Australian
people, a comparatively rapid
emergence from the depression
was achieved.
We are approaching an infla-
tionary crisis now that is just as
threatening as the depression of
the early ’3o’s. We are already
in a production depression —
some will say it is the reverse
of the 1930 affair. But the pre-
sent crisis and the situation of
18 years ago have this in com-
mon : costs-inflation is the
problem-in-chief.
This costs-inflation is not go-
ing to be beaten merely by re-
valuing our currency in an up-
ward way. As in New Zealand,
we now have to increase output
per man-hour and thus increase
overall production. Output in
relation to wages paid also must
be increased. Coal must be dug
at a greater rate in order to give
industry the fuel and power it
needs. Only by increased
efforts from the population as
a whole will the production de-
pression be beaten. That is so
obvious that it scarcely needs
stating. But in Maoriland the
Socialist Government has not
attempted to enforce industrial
discipline so as to raise output
per man as a preliminary to its
exchange - adjustment policy.
And, on form, it is even less
likely that the Canberra Social-
ists would attempt to enforce
industrial law and order, or to
switch from a financial policy
that takes most of the incentive
out of production and dis-
courages investment in new in-
dustries.
Without a change in industrial
policy—that is, without a return
to the enforcement of discipline
in trade-unions—an increase in
productivity and a lightening of
the monetary extravagance and
waste of manpower that is a
result of the Canberra Socialist
administration, it would be use-
less to expect any lasting bene-
fit to accrue to Australia from
an appreciation of our exchange
rate. If we are to attempt to
cope with the inflation that daily
becomes more menacing we
must discontinue following a
political-industrial policy that
creates more money than goods.
And we would probably find, in
a world eventually becoming
fully productive, that, in terms
of gold, our currency is already
overvalued, even though some
other currencies, such as sterling,
are more so.
On the record of . its perform-
ances to date, we may assume
that Canberra “Labor” will not
attempt to enforce industrial
discipline, will not materially re-
duce the burden of taxation,
will not be able to achieve
greater production per man-
hour, will not encourage private
initiative in a healthy way, and
will not, therefore, succeed in
overcoming our present produc-
tion depression. That being so,
any juggling with the exchange
rate would be to our disadvan-
tage, and would, if it resulted in
a move of more than 10 p.c.
up or down, be a breach of our
Bretton Woods undertaking.
Zinc Corporation
Last -week's fall in Zinc Cor-
poration scrip was a local affair.
There has been no change in the
London quotations (from which
we largely take our cue), but it
is the rate at which those sterling
prices should be converted into
Australian currency that has
seemed dubious since the Maori-
land action.
The co. has lately begun ex-
porting lead to dollar countries,
at the Government’s behest. Mr.
Chifley’s remarks still suggest
that he will only appreciate the
£A in terms of a £ sterling that
has previously depreciated itself
against dollars. In that case any
rise in £A would have automati-
cally entailed greater sterling re-
ceipts by the co. from its dollar
exports.
Be this as it may, the world
price of lead remains as the most
important long-term question
for Zinc Corp. Figures given in
last year’s accounts suggest that
lead was responsible for about
80 p.c. of the co.’s gross mining
receipts (after paying the lead
bonus), and only the remaining
20 p.c. came from zinc and
silver. As yet there is no sign
of weakness in lead prices ; on
the contrary, U.S. quotes ad-
vanced a few weeks ago to a
figure equivalent to £lO6 ster-
ling.
Important changes can be ex-
pected in the co.’s next accounts
following the acceptance of its
offers to purchase Sulphide Cor-
poration and the ordinary
capital in Imperial Smelting
Corporation.

The Exchange Rate
The New Zealand pound has
left Australia’s behind in a sud-
den leap to par, and many Maori-
landers don’t know whether to
thank their lucky stars that
they’re on their side of the Tas-
man or to wish themselves in
the Commonwealth. It’s a pain-
ful operation getting down from
125 to a 100 exchange at one
step, and N.Z. has plenty of
worries ahead. But if it had to
be made the move is probably
fairly well timed. Export prices
are at their peak, and Maori-
land, the world’s biggest per-
capita exporter, thinks the long
15-year rise since it forced up
the exchange to 125 in January,
1933, has ended. Prices might
hold a while, but few people ex-
pect them to go higher.
New Zealand didn’t have to
consult the International Mone-
tary Fund or anybody else when
it considered the idea, for it is
outside the plan. Australia, in-
side, has to keep in step with
I.M.F. members, and can’t
change its pound by more than
10 p.c. unless the fund agrees.
That’s awkward for future M.L.
and Australian parity, and
seems to leave a margin of 15
p.c. that can’t be bridged.
In dollar value, N.Z. currency,
like sterling, is now four to the
pound.
There’s a hefty cut in M.L.’s
debt, from £lOO million to £BO
million, to John Bull, but
against this exchange funds are
chopped by £lB million to £74
million (Reserve Bank and trad-
ing banks). It’s not the banks’
pigeon, because the liability is
on the Government. Producers
will be wanting protection, too,
and they’ve got it in millions
hoarded in meat and dairy pools.
Funds tucked away from sales
of meat, hides and sheepskins,
over £23 million, should come
in handy soon. Dairyfarmers
haven’t quite that much, but the
figure is well into eight figures.
There shouldn’t be much danger
that, under bulk contracts with
Britain for years ahead, and with
these pools in the background,
Maoriland producers will have
to take an early cut in in-
come. So Labor bigwigs
shouldn’t be harrassed by
attacks from that quarter.
In business the going might
not be so easy. It is tougher
getting prices' down than up,
and traders won’t wapt to sacri-
fice on goods bought at the 125
rate. They’ll have to take some
loss, but how much? How long
can old and new price-levels
survive together? Sooner or
later the old must go to the wall.
This concerns manufacturers,
too, who don’t relish the pros-
pect of cheaper imports.
Mr. Nash Explains
In a broadcast to Maori-
landers:, Finance Minister Nash
on August 22 said that since
1933 £125 was received in New
Zealand for £lOO-worth of pro-
duce sold in Britain, On the
other hand, the community had
to pay £125 for what it had been
able to buy previously for £lOO.
There was never a more suit-
able time than the present to
make an adjustment in the ex-
change rate. The devaluation of
the pound had been effected
primarily to help Maoriland
farmers out of the slump and to
save them from bankruptcy.
Present long - term contracts
would now secure stability for a
long period. It was expected
that prices would continue high,
as they had for wool, and the
payout to the dairyfarmer would
not be affected. Dairyfarmers
and apple-producers received a
guaranteed price for their pro-
ducts, and they need not receive
less. The farmers’ costs would
be reduced as a result of the
lower prices for farm requisites,
and they would also benefit
from the lower cost of living.
Farm produce not normally
exported would not be adversely
affected, while the producers of
these commodities would receive
the benefit of lower costs.
The Government would con-
tinue to operate its guaranteed-
price procedure as the best
means of security and prosperity,
and it was prepared to consider
measures to meet costs of pro-
duction if these were desired.
The stabilisation-pool accounts
were now worth more in terms
of the lower price farmers would
pay for imports. The purchas-
ing-power of the money in the
pool accounts was greater. The
same applied to all savings. Mr.
Nash said thefe might be some
particular difficulty to those im-
porters holding stocks bought
at the old rate. He was
convinced on the evidence of
demand that they should be able
to clear a fairly large portion of
their goods before goods I ' bought
at the new rate arrived in any
quantity. The restoration to
parity did not mean that there
Would be more goods available
in imports.
There would be some direct
gain to overseas residents deriv-
ing fixed incomes from Maori-
land and pensioners and the like.
Others outside New Zealand
with property and investments
there would slightly benefit.
There would be considerable
benefit in the amount required
to meet national and local-body
debt overseas. Visits overseas
would cost less.
It was the Government’s firm
intention to adhere to its price-
control policy. Some New Zea-
land manufacturers would have
to meet sharper competition, and
the Government intended to see
they were adequately protected,
and to the extent that they were
producing necessary goods at
anything like comparable prices
they would get the protection
they needed.
Nothing had been done
which would hurt Britain, added
Mr. Nash. On the con-
trary. The sterling price for
goods remained unchanged, arid
British manufacturers would
find New Zealand a better mar-
ket because their goods could
be sold there cheaper.
The real costs: of imports
from dollar sources would not
change to the extent that dol-
lars had to be found. But
whereas the dollar had been
worth 6s. 4d., it was now worth
4s. 10d., and the disparity which
had previously existed whereby
Maorilanders had sometimes to
pay high prices for dollar goods,
while dollar sources could pur-
chase N.Z. goods at a lower
price, would be removed.
It had been suggested, con-
cluded the Minister, that 1 the
action taken was contrary to the
Geneva Agreement, which Par-
liament ratified recently. This
was not so. It was provided
under the Geneva Agreement
that the signatories should not
by exchange action frustrate the
principles: of the agreement. All
those principles were in the direc-
tion of encouraging trade, and the
action which had been taken
would be one which would facili-
tate imports. That was precisely
what the Geneva Agreement in-
tended to bring about.
Maorilanders holding Aus-
tralian shares—and many do —
will now receive only £lOO N.Z.
for every £125 Australian (or
thereabouts) transmitted from
the Commonwealth in the form
of dividends on Australian in-
vestments. A weakening in the
price of Australian shares on
Maorilapd Stock Exchanges has
followed, pending any further
move in the Empire exchanges.
But many Maorilanders would
like to be free to buy additional
Australian scrip at the new rate
of exchange.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Broadcast Olivier.
A.B.C. is to be congratulated
on its serious attempt to share
Laurence Olivier and his Old
Vies among those who could not
see their shows. That the broad-
casts were not always a success
doesn’t detract from that good
intention, and may not have
been the fault of the players,
either. The failures were prob-
ably the inevitable outcome of
mediums that won’t mix.
The most obvious failure was
the “School for Scandal” show ;
the most painful, the “Hamlet.”
What the “School for Scandal”
broadcast chiefly demonstrated
was the difference between
theatre and radio-studio as play
mediums. Done direct per
studio by the same company—
or, in fact, any cast of reason-
ably good players—the Sheridan
comedy would be first-rate
radio. It’s no fault of what’s in
the play that at least 50 per cent,
was lost in the broadcast. If
A.B.C. was experimenting it
couldn’t have had a better lesson
in what it surely must have
known already that theatre
directly broadcast can’t help
being radio hash.
Still, the “School for Scan-
dal” broadcast had at least the
interest attaching to the broad-
casting of any special event. For
anyone with some background
of past theatregoing it must
have revived that atmosphere
which belongs peculiarly to the
theatre and which probably will
enable the stage to survive, as
incomparably the greatest art-
medium among them, against
radio and films, and no doubt
television as well. Also, to any-
one listening with the very
necessary assistance of the book
in his hand, the broadcast
showed Olivier as that extreme
rarity an actor-producer intelli-
gent enough to “cut” not merely
for time purposes but to im-
prove the play. What was cut
was redundant anyway.
Next A.B.C. turned to broad-
casting excerpts from Olivier's
filmed “Hamlet,” and this was
about as dull and unprofitable as
even radio ever managed. The
charitable and perhaps the
right—view of it could be that
film sound-track is, if anything,
actually worse than direct stage-
theatre for broadcasting. That
in fairness allowed, the Olivier
Hamlet who came over the air
was something incredible. No
doubt the film itself is all that
enthusiasm claims for it; no
doubt, too, film technique calls
for its own special kind of voice-
delivery to achieve its effects.
Translated from the sound-track
to radio the effect was, of all
things wonderful, an oily Ham-
let! The Olivier voice fairly
oozed and dripped. It gave the
impression of an actor substitut-
ing the sentimental business of
the sloppiest film-crooner ever
spawned for a total lack of the
dramatic intensity without which
Hamlet is the ranting barn-
stormer usually served up to
school-kids, or a sentimental
clown reading to himself in an
armchair. The film-cw/n-radio
Olivier Hamlet doesn’t rant. He
does this sort of thing (voice
husky, throaty, whispery and
horribly sweet) “O that this too,
too solid flesh” —pause, as if
groping for the word that will
fairly rock ’em ; then —“would
melt,” this last appearing to be
uttered by a Hamlet personally
astonished by the idea.
And so on through the film-
c«m-radio version a most
monstrous Hamlet, without
character and without fire ; talk-
ing in whispers like an actor with
a bad cold, “But the play must
go on, laddie” ; puzzled all the
time, not at himself, not at
what’s in his mind, but at the
part he’s been called upon to
play.
Next night A.8.C., valiant
throughout, announced more
Olivier-Shakspeare excerpts, but
this scribe, for one, gave them a
miss ; after all, radio has that
advantage. So the painful im-
pression of Olivier as a fruity
Hamlet —no fault of his, no
doubt, for the medium-reasons
given—would have remained
but for A.B.C. persevering on to
its broadcast of the Olivier
“Richard III” ; recorded during
an actual performance at Sydney
Tivoli, but, by the technical
marvels of these blasd times,
shorn of pretty well all theatre
interferences except the well-
merited applause, and the
astonishment of Olivier going to
Milton for his curtain-speech.
The play, too, had been cut and
otherwise adapted for broadcast-
ing ; a technical triumph, and
the outcome excellent radio.
Most important, it left the alto-
gether happier impression of
Olivier as one of the really fine
Shakspearean actors.
"Annie Get Your Gun."
“The real Annie Oakley,” it is
recorded, “could hit two-inch
flying balls by taking sight in the
shiny surface of a bowie-blade;
shoot cigarettes from her
husband’s mouth with a .22;
shoot a dime from between her
husband’s thumb and forefinger
at 30 paces with a .22; and,
using three double-barrelled guns
at once, puncture in mid-air six
balls sprung simultaneously from
as many traps.”
Her main concern in the musi-
comedy, at Sydney Royal, how-
ever, is not her gun, but her man,
who is elusive, not, as might
reasonably be concluded, from
any fear of the lady’s marksman-
ship, but because of a deep-green
jealousy of her superiority to
himself in that line. With the
help of a twisted foresight,
feminine instinct and some
advice from Chief Sitting Bull,
however, Annie finally bags the
fellow after a shooting-match in
which she scores a dozen or so
outers to his 12 bulls, thus estab-
lishing a satisfactory inferiority
for herself in the prospective
matrimonial set-up.
All of it is done to, or carried
by, the accompaniment of such
by now common and catchy
Berlin ditties as “Doin’ What
Comes Naturally,” “The Girl
That I Marry,” “You Can’t Get
a Man with a Gun,” “Show
Business,” “Anything You Can
Do I Can Do Better” and several
others ; all of it is dressed up like
a chocolate-box; and all of it
is played out with tremendous
and infectious enthusiasm by
Evie Hayes as Annie; baritone
Webb Tilton as her matrimonial
target; Carl Randall (also the
producer) as the publicity mer-
chant of the Wild West Show ;
and a string of other
including Claude Flemming as
Buffalo Bill and Sydney Wheeler
as Chief Sitting Bull, remark-
ably expressive with such pro-
found remarks as “Ugh,”
“Urgmph” and “How.”
Studio of Realist Art.
Sidney Nolan’s “Prospector,”
at the Studio of Realist Art’s ex-
hibition at David Jones' Gallery,
is a large free composition with
sunbaked earth and a stretch of
blue and sunny sky—something
of a rarity at contemporary art
shows and a pleasant relief after
Bernard Sahm’s ape-like poli-
ticians, Hedstrom’s concrete-
mixer and Clive Guthrie’s Bal-
main landscape.
But Nolan’s prospector, if he
is alive, is not very Australian.
He has a European type of
beard, wears a neat jersey and
resembles, in fact, a French
sailor more than an Australian
gold-digger. Which, of course,
if he had been labelled “Matelot
en plein air,” or something of
the sort, would be quite all
right. But the title is misleading,
and, on closer inspection, so is
the landscape. It is welcome, be-
cause it is refreshing, but it
brings to mind Van Gogh’s corn-
fields as readily as Australian
skies.
Ronald Wakelin’s “Gasometer
at Night,” despite good corn-
position and skilful painting, is
a not very successful attempt to
extract poetry from a gasometer.
Hal Missingham has some
sketches of rather ungainly
nudes, Eric Putland has com-
petently painted aboriginal heads
and Roderic Shaw’s “Fisher-
men” is an interestingly
picture, with a flashing, spidery
line giving a hint of action and
of the phosphorescence of water.
Tivoli.
The Old Vic. has gone from
Sydney’s Tivoli and Ben Blue
has come. The new show,
“Happy and Glorious,” brought
on a form of drowsiness, and in
the half-light there seemed to be
a phantom gliding around the
aisles, looking suspiciously like
the ghost of Richard 111, who
begged to see a programme, and
then broke into a lament:
How long until this shade of mine
can pass
Out of this hall of torment, out to
grass?
The powers, frowning on my homi-
cide.
Have said “For fitting torment you
must bide
Your time in watching Hollywood’s
Ben Blue.”
A horse! A horse! A bloody axe!
Any bloody thing at all will do!
A little later, surprised, he
broke into a smile, for the show
proved at last that there was
something glorious in it. Laurel
Martin’s Ballet Guild, with
Martin Rubinstein as featured
dancer, counteracted in a
moment all that had gone weakly
before them. They were at their
best in “Old Ivory of China,” a
phantasy with such splendid set-
tings that whenever the ballet
paused in its movements it was
an ivory carving.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
A cloudless sky and warm sun favored
the Moonee Valley August race-meeting.
Dressing was go as you please, though
the well-cut grey suit with London-tan
accessories won the sartorial stakes. A
few brave souls came out in short-sleeved
silk frocks, and colored reptile shoes and
bags lent color to many ensembles. Mrs.
Norman Bennett wore grey lizard shoes
with her grey tailored suit and small
matching hat, Robin Walters, whose
jacket suit featured a fully-pleated skirt,
chose London-tan accessories. Mrs. John
Shepherd had white ermine tails on the
pockets of her brown fishtail jacket, worn
with a slimly-cut skirt and off-the-face
hat. Mrs. David Knox was smartly
garbed in dark grey and wore a
green-and-brown beret with tiny gold
leaves around the brim. Mary Morris
chose deep cyclamen and her hat was of
blue for contrast. Lady Wales, in navy-
blue, and June Manson, under a hat with
gay field-flowers and in a junior navy
jacket suit, were there. So was Loris
Nettle berg’s little beige straw bonnet an d
beige wool suit. Rosemary Chenhall, of
Sydney, in a bois-du-rose jacket suit and
small hat with bright-lime feather, was
with Honor Furzemorice, who chose
tailored aqua-blue wool romaine and
small matching hat. Lady Clarke wore
an amber-toned wool frock under a black
Persian-lamb coat and a white platter-
hat edged and banded in London-tan.
Mrs. Ken Forge chose red angora with
dyed ermine furs and a large black hat.
Hilda Corbett was attractive in a gold-
belted grey frock over which was a full-
length grey wool coat, made with a full
swinging back and a draped collar banded
in mink to match the bands on the full
sleeves. For contrast she wore a japonica-
red straw hat.
Mrs. Guy Bakewell, senior vice-presi-
dent of the Victoria League, received
Lord and Lady Davidson and their
daughter Jean as the guests of the League
at an afternoon party. Lady Davidson,
one of two women Conservatives in the
Commons, gave a short address stressing
Britain’s strength and stability. She com-
plimented the League on its work, doing
so in a black frock and off-the-face black
hat trimmed with ospreys. Her daughter
chose a grey checked suit and small beret
trimmed with matching satin ribbon.
Members present included Mrs. George
Vasey, who wore a black ostrich-feather-
wreathed hat with her black suit, and
Mrs. Roy Chambers, in a jacket suit of
French grey with a matching hat. Mrs.
J. Gilruth was there with news fipm her
daughter Margaret, of the British Em-
bassy in Cairo, to the effect that Margaret
Ratz, formerly of this city, has also
joined the Embassy staff. Chairman of
the Young Contingent, Kay Hughes, and
members of her committee assisted.
For the decor of their annual ball in
St. Kilda Town Hall, advertising
men used display stuff which ranged
from small showcards to street-poster
panels, massed balloons and the usual
party favors. At midnight “Gink’s
Gazette” was published and seven lovelies
paraded. Chosen as Miss Advertising
was Rae Haddon, fairylike in a bouffant
white tulle gown. Now she enters the
Miss Australia quest of 1948. Wife of
the president of the Vic. Institute of
Advertising, Mrs. W. H. McKechnie,
wore a satin gown of forest-green featur-
ing a graceful full skirt and a draped off-
the-shoulder bodice. Mrs. Patrick Hamil-
ton was in black satin, and in black
draperies was Mrs. Eric Pearce. Dr.
Margaret Mackay, who judged the Miss
Advertising contest, was accompanied by
her medico husband, Dr. John Ray, and
her fuchsia-toned crepe gown was high-
lighted by a full skirt and diamente en-
crustations on the bodice, Mrs. John
Warlow’s white satin gown was printed
in muted shades of lime and yellow,
mingling with black, the skirt bustled and
the bodice held by one shoulder-strap.
Mrs. Margaret Saker, organiser of the
Miss Australia quest, wore a pastel-blue
crepe evening jacket suit. Trixie John-
son, smart in primrose crepe, brought
along Daphne Rye, producer of “Present
Laughter,” who draped a platina-fox
stole over her shoulders as a contrast to
a picture frock of bois-du-rose-figured
taffeta. Daphne Newton, leading lady in
“Present Laughter,” wore lemon-and-
white-striped taffeta, and Mrs, Leo Britt,
whose husband is in the show, chose soft
sage-green crepe brightened with gold
sequins. Jean Darragh wore pastel-blue
georgette, the bodice shirred into the
figure and the full skirt draped over a
matching taffeta hem. Mrs. Leo Cantwell
shimmered in close-fitting royal-blue
sequins.
Jacob Lateiner, pianist, here for the
A.8.C., was another of those infant pro-
digies. He was seven when he gave his
first public appearance. Born in Havana,
of Polish parents, he is a solemn young
man of 19, but he made the piano sing
Beethoven, Brahms and Liszt. In the
large audience, which was very casually
dressed, only two women wore formal
evening gowns, Mrs. Conrad Charlton, in
midnight-blue chenille velvet, and Bonnie
McCallum, in black tulle over an under-
skirt of black taffeta banded in pastel-
pink and -green. Mavis Hotmer’s black
satin ballerina skirt was worn with a
smart knitted evening sweater in tur-
quoise-blue with black motifs, and Rita
Benson was in a smart black ensemble.
Theatre-lovers appreciate the work
done by Irene Mitchell, pictured here.
An associate director of the Little
Theatre, she has produced many plays.
Some years ago she did “The Women,”
and her latest, “All My Sons,” won
applause from Daphne Rye, who is in
Australia to produce Coward’s “Present
Laughter.” Irene is on the advisory board
at the Uni. and interviews students who
intend taking up drama. Every year she
produces pageants at the Town Hall for
church bodies.
The costumes worn by the players in
“The Barber of Seville” were the only
bright notes in the theatre ; the dressing
of the feminine audience was rather sub-
dued. An exception was Mrs. Lionel
Newton in an aqua-blue wool, military
cape, with a trimming of cyclamen and
gold sequins. Mrs. P. L. Coleman chose
a ballerina frock of black lace and chiffon,
and Mrs. R. Joseph, who accompanied
her, was in more formal black. Both
snuggled into fur wraps. Mrs. Arthur
Wenzel was with her daughter, Mrs.
Geoff Cohen, and the John Kaufmans
came from Mt. Eliza for the* premiere.
Barbara Kaufman struck a patriotic note
in royal-blue taffeta, scarlet sash and
white lamb coat. Over her pastel-blue
crepe gown Mrs. Gordon Reid wore a
three-quarter Arctic-fox coat and gar-
denias in her hair. June Richardson chose
a ballerina frock of red-white-and-black
taffeta, and Mrs. Myer Sutherland, back
from Queensland, showed her tan in a
pale-blue lace gown and a wrap of dyed
ermine. Mrs. Curtis Wilson wore black
moire taffeta, highlighted by a bouffant
bustle bow and a bolero of mink. Tommy
Cochran sat in the stage box with Signor
Franco Ghione, who did not conduct on
the opening night, and Signora Ghione.
Mrs. Alfred Fowler wore ice-blue crepe
with pearl beading. Also in blue was
Mrs. J. Gillespie Edmond, who was with
Mrs. Frank Tait.
Beryl Hadley staged her spring hat
show in her Marne-street apartment.
Flowers showed up the cedar furniture,
and as guests sipped sherry Mesdames
lan Potter, Elizabeth Draffin, Douglas
Calder and Anne Wilton showed the hats.
Beryl wore a multicolored frock with a
black background and her natural straw
hat was turned off-the-face. The hats?
Well, there was Dolly Varden, in fine
grey straw, small and off-the-face,
trimmed with cerise taffeta ribbons on
one side, grey taffeta on the other. Pink
Pierrette was a close-fitting modified
boater, fashioned of pale-pink straw and
trimmed with ruchings of tulle. Swan
Lake was trimmed with a large white
wing which swooped across the front.
Mrs. Eric Wilton saw daughter Anne
parade. Ros. Wayne could have passed
as a mannequin ; her grey frock was worn
with a red hat trimmed with white
feathers. Mrs. Allan Tait brought Dr. and
Mrs. Harper, of N.Z., and other chapeau
fanciers were Mesdames Allan Walters,
Arthur Wilson and Russell Gourlay—she
wearing a small black hat trimmed with
pink roses above a tailored black suit.
Kathleen Robinson chose black taffeta
with a small black hat trimmed with blue
ospreys.
From Sydney
Not to be forgotten! This is Legacy
Week, and our chance to pay a little of
the debt we owe our soldiers, by helping
the soldiers’ children.
The Royal Tour was the most talked-
of news last week. Details of the 18-
days visit of the King and Queen and
Princess Margaret to this State and Can-
berra were announced by the Prime
Minister. The party arrives in Sydney
on April 4 of next year. The Royalties
will make the journey from England in
H.M.S. Vanguard. The battleship will
anchor in Athol Bight at 9.30 a.m. and
at 10.40 will land the welcome visitors
at Farm Cove. They will drive through
a city beflagged and gay with excite-
ment, and in the evening from Govern-
ment House they will view a Venetian
Carnival in Farm Cove.
Tucked into the arrangements are a
Lord Mayor’s Ball, a Government House
garden party, the opening of Parliament,
the opening of the Show, a race meeting
at Randwick, a schoolchildren’s display,
a rally of ex-servicemen and -women in
the Domain, and a Command Perform-
ance of the City of Sydney Symphony
Orchestra. The Royalties will also visit
16 country centres in this State. The
Minister in charge of the tour is Senator
Armstrong, and the director is Lieut-
General F, H. Berryman. He is just
returned from England, where, with
Senator Armstrong, he discussed the pro-
gramme in detail with their Majesties at
Buckingham Palace. And there’s no
buckram about that Royal household,
according to the General. Everybody is
friendly and easy to talk to. The Queen’s
charm is something that has to be met
to be believed.
Mrs. W. C. Hopper, wife of Dr.
Hopper, Canadian Government Trade
Commissioner (agricultural specialist),
will be missed from social Sydney when
she and her husband leave us in October.
They return to Ottawa by way of Maori-
land, where they will stay for about six
months. At present Dr. and Mrs. Hopper
are making an extensive tour of Can-
berra, New South Wales and Victoria.
They have already, in their year in Aus-
tralia, seen most of this country except
the middle of it—Alice Springs and its
neighborhood. They look forward on
their return to reunion with son David,
now in third-year science at McGill Uni-
versity. Peter, who returned in the
Aorangi, is entering the same university
to study medicine. Youngest boy, Billie,
is still with his parents in Sydney.

Annie and her gun proved as fascinat-
ing in her first nigjit at Sydney Royal as
she had been in Melbourne. “The Firm”
broke away from the Saturday-opening
tradition and declared Friday the festive
night. The theatre was packed. Everybody
wore their best, but a few forgot their
good manners at crowded angles in foyer
and on the stairs. Silks and satins shone,
chiffons swirled, there was less costume
jewellery, and furs were mostly platina,
blue fox, or mink. The Governor, Lieut.-
General Northcott, came with daughter
Elizabeth and a party from Government
House, which included Sheila Collett.
They were ushered to the front row of
the dress-circle by The Firm’s Harald
Bowden. There were flowers for Eliza-
beth and programmes for all.
Singer Anne Ziegler beautified a box on
the left of the stage. Companion in
good looks and rich frocking was Mrs.
Frank Tait. Anne’s Arctic-fox furs would
have aroused envy at the North Pole.
Webster Booth and Frank Tait accom-
panied their wives. Pretty Mrs. E.
Salenger, of recovering from ill-
ness, was welcomed by many friends. In
the family party were her husband and
daughter, Margaret, the latter slim in a
very full and flowing pink-and-blue-
flowered frock direct from Paris. Half
the audience had seen the show at least
once before, but they applauded with un-
abated enthusiasm. Mrs. H. J. Brady’s
full-length raspberry-red, soft woollen coat
was notable. Clarence Murphy, known
for his clever work in the little theatres,
was one who dripped approbation. Evie
Hayes, as sure-shooting Annie, is as bril-
liant as the medals on her frock. Webb
Tilton is the right lover, and Claude Flem-
ming, whose wife was a proud looker-on,
made a Buffalo Bill slim and elegant
enough to be one of the Three Mus-
keteers.
Ruth French, ballet mistress and major
examiner of the London Royal Academy
of Dancing, is visiting Australia for three
months. While she is here she will ex-
amine for the Diploma of the Royal
Academy, and she has also the awarding
of two scholarships which will enable
ballet students to continue their training
at the Sadler’s Wells school in London.
Miss French is still remembered among
the ballet-conscious in Sydney for her
work with the Pavlova company, when,
as a very youthful member, she danced
the lead of the “classique.” One of Ruth’s
claims to fame is her dancing of the Jack-
daw in the “Jackdaw of Rheims” ballet,
founded on the Ingoldsby Legend. She
gave no fewer than 603 performances of
this role.
The Food for Babies’ Fund is ready
to begin its big drive for funds on
October 1. It is to be a short, sharp attack
on sympathetic pockets. It is a Radio
Party Drive, and wife of Melbourne’s
knight Frank Beaurepaire told a tea-party
in the American Club last week how it
is run. A successful one was part of the
£BOOO drive for the Royal Hospital in
Melbourne. Mrs. lan Jacoby, president
of the Food for Babies’ committee,
was in the chair and told of the fabulous
prizes sent to the committee—washing-
machines, radios, blankets, woollen dress
materials, etc. Social secretary, Rita Fox
(8W2052), will tell you all about it and
gladly enrol you as one of the m&ny
hostesses needed. At the meeting last
week was Mrs. Langton, whose husband
was Dr. W. D. Langton ; she was a mem-
ber of the first committee. John Taylor,
of 2UW, promised personal help. On
October 23 2UW will announce the
prizewinners.
Overseas Leaguers were merry and
bright in their clubrooms on the evening
of the League’s 36th birthday. Admiral
and Mrs. Moore were the guests of
honor, and the Admiral made appropri-
ate speech, and accepted from the hands
of Vice-president C. J. Marsden, on be-
half of the club, a cheque for £5, a
birthday present from a member. The
party was timed from five to seven
o’clock, and the younger members danced
on till eight. Among guests of honor
none was more blithe than Robert Sim,
officer in the merchant navy, who re-
turns to England this trip to marry Sheila
Baker, whom he first met at an Overseas
League dance in London. Judy Lawless,
who opened the first Overseas League
club in Rome, was an interesting visitor.
She flew out from England recently with
her friend Miss Hindle, who is one of
the English cast of Noel Coward’s “Pre-
sent Laughter,” now starting its Aus-
tralian season. Secretary Kath Gaden
wore a turquoise-blue frock and pink
hyacinths.
Among last week’s engagements (view
to matrimony) was that of pretty Rose-
mary Cowper, eldest daughter of the
Norman Cowpers, of Wahroonga, and
granddaughter of poet Hugh McCrae, to
John Guille Penman, also of Wahroonga.
If there is anything in the old super-
stition, the right ear of all those con-
cerned with the education and wellbeing
of the blind, the deaf and dumb citizens
in Maoriland should have burned almost
to a cinder last Thursday. Helen Keller
and her friend, charming Polly Thomp-
son, have recently returned from a visit
across the Tasman, and Helen, the famed
American authoress, is warm in her praise
of Enzed’s work for her handicapped
civilians and ex-servicemen. She and
Miss Thompson were eloquent over
the beautifully-equipped workshop for
sightless men in Christchurch. Nobody
knows better than Miss Keller the com-
fort of capable, competent hands. When
the newspapermen and -women entered
her sitting-room at the Australia they
found her busy typing with a sure and
expert touch.
Helen, probably the most gifted woman
ever to visit this country, has done much
in her Australian and Enzed journeys to
stimulate interest in the welfare of men
and women who, like herself, have lost
sight and hearing. By now she is in
Japan, where she will launch the HSlen
Keller appeal for 5,000,000 yen for that
country’s blind. After visiting Japan Miss
Keller goes on to Formosa, and after that
to China.
Dropped into Australia by Constella-
tion, Rupert Corbett, one of Harley-
street’s cleverest surgeons, and his wife.
From Sydney they flew off to spend a
holiday with Mrs. Corbett’s sister, Mrs.
Steele, in Brisbane. Then they go on as
far north as Charters Towers. Mrs.
Corbett and her sister are the daughters
of the late J. S. Love, once of Queen’s
Hotel, Townsville,

THE SERVICE MAN.
"Subversive
Associations."
“Ek Dum”: The statement of
Mr. Riordan, Minister for the
Navy, arising out of the refusal
of the authorities to allow certain
union secretaries to visit the
Rocket Range, cuts the ground
completely from under the feet
of Mr. Chifley and his Ministry
in regard to the Communist
party.
Mr. Chifley, when asked to
ban the party, has invariably re-
plied that Communism is a
“political philosophy,” and has
a right to express itself.
It can be taken for granted
that the ban was imposed not on
the initiative of the Australian
Government but on that of the
British authorities responsible for
security. Mr. Riordan said:
The Government is firm in its
determination on the action it will
take against persons having affilia-
tions with associations advocating
Communistic ideas and theories
and subversive generally to
society.
He said seven union officials had
been accepted for the tour, but
the other five had been rejected
on the ground of association
with elements believed to be sub-
versive to the community. Actu-
ally four visited the range.
One of those refused permis-
sion was Mr. Purse, general sec-
retary of the Building Workers
Industrial Union, which is
Communist-led to the teeth and
which was deregistered almost
the next day by a unanimous de-
cision of the Federal Arbitration
Bench, Mr. Purse shouting de-
fiance at the law and authority.
Mr. Purse was one of the
Communists who cabled U.N.O.
a few days previously asking
that action be taken against the
United States because a Grand
Jury had criminally indicted the
leaders of the Communist party
of America. The rest who were
refused permission were associ-
ated with unions with Commun-
ist leadership.
Mr. Chifley is, therefore, pre-
sented with the following con-
dition of affairs to deal with:
(1) It is necessary to employ
workers from certain unions on
the range. Some of those unions
are Communist-led, and Mr.
Riordan, one of the Defence
Ministers, says their leaders have
“association with elements be-
lieved to be subversive to the
community.”
(2) These “leaders” are in a
strategic position to get Rocket
Range information.
(3) Some of these unions
partly finance the Labor
party, of which Mr. Chifley is
Parliamentary leader.
(4) Some of the members of
the A.L.P. executive, which en-
dorses Mr. • Chifley for Parlia-
ment, were officials of the Com-
munist party in former days.
It seems that Mr. Chifley will
have some trouble in explaining
his way out of this situation.
But the odds are that he will not
explain.. He prefers the totali-
tarian method of silence.
As a beginning, if he should
happen to be in an explaining
mood, he might explain what
the Government proposes to do
about Communist-party tele-
phones. In Sydney the party en-
joys the use of separate numbers
for the following: Central Com-
mittee (several lines); Marx
House school; Arts and Sciences
committee —so called in the
“Tribune,” but described in the
G.P.O. directory as “Publicity
Department” ; Treasurer ; “Tri-
bune” Editorial (several lines);
Waterfront Branch ; Lidcombe
Zone; North Shore Zone;
“Newsletter” —which has four
separate numbers. And there
are, of course, some others which
appear under various names.
It seems rather a lot for a
body which is adjudged by the
Government to have subversive
associations.
Preparations in Europe
“Ek Dum”: The sporadic
bursts of optimism which affect
the press about the Moscow con-
ferences have little basis in fact.
It is obvious that General-
issimo Stalin is only sparring for
an advantage, while at the same
time forcing the pace in Berlin.
During the week Communist
mobs, obviously acting under
Russian orders, have been en-
gaged in making the continu-
ance of the Berlin municipal
administration (Magistral) im-
possible by rioting and disorder
and violence. This is typical
Communist practice. It is some-
thing entirely new to civilised
intercourse between great
Powers a method worthy of
the Kuku-kukus or Dyaks, but
not of a modern civilised nation.
Meanwhile, Moscow and
other Russian radios continue to
abuse the Western allies in the
argot of their kind, and pre-
parations go ahead for the de-
fence of Western Europe.
This week Field-Marshal
Montgomery visited the Western
Zone, and the British Govern-
ment announced the opening of
a great and entirely new base
“Match, Skipper?”
jn Lancashire to handle the
need s of the United States Air
force in Britain. There are now
f our i arge stations devoted to
jj.S. needs in the United King-
wd h about 18,000 men.
j t j s c i ear that British and
u.S. defence is being integrated
to emergencies. U.S. naval,
and particularly submarine, train-
j ng j s being expanded, and the
U.S. defence budget has been
increased by about 1,000,000,000
dollars.
Exercise in Britain
Beginning on September 3, all
home-based operational com-
mands of the R.A.F. will be in-
volved with the U.S. Forces in
a four-day air exercise the
largest since the war.
The exercise will presume
attempted invasion of a country
known as Southland, a Con-
tinental Power, with a western
coastline-border extending from
Basle in Switzerland to the
Dutch isle of Juist and from
there to a point half-way up

The Berlin Atmosphere
Leave for British troops in
the Berlin area has been stopped
entirely since July 1. What is
being done there and what the
atmosphere is has been de-
scribed within the past few days
in the “Times” by a visitor:
The dangers of the situation press,,
and are well known to everyone, but
so serious are they that in British
circles chatter and nimor-mongenng
are stilled. Of the senior officers,
military and civilian, whose leadership
inspires the whole, it is hard to speak
adequately. As was said to me more
than once: “They are superb, and we
would not be anywhere else for all
the world.” Whatever the future
may hold in store, a spiritual victory,
complete in itself, is bemg achieved
in Berlin today. Its effect on future
Anglo-German relations is incalcul-
able, and as the cynical, disillusioned,
frightened Berliner watches the great
food-carrying aircraft arrive almost
one a minute on Gatow airfield, and
watches the army of men and women
mechanics and canteen workers ser-
vice the machines and feed the air-
and ground-staffs, night and day, dur-
ing last week’s blistering heat and
today’s storms, he knows that that,
at least, is not “paper propaganda.
Science and Freedom.
An incident reported from the
U.S.S.R. should make those
young scientists who believe
that defence secrets must be
at the service of the whole
world pause to think. It is not
an isolated incident —Professor
Ashby and other visitors to the
Workers’ Only Fatherland have
reported long ago that such
matters are part of regular
policy.
The incident relates to the sad
case of Comrade L. A. Orbeli,
who has been sacked from his
post as academic secretary of the
biological section of the Soviet
Union Academy of Sciences,
It appears that he had failed to
“place biology at the service of
the vital needs of socialist con-
struction.”
Tovarish Orbeli is one of a
large group to be purged from
U.S.S.R. science. It appears that
they fail to co-ordinate their
scientific work with the interests
of the country for the develop-
ment of Communism. In other
words, they take the same stand
as ,P r - Makm sc m and the Aus-
trahan Communists who follow
him—that their science belongs
to the won • ,
tew Australian mtei-
jectuals the Communist pr
as des cnhed Mr. Clive Evatt

som ® of the well-authenticated
word-pictures of what happens
m Russia to scientists who do
not place every ounce they have
exclusively a * the service of the
Soviet Union—exclusively:
Huddled together on narrow wooden
benches> wit g thin> sha rpened-down
dinner-knives in hand, sit professors
and other educated and cultured men.
In front of them are bags with dirty,
rotten potatoes which in capitalist
country would not be used even to
feed pigs ; and here these men sit
diligently, seriously and clumsily peel-

That was written hv Vladimir
Tchernavin, a RussZ ichthyo-
iogist well-known throughout
t b e world in his sphere at one
t jme leader of expeditions to
Central Asia and the Far East,
in 1925 Director of Produc-
tion and Research of the
Northern State Fishing Trust,
who was arrested as a “wrecker”
and used to organise forced
labor in the fishing industry until
he succeeded in escaping.
As “Soviet Justice,” an official
Russian journal dealing with the
criminal law, put it: “A Com-
mission of the Commissariat of
Justice, after touring the prisons,
reported that class-alien elements
are being kept under strict ob-
servation, and are sent ex-
clusively to hard-labor tasks.”
In Russia a man who was
inclined to give away so much as
the formula for a new cotton-
reel to non-Communist countries
would be regarded as a “class-
alien.”
In the 1938 Moscow trials,
according to the official report,
one of the statements adduced
against a prisoner to support a
capital charge was that he told
a British woman Red Cross
worker, who had risked her life
tQ take a unit to Kiev to relieve
the sufferers in the famine of
1932-33, what the wheat produc-
ti6n of the Ukraine actually
amounted to.
This charge was put forward
by no less a person than Mr.
Vishinsky, now Russian Foreign
Minister, as “spying for a foreign
Power” and “wrecking.”
Speed and Defence.
While much has been written
about the high speeds of jet-
fighters, internal-combustion en-
gines have grown so much both
in actual power and in power-f
to-weight ratio that the Spitfire
or ME 109 pilot of 1940 would
feel himself today in the snail
class.
In Australia more than any-
where the contrast with 1938-39
is striking. It was only in 1936
that the Commonwealth Aircraft
Corporation, closely linked with
8.H.P., was founded mainly on
the initiative of Essington Lewis.
In October, 1938, amid great
cheers from the Government, the
first Wirraway was launched,
and somebody in Canberra an-
nounced that the Air Force was
being modernised. Somewhere
about the same time a couple
of Ansons were in the air—the
only two-engined aircraft in the
service of the R.A.A.F. In
January, 1942, this country had
nothing better than Wirraways
to send to defend the two most
vital points in our outpost de-
fence —Rabaul and Singapore—
and even if the machines had
been here there were no pilots
capable of flying anything
faster —indeed, the men of Singa-
pore and Rabaul, brave as they
were, were in the main utterly
inexperienced in battle flying.
The C.A.C. has gone, a long
way since its early Wirraway
days. It built the Wackett
trainer, the Boomerang —
described as “an interceptor
fighter”—the Mustang fighter,
from U.S. blueprints, and finally
has turned out the C.A.15, which
recorded 502.2 m.p.h, in level
flight after a power-dive from
9000 ft. to 5000 ft. a few weeks
ago. It is rated for normal level
going at 450 m.p.h., but as it is
powered with a 3000-h.p. Rolls-
Royce Griffin, also locally made
from British plans and specifi-
cations, this does not look like
its maximum rate.
In design it is a new edition
of the U.S. Mustang, with at
least 30 m.p.h. better speed
than the old model.
Lest, however, its existence
makes anybody feel unduly safe,
it should be recorded that there
are so few of the machines that
if somebody left a couple or so
of hangar-keys at home there
would be no C.A.l5s available.
For that matter, there would
not be any type of aircraft fit to
perform fighter duties when a
new war against a modern
enemy had been in progress
three months.
The only kind of defence in
which the present run of Aus-
tralian Governments is in-
terested is that kind which is in-
dulged in in such hallowed spots
as Sydney Stadium, where im-
ported colored pugs maul each
other for inflated fees. Sydney’s
rendezvous for cauliflower ears
is just now in process of being
saved from destruction at huge
cost to the taxpayers, plus the
grabbing and disfiguring of
parklands, while the Citizen
Force is being killed by Gov-
ernment Departments the
N.S.W. Railway Department,
which is saving the Stadium, in.
particular which refuse to
allow their men off for annual
training.
Nobody is making any move
to save the dying Citizen Forces,
which seem to have been aban-
doned entirely by their nurse,
Mr. Chambers.
Eastern Europe must be a sad
place to live in. On August 27
the Zagreb Supreme Court sen-
tenced 43 members of the Croat
Ustachi to death anybody
opposed to Tito becomes a
Croat Ustachi or a “terrorist.”
And the much-boomed marshal
is now beset with a new foe in
the former deputy-commander
of his air force —General Popi-
voda, who through “Prayda” in
Moscow has issued a clarion-call
to all Yugoslavs to “free the
country from the treacherous
and anti-Soviet Tito.” The same
day 11 Czechs, including the
prior of a monastery, were
arrested. The villains had been
helping citizens of the world’s
latest land of the free to escape
from their national soil to the
territory under the control of
those brutal terrorists the
Americans. And Albania has
“purged” 3000 of Tito’s sym-
pathisers,

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”: —
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance."
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and’ as business of an international

Ancestors of
an
Industry
Smithson Tennant discovered that diamonds
and carbon are chemically the same. He proved it
by weighing a diamond, heating it with potassium
♦ nitrate, and then weighing the carbon dioxide
produced. Tennant made other important dis-
coveries. In 1803 he noticed that when crude
platinum was dissolved in aqua regia (a mixture
of nitric and hydrochloric acids) a black powder
was left. Leading chemists of the time believed
this to be graphite or “blacklead.” Tennant did
not, and his investigations resulted in the discovery
of two new metals, iridium and osmium. Iridium
—so called because of the varied colours of its
compounds—is used for tipping the gold nibs of
fountain pens. It, is so hard that it lasts almost
indefinitely and, like gold, is not corroded by ink.
Osmium is the heaviest substance known.
The son of a Yorkshire clergyman, Tennant was
born in Wensleydale in 1761. His interest in
chemistry began early, and at the tender age of
nine he was found making gunpowder for fire-
works. He studied chemistry at the University of
Edinburgh and at Christ’s College, Cambridge.
Later he travelled extensively in Europe and met
many of the leading scientists of other countries.
In 1813 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry
at the University of Cambridge, but was killed
two years later in a riding accident
while on holiday at Boulogne. The
nib of the modern fountain pen is one
reminder of the work of this dis-
tinguished English chemist.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
A crowd of 50,000, herded together
by rain into the limited shelters avail-
able, made conditions at Randwick
on- Saturday rather trying, but the
racing was splendidly full of interest.
Responsible mainly for the large
attendance was a more-than-usually
interesting Hobartville Stakes. Last
year the Hobartville was merely a
gift-race for the brilliant Temeraire,
opposed only by two maiden per-
formers. Saturday’s race, however,
brought together Sire’s Produce-
winner Riptide, Wattle (Champagne
Stakes), Midwise (Gimcrack Stakes),
Victoria’s crack colt Ungar, the un-
beaten San Domenico and several
other good winners. Following a re-
markable track-gallop earlier in the
week, San Domenico started favorite
at 9-to-4 on.
San Domenico won all right; and it
is a credit to any horse to beat such
a field. Yet the race was a severe
setback to those who had been hail-
ing him as another Phar Lap. At
no stage did San Domenico give an
impression of dominating the Reid,
as he had done in- his earlier wins
against moderate company, and he
won by only the barest whisker from
Royal Andrew, who finished fully
twice as fast as anything else in the
field. In another stride Royal Andrew
would have won, and, moreover, his
jockey, Mulley, was riding almost
blind after stopping a clod of dirt.
Riptide just beat Ungar for third
money, with Wattle next. Riptide
was obviously short of a run, return-
ing to scale in a lather of sweat and
blowing hard. Ungar was impressive,
and will be better acclimatised when
he has his next run. Wattle ran an
excellent race, sharing the lead with
the winner until her stamina gave out
a furlong or so from home. Royal
Andrew ran a rattling good Derby
trial.
Nothing really outstanding to look
at, San Domenico is a brown gelding
by Hua, the most successful of
Australian-bred sires over the last
couple of seasons. The gelding is
owned by R. P. Formosa and trained
by N. R. O’Brien. He is to be sent
for a brief spell now, so racegoers
will have a few weeks to chew over
the question, “Was he fully ex-
tended?” Most who had a good view
of the finish are of the opinion that
he was.
In the seven-furlongs Warwick
Farm Spring Stakes, Epsom favorite
Heroic Sovereign suffered the appal-
ling indignity of being beaten easily
at weight for age by a maiden per-
former in Septet (R. Selkng). Septet
led clearly all the way and went
further ahead at the finish to win by
four lengths. Although he was a
solidly-backed second favorite, the
distance was too short for Proctor,
who nevertheless finished on very
strongly into third place. As a
maiden three-year-old Septet received
a 101 b. allowance and earned 7.1.
In softish going he covered the trip
in 1.27, as did San Domenico. Septet
certainly should have speed; he’s by
Genetout’out of the brilliant Hesione.
He had had only two previous runs
for minor placings in Juvenile events.
Another rather surprising winner
was the Mildura gelding Cardinal
Colour (J. Waterhouse), who had
seemed somewhat out of his class in
the 12-fur.longs Spring Handicap
against Kerry Lad, Sovereign, Herbert
River, Silver Link and others.
Cardinal Colour went to the front
a mile from home and battled on
gamely at the finish to down Sovereign
and Herbert River. He’s in the
Metrop. with 6.10.
Often a useful pointer to Epsom
prospects, the Campbclltown Handi-
cap (6f.) was won by Shannon s
three-year-old brother Bembrook,
beating Shading and The Groom.
However, Bembrook will probably
contest the Derby. The really im-
pressive Epsom Trial of the day was
that of Crusader, who finished brilli-
antly to win the mile Glenlee Handi-
cap under a plaster of 10.7. Should
the going be soft, or worse. Crusader
will take a power of beating m the
Epsom with 8.9. On such a track he
fvas beaten only a head by Blue
Legend in the Doncaster.
Other Randwick winners were
Snowstream (J. Thompson) taking the
first Three-year-old Handicap, while
Freedom (R. Selkrig) won the second
and the very consistent Binnaway (N.
Sellwood) scored in the Trial Stakes
of 10 furlongs.
* * * *
Racing at Moonee Valley got off
to a bad start for the new season
on Saturday when the first race was
marred by a nasty smash on a sec-
tion of the track (between the three-
and four-furlongs marks) where, for
no obvious reason, several accidents
had previously occurred. Star of
the East fell first, bringing down also
Royal Myth, Barlowerie, Francette
and the favorite Trellis. Barlowerie
was killed and jockey E. Preston suf-
fered a broken leg.
The race was the first Morang
Handicap for three-year-old fillies,
and, with the fancied pair Trellis and
Star of the East out of action. Lady
Luba (W. A. Smith) at 12 to 1, Jenny
Tressady (14 to 1) and Mount Beauty
(100 to 1) filled the places. The
second division of the Morang went
to topweight and favorite Siren Song
(E. Clarke), with Marinka and Sun
Song placed.
The Ailsa Handicap of a mile for
three-year-old colts and geldings also
required divisions. The first saw the
Law Maker colt Clement earn him-
self a trip north for the A.J.C. Derby
by downing Carbon Copy, who was
already booked for the trip. Carbon
Copy contributed to his own defeat
by running right off at the turn, but
Clement would probably have won
in any case.
Clement was ridden by J. Purtell,
who also landed the second division
on Mile End and made it a hat-
trick of winners when he won the
mile Tullamarine Handicap on favor-
ite Attley. After an untoward dis-
play of friskiness at the barrier Attley
took a few furlongs to settle down,
but quickly had the race won as he
moved up to lead into the straight;
Decorate finished second ahead of
Millais. Attley carried 9.9 and
clocked the smart time for Moonee
Valley of 1.385; he has now won 19$
races and more than £22,000 in stakes.
* Miss Prim (B. Foristal), who has
the happy knack of getting into races
with light weights, and winning at
long odds, started at 14 to 1 for the
13-furlongs Ngarveno Handicap and
won running away from favorite Sun-
haven and Tudor Prince. Complet-
ing the programme at Moonee Valley,
Paroxena led all the way to win the
Broadmeadow Steeple, while Prince
Curl (J. Cowie) took the Macedon
Highweight.

The cricketers:
The Australians had two more vic-
tories last week and look certain now
to go through undefeated. At Can-
terbury the hop-pickers of Kent beheld
their stalwarts maltstered by an inn-
ings and 186 runs Australia 361
(Brown 106); Kent 51 (the lowest
score against the tourists) and 124.
Then the Australians barged in on
the Gentlemen of England at Lord’s
.and rudely scruffed them by an inn-
ings and 81 runs —Australia 610 for
five wickets (closed); Gents 245 and
284. Edrich was the only gent, to
make a respectable score with 128;
for the intruders Hassett got 200 n.o.
(his highest score), Bradman 150 (a
fitting farewell to the famous pad-
dock) and Brown 120.
On Saturday the tourists had
another batting feast v. Somerset at
Taunton, where, at the close of the
day, 560 runs were on the board for
the loss of five wickets. Neil Harvey
made 126, lan Johnson 113 n. 0.,
Hassett 103; the unlucky Hamence
was stumped at 99. The very reliable
performer Sundries joined in with a
contribution of 34.
Skippered by 50-year-old J. C.
Clay, who was a sprite in the first
team in 1927, Glamorgan landed this
year’s county championship, to spring
the biggest reversal seen in English
cricket since neck-to-knee beards were
standard attire. Final points scored
by the leaders were Glamorgan 172,
Derbyshire and Middlesex each 148,
Surrey 144, and Lancashire and York-
shire each 140. The fact that an XI
brandishing a leek as its emblem is
no longer to be regarded as a joint
in the county-championship tail must
“ He'll give ME no more crook tips!”
surely gladden the soul-case of Billy
Hughes, Ben Price and other exiles
in Australia who claim the unspellable
lingo as their heritage.
* * * *
With one more round to go the
V.F.L. “four” is a certainty for
Essendon, CoUingwood and Mel-
bourne, with Richmond or Footscray
to provide the other. Essendon went
to Geelong on Saturday and nearly
struck the snag that has wrecked other
teams—Geelong at home. Only a
goal by Rawle at the death-knock
pulled Essendon into a 10.12-9.10 win,
Melbourne shattered Carlton’s hopes
in a flying last quarter which over-
took a deficit of eight points and
put Carlton out, 15.11-13.14, and
Fitzroy, a study for psychologists in
defeat, suffered its seventh loss at
North Melbourne, 8.12-6.10. Rich-
mond had no trouble to beat Haw-
thorn, 17.11-9.6, Collingwood had a
run against St. Kilda for 15.19 to
11.4, and the rejuvenated Footscray,
getting a smell of the “four,” gal-
loped joyously over “Sowth” to col-
lect 14.16 to 7.7. Footscray has to
beat North Melbourne to stay in.
* * * *
In the Rugby Union semi-finals
Manly beat Eastern Suburbs 20-19
and Randwick beat Gordon 22-9.
Randwick had a clear-cut victory,
Col Windon, in the forwards, playing
a sparkling game, and Marsden, a
promotion from reserve grade who
has shown great promise in the last
two seasons, scoring three tries on
the wing. Gordon’s main attack and
defence, Wallaby skipper Trevor
Allan, was borne down by weight of
numbers. The Manly-East game was
close, with a protest by Easts adding
to the excitement.
* * * *
Leichhardt Stadium last week again
rang with the vociferous hooting of
the mob, a sound to which, by now,
it must be pretty well attuned. Throw-
ing a persistent barrage of rights
to the head, Frank Duff (11.4) appar-
ently defeated Fred Braddock beyond
question; the contest was declared
a draw. Duff displayed what little
scientific boxing was seen, and it
looked the finish of Braddock when
a right floored him just as the bell
rang out round four. Braddock
came up fairly fresh for the fifth and
fought back gamely, but didn’t by a
mile make up the leeway.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: Sleepy Williams had the
somewhat enviable capacity to fall asleep
at any time anywhere and stay asleep
through riots, natural disasters and dog-
fights. He fell off more horses than any
man living because the motion of riding
induced slumber, and he frequently dis-
graced himself by collapsing into a coma
in the arms, of some girl with whom he
was dancing. His idea of a fine time in
town was to make straight for the pie-
shop, absorb six meat-pies and a pint of
tomato-sauce, wash it down with hot tea,
then grope his way into a pub parlor or
some other handy place and there sleep
until it was time to go home again. He
once travelled from Swan Hill to Flem-
ington (Vic.) in the brake van of a goods
train and slept all the way, though that
train took a day and half a night on the
journey and that van was kicked, buffeted,
shunted, sideswiped and short-coupled
every 20 miles or so. He was camped
with Broomstick Wallace on the Old Man
Plain when 2in. of rain fell and put all
that flat and level waste under a foot of
water. Broomstick stood upright in water
to his hocks, holding erect the sleeping
Williams to keep him from drowning in
his sleep. He was in the pub at Old
Junee one day and fell asleep behind a
couple of barrels in the bar. The pub
caught fire. The crowd rushed about
throwing out tables and empty crates and
yelling at each other; then somebody
thought of Sleepy and two men fought
through smoke and flame to find him.
He was still in the bar. Asleep? No,
steadily working the beer-pump, drinking
what he could and hilariously throwing
the rest at the fire, “Gripes,” he mur-
mured drowsily, as they dragged him
out, “I wasn’t worryin’. Thought it was
only andther dream! ”

“X.E.D.”: Sam had a couple of good
sheepdogs on the droving trip, but the
third hound was a fool and useless. The
sheepdogs ignored it completely, and
about the only thing I ever saw him chase
was a plover on the swampy flats. Sooner
would only stare after rabbits with a
puzzled look in his eyes. But he was
always frisking and wagging his tail at
Sam whenever he got a chance. “What’s
the idea in keeping a tyke like that?” I
asked. “Well, it ain’t easy to explain,”
Sam said, wearing a foolish grin. “You
take them sheepdogs—best in the State
—an’ hardly a thought in their heads but
workin’ sheep. There’s no company f’r
me from their sort. Yair, an’ I’ve had
good dogs f’r sheep an’ cattle all me life
that y’d spoil with a pat an’ a bit o’
fussin’. But Sooner’s jist a dog of no
ambitions or trainin’ an’ I’ve got him f’r
meself.”

“Chuck”: Mick’s tourer was no
chicken, but her owner had learned her
every discrepancy, and considered she’d
do to take himself and Charlie to the foot-
ball semi-final, some 40 miles off. They
were three-parts up the long hill near old
Harriman’s outer paddock when the
engine coughed, spluttered, stammered
a while, and petered out. Charlie and
Mick climbed out. “Yair, I know what
it’ll be,” Mick announced cheerfully.
“Chuck us that tool-bag, Chari.” He was
wrestling with bits and pieces when old
Harriman rode by. “Anything I can do,
boys?” he called. “No, thanks,” he was
told. “We’ll fix her. Coin’ to take us
a while, that’s all.” Harriman rode on.
The match was so good that the following
week Charlie and Mick decided they’d
take in the final. They were pulling
slowly up the long hill once more when
the old bus repeated her performance,
on almost the same spot. Again Mick
hauled out the tools. Presently over the
rise came Harriman, again on his weekly
inspection. He eyed the tourer and dis-
appeared. Twenty minutes later he
cantered hurriedly back, with a large
bundle of tucker. “Here y’ are,” he
invited solicitously. “Gripes, you boys
must be starved. I never dreamt y’ meant
it’d take y’ this long.”
“Alpine Willie”: The days of the axe-
men are passing. Where the ring of the
axe was paramount with the felling-gang
there is now the roaring motor of the
power-saw. Ingenious devices these, the
mobile circular which falls the tree and
buzzes it off into lengths, the dragsaw,
also adaptable to falling, and the chain-
saw. The latter departs from the usual
principle by having a cutting-chain revolv-
ing swiftly round the “blade” and tear-
ing a wide cut through the tree. They’re
becoming increasingly popular with
woodgetters as well as timbermen, and,
lacking the solid training that makes
them, it wouldn’t surprise me if champion
axemen are hard to find in the next
generation. No woodchops at the city
shows? Well, you woodheap exponents
needn’t lose heart —there may be a call
to display those bulging muscles there
yet.

“Mat’s Mate”: A hot Sunday morning
in Cootamundra. Nothing stirred. We
dozed in chairs on the balcony of the
Albion. In the middle of the road
opposite the post-office a dog lay in the
sun. The heavy-footed minutes dragged
silently by. At the far end of the street
a mounted man appeared, his horse
ambling easily through the heat. As he
approached the dog raised its head, de-
bated whether or not to attack the horse’s
“Offer him a nut ”
, . ,
heels, thought better of it and relaxed,
The horseman’s eyes studied the pub as
jw drew nearer and lifting to the
balcony, spotted us. He stopped the
sP at thoughtfully and said, S ot.
Yair, we drawled. He looked lazily up
and down the street Anybody about?

body in the kitchen. He drooped m the

“Dronestung”: The profuse blossom
and f eas { 0 f ne ctar in times of honeyflow
aren q confined to sou’-Westralian karri
forests (B> 4 /8/’4B). Such is the habit
0 £ t^e est euca.lypts that they yield so
he avd y in a few weeks that only a small
proportion of the crop can be gathered,
Yellow-box, ironbark and several more
j n eastern States have their short
seaso ns of plenty, when overstocking with
dees would be pretty near impossible,
£ or jj WO uld be a hopeless task trying to
ra j se sufficient numbers in the off-seasons
to cope with the harvest. Australian
eucalypts are probably unsurpassed in the
wor i d f or the quantity and quality of
ne ctar they brew, though the long and
irregular breaks between seasons make
keeping the bees occupied on numerous
varieties a job for the migratory bee-
keeper.
* * * *
“Betcha”: Strange that two of- our
most intelligent animals do not take
advantage of fire for warmth. A horse
will shelter behind buildings, trees, or
anything else he can find, but backs off
from the campfire as something evil,
Dogs, too, excepting the old camper who
has long grown accustomed to it, will
ignore the fire and curl up somewhere
close by. One can understand sheep
failing to take advantage of an easy
warming, for only in dire extremity do
they seek any form of cover. Cattle,
however, need no teaching. Like puss,
when the night is cold they make for a
fire if one is available, and gather around
enjoying the warmth. With a clearing
job in progress, and trees ready to fall,
the cattle clustered beneath are a con-
stant source of worry. At the first
ominous crack they dash off hurriedly
enough, but it is not unusual for one to
cop the limb of a silent-falling giant.

“Argumentative Mac”: Tell “The
Pirate” (B. 16/6/’4B) that the ketch he
mentions is building for the Flinders
Island-Launceston run was launched a
few days ago at Port Cygnet (Tas.). Built
by Wilson Bros. —builders of many of
the smartest sailers in the strait trade —
the vessel is 81ft. long and designed to
carry 40-head of cattle below and 150
sheep on deck. Appropriately it has been
christened Shearwater, the new scientific
name for the übiquitous Bass Strait
mutton-bird.

“8.A.K.”: How do you get to this
Eldorado called Jackson’s Creek? And
Eldorado it is, if the schoolteacher’s six-
roomed house was erected there in two
months (B. 4/8/’4B). For more than 12
months I’ve fought with merchants,
begged ’em, threatened ’em, grovelled to
’em—everything except pay ’em black-
market prices—in an endeavor to keep
up a supply of materials that would en-
able me to build a three-roomed home.
Now, if the fibrous-plaster supplier keeps
his work, the place may be ready to
occupy a little before Christmas. But it
won’t have a “modern bathroom” as the
schoolie’s did. You can’t have a modern
bathroom without a bath! Our bath was
ordered in July, 1947 ; delivery, it was
promised, would be made in July, 1949.
The fellow on the next block was lucky ;
he managed to get on the track of a bath
that was for sale in Canberra, bought
it and cheerfully paid for the car-
riage over 150-odd miles. A chap
further up the road was lucky, too. By
some means that he doesn’t talk about,
he got a bath from a firm less than 20
miles away. Of course it will cost him
a bit to send it to his daughter and her
husband —they live somewhere “just out
of Canberra.”
* * * *
“The Pirate”: Owing principally to the
advent of air transport, which enables
the working of out-of-the-way coasts and
bays, Tasmania’s fish production at
15,000,0001 b. for the year ending June 30
is 22 per cent, more than the previous
12 months and 50 per cent, ahead of pre-
war.
* * ♦ *
“Salmon Gums”: I’ve just covered a
flowering cauliflower plant with mosquito-
netting to prevent cross-pollination with
other flowers of the same species. The
precaution is necessary because the cauli-
flower belongs to the Brassica family,
which includes cabbage and swede-turnip,
and a cross with either of those plants
would produce quite unmarketable mon-
strosities. A cross between a cauliflower
and a swede once gave me an orange-
colored cauli, with a barely perceptible
flavor. Other crosses produce far worse
results, and it is conceivable that, if
allowed to flower promiscuously, most
garden vegetable plants would eventually
lose all semblance to their original type.
Near by the fields are aglow with wild-
flowers. They are the same flowers as
the original inhabitants of this country
knew, and presumably they have main-
tained their color and shape for aeons.
There is no cross-pollination there,
although many of them must stem from
some common stock. Our vegetables, I
know, are the results of man-conducted
experiments, and perhaps they may never
receive Nature’s unconditional sanction.
Yet they have been produced by Nature's
laws, the same laws that gave us the
wildflowers with which Nature is -evi-
dently satisfied. It is a chastening
thought that man, with all his knowledge,
cannot bestow on any of his creations
the perpetuity that Nature grants to the
humblest of her children.

“H.H.”: An ambitious aerial dingo-
poisoning campaigri is listed to com-
mence in the Carnarvon and Port
Hedland districts (north W.A.) on
October 18. A plane, under charter
to the Vermin - destruction Branch,
will cover 5000 miles along river-
beds and waterholes of the arid nor’-
west, dropping baits in hopes of catching
the warrigals on the water before the
wet season starts. Although there are no
nomadic blacks left in the Fortescue and
De Grey <ureas, it’s to be hoped the
descendants of King Buckeye on the
stations are informed.'
* * * ♦
“G’pa”: What was probably the first
attempt to incorporate a native bird’s
song in music goes back to the “Aus-
tralian Annual,” a magazine published by
W. H. Williams, edited by Henry Kendall
and published in Melbourne in 1870. It
contains “The Native Wren” ; words were
by Kendall, music by A. Summers (Mus.
Bac., Oxon.). The publisher states that
when visiting the Dandenongs he was
struck by the sweet song of the native
wren, took down the notes of the melody
and the published song was the result.

“Nor’-west”; Would be inclined to
agree with “Kelms” (B. 4/8/’4B) regard-
ing the poorness of turtle, soup, though
only with the qualification—as we make
it. Kito was a Jap in the days when
Japs were less unpopular, and given a
couple of flippers he could turn out a
broth that would have soothed the palate
of an alderman. Using a gallon billy, he
didn’t rush the turtle meat to a boil,
as does the mug cook with all meat; in-
stead, with a small fire, he just kept the
big billy simmering for a couple of hours,
then popped it into a “hot-box” ; which
was simply a sizeable box packed bottom
and sides with 6in. of dry grass. A
further 6in. covered the lid ; and there
the soup remained till next day. By then
the meat had dissolved to a jelly. The
essential onions having been added
earlier, he now might toss in a handful
or so of sago, perhaps vermicelli, and
serve hot. The main point was the slow
cooking, which brought the gelatine and
all the flavors out of the meat. It was
as rich as a good ox-tail soup, and no-
thing in the soup line can beat that.

“E.H.M.”: “Tilga’s” theorist (B.
11/8/ ’4B) knew as much about tools as
a fellow who came up to the Tweed to
grow bananas' on a soldier-settlement.
He knew all about growing bananas from
books, and when he heard old cockies
talk about “Gross Mickle” variety of
banana he would in the best French
accent remind them that the pronuncia-
tion was “Gros Michele.” Preparatory
to starting work he whittled away the
thick end of the mattock-handle because,
as he remarked, “The confounded handle
is too thick to go into the mattock!”

“Goldie”: Harry came into the hut
shaking snow from his hat and overcoat.
“Too miserable f’r work t’day,” he an-
nounced. The newchum brightened and
reached for the skis he’d laboriously
hacked from a length of messmate.
“Think I’ll give ’em a trial run,” he said.
With Charlie and Harry as audience he
buckled them on, and slithered round and
over a few times on the bit of a rise at the
camp. Charlie waxed enthusiastic. “I’ve
seen blokes jump on them things at the
pitchers,” he said. “Now if y’ was t’ take
orf halfway up that steep spur it’d be
easy as winkin’ t’ make a turn t’ miss that
granite outcrop an’ jump on t’ the flat
stretch near .the crick. If y’re gonner take
on skeein’ y’ might as well learn all y’
can.” He favored Harry with a specu-
lative grin as the newchum trudged up
the spur. The newchum turned, started
to wave and was off in a flurry of snow.
Down he almost flew, crouching and
somehow maintaining a balance, straight
for the outcropping granite boulders.
The turn he took is not elaborated in
skiing technology—it may be described
only as one for the better. Tjhe skis
snagged a rotted log in the snow, and the
newchum was flung into the branches of
a sapling at a sharp angle from his course.
“Not a bad jump f’r a beginner,” Charlie
said when they got him down. “Now' let’s
see what y’ c’n do after that bit o’
practice.” But the tyro limped painfully
and sheepishly away from his skis.
AN AMBOINA ANNIVERSARY.
This is the day that Norman died —
The hour the threads of hope were cut.
The gates of hell behind them shut,
And all eternity’s opened wide
For him and many more beside.
They have razed to earth compound and hut
And all again is Eden, but
For thickset crosses side by side.
And all those soldiers’ names beseech:
Take heed, take heed, Jest worse be wrought.
And if the lesson we would teach.
Our voiceless pleadings, go for nought.
Then let our graves, far out of reach.
Be, with our memory, out of thought.
VICTORIA.
K. DALZIEL.


“Billy T.”: Long John is not the man
he was. He is still erect, except when
passing under doors or branches less than
6ft. 6in. high, and his appetite, endur-
ance and laughter are still as robust as
ever; nor has the recent loss of three
fingers down the maws of a chaffcutter
cured him of feeding that gluttonous
machine, or impaired his skill in handling
a fractious colt. But whereas he once
did all those things in shirtsleeves, any
weather, this season he has gone out to
work rugged up. “It was those flamin’
transfusions,” he explains, “While a
bloke had his own blood he took no
notice of the cold, but now —’struth, any
bit of a breeze sets me shivering. Once
I felt the weather less than anyone ; now
everyone feels it less than me. I wonder”
—this more confidentially, and with a
worried frown —“I wonder if they could
have slipped a bit o’ blackfellers’ blood
into me?”

“Colonial Cove”: The point about
that wonderful honey-flow of the Wes-
tralian bush (B. 4/8/’4B) is that before
white men’s' days only the minutest frac-
tion of it would have been gathered—
there never were enough native bees in
the West to cope with it. A “sugarbag”
to the natives must have been a rarity,
for one may read through the scores of
letters preserved from those early times,
also the journals of such as G. F. Moore
and the R.ev. Wollaston, without finding
any mention of wild honey, though it
was noted that the natives liked to suck
the tall hondy-full flowers) of the “black-
boy,” and to make a decoction by steep-
ing the flowers of the banksia in water.
Thus the puzzle is—it being assumed that
Nature never creates or develops any-
thing without purpose—why was the pro-
lific honey-flow given to the trees of the
West when there were so few insects to
profit by it?
* * * *
“Herbert Dawson”: Native beehives?
Cannot answer for Westralia, but in
south-west Queensland I could show
“Kelms” (B. 4/8/’4B) plenty of them. The
industrious little black toilers are gener-
ally found in a dead tree or log. Often
they are easier discovered by the brown-
ish stain round a knothole or crack —
sign of the passage of myriads of pollen-
laden legs and feet—than by following
the trail of the tiny insects in flight.
However, like the larger bees, they appear
to be scarce in ringbarked country, which
is understandable. Pentoxide poisoning
of trees is blamed for the disappearance
of bees in many districts, as it is con-
tended that they get the poison from the
blossoms. Poisoning of wheat for birds
and aerial bait-dropping for dingoes are
other methods of “increasing produc-
tion” which may eventually prove to have
results the opposite of those desired.
Nature stands a lot of interference, but
when she does jib she certainly digs her
toes in,
* * * *
“Dusty Mile”: Lack of amenities,
marauding goats and accumulations of
litter are no indication of the absence of
civic pride outback, a fact that was dis-
covered by a city executive who took
charge of the firm’s branch in a wayback
Queensland township. Being on the
market to buy. goodwill, he decided that
this end could be met and the town im-
proved by appointing himself its cham-
pion. He began his campaign with an
article to the city press dwelling on the
hardships to be endured in his remote
area. Reaction was swift. He was
savagely told that he was “croolin’ the
joint” and testily informed that his “ma-
ligning was unwarranted.” The end came
with a devastating blast from the weekly
“Bugle.” The editor, inspired, produced
one of his rare editorials invoking the
wrath of all right-thinking citizens against
those who smirch the town which feeds
t “ em - The stricken, misunderstood
champion’s departure was only a matter
of days.
* * * *
“K.R.”; It is not “confidence in their
protective coloring” that makes insects
“freeze into immobility” (B. 25/8/’4B).
The conception of confidence implies a
reasoning mind, which all insects lack —
they act solely by instinct. Whereas man
and the higher animals learn by experi-
ence and education, insects start off with
a complete, though limited, mental box-
of-tricks ; they react to the same situa-
tion in exactly the same way in the first
minutes of their life and in their last.
They are “adult” at birth. Protective
coloring and the ability to freeze into a
background are not conscious develop-
ments on the part of insects. The more
any individual could look like its sur-
roundings the greater its chance of escap-
“Stop still, Aggie, so I can get a siltin' shot!”
ing the prying eyes of enemies ; after mil-
lions of years a whole species would come
to resemble its habitat. But, shifted to a
strange environment, an insect’s reaction
to danger is still' to remain motionless,
even when it now becomes death to stop.
Hence, the useless action of “Shamu-
seen’s” grasshopper on the unprotecting
white mosquito-net.
* * * *
“Nerehana”: Members of my tribe
rose in wrath when they read the par.
by “Uramao” (B. 11/8/’4B) in which he
referred to Hori and “too much wipiro.”
Ka kino, ehoa. Waipiro is the stuff on
which Maori and pakeha get shickered,
literal translation of the word being wai
(water), piro (smelly).

“B. A. Ker”; Christened Commo
because of his intense hatred of work,
the sulky-pony looked old enough to
have been an original I.W.W. But a
slow ride is better than a fast walk, so I
gratefully accepted his master’s offer.
Very promptly the old schemer dis-
covered my aversion to using the whip
—and took full advantage of the circum-
stances. Only constant slaps with the
rein kept him to a gait above a walk,
and when I allowed him to take it a
little easier up a slight incline he took it
as a signal to stop. The first corner we
came to along the road he attempted to
turn. Brought back on his course,
Commo moped along slowly until the
“ What's that you Were saying, Martha?”
next turn-off was handy enough to make
a bid for; he suffered his neck to be
pulled over the shaft before he aban-
doned the idea. Further along the
wheels jerked out of the ruts as, display-
ing a really creditable turn of speed, the
prad tried to dash for the opening where
two sliprails should have been. It was
a sulky pony (in the other sense) who,
responding reluctantly to the weighty
pull necessary to correct his bearings,
continued the journey. By now I had
begun to follow his reasoning: a turn
was the first requirement towards the
journey home ; an open gateway negoti-
ated meant the end of the trip—and rest.
Just as I’d completed my deductions
Commo tried to turn oft on to a cleared
fenceless block containing nothing but a
stack of bricks. A little further on he
tried to do the same where a house stood
half-built. His boss gave me the answer
—after Commo had raced home like a
horse a quarter his age; “I bought him
off the local brickie, and he’s still got
fixed in his thick head that a stack of
bricks or ton of sand means ‘journey’s
end.’”
* * * *
“Bungle”: The most efficient and un-
usual mouser I’ve seen was a blue crane
a cobber had as a pet. A study in
immobility, Bluey would park for hours
beside a mousehole, and his long
stiletto bill would strike unerringly in
nooks and crannies beyond the reach of
a cat’s claw.
* * * *
“Bo”: For confirmation of my claim
that prizes for absentmindedness would
never go to the occupiers of urban pro-
fessorial chairs, I submit the following.
Mathieson came over to borrow Hardi-
man’s light draught for the morning. Of
the two-hour conversation while draped
over the sliprails that this simple request
necessarily and traditionally involved,
approximately an hour was devoted by
Hardiman to a bitter condemnation of
the half-wit who yesterday had allowed
his hprse to stray and burst into his,
Hardiman’s, lucerne paddock and
which had necessitated his impounding
the animal. They switched naturally
from that subject to crops, and at the
end of the marathon yarn Mathieson
went home having completely forgotten
the matter of the borrowed horse. He
came back next day. Hardiman couldn’t
find the light draught anywhere. They
searched the paddocks and finally gave
up. It was Mathieson who learnt that
Hardiman, forgetful of the existence of
his own livestock, had impounded his
own horse when he caught it in the
lucerne paddock.

“Dong”: Up from the city on holi-
days, Gus’s nephew was having his first
encounter with a model T. He regarded
the foot-pedal gear-changes with all the
cockiness of a youngster whose own
people’s car carried the latest in synchro-
mesh on the steering-column. Gus had
just successfully guided the old bus up
a hill and on to a flat stretch when his
nephew brought a sad wheeze from the
engine by remarking “You know, Uncle,
on our car we’d change up into fourth
here.” Gus’s pride was hurt only for a
moment; then he broke into a grin:
“Fourth! Is that all she’ll do? Strewth,
with the floor-boards out of Lizzy here
I can get that pedal down so far that
I reckon she’d be in seventh!”
* * * ♦
“Zake”; Stepper Davis reposed un-
gracefully on the verandah of the little
shanty pub, the new lid he had bought
at the store still on his head as he snored
off the last of his cut-out jag. Came a
humorous-minded citizen who substituted
for the pristine cady a battered, greasy
object with a bullet-hole through the
crown. When Stepper sobered up slightly
he pulled the hat off, looked at it owlishly
a moment, and then a dreadful light pene-
trated the fog of his bcairi. “Migod!”
he shrieked hoarsely. “I bin shot through
the scone!” —and straightway threw a
sujgar-doodle. It took ’em nearly five
minutes to bring him to.
* * * *
“Steamship”; As most oceangoing
ships carry only 135 to 150 fathoms of
cable on each anchor, where does “Chal-
lenger” (B. 4/8/’4B) get “another 100
fathoms or so of chain” to pay out?
Reminds me of the story of the embryo
officer being examined for his second-
mate’s certificate: “You are lying at
anchor and it comes on to blow —what
would you do?” asked the examiner. “Let
go another anchor, sir,” replied the candi-
date. “It blows stronger, what then?” “Let
go another anchor, sir.” “It’s blowing a
full gale—what do you do now?” asked
the somewhat irate old seadog. “Let go
another anchor, sir.” Thoroughly ex-
asperated, the old gentleman barked
“Where are you getting all your bloody
anchors from?” “Same place as you’re
getting all the wind from, sir.”
* * * *
“Fairfield”: It might have been a
rock cod —I wouldn’t know —but from the
top of the cliff I could see the big body
under the green oiled-silk of the water.
Nosing among the rocks like a hunting-
dog the big fish presently emerged into
broken water, slipping out of the kelp
here, reappearing in a flash there. Then
it was his frolics brought him on the
shelf of rock where the fisherman had
cast his bait. Sniffing the titbit as a cat
might, the fish presently began to nuzzle
the bait,' then push it along the rock.
Next he picked it up, carried it eight or
nine inches, then dropped it. And at
that moment the fisherman struck. In-
stantly the fish wheeled, and, like a big
dog racing through long grass, swished
through the kelp. About 15 minutes
later he reappeared and moved cautiously
towards the bait. Alas! He had profited
nothing by experience. In one dive he
snatched up the morsel and presumably
swallowed it. The fisherman struck—the
battle was on. Suddenly the fish swerved,
lodged under a ledge—and stayed there.
The fisherman strained the line till it
sang, then suddenly released it. The
result was negative. He moved first one
way then the other. Finally he gave way
to temper and jerked. The line broke.
Rotten sport that I am, I felt like cheer-
ing.
* * * *
“Solitude”: The traveller rested one
polished boot on a log, propped himself
on his knee, and gazed critically at the
landscape. “It doesn’t grow the feed
here like it does down-country,” he re-
marked. “We carry two or three times
the stock per acre, and fatten ’em at
that. It’s good soil down there.” “Yair,”
Seventyfiver agreed drily. “And there
ain’t no trees on it, an’ y’ fence it into
garden plots, don’t y’? Ap’ chuck
manoor all around, an’ water it with a
water-can?” “It pays, anyway,” the
other replied. “Grows wonderful grass.”
“Yair?” The old bloke pulled out his
pipe. “We tried doin’ that down be the
homestead one year,” he remarked. “Had
a hundred crossbreds we thought we
might fatten, so we sprinkled super, about
an’ sowed down fifty acres. Then the
rains come an’ she grew awright.” “Did
it fatten the crossbreds?” “Well, no,”
Seventyfiver drawled. “We had bad luck
about them. Y’ see, soon’s the boss
spotted the growth he raced for his breed-
ing ewes, an’ when Uncle Jim gets a
eyeful, off he goes, too, for a big mob o’
wethers. Then young Jack don’t see why
he shouldn’t get a cut, so he arrives with
a few hundred weaners to fatten.” “And
they cleaned up the grass from your
mob?” laughed the traveller. “No, it
weren’t that,” the old bloke explained.
“We got them crossbreds t’ the gate
awright, me an’ Sol, an’ we shoved an’
yelled, an’ the dogs done their best, too,
but it was no good. We just couldn’t
squeeze room in the flamin’ paddick t’
fit our jummies in!”
THE SKIERS.
Now up the hill they labor through the snow,
Leaving their giant bird-tracks as they go.
Sun-dazzled, drunk with light, we stand and
stare,
Our breath hangs thick and cloudlike in the air.
Now they are hies that creep upon the hill,
Creep feebly to the top, then they are still
For one long breathless .moment edged with
fear;
Then, swifter than changing shadows, sharp
and dear,
A quiver of arrows shot from an unseen bow,
Black darts, they pierce the silent world of
snow,
Gome curving, sweeping through white timeless
space,
Faster than thought, in exquisite balanced grace,
Trailing behind a snowy, churning wake
That fans and sprays and falls back flake on
flake;
On past the white lace-mantled trees, on
Through the doors of the white-walled world,
and they are gone.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Breeding Stock.
“R. Howie”; Can’t agree with
“J.S.L.” (B. 28/7/’4B) about
buying breeding stock from in-
ferior country. Admitted that
sheep do badly if brought from
better to poorer conditions, but
that doesn’t prove that the re-
verse is true.
Animals reared on poor land
often suffer from mineral de-
ficiencies that take years of good
treatment to correct. Buy good-
framed but store-conditioned
stock for their cheapness, if you
have good paddocks, and mate
them as condition improves. But
avoid poor pregnant breeders;
their first drop may be stunted.
Anyhow, in these days of
scientific licks and manures it’s
lime we stopped talking about
good and bad country. Except
for the far outback, it’s mostly
good country carrying good, bad
and indifferent farmers.
“Fire—-or Water?”
“C.S.”; A year or so ago
The Bulletin thought it worth
while to spare a word of praise for
Jocelyn Henderson, an unusual
young woman who lives out of
HoP mok (N.S.W.), and is more
concerned with the denudation
of her country’s forests and its
failing watersheds .and catch-
ments than with the marital, con-
tortions of movie stars. Miss
Henderson, after a campaign of
public speaking and writing that
would have worn out a strong
man, managed to persuade many
local-government authorities in
Victoria and N.S.W. to take up
tree-planting and community
forests, and even succeeded in
stirring State legislatures into
action.
In between running the home
at Upper Wantagong and travel-
ling frequently all over the place
to address public meetings,
attend conferences and shake-
up all and sundry on these vital
questions, she has now published
Fire —or Water ? (Moore’s Book-
shop, Sydney), a booklet which
plainly asks south-east Australia
whether it wants to preserve its
water-catchments or see them
dried out by bushfires, the
wanton burning-off of grazing
leases and the inevitable
droughts that denudation causes.
A staggering amount of re-
search has gone into the book.
and Miss Henderson gives
chapter and verse, illustrated
here and there with telling pic-
tures, of the damage that has
been done and will continue to
be done so long as the problem
is neglected or, where an attempt
at solution is made, is so
gummed-up by different and fre-
quently conflicting authorities as
to become hopeless. After
offering her evidence, she offers
the verdict: That a land-utilisa-
tion council for eastern Aus-
tralia be formed and given
power, funds and staff to tackle
the job of saving the catchments
before it is too late —as it may
very well soon be.
Fire —or Water ? is an apt way
of describing the choice that lies
before eastern Australia, and
nobody interested in that choice
should miss reading the book.
It's a Great Gamble.
“E. 2”: Our n.-e. Victorian
district has much river-flat and
loamy terraces, a 30in. rainfall,
mild summers and hard win-
ters. The principal pastures are
of clovers, ryegrass and cocks-
foot mixtures, a portion on most
farms! being shut off from graz-
ing to be cut as meadow-hay
when the advanced growth be-
gins to dry off. Supplementary
crops of oats and millet are
grown for grazing, the former
valuable’ when growth is at a
standstill in winter and the latter
providing greenstuff in midsum-
mer when production might
otherwise drop back. Pig-rais-
ing is a profitable sideline, and
heavy crops of maize and pump-
kins are grown for feeding. ,
At present a good thing is
being made from dairying on
land that sells for up to and oc-
casionally above £5O an acre.
Pasture - improvement has
reached a high standard, and the
butterfat is handled by a co-
operative factory through which
“farmer-shareholders get bulk
stores at a rebate. There is a
veterinary service, and before
long it’s expected that all dis-
trict herds will be t.b.-tested.
Labor is scarce and expensive,
and a fair deal of time must be
spent in dealing with black-
berries and rabbits. Many are
spending heavily on • improve-
ments, which nets them some
tax exemption.
Since most farmers are trying
to make the best of the boom, as
expressed in paper money, there
is much overstocking, and fod-
der conservation is below the
safety margin. There is also a
tendency to let milkers fend for
themselves through the off-sea-
son. Consequently, they calve
in poor condition in August,
and the season is well advanced
by the time they are in top con-
dition. Unless conditions have
been just right through late
autumn and winter there is not
much growth in the grass till
September, when it comes away
rapidly.
Probably the deferring of
calving two or three weeks, plus
“Easy with those ropes, gentlemen—you re not in the
milking-yard now!”
keeping the cows in strong con-
dition with plenty of hand-feed-
ing beforehand, would pay much
better dividends. And over-
stocking should be avoided. Too
many dairyfarmers are apt to
judge on the higher returns for
a couple of months in the flush
of the season rather than base
their operations on averages for
the full lactation period. They
may get away with it in good
seasons, but inevitably they lose
when a bad one comes along.
The inevitable drought shouldn’t
be overlooked in the flush time.
Victorian Herd Test.
“Myrrhee”; Cows tested this
year—497s—exceed last year’s
figure by 1047, a record. Over
300 produced more than 5001 b.
of butterfat for the 273-day
period; 51 made over 6001 b.
and nine 7001 b. or more.
Herd championship went to
36 Jerseys owned by J. Stedman,
of Surrey, with an average yield
of 585.51 b. This is Stedman’s
second year in the Standard
Test; last year he won the re-
serve championship with a herd
average of 5481 b. Stedman has
600 acres of well-improved land
near Appin, in the Kerang irri-
gation area, and has managed,
milked and fed his herd during
the past two years with the sole
assistance of an 18-year-old
daughter. Reserve champion-
ship goes to G. F. Charlton,
Stony Creek, South Gippsland.
His 23 Jerseys averaged 572.51 b.
of butterfat, an excellent show-
ing for a comparative new-
comer.
Champion cow, the mature
Guernsey, Yarraview Carol,
owned by A. E. Payne, Yarra-
view Estate, Lilydale, took the
championship with a yield of
7691 b. of fat from 12,6741 b.
milk. Reserve went to W. C. R.
Gay’s senior-three Jersey, Elm
Grove Songstress Fifth, with
7481 b. of fat. The year’s highest
producer, A. E. Payne’s 10-year-
old Guernsey, Yarraview Le
Mode, made 8211 b., but didn’t
recalve within the stipulated 15-
month period. The same applied
to the Agricultural Depart-
ment’s Friesian, Victoria Belle
(7751 b.) and J. H. Goddard’s
three-year-old Ayrshire, Olive
Dale Dove (7631 b.).
Tappet Adjustment.
“Nubis”: Quickest and best
way to adjust overhead valve-
tappets is to do so while the en-
gine is running. Warm the en-
gine up with a run of at least
five miles, remove the valve-
cover, restart the engine and
slow it down as much as pos-
sible, then check the first ex-
haust valve with the feeler-
gauge. If it requires adjustment
undo the locknuts and turn the
adjusting-screw until the gauge
can be inserted. It should slide
in, not easily, but without being
forced. Then tighten the lock-
nut, at the same time holding
the adjusting screw in place with
the screwdriver. Check to en-
sure it has not shifted, and when
satisfied go on to the next valve.
After finishing the exhaust
valves do the inlet valves in the
same manner. It will' seem awk-
ward at first, but you’ll soon
get the knack. Finally replace
the valve-cover—renewing the
gasket if necessary —and re-
adjust the idling-screw.
Don’t —for the sake of an
extra-quiet engine—adjust the
valves to a lower clearance than
that recommended by the manu-
facturers. This causes heavy
petrol consumption, poor, slow
running, overheating and maybe
burned-out exhaust valves.
Rabbit-destruction.
“Ngaduri”: Agree that fumi-
gating (B. 11/8 / ’4B) is best, but
in bad hands, or if the job is
scamped, it is no more effective
than any other method. Trap-
ping first and fumigating later is
pointless, as the trapping spreads
the pest and encourages inva-
sion of new areas or reopening
of old warrens ; inefficient use of
the machine makes rabbits
burrow-shy.
Dispense with traps altogether,
train a good pack of hunting
dogs—foxies, stags and grey-
hounds —and hunt the area
every day for a week or so, tak-
ing it in strips: according to the
size of your pack and always
working up-wind. At the end of
the week bunny will head for
the burrow if he hears a dog
bark a mile away. Then use the
fumigator. Make sure the smoke
pours freely from each hole be-
fore stopping it, and, if neces-
sary, use the hose at two or
three places round the warren to
achieve this. Then the burrows
should be filled in, not merely
blocked up. Old bags, paper
and offal from previous rabbit-
ings stuffed well down the
burrows will discourage their
being opened; and the earth
should be rammed or trodden
tight and hard over the holes.
Pump the gas long after the
rabbits are heard kicking, and
always for a few minutes after

the pressure has been built up.
Keep pumping as the hose is
withdrawn.
Watch the warrens and repeat
the hunting-fumigating proce-
dure in a week if any of them
are opened. At any rate, fumi-
gating should be done twice each
in the autumn and early spring.
After fumigating plough up the
warrens, letting the share down
to its full depth. Harrow and
sow with a grass like tall fescue
—one which stock do not relish.
If the burrows are too deep for
the plough scoop the earth with
a grader-ditcher and plough
again; scooping the lot back
later. Alternatively, if boundary
netting justifies the expense,
plenty of explosive charges set
a foot deeper than the burrows
will do a great job of destroying
the “blocks of flats.” Experience
and the nature of the soil will
dictate amounts and number of
charges to use. Sow afterwards
with grass-seed.
Forget about the lost skins 1 ;
a fleece of good wool or a fat
lamb is worth far more than a
pound of skins.
A Garden Plan.
“Big Billy”: Whether it be a
home- or market-garden, watch
these points: Plant perennials
like asparagus and rhubarb
where they won’t interfere with
winter digging or trenching;
plant tall crops where they won’t
overshadow other crops; run
rows north and south to avoid
shading; if pumpkins, etc., are
grown in rows peg runners to
prevent them overrunning
smaller crops; weeding and
cultivation are easier when
vegetables are in rows.
Where smaller sowings are to
be made one long row of
different subjects is preferable
to several short rows, even
though each is of only one kind
of vegetable ; cultivation is easier
and danger of compacting less
where spacing is liberal; in
sloping gardens it is advisable
to have the rows running across
rather than up and down ; herbs
are best planted close together
and in easily-accessible posi-
tions ; soil-exhaustion will be
avoided and diseases kept to a
minimum if correct rotation is
practised.
Don’t allow two crops of the
same family to follow one
another. Alternate as follows:
Taproot vegetables (carrots and
parsnips), fibrous roots (cab-
bage, cauliflower), tuberous
roots (potatoes), legumes (peas,
beans). A notebook of garden-
ing activities will prove invalu-
able and might well include
vegetable and variety, when
sown, when transplanted, plant-
ing distances, crop it followed,
when ready for use, yield and
remarks (manure, frost, etc.).
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrr”: Horses badly
groomed and in poor health
attract lice, though sometimes a
healthy animal is attacked.
Look for lice at the bases of
mane and tail, occasionally in
other parts. Clip the horse and
work a kerosene emulsion into
(he skin, repeating in two weeks
to destroy any lice- hatched out
in the meantime. The emulsion;
lib. of soft soap in Igal. of hot
water, and as it cools stir in
a pint of kerosene.
“Canine”: Mixtures for bottle-
fed babies, which must be re-
turned by retailer to manufac-
turer after standing unsold for a
time, are good to ensure healthy
pups. The food should be given
in milk to the bitch from about
a fortnight before birth until the
pups are ready for solid tucker.
If the bitch is dry the pups will
do well on baby food given in
cow’s milk. Until they can lap it
up a line of bottles, each fitted
with a small rubber teat (eye-
drop rubbers), can be fitted in a
wooden frame as a mass feeder.
“Gem”: A good path can be
made without stones by using a
substitute of concrete and loam.
Put down a firm bed of screen-
ings. If they’re not available
cover the path with earth and
puddle it. When it’s dry spfead
over it a 2in.-deep 1-2-4 mix-
ture of cement, sand and gravel.
Allow to set for a week. Rough-
cast over the first layer to a
depth of about this time
with a mixture of 3-1 sand and
cement only, and with the aid of
a straight-edge pat the top down
firmly to give a flattened ap-
pearance. Top it off with a
scatter of red loam, tramped
down by foot, then wash off. It
should leave a mottled appear-
ance.
“M.”: Stock eating much
grain need a lime supplement,
best supplied in the feed. For
horses, cattle, sheep and pigs,
take four parts of lime (chalk,
ground limestone or slaked lime)
and one of salt, and mix 31b. of
this to each 1001 b. of grain. For
poultry lime is supplied in shell-
grit, but they’ll need of salt
to each 1001 b. of mash.
“Myrr”: Three main skin
diseases trouble dogs—mange,
ringworm, eczema. All can be
cured. Cut the hair closely over
the parts, wash with warm soapy
water and dab with methylated
spirits. Then, as follows; For
mange, rub in a 20 p.c. emulsion
of benzyl benzoate or 33 p.c. di-
methyl phthalate in oil,- twice a
week ; for ringworm, paint daily
with liq iodi tnitis, or alcoholic
triple dye ; for eczema, rub in
daily a lotion of zinc oxide,
sulphur, borochloretone, liq
picis carb. and carron oil.
“G.M.”; If there is a hum in
the wireless like that of high
telegraph wires, check on the
cord leading to power-point or
battery to see that it is as short
and direct as possible. Loose
cord pushed in the back of the
set often causes interference,
especially if crossing aerial and
earth terminals.

Gone are the days when crafts-
men’s loving care
Was lavished till the end on
tasks begun.
And work on slender spires that
cleft the air
Was handed down with pride
from sire to son;
When honest workmanship was
counted first
Right through to details hidden
from the sight.
And jobs were not adjourned for
quenching thirst
Or other idle pretexts just as
slight.
Yet one is bound in justice to
dispel
The notion that it would be hard
to find
In these our days at least one
parallel
To products of the medieval

Those paths reserved to olden

And holds that practised craft-

Simple Explanations.
“Anxious to explain ‘Government’
actions and to fight the swing away
from ‘Labor’ ; the Prime Minister is
considering giving Weekly talks to the
nation. The ‘Government’ wants
‘Labor’ stations to broadcast the
talks.”
“ —and that was, the Badnews
Sisters with Kerry Homo and
Count Boosie and his band in
the theme-song for this session:
‘There Ain’t No Flies on Ma
Cutie, ’Cos I Sprayed Her with
D.D.T.’ —and don’t forget: just
enough of Dr. Ratbagge’s Radio-
active Powder to cover a thrip-
penny bit taken in a dipperful
of cabba‘ge-water will positively
remove such unsightly excres-
cences as barnacles on the um-
bilicus and warts on the eye-
lashes. Now here is the Prime
Minister to give his weekly five-
minute talk,”
“Good evening, listeners. Pint
of all, I’d like to explain why,
whenever some honorable
member of the Opposition asks
me in the House whether I’ve
heard of a certain item of im-
portant news that has been
prominently displayed in the
press, I invariably answer that
‘My attention has not been
drawn to it.’ The public might
think that insufficient time
left over after reading crime-
thrillers, or just plain lack of
interest in anything not strictly
pertaining to socialisation
schemes or the carrying-out of
orders from Left-wing union-
leaders may have been the
cause. The actual explanation
is that whenever the carrying
happens the weaker. Having
cleared up that point I am
happy to announce that Caucus
has approved the expansion of
Cabinet to include a Minister
for Drawing the Prime Minister’s
Attention to the News of the
Day. He will administer this
new department, which is ex-
pected to so speed things up that
I’ll be made personally ac-
quainted with events of the day
as early as a fortnight after they
have happened. Now I’d also
like to” r-
“We interrupt this broadcast
to make a special announcement.
For the Flying Handicap at
Randwick tomorrow the Roarer,
Spavind and Lollylegs have been
scratched. Weights, post-
positions and jockeys will be
given and form discussed by
that wizard of the turf, Dud
P ickk er, in approximately
twenty-seven and a half minutes'
time."
“... .explain why the Govern-
ment appointed the Communist
Healy to the Stevedoring Com-
mission, and went out of its way
to make a passport available to
the Communist-party leader
Sharkey to visit those Com-
munist leaders in Malaya who
have since been murdering Aus-
tralians and Englishmen there.
“Apart from the fact that the
Communist party here is a
legally constituted body and thus
entitled to the same protection
as the Liberal or ‘Labor’ parties
enjoy, that its members just pur-
sue a harmless political philo-
sophy for which I refuse to be
panicked into crucifying them,
and that they run most of the
big unions and most of the big
unions run us, my reasons for
showing such strange sym-
pathetic consideration for
various Reds is that the harder
one dangles a worditch the
colder —and that explanation, I
think, is reasonable enough to
satisfy even the most one-eyed
Tory.
“There has been a lot of loose,
uninformed talk about the Guv-
verment’s hush-hush policy on
the Keane Trunks case, a
popular opinion being that if the
Guvverment can gag discussion
on it long enough the public will
get so used to the smell it won’t
notice it’s there. I can explain
Cabinet’s reluctance to allow dis-
cussion of it in the House ; it is
simply this, in plain language:
the higher the fewer. Voters,
appreciating the frankness with
which I have explained this, will,
I am sure, express their confi-
dence in ‘Labor’ at the elections
next year. Now”
“We once more interrupt this
broadcast to give you a most im-
portant item of news. The
‘Standard,’ organ of the A.L.P.,
will be on the streets tomorrow
with the scoop of the year: it
“Blast these third-dimensional films —I might hit the
operator."
will announce the commencing
date for night-trots, the proud
political monument to that great
statesman James McGirr. Re-
member, listeners; for bigger
and better betting, vote ‘Labor'!"
“ and other things for
which I am able to give open
and cogent explanations are:
Why the Guvverment has re-
fused an inquiry into allegations
that a ‘Labor’ member who
tripped overseas was kicked off
a plane and said to be fighting
drunk ; why the Guvverment re-
fused to hold an investigation
into charges made against a
Minister in a court of law
by the legal representative of
his former colleague; why
the Guvverment let the New
Zealand ‘Labor’ Guvverment
have millions of bushels of
Australian wheat at five and
nine a bushel when world-parity
price was seventeen shillings;
why the ‘Labor’ party threatens
to expel any member who joins
a proscribed Communist auxi-
liary, but allows the A.C.T.U.
to confer in perfect amity with
Communist trade-union leaders.
I explain these in the simple,
honest fashion of the homespun
philosopher that party propa-
ganda has boosted me as: that
when the plug is pulled out the
weightier.
“Next week I will give, in the
same forthright, honest way, the
reasons why reductions of taxes
I have been compelled to make,
though I said at the last elections
it was impossible to make them,
have resulted in an even greater
amount of tax being collected.
Good night, listeners.”
“This is your ‘Labor’ station.
You have been listening to the
Prime Minister. Now here is
‘Gab’ Galloway and his Penn-
sylvania Pansies playing ‘Yar
Kaint Take No Notice of What
He Says’.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Flats—and Health
Returning to the city after a year in
a rural district, I was showered with con-
gratulations when I found a flat after
only one day’s footslogging around hard
pavements. After a week in the two-
room monstrosity I’m not so sure that
congratulations were in order, but 1 am
sure that some stricter supervision should
be exercised over the sharks who cut up
houses with three-ply partitions and ex-
tract exorbitant rents for the divisions.
My “flat” consists of* two rooms
back with a gas-stovette, which means
all meals must be of the frying-pan
variety. Water is carried in from a
common tap in a pitcher. Lavatory
accommodation is by a 25yd. hike to an
earth closet, although the landlord pro-
vided a container for what he pictur-
esquely describes as “nightwater,” and
the flat is furnished with an article my
grandmother called a “utensil.” The ice-
box is in the passageway, and no door
separates the bedroom-cwm-sittjng-roons
from the kitchen-cwm-dining-room.
It isn’t quite what I had in mind when
I was sweating it out between ’39 and ’45,
but a survey of “flats” occupied by many
servicemen friends convinces me that I’m
more or less lucky. Some, for a similar
rent (30s. a week), haven’t as many
amenities as I have.
Unless the health authorities wake
up, Australia is going to have the same
conditions that obtain in London and
New York and other great cities. The
fashionable Regency suburbs of Soho and
Pimlico were slums when I knew them
22 years ago. Brooklyn in New York has
followed the example. Manchester has
its Hulme. And every Australian city is
following the pattern. As the city ex-
pands the wealthier owners move out
to a fashionable suburb. Their large
town houses are divided into “flats” and
then, as exorbitant rents can be obtained
for “flatettes,” a further subdivision of
floorspace is made. Outside, the house
still retains its genteel appearance, but
inside—well, a N.S.W. rabbit-warren
would be depopulated in comparison.—
Video (Q.).
Housing
Much of the housing delay can be
attributed to the red-tape of Govern-
ment and semi-Government departments
doing their best to harass prospective
home-builders and create jobs for them-
selves.
Last July I had a house-plan prepared
which had to be submitted to the State
Building Directorate for a permit. The
department took two months to “scrub”
the application. A revised and accept-
able plan was sent next to the State Sav-
ings Bank with an application for a loan.
Six weeks elapsed before this semi-Gov-
erament concern knocked the application
back £5OO.
Next, permit from the Camberwell
City Council wasted another six weeks,
and, incidentally, prevented the erection
of a garage, “as a car is not necessary for
your livelihood,” despite assurance that I
was a night-worker and used the car as
a conveyance from work after the trams
stopped running.
Eventually a start was made in De-
cember—five months after the original
plan was drawn up.
In the last nine months the builder
has made good progress, but has been
delayed continually by red-tape. Gas,
run by a private company, was on two
days after application was lodged. Elec-
tricity, run by the State Electricity Com-
mission, a semi-Government show, is not
on yet, although the application was
lodged in May. The Commission refuses
to connect power until all fittings are in-
stalled. All are wired-in except an Aus-
tralian-made electric stove, which the
Commission says must be modified. Yet
the same stove is recognised, without
modification, by every other State elec-
tricity undertaking in the Common-
wealth.
The Metropolitan Board, another semi-
Government show entrusted with sewer-
age and water, contributed further to the
delay by wasting one month testing the
sewerage-pipes after their manufacture.
Now, after 14 months’ patient waiting
with a veteran builder well established,
the fight continues against red-tape.
Unless jState Governments take drastic
action to stop this useless blundering
there will be little done to relieve Aus-
tralia’s housing shortage this decade or
the next. — Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
After six years as a medical officer ift
the A.1.F., I returned to civvy practice
two years ago —a partnership in a small
country town 300 miles from Sydney.
For six months the housing position
separated me from my wife and four
children, but eventually I found a small
“furnished” cottage over a mile out of
town.
I sent the plans of the house I wished
to build to the local council, and just as
they were about to be passed building re-
strictions were extended to country areas.
Twelve hundred square feet were no good
to me, so I made a special trip to Sydney
to see what could be done. The powers
kindly allowed me a little more than the
12 squares, but restricted me to a house
that looked like a butter-box and would
have been about as suitable. So I
scrapped my ideas of building. There
was a house in the town for sale, but the
blackmarket price was ridiculous.
We struggled on in our cottage. By
the time I had taken the front verandah
for a waiting-room and one room for a
surgery, we had three rooms and a
kitchen for six of us and whatever
“help” was available. It wa|s incon-
venient and we were cramped to despera-
tion, but even worse was the nervewrack-
ing job my wife had in keeping the
children quiet so that I could concentrate
on my patients.
Things have become so bad that we’ve
thrown in the sponge. My wife is tak-
ing the children on to her people’s pro-
perty, and I’m going as a Resident to a
public hospital.—O. P. D. (N.S.W.).
Country Slums
Early in the war, when industries were
springing up everywhere and emergency
housing was needed for large exotic
groups of workers, shanty-towns were
thrown up at a number of different
places. Assurances were given that these
slums were temporary: that with the
return of peace they would go.
Erected without a thought of town-
planning, their shanties were made of a
few squares of fibro, a few planks and a
few sheets of tin, held together by a
few nails and a prayer. They were sub-
standard homes, too small for the
families crowding them, and devoid of all
but the" barest utility, with no aesthetic
meaning whatever. Roads were tracks
on the ground, fences stretches of wire,
footpaths the ghosts of wandering feet.
The emergency has; long passed, but
the shanty-towns are still there. The
orators who opened them have shown no
interest in closing them. Late last year
I saw the shanty-town at Orange settling
down to permanency in all its ugly drab-
ness, and a few days ago I saw the
squalid settlement at St. Mary’s. Yet
Orahge claims to be a pretty town, and
St. Mary’s will soon be an important
suburb on the electrified main line to
Penrith. Shanty-town today makes it an
offshoot of Surry Hills.
In justice it should be recorded that
some of the inhabitants try to make
what can be made of these hopeless huts
with a little paint, a little gardening and
the like. The instinct for home-making
is by no means dead, but what chance
has it in surroundings which could never
be more than slums, mocked by the sun,
the birds, the trees and the surrounding
countryside?
Slums in the heart of a great city are
bad, but slums in the Australian bush are
shameful. — Dee (N.S.W.).
Out in the Cold
The Commonwealth Government put
a swift one over hundreds of public
servants who remained in the service after
their elected retiring age during the war.
After some pressure, it was announced
that the Superannuation Act No. 35,
1947, Section 29a would look after the
veterans who stayed put for a few more
years.
The Act was amended all right. It
provided that officers who elected to
retire at 60 years and remained on in the
service for varying periods up to five
years would receive pension increases
varying from 5 per cent, to 31 per cent.
But the Act was proclaimed on June 12,
1947, a year after most of the oldsters
had been eased out to make room for
returned soldiers for whom, rightly, jobs
had to be found. Any officer who was
retired before June 12, 1947, was pre-
cluded from the benefits of the Act.
My case is the same as hundreds. I
elected to retire at 60, but when the time
came my resignation was not accepted ;
for five years I remained in my job, the
pension being unpaid. My actual loss
was £750.
I don’t know how the Commonwealth
Superannuation Fund stands at present,
but this was the position at the end of
the 1945-46 financial year:
Total accumulated funds .. £13,833,100
Interest from all sources . . 510,482
Amount paid by board in
contributory pensions .. 893,584
Amount paid by contributors.. 915,890
Number of pensions in force at June 6,
1946: 9408.— Pongo (N.S.W'.).
Victorian Teachers
The Victorian Teachers’ Union is again
agitating for increased salaries, this time
£4OO a year’minimum and £1250 maxi-
mum. The Victoria:! outfit contains
enough Comrades to introduce “militant”
techniques, one of which —the flooding
of the Education Offices with belligerent
telegrams—drew a rebuke from W. H.
Ellwood, chairman of the independent
tribunal now hearing the claims.
The union is pressing for equal pay for
all divisions, primary and secondary, and
equal pay for the sexes.
The claim for equal pay for the divi-
sions is an extraordinary example of
“democratic” control. ’ The V.T.U. pub-
licises its members as “highly qualified.”
The bulk of the unionists have qualifica-
tions usually not exceeding one year at
the Teachers’ Training College, and
often less. It is remarkable that the
“One of you blokes slip up for her hat!"
highly-qualified secondary division —the
high and technical schoolteachers,
among whom are many brilliant students
and able instructors —should continue to
submit to the petty dictation of those
who have neither the brains nor the
initiative to gain solid university qualifi-
cations.
Hopelessly outnumbered at the annual
conference of the V.T.U. last January,
the qualified members just had to sit and
take it while the unqualified voted for
equal salaries all round.
The claim for equal pay for the sexes
is a concession to the subscriptions of
the many women members of the V.T.U.
In spite of exaggerated claims of effi-
ciency, based on the achievements of out-
standing members of the sex, women
generally have not the control, stamina,
health or the ability of men, even if they
have passed the same qualifying examina-
tions. Teaching involves more than the
ability to pass examinations. Their long-
term interest is in getting married, and it
is better for the nation that way. After
a certain not very advanced age only a
bomb would shift them out of their class-
room or cause them to miss afternoon
tea, and some of the hardest work in
modern teaching is done outside the class-
room.
When the question of equality of sexes
was raised last year V.T.U. ex-secretary
Black stated his view succinctly in the
Melbourne “Age.” His plain speaking
on the superiority of male teachers
brought yells of outraged anguish from
the old women (of whom there are plenty
of both sexes in the V.T.U.) and the
Commos, and he was promptly disowned
as speaking for himself. Mr. Black had
no axe to grind, and spoke the truth.
People on fixed salaries should un-
doubtedly have their pay adjusted to
compensate for inflationary trends —and
reduced on reverse trends. With the ex-
ception of the genuinely-qualified men
and women, the great majority of Vic-
torian teachers are paid as much as they
are worth—some a great deal more. —
Experienced (Vic.).
Lotteries Plain and Colored
In four States, three of them “Labor”
and one, W.A., only recently freed from
the shackles, lotteries sponsored or sup-
ported by the State are part of the regular
pattern of life. In Victoria Ministers of
the Cain Government shortly before its
fall toyed with the idea of entering the
field, and a “Labor” member last year
sponsored a bill for the purpose of giving
S.A. citizens the same opportunity of
putting in their money to make someone
else rich at present enjoyed in N. S.
Wales and Queensland.
In 1934 S-A. considered the whore
question of lotteries, to the extent of ap-
pointing a Royal Commission which took
evidence in several States and reported
strongly against them. Lyons, M.L.A.,
told an “Advertiser” man:
I once introduced a Bill for a State
Lottery myself, and my experience at that
time was enough to make me condemn it
for ever. I did not know there were so
many “go-getters” in the country, and i
hope South Australia will be spared such
a curse.
The S.A, Parliament chucked out the
1947 Bill neck and crop.
State lotteries are a curse and they
breed a nation of go-getters. Under the
guise of being a source of revenue for
the hospitals they take from the many
to give to the few. Of the tens of thou-
sands who stream through the doors of
the N.S.W. State Lottery Office not one
in a thousand gives a thought to
the hospitals. Evening papers
make a practice of interviewing
winners of major prizes. If any
of these fortunate people —their
fortune representing the aggre-
gate misfortune of thousands of
non-winners has ever an-
nounced his intention of giving
any of the winnings to the hos-
pitals or to other charity the fact
has gone unrecorded.
The evil of the system extends
beyond the State Lottery itself.
In N.S.W. today those with the
responsibility of raising money
for charitable institutions find
that there is only one way which
brings any response at all from
the public —by running an “art
union,” i.e., a lottery. Appeal
for funds and you waste your
efforts; print a million tickets
offering a car or a cottage for a
bob and you’ll soon be wonder-
ing why you didn’t print two
million.
The man in charge of raising
funds for one of Sydney’s most
deserving causes said recently
“It is a terrible confession to
have to make, but to raise
money nowadays it is no longer
of any use appealing to people’s
charitable instincts. We have to
appeal to their cupidity.”
To this level have the people
of a once charitable State been
reduced by the lottery craze.
Victoria and South Australia, still free
from the blight, should take warning.
—D. (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
1 agree with H. A. Lindsay (B.
4/2/’4B) that all gifts to art, literature,
museums or pure science should be free
of income tax. He is wrong, however,
in the statement that “money given to
a recognised charity escapes income tax/’
It did in the good old days before the
rebate system, when such gifts were
allowed as straightout deductions from
income, tax being calculated on the net
amount. Now, however, the tax is cal-
culated on the total amount of income,
and the rebate allowed is the amount of
the gift multiplied by the rate so estab-
lished. The effect is to increase the
rate per £1 on the gross taxable income,
so the gift does not altogether escape
tax. — Pronto (Vic.).
Permits to enter New Guinea (B.
14/7/ ’4B) did not originate during the
1939-45 war. As part of, Australia’s
charter of mandate, a bond of £3O was
demanded of ajl people entering the Terri-
tory, and issue of a permit indicated that
the bond had been lodged. Object of
the bond is to have a standing credit for
every person in the country to cover his
return fare to Australia if the Administra-
tion doesn’t want him in «the Territory.
The bond was increased last year to £5O,
probably because of the higher sea and
air fares from Australia to New Guinea.
It should not, however, be assumed that
the increased entry-fee means that the
Territory is a better place to live in.—
Lim-Limbu (N.G.).
What would happen to a moneylender
who tried to charge 20 per cent, interest
(B. 18/8/’48)? In this State he’d be
killed in the rush of prospective bor-
rowers. A Melbourne concern, long
established and well and favorably
known, offers to lend various sums at a
“rate per cent, per annum not exceeding
48 in accordance with the Act.” — Ceg

Radio at its best
The superiority tpf the A.W.A. Radiola
is the result of A.W.A.’s thirty years leadership of the
radio industry and unequalled research and manufacturing
resources. The range of A.W.A. Radiolas comprises twenty
different models covering all city and country require-
ments including personal portables, mantel models,
consoles, radiograms and. car radio.
COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF MODELS EOR ALL
CITY AND COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS
MANTEL RECEIVERS AT ECONOMICAL PRICES
The A.W.A. Radiolette and Radiola mantel models fill the need for a small
receiver at a very economical price. Ideal as a second set in the home or for
the small home or apartment, they are constructed to the same standard
of excellence as the larger Radiolas.
TABLE RECEIVERS WITH CONSOLE STANDARD OF
PERFORMANCE
These receivers, of intermediate size, combine many of the advantages of
the mantel insofar as size and portability are concerned, yet provide per-
formance comparable with console models. A larger loudspeaker and cabinet
make possible a greater depth of tone than is possible with a mantel reciever.
CONSOLES —THE FINEST RECEIVERS AVAILABLE
Where the finest performance and tone quality are desired the console is
supreme. In many homes the console is now used in the lounge room and a
mantel model in the kitchen, bedroom or verandah. The equipment of the
modern home is now considered incomplete without two or even more A.W.A
Radiolas.
RADIOGRAMS—THE COMPLETE INSTRUMENT
The Radiogram provides complete home entertainment first-class radio
reception and reproduction of records. Table and console models are available.
Authorised Radiola Distributors in all parts of the
Commonwealth will gladly arrange demonstrations,
