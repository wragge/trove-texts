National Notebook
The Body Business
a university revue plot scripted
A jointly by Sir Garfield Barwick and
Lennie Bruce and you have the tale of
Mr Bert Monahan and the Body
Business. But since Sir Garfield and
Mr Bruce went to different universities,
this MUST be true.
Scene: Perth. A group of undertakers
are deep in conclave. They are discussing
a cosy little arrangement by which they
pick up the results of suicides, fatal road
accidents, and other violent deaths,
taking them to their parlors. Cost to
the WA Government is only £3 10s. a
body. The group roster themselves for
the job . . . and nearly always score a
fat funeral fee.
On stage comes former theatre-
manager Mr Bert Monahan, who says
he will be the first man
for 35 years to break into
the system. A friendly
man, he tried twice to join
the morticians’ society.
Each time, he says, he is
knocked back. So, to get
business, he offers to do
the Government contract for nothing.
How to beat this tender? asks the
group. A few days before tenders close,
according to Mr Monahan, he is finally
given 24 hours to join—and presumably
to share the wealth. He refuses.
So for the group there’s only one
answer, restrictive trade practices or no:
Undercut him . . . PAY the Govern-
ment for the privilege of picking up the
bodies . . . £3OO outlay for the pros-
pect of 900 funerals a year.
Fair enough.
Soliloquy
T>ecovering from a spectacular ear-
bashing by Sir John Gielgud, a
group of Melbourne Pressmen feel that
the Australian Journalists’ Association
should compile a few modest rules of
etiquette for the guidance of visiting
notables for whom Press conferences are
arranged. Knowing that their assign-
ment was unlikely to rate front page
double columns, the interviewers had
prepared only a few questions, but even
these could not be got in during a 90
minutes non-stop Gielgud soliloquy.
“The public,” Sir John said, “has no
emotional veneration for actors now. It
reserves that for the Beatles and Eliza-
beth Taylor.” As a producer he is “dis-
turbed that so many authors deny the
producer’s right to ask for changes in a
play”, and he cited Noel Coward and
Graham Greene as culprits.
St John Ervine was presumably an-
other, for Ervine has recounted how he
withdrew his play “People of our Class”
when the then Mr Gielgud proposed
alterations “which would have made it
an interesting play by Mr Gielgud but
would have taken out of it all the
character that I imagine to be mine”.
Hellfire
Tn the days of fire and brimstone ser-
mons, Reverend Manu Bennett, the
Maori minister of St Faith’s Anglican
Church, Ohinemutu, on the shore of
Lake Rotorua, New Zealand, would have
had the best background props any
minister could wish, or
pray for.
St Faith’s, which -at-
tracts thousands of tour-
ists each year to view its
Maori carvings and woven
wall panels, is not far
from Tikitere (Hell’s
Gate) where some of New Zealand’s
most spectacular thermal activity can be
seen. Because of thermal activity around
the church yard, the bodies of men who
served in the Maori battalions of two
world wars lie in brick vaults above the
ground.
And Reverend Bennett is losing the
battle against the fiery depths. The cor-
rosive action of the thermal activity has
damaged much of the tukutuku weaving
of the wall panels and they need re-
placing. On top of this the church is
nearly 50 years old and the congregation
is rapidly growing. To overcome the com-
petition from the Devil’s Domain an
appeal has been launched to renovate
and expand the historical church.
From the North
HThe English Association of the Towns-
A ville University College has just
brought out the first issue of its magazine
“North”. “North’s” beginnings are mod-
est but hopeful. Help and inspiration was
provided by Ernestine Hill, who lives on
Magnetic Island. The first issue contains
a piece by George Holland, former drama
critic of the London “Illustrated News”
now living near Cairns. He deplores the
fact that in Queensland’s “primary schools
the reading books are chiefly confined to
fifth-rate Queensland authors, while all
the wealth of world literature suitable to
their age group is denied the children.”

End of a legend
T egends revived by the death of an
old man in London have relegated
to the kindergarten current stories of
financial failures. For, in no respect
could today’s financiers have held a
candle to Claude de Bernales. Those
who remember him, even though they
may have been hurt by the crash of his
gold-mining empire, get a far-away look
in their eyes when they talk of him . . .
each with his own favorite legend.
One man very prominent in Perth’s
financial world says of the late Mr de
Bernales: “When 1 say his physical pres-
ence was overwhelming, 1 mean just that.
It’s hard to conceive the type of man he
was. He was more than 6 ft. tall and
huge with it. He wore lavender colored
washed-leather gloves, spats, a monocle,
and the double breasted coats that w'ere
high fashion in those days. He cut a
magnificent figure. A WA Premier said
to me once: ‘I wouldn’t dare be with him
alone for fear I'd give the State away.’ ”
It was from London that Mr de
Bernales sailed as a man of 21 to join
the Coolgardie gold rush. Even before
the Great War he had become a big
man in the mining machinery business,
and had bought up a number of “worth-
less” mines. During the war the value
of plant soared; he was on his way. Then
came a move cited by many of his wor-
shippers as the one act that should atone
for all that came later. With a brilliant
piece of organisation, Mr de Bernales
spearheaded a deputation to Canberra
which won for a State crippled by
the Depression a bounty on gold. For
his effort many fringe mines came within
his control.
But very soon after this the price of
gold moved up, so the bounty was not
needed. Meanwhile Mr de Bernales had
a number of now-profitable mines. In
1931 he took the City of London by
storm. He launched gold-mining com-
panies worth £6,000,000 a fantastic
amount in those days. Before long there
was a labyrinth of interlocking com-
panies. and Mr de Bernales was installed
in a magnificent Spanish villa overlooking
the ocean at Cottesloe.
This lasted for several years before
London Stock Exchange, in 1939, started
the crash by barring eight of his com-
panies. After the war, an official re-
ceiver in London pronounced the de
Bernales empire almost worthless. A bar-
rister at the Chancery describee! the
companies as “born in fraud, carried on
in fraud, and laid to their deathbed in
fraud.”
About 400,000 small investors were
left lamenting, and Scotland Yard got to
work. The police claim they stopped be-
cause their efforts would have earned the
shareholders nothing, and killed the sick,
old man; Mr de Bernales’ admirers
maintain they could find no evidence
against him.
There are many monuments to Claude
de Bernales . . . worthless shares kept
as souvenirs, the Elizabethan-style arcade
London Court in Perth, which he built,
his home, which is now Cottesloe Civic
Centre. But none is as eloquent as the
look of grudging admiration WA people
get when they tell their favorite de
Bernales legend.
Failure
TThe Australian tour by a group of
Soviet tourists, planned for this
month and arranged by the Australian
Soviet Friendship Society, has been can-
celled. With the failure of this venture,
plus the failure of the society's lottery
—first prize a trip to the Soviet Union
—it seems problematical whether next
year's Australian tour by a Russian
farmers’ delegation, to be followed by a
super festival with either Shostakovitch
and/or an astronaut, will come off.
"I used to run a public company before I went straight."


PLAIN ENGLISH
The ALP Neurosis
TT has become clear over the last
couple of weeks that the Aus-
tralian Labor Party will not return
to power for many years and it may
never return. In ordinary circum-
stances one would expect a drasti-
cally defeated party to be willing to
face the facts, to look for the
reasons, and to do something about
them. But three weeks after their
rout it is plain that the Labor Party
is in such a mess, is guided by such
hopeless (and probably neurotic)
diehards that it will go on flounder-
ing for election after election. As
an alternative government it really
is ludicrously beneath contempt.
For example, it is beyond dispute
whatever priority one picks on
that the ALP was beaten in
November because of its foreign
policy, its defence policy, its attitude
to Communism, and its policy on
Church schools. The Australians
just do not like this particular Labor
Party with its mixture of old-fashion-
ed, stupid and dangerous policies.
So what does the party do about it?
In the Leftist States, like Western
Australia, Victoria and Queensland,
they say they were defeated because
of the Right wing, and the solution
is to sack the NSW Executive. In
NSW they are so scared to say any-
thing at all that they decide to pass
the buck to the branches and collect
their opinions.
The alarming thing is that the
only group that seems to know what
it wants is the Leftists. If as is
possible —they get their way, what
is left of the ALP will become a
completely pro-Communist Party.
This guarantees their permanent
defeat (and could even lead to the
DLP growing into the leading
Labor party), but unfortunately the
time for such absurdities has passed
and Australia cannot afford the
luxury of a major fifth-column
party.
So, naturally, people look to the
Right wing of the ALP for leader-
ship. Yet no signs of leadership are
forthcoming. One looks in vain to
the great anti-Communist union,
the Australian Workers’ Union; one
looks in vain to the Rosses, the Ken-
nys, the Shorts though, to his
credit, Short has attacked the gut-
lessness of the NSW Executive.
With the Left wing taking the
initiative and the Right wing quietly
watching, it is certain that there will
be no reforms at all and the ALP
will carry on in its present blunder-
ing suicidal way. For example, quite
apart from any radical proposals for
an alliance with the DLP which,
as sure as night follows day, will be
done in the end one obvious
decision that should be made, if the
ALP wants to win an election, is
to prohibit any union which employs
Communist officials from being
affiliated with the ALP. After all, at
State ALP Conferences 75 per cent
of the delegates come from unions,
and some of the major unions (such
as, in NSW, the engineers, miners,
wharfies, builders, and sheetmetal
workers) are Communist-controlled.
Why on earth should delegates from
unions pledged to destroy the ALP
be allowed to decide the policy of
the ALP? Prohibiting this sort of
thing as was done before the
1954 split would be a good start
to reforming the ALP and to con-
vincing voters that it meant business
in its opposition to Communism.
Scandals about unity tickets and
Communist fronts really follow
from this basic disorder of Com-
munist unions.
But who in the ALP apart
from minor youth groups really
stands for this sort of reform?
Those really concerned with these
matters can only expect to spend
the next few years watching the
continuous decline of the ALP as it
moves further Left.
A Matter of Time
TT is quite apparent that the Aus-
A tralian Government will have to
increase its pace rapidly in New
Guinea. Mr Dudley McCarthy
an old New Guinea hand himself
and formerly a senior officer in the
Territories Department made a
very reasonable and telling speech
to the Trusteeship Council in New
York last week but it is obvious
that it has fallen on very deaf ears.
Colonialism, no matter how enlight-
ened, is under increasingly savage
attack by the Afro-Asians and the
processes of de-colonisation, no
matter how orderly or rational or
sensibly conducted in the interests
of the colonial subject peoples, will
have to be speeded up. Australia is
probably going to be the last colonial
power in the world administering
one of the world’s largest colonial
areas. Australians simply cannot
delude themselves that we can
be an exception to the pressures
now being exerted on Britain,
the greatest and most enlight-
ened colonial power the world
has seen. The principal problem in
New Guinea seems to be the laud-
able but dangerous notion shared
by the Minister and the Adminis-
tration alike that the development
towards political independence
should follow fairly closely that of
economic development. The plain
fact is that external pressures and
influences will force the political
pace in New Guinea long before the
economic prerequisites are any-
where in sight.
Very few of the Administration’s
senior officers have travelled in
Africa or Asia. The Minister him-
self has not been a great traveller.
Consequently few of those re-
sponsible for the administration
and political development of New
Guinea have any conception of the
strength of the passions still raging
in the Afro-Asian world on the sub-
ject of colonialism.
The responsibility for helping to
bring New Guinea to political in-
dependence is a very onerous and
thankless task. The results cannot
be, in the time allowed, very en-
couraging and there is no case for
setting our sights too high. One of
the gravest dangers is that those
who are actually responsible for the
administration of New Guinea, who
work and live there, tend to think
that the outside world is further
away than it is. Nothing could be
more misleading.

BUSINESS—I
The Worst Week
In History
w Improper management practices' 9
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
HARRY MESSEL
Unlikely
"VTo Australian company formed in the
last three years has caught the
imagination and the financial backing of
so many of the big reputable financiers,
both here and overseas, as the Aus-
tralian Factors group whose story of a
£532,839 loss, after providing £926,069
for the bad and doubtful debts for the
year to June last, rocked the investment
world last week even more than the
further instalment of £2.3 million losses
from Latec and another lopping of more
than half a million from Chevron Syd-
ney. All told, including a loss of
£316,136 by W. A. Peterson Ltd, the
Melbourne hotchpotch of radio, electrical
and engineering interests, and £250,069
by Neon Signs (Australasia), companies
threw up losses of nearly £4 million in
the course of the week, the worst in Aus-
talian company history.
Following the path laid by Mr Stanley
Korman in Factors Ltd (and a few other
concerns like Victorian Factors, Tozer
Kemsley and Millbourn), two New South
Wales MLCs, A. E. Armstrong and
S. L. M. Eskell, together with W. S.
Lamerton and the unlikely figure of Pro-
fessor Harry Messel, started Australian
Factors in October, 1960.
Since then original paid capital has
been multiplied several times and funds
supplemented by substantial amounts of
debenture money. Victorian and Queens-
land associated companies have been
formed and issues underwritten by lead-
ing brokers in the three big eastern
States. In this blowing-up process both
Australian United Corporation (which
acquired 24 per cent of the parent
company's capital early this year) and
Development Finance Corporation have
been brought in, as well as leading over-
seas merchant banks, Schroeder, Wagg
and Minster.
The going looked to be extremely good
until a warning note was struck in a
special report to stock exchanges in
August this year. This said that profit
would be substantially lower than that
indicated by an interim report for the
half year to December 31 last, showing
profit for that period only a little short
of the full year’s profit of £69,903 for
the previous year. In May things had
looked so promising that £500,000 was
raised in debentures from institutions
which also took up a wad of ordinary
capital at a 100 per cent premium on
the ss. par value of the shares. This
raised a further £212,500 bringing paid
capital up to £950,000, nearly a fivefold
increase in two and a half years.
It now seems as if lan Potter and Co.’s
offshoot, Australian United Corporation,
liked the look of the company much
better from the outside than from
the inside for in July this year a
special investigation by an independent
firm of chartered accountants into the
group’s affairs was set in train and now,
as the directors reveal, “a most dis-
quieting state of affairs” has been dis-
closed.
Further, the auditors add, “substantial
bad debts had been incurred because the
directions of the board as to the method
of conducting the business of the com-
pany had been disregarded, even though
the board was informed that the directed
procedures were being implemented.
“It was also found that, due to im-
proper management practices having been
adopted, large sums of money were
owing by customers whose liability to pay
depended upon the realisation of assets,
which realisation could only be effected
over a lengthy period considerably in
excess of that normally to be expected
in factoring operations.
“It is now quite apparent that for time
the management reports and accounts
submitted by the general manager, Mr A.
Corne, and the secretary, Mr R. Cox
(both of whom have since been dis-
missed) were designed to prevent the true
state of affairs being known to the direc-
tors and to the auditors.”
The group’s former managing direc-
tor, Mr W. S. Lamerton, “was removed
from that office during the year but
remained a director of the company”.
Mr Lamerton has now resigned.
BUSINESS—II
Where Did Mum’s Money Go?
A Case for the Investigator
BY J. C. HORSFALL
Tf the Victorian Government can find
A a brace of lawyer-accountants with
time on their hands, there seems work to
be done in unravelling the skein of
W. A. Peterson Ltd, a Victorian and
erstwhile South Australian heterogeny of
interests in anything from radio rentals
to rolling stock, even if the losses of
public money involved are a mere mole-
hill compared with, say, Reid Murray’s
and Latec’s.
It will be remembered that this is the
group that in 1961 through a new sub-
sidiary formed for the purpose, W. A.
Peterson Securities Ltd, sent out a most
intimate call exclusively to the “mums”
of the country, over its Webb’s Radio
broadcasts, to invest their money in an
issue of £lOO,OOO first mortgage deben-
tures and, a year or so later, repeating
the message, asked for a second and
double helping. “I can wholeheartedly
recommend this issue to shareholders
and the investing public,” said the chair-
man, Mr W. A. Peterson, at the annual
meeting in October last year. “Share-
holders in particular will be doing them-
selves a double favor of making a sound
and high-yielding investment and at the
same time enhancing the profit-earning
capacity of their company.”
All that was backed by a most
optimistic account of the group’s pros-
pects on every side: the Wiles engineering
business in Adelaide; Webb's Radio and
Electrical whose sales were then “topping
by more than 30 per cent the previous
record which has stood for eighteen
months”, calling for a budget reappraisal
to increase staff and extend existing
premises and facilities; and also Finlay
Bros where operations were being ration-
alised in smaller premises, freeing the
Elizabeth Street building for disposal.


The date of that account was October,
1962.
But seemingly, while the new money
from the second debenture issue was
coming in, the picture was beginning to
change drastically, for in March this year
one heard that the structural engineering
section of Wiles was being disposed of,
in May that the interim dividend was
being passed (10 per cent all told for the
previous full year from profits of
£77,752 and earnings of 28.1 per cent)
and a “reduction” in profits reported des-
pite Webb’s Radio achieving turnover and
profit “substantially in excess” of the
same period of the previous year.
Not long after that we hear that
Webb’s Radio and Electrical is in the
hands of an official manager, that
negotiations are proceeding fora compro-
mise payment to creditors of this sub-
sidiary, that the whole of the Wiles sub-
sidiary is being sold, and that liquidity
problems are rife.
Then came last week’s bland announce-
ment that in addition to a loss of
£40,335 on the sale of the Wiles and
Finlay Bros assets, the group had a
trading loss for the year to June 30 of
no less than £316,136 of which £87,700
was provision for possible future losses
on hire purchase outstandings. Doing
all the sums, it is clear from this that not
only have all shareholders’ funds gone
down the drain but the group was, at
June 30, about £150,000 in the red.
ELECTIONS—I
Those Faceless Men
and the Labor Party
A voice for Mr Calivell?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
F. STEWART
Rolled
A surprisingly large number of re-
ports to the ALP claim that the
domination by the “thirty-six faceless
men” of the Federal ALP Conference
(and their 12 “faceless” counterparts on
the Federal ALP Executive) over the
Labor Party and its parliamentary rep-
resentatives was a major factor in decid-
ing the recent Federal election in favor
of the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Men-
zies, and his Liberal-Country Party ad-
ministration.
Now NSW is trying to reassert the
independence and dignity of
Labor’s parliamentary wing so denigrated
that the Federal Labor Leader (Mr Cal-
well) and his Deputy (Mr Whitlam) who
waited like lackeys in the dark outside a
Canberra hotel while inside 36 men
decided what was possibly one of the
most important issues to Australia of
recent years Labor’s attitude to the
proposed United States’ Naval Radio
Communications Station at Exmouth
Gulf.
Mr Frank Stewart, a Sydney Right-
winger in the House of Representa-
tives, must be getting a wry amusement
out of the new proposal put forward
by the NSW ALP Executive for six
members of the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party the two leaders and four
members of the Federal Parliamentary
Executive to sit on the ALP Federal
Conference with the 36 faceless men.
Mr Stewart must also wonder whether
the charge that the Federal Parliamentary
Tabor Party is led from behind is not
justified.
The NSW Executive has “prettied up”
their suggestion for parliamentary parti-
cipation on the Federal Conference by
suggesting that this would bring the
Australian Labor Party into line with
the British Labor Party and enable the
parliamentarians the experts to
participate in the making of policy on
the Federal ALP Conference, Labor’s
supreme policy-making body.
But basically the suggestion is the same
as that put forward by Mr Stewart to
a Caucus meeting in the lifetime of
the last parliament.
He suggested that the four Parliamen-
tary Leaders Mr Calwell. Mr Whit-
lam, Senator McKenna and the Senate
Labor Leader and Senator Kennelly the
Deputy Senate Labor Leader—should
have the right to sit in on Conference
discussions.
But Mr Stewart got no backing from
Mr Calwell, who said, weakly, he did
not mind what decision Caucus made.
Mr Stewart got rolled.
Now NSW has seen the light and is
trying to do something about it.
But it is rather like locking the stable
door after the stallion is miles away in
the mountains with the brumby herd.
Locking the door now cannot undo
the harm done at the last election but
merely prevent a repetition of the same
happening at future elections.
ELECTIONS—II
The Jewish Vote
Encouraging anti-Semitism?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Tn the various election post-mortems
few are raising as much heat as the
one in the Jewish community. The most
outspoken statement so far has come
from Mr Newman Rosenthal, a member
of the Jewish Board of Deputies, who is
also head of the Department of Audio-
Visual Studies in the University of Mel-
bourne.
In a current “Australian Jewish
Herald", he writes: “The Jewish Com-
munity of Australia, whether it realises
it or not, is playing with fire. Events
of the last few weeks have their lesson
for every Jew in this country. If you,
yourselves, want to begin creating anti-
Semitism in all its virulence, you have
been shown the way."
He gave three telling examples. Firstly,
the “New South Wales Jewish Press,
convinced obviously that it was on a
political band-wagon, refused to print
news items that gave credit to an Aus-
tralian Government that had proved
sympathetic to so many humanitarian
Jewish issues”.
This was a reference to the fact that
no Jewish paper in Sydney publicised the
recent statement by Sir Garfield Barwick
—in line with earlier statements —that
he had instructed Australian representa-
tives in the UN to take any opportunity
to raise the question of the persecution
of Jews in the Soviet Union.
Further, Mr Rosenthal went on,
“whilst suppressing information about
. the Government’s pro-Jewish efforts, the
NSW Jewish Press appealed to the Jewish
community to elect one non-Govern-
ment candidate on the obvious grounds
that he was Jewish!"
This was a reference to Mr S. Einfeld,
the now defeated AFP member for
Phillip, NSW, who is Senior Vice Presi-
dent of the Executive Council of Aus-
tralian Jewry.
In another electorate, according to
Mr Rosenthal, where there is “a large
concentration of Jewish voters and one
in which the challenging AFP candidate
was Jewish, the president of the Execu-
tive Council of Australian Jewry sat on
the platform, whilst a speaker attacked
the sitting Fiberal member [Mr W. C.
Haworth] who himself had been respon-
sible for raising in the Australian Parlia-
ment the issue of Soviet Jewry and
whose persistence led to it being de-
bated, on Australia’s initiative, in the
United Nations”. This was a reference
to the seat of Isaacs in Melbourne.


Mr Rosenthal made it clear he was
not recommending support for any
political party otherwise he would have
made his appeal before the election
only that Jewtsh leaders and the Jewish
Press should speak for their community
. , •, L J
and not identify themselves with any
p art y
Meanwhile the commitment of Jewish
leaders with political ambitions to the
ALP—despite the equivocation of many
of its members on the question of
Russian anti-Semitism and the concern
f or Jewish interests shown by many
Liberals—is a dangerous course. “Should
we accuse people,” Mr Rosenthal con-
, , tt , 5 0 r A
eludes, of anti-Semitism, of misinterp-
. ’ , , ’ , ,
retation, if they concluue that, on the
evidence available, one political party
has the Jewish community well and
truly in the bag?”
THE DOVERS CASE
Epilogue to a
Court-Martial
Strong feelings in the Navy
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
W. J. DOVERS
Cleared
news that the Naval Board has
"*■ quashed the verdict against Captain
W. J. Dovers RAN, the former captain
of HMAS Sydney, in connection with
the whaler tragedy, closes a chapter that
had left an aftermath of considerable
dissension and distress. But one last
question should be asked. Is the system
of courts - martial suitable for armed
forces as small as those of Australia?
The question applies with peculiar
force to the Navy, the smallest of the
services. There are only about 1,500
naval officers in all, and as they change
appointments every two years they tend
to know each other well and to have
served together at one time or another.
In a matter like the recent court-martial
personal feelings are therefore inevitably
involved. Take for example the question
of appointing officers to serve on the
courts-martial. As three officers were
tried, it was necessary according to the
regulations to establish three separate
courts, each of five officers. It would
be quite impossible to find fifteen offi-
cers of suitable rank who had never
served with the accused, and had no
personal feelings about them.
Admittedly the circumstances leading
to the recent courts-martial were unique,
and past history has not pointed to the
disadvantages of the system in the same
way. The Navy had never had a similar
tragedy. Accidents involving loss of life
in the Army and Airforce have occurred
but courts-martial have not followed.
When service aircraft crash there are
rarely any survivors, and in any case
public reaction is one of sympathy
rather than of desiring to know who was y
to blame. The Army lost a number
of cadets in a sailing accident on Lake
George a few years ago, but no court-
martial followed that.
A feeling that naval officers were un-
der a special disadvantage had much to
do with the strong feelings aroused in
Naval circles about the courts-martial.
Captain Dovers and two of his officers
had the ordeal not only of the courts-
martial but also of a preliminary public
inquiry. The fact that this inquiry was
public was another source of great resent-
ment in naval circles. The Minister for
Navy, Senator Gorton, in answer to a
question in the Senate, promised a pub-
lic inquiry, although this was contrary to
Queen’s Regulations which state that any
inquiry into loss of life should be held
“behind closed doors”.
The Minister’s departure from the
regulations gave rise to rumours of poli-
tical pressure all through the affair, but
otherwise what happened was strictly
according to the book. The report of the
board of inquiry came to the Flag Offi-
cer Commanding the Fleet (Rear Admiral
A. W. R. McNicoll) and he decided
after considering it that three officers
should be tried by courts-martial.* Two
were acquitted, but the Captain was
found guilty on a charge of having
“failed to inform himself of the progress
of a whaler”. A report of the proceedings
then went to the Navy’s professional legal
adviser, and on the basis of his recom-
mendation the verdict was quashed as
not being in accordance with the evi-
dence.
It is only at this final stage of courts-
martial that professional legal opinion
is sought. Should it be brought in
earlier? All Supply officers in the Navy
are given some legal training, and one
of them is appointed as “judge advocate”
to advise the court on le-'al points—but
not to sum up or to guide its verdict.
Courts-martial in fact are essentially
amateur. As such they have a good
reputation for achieving “substantial
justice”, but in cases involving serious
charges or loss of life a great deal of
passion and distress would be saved if
the administration of justice could be
taken out of the hands of the brother
officers of the accused.
["’Correction: In a report of the court-
martial proceedings in our issue of
December 7 it was incorrectly stated
that the prosecutor Captain Mesley (who
also presided over the board of inquiry)
had recommended the courts - martial.

THE JOURNALIST AND THE ALDERMAN
ffiJz>ulCetCei
80 Years Ago: December 22, 1883
We take this picturesque fable
from a Victorian country paper:
“At a meeting of the Richmond
Borough Council, in Victoria, an
alderman chased a reporter with a
bottle of whisky under his arm.” The,
alderman, we suppose, was chasing
the reporter in order to get him to
take a drink. You have to use
violence to a journalist over there to
make him take anything stronger
than cat’s milk. Here, when a press-
man joins a daily paper, he has an
iron stock fixed around his neck, like
the rings Chinese fishermen fasten
around the necks of cormorants to
prevent them from swallowing fish,
This is to keep him from drinking
more than a tankful of rum at a time.
The editor keeps the key. Previous to
the use of this contrivance, if you
went into a bar where there were jour-
nalists drinking, you could hear the
rum roaring down their throats like a
river roaring down a rocky gorge,
Now the sound is only a gentle gurgle,
like that of a gutter after rain. It
strikes us, however, that the Richmond
reporter, and not the alderman, might
have had the bottle. If so, the former
was no doubt carrying off the bottle to
prevent the alderman from plunging
into excess. It must have been this. No
reporter who was not a rabid tee-
totaller would be sober enough to run
after attending a Borough Council.

!;iiy
We at Penfolds have always believed that Australia
can produce wines and spirits as fine as any in the
world. Ever since the days of the founder, Dr. Rawson
Penfold and his son-in-law, Thomas Francis Hyland, we
have worked towards this end.
And every year it becomes plainer—Australia is
fast becoming one of the world’s great wine producing
countries.
We have always believed Australia could make a
great whisky, too. A proud, individual whisky—as unique
and inimitable as our greatest wines. But in 120 years
we never found such a whisky—until now.
So, for the first time in more than a century of
search and trial, we are offering a smooth, mellow, subtly
blended whisky. One that our great forefathers would
have tasted with approval, so, in their memory we have
ventured to name it Hyland.
To us, this Christmas is rather special; and to you,
too. You can offer this great whisky with pride and
confidence. Hyland is genial, courteous whisky. Clean
to the taste, warming and rewarding as it goes down, it
takes ice without losing flavour. You will enjoy Hyland
—the smooth, individual taste, the gentle warmth beneath
the suave exterior. This Christmas . . . give, receive,
enjoy Hyland.
HYLAND'S unique taste is superb on the rocks or
with soda—and blends perfectly in your favourite festive
drinks.
Thomas Francis Hyland joined the
House of Penfolds in 1862. From 1844
Pen folds grew from one small vineyard
to the undisputed leader of the
Australian wine industry. Hyland whisky
is named for Thomas Francis Hyland.

IN THE RED
The Communists
Turn Capitalist
Uniday Pty. Ltd.
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
L. AARONS
In business
TJooming in as usual, on four wave-
** lengths, Radio Peking came in loud
and clear on the night of November 28
at the time of its daily broadcast to Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. It took a run-
ning jump right into the middle of the
dialectical brawl now splitting the Com-
munist movement in this country and
gave half an hour to what it called “a
reply to the attack and vilification of
Australian Marxist-Leninists by the
Soviet Communist Party.”
The reply was a 6000-word “Declara-
tion of the Australian Marxist-Leninists”
apparently written by pro-Peking Ted
Hill, which claimed that the Soviet leader-
ship had tried to split the parties in Aus-
tralia, Brazil, Belgium, US and other
countries. It stated that the Soviet leader-
ship “had conducted a filthy, unsavoury
campaign to turn the whole Australian
Communist Party into a revisionist mach-
ine by slander, intimidation, dishonesty,
malpractice and manipulation.” With L.
Aarons as its tool, the Soviet leadership,
the broadcast claimed, set out to subvert
or defeat the leadership of Sharkey,
Dixon and Hill by “underhand methods”.
Not that this need worry the victorious
pro-Moscow Communists. While Peking
and Hill rant, the Moscow wing seems
to have become affluent and has even
turned itself into a proprietary company.
To begin with they have purchased
commodious accommodation at 168-174
Day Street, Sydney, a four-storeyed
brick building, previously owned by VRG
Papers Pty Ltd, valued at £52,500 in
April of this year by the Valuer-General,
it is reasonable to assume that the figure
paid by the Party was somewhat higher.
For the ground floor there is planned
a large coffee lounge and dance hall.
There will be ample accommodation for
various Party committees as well as large
meeting rooms for “front” organisations.
This is not the first time that the
Party has owned a large building. Marx
House at the Haymarket was one of it?
investments but under the threat of il-
legality and confiscation of its assets in
1949 the Party sold the building for
much less than it could have got for it
under more propitious circumstances.
But the Party learnt a lot from this ex-
perience and has taken measures to elim-
inate such risks.
The new headquarters is “owned” by
a registered company, Uniday Pty Ltd.
Its managers are listed as Morris John
Rodwell Hughes, secretary, of 11 Sir
Joseph Banks Street, Bankstown, and
Winifred Walsham, secretary, 10 Lindsay
Street, Campsie. M. J. R. Hughes is of
course Jack Hughes, Secretariat member
and ex-Secretary of the Clerks’ Union.
Winifred Walsham is another well-known
Party worker.
Hughes is also listed as a director
along with Robert Jack Barton, builder,
19 Melnotte Avenue, Roseville, and Nor-
man Randolph Freehill, writer, 1 Bungan
Head Road, Newport, who are also well-
known Communists.
The share capital of the company is
to be £90,000 divided into 90,000 £1
shares of which ten are to be “A” class
ordinary shares and 89,990 ordinary
shares. So far 2005 shares have been
allotted. Hughes has one “A” class share
and 1199 ordinary shares. Other holders
of shares are Freehill and Walsham, Amy
Burkitt Tabberer of 38 Carefree Road,
Narrabeen, and Edward Bulmer (Com-
munist ex-Secretary of the BWIU) of
27 Albert Street, Bexley. All these have
one ordinary share each.
The memorandum and articles of the
company, which were drawn up by soli-
citor Rex Mortimer (editor of the Vic-
torian “Guardian”), is a lengthy docu-
ment. In case any one tries a take-over,
it states that “The directors may refuse
to register any transfer of shares at their
absolute discretion,” and in any case a
director reflects, “The Company may by
ordinary resolution remove any director
before the expiration of his period of
office and may by an ordinary resolution
appoint any other person in his stead.”
The “objects for which the company
is established” would doubtless makd“
many of the older revolutionaries turn
in their graves. They include: To sub-
divide land, to purchase land for subdi-
vision and resale, “to purchase or other-
wise acquire merchandise and goods of
every kind and to trade and deal with
the same”; “to carry on business as an
investment company”; “to collect rents
and income”; “to carry on all or any of
the following businesses: builders and
contractors, decorators, dealers in stone,
sand, lime, bricks, timber, hardware and
other building requisites, bricks and tiles,
terracotta makers and house agents.”
(Here one should note that director Bar-
ton is a builder and Bulmer was once
Secretary of the BWIU); “to acquire
patents, patent rights, inventions, copy-
rights, trade marks, secret processes,
technical information, etc.”
Where does all the money come from?
POLITICS
The Honor of Kings Cross
A Matter of Personalities...
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
from Thucydides to C. P.
” Snow have remarked on the over-
riding influence of personalities in poli-
tical affairs. An argument which has
simmered for months in the public
meetings of the Sydney City Council
and raged in the privacy of the Labor
majority’s Caucus meetings before fading
away last week could serve as a paradigm
of the importance of personal rivalries.
What was at stake superficially was the
honor or otherwise of Sydney’s famed
Kings Cross.
The attack on the Cross’ reputation
began in September when Labor aider-
man, Reg Murphy, criticised some of the
nightclubs, striptease shows and fun par-
lors in the area. Some of these “notorious
dives” were breaching Council by-laws
and should be more strictly policed. “I
know we are not guardians of public
morals,” he said, “but these places are
breeding delinquents. Other aldermen
agreed and joined some local residents
in warning of the hooliganism and shady
aspects of the “Cross.”
Then another voice predictably rose
to the defence of Kings Cross that of
Alderman Cornelius Carr Wallace, busi-
nessman and former operator of the
famed “Hasty Tasty” restaurant at the
Cross and Reg Murphy's arch rival in 1

the Council’s Labor Caucus. Claiming
a police report cleared Kings Cross
of the charges, last week “Con” Wallace
announced triumphantly: “The lady’s
bangles are untarnished.” He was ob-
viously referring to Murphy when he said
some aldermen had been conducting an
-“hysterical campaign” on the issue.
By this stage the issue itself had
slipped in importance in the Labor-con-
trolled Council; Kings Cross had become
merely another battleground for the per-
sonal differences of Murphy and Wallace.
These two men have come to serve as
a perfect example of how personal an-
tagonisms can be more important in poli-
tics than differences of views on the
merits of an issue or of Right and Left
wing thinking. Murphy is a Right-winger
and Wallace is further Left, but that is of
less significance than the fact that they
simply dislike one another.
The personal fight appears to have
begun almost as soon as the two were
elected to the Council in 1959. Wallace,
a member of the ALP State Executive,
was a power from the start, but Murphy
worked hard to win friends.. The feud
extended from the Caucus into the ALP
city Labor branches. By 1962 Murphy
had acquired sufficient supporters in
Caucus to rival his opponent’s strength.
Lord Mayor Alderman Harry Jensen
often had to use his casting vote to break
deadlocks. This situation became so
worrisome that Murphy and Wallace
were called before ALP officers.
Then Murphy suffered a heavy blow
when the State Executive moved in last
year and decided the positions on the
ballot paper for ALP aldermanic candi-
dates. This move resulted in the defeat
of some Murphy supporters. Murphy
can now only get three occasional helpers
in Caucus Gil Roper, Tom Foster
and Frank Moran.
When Murphy lost his power, his
supporters said they were resigned to
the fact that everything Murphy had
striven for would be knocked down.
Certainly his elaborate scheme for the
Council to finance and build blocks of
flats for a Council-sponsored co-operative
has virtually been shelved after only one
block in Woollahra has been started.
Murphy has become a lonely figure
in the Labor benches, but his attacks on
his rival in Caucus have become more
vigorous recently, and signs of their
personal differences are becoming more
obvious in public at Council meetings.
Whether strong words will save Murphy
politically from the vengeance of Wallace
will probably not be known until the
State Executive decides his position on
the ballot paper in 1965. And who knows
what issues will be decided by personal
bias in the meantime?
TEENAGERS
The Stomp and the Vote
The Lord Mayor plays tactics
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
growing power of the teenager
especially with council elections less
than five months away—brought aider-
men out of their Christmas-New Year
recess this week to vote on policy on
sound lounges. Last week the Lord
Mayor (Alderman Jones), in what has
become typical tactics on his part, sur-
prised aldermen on both sides by sud-
denly moving for discussion on allow-
ing sound lounges to have dancing on
Sundays without changing the ordin-
ances, provided they operated as clubs
and did not charge admission.
Citizens’ Municipal Organisation
aldermen, while not opposing the Sunday,
stomping, criticised the lack of notice
given for the debate and claimed that
there was doubt of the legality of Aider-
man Jones’ proposal. At time of writing,
some of the Labor aldermen were in-
clined to agree with the CMO, and as
Alderman Jones promised an open
debate, regardless of politics, there was
strong feeling that this week’s council
meeting would provide yet another storm
in what has been one of the stormiest
administrations in the council’s history.
Meanwhile, Queensland Justice
Minister Dr Peter Delamothe is planning
to put before Cabinet a proposal to give
teenagers more legal rights, such as to
make valid wills.
Earlier this month, State Parliament
legislated to allow people of 18 and over
to acquire, hold and deal in land. Dr
Delamothe, who believes that greater
responsibility would be appreciated by
teenagers, pointed out that many people
were married long before they were 21.

Around Melbourne
THE CURSE OF THE YARRADAUGHTERS
T'here are people, I am told, who
A consider that Wagner’s four-part
opera cycle, “The Ring of the Nibe-
lung”, is the silliest story that anyone
has ever invented. How this opinion
stands up against recent best-selling
American novels, and against some
of Melbourne’s TV programmes, I
cannot say. There is, however, one
story, still in the telling, which could
rank with Wagner’s effort. It’s all
about King’s Bridge, and it’s been with
us now for a decade. Voltaire believ-
ed that some things must be sung be-
cause they are too stupid to speak.
If this is true, the King’s Bridge
story should be a musical.
With Wagner in mind for once, it
is tempting to wonder whether there
might not be something like Yarra-
daughters infesting our river. The
Rhinedaughters, you’ll remember,
were a vengeful lot—Woglinde, Well-
gunde, Flosshilde, and all.
Our Yarradaughters live in soup
compared with the environment of
the Rhine. Their collection of tyres,
stolen cars, tins, bottles, bikes, bed-
steads and other junk compared poorly
with the Rhinegold. It is natural to
assume that they are all the more
irascible for that. Their names, like
their tempers, are unimaginable.
Certain it is that, ever since the
early ’fifties —when the brilliant idea
struck our Government that the best
way to move traffic from one bank
of the Yarra to the other would be
to build a new bridge across it—
King's Bridge has been supernaturally
troubled.
How can we now recapture the
scintillating rapture of those early
days when the idea was to put up a
bridge, just an ordinary, pleasant
bridge, for £870,000? Yet if that
naivety had been successful, all would
now be well. The King Street Bridge
would be in use, and so overcrowded
that we could be going through all
the hoops of planning to have another
one.
But, we had to have a Big Bridge.
Just as Alberich lusted for the Golden
Ring, we lusted for a Golden Gate.
And now, before we’re through with
it, it’s going to end up costing us well
over £5,000,000. If there hasn’t
been some feminine Yarradaughter-
type bitchery in this I’ll take a noggin
from the stream right below the
vinegar works at Richmond.
By 1955 the hallucination of a big
bridge, pride of the hemisphere, was
under way. Two years later the Gov-
ernment had to pass a special Act
to slug the Melbourne City Coun-
cil into contributing £1,102,800 to-
wards the estimated cost of nearly
£4,000,000. The MCC wanted to
pay 25 per cent instead of 30 per
cent. The wash-up was that it agreed
to 30 per cent, of course. The Gov-
ernment’s share was set at 65 per
cent, and a faintly protesting South
Melbourne Council agreed to the
other 5 per cent.
That same fateful year of 1957 the
Government awarded a £2,500,000
contract for the design and construc-
tion of the actual bridge to the
American outfit, Utah Australia Ltd.
An Australian company, John Holland
and Co. Pty Ltd, which failed in this
tender, although its price was
£700,000 under Utah’s, now has a
contract worth £534,000 to repair
the bridge which partly fell down
after Utah had put it up.
TWt is to say, Utah and its sub-con-
tractors; for, in the construction,
Utah did only the foundations, sub-
structure and deck. It let out the
rest in sub-contracts. A group of
architects called King Street Bridge
Design Ltd did the design of founda-
tions and superstructures. Johns and
Waygood undertook the fabrication,
painting and erection of the steel
work in the superstructure, including
the detailed shop drawings and weld-
ing procedures. BHP supplied the
plates and bars, in the now famous
high-tensile BS 968 steel.
Then, while the Yarradaughters in
the murk below listened all agog,
Henry Bolte, Premier of Victoria,
drove on to the completed bridge on
April 12, 1961, behind three motor-
cycle cops, and pressed a button which
let off a siren and declared the whole
thing open.
The river girls had to wait more
than a year for their laugh. At 11.15
a.m. on July 10, 1962, Mr Ray Noble
(not the band leader) took his semi-
trailer over Melbourne’s pride. A 33-
yard section at the South Melbourne
end cracked and sagged 18 inches.
Mr Noble reported the matter to a
policeman, who told him not to be
funny.
Since then it’s been on. What a
flurry of X-rays and experts! What
a pudding-mass of statements! What
contradictions and deceptions! Of
course, no public inquiry was necess-
ary, the Premier said, among many
other things that the Premier said.
The result of the Royal Commission
that was later held is history. The
inquiry found that Johns and Way-
good, BHP, the CRB, and Utah were
all to blame in various ways for the
fiasco.
The Premier went on personally to
clear himself and his Government of
all blame, and to declare that the
interests of the taxpayers would be
protected, etc. He organised a long
huddle with the big boys of the big
bridge and has just come up with
his solution. The three companies
involved will hand back £.250,000
of the repair costs —less than half.
The ol’ mug taxpayer will meet the
rest. Some will meet it two ways.
They’ll pay for the bridge as rate-
payers of the City of Melbourne or
Southern Melbourne. Then they’ll
pay again as citizens of the State at
large. Good work, Henry! To be
fair, he was beaten by the threats of
legal complications that the companies
and their lawyers threw at him.
The Country Roads Board, al-
though it has its share of the guilt,
is to pay nothing, which, I suppose,
makes sense as all its money comes
from the Treasury. It is not to hand
back even the £163,000 it received
as a “supervision fee” for the job it
did so badly.
Meanwhile we are reassured, de-
spite the large number of cracks still
believed to be in the bridge, that
after it is repaired it cannot fail again.
We hope not. Yet there is a saying
under the willows which weep so
understandably by the waters of our
stream: “Never under-estimate the
power of a Yarrawoman.”

The Great Council
Christendom can never he the same again
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN in Rome
The General Council of the Church
of Rome has recessed until late
next year. For the patriarchs,
cardinals, archbishops, bishops, abbots,
heads of religious orders, the licensed
experts and the privileged observers
from other churches, it has proved
the end of a punishing term in a school
far from home.
The leaders and the activists have
showed the strain. Few of them are
young men. There has been anger within
the nave of St Peter’s and in committee
rooms buried in the pile of the Vatican.
There has been a certain amount of
parliamentary jiggery - pokery, secular
manoeuvres in a sacred cause.
But there is no mistaking the sense
of achievement with which the Council
Fathers are going home. Christendom
will never be the same again. One of
its great periodical modifications has
been registered.
The session has been marked by an
unexpected honesty and openness. This
is not to suggest that Roman clerics are
naturally dishonest. But they are bound
by traditional reticences, by their mem-
bership of an arcane and professional
society. This time they have been bold,
have stripped some of the ancient and
handsome cloths off the fabric of their
Church and have shown something more
magnificent a humble and laboring
Church.
The end of their work is almost no-
where in sight. Indeed only two con-
stitutional decrees have been com-
pleted and passed by the Council. These
now await promulgation by the authority
of the Pope.
One concerns the liturgy. It allows the
vernacular in the administration of the
Sacraments and in all the public parts
of the Mass. It brings back an almost
Protestant emphasis on the Scriptures
and leaves a wide initiative to local
episcopates with local problems. It rep-
resents a profound change from the
customs of the recent past.
The other is a disappointing essay on
the means of communication. It says
little more than that the mass media
should be used. It avoids the pointed
rocks of censorship and freedom. But
the achievement is far more than the
sum of these two.
Rome has heard the Pope apologise
to the guest observers for any contribu-
tion that his Church has made to the
disunity of Christians. It has heard an
old man’s voice use ponderous words to
denounce the Holy Office, the Church’s
disciplinary body, as a stumbling block
and a scandal. It has heard a cardinal,
a member of the permanent Curia, or
central government of the Church, re-
proved for trying to manipulate the
Council. It has heard that other churches
no longer mere “communities”
have much to teach the Roman Church
and that they, too, are vehicles of God’s
grace.
In a sense the drama of the occasion
has lain in the struggle between the
Fathers and the Curial bureaucracy. This
has been largely resolved and it is the
clear desire of the Council —and of the
Pope—to strip it of its legislative and
policy-making functions and to restore
it as a genuine civil service, to give more
authority to the diocesan bishops: in
effect, to modify the rigidity and central-
isation of the Church. The move has
been led not by young hotheads but by
grave old men, like the Cardinals of
Cologne, Utrecht, Vienna, and by Car-
dinal Bea.
One of the chief effects of the Council
was the maturation of episcopal opinion.
The bishops came as strangers from all
over the world. There was no real
consensus among them. If they had
private views of a strongly reformist
nature, they were private and subject to
censure by a Rome apparently in no
mood for reform. And when they got
here and heard a few unassailable
cardinals speak out —the change began.
The change was clearly seen in the
American hierarchy. They first came to
Rome suspicious, expecting little. At
home they had been suspicious of
novelties and patient of authority. They
did little in the first session. They
listened and felt their way.
When they went home they began
their own dialogue with their own
separated brethren. Something that was
always there had been liberated in them.
They came back to Rome subtly changed.
They are not a monolithic bloc. They
have potent conservatives among them.
But at the second session they began to
assert themselves. They took the initia-
tive in insisting on the inclusion in one
resolution of the right of all men to

religious liberty. In the next session they
may well begin to dominate.
It is true, too, that many bishops
came to Rome believing that ecumenism
was simply a new sort of soft sell for
Catholicism, a new tactic in the search
for converts. Now after debate and
thought it is clear that it is no sell at all,
that it is quite separate from the obliga-
tion to seek converts, that it may even
lower the convert rate. And this is being
accepted, with obvious sincerity, by the
mass of the bishops in the Council.
Even without legislation and definition to
enforce it, it is a development that will
affect all Christendom.
The second session of the General
Council of the Roman Catholic Church
has left no tremendous changes or
surprises in its heavy wake. Its great
work is still to be done. A faint dis-
appointment, a general muddlement, a
longing for something hard that could
be flourished in Christian triumph, these
are probably the general reactions to
the long hours of Latin and theology
and high professionalism.
But General Councils are not a session
of Congress or a sitting of Parliament.
They do not create legislation or make
sudden revolutions. They register what
they believe to be existing truth. And
this Council has begun to register an
astonishing change—a change felt and
foreseen by Pope John.
His portly, enchanting figure still
dominates Rome. This Council was
wholly his creation. He was not a cool
intellectual. He was not a man of pro-
found reflection. His career as a diplo-
mat lacked supreme distinction. But he
was uniquely liberated by the Papal tiara
which so many have found a manacle
binding them to the past.
He was intuitive. He trusted his in-
spirations and his vast capacity for affec-
tion. He set the Council on a course
which roughly coincided with the general
will of Christians. There was no obvious
need for calling such an assembly. And
now. inevitably, the fear arises that with-
out him it will drift back into only too
familiar waters.
T>ope Paul, it is true, is a very different
sort of man. For many years he was
the instrument of Pope Pius XII, whose
policies and views are no longer in
fashion. He was given the awkward role
of following a man whom even the
secular world hailed as a saint and as
the sort of man a Christian ought to be.
There is the nagging suspicion that he
is out of sympathy with the simplicities
and charities of his predecessor’s policy.
And, in the end, the views of a Pope
weigh more heavily than the sum of all
the views of all the Bishops assembled.
But when he was Archbishop of Milan
and just before he was elected to the
Papacy, he preached for the last time in
his cathedral. It was, in a way, a declara-
tion of policy. He said: “John XXIII has
pointed out a path for us and it would be
wise not only to remember but to
follow.” Then he went on: “Can we
deviate from this path opened up by him
with such zeal? No. The tomb cannot
contain his inheritance; death cannot
suffocate the spirit he has infused into
our age.”
In fact, Pope Paul seems the ideal
man to continue the broadly ordained
policy of his predecessor. He is not in-
tuitive, but a man devoted to exactitude
and reflection. He is a brilliant and
tough administrator. And if there is any
doubt of his loyalty to the ideas of Pope
John, there is his gesture, his decision to
make the trip to Jerusalem.
Pope John intended, before rude
death interrupted his plan, to visit the
shrine of Our Lady at Lourdes. That,
within the tradition of the Papacy, was
revolutionary. This is still more import-
ant.
To a Christian, perhaps, his own ex-
planation of wanting to say his prayers
there is sufficient. But it can be loaded
with additional and authentic meaning.
In contradistinction to the pilgrimage to
Lourdes, this is a return to the origins of
Christianity, to the Bible rather than to
the accretions of tradition and experi-
ence. This is one of the great practical
issues before the Council being decided
in favour of the Scriptures.
It is a sweet gesture to “Oriental”
Christians whether they are in union with
Rome or not. Even the Greeks, buried
out of sight in their legitimate historical
grievance, hugging still the pain of the
Fourth Crusade and the cruel sacking of
Byzantium, will find something in this
visit of the Patriarch of the West. And
it is, essentially, the sort of unstuffy
gesture that John made again and again
in his own brief time.
It is part of the enormous opening up
that is going on. The essential, emerging
theme of the Council is precisely this.
The first Vatican Council under Pius IX
in 1870 in a way narrowed the concep-
tion of the Church. It was unfinished,
but it emphasised the activity of God
through the office of the Papacy.
This second Vatican Council has not
denied this. It has extended the idea.
God working through His bishops and
through their share in the magisterium
of the Church, through the laity. And
not only through the Church of Rome,
but through all baptised Christians. And
the gentle suggestion, not only through
Christians but through other religions
until some good can be found in Com-
munism, too. The extraordinary thing
about this assembly is that it has emerged
as so fundamentally Christian, (ofns.)

From London, NEIL KELLY reports:
let a little fresh air into the Church
A wasn't what the late Pope John ex-
pected of the second session of the
Vatican Council. And although much
more might have been done the windows
have certainly been opened wide.
The wind of change that has shaped
the deliberations will be felt in every
Roman Catholic Church of the Latin rite
in the world. For, as a result of the
second session, the vernacular will be
used for most of the Mass and in
administering Sacraments. At Mass the
celebrant will face the people who will
no longer be kneeling spectators but
active participants in the ceremony.
In Britain some Catholics predict a
slow transformation of their churches:
statues will be fewer and “foreign”
ornamentation minimised.
The simplification of the liturgy is the
only concrete reform that has emerged
from the second session. Hopes that
other moves to bring the Church up to
date would succeed in the two months
of debate under the great dome of St
Peter's Basilica were wrecked by the con-
tinuing tension between the conservative
and progressive elements in the Council.
Heading the conservatives has been the
Curia and the Italian bishops. Their
leader is Alfredo, Cardinal Ottaviani,
head of the Holy Office, who believes
that change is a step towards heresy.
The most surprising change to Roman
observers over the two sessions of the
Council has been the attitudes of the
American bishops. Where they were once
written off as conservatives, the first
session saw the emergence of leaders
like Cardinal Cushing of Boston, the late
President Kennedy’s close friend, and
Cardinal Ritter of St Louis. In the
second session their role was more
prominent, reinforced as they were by the
debate and hope that has filled the
American Catholic Press. In the last
session they played a big role in forcing
the possibility of permission for the use
of English in the priest’s private prayers.
The Americans have conservatives like
Cardinal Mclntyre of Los Angeles, the
ex-stockbroker, and Cardinal Spellman,
who vacillates, but their majority voice
is for reform.
Among the Spanish bishops the radical


Catholic stirrings against Franco are
showing some influence. The 200-odd
Italian bishops have always been split
three ways with Genoa’s Cardinal Siri
leading the conservatives and Cardinal
Lercaro of Bologna leading the other
wing. Lercaro has gained more authority
in his key position as one of the Council
moderators, but he still only leads a
minority of about 70 of the Italians.
Tn his first speech to the Council, Pope
Paul seemed determined to break the
stranglehold of the Curia and decentralise
the government of the Church. He in-
vited the bishops to establish effective
and responsible collaboration with him in
ruling the Church.
The Council had to restate the relative
status of the bishops and the Curia. Pope
Paul, as did his predecessor, sees the
bishops as successors of the apostles,
sharing by divine right the supreme
power of the Church with the Pope.
Earlier, Pope Paul had said that he
planned to reform the Curia and would
ensure that the bishops (represented
perhaps by a “Senate” of bishops meet-
ing at intervals in Rome) would assume
their rightful place in the government of
the Church.
It was the question of collegiality and
the rights of bishops as against the ad-
ministrative Holy Office that brought the
most spectacular clash of the second
session between Cardinal Frings, of
Cologne, and Cardinal Ottaviani, secre-
tary of the Holy Office and President
of the Council’s Theological Commission.
Cardinal Frings said bluntly that the
procedures of the Holy Office “are out
of harmony with modern times and a
source of harm to the faithful and of
scandal to those outside the Church”.
In reply, the octagenarian Cardinal
Ottaviani claimed that, because all Holy
Office decisions were approved by the
Pope personally, criticisms of the Holy
Office were a reflection on the Vicar of
Christ. He told the Council Fathers
that the theory of collegiality of the
bishops had no foundation in Scripture
and that it would entail limitations on
the Pope. He accused Cardinal Frings
and his supporters of arguing in a vicious
circle.
With this question unresolved the next
session faces an issue which will be a
final test-case of the strength of the
progressive as against the conservative
elements.
However, Pope Paul did give new
authority to the bishops in a decree issued
towards the end of the session.
It gives back to the bishops many
powers which belong to them by right
but for which they had previously to
apply to Rome. For example, permission
for a priest to offer Mass twice on week-
days and three times on Sundays can
now be given by a bishop without writ-
ten authority from the Vatican. He can
also authorise a priest to celebrate Mass
at any time of the day and to distribute
Communion in the evening.
There were also other minor matters
which are not significant in the way of
major reforms, but in the past were a
source of needless paper work. The in-
tention of Pope Paul in acting on these
administrative matters was clearly to
open the way for a debate on the central
and vital principle of collegiality and to
ensure that the discussion would not be
cluttered up with minor details.
The only other task achieved by the
Council in its second session was a new
decree on mass communications. Many
bishops complained that this dodged the
issue of the Church’s censorship of litera-
ture, films, drama and other art forms
and did no more than state that mass
communications did exist.
At Rome three American Catholic
journalists, including “Time’s” Robert
Kaiser, issued their own Press statement
criticising this Schema as “a classic
example of how the Vatican Council had
failed to come to grips with the world
around it”. In his closing dispatch from
Rome on the Council, Robert Kaiser
was almost bitter about the results of the
second session.
The Session did reveal that the pro-
gressive elements in the Church are in
the ascendant and that the Council,
although hindered by the old guard, is
still following the new course set by Pope
John but not finalised.
This is underlined by some of the sub-
jects tackled by the Council: the ques-
tion of religious liberty, the proposition
that the Jews had no special guilt in
Christ’s death, a call for easier Church
rules on mixed marriages, a move to
give more say to lay members of the
Church.

In Sydney, MATTHEW VAUGHAN
writes:
stress on decentralisation of re-
sponsibility means that the imple-
mentation of the new Constitution on
liturgy, that is the Mass and the Sacra-
ments, will depend on the decisions of
the 36 Australian bishops and the one
Australian abbot in conference some
time next year.
Before the use of English could be-
come a fact of Sunday worship a uni-
form text will have to be agreed upon
and already a committee of nine bishops
from the English-speaking world is pre-
paring a text. Archbishop Young of
Hobart, is vice-president of the com-
mittee and Australian representative.
Although optimists do speak of next
year, the president of the committee,
Archbishop Grimshaw of Birmingham,
said that it might take ten years.
Archbishop Young has always been
something of an innovator in the liturgy
and in Hobart has taken congregation
participation as far as it could go under
the old liturgy rulings and further than
most other Australian bishops have been
willing to go. At the Council, Archbishop
Young has associated himself with the
progressives, assisting Cardinal Suenens
in acting as a “whip” among the English-
speaking bishops.
Some reports in the Australian Catho-
lic Press have tended to lay stress on
caution in changes and the Irish-born
Coadjutor Bishop of Perth, Bishop Mc-
Keon, on his return from the Council,
which he left early, said that any changes
would have to obtain a two-thirds major-
ity of the Australian bishops.
Bishop McKeon suggested that Eng-
lish would be used for the Epistle and the
Gospel and the opening Psalm of the
Mass, rather less than proposed in the
Council reforms. The argument being
put forward against too extensive a
change is that the Council decision was
designed for missionary countries and
special circumstances which do not apply
to an established Church such as exists
in Australia.
The Australian conference of bishops
will inevitably go the way that Cardinal
Gilroy and his close personal friend, the
new Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr
Simonds, decided it should. Even if
Archbishop Young decided that their
approach was too cautious and set him-
self against them he would not gain
enough support to get his way.
/“Inly four Australian bishops spoke at
the second session of the Council,
Cardinal Gilroy, Bishop Cahill of Cairns,
Bishop Goody of Bunbury, WA, and
Bishop Muldoon, one of the coadjutor
bishops of Sydney.
Bishop Muldoon, popularly known as
“Bull,” partly due to his bulky physique
and partly to his hearty no-nonsense
manner, aligned himself unequivocally
with his conservative Roman friends in
a tart comment that “we should not
fall down on our knees and confess the
sins of our forefathers” just to promote
Christian unity.
Until a few years ago a Theology
Professor at St Patrick’s College, Manly,
Bishop Muldoon is scornful of the “new”

theologians of France and Germany. He
himself published a text on theology in
Rome a few years ago which has been
praised by the conservative Roman theo-
logians. In another speech at the last
Council session Bishop Muldoon at-
tacked a Schema on the role of the laity,
inspired by the French and German
bishops, as bad theology.
His intervention in the Christian unity
debate brought a rebuke from Dom
Butler, Superior-General of the English
Benedictines and reputedly on the
short list for the recently filled See of
Westminster who asked whether the
history of the 16th century had yet
reached Australia.
Bishop Goody of Bunbury told the
Council that “although the Catholic mi-
nority in Australia has notably increased
in the last few years it has had little
social or religious influence on the life
of the nation”.
Although Archbishop Young has
openly aligned himself with the pro-
gressive forces at the Council the major-
ity of the Australian bishops are cautious
in temper, influenced by their Irish train-
ing or, among the Australian-born, by
their post-graduate studies at Rome.
At one of the first meetings of bishops
Cardinal Gilroy warned against possible
dangerous views from across the Alps,
adopting the Roman tag against the
Germans and French and recalled that
Luther came from Germany. This is
said to have brought the remark from
Bishop Jobst of the Kimberleys, German-
born and a firm progressive, that after
all the Anglo-Saxons had not been models
of loyalty to the Church.
Tt is this innate conservatism and isola-
tion from Europe combined with a
lack of editorial initiative in the Catholic
Press which has led to a relatively poor
cover of the Council in progress.
Certainly in Australia the Council has
not inspired the sort of discussion and
ferment evidenced in the American
Catholic Press or in that of Europe. The
only controversy touched off in the
Catholic Press in Australia has been a
one-sided running attack by Dr Rumble,
of Radio Replies fame, on Father Hans
Rung, a famous German theological
adviser to the Council. Dr Rumble re-
gards Father Kung as dangerous and
reckless and drew attention to his rela-
tively youthful age, Hans Kung being in
his thirties.
But even if the Australian Church has
failed dismally to impart to its faithful
some of the wonder and fervor that the
Council’s deliberations sparked in
America and in Europe as well as in
Africa and South America, the coming
changes in the Mass and in the Sacra-
ments will bring Australian Catholics
face to face with new realities and new
demands.

Portrait
Of Duke
With Dodo
Spare a thought for the
noisy scrub bird
By JAN SMITH
Profess a world-weary shrug for the
Duke of Bedford if you like, but
you have to admit he’s versatile.
Just when everybody knew about the
nudists and the bingo at Woburn Abbey
and travelling art exhibitions, he’s come
up with another tack. This year it’s
animals, and among all the talk about
bridled nail tailed wallabies and lead-
beater possums, the Duke takes on a new
personality.
He is a tall man who seems mild-
mannered to the point of shyness before
you catch the entertaining eyes behind
the round, pale-rimmed spectacles. The
Duke keeps an intricate feudal set-up
of village, forest, animal and market-
garden managers to see the Woburn
estates (some 18,000 acres plus 3000-
acre park) run smoothly while he does
a little publicising himself for the Wild
Life Fund and its magazine “Animals,”
of which he is an associate editor.
The Duke had hoped his second trip to
Australia, like his first in 1962, would
be with Woburn art treasures, consisting
mainly of 29 paintings worth more than
half a million which were seen by an esti-
mated 160,000 in four capital cities.
But this time Lord Ampthill, one of the
four trustees, refused to let the paintings
leave Woburn. “He didn’t even give a
reason,” the Duke said, “and half the
fun of paintings is showing them to
other people.”
In vain the Duke pleaded that the
paintings had suffered no damage, be-
yond a slightly chipped frame, “which
could have happened quite easily at
Woburn with all those people walking
about.” The trustee was adamant, so the
Duke threw himself in to the World
Wildlife Fund’s campaign for natural
reserves for wild animals. This time,
instead of Woburn and Canalettos, he
is talking knowledgeably about people
who shoot polar bears in Canada from
planes, oryx from jeeps in Persia (both
illegally and unnecessarily), and the 1926
decimation of the koala for cheap fur
gloves.
"I think people realise Prince Philip’s
shooting is not incompatible with his
patronage of the Wild Life Fund,” the
Duke said. ‘'After all, he only shoots the
more prolific breeds.” A fine distinction
which probably escapes the more dedi-
cated of the animal lovers toward whom
“Animals” (3s. weekly) is slanted.
“Animals” magazine, an illustrated
glossy which numbers among its editors
Armand Denis, Gerald Durrell and
Peter Scott, was launched two years ago
and sells in England, America, Canada
and Europe. It carries no advertising,
but Brooke Bond Tea (not available here)
helps the fund by sponsoring a series of
sixpenny animal-card books for children.
The Duke’s concern for wildlife
preservation is no nine-day wonder. The
Russells have had animals around and
inside their houses since Francis, the
fifth Duke, established a model dairy at
Woburn in 1793, and the walled park
now contains hundreds of animals,
notably the Pere David deer, two herds
of bison, the Prejevalsky ponies from
Mongolia, and some rare cranes and
wallabies.
The Duke has been having some
trouble lately with the Polish-Russian
bison, who have shown a reluctance to
breed to schedule. After losing one in
transit from Russia, another sire was
landed safely and is competing vigorously
with the more prolific Canadian bison.
“We never have any danger of being
overstocked,” the Duke said, “because
someone is always willing to buy them
for parks and zoos. Unfortunately there’s
not much money in bisons.”

As a symbol of their cause, the Duke
and Duchess travelled to Australia with
a three-foot-high fibreglass Mauritius
dodo, extinct 150 years, which on the
morning I met the Duke was roosting on
a dining-room table at their hotel suite.
A handsome bird, run up by naturalist
Peter Scott, it had suffered the indignity
of having a hardboiled egg placed under
it by a frisky passenger on its last Sydney-
to-Melbourne flight.
The dodo was standing guard over
some autographed copies of the Duke’s
book, “A Silver - Plated Spoon”, on
which he had been doing some signatory
homework. First published in 1959 and
now available in paperback, it goes about
as far as a frank autobiography can go,
stopping just short of the third Duchess,
who was then film producer Nicole
Millinaire.
The Duchess talked about the Duke’s
tribulations in one of Sydney’s bigger
bookstores. “Behind a little screen, as
though they were ashamed of him. And
five big directors stand in front of him,
like this . . .” She had autographer’s
callouses on one hand, and since her last
visit has grown her hair into a topknot.
She is at mild loggerheads with the
Press after being billed by a local
woman’s magazine as a horticultural
expert. “You cannot imagine the shock
of being confronted, in the middle of a
city street, with a poster for the Duchess
of Bedford’s Guide to Bulb Growing,”
she said testily.
However, she rose to the occasion,
swotted up the intricacies of mulching
and sprouting, and has been able to cope
fairly well with the profusion of letters
since received. Beside the Duchess’s
dilemma, the Duke’s parentage of a
cookery suplement was a mere trifle.
“I will admit you don't make bad
scrambled eggs,” the Duchess conceded,
“but I am the one who does the cooking,
you understand.”
T'he Duchess softened on learning that
at least one reader had tried her
boeuf bourguignon, and gave a detailed
account of her adventures with a bouilla-
baisse at Palm Beach the previous week-
end, using the tails and heads of the
luncheon lobster. “It’s quite all right to
use prawn shells for the stock,” the
Duchess said, “but at the end you must
use the best fish available”.
Rare fish don’t figure largely in the
wildlife brochures apparently they
are prolific enough to take care of them-
selves but the Duke is concerned
greatly with the future of the noisy scrub
bird, which is holding out bravely in the
bush around Two People Bay, Western
Australia. “I believe the residents were
so concerned for the birds that they
actually re-positioned a housing develop-
ment to save their nests,” the Duke said,
marvelling at what sounds, for Australian
builders, like unprecedented soft-hearted-
ness.
The Tasmanian wolf is also in danger
of extinction, but no one has been smart
enough to have the Duke lead an ex-
pedition to find a few more, or to track
down the panthers and moonlight mon-
sters who are periodically sighted in
northern New South Wales.
In the campaign for wild life preserva-
tion, the Duke and Duchess are aware of
the enormous task before them in
educating the public, and even at
Woburn there seems room for some re-
thinking. “I shall never forget once
instructing the gardener about where to
put some delphiniums,” the Duchess said.
“He told me they couldn't go under my
bedroom window, facing the park, be-
cause the vermin would eat them. It
took me some minutes to realise he was
talking about the Pere David deer.”

A prominent figure in the trade re-
cently complained of the euphemistic
naming of wine. “Coy” and “assertive”
were two adjectives that particularly
appalled him. He need not have stopped
there. I have always been intrigued by
“an honest wine,” with visions of a Hun-
ter Red chopping down a cherry tree. A
“patrician” wine obviously must have a
very long nose, but what the devil is an
“arrogant” wine? Then we have the gen-
der wines, “this has a certain amount of
masculinity that I find quite appealing”
or “a delicious, delicate, feminine qual-
ity.” An “insistent” wine is easy; it just
keeps asking you to have another glass.
But what is a “domestic” wine, one of
which you save half a glass for the tiles,
to make them whiter, brighter than ever
before? How would one define an “inti-
mate” wine? . . . er, oh yes, of course,
obviously the masculine and feminine
wines have got together.
I have been reading a book about
English Wines. Don’t scoff, for they have
a long history. The Venerable Bede in
the eighth Century noted in his inimi-
table way, “vineas quibiscum in locis
germinans,” which, liberally translated,
means “We visited a Winery and had a
few.” In the laws of Alfred and Edgar
in the ninth and tenth centuries, vine-
yards are again mentioned and after that
the increasing literary output speaks of
the increase of local viticulture.
Then in the twelfth century, Henri
Plantagenet, Duke of Anjou, Normandy
and Aquitaine, accepted the future crown
in a masterstroke of promotional mer-
chandising, and in 1154, on the death of
Stephen, he became Henry II of Eng-
land and brought the Bordeaux with him.
This was a shattering blow to English
vineyards.
After this, the local makers turned to
more regional items to produce their re-
quirements, and we read of Balm Wine,
Cowslip Wine, Parsnip, Sage and Rose
Wine. There was Scurvy Grass Wine and
Elderberry Wine (Very Good), Treacle
Wine and the Countess of Newport’s
Cherry Wine. But all is not lost; towards
the end of the book, one of the most
recent recipes is headed in such a way to
send ominous shivers down the backs of
the famous growers of Bordeaux and the
Bourgogne. It says . . . HOW TO MAKE
GRAPE WINE.

Authentic statements made in the last
year at a prominent restaurant:
. . . you recommend Lindemans Bin
1760 Riesling? Don’t give me any of
that!!!! I'm a publican and know they
weren’t making wines then.”
“ . . . and don't forget to bring me a
bottle of the Chateau Briant.”
also
A wine-lover, on being told that the
Cotes Du Rhone produced Red, White
and Rose wines . . . “Hmm, obviously
a Cote of many colors.”
And the wine rep who insisted all his
wines were crystal clear because, “you
can’t mix sediment with business.”
★ ★ ★
Good half bottles are becoming harder
to find. It appears that the major com-
panies will no longer be bottling any bin
wines in the smaller size, for they haven’t
enough to go around as it is; and any-
way, the halves are harder to sell.
Selfishly, I think this is a pity, for often
when only the two of us dine, I would
rather drink two different halves than one
large bottle, and they are also a very
good size for supper. Occasionally you
will find caches of halves where the large
bottle has long since gone, so gather
them while ye may, you shall not see
their like again.
★ ★ ★
The time has come to review the wine
portfolio. Last year I wrote of the case
of "53 Mouton Rothschild which doubled
in value in two and a half years to a
retail figure of £75. Further spectacular
gains were evident this year, due no
doubt to the stability of Government
and the increasing thirst. The ’53 is now
offered for a cost price of .400 s. plus
tax, or about £9 a bottle retail. So my
case has appreciated by £33, or a gain
of 44 per cent. This, however, is not
the complete annual report, since a bonus
issue was made when my first child was
born in March, and a further 1 for 1
issue was completed last month when a
friend brought over a bottle of ’53
Lafite to compare. So I shall sit on my
book profits of £l5. And how could
one celebrate these better than by open-
ing a bottle of ’53 Mouton?

The Wine Industry proclaims, LIFE
IS MORE PLEASANT WITH WINE,
and it undoubtedly is. But Robert Her-
rick put it better 300 years ago, and I
leave you with his words:
Drink wine, and live here blithefull,
while ye may;
The morrowes life too late is, live
today.
Merry Christmas!


SPORT
Wanted: A Large Slice of Luck
Problems in Adelaide and Melbourne
By DISCUS
While most of us brave the savage
transistor, the wild mosquito and
the cold plum pud in a search for
leisure pleasure over the holidays, 16 vali-
ant Australians will be fighting something
of a last ditch battle for the reputations of
two sports. They will be defending the
Davis Cup in Adelaide and the Ashes
in Melbourne, and at both places luck
will need to be with them.
The tennis comes first, at Memorial
Drive Courts after Christmas, and on
form shown in the State titles it is very
likely that the Americans will take the
Cup home with them. Both Fraser and
Emerson are out of form, and if the
newer members of the team become
champions overnight it will be most
surprising, because they have been
around long enough to have succeeded
before this.
So the seeds of decline are already
planted and the thorn bush is ready to
break ground in Adelaide. Some one
may do a Drobny and surprise us all.
Otherwise the Cup may never return
here. Mr Hopman and others remain op-
timistic about the young players coming
up, but Frank Sedgman could see no
potential champions among the boys he
coached during his annual trip to Bris-
bane this year, and it is the first time.
The girls had all the promise.
Tennis is one of the few sports which
accepts, encourages and even makes
heroes of women players. And the LTAA
will have reason to be thankful for it if
we lose the Cup and fail to develop any
more Wimbledon champions for a while,
and if the same LTAA persists in its
opposition to open tennis.
If we lose the matches in Adelaide
there will be the usual reappraisal, and
stronger calls for open tennis tourna-
ments. However, it may even be too
late for that. The golden age of pro-
fessional tennis has passed, many of the
originals are becoming silvery on top,
and very few new players have been re-
cruited. Australia has the largest group
among the circuit professionals and could
dominate an open Wimbledon with them
for two or three years, but then . . . ?
Then things would become much as they
are now in amateur tennis. Few exciting
young players are appearing.
Among the reasons would be a gradual
reduction in the number of courts avail-
able. Once it was the thing to have a
home with a tennis court but swimming
pools are more popular now, and land
values are also against home courts.
Councils spend money on swimming
centres for everyone, not hardcourts for
a few. Even the NSW Lawn Tennis As-
sociation is reducing its land area at
White City.
To give tennis a future it may be
necessary for the State associations to
establish new lawn tennis areas of cham-
pionship standard on the city outskirts,
with a ring of subsidiary courts. That is
where the young potential players live
now, and it is also where parking can
be made available for thousands of cars,
a necessity for sports willing to con-
tinue to draw large galleries.
Such a development would require
money. That might be obtained by sel-
ling and moving headquarters, or by de-
veloping Milton, White City, Kooyong.
It might also be found among the pro-
fessionals, but each year they would be
less interested.
There is another aspect. The outer
wastelands of the bigger cities need large
centres where youth can use its muscles,
days or nights. Lighted courts would be
valuable. Not everyone wants to stomp
or go bowling, but the alternatives are
limited. Sporting associations could not
promote new centres individually, but in
concert they could make a very good
case for subsidies, and advance their own
interests.
If the idea of day and night sports
centres with pool, gymnasium and venues
for several sports appears to have little
to do with the game of tennis, perhaps
we could hear Frank Sedgman on the
subject. Tennis players, he said recently,
are the worst prepared in general exer-
cise and physical training.
That reason alone is enough to fore-
shadow a rapid end to Australia’s big
tennis in an age of constant developments
in training methods. If you compare the
intensive preparation our swimmers will
have, just to retain their secondary po-
sition in world swimming, the lack of
training, lack of form, and frequent
breakdowns of the tennis stars spell out
the message. The chance of anyone “do-
ing a Drobny” in Adelaide are dim-
inished by the thought that Drob won
Wimbledon at a grandfatherly age be-
cause he was the fittest man there.
Today, tennis has one advantage. Its
spectators are used to high admission
prices. In Adelaide about 7000 people
will pay more to see the Davis Cup than
five times the number would pay to
watch a deciding Test. But if the 7000
happen to be seeing the last Cup play
in Australia for a longish time, then the
numbers of spectators tennis can attract
will become important. And then we
will see some changes made.
Big “gates” are vital to cricket, and
during the coming holidays this may be
the hinge the sports future will turn on.
The strange events which opened the
season had some obvious results in Bris-
bane, where a vast crowd of 3000
watched the First Test on each of the
two final days, with an overall attendance
of 22,000 for the whole affair. The spec-
tators made some cricket history by
booing an umpire and chairing lan
Meckiff from the oval.
None of this seems to have reached
the upper strata of cricket control, where
I presume the sympathy is with the
English cricket writers who declared that
the purity of bowling must be preserved.
The procedures and theories of cricket
must be unimpaired, and if a First Test
batsman puddles along for four hours
to make 66 runs, that is cricket, sir. We
cannot have a blasted “chucker” allowed
to come on at umpire Egar’s end and
throw boomerangs at him.
To a public which no longer plays
and watches cricket with any general

ardor, which regards cricket as just a
sport, worth watching if it’s good, not
worth the 4s. if it’s dull, the correctness
of stonewalling and the incorrectness of
“suspect” bowling is a paradox which
demands explanation. The so-called
“chucking” is streets away from a base-
ball pitch. It includes elbow bending and
wrist'action at the moment of delivery,
but it is still very much overarm bowling.
It is not “chucking” in the public mind.
It is very hard to see what is wrong with
it, and especially when a bowler’s arm
formation seems to make him unable to
bowl effectively the “correct” way.
The real effects of the Meckiff affair
will not be visible until New Year’s Day
when the Second Test begins in Mel-
bourne. Then the “gate” will tell the
story, and after the first day it may be
a very gloomy one for cricket. If so,
you can bet it will not be improved in
Sydney ten days later when the Third
Test starts.
Tt is impossible to believe that any part
of the Brisbane happenings was either
planned or foreseen. But it is possible
to believe that the selectors found Aus-
tralia without a new, great fast bowler,
and felt they had to gamble. If so, they
have lost, and cricket has lost.
The “chucking” brawl seems to be part
of a wide theorising in cricket, here and
in England, that the bowlers must be
restrained to keep the game even and
interesting. Most of the moves in rules
alteration are framed against bowlers,
perhaps in the hope of shaking loose the
hardshell batsmen who cover up the
moment they or the team is threatened.
This has two disadvantages. One, much
overlooked, is that spectators come to
see play, batsmen who bat and bowlers
who bowl well. If the bowlers break
through and the batting collapses, that is
fine in the Outer. The spectators do not
attend only to see expert batting. They
know how little of that to expect. If
one batsman plays an innings such as
Lawry’s in Brisbane, it is a bonus.
“Chucking” is no danger to cricket,
the cricket which exists because 50,000
people will pay to see a Test. The
danger to that side of cricket lies in
stonewalling, the “Slasher” Mackay and
Waite kind of “knock” which wins the
approval of cricket tacticians, but kills
the spectators. To end or relieve this by
"Oh, all right. This week YOU export and I'LL import."
restraining the bowlers seems an odd
way to go about it, but is typical of
cricket elders’ approach. The restraint
can be introduced gradually, almost un-
noticed. To come right out and alter the
rule so that scoring below a certain rate
would put the batsman out is apparently
unthinkable.
It may be thinkable, however, after
Melbourne and Sydney, if the Second
and Third Test crowds indicate their
current feelings about the game by stay-
ing away, proving that the Brisbane re-
action was not a phenomenon, arising
from the Meckiff affair alone. It may
too easily have been a visible protest
against all that is going wrong in cricket,
from the suffering spectator’s side of
the fence, and an extension of the beer-
can throwing which marked one Test
during the England tour. It was perhaps
not umpire Egar who was booed, but
the stuffiness of cricket.
This is likely to be a bad season for
a further reason. The South African team
is not a very strong one. It is capable
of rising to an occasion, but over Five
Tests its basic weakness will show up,
all the more quickly if Connolly or some
other new bowler breaks out in a rash
of greatness, or if several of our bats-
men strike form at the same time. The
South Africans are the wrong team to
have here, for so long, at a crucial time.
Earlier this year I suggested shorter
tours by more touring teams. The Rugby
Union, poor as it is, was thinking of a
world series in Australia, similar to
Rugby League’s. Cricket is not poor,
yet. It could afford to lose money to
keep the game truly alive. Unfortunately
it is very much England-Australia
orientated, with those original Ashes al-
ways the goal. It may even be time, as
many people have already suggested,
to scatter the Ashes and promote a
wider competition. Such as the Davis
Cup. Cricket is no longer an Empire
game, but it retains too much of Empire
rules based on Empire thinking.
The term “chucker” reeks of that.
It is caddish and not cricket to “chuck”.
It is fair and fine to bat at the rate of
16 runs an hour, to pack fields around
weak batsmen, and for bowlers to take
ages to deliver one ball. Nothing against
those in the rules.
I am guessing, but it’s my guess that
the next few weeks will have a great
effect on the future of cricket, one way
or another, depending on the spectators’
actions, and the cricket administrators’
ability to read the lesson.


Australian Premiers -3
" Slippery Sam”
Or a Judicial Mind?
By M. H. ELLIS
An enigma about the history of the
Commonwealth is the manner in
which the name of Sir Samuel
Griffith has sunk out of public memory,
while lessei. it more flamboyant, charac-
ters have retained their places in the
Australian hall of memory.
In part, this was due to the nature of
the man. He did not make friends easily.
He was regarded even by his intimates
with more respect than affection. He
has achieved in the legend of politics
the reputation of a man who was some-
times vacillating, weak and given to
changing his mind in major crises;
though, in plain fact, from what I saw of
him in his later years, one would judge
that this habit, which so infuriated some
of his associates and earned him the
name of “Slippery Sam” among his
enemies, was due to the possession of a
judicial mind always ready to absorb
reason. If, through argument, he was
persuaded that he was wrong, he changed
his mind without a qualm.
Samuel Walker Griffith was born in
Merthyr Tydvil, in Wales, on June 21,
1845, and was brought by his family at
the age of nine to what was to become
Queensland—five years before its separa-
tion from New South Wales. The
family moved from their first home
in Ipswich to Maitland, then a lively
town, full of aspiring literary gentry who
created a culture of their own, including
their own folk ballads; a large and
livelier town than Newcastle, and the
funnel through which all the traffic of
the Northern road passed into the New
England and the North. But he was not
there very long they sent him firstly
to Robert Horniman’s School at 220
Goulburn Street, Sydney, half-way be-
tween Castlereagh and Elizabeth Streets,
and lastly to the West Maitland High
School ruled by the Reverend W. Mc-
Intyre, under whom he matriculated in
1860 the year in which his parents
found their final resting place in Bris-
bane. He had reached the mature age
of 15 —the same age, he used to say, at
which Cardinal Wolsey matriculated.
At the university in the company of
men who compensated for their paucity
in numbers by their brilliance, he be-
came a Bachelor of Arts at 18, with
honors in classics, mathematics and the
natural sciences. He was immediately
articled in Brisbane to Arthur Macalister,
who had immigrated from Glasgow and
had been MiriTster for Lands and Works
in the first Queensland Ministry under
responsible government. Also—briefly
—the colony’s second Premier and,
after a kaleidoscopic career, Speaker and
Premier again in 1874. By that time his
erstwhile articled clerk had had the
benefits of foreign travel by favor of the
T. S. Mort travelling scholarship, and
had found a permanent cultural love
through a sojourn in Italy. He had been
called to the Queensland Bar in 1867
and had won the East Moreton seat in
the Assembly in 1871 at the age of 26.
Low’s Chief Justice Griffith
It was an era of young men.
Macalister made him Attorney-
General, at 29, after he already had
shown his especial talent by drafting an
Insolvency Act aimed to end a popular
colonial pastime in the North.
He signalised his promotion to Cabinet
rank by bringing down and passing a
Bill to provide for free, secular and com-
pulsory education and became the
colony’s first Minister for Public In-
struction. He thus, at 30, was the father
of the State Education system in Queens-
land, having already begun the fight for
establishment of a Queensland university
which did not end until William Kid-
ston established the university in 1909.
(Griffith, I think, was the original
founder of the University Equipment
Fund Committee to which the writer of
this article was one of the last batch of
three members elected.) His first specific
plan for a university was put forward
in 1877, and he would possibly have
achieved some results had not the
political position at that stage become
very unstable.
Macalister apparently found two such
ambitious and contending aspirants as
Griffith and Thomas Mcllwraith in one
ministry too much for his peace of mind
—it must have been somewhat like living
in a cottage with Governor Bligh and
John Macarthur. So he took the Agent-
Generalship in London in 1876, his
flight being followed by the creation of
two lightning-flash ministries headed by
George Thorn, the founder of Ipswich,
and John Douglas, later the Special
Commissioner who was grimly holding
on to New Guinea when British
sovereignty in the large island was pro-
claimed. Griffith sat in both Cabinets.
When this unstable period ended three
years later, Mcllwraith was Premier, a
comparative veteran of 44, and Griffith,
at 34, had become a vigorous Opposition
leader with the pioneer Judicature Act
and Local Government Act added to his
score. He went after Mcllwraith’s
scalp.
It took him four years to collect the
trophy; at last he became Premier before
he was 40.
There followed five years of legisla-
ting as busy as any colony had ever seen.
He passed the first Land Act of im-
portance, the Licensing Act which intro-
duced local option, the first Queensland
Defence Act, the codification of the
powers of Justices, the very modern and
much opposed Offenders’ Probation Act
revolutionary in its day. All these
products of his four years or so of
office were, however, dwarfed by his
work in other fields.
He crusaded against Chinese immigra-
tion and cheap kanaka labor in the
North and, on the findings of a Royal
Commission, he killed the worst evils of
blackbirding which resembled, in all its
evil essentials, the slave trade of the
eighteenth century, and restricted Asiatic
immigration.
Secondly, came his entry into the field
of Federation. He had begun to sponsor
it in 1880 with all its nuances and com-
plications connected with his proposed
plan for a provincial division of
Queensland into a Federated entity, with
its own Senate and House of Representa-
tives, as part of a Federated Australia.
(The echo of these proposals is to be
found in Section 7 of the Constitution
which provides that the Common-
wealth may make laws dividing the

State of Queensland into divisions and
determining the number of senators to
be chosen from each division.)
His views and behavior on the
division were less fixed and stable than
they were on the main issue. He never
wavered in his promotion of National
Federation for Australia, nor was his
mind ever clouded or cloudy about the
precise legislative expression of the in-
stitution of Federation.
He drafted the Federated Council of
Australasia Bill in essence as it passed
the Imperial Parliament in 1885, having
two years earlier carried at an inter-
colonial conference the proposal to form
the Council. He was the clear-thinking,
driving-force of the Council over which
he presided at its meetings of 1888, 1891
and 1893. He was (with Sir James
Garrick) Queensland’s delegate to the
Colonial Conference of 1887 in London
at which the young Deakin so greatly
distinguished himself. He drafted and
moved the resolution which the Con-
ference passed plumping for preferential
treatment of British products throughout
the Empire.
Yet it was strange that his return was
marked by defeat, another series of
political storms in which Premierships
changed hands with acrobatic rapidity,
with now Mcllwraith, now B. D. More-
head, now Griffith on the bars. Mc-
llwraith performed the most dexterous
lightning changes of attitude, and showed
a refreshing readiness to accept from
the Opposition or at least from
Griffith —pieces of legislation remark-
able in their times.
Most of Griffith’s legislative drafting
was derivative, but judiciously so; and it
was no doubt acceptable to his presently-
ruling adversaries because he was with-
out any question from anybody, not only
the dominating figure at the Queensland
Bar, but in the profession of the law as
a . whole: a remarkable position in that
he had been admitted locally and all
local products, human or otherwise, were
apt to be looked on in that age as rather
inferior especially when the product
happened to be not only human but
unpopular for various reasons.
There were local patriots like the stout
George Curtis who anathematised him
because he preferred his Federated pro-
vincial system for the colony to their
separatist plans of new States. There
were sedate capitalists who felt that
behind that beard and keen eyes there
must be another Marx dwelling in a man
who had actually had the temerity
to put forward (unsuccessfully, thanks to
the Legislative Council), an Eight Hour
Day Bill, and one designed to declare as
a fundamental principle in relation to
private property that the products of
labor - including the possession of pro-
perty to which labor was applied
whether of mind or body, belonged by
natural right to those who have contribu-
ted to its production; this in proportion
to the value and extent of the happy
laborers’ contributions to the result. It
was one of the few measures that its
author waxed emotional about, contend-
ing that either it must be passed or
Queensland must be branded as having
adopted the code of the jungle:
The good old rule, the simple plan
That they may take who have the
power
And they may keep who can.
Nobody took him as seriously as he
took his subject, especially since, like
Gladstone, he “talked shop like the tenth
muse” when idealistically stirred. There
was a general, and I think unjust, suspi-
cion that he was merely pandering to
hoi polloi with these essays. The mea-
sure did not go through, but he did suc-
ceed in putting on the Statute Book from
the Opposition benches an Act the noisy
echoes of which were heard in New
South Wales only a year or two ago.
When the New South Wales Govern-
ment recently introduced its Bill to
amend the Defamation Act, the anguished
cries of many an academic historian
were heard proclaiming that if a clause
penalising the defamation of ancestral
dead became law, the writing of history
would become a doomed art. The
loudly protesting gentlemen were all un-
aware that this clause, so supposedly
lethal to their freedom of expression,
had been law in Queensland since
Griffith’s codification of the Libel Law
adopted in 1889 and to bring the
laugh against them to a crescendo
that Griffith, with his bower-bird habit,
had taken it bodily out of Macaulay’s
Indian civil code, Macaulay having been
an historian whom none of the critics
was likely to rival.
However, all this was but a shadowy
backdrop to his play upon the stage of
Federation. Having lain down (though
not as a lamb) with the Scottish lion
Mcllwraith in a coalition which was
largely made possible by the identity


of their views on the Federal national
principle, the busy Welshman was seen
dominating the Intercolonial Federal
Conference of 1890 with the clarity of
his mind and the sane practicality of his
approach to the question.
And at the first great Federal Con-
vention of 1891, he sat as vice-chairman
to the aged Henry Parkes’ presidency.
In modern parlance, he virtually “stole
the show” from the giants of the South.
His diction and method were obvious
in the resolutions which the aged Parkes
submitted at the outset, and, after Parkes
had failed to bring them to life, it was
Griffith who (in Deakin's words)
“brought the delegates at once face to
face with the issues by which they were
to be divided”.
Playford, Adye Douglas of Tasmania,
B. R. Wise, Barton, Kingston, Inglis
Clark, the able legislative draftsman
from Tasmania, Sir George Grey, all
hammered at the meat of the resolutions.
But though (again it is Deakin who
writes) “the simple and sometimes
stately general language of Sir Samuel
Griffith’s Bill ultimately was replaced
by more elaborate and technical phrase-
ology in order to render the intention
more precise, as a whole and in every
clause the measure as at first adopted
was Griffith’s.” The combined wisdom of
the Convention eventually had been re-
mitted to a drafting committee which
went into retreat on the Hawkesbury in
the Queensland Government’s Lucinda.
Though a chosen company put its finger
into the pie as it was created and baked,
the Bill which was eventually adjudged
by Deakin as the memorial to the Con-
vention and which represented the dis-
tillation of its labors was “in style and
spirit far more the creation of Griffith
and far more nearly expressed his own
ideal than that of Parkes or any other
member.”
“Insight and lucidity”
“Tts substance”, wrote Deakin, “would
have remained much the same in
almost any event but not only was the
form it assumed his, but by his insight in
the first instance and his lucidity after-
wards, he saved his fellow members much
time, and much fruitless discussion. . . .
At its (the Convention’s) close Griffith's
influence had become supreme, for his
inveterate attitude conciliated the mem-
bers from the less populous colonies,
while his abilities and zeal for Union
won the respect of the whole body”.
His manner, Deakin said, “gave no
assurance except of self-confident calm
and well-informed capacity to deal with
the problems in an impartial manner, but
his work was eloquent more than supply-
ing any want of charm. No other repre-
sentative rivalled him”.
Yet a prophet has no honor in his own
colony. The hero of the Convention
went back to Queensland with an enor-
mous reputation among statesmen and
jurists, only to be aspersed for a sudden
volte face on the Polynesian labor
question on which the findings of the
Royal Commission, which he had set up
in 1885, had included an indictment of
the “cruelty, treachery, kidnapping and
cold-blooded murder” practised by the
blackbirders. His Polynesian Laborers’
Act, passed at the end of 1890, before
the Federal Convention, prohibited the
issue of further recruiting licences and
had the full support of the electors in
general, especially of Labor.
However, the resistance of the northern
sugar farmers and those dependent on
the sugar industry, which languished
almost to the point of immolation,
generated a cry for the complete separa-
tion from Queensland of the sugar-
growing north.
A majority in a commission on the
condition of the industry then agreed that
if kanaka labor were withdrawn the in-
dustry must perish, so that Griffith and
Mcllwraith, between two fires, virtually
extinguished the prohibition Act amid
the cheers of the North and execrations
of Labor and the bulk of the southern
voters.
It was on this issue that the howling
pack of critics most vilified Griffith, but
in troublous times with the breath of the
coming financial calamity of 1893
already polluting the air, history will be
inclined to say that his was a courageous
and proper change of face.
Without reversing his natural anta-
gonism to slave-recruited labor, he saw
the need to compromise and bridge the
period during which sufficient European
labor could become available, the alter-
native being disaster in the North.
What happened then was probably a
direct sequel to the campaign of abuse
which grew in volume as the crash came.
He was by now a national figure, assured
of a continuing high place in the bodies
designed to bring the Commonwealth
into existence; sure of high office when
a Commonwealth Ministry should be
created.
He was only 48 and at the height of
his powers, but he elected to retire out
of hand to the Chief Justiceship of the
Supreme Court and to devote him-
self to giving the Colony a Criminal
Code (partly born of his study of Italian
law), the lucidity and common sense of
which has earned it world-wide fame.
He went to England in 1900 as one
of the Queensland delegates appointed to
see the Commonwealth Constitution
through the British Parliament and,
under persuasion, once more raised the
ire of his critics by reversing his opposi-
tion to giving the right of appeal from
the projected High Court of Australia
to the Privy Council. He drafted and
unofficially secured the passage of an
amendment to the Bill as approved in
Australia, to provide for such appeals.
When the High Court was created he
was the only and obvious choice to be
the first Chief Justice of Australia. He
was appointed in October, 1903, and his
appointment was vital since he was the
author of Section 74 of the Constitution
which made the Court the interpreter of
the Constitution Act. His firm position as
a state-righter, his aim for a purely
Federal constitution, as opposed to unifi-
cation, for the Commonwealth had a
highly definitive effect on the application
of the Constitution to law and on the
trends and character of legislation. There
was much disagreement with his judg-
ments during his long period of office
which ended with his retirement on
August 31, 1919, to a quiet year spent
with his Italian translations in his home
at New Farm in Brisbane. He died on
August 9, 1920, at the age of 75.
The later years
Tn his later years, he gave a great deal of
time to Dante, publishing his trans-
lations of the Inferno and the Divina
Coinmedia at the end of the first decade
of Federation. He was a sedulous worker
on literary detail, highly industrious with
his own chosen hobby, but not too busy
to read through and criticise even
mediocre work of others. I owned, for
many years, a 10,000-line poem by an
obscure poet through which he had gone
line by line, correcting, repunctuating,
altering rhythm and metre. It is now
in the Mitchell Library with some other
of his books which passed on to me.
As a writer of legislation and a maker
of law, he was unique. In a contentious-
minded Parliament the most important
and historic legislation of ministries some-
times originated with Griffith in Opposi-
tion. He had the appearance of being
domineering and not brooking contradic-
tion, but he relished argument and strong
opposition at Bar and on the Bench and
told with glee the famous story of Arthur
Coldham, a Victorian junior, to whom
he remarked tartly from his Chief
Justice’s eminence: “Mr Coldham, we
have listened patiently to you now for
two whole days and we are no wiser
than we were when you began your
address”. To which young Coldham
replied: “Not wiser, perhaps, Your
Honor, but I hope much better in-
formed.”
The writer of this article owes him
one debt. It was Griffith who remarked
to him one day, consoling him because
he could not afford to continue his study
for the Bar: “The Bar isn’t everything.
Why don’t you set yourself a purpose?
Why don’t you begin the study of Aus-
tralian history? It would suit your mind”.

How TV Made
History
The Kennedy coverage in US
From PAUL T. DAVID
(Instructor in Political Science at the
University of Virginia)
The decision of the US networks to
omit all commercials and cancel
all entertainment features, devoting
themselves to coverage of events until
after the Kennedy funeral, was in itself
one of the most remarkable episodes of
our times. Evidently there was a pre-
cedent, perhaps more than one; but the
precedents, such as they were, were laid
down in the days of radio, and not tele-
vision. Many of us remember well the
day that Franklin D. Roosevelt died; but
television was not functioning on any
wide basis at that time.
Television, having committed itself to
exclusive coverage of a single subject
for the equivalent of three to four calen-
dar days, had the maximum impact, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, of which
it is capable. Governor Albertis S. Har-
rison, Jr., of Virginia, for example, meet-
ing the cameras late on the Saturday for
comment, said: “I never in my life ex-
pected to spend six hours looking at
television, but last night I did.”
So did all the rest of us. It does not
take a Nielson survey to suggest that
very nearly the entire population was
looking at television for many hours
that Friday afternoon and evening, with
lesser but still tremendous viewing audi-
ences on the Saturday, Sunday and
Monday.
The effect has been a learning ex-
perience so great and so complex that
its full importance cannot easily be as-
sessed. The only time when human atti-
tudes change rapidly in large groups is
under the sudden impact of great events.
The present case has every potential for
a massive change in attitudes.
Nothing could have been more calcu-
lated to stir emotions than the Kennedy
assassination and the suddenness of the
Johnson accession. Television has mul-
tiplied the effect of these events by hours
upon hours of sharp visual imagery.
The imagery, moreover, was not con-
fined to the events in Dallas and Wash-
ington. To fill the time, if for no other
reason, there were also many hours of
the Kennedy political biography a
television obituary such as has never
occurred before. There was also an ex-
tensive coverage of the Johnson political
biography; and all along there was the
constant reporting from abroad, and the
conversations with the network corres-
pondents abroad.
What the networks did was eminently
fitting and proper, and in no way cal-
culated to give partisan advantage to
anyone. I suggest, however, that it has
already had immense political con-
sequences. Those consequences are
almost entirely to the advantage of the
Democratic Party and the prospective
Democratic nominee, Lyndon Johnson.
They left me convinced that he will
probably be elected in 1964.
The record of the Democratic Party
for the last three years has been wrapped
up as the record of a man who has
already become a folk hero, a martyred
President. Nothing could be better to
run on in 1964.
Johnson has been revealed as a man
who was an active, influential, and
highly successful Vice-President. This
may not be how the Washington Press
corps remembers it, but this is how it
was shown to the American people at a
moment when they were prepared and
willing to pay attention.

Indian Anxiety
Over
Goan Elections
Looking to the end of Salazar
in Bombay
From ASHWINI KUMARI
India, with three general elections
behind her, is anxiously watching
the birth of democracy in the former
Portuguese colonies of Goa, Daman and
Diu. In a few weeks these territories,
totalling less than 1400 square miles,
will celebrate the second anniversary of
their liberation from Portuguese rule.
Some 340,000 people have just gone
to the polls to elect a 30 - member
Legislature and two members for Parlia-
ment in New Delhi. Goa (1309 sq. miles)
has been allotted 28 legislative seats,
while Daman and Diu, tiny specks on
the other side of Bombay on the west
coast of India, will elect one member
each.
The Goan elections are interesting for
many reasons. This is the first free poll
in what was for some 450 years an
“overseas province” of Portugal. The
Portuguese called Goa the “Rome of
the East”. Indian troops marched into
Goa, Daman and Diu in December,

1961. In 48 hours the whole operation
was over.
If Goa under the Portuguese was an
affront to Indian nationalism, Indians
are now finding that reunion with the
motherland is not the magic wand that
solves all problems. The past two years
have shown New Delhi that it is no easy
job to integrate into the Indian political,
economic and social system a territory
that for nearly five centuries was for all
practical purposes a museum of anachro-
nistic influences.
It was only after going into Goa that
Indians realised that in a way Dr Salazar,
the Portuguese Prime Minister, was
right when he boasted that Goa had
nothing to do with the rest of India.
Unlike enlightened British colonialism
which had provided for the day when the
“natives” would take over, the Portu-
guese variety had almost succeeded in
turning Goa into a hothouse of bizarre
hybrid cultural values and administrative
measures. Indian administrators had to
devise a “package programme” of Indian
laws to replace some 4,000 Portuguese
laws and 50,000 decrees imposed during
Lisbon’s long rule. The task of intro-
ducing parliamentary democracy of the
Indo-British type has been no less frus-
trating. '
There are 144 candidates in the field.
The major contesting parties are the Goa
Congress (the local branch of the Indian
Congress Party), the United Goans, the
Frente Popular, the People’s Socialist
Party and the Maharashtrawadi Goman-
tak. There are 57 Independents.
The main election issue is whether Goa
should be merged into the adjoining
State of Maharashtra (known as Bombay
State before the country was administra-
tively reorganised in 1956) or remain a
separate administrative entity. Under
the Indian Constitution, Goa is known
as a Union Territory, like some of the
frontier Himalayan areas like Himachal
Pradesh and Tripura and the former
French pocket of Pondicherry.
The Indian Government has repeated-
ly declared that there is no plan to merge
Goa into any of the neighboring States
and that it will continue as a Union
Territory with a separate legislature of
its own. But the merger issue has re-
mained alive because of the population
complexion and interplay of political
and economic interests.
The population of Goa (about 700,000)
is 60 per cent. Hindu and 40 per cent.
Roman Catholic. Though the political
parties have adherents in both communi-
ties, the bulk of Hindus are for merger
while most of the Catholics are for
statehood. In addition, powerful econo-
mic vested interests and the growing poli-
tically conscious peasantry and industrial
workers further fragment the picture by
loyalties ranging from pro-Salazar nostal-
gia to pro-Communist, even pro-Chi-
nese, effervescence.
The Goa Congress has tried to play
down the merger issue. The best orga-
nised party, the Congress, points out that
Mr Nehru has promised the Goans that
it is for them to decide their administra-
tive future whenever they choose to do
so.
The Congress is hopeful of winning a
workable majority. Its spokesmen point
to the improved economic conditions of
the poorer Goans since liberation.
Mr Nehru feels strongly that even
though the Catholics in Goa are in a
minority nothing should be done to hustle
them into a merger. In the case of tiny
Pondicherry, he has spoken of it as “a
centre of French culture which has many
fine things about it”.
With an eye on Europe and the pos-
sible end of the Salazar regime in the
not too distant future, Mr Nehru has
also ordered that no Portuguese-language
school in Goa should be closed, (ofns.)

Companies in
Outer Space
After the Reid Murray and Ducon Reports
By J. C. HORSFALL
IF the rise and fall of empires like Reid
Murray has done nothing else it has
certainly brought the outer space
satellites of the company world more
within the reach of investors’ and State
control, though whether anybody but in-
vestors in prior charges are going to get
any lasting benefit must remain a moot
point until shareholders themselves can
get company boards to acknowledge
that the provision of risk capital has more
tangible implications of obligation on
their part than they now recognise.
When all is said and done, how often
have shareholders in Reid Murray come
in for any thought, or how much comfort
have they had from belated efforts of
the legislatures and the stock exchanges
to close gaps in company acts? By
definition they are on the very thin end
of a wedge that, at their end, predicates
no tangible rights except residual ones,
and, at the other, reaches to thicknesses
which give banks and others with first
charges on assets the power to liquidate
the very businesses in which shareholders
have sunk their money for better or
worse without any redress at all.
One may ask, also, whether the screw-
tightening process on company borrow-
ing, which is seen at work practically
throughout the whole of the recently
enacted amendments to the Victorian
Companies Act, is not inimical to the
interests of shareholders in a wide range
of companies whose profits and progress
depend to a large extent on high ratios
of borrowings to issued capital. Luckily
for many such companies the amended
Act falls short of dictating maximum
ratios of borrowed funds to issued capi-
tal, but one gathers from Stock Ex-
change officers, who were closely con-
sulted in the drafting of the legislation,
that this wasn't for want of trying to
arrive at some acceptable formula.
Moreover, from recent talks with such
officers in Melbourne, one gathers that
if the Exchanges have given up their
recent efforts to get an acceptable for-
mula they are now proceeding to look
a lot closer at their own listing require-
ments for companies, and it wouldn’t
be at all surprising if they came up with
some even more punitive strictures on
company borrowing than is now con-
tained in the amended Act.
But they should remember that, as
was pointed out in the debate on the Bill
in the Victorian Legislative Assembly,
even the amendments proposed and now
enacted without change run the danger
of putting company boards in strait-
jackets, particularly when it comes to
borrowing on debenture which will put
them under virtually continual surveil-
lance from trustees as to the disposition
of borrowed funds and the general and
detailed courses of their operations.
Many people like myself think the
amendments will unnecessarily ham-
string company boards in following rea-
sonable courses of action, though of
course we will have to wait and see
whether the select band of trustee com-
panies who have now been obliged to
be more vigilant than they have been
in the past will take their obligations
very much more seriously and whether
they are in fact equipped to do so.
One of the gaps that the amended
Companies Act cannot, by the nature
of it, fill is in the trustee companies
themselves, which hitherto have only
come on the scene of company action
when a formal breach of a trust deed
has been exposed. The implication is
that, by and large, trustees have never
before got inside companies to see for
themselves what is going on, whether
a difficult situation is being bred which
will sooner or later lead to a breach.
From experience this has usually been
because the trustees have not been equip-
ped with the necessary staff to keep
running tabs on the state of affairs in
the companies concerned. It is not so
much that the companies themselves
wouldn't let the trustees in to see for
themselves what was going on, but rather
that trustees have seldom asked, except
after some particular horse has bolted.
So, to put teeth into the amended
Act, it will be necessary not only for
trustees to be very much more alert but
also to build up their staffs with officers
qualified to undertake the very much
closer liaison with companies using
money under their trusteeship. By the
same token the companies themselves

will have to supplement their staffs to
ensure that this liaison is made effective
and that, as ordained under the amended
Act, the quarterly and half yearly re-
ports now demanded will be made on
time. Equally the Crown Law depart-
ment will have to be more actively on the
job to police the new arrangement for
more frequent reporting by companies.
Criticism has been levelled at the latest
amendments to the Act in that they
do not lay down any prescribed ratio
of borrowing to issued capital and no-
where provide sanctions against the on-
lending of funds by the borrowing com-
pany to other companies either within or
outside a company grouping. But in the
light of the difficulty in finding workable
formulae which would achieve the same
ends, it does seem that the prescription in
the Act for frequent reports from com-
panies to trustees will go a long way in
providing safeguards, especially as it is
backed by new provisions for tightening
up trust deeds and prospectuses and by
limiting the number of eligible trustees
to a selected type of reputable com-
panies, as was done in an amendment to
the Act earlier this year.
With this complex of snares for an
expansive Board it would seem impos-
sible now for a similar build-up of a
group’s borrowing power to take place
as was perpetrated by Reid Murray
through the cross-fertilisation of the is-
sued capital of its borrowing company,
Reid Murray Acceptance, and the sub-
scription of its own borrowed funds via
the holding company. For not only would
an effective trustee drop quickly on to
such a procedure through its surveillance
of the disposition of the acceptance com-
pany’s borrowings but it would also be
up to the trustee in drawing up the
trust deed to ensure that such a prac-
tice was prohibited.
One would have thought that a useful
step at this stage to supplement the
legislation would be to call for a general
revision of all trust deeds to close this
loophole where it exists. An examination
of the trust deeds of finance companies,
particularly where these are subsidiaries
or associated companies of holding com-
panies, might well reveal a crop of trust
deeds ripe for revision on that account.
Again it would now seem impossible
for the fund-raising by the likes of
Victorian radio and TV group, W. A.
Peterson Ltd, through the issue of un-
secured notes by a finance subsidiary
(W. A. Peterson Securities Ltd) to be
repeated. This group, which last week
reported a loss of some £360,000 for
1962-63 and the dissipation of the whole
of its shareholders’ funds, raised
£lOO,OOO from the public two years
ago on one of the weakest prospectuses
I have ever seen (with the possible ex-
ception of one issued by Testro Bros.
about the same time) and made a mock-
ery of strict prospectus procedures by
radio appeals to “mums” (but not “dads”)
that the issue was a must for their old
oak chests.
To start with, neither of these two
companies would be allowed under the
amended Companies Act to use as a
trustee other than one of the range of
reputable companies now alone eligible
to act as trustees. This would have ruled
out the likes of Public, Fidelity and
Audit Ltd acting for their purposes. This
was a company specially created by
Testro Bros, to act as the trustee for
its debenture holders.
Further, neither of the prospectuses
issued by these two groups, one now the
subject of an application in the Victorian
Supreme Court for winding up (inciden-
tally, despite the objection of all classes
of creditors!) and the other probably now
destined for liquidation (one of its sub-
sidiaries is already under an official
manager), would get past the eye of the
Crown Law Department today,
Testro Bros, and W. A. Peterson are
two cases where the old Companies Act
fell down on at least two counts, first
in not demanding sufficient information
in prospectuses and secondly by allowing
in sufficiently reputable trustees to act for
them, thus opening the way for putting
debenture money in the hands of specu-
latively-minded management who had
nothing to fear from the surveillance of
their trustees. But some of the crashes
of the last two years were by companies
which raised money on impeccable pros-
pectuses, prepared by some of the most
reputable financiers in the country, and
with high class (at least high sounding)
trustees, but which came unstuck through
over-extending their activities on the basis
of a mountain of borrowed money,
There is still nothing in the Corn-
panies Act to prevent large borrowing
of this sort, and it seems that the main


sanctions for the future in these cases
lie with the underwriters and trustees in
the negotiations for arranging such bor-
rowing, with whether the managements
concerned have learned the right lessons
from their harrowing experiences and
with the Act’s new provisions for the
personal liability of directors for the loss
of funds.
An ultra-strict Companies Act does
not necessarily kill the virus of develop-
ment in the blood of anybody, let alone
those who see unlimited horizons ahead,
even in such a respectable business as
the retail trade, in which both Reid
Murray and Factors were deeply in-
volved. On the face of it a backer of
a debenture or a note issue might see
little difference in the retailing abilities
of, say, Mr A. H. Tolley, chairman of
Myers, and Sir Frank Richardson, chair-
man of Cox Bros. Yet today you have
the position where the one is sitting on
the top of a mountain of granite and
the other on what looks more like a
house of cards. Yet both have been
backed by equally reputable finance
houses, J. B. Were & Sons on the one
hand and lan Potter & Co. on the other.
It will depend on what financiers and
bankers will say whether these or any
other retail groups will get the finance
they want either for further expansion
or simply to prevent a crash, whatev ,r
others may think about the wisdom of
letting them have it.
"T ooking at another aspect, what, say,
of the inter-company lending of
Factors such as its advances of
£2,124,196 to Stanhill Consolidated.
These were made on the flimsiest of
security, carried interest of 16 per cent
and found their way without much delay
into the sieve of Chevron Sydney Tom
which Stanhill Consolidated cannot hope
to retrieve a penny of them for repay-
ment to Factors. Would the now
amended Companies Act of today have
prevented that happening 0
Not necessarily so. Presumably there
is nothing in the trust deed of Factors’
debentures to have prevented it, and in
the circumstances when it was made
that is when high hopes were being
entertained for the success of Chevron
Sydney (not only by the Factors’ board
but also by the investing public in gen-
eral) probably the trustee, even with
his enhanced power today, would have
condoned it. As it was, the trustee prob-
ably never knew about it until it was
made. Now, although he still hasn’t the
right to be told, he would soon learn
about it, through the now prescribed
frequent periodic reports the company
would be obliged to make. Also, one
would imagine that in the new climate
of trustee surveillance, any board put-
ting out large amounts of debenture
holders’ funds to an outside borrower
would think it expedient to ask the
trustee what he thought about it first.
But there is no firm obligation under the
Act requiring this to be done.
Again,. if the on-lending of debenture
funds were made by a holding company,
say to a subsidiary, it is very doubtful
whether any board would deem it neces-
sary to advise the trustee because that
sort of thing is a day-to-day occurrence
throughout the company world. More-
over and this applies to all loans
made by a company using debenture
funds there is usually no clear iden-
tification in the use made by a company
of the types of funds used in its business,
be they raised in the form of subscribed
capital, debentures, bank overdraft or
any other. Usually they all go into the
same general pot.
Certainly one of the difficulties of
trustees will still be to identify the dis-
position of debenture funds in the gen-
eral melange of a company’s assets, and
this makes it all the more important
for trustees to use intelligently the new
facilities for being kept informed on a
company’s financial state and the direc-
tion of its business to ensure the enter-
prise is sound. One would also suppose
that trustees would not be so much con-
cerned about what particular purposes
debenture money was used for, so long
as a company’s general position was satis-
factory. Further, the punitive clauses
putting personal responsibility on di-
rectors for the loss of funds would create
a community of interest between trustees
and directors, though this would not
occur in cases of fraudulent directors,
and it is these which we will have to
worry most about. In future it may be
easier under the amended Act to deter
indifferent and poor management than
to stop fraudulent activity.
ly/fR F. J. O. Ryan, the NSW Registrar
of Companies, in his report on
Ducon industries stated that the Com-
panies Act is wide open on the use of
inside information by directors, and he
has recommended it be amended.
In my book, provisions for precise
penalties for directors offending against
the improper use of information should
be written in to the Act just as they are
in the amended Victorian Act for loss
of funds.
Most people would want to go even
further than imposing fines and im-
prisonment for proved deals of this sort.
The very least that might be done would
be to disqualify proved offenders from
holding such positions in the company
world, at any rate in any public com-
pany. Of course this would not stop the
widespread abuse of confidential infor-
mation by insiders in Australian com-
panies, but it might reduce it somewhat.
For every case one hears of, there are
probably a hundred one doesn’t.
Other sanctions might be applied by
shareholders of companies, but this is
getting into trickier ground because,
though the influence of shareholders on
company affairs is growing, it is still
very small.
However, if anybody is in doubt that
share dealing is not the main area of
abuse, and that this lies without doubt
among the satellites of the private com-
pany world into which the long hand
of many public companies with borrow-
ing strings out to the public reaches, a
reading of the Reid Murray investigators’
report should be convincing on the mat-
ter. In the case of Reid Murray the scope
for abuse was all the greater because of
the virtual absence of surveillance by
the borrowing company of the group
(Reid Murray Acceptance) or even the
holding company (whose board was iden-
tical) over what the outflung empire of
subsidiaries did with the money shunted
out to them.
Nobody will pretend that the amended
Companies Act makes any more than a
broad stab attacking abuses in this area.
At least so far as trustees are concerned
it gives much more scope for keeping
a tab on publicly-borrowed funds chan-
nelled out to it but again it is difficult
to differentiate between the destination of
this sort of money and other funds, is-
sued capital, ploughed back profits, and
so on in this outer company world.
This leaves this area wide open for
manipulations.
So one is really thrown back to the
question of morals, of the integrity of
directors. And in a discussion I had
about a year ago with a group of Mel-
bourne businessmen, which included Mr
A. B. Mellor, the chairman of the Stock
Exchange, and people like Sir Frank
Sellick and Mr Oswald Burt, probably
the leading authority on our company
law, Mr Burt was very sceptical whether
in fact much could be done to stop the
main abuses by amendments to the
Companies Acts and that the main re-
quirement was to lift the level of in-
tegrity among directors.

STAMP TRADING
Sir,
Your article “Who is for Stamp
Trading?” (23/11/63) is a reasonably
accurate picture of the trading stamp
situation overseas, but omits some im-
portant facts relevant to Australian con-
ditions. These are: —
(i) Third party coupons of the type
described (which are parasitic in concept)
are illegal in all States of Australia except
New South Wales and Tasmania.
(ii) A committee of the South Austra-
lian House of Parliament appointed to
examine this problem in 1937 reported
as follows: “The three-party coupon sys-
tem is inimical to the interests of the
State, the consumer, and the retail trader.
The profits made by companies operating
such schemes are derived from the con-
sumers and your Committee is of the
opinion that in the aggregate the con-
sumer in a community where three-
party coupons are issued is not served in
any better manner than the consumer in
a community where they are not . . .”
The report condemns the practice in
measured terms after an exhaustive and
deliberative enquiry.
Apart from this, commonsense suggests
that if the trading stamp companies
make fat profits then somebody is pay-
ing for it. You say that the housewife
cannot fail to gain, so that leaves the
retailer carrying the cost. Would it not
be natural for the retailers to pass this
on?

DLP AND THE ELECTIONS
Sir,
Although the failure of the DLP to
wither away has been noted, much of
the comment on the election results
misses the significance and shrewdness
of the DLP campaign. The DLP con-
ducted an almost wholly negative cam-
paign and was enabled to do this because
Sir Robert Menzies held the election
separate from the Senate election. There
was, therefore, no compelling reason for
them to try to win votes for possible
Senate seats. This being so, the DLP
set out, paradoxically, to lose votes. It
set out to push erstwhile LCP supporters
back to the LCP, partly to make certain
of a resounding LCP victory and ALP
defeat, but more especially in order to
find out and prove its own solid core. It
now knows that it can rely on 10-12 per
cent of Victorians to support it through
hell and high water, and 4-6 per cent of
voters in the other States to do the same.
This is sufficient to decide almost any
election.
But the other reason for the negative
campaign was more “positive”. By over-
doing the emotional, it ensured that
Right-wingers would have no truck with
the DLP by virtually calling these
“spineless appeasers” and “semi-reds”
it ensured that Right and Left wing will
destroy each other without trying to
make up to the DLP.

“UNIVERSITY GONE WRONG?”
Sir,
While a “Queensland Correspondent”
in “A University Gone Wrong?”
(23/11/63) appears to dissect the prob-
lems of the University of Queensland
with cold logic, much of the article’s
factual basis is questionable.
To take one particular point the
university is accused, in a roundabout
way, of “academic inbreeding.” Using
the same sources of information claimed
to have been used by “Queensland Cor-
respondent,” the current Calendars of
the universities of Queensland and Mel-
bourne, it is possible to draw a compari-
son. The percentage of full-time pro-
fessors and associate professors having
qualifications only from their “home”
universities is, for Queensland. 12 per
cent and for Melbourne 27 per cent.
When the qualifications of academic staff
down to the level of senior lecturer are
examined it is found that 13 per cent of
Queensland staff have only Queensland
degrees, while the figure for Melbourne
is 41 per cent.

PREFERENTIAL VOTING
Sir,
The fact that preferential voting is a
“hit and miss” affair seems all too
apparent to me. This time I decided, on
account of its slightly more liberal
foreign policy, to vote for the ALP.
However, this proved to be easier said
than done.
In the first place, our daily news-
papers for Friday and Saturday do not
reach us until Monday, so I had to
resort to our local paper for information
concerning voting procedure for the
Senate. Here, while I found a sample
copy showing the correct numbering of
the squares against each Senator’s name
for voting Liberal and Country Party,
nowhere could I ascertain more than
that Mr Whiteside was No. 1 on the list
for ALP.
It was the same at the local polling
booth plenty of forms demonstrating
how to vote for Liberal and Country
Party, none for ALP. So, without a
sample copy, or any indication against
the names of the Senators as to what
party they belonged, I set out to con-
vert the Liberal and CP voting order
into as near an opposite as I could
quite a mathematical problem! Un-
fortunately, I have since learnt that
unless my paper was 100 p.c. correct,
it would be counted as informal. There-
fore the odds are against my having
registered a vote which is valid.

“STATE SWINGS”
Sir,
Inaccuracy brings loss of confidence.
In your article “State Swings and Seat
Roundabouts” (30/11/63) the comment
on Stirling, Western Australia, included
the statement: “There has been an in-
crease of 6098 electors, mainly in Bal-
catta, an area which returned a Labor
State member.” A map will demon-
strate how silly it is to compare the State
seat of Balcatta with the Federal sub-
division—though your prediction of the
fate of the seat was correct.
R. V. GARLAND

THE STATE AID ISSUE
Sir,
For some time you have published un-
signed articles which often take the DLP
line on State aid to church schools, the
last of these appearing (by chance?) in
Plain English on the day of the election
(30/11/63). In this it was argued that
there was little difference between State
schools and others —they . . follow
much the same curricula, train students
for the same examinations, and generally
maintain much the same atmosphere—
though there is more variety in the
private section.” Since the last claim is
at least arguable there are many
different courses, activities, and types
of schools within the State system of
Australia —and if the other points are
conceded, all that has been done is to
have shown that private and church
schools are unnecessary. Where there is
little difference, why should we worry
about a second system, let alone pay
for it?
An equally bad argument is found
later in the same article: the Liberal
Party is said to favor private enterprise
and therefore should grant State aid to
private schools. When you take away
risk, has not enterprise changed its
nature? I say, let the apostles of
private enterprise enterprise privately;
what Plain English wants is State enter-
prise but private control. Why? Per-
haps you should entitle your page “Plain
Irish”.

THEATRE
Invitation to the Dance
An elemental language
By KEVON KEMP
Aboriginal Theatre. Elizabethan
Theatre. Sydney.
Mary, Mary. Jean Kerr. Theatre
Royal. Sydney.
Rashomon. Fay and Michael Kanin.
Independent Theatre. Sydney.
T can only say that the entertainment
offered by the Aboriginal Theatre
comes as the most pleasantly stunning
shock in recent memory. Most of us
have great goodwill towards aborigines
and their culture, without having more
than a superficial knowledge of their
art. If only for the joy of improving on
one’s ignorance, this remarkable stage
show at the Elizabethan is something
not to be missed.
With so great a premium placed on
academic verbal learning in this age,
that area of human activity and art
which involves our bodies in movement
is in danger of being submerged. Only
the officially - preserved folk - dance
troupes of Europe and the East arrive
occasionally to show us here a lost
world, in which words are irrelevant and
in which movement, muscular tension
and relaxation, the use of space between
person and person, person and group,
individual and nature become the
elements of a language more funda-
mental, more directly assimilated than
words.
Dance of this sort can give to the
viewer an uncanny mimesis of the
natural landscape and environment; the
relation of man to his environment, the
way he carries his sky and cloud on his
back, the friendliness or danger of his
habitat, the animals and birds he sees
about him.
Perhaps the great achievement of this
present company is the wonderful
evocation of Australian landscape and
its effects on the travelling humans who
inhabit it. The ritual dances, the hunt-
ing dances, the dances that tell the
society’s important legends all reveal
this haunting essence of our landscape
—its space, the way a man is free to feel
the air flowing under his armpits, the
nonchalance of old land surfaces —so
old they obviously do not give a damn
for mankind. This is the nonchalance
that comes through to us, pre-eminently
to our aborigines, as these most talented
dancers show with clarity and their own
undeniable beauty.
Along with the dances, musical
virtuoso Yangarin plays many short
didgeridoo solos, against a simple back-
ground of back-projected slides of
aboriginal bark paintings that are alone
worth the price of admission. Of Yan-
garin, the show's commentator reveals
that he has the remarkable ability to
breathe in air at the same time as he
puts out enough breath to sustain his
tone. Thus he maintains a continuous
tone on his instrument.
Staging (by Stefan Haag) uses a few
realistic details beautifully composed
against a cloth cyclorama on to which
is thrown colored slides of Australian
landscape —an effect completely con-
vincing, and surely an argument for
designers to employ this old (but rarely
seen here) mode for a bigger range of
productions.
A fter the genuine excitement of the
Aboriginal Theatre I found myself
summing up Broadway’s formula gag-
piece, “Mary, Mary” (previously noticed
by Madeleine Armstrong in Melbourne)
in a facile paraphrase “Wholly Pre-
dictable, Splendidly Null”. Which is not
to say that, seeing it is Christmas and
many friends and aunts may have to be
entertained, the play does not have its
right place in our rondelay of things to
laugh at. It’s all done very well by pro-
ducer Raymond Westwell and stars
Muriel Pavlow and Derek Farr.
Why did Peter Summerton, as a sort
of farewell production at the Indepen-
dent (he is going overseas for a year)
choose to stage “Rashomon”? Surely the
only justification for doing the play can
be to achieve some fresh statement
through it; to throw more light on the
theme than Kurosawa’s film can do.
As it is, the evening is a bore, and
not until the ending of the play does it
strike the right note of mockery and
satire. Up to this point, everything has
been played on a Shakespearean scale
of tragic truth and intensity—a produc-
tion notion that sends the meaning of
the play right out the door.
According to the publicity, Mr Sum-
merton was to base his production on
“traditions of the Kabuki and Noh
theatres”. Leaving aside the delicate
philosophical questions such an extra-
ordinary blending would raise, let me
hurry to reassure you that in no way
does anything of the Japanese theatre
intrude. This is, if anything, as square-
set a run-of-the-mill proscenium treat-
ment as you are ever likely to see. Per-
haps an imaginative use of the Noh stage
concept, with its long “walks”, would
have been a good idea, enabling perfect
simultaneity of several action areas; it
certainly would have been an improve-
ment on the scene-drops and black-outs
which are this production’s mode.
Owen Weingott’s bandit was as
derivative as the production, and so
were all the other characterisations with
the honorable exceptions of Ben Gabriel
as the husband and David Goddard as
the wig-maker—who, whilst over-play-
ing, did get the correct note of mockery
into his performance.

“In The Cool Of The Day” has most

sentimental unreality, but in spite of
John Houseman's sleek production and
Robert Stevens’ smooth direction, it’s a
pedestrian, lugubrious affair. It lacks
gusto and it has Peter Finch. His acting
is competent, of course, but he can’t (or
won’t) indulge in the soulful bravura of
the genuine romantic hero.
Jane Fonda, afflicted with a wig and
peculiar clothes, struggles gamely but
unavailingly as the doomed heroine. The
film’s liveliest moments come from
Angela Lansbury, exuberantly overplay-
ing the role of Finch’s bitchy wife.
Based on a French musical play which
had international success, “Irma La
Douce” has that favorite heroine of
modern mythology, the good-hearted
whore who is only waiting to find true
love. She does, in a simpleton who after
being kicked out of the police force be-
comes her pimp.
Prostitution and procuring are not par-
ticularly endearing professions, and Billy
Wilder has little success in the early part
of the film in making his hero and hero-
ine acceptable. Jack Lemmon and Shir-
ley MacLaine are an agreeable pair, but
so recognisably American and respect-
able that they can never be believable as
raffish Parisians.
There is a sudden acceleration later in
the film, when Wilder takes over and,
abandoning all pretence of Parisian
atmosphere, sheers off into a wonderful
crescendo of mounting absurdity.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
ART
Avant-Garde
Twelve Artists. Hungry Horse Gallery.
Sydney.
Tnstead of gleanings from show rem-
A nants over the year, the Hungry
Horse Gallery displays a strong group of
works by twelve avant-garde artists, all
painters, with the exception of Robert
Klippel. Lavish hanging which flatters
each exhibit and their inclusion in a big,
sumptuously produced catalogue-cum-
Kunstkalender in full color, make this
Christmas showing a big event.
Klippel’s “Steel Sculpture” gathers
tense vertical forms with carefully
selected pieces of junk into an elegant
composition, almost classical in its re-
straint of means. Something of this
quality, though rendered fluid and some-
what dramatic, charges Carl Plate's “Sup-
porting Black” with spacious strength.
The blacks loom heavily from the top
left, right and centre across creamy light,
over straggling linear accents below.
Lancely’s playful, disturbing and irre-
verent embellishments in paint surround
a wittily placed piece of what appears
to be an old barrel organ. Entitled
“Altar”, its comment is supported by
abstract design quite opposite to that of
Emmanuel Raft who uses half-sub-
merged collage reproductions in order to
throw up a strident embryonic insect
image, in waxy white on dense black.
John Olsen probes the associative
subtleties of metamorphic imagery in
“Portrait Landscape”, carrying fluent
handling alongside each shift of empha-
sis or change of mood. By contrast,
Frank Hodgekinson’s U-shaped motif
plunges toward immobility, an effect en-
hanced by the fungus-like materiality of
surrounding texture in sulphurs and
browns. Reddington’s molten yellow-
reds gain mobility through an interesting,
rather dashing paint quality instead of
from half visceral shapes that flop around
in the frame.
“Catching the Big Wave No. 2”, by
Hessing, catches light flecks amid a richly
conceived mixture of sombre tones and
variable line, while Rapotec’s “Experience
in Autumn” brings explosive force to
bear on a dark space pierced by rough
jabs of paint, all in his characteristic
effusiveness of handling.
John Coburn enters a more abstract
realm with a painting of four large,
simply considered forms on an impal-
pable blue field. Their frank awkward-
ness is offset by their innate tendency to
generate momentum. Rose shows one
of his diagonal compositions which seems
more concerned than before with a range
of paint surfaces, and Robert Hughes
has shed a few of his dead landscape
bitumens in a scarlet and yellow palon
to “Spring Hill”, which presumably, as
the main shape, retains a strong link with
gluteus maximus sprawlings of more
figurative work, yet with a diminishing
debt to Brett Whiteley.
JOHN HENSHAW
Promotion
117'ith the third representative exhibition
’’ of Australian art virtually on its
way overseas, it might be a good time to
consider some strange inconsistencies in
the art world.
One very odd fact is the vast
divergence of critical opinion between
London and Sydney. The two previous
exhibitions at the Whitechapel and Tate
Galleries were greeted in London with
great acclaim and praise, the effects of
which are still reverberating in Sydney.
A slightly more jaundiced view of this
criticism revealed the fascination with
the exotic and the unfamiliarity of the
myths. The tone of voice was tinged
with a slightly patronising pride in a
favorite child who is beginning to show
signs of talent.
The greatest praise was given to
Nolan, Boyd, Blackman and the other
painters who most obviously enhanced
and satisfied the mystique that has
developed there about Australian art.
With the exception of Brett Whiteley—
who was magnificently presented at the
Whitechapel—the bulk of the abstract
work was generally glossed over with
glib generalities. It would be far too
easy to explain away this lack of praise
in terms of the English preference for
figurative painting, the “myth” of the
myths and the weirdness of the Aus-
tralian landscape.
A more than casual acquaintance
with the Sydney art world quickly
reveals an “in” group of painters;
painters who are very highly esteemed
and have all the influence, prestige and
receive all advantages of any such
privileged group. Superficially it seems
as if this standing is obtained without
any conscious effort on the part of the
painters concerned. But in reality,
although a product of the artistic
immaturity of Sydney, reputations are
often the result of a very special sort of
promotion. The aptitude Sydney painters
have for promotion is phenomenal.
Built on the rather insubstantial basis
of “social lobbying” their position is
nevertheless very secure due to the
present need for this deification. Sydney’s
art world is small, inbred and violently
unsure of itself. Both collectors and
painters feel the need mutually to boost
their respective purchases and pictures.
The critics are by no means detached
from this process, and with the exception
of Daniel Thomas all the critics are
painters—either of the past or present.
Standards and judgments laid down be-
come irrefutable when there is no Tapies
or de Kooning to contradict them. So
one has a sellers’ market where the
painters themselves are setting the
standards, assessing merit and deciding
the prizewinners.

the sight of Carolyn Berntsen prevented
an oesophageal scream’s emission, saving
my neighbors the trouble of beating on
the wall with the palms of their hands,
running up it in stomp shoes, or what-
ever it is they do when I react to panel
shows, Delo in song, ABC fillers about
frog farming, Billy Graham, or the
Le Garde twins.
Miss Berntsen has the neighbors’
thanks, and mine, because I have some-
times placed “Any Questions?” in the
“Biggies” class for sheer childishness,
but Miss B. spent her childhood as a
Quiz Kid, and her adult presence
suggested that at last the ABC had
decided to select a panel rather than a
tontine.
And so it had, managing a nice balance
of age and mature youth, wisdom and
wit, in the persons of Cyril Pearl, Edgar
Holt, Miss Berntsen —all liberal, worldly
journalists, columnists and broadcasters
•—and a Mr Dennis Pryor, who had a
wicked smile and eye. Frank Legg was
the referee, and the audience was the
Chatswood P. & C. Association, mothers
and fathers from part of Sydney’s North
Shore.
When I looked in the panel was being
asked one of those Controversial Ques-
tions which usually lead varying numbers
of citizens to write in protest to the PM
and the PMG, with a carbon for Dr
Darling, condemning the show as a
blatant medium for hateful propaganda.
This question was “Should Australia
recognise Communist China?”
A thousand times no, said Edgar Holt,
giving sound political reasons for his
alarm. Nonsense, said Miss Berntsen,
shaking her curls and giving her own
sound, unpolitical reasons. Pearl and
Pryor agreed with her, one throwing in
a gallant “. . . has covered all I could
say, and much more charmingly . .
Frank Legg declared Edgar Holt out-
voted, and Holt replied that he might be,
but Australians would support him three
to one. It was a question which would
have caused some of “Any Questions?”
traditional panels to seethe, but that
night’s four were urbane enough to
conceal their teeth.
The next question was something like
“Do you favor cranks?” and everyone
agreed with some wit and liveliness that
nuts and eccentrics are good for the com-
munity. Dennis Pryor suggested that
Australians must favor cranks because
they had just elected 100 or so to Parlia-
ment. It was a much better panel than
all of this suggests; but even such an
improved grouping leaves “Any Ques-
tions?” with the 64-dollar one, how can
it ever be better than the questions it’s
asked?
While the show is pinned down in
front of an audience and committed to
audience questions, there will always be
someone ready to leap in front of the
camera and ask “Should we recognise
Communist China?” or similar profound
queries. It should be possible to fix that
problem. Meanwhile, a small cheer for
the ABC for realising that non-academic
panels are more fun.

Tiger by the Tail
A British poet savages Singapore
By D. J. ENRIGHT
Tropic Temper. A Memoir of Malaya.
James Kirkup. Collins. 375. 3d.
Tames Kirkup is a British poet, and
** poets, as we know, are an unreliable
lot. Creatures of the senses, captured
by the curve of a sarong, the flash of a
cheongsam or the perfume of a durian
fruit, they tend to be blind to the high
purposes of politicians, organisations,
universities and even, these days, of
travel writers. Such blindness, one
might suggest, is not a totally crippling
deficiency, seeing what high purposes
so often lead to. There is room for
impressionists and actors as well as
statisticians and policemen.
One trouble with the present book,
though, is that Mr Kirkup allows him-
self to slip or flounder into large and
naive pronouncements on subjects out-
side his range of judgment. “As soon
as he reflects,” as Goethe said of Byron,
“he is a child,” and in Mr Kirkup’s case
a rather petulant child. His tropic terri-
er was not altogether a sweet one. “The
whole of the Far East is gradually being
carried away by ants”: that is poetic and
pardonable exaggeration. This isn’t: “The
Singapore Chinese are surely not real
Chinese, I mean not truly representa-
tive of that wonderful race. I found them
loud-mouthed, mercenary, mean.” Every
single one of them? Mr Kirkup’s short
stay in Singapore was spent largely among
taxi-drivers, hoteliers and barmen, all of
them persons with a special interest in
money and birds of passage. “The atti-
tude of Chinese in shops and restaurants:
a mixture of disdain and impertinence.”
Here and elsewhere and the habit
(which he warns himself against) leads to
unfairness Mr Kirkup is probably
remembering the Japanese of his previous
travel book. Some of us may feel that
even Japanese courtesy has its own way
of embarrassing and disquieting . . .
But leaving that aside, let Mr Kirkup
compare Malayan waiters and shop
assistants with their British counter-
parts.
It is the Malays who most attract Mr
Kirkup and elicit his most colorful prose.
Yet it might be thought (and perhaps
thought wrongly, of course) that his
praise of them “Watching the
Malays dancing, 1 knew they were one
of the world's most highly civilized
races” would be harder to take than
the disparagement of some other
writers.
Mr Kirkup's book on Japan perhaps
erred on the side of sentimentality:
which many people maintain is a good
side to err on. It is not so with his
book on Malaya, a country which he
could not manage to love “Oh, my
hyperaesthesia!” It is certainly not a
tourist’s country: it needs time to make
its impression on the foreigner, and per-
haps in the end its interest boils down
to its multi-raciality, and its great en-
suing problem: can people of different
races, religions, colors and customs make
a go of it together in a more or less
democratic framework? All this •
which isn’t of merely local significance
and lion dances, Thaipusam and so
forth, too. Mr Kirkup seems to have
formed a fundamental grudge at an early
stage in his Malayan experience. No
one met him when his boat docked at
Penang. Having been brought out from
England to fill a lectureship in English
at the University of Malaya in Kuala
Lumpur (which some unscholarly re-
viewers, I note, have confused with the
University of Singapore, which is in
Singapore), he arrived to find himself
expected to lecture. “The thought of
literature makes me feel sick: merely
to open a book brings on attacks of
nausea ...” A further shock was in
store. He was not allowed to teach
“Lolita”; he was ordered to teach Henry
James (“womanish fusspot”). No wonder
that he quotes with relish Cocteau's
ghastly pun, Kuala l’lmpure!
Tn truth the subject of the book is at
A least as much James Kirkup as it is
Malaya. And the author-subject’s arro-
gance is at times quite superb. There is
a long disquisition on his experience of
mosquitoes, which seems to differ in no
way from anyone else's. There is a good
deal about his costuming and perfum-
ing (“Flagrant Delit” is one of his own
creations), and some comic Walter
Mittyisms. “It was the best curry I ever
ate in Malaya. It left me with gloriously
burning lips, mouth and tongue Hot-
lips Hassan I called myself, dabbing on
a few drops of (Naughty Time) scent.”
Mr Kirkup believes that his archness,
like an-apple-a-day, will keep the bores
and dunces away: there is danger that
it may operate along the lines of an-
onion-a-day. Though, speaking for my-
self, I should be sorry to lose all this en-
dearingly non-oblique self-reference. For
one thing, it reminds the reader that what
he has before him is a cascade of reflec-
tions and self-reflections and not a Defi-
nite Study of What-have-you.
“Tropic Temper” certainly has charac-
ter then, even though it is not (I would
say) exactly Malayan character. Mr Kir-
kup is brightly evocative in matters re-
lating to clothes, puppets, shadow-plays,
animals, the passing scene of arcade and
market, and such casual encounters,
colorful or comic, as the hotel-room
notice, “No Opium Smoking”, to which
somebody had added the words “in Bed”.
Thus (if it is not improper to adduce
it) the description of a meeting with the
present reviewer:
... a pale, Shelleyan face (good)
with very Shelleyan eyes and mouth
. . . Abrupt, curt manner of speak-
ing: he is unsure of himself and is
feeling his way. I can sense behind
his attitude the weight of prejudice
which people who have never met
me always seem to have . . . Massive
silver or pewter rings, set with curi-
ous stones, on his slender white fing-
ers .. . He took me in his large car,
through a blinding thunderstorm, to
a dinner at a lush and phoney Chi-
nese Restaurant, the Mandarin
Room . . . Perhaps poets aren’t so
awful, after all.
Which might be rendered into the demo-
tic as: debased Anglo-Irish face (bad)
with pale blue bloodshot eyes; a little
fatigued after driving from Singapore,
slightly embarrassed by the possibility
that J. K. might have seen his reviews of
three or more of J. K.’s earlier books;
a souvenir Thai niello ring, no stone,
and an ordinary topaz in a heavy silver
mount; stubby pinko-grey fingers; a sec-
ond-hand 1958 Ford Consul; and a meal
at a restaurant of vulgar decor but reas-
onable cuisine. Poets are awful, after
all! But there is no doubt as to which
version is the more readable.

/Tn the afternoon of January 30, 1948,
a young man stepped out of a crowd
of worshippers who had come to attend
Gandhi’s prayer meeting and, after
touching the Mahatma’s feet as a gesture
craving forgiveness, fired three shots in
his frail body. It was later discovered
that the crime was not the spontaneous
act of a lunatic, but the culmination of a
wide - spread conspiracy of Hindu
fanatics to rid the country of a man

who was the main obstacle in the way of
making India a Hindu state. The young
murderer was Nathu Ram Godse, a
member of the para-military Hindu
Sangha. The wave of anger that rose in
the country because of the murder of
the saintly Gandhi destroyed the Hindu
fascist movement. A sense of guilt
afflicted most Indians; they said that
the three bullets fired by Godse rep-
resented the three major communities of
India the Hindus, Muslims and the
Sikhs—and that all of them had killed
Gandhi by refusing to follow in his foot-
steps.
Eight men were put up for trial for
the murder. The proceedings lasted over
six months. Only Godse and one Apte
were sentenced to death. The two men
argued their appeal against the sentence
in the High Court. They claimed that
their motives were lofty—they wanted
India to be cleared of filthy cow-eating
foreigners like the English and the
Muslims; they appealed to Hindu senti-
ment by quoting the sacred Sanskrit
texts. By the time they finished their
arguments they had changed from
villains to heroes. They received
thousands of messages of sympathy.
Girls knitted scarves and pullovers for
them. When the High Court confirmed
the sentences of death, hundreds of men
and women in the court-room broke
down and wept.
G. D. Khosla was one of the panel
of judges who dismissed the appeals of
Godse and Apte. A close friend of
Khosla’s who presided over the execu-
tion of the two men in Ambala gaol
furnished him details of their behavior
when they mounted the scaffold. And
G. D. Khosla, who has an honored name
amongst Indian writers, has turned all
his forensic and literary skill to re-
counting this memorable trial.
’The murder of the Mahatma is only
one of the ten cases dealt with in this
book. The others provide glimpses into
different facets of life in rural Punjab.
In Khosla’s drink cabinet are passion,
poison, dacoity and arson and he knows
how to shake a really heady cocktail.
This book is likely to be a best-seller in
India. I can recommend it to Australian
readers both for its intrinsic merits as
well as the sort of things some bad
Indians do about which most good
Indians enjoy reading.

an epigraph from Yeats; create
an introspective hero “with eyes of
such a dark liquidity that they suggested
an almost permanent expression of con-
dolence . . . the kind of bland transpar-
ency seen in people of little sophistication
or self-assertion, and in certain peripheral
conditions of idiocy”; add a fleshy brute
by way of complementation, with an in-
satiable lust to possess the weak and
afflicted; mix in a liberal quantity of
sexuality (both kinds); flavor with
pinches of incest; place in a forbidding,
rocky landscape, which will rumble and
crack when emotion is applied; add a
crumbling old house with suitably sym-
bolic carvings inside; wrap round with
mists and strange lights; and simmer for
one hundred pages or so, gradually in-
creasing the temperature till the ingredi-
ents explode into something profoundly
significant.
“Radcliffe” (genre psychological
Gothic) is such a humorless, pretentious
novel that it’s hard to resist talking of
it in this way. David Storey is a solemn
young novelist who has read Kafka,
Lawrence?, Faulkner, and (I suspect)
William Burroughs; he has read up his
psychopathology too and, in the cur-
rently approved manner, brings all this
to bear on a story in which he seeks to
explore the dilemma of modern man.
But the outcome of this ambitious inten-
tion is a book written to illustrate a num-
ber of vaguely imposing ideas, a novel in
which the main characters never emerge
to convince and to win sympathy for the
human plight they are supposed to dra-
matize. idea is to use Leonard
Radcliffe, his schizoid hero, to represent
the soul, and the gorilla-like Vic Tolson
(who, we are asked to believe, exerts a
fascination over several of the principal
characters) the body, and to depict their
warring and aspiring (?) elements in a
tragic struggle. But this struggle (end-
ing in Tolson’s death at the hands of
Leonard and Leonard’s committal to an
asylum, where he dies prematurely) is
“Castle of Otranto” grotesquerie.
With all Storey’s striving after some
vast allegorical significance (and ideas
for themes certainly run'riot—asceticism
versus worldliness, Catholic versus Pro-
testant, Puritan versus Cavalier, salva-
tion versus damnation, etc.) the domi-
nant impression left is confusion and an
obsession with the nastiness of human-
kind. I say “obsession” because Storey’s
insistence on the repulsive reads like a
morbid fascination (e.g. the latrine
scenes, the sexual degradation Tolson
forces upon Leonard, the obscene dance
of the old man just before his death at
the party) rather than real illumination.
Here and there we get (for what they
are worth) such remarks as “an inscrut-
able sense of guilt”, “Life’s very ugly.
But then death’s not so pleasant either”.
And Leonard at the end regards his own
suffering as paralleling the slow death of
Christ and, even, describes his battle
with Tolson as representing “the split in
the whole of Western Society”! The
trouble is that we can’t believe these
inflated generalizations have been
reached through the novel itself.
It is a relief to turn to Brian Glan-
ville’s “The Rise of Gerry Logan”,
not a world-beater, admittedly, but a
competently written, no-nonsense book.
Gerry is a professional soccer player of
genius; he becomes the pivot on which
any team he plays in turns and is able to
carry his side to the heights of success.
Sociable, self-disciplined in his attitude
towards his profession, and more intelli-
gent than his fellows, he is, nonetheless,
basically self-centred and always search-
ing for a life that eludes him. In Jarrow
he meets and falls in love with Mary,
who breaks up her own married life to
marry him, and they go to live in Lon-
don, where Gerry and Lionel Stone, the
Chiswick team manager, make football
history. Jealousy and intrigue within the

club bring about Stone’s dismissal and
Gerry (at a handsome price) seeks fur-
ther fame on Italian fields. But the
world of Italian soccer is tougher and
far more corrupt than the English and
its vendettas force him back to England,
where he achieves his ambition of bring-
ing his team into a European Cup final;
this match is lost in the final stages of
the game “cheated” out of victory by
a disputed goal. The story ends with
Gerry still playing football though now
well past his prime.
This novel is interesting for the authen-
tic inside picture it gives of the world of
professional football (Glanville is a sports
columnist for “The Sunday Times”) and
for its account of a talented man who
overreaches himself and is corrupted by
success. He says he wants to avoid being
“spoilt”, but all that he does only hastens
the process; the attractive lad of the
opening pages becomes the smug man of
the world, who graduates from sports
columnist to book reviewer and Brains
Trust expert confidently voicing his pla-
titudes on television.
“The Tub’s” chapters deal with the
exploits of the happy-go-lucky Tony,
Jacko, the quiet ex-schoolteacher Steve,
and the amiable corporal, Don. We fol-
low them from Singapore, in a working
party on docks and in warehouses, back
to Changi, and then north to the murder-
ous labor on the Burma railway. By the
time their group has been brought south
again both Don and Jacko have died.
Tony and Steve are then shipped off to
Japan to work in the Nagasaki dockyards
and the Nakarma coalmines. The end
of the war finds them (self-styled specia-
lists) as volunteers for an oil-drilling
squad.
Tony insists on carrying with him
wherever he goes a galvanized-iron tub
he has found in Singapore, which proves
useful in many ways. It becomes too
a sort of tangible symbol, the preserva-
tion of which meant a kind of mental
security to him”, and it gives a suggestion
of unity to a rambling story which, with
all its laconic descriptions of the suffer-
ings of the men, the diseases, and the
bashings from the brutal guards is
curiously lacking in any tension.
Perhaps the undeniably authentic
material that has gone into this book
would have made a greater impact if
cast in the form of a direct documentary.
As it is we are given a would-be novel
that makes certain gestures towards
characterisation but never dwells long
enough on any one figure to make him
interesting; and, since there is no firm
theme, the narrative simply strings a
series of incidents together. As a war
novel it is not in the same class as
Hungerford’s “The Ridge and the River”.
The bane of much Australian fiction
has been the documentation of the group
life, as if there were some intrinsic liter-
ary worth in certain kinds of material.
“The Tub” is one more example of this
approach.

Tn 1924 five men were ready to leave
for the United States from the vil-
lage of Kotoriba in the Medjumurje, a
triangle of country in north-west Croatia
near the Hungarian border, when the US
quota law came into force and blocked
their project. Having made all their ar-
rangements for departure they decided
they would take a ship leaving from
Genoa in three days time for Australia.
They disembarked in Adelaide on
Christmas Eve and next day found lodg-
ings in a Hindley Street boarding house
run by a Maltese. There they met some-
one they could talk to: a Dalmatian
miner on holiday from Broken Hill. He
wanted to take the youngest of the
party back to Broken Hill but the Croats
did not want to separate. The Dalmatian
told them that they might all find work
on the irrigation areas on the Murray
river as some Dalmatians were employed
there.
The five friends took a train to Mor-
gan, wandered across country to the
Berri irrigation district and found a Dal-
matian timber-contractor who had a con-
tract to supply wood for the Berri steam
pump. He lent them a tent and supplies
and took one of them on as a full-time
wood-cutter. The others found jobs on
fruit farms, soon they borrowed a disused
house and had almost continuous agri-
cultural employment.
In mid-1925, after several months
at Berri, they began writing to friends in
the news spread rapidly to
nearby villages. Late in that year more
migrants from the Medjumurje were on
their way to Berri and they subsequently
bought their own farms and spread along
the river as far as Mildura.
By 1947 in the district there were
nearly 200 Medjumurje men, 100 women,
and numerous children born in Australia.
The story of this Medjumurje migration,
told in Charles A. Price’s study, illustrates
a number of its themes. The first of these
is migration’s partly accidental character:
in this case the migrants intended to go
to the USA, not Australia. Once in Aus-
tralia they considered disembarking in
Perth. Even when they did disembark in
Adelaide it was only the chance meeting
with the Dalmatian miner which directed
them towards the irrigation district.
The second related point is that while
local conditions may predispose peQple
towards emigration it is only knowledge
of better conditions overseas which will
make them move in numbers. The “push”
of poverty, persecution, population are
pressures which receive direction from
the “pull” of particular places.
The particular places may be any-
where so it is a mistake to confine a
study of migratory patterns to the recep-
tion country, or to the reception country
and country of origin. Two of the
original five from Medjumurje had been
in the United States while many other
migrants tried Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, the United States before
settling in one of these countries. Others
went from Macedonia to Turkey, then
to Egypt and later moved widely about
Australia before settling.
The emigrants get to know of the par-
ticular places principally through letters
from adventurous friends and this infor-
mation sets the migration chain in mo-

tion. Unless the chain is interrupted by
war or depression it will reveal diverse
settlement stages, the arrival of the pion-
eers; then numerous compatriots who are
willing to move widely to find jobs;
women and children follow and mobility
lessens as families are established; the
fourth stage concerns the behavior of
the second generation educated in Aus-
tralia.
The Medjumurje groups’ migration
and settlement pattern is homogenous and
comparatively simple but Dr Price is
equal to the intricacies of more com-
plex patterns. His subject is migration
from southern Europe to Australia be-
fore 1940 and his treatment is such as
to upset most generalisations and pre-
judices. He first of all studies the geo-
graphic, social and political background
of the emigrants for these condition their
reactions to the new environment This
examination reveals how misleading talk
of “Greek” or “Italian” migration can
be. The Greek migration in the period
studied proved to be migration from a
few places, mainly the islands Kythera,
Kastellarizo, Ithaca and Levkas, as was
Italian migration which, contrary to
popular belief, was mainly from the
north. It makes more sense in such cases
to talk of the villages, districts or regions
which the emigrants left, rather than their
nations.
In the second section of the book Dr
Price concentrates on the migrant in his
new country.
"Southern Europeans in Australia” not
only widens our time, but also our space
perspective. Although it does not set
out to make systematic comparisons, it
does make interesting references to
United States' experience. Migrants in
Australia have not figured nearly as
prominently in political life nor in crime
as those in America. One reason would
be that, in the period surveyed, Austra-
lian migration was mainly a movement
from rural area to rural area whereas
North America received its migrants
when the homestead movement westward
was slowing and industry expanding.
Even allowing for all the differences, the
figures of urban concentrations reveal this
strikingly. In 1920 in Manhattan borough,
New York, there were 200,000 southern
Europeans while San Francisco, smaller
than Melbourne, had 30,000. In 1947,
in central Sydney, there were less than
3000 southern Europeans.
That, of course, was just before the
flood. Although he occasionally sweeps
forward to glance at the behavior of
second and third generations or the re-
sults of the 1947 local Census, in the
main Dr Price confines his attention to
pre-war immigration both for its intrinsic
interest and because, through chain-
migration, it was the foundation of much
of the post-war movement.
Eight years’ work have enabled Dr
Price to produce a fine general academic
study which should be useful when fram-
ing public policy, when future scholar-
ship is undertaken, when a reader aims
to increase his knowledge and under-
standing. The purely demographical and
sociological analyses and statistics have
been grouped in a separate volume which
is of potential use for scholars.

Voyagers
Ancient Voyages in Polynesia. An-
drew Sharp. Angus & Robertson.
28s.
lyjß Sharp has written a great deal
about the Pacific and its exploration,
and critics, some of them irate, have
written a good deal about nis theories,
but the strange thing is that in Australia
for which his books have so much ex-
citing interest he is very little known.
This little volume is a revision, including
answers to critics, of a work first pub-
lished by the Polynesian Society under
the title “Ancient Voyagers in the
Pacific.” It is a logical argument for the
theory that Polynesian settlement of
groups like New Zealand were due to
storm and accident rather than to planned
two-way navigation between islands dis-
tant from each other. Sharp, a former
New Zealand Rhodes Scholar and Indian
Civil Servant, is fast climbing into the
realms in which the great historians of
the Pacific dwell and this book, like his
previous ones, has done a great deal to
help stimulate the study of the origin of
Polynesian “civilisations”. He will do
more as he intensifies his useful studies.

First Reading
Australian Literary Studies. Edited by
L. T. Hergenhan. University of
Tasmania. 12s.
HHhe Cultural Cringer, not recognising
the existence of Australian literature,
may find a journal devoted exclusively
to the learned discussions of inferior
writing absurd. To the Australophil
on the other hand the articles in this first
volume of “Australian Literary Studies”
may not have the proper enthusiasm for
the subject.
Leonie Kramer’s study of the fluctua-
tions of “The Literary Reputation of
Adam Lindsay Gordon” seemed to me
at first a terribly narrow investigation,
since Gordon is only a third-rate Vic-
torian poet if he is set beside Tennyson
and Whitman. But of course in Aus-
tralia he was not, and still is not, seen
in that context. He left a personal myth
and some of his verse was assimilated
into popular culture. As a consequence,
attempts to “place” Gordon critically
have been uneasy and apt to slide from
the “universal” to the “local” frame of
reference. Miss Kramer’s article is more
than a footnote to literary history; it
shows us how our local culture sends
down its roots.
Different problems of the relation of
local to universal value are raised by
Brian Elliott’s review of Hadgraft’s

edition of the first Australian novel,
Henry Savery’s “Quintus Servinton”, a
very rare book until this edition ap-
peared, can have had little influence on
the development of the novel in Aus-
tralia, even though the convict and his
situation have often been written about
since. It is rather the anthropologist’s
culture than literary culture we are con-
cerned with here. Savery, the convict,
was one of Australia’s founding fathers
and one of the very few who were at all
articulate.
Though Australians have come from
many other places than the penal
colonies of Van Diemen’s Land, and our
ancestors were the gaolers as well as the
prisoners, the convict has loomed large
in the national imagination. We still
carry the stigmata in our paradoxical
attitudes to authority, combining trucu-
lent insubordination in some matters
with acceptance of unjustifiable authori-
tarianism in others, like censorship and
licensing hours. The issue of local and
universal value is again plainly relevant
to the discussion of Charles Harpur,
whose biography by J. Normington
Rawling is discussed by A. D. Hope.

Rough & Ready
Larger Than Life. Xavier Herbert.
Angus and Robertson. 275. 6d.
Vavier Herbert’s particular brand of
“larger than life-ness” which, in
“Soldiers’ Women” seemed positively
gross, is in these short stories effective
and controlled. The stories 20 of
them have been written over several
years. Some have been published before.
The colloquial, almost amateurish style,
well suits the characters rough and
ready prospectors, half castes, and small
town dwellers of the northern outback,
battling against uncompromising ele-
ments. “Rise and Fall of Jeremiah
Stacey” is a gem of a story in which is
crystallised the prospector’s constant hope
of finding gold or other riches.
Ac.cording to his preface, Mr Herbert
sees something of himself in the hero of
“Kaijek the Songman,” a story already
acclaimed, in which the greed of a white
man for gold shows up basely against the
innocence of a primitive but creative
aboriginal whose main problem is find-
ing a subject for a new song to preserve
his reputation as a songmaker among the
tribes.
Both the author’s flying knowledge and
his social conscience must have made
him write “An Eagle Called Ned Kelly.”
It’s the story of a fight between a magni-
ficent wedge-tailed Australian eagle and
“flash graziers” hunting him in their
gleaming private planes. While there’s
begrudging praise for the flying skill of
the humans, most of the admiration, and
all of the sympathy, is with the eagle.
Mr Herbert demonstrates in these
stories that he is a natural story teller
who can move and entertain his reader,
and provide the clever and satisfying
twist. The good live happily on, the bad
get their just deserts. But the characters
are real and robust, and the situations
convincing.

The Parting Of The Mist. Lyndon

Aboriginal Australians. Norman Tin-
dale and H. A. Lindsay. Jacaranda
Press. 19s. 6d.
“HThe Parting of the Mist”—a valuable
gift-book for the serious-minded —
has a modem setting interwoven with
Maori lore. It is the story of Tama, de-
scended from the chiefs of Tane Pa
whose forefathers were brought ashore
by a mermaid. When a welfare officer
questioned this story, old Wi-rua retorted
that it was “far more feasible than living
among the digestive juices of a whale”. It
was in similar style that an ancestor of
Tama’s had informed a British officer
that he was moving his fort from the
hills to level ground so that the white
soldiers should not be fatigued before
battle. When the Queen’s representative
did not reply, the chief sent another
letter explaining that he had now built
a road to his fort for the invaders’ con-
venience. With great discourtesy the
British commander waited until he could
bring up cannon and mow the fort flat
from a distance. So chivalry was in the
end as much a loss as the Aborigines’
comparative helplessness.
The motive of “The Parting of the
Mist” is, I think, to show how a modern
Maori must adjust to white ways while
keeping the proud tribal traditions. The
Maori farm is far below the “sweatline”
of the white farmer, for the Maori pre-
fers pig-hunts, feasting, fishing, clam
diving and sociability. The story
follows the lad Tama from the death
of Wi Rua, the paramount chief of
the Tane, until the time Tama
claims the chieftainship. He is a
psychic but otherwise stocky, good-
humored boy. Round him rolls the pan-
orama of Maori life in the beautiful
valley below Ngauruhoe. There are de-
scriptions of country that are painted
from the heart. But Lyndon Rose has
not sentimentalised the Maoris, nor
passed over their aggravating ways, par-
ticularly aggravating to practical people
appointed to supervise their welfare.
Most primitive people regard generosity
as a way of life, and the Maori lives
so that at his funeral the orator shall
have something to chant over him.
In “Aboriginal Australians,” an anthro-
pologist, Norman Tindale, has col-
laborated with a bushman and novelist,
H. A. Lindsay, to produce a short and
comprehensive survey of what is known
of the Aborigines, working forward from
the Ice Age when shrunken seas allowed
them access to this continent.
For a clear, short account of “Abori-
ginal Australians” this book should be
deservedly popular.

A Tightrope for Johnson
IN trying to sort out the likely trend of events under President
Johnson, weight of US opinion now emphasises that the
Johnson regime will leave foreign affairs in the hands of
experts like Secretary of State Dean Rusk while the new
leader concentrates on winning support on the domestic front.
Washington, of course, is keeping its fingers crossed that
outside influences like Mr Khrushchev won’t press too hard
to test the mettle of the new President. Perhaps that may be
too much to hope for. And there is growing evidence on the
domestic front that local interests, after a respectable period
of mourning, are pushing hard to see what advantages can be
gained while Mr Johnson settles in the saddle.
Flippant comment from Washington maintains that Presi-
dent Johnson is ducking for cover on the international front
and there will be no foreign
policy directed from the Presi-
dent’s office. To support this,
it is claimed that the new
President has manoeuvred
Dean Rusk right to the centre
of the stage by emphasising
publicly his confidence in him.
Attention also has been
drawn to the history of the
cold war during Mr Kennedy's
reign where precedents have
been set for advance and re-
treat. It almost could be said
that a clinical case history has
been established on Mr
Khrushchev's reactions, includ-
ing a three-year temperature
chart already laid out to illus-
trate his reaction to pressure
and also to provide warnings
when it is considered expedi-
ent to relieve the pressure. If
the past case history for pres-
sure and compromise has proved successful, Mr Johnson will
not wish to experiment on his own behalf, but rather leave
the established procedure to the Secretary of State. At least
this makes sense until he is forced into another role.
Meanwhile, he has discovered he must appease Congress
on the high rate of Government spending without seeming to
oppose any of the images established by the late President
Kenned>.
While the rest of the nation engages in an emotional state
~,__ & . . ,
of revering the Kennedy name and re-naming such places as
Cape Canaveral, Mr Johnson has had to pacify Senators who
claim that money is being wasted in trying to push defence
projects too fast. So, to pave the way for the tax cuts which
he recognises are vital to the maintenance of economic activity
in 1964 (and which have been counted on and budgeted
against by industry), Mr Johnson has asked for the pruning
shears on space programmes and defence programmes.
New York’s Dow Jones index for industrial shares reached
an all-time high of 763.86 on December 5 compared with
its level at 711.49 on November 22 immediately after Presi-
dent Kennedy’s death. The move expresses faith in President
Johnson’s ability to follow through on the tax cuts legislation.
He has to prepare a record peace-time Budget of possibly
more than 100 billion dollars, yet reassure Congress that it
will obtain full value for every dollar appropriated.
It is not an easy task, because Congressmen have been
accusing the National Aeronautical and Space Administration
(NASA), the Atomic Energy Commission and other Govern-
ment departments of asking for too much money in anticipa-
tion that the cuts by Congress and the Senate would finally
provide the figure they required. This is hardly a new
discovery, because Government departments in most parts of
the world tend to follow the same procedure. But when you
start talking in billions, the unproductive spending on defence
becomes a major issue for taxpayers.
The situation was not help-
ed recently when the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
criticised the spending of
NASA and pointed out that the
number of people employed by
NASA had jumped from 9000
to 32,000 in four years and
that it spent six million dollars
a year on public relations.
The cry for economy is sup-
ported by reports that con-
tractors for space projects
quote low estimates to gain a
contract but the final cost,
with escape clauses, inevitably
exceeds the original estimate.
Those who urge that
America must spend, regard-
less of the cost, in an
endeavor to beat the Rus-
sians were shocked by Secre-
tary of Defence Mr McNam-
ara, who said he welcomed
the 1.8 billion dollars cut in his defence budget and that it
should be possible to expand US military strength without
increases in the defence budget. But what really left the

abandoned if the Russians made another scientific break-
through. And business people are still remembering President
Kennedy’s warning that, without tax cuts, there would be a
US recession in 1964.


Economic Star Still
Bright in USA
"OusiNEss forecasters in the USA claim that President Johnson
stepped into office at a time when the US economic stars
were shining brightly. The stripes may appear later.
Statistics show that US expansion in the latter part of 1963
was stronger than expected. Also, many big industrial cor-
porations have announced important capital expenditure plans
(based on the expected tax cuts).
The pundits are happy to report that the latest upsurge in
US economic activity has not been accompanied, so far, by a
rapid build-up of stocks and rising prices two characteristics
which undermined previous booms.
The carryover of plant investment in 1964 is expected to
sustain the present rate of expansion and maintain the current
annual growth in gross national product of about 5 p.c. The
booming car industry and favorab’ profit reports from
industry have all helped to under-pin Wall Street.
Although moving ahead steadily, the economy is not out-
pacing the labor market, thus helping to keep costs within
reasonable control.
Unemployment and the increase in the labor market can
still supply the labor force necessary for even slightly higher
expansion without causing over-employment.
The major blot at the moment is the serious balance-of-
payments problem and, for this reason, the Kennedy round of
tariff talks next year, designed to provide a general lowering
of world tariffs to encourage greater trade, will become a key
task for the Johnson Administration.
From Sleepy Hollow
to City Satellite?
cause of decentralisation took a small step forward in
A Victoria last week when the Governor, Sir Rohan
Delacombe, turned the valve at the £300,000 Djerriwarrh
Reservoir to supply reticulated water for Melton, which it is
planned to transform from a sleepy country hollow to a
satellite of Melbourne.
The nearest comparison is with Elizabeth, near Adelaide.
Both are about 25 miles from State capitals, but Melton has
a long way to go yet before becoming another Elizabeth.
The key to the transformation of Melton is water. Having
regard to the great demands on the State Rivers and Water
Supply Commission by many other local authorities for water
extensions, the Melton Shire Council decided to go it alone
and then got Mr Bolte's backing.
They found the catchment area best suited within the shire,
and organised the design and construction of a reservoir to
hold 165 million gallons of water. They have reticulated the
flow through 18 and 15 inch pipes to the town area, and
further reticulated eight miles of piping to the town dwellers
and subdivisions for future Meltonians. They got £BO,OOO
from the State Government and the rest of the £300,000 from
Government funds at a rate below bank interest.
The water scheme being controlled by the local authority
will not be subject to periodic restrictions by State Rivers and
Water Supply Commission. The Council intends that further
storage capacity will be provided as the need arises. This will
be achieved by adding to the 60 ft. high retaining wall of the
reservoir.
Melton is convenient to transport routes and industrial
centres. It is a fast nine-mile run from the rapidly developing
Trrdustrial area of Deer Park with its big ICIANZ complex.
A few miles further on toward Melbourne is Sunshine with its
heavy industries.
Melton hopes to attract many of the workers from these
industries to make their homes out of the crowded industrial
areas of the near city. Land prices are within the reach of
these families. Good quality homes with breathing space are
being insisted on by the council.
Melton’s immediate target is to increase its population five-
fold in the next few years. Currently it stands a a little
over 1000.
Mr T. Fogarty, president of the Melton Shire Council, also
hopes to attract industry to the town. “Now that we have
water we can offer some incentive to the industrialists,” he
says. “We have direct rail and road outlets to Melbourne, Gee-
long and Adelaide, and a short run brings the transporter to the
Hume Highway and Sydney and Brisbane outlets.”
Confident Trends Spread
To Retail Trade
Oo many of the conventional economic indicators are dis-
playing an end-of-year ebullience that the National Bank’s
latest Monthly Summary has no difficulty in observing, perhaps
rather staidly, how “the nation may well have good oppor-
tunities for further progress in 1964”.
“Confidence would appear to be stronger and more wide-
spread than for a number of years,” the bank primly remarks.
Of seasonal importance, there seem many signs of record
Christmas retail trading—with hopes of sales moving about
5 p.c. higher than last year’s levels. Some retailers had
their doubts on the basis of November turnovers, feeling these
might show little improvement on November, 1962.
However the official figures for October, just available, do
suggest that retail sales have begun to accelerate on their
relatively slowly rising trend of recent months. While personal
saving is certainly not diminishing, the better employment
position (particularly of married women) and more widely
spread overtime may be providing the prime stimulants.
A readier desire to undertake fresh hire-purchase commit-
ments is also becoming visible.
Anyhow October saw Australia-wide retail sales (excluding
motor vehicles, still undoubtedly buoyant) showing a clear 5.5
p.c. increase on October, 1962, and in fact producing their
best October move since 1960. Total sales went up from
£227.2 million to £239.6 million.
The September quarter total, at £680.5 million, is 5
p.c. ahead of the corresponding 1962 quarter's £648.1
million. So far as individual States are concerned. Queensland
and South Australia made disproportionate advances —8.8
p.c. and 7.3 p.c. respectively. NSW rated a more modest
3.7 p.c. and Victoria 4.7 p.c.
Business Sickness Needs
Strong Medicine
T ast week’s shocking and melancholy procession of company
losses, not all of them by any means attributable to
laggards from the 1960 squeeze, must regrettably call in
question large areas of Australian business morality and skill.
One or two of the losses are perhaps mainly affairs of the
past. Others come to shatter a hitherto rationally confident
present. The pall of inadequate bad-debts’ technique especially
hangs over many other companies too.
The smaller investor may again be forced into scepticism,
more so as he watches the ineffectiveness and comparative
whitewashing of a series of reports on past failings.
A case for putting considerably more bite into Companies
Acts, which seems patently needed to restore both standards
of behavior and confidence, is argued in The Bulletin’s
Forum section on page 30.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Drawcards for Overseas Capital
Australia a Popular Haven for Investment
“T>ractically all countries seeking to
A develop are competing vigorously for
overseas capital and, unless it wants to
fall behind, Australia cannot afford to
be the odd one out,” says the Institute of
Public Affairs in its latest Review after
an exhaustive statistical examination of
the impact of overseas investment on the
economy.
Nor does it think that on the facts and
figures Australia has yet reached the
stage where there need be serious alarm
about the level of overseas ownership or
indebtedness. Its broad conclusion is that
unless we are prepared to take the con-
sequences of a much slower rate of de-
velopment and a lower standard of
living, Australia certainly could not do
without overseas investments.
As for being the odd one out, the
IPA shows that, at any rate, compared
with other countries Australia is being
well served by Britain in the provision
of capital just as we have always been.
It quotes figures (converted to Australian
currency) from the Board of Trade.
These place Australia with £43 million
at the top of the list of countries getting
capital from the UK in 1961. Next to
Australia was, curiously enough, the US
with £27 million, then Canada £22
million, India £lB million, Malaya and
Singapore £lO million and South Africa
£8 million.
In addition to these separate countries
Latin America as a whole got £27
million and Western European countries
£5l million. Of this total of £283
million, Australia’s share was about
15 p.c.
It should be said that these figures do
not include investment in oil and insur-
ance, two fields in which the UK has
for a long time been more active here
than almost anywhere else in the world.
A gainst this, taking figures for 1959,
we get a very much smaller share of
the foreign investment of the United
States, though the figures quoted by the
IPA are only for US foreign investment
in manufacturing here. Adding in bits
and pieces for other investment and
something for official borrowings, our
share would be a little higher than the
4 p.c. we got in that year, but still
a very long way behind Canada’s 47 and
the UK’s 17 p.c. shares. Nonetheless,
when it is considered that the whole
of Latin America, which is on the US’s
doorstep and is generally favored as an
area for US foreign investment, obtained
only 15 p.c. (of which Brazil had 4i p.c.
and Argentina and Venezuela each 2
p.c.), we didn’t do too badly. Moreover,
going on the actual figures for US in-
vestment here, our share looks to have
increased over the last four years.
In commenting on the figures for US
investment, the IPA says it is fairly clear
that American investors are primarily
interested in countries where enough
people have attained a standard of living
sufficient to make large scale manu-
facturing worthwhile; that they are also
attracted by Australia’s political stability
and prospects for future growth; and
that, despite our relatively small popula-
tion, we provide a market as good as, if
not better than, countries with a much
larger population but a lower average
standard of living.
Tt will be very interesting to get the
A break-up of the 1962-63 figures for
capital inflow of private oversea invest-
ment in companies to see if the sub-
stantial increase continued the swing of
the previous year towards US dominance
in the provision of company capital
requirements from oversea sources. The
year to June, 1962, was the first in which
the US provided more capital for com-
panies here than the UK that is, £7l
million compared with £57.3 million
(which was the lowest contribution from
the UK for three years).
It is not certain that the performance
will have been repeated last year but it
may be significant that, whereas the
inflow from the UK was nearly halved
last year (having dropped from £113.7
to £57.3 million), the fall from the US
was only from £87.4 to £71.3 million.
This still left the US total well above its
£62.8 million in 1959-60 when the UK
contributed £105.4 million. At any rate,
anyone would expect to find a big in-
crease from both sources last year when
net overall capital inflow rose from £B7
to £2BB million. (This was inclusive of
the balancing item in the balance of pay-
ments accounts which is given as minus
£lB million for 1961-62, but has not so
far been identified for last year.)
Perhaps the IPA has spent rather too
much time trying to satisfy its readers
that the rising strains of servicing over-
seas capital inflow are not intolerable,
and not enough time in showing that we
are a long way off being the odd one
out among developing countries in the
provision of overseas capital. The inflow
(including balancing item) of £2BB
million last year appears to have been
exceeded only in 1960-61, and even that
is by no means certain because the
balancing item in a total of £331 million
that year was £ll3 million. The im-
pression is that we are as popular a
haven as any in the world for overseas
capital and are becoming increasingly so.
JJUlking about the strains on the bal-
ance of payments of servicing over-
seas capital invested here, the IPA
demonstrates that, contrary to general
opinion, we are in a better position than
ever before to meet interest and dividend
payments and allow for some repatria-
tion of overseas debt without embarrass-
ment to the balance of payments.
Last year interest paid on overseas
debt was only 2i p.c. of the year’s over-
seas receipts while dividend remittances
took 5 p.c., a total of 7+ p.c. The IPA
points out that in 1931 the total per-
centage of these two items came to 42
p.c. of current overseas receipts.
However, on this it will be remem-
bered that 1931 was a dismal export
year. On the other hand, the percentage
in 1950 was only 6, but if we have
worsened a little since then on a per-
centage basis, again it must be remem-
bered that 1950 was a bumper export
year. Statistical percentages can be
deceptive.
But the IPA’s conclusion seems
reasonable enough. “It seems beyond
the bounds of possibility that overseas
commitments could ever again reach the
frightening proportions of 1931 when
export income collapsed. Our economy
is more diversified and less reliant on
wool and wheat. Profits payable over-
seas do not appear to be growing so
much faster than current overseas in-
come as to pose a threat to the balance
of payments, for the time being at any
rate. Undistributed profits, which were
the equivalent of 11 p.c. of overseas
receipts in 1929 and 2 p.c. in 1931, were
4 p.c. last year. They are really a
permanent capital investment and be-
come a charge on overseas income only
in the unlikely event of repatriation of
capital. Dividends as a proportion of
overseas earnings (5 p.c. last year) have
still not regained 1929 levels (they were
6} p.c. in 1929 and 8 p.c. in 1931)”.
In answer to the question whether the
share of total national production com-
mitted to servicing overseas investment
is rising very rapidly, the IPA gives a
blunt “no”, fully supported by figures.
The proportion of Gross National
Product represented by interest and
dividends paid overseas fell last year
from 1.3 to 1.2 p.c., the same per-
centage as in the two previous years. In
1954 it was 1.4 p.c.


“CROESUS”
Investment by 1970
Will the Small Investor he Won Back?
A survey of share ownership in Aus-
tralia would probably show not only
that the institutions have greatly increas-
ed their holdings in the last ten years,
but that between them they own a high
proportion of total Australian share-
holdings and that their influence in
sharebuying is decisive in the market
trend. It seems quite safe to make
these assumptions. Such an analysis
was carried out in Britain some years
ago, but it has never been done here.
Though the Australian stock exchanges
would like to think so, the democratisa-
tion of share ownership has not proceed-
ed very fast in this country. Indeed, as
a result of the boom and bust in share
markets here in 1960, the public’s inter-
est in share buying received a severe
setback from which it has not since
recovered.
Stock exchanges have a herculean
task to win the public back. Their
educational efforts seemed to lapse in
the recession and the public hasn’t been
treated to any share buying propaganda
from the exchanges for a long time, even
if some members have been having a
go on their own account.
Possibly the proportion of total share-
holdings held by the institutional investor
—that is, the whole gamut of life com-
panies, unit trusts, superannuation funds
and so on—is not as high here as in
Britain but the implications for invest-
ment are probably much the same in
both countries.
This brings me to what must have
been a unique discussion between a
panel arranged by the “Investor’s Chron-
icle” and some 250 stockbrokers from
Manchester and Liverpool, held recently
at the Midland Hotel in Manchester on
the far-ranging subject of “Investment
by 1970”.
It was interesting to learn that a
speaker said that though the proportion
of their funds being invested by UK
institutions in equities was increasing,
there had also been a proliferation of
small private holdings which were per-
sistently edging up the proportion of
shares owned by small investors.
So in Britain you have a double-
edged influence, with the institutions on
one side and the small, private investor
on the other, being exerted on the invest-
ment scene, especially on company
boards.
This double influence is apparently
stronger there than here. The impres-
sion is given, though, that the institu-
tions are much the stronger and in
effect act in a trustee capacity for the
small investor in face of the grow-
ing strength of company boards.
Talking of the growing strength of
company boards, Harold Wincott envis-
aged them being much stronger by 1970
—“directors will be more specialised and
their companies more complex”. That
will happen here, too. Mr Wincott pities
the poor investor who, standing up at
a company meeting in 1970, will be
afraid to pose an inane question. Will
the questioner at company meetings—a
rare bird here unless there’s a crisis in
the company—be as rare in 1970? And
will he be better informed?
The relation between institutional in-
vestors and these increasingly powerful
boards in Britain, as revealed at the
Manchester meeting, is interesting. The
panel agreed that the growth of the in-
stitutions with large slices of their port-
folios in equities is impressive, but opin-
ions differed on the pace of their future
growth.
They may consult together (not so
common, perhaps, among our own in-
stitutions) but their decisions are arrived
at independently. They thus make a
two-way market in the same way as
small investors do. They want good
management and do not interfere with
boards unless things go badly wrong.
T'he pressure there, as here, is on
boards to achieve better accounting
standards and early advice to sharehold-
ers on any fundamental change in the
company’s business. There is also pres-
sure for turnover figures “to prevent un-
due weight being attached to any one
of a company’s activities”, and on
directors to dispel both their caginess in
preferring not to let slip more than is
necessary and their belief that it is good
and moral to understate, yet wrong and
immoral to attempt a fair valuation.
The latter would seem to apply also
in Australia where very little is heard of
interventions in company affairs by insti-
tutions. This suggests that individual
institutions probably spread their share
investments over too wide a field, and
that very few have a big enough pro-
portion of any one company’s shares
to be able to wield any great influence.
This observation would not apply to the
investment bankers here, though these
are not properly in the class of insti-
tutions. Some of these investment bank-
ers dominate a range of companies,
DFC for instance.
Leading UK investment counsellor Mr
A. G. Ellinger told the meeting he
thought the behavior of the market in
1970 would be very much like it was
now. What happened to the shares
would depend not on what the company
was doing, but on the expectations of
holders and potential owners of the
shares. But investment would be much
more scientific seven years from now,
just as it was far more scientific and
competitive now than it was seven years
ago.
AWA Still a Good Buy
its 1960-61 recession trough
AWA bounded to a record profit
level in the latest year to June 30. It
was able with minimum discomfort to
service capital expanded appreciably by
notes conversion.
Earning rate eased marginally from
26.6 to 26.1 p.c. in the latest term, while
absolute profit moved up 32 p.c. from
£592,451 to £782,490.
The company’s 50th year was gilded
for shareholders by a 6 p.c. bonus on
top of basic dividend of 10 p.c. For
the two previous recessed years, dividend
had been cut from 16 to 14 p.c.
Directors make no public forecast for
1964-65 results. Like so many others in
the field, they have found the market for
consumer products subject to rapid
change. However, AWA’s business is
buttressed by electronic products for
industry, and by broadcasting and tele-
casting investments.
In 1960-61 AWA sold its holdings in
ATN Channel 7 to John Fairfax for a
capital profit of £519,245, part of which
was reserved for commercial develop-
ment. At present the company has
£818,287 in this reserve.
A £187,500 equity in United Tele-
casters Sydney Ltd might produce a
similar capital profit, though probably
not of the same magnitude.
AWA’s reserve position is extremely
strong, and almost £2 million is left in
profit and loss account as well as over
£2 million in general reserve.
The last bonus was a one-for-one in
August. 1956, a month before the con-
vertible note issue was made. Now that
that issue has matured, the decks are
clear for another distribution within a
year or two, depending probably on the
consumer goods market and the profit-
ability of new telecasting investments.
The ss. shares are now more highly
valued (around 265. 6d.) than at any
time this year, and holders could rightly
expect another big lick at the reserves
sometime relatively soon. There is still
a few shillings margin for profitable
entry.


MARKET POINTERS
Finance & Guarantee Rumors
An irate shareholder in FINANCE &
GUARANTEE last week showed
The Bulletin some share transfers
covering his purchase of shares after the
directors announced on October 18 that
“negotiations were proceeding with a
view to the possibility of a cash offer
being made for the purchase of the com-
pany’s shares.”
Names of the sellers, at prices from
ss. 7d. down to 55., bore the name of
Potts, and were presumed to be relatives
of the ex-director, Mr R. G. Potts, who
resigned on September 6.
They can’t be too confident of any
takeover, claimed the one-time hopeful
buyer of Finance & Guarantee shares.
In checking this out, however, it was
suggested to us that the volume of share
selling was relatively small and the
persons concerned need not necessarily
be intimate confidants of the ex-chair-
man and managing director. Moreover,
as Mr Potts had resigned before the
announcement, there was nothing to
support any claim that Mr Potts was
aware of the circumstances surrounding
any projected takeover.
In fact, no takeover offer has been
made, it is understood. However, a very
thorough investigation has been com-
pleted by an independent auditor, which
could form the basis of an offer, we are
informed.
The market has not taken kindly to
the rumor that possibly 7s. or Bs. could
be offered for F. & G.’s ss. shares. Prices
have remained limp and there appear to
be more sellers around than buyers.
In answer to a rumor that the take-
over approach was merely a kite-flying
gesture by interested parties to keep the
shares up, we were assured by the com-
pany’s secretary that a thorough in-
vestigation had been made by an out-
side accountant on behalf of an unnamed
client.

T>lacing the blame for the sorry losses
A of the AUSTRALIAN FACTORS
group is a difficult thing to do without
knowing all the minor details.
Those who said that factoring of
accounts w’«.y dangerous, unless the
factoring company had final recourse to
the client for bad debts, now can nod
their heads sagely and say, “I told you
so”.
The situation proves again that with-
out a very strict, efficient internal audit,
items can escape the notice of manage-
ment.
And, in the case of Australian Factors,
it has been suggested that the manage-
ment was so busy in floating off inter-
state companies, organising outside
borrowings, and encouraging a share-
holder interest from influential backers
like AUC, there was little time to go
down the line and check every trans-
action. Certain members of the board
also had to spend time in trying to un-
ravel the problems of Palgrave Corp.
Excuses can always be found, but they
are of little satisfaction to shareholders.
The investigation and write-offs have
been severe, so that doubtful items will
not cause trouble in the future.
But there is another aspect on client
relations and future business. Once
having been placed in such a situation,
the company and its subsidiaries face
problems of winning back goodwill.
Also, while going through a bad
period, the interest on company borrow-
ings keeps mounting.
If all doubtful items can be provided
against, the company should stage a
recovery. But it will be a slow process
compared with the rapid mushrooming
of activities which greeted Australian
Factors when it made its debut.

K. Gray (Holdings) Ltd,
Sydney auctioneer and furniture re-
tailer, surprised the market by reporting
a 40 p.c. drop in net profit, although
holding the dividend at 15 p.c.
Part of the explanation is the higher
tax provision which rose from £3862 to
£8653 and a slightly larger depreciation
provision.
But profit must have been affected in
other directions and those shareholders
who bought the shares on the strength of
the previous year’s 36 p.c. earning rate
won't be too happy to see the latest
profit come out at 21.7 p.c. on capital.
Doubless the directors will have more
to say when the full accounts appear and
at the annual meeting.
From outside observation, the auction-
eering business is thriving, so if the
shares fall back as a reaction to the latest
profit, perhaps they may be worth pick-
ing up for a recovery.

Tan Jacoby’s show, READY CREDIT
LTD of Perth, shyly produced a
profit of £l5B for its first nine months’
operations to November 30, after writing
off all known bad debts, a fifth of the
debenture issue expenses, and also pro-
viding for doubtful debts.
Outstandings are above £600,000 and,
with the ss. shares already listed in the
eastern States, it would not be surprising
to see further expansion here.
The fact that the shares sell at Is.
premium suggests that the market is
confident that Mr Jacoby, ex-1 AC, ex-
Custom Credit, will get this show on
the road, too.

VTorth Broken Hill and BROKEN
HILL SOUTH have received plenty
of attention from speculators and buyers
of call options since reports started
circulating on the prospects of the Kan-
rnantoo copper deposit, 30 miles from
Adelaide.
Drilling already has indicated a
copper lode of variable width up to
400 ft. and the operating company,
Mines Exploration Pty Ltd may be on
to a promising area. BH South holds
51 p.c. interest, North BH holds 191
p.c. and both hold a further interest
through the ore treatment company
Electrolytic Zinc, which owns 191 p.c.
interest.
The other 10 p.c. is held by McPhar
Geophysics, of Canada.
There is a great deal of testing to be
done before the area can support some
of the wild stories that have gone around
in recent weeks.
But, allied with the stronger overseas
prices for metals, the share market has
suddenly re-discovered the Barrier com-
panies.
Massey-F. 45 p.c. Jump
■pxcELLENT agricultural and pastoral
conditions throughout most of Aus-
tralia brought a 16 p.c. sales increase and
a 45 p.c. profit increase for Massey-
Ferguson Holdings (Australia) Ltd, farm
machinery manufacturers, in the year to
October 31, 1963.
Favorable seasons and successful dis-
posal of export surpluses, and marked
progress in mechanised sugar cane
harvesting contributed to higher sales of
tractors, tillage and harvesting machinery.
The ordinary capital, doubled to
£5,132,460 by a one-for-one bonus in
September, is held by Massey-Ferguson
of Canada.

OIL CORNER
More Emphasis on Gas
T>oral Ltd, always active to protect
its outlets, has made a cash offer
for Towers Gas and Coke Co. Ltd, of
Charters Towers (Q.). This is an in-
teresting development, because it was
made through Gas Supply Co. Ltd, of
Melbourne, which was brought under
the Boral wing in November by a share
exchange deal.
If discoveries of natural gas continue
at the rate currently being achieved by
oil exploration groups such as ASSOCI-
ATED OIL, the future harnessing of
these natural gas supplies must affect
many of the big industrial concerns,
either as competitors or as potential
users of fuel or power supplies.
Some of the big mining and industrial
projects planned for Queensland will
require large supplies of cheap power,
and already it is being suggested that
natural gas should be the logical answer.
The initial capital cost of linking up this
cheap source of power, however, be-
comes a major problem, and the process
cannot be achieved overnight.
Looking farther into the future, and
using overseas examples as a guide, it is
quite reasonable to expect the develop-
ment and use of natural gas, even as
a supplementary source of supply.
Sufficient quantities must be proved,
of course.

ILf id-Eastern Oil NL came out last
week with a report of gas and oil
cut mud at its Sextonville No. 1 well at
the 3872 to 3945 ft. level.
The area is about 16 miles from the
Kyogle No. 1 well in the Clarence River
Basin, NSW, which also provided some
evidence of oil and gas.
In the early days of oil exploration
in Australia a report of gas and oil cut
mud would stimulate the speculators, but
the market now is much more sophisti-
cated. It wants something more definite.
Mid-Eastern is seeking a link with
overseas partners and the company re-
ports that discussions on this subject
shortly will be held in Melbourne.
A discovery by a relatively new com-
pany like Mid-Eastern certainly would
enliven the oil exploration groups at the
moment, because a succession of dry
holes is bad for morale, particularly the
morale of the cash-paying public.
Earlier this year Mid-Eastern planned
an exploration programme in the Surat
Basin in an area held jointly with Cali-
fornia Asiatic Oil and Texaco Overseas
Petroleum. Both these overseas com-
panies held a 27 1 p.c. interest, with a
5 p.c. royalty going to Woodside.
Of the money sunk into oil search, a
great deal comes from overseas oil
companies, without which the costly ex-
ploration programmes would never get
started.
Assuming Mid-Eastern succeeds in
linking up with an overseas partner, its
3s. paid contributing shares at around
2s. 4d. could be of some interest to
the speculator.
★ ★ *
Another oil exploration company in-
terested in the success of Mid-
Eastern is WOODSIDE (LAKES EN-
TRANCE) OIL, because it owns 20 p.c.
of Mid-Eastern’s capital and also retains
a 5 p.c. royalty in several of Mid-
Eastern’s exploration areas, plus a 50
p.c. interest in the 16 million acres in
the Carpentaria Basin, Queensland.
Apart from its own Gippsland Basin,
Murray Basin and WA offshore interests,
therefore, Woodside has a 5 p.c. royalty
stake in the Great Artesian Basin, the
Surat Basin, the Clarence River Basin
(all in NSW) and a 50 p.c. working
interest in the Carpentaria Basin, Queens-
land.
For this reason there are plenty of oil
speculators who consider that Woodside’s
3s. shares at around 2s. 6d. offer a wide
spread of interest.
★ * *
A Sydney sharebroker has published
a circular on oil shares suggesting
that if speculators wish to gain an inter-
est covering most parts of Australia with
only a modest outlay, only three com-
panies need be purchased. He names
ALLIANCE PETROLEUM, AMPOL
EXPLORATION and ASSOCIATED
CONTINENTAL. ■ '
The three represent an interest in all
States except Tasmania. His theory is
that if an oil strike occurs, the company
with an interest closest to the strike will
benefit. If there is a strike, he reasons
that the client can retain the share vt ’hose
area is closest to the strike and sell the
other two on the generally buoyant
market created by the strike.
★ ★ ★
JJhtE high cost of oil search in Papua,
including the problems of transport,
etc., no doubt causes some hesitation by
various large oil groups to become a
partner of OIL SEARCH LTD.
The long history of the area is open
for inspection and the withdrawal in
1961 of the major partners, BP Explora-
tion and Vacuum, no doubt creates some
reluctance with prospective partners. But
oil exploration is such a tricky business
that many a discovery has been made
after the recognised experts have sunk
millions in fruitless search.
It could prove that way with Oil Search
Ltd. However, a big political question
mark would be raised if discovery of oil
made Papua an even more desirable
territory.

Getting Out of the Pit?
Coal and Allied Meets Fuel Imbalance
HThe chairman of Coal and Allied In-
dustries, Mr W. Howard - Smith,
dutifully echoed the Joint Coal Board’s
strictures on substitute fuels at last
week’s annual meeting. If anything he
spoke more feelingly, as befits the head
of a company whose output and trading
profit both suffered during 1962-63.
Australia’s fuel pattern is “out of
balance”, Mr Howard-Smith maintained.
“Although a large proportion of our
petroleum products are now refined in
Australia from imported crudes, the
production of fuel oil is greatly in excess
of our needs and yet increasing quantities
of petrol have to be imported. The result
is that large quantities of fuel oil are
dumped on to the Australian market at
any price which will oust the indigenous
coal.”
As it had to be admitted, however,
CAlL’s 15 p.c. production decline (an
actual 357,000 tons) was brought about
entirely by lower demand from Japan.
There the 1962 industrial recession,
officially imposed on an “overheated”
economy, led to the familiar import re-
strictions and “the granting of prefer-
ences to the products of local mines”.
Exports went back from 813,000 to
324,000 tons. While investigating other
export markets, directors still confess
that Japan represents the best long-term
outlet.
Domestic sales are being “well main-
tained" and CAIL can look forward to
the trebling of its quota for Vales Point
Power Station by early 1965. Provisions
for plant and development, now totalling
£1,313,117, provide a degree of pro-
ductive mobility “in producing from
various pits in accordance with the re-
quirements of the market from time to
time”.
Though Mr Howard-Smith sums up
1962-63 as “another satisfactory year
of trading” (consolidated net profit
slipped only £4593 to £493,267) and the
usual 10 p.c. dividend was held, investors
continue to view prospects rather charily.
The ss. shares hover around 7s. 6d.
to yield 6.6 p.c. with earnings yield just
a trifle higher at 6.7 p.c. Prices have
been up to 9s. 2d. in 1963 and 11s.
during 1962. Ruling levels barely keep
above the two-year low at 7s. sd.
Perhaps there’s a deal of waiting to
see how coal handles an abundancy of
marketing problems. In the meantime
Bellambi is best regarded of the listed
companies, the ss. shares at 12s. 3d.
yielding 4.1 p.c., earnings yield being
at 5.9 p.c.
Anti Friction Floats
TAestined to be listed in Melbourne
soon are 180,000 ss. ordinary shares
in Anti Friction Bearings Ltd, Victorian
ball and roller bearing supplier. They
will be placed shortly at ss. 2Td., plus
brokerage and stamp duty, and under-
written by A. C. Goode & Co. in con-
junction with a £55,000 8 p.c. registered
mortgage debenture issue (redeemable at
par 1970) by the same company. Tax
reasons are given for making the float,
while the debenture issue is to supple-
ment working capital.
Dividends of 8 p.c. are forecast on
the ordinary shares. Last year’s earnings
rate based on a profit of £22,964 is given
in the prospectus as 12.1 p.c. on present
capital of £190,000 compared with equi-
valent rates of 10.5, 3.3 and 3.7 p.c. in
the three previous years adjusted to the
present capital. Capital has increased
from £13,806 in March 1959 to the
present figure partly as a result of bonus
issues, including a one-for-one in 1959
and a four-for five in June 1960.
Anti Friction Bearings, whose chair-
man in Mr H. R. Syme, is one of our
leading suppliers of medium size bear-
ings. Its main supplies come from Pol-
lard Ball and Roller Bearing, of the UK,
and Steyr-Daimler-Puch, of Austria.
Most of them are outside the range of
tariff restrictions on bearings and do not
compete with local products.
The bulk of the company’s sales are
in Victoria to agricultural and general
machinery industries and 25 p.c. to the
motor industry. The business has expand-
ed enormously in recent years and sales
are currently running at more than
£500,000 a year.
Losses for Mick Simmons
IJ'ew directors at Mick Simmons (Hold-
ings) Ltd, Sydney sporting goods
retailer, have taken a critical look at
the whole business, and it appears to
have made significant progress in re-
organisation.
A cool appraisal of stocks and debts
resulted in the writing off or provision
of £62,583 against this year’s trading
results, reduction in stock values of
£50,350, and the write-off of £13,158 in
various abnormalities.
Net result for the year, including
these write-offs, was a debit to profit and
loss appropriation account of £137,782.
The new chairman (Sir Arthur Warner)
concluded that although a loss had been
declared only for 1961-62, the company
had, in fact, been operating at a trading
loss for a number of years.
Group activities have been reorganised
into three trading subsidiaries, plus the
Canberra business, for greater financial
control. Mick Simmons Ltd operates
the retail branches and Haymarket
ground floor, Mick Simmons Wholesale
Pty Ltd operates the wholesaling of
sporting goods, and Mick Simmons
Tobacco Pty Ltd looks after the tobacco
wholesaling and cigarette vending opera-
tions.
The ss. shares are now valued by the
market at about 35., compared with
around 4s. 4d. late last year when Sir
Arthur Warner (of Electronic Industries
Ltd) and his associates bought about

More R.M. Repercussions
third successive year of heavily
reduced profits for Crystal Clothing
Industries Ltd leads the casual observer
to the conclusion that tough marketing
conditions are here to stay.
In fact, the year to June 30, 1963,
saw a marked deterioration in profit
because of the conclusion that it was
necessary to write off £40,000 against
the Reid Murray group account as being
irrecoverable.
The net profit after this write-off was
£7919, so reserves were called upon to
pay £33,000 out to shareholders. Ordin-
ary dividends were 12} p.c. for the third
year running, and in that period the
company has had £lOO,OOO in 8 p.c.
redeemable preference capital to service
as well.
Crystal has factories at Belmore
(Sydney), Wollongong and Dapto in
NSW, making “clothing for the entire
family”.
A smallish company by Stock Ex-
change standards, it used to command
great respect in investment circles, but
obviously the rewards are not in this
business any more. Although turnover
in 1962-63 was a record, business trans-
acted was subject to keen competition.
In placing this stock on a yield of
7.3 p.c. (price Bs. 6d.), the market shows
serious doubts about it even as an income
stock.
Plenty of Voltage
Storage Battery’s ss. shares
have retreated a little from the
17s. 6d. two-year peak, posted only in
October last. Still, at prevailing levels
close to 16s. 6d., they stay very well
regarded, yielding 4.5 p.c. on a 15 p.c.
dividend paid since 1961. Earnings yield
is a comforting 7.8 p.c.
Any renewal of investment pressure
need not surprise, . especially after
digestion of remarks made by the chair-
man, (the former Mr Justice A. V. Max-
well) to the annual meeting.
He was able to point to an all-time
high, pre-tax profit and a net figure up
from £108,690 to £119,035. Then came
the significant addition that since June
30, both sales and profits have moved
forward again.
The group has been esteemed for its
enterprising move into Malaya and Mr
Maxwell could indicate another success-
ful year for the Malayan company,
garnishing this with the opinion that “its
future should be advantaged by the in-
auguration of Malaysia.”
Not even the rising costs of principal
raw materials, lead and zinc, appear to
get directors down, though in a com-
petitive market they are naturally giving
these matters serious attention. The tariff
has assisted them with process engravers’
zinc sheets, in straight competition with
imports.
Cheer for William Adams
professionals cheered William
Adams and Co. Ltd, a Sydney steel
merchant, for presenting precise profit
figures for the October half-year (up 33
p.c.), but the 20s. shares, if anything,
eased a little.
The notes, however, were sought
with little success as the sellers
demanded higher and higher prices.
Assuming a 12} p.c. dividend is paid
this year, and 15 p.c. resumed in 1964-
65, the income difference between shares
and notes until the notes convert on
April 30, 1965, and rank equally with
old shares, is approximately 3s. Bd. in
favor of the shares.
Record profits appear to be attain-

ance. They will be asked for their

holder, Fox Film Corporation, has

theatres and has investments in tele-
casting.

ful in Australia, as it is overseas. They

Quality Store Chain Spreads
Across Australia
David Jones 9 Due for Returns from Growth
By ROGER RANDERSON
YJUithout any diminution of its domin-
ant position as Sydney’s greatest re-
tailer, “DJs” during the past 10 years
has assembled a chain of 16 departmental
stores stretching from Perth to Cairns,
which offer quality and service at high
international standards.
As indicated by the recent acquisition
of Bolands of Cairns (Queensland) the
phase of expansion is far from ended, but
it is likely to proceed from now on at a
reduced tempo, with increased emphasis
on modernisation and consolidation.
The company never wavered in its faith
in Australia’s future, even during the re-
cent recession, so that it is well placed
to profit from the present rising tide of
prosperity.
Earnings have been well maintained
at more than twice the dividend rate of
12} p.c. paid for the past five years,
despite problems incidental to re-build-
ing, integrating and modernising many
stores.
For several reasons one would ex-
pect David Jones’ to improve on last
year’s earning rate of 27.4 p.c. in the
current trading period, which ends on
July 31, 1964.
The magnificent new store which has
been built round the old Charles Birks
acquired in 1955 at Adelaide should be
fully run in.
Unlike last year, a full 12 months’
quota of earnings should be received
from the Monaro Mall at Canberra and
the Warringah Mall at Brookvale set
in prosperous, rapidly-expanding areas.
While time will be needed to tap the
full potential of the Marsh & Webster
store acquired last July at Mackay, David
Jones’ is now extremely well-placed to
share in the new wave of prosperity that
the sugar, pastoral and mining industries
are bringing to Queensland.
In Brisbane it is firmly entrenched
with the businesses that were Finney
Isles and T. C. Beirne, in Townsville
with the former McKimmins, besides the
Mackay and Cairns stores already men-
tioned.
Western Australia is another of the
smaller States which is launched on a
path of rapid expansion, and DJs is there
with the Bon Marche store acquired in
1954.
Good results can also be expected this
year from Scotts at Newcastle and Walter
Lance at Wollongong, nourished by the
thriving steel industry, as well as from
the David Copland store at Wagga, which
was the first to be acquired when David
Jones’ sallied forth from its Sydney
tripod to begin building its far-flung em-
pire.
And what about the Sydney businesses,
the three great stores that constitute
part of the city’s very heart and the
factories making clothing and Selby’s
shoes?
David Jones’ has never subscribed to
alarmist talk about the strangulation of
the city, although its chairmen have pres-
sed for obvious reforms such as better
traffic arrangements and the lessening of
rates and taxes which are double the bur-
den imposed by authority on Melbourne’s
stores.
The splendid new store at Parramatta
and the store in the Warringah Mall have
been designed to catch some of the drift
of trade to shopping by car in the sub-
urbs. A similar purpose lies behind the
proposed leasing of the dominant posi-
tion in the new shopping centre soon to
be erected in the expanding area of
Bankstown.
But it is remarkable how the parent
company has managed to increase its
city trade, despite vigorous competition,
especially since the Melbourne Myer in-
vaded Sydney with the acquisition of the
formerly high-class Farmer’s.
The addition of new departments and
the entry into furnishings with the accent
still on “quality and service’’ have
probably made some inroads into Myer’s
Sydney stores, besides Beard Watson, now
owned by Nock and Kirby.
Flow much the parent company has

sustained the increase and modernisation
of subsidiaries is shown by the following
figures of trading profit in the past three
years:—
TRADING PROFIT (£’000)
Parent Subs.
1960- 7,327 3,523
1961- 7,630 4,853
1962- 8,037 6,043
At the same time, it is from the con-
tinuance of the marked upward trend
in trading profit from subsidiaries that
improvement in the company’s earning
rate commensurate with the vast capital
outlays of recent years must be expected.
David Jones’ has relied heavily on
share exchanges on well judged terms
to sustain assets backing of its shares,
together with a large retention of earn-
ings to finance its expansion.
Nevertheless, the company had to call
on shareholders for a one-for-four issue
of 10s convertible notes in 1961, and
again for a one-for-six issue of ss. stock
units at 3s. premium this year.
The 1961 issue of £2,691,003 notes
will be converted to £1,364,296 of
ordinary shares on August 1, 1964, such
shares ranking for dividend only from
that date.
Ordinary paid-up capital, which had
been £2,057,000 in July, 1955, will thus
have been increased to £8,880,749 at
the start of the company’s next financial
year, allowing for the issue to acquire
Bolands, and assuming no further issues
before then.
A lthough the company will save
£123,420 a year interest on the
conversions, maintenance of the 12} p.c.
dividend on the increased capital will
require £209,494 more than last year at
£1,121,859.
A substantial rise in earnings of almost
£500,000 will thus be required to main-
tain last year’s 27.4 p.c. earning rate.
But I consider that this should be well
within the company’s capacity in existing
circumstances.
The financial strain of rapid expansion
is lessening, as is seen in the fact that
commitments for uncompleted con-
tracts amounted to only £490,000 at
last balancing date, compared with
£1,250,252 at the end of the previous
year.
Among remaining plans are enlarge-
ment of the George Street store and
modernisation including the installation
of escalators to the sixth floor.
The Wollongong store is to be rebuilt
to cover four times its present area.
Brisbane’s T. C. Beirne store is to be
further modernised to include a large
parking . station, while new departments
are being added to the Finney Isles store
in the same city.
The proposed Bankstown store will be
leased, so that the chief capital costs will
be for installations and stocking.
Last year’s increase in mortgages
(-(-£1,841,000) may be a pointer to in-
creased reliance on long-term borrow-
ings, for which the great inner reserve
of under-valued freeholds offers con-
siderable scope, besides increased use of
bank overdrafts.
Shareholders received a 78 for a 100
bonus issue in November, 1957, after
which the dividend was reduced from
15 to 10 p.c., with partial restoration
to the present 12} p.c. rate in 1959.
Price of the ordinary stock unit fell
from 18s. 7d. to 10s. after the bonus
issue in 1957. It recovered to a peak of
265. 6d. before the depressive measures
of 1960 and fell back to a low point of
15s. 9d. in 1962.
There has been a steady firming ten-
dency from this year’s low point of 18s.
to about 21s. 9d. at the time of writing.
TAj’s shares represent very safe invest-
ment, with assets backing for its
small preference issues as high as
£33 15s. 2d., £2O 14s. Id. and
£8 7s. Bd. respectively.
This excludes goodwill, which was
completely written out of the books in
1962, and does not allow for market
appreciation in a large part of the free-
holds that continue to appear in the
books at cost.
Similarly, the apparent net tangible
assets backing for each ordinary ss.
stock unit is conservatively placed at
about 13s. 6d., showing a decrease from
14s. 7d. in the past year.
At the present price of 21s. 9d. a
share one pays about 335. in the £ for
book value of tangible assets and about
seven times last year’s earnings for good-
will.
Earnings yield of 6.3 p.c. is encourag-
ing, despite the low dividend yield of
only £2 18s. for each £lOO invested.
It is difficult to see any immediate
prospect of additional benefits, although
without obvious further scope for re-
valuation of assets, there is sufficient in
share premium and revaluation reserves
totalling £2,358,667 for a one-for-four
bonus issue on ordinary capital and
convertible notes.
DJs is a fine growth stock whose
potentialities for shareholders depend on
its children making an increasing con-
tribution of profits to compensate for the
parent’s investment in their future.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Another Bonus from Humes Soon?
Capital Expenditure About to Pay Off
By “ANALYST”
the last few weeks, Humes Ltd’s
shares have been rising again. Eight
weeks ago, the last sale of the week was
80s. 6d., but five weeks earlier sales had
taken place at 89s. The last sale at the
time of writing is 84s. 6d. The capital
profit made over this period after allow-
ing for brokerage and stamp duty would
have been at the rate of H p.c. per an-
num and is certainly a great improvement
on the 3i p.c. yield that would be ob-
tained from holding the shares and re-
ceiving dividends.
It seems very clear that at the price
levels which have been current for most
of 1963 (i.e., in excess of 795.) another
bonus issue is expected. The last such
issue was made in March, 1958, and the
previous one in July, 1951. But the latter
was the second bonus issue in 12 months.
Maybe it is significant that the bonus
issue in November, 1950, was in the ratio
of l-for-2, in July, 1951, l-for-3 and in
March, 1958, l-for-4. Perhaps on this
basis we can expect the next bonus issue
to be in November, 1964, in the ratio
of l-for-5.
On the basis of present capital such
an issue would involve the withdrawal
of about £718,300 from asset revalua-
tion or share premium reserves and the
amount to the credit of the share pre-
mium reserve would amply cover this
amount. Furthermore, the company went
to some pains to point out in 1961 that
its freehold property was capable of being
revalued to the extent of £ 1 million.
T>efore a bonus issue that will result
** in real benefits to shareholders can
be made, it is essential that earnings are
sufficient to cover the increased divi-
dend commitment on a basis that the
same nominal dividend rate will be main-
tained. A l-for-2 issue would raise the
total ordinary dividend payout to nearly
£755,000 and last year’s earnings
covered this amount 1.2 times.
Over the last ten years, dividends have
never been covered less than 1.5 times,
so unless a 25 p.c. increase in earnings
takes place in 1963-64 it seems unlikely
that the bonus issue would be of this
order if it occurs at all.
In the chairman’s address delivered on
October 1 last, attention was drawn to
“the substantial amount of investment”
in the last five years. From the figures
which he quoted, this expenditure would
appear to be of the order of at least
£4.3 million, but if allowance is also
made for the increase in intangibles and
in minority interests, the amount would
be nearly £5.2 million.
In view of this substantial investment
it will be interesting to view the results
of the group in relation to this increasing
capital. Unfortunately, it is necessary to
make a number of estimates as the ratio
which I intend to use is between net
operating revenue (group net profit be-
fore tax, depreciation, and interest on
long-term debt) excluding investment in-
come and total capital (net working capi-
tal plus fixed assets and intangibles) less
investments. This ratio for the last five
years appears to be as follows:
Year ended June 30
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
22.5 23.5 23.0 22.8 24.1
In view of the substantial investment
and the difficult times of the last three
years, this is a very commendable record.
The marked improvement in the last
year could well mean that capital ex-
penditure in this period is now about to
pay off. A look at the ratio of the net
operating revenue figure to group sales
may be of help in searching for a
reasonable view of what the immediate
future may hold:—
Year ended June 30
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
12.0 11.5 11.0 11.8 11.7
Regrettably I cannot feel quite so
confident, for here the declining trend
appears to have been arrested in 1962,
but a very slight decline occurred again
in 1963. The parent company’s figures
appear to show much the same trend,
but the recovery in 1962 was much
greater and the percentage was higher
both in 1962 and in 1963 than it was at
the beginning of the period.
The following table gives directors’
forecasts and actual results so far as the
parent company is concerned:—
Actual Profit
Increase p.c. from
Year Forecast Sales Trading
1960- "Sales and trading
profit higher" 15 4
1961- "Steady sales
and profits" 4 18
1962- "Slightly higher
sales and profits" 17 21
1963- "Approximately steady
sales and profits" (not yet available)
Perhaps one would have some diffi-
culty in guessing the likely increase in
earnings during the current year, but at
least we have the guide that the directors
are not expecting any substantial increase.
While, therefore, the directors are not
over-optimistic, there does seem to be
every prospect that Humes will turn in
increased earnings in 1963-64. The parent
company’s trading profit represented
about 64 p.c. of the group total in 1962-
63 and the New Zealand company, which
is expected to stage a recovery, contri-
buted only just over 12 p.c. Clearly, then,
it is the results of the Australian opera-
tion which will have the greatest effect
on profits available to the ordinary share-
holders of Humes Ltd.
J>erhaps it is now as well to examine
the historical record so far as these
shareholders are concerned. The share-
holder who was fortunate enough to buy
100 Hume shares in 1955 at their lowest
point of 545. 6d. and who did not in-
crease his investment at the time of the
rights issue in November, 1960, would
today hold 137 shares with a market
value of nearly £579. Capital apprecia-
tion over eight years has, therefore, been
of the order of 111 p.c. But it must be
realised that at the price of 545. 6d. the
shares showed an immediate dividend
yield of 6.4 p.c. and an earnings yield
of nearly 14.5 p.c.!
This investor would have seen his
dividend income and the earnings avail-
able to cover it follow this pattern:—
Yr. end June 30 Div. Income Earn.
£ £
1956 17.5 26.9
1957 16.0 34.2
1958 17.6 33.6
1959 17.5 35.5
1960 17.5 33.7
1961 19.2 33.5
1962 19.2 29.9
1963 19.2 34.9
Unless the bonus issue occurs soon
and provides a fairly substantial lift in
dividend income, the shares may be a
trifle on the high side at around 84s.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
High Earnings; Generous Divs.
1962-63 annual report of Life
Savers (Australasia) Ltd reveals yet
more financial strength. Combined
reserves net of intangibles are now
£1,480,519, compared with preference
capital of £21,795 and ordinary capital
of £975,602.
The company which provided five
bonus scrip issues in eight years can still
produce fresh evidence of stored wealth.
This year it is a £110,837 reserve for
fluctuation in raw material prices pro-
vided by a subsidiary and not previously
disclosed in its accounts.
Other than that, plant, machinery,
fixtures and motor vehicles valued at
cost increased by £154,504, yet over-
draft was reduced by £291,191. The
working capital ratio improved from
1.17:1 to 1.44:1.
Profit grew from £260,386 to
£290,201, both figures including Smalls
Chocolate Holdings, taken over just
before the end of 1961-62. Tax provision
rose from £155,000 to £183,000, while
depreciation charge fell from £124,742
to £109,685, because directors decided
not to provide for amortisation on build-
ings in 1962-63.
Dividend rate was lifted from 15 to
16 p.c. although earning rate moved
back from 33.1 to 29.5 p.c.
Life Savers, best known for their candy
with a hole, also produce Walco jubes,
barley sugar and Quick-Eze indigestion
tablets, Cooks confectionery, Chasers
breath tablets, Mastercraft chocolate
and speciality lines, and Small’s choco-
late tablets.
Life Savers have plants in Sydney and
Auckland, and acquisition of Smalls
added two chocolate plants, one in Mel-
bourne (opened in 1958) and one in
Sydney.
Mastercraft was acquired in 1960-61,
and Smalls a year later after a take-
over tussle with James Stedman Ltd.
The financial interest of Robertson and
Woodcock of the UK in Cook Con-
fectionery Pty Ltd (makers of Trebor
confectionery) was purchased in May,
1962.
In Lane Cove (NSW) Life Savers
claim to possess the most modern con-
fectionery plant in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. New high - speed automatic
machinery was installed to accelerate
production. Directors refer to some
plant as being prototypes, and revolution-
ary within the confectionery field.
A new factory and warehouse is
currently being built at the rear of the
Lane Cove factory to house the choco-
late tablet manufacturing plant, provide
modern warehousing facilities and
integrate company activities.
In New Zealand the leading manu-
facturing confectioner, Heards Ltd,
arranged to manufacture the Life Saver
and Walco range of products as from
August 1, 1963. Directors said this was
in pursuance of Life Savers’ policy of
absorbing Mastercraft and Smalls to
provide a perfectly balanced range of
chocolate and sugar confectionery.
Generous dividends have been paid
out of high earnings, interspersed with
frequent bonuses, so that Life Savers has
proved one of the most rewarding in-
vestments on the Australian stock
market. (Shareholders registered at
January 12, 1961, also had the oppor-
tunity to subscribe to a three-for-ten
par issue.)
A principal product which is cheap
(4d.) has given Life Savers a remarkable
immunity from recessions. If the same
managerial skill is applied to the manu-
facture and merchandising of the choco-
late business, continued success is likely.
The 5s. shares, showing a tiny yield
of 2.3 p.c., have probably not yet
reached their upper limit although they
have advanced 4s. on the price at the
end of October. At 34s. 6d. they are still
short of the top price in every one of
the last five years.

SONNERDALE LTD
Hopes in Reorganisation
Acquisition of Richardson David
Brown Gears Pty Ltd meant an
enlargement of Sonnerdale Ltd’s capital
by £346,481, but not much addition to
reserves.
The purchase of this associate of the
David Brown UK group was first
announced in October, 1962, but was
not effected until June 25, 1963. Profit
earned by the proprietary company for
the 13 months to June 30 was (less
dividends paid) treated as pre-acquisition
profit, and included in the balance sheet
as £6847 surplus on consolidation.
Current assets increased from £549,287
to £981,945, and fixed assets from
£480,886 to £814,478 over the year to
June 30, 1963, mainly as a result of
the takeover. The takeover was unusual
in that throughout the period in which
it was being negotiated Sonnerdale 10s.
shares were consistently below par.
It was, in fact, a merger of interests
rather than the ascendance of Sonnerdale
over David Brown. Sonnerdale directors
expected the move to allow the company
to better serve engineering and allied
industries in Australia and to develop
exports to South-east Asia.
The Sonnerdale business of auto-
motive and general engineering began in
1912 and was incorporated in 1920. For
the two years 1960-61 and 1961-62 con-
siderable losses were incurred due to
economic restrictions, the heavy cost of
reorganising manufacturing plants at
Stanmore and Milperra, and the write-
off of unprofitable work in progress and
stocks.
Directors declare that although a small


trading loss of £8584 was incurred in
1962-63, operations since balance date
have been profitable, and there is now
in hand a large volume of work which
demands more skilled labor than is
available.
Richardson David Brown Gears is the
oldest manufacturer of gearing and power
transmission in Australia. It has been
associated with the UK group for more
than 30 years.
As a result of the merger with Sonner-
dale, a 15-year agreement has been
arranged with the David Brown Corpora-
tion of England to make available tech-
nical aid and proprietary designs, and
exclusive selling rights for David Brown
industrial gear products in Australasia,
and rights in South-east Asia on a non-
exclusive basis.
Activities of Sonnerdale’s original com-
prehensive manufacturing plant at Stan-
more, the specialised forging operations
of Valley Forge and Engineering Co.
Pty Ltd at Revesby and the “considerable
manufacturing facilities” (including an
iron foundry) at Footscray (Vic.) of
Richardson David Brown Gears Pty Ltd
will be co-ordinated.
The structure of the sales force has
been altered to embrace a larger product
range, and give more emphasis to exports.
Depreciation on consolidated account
plus that allowed on David Brown’s
Footscray plant was £61,505. Directors
said in their 1963 annual report that
valuable items of plant were acquired
during the last year which will benefit
production this year. They are attempting
to reduce the average age of plant
employed and to acquire items of a more
highly productive nature.
Difficulties in controlling and valuing
stock have now been overcome, directors
state, and the present figure of £593,667
is considered satisfactory as to type and
in relation to group turnover.
The loan on second mortage to Hyster
Australia Pty Ltd of £115,000 is a relic
of the association with Hyster Co. of
USA. Sonnerdale assembled its fork-lift
trucks until March, 1962, then sold its
property at Milperra and shares in Hyster
Sonnerdale Pty Ltd to the American
company for over £500,000.
Although preference shareholders have
not been neglected in the last three
difficult years, ordinary shareholders have
had to forego dividends. Directors will
probably pay attention to liquidity, and
refrain from dividend recommendations
until the company is firmly on its feet
again.
In the last year bank overdraft in-
creased from £13,561 to £119,099. To
pay a 10 p.c. dividend again, the com-
pany will need £92,395 compared with
the last 10 p.c. dividend requirement in
1960 of only £48,122, such is the growth
of capital.
There is no cause yet for pushing the
10s. shares above their present level of
Bs. sd. As it is, this is largely under-
pinned by the market’s respect for the
David Brown association.

HUNTER DOUGLAS LTD
Notes Better Than Shares
activity in the building in-
dustry generally and introduction of
new programmes and products by Hunter
Douglas Ltd should produce a sound
profit recovery in 1963-64.
Since the merger of Hunter Douglas
Australia Pty Ltd (the local repre-
sentative of an international organisation
which originated in Germany) with
Mello-Lite Ltd in November, 1961,
profits have been £221,305 in 1961-62
and £.160,535 in the latest year to June
30.
Integration of the manufacturing
operations of the two companies took
longer than anticipated, but directors said
improvements were made in production
tooling, layout and methods which in-
creased performance in the latter part
of the year.
Mello-Lite was formed in 1958 as a
holding company to take over Pain
Manufacturing Co. which had made
Venetian blinds ' since 1948. When
aluminium Venetians were introduced,
aluminium slatting was made, and later
aluminium awnings and roll-up ily
screens.
Hunter Douglas had first imported
various aluminium products, then manu-
factured them locally at Roseville
(NSW), from 1954.
Mello-Lite had been listed from 1958,
and afforded shareholders the opportunity
to participate in a two-for-five par issue
and a two-for-five convertible note issue.
Results in 1962-63 were affected by
lower than budgeted sales and higher
costs. New products bolstered turnover
to approximately 1961-62 levels, but they
involved establishment costs. Moreover,
tax benefits were not available as in the
previous year, from the losses of a sub-
sidiary company.
Stocks were £1,313,568 at June 30,
1963, compared with their opening level
for the year of £1,019,656. This was
partly due to a special purchase of a
large quantity of raw materials on
favorable conditions.
Luxaflex curtain fittings, an improved
version of Kirsch curtain fittings, and
Permalum aluminium siding have been
developed in the last year. The latter
product experienced a difficult intro-
duction, but the division is now profitable.
A 76 p.c. interest was obtained in

July, 1962, in Cordex Pty Ltd, which
makes synthetic braided twines and cords.
A “sizeable” contract has been obtained
from the Commonwealth Government.
Several subsidiaries are now being
liquidated to effect some administrative
savings.
The overseas Hunter Douglas group
retains a majority interest. To permit
it to adjust to new foreign tax legislation,
the local company is paying two interim
dividends—one on November 23, 1963,
the other in July, 1964 —and then a
final in November, 1964. The company
wilL then revert to its old practice of
paying interims in April and finals in
November.
The 20s. shares have fallen from a
peak 465. since the news of the reduced
profit, and are currently priced at 355. 9d.
to yield 5.6 p.c. The 74 p-c. notes which
convert at par to shares on December 31,
1956, are quoted 4s. 3d cheaper, yet the
present income difference, until the half-
yearly note interest is paid in December,
is only Is. 6d. Noteholders participate
in cash or bonus issues of shares,
although no mention was made in the
Trust Deed of another note issue. There
is provision for conversion in the event
of a takeover.
Undoubtedly if an interest is desired
in this company, the notes are the more
economical entry.

Millaquin Dividend
IY/Tillaquin Sugar shareholders seem
set for a 174 p.c. dividend this year
on capital after the one-for-three bonus.
This was the minimum rate predicted
by directors, and the company’s 5 p.c.
interim is the same as was paid last year.
A 174 p.c. rate is equivalent to 234
p.c. on the pre-bonus capital.
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Another Side of Factoring
jpoLLOwiNG in the wake of the Reid
Murray report, Lend Lease has been
grouped with Cox Brothers in a damag-
ing newspaper article. What were des-
cribed a few days later as misgivings in
this article were, I consider, straight out
incorrect statements on factual matters.
Of course, the article had some effect
on the share price which for the first
time for some years fell below 10s.
A much better selection of companies
for this type of article would have been
Neon Signs and the Australian Factors
group. It may be remembered some
weeks ago that I announced my plan to
move in on Commercial Guaranty when
the Australian Factors group crash be-
came public. True to my word, in went
my order for 1000 Commercial Guar-
anty at ss. 9d. This company has abso-
lutely no association with Australian
Factors.
With almost half the small capital held
by three institutions, the shares should
be fairly tightly held. The share price has
been lingering around 6s. 3d. for some
months, hesitant to move forward be-
cause of the pending Australian Factors
disaster. Now that the air is cleared, it
should at least move toward the 7s. 6d.
mark.
The listing of Commercial Guaranty
was some six months ahead of Martin
Wells. Formed only in 1953, it now
describes itself as Australia’s largest
manufacturer of ophthalmic spectacle
frames. Not satisfied with the local
market, it launched forth into exports in
1961. By March, 1963, 20 p.c. of total
production was being exported.
On the reconstructed capital, earning
rate has been about 21 p.c. for the last
three years. With profits in excess of
budget so far this year, the earning rate
is capable of moving up to 25 p.c. A
lot of those people who were lucky
enough to get the shares in the placement
at 7s. 6d. have been clearing about ss. 6d.
profit since the shares were listed last
week. From some of these people I
bought 1000 shares.
It could prove to be a minor protec-
tor. Those shares came on at about
7s. 6d. two years ago, and steadily
climbed to 255.
Buying in 4000 s seems to be the
order of the week. My final purchase was
1000 R. and N. Statham at 10s. 9d.
When a share moves up only 3d. on a
60 p.c. increase in profits, it becomes
temporarily a very frustrating market
for those shareholders who have been in
them all the year.
This Newcastle-based company is
known throughout NSW as a prefab-
ricator of steel rural buildings and a
manufacturer of wheat bins. Any in-
vestors desperately looking for stocks
directly benefiting from the rural boom
would appear to have their answer here.
Heavy purchases must mean heavy
sales. First of all, I reluctantly decided to
part with my Paynter and Dixon at
245. 6d. The profit was a most satisfying
£ll6. Also to go was the final 1000
W.J. shares at 19s. 3d., resulting in a
profit of £37.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400* Paynter & Dixon, 24/6 £494
1000 W.J., new, 19/3 £946
BOUGHT
1000 Commercial Guaranty, 5/9 £299
1000 R. & N. Statham, 10/9 .... £552
1000 Martin Wells, 13/6 £690
1000 Tasman, 9d £4O
Yes, these Tasman shares were covered
after the result was announced. The re-
sult confirmed my opinion that the shares
were only worth 6d. but I had to follow
the market. Now £499 in debit, I will
just have to curb my enthusiasm for
buying.
The portfolio now is:

Little More to Spare
With a fractional increase from
£79,101 to £83,683 in profit last
year Motor Spares, Melbourne-based
motor parts dealer which has 26 outlets
in Victoria and NSW, had a shade more
earnings to spare for its steady dividend
of 10 p.c., a rate to which it dropped
from 123 p.c. in 1960-61. However,
the earnings cover is still very slender
at 1.2 times the dividend, so the 7.5 p.c.
return on the ss. shares at 7s. 6d. isn’t
all that exciting.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
A Plan for Dried Fruits
Some Growers Getting Less Than £5 a Week
As farming goes, Australia’s dried
fruits industry, worth £l2 million
a year, has its share of worries. It
suffers from over-production. It relies
too much on exports.
With nothing but its own resources,
it has lately faced under-cutting from
competitors who enjoy subsidies or
guaranteed prices. World demand for
dried fruits is tending to decline. Last
year many Australian growers got less
than cost of production, while the in-
dustry as a whole did little better than
break even.
When 300 producers at Mildura
earlier this year called on the Minister
for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann)
for help, they said the industry was in
such a plight that some growers were
getting less than £5 a week. About 55
p.c. of all growers were under lien
to packing companies and another 10
p.c. were in debt to the companies.
Only 35 p.c. had received any cash
from the last two progress payments for
fruit delivered to packing houses. Sixty-
five p.c. had been given dockets
showing their payments had been de-
ducted from their debts.
Behind the scenes, officials have been
working to alleviate these problems.
One of the fruits of their toil is a
stabilisation plan that will be put to a
poll of growers in March.
Commonwealth Government, from
which the Australian Dried Fruits
Association has been seeking an accept-
able plan for about 10 years, has
approved this one, but whether growers
will do the same is by no means sure,
since in 1957 they rejected a scheme
embodying much the same terms as the
present one.
The plan, of the “give -or - take”
variety, will be financed by the growers,
the Commonwealth acting as guarantor.
The scheme is based on cost of pro-
duction as assessed by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics and recalculated
every year according to index costing.
When producers’ sweat box realisations
exceeded cost of production plus £5 a
ton, any surplus up to £lO would be paid
by the grower to the appropriate varietal
fund for sultanas, raisins or currants.
Should the proceeds exceed cost of
production by both the £5 give-or-take
figure and the £lO payable to the fund,
the additional margin would remain
with the grower.
Conversely, when the sweat box real-
isation was less than cost of production,
the grower would stand the first £5 of
the difference and the Government
would compensate him for the remainder
of it.
Tn the 1957 referendum, the give-or-take
A figure was £lO instead of £5, and
this, apparently, was putting the rescuer
a little further from the victim than
many growers cared for. If, for example,
prices had stayed indefinitely £9 below
cost of production, growers would always
be separated by £1 from the benefits of
the Government’s guarantee. At the
March poll, the more bridgeable £5 and
the increasing need for stability may
produce another verdict.
Quantities eligible for the guaranteed
price would be 13,500 tons for currants,
75,000 tons for sultanas and 11,000 tons
for raisins. Growers would not be re-
quired to put into the relevant fund
when seasonal production failed to reach
8000 tons for currants, 50,000 tons for
sultanas or 6000 tons for raisins.
The ceilings on growers’ contributions
to varietal funds would be £500,000
each for currants and raisins and £2
million for sultanas. If industry con-
tributions to a fund should result in the
exceeding of its ceiling, the Common-
wealth would have first go at the excess
to reimburse itself for anything it had
previously contributed. Any remaining
money would be distributed among
growers on a first-in first-out basis.
Architects of the plan, led by Mr
R. M. Simes, chairman of the Australian
Dried Fruits Association, are anxious
that it be not thought of as a subsidy.
The industry has always been proud of
its self-help and co-operation, and sees
the proposed scheme only as a means of
levelling off prices and serving as an
insurance against a prolonged depression.
To be carried, the plan must
have the support of a simple majority
of those entitled to vote, which means
that those who do not exercise their
franchise will automatically vote against
the plan. Some would have preferred
acceptance to rest on a two-thirds
majority of those who actually vote.
The number of non-voters, however, is
expected to be negligible.
Much of last year’s crisis in the in-
dustry was caused by a price war with
Turkey, which pulled values down to
the lowest level since 1954. Since then
Australia and two of its main rivals,
Turkey and Greece, have agreed to
keep prices stable and not undercut each
other to stupid levels. This has given
the industry more confidence, but a
stabilisation fund, serving as a safe-
guard against a breakdown of the three-
way international pact, would strengthen
its sense of security further still.
Meanwhile, the industry is doing
more than wring its hands. Always
seeking new markets, it has gained a
place for its fruits in dozens of odd
corners like Mauritius and South
American countries, and has worked up
trade with African nations under the
nose of rival South Africa, whose racial
policies have cost her markets all over
that continent.
T ast year, even while prices were at
rock bottom, Australian trade officials
were investing in the future by conduct-
ing the biggest dried fruits promotion
that has ever been carried out for this
country in the United Kingdom. Aus-
tralian sultanas, among the best in the
world, were featured in 37,000 British
stores. The dried fruits industry,
through the Australian Trade Directorate
in London, is contributing some £30,000
a year towards overseas promotion.
The industry, which would like to see
its expansion pegged at the present
65,000 acres, is also anxious to lift
home sales beyond the 20 p.c. of
production they now represent.
Since the war, dried fruits consump-
tion has fallen throughout the world
because of a tendency for people to
swing from sweet to savory foods. No-
where is this better illustrated than in
Australia, where the influence of a
million European migrants is beginning
to tell.
To offset the drift, dried fruits growers
have this year forked out £113,000 for
advertising, compared with last year’s
£82,000.

India Needs Our Wool
But it’s Billions in the Red and Can't Buy
Australia’s wool industry may take
heart from tidings brought back
from India last week by Mr John Young,
of John P. Young and Associates Ptv
Ltd, management consultants.
Retained by the Australian Govern-
ment to advise India under the Colombo
Plan on how to develop its textile in-
dustry the 46-year-old management ex-
pert flew back to Melbourne enthusing
about the possibilities that had revealed
themselves in this second most populous
country of the world.
If the Indian textile industry is to
survive, he said, it badly needs an
additional £lO million of Australian
wool a year. Crippled by one of
the world’s worst balance-of-payments
problems, India is billions in the red and
its imports are controlled by a rigid
quota system that enables it to buy only
£5 million worth of wool a year from
Australia.
Surprisingly, India herself produces 70
million lb. of wool annually, but the
industry is primitive and the wool short
and coarse, suited only to the manu-
facture of carpets.
India’s textile industry was somewhat
neglected until tension developed with
China, but the mobilisation of forces
turned textiles into ordnance materials
and the industry began to bristle with
purpose.
Being starved for raw wool, the Indian
mills tried to adapt the crude fibres of
the country’s own flocks to the manu-
facture of woollens and worsteds. The
result was garments that prickled the
wearer as though made of horse-hair,
and vast damage to machinery.
Military priority caused the incipient
Indian export trade to dry up, and it
has remained virtually extinct for two
years. But India’s special problems have
led to its admission to a number of trade
agreements that give it access to rich
textile markets that are denied to other
countries, including Australia. Russia and
other members of the Communist bloc,
for example, would buy huge quantities
of textiles from India.
To take advantage of these markets,
India must have a lot more wool, and
Australia is the country best placed to
supply it in the types and quantities
needed. This gives us, through India, an
opportunity for a large and immediate
expansion of the wool market if a way
can be found to enable India to buy.
In addition to the export custom that
awaits her, India has an enormous seller’s
market for textiles at home. Although
India is synonymous with poverty, its
population of 450 millions contains
enough “haves” to make it a far richer
market than Australia.
Within six years India will have 552
million people. The “have-nots”, how-
ever, predominate, and it is estimated
that India’s national income must grow
by seven per cent a year if the lowest
fifth of its people is to achieve an in-
come of only 30s. sterling a month.
At present the annual growth of India’s
income is only 2 p.c., so unless the
initiative comes from outside the prospect
is that India will not only be unable to
increase its purchases of Australian wool
but be forced to curtail even its present
inadequate wool budget of £5 million.
It Australia can find a formula to let
India have the extra £10 million worth
of wool a year that it needs, it would be
creating an additional outlet for its main
export commodity, at the same time
helping India to close an income gap
that can lead only to mass poverty.
According to Young, it would take
little priming to set going the cycle of
manufacturing and marketing of wool

textiles in India. He believes that if Aus-
tralia could extend credit of only £5
million, India would within three years be
buying an additional £l5 million worth
of wool a year, making annual purchases
of £2O million. The industry would then
be able to finance its own further
expansion.
A plan has been drawn up for the
modernisation of the Indian textile in-
dustry, and within a year of its com-
pletion the country's exports could rise
by 20 p.c., or £lO million. Within five
years, India could be exporting 50 p.c.
of its textile production and using the
other half to appease the pent-up appetite
of the home market, where worsted suits,
especially among white collar classes,
have become a status symbol.
The danger to Australia is that the
chance of putting wool into the Indian
vacuum might be lost if synthetic fibres
make it first.
For some time, Australia has been
active in India through the agency of
the International Wool Secretariat, which
has a permanent director stationed there
to lead the promotion of wool in terms
of its proper end-use. Another organisa-
tion, the United Nations Special Fund,
whose project adviser is an Australian,
Mr David Scott, is busy trying to im-
prove India's sheep farming, but it will
be 50 years before India can grow
enough wool for its own use.
In India's thousands of villages, welfare
agencies have taught people knitting and
weaving, but there is not enough proper
wool for them to exercise their talents.
Australia should get more wool to India
before synthetics beat them or the
villagers forget how to knit.
The key to India's textile dilemma,
thinks Mr Young, might be for the World
Bank to provide money for capital equip-
ment while Australia gives a loan for the
purchase of raw wool.
If India ruled that wool bought in
this way be used only for re-exporting,
it would become part of a process that
would snowball itself into solvency in no
time at all.
Sprays for Apples
TTVdr the control of bitter pit in apples,
experiments in the last year have
provided more information on the use
of calcium sprays.
The Victorian Department of Agri-
culture suggests between three and five
sprays a season according to severity. At
least one of these should be given within
six weeks of petal fall and the others
spread out, the last being two weeks
before harvesting.
New Sand Blast
Machine
For Cleaning Eggs
A revolutionary method of cleaning
eggs, even if they are cracked, is
reported by the British Egg Board.
A machine, developed over five years
of research, directs at the eggs a high
velocity air stream containing an abrasive
compound.
This machine, which won the
£stg. 1000 Egg Board prize in a com-
petition for egg dry cleaners in England
recently, was displayed at this year’s
Royal Show. It was so impressive that
the judges for the Egg Board recom-
mended that no other awards be made in
either the class for automatic machines
or the one for hand-operated machines.
The competition was staged to stress
the urgency of abolishing the old-
fashioned method of washing eggs.
Throughput varied from 1280 to 1028
an hour according to the size of egg.
The makers stated that it has a full
capacity of 1500 an hour.
Ability to clean off blood and yolk
stains is a feature. Hair cracked or thin
shelled eggs can be cleaned without fur-
ther damage. If an egg breaks the mach-
ine continues to work and the broken
shell can be removed later.
The eggs are carried on a twin roller
track conveyor system which turns them
so that the complete surface is cleaned.
The blast is carried below the eggs
where the abrasive falls back into the
hopper. Dust and dirt particles from the
shells are carried out in a duct which
can be connected to a settlement
chamber.
The cleaning process partially closes
the pores in the shells. Tests have shown
that eggs cleaned by this machine had
less weight loss through evaporation than
naturally clean eggs.
Loganberry Crops
Threatened
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
'C'xcept for its insularity, Tasmania has
scarcely one of its traditional dis-
tinctions left to it, what with apples and
potatoes growing in Queensland, good
beer almost everywhere, crayfish in West-
ern Australia, scallop beds in Victoria,
a shortage of rain and consequently of
hydro-electric power and now part
of its berry-growing is threatened with
extinction.
The loganberries in the Huon Valley
are ripening fast in unseasonably warm
weather, and growers cannot find a mar-
ket for a quarter of the crop. About 150
tons, which is a very large quantity of
loganberries, will go unharvested unless a
subsidy is forthcoming.
The secretary of the Stone and Berry
Fruits Board (Mr C. lies) estimates that
they cost £9O a ton to grow, so the
loss will be heavy.
South African canners with cheap
labor to pick their crops are landing
16 oz. cans of loganberries in Australia
at half the price of the local product.
I hey have priced the Tasmanian-canned
berries out of the British market.
This, says Mr R. H. Brown, MLC,
of Glen Huon, has made growers very
bitter. "South Africa, though no longer
a member of the British Commonwealth,
still enjoys all the privileges of member-
ship, ’’ he commented.
Because of the competition, Tasmanian
canners cannot dispose of last season’s
production, and unless the Fruit Industry
Sugar Concession Committee can help
to the tune of ss. a dozen cans, the pro-
cessors will not buy more than they have
already contracted for. Many of the
200 Huon growers will have to grub out
their plantations and turn to other forms
of agriculture.
