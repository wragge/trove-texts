THE RED PAGE
WINDS.
The wind takes color from the trees ;
Through trees the wind grows green,
And like a blue wave from the seas
The ocean wind is seen.
The red road paints the. road-wind red,
And down the ripe gold corn
The chuckling wind with golden head
Trots merrily at morn.
The black lake gives the black wind birth,
The brown breeze blows along
The ploughed brown cocked-up smoking
earth
To the tune of a hunting song.
The w r hite wind moves in the white moon’s
wake.
With straight, white, streaming hair,
And ever she wails in wmrds that ache
The burthen of her despair.
0 gusty soul that lives within,
Why dost thou flush and fade,
Wind-like, to flume and icicle-
Red Rahab and white Maid?
HUGH McCRAR.
NIGHT ON SYDNEY HARBOR.
Night slowly stooped in amorous wise to
fy earth,
Who smiled, and stretched her arms, and
drew him down.
A little breeze crept through the tired
town.
As their breaths mingled, like a thrill of
birth.
Beyond the hills, like a slim Oread,
Who sees her shadow in a quiet pool,
Nhked, bewilderingly beautiful,
And half draws back afraid, and half is glad
Of her own beauty, the moon tremblingly
Rose up, flushed with warm radiance, soft
as clings
To youthful lovers’ shy rememberings
Of love’s first unbelievbd ecstasy.
* * * *
Across the shadow of the sea there moves
The shadow’s shadow of a ship, that seems
Bound surely for some dreamless shore of
dreams,
Of silent rivulets and sleeping groves.
Like sorrow, but with gentler magic, night
Makes, visible the soul of common things.
Here in the moonbeams’ silver shadowings
Thev seem to breathe a mystical delight.
There, where awhile the sprawling city lay
Like a sea-monster, basking its huge frame.
Blossoms a secret garden, sown with flame
And set with strange bright blooms, unknown
of day :
As when the soul, set free ’twixt Heaven and
Hell,
Wandering beside the shadowy tides of
sleep,
Ere back to the abysmal dark they creep.
Finds a strange dream cast up thence like &
shell
Between its feet, and, listening, faintly hears,
Echoing across the unmeasured gulf sub-
lime
Beyond the utmost shores of space or time,
The matVix-musie of the primal spheres.
FRITZ S. BURNELL.
“Max"
"In certain congruities of dark cloth, n.
the rigid perfection of his linen, in the sym-
metry of his glove with liis hand, lay the
secret of Mr. Brummell’s miracles. He
was ever most economical, most scrupulous
of means. . . .Mr. Brummell was, indeed, in
the utmost sense of the word, an artist.”
These sentences from Max Beerbohm’s
essay on “Dandies” would do for Max him-
self. He, too, is a dandy, and, in the utmost
sense of the word, an artist. In his cari-
catures, particularly the early ones, there are
certain,congruities of dark masses, a rigid
perfection of white, and a symmetry in char-
acterisation, which fits the soul of his subject
like a glove. And in lines and words he is
most economical of means.
Like most geniuses, he began his brilliant
career very early. John Lane, his biblio-
grapher, and, incidentally, his publisher states
" Max, ” from a drawing by
J. Simpson.
that he was born
in London in
the same week
as Aubrey
Beardsley, the
precise date be-
ing August 26,
1872. His nur-
sery essays and
cartoons are,
doubtless, pre-
served, and will
see the light in
an edition de
luxe when Max
is no more. At
an early date he
was known as a
child author, and
as that he is
known still.
Only once has
he murmured —•
in a protest
against the mod-
ern cult of the
child :
The public knows me to be a child
author, and likes to picture me at my
desk dressed in black velveteen with legs
dangling towards the floor.
M hen Simpson portrayed him in the draw-
ing reproduced, he had got into long trousers.
“I was a modest, good-humored boy,” he says
somewhere. “It is Oxford that has made
me insufferable.” That is his gentle way of
referring to his distinguishing quality of
polished impertinence. It has made him the
idol of the British club men, the loungers
and persifleurs in literature. “Max” has

become a na-
tional institu-
tion like Punch.
He it was who
glorified rouge,
who took a luief
for George the
Four t h, who
raised Beau
Brummell to the
highest rank as
an artist, while
D’Orsay wa s
rated as “a way-
ward, excessive
creature, too
fond of life and
other follies to
a cliie v e real
greatness,” and
he, too, at the
very outset
struck the secret
of the great es-
sayi s t s, and
wrote about
himself. Here is
an extract from
his first book,
modestly en-
titled Works: —
In the year of grace, 1890, and in the
beautiful autumn of that year, I was a
freshman at Oxford. I remember how my
tutor asked me what lectures I wished to
attend, and how he laughed when I said that 1
wished to attend the lectures of Mr. Walter
Pater. Also, I remember how, one morning
soon after, I went into Ryman’s to order
some foolish engraving for my room, and
there saw, peering into a portfolio a small,
thick, rock-faced man whose top-hat and
gloves of bright dogskin struck one of the
many discords in that little city of learning
and laughter. The serried bristles of his
mqustachio made for him a false military
air. I think I nearly went down when they
told me that this was Pater.
Not that even in those most decadent
days of my childhood did I admire the man
as a stylist. Even then I was angry that
he. should treat English as a dead language,
bored by that sedulous ritual wherewith he
laid out every sentence as in a shroud —-
hanging like a widower long over its mar-
moreal beauty or ever he could lay it at
length in his book, its sepulchre. From
that laden air, the so cadaverous murmur of
that sanctuary, I would hook it at the beck
of any jade.
Lord Lansdowne and H. G. Wells.
Carlyle had written heavily about the sig-
nificance of clothes, but Max penetrated more
thoroughly that dark mystery, and showed
how subtly expressive a costume may be.
The bowler of Mr. Jerome K. Jerome is
a perfect preface to all his works. The silk
hat of Mr. Whistler is a real nocturne, his
linen a symphony en Mane majeur. To have
seen Mr. Hall Caine is to have read his
soul. His flowing formless cloak is as one
of his own novels, 25 editions latent in the
folds of it. Melodrama crouches upon the
brim of his sombrero. His tie is a Pub-
lisher's Announcement. His boots are Copy-
right. In his hand he holds the staff of The
Family Herald.
Max does not allow himself to become flam-
boyant; there is always a chaste restraint,
a dignified reticence, an air of imperturbable
calm in writing aoout himself or lesser mat
fers. Thus in 1896 he bade farewell to
Getters:—
Once in the delusion that Art, loving the
recluse, would make his life happy, I wrote
a little for a yellow quarterly, and had that
succes de fiasco which is always given to a
young writer of talent. But the stress of
creation soon overwhelmed me. Only Art
with a capital II gives any consolations to
her henchmen. And I, who crave no knight-
hood, shall write no more. I shall write no
more. Already I feel myself to be a trifle
outmoded. I belong to the Beardsley period'
Younger men with months of activity be-
fore them, with fresher schemes and notions,
with newer enthusiasms, have pressed for-
ward since then. (Jedo junioribus. Indeed,
I stand aside with no regret. For to be out-
moded is to be a classic, if one has written
well. I have acceded to the hiei-arehy of
good scribes, and rather like my niche.
“A Book of Ferses undernealh a bough," etc.
The charm of the first book was not quite
maintained in More, though there are many
delightful flashes in it, and Yet Again is
Max no longer dandaieal, but just as humor-
ous and more soberly elegant. It would be
pleasure to quote from his appreciations of
Ouida and The- Gentle Art of Making Ene-
mies, from his pathetic acount of the loss of
a fine collection of luggage labels and many
other exquisite passages. But for a paltry
five siblings or so you can get each volume
of Max’s cheerful Works. He promises a
novel this year which should be a thing of
joy.
Three books of his caricatures have
already been published. The earliest have
the most bite; the later are more broadly
humorous. An exhibition of his reeent cari-
catures was held a few months ago in Lon-
don, and celebrities had the pleasure of see-
ing themslves provide amusement for the
public. Nearly everybody of note is there,
including his half-brother, Beerbohm Tree,
and himself. The drawing of Wells explain-
ing things to Lansdowne was at the exhibi-
tion ; the illustration of Omar’s verse is in
the book called The Poets' Corner.
MORNING GLORY.
The sky has changed from black' to grey,
From grey to primrose clear,
The climbing stars have paled away,
The sun is very near.
The hills are flushing mauve and pink,
Translucent, cool and pale,
And soon the rising sun will drink
Their bubble-colors frail.
The soft, smooth bands of nightuuist lie
Across the mountain’s base,
So it is floating in the sky,
No more an earthly place.
What wonder? That rose-violet
Diaphanous and far
Was never this world’s treasure yet,
But from some younger star.
* * -X- *
The east is apricot—and see
The sun leaps out behind
The hills-—the cool dawn-colors flee
Like bubbles in the wind.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
In re Marcus Clarke
Two or three people have been writing of
Marcus Clarke lately, and they prompt the
telling of the story of the killing of Rufus
Dawes. The Moloneys—Lawyer Jim and
Doctor Pat —were among the strongest
friends of Marcus. Doctor Pat had a liter-
ary turn himself. He wrote a good sonnet
on Melbourne by night, with the lines:
I see the parallels of thy long streets
Like golden angels shining all a-row.
Doctor Pat made a fortune —he was a very
skilful operator; retired, went to live in
London, and died of want of occupation
and the breaking up of lifelong habit.
Seven years ago we were walking from
Blackfriars Bridge along the Thames em-
bankment to Westminster, and he told me
what I would die of.
“A rush of blood to the brain,” he said.
“Apoplexy will settle you, old man.”
“It will prove I have a brain, anyway.
What will you die of?”
“Kidney convulsion.”
“One of these days they’ll find a solvent
for uric acid fat.”
“God forbid,” said Doctor Pat. “God for-
bid. It would wipe out Genius. The physi-
eal cnuse ° f great thought is a trituration
of the delicate blood vessels of the brain bv
urates.” -
“That’s new, anyhow.”
Look at them all. Kit Marlow stabbed
by a serving man in a brawl; Shake-
speare dying of a healing fever. It may be
only that the possession of great ability or
great strength predisposes a man to excess ”
“On the principle that all you have in
you should be used before you die?”
“Yes. And see how some of these poets
with more than the intuition of a woman
jump to the conclusion science wins through
centuries of labor. I’ve never forgiven Ten-
nyson for saying that Queen Victoria was
pre-eminent in grief when I know that there
are more heart-breaks in hovels than in
palaces simply because there are few pal-
aces,. and his utter snobbery disgusted me.
Think of that awful line:
The village ne’er had seen a costlier funeral.
But he had true vision and inspiration in
most things. D’ye remember that in the
“Dream of Fair Women”?
As when some great thought strikes along
the brain,
And flushes all the cheek.
Uric acid flush, uric acid flush, my boy.”
When Dr. Pat had his surgery in Lons-
dale-street, opposite Melbourne* Hospital,
Marcus Clarke, then writing “For the Term
of His Natural Life,” was a daily, or rather a
nightly visitor —for they lived all day and
talked all night. Lawyer Jim Moloney had
been arguing against a happy ending, and
therefore an inartistic ending to the
tragedy of Rufus Dawes; and failing to
move Marcus he led him out for a walk at
midnight. “It was a magic night,” says
Jim Moloney ; “the moon in her pride; and
we walked up Russell-street past the gaol
and down Grattan-street and along the Syd-
uey-road—the trees so still, the night so
fair. And I said to him : ‘Marcus, Rufus
Dawes must die.’ ‘I can’t, Jim,’ he said.
‘I can’t kill the poor chap.’ I said, ‘Mar-
cus, he must die! Consider! For years you
have held him bound in torture —-beaten,
disgraced, unmanned. The iron is in his
soul; Nature has borne all she can, and now
craves only the quiet of the grave. Kill
him. Kill the poor weary man. Marcus,
screw your courage up and kill him.’ ‘Oh,
Jim,’ lie said, ‘let him have a day or two
of happiness. His innocence is known—his
mother wants him in England. Let him
live.’ ‘No, he must die. You offer him a
new torture. You offer that poor stricken
unhappy sinful soul—his mother—a new
unhappiness, the knowledge that he knows.
The chain gang and the shadow of the gal-
lows have been over him, and, innocent
though he is, he can never escape their
memories. Indurated to insult, his soul
scarred by injustice as his physical body by
the lash—you may take him back to Eng-
land, but Norfolk Island and its memories
will go with him.’
“ ‘But he is still human,’ pleaded Marcus,
but more weakly. ‘Let him live.’
“‘No; use the humanity left him to do
some great deed, but he must die.’
" ‘Yes,. I could do that,’ said Marcus.
‘Make him save Sylvia from an elopement
with North, and give his life for her in the
end.’
“‘Do as you please with him ; but, Mar-
cus, he must: die. Come, no weakness.’
“Well, it was nearly dawn wlien we re-
turned to my brother’s surgery, and I said
to him: ‘Pat! Marcus and I have killed
Rufus Dawes.’
“ ‘l’m very glad to hear it,’ said Pat.
‘Let’s have a drink.’ ” '
And the three murderers sat down to beer.

There is now a large, supply of reading
matter in French at Dymock’s Book Arcade.
In addition to the “Collection Nelson” (Is
od. per vol.), Dent’s “Les Classiques Fran-
Ca j s (Is. 9d.), and “Tousles Chefs-

D. McKee Wright’s “Viking Song,” which
appeared in The Bulletin some time ago, has
been printed with a musical setting by Cur-
wen and Sons, London. Without permission
from the author, the words have been altered
so that Wright appears to be barracking for
Britannia instead of Australia. No pub-
lisher has a right to make such a change
without authority, otherwise we will have
democratic verse perverted into songs for the
army of the Fat.

Clements Tonic Saved*!! Life
It may Save Yours if You Need Health. Read this Wonderful Letter.
(Exact copy of letter received.)
CLEMENTS TONIC LIMITED.
It is with the deepest feeling of gratitude that I write to tell you that in my
opinion Clements Tonic is a remedy of most marvellous powers and the most
wonderful medicine known.
I have been for 28 years in business in Hobart. lam well known to every-
one there, and 24 years ago I was taken very ill with Hydatids of the Liver,
which resulted in several serious operations, and which led to continuous ill-
health afterwards. Like a sick woman will, I tried many experts and their
medicines, and these failing, I resorted to advertised medicines, without regain-
ing my health or strength.
I suffered, as the result of the operations, from LOSS OF MEMORY,
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, DIZZINESS, CHRONIC INSOMNIA or
LOSS OF SLEEP, POOR APPETITE and INDIGESTION. I could not
walk across the room I was so weak; in fact, I thought I would never be able
to attend to my business again.
Seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I decided to try a bottle, and found it to
act like magic in giving me an appetite and better nerve strength, sol decided
to continue it, and this is the result: To-day lam alive and well. Although
this critical period of my life happened 24 years ago, I am here in the flesh
to-dav, thanks to that splendid medicine, which cured me of the ailments
specified in this letter, NERVOUS BREAKDOWN IN PARTICULAR. I
had no more sleepless nights, and in a few weeks, after taking it, I was strong
and well, and used to rise in the morning as happy as a lark. I can give you
the names of dozens of Hobart citizens who know these words are true, also the
name of the chemist there who sold me the tonic, Mr. A. P. Miller, Liverpool
Street, Hobart, and from whose pharmacy I have often bought it since.
I always recommend Clements Tonic to persons in ill-health, because I
know what it is and what its use means for women, and I hope you will use this
letter in the great cause of suffering humanity.
(Signed) MRS. MINNIE NIETOM ,
Witness to signature:
Mr. F. Fowler, J.P.,
Enmore, IS.S.W.
132 Liverpool Street,
Hobart,
21st November, 1910.
All the Clements Tonic testimonies can be fully verified. In this instance Mrs. Nietom called in person,
whilst on a visit to Sydney, and gave this splendid testimony without any request for it. It proves what
this splendid medicine can really do, and what a boon it is to the run-down man or woman continuously
out of sorts and ill through worry, over-work or study, hereditary weakness, insomnia or loss of sleep,
constipation sluggish liver, or kidney irregularities. Women who have a tendency to anaemia, sick
headache neuralgia, melancholia, nervous breakdown, the result of fever, periodic illness or shock,
should get it and°get well. Thousands swear by it and recommend it for use all over Australia, and to this
general end all Cfctemists and Stores sell it throughout the Commonwealth. Get it.

When you look into the mirror, and your
hollow cheeks, thin neck and scrawny arms
mock even you, what effect do you suppose they
have on those with whom you mix socially ?
A woman’s chief charm is a well-rounded
figure and full bosom. With these, thin
arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
If your bust lacks development, and you
are scraggly and attenuated, we will advise
you free, and gladly, as to how you may im-
prove your figure and beautify your bust.
WOMEN’S LACK OF
BUST
DEVELOPMENT!
We are only too pleased to tell you the
secret, for we know it cannot fail, and that
in a few weeks you will be happier, healthier,

emaciated condition. „
Thousands of women suffering the ravages
of ill-health have sought and accepted this
advice, and to-day are models of womanly
development and examples of perfect health.
The same success awaits your call. In the
wake of attenuation follow such complaints as
constipation, indigestion, bilious headaches,
internal functional derangements, etc. As
your development advances and weight im-
proves, these gradually disappear, and perfect
health results.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco
Habit by your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after
using tobacco heavily for seven years, sometimes
Boz. to lOoz. in the week. It is now 12 months
since I last used tobacco, and, although I am con-
tinually in the company of smokers, I do not have
the least desire to smoke, therefore I consider
the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my
former complaints, such as irregular Heart
Action, Dizziness, Nervousness and Stomach
Trouble, which I have every reason to believe
were caused through the use of tobacco, have en-
tirely disappeared, and are only remembered as a
hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep well, and feel
fit to face the world again. It will give me great
pleasure to recommend your remedy to others.”

The Bridges.
On the lake of the Four Cantons, where the polyglot
peoples go,
To the gem of the hills, Lucerne, when the waters
are blue and clear,
When the sun lifts the rolling mists from the heights
of eternal snow,
You may walk on the ancient bridges like men of
an elder year.
They are roofed from the sun and weather with
rufous, discolored tiles,
And one has an ancient tower that stems the force
of the flow
Of the flood of hurrying waters, drawn down from the
far defiles
To pay tumultuous tribute to the river that winds
below.
And here, in the time-worn bridges, you read, as
you pass across,
The legend of many a Switzer, the stories of old
Lucerne.
The deeds of a sturdy people, their prowess, and
gain, and loss;
Of guards of relief from Zurich, \of burghers who
rode from Berne.
For, set in the brown roof-rafters, in each triangular
space,
Is a painting that tells of tourneys, or a picture
of siege and war ;
Drawings of state processions, or quaint delights of
the chase;
Portrayals of old-time doings, by artists that are no
more.
You may follow the conte historic, the poste and
riposte of state,
The fights on the way to freedom, the failures that
breed success;
An order grown out of chaos, till a brotherhood made
them great,
And the hardihood of the mountain men triumphing
over stress.
SWITZERLAND.
C. G. A. COLLES.
Mudgee Town.
(To be read or sung with a touch of the brogue .)
I’m not standing on the platform for the gaping fools
to see:
Every train that comes to Mudgee is an empty train
to me.
Ah! me boy was quite continted to stay West and
settle down,
Till the d—n Pro-gress Committee brought the rail-
way to the town.
I am sitting by the river, listening to the sad old
song,
Where a sigh seems floating ever down the willow’d
Cudgegong.
Oh! I hate the cruel cuttings an’ embankments round
Mount Frome,
For they took me sweetheart from me and they took
me heart from home.
For he went by rail to Sydney, an’ he ne’er come
back again ;
An’ he left, where my poor heart was, just a dull an’
endless pain.
Oh! his arm was firm around me, an’ his eyes were
truest brown—
An’ I curse the day when “progress” brought the
railway to the town.
On the old coach road to Sydney there’s a mile-tree
by the track,
With a green branch pointing forward an’ a dead
branch pointing back ;
An’ the granite peaks behind it seem to wait in
vain and frown —-
They were grand before misfortune brought the rail
to Mudgee town !
I was fresher in me girlhood—-yes.! an’ greener than
the bough,
But me hands an’ heart are withered, an’ me life’s
the dead branch now.
Ah! I wonder does he flourish ? Does his track lie
up or down?
Does he curse the day whin fortune brought the
rail to Mudgee town?
Ah! I used to know in those days that a 1 woman’s
heart could ache,
But I thought that it was rubbish that a woman’s
heart could break.
Ah, but my heart was a girl’s heart, an’ a lovin’
heart at worst,
An’ a true heart to a devil!—an’ I know that that
can burst!
N.B.W.
HENRY RAWSON.
The Lady Barber.
The lady-barber soaped his chin,
With fingers soft, caressing,
She rubbed it well into the skin,
Whilst Bertie breathed a blessing—
A blessing on the Fates that gave
This new sensation to a shave;
And, as the fair deserve the brave,
His suit he started pressing.
Alas ! the bold and shameless knave
His suit was hotly pressing.
Quoth he: “There’s magic in your touch,
It has a wondrous virtue.”
She murmured: “Razor scrape you much?
Please tell me if I hurt you.”
“How sweet,” he sighed, “to rest like this!
But could you not complete my bliss
By granting me one little kiss?”
Said she: “You silly Bert, you!”
In business-tone the smiling miss,
Exclaimed, “You silly Bert, you.”
She rubbed more soap into his face,
Quoth he: “You little beauty,
I’d like to choose a time and place
To sip your lips so fruity.
I’d teach you better things in life
Than carving soapsuds with a knife;
I’m sure you’d make a stunning wife.”
Said she: “I’d do my duty.”
She liked the sound of “stunning wife,”
And said: “I’d do my duty.”
The tempter turned at this reply
(He yearned to clinch the matter).
Quoth he: “One sip before I buy!
The wedding fuss and clatter
Is not a thing you want to rush.
We could be married —-Now, don’t blush!”
But with the foamy shaving brush
The lady stopped his chatter.
In Bertie’s mouth she pushed the brush,
And stopped his lawless chatter.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and. to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

WHEN THE GREAT WAR COMES.
The Spaniard lias a reputation for putting
off inconvenient jobs till the next day; but
the Australian has beaten him out of sight
by postponing nearly all his unpleasant-
nesses till the next generation. The ex-
planation of the tendency or folly or crime,
or whatever it may be, is that the men who
rose to the top, politically and financially,
in the past were often only here for what
they could get out of the country. They
hurried back “home” as soon as they had
made their pile, or looked forward to doing
so as soon as the pile arrived. Citizens of
that sort were not likely to be concerned
abopt Australia's ultimate destiny, for they
had no ‘intention of sharing it. The "old
spirit is still at work in a modified degree.
It accounted for a good deal of the hostility
that was shown lately to universal service
and an Australian navy. “Why,” these
people argued (and reasonably enough, from
their point of view) —“why should we be
taxed' now in order to avert a problem-
atical invasion whjeh anyway is too far off
to affect our personal interests?” Only last
week T. Waddell, an ex-Treasurer of
N.S.W., put the sentiments of Australia’s
Tooths, Wilsons, Coopebs, etc., as fol-
lows :
He understood the Federal Government was going
to spend £5,000,000 a year upon defence, dragged
out of the pockets of the people by taxation. If
this were so, it would be only a short time before
the p.eople hurled such a set of incompetents from
office.
On the same principle the same gang has
fiercely opposed all the ameliorative (or, as
the “Liberal” party has it, “Socialistic”)
legislation, which in most civilised countries
is recognised now to be the only barrier
against Revolution. As the Waddell breed
of patriot views it, it is worth sowing the
seeds of future anarchy, in return for un-
taxed land and cheap labor in the present.
And the borrowing craze, as a result of
which the Australian State Governments
now owe over 200 millions sterling—equal to
upwards of £5B per head of the population
—is a direct result of the same unpatriotic
point of view.
Ever since the first Australian politician
learned how to pawn clothes, mortgage real
estate, draw bills of sale and negotiate
I O U’s, he and his successors have been en-
thusiastically doing all those things with
the public assets, and passing on the
liabilities to generations unborn. Railway
carriages and sleepers and engines which
have been on the scrapheap for decades;
public buildings which are no more; free
seed wheat for anti-Socialist farmers,_ and
free picnics for anti-Socialist politicians;
telegraph poles which the white ant has
eaten; roads which are now quagmires—all
were provided by Israel at so much per
cent. In fact, Australia’s frenzied pawn-
shop frequenters (and among the most in-
corrigible and reckless of them was, quaintly
enough, the very Waddell who now objects
to the Federal Government’s defence ex-
penditure) have behaved to this country
after the fashion of the scandalous male
parent of melodrama who turns over to his
successor a house which is outwardly fair
but which inwardly is rotten with debt and
bailiffs. Australia only reached manhood,
in a national manner of speaking, the other
day, and it has yet to learn in the bitter
school of experience the wrong its forebears
have done it. Unless it has such luck as no
other country ever had, it must assimilate
its lesson soon.
* * * *
The great peril which menaces the
majority of the Australian States (apart
altogether from the possibility of invasion)
is the likelihood of England going to war
within the next few years. N. S. Wales,
for example, in addition to the £9,884,508
which it must hand the mostly-foreign
money-lender next year, will have to find
£12,826,200 some time in 1917 and
£16,698,065 in 3923. It may be that by
1917 England will have entered on its death-
struggle with Germany. It is almost as
certain as anything can be that the great
trouble will come within the lifetime of the
present generation. No nation, not even
Germany with its teeming prosperity and
its 62 millions of inhabitants, can afford to
go on indefinitely piling up the - armament
bills. And, on present appearances, finality
in this regard can only be reached by war.
One way in which the period of interna-
tional conflict may be fixed is by estimating
how long Germany must continue arming
and training in order to reach such a stand-
ard of efficiency and strength as will justify
it in assailing Britain. And there is the
further consideration that Britain, as a
matter of self-preserVation, may elect not to
wait. At present, while the United King-
dom is at peace and seasons are prosperous
and money is cheap, it is comparatively easy
for N.S.W. to raise funds to meet its obli-
gations, at 3 per cent, discount or there-
abouts, on the London money market,
though even now the underwriters are fre-
quently left with a large proportion of a
loan on their hands. But, assuming that in
any one of the years when the State has
to' make a heavy repayment, an Anglo-
German war breaks out, the position will be
very different. N.S.W. will then be offered
the alternatives of borrowing at the old
shop at anything up to 20 per cent, dis-
count ; or of approaching America, or some
other foreign nation (which, in view of the
possible downfall of the one country that
stands between the Commonwealth’s mort-
gaged assets and their annexation by Japan,
will certainly be none too willing to lend) ;
or of repudiation. The odds are all in favor
of repudiation. The politicians, who in-
stinctively suggest the pawnshop whenever a
bridge or railway extension or wooden post-
office of Burrinjuck outing has to be paid
for, do not ponder on the horrors of life in
a bankrupt State. Every individual citizen
is hit by a national bankruptcy as hard as
each member of a family is hit when the
father files his schedule. In those days the
banks will be driven to hurriedly call in
their overdrafts in the hope of averting
ruin. In the improbable event of Aus-
tralia being in the midst of one of the amaz-
ingly good seasons it has enjoyed of late,
some of the banks’ customers may be able
to square their accounts; in the other event
they will go broke. Most of them will go
broke, anyhow. They will not burst alone.
Shops, pubs, theatrical cos., restaurants will
all follow suit. The big city landlord will
fare as badly as the small ba deblock
trader, for tenants will be too hard up to
pay rents. Land values will slump, and
ferry and gas and sugar shares will follow
suit; and the maddened capitalist won’t
even have the dreary comfort of ascribing
the calamity to Labor legislation. N.S.W.
has merely been cited here because it was
the first horrible example that came to mind.
Victoria has over 36 millions to find in the
next 14 years, and Queensland must pro-
vide £U,72S,SO0 # in 1914.
In the first place, the States ought to in-
sist on their Governments ceasing to run up
the foreign interest bill. They should also
insist on proper provision being made to
pay off the liabilities that have been already
incurred. Westralia and South Australia
are the only States which have anything
worth calling a sinking fund. N. S. Wales,
with the stupendous debt of over 90 millions,
has no real sinking fund at all, and neither
have Victoria and Queensland. If, however,
the wicked principle is accepted that the
States must go on paying their way by
pawning their socks, so to speak (and since
State Labor Governments have shown
themselves as frantic borrowers as
“Liberal” ones, the calamity may as well
be accepted for the moment, for all the
good that protest does), then the people
should at least insist that we should give our-
selves our own lOU instead of giving it to
a foreigner. A country which is dependent
on the foreigner for food or clothes or coal
is in a dangerous way, and the same applies
to money. Admittedly there has been a disposi-
tion of late years to raise'more and more
loans in Australia. Thus, while in 1901 as
much as 80 per cent, of the public debt of
Australia was held abroad, now less than 73
per cent, of it is held outside the Common-
wealth. This country would benefit wonder-
fully if it held not merely 27 per cent., but
97 per cent, of its own debt. The issue of
Treasury Bills, after the British mode],
should accelerate the movement. They would
absorb much of the fixed deposit money which
now goes to the banks. A deposit receipt
can’t be transferred like a bank-note, whereas
a Treasury Bill can: the Government is the
best of guarantors, and for a host of similar
reasons the Bills would be as popular as
are the articles the “Liberal” press brightly
termed “Fisher’s flimsies” a few months
ago. It is clear that something drastic must
soon be done to ensure that, if further money
is borrowed by the States, it, at least, shall
not be added to Australia’s outrageous for-
eign debt. States whose financial lives de-
pend on the hideously uncertain peace of
Europe are bad risks these days.
ON THE MAKING OF THE CITY
BEAUTIFUL
From an American lawyer at present in
Australia: —
At this time, when various plans are being sug-
gested for the resumption of lands in Sydney, and
there is a certainty of Australia having to face the
problem of a national capital, it may be of interest
to note how things are done elsewhere, and why. You
hear a great deal about the American millionaire,
our dash and our sudden growth ; and occasionally I
am asked: “Is it so, that you have lawns and no
fences between your houses?” What you do not hear of
is the common, garden variety of American, the mil-
lions of him; his struggles, hopes and ambitions; his
strivings after culture, happiness and home. For,
above all, the States is a place of homes. The for-
eignor—the real one, I mean —laughs at us, calls us
crude, vulgar, a sort of living cash-register and many
other things. What seems so sudden, so wonderful, to
you who are friends of our nation, to him seems
childish and crude. It’s “Look at Paris!” or this
and that other place. Well, what he misses is us.
You are a young nation, travelling much the same
road as we had to travel; and, as far as lies in my
power, I want you to know us, not as an occasional
wire may flash some new millions to Rockefeller, or
bring you word of a new scandal, but as we live and
breathe and are. A big undertaking—but we were
on the city, and to that we will stick.
* * * *
Come with me to New York —to that city in particu-
lar, because it is the biggest, is most nearly allied
with your future on your seaboard, and because I know
it best perhaps. When I was a boy New York was
hideous. Starting at the Battery, with a bit of
green and old-fashioned mostly-red colonial dwell-
ings, it went over a sea of hideousness and vulgarity
to Washington Square; patches of green at Old
Trinity and St. Paul’s, and City Hall Square; for
the rest, hideous and unintelligent! Then, above
Washington Square a sea of grim, high-storey brown-
stone houses and a park in the making. Boss Tweed
planned stupendous improvements; but his downfall
and the scandal of his motives were such as to
deaden all progress for many years. And here one
human word of a noted man, he must have been,
withal, a great one in some ways, for every important
physical improvement since then was planned by him .
Well, the first step was the forming of a municipal
art commission, entirely amateur and idealistic, at
first very impractical and unwieldy, now all-powerful
in fact and in creating and directing public senti-
ment. The activities of this commission or associa-
tion of architects, artists,-lawyers, merchants, men of
ideals and hopes, carried in every direction, forced
attention. The commission even carried the war into
the National Architect’s 'office, which was little more
than a construction department at that time, and was
putting up- hideous buildirigs that were marring the
city. Now the idea of characteristic, dignified public
buildings is a realised fact, no longer a fad of a few
“busybodies.”
* * * *
This idea of a municipal art commission has been
carried out, with variations to suit the locality and
temper of the people, throughout the Union. Cleve-
land has a permanent body seeking the best profes-
sional advice, and planning for the future. Each town
has seized the idea, and, by looking ahead, safeguards
the present, so that natural advantages —lakes, rivers,
country, mountains —are utilised and become the “pride
of the town.” Denver, Colorado, has spent thousands
in planning its plateaus and approaches to the
Rockies. And what of results? Let us go back to
New York. I was talking to a friend, highly travelled
and cultured, who occasionally “goes through’ there,
and he said: “Really very fine, those tall buildings,
very imposing! But, frankly, the rest is rather a
fad, isn’t it?” “Haven’t been above 42nd, have
you?” “Well, to a theatre once or twice.” And
there were my childhood impressions, on a fresh
mind! But had the friend taken a ’bus or a taxi he
might have gone through the Park down 72nd ; up
Riverside, an unequalled drive, park and playground ;
through trees, flowers and beautiful vistas ; on to the
La Fayette Boulevard, and to more parks and drive-
ways. As planned, there will in time be 62 miles of
beauty before my friend will be back to the 59th
again, not all of it finished, but all of it planned:
and, what there is of it, most beautiful, and all the
work of 20 years or less. But the beauties of that drive,
or the Lake drive in Chicago, or the park on the slopes
of the Rockies in Denver, are nothing compared with
the actual public sentiment, and the strivings after
beauty in private homes and public and office build-
ings. It has become a question of. “How will it
look on our block f” Even the speculator is awed,
or forced, for his goods are unsaleable if garish or
out of tune. Senator Clarke built a monstrosity
on sth Avenue, in the centre of what the foreigner
calls our vulgar millions; and the price of the op-
posite corner went down $200,000, and the propertv
was affected for some distance either way. Facts:
plain, cold facts. On the other hand, Standard Oil
interests, represented by the U.S. Realty Co., put up
an office building adjoining Trinity Churchyard, and
it is so in keeping with the sacred place as to seem
to have always belonged there. Don’t think I am
trying to tell you we are perfect. We ard not. As
Choate said of Stanford White, “He has a great
deal of taste—some of it good!” But I do say we
are striving, and that is the first step towards suc-
cess.
I have attempted to show how a movement started
here and there by a few big-minded men has gradually
forced action through public opinion, and has suc-
cessfully guided and helped that opinion until it has
swept the country and made men think for them-
selves, the idealist to study harder, the man of busi-
ness to realise the present value and future great
benefit of this idea, until each town wants precedence,
and each man, eacli home, wants to co-operate to se-
cure it. And then you have the result —our fenceless
avenues of trees and lawns, and our commons and
gardens of smaller towns ; and the multitude of othei
things, and the more things that are to be. We have
supreme confidence in ourselves and in each other—
at least as a body. It is every man to the wheels
and no backwash from anybody. The artist nature is
a generous nature, a giving nature. It feeds on
what it does, and grows and grows. We owe much to
it And in that, as in all other parts of the country s
real greatness, loom our women. If the .business
man follows and approves, it only makes the change
the easier, the quicker and the more thorough.
* * * *
This brings me to the only other practical sugges-
tion that occurs to me out of our experience, and
that is the innumerable associations we have for the
purpose of improving and safeguarding our own im-
mediate neighborhood. hot New York only, but
everv town and village, has its own provincial society
in some guise or other. Often social is
mixed with other aims, or some other form of interest
is offered. But always we remember this, that no
liodv of men, however well intentioned be they legis-
lature, civic council, or art and improvement com-
mission-can possibly take the interest or have the
knowledge that you have in your own immediate sur-
roundings. We don’t make the mistake of thinkim,
we are too big, or too little, or too many, or too few.
Or.e determined man can do more harm or good than
?0 “don’t cares,” and he will soon get 10 or 20 or
more to help him. Work ? Of course it means
work. But it is pleasant work as it grows and results
show. In the first place, your associates are mostly
cultured or high-thinking people. Interested? Well,
why not? Their interest is yours, and, as time goes
on, and you find that you have better roads, better
kerbs and sidewalks, freer air, more trees, and more
feeling of interest in the proprietorship, your pride
in your neighbor grows, and much that was hard be-
comes easy, much that was meddlesome becomes a
matter of course. At home it started in all sorts of
ways, alike in country and city. Perhaps some
“fussy” old lady put baskets tip for papers and scraps.
Perhaps some artist thought the new Town Hall (20
x 30) looked like a coffin—who knows? Perhaps a
wo’gl of praise from some great one. But it started;
and from the beginning came —everything!
Sydney alone has dozens of points, and beautiful
ones, but, so far as I know, not one local committee
looking after its neighborhood. This is not criti-
cism ; I don’t want it to be. But I want to say
that the results will come if a start is made. True,
you must get it out of your system that you can do
things overnight. Heartburns, struggles, the politi-
cian’s “glad hand,” the real-estate operator’s frowns
and sneers —all and more have had to be met and
overcome with us. and they have been met and
overcome, not at first by the man seeking to make
money, but by the man and woman seeking to make
a home, and to make it attractive and happy. That
is the States as it really is. Home, home, everlasting
home.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some More Political Sportsmanship.
0. G. Wade’s latest censure motion —an
effort which both the Sydney dailies had
reprobated as “foolish,” “blundering,” “un-
generous,” and so forth —acquired a wholly
unexpected measure of justification by the
eleventh-hour resignation of two Laborites.
It was lost, all the same. Nevertheless,
pending the return of two new legislators,
there was no likelihood of the McGowen or
any other Government being able to carry
on with dignity, in the face of set hostility;
and so Holman suggested a truce. And C.
G. Wade, the alleged patriot, the gentleman
who last April based much of his claim to
public support on the alleged fact that lie
was “a sportsman,” firmly declined to agree
to anything of the sort. It is easy to pic-
ture what “Liberalism” would have said
to a Laborite who acted similarly in a like
position. There would have been a con-
certed howl concerning the professional poli-
tician’s criminal indifference to the public
welfare when office was in the balance. The
fact that a heap of urgent business is wait-
ing to be done by someone would have been
mentioned. "What earthly justification,” it
would have been passionately demanded,
“has a politician to hold up the entire
machinery of government in order to secure
a petty personal advantage, when crowds of
non-contentious measures —the Criminal
Appeal Bill, the Consolidation of the Lands
Act, etc. —are clamoring to be handled?'
Labor’s sickening want of sportsmanship
would have been animadverted on blister-
ingly. With fancy’s ear one can listen to
“Liberalism” expounding the position as
follows : “Here is a Government 44 strong,
despite its' two defections. The Opposition
numbers only 37. And there are seven In-
dependents, whose sympathies, if their past
votes and protestations go for anything, are
with the Government. The Opposition
leader has no more hope of carrying on the
business of the House, as it is at present
constituted, than he has of drinking Sydney
Harbor dry. His grab at a position on
which, he has no shadow of a claim is an
unusually disreputable party move, inspired
by the fact that certain campaigning advant-
ages accrue to the party which is in power
when an election begins.” The N.S.W.
Liberal party said none of these things last
week, for the reason that its own leader was
the offender. In his frantic manoeuvrings ( to
push Holman into some sort of an awkward
hole at any price, Wade has shown up in a
sorrier light, perhaps, than ever before.
He was foremost in urging ex-Premier
McGowen to go to the Coronation, and
loudest in his assurances that nothing un-
toward would happen to the party as a re-
sult of its leader doing “his duty by the
State.” Yet McGowen was hardly on the
blue water before Wade was trying to oust
his administration (a move which was de-
plored even by the party press) ; and now
McGowen has been ousted. Yet last Satur-
day, the politician who has broken every
rule of the game for the last two months,
had the nerve to snuffle in this fashion :
I do not desire to discuss the general situation, be-
yond referring to the attitude of the Labor party and
the late Government, now that, according to their
own admission, they are unable to carry on, and have
resigned accordingly.
One would expect that in these circumstances, they
would adopt the ordinary attitude of an Englishman
and take their defeat'., like men. Australians are
lovers of sport and fair play, and no, real sportsman
can approve of such tactics.
It suggests a third-rate Yankee, pug chiding
an adversary for sharp ring practices.
A Matter of 4d. per Week.
A month ago, when the text of the British
National Insurance Bill arrived in Austra-
lia, this paper remarked :
One thing that is going to kill the Lloyd-George
scheme in its present form is the circumstance or
tragedy that three-fourths of Britain’s indigent
toilers, unlike those of Germany, do not earn enough
to give them a hope of finding even the paltry sum
which is required to earn the Government contribu-
tion.
In the last few days the English Laborites.
who greeted the Bill with cheers on its first
appearance, have changed front; and Labor-
leader Ramsay Macdonald has made re-
peated demands that the State shall assume
various of the burdens that the Government
proposed to put on the employees. f ol , l '
night ago Tim Healy, speaking at Cork,
said it was “exceedingly unfair to dock 4u.
per week from the miserable wages ot tm
Irish laborer.” And a little later the cab* 1
told us:—
Mr. ivEiR Hardie, M.P. (Labor), states that the
National Insurance Bill is doomed. The defects a =
closed in the measure are more serious than r
were at first imagined.
It is more eloquent of the hopelessly ston p
broke condition of Britain’s submerg
third than a thousand “hunger marcfie.
could be. Never did a Government lay
self out to do more for a body of P e °P
outside the pauper class. To achieve
benefits offered, male employees were cal
on to contribute only 4d. a week,
females 3d. a week. The State and the -
ployers, between them, were to find tne


maining cash necessary to supply 15 million
people with, among other things—
(l) Free medical attendance for life.
(2) 10s. a week in sickness for men and 7s. 6d.
for women for the first 13 weeks, and thereafter ss.
a week for both.
(3) A benevolent’ fund.
(4) A convalescent allowance.
Germany, where the alleged Curse of Pro-
tection has been in operation since ISSO,
has enjoyed a National insurance scheme
for upwards of two generations. The main
difference between the German arrangement
and that which has been proposed for Bri-
tain is that under the former the employer
and employees find the entire cost of the
contributions between them, while under
Lloyd-George’s proposal the State offers to
contribute two-ninths of the insurance
money in the case of the men, and one-
fourth in the case of the women. And even
with that vast subsidy the Freetrade worker
sees no hope of saving the few pence weekly
that are asked of him!
Wanted a Statue!
Randolph Bedford makes a call:—
Not a. statue only, but all it means —intelligent ap-
preciation of effort, love of the real leader, and re-
cognition of duty well done. And these are the
things which in their most eloquent expression Aus-
tralia has most ungratefully forgotten. Man does
not live by bread alone: hero worship must be. And
if ever a country had heroes, and, careless of them,
went lusting after false visions, that country is our
own.
A statue should have but one of two considera-
tions —the praise of beauty, or the immortalisa-
tion of worth. And these two considerations con-
demn almost every sculpture which we have in Aus-
tralia. The Sydney statues of Cook, Phillip and
Bourke are well enough; those of Albert and of
Victoria are of value neither to art nor to Australia,
and never were. Chinese Gordon, in Melbourne,
means nothing; Burke and Wills, the well-equipped
showmen who failed where dozens of ill-equipped
at&l unadvertised Australians have succeeded, are
nothing. Fitzgibbon, looking at the city that paid
him very well for being its town clerk, is as ridicu-
lous as the man was kindly and energetic; and Bat-
sman, whose pioneering work brought him less than
easne to Fitzgibbon in half-a-year’s salary, is for-
gotten. Flinders, the greatest of the world’s hydro-
gfaphers, ife a large creditor of Australia’s gratitude,
and has n6t been paid; Torres and de Quiros,
and AbEl Tasman and Dampier and D’Entre-
casteaux, Captain Sturt, McDoualt Stuart,
and Kennedy, and Mitchell, and Hovell, and Hume
are more to Australia than all the Victorias and
painfully good Alberts could ever be; and these
creditors have not been paid either.
The other day a rich and swollen Melbourne fund
materialised in the unveiling of a statue to Hope-
toun, a kindly, loveable man, an unostentatious figure-
head, whose virtues shone the brighter because of
their immediate comparison with the uncertainties
of Brassey. Hopetoun, the first Governor-General
of Australia, cumbereth the ground; in Melbourne
Charles Cameron Kingston is as forgotten as John
Batman, the currency lad who found so much that the
English had missed 31 years before him.
Everything given to the Hopetoun statue fund is a
misuse of money while Higinbotham remains only
an intangible memory. The class that subscribed
to the one would probably never pay for the other —••
the snobs have not yet forgiven the great jurist his
illuminating phrase in describing them as “the
wealthy lower orders.” But there are others, the real
people of the real Australia, who know that for the
Australia-yet-to-be Eureka was much more important
than Trafalgar.
Does the new-generation Australian know the man
Higinbotham as he was? The unswerving man of
great brain, high courage and tender heart, who chal-
lenged Constitution and Empire when he knew that
'so to do was right? The man who‘earned the hatred
of the ignorant monied class which ejected him from
Brighton, and chose Bent, much as the Jews chose
Barabbas? For the people are often Pilates,
and Barabbas has been chosen more than once.
Higin BOTHAM’S private life was sanctuary; his
public acts showed the same stainless purity.
He was incorruptible, yet with genius; simple, but
dashing and energetic; courageous, cultured and re-
sourceful. In a country where almost all forceful
men were narrow-brained and book-ignorant, he met
all adversaries at all points, and vanquished them;
but though he won, yet in the end money and cun-
ning wore out honesty and singleheartedness, for,
as in all time, a coward can deal a mortal blow to
the brave. He was beaten, and the land boom came
to show how right he had been, although, by then, the
fact that his defeat had been owing to the votes of
men who were themselves land-boomers was forgotten.
As a lawyer he put his life into the colossal labor of
codifying the statutes, in itself a monument, but one
felt more than seen. His contribution to the 1890
strike funds marked him more and more for the
hatred of the class he had cut to the bone with his
just gibe. A leading man of the agent class, on the
day the donation was published, proposed, amid gen-
eral applause, that the Chief Justice should be torn
from the bench by a company of artillery, and shot, as
a reward for his sympathy for the strikers. And
that fact should be sufficient to make every trades
unionist in Australia put up his shilling or half-crown
for a permanent memoral to Higinbotham.
Student, scholar, statesman, journalist, publicist,
jurist, and Parliamentarian, he gave his State his
best, and in giving it to his State he gave it to the
Commonwealth. His work belongs not to Victoria,
but to Australia. How many Australians are ready
to recognise the splendid life of a man the ancients
would have deified —for he was statesman and hero
both? Thousands of pounds are subscribed for well-
advertised people Australia never knew, and to futili-
ties who never mattered much to anybody. How
much is ready for a memorial to the infinitely great?
How much?
An Official Whose Ukase is Law —and Not
Always Good Law.
The N.S.W. Stamp Commissioner holds his
appointment under the Stamp Duties Act,
and it is his business to collect the duties
payable on all conveyances, transfers, pro-
bates and so forth. A couple of cases in-
volving large sums which recently came be-
fore the Supreme Court exemplified, in a
rather more glaring fashion than usual, the
dangerous powfer this official enjoys, and
likewise his arbitrary methods of using it.
In the one case, the Commissioner claimed
£7OOO stamp-diity, and in the other a some-
what smaller sum. The beneficiaries and
their legal advisers were agreed that the
Commissioner had no legal right to claim a
farthing; and that view was subsequently
upheld by the. Supreme Court. But they
were forced to pay the sum demanded of
them on the nail —as they would have been
forced to pay had it been three, four or 10
times as much—under penalty (1) of having
the deeds in the estates impounded, and the
whole business in connection therewith held
up indefinitely, and (2) of being fined
heavily for their recalcitrancy. In the case
of wealthy estates, such as the ones in ques-
tion, the injustice done is comparatively
trivial. Under the Act anyone who dis-
agrees with the assessment of the Commis-
sioner may call upon him to state a special
case, as a preliminary to referring the dis-
pute to the Supreme Court. The big man
plunges into litigation more or less cheer-
fully when he has strong reason to believe
his cause is just. Not so the poor one.
Haunted by the memory of a Wade
Government which pursued one of its
own servants to the Privy Council over
a question of a few shillings, he possesses
a healthy dread of going to Law with
“the Crown” ; and there is the further con-
sideration that the poor man may find him-
self so situated that he cannot go to law
even if he wants to. A man, for example,
dies with assets worth £20,0()0 and liabili-
ties amounting to £19,000. The Commis-
sioner puts in a claim for stamp-duty which
the executors cannot pay. But if they
don’t pay they are unable to get probate,
and the estate, consequently, can’t be real-
ised, or otherwise dealt with. Even assum-
ing, in such circumstances, that the execu-
tors managed to raise the sum demanded,
they would still require to wait months be-
fore their case came before the Supreme
Court, and also they would have to find a
big sum of ready money to meet current law
costs. When “the Crown” litigates it in-
variably briefs a strong bar, and, in general,
proceeds regardless of expense. It is not
strange, therefore, that in nine cases out of
10 the citizen who has been held up by a
demand for stamp duty which he more than
suspects to be illegal, yields miserably rather
than take his chance of financial ruin by
being dragged possibly as far as the Privy
Council in the matter. The Stamp Com-
missioner’s office is a section of the Civil
Service which fairly shrieks for reform. The
province of the Government is not to tear
revenue out of all and sundry regardless of
equity, and that being so, it is altogether
desirable that a legal expert should be
added to the strength, of this department.
His status should be that of a District Court
Judge or Master in Equity, and it should be
his province to arbitrate in all disputed
assessments between the Commissioner and
the public. His appointment should, of
course, be for life, thus rendering him inde-
pendent of the Government of the day. and
his decision should be f final. It is only by
some reform’along these lines that a parti-
cularly evil - ; state of things is going to be
remedied.
A Quack Cure for an Old Complaint.
A one-eyed professor - of practical politics,
named Lawson, M.L.A., is urging the Vic.
Government to assist manufactures in inland
centres by ordering railway concessions in
freight for raw material and finished goods,
which demand is supported by the con-
tention of Bowser, M.L.A., and others, that
“metropolitan determinations with regard to
wages and conditions of work cannot be ex-
tended to country districts unless substantial
reductions are made in fares and freights.”
Setting aside all question as to whether
the Railway Department charges op-
pressive rates or otherwise, it seems that
according to Lawson and Co., decentralisa-
tion in Victoria can be best effected by
legislating for the encouragement of inland
manufactures which would find their market
mostly in Melbourne. Because Melbourne
contains half the population of the State,
and is the greedy port where all the raw
material from abroad is unloaded, the rail-
way freights between there and certain inland
towns should, it is alleged, be greatly re-
duced —if not abolished —on behalf of de-
centralisation. As regards other country
districts afar off, it is obvious that goods
from inland manufacturing centres could
reach them more cheaply than from the
bloated metropolis; therefore a future Mel-
bourne demand for “encouraging” conces-.
sions in railway freights would be just as
logical as the present cry from Lawson’s
own particular Maryborough. Meanwhile,
Melbourne’s manufacturing interests continue
to thrive on the density of its own local popu-
lation and the lack of powerful outside com-
petition, which latter is due to the paucity
of up-country population. The Government’s
only effective way of encouraging manufac-
turers ,in inland centres can be by putting
people on the land, and opening up new
ports—natural ports —in opposition to the
Melbourne port that has stolen their natural
commercial rights. The idea bf charging the
Government railways with the cost of ereat-
ing false manufacturing centres —even if it
could be done under present Melbourne con-
ditions —is worthy only of little local minds.
♦
“Wireless.”
Thebe is trouble over the installation of
“wireless” in Australia; and the public is
becoming interested in the matter, on account
of the delay that the trouble is causing,
There are, it appears, two or three varieties
of “wireless,” or, rather, of “wireless” ap-
pliances. The Italian, Marconi, worked out
one system; other European scientists, re-
cognising the deficiencies of that system, pro-
duced the “quenched singing spark”; and,
after investigation, the British Admiralty
approved of the adoption of the latter sys-
tem for Australian use. There appears to be
now no question of its efficiency; that, in-
deed, has been amply proved in Australia,
and the Commonwealth Government has
raised no question on that score. The
trouble seems to be that the Marconi people,
with a natural desire to get their own ap-
pliances in use, breathe vague threats into
the ear of the Government that the use of the
singing-spark appliances may infringe the
Marconi patents; wherefore the Australian
Government hesitates. As a matter of fact,
these appliances, owned by an Australian
company, have been granted patent rights by
the Commonwealth : so we have the curious
spectacle of the Commonwealth throwing
doubt on the validity of its own patents.
But, apart from that, the Australian co. has
undertaken to indemnify the Australian Gov-
ernment against damages, in the extremely
remote event of the Marconi Co. making
good its claim. Everybody will approve of
the Government’s desire to avoid a pitfall;
but in this case there can be no danger—the
indemnity already given covers the Common-
wealth, or, if that indemnity is not judged
sufficient, then it is open to the Government
to demand some other guarantee. The
quarrel is really not between the Marconi
people and the Government, as purchaser of
the quenched singing-spark appliances ; it is
between the Marconi people and the seller
of those appliances. No action whatever has
been taken against that seller anywhere,
from which it may be reasonably assumed
that no action will lie. But, whether or no,
the Government is not concerned in that
phase of the matter. Its concern is merely
to get the best; and if its advisers say that,
especially when cost is taken into account,
the singing spark is best, then the singing
spark it ought to get, just as it ought to get
the other if the other were reported by its
experts to be best. The ridiculous thing just
at present is that the Government should
hesitate to adopt that course, for no better
reason apparently than that vague threats
and hints and alarms have been made—hints
and threats and alarms of things against
which the authorities can get complete pro-
tection. It recalls the time when the anti-
Federalists warned N. S. Wales of the dread-
ful things that might happen to it if it
helped to form a Commonwealth—a bluff that
nearly came off, but, fortunately, didn’t
quite. And in that case there was nobody
standing by who could offer a complete in-
demnity against those dreadful catastrophes,
such as there is in this case.
+
The Tote: Two Viewpoints.
“Pro-Book” puts the case for the Man with
the Bag:—
The N.S.W. Totalisator Bill proposes that the Gov-
ernment shall take the Tote turnover to the extent of
10 per cent.—s per cent, is to go to the Government
and 5 per cent, to the clubs which run the Tote, for
the increase of stakes and for permanent improve-
ments. Also, the clubs will take all fractions of a
shilling, which work out at 1 per cent, on the turn-
over. Therefore, the Tote is to take 11 per cent, of
all moneys invested before any dividend is declared.
Now, on an average, 198 bookmakers work the Syd-
ney metropolitan district throughout the year; eight
average £4OO a race, 20 £250, 30 £l5O, 40 £lOO,
and 100 £25, or an average total per race of £19,200
for six races each day, or a grand total of £7,488,000
for 65 days. A tax of 11 per cent, on this is
£823,680, of which the Government takes £374,400,
and the club takes £449,280. Large figures, un-
doubtedly, but substantiated by prominent members
of the ring.
Consider these facts and their bearing on the com-
munity seriatim :—
(1) The general public attends racing—a few for
the racing itself, the vast majority for the general
excitement and prospect of making money. With
the introduction of the Tote (a) the excitement and
the prospect of great gain vanish; (b) the glamor of
the noise, the joy of racing round to get the longest
odds and the satisfaction of seeing the backed horse
.shorten in price, with the possibilities of hedging, are
gone; and (c) the gambling element is reduced to
the purchase of a ticket and the automatic collection
of dividends on the winners.
(2) It is claimed the punter gets longer odds. In
practice the machine prices compare with book-
makers’ starting price as ll to 9. But before the
“books’ ” starting price is fixed, much longer odds hare
been laid; and it is clear the “book’s” average price
must be in excess of the Tote’s price.
(3) The 11 per cent, tax leaves the punters’ poc-
kets for ever, except what comes back through the
owners by way of increased stakes and through per-
sonal well-being by way of permanent improvements.
(4) The Government receives £374,400 gross.
This, under the Bill, is to be devoted to charities,
but it is not new income. The Consolidated Revenue
loses the income tax paid by the “books” and the land
tax paid on their investments.
(5) The clubs under the Bill will receive £449,280
less the cost of working the Tote. But the clubs will
lose nearly £50,000 a year in license fees, £22,000
a year in entrance fees for the “book,” his clerk and
messenger; £5OO for clerks’ registration fees, and
the decrease in the value of the bar —say. £lO a
day for 65 days = £6500; total, £79,000. Also,
there is the cost of the Tote and working exes., at
£5O a day = £2350. Grand total, £81,350.
And, lastly (6), where the Tote has been worked
for a time, as in Maoriland, what is the result?
Racing stakes increased by leaps at first, and now
are almost stationary. Tote receipts are increasing,
but not pro rata with the population. Therefore,
the public is becoming more moral, or it is tiring
of losing 11 per cent, in every investment.
To which The Bulletin replies:—
(1) (a) The fool-section of the public, which goes
racing with the object of making money out of the
almost obscenely-affluent Ring is in urgent need of
being protected against itself, (b) If the Tote is
going to do no more for N.S.W. than still the in-
fernal howls of the bookmakers, and discourage pub-
lic nuisances from galloping about in an atmosphere
of dust, profanity and rotten tobacco, in quest of
long odds, it will justify its introduction here. (c)
The probability of the Tote reducing the gambling
element among racegoers may be admitted; but the
change will leave the average citizen unperturbed.
And the “automatic” collection of dividends on win-
ners, as opposed to the existing system, under which
such dividends are often not collected at all, owing
to the “book’s” sudden departure, insolvency or what
not, will be all to the good.
(2) Undoubtedly the common or garden punter
does get longer ‘odds from the Tote. Those who
occasionally do a bit of good fo.- themselves under
the present arrangement (at the ultimate expense, in
every case, of the general public) are the “big
punters,” professional backers, commission workers,
and so on. Their operations are responsible, directly
or indirectly, for about 95 per cent, of the stiffened
horses, jockevs and trainers, and for about the same
proportion of the ground and lofty swindling gener-
ally, which disfigure the N.S.W. and Victorian turf.
(3) It is a bookmaker’s yarn, as old as it is
fallacious, that the 11 per cent. Tote tax “leaves the
punters’ pockets for ever” ; while, inferentiallv, the
percentage taken by the Ring does not. Sol Green
has invested upwards of £ 50,000 in Sydney house-
property, and £lOO,OOO in Melbourne property, in the
last few years. The money which has gone into those
investments has left the punters’ pockets as absolutely
as the cash which the smaller penciller puts into
diamonds, champagne and villas at Randwick.
(4.) “The Government... .will lose the income tax
paid by the ‘books’ and the land tax paid on their
investments.” But the “books” are not going to
become Domain-loafers when their present occupation
is gone. Presumably, they will earn money at some-
thing else. And, meanwhile, under the Bill, the
State hospitals will be £374,400 per annum to the
good.
(5) The £81,350 which “Pro-Book” claims will
be lost to the racing clubs by the abolition of the
“books,” is a somewhat inflated sum. The Tote, for
example, by attracting more racegoers, will probably
swell rather than diminish the bar-receipts; and the
expenses of the Tote are not likely to approach £5O.
a day. The machine is worked by three clerks. At
Longehamp and Auteiul the Totes are worked by
regular employees of the clubs as part of their ordin-
ary duties. In any case, it is really the N.S.W. public
which pays over £70,000 per annum for the privilege
of betting with bookmakers. Racegoers will assur-
edly accept the loss of the Ring with fortitude, pro-
vided the clubs use their new incomes—the sum
vvhich stands for the past income of the “books”—to
give the public cheaper and more comfortable racing,
increased stakes, and such-like benefits.
Item (G) doesn’t impress this paper as enough of
a tragedy to be worth controverting.

The Union Jackals who were waiting on the
wharf to drag Andrew Fisher down, and
meantime were fouling the Labor party, have
had a piece of bad luck. Fisher might have
said just about all he was reported to have
said without saying anything dreadful,
though, if he had said it, he certainly might
have said it in a better way and at a better
time; but he cuts off the jackals’ tails by re-
pudiating the whole business, and unloading
the responsibility on to Stead- —or Julia,
the spirit lady who guides Stead’s hand.
It seems about time Stead sacked Julia.

Now that they have laid down the burdens
of office, Holman, Beeby and the other State
Frighters may have time to sum up the net
results of their action during the Referenda
Campaign. Within the year they have —
(1) Defeated the biggest and best attempt to
control monopoly, aggressive capitalism, and private
company-sharking ever made by a party in this
country ;
(2) Disintegrated the great Labor party;
(3) Rehabilitated the “Liberal” press, the “Lib-
eral” party and the “Liberal” influence which had
been east down by the Federal and N.S.W. State
elections;
(4) Disheartened the rank and file of the Labor
workers, discouraged the Labor sympathisers who
make Labor Governments possible, and paralys'ed
organisation. <;
It will need a severe surgical operation to
rip out the provincialist cancer from the La-
bor movement. But it must be done, even
though in the process ten times as many pic-
turesque figures had to be sacrificed by the
scalpel.
Some time ago a few enthusiasts formed
an Anti-Asiatic League in Maoriland, and
tried to convince the white man that the
easy way to knock out the competition of
tne degrading yellow man was to quit pat-
ronising the agony. The League presently
found that, though the M.L. Government
was howling Empiah, and shouting Dread-
noughts, it wasn’t giving a hand to those
who were doing their little bit towards
strengthening the position of the white rape.
Allegedly white Labor inspectors allowed
discolored aliens to keep their fruit-shops
and laundries open when the decent white
was compelled to close, and latitude was
allowed them in other ways, on the ground,
apparently, that they were. only “blanky
Cnows,” or “asterisk Dagoes.” So the
League asked the Government about it; and
the comforting reply of Minister for Labor
Miller was that “you will no doubt under-
stand that it is quite outside the province
of any Minister to interpret an Act of Par-
liament; which is under his administration.”
It no doubt may be outside the capacity of a
Minister to interpret an Act; but if he
doesn’t try to do it, Heaven alone knows
how he is going to administer it. Appar-
ently. when it comes to giving a lift to the
white race, the M.L. Government’s idea is
that it should be so densely ignorant about
the meaning of every Act that it shouldn’t
attempt to enforce even its most obvious
provisions.

Bruce Smith stumbles over himself in ob-
jecting to the D.T.’s unintoxicated and un-
usually Australian view that the Brit.-Jap.
treaty-renewal is a good thing, in that it
gives Australia time to complete its defence
preparations. The fatuous old gentleman’s
belief is that all “doubts” (about Jap aggres-
sion) are now' at rest by reason of the
treaty; as if treaties had never become waste
paper; as if self-interest were not thbir
only binding agent; as if diplomacy could
not and does not break the most honorable
of understandings in the most dishonorable
of ways, and find highly virtuous reasons
for doing it! What is a treaty but a truce,
and is a truce anything but breathing space
for the armorer V “England has made ius
safe against Japan,” he says ; and there is
no truth in that either, because only our-
selves can make us safe, though the Panama
Canal can help us by helping America.
Further, Australians are “being asked to
get ready to do something which they can
never hope to be able to do” (presumably
the repulsion of an invader), and it “would
be better to preach a spirit of international
amity tow’ards our declared friends.” Natur-
ally the place to buy “the spirit of inter-
national amity” is the pub of Mr. B. and S.,
who believes in a German bogey against
England, but refuses to admit of a .jap
bogey for Australia. Finally Mr. B. and S.
has “always foreseen that Australia would
have to shake hands with Japan some day,”
which proves absolutely that he knows
nothing about the sentiment of White Aus-
tralia. He can talk of the “aggressiveness”
of a country deciding to defend itself
against aggression, and yet lie could en-
dorse the crime of the Boer war because the
criminals were not common Australians but
Heaven-born Britons. What he is doing in
an Australian Parliament no man can dis-
cover. To Australian sentiment he is as
foreign as a cinder in the eye.
During the Referenda uproar, the Weary-
Watt Ministry _and its Melbourne press
allies made frenzied appeals to the electors
to “vote No and preserve the Wages Board
system” ; and Fat men, whose hatred of any
interference with “the law of supply and
demand” was notorious, yelled their loudest
in favor of the same Boards, as against the
On the Edge of War.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Friday.—The Prime Minister said the
Moroccan situation had become difficult and harass-
ing.— Cable.
The deep-sea cables have spoken
’Neath keels of the waiting fleets ;
Now the long, long truce is broken,
And rumors harry the streets.
Unarmed in the house of Britain,
Unarmed and alone we snore,
With our hist’ry yet unwritten —
And Ma on the edge of War!
A fig for the Coronation,
And the smiles of Kaiser Bill !
They gave him a fine ovation
When he drove up Tower Hill!
What is the worth of his bowing
And what of his kingly call?
Lo! here are the nations rowing!
(Last month he danced at the hall!)
The princes may intermarry,
And visit, and brag, and breed;
But it’s Capital plays Old Harry—
And Labor supplies the bleed ;
When Money is wild there’s worry,
And battleships—pretty things !
Start raising steam in a hurry,
And nobody heeds the kings.
It’s Labor must do the fighting,
Or pay for the Jingo brag,
And keep all the scribblers writing,
Each one for his screaming rag;
The spoils go not to the victors
Who fight when they get the range,
But the gold-scaled boa-constrictors
Who swallow the world on ’Change.
We wait for the clash titanic,
For the first red flash and roar,
For the fall of stocks, the panic
That follows the blast of War;
But not as a well-armed nation
In a solvent land afar;
We shake like a poor relation
’Neath the Dear Old Flag of Ma!

a volume of about 300 pages to list the reductions

MOTOR CARGO BOAT VOYAGE.
LAST week a Motor Cargo Boat, 40 tons
register, installed with a 40-h.p. “ INVIN-
CIBLE ” Slow Speed Heavy Duty Engine,
we have sold to Mr. J. Mackenzie, of Merinihula,
made the trip from our Works at Woolwich Dock
to that port.
There was some heavy weather south of Jervis
Bay, and Mr. Mackenzie’ writes that for some three
hours the boat was continually deluged. The
voyage took 30. hours, a good record, as the boat
was carrying a fair cargo and had to contend with
such rough weather.
Mr. Mackenzie concludes : “ A feature of the trip
was the easy running of the engine, whose CLOCK-
WORK REGULARITY never ceased throughout
the entire journey of over 208 miles, doing all that
was asked of it in a highly satisfactory manner.”

Federal Arbitration Courts. Just about that
time the Weary Government was trying to
establish a few more of the blessings; and
it managed fairly well so long as the bless-
ings were confined to the towns. It hap-
pened, however, that two of them splashed
out into the country and dealt with mining
and dairying. Both these proposals excited
the House of Fat; but eventually they were
passed, though the Dairying Board’s opera-
tions were limited to workers in butter and
similar factories. That was several months
ago; but, up to date, there has been no sign
of the constitution of a Dairying Board. It
requires an Order-in-Council to set things
moving, and apparently Watt is either too
tired or too Tory to get the formal order
signed. Yet this Wages Board is urgently
needed. There are 221 butter-factories and
creameries in the State, and only about 21
of them pay decent wages and observe fair
conditions. In addition, many new milk
factories are starting, and a big German co.
is going to begin making casein out of skim
milk all over the Western District. Also,
there are numbers of big private cheese fac-
tories. It is merely a matter of justice
that these new and projected concerns shall
be told without delay what wages they will
have to pay and what conditions they will
have +0 observe. The time is thus certainly
“ripe” for the establishment of the pro-
mised Board; and since Watt and his
friends gave the system such an unqualified
blessing last April, they can have no excuse
for not hurrying along with it.
♦
C. G. Wade is the N.S.W. Labor party’s
best asset at present. lie is so cantanker-
ous, so blundering, so utterly impossible as a
leader of the opposing party. Nothing but
blind cantankerousness could have been re-
sponsible for the bad break he made last week.
After two members of the almost evenly
divided House had resigned, Holman asked
for a truce till the vacant seats were filled.
A leader who knew how to make the best
of a poor position would have promptly con-
sented ; and up would have gone his reputa-
tion as a “sport.” But Wade, the champion
blunderer,, snarled a refusal. Holman, of
course, had him in a cleft stick. “Then
form a Government of your own!” he said ;
and Wade was sent for. At just about that
point Wade woke up to his own folly.
With no possible hope of carrying on, he
had to decline the Commission. In other
words, while he declined to allow Holman
to carry on the business of the country, he
refused to carry it on himself, because he
couldn’t. In the circumstances there was
nothing for it but for the Lieut.-Governor to
send for Holman, tell him in effect that
Wade was a person who threw bricks and
then scuttled round the corner, and ask
Holman to carry on on precisely the terms
which he had asked for at the very first —-
that is, with the help of a prorogation till
the vacancies had been filled. No wonder
that even the Daily Telegraph draws
Wade’s attention to the hole where lie
fell in, and remarks: “The Government’s
strategy has been entirely successful.”
The N.S.W. political tangle screeches once
more for the Elective Ministry. Only a few
months ago the country was put to the
great expense of a general election. The
McGowen Government then arrived, and
Ministers tackled departments of which they
had previously no personal knowledge, except
as outsiders. After six months they prob-
ably begin to know something about the
work and the executive officers. Now, how-
ever, though the Labor Minister of, say, Edu-
cation may have proved himself a better ad-
ministrator than any of his predecessors for
20 years past, and though it would be a
great advantage to the State to keep him in
the job, he must go out if a bare majority of
the members do not agree with one fragment
of the policy of one Minister. Even the general
policy of that one Minister may have the
cordial approval of a majority of the House,
which may also have the highest opinion
of him as an administrator; but the ninetv-
and-nine things don’t count in the stupid
game of party politics—the one thing counts
for everything. The stupidity didn’t matter
much, perhaps, when there were no great
business departments of State; but, to-day,
the State is a huge commercial concern, and
this constant shuffling of portfolios, and their
allotment with hardly any regard to the
personal fitness of the holders to do the solid
work of business management, must have a
most serious effect. How, for instance, would
a business house in the city fare if all the
heads of departments or even all the
directors were liable to be tossed out at a
moment’s notice, because one of them pro-
posed to do something of which the share-
holders disapproved? And how much worse
would it fare if there were a hard-and-fast rule
that, no matter how supremely able one or
more of those men were, they should not be
qualified to go back to their old places on the
re-shuffle ?
Last week an Adelaide Civil servant, wear-
ing an 1.5.0. label, announced his intention
of “pistolling with his own hand” anyone
who was responsible for the hauling down of
the Union .Tack in Australian waters. Ac-
cording to a cable message (31/7/T1). one
of the terms of the Naval Agreement is
The ships of a Dominion shall fly a White Ensign
as the emblem of the authority of the Crown, with
the' Dominion’s own flag at the .jaekstaff.
And the jaekstaff is where the U. Jack has
flown hitherto. If the S. Aus. Jingo is other
than an utterer of sound and blither, signi-
fying nothing, the lives of Asquith and his
colleagues shouldn’t be worth more than a
few weeks’ purchase.

11. B. Irving will be seen in “Louis XI.”
at Her Majesty’s .(Sydney) next Saturday.
Modern thinkers hold that the eleventh
Louis was, among other things, the first oi
the Wowsers; and, indeed, Sir Henry
Irving’s portrait of the monarch, gibbering
insanely to the silver images on his hat, re-
called, vividly, the fanatical parson wor-
shipping the futile gods Sabbatarianism,
Teetotalism, etc. This role is said, by the
London critics, to be one of the finest stage
things that H. B. Irving does.

On Saturday night William Anderson will
break out in three places simultaneously in
Sydney—-pantomime, at the Palace; drama,
at the Criterion; monologuery, at the
Y.M.C.A. Asked what a Person was to do
about it, the new three-card man said a
Person could (1) take his choice and send
his family round to the other place; (2)
book a seat for each of the shows, and, with
the aid of a taxi-cab engaged for the night,
see a little of them all; (3) draw lots for
it. Which doesn’t seem to relieve a Per-
son’s predicament.
A MAID OF HONOR at HER MAJESTY’S, SYDNEY
The Maid (Dorothea Baird) appeals for her lover's life. Cromwell (Frank Tyars) refuses it
“The Power of the Cross,” the new' melo-
drama at the Adelphi, is a weird mixture of
mystery and sensation, the weirdness being
mostly supplied by a villainous half-cousin of
the dreadful vampire. ' This cheerful gentle-
man, Baron Woulfe Curzola —had devils
all these foreigners are! —wanders up and
down seeking whom he may devour; and be-
fore he is finally stiffened by the “Power of
the Cross,” he has bagged six victims, three
of whom die. Incidentally, there is one mur-
der, one case of arson, several attempts at
homicide, and a forgery. The plot thickens
through; the villainy of Rita Lascelles, and
culminates in her death (another of the
little jobs of the vampire), followed (as the
proprieties demand) by the end of Curzola.
H. W. Diver is the villainous vampire of
foreign extraction, and it is a part he could
play in' his sleep. Robert Inman hasn’t
much chance as Gerald Fairfax, the good
young man who is lured to destruction by
the bad woman; Cecil Mannering does well
as Leslie Fairfax, especially in the lost-
memory scene; Timothy O’Dowd and Dolly
Gray (J. P. O’Neill and Ethel Buckley) are
the two funny persons who are not victims
of the vampire, which show's how malevolent
a vampire can be: Margaret Seaton (Louise
Hampton) and Blanche Kingsley (Essie
Clay) suffer in silence; and Nellie Fergusson,
as Rita Lascelles, the villainess, is respon-
sible for most of the dreadful trouble.

“Sergeant Brue” yields up his place at
Sydney Criterion to “The Man from Out-
back” on Saturday next. The outback per-
son is one of those who pass their stage life
in an atmosphere of frantic excitement—a
hero to whom firearms and assault and bat-
tery are as necessary as the breath or life or
salary.
The immensely-popular “Merry Widow”
will supplant the extraordinarily-likeable
“Balkan Princess” at Sydney Theatre Royal
next Saturday.

Joseph Blascheck makes a hurried de-
scent on. Sydney with William Anderson as
engineer-—which shows that Anderson aims
at steering more than.one kind of aeroplane.
Upon an Australian foundation Blascheck
has built a solid European reputation as a

of Miss Mildred Wrighton he will give the
first of his Mel B. Spurr-like shows at the
Y.M.C.A. Hall on Saturday night.

Millie Doris continues to be a tower of
strength and a blizzard of mirth at the
National Amphitheatre. Other attractions

Lamberti, the musical impersonator, with
his fine library of whiskers, supplies the
chief novelty of the week at Sydney Tivoli.
As Liszt and Paderewski, he ripples the
keys of the yawning grand ; as Hollmann, he
embraces a ’cello; and, as Sarasate, he lov-
ingly nurses the ’cello’s little brother. This
sort of turn, besides entertaining, is an ob-
ject lesson on the importance of Hair; the
difference between one celebrity and another
never seems to be more than a pair of eye-
brows, a slight rearrangement of the roof
garden, and a handful of whiskers. The
success of Pastor and Merle, a mixed eccen-
tric team, is principally due to the male
partner, who tumbles entertainingly, and
gives a joyous imitation of Sousa. The bird-
like Alcide Capitaine, Ted Kalman, Binns
and Binns, Fanny Powers, and the Austra-
lian Dartos are the other headliners. The
bioscope assists with some interesting
pictures of the naval review' at Spithead.
Emile Lazern, illusionist, and Marguerite
Ismay and Co. are announced for Friday
night.

The Lyric Picture Theatre has this week
starred the Coronation Naval review, along
with that good old dramatic stand-by, “The
Temptations of a Great City.” The naval
review pictures are away ahead of the Cor-
onation series, which, one way and another,
were disappointing. “The Panama Canal”
arrives with to-night’s change of programme
—a great film of the world’s biggest engin-
eering job. Colonial 1 has had a good edu-
cational study of the boot industry, and fol-
lows it with another, “The, Rome Exhibi-
tion.” “The Indian Sharpshooters” and
Pathe’s Gazette—the latter putting current
Australian news in a nutshell—have been the
most graphic features at Colonial 2. To-
night’s new films include “lee Effects iu
Odessa,” and there ought to be something
worth looking at in that.

Saturday’s bill at Melbourne 1 loyal will
be “Lady Frederick,” the bright comedy in
which Miss Ethel Irving reached a top rung
of celebrity in Smokeville some four years
ago. “Lady Frederick” is limited to three
acts, so the programme has a tail-piecelet,
written by H. A. Jones for Miss Irving, and
entitled “Dolly’s Little Bills.” Meanwhile
there are two more nights of the co. in the
story of the wife who made herself a widow
and the barrister who blew himself out.

The amateurs have presumably retired
from the field at the Princess’s, taking their
baggage and their bouquets with them. The
“Hook of Holland” Co. ran for six nights
and finished with a bit in hand, after which
the “Veronique” Co., starting last Saturday,
was to run for three nights. The beginning
was deplorable and the end was probably
shocking.
J. C. Williamson, Ltd., is about to resume
business at the Princess’s for a while. On
Saturday begins a one-week season of “The
Silver King,” the drama which promises to
live so long that, when it dies of natural de-
cay, it will probably be resurrected in the an-
tique costumes of the period when it was born.
William Desmond is to figure beauteously iu
the name part, and an interestingly new cast
will include Atholwood as Dan’l Jaikes.
Atholwood has been a very mixed lot of old
men in his time, but Melbourne has rarely,
if ever, seen him as a very meek and mild
old man, in a poor but virtuous bell topper.

At Her Majesty’s the nights of “Our Miss
Oibbs” are numbered to Saturday, when
Melbourne will say of the “record-smashing
success” that it was an excellent show of
millinery and costumes, and a sufficiently-
pleasing kind of musical comedy in the alto-
gether. After the last echoes of “Dip-ti-
giddy” have dissolved into silence, the
present theatre will pass away, and
the public will see it no more. A
new and festive-looking Her Majesty’s is to
reopen three weeks later, and a crowd of
recollections incidental to the occasion have
already booked their seats, so to speak. The
hand of destiny and the decrees of fate have
operated on the house so often during its
career that its remnants of identity with the
original Alexandra might as well be torn off
and distributed as souvenirs.

At the King’s the second and last perform-
ance of a casual passing revival of “The
Christian” comes due to-night (Thursday) ;
therefore persons desirous of seeing John
Storm converted from fanaticism to Kissti-
anity by Miss Quayle, of the music-’alls, had
better haste to the spectacle. On Saturday
a new strength of Anderson forces will be
brought to bear on “Tommy Atkins,” a
drama George Rignold staged at the Loyal
long ago. Two of the prime movers in this
military outbreak will be Walter Baker and
Miss Ross.
* * *
A new turn at the Opera House is pro-
vided by a pair of roller-skaters, whereof the
male partner exploits the art of step-dancing
on rollers as though they didn’t roll at all.
and the lady partner responds to a recall (or
she did last Saturday, anyhow) by leading
forth an infant child, as though this evidence
of her maternity were expected to melt the
audience to tears. Another new turn is com-
posed of two jugglers, both male, who are
about as fresh and original as their old im-
plements of trade will permit. The strong
man of the two plays with a cannon-ball in
Cinquevallian style, whilst the mature low
comedian preserves an air of youth in an
Eton jacket. There are other people, old
and new, including the lugubrious evergreen
Dawson. Also, one of the turns is a flicker-
graph, which is no better than it ought to
be, considering that it reflects on the
majesty of King George, and the glory of
the British Navy.

At West’s Building, Melbourne, ■ large
crowds have watched George proceeding to
have his hair oiled, attended by a quite un-
necessary amount of horse and menial. Of
other features on Saturday’s programme
“The Two Sides” provided a blinding con-
trast between riches and poverty; “Red
Eagle” narrated a white man’s hunt for a
colored maid; and “On the Bengal Coast”
supplied an interestifig view of black brother
and his capacity for doing a little work in a
long while.

At the P’ran Lyric (Vic.) the Coronation
picture has been moving across the screen,
with, a convoy of plain and colored films to
port and starboard. Among the latter “The
Gorges de Loup” acquainted people with a
part of France which has many recommenda-
tions to the searcher for scenic effects. “How
Bella Was Won,” a familiar Dickensian
story, exhibits some notably clever acting, and
“The Barber of Seville,” which was shown
on Friday, gave all the points of Beau-
marchais’s play, to the sweet accompaniment
of Rossini’s music.

The Sheffield Choir has had a triumphant
short season in Adelaide, crowding the Exhi-
bition with whatever it put up. “The
Dream of Gerontius” was by common con-
sent the best thing done, and_ in that the
Howls of the Demons were the'most striking
feature. (Thus is illustrated once hjore the
old adage, “Hell for Society”!) There was
no municipal reception for the Sheffielders.

hospitality) having left word before he

West’s promptly reply with a building
scheme of their own. All the “palaces” are
now hard at work with Naval Review pic-
tures, which naturally got a better chance
than the Coronation itself. “A Fool There

Died last week, in the Far West
(N.S.W.), the Rev. Wilfred Mailler, who
was held in more than ordinary esteem by his
parishioners in the Mulga country. He had
had a varied experience of life before enter-
ing the Church, and wrote some good verse
for The Bulletin.
Premier Jack Verran told the S.A. As-
sembly the other evening that the chief fac-
tors in the defeat of the recent Federal Re-
ferenda proposals were Ananias and Judas
Iscariot. Unfortunately the modern Judas
isn’t as sensitive as the old one, who went
and hanged himself.
From Sydney Telegraph (31/7/T1) :
A Liberal threat: “We will placard Mudgee with
the words, ‘Vote for Labor and the hauling down of
the Union Jack.’ ”
And the same morning the leader of “Liberal-
ism” was reported to have said:—
Australians are lovers of sport and fair play, and
no real sportsman can approve of Labor tactics.
“Der”: Broome (W.A.), horrorstricken at
the Australian Government’s intention to
abolish Asiatic labor in the pearling in-
dustry, says it only sticks to the colored man
because the white is no good for diving. For
all that, it gives all, or nearly all, its shorn
jobs to the smtidgy races. The municipal
council employs one European laborer, and
he drives the sanitary cart.
It is pretty difficult to get a judgment re-
versed in the S. Aus. Supreme Court, as
S. Aus. owns only three Judges. So. when
the _ judgment of any of them is appealed
against, the Full Court consists of himself —
and naturally lie thinks he was right all
along—and two others, both of whom have
to be persuaded that he was wrong. Any-
body who appeals is, therefore, “laying a bit
to nothing.” Yet a widow-Woman has man-
aged it; and, moreover, she has managed it
against the powerful municipal Trust that
runs the tramways. Her husband was a
country carrier, and was jogging along a
suburban road, on a dark, wet night, when a
car came up behind—at 20 miles an hour, it
is suggested—bunted into his van, and upset
it, killing him on the spot. In the widow’s
action for damages, Judge Gordon held that
he was on the line at his own risk, and re-
fused to let the case go to the jury at all.
His colleagues, Way and Homburg, have
agreed, on appeal, that this was wrong.
They don’t say' that the Trust was to blame,
but they consider that it is a fair thing for
the opinion of a jury. So the questions of
light and speed and so on have to be threshed
out all over again, to the great joy of Costs.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Coronation letters to hand indicate that George’s un-
paralleled show was a faiilure, owing to the excessive
barricading which offended and frightened off the
walking classes, who were expected to provide the
loud cheers. There was Some hooraying, certainly;
but it was thin and heavily adulterated with silence.
Stage-manager Churchill is blamed for the compara-
tively poor audience drawn by the performance. For
fear that one of his kings* should be trumped with a
bomb, he excluded nearly all the jacks, spades and
clubs, and played only with kings, queens and dia-
monds. It resulted in a dull game.
“Meljh”: Her Majesty’s closes for three weeks.
Melba said the acoustics were not quite good enough
tor her opera season ; but it is not this alone that
causes the Williamson people to spend £5OO0 —the
third time they have touched up this play house,
which holds more than any other in Australia. 1
hope the pit will get a better view. The theatre was
built by Joubert, as the Alexandra, on the model of
the Vienna Ring theatre, and was opened about the
same time as the new Princess’s, 26 years ago. The
site appeared very bad, yet the theatre has obviously
not suffered on that account. Joubert, who had been
secretary of the N.S.W. Agricultural Society, pos-
sessed a right instinct; but the success was not for
him. In the early part of 1900 Williamson was hard
pressed by his late partner, Musgrove, who secured
a monopoly of the Princess’s. The Alex, had been
almost a persistent failure, except in spurts. Wil-
liamson took the haza'rdous-looking step of leasing
the forlorn place, and re-chYistened it Her Majesty’s.
By a lucky accident he opened on Mafeking Night,
with “11.M.5. Pinafore.’/ Now the theatre ranks
only second to the Royal, and the erstwhile vic-
torious Princess’s has declined to dispute the third
place with the King’s.
From London: Eileen Castles made her London
debut under the wing of the massive and melodious
Clara Butt, at a Saturday afternoon “grand pat-
riotic concert,” in the Albert Hall. The concert was
called patriotic partly because it was held a few days
before the Coronation, and partly, because Clara’s
Kenner ley was to warble a couple of new songs about
Mary’s George—songs which were most unmercifully
slated by the critics for their banality. West-
minster Gazette wonders how Rumford had the
“hardihood” to present them to an intellectual aud-
ience. The Westminster describes Eileen as “a
young Australian soprano with a pretty voice which
is deserving further cultivation,” and adds a hope
that she will “put more expression and individualitv
into her singing.”. The Daily Chronicle says,
“Pleasing quality, but lacks power.” And the
Morning Post thought she sang “with sweetness of
voice and purity of means”—a peculiar way of put-
ting it.
“On Behalf of the Push”: Bli-me, this doin’ away
with the queue in Sydney is all right. Things have
been gettin’ that way lately that a bloke hasn’t got
a hope of bungin’ in a bit of stoush without 10
Jonathan Dunns lobbin’ on ’im like a lot of ’ounds.
But what sort now ! Oeky doclcy; spare the crows!
Wait till the mob gets into the lovely scrum when

couple of the lads ’ll get in some fancy exercise, I
do think. And what about liftin’ a bit of sugar?
How will the crooks be doin’! And the blokes what
cottons to pullin’ women about! They’ll all be
havin’ a fly. But not for mine. Jobbin’ is good
enough for Ginger; and the jOity Council joint
what’s brought it to me door, so to speak, is a
jujube. He’s a bontoshterino.
lan Penny, the somewhat bulky and beautiful
young man who Orlandoed to Lily Brayton’s Rosa-
lind in Australia, has seemingly dropped out of the
Asches’ co. When they revived “As You Like It”
for Tree’s recent Shakspeare Festival in London,
young George Relph was the Orlando. Grimwood
and Tripp Edgar repeated their excellent work as
pious old Adam and amiable courtier Le Beau, who
are, when fitly impersonated, the most convincing
characters in the play. Even the artificial Penny
was made to look real what time Adam fed him
with moral discourse, or Le Beau briskly advised
him to escape from the jurisdiction of the usurping
Duke.
A very foolish young man, named Eckard, at
Rockhampton (Q.), battled against Nature for 74
hours continuously on roller skates, and thus estab-
lished another silly record. When finished, his feet
were so swollen that the boots had to be cut off.
And probably his head was no smaller than it had
been.
Napier (M.L.) has accepted a Melbourne archi-
tect’s plans for a municipal theatre to seat 1600.
The playbox will cost about £20,000. Welling-
ton Opera House Co., after long years of stalling off
the inevitable, is also going to bang a saxpence or
two, and has decided to knock up a new theatre (not
on the old site) at a cost of £70,000. There has
been quite an epidemic of theatre-building in M.L.
during the past couple of years, and at the present
rate of progress there will soon be as many show
houses as pubs, and, after the clustering I O U, pubs
are the country’s most numerous asset.
“Vagabond” : It is probably true that Monday or Wed-
nesday is as good a night as Saturday so far as the
play goes (B. 27/7/’ll), but personally I prefer the
Saturday night, because half the enjoyment of it is
in the thought that to-morrow will be Sunday, and
we’ll have no work to do. If a fellow “does” a
show with a pal, he is apt to have a gingerbeer or
two, and he will have them in a lot more peaceful
frame of mind if he knows that in the morning,
even if he is a few minutes longer a-bed, he won’t
have to try to put his boots on with one hand and
perform circus acts with a poached egg with the
other. And if he trots his best girl to the theatre,
the result is much the same. So, Saturday night’s
show for mine, thank’ee.
A private cable, received in Melbourne, savs that
Evelyn Scotney, who went with Melba to Europe,
has been engaged to sing in grand opera in Boston.
Miss Scotney’s soprano has been manicured by Mar-
chesi.
“B. J.H.0.”: Edward Branscombe offered to take
the amateur Repertory combination, which put up
such a fine performance of “John-Gabriel Borkman,”
in Melbourne, to Adelaide for a brief season. He
was willing to pay all expenses and take all risks,
and whack profits (if any). Only the inability of
several of the principals to disentangle themselves
from their daily toil kept the co. in Melbourne.
“O. Ocknev”: “Wing,” when he tells other Pov-
erty Pointers they’re wrong (8.. 20/7/’ll), and him-
self does not “speak by the card,” cannot, of course,
object to being put right. So here goes. Beerbohm
Tree was not, as “Wing” alleges, the original Rev.
Spalding in the “Private Secretary.” Original as
far as London is concerned, decidedly; but the farce
was tried “on the dog” in the country weeks before
the metropolis sampled it. It ( was produced at the
T. R., Cambridge (afterwards/going on to the rival
’Varsity city), with a clever little mummer, yclept
Arthur Helmore, in the role of the goloshed and
bath-bun’d individual. When the piece got its
London production a “name” was wanted, and Tree
was engaged for the part. Helmore, the original,
was subsequently given a show on tour, and then
everybody said he copied Tree.', ,As a matter ,o,f fact
he did, for Tree did a lot in inventing “business,”
and generally building up the 'part. His perform-
ance, indeed, no matter what “Wing” may say as
to the character not being “of much account at
first” was a tour de force, and, practically made a
“go” of the piece—which didn’t “go” at all at
the start. Penley took up the Rev. Robert when the
show moved from the Prince of Wales (then
Prince’s) to the Globe, and when its success was
assured. By the way, “Dot” Boucicault figutes in
the programme of the original Cambridge produc-
tion —as actor, not stage-manager. He played
the son of “the Squire in the red coat,” Harry
Marsland by name.

Veteran H. P. Lyons, who was touring Maorilanc]
in advance of “Nicola,” has broken down, and has
returned to his home in South Melbourne. The an-
cient is in his 7lst year, and has been “travelling”
most of his life. It was he who brought Blondin to
Australia.
“Harrison O.”: Gregan McMahon intends running
an Australian night, in connection with his Reper-
tory Theatre, in December. A couple of brain-
children, whose parentage is blushfully acknowledged
by Louis Esson and Blamire Young, will crave at-
tention, and one of “Billy” Moore’s pieces may be
revived. McMahon is anxiously awaiting the arrival
of a first-class Australian drama, but so far he has
not heard the thud in his letter-box.
“Ami”: It would indeed be ridiculous to call
George Rignold a one-part actor. To be sure, his
Henry V. whips the whole record, but that is be-
cause his physical qualifications have left such as
Calvert, Coleman, Benson and Waller hopelessly in
the shade. Brooke acted it in Australia; Kemble,
Macready, Phelps and C. Kean acted it in London.
But all such great men would resign it after seeing,
point device, the very man, in Rignold. Yet it was
somewhat of an artistic misfortune to be chained on
to Harry for about 2000 performances, to satisfy the
craving appetite of America and Britain. What a
beautiful performance was his Colonel Challis, in
“Alone.” He toured Australia with this, followed by
“Black-eyed Susan,” and surely, since T. P. Cooke,
there was never such a breezy William ! His Claude
Melnotte was a New York matinee furore; his
Othello the best in Australia since Brooke. His Cali-
ban is remembered in London, and towers above the
eccentricities of Tree and Bensoii in the part. The
only man to equal George R. in it 7 will be Asche.
“Snell” : The procession of weird objects in frocks
and feathers at the investiture of the Prince of
Wales with the order of the boyang, as displayed at
West’s in Melbourne, marched to airs from “lo-
lanthe.” As the portentous personages with ostrich
fluff in their hair paraded past, we got:—
“Bow, bow, ye lower middle classes!
Bow, ye tradesmen, bow, ye masses!”
Presently came George and Mary, with small boys
carrying the tails of their extensive garments. Again
the orchestra was equal to the occasion. It took a
fresh breath, and let her go:—
“Spurn not the nobly born
With love affected,
Nor treat with virtuous scorn
The well connected.”
The prineelet had had his garter tied, and the
feather-headed brigade was returning. Once more
the appropriate dittv was forthcoming:—
“ ’Neath this blow,
Worse than stab of dagger,
Though we mo-
Mentarilv stagger,
In each heart
Proud are we innately—
Let’s depart,
Dignified and stately.”
A keen sense of humor is a magnificent thing in a
band.
‘C. Ockney”: Although “Snell” throws bricks at
me and bouquets at himself (B. 27/7/T1), he hesi-
tates to throw in the towel. All the same, I see it
coming. Sparring for wind, he gasps out a polite
request that I should explain still further. Would
“Snell” set any value on the explanation of an in-
dividual who suffers from brain-storms, and is cap-
able of evolving a “true bill” out of “the plenitude
of his misunderstanding” ? I doubt it —I shouldn’t!
“Snell” says he has seen dozens of Mikados —“all dif-
ferent.” I can only say it’s a good job Gilbert didn’t
hear about it!
“Vulcan”: Some recent very exhausting disserta-
tions on one Shakspeare remind me that Ibsen once
delivered himself on his commentator-cranks gener-
ally : “They are always trying to impute allegory or
symbolism to my writings, and seem to imagine that
1 imagined all the fool-things with which their own
minds are filled. One learned commentator even
likened one of my dramas to something the Apostle
Paul is supposed to have written. 1 never read Paul,
and don’t care about him, anyway.” I have an idea
(which I keep dark) that Shaksbacon’s greatness rests
not so much on what he thought as on his ability
to make the centuries’ “intellects” think he thought.
Another feather for the superstitious to
fly with. The Conversion Act Repeal Bill,
which was the rock upon which the N. S.
Wales Labor Government bumped, was No.
13 of the clauses in the Governor’s Speech.
Just sailed from Sydney the yacht Norma,
90 tons, to search for the lost Yongala and
the £lOOO reward offered by the Queensland
Government. The vessel is owned by Dr.
Cassidy, of Sydney, and has had a chequered
career. Built in 1880 by a New Yorker as
an ocean-going yacht, she saw wild times
before she came down to be a wrecker, em-
ployed in nosing round and picking up re-
mains of derelicts lying on various reeD
in the Pacific. The Yongala reward expires
on September 30.
The 49th anniversary of McDouall Stuart’s
feat in penetrating the continent, right to
the shores of the Indian Ocean, was cele-
brated in Adelaide on July 25. Next year
is to see a bigger-affair for the jubilee; but
every year counts with a batch of men at
that age. Stuart did not lose a man on his
journey, and was himself the first of his
party to die (in I 860). Since then, Ivek-
wick, Frew, Waterhouse and Thring have
gone; but Auld, King, Nash, McGorry and
Heath remain, all in Adelaide ;• Billiatt is in
London. The Geographical Society of S.A.
entertained and toasted them last week; a
bit of the dried meat used on the journey was
Through the unexpected death of “Tommy”
Taylor, M.H.R., at Christchurch last week.
M.L. politics loses the packet of crackers
that has been tied to their tail for 15 years.
In many respects he was a clever man, but
as a politician he leaves little in the way of
reputation except his ability to flay an op-
ponent with an unmerciful tongue, his
powerful driving of the water-cart, and the
thud of his fall over the Seddon “voucher.”
He was a sound democrat in principle, and
only lacked the balance that would have
made him leader of a big party. When old
warrior Seddon was pulled down by Death,
a lot of the fire went out of Taylor, although
now and then he burst into flame and
scorched the whiskers of Opposition-leader
Massey. He left at 49.
The alleged People’s Party of Victoria is
now roping in the bewildered children of
simple parents to form junior branches. The
dreadful practice was lately begun at Pres-
ton (Melb.), when several boys and girls of
tender years were organised into a militant
political body. It is not precisely known
what the youngsters are to do, though the
Age solemnly declares that they are to be-
come “a source of strength to the party in
Preston.” Possibly it will give some idea of
the intellectual status of “the party in Pres-
ton” when it goes to the perambulator for
help and support. But quite likely, when
the perambulator finds out the I O CJ’s and
the big landlords that the “Liberal” party
has burdened it with, it may give that party
a lift in an unexpected quarter.
Young Maoriland is leading the strenuous
life these times. The compulsory military
service officers are calling round for him
with great regularity to do a bit of drill;
the police are pursuing him into the hotels
and cross-examining him before the beaute-
ous bar-lady as to whether he is above the
age of consent, which is 21, as far as drinks
are concerned in M.L.; herds of wild can-
didates, ravening for the general elections
in November, lie in wait for him, and de-
mand proof that he is on the roll and a
guarantee that he will vote for the Right
Man to Save the Country; the Wowser is
tearing after him waving the water-cart
and urging him to strike out the top line:
the employer is nagging at him that he
doesn’t work as hard as he used to and not
nearly as hard as he ought to; and the M.L.
Worker is calling upon him to arise and
put himself on the roll of dishonor which
it has inaugurated to enshrine the name of
every lad “who goes to prison in protest
against conscription. . . So that, please God,
the present form of compulsory military
training will be knocked into Hades.'”
Meanwhile, the National Debt threatens to
topple over and break him.

THE COMIC JURISDICTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Smithers, S.M., urged Mr. Passmore to get on
with his examination of the witness. He did not
want jokes all the time.
Mr. Passmore: Your Worship lias been the worst
offender.
The Magistrate: In a case like this one can’t help
being witty. —Sydney Stiff.
An atmosphere of chronic wit
Would somehow seem to impregnate
My Court. I cannot banish it.
Despite myself I scintillate.
On to the Bench at ten I trip:
The constables, in snowy breeks,
Stand round like mutes. I make a quip.
Jley, presto! They are all in shrieks.
The drunk who hiccups in the dock
is wont to be supplied by me
With jokes as well as gaol. The lock
Is turned on him ’rfiid yells of glee.
No case is so imbued with hate,
And rage and malice and the rest,
But I will cheer it, soon or late.
With some well-timed and sprightly jest.
That humor is infectious, all
Who go to law are bound to know.
Let doubters pay my Court a call,
Atid they must own that this is so.
The plaintiff’s counsel turns from law
To epigram and .paradox;
Defendant’s man emits a saw,
■ At which the very courthouse rocks.
One member only of the crowd
Sits sullen, mum and dissonant,
His face disfigured by a cloud—
-1 mean, of course, the litigant.

The origin of paper bag cookery is lost in
the mists of time. Nick Soyer, late chef
at Brooks’s Club, London, grandson of the
famous Alexis, merely shows how it can be
more generally adapted. He was appren-
ticed to Papon, a French confectioner, who
encouraged his lads to think. Soyer’s
thinking turned to paper bags, and he prac-
tised with them while chef in the ducal
bouse of Newcastle, 15 years ago. But he
could not get rid of the taste of the bag.
nor could lie later on when he became chef
to Naylor-Leyland, in Hyde Park House.
So the matter was hung up till this year,
wjien a firm made him a special paper
that removed every objection. (P.S.—But
don’t try it for boiled cabbage.)
The M.L. red-flag Socialists and a few
other cranks, whose policy appears to be
that it is better to have their throats slit
lying down than to argue the point with
the enemy, have been sooling the youth of
the country into resisting the compulsory
defence regulations. So far they haven’t
done much harm, except to have a number
of lads dragged before the police court and
fined for failure to register. But if they have
their way they will induce further defiance,
and the next thing will be the irremovable
stain of the gaol. The other day a boy who
had refused to register was accompanied by
his father to the business premises of a
magistrate in Nelson. The parent an-
nounced that he had refused to allow his
son to register because the Lord’s com-
mands didn’t fit in with those of the M.L.
Government, and that, as he had to defy
one or the other, the Government’s would
have to go by the board. To which the
magistrate replied that he would give the
Scriptural gentleman a week to think it
over, and at the end of that time the maxi-
mum penalty would arrive. Unfortunately,
it is the boys who will suffer, and the magis-
trate made a good, workable suggestion when
he said that obstructing parents should be
made to toe the line. Already one young-
ster is in a Wellington prison for defying
the law, but that long-eared animal doesn't
appear to have thought of anything to say
to the demented barrackers for the millen-
nium who howled him into going there.

Years ago Dick Seddon told a Maoriland
election audience that • he would use the
prisoners of the State to plant forests. The
audience laughed, whereupon Richard of
Kumara banged his masterful fist on the
table with : “You may laugh, but I tell you
it shall be done.” To-day Maoriland has
7000 acres reclaimed and planted with com-
mercially profitable timber. That is but one
—and not the brightest—side of the ques-
tion. A brighter is that prisoners, instead
of being degraded by idleness or employment
in useless toil, are being built up physically
and mentally by out-of-door work, and have
a chance to gain self-respect by employment
in a useful occupation. So far, the “prison
camps” have given less trouble in super-
vision than (he walled and barred gaols of
Australian States, and there is no reason to
suspect that it will ever be otherwise.
“Pip”: The Bulletin’s
recent talk about forest
schools makes me won-
der again why city
schools do not abut on city
parks. I have been at the
school business all my life,
and always I have found
mean “play-grounds”
crowded with pale-faced
mites, hemmed in by smell-
ful back yards, though often
there was a beautiful
grassy park quarter of a
mile away. If the school
were part of the park, and
the park part of the school,
the children would be prac-
tically in the country;
“nature studies” would be
facilitated ; the elder pupils
could help to plant trees
and shrubs when necessary ;
and the vegetables thus set
going would be afterwards
looked upon as their “very
own,” with the result that
much of the present van-
dalism would disappear.
Many people never think
of the situation of the pub-
lic schools; others think
anything good enough for
the common herd, never
realising that if the com-
mon herd was allowed to
browse more freely in the
sweet open spaces, their
own ewe lambs would have
a better chance of escaping
infection.
There was a strange little strike in Ade-
laide the other day. The wine-and-spirit
firms’ men wanted a rise. That was not
strange, considering the pay they were get-
ting ; the extraordinary part was that the
Brewers’ Association sided against the
liquor-vendors, and told hotelkeepers that
there would be no beer for anyone who
patronised blackleg firms. The strike itself
was soon settled; Wilson, Minister of In-
dustry, got both sides to confer, and any
points that they could not agree on were left
to Judge Gordon, who is rapidly coming to be
accepted as the ideal man to put things of
this kind straight. Now the vendors of the
two kinds of liquor have got to settle their
differences, and the poor devil of a publican
-—who often is “tied” (which means fet-
tered) to both of them —hopes they will do
it quickly. The grievance seems to be that
the costly job of fighting the no-liquor party
has been left to the brewers alone, and they
urge that the work and the expense must be
shared by the sellers of hard-stuff also, since
the reduction of licenses hits them about
equally.
THE HIGHER MATHEMATICS.
CENSUS OFFICIAL: “And how many children have you?”

If you want to know which political
party to vote for at next election in N. S.
Wales, ask a policeman. Since the Labor
Government came into office some months
ago it has done more for John Hopkins than
the “Liberals” promised to do in as many
years. A few of them :
Reasonable clothing to keep the men from being
frozen while following on the trail of W. Sikes
during winter; £2O a year put on to the salaries
of superintendents (an encouragement to the men to
push on towards the top) ; extended leave after long
service; more reasonable expenses on transfer from
one district to another; the gateway to promotion
widened and the hinges oiled; and a system of
Sundays off introduced.
Now the Ministerial head might look in-
to the detective (criminaLinvestigation)
branch, and consider whether the pay and
other things offered are likely to attract
brains of the special quality needed for that
job. Also, it might find out what chance the
brains have of getting an appointment if
they are not accompanied by 13in. feet.

Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is not a common,
everv-dav cough mixture. It is a meritorious remedy
for all dangerous and troublesome complications re-
sulting from colds in the head, chest or lung3.*
A Sydney magistrate rose in wrath the
other day and fined a citizen 40s. or 34
days for insulting one of the lawyers en-
gaged in a case. The precedent is worth
following up. For instance, a lawyer not
engaged in a case might be fined 6s. Bd. or
six months for chipping in with an alleged
witticism —a thing that frequently hap-
pens. Or a police-prosecutor might be re-
lieved of a month’s pay and two stripes for
making a feeble joke at the expense of a
timid or confused witness. Or now and
then a chronically abusive and vulgar at-
torney might be sent along for a “Kathleen
Mavourneen” , for insulting a witness or
party in a case. Or, best of all, the magis-
trate might giye himself six months for play-
ing cornerman in his own court. The im-
position of a few such penalties might turn
even police courts into places to which de-
cent people could turn without dread in pur-
suit of justice.
“Locust”: Harking back to The
Bulletin’s reference to George Rex’s
invitation fo his perplexed people to
unite with him in solving their per-
plexities, and the instances given of
the horrors of the Londoners starving
. in cellars, absolutely ignored and neg-
lected, one cannot help contrasting this
callous anarchy and absolutely un-
christian carelessness of the purple to-
wards the poor of England with the
ordered system called the “Elberfeld”
in Germany. There each responsible
citizen—banker, merchant, mechanic —
takes his part in the organ-
isation which seeks out the
poor and needy and the un-
employed, and assists them
to food, shelter and employ-
ment. This private work
supplements the State insur-
ance measures of the Ger-
mans, and so arranges things
that there is no submerged
tenth in Germany. No won-
der Emperor Bill’s nation is
advancing by leaps and
bounds in commerce, popu-
lation, and general pros-
perity !
Victoria’s energetic police
force isn’t much of a success
fit capturing burglars and
bag-snatchers, but it can
shine sometimes. Lately it
brought up a man who had
been observed biting his own
arm, on the charge of “offen-
sive behavior,” and had him
fined £2. in default one
month. No reason was given
for the simpleton wanting to
consume himself, but as be
was in a Salv’army Home at
the time he was possibly a
little peckish.
“Justus” lodges a complaint:—
I have a brother under 30 years of age, who, as an
apprentice, served five years in sail. He has climbed
the ladder, and now holds a master’s certificate, with
exemptions for all Australian ports, and has been in
command of large deep-sea steamers. There is not a
blemish on his record. Some six weeks ago, full of
enthusiasm and patriotism, he made application for a
position as junior officer in the Navy, but up to the
time of writing he has had no reply. He heard out-
side, however, that they were taking Australians only
as cadets, and were bringing all the officers from some
place referred to as “Home.” It will be some years
before the cadets can complete their training. In
the meantime we have young Australians, who have
served their time and know the Australian coast
better than any Imperial Service man; and are they
to be driven away when making application ? The
authorities are very glad to get men. Why should
they not be as keen to secure able officers when op-
portunity presents itself?

Court Judge Higgins from the coward’s
shelter of the N.S.W. Assembly evoked a
reply that was mordant for all its dignity,
floundered badly in his alleged “reply.” He
said that he had not attacked Higgins in
anticipation of Higgins dealing with Arbi-
tration Court cases affecting pastoralists;
and then he wiped out the denial by say-
ing—
In referring to the Bill, it came into my mind
what a terrible position it would be for the farmers
and graziers of this country if a certain clause was
passed in the measure, and by a strange misfortune
a man such as Judge Higgins should be appointed
by any Government of this country.
After that, a very wandering Twaddle said
lie regarded Judge Higgins as “an honest
and upright man,” and then he said that the
same party had uttered “a vile slander.”
And, finally, when he was pulled up for
going beyond a personal explanation, and
was asked why he didn’t make the state-
ment outside Parliament, this cowering
patriot offered the specious excuse that he
might have to defend an action for libel,
and “the greater the truth the greater the
libel”—rwhicli is a lie, anyway, because
truth (if told for the public good) is a com-
plete answer to a charge of libel.
A strenuous clerical agitation is afoot in
.Melbourne against the reserving of all easy
and fat billets in the Anglican Church in
Victoria for fa tted parsons from abroad. The
Australian-bred parson begins to insist that
he should enjoy some of the loafs and fishes.
The E. and A. boat Eastern, which re-
ceived a bad knocking about on the Sala-
mander Bank, near Brisbane, at the begin-
ning of the year, and was afterwards re-
paired at Sydney, last week completed a
quick run of 24| days from Kobe, in
spite of having to tight a howling southerly
gale nearly all the way from Brisbane. The
Papanui, which tottered out of Melbourne to
get itself repaired in Japan, had at least two
stops for repairs on the subsequent voyage
from Melbourne to England. Thus the cheap
brown shipbuilder show's up just as badly as
the cheap brown anything-else when his work
is compared with that of the white man.
The latest star actor on the gallows at
Fremantle (W.A.) was supported from the
condemned cell to the drop by the execu-
tioner and a priest. With all due respect to
the gentlemen supporting him port and star-
board, this paper is reminded of the old
Italian saying: “ ‘This comes of keeping bad
company, quoth the' thief, ‘as he went to
the gallows between the hangman and a
monk.’ ”

some day. There is hardly a young city in
America so advantageously situated. It is
about half-way between Chicago and Mil-
waukee, on the shore of Lake Michigan,

a little bit of land.”
THE COMFORTER : “Rear up, bear up, my dear lady. Comfort yourself with the thought

The S. Aus. Attorney-General is advertis-
ing instructions to country J’s.P. regarding
legal procedure in certain cases. This ex-
pense might have been saved if Australia
had adopted the idea of John Walpole Wil-
lis, first resident Judge at Port Phillip, who
opening Melbourne Supreme Court in 1841,
intimated that he would insist upon the at-
tendance of all J s.P. a t future criminal
sittings so that they might learn something
about the business. The J’s.P. took no
notice, and Willis threatened to fine them
as., and have them struck off the rolls. This
according to the chronicle, “offended the
gentry/- who about two years later succeeded
in getting Willis the sack. The J.P has
been contributing to the humor of the
country ever since.
The Argus put “Un-Australian Con-
duct over the cabled item telling of Billy
Waites ungentlemanly action in biting a
horses ear at the “Wild Australian” show
in London. Since when has infamous con-
duct ceased to be “un-British”? If the
Argus goes on like this, the Imperial
Wowsers will be suspecting it of wanting
to cut the painter.
A TENDER SPOT.
MOLLY : “Doesn't Mrs. Newlywed speak to the
Rector?”
DOLLY : “Oh, dear , no! Yon see, Mr. Newly-
wed was married before, and she vows the
Rector looked straight at her when he gave
out his text last Sunday: ‘And the last
state of that man is worse than the first."
The other day the disruption of the Em-
pire was threatened because State Excel-
lency Carmichael proposed to wait a few
hours so that he might foregather with his
old pal and successor Fuller. Now it is
G.-G. Dudley who is imperilling the Con-
stitooshun by staying where he is for a few
days beyond the anticipated time, owing to
Captain Rome s illness. It seems that it is
highly improper, not to say immoral, for
one ornamental functionary to be in the
Commonwealth after his successor arrives,
inasmuch as the two gentlemen would bite
each other, or something. Or it may be
merely that the “authorities” fear that Aus-
tialia, having already as manv Governors
as it can stand, might burst Reloaded with
another. Meantime, the Commonwealth
might drop Precedent a hint to knock off
being an idiot. This severely practical
country has very grave doubts about the
usefulness of the whole frilly business that
surrounds Government House, and inci-
cients like tins are not calculated to remove
any its suspicions.
“Chasuble” : A Bul-
letin man writes
that Parson Adams,
of England, has just
invented a hat rack
to put under church
seats. Hold hard! I
saw hat racks in the
South Preston Metho-
dist Church, Mel-
bourne, 16 years ago.
A tablet outside that
church says it is a
tribute to “the skill,
enterprise and energy
of the Rev. Ralph
Brown.” This Brown
was rather celebrated
for a lecture called
“Heads and Faces, or
Round fhe World fol-
ds. 6d." He went
through America and
England on the phre-
nological racket, and
on his return he built
this South Preston
Church a frightful
white elephant,
though it did have
hat racks.

FAIRFAX 8 ROBERTS,
The Oldest Jewellery House in Sydney,
— lr 23 825 H jnt2f Street.
A BORIGIN-
ALITIES
“X-Eurner”: “Stickpicker” (B. 6/7/T1)
wants to know if the locally-named pine-adder, blue-
mouthed species, is venomous. I’m a scrub-clearer,
so come in contact with dozens of the reptiles daily.
The little animal is übiquitous over this planet, and
the types vary little. In Europe it is called “gecko”
—tease him and you’ll hear his miniature warwhoop:
“Geek-o!” Allied more or less to the newt, it is
in North America called the salamander, from the
mythical belief of the Indians that it could go
through fire unscathed. Those familiar with the
soft, cold, clammy properties of the lizard-like crea-
tures will readily understand how the idea
started. “Stickpicker” nn st have been bitten, as the
little beast’s only poison depot lies within its venom-
ous-looking blue mouth. The flimsy, cobweb-like
substance found adhering to his hand after handling
the lizard was part of the thin gossamer membrane
(very like that encasing a sheep’s kidney) which
covers the body, and in itself is innocuous. I know
of two cases of gecko-bites on the arm ; in both cases
being neglected, they culminated in the flesh around
the affected part having to be removed and the bones
scraped. It exudes no poison from the body, as
“Stickpicker” seems to imagine, and the ill effects
of the bite seem to be local. Brushed one off the
nape of my neck the other day, and was wondering,
in view of the two cases mentioned above, how I
would have fared had the same knifing process to be
gone through in that locality.
“Grand Slam”: Talking about the ob-
jection of certain birds to the touch of a human
hand upon their eggs, “Boswell” (B. 15/6/’ll)
omits the case of the emu. When she scents the
horrible smell of man upon her labors, Ma straight-
way demolishes the whole setting. Last week I
cautiously stalked a mob of 10 eggs, and having a
notion that they would be useful to the cook, I
humped as many as I could conveniently carry, in-
tending to bag the balance next day. But next day
v;as too late. Ma had been back in my absence, and
had completely broken up the happy home, smash-
ing all the furniture, and clearing out to pastures
new, in the hope of evading the defiling hand of
man.
“Eryander”: “E.11.P.” (B. 6/</ll)
makes his kangaroos outpace a train travelling 50
miles an hour. Now, first, no ’roo that ever hopped
could get away from the big Scottish deerhound.
Next, it doesn’t require a thoroughbred horse to
“cut down” the deerhound on a straight and level
track ; any moke with a tolerable turn of speed can
do it. Lastly, even the thoroughbred’s best pace
over a mile never exceeds IS yards a second. Yet
the 50-miles-an-hour speed of the ’roos aforesaid
means nearly 241 yards a second. Which all shows
that the Aboliar should beware of the Man with die
Mathematical Gun. I have seen much money change
hands over horse-and-deerhound matches. The horse
always won, because the confidence of the dog-
backers was founded on an optical illusion. The
smaller animal, when performing alone, always
seems to be getting over the ground faster than the
larger could possibly shift himself; but, when the
Iwo come together, the deerhound, though he gener-
ally gets a preliminary lead, is always collared
within the furlong, and well beaten over the, mile.
But neither horse nor dog nor ’roo is “in it” with
that speediest of all animals —for a sprint—the
cheetah. This flier has been timed, “from cart to
buck,” 18 seconds; and the afterwards-measured
distance was 216 yards, giving a velocity of 27
yards to the second, or at the rate of about 55-J miles
an hour.
“L. 8.” : “Montalex,” usually so very cor-
rect on natural-history matters, confuses (B.
13/7/’ll) the basking shark with the bone shark,
and speaks of them as one and the same creature.
They are entirely distinct. The basking shark,
common to the west coast of Ireland (especially
in the summer months), is a huge creature, but has
no baleen. The bone shark lives in tropic seas
only, has small baleen plates like those of the or-
dinary fin-back, and measures 50ft. or 60ft. It is
very pronounced in coloration—irregular black
patches on a yellow ground. There, are (or were up
to 1882) several baleen plates in the Custom house
at New Bedford (U.S.A.), extracted from the only
bone shark that was ever taken by a New London
whaleship. It was killed by a bomb in shallow
water off Mindanao.
“Rechab”: You might tell “K.P.,” in an-
swer to his question (B. 29/6/’ll), that I am a
sober Abo., who has seen a pure yellow snake. 1
was driving about two miles out of Port Pirie, when
the mare suddenly tried to climb into the waggon-
ette and throw her arms around my neck. At the
same time a big yellow snake made even going for
the scrub. Despite the fact that I called on him
to stand, he got clear away. He wouldn’t even
give his name, so all I know about him is that he
was about 7ft. long and as yellow as the 12th of
July.
THE LAS.2
STAGE.
HIS REVERENCE:
“Get up out o' that, Smith!"
PARISHIONER: “How (hie) can I get up? I
can't (hie) find, the blaniy ground?"
“Warradulla” : I enter the Darling River
’possum for “Jimmie Crow’s” Friendliest Bus'i
Animal Cup. He is the only beast in the running.
My swag and I camped one sultry night on the banks
of the Big Trickle some distance below Ivinchega
station. The spot was infested with the tree-clim-
bers. After boiling Billy, I had nearly finished my
meal, when I found myself being quizzed by four
ring-tailed ’possums, who sat on their haunches around
me. I threw them a few crusts of my latest sod.
which they ate without immediately fatal results.
Then I rolled in. At daylight 1 awoke with a pained
sense of being hanged. Starting up, I discovered a
burly ’possum with his tail looped round my throat.
The scene made my sleepy eyes bulge with incre-
dulity. The fire was blazing merrily, the billy boil-
ing, a ’possum was empyting tea into it, another was
sweetening it, a third was selecting a gum-stick,
with which he presently carried the billj' to me and
carefully deposited it at my feet. I chucked them a
bit more damper, and they scampered off after giving
three cheers and singing “Auld Lang Syne.”
A HEALTH TOUR.
FIRST SWAGGIE : “Goo day, mate — combinin' business
with pleasure , hey?"
SECOND SWAGGIE: "Now' I'm travel.'in fer me
health this trip."
“Brass Buttons'’: Why is it that in these
company-floating days some shindykit doesn’t get
out and round up the sharks that pervade these
waters? There is good money in the game, I be-
lieve, for there’s a whole lot of things that the car-
case can be used for. The liver produces good oil;
in some parts of the world the mainstay ,of the
shark-fishing industry is the cod-liver oil of com-
merce which the shark provides. Shark fins are im-
ported to this country for the use of epi-
curean Chows, and if that’s not carrying
coals to Newcastle I want to know. The
skins can be cured and worked up into
fancy ’baccy pouches, etc., and the teeth
sold to the curio shops for the tourist.
Finally the carcase turns into first-rate
fertiliser, though, I suppose,
if the business once got fairly
going the Dago fish-shops
wouldn’t let us waste good
“sehnapper” in that way. In
Iceland the fishermen have a
curious item in their shark-
catching operations. The boats
are rigged with a gallows-like
fixture, and when a shark is
hooked he is hauled up to
this. A noose is then slipped
over his tail and hauled taut;
then the patient is slit
and his liver extracted.
Before his hook is chopped
out of his jaw, his eyes
are poked out. They say
that if they don’t do this
the shark would come back
and take another bait, and
having no liver to give in
exchange he would be a
nuisance. Any ordinary
fish would have his appe-
t i t e spoiled b y the ex-
traction of his liver, etc.,
but I’ve seen enough of
sharks to believe pretty
nearly anything about
their persistence.

‘(ieofred” : If any
Aboliar, cove, bloke
or even gent, says an
owl can never be-
ome acclima-
tised to sun-
shine, I’m
his Moses.
Caught a n
old he - owl
recently, who
had lost his
way in the sun-
light. Before I
had had him a
month the old
“stop-out” had
completely re-
formed, and now
spends his days
philosophising in
the sunshine, and his nights dreaming in the dark
of the girls he left behind.
“Yub”: Was out rabbit shooting one re-
cent snowy morning, and on going to pick up the
game found a small robin redbreast snuggling down
on the quivering carcase. The bird explained that
it suffered from cold feet, and then flew off.
“Montales”: To “Chloe" (B. 33/7/T1).
Naturalists are like horses —“they run” (that is,
“naturalise”) “in all shapes.” Some of them, like
those “Chloe” was unlucky enough to strike, arc
certainly of the dry-as-dust order, but I have known
not a few who were wet-as-beer. In fact, the best
practical naturalist Australia has produced was wet-
as-anything-he-could-get. The naturalist proper does
not stop short at beetles and butterflies. His study
of Nature culminates in the study of Man, and, in-
cidentally, of the sex which “Chloe’s” pen-name
would appear to claim for her. Consequently, he
is generally a man of genial nature and social dis-
position, armed with so many knowledges that there
is no need for him to inflict his technology upon
those'to whom it would be but a weariness of spirit.
“Chloe’s” mummies were probably naturalists only,
and I have always paradoxically maintained that the
naturalist only is not a naturalist at all. The labels
“F.R.Z.S.” and “F.R.A.S.” —to which I plead guilty
—are not to be obtained by any mere smatterer in
science.; yet, if I should ever have the pleasure of
meeting“'Chloe,” she would find me just as ready as
herself to talk about “ships and shoes and sealing-wax
and cabbages and kings.”
* * * *
“Gip”: “0.L.” can tell those squatters
who argue that a fox has never been proved to have
killed a sheep, that it has been proved all right in
the Monaro (N.S.W.) district. Three of them were
seen to kill a healthy wether last week, and two
others were driven off a ewe, but not before her
tongue and ears were torn away. We’re laying
poison baits thickly, and getting results that \ve
couldn’t get a year ago when I asked for advice in
this page. Then we Were enclosing strychnine in
small squares of suet; and, although the baits were
taken, we never got the corpse. Now we are put-
ting the poison outside, toasting the bait on one
side so that the sudden death will adhere to the fat.
Got a bag of eight last week in one gully, within a
few yards of the baits, and three more a short dis-
tance away. But the brutes have grown wise to
made-up dishes in the locality, and if I want any
more six-shilling pelts I’ll have to try elsewhere,
and the recollection of a dying weaner makes me
want them very bad. In that case the blood was
trickling from an empty eye-socket, one ear was
eaten and probably the tongue—-I hadn’t the heart
to 100k —and a hole had been bitten in the poor
creature’s back. My skinning-knife was sharp, but
I hadn’t the pluck to end the little thing’s misery,
and there wasn’t a man within miles; but if I’d
got those foxes 1

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To be sung slow and sad-like, and rather wail-
somely; I di.nno the musical terms.
The night is done and overdone, and burnt a bit at
that;
It is the time when She puts out the milk jug and
the cat ;
It is the time when bad men rise, prepared to do a
crime—-
And this, in many a happy home, is Curtain Lecture
time.
An hour goes past (or we go past, it doesn’t matter
whi ch),
I know the time—the wife’s dear voice begins to get
its pitch ;
I burrow deeper, edgeways, as one in slumber deep ;
Her elbow digs my side: “Now, don’t pretend to be
asleep !”
1 doze. She turns away (thank God!). I wake
upon the rack ;
She is at rest, her icy feet are planted in my back !
It's no use wriggling off—they’ll warm, and that
will soon be right!
I settle down to listen to the Voices of the Night.
Another drowsy interlude, and I’m awake, and
wide . . .
1 thought she had begun again, but those were
sounds outside;
Strange voices as in anguish, but I know the voice
of him —
1 know it’s Dooly (Thomas cat) engaged in combat
grim.
I slip out, careful as a cat, and nip the blind aside,
And look into the broad moonlight, and there I note
with pride,
Upon the slippery wash-house roof, unbarracked for,
alone,
Beset by three great mangy Toms, our Dooly holds
his own!
lie was a hay-and-cornstore cat before he came to
me
(Or I stole him from his loneliness, and greed and
cruelty) ;
To live he had to catch the mice in hay-and-corn-
store days,
And when he’d nothing else to eat he’d whet his
teeth on maize.
To save a pint or two of grain (’twould make a stone
cat swear)
They’d shut him up from Saturday till Monday
mornjng there.
On holidays his claws he stropped on hay-and-corn-
store bags,
Until each bunch of schnapper-hooks could tear a
cat to rags.
The last strange Tom goes backward from the wash-
house roof with growls,
And strikes a loosened roost-end (whence complaint
of wakened fowls) ;
The dogs cease to congratulate, and peace is with
the night.
And Mrs. Dooly from/'a ledge sat looking on the
fight.
And I retire to rest once more, ere day be well
begun;
The council clock is striking four, which means it’s
just on one. . . .
I thought I heard the wheels of Time go hast’ning
to decay—
’Tis but twp men connected with a lantern and a
dray.
They take me back to boyhood scenes I ne’er may
see again—
The moonlight and the horse and dray and those
nocturnal men ;
The wash-dirt stealers that we caught (but these
be just and right) ;
The honest, jovial citizens; the Pilgrims of the
Night!

'Eddyson" : Collett is conspicuous in my
gallery of cranks. Collett’s weakness was an irre-
sistible disposition to go to law. He would sooner
go to law than to meals. It was a grievous misfor-
tune to be Henry Collett’s neighbor, since he had no
use for neighbors but as defendants. Liven was his
particular victim. AVhen Liven’s skewbald pony
shied at a traction-engine, and threw him on his
head into Collett’s bed of mignonette, Collett sued
him for trespass. Three times he sued Liven for acts
of misconduct on the part of Liven’s dog Oliver, and
then Liven got rid of the dog. But that made no
difference to Collett; he took Liven to court if his
rooster crowed or his hens came over the fence. In
sheer disgust Liven purchased another tyke, a liver-
colored animal with black patches. This was notor-
iously a stay-at-home terrier; but it had not been
behind Liven’s palings for a fortnight before Collett
was out with a charge of malicious assault against
Tige. He had the wound in his trousers to show.
In court he told a cirpumstantial story of being
dashed at in the darkness, and severely bitten in the
wearing apparel. He described the aggressor as a
liver-colored dog with black spots. He was positive
it was Liven’s dog. lie had often been threatened
by the same ferocious animal. He went in fear and
trembling because of its frantic demonstrations.
Liven denied that his dog was capable of such un-
becoming conduct. “Here’s me trowziz t’ prove it,”
veiled Collett, brandishing the fractured garment be-
fore the Bench. “And here’s my dog to prove it,”
said Liven. The dog was brought into court. He
was stuffed! (A’erdict for defendant, with costs.)
* * * #
“W. King”: Lodge a protest against
“Jimmie Crow” (B. 13/7/’ll) awarding the AVes-
tralian hoodie rat first prize as best hush cobber, and
nominate the bungarra. Once gain Bung’s confi-
dence, and he becomes a capital scavenger and
house-slave. Had one on the Murchison that regu-
larly cleaned the plates and pots after meals, and
could put a fine polish on the articles with its long,
narrow blue tongue. I have seen a cake of Monkey
Brand watch the process, and go green with envy.
AVhen not adding to the population of the blankets,
it would assist its former mate (an aboriginal shep-
herd) to muster and yard 1500 sheep, and after
wiping the sweat off itself, would climb on to a
rafter and watch me enjoying my pipe. But just
murmur ‘Rats!” and he would get as busy as a
AVowser who has scented a half-crown donation.
* * * *
“Wandewoi” : Dunno, but suppose it was
the same sort of beastie that “Stickpicker” (B.
0/7/T1) mentions. Anyhow, when picking black-
berries near Glen Innes .(N.S.AV.), I got bitten on
the thumb by what we called a “blue tongue” lizard.
The bite was very painful for some time, and about
a fortnight after the thumb-nail fell off. From
that I’m inclined to think the animal’s bite is some-
what venomous. Gan any Abo. liar tell me whether
the bite of the “rock-adder” —plenty of ’em to be
found on boulders near Stonehenge and aforesaid
Glen Innes—is likely to do anybody any good?
ONE OF THE PROLETARIAT.
COUSIN JACK MINER : “Mornin', Cap'en
William. I heeard thee'st gov zip bein'
cap'en?"
RETIREU MINE CAPTAIN : “Iss, Billy, in'
son; gov’ed up fer good. I'm only common
man now."
“C.0.D.”: Can anyone explain why the
common geranium plant scares inferno out of the
animal that Eve blamed? About Lake Cowal, the
champion snake centre of Australia, and Marsdens,
the cockies have discovered that geraniums in their
gardens and in pots on the verandahs keep snakes
at a respectable and appreciated distance. Is the
geranium any relation to St. Patrick ?
“Snooker”: Another for the bundle.
“Tommy,” a well-known South Coast (N.S.AV.) black,
hated nothing worse than work. Two local leg-
pullers, knowing this, set the ball rolling. After a
while one asked: “AVant a job, Tommy?” “No, boss,
I been got a job.” “AVhy, what job have you got,
Tommy?” asked the other. “I been stuffin’ two
pfeller jackasses!”
THE RESERVOIR.
NEWCHUM : “Can you sell me some milk?"
COCKY : " We ain't got none."
NEWCHUM: "Why, bless me soul, there's a whois cowfull standing there."
“The Moke”: If nominations have not
closed I want to enter my black colt Philip, of
Torrens Creek (Q.), for the Aboriginal Hilarity
Stakes. Philip had been bending too close to the fire
while cooking his evening gohanna, and his whiskers
caught alight and got singed. Next day, appearing
at the works with his facial decorations frayed at
the edges, he was asked by the boss what had hap-
pened. The nigger grinned as he replied: “Had
plurry pfellar bush fire last night, boss.”
* * * *
“Gip” : Climbing trees is not by any means
a new habit of the foxes. Have seen them shot from
high branches here (Monaro, N.S.AV.), mostly in the
spring. A friend of mine had quite a flirtation
with a tree-climbing fox yesterday. - She raced up a
tree, popped into a hollow and watched the pro-
eedings from the window; but as often as the gun
was brought to bear she coyly withdrew. “You
ain’t goin’ to play peep-bo with me all day,” said
the bushman indignantly, and bashed the tree so
suddenly with a log that the startled lady gathered
up her skirts and leaped for the open. The rest was
easy.
* * * *
“Gouger”: What comical beggars the
spotted brown bower birds are when they get a bit
tame! Two or three call at our camp every morn-
ing for any scraps or damper crust that may be
lying about, and in return they give us an enter-
tainment in mimicry, imitating the cat, the dog
and the hush birds perfectly. But one of them is
a real dandy. My mate has a chronic cough which
makes me anxious sometimes, and early the other
morning, when I heard him coughing and spitting
more distressingly than usual, I got out of the sunk
to see if I could do anything for him. To my sur-
prise when I laised the flap of the tent I couldn’t see
him, and I was going back quite mystified, when I
heard a whistle above me. It was one of the bowers.
He cocked his snaky neck sideways at me, and
coughed and spluttered tike a whole galvanic bat-
tery of asthma. I had nothing to offer him buf> a
handful of language, and I gave him the lot un-
grudgingly.
* * * *
“Wang”; In reply to a recent paragraph
of mine salting the cow-cocky for his bowelless
treatment of the young unfortunates that get into
his clutches, “Yalgun” says he “never met a State
kid who was worth his breakfast.” If he had put it
the other way abmt and said that he had never seen
a State kid with a breakfast good enough for him,
I’d have agreed with him. I’m talking first-hand
when I say that the alleged food some of those State
children are given would make a dingo toss up
whether to eat it or go hungry.
* * * *
“The Lyre”: vVhite ants in the Bunda-
noon (N.S.AV.) district have formed the tobacco
habit. I haven’t seen them smoking cigarettes to
any extent, but I know they favor the pipe, i had
the strongest pipe in the State, and it was not until
my friends forsook me, my children rose up in
anger, and my wife spoke openly of a judicial
separation that I decided to part from that pipe.
Then I buried it. A few weeks afterwards, I resur-
rected the old friend, and found it absoblankylutely
riddled by white ants.
“Windy”: Snakes can not only “charm”
birds; they can do the same thing to other snakes.
I have seen them at it. Have also seen a snake
charm a lizard in the manner described (8.29/6/’ll).
I know an old battler who swears that a snake can
charm a man; he was charmed himself for two
hours, he says. He doesn’t know whether the snake’s
intentions were strictly honorable or not. Still he
reckons the beast was a bit greedy, and wanted din-
ner enough for two navvies on one plate. Besides, it
wasn’t good whisky. As to the two parts of a snake
trying to join themselves, it’s a fairly common ex-
perience. I cut a snake’s hindquarters off one even-
ing, and buried them, and the next morning, when I
was passing, the snake was wriggling about looking
for its rump. I always bury the head now.
* * * *
“Feenix”: “Geofred” (B. 13/7/’ll) is
vrong when he puts the canary among the birds that
will burst up the happy home if a hand touches the
eggs. Have been breeding these birds for 15 years,
and always, during the season, take the seeds from
the nest as they are laid; when the third arrives
I replace the lot and allow the hen to sit. By doing
this you can generally make certain of your birds
hatching on the one day, and the youngsters, being
then all of equal strength, have the iame chance
in the handicap.
THAT TIRED FEELING.
MOTHER'S SARLING : "Don't you get tired of
doing nothing all day?"
SLOTHFUL SAMUEL: “Me lad, I get so tired
doin' nothin' that I can't do nothin' else."
“R. A. G”: Very glad “K. P.” (B.
29/6/’ll) saw that yellow snake, because it removes
a suspicion cast upon my otherwise untarnished
character by several people, when I mentioned an
interview I had with a similarly decorated reptile
while prospecting between Teesdale (Etheridge
line) and Oaks Rush (N.Q.). He was 3ft. 6in.,
bright yellow, and crawled over the rocks near where
I was boiling the billy. I offered him the shovel
with all the politeness I could put into my biceps,
but it didn’t reach him, and he disappeared in the
water of the creek. I presume, therefore, he be-
longs to the water tribe, and, failing the scientific
name, may be classed with AYowsers generally.
“Shangeye”: “Snakebite” (B. 15/6/T1)
says there are no rabbits in South Gippsland, and
while “Rabbit-trap” and others are after his gore I
want to sidle in with the whisper that there arc
none in North Gippsland. At Moondarra (now called
Harris, after the late Albert Harris, M.L.A.) rabbits
have never been seen, though hares are rather plenti-
ful. Ask any cocky the cause of bunny’s absence,
and he will say the hare. He seems to 'think the
hare is a cannibal. Personally I don’t go much on
this yarn, and would take it kindly if anybody in
Bunny’s confidence would supply me with a better
one.
* * * ♦
“Climax”: During the late autumn and
early winter in Central, Western, and S. Western
Queensland this year the übiquitous blowfly put tip
a good performance amongst the sheep. Although
it was not his first appearance, it was his most
strenuous, many stations having to take to crutching,
hitherto almost unknown. Amongst the many and
varied methods tried for his destruction was the
taking of half a bullock (lumpy or other worthless
beast), an empty oildrum, and some arsenic to a
sheep camp. The arsenic was boiled in water, and
hunks of meat dipped in the soup, and hung on trees
in the hope that the buzzy inhabitants of the neigh-
borhood would be poisoned to an insect. I wasn’t
able to see the scheme worked out, but I anticipated
that it would be merely a waste of good arsenic. Can
anybody with a first-hand knowledge enlighten me?
SOCIALISM DEFIED: A LEGEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Farmers and Settlers’ Conference, Mr. ,J.
Wetherspoon, M.L.C., referred to the encroach-
ments of unionism, as s’.iovvn in the claims of the
Rural Workers’ Union. The agitators who were fos-
tering this movement, he contended, aimed at in-
vading the sanctity of the home, and interfering be-
tween parents and children. There would he no
such invasion of Ins home, he assured his audience.
He had a gun, and his son had a gun, and he added
with some warmth, “We won’t be afraid to use them,
1 can tell you.” —Sydney Telegraph.
The Honorable James Smith-Brown,
The Anti-Labor M.L.C.,
Resided in a district where
Australia’s great cow-industry
Prevailed. He made vast stacks of coin,
And was as happy as could be.
Year in, year out, his progeny
Leapt from their beds before the sun,
And rounded up and bailed the cows,
And milked them deftly, one by one.
Brown’s youngsters drew no wage for this;
They did it, as it were, for fan.
The milking o’er, the yards were cleaned,
The house was swept, the beds were made;
Pigs, horses, fowls and such were fed,
And then Brown’s morning meal was laid.
His kids did all these little jobs,
And none of them, of course, was paid.
One rift there was within Brown’s lute:
His children labored with a will,
Both boys and girls were strong as mules,
They milked with wondrous speed and skill,
Excepting always one—Brown’s Cros3,
His sickly youngest offspring, Bill.
Bill hardly even earned his hoard,
So weak he was. His visage thin,
And frail, emaciated frame,
And hollow eyes and sallow skin
Moved Brown to rage. Bill’s uselessness
Brown looked on almost as a Sin.
Bill rose at four o’clock each morn
And sought the cow-hails with the rest;
He grubbed and dug and fenced by day
With all a grown-up worker’s zest;
But that he was incompetent,
It must, with sorrow, be confessed.
Eftsoon a Labor Government
Gained office, and a flood or mass
Of Socialistic Acts and things
Proceeded ruthlessly to pass —-
Which ill-considered actions stunned
The members of the Better Class.
And thus it came about, one day,
While Bob was chopping wood, and Lil
Was littering the pigs, and Maud
And Joe were ploughing on the hill,
A Laborite arrived and asked
About the health of little Bill.
His luck was out: Smith-Brown was in!
With yells of fury Brown reviled
Such wanton interference ’twixt
A parent and his lawful child.
The Labor emissary quailed
Before the ancient’s anger wild.
“Mv gun!” Smith-Brown howled finally;
“He’s brought it on his own rash head!
That gore would follow deeds like this,
I’ve often in the Council, said.”
So speaking, he took careful aim,
And shot the interloper dead.
Absurd though it may seem, Smith-Brown
Was forced for this to face a Court.
The Judge and jury—honest men—
However, cut the business short.
Brown pleaded “The Unwritten Law”:
His prosecution came to naught.
Bill perished shortly afterwards:
The steady overwork which kills,
Poor food, ill-cooked, and chronic dirt,
And lack of sleep, and constant chills,
Had all combined to saddle him
AVith half a hundred deadly ills.
Smith-Brown is still alive and well.
AA’herever “Lib’ral” banners wave
llis name is reverenced as one
AVho did his level best to save
A father’s sacred privilege
To sweat his offspring to the grave.

“I had colic and diarrhoea, and the pains were so

Spring Modes.
Slender lines prevail. There may be another half-
yard in the width of the skirt, but the Spring Show
in David Jones Ltd., which includes the newest
French models, is adamant on the subject of cir-
cumference. Race coats —those in black, with
splashes of emerald green in cuffs and revers, an a
black with rich cream applique, are special tempta-
tions —are exhibited in varied and original designs.
As worn at Longchamps, the draped effect is noticed
on the handsomest coats. Soft silks, flung in lus-
trous folds over show-stands, give David Jones s rooms
the fasc nation of an Eastern bazaar. Colors also are
go{ t_pastel tones of green, blue and pink are blended
together on the new chene silks. Designs are rather
large—coin spots, scrolls and squares. Lace ana em-
broidery—much of it wrought by hand—is used even
more freely this season on lingerie frocks. the
sleeveless little lace, muslin, or chiffon mantle—an
airy fairy garb of conspicuous charm —is another
feature of David Jones Ltd.’s alluring display of
feminine fashions. In millinery the Lancerfeather

A young Maorilander, w r ho can’t help his

The Comte Alphonse de Fleurieu, who is
a great-nephew of the French Minister of
Marine who sent out La Perouse and the
D’Entrecasteaux in the seventeen-nineties,
is touring Tasmania in search of informa-
tion with regard to early French explora-
tions on the coast. He wants the names
given by French explorers restored to their
“proper places” on Australian maps, and is
billed for a lecture on the subject before the
Royal Society.
George Jenkins’s “Reminiscences” were
one of the jokes of the Victorian Parlia-
ment. Several times a day the pompous old
fellow would breathe confidentially into
someone’s ear that he was soon going to
begin them. But, alas! the effort of dress-
ing and dining left S’George no time to put
his secrets into writing. It is even credible
that Victorian histox*y lost a little by this;
for George found many opportuixities of
meeting Australian politicians in moments
of indiscreet self-rex-elation.
ENDING THEIR SHIFT.
I What is the cause of so many railway accidents? The whole show is
“nervy,” and getting worse daily.— Vic. railway man.
BYSTANDER: “What! been another railway disaster?"
PORTHER : “Oh, no; only some of our staff knocking off work."
“Wild Wright,” whose exploits and
alleged exploits in the Kelly country are
supposed to have had something to do with
turning the youngsters’ thoughts to bush-
ranging, died the other week at Newcastle
Waters, on the Overland Telegraph Line.
Of late years he had been on the droving
tracks between the Territory and North
Queensland; and malaria beat him while
the old chap—quite harmless in latter days
—was travelling with Wave Hill cattle.
Manoel, the dispossessed Dago of Portu-
gal, is said to be spending a large portion of
the fortune he didn’t earn in an unheroic
endeavor to win back his precarious job as
caretaker of the throne. This Rings him
down to the levei of the exiled president of a
gunpowdery South American republic, who,
after squandering the country’s revenues on
a necklace for the prima-donna of a second-
rate opera co., exits on a rust-streaked
banana boat, and spends the rest of his life
intriguing in a New York boarding-house.
George Judah Cohen, chairman of half a
dozen of the biggest concerns in Sydney, has
just completed 50 years of commercial life.
He is the son of George Cohen, who, in the
first ’so’s, occupied a house in O’Connell-
street—a house which still stands, and was
long noted for the two splendid pines that
stood in front of it. “George Judah” —to
distinguish him from all the other Cohens —
was born on the Tank stream, near wiiere
the A.M.P. offices now are; he is head of a
firm which was established in Maitland three-
quarters of a century ago.
Harry Barnett, just dead in Perth, was a
popular sportsman in Adelaide for years, and
a prominent broker during the Broken Hill
boom. Hopelessly handicapped by Nature,
he yet kept his end up in various ways,
being notably brilliant at billiards, owner of
Quality and Jericho (an Adelaide Cup win-
ner), and on the committee of Tattersall’s.
In 1908, the Westralian Turf Club imported
him as a stipendiary steward, and at the
time of his death he was chairman.
E. H. Cameron, M.L.A. (Vic.), reached his
eightieth year on July 25. Having been a mem-
ber of the Assembly for 37 years, E. H. is
the father of the House; so members of both
Chambers met in a committee room on the
birthday and drank champagne enthusiasti-
cally. Many nice remarks were made about
Cameron, who is credited with having been
the prince of all whips. That was during
the regime of the Gillies Government. And,
strenuous fighter as he was, he never made
an enemy. There were several other octo-
genarians at the gathering, including
Davies, Balfour (author of the historic Dar-
ling grant), and Harwood, all M’s.L.C. Each
of these declared that he was still young,
and threatened to live to middle age.
Artist John Longstaff left Sydney early
this week for Melbourne, and thence starts
back to Europe in about a week’s time. Less
than two months ago he landed alongside
the Harbor with the idea of having a holi-
day ; since then he has painted four big por-
traits and two little ones —and one of the
four, that of Professor MacCallum, is just
about as good as anything he has ever done.
So the holiday has had to wait; there hasn’t
even been time for any play with brushes
and paint in the sunlight, and Longstaff
badly wanted to enjoy himself that way.
But he promises himself something better in
two or three years, when he hopes to be
back in the country where he admits he is
more stimulated to work than in any other
place in the world.
“Ben” Alley, who has been trading to the
Richmond River district (N.S.W.) for half
a century, has crossed the bar for the last
time. “Old Ben” knew every eddy and cur-
rent in the river, and, when he wouldn’t risk
the entrance, not another skipper would
look at it. On the northern rivers the coast-
ing skippers are the most important persons
going; on them depends communication with
the markets. And, when Ben Alley failed
them, the River folk knew that human effort
had done its best.
Wetherspoon, M.L.C., who told the
Farmers and Settlers’ Conference in Syd-
ney that he had a gun and his sons had
guns, and they would know what to do with
the weapons if the State started to “inter-
fere” with his farm-workmen’s hours and
pay, lives at Glencoe, near Glen Innes. Up
that way they think the results might be
much more dreadful if Wetherspoon recited
something from a volume of “verse” which
he once fired at a defenceless public—
“Warblings from the Bush.”
The once-notorious “Dan” Mayne died on
July 26 at Bathurst (N.S.W.), aged 85
years. He was a native of the Hawken-
bury, and one of triplets; his father was a
maker of nails, and Dan was apprenticed
to a shoemaker. After a trip with cattle to
Melbourne via Bourke, Dan settled at
Bathurst, commencing as a trainer of race-
horses for George Lee, M.L.C., and others,
and he had a few good ones of his own.
Later on, he started the Bathurst Sen-
tinel, and made it a very warm production.
On the staff in its early days were A. G.
Taylor, Richmond Thatcher, John Hunt
and others who became well known in after
life. Dan got into more libel actions than
any other newspaper proprietor of his time,
and he fought most of them with tooth and
claw. After leasing the Sentinel he re-
turned to Windsor, but went back to the old
battlefield to die.
From an old M.L. Gallery hand :
T. E. Taylor, M.H.R., who died last week, was a
great joy on many a long, dreary night in the Gal-
lery when Seddon was monarch of all he surveyed.
He could raise Cain at a minute’s notice, and —-
from 1902 to 1905, anyhow—-he mostly did it.
Those nights flash back now, with “Tommy’s” lean,
striking figure standing above a squirming House
and lacing every man who backed into the track of
his “few remarks.” He’s had them so infuriated
that they would flay one another; and whenever I
get down-hearted, I think of one grey dawn when
an aged and whiskered legislator staggered from the
lobbies with gore streaming from his nose into his
hands held scoopwise. Straight up to Seddon he
walked, and, “Look at me nose!” he wailed. “Bah,”
said old Dick; “take it away! ” I’m glad Taylor
died fighting. Not many days before the end, he, as
Mayor of Christchurch, presided over a meeting at
which Tory leader Massey was billed to speak, but
which terminated in a riot. The chairman of the
Deform League blamed Taylor for the trouble.
“What!” snarled Tommy. “If you were not an old
man I would not keep my hands off you.” If T. E.
Taylor accidentally drops into the place to which
so many people have consigned him, the head cook
will have to keep his spiked tail on a hair-trigger.
A rather remarkable man got on to an
outgoing boat last week—J. D. Williams.
Just under two years ago he arrived with a
heap of Yankee notions in his head and no
great weight in his pocket. He saw what
was going to happen in the picture-show
business, and he jumped in, carrying his
Yankee experience with him. First came
the Colonial Theatre Co. That had a capi-
tal of a thousand or two —and a good many
of the shares were taken by people who
were given work to do in getting the show
place ready. In plain words, they “took it
out” in shares. The J. D. Williams Co.
came next. That was a bit bigger. Then fol-
lowed the Greater J. D. Williams Co., to
absorb the rest; and this has a capital of
£150,000. Three picture theatres are run-
ning in Sydney now, and one in Melbourne:
and half a dozen more are in view in various
places. And besides the £150,000 co. (with
the shares at over 50 per cent, premium),
two or three other cos. have been whipped
up. It is a pretty fair record in hustle for a
man who dropped in, a perfect stranger, less
than two years ago.
Appendicitis is having another innings in
Sydney, among the sufferers being It. E. P.
Hickson, chairman of the Harbor Trust, and
lately chairman of the Decentralisation
Commission. The patriarch—he is the oldest
public servant in an important office in
N. S. Wales —is just on to 70.
Captain Edwin, for many years Maori-
land’s official weather prophet, has gone to
regions where the temperature is never
sultry. He was an old R.N. man with a
service record that included the Crimean.
China and Maori wars. Though he left the
Navy as far back as 1871, he was still only
71 at his death.
The Adelaide Bench isn’t very hilarious.
Chief Justice Way’s wit is bitter, but his
frank and frequent yawns and the way he
pushes the horsehair back in order to
scratch his head are redeeming features of
many a dull case. He laughs in office hours
more than any of the others, and likes to
“reminisce” on the Bench. In a recent pro-
longed assault case he appeared delighted to
recollect the matter of a clergyman whose
assailant simply waved a stick over his
head and said, “Consider yourself thrashed.”
The clergyman considered as he was told,
and the jury assessed his humiliation at
£2OO. Judge Gordon —who was “Jaunty
Johnny” when he was in politics—is as
dignified as a dromedary and doesn't make
jokes; neither does Judge Iloinburg (not.
intentionally, anyhow;. And Russell, of the
Insolvency Court, hasn't time to grin, much
less laugh.
“Scribe” gives two good ones a joint send-
off :
Two Melbourne pressmen have just gone—Jack
Nish and Jack Harding. Nish came from the peer-
less Bendigo fount. What is the printing ink ele-
ment in the Sandhurst air ? Nish’s father, Dr. Nish,
of St. Andrew’s, Clerk of the Victorian Presbyterian
Assembly, was unquestionably the best cleric for the
business of church finance ever produced or educed
by Australia. I have a vivid memory of the style
in which he twiddled the whole Assembly round his
little finger. Nish, the younger, was a slap-up, all-
round pressman. He might have produced a Ben-
digo Advertiser all by himself. I think he was
rather lost as an Argus sub-editor, though, undoubt-
edly he was efficient. I only recollect one mistake of
his, and Topp shared that. Both fell into a hole through
making a trifling correction in a rather awkward
correspondent, and there was the worry of an action.
Everybody agrees that another worry shortened
Nish’s life—his trusteeship in the Alf Joseph estate.
We all hoped that many years were before him in his
easier billet on the Herald, and truly he had re-
cuperated in a wonderful manner. J. T. T. Harding
was much less known. Many years ago he was on
the Age, and rapidly wrought up to a good position.
He turned newspaper man through Civil Service re-
ductions ; later on, offered his old billet again, he
went back. Yet this was a man, who, in my opinion,
knowing him well, might have workpd to the highest
place in journalism.
“LOST HIS PUNCH."
Three ex-Governors of Maoriland are on
a London committee which wants to erect
a statue in Wellington to Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, for his services in promoting emi-
gration to the South. Mr. Wakefield was a
gentleman who lived down a “past,” and be-
came prominent in schemes for land settle-
ments in S. Aus. and Maoriland.
AT THE CLUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The meeting decided to establish a Liberal club, to
unite the Liberal forces of the State, and to provide
a place of meeting for members of the party.— Perth
paper.
Club meets, and members gather. Enter first
Mister Mac Sweat and old Sir John Obese,
Both of the firm of Fat, Obese and Co.,
Mumbling and grumbling. “Folly!” cries Sir .John,
“This pampering of workmen ! Bless my soul,
Why can’t men live on seven bob a day?”
Whereto Mac Sweat bows low and mumbles back,
“You’re right, Sir John.” (Sir John’s the senior
partner.)
The fat knight drops into a seat, and cries,
“Steward! Where’s that damn steward? Bring me
whisky.”
Anon come others—members fat and lean;
Sour-faced and hungry-gutted; red and paunched;
Employers and employerdom, who rail
Quite in the old Emplo3'ers’ Union way:
“Class legislation! Confiscation! Faugh!
Where’s freedom? Jack’s his master’s master now!
It’s ignorance on horseback ! Where’ll they be
When Foreign Capital is scared away?
My boy, WE made this country ! Pioneers !
Ay, weren’t we pioneers ? Look at Sir John:
He pioneered a hundred thousand acres,
And got ’em for a song. Those were the days !
Steward ! Where’s that damn steward ? Bring more
whisky.”
Amid this chorus, note the “Bright Young Men”
Of Liberal instinct, fawning round the chairs;
Applauding here and sympathising there,
Which means —a gift of Influence from Mac Sweat,
A brief or two from Shark and Co., perhaps
A nomination into politics,
Or (for the doctors) by-and-bye a chance
To flesh a lance in Lady Blank’s appendix.
Butter your bread by being “Liberal” !
Meantime —confound that steward ! —have a whisky.
“More immigrants!” That’s Adipose’s voice,
Which promptly adds, “Sir John, have one with
me.”
Forthwith the talk is strong on immigration.
“Plenty of immigrash’n—thswash we want;
Then put these unions backsh their proper place/’
So says Fitzgrunt, who isn’t used to whisky,
Though very used to paying factory fines.
And while the steward dodges here and there,
You hear the grumble and the muttered roar,
‘ ‘lmmigrants—-wages—hamper enterpri se —
What’s Gov’ment doing?—agitators—bah !
All ruined —country sick —damned Socialism.”
With what deep unanimity will moan
The frenzied “Liberals” in the Liberal club !
westralta.

This good Australian gum-tree needs no paint. Its
general manager may be 79 ; and mostly when a man
is 79, he says, “Leave well enough alone!” But this
one isn’t content to stand still. Here is the remark-
able change in.the figures in 1.0 years: —
Liabilities.
June, June, Increase
1901. 1911. p.c.

Deposits.. .. .. 11,557,615 20,090,168 73‘9

Advances .. .. 9,771,028 12,48 a, 627 27’8
Premises, etc 426,900 6i2,1i3 20'0
The slignt shrinkage in the first line is due to the
introduction of Government notes to replace private
notes. Everywhere else there is growtn; and tne
biggest growth is where it is best. The accumula-
tion of liquid assets certainly has been on the big
side. This isn’t a complaint that has often to be
made: it is mostly the otner way about. The Com-
mercial of Sydney has, however, 54 p.c. of its total
liabilities held in liquid form ; and perfect safety can
scarcely demand that much. The management might
freely admit that. Ten years ago it held under 38
p.c., and no doubt considered its position then was
quite right. The trouble now is the lack of securities
that appeal to the management as being good enougfl.
It is unquestionably a serious thing mat one bank
should have 54 p.c. of all its deposits in cash and
other liquid forms —that is to say, not doing ordinary
banking business. And we ought to find out whit
is the matter.
This paper’s idea is that at least one-third of the
money ought to be busy helping to make for Aus-
tralia some of the tens of millions’ worth of goods
that are now made in foreign factories, with the aid
of foreign banks. Without those factories (which
we certainly shall not get without high Protection,
and assured high Protection) there is little employ-
ment for money, except in the nationally unprofitable
“industry” of land speculation. And even then, when
Jones and Brown and Smith buy stupid suburban
allotments, for which they have no use, from Robin-
son, Robinson as often as not drops the money back
into the bank; and the transaction hasn’t added one
farthing to the produced wealth of the country. Aus-
tralia is rolling in money; and it is letting it go to
waste, and this bank’s figures prove it. of
course, that this bank is making nothing out of any
of its liquid assets. It has, for instance, £1,010,375
on short call in London, and another £2,841,175 in
Consols and other Government securities. But it has
£.5,216,788 in actual coin and bullion, and there is
no direct return at all on that lot. With so large a
holding of liquid assets, very big profits in proportion
to capital and reserves are out of the question. Recent
figures have been: —
Dec., 1906 .. £6 7 3 p.c. June, 1909 .. £7 9 0 p.c.
June, 1907 .. 6 13 3 „ Dec., 1909 ..8 4 7,,
Dec., 1907 .. 6 14 7 ~ June, 1910 .. 8 2 11 ~
June, 1908 ..7 5 7,, Dec., 1910 .. 8 1 10 ~
Dec., 1908 .. 6 18 7 ~ June, 1911 .. 7 19 8 ~
Considering the size of the liquid assets £8 p.c. is a
very good return; it is pretty evident that assets
which yield that much don’t include many lame
ducks.
In the past 12 months more liberal advances cer-
tainly appear to have been made; but that has doubt-
less been partly due to the subdivision of country
estates, thanks to the graduated land tax. The exten-
sion of old-established businesses, following on an-
other good season, has also called for more accommo-
dation. Here are the figures, showing all the move-
ments in the past year:—
June,’lo. June,’ll.
Notes .. .. £568,935 £317,521 Dec. £251,414
Bills .. .. 823,609 1,053,478 Inc. 229,869
Deposits.. ..18,321,058 20,09<i,168 Inc. 1,769,110
Liquid assets .. 10,870,370 11,539,087 Inc. 668,717
Advances .. 11,354,238 12,485,627 Inc. 1,131,389
Premises, etc. .. 485,465 512,113 Inc. 26,648
The capital is £1,500,000, and the reserves have now
just shown their nose past that good, round, corpulent
figure. The liabilities exceed the capital and reserves
by slightly more than seven to one; and, though that
is usually reckoned just about as much as a bank
ought to risk, the hazard is much reduced in this
case by the very large holding of liquid assets.

The Australian Bank of Commerce (Sydney),
the Phoenix that rose from the ashes of the old A.J.S.
Bank:—
To Re- Re-
Profit. Dividends. serves, serves.
June, 1910.. £11,670 3 p.c. = £8,441 £3229 £3229
Dec., 1910.. 18,421 34,, ~ 18,103 318 3547
June, 1911.. 14,957 24,, ~ 14,550 407 3954
Six months ago The Bulletin printed the speech
which the chairman might have made if he had been
quite frank: “Gentlemen, you see we are paying you
34 p.c., and we know it is more than you ought to
get. We had only a wretched little £3229 of un-
divided profit at the end of the previous half-year;
and after you have cut up this 34 p.c. among you,
i. erc will be only £3lB to put in the stocking.” And
so on. Then another lot of directors and another
chairman arrived; and another view was taken of
the situation. The old directors, fighting then
for their lives (so far as sitting on this Board was
concerned), were naturally inclined to show share-
holders that they were doing very well for everybody.
The new Board was more inclined to say: “We arc
not responsible for anything that has happened
hitherto. Our job is to build up this bank. If we
can’t pay you a big dividend now, you know it is not
our fault. But you just wait and see what we’ll
send you by-and-bye.” So down the dividend comes
to 24 P-c., which, as the report adds, makes 3 p.c.
for the year. The one justification for the previous
34 p.c., which meant putting by a wretched £3lB to
the poor little reserves, was that the assets had been
written down so hard in the reconstruction that the
real reserves were possibly greater. The present
directors don’t say that there are not hidden reserves.
On the contrary, the chairman says: “The realisation
of the properties transferred to us bv the old bank
has proceeded very satisfactorily ... It will be satis-
factory to shareholders to know that, so far, the valu-
ations of the securities have been more than borne out
by the sales that have been made.” What has become
of the surplus is not disclosed. It may have been
passed to Profit and Loss: it will be better news to
learn later on that it has been transferred to a con-
tingency account, to make good any losses that may
be made on subsequent sales.
The paid capital is £1,180,812, and there are also
£1,730,197 of 4 p.c. inscribed deposits repayable
very gradually by a sort of sinking fund, “to be
created out of the profits, or corpus, or both, at the
rate of £15,000 half-yearly, or at the option of the
Board, on giving three months’ notice.” Half a crown
in the £ of the old deposits, carrying 3 p.c., is pay-
able in two years—that is to say, on January 1 next.
These special deposits total £416,812. All the old
paid capital was written off; and shareholders who
were liable for £2 10s. per old share, got £1 ss. in
hew shares. And, finally, 2s. 6d. in the £ of the
old deposits of the old (A.J.S.) Bank was written off.
In this way the assets were written down until they
were reduced to below present value, so far as that
value has been tested by actual sales. As one-quarter
of the old deposits was converted into share-capital
(and subsequently another small proportion), the share
capital is exceptionally large for the size of the busi-
ness at present. The liabilities, including the special
deposits previously mentioned, total £2,916,859.
The paid cap'tal and inscribed deposits together
amount to £2,911,009, so that there is more than£l
of what may be called shareholders’ capital for every
£1 of the public’s money; wherefore the security for
deposits and other debts is extraordinarily good. It
is, in fact, doubtful whether any other bank in Aus-
tralia could offer so good, and that is saying a lot.
Still, the bank’s biggest trouble is, no doubt, not to
get money, but to get customers for suitable ad-
vances. Sooner or later the A.B.C. should certainly
be able to command more custom. For, after all, it
is almost as important for a borrower to “do with”
a strong bank as it is for a depositor, because the
stronger the bank the less liable it is to have to call
on borrowers to reduce their liabilities at a time
when reduction is most difficult. It is satisfactory to
see that some progress is being made. This shows
the various changes in 12 months: —
1910. 1911.
Paid capital .. .. £958,172 £1,180,812
Inscribed deposits .. 1,859,022 1,730,197
Special deposits . . 429,317 416,812
All other debts . . 2,049,973 2,500,048
Liquid assets . . . . 1,185,979 1,417,934
Advances, etc. . . . 3,754,889 4,059,942
Premises .. . . 367,727 369,150
There are £ 305,053 more advances shown there; and
the new advances must have been greater than that,
because some of the old securities have been reduced
by sale. This is what the bank wants —more busi-
ness. It is at present a steam shovel ladling out
sugar in a grocer’s shop—a very good steam shovel,
capable of doing far more work and earning far
more money.

After the boom troubles of nearly 20 years ago this
bank detided to ’pull through without reconstructing.
It neither locked up any deposits, nor wrote oft' any
capital; it even went on paying first a 6 and then a
5 p.c. div. during the crisis. Unfortunately it was
only cracking hardy; and it would have been far
better had it admitted that it felt very poorly and
laid up for a while. Perhaps it didn’t suffer as
much as some; nevertheless, it was sick—very sick
indeed —and its books were chock-a-block with securi-
ties which were gradually thrown on its hands, at
.prices far above their real value. Instead of writing
these down out of capital (and reserves, of course),
the. bank struggled on, and still cracked hardy, even
when all the world could see that it was dodging the
undertaker with difficulty.
The wild-cat sickness was a good deal like the
dog disease from which Sydney has been suffering
lately: the banks that acknowledged they had it,
and went to bed, got through the trouble pretty
quickly, as a rule, while those —like the City—that
tried to keep going as though nothing was the matter
suffered five times as much in the long run. The
Commercial of Sydney went to bed, and it is just as
well and strong now as if it never had been ill: in
the past 10 years its deposits have increased from
£11,557,615 to £20,090,168, and its advances from
£9,771,028 to £12,485,627, while its profits have
just doubled. The City, on the other hand, has
increased its deposits only from £1,087,073 to
£1,637,602, and its advances from £1,202,085 to
£1,343,013. What actual increase there has been
in the profits it is impossible to say, because a great
deal of profit—perhaps most of it in some years—
has had to go towards wiping out the bad debts
which it had made but hadn’t acknowledged. In
other words, it had lost a large proportion of its
capital; but, instead of writing it off as lost, the
bank set about building it up again out of future
undisclosed profits. The trouble about that method
is that tue general public, seeing that something is
wrong, is apt to assume that things are worse than
they are. Then, rather than take risks, it passes on
to some other bank with its business.
Even now this paper hasn’t any idea as to the
real position of this bank. It unquestionably ought
to be in a vastly better way than it was, say, six
or eight years ago. If it had many of the old skele-
tons left in the cupboard, it couldn’t reasonably hope
for a better chance to get rid of them than it has had
lately. In fact, things that looked like skeletons a
few years ago have lately put on flesh and left the
premises with hardly a stain on their character. Fur-
ther, ordinary banking profits have been extraordi-
nary. All the same, the City’s visible profits are
only at the rate of £4 16s. p.c. on capital and re-
serves combined, or just 5 p.c. on capital alone.
That suggests that the bank has still got a quantity
of unproductive or overvalued assets on its books,
which is another way of saying that it still has some
lost capital to recover. Or it may be that the bank
is making more profit than it shows, but wants to
fortify itself against contingencies. In the absence
of information, the investor continues to quote the
£8 shares at from £6 to £6 55.; and that is 100
p.c. better than the quotation of a few years ago.
Though the City Bank has, through its own un-
fortunate action, to a great extent got out of the
swim, it has made a certain amount of visible pro-
gress in the 12 months: —

And, as hinted already, it has probably made a good
deal of progress that isn't visible. That is to say,
it has probably improved the, quality of every £1 of
advances and other assets on its books. Moreover,
though it isn’t fashionable, there is no reason what-
ever to doubt its soundness. It owes £l,-70,6,415,
and has £618,398 in liquid assets; so its non-
liquid assets only have to secure £1,088,017 of
debt; and the non-liquid assets amount to £1,516,852.
There may be a little over-valuation among them;
but they would only have to fetch £65 for every
£lOO of their book value to meet all claims. The
bank’s position from that point of view seems to be
really strong. Whether, having nursed itself back
to strength, it has the capacity to get. business and
make good profits has to be proved. Somehow a long
experience of the cheerless job of liquidation often
isn’t much of a training for the job of new-business
getting.

For many years the co. put aside large amounts, os-
tensibly to cover depreciation, but did not show
them as profit, nor were the accumulations shown
as reserves. Six months ago the Board evidently
smelt possible resumption by the State, and dfcided
that it might be better to make the figures l"Ok a
bit bigger. Internal reserves to the amount of
£79,410 were then disclosed, and called a fund to
provide for depreciation, public risk and contingen-
cies. This fund is now being visibly added to, and
the additions are shown in the foregoing as profit.
The total profit of £19,473 for the half-year is made
up as follows:
Added to fund for depreciation, etc. £3,916
Added to formal Reserve Fund.. .. 2,199
Added to P. and L. balance . . . . 13,358
Total .. .. .. ..£19,473
It-is impossible to say how much of that £3916 is
true profit. Depreciation is going on all the time,
of course ; and if it is not otherwise provided for, a
good deal of the £3916 is a set-off against the shrink-
age in value that comes with old age. But it is
highly probable—in fact, certain—that depreciation
is provided for otherwise; in other words, that ad-
ditions and renewals have been paid for out of re-
venue and charged to working expenses. Six months
ago ship property stood in the books at £168,630.
Since then, though the lvaludah has been lost, two
bigger boats have been launched ; and it seems cer-
tain that payments on that account have far ex-
ceeded £20,000. Yet the book-value stands now at
only £179,988. Six months ago the surplus of
liquid assets over liabilities was £43,850. To-day
it is £73,017, an increase of £29,167. Meantime,
£37,845 of new capital has been got in. The posi-
tion, therefore, is that the co. has out of the past
half-year’s profit paid £15,623 in dividends, and has
also made large payments on account of two new
ships, besides paying for landed properties, wharves,
etc., and all the new capital that has been drawn
upon to make those payments is £8678. Going
back over nine years we get these results: Excess of
liabilities over liquid assets, June, 1902, £14,974 ;
surplus of liquid assets, June, 1911, £73,017. The
cash position has thus improved to the extent of
£87,991. Meantime the following new capital has
been provided by the shareholders: 1902, £20,000;
1907, £40,000 ; 1910-11, £57,810 ; total, £117,810.
So the capital provided by the shareholders in nine
years has exceeded the amount by which the cash
position has improved by £117,810 minus £87,991
= £ 29,819. With that £29,819, supplemented, by
current profits, the co. has bought 10 new steamers
(in addition to the one or two lost), including the
Kanimbla, Koree, Kummulla, Kulgoa, Ivareela, Kai-
liai and Kirrule—in fact, practically all the bigger
ferries of the fleet. And it has also added at least
£75,000 to its landed properties, wharves, etc. Ex-
cept for £29,819, the whole of these new properties
and the 10 steamers have been paid for out of current
profits, Simultaneously with the payment of the co.’s
big dividends. There are not many gold mines like
that. As to the future —well, that’s not a matter
that one can tell anything about by dissecting the
accounts. It seems certain, however, that, no matter
which political party is in power, something in the
way of a new connection between the North and the
city sides of the harbor will come soon. But how
much that will cut into the profits of this co. nobody
can say. It is at least probable that better
facilities for crossing the harbor may so increase
the population of the North side that the ferry traffic
will go on growing. In whose hands that traffic will
be only a prophet can tell.

Besides the reserves mentioned in the foregoing, the
co* has: —
Premiums on shares .. .. . . £282,225
Meter replacement fund .?.■ .. 18,384
Total £300,609
Reserves are the value of a co.’s assets in excess of
capital and liabilities. But in this case one may
be permitted to disbelieve that the co. has only
£398,464 in excess of its capital ( £849,996) and
liabilities ( £509,712, including suspense accounts).
The truth, no doubt, is that the co. has been putting
very large sums into works, nominally as a set-off
against depreciation. Ten years ago the land,
buildings, machinery, pipes, etc., charged to capital
stood at £1,129,385. On June 30 of this year they
stood at £1,294,141. So, of - all the property
bought in the past 10 years, all the new machinery
put in, and all the mains laid, etc., only £164,756
worth has been bought and paid for out of capital
and visible profit; the balance has been bought and
paid for out of revenue which hasn’t been regarded
or treated as profit. And that is in addition, of
course, to whatever has been paid for renewals. This
paper doesn’t know how much the co. has spent on
new property, plant, mains, etc. But the amount
must have been very considerable, judging by the
fact that in the first half of 1901 the total revenue
from sales of gas, etc., was £171,402, whereas for
the past half-year it was £289,521. No doubt
some of the old plant, mains, etc., are bringing in
more revenue than they did 10 years ago, in spite of
the establishment and rapid extension of the City
Council’s electric-light business; but, given that in,
it isn’t too much to say that at least £450,000 must
have been spent in new plant and mains, etc., in the 10
years; and of that, as shown above, only £164,756
has been charged to capital account, leaving at least
£285,244 to be paid for out of revenue. Admit-
tedlv, those figures, so far as they relate to the
profit which has been put into works, are only a
guess; but this co. has been making as much pro-
gress as the Melbourne co. surely—Sydney, anyway,
has been growing much more rapidly than Melbourne
and the Melbourne co. has put £193,000 of re-
venue into works in the past five years. The Svdnev
co. meantime has been paying 15 p.c. divs. How
much more it could have paid if it had ventured to
distribute all its true profits, this writer doesn’t
know, and the shareholders are never likely to be
told either. It is enough for them to know that the
co. pays them 15 p.c., and has been doing so right
away back into the dark ages; and, though a poor
little reduction in the price of gas was made lately,
the co. is now, no doubt, better able to pay 15 p.c.
than ever it was, by reason of its vast accumulation
of secret reserves invested in revenue-producing
works. From the investor’s point of view, only two
things are worth considering: (1) What are the
prospects of the councils, or a Greater Sydney, tak-
ing over the whole business of supplying light and
power? (2) What are the prospects of electrical
light and power competing more keenly than at pre-
sent with gas? These are things to which, however,
you won’t get an answer from the published 'accounts,
even rummaged them for a month.

There is not much to be got out of this co.’s published
accounts. There is, in fact, not much to be got out
of the published accounts of almost any Gas Co. in
N. S. Wales. The law doesn’t compel them to publish
anything of much value, even to their shareholders;
and, with the municipalities hovering around, and
showing a disposition to swoop into the light-supply
business, the prosperous cos. naturally don’t make a
song about their prosperity, or give much definite
information that the public can lay hold of. In this
case, it will be seen, the 8 p.c. div. absorbs £7196/
while no less than £6340 goes to reserves. But .
whether any of that £6340 is a set-off against wear
and tear and decay, this paper doesn’t know. The';
chances are that depreciation is provided for other-;
wise. Anyway, the Profit and Loss account says:*
“Profit on sales of gas, etc., after allowing for de- 1
preciation and reserves, £7036,” and the additions to.
the visible reserve funds were £6500. From this itV
may be assumed that the co. is doing remarkably
well, though how well can only be guessed at in a
vague way. Its progress has certainly been most j
remarkable. A few comparisons:—
1901. 1911.
Paid capital ..‘ . . £106,250 £183,140
Liabilities . . . . 5,391 24,866
Fixed assets . . . . 106,816 241,615
Other assets .. .. 15,068 23,897
As previously remarked, it is not much use looking at
the profits, because one never knows how much has
been written off against depreciation; in other
words, put into plant extensions. So a calculation
based on the earnings of the co., in proportion to
book value of assets, is of practically no value; if it
were we might get some idea as to the extensions paid
for out of revenue. The liabilities look considerable,
but 30,000 new £1 shares were lately issued at par,
and 15s. per share is yet to be got in, and that will
wipe out most of the debt. The dividends have been
kept moderate —as Gas Cos.’ divs. go—and have
been pushed up very slowly, and there is no doubt .
whatever that thereby the co. has been putting itself i
into an extremely strong position.

This co. went through a very bad time, and had to
write down its £1 shares to 4s. 6d. and its 15s.
paid shares to 9d. ; and even then there was more
writing down to be done when a few years ago
some assets were realised. Recently, however, much
more energy and financial skill have been put into
the concern, and when during last year an issue of
50,000 shares was made at par, there was no diffi-
culty whatever about getting the money. Prospects
indeed were very bright until a beer war started in
Brisbane some months ago ; but since then the three
cos. in the fight seem to be quite content to chop at
one another. That this co. should have done so well in
the circumstances proves that it has got itself into
a very solid position, assuming, of course, that a
proper amount has been written off against depre-
ciation. The various items can be followed this
way:—

Land, plant, goodwill and properties stand at
£41,656; so the co. isn’t burdened with many hotel
premises, which in these days are mostly a sus-
picious item. The co., in fact, appears to have but
one property of the kind; and that is in a good city
position. When a trade war starts, of course no-
body knows who will go down; apart from that,
there is every reason for this co. to take a very
cheerful view of itself.

S. Australia has had so many good seasons that it is
beginning to assume that that is the only sort of
season made. It is possible, no doubt, that, owing
to improved farming methods, droughts will never be
quite so disastrous as they were in the past; but
such high prices are being paid for land that what
was a good harvest in the past will in some cases be
a poor one in the future. And, apart from harvests,
there is the matter of prices, over which the State
has practically no control whatever. This co. has
been in a rich patch of clover during the prosperous
years; and; besides putting its div. up from 7 to 11
p.c., it has added much strength to its financial posi-
tion. Out of the past five years’ profits it has spent
£13,212 on fixed assets (besides providing for de-
preciation), and has added £4806 to its surplus of
liquid assets. What depreciation has been provided
for it is, however, impossible to say, though there is
every reason to believe that the provision made is
liberal. The present surplus of liquid assets is
£8924. The capital is £76,570, in £5 shares fully
paid.

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair
than Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is
of the well-known Blake type, but has some ad-
ditional improvements which have justified in prac-
tice all the claims advanced by the patentee. 'The
work of crushing is done on the down-stroke of the
pitman instead of the up-stroke; there is no strain
on the pitman cap ; two large side rods 1 resist the
thrust of the toggles, and enable the jaws tc be
regulated within a large range; the back toggle is
so made as to resist all legitimate strains of crush-
ing, but will shear under exceptional conditions and
save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating; the jaws are convex and con-
cave, and with the cheek plates are made of steel
and are reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have installed a great
number of these machines, and hold the sole manu-
facturing rights for the' Commonwealth.* [3

The only announcement of any import-
ance made at the meeting of the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation in London, was that the directors had
been able to “arrange” for the £50,000 or £60,000
more of working capital needed. Asked who had
supplied it, the chairman said: “Those good friends
who had stood by them before. The directors had
no definite arrangement with those who had made
the advances as to how they were to be paid, but,
of course, the money advanced became a debt of
the co.” The co. already owed £550,000 on de-
bentures and debenture Stock.
An assay of 10.36 p.c. from the Queen
Bee (N.S.W.) winze, at 20ft. below the 570 ft. level,
caused some speculation on the off-chance that pay-
able ore will be struck in the 670 ft. level when the
south drive gets under the winze. The shallow levels
above 570 ft. don’t appear to give much encourage-
ment, the country being for the most part unsettled
and the makes of ore erratic. Still, backers go on
hoping that better prospects will be met with at
670 ft., although the crosscut is at present proving
rather low-grade stuff.

Kyloe (N.S.W.) has made another start
with its flotation plant; but at present prices the
prospects so far as profit-making is concerned are
not particularly bright. The last milling run was
361 tons, averaging 5.1 p.c., the recovery being a
shade under 74 p.c. of metal contents. Taking
copper at £5O per ton, the crudes averaged 51s.
per ton, and the extraction in concentrates was 375.
6d. per ton of ore. Kyloe, of course, only recovers
part of this value to pay mining and concentrating
costs —the balance goes in' freight and smelting
charges—and the profit (if any) must be very small.
Still, the shipments of concentrates and prill ore
have enabled Kyloe to put up a game struggle against
the metal market, and everyone will wish the show
good luck when it opens its level at 600 ft.
For the June quarter Vegetable Creek,
Emmaville (N.S.W.), produced 17 tons 19cwt. of
tin oxide. This sold for £2241, or at the rate of
over £124 per ton, which must be near the record
price for a period of 12 weeks. A square fathom
(36 sq. ft.) has given on the average £2l 10s.
worth of black tin. The proved area at the eastern
end, or up the lead, is approximately 520 ft. by 60ft.,
giving 31,200 sq. ft. of bottom. On this measure-
ment there are nearly 1000 sq. fathoms of washdirt
available, containing a gross value of approximately
.£20,000, or probably a trifle more. But though
£2241 has been produced in 12 weeks from develop-
ment drives, etc., expensive work has been in progress ;
the outlay on shaft sinking, driving and equipment
runs to nearly £4OOO for three months. The mine
has now a permanent main shaft 138 ft. deep, fitted
with steam winding-gear; and, generally speaking,
the mine will be worked under much better con-
ditions than before. Its handicap is that it still has
to pay a big slice of its profits to the freeholders,
not as tribute, but towards the purchase.

Mararoa’s days are apparently numbered.
The unfavorable change of country, which sealed the
doom of almost every other mine in the Norseman
district, has practically cut out the reef at the No. 7
level—equal to about 450 ft. vertical —and even the
mine authorities (who next to the, directors are
usually the last to give shareholders the tip) seem to
despair of getting any payable ore in deeper ground. It
is intended, however, to sink on the off-chance of find-
ing something new, and a few bore-holes are to be
drilled east and west of the present workings at No.
7 level, with the same object. Meantime there is
said to be enough gold in sight to pay somewhere
near the present market price in dividends. But as
The Bulletin has already said, dividends are only
dividends when they are in shareholders’ pockets.

The miracle of raising Westralia Mount
Morgans from the dead is about to be attempted by
its former boss (A. E. Morgans) and a local bank.
At one time this “show” was among the most pro-
lific gold producers in the West, but after yielding
bullion valued at over a million and a quarter ster-
ling, and paying £226,000 in dividends, some sort
of geological cataclysm occurred and put its light
out. Morgans and the bank are hopeful of turning
the present inky darkness into something approaching
brilliancy by means of deeper development, and pre-
parations are now being made to see if this can be
done.
* * * *
Great Fingall’s operations for 1910 pro-
duced a surplus of £33,417 ; and after deducting
depreciation ( £6459) and dividend taxes ( £5316),
a balance of £21,642 remained, which, with £2782
brought forward from 1909, made a total of £24,424.
Two dividends, absorbing £22,290, were paid, leav-
ing £2134 to be carried forward. The ore treated
during the year amounted to 140,982 tons, and
working expenses (including development) averaged
a shade over 21s. per ton. Plant expenditure
totalled £2733, the bulk of this representing the
purchase price of an automatic sampling mill, which
was got to enable the co. to buy ore from other
shows and carry on a custom business as a side-line.
Various job lots of obsolete machinery were disposed
of, reducing the net expenditure on the year’s con-
struction and equipment to £l5OO. No even approxi-
mate estimate of ore reserves is given by the manage-
ment, the excuse being that it is impossible at pre-
sent to estimate the quantity of broken ore in the
stopes or in the pillars or in the lower levels. Some-
thing, however, is said about the payable ore dis-
closed in the lower levels, which the management is
now “hastening to block out,” being of considerable
extent and value. The outstanding feature
of the year’s development is stated to be
the discovery of some really good ore in the vicinity
of No. 17 level, after ‘7ooft. of sinking had been
done on the reef, nearly all of it in low-grade stuff.
When the accounts were made up on December 31,
the book-value of the co.’s principal assets was as
follows: Property, £10,331; machinery, plant,
buildings, etc., £23,977; stores, £16,421; gqld in
transit, £3147; West African shares, £20,067;
debtors, £3244 ; cash in hand, £79,168. On the
game date there was £7169 due to sundry creditors
and a contingent liability of £18,481 for uncalled
capital on the West African interests.

“Tumbled In”: How is it that the eastern
and western dailies still allow themselves to be
“kidded” by the Bullfinch Co. ? Tons of ink and
stacks of paper have already been used in leading
the public astray concerning the value and possi-
bilities of this auriferous deceiver, and now it seems
as if a lot more is going to be used for the same
very bad purpose. The other day 7ft. of stone,
assaying an ounce, was cut in crumbling oxidised
country at 210 ft., and the following are a few of
the loaded remarks that have got into print about
the discovery: “Mr. Morgan, who is generally re-
garded as being extremely conservative, has reported
the stone to be worth an ounce; but the stutt now
coming from the face is worth more than that. .. .
“It is beautiful free milling quartz, shows gold
freely, and is very similar in appearance to Great
Fingall stone.” . . . “The development is spoken ot
in the highest terms, and, whereas the official report
gives the width as 7ft., a good judge is inclined to
think that good values will be obtained over a thick-
ness of 10ft.” . . . “The fact that the reef was tapped
nearly 200 ft. west of where the high values were
got in the prospecting workings, proves there is a
great length of payable stone awaiting development
at 210 ft.” No wonder the cry of Enough!
Enough! We’ve heard enough! ”is beginning to
elicit a responsive echo from the taken-in and taken-
down public. No wonder questions are being asked
in respect of the whereabouts of the “over half a
million worth of oxidised ore in sight.” And no
wonder most people’s belief in the permanency of
the mine is akin to their faith in the impregnability
of a house of cards.

Hans Irvine’s western district crowd is
poking after another fortune, this time in the Royal
Oaks, at Hancock's, near Black Range (W.A.). T.
A. Couper is still the mascotte; but, as luck would
have it, drift-ground cut at 150 ft. played the mis-
chief with the shaft. Seeing that the Faugh-a-
Ballah, next door, hit a 2-}o7„ reef at 134 ft. deep,
and only 15ft. from the Royal Oaks, Couper advises
the sinking of a new shaft to the north. As usual,
he gets what he wants, especially as the vendors are
sympathetic in respect to the time limit.
Westralia’s coaltown M.L.A., Wilson,
himself a “coalie,” has just opened up, with little

Great things are prophesied locally about
the low-grade deposit at Armstrong’s (Vic.), about
half-way between Stawell and Ararat, which has just
started a crushing plant. A new milling appliance is
expected to put the ordinary or garden variety of
stamp battery on the scrap-heap. The mill, the in-
vention of an old Stawell resident named Earle, is a
kind of Chilian mill, on the same lines as the Lane
mill which is well spoken of in America. It differs
from the old-time Chilian, once familiar on Austra-
lian fields, by being much larger, with several wheels
instead of two, and in having provision for loading
the wheels so as to obtain whatever crushing weight
is found most suitable for the ore. Locally, this mill
is expected to completely eclipse stamp batteries in
regard to power required, wear and tear, and output;
but, as the newcomer hasn’t had time to build up a
reputation for itself, stamp-mill supporters have sus-
pended judgment. The trial run, it is alleged, proved
that the machine, which is about 10 ft. diameter,
can reduce 2in. rock to fine sand at the rate of two
tons per hour. *lf this is correct, and other things are as
claimed, the proprietary of the Armstrong’s show
should be on a good wicket —provided, of course, the
stone contains enough gold to make it worth crushing
with anything. The directors anticipate that total
costs of mining, milling, etc., will not exceed 45.;
and it’s pretty poor stuff that won’t giVe that. They
talk locally about Bs.

Central Red, White and Blue is the most i
puffed-up show in Victoria just now, but people out- !
side Bendigo don’t forget the Catherine. .Reef fire- ;
works of four years back. Melbourne dailies outvie
Bendigo in big heads and in repeating the old story
that things look well at the north end, and that, with
the 400 ft. level opened up, the shoot will be picked
up on its pitch; also, that when a connection is
made between rise and winze, stopes will be taken
along. All this fills up space, but it doesn’t explain
away the hang-up over the div., nor does it . prove
that when the shoot dips into the 400 ft. level it will
be as rich as at 318 ft. This is not remarked sourly,
but as a gentle reminder that with any Bendigo
scrip at 955. thoroughly good goods are expected;
and there is bound to be a sharp reaction if any
weak spot turns up. Too much beating of the tom-
tom in such circumstances doesn’t frighten the bears
away; it rather attracts them.

Richard Ripper, who commands order at
the Christensen’s Ajax meetings, tells about this
Daylesford mine that they’ve driven east and driven
west at 490 ft., and, bar a flat leader that made into
the “vertical,” have found only water and a bill for
repairs. Where the leader hits the vertical the latter
reef bulges out to Bft., but does not prospect enough
to provide petty cash. There is always a hope in
such Daylesford shows, so rising is the programme.
The idea is to go out east and get into the run of
flat-make country, worked so profitably by the Nug-
gety and North Nuggety.
Long Tunnel Extended, Walhalla, has at
last come to the right way of thinking, but a few
white hairs arrived on Peter Finlayson’s head before
he would come up to the mark. Sam Barnes says
the old mine’s done at depth; so away goes the
Jacksonian legend that Cohen’s reef bent to the east.
But Barnes thinks there’s a chance to pick up a new
and independent lode that way. That’s what the
Long Tunnel and the Extended ought to have sought
long since. Then Cohen’s reef is to be driven on
north in search of a new shoot. Again good; but
why go so deep? If a hint can be given, it is to
find out where the lodes kiss one another. That’s
where the best gold was always got; and if needle
pyrites were seen to exist in the dyke, old Long
Tunnel traditions would be revived. Therefore, why
not spend a little cash at the surface as well as belt-
ing away at 1400 ft. and 1900 ft.? Calls are needed,
but with a decent fellow like Barnes to spend them,
there are worse specs, than trying to pick up the
Extended luck once again. #
Victorian Manganese Mines Iron and
Steel Co. is the latest suckling that intends to try
to fatten upon the hard diet of the iron industry.
Manganese mining has been tried with more or less
success in N.S.W., but only the haziest idea existed
that there was a deposit in Southern Gippsland to
exploit, until the news of the London float came to
be talked about. One J. Colquhoun Thomson, 8.E.,
is the St. John who is presenting the scheme in Lon-
don, and his conceptions are not unworthy of a
double-barrelled name. He is arranging a co. with
£750,000 nominal capital, and an issue of deben-
tures for £llO,OOO, the latter at 90, less 10 p.c.
commission. Shareholders in the Victorian “little-
go” of 120,000 shares are to get 170,000 paid-up
shares out of the London “big-go,” if the latter
comes off. Working capital is to be £350,000.
On that basis it looks as if J. Bull is to make 20
p.c. out of the debenture issue, and to bag 230,000
paids in the big float for finding £440,000. The
Bulletin won’t object to Bull doing well out of the
business. His money is to go to build up the Spiegel
steel industry, and as a bit of that stuff s wanted
for the skins of our ironclads, we don’t care much
who starts making it so long as it is made.
* * * *
Gippsland Copper and Platinum Co.
(Vic.) will issue a swag of new shares at ss. each.
The idea is to raise £10,000; but it is doubtful
whether that amount will pay for the extensive
scheme suggested. At the start the concern was
handicapped by excessively high costs for fluxes.
Then the consumption of coke was high, so one
way and another smelting of crude ore, with a
quantity of furnace slag containing fairly good
metal values, proved expensive. It is now admitted
that two furnaces are required, the second being
necessary to bring the matte up to a high enough
grade for shipment. -For the run, 970 tons of crude
ore were treated, together with a large quantity of
slag, and the product was 76 tons of matte, con-
taining from £3OOO to £6OOO worth of metals.
But matte containing copper, platinum, gold and
silver requires costly treatment, and although the
directors expect to get some more money when the
accounts are adjusted, they don’t seem pleased with
what they have heard so far.
*■* * *
Mount Lyell has three furnaces running
again, which is a quiet way of intimating that next
month’s output of metal will be up to the average.
The Chester mine is the best outside show
owned by Mount Lyell, and there is a growing idea
that its immense quantity of mixed schist rock and
pyritic ore will pay to concentrate. To put the
matter to the test, 2000 tons were sent to the Farrell
mill, and the result is said to be all right. The
Tasmanian West Coast, with its heavy rainfall, offers
some good opportunities for copper concentration.
But such propositions are often deceptive. Thus, 3
p.c. ore, with copper at £5O per ton, is worth only
305., and a 70 p.c. recovery at the mill gives 215.,
which isn’t much to pay costs of mining, milling
and subsequent smelting, unless the business is run
on big lines.
* * * *
At Charters Towers recent Day Dawn
crushings have been unusually good. Mills’ United
obtained £3661 from 1000 tons, New Brilliant Free-
hold £2333 from 817 tons, and East Mexican £3371
from 686 tons. A total of £9365 from these three
mines is a good yield for a fortnight. The East
Mexican has been extending No. 4 level in unsettled
country, so if - conditions improve to the east there
may be a make of good stone. The Mexican’s hang-
ing-wall reef is to be prospected for by putting a
rise up near the western boundary; not far on the
other side this reef is giving Mills’ United a good
innings.
The starting of the Oaks Rush battery in
N. Queensland was • delayed by a breakdown of the
electrical plant. There is rather lively talk of
amalgamating the Oaks Rush with the Acorn. The
crosscut goes right through from the O.R. shaft, the
auriferous formation being very wide, and the stone
belonging to the Acorn is being hauled up the Oaks
Rush shaft.
*** , *
North Queensland tin mines, favored by
high prices, are shaping better. Even the Gilmore
is coming along again, and may be congratulated
on having kept a good reserve in the till. The 74
tons recently sent to the mill—after a delay through
bad roads —should return a fine cheque. No. 2
stope in the Dolly Grey isn’t much good now, as the
ore is only Bin. wide; but the other section —the
Midas —looks better, and the directors intend to
open up this show again. The show is, however,
over-weighted with shares —a ridiculous 90,000 of
them. #
Yulcan (N.Q.) had £7OOO to the good at
the end of June, which encouraged the directors to
declare a penny dividend ( £1100). There is no
visible reason why the Vulcan should not pay Id.
per month for a while. The development at the
600 ft. level is good, but it is quite unknown how
fait the good things extend downwards, and a cross-
cut. at 720 ft., although in tin-bearing formation,
Hasn’t struck the richer ore-body yet. For June the
return from 880 tons was £4920, which includes a
parcel of seconds.
* * * *
In view of the railway extension, the
Hampden Co. has secured three likely-looking shows
a few miles from the Duchess. The highest price
(£5000) was paid for the Trekelano. The shaft
sunk in the ore-body disclosed what seems to be a
bulky and fairly high-grade proposition. As usual
in such cases, the assays are high, but very little is
known, about the show at present. The Trekelano is
only 10 miles south of the Duchess. To the north
two other shows have been acquired, the Ardath and
the Maseotte. The latter has a shaft down 103 ft.,
and has been opened north and south with encour-
aging results, but neither can yet be regarded as
more than promising prospecting ventures.
The Mungana (Q.) thinks it has secured
a better agreement with Chillagoe. That is good
news, for it has seemed absurd for the co. to send
away its high-grade ore, containing £5 worth of
cooper and silver, at such a small margin of profit.
For the 12 months, to March 31, the 22.489 tons
shipped contained 1530 tons copper and 350,0000 z.
silver, the gross value being over £llO,OOO, but the
net profit was only £14,700. The financial position
is now admitted to be £4OOO worse than it was on
March 31, and the co. has a lot of expense in front
of it. *
A new coal co. with a mere handful of
capital has been formed in Rockhampton, and is to
be known as the Mammoth Admiralty Co. The idea
is to acquire from the Bluff Co. three prospecting
areas situated on the Mackenzie River It was
from the mine there that a test lot of 100 tons was
sent to the Admiralty, which promptly asked for 200
tons more.
*****
The co. that owns Mount Whitty, Logan
(Q ), had an annual meeting the other day. The
report gives the assays as varying from 3dwt. to
2oz. 7dwt. per ton, though an 8-ton bulk sample
sent to Gympie returned only 4sdwt. per ton. ihe
directors, of course, do not consider this a fair re-
sult, as “a large quantity of gold had disappeared
in the concentrates.” Alas, it always does disappear
somewhere in such cases.

Christchurch (M.L.) has been pricking
its ears at news from the Galena reefs,
peka, in the Nelson district. An area of 460 acres
is held by the Blue Creek Co.—a small development
concern —whose chairman lately told the shareholders
that “if they were to put on 500 head of stamps
they could not crush all the stone on Blue Creek in
their time.” This is tall talk, which will of course
go for nothing till the tape has been put over the
proposition bv some mining man with a name to lose,
meantime, however, though nothing can be said about
quantity, there is no doubt about the exceeding rich-
ness of some of the silver samples brought in to
Christchurch.

Stanthorpe (QA is talking about radium.
A 2oz. specimen of pitch blende was sent from there
to England, and back comes the alleged news that
there is a heap of money in it. But the information
seems erratic, and at present only Stanthorpe is sure
that it is all right. The old tin village, with a Rip
Van Winkle sleep on it, could certainly do with a
lift. *
“Windlass”: Through a local paper the
Etheridge Railway and Mines Co. (Q.) has
been expressing its profound disgust at ( t e
ingratitude of the prospectors. It says. we
S put the Big Reef battery into thorough
repair making it. an up-to-date plant, solely
in the interest of the small mining man and
he has not the good sense to respond and keep the
battery going.” If the small man raises under 20
tons the co. charges him 15s. per ton for crushing;
if he has over 20 tons the job is done at 12s. 6d.
per ton onlv. Then, recognising .that the larger per-
centage of gold is too fine for the battery to save,
the co installed a cyanide plant. . Payment is made
for these sands on a tonnage basis, the ungratefu
small man is allowed for two-thirds of the quantity
treated bv the -battery. The stuff is assayed, and
one-third of the gold contents deducted ; then, after
charging the cost of treatment, the whole of the
balanced if there is any) is handed to the man who
mined the stone. And still the wretched fellows are
not satisfied! The more you do these laboring fel-
lows, the louder they cry, it seems..
One of the finest gems ever found at Sap-
phiretown (Q.) was unearthed the other day in the
Reward claim, which is noted for the large stones
it has disgorged. The new beauty is an orange-green
sapphire, weighing over an ounce,, and is valued at
£lOO in the rough. When cut and polished, it will

A
WOMEN’S
LETTER
Sydney, July 31, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —
Society is reported to be cheering up re
the Denman Excellencies, who have an ex-
hilarating reputation in the matter of free
food and drink.
Lady Poore has been mentioned as one of
the sponsors or spiiltual lady helps of the
infant Margaret Sydney, Governor Chelms-
ford’s new daughter. The Admii-al, by the
way, has been given command at the Nore.
A line from Suva drops in. The writer
coldly removes the halo from the native
Fijian’s woolly mop, and all on account of
a silvei’-mounted umbrella. My correspond-
ent affii-ms that when the Pah’f’l was in
Fijian waters, the Admirable attended a
local church. The congregation was all
native, and pursued the promise of a Better
World according to the Wesleyan faith.
Much touched by its devout attitude to
psalms and hymns, the Admirable asked
permission to address the prayerful native
in a short homily. When his Naval Ex. re-
turned to his pew, his silver-mounted um-
brella had disappeared. Presumably it had
been whisked away by a colored convert
who hated getting his mop of woolly thatch
wet more than he feared the Day of Judg-
ment.
The early Victorian parasol is threatening
to break into the coming season’s fashions.
The tent-like cii-cumference of last summer’s
hats threw the sunshade into disrepute. It
hung up by the handle in shop interiors, a
dowdy derelict for which the motor lady had
no further use. This spi-ing will see a timid
revival of parasols rather larger than well-
gi-own mushrooms, with a perky little frill
round their edges. The old-fashioned
handles that doubled up on hinges—some-
times when least expected—are probably
coming back with October roses.
Theatre caps are large enough to shut out
winter draughts from feminine scalps.
French flowers, twice as natural as life,
bloom finely on the more expensive lace
flaps that pull down towards the ears. A
rose perched on each ear is the effect of this
floral exuberance. A lighter lace frivol,
poised on top of the head, is another vagary
of theatre headgear; Miss Potts Point is
wearing just such a cap as Lavinia Fenton
pinned on her hair, when Hogarth painted
her portrait as “Polly Peachum” in the
“Beggar’s Opera.”
Artist Longstaff has strapped up his color-
box, folded down his blue painting kit, and
laid his silk hat to rest in tissue paper. It’s
said to have been the handsomest stove-pipe
that jaunted into the Union Club this
winter; and the Athenaeum is suspected of
serving up a sonnet to its curved brim.
Beau G. Bowen Siixxpson, whose shining
black tile hitherto reigned supreme in Club-
land, is too buoyant in tempex-ament to pine
in secret over the success of a departed
rival. Sydney’s loss will be London’s gain.
Australian artists abroad are getting
themselves into Cold Land papers so often
that they will soon have to be included
among our great natural resources; for, be-
sides producing pictures, they are helping
to break down Britain’s old idea that this
continent consists of a drought, a mining
camp, some wool sales and bushrangers, and
an army of globe-ti-otting politicians. Vic-
torian Hilda Rix, who has been exhibiting
her work in the Paris Salon and other foreign
places, gets a sugar-plum notice for her pic-
ture, “The Return from the Hunt.” It is
said to be “typical of Miss Rix’s strength of
draughtsmanship and freshness of colbr.”
The Royal Society’s Rooms, dedicated to
the gnawing of historic bones, plunged into
fried fish last week. The occasion was a
demonstration in paper-bag cookei*y by Mrs.
Glennen, of the Melbourne Domestic Train-
ing College. Learned men who had served
their country and cultivated mutton-chop
whiskers in spare moments, peered out of
picture frames at the desecration of their
sacred forum. The paper bag, by the way,
after cremation in the stove, emerges in
crisp brown flakes. Mrs. Glennen’s “wash-
up” was a bucketful of paper shavings. It
was received with acclamation by a room-
ful of women who absorbed the “no sauce-
pans to scrape” item with gleeful chuckles.
An orange souffle, popped into a paper
bag in its glass dish, was a hair-raising ex-
periment ; but it came out a perfect picture,
with no glass fragments to give it a foreign
flavor. Tomatoes —a recklessly extravagant
twopence each —blushed pale red, and hugged
their juice in their skins. A mere fowl
stuck its trussed legs into its paper coffin
and turned a tender brown. Mrs. Greig
Smith and Miss Russell helped to push this
demonstration into its place.
An Anti-Salt League is now trying to
kick the domestic salt cellar off the table.
The mere housewife, side-stepping the boiled
egg in the paper "bag, had barely recovered
from her surprise that the water doesn’t
filter through the bag, when she was face to
face with this other px-oblem. Will she take
the risk of being driven to drink by a dab of
salt in her cooked yolk, or will she take the
egg neat, and lose even her accustomed thirst
for morning tea?
Muswellbrook, after joyfully snatching the
Dudley Polo Cup for 12 inonths, has had to
put on the garb of woe. A tragic motor
accident which cost Mrs. Barrington her
life, and thus robbed the “Liberals” of a lead-
ing light, besides plunging two other fami-
lies into mourning, was preceded by a death
toll that bei - eaved Df. and Mrs. Mills
(Strathfield). Their bright little daughter
Jean, a charming child of 14, was spending
her holidays on the Whites’ station in Mus-
wellbrook parts, when a bolting pony threw
her against a tree with immediately fatal
results.
In “The Lyons Mail” H. B. Irving swal-
lows nightly about three quarts of liquid
that might be rum, bui'gundy or tinted Pro-
spect Reservoir. As the good Lesux-ques he
has a preliminary meal and liquid nourish-
ment. As the bad Dubose he has to regxx-
larly empty bottles into the good Lesui’ques’s
food chest. The terrific strain of two gx;eat
impersonations is added to the physical
achievement of sopping up fluid like a
thirsty sponge. When Irving, as the worthy
Lesurques, has had his head saved from the
sawdust, and pants aci'oss the footlights
(final curtain) in the bosom of his family,
he looks as wan as if he'd escaped from the
under-side of a steam-roller.
Miss Irene Browne, the pretty Julie in
“The Lyons Mail,” insinuates her way into
the friendly feelings of the audience with a
graceful trick of girlish mannei’s, and one of
the loveliest wigs—pale ale colored, with an
alluring curl trickling down her neck —that
has l'ecently touched the finer emotions of
the front stalls. She wears, besides, a soft
brocade gown with a foam of blue-green
scarf, in the 1797 period, hitched across her
shoulder-blades, and firmly clipped to its
moorings near a white patch of bare neck.
This froth of drapery, which clung to the
female form through Jane Austen's novels,
must have taken the heroine’s attention off
her troubles, for it needs a special training
to keep it in its proper place. Irene
managed her chiffon with considerable pre-
sence of mind, and sobbed on Irving’s coat
lapels without getting the tails of her scarf
tangled up with her tears.
MISS CARRIE LANCELEY, a Sydney
soprano, back after doing things in London.
Constance Craven, better, known in Syd-
ney as Miss Connie Simpson, recounts her
fortunes on the other side, on inflammable red
paper, with a “C” like a half-moon hung in
one corner. Constance says she is not quar-
relling with her luck, which wears a silver
lining on. treasury day. She writes from the
Lyric Theatre: “ I’ve been engaged by Mr.
Whitney to be principal understudy to Con-
stance Drever in ‘The Chocolate Soldier,’
and I am also to play the part of Nadina at
matinCes. Constance Drever, by the way, is
magnificent as Nadina.” With only one
year’s stage experience behind her, Con-
stance (a former pupil of Slapoffski) seems
to have forced her Greek cameo profile into
a position where it’s likely to be noticed. She
throws a posy at Alice Crawford’s work in
Shakspearian parts at “the Coi-onet,” and
approaches Alice Hollander’s successes in
song on bended nib. ‘ ’
Tliea Proctor’s decorative designs, notably
for fans, make bright patches of color on
the walls of the, Women-Painters’ Club
room. Mr. Hardy-Wilson lends one of
Thea’s earlier fan decorations; it is in softer
tones than her later work, which shows
more detail. “Fashions —1910,” with the
blue Directoire gown in the foreground and
fountains splashing in the perspective, is
ear-marked “sold.” It has the same French
atmosphere as the Hardy-Wilson fan, or the
handsome piece of color lent by Dr. Black-
burn. Cold-Land critics hail Australian
Thea as the successor of Conder, with the
same sense of color and better drawing.
The ballet dancer’s muscle, in color and in
pencil sketch, is evidently a favorite leg-
study of this artist, who gives to “a dancer
resting” the calves of Julius Knight and
the consistently large feet which, outside
fiction, are the stock-in-trade of ladies who
earn their living on their toes.
Cyril Monk believes he is stage-managing
an idea new to Sydney for the Austral String-
Quartet concerts. The instrumental items
may be delivered by a Celestial choir so far
as the audience can swear to the contrary.
Lights will be turned down, and the per-
formers, disguised in thin air. will be invis-
ible to the naked eye. Mr. Monk says the
human mind can only take in one impression
at a time. My Suva correspondent hints
that it can escape with a wedge of sermon
and a good-looking umbrella.
Miss Carrie Lanceley, of this city, who
took her soprano voice to Fogland four years
ago had to undergo 197 welcome-home hand-
shakes at the Australia one afternoon last
week. She admits she came back to see her
people and her country, get a little Austra-
lian atmosphere into her wind-instrument,
and sniff gum leaves as part of a rest cure.
Carrie has a bright and virile temperament,
which probably accounts for her numerous
engagements on the other side. She says:
“Beautiful women and girls with fine voices
are often practically fighting the lean and
hungry wolf of despair in England, simply
because they never get a hearing. They
can’t afford to pay agents huge fees —I’ve
never paid a guinea, by the way —and they
haven’t had my. luck. I call it sheer luck,
with the help of Australian notices copied
into the London papers.”
Carrie, in search of light for the phrasing
and reading of oratorio —her special musical
microbe —went to Santley, who eventually
sent her on to be coached by Alfred Har-
riss, who wears a second “s” to liis name, but
is unrelated to Charles of the Sheffield
voices. She is merely poising her wing in
Australia, and hurries back to London and
her concert engagements in September.
Lieut. Richard Hirst, R.N., of the gun-
boat Encounter, is engaged to Miss Kite,
who hails from New England, in this State.
This joyous happening was celebrated with
clinking glasses by Mr. Hirst’s brother-offi-
cers in the Encounter wardroom the other
day.
Miss Mattie Roth, eldest daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. Roth, of this town, has given her
promise to Lieut. Van Ilieustreik, of the
Dutch army. He’s stationed in Java, and
comes to Australia to buy horses. Inciden-
tally, he has acquired a Nice Girl.
Miss Ivussmann, who snared the Guild
Hall gold medal for her fine fiddling, was
formei-ly a pupil of Sydney’s delightful old
Kretschmann, who needs two persons to hold
him down, and a third to sit on his head,
when one of his ex-infant phenomena gets
talked about in London.
Miss Violet Alcock, who lent a hand in
mixed farming on Miss Brace’s‘alluvial patch
near Glen Innes, is returning to the Cold
Land this week at the call of urgent private
business. Miss Alcock was formerly sub-
editor of the Girls’ Realm Magazine, and
secretary of the London Lyceum Club, and
cultivated a few hundred other devices for
keeping out of mischief from the mature age
of 18. Jangling nerves sent her to Australia
for a rest-cure. Here, Violet has learned to
chop wood —nice green wood, with a soft
sinew—chase fowls out of flower beds, in-
quire into the identity of nest eggs, paper
homestead walls, hate rabbits, and love billy
tea. She was in the act of giving her con-
sent to the land tax when the overseas cable
dragged her away.
Mrs. Robert Brough, who revived old
memories as “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray”
in Melbourne the other day, got a surprise
present after the performance from the.Ham-
ilton-Plimmer-Denniston management. It
was a gold watch-bangle of much solid worth,
and the lady murmured her thanks through a
lump in her throat.
Mrs. Dalton, who died recently after com-
pleting a health-hunting trip to Japan, was
widow of Tom Dalton, M.L.C., of the big
commercial firm of Dalton Brothers, of Syd-
ney and Orange. She was a Miss Long, a
sister of Father Long, for many years parish
priest at Orange.
Rose Scott remarks, re the suggested me-
morial to Catherine Helen Spence, S’Aus-
tralia’s grand old woman: “Miss Spence be-
longed to every State, because she devoted
her life to the Service of Humanity—especi-
ally neglected children —in Australia.” Sena-
tor Walker, the National Council of Women,
and others have already parted with some
spare cash to push forward the N.S.W. end
of the Catherine Helen Spence memorial in
Adelaide.
The engagement of a Maoriland girl, Miss
Gladys Jardine, of Napier, to Captain
Anthony Rassam, now of the local staff
corps, Wellington, and formerly, of a Bri-
tish Border, Regiment, gives an excuse to
dig into the Rassam family’s archives. An-
thony’s parent, Hormund Rassam, put in
two dull years in chains—a mark of per-
sonal esteem which Theodore of Abyssinia
(1864) reserved for Special British Envoys
and other foreign cattle that strayed into
his compound.
At Premier, Asquith’s dinner to the
King and Queen, on the day after the
Coronation, Australia’s old friend, Miss
Lillah McCarthy, was the after-dinner
attraction. With her husband, Gran-
ville Barker, she put up Shaw’s “Man
of Destiny,” as well as Barrie’s new playlet,
showing how any wife having as much as
£l2 in ready money is liable to find her hus-
band an insufferable bore.
Australia's old friend, the dancing Earl of
Yarmouth, eldest son or the Marquis of Hert-
ford, has been declared bankrupt. His lia-
bilities are £12,000, mostly owing to money-
lenders, and his assets £3l2 —mostly ties and
socks, no doubt.
A recently-returned Australian song-bird
drops in a note of warning to others of the
same feather who may be meditating a
scamper to Britain. “’Ware agents!” is her
cry. “They’ll ask from one hundred guineas
upwards for giving the Australian voice a
hearing at the Queen’s Hall, a much smaller
building than our Sydney Town Hall.” The
Australian warbler in London who has a
sprinkle of gold in her cash-box should de-
posit it in a burglar-proof safe and lose the
key before she interviews the brand of agent
wno wants to sub-lease her voice for one
evening at a,minimum charge of £lOO.
The autograph fiend broke loose, the other
day, when the H. B. Irvings were fed and
stroked by members of the Women’s Club,
with Mr. Henry Gullett in charge of the
Shaksperian quotations.
A change from the eternal matrimonial ad-
vertisement (S.M.H., 11/7/T1) :
WTD., refined middle-aged Woman adopt refined,
well-educated bus. young Lady. Reality, Herald.
But why should a refined and educated Lady
ask so much of a mere Woman?
Concerning the recent ice spree at Kosci-
usko, Plain William, who was there, says
there was a frequent freeze in the Hostel
drawing-room. Percy* Hunter used to jump
with both feet on the ugly little serpent of
snobbery when it reared its baleful head.
“His absence this year,” snaps Plain Wil-
liam, “left a gap. Snob circles at Kosciusko
drew a chilly line between wholesale and re-
tail trade, and lTdeg. of frost smote various
alleged social gatherings.”
The men who write agitated letters to the
editors of daily papers, on the point of the
hatpin, its sharpness, and stabbing habits,
can now cheer up. A new female sun helmet
has been created. It fits well down on the
head, and has a wide lean-to verandah at the
back, which covers the neck. This helmet
needs no hatpin. It was designed for Cor-
onation crowds in the Thames village, but.
if it were invited, it would attend a mothers’
meeting in St. Andrew’s Chapter House, or
a pony race at Kensington.
On Saturday afternoon Lieut.-Governor
Cullen’s wife declared that the New Settle-
ment Home, in Newtown —an appendix to
the University Women’s Society—was well
and truly open. At the Girls’ Exhibition in
May, University women showed a sand-heap,
a few tables, and some small children, who
vigorously attacked the sand-heap. One
juvenile outlaw, filling his pockets with sand
for the joy of hurling it out again—a cycle
of ecstasy he pursued till his trousers split
at the sides—would have had a heated in-
terview with an angry parent if he’d broken
up his wardrobe in this fashion on the do-
mestic doorstep. The University Women’s
Settlement encourages the child to play un-
der its learned eye; so he plays with
cheerful abandon, and occasional damage to
his home-made breeches. The New Settle-
ment Home is an adult scheme with two
tails. It aims at “promoting a neighborly
feeling amongst women,” etc., and will also
incite ’Varsity students to sit up and ask
questions on social problems.
Bessie Major, writing to a Sydney friend,
says she believes “Kismet,” with the Asche-
Brayton team in charge, would have gone on
till the reappearance of Halley’s comet, if
the Asche return to Australia hadn’t been
booked for next Easter. Miss Major, who is
the Nurse in “Kismet,” chats briskly of
Coronating capers. She saw the second day’s
procession, and says it was a more gorgeous
pageant than the first, though the Royalties
had disposed of their mediaeval millinery,
and stepped off their Coronating perch into
the 20th century. Bessie took a room near
the theatre during the Coronating crisis, to
avoid climbing barricades, Venetian masts
and other signs of public joy that came be-
tween her and London S.W.
When this reaches you, the Admiralty lady
will be giving her blessing to a charity enter-
tainment in North Sydney’s State school-
room. The object is to scrape together suffi-
cient cash to present free kindergarten
youngsters—now boiled down into State
school kindergarten classes —with extras not
included in the Public Instruction syllabus.
Mrs. Hay, of the Berry Estate family, is
president of the committee.
Advt. from the S. M. Herald:—
Young English Lady, nice appearance, wishes
corresp. with gent, or squatter, 26 to 36, view early
matrimony. No P.O. address. H.M., P. 0., ——.
Gent, or squatter! Possibly the young Eng-
glish lady of nice appearance has heard a
squatter speak his mind about the land tax.
After that, of course, there wasn’t a hope
for him except in the Bullocky Bill class.
The committee of the Sydney Home for
Babies is going in pursuit of hard cash with
a wattle dance in September. St. James's
Hall will be the place.
The Medical Congress entertainment com-
mittee is settling down to solid food-and-
drink discussions. About 800 visitors from
other States are going to mingle light re-
freshment and medical science at the Pill
and Powder party in this city in September.
Yours, with a broad nib,

FOREWORD
TO MY
AUSTRALIAN
FRIENDS.
NOW after spending some very pleasant weeks in your
interesting country, I feel sure that this book will
find many sympathetic readers in Australia. Quite
naturally it will be discussed ; some, doubtless will cen-
sure it—and unjustly ; others will believe with me that
the tale teaches a great moral lesson.
Born as the Boy was born, the end which Fate forced
upon him, to me, was inevitable. Each word and act
of the three weeks of his parents’ love-idyll must reflect in
the character and life of the child. Little by little the
baby King grew before my mental vision until I saw at
last there was no escape from his importunity, and I
allowed the insistent Boy—masterful even from his
tion —to shape himself at his own sweet will. Thus he
became the hero of my study.
This is not a book for children or fools —but for men
and women who can grasp the underlying principle of
morality which has been uppermost in my mind as I wrote.
Those who can see beyond the outburst of passion—the
overmastering belief in the power of love to justify all
things, which the Boy inherited so naturally' from his
Queen mother —will understand the forces against which
the young Prince must needs fight a losing battle. The
transgression was unavoidable to one whose very concep-
tion was beyond the law —the punishment was equally
inevitable.
In fairness to this book of mine—and to me—the great
moral lesson I have endeavoured to teach must be con-
sidered in its entirety, and no single episode be construed
as the book’s sole aim. The verdict on my two years’
work rests with you, dear Reader, but at least you may
be sure that I have only tried to show that those who sow
the wind shall reap the whirlwind.

FASHIONABLE WORLD CONDEMNS
FAT.
The close-fitting gown having come to stay,
fatness is de trop— that is to say, “not in it.”
Fat ladies are socially as well as physically
at a disadvantage.
There is one loophole of escape, however,
for the over-fat lady. Let her get a bottle of
Marmola Prescription Tablets, and take one
tablet after each meal and at bedtime, and
very soon she will be wearing the new modes
with comfort and grace.
These bottles of- Marmola Prescription
Tablets, which, by the way, being made
strictly in accordance with the famous Mar-
mola Prescription, are perfectly harmless,
contain such a generous quantity of tablets
that they last a long time and are found to
be most economical, costing, as they do, only
3s 6d They are also a very pleasant
method to adopt, for they render dieting and
exercising entirely unnecessary. They are
sold by all chemists, or post free on receipt
of price by the Marmola Co., 7 Barrack-
street, Sydney, N.S.W.
7 VOTE. For those who prefer the liquid
o reparation, chemists are still dispensing
the famous prescription as follows: One
ounce of fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P..
one ounce of pure Glycerine 8.P., one halj-
Znce of Marmola, and mix with pepper-
mint water to make six ounces m all. The
dose is two teaspoonfuls after each meal.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 31, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The new G.-G. sprang ashore on Monday
amid a flutter of flags and a blare of bands.
The weather was behaving nicely, and the
daily press has recorded the fact that St.
Ivilda, where the landing took place, "looked
almost beautiful.” I suppose some hoarding
is responsible for that "almost.” Paradise
itself would only win qualified praise if the
Pale Pellets for Puce Prudes man pasted an
advertisement on Peter’s Gate. After being
held up at three points by mayors who had
addresses of welcome to get rid of, the new
G.-G. and party at last arrived at Federal
Government House, where silver-trimmed
postillions and footmen in purple livery, and
a carriage piled with golden wattle-blossom,
made a striking color riot at the foot of
the numerous stone steps.
His Ex. is smaller even that G.-G. North-
cote ; but the tall aides and Major Quilter,
his towering military secretary, bring up
the average. Lady Denman is slight and
fair and well-groomed. For her first ap-
pearance she wore a coat of chinchilla,
which almost hid her lilac silk frock. As
she climbed the steps, the bystanders noted a
pair of trim ankles beneath a smartly-cut
short skirt. Her hat was big and brown.
Lady Barttelot and Miss Quirk followed the
first division, with Chamberlain Victor Hood.
The pair were in black; but one of them
smiled beneath a violet velvet hat. What
with the feminine frippery and the war mil-
linery of the staff, the front of the talking
emporium looked like a flower garden broken
loose. A rainbow would have retired in a
huff from that competition.
Indoors the Very Best People, who had
waited patiently for a solid hour, had the
satisfaction of witnessing the clanking, rust-
ling entry and the brief 10-minute swearing
ceremony. That over, Colonel Stanley showed
the newcomer the guard of honor and saluted
him off the premises. The Very Best People
tumbled hurriedly down the steps into their
waiting motors and buzzed away; and every
taxi in Melbourne panted up in its turn and
carried off the unmotored remainder in twos
and fours. It was all over. The country
was saved again.
Major Quilter, G.-G. Denman’s military
secretary, who arrived a week in advance of
his chief, is a good-looker, standing 6ft. 4in.
in his striped socks. His regiment is the
Grenadier Guards, and when he gets his
boots and his bearskin hat on he should be
noticeable in the largest crowd. Captain Sir
Walter Barttelot, A.D.C., belongs to the
Coldstreams. Another aide, Captain Stew-
art-Richardson, of the Seaforth Highlanders,
is, I believe, a brother of Sir Edward Stew-
art-Richardson, who was on the staff of a
former Bananaland Governor. The third
gentleman help is Captain Nutting, of the
17th Lapcers. These four military men,
with Private Secretary Ronald Vernon and
Chamberlain Victor Hood, comprise the staff
which will shortly be available for large and
small functions. Prompt attention given to
all orders.
The Denmans are bringing their own maids
and Jeameses to this benighted country. A
round dozen arrived in advance; the balance
are to invade the continent later on. The
Denman children, accompanied by nurses,
maids and governesses, are travelling hither
on a different boat to that which brought
mamma and papa.
The Riverina squatter MacMicking is re-
lated in a distant-cousinly way to Denman,

Sub-Governor Fuller is experimenting with
the healthful outdoor sleeping fad. He has
not, however, dragged his own Excellent bed
on to the balcony, but is getting an aide to
try it first. There is a species of canvas
house, much in use along the ti-tree beaches,
which would be charming enough even for
the garden of Stonington. If the experiment
is a success, the “standing room only” sign
at State Government House may be taken
down when Spring has definitely arrived.
Artist Bunny had Toorak crowding round
his paintings on the opening day of his
show. Enthusiastic art lovers got glimpses
of the canvases between the latest weep-
ing plumes. A fashionable hat now-a-minute
fits like a pixie’s cap; but the projecting
willow branch or water-jet swishes and jabs
at the eye of the reluctant follower. The
crowds ascending the stairs to the upper
room of the Athenaeum found Mrs. Bunny
with sister-in-law Mrs. Donald Mackinnon
waiting to receive them. Mrs. Mackinnon
was in powder-blue, while Mrs. Bunny
tailored in purple velvet. Governor Fuller
motored along with Aide Awdry; Lady
Fuller was in Geelong for the day. (Per-
haps the pair have agreed to halve the social
round wherever possible, and in that way
seize more hours to play with the babies.)
The departed Carmichael was particularly
good at art-show speeches. This was Ful-
ler’s first show, and he disappointed the ex-
pectant mob by making no introductory re-
marks. An explanatory murmur of “It’s
not done in London now, y’ know,” ran
round the room, and the picture-gazing be-
gan without delay. Although his Ex. dis-
tributed no opinions or theories about paint-
ing, he caused the red spot to appear before
many eyes, and the infection spread steadily,
notwithstanding that a search through the
catalogue discovered that 20 guineas was
law-water mark.
Concerning the Bunny pictures themselves
a hardened critic sends this note: —
Rupert Bunny’s array of paintings at the upper
Athenaeum Hall is disappointing in the monotony of
its effect. The prevailing note of the 103 pictures
is sameness —same two or three girls grouped, same
general gaudiness of drapery and environment, a
superfluity of balcony, an irritating first impression
of oleographs rather than original work. Many of the
figures pall upon the eye. partly because of their
family resemblance, but chiefly because tne heads and
faces are too impressionistic to arouse human in-
terest. The picture too often ends at the point where
the hard labor of artistic craftsmanship should begin.
Of course there are striking successes here and there,
even in the impressionist style, and among the land
and seascapes, as well as among the many that have
Woman for the principal theme. In these the leading
lady is mostly Mrs. Bunny, who certainly does credit
to the artist’s selection of a model. But in the midst
of so much of a mediocre muchness, one loses en-
thusiasm for the finest pieces. Where one expected
to admire everything, only the best examples of
Bunny art seem truly good. And one has the same
old feeling that the art'st, in putting high prices on
his largest pictures, is too apt to take the will for
the deed.

At the City Newsboys’ Ball, chief pat-
roness Lady Fuller hung brown broideries
of ninon over gold net, and perched a glit-
tersome tiara in her golden hair. Auntie
Phipps, the vital spark of the vice-regal
circle, frivolled in a fancy set as a magpie
with-a black velvet dress, powdered hair and
a stuffed bird on her shoulder. Admiral
Creswell’s wife wore grey and a committee
badge. Mrs. Guy Sherwood, who expends
much time and money on the boys, brought
two of the youngsters along to present lilies
of the valley to her Ex. She was daintily
clad in lilac and old lace. When the com-
mittee was settled securely on the dais, the
fancy sets squared up for the Lancers. Mrs.
Emmerton managed a Wattle group, most
of them recent brides, with daughter Mabel
(Mrs. Norman Brookes) in the lead. Mrs.
Stuart-Murray (Frankie Oliver) was an
ornament to this set, with gold leaves in her
hair. , Dorothy De Grut had a White Aus-
tralia set. Many of her young chums are
not back from the Coronation crush; but
she had some dainty girls in the quartet.
They wore wide hats, which were rather
cumbersome in the crowded state of the
floor, and had a tendency to get mixed up
with the rosella parrots the wearers carried
among their gum-leaf staffs. Mrs. Hodges
had the Newsboys’ set, made up of dignified
personages in black velvet who carried daily
papers folded over their shoulders. The
University crowd provided a vivid contrast.
The men were in their black gowns, the girls
in scarlet.
After the first dance, there was a parade
round the room. It proved rather a terrible
business. Two by two, like Noah’s shipload,
the performers processed towards the salut-
ing base; but although the Fullers bowed
and beamed like twin searchlights, they
only got an occasional bow in acknowledg-
ment. Alfred Deakin’s tall daughter, who is
on the committee, walked arm-in-arm with
dad, and looked a graceful circumstance in
a long-trained white dress.
The Coronation returned-empties are being
worried to death by the stay-at-homes, who
will keep on asking where they saw the pan-
tomime from. The invariable answer seems
to be “The Abbey, of course.” If I hear of
another half-dozen saying it, I’ll begin to
think the old place is made of rubber.
A note from the Coronating “Rosna” :
The circus part of the Coronation couldn’t give
many points in the matter of organisation to the
Suffragette procession that spread itself over six
miles of London the week before. The popular
fallacy that the British Suffragettes rush about
smashing windows and policemen for exercise, or
just for pure cussedness, must have staggered after
seeing that show, when 40,000 women walked
through London in a great, orderly, unhysterical
throng. Even the haughty British press, usually
silent or abusive or flippant on the Suffrage topic,
came down off its high steed, and threw bouquets at
“the best-managed procession ever seen in London.”
As a spectacle it was equally successful. The Com-
monwealth and Maoriland, being enlightened, were
headed by a triumphal car; in its wake walked the
Chief Justice Stout dame (M.L.), Mrs. Andrew
Fisher, Mrs. McGowen, the wife of ex-Agent-General
Cockburn (S.A.), Vida Goldstein, Mrs. Bowman
(Q.), and sundry other good Australians. All sorts
of British notabilities took part. The Writers’
League sent Sarah Grand, Elizabeth Robins, Mrs.
Bernard Shaw, Flora Annie Steel, and a crowd more.
Of the actresses there were Lillah McCarthy, Lena
Ashwell, Eva and Decima Moore, Gertrude Kingston,
Yvette Guilbert, and Olive Terry. Princess Bariat-
insky and Annie Besant walked in the throng; also
Lady William Butler, Lady Frances Balfour, Lady
Beatrice Kemp, Muriel Lady de la Warr, Lady
Scott Monerieff and various other behandled per-
sonages—among them Princess Sophia Duleep Singh,
who has been saying- “No vote, no taxes,” in a firm
voice to the authorities recently. Then there were
the hundreds of women graduates in gowns and
hoods, and the 700 white-robed and valorous dames
and damsels who have been to Holloway at one time
or another.
I see that a confectionery firm lately pre-
sented George V. with a cake weighing
6001 b., and that he graciously accepted it.

Lala Williams, the pretty, dark-haired
sister of a one-time politician, was married
last week to Hugh Callan, who used to play
brilliant football for South Melbourne a
few seasons b£.ck. The bridegroom's father
was a well-¥nown London Bank manager
years ago. After the ceremony, the pair
went voyaging to Cairns for a winter honey-
moon. Terang, in the western district, will
be their later place of abode.
Dr. Miller 1 ' is smiling serenely through an
epidemic of congratulations brought on by
the announcement of his engagement to Miss
Levy.
Toorak is again busy buying wedding pre-
sents. Early in August Hilda Grantham is
to marry Captain Bertram Graham in St.
John’s, Toorak. Another August wedding
concerns the Grices; but this function will
happen in Sydney. The two people most
concerned are Tom, son of John Grice, ami
Miss Clarice Hewlett.
A gallant majah, who admired her all the
time that she was growing up, lately elicited a
fluttering “Yes” from pretty Miss Marjorie
Bingham, sister of Mrs. Anthony Hordern.
Talking of smart people who spell their
names with a siphon, the Winter-Irving
household is preparing to receive daughter
Laura, the Baroness, with her husband, the
German Baron. They are due by this
week’s mail from Europe. Hubby is very
out of health, and his spouse is bringing him
for a rest cure to the paternal home. Miss
Laura-as-was is to have the company of
sister Florence a few months later, but
there is no talk of brother Cyril returning
home just yet.
Esta d’Argo and tenor Ben Davies are
coming to this city in September. Esta,
like Dolores, spent years of drudgery at the
piano keyboard learning to be a pianist, be-
fore she could persuade her teachers that
she wanted to sing and could sing. Tenor
Davies, now a burly veteran, had a career
in the church mapped out for him, and
would possibly have risen to a bishopric on
his top-note if he had not neglected to take
Holy Orders.
Gladys Baker, eldest daughter of Walter,
for many years “principal” with Bland Holt,
is a member of the “Chocolate Soldier” Com-
pany, now rehearsing in Melbourne. Miss
: Baker owns a fine contralto voice, and her
friends expect her to do things in comic
opera.
A be-titled dame, who joined in the mad
rush after a theatrical star, is bewailing a
horrible mistake. The matron had left her
card at the star’s domicile, and in due
course the latter returned the call. Unfor-
tunately for the hostess, she was entertain-
ing a small but select hen-party when the
caller was announced by her married name ;
so, taking the new comer to be some climber
of no importance, the hostess, after a per-
functory greeting, waved her to a seat on
the outside edge. Only one of the assembled
guests ventured to talk to the stranger,
who, having a few hundred visits to return,
soon rose to depart from the chilly atmos-
phere. “Good-bye,” murmured the star.
"Good-bye,” replied the hostess coldly. “So
kind of you to call on me,” smiled the star.
The hostess still looked as if she had regis-
tered a vow never to smile. So the visitor
kindly added, “I am afraid you don’t know
me. lam Miss .” Then a change came
over the spirit of the matron’s dream. She
gasped. Then she gushed. But she gushed
too late. Her visitor, still smiling, refused
compliments, attention or tea. She just
twinkled out of that doorway for ever.
“At the Sign of the Southern Cross” is
the rollicking title of a book of serious poems
by Annie Macdonald. The volume was
given a good airing at the Esperanto Club
last week, when extracts were recited by
Mr. H. Payne to a friendly audience, which
included Dr. and Mrs. Tyson Randall, ana-
lyst Blackett, artist Bunny and wife, and the
Donald Mackinnons. Miss Dorothy Gibbons
sang poems set to music, and Louise Smith
had charge of the piano. Margaret Basker-
ville read a paper on sculpture and poetry,
and the proceedings generally were on a
skyscraping plane, till refreshments and the
lift brought all back to earth again.
Goathland, the “elegant mansion” of the
late Malcolm McEacharn, at Ivew, is to go
under the hammer. The trustees offered it
to the Victorian Government, whose repre-
sentatives viewed it with some idea of ac-
quiring it as a hut for the Excrescencies.
But Governors require large dining-rooms;
and, although this apartment at Goathland
is of respectable size, it was regarded as too
small; so there was no business.
In consequence of a rush of donations to
the cashbox, Ballarat is getting ahead
rapidly with its nursing scheme. The musi-
cal city has the charity habit in an acute
form. The chemists, following the lead of
the cabmen and tram Co., have offered to
compound medicine free of charge for the
patients of the new Nightingale, Nurse
Jessie Reeves. If this sort of thing con-
tinues, she will find it difficult to get rid of
money at all. The Free Kindergarten move-
ment is also geting a lift in this vicinity.
Mrs. Alfred Deakin arrived last week with
Mrs. Camphin, the kindergarten expert who
has been doing such good work in Melbourne.
If all goes well, the babies will be able to sit
round and learn things early next year.
The muff, used in the beginning solely for
warmth, has gradually grown to the size of
a gunny-bag, and the average woman has
become so accustomed to having her hands
occupied in carrying it that the approach of
warmer weather terrifies her. “What will
we do with our hands?” is the distressful
cry of the moment. To utilise them in doing
the housework is, of course, unthinkable.
There is a rumor afoot that summer may
find us with wicker-work muffs decorated
with flowers. Here is a chance to popu-
larise the useful market basket. Let it be
the thing for fashionables to carry large
market baskets trimmed with seasonable
vegetables. If Fashion dictates that the
only -time of day to be seen taking the air
is the early morning, small-waisted house-
hold bills should come in with a rush.
A harem skirt whirled out of one crush at
the Newsboys’ Ball, and vanished in an-
other ; but I had time to notice that the
tunic was very long, and that the (no other
word for them) trousers were wide.
Managers of registry offices, where legend
says Marianne once grew wild, are missing
a chance of fortune by neglecting to run tea-
rooms in connection with their dismal
bureaux. Maid-less missuses spend hours
and much cash in adjacent fooderies whilst
waiting for help in a cap and apron. The
same women meet day after day in these
dingy halls of hope, exchanging lamenta-
tions and eyeing one another’s millinery.
Only when utterly tired out do they reluct-
antly leave to spend money elsewhere in
much-needed refreshments. All the time she
is away the helpless one is tortured by the
thought that the model maid may have
turned up and been spirited away by one of
the other cats. Let a registry office fix up a
tearoom and lounge, and strew it with the
latest fashion papers, and servant hunting
will become a social game. Why not have
bridge parties in the back boudoir, the pen-
alty for leaving the game to go and interview
a cook or parlor-maid being fixed at half-a-
crown for “Kitty,” the last surviving
missus to get “Kitty” as a consolation
stakes?
A smart Melbourne girl, of the habitually
unusual sort, seems to have tickled Rudyard
Kipling’s fancy with her blunt-nibbed pen.
In a wild moment she dashed off a letter to
him, telling him how she loved most of his
books, and two of them in particular, and
asking him to autograph the enclosed por-
trait which she had torn from a magazine.
Kip replied with the sweetest of notes to
the effect that he hoped Australia had a lot
of girls at home like her. Also, he sent
autographed copies of the two books she had
named, and pledged himself to find one of his
very best photos and forward it anon.
A Coronateur who has been wandering
around loose with the nobility, writes
heatedly as follows :
Australians say that English Society women
see nothing of their children. What a calumny!
This mother (a duchess) reads to her children for an
hour every day, visits them in the schoolroom, and
tucks them in at night with her own hands. She
never goes to bed herself without first going into the
nursery, and she assures me that nine out of every
10 mothers do the same.
There now!
Among the men who deal largely in Di-
vorce Court proceedings there is talk of
“awful revelations” to come from a suit
which is “listed for next sitting.” What the
waiter saw and the chauffeur discreetly
winked at may make matter for lovely head-
lines in the virtuous daily papers. The par-
ties are labelled “Smart Set,” and their
names have loomed large in small paragraphs
for years past.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

SHOOTING SCIATICA
Tortured by sharp, hot pains
in Hip and Legs*
——■—♦
This man crippled till he had
to give up athletics.
Tells how he was cured.
In the case of Mr. Arthur J. Grice, a
prominent Tasmanian athlete, living at
Duffield-street, Queenstown, he was jcom-
pelled to abandon football and sport by re-
curring attacks of Sciatica. After : long
suffering Mr. Grice was completely cured
by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. As Sciatica,
like Neuralgia, is a disorder of the nerves,
the direct treatment to cure the cause aims
at restoring the nerves to their proper jstate
of tone. Hot applications cannot do .this.
As Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills make :'new
blood and tone the nerves, they have
achieved great success in curing Scihtica,
and Mr. Grice’s case is a striking instance.
He said :
“Up to the age of 23 I was always strong
and healthy and a well-known athlete.
From that time forward I was compelled
to give up all sport, such as running, foot-
ball, etc., owing to repeated attacks of
Sciatica in the right hip, extending to the
right knee. I consulted several doctors who
prescribed for me some medicine to take;
some blistering me and giving me lotions.
The blistering was so severe that it took all
the skin off my hip to the knee. The pain
at times was well nigh unbearable. It: was
very sharp, like needles being pushed , into
the flesh. I used to : be worse at night,
especially if I got wet or had been working
in water. The sciatic nerve was very tender
to the touch. The attack used to vary,
sometimes lasting for a week or more,: and
at other times for a day or so. It was
always a burning pain; walking would irri-
tate it.* The muscles wasted away. I had
been in this state for about 10 years,, and
whenever it came on I used to consult the
doctors, but without receiving permanent
relief, and had come to the conclusion that
it would come and go whenever it liked.
Eventually a fellow workman who had been
cured of Sciatica after being bedridden for
three weeks, advised me to give Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills a trial, as they cured him.
I got a box, and benefited so much from
their use I kept on with them, and by the
time I had taken four boxes I felt com-
pletely cured. That is nearly two years
since, and I am happy to say I have never
had a twinge or any sign of the complaint
since, and 1 can conscientiously recommend
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to anyone suffering
as I did, or for any other complaint arising
from a disorder of the blood, as I have
known several who have benefited by jtheir
use.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The other day R. O. Blackwood, of the
Victorian Employers’ Federation, got busy,
and, as a result, the “Liberal” party and
the “People’s” party foregathered and agreed
on a common platform, and, in consequence,
everything in the Cabbage Garden is lovely
—till the hot wind comes. The so-called
platform includes one plank for the re-
tention and “liberalisation” of the Vic.
House of Fat; another for a more liberal
policy of rail and road extension ; and an-
other for the encouragement of private en-
terprise. Whether this last plank is in-
tended to apply to road-making and so forth
or onlv to such things as coal mines, trams,
etc., isn’t stated —and, for that matter,
doesn’t need to be.
DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT.
There was a large amount of flabby sentiment
about the cry of child slavery. Every child born
should be taught to make himself useful from the
time he first could become useful. (Applause.)—
Wade, at the Farmers’ Conference.
N.S.W.: “Wot’s ’e done , Constable!”
CONSTABLE WADE, V.C.: “Done? The lazy
little cow wants to go to school, instead of
earning his poor father's living!”
The Anti-Sosh farmer has been flirting
with the “tiger” again! This time it was
the Shire Council of Bulla (Sunbury a.nd
the country round) which viewed with
much favor a proposal to establish a muni-
cipal sheep-shearing outfit, and would have
gone into the business but for the fear that
the eastern riding, which only becomes in-
terested in sheep when they are mutton,
would “kick up” at subsidising the western
riding, which grows the jumbucks in its
paddocks.
Quoth ’Enery Weedon in the Vic. As-
sembly the other day :
I do not approve the principle of promotion by
merit in the police force, and the police do not.
Of course not! What should merit have
to do with anything? If the stupid principle
were encouraged, some fool might try to
apply it to even the Legislature presently.
The greedy political Fatman, who thought
he was going to make a stalking horse once
more of “The Flag,” must be horribly disap-
pointed at the total absence of any commo-
tion in England over Andrew' Fisher’s re-
mark that the Empire wasn’t an Empire, but
a very loose association of nations. The
fact, as The Bulletin remarked last week,
is that J. Bull has himself been saying the
same thing so often lately that he really
doesn’t notice when anybody else says it.
Thus the London Referee, an Imperialistic
and somewhat Jingoistic paper, said on June
8, speaking of the hospitable relations be-
tween Britain and the Dominions: —
For a hundred years the foreign policy of the Em-
pire, which is not an Empire, but a System, has been
conducted from London.
So, if Fisher did say to W. T. Stead:
“We are not an Empire, but a loosely sys-
tematised association of nations,” he would
have been merely echoing the sentiment of a
red-hot “Imperial” journal.
SLIPPERY POLITICS.
The Weary-Watt Government is going to
the trouble of introducing a Bill to abolish
the unclean habit of “kissing the Book,”
and it proposes to substitute the English
practice of taking the volume in the right
hand and repeating the present superfluous
remarks. The Scottish form of oath —in
which the Book is not used, the right hand
being raised while the swearer repeats a
form of words—is already a legal oath in
Victorian courts, and all that is necessary
is an order from J. Dry Brown to magis-
trates to swear all witnesses in that fashion.
Still, the abolition of the mouthing of the
insanitary volume that has been mauled and
pawed over and dribbled on by hundreds of
more or less diseased persons is something.
Prahran (Vic.) muni-
cipal council has suffered
another Socialistic out-
break, and lately ordered
free lectures for the local
inhabitants. The first of
the “talks” was delivered
by Professor Skeats, and
was on the dreadfully ex-
citing topic of “The Re-
lation between Scenery
and Geology.” A small
house heard the wisdom
with an air of suppressed
boredom. Towards the
end of this month the
second of the addresses
will be given by Archi-
bald T. Strong, who will
tell Prahran about the
sublimities of Swin-
burne’s poems, Swin-
burne being, of course, a
person who lives a great
distance away. This
paper cordially approves
of free lectures; but, somehow, the syllabus
doesn’t seem to have begun as happily as it
might.
The prospect of a La-
bor daily is about the
. only real light in the
tangled N.S.W. political
situation —a tangle due
mainly to the Referenda
outbreak of State Spites.
The weekly Worker,
though it does good pro-
paganda work, can’t push
into the argument often
enough; the party must
have its say. Watson
saw the supreme neces-
sity of a Labor daily
when he abandoned a
safe seat and a Cabinet
leadership to work tor it.
Kitchener began a suc-
cessful invasion of the
Soudan by ordering a
railway in Birmingham.
Watson, similarly long-
sighted, sees that the
supreme weapon in the
Labor campaign is the
daily, and in that, though
so little heard of nowa-
days, he shows his states-
manship and his capacity
for leadership.
“Red Tape Junr.” : My ex-boss, Gregory
Wade, nearly melted me to tears the other
night in the N.S.W. Assembly when he
moved for a Select Committee to consider
the complaint of one Carpenter that he,
like many more, had been swindled out of
his pension rights by the Public Service
Board. When Wade was in office he strenu-
ously and successfully opposed a similar
motion on Carpenter’s behalf, and when he
was reminded of the fact the other night, he
had the nerve to reply that he hadn't the
full facta then, though, observe, he was the
Minister at the time. Was that confessed
ignorance the reason that he also fought
Giddy, Heffernan, Preville and others right
up to the Privy Council, and landed the
State in a swamp of Costs and muddied its
reputation for fair play to old and faithful
servants? What sort of man is that, on his
own admission, to truest. thgl' country to f
It moves! Even Weary’s acting-Health
Minister, landlord llazelthorn, has concluded
that the time is ripe for a municipal milk
supply, and has called a conference of muni-
cipal councils to see if some scheme can be
hatched out. Certainly, the propputy-own-
ing, Right Thinking class, which mostly
rules the councils, doesn’t seem a very likely
hen to do justice to the egg.
THE CARVER’S ADVANTAGE.
Early sittings of N.S.W. Commission on Food
Supply resolve themselves into an exposure of the
doings of the fish middleman. —News item.
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE MIDDLEMAN : "Now
then, don’t get looking at me—go on with
your meal!”
The dreadful land tax is still at it. A
large slice of Kilmany Park, which has been
lying like a tombstone on Sale’s chest, has
been sold to the Victorian State Government
—the fool Government, by the wmy, which
lately complained that the Commonwealth
tax w r as embarrassing it.
Melbourne Age on the aldermen of the
local City Council: —
The city has municipalised electricity for light
and power'; but there is good reason to suspect that,
instead of utilising its electrical scheme for the full
benefit of ratepayers, the City Council has restrained
the expansion of electrical power in the interests of
the gas monopoly. The aldermen are the champions
of Vested Interest.
True enough that the aldermen are the in-
struments of Vested Interest. But they are
not the champions, correctly speaking. The
champions are, in the House of Fat, which
will in due course reject Prendergast’s
Aldermen Abolition Bill when it has passed
the Assembly. The one grand, final de-
fender of public abuses in Victoria is the
House of Fat.
Waddell’s wild attack on Justice Higgins
is not his first offence. At Katoomba, in
April last, he got off this bilious piffle about
the Australian majority that returned the
Federal Labor party to power:—
What they (the Labor party) wanted was for the
vast majority of the people who were industrious,
thrifty, sober and energetic to maintain the idle,
drunken, dissolute loafers and wasters of the com-
munity. The whole influence of the Labor party all
along “the line was to drag down the energetic, in-
dustrious honest man, and to make much of the idle,
scheming loafer.
In this case the electors were able to strike
back, and they hit the Twaddellers where
the chicken met the axe. But it is still left
for the electors of Belubula to say if the
man so blisteringly described by Justice
Pliggins fairly represents them.
A recent Freetrade psean was sung in
Melbourne Argus over the growth of Bri-
tish ship-building, and this allegation was
made: —-
To secure this supremacy she has to pay no costly
subsidies, bounties, or subventions to either building
firms or ship-owners. But. . . during 10 years, the
French Government paid nearly 5-1 million pounds
in bounties and over £10,000,000 in subventions for
postal services.
This “no-subvention” yarn is getting rather
dull. The Tariff Commission in 1909 noted
that British Government payments for ship-
ping services were £2,000,000 a year, which
.passes the French average, and the Admir-
alty orders to British shipbuilding yards
averaged £21,000,000 a year. Add what
they call “administrative protection” _ (viz.,
preference to home industries), and it will
be seen that British shipbuilding is by no
means the Dry Dog it is cracked up to be.
A MARTYR TO PRINCIPLE.
Referring to the recent Treaty between England
and Japan, Mr. Bruce Smith is of opinion that the
“racial pride” of Japan is entitled to greater respect
from Australians, who should cultivate a “national
modesty” in regard to Britain’s ally.
YOUNG AUSTRALIA: “Why can’t I have a
stick like him! If he tackled me, I couldn’t
hit him back.”
GRANNY: "Don’t speak like that, dear. You
must always be nice to that little boy, and if
he hits you, be modest, and tell him that you
are sure he’s too much of a gentleman to
mean anything offensive.”
A weary Liberal without a roost is I’on-
ald Mackinnon, the “philosophic-Rndieal,”
M.L.A. for Prahran (Vic.). He has just
mourned publicly that he can find no Party
and no Programme. Labor he curses, and
the Mixed Tories he mentions with a shud-
der. But it is chiefly Donald’s own fault
that there is no Third
Party left for twi-
lighters like himself.
He was guilty of a Fu-
sion in 1904, when he
and 10 other “Liber-
als” ran and tucked
themselves under the
sooty wing of T. Bent,
out of sheer funk for
their own political ex-
istence. Donald and
Co. shouldn’t run sniv-
elling to the Conser-
vatives one day, and
call them ignorant old
fossils the next. It
isn’t pretty or plucky.
These wobbling move-
ments remind Tiie
Bulletin of an owl
mentioned-m-Wbite’s Natural History. The
fowl is minus a toe, and oscillates wherever
he perches. Mackinnon’s see-sawing is due
to a similar cause—he lacks grip.
Labor members Tunnecliffe and Outtrim,
of Victoria, are sponsoring two little Bills
which have death written on their ,face.
One is a Daylight Saving measure, by
which the Cabbage Garden would advance
all its clocks one hour from the first Sun-
day in October until the first Sunday in
March. The idea has something to recom-
mend it, but would be an abomination un-
less adopted by all the States. The other
Bill makes provision for the application of
the Referendum and the Initiative, on a
petition signed by 50,000 electors. Thig is a
democratic idea that ought to be embodied
in every constitution; but as about the first
use Victoria, would make of it would be to
abolish the House of Fat, that mossgrown
ruin is certain to “view it with alarm” and
fall on it.
MORE TROUBLE FOR COLLINS STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A strike in the middle of the harvest.” This is
the threat now flatly uttered to farmers. A season’s
output would be lost. The factories would be with-
out raw material. The populace would be without
food. The suffering of the very poor would be the
worst, and it might lead to actual starvation. —
Ghastly pen-picture painted by the Argus, 26/7’ll.
The Collins-street farmer bent his head in terrible
grief, and sobbed ;
His scalding tears persistently among the proof-
sheets lobbed;
He wept, his face upon his hands, his whiskers
clogged with ink,
And moaned in pain: “Oh, my heart will
break for the pup-pup-poor, I think!”
From red eyes, large and sparkling signs
of ceaseless sorrow oozed;
Within his stout, well-nourished frame his
beautiful soul was bruised.
“Oh, sorrow!” he sighed, “the poor will
see starvation loom in sight
When pup-pup-prices rise. (Yes, we will
arrange for that, all right!)”
He opened his face and howled, and great
was the sorrowful noise of him,
Cursing the star of the striking serf in a
manner extremely grim,
Lifting his voice to the cobwebbed roof of
his silent and gloomy den,
For that slaves should rise and carry them-
selves at last like other men!
The Collins-street farmer’s tears flowed on,
and the lot of them went to waste;
His long, wild whiskers strayed unheeded,
and gathered up ink and paste ;
And, oh, his soul was sore that day, with the sorrows
he did endure.
“Ah, not for my own I weep,” he said, “I’m sad for
the pup-pup-poor!”

HOW TO REMEDY HAIR TROUBLES.
BY A SPECIALIST.
No matter how careful you may be of your
hair —how often or how faithfully you may
shampoo or brush it —the hair cannot attain
the thick glossy brilliance nature intended for
all men, women and children so long as the
dandruff germ is sapping the strength and
vitality of the hair roots. Frequent brush-
ing of the hair and a shampoo once every two
or three weeks are both valuable aids to
gaining hair beauty, but they cannot destroy
the dandruff germ. So far as known the
only way to destroy this germ is to rub into
the scalp twice a day a mixture prepared by
mixing 3oz. Bay Rum with |-dram Menthol
Crystals and loz. Lavona de Composee. As
this preparation not only destroys the dand-
ruff germ, but is also a truly marvellous hair-
■ Tower, it should be aoplied only where hair
is desired. Any chemist can prepare the above
formula, or you can procure the ingredients
and mix them at home; but you must use it
regularly; and be sure to brush your hair
frequently and give it an occasional sham-
poo. Avoid the frequent use of hot curling-
tongs. as they tend lo make the. hair, dull
and lifeless. ....

SPORTING
NOTIONS
As Sporting Notions expected, Pearce was
not a match for Arnst. He was in splendid fettle,
and full of confidence, and he rowed himself right out.
Ihe trouble was that when he had produced all that
was in him, the sum total was less than Arnst’s total;
*md that was the end of it. The longer swing of the
Maorilander, backed up by his superior strength,
won him the race.
Pearce made the pace a cracker from the start,
and led the way. Arnst seemed to lack the freedom
and dash so characteristic of him. He was not
coruscating, but he plugged hard ; and in spite of all
his fireworks, at the half-mile Pearce was not more
than a length in the lead. At this point Arnst
looked round to see where his rival was, and im-
mediately began to put more power into his strokes.
Approaching the mile, Arnst drew level, but got
into Pearce’s water, and a foul seemed imminent.
It was only avoided by Arnst practically stopping
dead to allow Pearce to get clear. This little epi-
sode, though it saved Arnst from fouling, once more
gave the challenger a load of a length as they passed
the mile beacon. The time was smin. 35sec. Pearce
thus stood forth as the equal of the great Harry
Searle for the mile, and thereat his followers took
fresh heart.
AVhen Pearce had got his clear length ahead, Arnst
became suddenly very busy. His sluggishness in the
first mile disappeared. He became brilliant. His
boat fairly flew through the water as he overhauled
Pearce. On the steamers the Arnst party was begging
all and sundry to take 2 to 1, but there was no
business. If it I>< not crushed the challenger, that
burst of speed had at any rate broken the hearts of
his backers. Gliding past, Arnst settled down with
the lead of a length and a-half. He had cut out
the mile and a-half in Bmin. 39sec., while Pearce
had taken three seconds longer. It was at the mile
and three-quarters that Pearce’s stamina raised its
first signals of distress. He seemed to slow down,
while Arnst increased the distance between them.
At the two miles, which had been covered in llmin.
20sec., Pearce made a great rally, and succeeded
in creeping a little closer to the champion. But
the race was over and the procession had begun,
and at 2J 'miles Arnst was five lengths to the good,
or, to reduce it to time, lOsec. ahead of Pearce.
Then he slowed down, and paddled home in ease
and comfort, with four lengths to spare. The time
for the full course was 19min. 46sec.—-a record for
the full distance in the championship race. The
time would have been less —much less, in fact—had
Arnst not slowed down in the final stages of the
race, when he knew that the prize was won.
After the race Arnst indulged in his usual
rhodomontade about “the hardest race of his life,”
Pearce being much better than he thought, he (Arnst)
being fit only for bed, and all the rest of it. As a
matter of fact, the big Maorilander was never really
extended after the first mile. He only came out of his
shell once, and that was when he took the lead. As
a cool-headed customer, Richard Arnst takes a lot of
beating. His eulqgy of his opponents is due to
ARNST , STILL THE WORLD'S CHAM-
PION SCULLER.
genuine good nature, no doubt; but it is excellent
policy all the same. Summed up, it amounts to
this: “This man is a marvel. It is simply wonder-
ful how he scoots along. The way that he rowed
satisfies me he is one of the greatest scullers the
world has ever known. His skill is perfection, his
strength is gigantic, his pluck beyond human under-
standing. I had to row myself blue to beat him.
Re is a wonder!” And so, by praising his op-
ponent to the skies, he gilds his own glory; for no
matter how great a man the vanquished may be, the
vanquisher, which is Arnst, must be greater!
There have been 41 struggles for the
world’s sculling championship; 21 were decided on
the Parramatta, nine on the Thames, and the balance
in other sections of the globe. Since Trickett beat
J. H. Sadler on the Thames, in 1876, £33,300 has
been put up as stake-money.
Professional sculling provides more dead-
heads than any other branch of sport. On Saturday,
it was estimated that over 60,000 lined the banks of
the Parramatta, while only a few thousands paid for
a place on the steamers. The £BOO “gate” which
they yielded will be divided between Arnst and
Pearce, after exes, are paid. Even this little lot
was the biggest “gate” since Beach and Hanlan met
’way back in the ’Bo’s.
The training for the sculling champion-
ship has pushed another sculler into the limelight.
Frank Starr —one of Arnst’s pacemakers, and yet a
novice—has been matched against young Peter Kemp
as a try-out.
* * * *
Next Saturday opens the V.A.T.C. meet-
ing, which is the same as the V.R.C. Grand National,
only less so. Acceptances for the Australian Hurdle
Race (worth £lOOO to the winner) will not be de-
clared until this paper is going to press; yet it is
safe to predict that the field for the 34-mile event
will be less than a score. The distance seems all in
favor of the light-weights, but thus far not one of
them, bar Rufus, is fancied, it being taken for
granted that Bribery (now reduced to 9st. 51b.) has
lost his pace. If he had only half-lost it, the old
hero would be good enough, anyhow. And if Rufus
were an undoubted stayer he would carry the bright
gold of the knowing ones; or Black Native might
win if he could stay. Leaving the ifs out of
the running, the most reasonable fancies are Obi,
because he carries the weight he humped into third
place for the recent Grand National, and tneets
Arquebuse, the winner, on 331 b. better terms ; Arque-
buse, because nobody knows how good he isn’t; and
Battery, because his fourth in the Grand National
gives him a bare outside chance, and his breeding,
like that of Arquebuse, makes for stamina. Battery
may be worth backing at the price. Up to now the
son of Bundook has disappointed his friends, but Sat-
urday’s race will give him a chance to wipe out the
stain.

A satisfied air pervades Australian horse-
racing bodies, wherefore this season the retiring
committees of the A.J.C. (Sydney), Victorian R.C.,
and the S. Aus. J. 0., have all been returned to office

Sydney League Rugby competition saw a
fresh shuffle of positions on Saturday. South Syd-
ney and Glebe are now level with 16 points each,
Newtown has 13, Eastern Suburbs 12, and Annandale
9. North Sydney, AVestern Suburbs, and Balmain
have 7,5, and 2 respectively. The pot boiled over
twice <jn Saturday; once when South Sydney met its
first defeat this season, Glebe winning" by 9 points
to 5. The struggle between these clubs is always a
popular draw, no matter what code the ’bailers play
under. It has been so from the beginning, and
Saturday’s match, in spite of the boat race, was no
exception; no less than 15,000 people crowded into
the Sports’ Ground, and mostly howled themselves
dumb. It was a great match, too. After the first
half, which ended 3 points all, it was expected
that South Sydney, helped by the wind, would
simply prance over Glebe. To make matters worse,
Glebe was two men short. But the Glebe pack is
indomitable, and, rising more, dreadful from each
adverse stroke, fairly scintillated. It was a supreme
effort, and a successful one. For once in its life
Glebe richly deserved its victory. The other up-
heaval was when Eastern Suburbs, minus Messenger,
met the formidable Newtown team, and played a 13
points draw. It is a solemn fact, that when Mes-
senger is on the field, the E.S. team spends so much
time in admiring him, that he has to play the other
fellows on his own ; when Messenger is not there, the
team plays, and plays well. Annandale, which has
been having a bad time lately, on Saturday took
surcease. It met North Sydney and pranced all over
it —31 points to 11. Against Western Suburbs Bal-
main’s consistent ill-luck blossomed once more on
Birchgrove Oval. Western won by 21 to 1U
In the Union Rugby competition Univer-
sity and Newtown are together with 18 points each,
Manly is in the second row with 15, and Western
Suburbs in the third with 13. These four are left
to battle for the premiership. Early in the season
’Varsity had a great run of luck, which stopped
short when the team met Manly, though it resumed
again after the Village had been left behind. On
Saturday it met Manly in the second round, and re-
ceived its second doing of the season, the Village
winning by 10 points to 3. The other match of the
“A” division, Newtown v. Western Suburbs, was a
run-away affair, in which Newtown did as it liked —-
24 points to 3. The passing of the Western backs
was about the wildest animal seen in Sydtiey since
the days when the Bunyip roared in George-street
North.
The N.S.W. Union Rugby team which
journeyed to Queensland last week played at Bris-
bane before Wee Macgregor and 7000 other grains of
the salt-of-the-earth on Saturday. The weather was
brilliant. The play wasn’t. Both sides missed
chances galore. However, the Cornstalks unwound a
series of passing charges, so at half-time the
score was 15 to Queensland’s 3. When the second
half started Queensland did the unwinding. A little
more and Queensland would probably have won, for
N.S.W. added only 3 points while Queensland put on
9, and the balance of luck was on the side of the
visiting team. - Ma thus won by 18 to 12.
Balmain (Sydney) is a proud suburb. It
had two Soccer teams in the field, and one has car-
ried off the Rawson Cup and the other got away
with the Assoc. Cup. So the suburb feels that it can
afford to do badly at Rugby.
This being the time of year when the
strong teams are playing all they know, Saturday’s
’oofball scores in Melbourne indicated some notable
thrashings. The Premiers encountered Melbourne,
on the latter’s ground, and made hacks of their op-
ponents. The big club’s representatives excelled in
marking and speed, but didn’t know what to do with
the ball when they got it. When the bell rang the
scores were—’Wood 52 points, Melbourne 30. Rich-
mond went over to South Melbourne with a notion
of repeating their early feat of walloping Skinner’s
hirelings; but the latter are out for all the points
they can acquire, and the board’s final remark was—
South 73 points, Richmond 37. ’Roy is also on the
hunt after points, and though it had little the better
of ’Varsity up to the interval, its training stood to
it —’Roy 86, ’Varsity 49. Essendon, which has the
same incentive to boot goals early and often, tackled
Geelong, and came out with 61 points to Sleepy
Hollow’s 35; and Carlton impressed on St. Kilda
‘ the fact that a League team isn’t built in a day by
shamelessly piling up 129 points to 15. :
Though it made such a poor exhibition, the St.
Kilda team had the sympathy of the crowd. The old
Saints team, which started the season with a draw
of £3 3s. per player (subsequently reduced to £2
25., and then 305.) had gone on strike, nominally be-
cause of the exclusion from the dressing-room of
certain ex-committeemen, but in reality because the
committee, half of which was newly-elected last
March, had a mind of its own. It had advanced
some £75 out of its own pocket to finance the
players through the earlier matches, and, as this
sum is still owing, it justifiably refused to splash
around more coin than it could possibly help. So,
on Saturday week, after being soundly walloped by
Melbourne, 18 of the team “slung in their uni-
forms.” The committee, knowing the club’s chances
are gone for this season, accepted the resignations,
and set about building a new and lusty team for next
year. By Wednesday the malcontents had got wis-
dom, and sought to be re-admitted, but the com-
mittee viewed the proposal coldly, and sent the best
18 it could pick into the field, with orders to bog in
as best they could. So few of the League officials
boast the possession of backbone, that it is refresh-
ing to find a few who have a little.
In the Ass., Essendon, certain of first place
and the right to a “grand final,” if necessary, took
things easy, and let Brighton down gently with a
score of 56 points to 31. Port scraped together 46
to Williamstown’s 28 ; Brunswick improved its aver-
age by gathering in 103 to ’Cote’s 41, and North de-
posed P’ran from second position by notching 52 to
PEARCE , THE BEATEN SCULLER.
29. Also, ’Scray passed Preston a doing, to the tune
of 146 points to 16, though, as both teams retire
from public life at the end of the round, this ac-
cumulation of points looks like wasted energy.
Through the week the Law has been poking its
nose into various hoofball squabbles, but owing
to the honorarium’s fatuousness, with poor success.
Two pugnacious Port barrackers, who had to
be carried to the lock-up through a storm of stones
and jam tins, were fined 20s. each, and a Fitzroy
Junior ’bailer, who broke an opponent’s jaw, was
handed a similar penalty. The umpire, who super-
vised this latter match —’Roy Juniors v. Yarraville
—seems to have a will of his own, inasmuch as, be-
sides the ruffian above-mentioned, he reported six
others, while the following week he reported every
blessed member of the two teams, Yarraville and
Preston Juniors, for rough play, assault, foul lan-
guage, discourtesy to himself and general black-
guardism. That young man means business, but he
would do well to keep away from Yarraville for a
time.
N.S.W. Football League has procured 10
acres of the old Rosebery (Sydney) racecourse, for
the Australian Rules kickers. The enclosure will ac-
commodate cricket, tennis, bowls and other pastimes
throughout the year; and, if the present inten-
tions are not forsaken, the enclosure will be one of
the few up-to-date affairs in Sydney.

The Stevenson-Reece game in Melbourne
revealed no reason why Fred Lindrum shouldn’t put
up a great fight against the champion, even with the
limitation of 25 consecutive hazards off the red.
Last week there was little or nothing to choose be-
tween Reece and Stevenson. They played much the
same sort of billiards, Reece being the more delicate
in his touch, and more masterly in his trick of put-
ting “side” on his ball, whilst Stevenson showed
superior management in making position for top-of-
the-table play, and was occasionally the steadier
general of the two. If the improving Lindrum was
about the same thing as Reece the other week, when
he didn’t introduce the “Gray stroke” into the argu-
ment, he can’t be much below Stevenson’s level to-
day. Presently he will go above it.

Alas, for the prestige of the pale-face! There’s
some comfort, however, in the knowledge that the
all-blacks are coming here to belt each other chiefly,
although, no doubt, Willie Lang will be called upon
to do something for the white race. By the way,
consider Lang’s luck. Without doing anything ap-
proaching big licks, he has succeeded in keeping
right in the game, and is the only man of conse-
quence who can be called upon to cut purses with
visiting stoush-mongers. The latest arranged visi-
tation is due to the fact that Australia has money
to burn, and Jake Johnson is just the party to burn
it.

At a recent Adelaide boxing conflict the
contestants were so ladylike, and the crowd called
for gore so persistently, that after round four the
local Mclnstoush jumped into the ring and announced
that, if more support were not given to the under-
taking biz., he’d give the purse to found a home for
Incurable Teetotalers. One boxer (the advt. called
him “Dave Smith, of Sydney”) refused to be any-
thing but a lady, and broke the rules of the game as
a protest. The incurable teetotalers, accordingly, lost
the purse on a foul, amid groans.
“Fighting Parson” Sams has at last met
his Waterloo at, Lucknow station (Q.). He has
taken his conqueror in tow, and both men are train-
ing hard and fast for the light- and heavy-weight
championship of North Queensland, billed for August
10, at Charters Towers. Sams and his prot£gS are
expected to carry off the championships in their re-
spective classes, and the former’s win would be hailed
with delight through Bananaland. Should Sams fail
to carry off the honors in the Towers, he will not
compete for the amateur Australian championship
soon to be decided in Brisbane.
Brisbane is to have a few fights during
Show week. On August 5 .Toe Russell and Sid Sulli-
van meet: on August 9 Bill Lang and Bill Squires
will settle the Australian Heavyweight Champion-
ship ; and on August 12 Arthur Cripps and Ted
Whiting will deal out stoush.
Owing to England and America deciding
to have their preliminary tennis match in Yankee-
land, only the final splash for the Davis Cup will be
played in Maoriland, between the winner of this
round and Australasia. The State Associations,
which were expecting to enrich themselves, therefore
miss the vehicle; but as evidence that the match in
M.L. is going to be a big affair, a syndicate has
vainly offered £5OO for the “gate.”
* * * •*
Last week the N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Asso-
ciation took another step towards the cemetery, by
deciding to sell up the eo. Lack , of funds left no
other way to dance to the music. However, there
are rumors that a new Association will be launched
to buy up the assets of the co., and begin where the
old body perished ; therefore, what should be a flour-
ishing branch of sport is to be resurrected “under
new management”—as they say at the hash-house.
And presumably the new Ass. j won’t hoist a “Keep-
off-the-grass-on-Sundays” notice.
* * * *
N.S.W. gathered in the' “rubber” with an
unbeaten record at the inter-State baseball dust-up,
last week, squelching Victoria in three games, and
obliterating Tasmania twice. The efforts of the men
from Murray’s strip of earth : were very poor; they
were defeated by 11 runs to 1, 8 to 6, and 13 to 1;
while Tasmania had a sorry time, being squashed
by N.S.W.’s second team to the tune of 30 to nil, and
16 to 7.
There is little doubt that J. D. Williams's
six days’ cycle race will prove successful: because
practically every first-class American rider, barring
Kramer, is coming to take part. Beside this dis-
tinguished horde, there will be a fair crowd of Con-
tinental riders, so Australians will have the chance
of seeing practically the whole of the world’s best
cyclists. And if that doesn’t draw Australia, the
national character has wholly changed during the
last week or so.
* * * »
The wholesale spreading of lucre about
Melbourne and Sydney bike tracks (including £ll5O
for the six days’ race in January) causes Arnst to
pause on his oars. He says he’s willing to bestride
the inflated rubbers again, but not on the off-chance
of the prizes alone. The drawing capacity of Dick
and brother Jack in the six days’ event would be
considerable, according to ltichard, and he would
want his price. From which it appears that Dick
regards Richard as a serious business proposition.
The Dunlop Rubber Co. has broken out
in a fresh place. The next caper is a relay despatch
race from Adelaide to Sydney, 1149 miles, in which
motor cyclists will be pitted against foot pedallers.
The motor-cycle section will concede at least 24
hours’ start to the foot whirlers. The cycle division
will be divided into 64 relays, ranging from 10 to
38 miles. Two riders will travel each section, so
that in the event of one breaking down the despatch
will not be delayed. Thus, 128 cyclists will be re-
quired for that part of the job. The motor-cycle
beat will range from 50 to 100 miles in length. The
motor men will also ride in pairs, though, judging
by the vagaries of some motor bikes, four wouldn’t
be too many. It is estimated that there will be
about 20 motor-cycle relays, and the 40 best men
in South Aus., Vic., and N.S.W. will be selected for
the job. Any handicap at all seems a mistake.
What we really want to find out is the relative value
pf foot- and power-driven cycles for long distances.
As it is, before the first motor-cyclist starts, the foot
riders will be right into Victoria, some 360 miles
away. And a little thing like this means that to
catch the cycle men before they reach Sydney, the
motorists will have to average 25 miles per hour.
It is known from past experience that the foot-driveh
bike can maintain an average of 164 miles per hour
for that journey. Under those conditions, the names
of the cyclists are far from being Mud, Slush and
Co.
The motorist’s luck! Lewis Strong,
holder of many records, recently went over an em-
bankment and "was killed through trying to avoid a
farmer’s cart, while travelling at four miles an hour.
The scarred airman who breaks his neck through
falling off a chair is yet to come.
The sporting worm of Maoriland has
turned at last on the Wowser, who has been playing
the part of early bird for years past. So mam-
bites have been tak@n out of him that he began to
fear that he would be swallowed whole .one of these
days. So a National Sports Protection League, with
headquarters in Wellington, has been formed to
chase the Wowser back to his rookery. Two K.C.’s
(Bell and Skerrett) are among the committee ap-
pointed to draft a Constitution.

In one respect, anyhow, Sydney has an ad-
vantage over the Yarra village. The latter
has only a pitiful 20 municipal councils
hashing up the civic government of Greater
Melbourne, and a mere handful of about 240
aldermen. Greater Sydney proudly boasts 42
municipal councils, a few shires, and a glori-
ous host of 500 aldermen. Sydney’s 42 coun-
cils manage to do nothing in particular just
as well as the 20 Melbourne ones. But the
possession of 20 more moth-eaten fur may-
oral robes gives Sydney its present civic
eminence, and leaves Melbourne a mere un-
weeded cabbage garden.
Several small Victorian country town-
ships have taken a step in municipal Social-
ism that has put them ahead of the big sub-
urban districts. Kerang, Rochester, Camper-
down, Terang, Sunbury, Mildura and Kor-
umburra have all established electric supply
stations of their own, and sell light to the
public at 6d. per unit, and power at 4d. per
unit, which is about equal to gas at 5s. per
1000ft. Yet fool councils like those of P’ran
and Haw-haw-thorn still hand over their
rights in public utilities to private com-
panies, which are obviously only in the busi-
ness for what they can make out of it.

The Two-Speed “Speedwell”
w
Motor Cycle
is a machine that fulfils every possible
requirement for the motorist who con-
siders enjoyment to he the great desider
atum. tie looks for reasonable, comfort-
able, but not excessive speed; he wants
power for hill-climbing; he expects a fair
absence of vibration, even running, con-
structional strength, low petrol consump-
tion, and reliability.
Every point is embraced in the Two-speed Speedwell, and we guarantee that the
motor-cyclist will endorse this statement, and find that we have in no manner exagger-
ated the ..sweet-running and satisfaction-giving qualities of this standard Motor-bike.
Price comes last, as it should, for it means less than nothing if it is not accom-
panied by quality. Still, the price is remarkable for such a machine, and points to a
very large turnover, which enables us to accept

No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps

J.G.8.: “Is an engine-driver, or anyone
in receipt of a living-wage, faithful to Labor' prin-
ciples if he mends his own boots?” Can’t say Yes
and can’t say No. Depends on circumstances. For
instance, Is a bootmaker faithful to Labor prin-
ciples if he walks when he might ride in a cab,
there being union cabbies in the town?.... J.C.M.:
(1) Money is anything recognised as a medium of
exchange or a measure of value. (2) The Bank of
England is not “guaranteed by the Imperial Gov-
ernment.” It is a privately-owned concern, with a
capital of about £14,500,000; and in exchange for
managing the public debt it escapes about £200,000
of stamp duty... .Roy M. C.: “Mavourneen” is the
nearest the English tongue could trouble itself to
get to mo (my) mhuifnin (darling) . ..Vishnu : Avoid
them. Salvarsan is dangerous unless administered
by a skilful doctor... .Back-o’-Sunset: This isn’t a
receiving home for the aged.... Pariah: Hood shot
at game that’s hard to bag. But you don t quite
score a hit... Frank: Yes; send claim to Accountant.
....Tom Spargoe: No use sending them if they have
appeared elsewhere C. .1. Greaves: In the 17th
century the Whigs supported the rig its of the
people; the Tories were for the King, rig.it or wrong.
In later times the points of difference changed, but
as Webster remarks: “The Whigs may be loosely
described as the party of change towards democracy,
and the Tories as the party of conservatism.”....
D.D. (Tas.) : Yes; but that truth has been presented
over and over again by skilful writers, and your pen
is very new. Try your hand on a less hackneyed
theme. If you can think out a new plot, or give a
new twist to an old one, you discount your inex-
perience. . ..C.M.H.: Hurriedly corked up again and
thrown overboard.... Armis: The tragedy is well
hammered in, anyhow:—
FAREWELL.
My pulse is beating slower—
Tick ! tick ! tick !
See the candle’s getting lower!
Wick ! wick ! wick !
“Oh, Nurse, do please come here
Quick ! Quick ! Quick !
I feel so very queer
And sick, sick, sick!”
The nurse in time just got his head
Only to find him dead, dead, dead.
.. . .M.R. (V.): Furious enough, but it hasn’t suffi-
cient humor to carry it over the bar...-E.W. (W.A.) :
No value to us. Can’t hold out any hopes, cheques
or refreshments. .. .A.K.8.: Can’t revise your Scotch
for you. Poem is like sodawater with the fizz
omitted... .R.8.R.: No use. .. .Carrigaholt: Marked
it with the fatal X and dropped it into the tomb. . .
D.McI.: You make very heavy weather of it. To
get a rhyme for “dawn” you have written “When
the scowl of Night’s in pawn.”... .Marion F.: Two
lines:—
And while Elfrida on the turret wept
High over all the hordes of Stribbish swept.
Never heard of Stribbish before, but guess he has a
hook-nose. Don’t know what the rest of the poem
is about....J. T. Doc.: No, Doc. To write +he good
old “days of yore” brand of poem it is only neces-
sary to wait until your head feels particularly empty.
The still, fag-end of a long, exhausting summer’s
day is the most suitable time, and it is advisable
to take off your boots. Dip your pen in the ink
and allow it to straggle along almost of its own
accord. The usual result resembles this:—
The moon has risen o’er the hills and filled the
world with light,
Ah ! I am thinking of the Past as I sit here to-night!
I wonder where my boyhood’s friends are scattered
far and wide ?
And where is she who vowed to stay forever at mv
side ?
Old mcm’ries at my heart-strings tug (And drag at
both my legs?)
The dead leaves fall. (And Sussex Street reports a
fall in eggs !)
....Bash FI.: Out of tune.... Snag: Too jagged...
C.H,: Guess not Jack S.: Both fail with a loud
crash M.E.P.: Regret unsuitable... .Mac (M.L.) :
Rather monotonous, and it needs a bagpipe accom-
paniment W.Y.D.: No.... The Hack: Sorry un-
able to use it. MS. posted back.... Traveller: If it
wasn’t true we should get about seven years; and all
you ask us to go on is the say-so of a nigger-lady
whom you presumably couldn’t find again if you
wanted to.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Voldaire: A veteran... .Tarawera: Hopeless for
direct reproduction, and a bit over-done for re-
drawing... .S.T.: Promising work; but subject done
to death.... Spud: That old friend has worn holes
on the track to the basket.
Tanunda, one of the mostly-German
townships in S. Australia, has a “club,”
with a membership of about 500, whose
chief privilege is the right to buy whisky,
beer, or nearly any other old drink you like,
for 2d. a time. \Vith the surplus funds the
club has already built a hall, one of the
finest in the State outside Adelaide. The
success of the concern supplies a hint as
to what would be liable to happen if the
State or the municipalities took over the
liquor-retailing business, and didn’t reduce
the price to 2d. a time.
Why doesn’t the Argus, when discussing
State and Private Enterprise, in tramway
and railway matters especially, take notice
of some such things as this record by H. G.
Wells, in “New Worlds for Old” (1908) :—
Nearly all the British railway companies present
now a similar degenerative process. Years of profit-
sweating, of high dividends, have left them with old
stations, old rolling-stock, old staffs, bad habits, and
diminishing borrowing power. Only a few of these
corporations make any attempt to keep pace with
invention. It is remarkable now, in an epoch of
almost universal progress, how stagnant the British
privately-owned railways are. ... An observant
person cannot fail to be struck—especially if he is
returning from travel upon the State railways of
Switzerland or Germany—by the shabby-looking
porters on so many of our lines, and by the bleak
misery of many of the stations, the universal dirt
that electricity might even now abolish.
A few plain, comparative facts like these are
worth miles of thundering theory.
The shades of Batman and Fawkner will
probably take a trip across the Styx to
watch the arrival of the first of the two
15,000-ton Holt steamers, and see them tie
up in the Yarra. The pair of ogean giants
are to be built with comparatively light
draught, so that, after rolling across the
world, they may kick their way up the shal-
low, hard-worked canal, and dump their
loads of merchandise right on the doorstep
of Melbourne’s fluff and hardware empori-
ums. And away to the west is the fine deep
harbor of Portland, very much the same as
when the Ilentys caught whales there. One
can imagine Melbourne's pioneers looking up
in amazement at the floating mountains, and
wondering why the moderns go to such
trouble to use the old muddy site Batman
purchased, or thought he purchased, from the
Jaga Jaga family for 200 handkerchiefs and
some sundries.

Jankers of Jh£fi Grade- Pianos
THE greatest improvement in piano construction during the past 40 years was brought about by our invention of
a simple, but thoroughly efficient steel tuning system, in place of the wooden system still used in foreign pianos.
This invention is patented throughout the world, and is obtainable only in Beale High-Grade Bianos. its
success is beyond question, as any one of 15,000 buyers of Beale Pianos can tell you. We have used it for the past
nine years in all our pianos, and from the first day that a Beale Piano was issued with the Beale-Vader Patent Steel
Tuning System, right up to the present day, we have never had one single complaint in connection with the timing system.
This record is unique in the history of piano manufacture, for the tuning system has hitherto always been the weakest
part of pianos. The necessity for a steel tuning system is pointed out by Mr. Edgar Brinsmead, of Messrs. John
Brinsmead and Sons,London, makers of the Brinsmead Pianos, who says in his book (“Tlie History of the Pianoforte”)
that the driving of iron pegs into a wooden plank is “a primitive plan” which “neither secures nor retains accuracy”;
and he says the wood “ occasionally ” splits, “ frequently ” loses its holding power, and is “ invariably ” affected by climatic
changes. Yet that “primitive” system is still used by foreign piano makers. Herr Julius Blutliner, of Leipsic, maker
of Blutliner Pianos, publishes methods whereby “the risk of splitting and warping” with the wooden tuning system
may be “ reduced ’’—but not abolished. The British and Colonial Piano Journal says (March, 1911, page 75) that the
“fault” of pianos with the wooden tuning system “ not staying in tune” is “recognised by piano manufacturers all
over the world.”
Hundreds of inventions of metal tuning systems have been patented, but the Beale-Vader system is the only
thoroughly simple and efficient one, overcoming all the difficulties referred to, and other difficulties which we have not
here mentioned. And in addition, the Beale-Vader Patent Steel Tuning system secures a greatly improved quality of tone i
so free from all harsh and metallic qualities, and so mellow and so musical that among singers especially our pianos
are particularly admired for their unequalled suitability for accompanying the human voice.
If you are thinking of buying a piano, you should let us explain the wonderful simplicity and efficiency of the
Beale-Vader Patent Steel Tuning System; and let us show you, or send you, the written opinions of our competitors as to
the necessity for a steel tuning system.
Do this, for it may save you a large sum of money.

Sheriff Schomburgk, in his annual report on. the
gaols of S. Aus., dwells lovingly on an industry
which has been developed in Adelaide. Last year
about 500 gross of straw bottle-envelopes were
turned out, and the Jap goods were almost shooed
off the market. The prisoners not only make the
envelopes, but grow the straw as well.

“C.R.W.”: Recently I visited the S. Aus. ostrich
farm a few miles north of Port Augusta, where
about 1000 birds are kept. I noticed that their
food consisted largely of prickly-pear bush chopped
into small pieces, while aloes, were given to them
for medicine. It struck me that perhaps in “the
prickly-pear country” in Queensland a big ostrich
farm might be started with advantage. The climate
is suitable, and the ostriches might do something
towards eradicating the pest, while money was made
out of their feathers.
While the private shindykit which was going to
take full control of Melbourne’s milk supply, and
the , Milk Suppliers’ Association, which was , going
to co-operate with a like intent, have been ponder-
ing the magnitude of the proposition, a dozen Car-
rum (Vic.) milk-growers have combined to butt
into the business with advantage to themselves and
the consumers. Instead of the Bd. a gallon they
used to get, they now get Is. ; while the consumer
gets for 3|d. a quart what he used to pay sd. for.
They started with one delivery cart, and now have
three, and they were at latest sprinting round per-
suading other cow-bailers to come in and increase
the supply and be independent of the middleman.
Certain energetic Melbourne persons propose to re-
open the long-closed meat-preserving works at Mari-
byrnong (Vic.) as a margarine factory, and they
thoughtfully asked Braybrook Shire Council what
it thought of the notion. The council didn’t seem
j rabidly enthusiastic, but it opined that, as mar-
garine wasn’t a noxious weed or even’ a thistle, it
' couldn’t interfere. In this great butter-growing
country there should be absolutely no demand for
margarine, and probably there won’t be —always
assuming that the goods are offered as margarine.
And that’s where the law might conveniently speak
up, \ insisting that the new substance shall be so:
dealt with that there shall be no possible chance of
its masquerading as butter. With that done, the,
good old law of supply and demand will probably
get in some work.
* * * *
Good old “Custom of the Trade” was made to
feel wretchedly sick for a few minutes at Bendigo
the other day. A firm of produce merchants had
contracted to“ supply chaff to a co-operative society
at £2 12s. 6d. a ton, which was an unpayable price -
as things are; so it tried to balance matters by
making 15cwt. stretch to a score. The shocking part
of the matter was that the society’s manager refused
to regard this as anything less than plain dishonesty ;
and when the Police Court said “Six months with
hard labor,” it looked as though the Law was be-
ginning to take the same sensible view. The Law
and the Profits have, however, been friends for so
long that the former presently weakened and agreed
to suspend sentence on the offender paying £5 costs,
and guaranteeing to behave himself for 12 months.
“liuffin Griffin”: Re the proposed Commission on
cow slavery amongst children (B. 29/6/’ll), I want
a Commission on paper-boy slavery. Recently my
morning paper was not coming as early as usual.
Enquiries elicited that the newsagent had had trouble
with his runners, and actually had to go the rounds
himself. He was quite hurt over it. Further en-
quiries showed that he paid the boys as much ias 3s.‘
a week. The newsagent gets 3d. a dozen, or 6s. 3d.
a week for 50, of which the boys get from 2s. to 35.-
Mv newsagent confessed to having 14 boys earning
money for him at this rate. He said he paid £9OO
for the goodwill of his business, and wanted some-
thing for himself. I don’t know much about com-
merce, but I figure it out that this means that he
gave £9OO for the right to sweat 14 boys.
* * * *
“Geofred”: I found it out by accident, but it
taught me more than I could learn by design. For
two unfurnished rooms; I was paying 17s. 6d. per
week, which was supposed to include 2s. 6d. for the
use of gas —cooking, lighting, ironing, etc. One
morning I could not get my gas-ring to work, and
on investigation discovered a plug of soap under-
neath the rubber-tubing. Hostilities between Mrs.
liooms-to-Let and myself started right there, and I
was not surprised a few evenings later, when I came
home, to find no tea and Mrs. Geofred in tears. Mrs.
R.T.L. had gone out, turned the meter off and taken
the, key. All she had left at home was a note: “Dear
Sir, —i said 2s. 6d. covered use of the gas, not
abuse.” I rushed out to the wood-house, secured the
axe, and turned to attack that gas meter, when the
following quarterly account hanging up in the kit-
chen caught my eye:—
“Mrs. Rooms Vacant.
“llr. to the Gas Co., Ltd.,
“8000 ft. gas at 4s. per 1000 —£1 125.”
Then I figured it that Mrs. Rooms was taking £1
10s. per quarter from me, and the rest of the house-
hold (including the lady herself) was contributing
2s. When it dawned on me, I rushed out and found
an a<vpt. house, big enough to allow me to let
rooms. I haven’t worked since.
THE BIG FAT LIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our income-tax schedules, our land-tax returns all
bear ample testimony to the willingness of wealthy
men to perjure themselves for the sake of gain.—
Daily paper comment.
Instances of rich men (and women) making false
declarations for the purpose of evadin''- Customs
duties are too common to call for particular men-
tion. —Henry George.
Mr. Justice Real (Q.) recently professed a pro-
found disbelief in balance-sheets. — Courier item.
It’s always been no easy thing, right down from
Ananias,
To find a man who’ll tell the truth without a shade
of bias;
We know that Satan goes about a-roaring- like a lion,
And casually begetting tarradiddlers in our Zion;
The world is full of fishing-yarns and balance-sheets
and such
Remains of old romances that would-beat the "very
Dutch—
The Truth that’s mostly down a well is stufl you can-
not buy,
But you cannot beat the Fat Man for a big Fat lie!
lie’ll smuggle diamonds in Ins hat, and swear by all
that’s blue,
No goods that bear a duty does he try' to carry
through ;
Ilis wife, who comes from Paris, with her jewels in
her boot,
Will vow by all that’s holy she has ne’er a cent of
loot;
When income-tax is mooted, he will, calm as calm
can be,
Attest he’s always living on the verge of poverty;
You may talk about Munchausen, but Munchausen’s
all my eye—
He’d never touch the Fat Man for a big Fat lie!
I love my Scott and Dickens, and the fiction that
they wrote;
On A. Dumas and Daudet I romantically dote :
But all the knights romantic that have writ their
fancies down,
Our modern man of dollars does the deepest ‘ kind of
brown ;
He standeth high uplifted on the peaks of Perjury,
And belcheth out his heavings of a mad Mendacity ;
Oh, you’ll learn this awful lesson where the mills of
Mammon ply,
That you cannot beat the Fat Man for a big Fat lie.

MR. DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows: —
I S reater P art °f the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs between the
1 Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest of the sea trips of Aus-
tralasia. The route is dotted With picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange to
southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands, streaming into fine bays and estuaries. The
famous Whitsunday Tassage, between Mackay and Bowen, is extremely picturesque.”
CAIRNS
is picturesquely situated, has a health)’
climate, and the temperature in winter
seldom falls below 50°. First-class
hotel accommodation at Cairns and
Kuranda (Barron Falls) can be
obtained at a reasonable tariff, and the
fishing at Cairns is excellent. A trip
to the Barron Falls and
scenery about that part of North
Queensland should not be missed.

Weak
Digestion.
Hazeldell, Crossover, Gippsland, Vic.
Dear Sirs, —My little daughter was suffering from weak digestion and simply
wasting away. After taking part of a bottle of Angier's there was a marvellous
change, and by the time it was finished she was quite a different child. She is
now able to eat and digest anything. It appears to have quite restored the
digestive organs and she is getting plump and strong, whereas before she was
just a skeleton. You are welcome to use this acknowledgment, as I would be
pleased to be the means of inducing mothers to try it for their delicate children.
(Signed) EMA NEALE-COX.
ANCIER@MULSIO
Angier’s Emulsion soothes and strengthens the digestive organs and greatly
improves digestion, assimilation and nutrition. Pleasant to take and a splendid tonic
and builder, it is unequalled in digestive disorders, lung troubles and wasting diseases,
whether of adults or children. The little ones in particular like it and do splendidly on
it. It makes them eat better, digest better, sleep better, and rapidly gain in weight,
strength and colour. Of Chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

IN BANANA LAND
The Denham Government is going to intro-
duce a Bill raising the age of compulsory
attendance at school from 12 to 14 years—a
change for which teachers have been pleading
for years.
Hitherto, the man who has had the bad
luck to acquire rats in North Queensland
has been dragged hundreds of miles to one
of the South Queensland institutions for
treatment. But that is to be stopped soon,
as a site for a Northern asylum has been se-
lected on the Herberton tableland.
Many Peaks, the place whence Mount
Morgan gets its copper-bearing flux, has
grown faster than any township in Central
Bananaland of late years. When 1909 was
middle-aged there were only four or five
houses in the place; to-day there are about
<)0 people, whose thirst is attended to by
five pubs.
About a year ago, four black bruddeis
were taken from Torrens Creek to Baram-
bah mission station. Three of them by-and-
bye absconded, and now word comes that
they are back in their old haunts, 600
miles away. It was Barambah and piety
i ersus barbarism and ’possum; and Baram-
bah and piety didn’t win.
“Quan”: Some of the subsidised agricul-
tural societies in the cane-growing districts
of Bananaland encourage the growers to ex-
hibit cane, I don’t think. The Wide Bay
and Burnett Association (Maryborough) re-
cently offered a whole £2 in the sugar-cane
section, although 80,000 tons of cane were
cut in the immediate neighborhood last
season; but it had a prize list of £7 in the
poodle section.
R. E. Sexton, the new Deputy Chief En-
gineer of Railways, has been 32 years in the
Bananaland service. He started as a drafts-
man ; later on superintended the building of
the second section of the Charleville-Cunna-
mulla line, the Nerang-Tweed Heads line,
Warwdck-Goondiwindi line, and others of
less importance; and during the last couple
of years has been inspecting engineer in com
nection with the building of new lines.
The Police Offences Bill, which was intro-
duced in the Bananaland Legislative Council
the other day, sweeps up and repeals 25 pre-
vious Acts. Among the things it deals with
are vagrancy, gaming, obscene and indecent
publications, protection of children, preven-
tion of cruelty to animals, preven-
tion of stock stealing, gold dealing, pawn-
broking, second-hand dealing, traffic, motor
vehicles and special constables. A cheerful
circumstance in the gaming section of the
Bill is the proposed wiping out of Patrick
Noses.
Bananaland is trying to get abreast of the
times. Its South and Western railways are
at last, to have footwarmers. And, no
doubt, when they get a bit shabby they will,
like many another thing, be passed up to
Central Queensland.
Brisbane, the Government's gift-horse to the
Royal George, started on his long journey
the other day. They hunted all and sundry
ticks off him, and sent him to Sydney by
mail train in charge of Constable Wilson,
who will thus get a cheap look at the dump-
ing ground of Europe.
Bananaland’s little stream of immigrants
trickles from all the corners of the globe.
Among the latest to arrive are a Pata-
gonian dozen who have taken up some blocks
a couple of hundred miles west of Rock
iiampton. Up to now they have spent most
of their time chasing dingoes.
NOT WHOLLY ABANDONED.
ACTOR FELLOW: “Yes, when I am on the stage I think only of the fart I'm flaying,
and the audience entirely disappears."
OTHER FELLOW : “Oh, cheer up, old man. You've always got the ushers left, you know.”
Tiie 1 lealth-in-Mines Commission, which
said that, so far as it could see, lung disease
wasn’t extra-awful in Bananaland, might
have had a lot more data to go upon. In-
quiry forms were issued to 572 mine mana-
gers, and only 90 replied; to 217 mill and
smelter managers, and 27 replied ; to seven
union secretaries, and five replied ; to 14,039
miners, with 1894 answers; and to ,186 doc-
tors, of whom only 38 had a word to say.
Still, some of the things it saw for itself
were shocking enough. For instance, con-
veniences “are not provided for the men,
either above or below ground, in any of the
collieries visited.” As to Croydon, where
lung trouble seems to be worst, the Commis-
sion probably gets near the truth; the pre-
valence of the trouble may be “due rather to
the decline of the mining industry there dur-
ing late years, and the consequent concentra-
tion of men suffering from physical infirmi-
ties, than to any special occupational condi-
tion at present existing.”
Rockhampton, which was told by the
Sugar Mills Commission that it was dis-
tinctly not the “best sugar lands in the
State,” has decided to tackle the business on
its own account. A co. with a capital of
£20.000 has been formed, and is going to
show the Commission a thing or two.
Eighty acres have been set aside at Yer-
onga as a site for the zoological gardens that
Brisbane is alleged to hanker after. The
Government 'will put its hand in the people s
pocket to the extent of £2OOO to help the
elephant along.
Bananaland’s Railway Commissioner Evans
is dropping some Yankee notions into his
new billet. A couple of persuasive “agents”
are to be cut adrift as drummers, chiefly
among oversea steamship passengers, their
job being to coax travellers into making rail-
way tours into Bananaland.
The curse of poverty! Dr. Eleanor
Bourne, Queensland’s State medical inspec-
tress, finds that nearly 30 per cent, of the
youngsters she examined are growing up de-
fective for want of timely surgery. A corps
of Government surgeons is just as necessary
in a healthy State as a squad of State
school teachers.
Peter Murphy (who represents “the
Trade” in the Legislative Council) is indig-
nant with Denham for proposing to amend
the liquor laws. In the opinion of Council-
lor Murphy, “we should wait until other
countries had settled the liquor question be-
fore we attempted the task” —a beautifully
frank confession that Mr. Murphy thinks
Queensland should be merely the tin tied on
to th'e dog’s tail.
For a long time the Brisbane Courier
has been careful, when any charge against a
Labor representative has been brought on.
to shriek in large type, “Labor M.L.A. in
trouble!” or something of that kind. Re-
cently Cottell, M.L.A., was haled before the
P.M. on a charge of having been found in a
common betting house; but the Courier
even forgot to mention that accused was a
member of Parliament. Cottell’s defence
was quaint. He alleged that he had written
time and again to Premier Kidston and the
Home Department urging them to suppress
betting shops—a clear evidence that he w r as,
in spirit if not in the flesh, an anti-gambler.
He was ruthlessly fined all the same.
The all-consuming Cow is pushing her
way into Bananaland schools. Teachers
have long been expected to cram a 10-hours’
curriculum into a five-hour school day.
Lately, Biblical instruction was stuffed into
the schedule, and now, under Butterman
Denham’s regime, pedagogues are under-
going training courses at Gatton in “agri-
cultural studies,” which means chiefly the
alleged good points of Strawberry, and the
diseases'to which the lady is prone.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The King is dead!” and Consols fell a point;
The Stock Exchange was somewhat out of joint ;
Some hapless speculator met his fate;
A broker, more or less, was fortunate....
“Long live the King!” for since he gained the throne
The market shows a reassuring tone!.... 4
And kings are crowned for this, and coffined ! Fools !
We and our dummy kings! ’Tis Israel rules t
His name of old a synonym for crime,
How lias the creaking whirligig of Time
Brought vengeance to the persecuted Jew !
He holds our honor on his I O U!
His cash-book is our corner-stone of State,
His counting houses to our Courts dictate.
And not from thrones, but from his office stools
Goes forth the fiat —for ’tis Israel rules!
With all the world’s contumely on his head,
Outcast and exiled since the day of dread
That saw the meek Messiah crucified,
“How long, O Lord! How long?” has Israel cried.
Unused to sicklej and unarmed with swords,
Their sordid Ghettoes to the pent-in hordes
Have proven bitter but efficient schools.
For Patience taught there ! So ’tis Israel rules.
Not to the victor always goes the spoil.
When captive Israel did in Egypt toil.
Was Pharaoh fain to pay a grievous fee
! Unto the Chosen for indemnity !
Eye for an eye, a tooth for every tooth —
Such was their law, and is, in very truth.
The pliant patience theirs that ridicules
The wrath of centuries —so Israel rules.
QUEENSLAND.
J.W.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 29, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Our Sub-Excellency Macgregor is not on
the list of the unemployed. So much has
had to be done lately that the family has
taken to dividing itself up to cope with the
rush of “work.” And, just when everything
was running nice and smoothly, his Ex. must
needs be attacked by microbes. A slight
attack of measles, dear. Think of it!
Had it been mumps we might have over-
looked it, but measles! However, there was
nothing for it but to tuck him up and leave
him with the nurse while the Vision, arrayed
in black velvet, sallied forth to the Railway
ball, accompanied by a white-satioed mamiha
and the Scarlett aide. A night or so after-
wards, the same black frock and a bored
expression were taken to the Yacht Club
ball. You must understand that the Yacht
Club ball is quite cornered by The Best,
and the sight of so many with whom
she would like to dance, added not to
the Y T ision’s joy. She dances rarely, the
chieftain, it is said, having objections to
anything but a Miriam fling, or, a Highland
Song of Triumph, and only . then when
daughter is not held in manly tjrms. Reels
and other contortions, so it ist understood,
are in a class apart. However, all the other
people enjoyed themselves —until the morn-
ing, when the yachtsmen woke to the start-
ling knowledge, supplied by a callous woman
reporter to her paper, that “the club's
bargees were suspended from the stage.”
When the police rushed round to cut down
the bodies, nothing was found but a string
of “burgees,” which, as everybody doesn't
know, are small flags.
The Railway ball, on Tuesday, was the
finest mix-up of polished railway material
and pretty frocks and girls that the Cen-
tennial liall has seen. The mayoral Did-
dams (she in graceful grey), and the Com-
missioner and his deputy and their missuses,
helped to keep things running without a
mishap or even a collision. <
Apparently there is a shortage in the sup-
ply of good health in the cold end of the con-
tinent, for the number of Southerners ap-
plying for it up here is steadily increasing.
Among the latest are Grace Mackiehan and
her father, from Melbourne. Last year the
lady penetrated the Spice Islands, and came
back with some interesting reading concern-
ing the ways and doings of Dutch Island
potentates. She has a fancy for out-of-the-
way spots* and a blotting-paper mind which
absorbs impressions.
Possibly success has gone to the head of
the vice-regal lady junior, or perhaps the
energy which is denied outlet in other
directions pushes her on; but certainly
the Vision’s interest in good works
waxes apace. To the much-rehearsed
Society girls who recently tableaued,
she has announced her intention of
going one better than all previous efforts.
This time a kindergarten is to be given a leg-
up.
More dances! The Secretary for Lands
Macartneys gathered the exclusive Govern-
ment House set of revelling youngsters on
Saturday night, and made them happy with
an excellent dancing floor and a similar
kind. of supper. The Vision was amongst
the guests.
Said Governor Macgregor at a late func-
tion : “One of the glories of Queensland is
the provision made for its hospitals.” He
might also have said that one of the disgraces
of Queensland is the chronic cadging tor
hospitals in almost every town in the State;
and he might have added that Brisbane,
prosperous Brisbane, enjoys the proud dis-
tinction of having nearly starved its in-
firmary out of existence several times in the
last few years. -■*
Outback produces fine women, as well as
big men. A man employed on Evesham sta-
tion, near Longreach, was getting'firewood,
when the tree he was cutting down fell on
him, and split his head. He staggered into
the home station, and, as all the men folk
were away at the woolshed, Miss Murphy,
sister of the owner of Eyesham, dressed the
map’s injuries, put him . into , the sta-
tion motor-car, and drove him over-the rough
track to the doctor at Longreach, 63 miles
away. Then, having seen him in the doc-
tor’s hands, she wheeled back to Evesham
again, and didn’t reckon that she "had done
anything out of the way.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The doctor’s bill for the Cairns-Kuranda
line, which was invalided during the last
wet season, is to hand. No. 10 tunnel,
which had the falling sickness, cost £11,223.
and maintenance and repairs for the whole
line from December 1 to date ran to £61,200.
Still, when old John Robb handed over the
line and uncorked a hogshead _of cham-
pagne, they all referred to the job as the
usual permanent undertaking.
The Sugar Workers’ strike, now prevail-
ing, is a tolerably mixed business. In a de-
bate in the Assembly, Philp, with Jiis C.S.R-
eye conveniently fixed on the piece-work
cane-cutters, said he had no sympathy with
strikers who could earn as much as £6 a
week. The strike, however, isn’t for £6 a
week, but only for £1 10s. and found, with
an eight-hours day, instead of the £1 2s. od.
and the 10-hours day, which is the lot: ot
the non-pieceworker at present. I hup
reckons the industry can’t stand the extra
7s. 6d.; but he didn't take time to explain
how the inflated C.S.R. stands the £6 with-
out collapsing.

Nowhere more urgently needed than on the farm!
Wherever you find a successful agriculturist, you will find evidence, in the shape of Artificial
Power, that he has realised the truth of the above.
And on the farms of MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND
of these successful men, the artificial power in use is an “HI. C. " Gasolene Engine.
Astonishing figures, truly ! more especially when they concern an Engine practically unknown
six years ago - but figures that represent Ice Cold Facts.
Their position—a long way in front —is due solely to their Deeds and the good words their
users have for them.
“1.H.C.” Engines have invariably proved their superiority.
They've proved it to their users on the farm and elsewhere.
They've proved it to the entire satisfaction of the judges and spectators alike, in Open Compe-
tition against the world's “next best" Engines, at Aurora, Illinois, at Amiens. France, and twice
at Winnipeg, Canada.
They've proved it in a Non-stop Day-and-Night Ploughing Exhibition held at Werribee, Vic., on
August, 1910, by ploughing 66 acres in 56 hours, at a fuel and lubricant cost of 2/3UI. per acre
To such an extent have they proved it that the International Harvester Company's Factories,
although manufacturing more than One Thousand of them per week, cannot fill the orders of those
to whom “More Power" represents “1.H.C." Engine power.
In Australia, as elsewhere, the position these Engines hold is “right in the front." Last fiscal
year their sales were extraordinary; and to further popularise them, we started this fiscal year, July
Ist, by making considerable reductions in both cash and terms columns of our Jan. 1911 Price List.
In addition to this, we have now determined to put an “1.H.C." Engine within the immediate
reach of any responsible but “can't-afford-it-just-yet" engine buyer who acts promptly.
To do this, we are making an

When “Bully” Hayes was at Strong's
Island, in the Carolines, his vessel was
visited by a party of Yankee missionaries
from the mission ship Morning Star. One
of them was accompanied by a gimlet-eyed
wife, who was snocked at the number of
young Polynesian girls on board the Leo-
nora. “I guess that you ought to be ashamed
to allow sech a state of things,” she drawled.
“Madam,” said “Bully,” with his tongue in
his cheek. “I allow it in the interests or
humanity.” “Haow is thet? Well, you
see, all my officers and all my white
crew have white wives and large
families, and if I shooed off all these
native women the ship’s company , would de-
sert and become beachcombers, and their
poor wives and families would either be de-
pendent upon charity, or bedriven to do
tiungs which I blush to think about.

On the addition of water as directed, it forms an accurately estimated

without fear of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance.
Weaning can therefore proceed gradually with comfort both to mother

A CIGAR is the BEST
SMOKE OF ALL!
But why can’t you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
auft\
ALL over Australasia the only places you can
buy a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities. In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-back districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when theyve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting “fu’ the noo." Any old
Cigar does for that.
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some “back-yarder"—real “Flor de Cabbage"
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them—made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-falutin’ name. (The making of these
Cigars is another story—l’ll tell you about it
another time.)
The storekeeper or tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either.
If he does, he has to add to
the selling price of the Cigar,
the maker's profit, the profit
of the warehouseman he
buys from, the profit of the
traveller who calls and sells
them to him, and his own
profit.
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at 6d.
he’d have to charge gd. for,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the number he would
sell would be sqpii; and
good Cigars havejto be kept
in a uniform temperature,
free from exposure to the
air, or else they'll go off.
Those are just some of
the reasons why you can't
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of AusttaHk,
and also why so very few
Cigars are at present smoked
in the country.
Buy a 100-box of my
" DIADEMAS,” smoke 5 or
6 of them, and, if they’re
not as good as any 6d.
Cigaryou’ve ever smoked,
you needn’t pay a penny.
That’s the way I’m in-
troducing my Cigars into
Australia. ; I know Cigar-
making from A to Z. I know
these DIADEMAS Cigarsof
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest and most luxu-
rious smoke any man could wish for. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so; and the more you
know about a good Cigar the better you’ll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are made from the very
finest, mild, rich, mellow, Java leaf, the filling or
inside heart of the Cigar being all'straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
burn free and draw easily. The Cigar*is 4 inches
long, and the picture at the side is a copy of it,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEMAS Cigar is as good as
any 6d. Cigar, sold in the cities by high-claSs
tobacconists, as I sell it direct to the customer —
saving the cost of wholesalers’, salesmen’s, and
retailers’ profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box
of 100 DIADEMAS, postage paid right to your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of 100
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade. Please add exchange to country and
interstate cheques.

appeal to the careful buyers here.
Out of the 46 cars we have sold since Christmas, 35 of them were Chalmers cars ; out of
these 35 purchasers, 12 were experienced motorists —-men who had previously owned cars. Again,
there were four repeat orders from Chalmers owners.
From Sydney to Narromine. 300 miles, at ari average of 33 miles per hour, and over 20 miles

Carnegie is giving away his fortune for libraries.
Dr. X. La Motte Sage purposes to put the most use-
ful book in all libraries free of charge right into the
homes of the people. For this purpose he has just
donated £5OOO, and a big publishing house is busy
day and night turning out the books for free distri-
bution. The book Dr. Sage wishes to distribute free
of charge is entitled “The Philosophy of Personal
Influence.” It is heartily endorsed by the ablest
business men, ministers, doctors, and lawyers of two
continents. It is beautifully illustrated with the
finest half-tone engravings, and every page is brimful
of intensely interesting and practical information.
It is a book which should be in every home. It is by
far the most remarkable work of the kind that has
ever been written, and it has truly created a sensa-
tion in the book world.
It explains numerous instances in which people
have been secretly and instantaneously controlled by
hypnotic influence. It tells you how to learn to pro-
tect yourself from the use of hypnotic power over
you. It tells you how to learn to develop and use
your magnetic power so as to wield a wonderful in-
fluence over those with whom you come in contact.
Men like Vanderbilt, Morgan, Rockefeller, and
other millionaires have studied the very methods ex-
plained in this book, and have used them in their
business to pile up millions. This book lays bare
secrets in the lives of rich men of which you have
never dreamed. It reveals all the hidden mysteries
of personal magnetism, hypnotism, magnetic healing,
etc., and discloses the real source of power and in-
fluence in every walk of life. It contains secret in-
formation of inestimable value to every person who
wants to succeed in life. Many of the most promi-
nent public men in this country have obtained this
book, and read every line, and they are daily using
its teachings to their own profit and gain.
It explains to you the power by which you may
cure yourself and others of all diseases and bad
habits without the aid of drugs or medicines. It
tells of a secret, instantaneous method by which you
may produce a state of insensibility to pain in any
part of the body, so that the teeth may be extracted
and surgical operations performed without the use
of cocaine, ether, or anaesthetics of any kind.
It tells how to learn to induce sleep in your-
self or others, at any time of the day or night
that you may desire. It tells you of a subtle
by which you can develop your mental facul-
ties, improve your memory, eradicate disagreeable
tempers and habits in children, strengthen your will
power, and rise to a position of prominence in your
community. It will truly make you a leader of men.
If you have not achieved the success to which your
abilities and talents justly entitle you, if you would
like to secure a good paying position, obtain an in-
crease in salary, if you care to rise higher in your
accepted business or calling, if you desire to wield
a greater influence over others, if you care to win
the love or friendship of someone you know, or if
| you long for fame or renown, you should write for
a copy of this remarkable book at once.
The following extracts from a few of the letters
( received from some of the people who have read the
book give an idea of its unusual character and gTeat
value:—
Mrs. Mary Milner, 312 D Street, Pueblo, Colo.,
in a recent letter, says: “I was so sick and worried
I could not eat or sleep. I used the methods on my
self with wonderful success. To-day I am perfectly
well. I would not part with the information you
gave me for any money.”
Mr. T. L. Lindenstruth, 30 East South Street,
Wilkesbarre, Pa., says: “Your work on personal
magnetism is a fortune for anyone starting in life.
It is absolutely sure to bring success.”
A. J. McGinnis, 60 Ohio Street, Allegheny, Pa.,
says: “When I wrote for your book I was laboring
by the day. Now I am managing a business. This
is certainly the best proof that could be offered of
its great value. I advise every man who wishes to
succeed in life to get a copy at once.”
G. S. Lincoln, M.D., 101 Crutchfield Street, Dallas,
Texas, writes: “Your methods of personal influence
are marvellous. I have used them on my patients
with wonderful results. They cure diseases when
medicine and everything else fails.”
S. R. King, M.D., Gillam, Ind., writes: “You have
truly sent me the most remarkable book I have ever
read. By the methods explained in your work, head-
ache, backache, rheumatism, and other diseases of
long standing disappear like magic. Your instruc-
tion in personal magnetism is simply grand. It gave
one a power and an influence over others which I
did not dream it Was possible for the average man to
acquire. Your book is worth more than gold to any-
one starting in life. Its value cannot be estimated.
My only regret is that it was not in my hands when
1 was a young man.”
The New York Institute of Science has undertaken
the free distribution of the book referred to. Big
roller presses are running day and night to supply
the demand, until the £5OOO worth of books are
distributed free. On account of the great expense
incurred in preparing and printing this book only
those are requested to write for free copies who are
specially interested and really truly desire to achieve
great success, obtain more happiness, or in some way
better their condition in life.
Please do not write through mere curiosity, as the
free edition is limited. If you want a book write
to-day, as the copies are going very fast. Never be-
fore in the history of the publishing business hag
there been such a demand for any book as to-day
exists for “The Philosophy of Personal Influence.”
Remember, at the present time it will be sent to

At least sixteen hours each day the brain labours.
With most of us its work is strenuous, wearing away the
tissues at a rapid rate.
This waste must be made ffood.
The brain and nerve centres are delicate and sensitive and
demand their own particular, delicate food.
The most important is phosphate of potash, and nature has
almost hidden this in minute particles in the wheat kernel, up
close to the outer coats of the grain.
GRAPE-NUTS fully cooked food is rich in phosphate of
potash, which combines with albumen to feed the brain and nerve
centres.
Fact! Fact! Fact!
Ten days use will set up a tired brain in a most unmistakable
manner and rebuild it on food, not on a false stimulant.

There’s a reason.

The Harvest
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
summer pageant passes^
I The Harvest-time is here;
The corn waves golden banners,
The V heat r is \ in the ea T- • •
But see, limned on the sky-line ,
With lilt of fife and drum
ind 'flash of bit and sabre,
The grey ltough-Riders came!’
\ happy-hearted people
In low or high emoloy,
Our songs are songs of freedom,
Our heritage is joy ;
’Tis said we have forgotten
Ancestral ties ... I say
The spirit of our fathers
Sits at our hearth to-day 1
'Tis not unmeaning, surely,
That sun-gods’ passion tires
The aureole of glory
Investing city spires;
'Tis then I hear the voices
Of “choirs invisible,”
That honor, worth and wisdom
And sovereignty foretell.
The silver moon-led waters
That lullaby the sands
Of long red-burnished beaches
Spell me with strange demands,
Till an unearthly rapture
Uplifts my soul beyond
The ken of mortal wisdom,
The chafe of earthly bond.
'Tis then by strange enchantment,
Ineffable and sweet, .
I see the Nation’s glory
Resplendent and complete ;
I see with fire-new vision
The twin-lords, Right and Wrong,
Sway multitudes whose passion
Shall live in Art and Song!
The yellow corn is waving,
The grape is big with wine,
The sun-beams kiss the vineyards,
And red, red lips kiss mine;
The day is blue and golden,
The Harvest-time is nigh . . .
The pulses of the Nation
Are beating fever-high !
But, look! limned on the sky-line,
The grey Rough-Riders come
With flash of bit and sabre
And lilt of fife and drum!
Their message is Destruction,
Death forged their gleaming arms. . .
The happy-hearted people
See nothing that alarms !
How shall we portion Pleasure,
How discipline Desire —
With honey-sweet indulgence
Or soul-consuming fire?
I love the happy people,
I love the radiant skies;
The heart that is too niggard
Of pleasure surely dies !
Jn earth and sky when sunrise
Sweeps on in roseate floods,
A thousand joys are bursting
Like sweet September buds ;
The trees gleam green and russet,
The wet pearls gem the sod,
Till color is a passion.
The outward sign of God.
What shall the Harvest render,
What our profusion raise—
A monument of sorrow'
To dark our children’s days?
Re our attainment worthy . . .
When grey Rough-Riders come!
Let every true man follow
The runrnle of the drum !

An Ornament of the Bar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN ungainly man, with feet like a
duck’s, and with trousers feathered
to the knee, like the legs of a
Brahma hen, had been prowling and pecking
among the lunch without qualifying, and
Patrick Mackaboy had refrained from smit-
ing him with a squelched lemon. Some of
the legitimate loungers criticised this as a
dereliction of duty. To them the free lunch
was largely food for amusement, and they
hated to have the best know r n sharpshooter
with squozen fruit miss his opportunities.
“That waster was plainly as empty of
sustenance as a dried husk,” said the bar-
man, “and it is not in me to stall off the
truly ravenous with offensive missiles. I
was an actor myself once.”
Patrick disregarded insolent, derisive and
derogatory comment, and continued smoothly :
“It seems 1 was marker, wood-and-water
Joey, and lighting editor for Scanlan, at his
Peep Inn, Pipeclay, when the Orion Dra-
matic Organisation (sole manager, Angus
Trevor) lost its gay soubrette. The young
lady succumbed to the repeated attacks of
a miner with a 2oz. quartz lode and a habit-
ual 20 quarts load, and so created an opening
in Art for P. Mackaboy. No, Art did not
command me to sit on kitchen tables, kick-
ing short skirts while eating a large apple
with astonishing fidelity to nature. Ihe
nice boy of the co. was promoted to those
giddy heights; the rendering of heavy
fathers, heavy villains, bulky uncles, and
such massive and unwieldy stuff fell to my
little lot, and I rendered them down with
the deadly certainty of a road-roller.
“1 suffered for Art’s sake over a space of
27 days, and then at Dandiloo, which is,
as you know, somewhere between Ipswich,
Queensland, and the Eight Hours monu-
ment, Trevor established illegal connections
with a keg of fermented molasses, locally
fsppwn as scrub rum, and started a unique
collection of lizards, ancient and modern.
Trevor specialised in lizards; he had all
the lacertilia scurrying through his hair,
from the pensive glow-worm ( Anf/uis fratj-
IU«) to the Oft. monitor that swallows a
whole hen, aud they ,occupied so much of
Angus’s valuable time that his company
succumbed to neglect and general inability ;
and presently 1 found myself at the fag end
of a long romp down the I nsolvents’ Track,
with the current completed between the
sore soles of my feet and the great he. rt of
and so short of applied nourishment
that my backbope was pushing the buttons
off my fancy vest,
“Night finds me dossing in a ruined sum-
mer-house adjacent to a somewhat palatial
afiode, as bush abodes go. I had dined
sumptuously off five immature carrots and
half a peck of green peas fresh from the
vipe, and was, feeling as comfortable as a
Central American republic with a revolution
raging ip the interior.
“It was still early evening when I awoke
from my first nap, with an uneasy conscious-
ness of something amiss quite apart from
the reaction of a purely vegetable diet. In-
stinct had not played me false; a rude fel-
low in the garb of a journeyman photo-
grapher was climbing the house wall with
the aid of a down pipe and a grape-vine. He
gave a few deft, scholarly touches to the
window sash, opened the crib, and slipped
in.
“While I was ruminating the situation
and revolving possibilities, a portmanteau
came creeping down the wall. With no in-
centive beyond the horrid prospect of enter-
ing Sydney wearing asphalt pavements next
the skin, and haunting town without a con-
jecturable possibility of overtaking one meal
per diem, I stepped briskly from my latticed
retreat, undid the blind-cord from the port-
manteau, tied it to the handles of my grip—
which contained 14 medium-sized, budding
potatoes, a quart of green peas in the shell,
and various worthless odds and ends of rai-
ment —caught up the goods reasonably sup-
posed to have been stolen, and refreshed my-
self with a long walk.
“It was fully five minutes later when the
qualms of conscience began to play. Funda-
mentally, I am an honest man. I can say
without fear of contradiction, I am as
frightened of being found out as the most
righteous elder in the kirk, and that is the
true basis of consistent upright conduct. I
was weak and as stiff as a steeple after
my impersonation of the walking gent in
Pilgrim’s Progress! Never were two
feet more reluctant to perform their office.
However, the prospect of three years’ hard
and other probable outcomings of the novel
plot in which I was involved urged me on.
“Three miles later that load of iniquity
weighed a ton, and my feet filled me with
Christian sympathy for the bear that is
taught to dance on a hot cauldron. Where
scrub crept in on the track and silence
dominated the scene, I set down my burden
of sin to investigate and appraise. That
settled it. The ’manteau w T as full of silver
tinware of the kind with which sumptuous
ladies love to deck their wash-stands and
dressing-tables, and there was a glittering
entanglement of bangles, chains, rings, ear-
rings, brooches, lockets, and watches worth
a king’s hansom.
“I closed and restrapped that receptacle.
My duty was plain before me. I would
chuck the swag into the scrub, and journey
on, friendless and alone. To attempt busi-
ness dealings with those valuables anywhere
within 1000 miles would mean
’“My wise reflections were never finished.
Something came excitedly out of the night
and hit me, and when I came-to, a large, fat,
anxious man was discovered trying to revive
my drooping spirits, breathing on me a
quantity of breath liberally saturated with
whisky, by the light of a large motor lamp.
“ ‘You’re not hurt, Casterton,’ said the
plump Samaritan.
"‘Ain’t I?’ said I.
“‘Not you,’ said he, ‘the motor wasn’t on
you a second.’
“ ‘I accept your assurance,’ I said faintly.
I was in no mood to argue.
“When I came-to again, we were sitting on
the front seat of the motor. The fat man
was holding me down with his left and
driving with his right, and we were punc-
turing space like a projectile from a 200-ton
gun.
“ ‘Bear up,’ said the large, fat man, ‘we’ll
be able to get a drink in a minute. All you
want is a stiff whisky.’
“‘ls it?’ I said.
“‘Why, of course,’ said he. ‘Don’t be a
damfool. All anybody wants is a stiff
whisky. All I want is a stiff whisky.’
“He pulled up at a wayside pub, with a
jolt that must have precipitated me into the
most exclusive Antarctic circles had I not
been moored to a massive brute who might
have stood for a diagram of the week’s meat
supply of a dense population. The motor-
hog seized and propped me against the
counter of one of those wayside bars, lit with
a smoky, explosive ninepenny lamp, where
the bedraggled barmaiden searches for the
marks of identification on the bottles with a
guttering candle, and a large, black spider
coldly scrutinises and reproves your bad
habits from each corner of the room.
“ ‘Mr. Pope !’ piped the elderly female at-
tendant, with the glad note the trade is wont
to assume when welcoming a prodigal son
with the beans which the swine did not eat.
“ ‘lt’s all right, Mrs. Milling,’ said Fat;
‘don’t faint for joy. Your visions of wealth
are mere illusions this trip. I’m only a pass-
ing incident. I’ve been scooting about in my
car for 40 hours, chasing the Demon Drink
round the country. Now I’m for Sydney,
with my old friend Chudleigh (Chudleigh.
my old friend Mrs. Milling), and Ive
merely dropped in for whisky by the way.
A blessed trinity for me, and a measured
dose for my dear old friend Chalmers.’
“He gulped three whiskies in one, and
hoisted me aboard again. I noticed, with a
pang of remorse, that the portmanteau or
loot was carefully disposed in the back of
the car. . , „ , , ~
“ ‘Of course you re goin to Sydney, said
Pope, letting his motor off the chain once
more, and heating up the atmosphere with
its meteoric velocity. ‘Everybody’s goin
to Sydney. I’m goin’ to Sydney. Once
there we’ll have them broken legs of yours
seen to, and buy you a new eye, Chrisholm.
Then we’ll smear ochre all over that doomed
city. Sydney thinks she’s a sagacious place,
but when Owen Pope arrives she’s just a
huge mug for his special delectation.
Whoop!’ , _ .
"We barked a tree, aq.d took a flying leap
at a bit of a creek. For a moment the pro-
peller whirled in air, while the motor de-
cided between turning a forward somersault
and resuming her flight. Her better judgment
prevailed. ,
“ ‘I live round there,’ said Pope, throwing
one arm back into the streaky film through
which we were being projected ; ‘and tor 4U
hours I’ve been running circles round my
happy home, picking up refreshment en
route Sir, a motor’s a magnificent imple-
ment in the hands of the unhappy married.
It’s tlm great get-away. Wife’s a chronic in-
valid, with 134 complaints. I’m 133 of them.

PEPS ARE INVALUABLE IN THE HOME.
COLDS have a habit of “ running thro’ the
house ” because of the germ origin
of these complaints. The first sufferer
walks into the house and scatters broadcast
countless germs, which are then breathed
in by the rest of the family. Then brother,
sister, father or mother begin to complain
of a cough, and it is a piece of good fortune
if this does not leave behind some more
serious chest weakness. There is no limit to the conse-
quence of a cough or cold, and no wise alternative
remains but to treat the first symptoms promptly
with Peps—the wonderful medicine which is breathed
from pleasant dissolving tablets into the cough-torn
breathing-tubes and lungs.
With a box of Peps always handy, coughs, colds
and influenza are banished from the home and kept
away. Their throats strengthened by Peps, the
children can enjoy the sharp, bracing winter air,
while old folks find in Peps a quick escape from that
old-age winter cough.
A MOTHER’S PRAISE FOR PEPS.
Mrs. H. Dow, of John Street, Rosewood (Q.), says:—“I do not feel safe without
a box of Peps handy, as my experience during the past two winters has convinced
me that they are the best remedy obtainable for the throat and chest. I always give
the children Peps, and whether at bedtime or going to school, a few Peps is their
constant companion in the winter months. I generally give them a few Peps to put
under their pillow at night, in case their coughs should be troublesome enough to
disturb their rest, and one Pep is always sufficient to allay the irritation and enable
them to have a goo 1 night’s sleep.”
Peps are an indis-
pensable remedy for
coughs, colds, bron-
chitis, sore throat,
chills, asthma and
other chest troubles.
Sold by all chemists
and stores at 1/6 and
3/- per box, or direct
from the Peps Pas-
tille Co., 39 Pitt St.,

PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
Mother-in-law’s a mix-up between a Cumber-
land wrestler, a Presbyterian convention, and
a dragon with gastric influenza. When she
gets down to either of her simple elements, I
run for the motor, and so mote it be. Whoop!
Was that a house we passed through, Chom-
ley ? So glad I ran across you, old boy.
Remember, have your broken spine shored
up, and get the best eye in Sydney. I pay.
VVhoop ! It’s a fair thing. Motor in your
neighbor’s eye. Whoop!’
“We had skimmed all the pickets off some-
body’s front fence in an out-and-outer sub-
urb, and uprooted a sleeping policeman, and
the lights of Sydney flickered below us like
fireflies in a marsh.
“Well, we tore into Pitt-street somewhere
on the right side of midnight, and everywhere
Owen Pope was welcomed with the glad yell.
I was Owen Pope’s bosom friend Clinten, and
Collard, and Cresswell, and my semi-de-
tached footwear flip-flapped on grateful pile
carpets, and my shocking trousers and back-
broken coat were reflected in bevelled mir-
rors too numerous to specify. We were
doing the rounds of the polished back bars
and the halls of spice. At first I sought to
hide my shame in the dust-bin, but, after
taking three pints of champagne for it, those
symptoms disappeared, and I discovered that
a man’s a man for a’ that, and it seemed to
me I was actually 33£ per cent, a better man
than any other man living. Which shows
that it doesn’t matter what a gentleman
wears if he’s only drunk enough.
“There were alarums, excursions, pot-
barneys, and cursory entanglements with
the police. During the course of one skir-
mish with a publican and a sinner, the bottle
of soda with which the young lady usually
settled all disputes exploded prematurely.
After that Pope was a victim to delusions.
He strung 4cwt. of bulk beef about my neck
nnd wept.
“ ‘You shaved my life, Carrol,’ he said.
‘Yersherdid! Never forget. Come 'n' live
wishme. Shaved my life, fell ashassin’s
hand. Risked yer own life shave me. Have
ehigar!’
“He took me to his hotel, and half the
police of Sydney seemed to be chasing the
motor before we got there. I hit bed in one
piece, and dear old Owen pulled off my
boots for me. At least he pulled off the
loose soles.
“I awoke in the garish light of 10 o’clock
and was some minutes recovering my
recollection and establishing my identity in
a dormitory of unaccustomed splendor. Owen
Pope occupied and overflowed a bed at the
other end of the room.
“Memory came back with a dull, sicken-
ing thud, and my horrified right eye fell
upon the incriminating portmanteau. It
stood over against the opposite wall, and on
its side was, what I had not noticed before,
a glittering nickel plate, with a name on it
in bold, black letters.
“I slunk out of bed; I sneaked to the
fatal luggage; I glared for one awful mo-
ment at the printed name; and then turned
the name to the wall, and it was off and
away for Patrick Mackaboy. Down stairs
I paused a second to tell the floorwalker I
was going to have a swim, to be measured
for a new gold tooth, and to order medical
comforts for O. Pope; then I proceeded to
nut the greatest space between myself and
that house of call in the shortest time pos-
sible to a man with sore feet in bottomless
boots.
“Cos why?” said the barman after a dra-
matic pause. “The name on that purloined
portmanteau was OWEN POPE!”
EDWARD DYSON.
The First Axiom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CONSTABLE Murphy was a man of
resource. It was he who had ar-
rested Ah Pat at Ivilmore. He made a
brilliant night attack upon the odorous ruin
in which the offending heathen dwelt, and
seized him while asleep upon the cabbages.
Ah Pat, after committal, was sent to vege-
tate in Pentridge until the Sessions were
held in Kilmore; and in due time the intelli-
gent officer who effected the arrest was de-
tailed to bring him back for trial. Daniel
was also told that a new-chum bobby named
Doyle would return with him to take up
relief duty at Kilmore.
Dan met the new man at the depot, and
together they journeyed out to Pentridge.
On the way, Dan explained to his new com-
rade the first axiom of the force —“Shut
mouth, no sound” —and gave him some ad-
vice as to the treatment of prisoners. “Just
moind th’ way Oi’ll dale wid th’ Chow that’s
to come back wid us. O’im doin’ this,
Tim Doyle, bekase ye’re a Clare man like
mesilf.”
At the Stockade, Ah Pat was handed over
with the usual formalities, and Constable
Dan immediately tied his pigtail to Tim
Doyle’s wrist. As they went along, Dan
said: “Give him a bit av a twisht now an’
again, Tim, just to show him he’s in th’
hands av th’ Law.”
When they got to the Wheatsheaf Inn,
near by the Broadmeadows Railway Station,
Dan halted his little party. “Bring in th’
Chow, Tim. We’ve two hours t’ wait.
Here, Mr. Publichouse, give th’ Chow a
drink, an’ see that we don’t die av thirst on
yer hands.”
A stiff nobbier was handed to Ah Pat, and
the new constable showed that he knew how
to treat prisoners by jerking the pigtail so
that all the fiery stuff went down in one
immense gulp. Dan laughed loudly, and re-
marked : “Tim, that was nately , done.
There’s promotion ahead f’r you. Bring
him along now to the bar parlor, and tie th’
divil to the sofy be th’ tail. What’ll
ye have? Do ye play euchre? Ye do!
Good!”
The cards and drinks were brought,
and they settled down happily. When it
occurred to Dan to look at his watch, he
found that more than two hours had flown
and taken the train with them. “Never
moind, we must wait till th’ mornin’. Oi’ll
spin th’ sargint a yarn whin we get to Kil-
more. But Oi can’t go on playin’ with that
damn Chow grinnin’ at me. Bring him out,
and we’ll put him in th’ stable. Come
along, me burrd of Paradise.”
Ah Pat was lugged out and ti<»d by his
convenient pigtail to a post; then his feet
and hands were tied with lengths of rope,
the door was closed, and a large stone rolled
against it. “Go to shlape, ye haythin,”
grunted Dan; “we’ve missed th’ train
through ye. If ye wake up thirsty, whistle
an’ Oi’ll give ye another drink. ‘R.I.P.,’ as
th’ praste says.”
Back the pair went to the parlor, where
they drank and played till they fell asleep
at the table.
Housed by the shout of “Milk-o” 10 min-
utes before the morning train's starting time,
they had a couple of drinks for break-
fast, and proceeded to the stable to collect
the prisoner.
“Now, then, Tim, rowl away th’ stone,
an’ bring him out Holy smoke ! Where is
he? GONE!! Well, there’s no use
lookin’ for a cunnin’ hay then that could get
away like that. No use standin’ here.
We’ll have to get back by this train, any-
how. For the station now, Tim, at the
double !”
By running hard they just managed to get
to the station in time. Together they fell
into a carriage, and flung themselves down.
Then they stared at each other disconsolate-
ly till they got their breath back.
“What are ye goin’ to do about it?”
gasped Tim.
Dan wiped the sweat from his forehead.
“Disremember everythin’ since ye left th’
dippo this mornin’ be the first trainman’
kape silence while Oi think av somethin’.”
Tim Doyle was not happy. His introduc-
tion to duty had commenced by helping to
lose a prisoner, and he looked forward with
dread to the interview with the unknown
sergeant at Kilmore.
At last Constable Dan spoke up. “Now
moind me, Tim. O’im a sort av godfather to
ye in th’ foorce since yesterday, an’ Oi’ve
a right to advise ye. Ye’re breakin’ yer
heart wid th’ fear of th’ sargint whin we get
back widout Ah Pat. Be aisy in yer moind,
for Oi think Oi can fix it.”
When they arrived at Kilmore, Dan did
not lead his brother officer direct to the sta-
tion, but proceeded instead across the rail-
way line towards a large vegetable garden.
A young Chinaman was seen working near
the fence as they drew near. Dan knew he
had arrived in Kilmore only a week before,
and could neither speak nor understand Eng-
lish. He climbed the fence in a leisurely
fashion, and, stepping carefully over a row
of cabbages, seized the unsuspicious toiler.
“Come along with me, ye haythin,” he said
sternly. “There’ll be no more burnin’ fences
for you !”
The owner of the garden, seeing the
struggle from afar, ran down with a long-
handled shovel. “Wha’ for !” he screamed.
“Him my cousin! Him jus’ come! Him
all li’!” .
“Moind now!” roared Dan, gripping his
writhing captive. “Before a witness ye’ve
threatened me loife in the execution of me
jooty wid a long-handled shovel! Look ye,
Tong, Oi’d arrist ye for it this minit only
Oi’ve me hands full wid this divil. Now,
Oi warm you that if ye’re seen in th’ town
or near th’ coorthouse before General Ses-
sions is concluded, Oi’ll have you on a
charge of attimpted murder. Come along
you. Ah Pat!”
The two constables with their new prisoner
soon reached the police station, where Dan
the resourceful formally reported himself
with Ah Pat the second, produced the neces-
sary papers, and introduced the young con-
stable, whom he described as an officer full of
promise.
“Th’ papers are all right,” said the ser-
geant, doubtfully. “But are ye sure that’s
Ah Pat? He looks a lot younger than when
he was here last.” Then, to the bewild-
ered Chinaman: “Here, you! Is your name
Ah Pat?”
The prisoner, who probably thought he
was being welcomed, gazed at Dan, who
grinned amiably and nodded. The pris-
oner did the same.
“All right,” said the sergeant. “He ad-
mits he’s Ah Pat, and he ought to know.
Lock him up.”
“Ah, sargint,” said Dan, a little later,
“it’s wonderful th’ effect th’ Pmtridge air
has on the Chows about here.”
The case was tried next day, and Ah Pat
the Second was awarded six months. After
he had been conducted to the cells, Dan
turned to his pupil and remarked solemnly:
“Now, Tim, ye’ve learnt th’ first axiom f’r
promotion in th’ foorce. Besides, thim
Chows is all cousins, anyway, an’ has flat
noses, glory be t’ God. It’s a great hilp in
idintification.”

The Flower of Sleep.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LAST night there was light on the ocean,
The storm being done,
And color and music and motion
Were blended in one.
The moon silver-splendid was raying
Her glory serene ;
No star, not a planet, gainsaying
Her right as night’s queen.
The beach, like a shield, lying under
The moon was agleam;
All was beauty, a marvel, a wonder,
A trance and a dream.
I said (thinking then of land-roses
And sweet-scented bowers) :
The sea in its blue depths encloses ,
A garden of flowers.
And this, maybe this, is the reason
Men, broken by Care,
Or pierced by the pain of love-treason.
Seek quietude there.
t
Grown tired of the stars in their splendor,
The night and the noon.
The sunset, the dawn, green and tender,
The sun and the moon ;
Heart-sick of to-day and to-morrow,
Of rain and of wind,
Of Joy fleet of foot, and of Sorrow
Fast moving behind,
They ask not the world’s tears or pardon,
But haste to the deep,
To seek in its twilit sea-garden
The pale Flower of Sleep.

Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever. of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that 1 could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me lhany
sovereigns and considerable time —-yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. 1 jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later T
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my he£d
was covered bv a .firm, yet soft, black growth erf hair

as when m my school days. Having arranged W
