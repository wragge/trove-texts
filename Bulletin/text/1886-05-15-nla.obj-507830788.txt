While Ireland is striving to obtain from
the Imperial Parliament the power of
managing her own internal affairs, a similar
effort for a like end is being made by the
Northern districts of Queensland. And, al-
though in the one case it is a peaceable re-
volt from Imperial, and in the other from
colonial, control, the main reasons which
prompt the desire for autonomy are sub-
stantially similar, notwithstanding the fact
that with Ireland racial jealousy and a
national heirloom of hatred add shrillness
and bitterness to the cry for Home Rule. In
either instance the chief grievances alleged
have their rise in the different conditions
and circumstances of the country inhabited
by the dissatisfied minority, who on account
of the fewness of their representatives are
unable to enforce their claims for what they
believe to be justice. Ireland has recently
gained by fortuitous means a large measure
of power in the Councils of Great Britain,
but previously had been, as North Queens-
land now is, practically impotent to direct
or even influence the course of legislation
for the relief of her necessities or the en-
hancement of her prosperity. Nor,
in either case, are the majority of mem-
bers in the central Assembly com-
petent criticsj'of the character or need of
measures dealing with the circumstances of
the distant districts. With regard, therefore,
to enactments peculiarly affecting Ireland
or Tropical Queensland the knowledge has
usually been on one side in the divisions in
the House, and the majority of votes on the
other. This is generally the result when the
same tribunal endeavours to legislate for
two countries or districts which are widely
different in conditions, either natural or arti-
ficial, and which are, consequently, possessed
of separate, or conflicting interests. It is the
appreciation of |his fact which leads to the
adoption of such a policy of decentralisation
in dealing with territorial and municipal
matters, as Mr. Gladstone has provided for
the solution of the Irish question, and pro-
poses also to apply to Scotland and Wales.
In former ages, when the sword was almost
the sole arbiter of political strife, such con-
cessions of Home Rule would have been
deemed equivalent to a renunciation of all
State authority, but a more advanced
conception of the theory and purposes of
Government recognises the fact that the
unity of the State may, under certain cir-
cumstances, be best served by localisation of
municipal legislation.
* * *
The two main causes which may warrant
legislative divorce, are distance, and an
enduring conflict of policies which estranges
the representatives of the minority, making
them permanently opposed to their fellow
legislators. In the latter case the Par-
lament becomes the arena of a per-
petual struggle of the impotent mi-
nority of representatives with their too
numerous antagonists. Nor is it in such
case a conflict of principles, for principles
must necessarily be based upon some recog-
nised and national foundation. Tories and
Radicals may be as far apart as the Poles,
yet the political creeds which guide them
in action spring from a common and
acknowledged fountain. These contending
parties can oppose doctrine to doctrine
without affecting the homogenous character
which is essential to the usefulness of the
Assembly containing them. And single
Tories may be converted to Radical views,
and yet represent their constituencies and
countries. But no such conversion is pos-
eible to a Parnellite. He may profess party
principles and support party measures, but
whatever political creed he may follow, he
must, if he would carry out the wishes of his
constituents, be a Parnellite first, and make
everything else subserve this greater allegi-
ance. He is therefore a mere delegate. Elected
to discuss with others the business of the
Empire, he is forced by the exigencies of
the situation to subordinate the welfare of
the whole Empire to the desire of that small
part of it which he represents. Such an
abuse of the spirit of the Constitution is
fraught with danger to the kingdom. The
Irish party in the House of Commons may
sometimes fortuitously assist the course of
legislation, but such assistance must be the
exception. It is no benefit then to the
kingdom that the quasi-foreigners should

Tasmanian Minister of Lands and Works.
be in the Parliament of England. On the
other hand, Ireland does not desire that they
should be there, and it is reasonably certain
that Home Rule would have been granted
long ago had not England feared that revo-
lution disastrous to English interests, rather
than reform, would have been the conse-
quence of establishing a Parliament in
College Green.
* * *
The North Queensland member is, to a
great extent, in the same anomalous posi-
tion. He is less a unit in the legislative
body, than a delegate sent to strive in a
hopeless struggle with the Southern repre-
sentatives. He is not a councillor for the
whole colony, but a delegate for bis own
portion of it. This is a direct violation of
the spirit of representative Government.
And no method of reconciliation of the op-
posing factions is possible, for the contest
arises out of the exclusive and particular
natural endowments of the two portions of
the colony. No compromise, if even the South
were willing to give way, could effect a
union of policies, and the majority are
naturally determined that their will shall
prevail. So long, therefore, as the present
legislative system prevails in Queensland,
will the delegates of the North be found in
a hopeless minority whenever their desires
are brought into direct conflict with the
policy of the South.
* * ♦
The question of the rights of a minority
intrudes itself here. The Parnellites, as also
the North Queensland members, represent
constituencies, in the aggregate far inferior
to the sum of the other electorates return-
ing members to Parliament. In either case,
the representation is fairly proportionate to
the population of the dissatisfied districts.
Yet it is evident that when the aims of
England and Ireland, or of North and South
Queensland, oome into direct conflict, the
representation of the smaller community is
vox et preterea nihil a mere advocacy
of a question which the opposing party must
decide. Such representation merely puts
the seal of law upon the rule of despotism.
The aims and aspirations of one people are
by constitutional means left to the arbitra-
ment of a people foreign to them in social
conditions as in sentiment. Yet to allow
the Toice of the minority to prevail would
he to subvert natural equity and defeat all
the ends of Government. The solution of
the problem will be found in the peculiar
circumstances of the oases to which it may
be applied, and is grounded on the maxim
that there is “ a remedy for every wrong.”
If the minority have the constitutional
remedy in their own hands, although they
may never be able to use it effectually,
they can have no just ground of com-
plaint. A familiar instance of such a
case is found in the position of the teeto-
tallers of the community. They are ag-
grieved because liquor is manufactured
and sold under State supervision. But they
are not without a remedy. If by the elo-
quence of their advocates and the enticing
rotundity of their apostles, they could per-
suade all men to abjure intoxicants, the
grievance would be removed, for the mino-
rity of to-day would be converted into a
majority, and a lemonade and tea T6fjiiti6 be
introduced. That the remedy has hitherto
been unavailing to remove the grievance is
due to its weakness, not to its non-exist-
ence. But when the opportunity of righting
the wrong rests with those by whom the
wrong is don©, it must be allowed that an
act of oppression is being committed under
the sanction of the Constitution. Such has
been the case with Ireland. No eloquent
advocacy of their claims could enable the
Irish to persuade their masters in the larger
island to become partisans of that cause
which evident interest, national prejudice,
and convictions resulting from these influ-
ences, urged them to vigorously oppose. It
was consideration of their own interests
which induced the great body of English-
men to oppose the concession of Home Rule
in the past, and it is possibly a similar con-
sideration which now seems to have placed
the enfranchisement of Ireland within mea-
surable distance of accomplishment. Had
England a few years ago tried concession
instead of coercion, the Irish would not
have been able to inaugurate the national
strike against landlordism which has done so
much to pave the way for the introduction
of the Gladstone proposals. An act of
national justice would have obviated the
necessity of what is generally regarded in
England as a national sacrifice.
* * *
A similar want of generosity on the part
of a majority has led to the demand made
by Northern Queensland for Territorial
Separation. As we have pointed out, her
complaints are substantially similar to those
of Ireland, in that there is an enduring con-
flict of interests in the Brisbane Parliament,
and the North being represented by a
minority is unable to effect the desired re-
forms. The remedy is in the hands of those
who are foreign in interest and conditions,
and are ignorant of the wants and circum-
stances of the Northern districts. And this
divergence of policy will increase with time
and growth the of the colony. Where there
is legislative oppression now, there will be
constitutional tyranny in the future. One
of the factors of discord undoubtedly will
be the Chinese question, which is an illus-
tration of the opposing views of the North
and South. In the latter region the China-
man is regarded as a harmless and useful
citizen; he will work for low wages, and he
helps to Keep down the price of cabbages.
The South is rather inclined to welcome
him, and would certainly be unwilling to
keep him out altogether. But it is
different in the auriferous North. There
the Mongolian is detested, despised, and
when he and his fellows gather themselves
together in armies he is absolutely feared.
In a few years the North will rise in anger
and say that the leprous Mongolians shall
no longer be allowed to bripg in disease and
take away gold from the land. If the North,


then, is independent of tbe South, there will
be no difficulty in shutting out the Chinese,
but if the colony is united, as now, there will
be a contest begun in anger, and ending in
oppression, that will add to the bitterness
which already rankles through the North.
And this, the Chinese question, is only of a
hundred upon which North and South must
ever differ. It would be far better that
that separation should come now when the
two portions can part in peace than that it
should be postponed to a period when fierce
hatred shall have risen to make the two
sections enemies rather than rivals. The
North has more than twice as many inhabi-
tants as were in the whole of Queensland
when that colony separated from New South
Wales; it has territory sufficient to exercise
all the energies of a local Parliament, and it
has resources enough to give it a very large
share of material prosperity. The two por-
tions of the present colony pursuing by
means of their Parliaments, the policy best
suited to each could ensure much greater
prosperity for their inhabitants than can be
hoped for in the present Assembly whose
work is impeded by the jealousy and
opposition of its two distinct sets of repre-
sentatives.
* * *
The element of distance is also to be con-
sidered in this question. It is a great disad-
vantage to the North to be so far removed
from the centre of administration, that
local wants and conditions are not fairly
understood, but a greater loss is conse-
quent upon the fact that those who would
represent the distant electorates must be
men, if Northern residents, who are rich
enough to give their whole time to Legisla-
tive labours. This necessarily limits the
choice of representatives, and sometimes it
happens that candidates from the South
have to be sent down to represent Northern
constituencies; candidates whose sentiments
are alien to those which animate their con-
stituents ; and candidates whose presence in
the Assembly only assists to bind down
more securely the Strong Man of the North,
that the voracious Vampire of the South
may suck out his very heart’s blood.
Prince and Philosopher.
They are not naturally associated, but were
brought together by a couple of paragraphs in a
Sydney print the other day;—“The Prince [the
Prince of Wales] Is In sore dilemma owing to his
great tendency to obesity; his physicians have
ordered him to abstain from all wines and malt
liquors—to eat nothing but dry toast and the lean
portions of mutton chops. Much sympathy is felt
for His Royal Highness, as he is just now com-
pelled to accept the magnificent hospitalities of
Baron Ferdinand db Rothschild.” This of the
Prince, and just below of the philosopher:—“Pro-
fessor Tyndall is dying of sleeplessness.” No
comment, no sympathy. The philosopher is dying.
Kismet 1 We all must die. But will you, reader,
try to let out the natural mind that is in you in this
matter, to out yourself adrift from prejudice, from
a little habitual reverence, perhaps ? Will you let us
help you with one of these sabre thrusts of Saxon
speech which are useful and pardonable in oases
of emergency 'i This is it. The Prince is in danger
of dying of fat; the philosopher is dying of brains.
Think of it now. Think of all the breeding,
the habit, the labour, which have produced
these conditions. The Prince, poor fellow, can-
not help bis fat. All the strains that meet and
mingle in his blood are more or less corrupt, and
somewhere, like a knot in a varicose vein, you may
find in each one of them a shocking and fearful
example. , , ,
PIiANIAGENBX, TDD6R, STUART, HANOVER,
Coburg, it matters not which. We know how the
last Henry, and the last uncrowned Bdward
(Charles Bdward, the Pretender) died. And a
little study of very recent history intro-
duces us to some notable representatives
of the German strains. To the nasty,
old Landgrave Wilhelm IZ, “ Mushroom Jack,”
as he was called from the huge growth on
his neck—to Prince Alexander (of Coburg),
shockingly ugly, a huge tumour disfiguring his
forehead, with something bestial in the expression
of his face; and suffering, too, from gluttony.
• * *
The ordinary man with such ancestry as this
would claim our profound sympathy, but the
Prince is in a tenfold worse plight. The man
taking a new meaning from the old classic,
Labor omnia vincit, might work out his own sal-
vation, might conquer his own doom by discipline
and self-denial; by the labour of his hands and the
sweat of bis brow be might expel the curse from
his Wood. But the Prince’s princely functions tie
him. Accepting the idolatry of the mob he must
maintain the Indolent dignity of an Idol, and thus
the doom has effect.
* ■ ■
A too great tendency to obesity, it is written.
For centuries the habits of most of the ancestors
of His Royal Highness have tended to the develop-
ment of the organs whose exaggerated size pro-
duce obesity. Liver, pancreas, spleen, viscera, all
unduly strained, and abnormally developed: lungs
and heart crowded, the breathing man sacrificed
to the eating man, and the working man abso-
lutely killed out. These are the tendencies which
the poor Prince has inherited. Ah, indeed—the
poor Prince I It might well be Imagined
that the Master and Doctor Christcj noted
some such tendencies in that rich young
man to whom He gave the advice: “Go, sell all
that thou hast and glva to the poor, and verily
thou shalt have great reward.”
♦ • •
Let us turn to the philosopher. The “ society
paper ” does not say “ poor philosopher.” Society
scarcely troubles Itself to sigh for the poor
philosopher. The philosopher Tyndall is dying
Of Sleeplessness, What does It mean 7 It Is this:
The philosopher has inherited and has developed
brain just as the Prinoe has inherited and de-
veloped stomach. All his ancestors had worked—
and many of them laboriously—with their hands.
His body would naturally form robust, wiry, bard;
but in some mysterious fashion the brain-power
was disproportionate.
* ♦ *
There are mysteries in the way absolutely
unfathomable. There is something’ more than
mere grandiose word-play in Tennyson’s lines:—
“And star and system rolling past
A soul shall draw from out the west
And strike its being into bounds.”
* * *
And the lesser being controlled by the larger half
of being, the brain power, the spiritual side of
the man was constantly tilled, encouraged, fed,
and not in vain. Those who know only a little of
Tyndall know that it was not in vain, but to most
great and glorious ends. If to make plain all the
divinity of nature is to teach Divinity, he taught
more in that way than any bishop ; if to serve
man is to enable man to bring the greater glories
of Nature home to his perceptions, and bind the
arger forces of nature to his will, he was a servant
of a GoD-like strength. He could take little
children and strong men together, and lead them
into at least one court of the Kingdom of
Heaven. Light, water, air, sound, in his hands
became beautiful and comprehensible creatures,
angels and archangels, mighty, orderly, symmetri-
cal, fair, radiant beyond all description. Life
itself became a new thing. With his great illus-
trations of new and old theories of atomic attrac-
tion and orystallzatlons, he breathed new life into
matter, clothed all things with divinity, and took
so much soul-matter into himself that his lesser
self at length revolted against the natural order of
flesh. He could not sleep. He cannot sleep. A
sad and a painful close to the great life—but what
of the waking after the last inevitable sleep ? Ah,
what of the waking? For a death-endingl to
such a life as this seems beneath the belief of th e
thinking and reasoning mind. What of the awaking
of the Philosopher and of the Prince ?
# • m
Just imagine, if you can, the soul of the Prince
choked out by obesity and fatness, a naked, new-
born thing, like the staked soul of Faustinb be-
tween God and the Devil; but poor and meagre
and wretched, with its earth-life of starvation.
And then, the spirit breaking from the cracked
chrysalis of the philosopher, rising in virtue of its
might and right, a servant of flesh no longer, a
prince of the powers of the air. Can you imagine
the two together at the gates of New Jerusalem!
or Asgard, or anywhere out of this poor world ?
It will do you good if you can. You will begin
to understand the essential differences between
prinoe and philosopher; and you will not have
much difficulty if you take one thoughtful look
at the obese prince with some of his prototypes,
and another at the sick philosopher—" dying with
sleeplessness.”
THE CABLED TENNYSONIAN ODE.
“BRITONS, HOLD YOUR OWN.”—TENNYSON.
My faith! you Britons hold your own
Who have grot aught to hold;
The heirs of wealth, with hearts of stone
Cling tightly to their gold
While others hold out empty hands,
Or empty stomachs press.
Although lie fallow half your lands
The wronged get no redress.
Show the starving wretch a bone—
Wealthy Britons, hold your own!
Out ’neath these sunny southern skies
You’d fain ship half your poor,
The starving ones whose angry cries,
Now sound o’er town and moor.
“ Drive out from the old mother’s nest ”
But half her pale, gaunt brood,
The others you can keep at rest
E’en tho’ they want for food.
Heeding neither prayer nor groan,
Titled Britons, hold “ your own.”
Know, here, my Lord, each freeman votes—
This right we mean to keep.
Peers, flag, fleet, throne, and blood-red coats
Are yours—the gauds which heap
The taxes on poor Labour’s back.
Enjoy your day, proud lords:
The moment comes when hunger’s rack
’Gainst you will turn your swords.
Loud in your ears, your death-knell blown;
Plundered Britons, seize your own!
Know, “ ‘ Baron,’ Alfred Vere de Vere,
We want not peers nor throne,
And if your * flag ’ to you is dear
We flags have of our own—
Not dyed, like yours, in seas of blood,
Not soiled in self-sought broils.
No quarrels ours by land or flood
Nor captives in our toils.
* Eorsge for yourselves alone,’
Australians; ever hold your own! ”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Troubles of the "Sydney Daily
Telegraph.”
The position of the Imperial Jingoes of Sydney
has become positively painful, and, worst of all,
there seems to be no immediate prospect of relief.
England is perfectly indifferent to the ravings of
Paton and the cocoa-nut-oil party who would
annex the New Hebrides, and adds to her neglect
in this matter the positive crime of allowing
Germany to annex some of the islands of the
Solomon Group. Whereupon the Sydney D.T.
breaks forth into lamentations, and urges that a
message should be at once sent advising or re-
questing England to do a wholesale steal in the
Pacific. We condole with the Telegraph in her
anguish, especially as we notice that the misery of
the situation has caused mental aberration of so
acute an order that glaring misrepresentations
are assorted as though they were self-evident facts.
Here is a specimen from a recent leader
“From the Australian point of view it is the
duty and interest of Great Britain to secure every
Island now unappropriated In the Pacific; but the
Australian point of view Is not shared by the
Imperial Government.”
How did our temporarily demented contemporary
discover that this was “ the Australian point of
view ” ? Does the refusal on the part of South
Australia to pay anything 1 more for New Guinea,
or the philosophical apathy of all the other colo-
nies concerning Pacific annexation prove it ? Or,
to come to New South Wales, does the defeat of Sir
Henry Pabkes’ motion in the Assembly prove It,
or can it be perceived In the three-men- and-a-dog
meeting at a Sydney suburb, when Abigail, to
whom the defeat of Sir Patrick Jennings on
this question might possibly (joyous thought!)
mean a portfolio, and Bailey, the journalistic
bottle-holder of Sir Henry, and Wilkinson the
Narrow-minded, held forth with a vehemence
necessitated by the poverty of their argument*
and the worthlessness of their cause ? The real
fact is, that the very large majority of colonists
are wise enough to see that their future is in Aus-
tralia, and outside of Orangemen, Presbyterians,
and literary jingoes, the advocates of annexa-
tion are as insignificant in numbers as they
are in influence. The Sydney daily press entirely
misreads the national thought, and judges the
whole population by its Abigails, Wilkinsons,
and— Baileys, But the saddest feature of the
case is revealed by the closing sentence of the
quotation“ The (supposed) Australian point of
view is not shared (whatever that may mean) by
the Imperial Government.” And the Telegraph
can only console itself by sending up a lugubrious
howl, for to say anything nasty about the Impe-
rial authorities would be contrary to that gushing
loyalty which is thrown over readers of that
paper on every possible occasion, concerning
every possible subject, from the motion of Slat-
tery to the call for cheers by Crick. Gently and
compassionately we would advise the King-street
Imperialists to throw the annexation fad over-
board, for it is but dead-weight. There Is no
market for such an article in "this here country.”
*
The Scarlet Coat.
The crystallised stupidity which afflicts military
affairs iu New South Wales is exhibited by every
soldier who is seen in the street with a scarlet
coat. That such a colour should be adopted here
proves the absolute servility of the authorities to
old-world traditions and fashions, a servility so
complete as to hold them in bondage even to the
blunders of England. Any colour would have
been better than the scarlet. Which fact is pro-
bably the reason of its adoption. If at any time
the call to battle were made, the very first thing
necessary would be to fit every man out in grey,
brown, or drab, which would not contrast so
directly as red, with all possible surroundings.
Should an Invasion of this continent occur, the
fighting would probably be chiefly bush-skirmish-
ing, and by ambuscade. With the present suit the
men would be seen even in scrub as far as a field-
piece would carry, and to lie in ambush, unless
behind rocks or hills, would simply be to offer the
enemy a mark for their artillery. The only reason
why the scarlet has been retained in England is
that it attracts men to the ranks, and silly women
to the men who wear it. England every year must
obtain thousands of recruits to be victims to the Im-
perial policy of national robbery, and outrage in
foreign lands, and hundreds of noble loafers
yearly become officers for the sufficient reasons
that it ia“toney,” and that the ladies ‘‘just dote
on the military.” Neither of these advantages
should have any weight here. The army of New
South Wales must be an assembly of brave
patriots, not a horde of hireling assassins
Their battles will be in defence of their own
homes, not in support of a policy of Imperial ag-
gression. Nor is it desirable that men should be
drawn to the ranks by an effeminate love of gor-
geous attire. The man who joins for such a cause
will never be worth his salt when the hour of trial
comes. So long as the authorities rely upon dis-
play to attract recruits, so long will the force be
despised by those whom patriotism would attract
to the practice of arms, did not disgust prevent
their joining an organisation which is ruled by the
combined agencies of pig-headednesa and vanity.
*
Which is it ?
Which is it? “ The most common echo of the
day is that the Globe is perfectly right.” This,
under the head of “Public Opinion,” is from
a daily paper which, stran 0 to say, bears the
name of the Globe. And what is the meaning of
it ? Which Globe ? What Globe ? Who or what
has been sick ? We can’t forget that there are two
globes: “this terrestrial ball,” and the evening
newspaper in question. The larger affair has been
in a sort of middling condition for a good many
years. Has the editor of the smaller concern
made some recent personal inspection, and is this
his modest way of announcing the result ? Or is ho
talking about himself ? Is he Public Opinion, and
as Public Opinion does he mean to say of and for
himself, “I am all right,” or “always all right?”
There is a puzzle about the matter which needs
explaining, and if it can’t be explained there is
evidence of madness which should be looked into-
A bushman tells a yarn of a somewhat similar case
of an old madman called “The Prophet,” who
used to go about with fire-sticks at night, and
when bailed up for a reason replied: “ The globe
Is spinning too fast; I’m righting it.” They let
him pass on that, but a night came when he
knocked out a fellow’s brains with his fire-stick,
because, said he, “ he was In the road of the globe.”
It would be mistaken charity to permit this pro-
phet to meander on till he imagined all the people
In George-street were In the road of the Globe,
whichever it may be, and sailed out with either
the jaw-bone of an ass or an engine-beam to shift
them.

Waste, Not Water.
Such is a fair and reasonable judgment on that
Water Commission for many months past wander-
ing about New South Wales collecting evidence,
publishing volumes of reports, wasting the time
of scores of industrious people, and accomplish-
ing what? What will be done when the last
sitting has been held and the last report is pub-
lished, when the last expense voucher has been
cashed at the Treasury, and the disrated com-
missioners are thinking of all the rosy times they
have had, the pionigs and banquets they have
enjoyed, the pleasure of sitting: In court and com-
pelling: the attendance of witnesses, .the lltti«
hour of authority through which they were sn
much more than themselves ? One result will he
a very considerable addition to the expenses of
the Government printing office ; another will be
* of yarns wit h the standing headline
When I was on the Water Commission,” and*
another and the only one worth a cent (though a
well-informed man would not purchase it at
a cent because it was his own long before the
commission was appointed) we want a water-
conservation and Irrigation engineer. We want
the best man in the world, and it does
not matter whether we pay him two or
twenty thousand pounds a year. We want a man
who in six months can make a flying survey of the
colony for himself and have levels of all main
water courses taken by half-a-dozen survey parties
in the same time—who, consulting with the only
man in the country whose opinion is worth asking
m the matter, Mr. Russell, the astronomer, will
form rational ideas of where and when and how
and in what quantity the water falls and also of
what can be done with it and at what cost. Such a
man appointed on the day that commission was
appointed would have had a report before the
Minister, months ago upon which we could have
gone to the London money market without delay
and without doubt. Our commission will give us
a report with which we can go to the waste paper
basket reserving only our useful clause—” you
had better appoint a competent man.”

Dr. Kelyaack’s “ Pacta.’'
De. Kelynack speaks about Fiji and the effects
of the Gospel teaching there. This is what the
Doctor says:-” The Power of the Bible has
changed Fiji from a wilderness into an Eden, and
from an Eden into a veritable garden of God,
There are 30,000 members of the church in the
islands who give evidence of their religion in
sweeter manners and purer lives, and I believe 95
per cent, of the population attend regularly divine
worship.” Now, this sort of thing forces a well-
informed man to one of two conclusions. Either
the Doctor Is ignorant of the facts, or he wilfully
perverts them. He says the place was made first
an Eden and next a garden of God -and by the
Gospel. And what was the effect of the Colonial
Sugar Company’s operations ? The Doctor means
by Eden the order of Wesleyan civilisation, pro-
bably. How is it that the same order has
not been equally effective in New Britain
New Ireland, and other islands of the Pacific?
Is there anything, Doctor, in the fact that
practical colonisation over-rode evangelical autho-
rity in Fiji? And what an unkind and in-
consistent thing it was of God to send that late
tornado howling through His own garden! Was
He driving the last of the serpents out? But just
listen for a moment now to a planter, a prac-
tical man. who is come from Fiji about two
months:—“ God's own garden I Yes, its a nice
place, but that Devil’s own storm played the mis-
chief with it. Schools—yes; there are plenty of
thatched places used sometimes for schools and
others for drying tobacco, but I never knew a Fiji
boy who could read or write, and, what’s more, I
never want to. And as for going to church, well*
I had 110 boys and they never went to any church
within my know ledge. Did I go myself? Well
not much. Old —— ’s concubines always went
you see, and it didn’t seem respectable.” What
are we to do with the good Doctor after that?
How can we digest his “facts"? Shall we send
the planter away as a son of Belial, and take all
reports of Sugar Companies’ works, terrible
storms, and very common relations of concubin-
age, and cases of cruelty and extortion as inven-
tions of the enemy ? We must do that, or other-
wise we must,—well, say the Doctor’s dithyrambloa
are like Shirley Baker’s Tongan reports, some-
what sportively Inventive and not intended for
criticism.

Who Pays?
It is the Australian Centennial celebration, one of
the things which ought to be—but who ought to
pay ? That is the question. Tney tell us we are
poor. Muddle-headed management, fads of Im-
perialism, public funds sown broadcast in hope of
some small crop of private ends, may have made
us poor—poor as a people. The Treasury chest
empty, our surpluses gone, the necessity of paying
our own debts, and without selling any mere of
the State freehold, staring us in the face. But we
are not all poor. We have got more wealthy men
amongst us than the Republic of Switzerland or
the Kingdom of Belgium, and in the main they are
wealthy because they chanced to find themselves
here. Born here came here, sent here--Devll
cates how they awt here—they are rich because
they are here. The •mtennlal is the anniversary
of the country that made them wealthy—that is
the one important fact, and if the birthday is to
bo kept with any proper pomp and ceremony it
is their proper business to pay. Let the country
call on them to pay, let the State decline to pay.
Wealthy men in other countries have paid. The
taxpayers of America did not contribute one cent,
toward the great Philadelphia show, and even in
sluggish old England, £210,000 has been put up as a
guarantee fund for the Indian and Colonial. Let
Potts Point and all its relatives do the same sort of
thing here, and, if they won’t, lot the time pass,
and with a record that the habitual selfishness of
the wealthy lower orders of New South Wales did
not permit its proper celebration. There is just
about as much reason in spending the revenue of
the country for such work as in the Spanish (and
Macleay River) custom of sending imperial
officers ahead to erect triumphal arches in honour
of an Imperial visit.
A red-faced man met us yesterday in George-
street, Sydney, and abruptly communicated the
intelligence that had last startled him. “Another
embezzlement in Adelaide. A bank. Again, a
bank clerk. Huml” “ Well,” wo said, “what of
that ? It is no more than an Individual case occur-
ring under a general rule. Two propositions are
everlastingly true—all men must die, all banks
must be robbed. To inform me that a particular
branch of a particular bans has been robbed, is
cognate in interest with informing me that a
particular man of a particular family of the
human race has died. Of course. It is only if I know
the particular man, or if I have money in the par-
tloular bank that tho announcement concerns ® OS


All men must die-all banks must be robbed.”
*' But,” he urged, “ we can stop this thieving, we
can stop this embezzlement. What we want is
auditors who will do their duty.” “ Yes, we
Bald, “ but will bank-directors who, by their parsi-
mony, have generated a chronic disposition to
thieving among their clerkly employees, act gener-
ously withauditor employees ? Will there not, In
addition to our race of bank-clerk thieves be de-
veloped a race of bank-auditor thieves ? In time
no doubt, there will be talk of appointing another
elass of bank officials to watch the bank-auditor
thieves, but as sure as that happens there will be a
palpable necessity for appointing another class to
watch these. It is at the clerk end the reformation
should be begun. Human nature is human
nature. Retaliation is sweet. You may rob a man
by forcing him up against the wall and cutting
the pockets out of his trousers. You may also rob
him, when circumstances have run him into a
corner and the social system has imposed on him
certain notions of respectability, by employing
him at Inadequate wages. There is no use in hug-
ging a theory of abstract right. That man feels
he is “ got at,” feels he is robbed, feels that
he who does most of the work is kept
biting his nails over the barest necessaries of
life, while those who do least of it reap
golden profits from his labours. By the Lord
Harry, unless he is a tame sort of a customer, he
will some morning put his arm up to the shoulder
in his employer's wallet and clear to a icalm of
fresh sunrises.” “ I say.” broke in a third party.
” this is the way I would do it. Every place there
is a branch of a bank I would have local directory
I would empower these directors to go over to
the bank every day at 4 o’clock, or whatever the
closing hour might be, and take away all the
money with them; dividing it, you know. I would
pinVfl them wholly responsible. The next day ”
••But where would they be the next day?” we
asked. “ Directors 1" he cried. “Whatl Bank
Directors I Bank Directors! What d’ye mean?’
“ Well,” we said, “ we know some bank
We’d think our deposit as safe with a clerk.
» wh-h-h!” “ We didn’t say we’d think it safe-
only as safe with a clerk.” We each “got”
after this. _
None of the disputants in the New South Wales
divorce controversy appear to favour Lord
Lytion’s theory. The great novelist knew some-
thing of that as of every other question, and em-
bodied his knowledge in a narrative of presumed
facta. In “ The Coming Race ” he deals very
severely with the notion that because a man and
woman like one another for a while they are to be
bound to go on liking one another for ever. He
in effect argues that man’s affections are subject,
and should be subject, to development, just as his
intelligence is, and that to formally stop this de-
velopment is as morally stunting in the former as
m the latter case. He, therefore, arranges for
what we may call matrimonial leases. The man,
who under this dispensation is to flourish under
the cognomen of “an.” will marry a woman,
styled “gy,” for three years, with the right of re-
newing the contract for a similar term when the
time is up. Provision will be made by the State
for children. Those who think Sir Alfred
Stephen away ahead of things will be surprised
by the subtility with which the extreme lengths
Bulwer Lytton goes can be dialectically de-
fended.
Tome of the English magazines are ponderously
and ominously asserting that ‘‘Discontent is
spreading with the spread of education.” Hooray I
The doctrine drilled into the poor by so many
generations of fat-paunched clerics—“ in whatso-
ever state ye be, be ye therewith content,” gave
the said fat-paunched gentlemen a splendid inn-
ings. Who cannot picture the jolly old aboots
and friars who pretended to wear hair shirts and
have their knees corned an inch thick with kneei-
ng at their prayers, sitting round the bloited butt
of ...alvoisie in the dim religious light, tossing off
bumpers to the unspoken beauties of their fancy,
and then reeling upstairs to write soul-stirring
sermons on the loveliness of poverty ? Content-
ment is a beautiful sentiment when you have
all you want, but when you are hungry, ill-fed,
ill-informed, helpless, and the bond-servant of
worthless, idle people, and you manage to get a
little education and see “ how toe trick is done, ’ it
is about time tq be discontented. A man who
doesn’t get discontented when he sees his children
growing up with no prospect before them but to
slave and slave in gangs to add to the already enor-
mous fortunes inherited or got by heartless
nigger-grinding, is not a man at all.

When young Griffith gets out of Pen'ridge he
ought to be sent to England. Griffith is, accord-
ing to a southern the only native-born V ic-
torlan who is at present doing his term for bank
embezzlement. We should make England a pre-
sent of a few of our native-born criminals* It
would be Interesting to watch how they would
come on over there —as interesting as it used to be
to Englishmen to watch the progress of English-
born criminals in Australia. “ Here,” says Henry
Mayhew, the philosopher of the London streets,
“ is a tall, rickety youngster. He is a bank clerk.
Eventually that man will become a defau ter.
Three years’ penal servitude, ticket-of-leave; if no
friends, a billiard-marker, and, if successful, a

ends as a judge I” Our colonial-bred crimina s
have, we are prepared to hold, as good stamina as
English ones. Wny should ve not leaven English
society by the gift of a few prospective judges?
It would fill us with homely leelings as we sailed
up the Mersey or Thames in the future years to
Enow that the Speaker of the House of Commons
and throe or four members of the Privy Council,
with a couple of Law Lords and several judges of
Assize, had taken their first qualifications in a
colonial dock. Until we bring this about, the
natives shall never enjoy a trip to England as the
Englishman enjoys his trip to Australia. Lotus
begin then with Griffith.
Tb n k always interesting question of whisky has
crept into the discussions of the Victorian Presby-
terian Assembly. There are indications that It
will prove to bs a very demon of dissension. A
Rev. Mr. Davidson has had the hardihood to
move the formation of a total abstinence society
In oenneotion with the true church, but the true
church—to its honour be it said—seems loth to
depart from old traditions. One grand old
labourer In the vineyard says he quite approves
of total abstinence, but he finds it “ requisite” to
take a wee drappie before going to bed. This, in
fact, appears to the form of teetotalism which
the Presbyterian Church supports, and if Mr.
Davidson works too zealously in the good cause
we guess he’ll get Into trouble. The brethren
have a clear case of heresy s gainst any meenlster
who shirks that cardinal article of the Presby-
terian faith—whusky. And who shall find fault
with them? In these wishy-washy blue-ribbon
days it is refreshing to meet a body of clergymen
whose bigotry is not entirely prohibitive. Spur-
geon, as is well known, advocates “ smoking to
the glory of God.” We believe in drinking under
similar conditions, and our bottle is always on the
” chimbley-piece ” in the best interests of religion.

A new and remunerative industry has been dis-
covered for the benefit of the London unemployed.
A first batch of 100 men have been sent to Lincoln-
shire to dig, stack, and pack peat at a wage of one
shillicg a day. This means six shillings per week,
aa Sunday is devoted solely to prayer and thanks-
giving. It is only fair to add that the sleeping and
feeding arrangements of the men are conducted
on economic principles by the company which
finds the labour, but how much of the shilling is
retained for bed and board we are unable to say.
That these favoured labourers (for there are hun-
dreds of poor eager wretches waiting to be taken
on) never see the colour of meat— except in the
delicately tinted soup-goes without the saying-
Luxuries, however, are not altogether foreign to
their palates for they get three ounces of jam
every alternate Sunday. Speaking of this truly
liberal enterprise the Christian World gushes
thus-” It is to be hoped that this venture may
find numerous imitations. There is the great
fact (111) that there are four million acres of peat
land in the kingdom, which might be utilised for
giving employment to willing workers-” Think
of it, ye pious howlers at revolutionary doctrines,
who with one breath uphold the sacred rights of
property and with the next breath snuffle that all
men are equal before God I In happy England the
fences and rails of the landed proprietors shut out
human creatures from the golden prospect of
toiling—fair weather and foul—for the munificent
reward of a shilling per day. What can be the
condition of a country wherein the advantages of
such a pitiful industry for “ willing workers ” are
earnestly pleaded by its Christian World 1

Persons with a faculty for seeing ahead will
not be surprised when North Queensland,
after detachment from the parent colony, steps
Into the front place as the Democracy of the
The circumstances surrounding her birth are un.
like those in which the other Australian colonies
were cradled. She will learn by heart the lessons
taught by the humiliations and abasements of he r
neighbours. It is not long ago since the Northern
Miner, a much more accurate representative of
feeling in the North than any Sydney daily is of
feeling in N.8.W., pointed out that it would be
the business of the new colony to at once assume
the right of appointing its own Governor. This is
no isolated notion. It is a purpose distilled from a
common sentiment. The sentiment was created
by the spectacle of officials sent elsewhere and the
spectacular salaries and allowances secured for
them. But the nascent colony shews other signs of
marching to a front place in the democratic ranks.
Almost every voice it raises echoes scorn for effete
humbug and denunciation of gilded guilt. Here
is the Cooktown Independent of the other day
“ We can fervently sing ‘ God Save the Queen
without praying for the preservation of her ex-
pensive retinue of German pensioners who are
sucking out the life-blood of England’s working
millions. In the present state of affairs in the dear
old land, the two most saddening documents
which any intelligent man can peruse are the list
of royal grants and privileges, and the pension,
list, where men, some of them the greatest boobies
whom God ever created, drain fortunes from the
Treasury because their ancestresses were accom-
modating to the sensual sybarite Charles the
Second, or nursed the gouty feet of that garlicky
boor, George the First.” An infant colony fed on
pap like this will never give standing room to the
flunkeys, sycophants, national tricksters, and
national humbugs who have made the other colo-
nies of the Austral group dense with bunkum
loyalty.

Nothing in Sydney is so liable to send visitors
away with a fixed idea of its Intrinsic littleness as
the minuteness with which certain of the city
papers describe the casualties of the day. Here is
a transcript from a single issue of an evening
paper published while the town was full of
strangers last week:-This morning Christina
Basv, 35, married, 73 Alblon-street, Surry Hills,
received a wound on the thumb from an axe.’
No doubt Christina has laid by a copy of that
paper for the information of those who will come
after her, and a similar end is likely achieved in
each of the following oases filed In cold steel
“Annie Fletcher, of Redfern, got a needle in her
finger; George Williams, out his eyebrow in a
fight; Jambs Johns, Alexandria, jammed his
thumb; Adam Jones. 17 Maodonaldtown, bruised
toe, by piece of timber falling It.” But the journa-
list who can sit down and let these things and
their like trickle through him from day to day
must embody the maxim-pami parvum decent •
It is not the journalist, but the effect of his jour-
nalism that is of consequence. This sort of thing
makes metropolitan journalism ridiculous, and the
grand and glorious city of Sydney a one-horse
affair. Two years ago a colonial cricketer who
went with a team to London sent to a friend in
Melbourne a characteristic letter, which came
under our eyes. He said there were no such papers
in London as the Melbourne Herald and Sydney
Evening News. These latter were his ideals of
enterprise. “Why,” he went on, “when one of
our fellows went to the London Echo and wanted
a little bit put in about how stiff Qubbins felt in
the knees until he was rubbed with hartshorn and
whisky, the whole office laughed, and told him to
go and hang Qubbins over a clothes-line. Now,”
concluded the correspondent, "them’s just the
things the Heb ald and News snap at, and them,
as I am prepared to tell the editor of the Times if
I meet him, is what makes a truly great and influ-
ential jernll.” Still, despite such worshippers as
our cricketing friend, the soul of such small am-
bitions is paltry.
To Daniel O’Connor.

Wearer av the Victoria Cross av Public Loife.
Daniel, we had hoped that —to attempt a faint
mitation of your own gorgeous manner—your
name would reverbemte down the rolling ages,
become the favourite theme of future historians
and poets, and be like rum-and-mllk in all men’s
mouths for ever. W® had hoped, and believed*
that earth had no other like you. We looked upon
you as an orator sole and supreme. Where, said
we in the pride of our hearts, can there be found
an orator with such magnificence of metaphor,
such luxuriance of epithet, such glorious lyrical
incoherenoy of diction —and with so much of it?
And we answered ourselves with fearless confl*
denoe—Nowhere! But we are crushed even unto
the dust. We are cast down grievously, and sack-
cloth is our wear, and ashes our bed for ever.
Daniel, you have disappointed us sorely. A little
while ago and your name might have stood against
the universe. Now there is none so poor as to do
it honour. Daniel, you are def eated, demolished,
wiped out utterly—and by a niaaer! It outs
us to the heart to say it, but the truth

quence of this woolly-headed phrase-builder,
yours has not a leg to stagger upon. He
beats you at every point. He can tie his tongue
in three knots and then talk you Into a tottering
dummy In five minutes. He knows more about
Demosthenes than you do. He is better acquainted
with Cicero. He can run rings round you in the
matter of references to the ancient Greeks and
Homans. And more than all that, he can lash up
more enthusiasm over the wrongs of Oireland
while an unprejudiced party would count five
hundred, than you could if you were to talk on
the subject till you were black in the face. And
he is only a thick-lipped, bullet-headed, pug-nosed,
nigger I Oh, Daniel litis a cruel blow to us. But
let us be just. Let not the prejudices of race
stand between us and the truth. Head the follow-
ing extracts from the speech of a negro minister
in America, and own up like a man that you are
knocked over the ropes for ever. The reverend
nigger begins by a panegyric on Irish statesmen (
concluding with this noble burst—which, Daniel,

again:— ‘‘Rome is dead, Greece Is paralysed; but
the mental powers and moral energies of Ireland
are eternal. Africa, arousing from her sleep of
20 centuries, demands the reason for the wrongs
visited upon that island.” Think of that, Daniel!
Africa demands the reason. And one of Africa’s
sons gives voice to it. How long would you have
been, Daniel, before you would have thought of
invoking the aid of that potent ally ? You never
knew that Africa was waiting in calm but implac-
able patience to strike the chains from the limbs
of your down-trodden country. Listen to
this, too:-“As the setting sun flashes back
that gorgeous effulgence which metamorphoses
the dragon drapery of the western heavens
into glowing scenes of variegated grandeur
-eventide’s herald of a splendid morning-
so Ireland illumined the world with the hope
of a revival of letters at a period pregnant with
elements of their destruction, and long before the
star of Bnsrland flamed in the firmament of
nations ” What do you think of that, Daniel ? Is
it high ? Is it gorgeous ? Does it not knock your
“ Dimmasthinio lllaquince” into a thousand
cooked- hats. It is our impression that it does, and
very completely. But what do you think of this
fur a peroration “ Let a monument be built
broad-based as the universe. Encircle its gorgeous

A CHAT WITH CHARLES BRAD-
LAUGH, M.P.
(B Y THE BULLETIN'S AGENT-GENERALIN LONDON)
It was my highly esteemed privilege to
spend the greater portion of an hour with Charles
Bradlaugh this morning. A very few years ago
had anyone prophesied that I should have such
an experience, I should have laid an information
against him as a person of unsound mind. In
those days, which, to be frank, were the days of
my youth, the word Bradlaugh conveyed to me
something not clearly definable, but truly terrible.
The name 1 believed to be in some way synony-
mous with the words Infidel, Atheist, and Devil.
With the last of these—the invisible person with
a tail, who insinuated himself into the interiors of
Utile boys, and dragged them towards the cup-
board or pantry when the maternal eye wandered
—I was, of course, on familiar terms. Infidels and
atheists were, to my understanding, simply very
bad persons who, on Sunday evenings, lectured to
equally bad persons in the theatres—dens of
Iniquity at any time. A little later the name
Bradlaugh was associated in my mind with a
small well-worn pamphlet passed from hand to
hand at school, and eagerly devoured in dark cor-
ners and behind fences, the delirious fear of being
pounced upon by someone having authority, and
inordinately whopped or “kept in,” adding
piquancy to the interest derived from the perusal
m •» »
Until quite recently my knowledge of
Charles Bradlaugh had not grown very much, with
the exception that through the illustrated papers
I became familiar with what purported to be
his features, and gained the impression that he
was an intensely ugly man, with an undue share
of upper lip, a square hard mouth, and a oeren-
nial frown about his eyes and forehead. When I
stood before the man himself, another of my
cherished illusions vanished. So far from being
ugly, I found him positively good-looklag. The
lip has, of course, been greatly exaggerated.
Long? Well, yes; it’s a long lip right enough;
out quite short when he smiles—which he does
often —and it covers white, sound teeth. His eyes
are mild, pleasant to look into, and, full of that
sanguinity and constancy of purpose which have
carried him forward in his remarkable career over
difficulties, and through opposition such as it has
been the lot of few public men to encounter. He
has a big forehead, smooth and unwrinkled, not-
withstanding his 53 years and his troubles. In
brief, his face is strong and tnoughtful, but at the
same time pleasant-tempered and generous.
Whatever your opinions or prejudices may be,
my friends, one thing is certain—you would like
the man.
♦ * *
I first called upon Mr. Bradlaugh at his
residence over the niano-shop in Circus-road, St.
John’s Wood, at 9.30 a few mornings since. The
interviewer requires—ahem I—some little-er-deci-
sion of character-er-fertility of resource, er-and-
er-general self-reliance. These qualities I own to
in a modified degree, and to tneir assistance 1
bring some small experience and a moderate
knowledge of men and things. [We don’t want
an article on you, but on Bradlaugh. Stick to the
“ man,” never mind the “ things.”—Bp. B.] I beg
your pardon. I'm coming to my friend, Brad-
laugh, now, straight away. As I was saying when
you interrupted me,—in consequence of the pos-
session of certain qualities I arrived at the deter-
mination to call upon Mr. Bradlaugh at about his
breakfast hour when he would be more likely to
extend a little amiability towards me than later
when the cares and worries of the day had begun.
By the servant who answered my bang at the door
I sent up my card, and in about two minutes was
requested to follow it. I was shown into a large
room containing three persons, all hard at work,—
Bradlaugh and his two secretaries—one of them a
lady, I think his second daughter. I was rather
surprised when Mr. Bradlaugh took possession or
my hand and shook it cordially.
‘What can Ido for you, Mr. Original? he asked,
cheerfully. .. , . . ,
« Well, the fact is,” I stammered, overcome by
the warmth of my reception, and anticipating a
violent change in the temperature when I an-
nounced the object of my visit, “The fact is, Mr.
Bradlaugh, that, as the London correspondent of
the Sydney Bulletin—the most popular, influen-
tial —”
“ Yes, I noticed the paper named on your card,
he interrupted, (I had forgotten in the excitement
that it was named,) “I know it very well. A copy
is sent me occasionally, and I could do with it
oftener.” , ... . . ,
He has a most mellifluous voice, with a quick de-
cisive manner of speaking. I judged hint to be a
man who has never willingly wasted an hour in
his life, and accordingly I determined not to waste
any of his moments.
“ Can you spare me (say) 10 minutes ?
“Not this morning, I’m afraid. Im terribly
busy, and In a bad temper. Come on Thursday
morning, two hours later, and you shall have half-
an-hour.” , . .
This morning I was punctual to the minute. As
I passed into the large room before mentioned a
lady in a severely plain gown and screw curls
passed out. It was Mrs. Besant.
“ Now, Mr. Original,” said the junior member
for Northampton, “ tell me what you would like
to know. I presume you’re going to write about
me in your paper.” ~ ~ . ...
“ I should like to know if all the trouble, with
reference to your taking your seat in the Com-
m“ Well.nofi’m afraid it is not, but I hope It will
be shortly. There is my appeal to the Lords still
to be heard. That is in reference to the three
verdicts I had against me—each inflicting a penalty
of £5OO -for voting in the House on the 11th
February, ’Bl. That appeal, if it comes off, I be-
lieve I shall win: but I am trying to persuade
the Government to an agreement which would
stop all actions between us. What I have
been fearing most is that I shall be made a bank-
rupt. That would disqualify me from sitting, of
course. To pay all my fines and penalties I should
require about a million sterling. I’m trying par-
ticularly hard to get rid of that last of the
Mohicans—the appeal to the Lords, for several
reasons. I sadly need rest, and I'm very anxious
to visit Australia.” ...... „ T
“You would And plenty of friends there, 1
remarked.
“ 1 believe I would. Judging from your paper,
which has supported me so strongly all along, I
should expect to find hosts of sympathisers in the
colonies. My mind has been thoroughly made up
to the visit for some time. I should go at once
but for two things which stop the way—the ap-
pe 1 I spoke of that looms ahead, and the ciouol-

“I feel sure of it. The political hat will be
shaken up and we shall see some strange things.
I could not be away from Kngland at such a time.
But if the present House lasts, I may go in the re-
cess” , . „„

“I should be obliged to You sea I have no
money. I should do no more than sufficient to

“Oa what subjects would you be likely to lec-

toric questions ”
“ You are a Republican, are you not ?
“Yes; a red one,” . . .
“Would you air your republicanism in Austra-
lia ? ”
“ I should be guided by a number of considera-
tions. Australia must one day become a republic
or a number of republics, but it is not my mission
to bring that desirable state of things about. The
matter will arrange itself naturally in time
“Freethoughthasalarge following in Austra-
lia,” I remarked, "so that your welcome is posi-
tivfilv assured/*
“ Don’t imagine that I should lecture on Free-
thought,” said Mr. Bradlaugh quickly, • it s a
hundred to one that I should not. I used to think
that if a thing was true it should be shouted from
the housetops My opinion is somewhat changed
now. What is the use of upsetting people ? Let
them keep their faith if they have any, and if it
makes them happy. Freethought means toler-

“It is very possible; but they would not stay
In long. For mv part, I should bo delighted to sit
in opposition for six months 1 have some creditors
among the Conservative party, Mr. Original, and I
mean to pay them.” ......
This was the first time during our interview that
Mr. Bradlaugh lost the perennial-expression of
benignity from his face. There was a nasty (dwell
nasally on the first syllable of the adjective to get
the idea) ring in his voice as he mtered the last
six words. 1 decided that it was time to go. So I
went. Not. however, before Mr. Bradlaugh had
courteously offered to send me a ticket tor the
Speaker’s gallery to hear the first big speech he
will make. I mean to go, too—if I canlcer-
tain that no Australian member will speak on the
same occasion.

At Coonabarabran, N.S.W., Mr. A refused to

A policy in the Legal and General Life
Assurance Company upon the Queen’s life was
recently offered for sale by auction in London.
It was taken out 10 years ago for £l3OO, since
which time £399 in bonuses had been added.
Although the Queen is now in her 67th year, no bid,
significantly enough, was made for the investment.
It would be interesting to know who took out
that policy, how the medical inspection was
effected, or whether the usual doctor’s
was dispensed with.

From Victoria comes
news of the death of
Miss Marion Melrose (Mrs.
H. W. Emmett), at the
age of 24. Truly as

deceased lady was a
bright and clever young
actress, but unfortu-
nately lacked proper
mental control.
David Buchanan
has sailed for Europe.

men of Australian or-

Australia, and will—this
will be sad news to Vic-

Melbourne. He has been
credibly informed that he
could easily become
leader of the criminal
bar in Melbourne, and
make another fortune
there. J. L. Purves, the
champion slang-whanger,

laurels.
The present Premier
of Victoria—D uno a n
Gillies—is not particu-
larly famous for the pos-
session of a brilliant wit,
but at times he can say
things that make a near
approach to the humor-
ous. Some short time
ago he was interviewed
by the commissioners of
the Melbourne hospital,
who wanted to Induce
him to make an increase
to the annual Govern-
ment grant. He was very
cold upon the subject,
and said, among other
things, that there was a
lot of extravagance car-
ried on in the hospital.
Some medical men, he
said, ordered champagne
to be given to the patients
on the slightest occasion.
One of the commis-
sioners then replied that
he, personally, objected
to champagne, and told
the doctor so, hut was in-
formed that “it was
necessary in certain oases,
and that it was advan-
tageous to cure a man
quickly and get him out
of the hospital.” On bear-
ing this the Premier
smiled a thin, cynical
smile, and scored his
point thus:—“You will
never get a man out In
that way. He will re-
main there till he dies If
he gets that sort of
thing.” There may not
be much wit, but there is
a deuced deal of know-
ledge of human nature
contained in this remark.

323 years since Sir Richard Grosvenor was created
Baron Grosvenor of Eaton, and now the Grosvenors

We should like to know what they will hold in
another 50 years—perhaps their hacs out for half-
pence. The noble house of Henniker Paste-Pot
Heaton will probably hold the Grosvenor dukedom
by then. What a burlesque world it is!

too late. When a Victorian M.P. was thought to be
approaching his end, the committee of a coming
man approached the bedside and tried their level
best to obtain his signature to a requisition nomi-
nating a man whom he had always opposed. The
dying man got into such a rage that he recovered
and kept the requisition and has retained his seat
to this day. If the Fortitude Valley men had only
done this, poor Beattie might have been alive and

It is time that Beakdom possessed a little
cerebral tissue. Whv shouldn’t magistrates, paid
and honorary, bear the cost of all successful ap-
peals aaalnst decisions in which they have dis-
played owlish incapacity, or ignorance, or sordid
bigotry? A Broadwater correspondent, in putting
the foregoing question, brings under our notice a
case in which, he states, a person named Carter,
dismissed by one bench of magistrates before
whom he was charged with false pretences, was
afterwards taken before another bench, on exactly
the same evidence and committed for trial. The
affair was brought under the notice of the Minis-
ter of Justice, and, as a consequence, Carter was
(without trial) summarily turned out of the lock-
up in ichich he had been imprisoned for six weeks I
Yet he could get no redress. Again, a defendant
was fined 20s. for “ obscene language ’’—which,
according to the evidence, consisted merely of the
forcible, but in nowise obscene, asseveration that
the other fellow was a crimson-coloured coward I
Our correspondent cites other flagrant cases of a
similar character, and enquires whether the
authorities have in view any scheme for the re-
formation of the present iniquitous N.S.W. magis-
terial system.

entering Into the marriage contract. Her father
brought her with him to the gentleman concerned,
sent for a qualified parson and witnesses, and
stood by with a six-chambered revolver in his
pocket—the happy bridegroom knew it was
there—till the ceremony whs completed. It may of
course be said that marriage in such a state of
physical terror can be annulled. No doubt. But that
would not prevent an apparition of the girl's father,
and there was no mistake about the way he
handled the loaded weapon. Men are often con-
stitutionally cowards. Such Lotharios take shelter
behind law and custom. When they marry they
don’t marry for love, anyway. Pear is as noble a
motive as any they are acquainted with. When
then the shelter of law and social custom is torn
away and they find themselves face to face with
the embodiment of a new principle, they are very
likely to accommodate themselves to its behests
and live ever after a higher life than otherwise
they would have done. It will be bad for the best
interests of law and custom when it can be counted
upon with absolute certainty that there are no
wild barbaric spirits left in society.
The wail is, still they come. Here comes
on this bright Austral morn as ever were a new
poet stolen from his cobwebbed lair, and spying
out a goodly column where he might, perchance,
be let to have his “tear,” pounced on the Sydney
Mail, and through his glossy hair he passed his
rhyme-itched fingers passing fair, and sighed, “by
Jove! I will, I’ll print it there.” And so Nelson
P. Whitelocke hauled his roll of MSS. upstairs, and
they printed his ode to “Solitude,” and it we
judge aright Solitude will prove an audience fit
though deoidedlyfew—
"... Hence, frail, degenerate man ”
he chips off, and we begin to hence at once about
60 lines down to—
“ And here might Niobe for her offspring weep,
Mourning for vitality’s lost thread.”
Leaving Miss Niobe for her threadless needle, we
follow the banner of Nelson P. until he calls up
Kendall to tell him not to mind about the £135
memorial business, for that he (Nelson P. W.) was
coming down on the waves of poesy with the
signal flying “ Nelson expects that every bard this
day will do his duty ”
“ And Kendall, thou, our own dear native bard,
By cold misfortune from reward debarr’d—
To thee a feebler poet tunes his song;
And prophesies atonement for thy wrong.”
The only thing we are dubious about is Nelson’s
allusion to himself as a feebler bard than Kendall,
for we can read Kendall, but Nelson is altogether
too strong for us. He winds up
“ Hail, Solitude, hail I I love thy peaceful shore,
And if within that spot there breathes an earnest
child,
To him I dedicate my song the undefll’d,”
We counsel our bard to roll up his swag and start
off for Solitude at once.
The fate of G. J. Graham awakens many
warm memories among Queenslanders. Although
he had as much to do with N.S.W. as with Queens-
land, still he was but a private member of the
community in the former, while he held public
and representative positions in the latter. When
he went up to Clermont, the centre of the copper
Industry in the northern colony, he had not much
cash and was the possessor of a delicate constitu-
tion and little experience. He had fallen out of
the bottom of a pastoral speculation and had very
small conception as to where to begin to climb.
Buzaeott, now third owner of the Courier and its
accompaniments, was then quitting Clermont,
where he had been fighting the squatters, to take
charge of the Rockhampton Bulletin, in which
he was to serve them, and the little paper on
the mining field was given over to Graham to
edit. Graham is an instance of a man who suc-
ceeded as editor without ever having been a
writer of even a two-inch par- in any paper. He
was a splendid Latin and Greek scholar, and he
used to give the miners as much knowledge about
Marathon and Thermopylie as ever they liked.
It was not long before a Parliamentary vacancy
arose, and his admiring readers wisely judged that
he would make an excellent member. He went
straight into the House. The State Education Act
was then the burning question, and Mr. Graham
made the one great speech of his life. At the time
of its delivery, and since, no one dared say whether
it was in favour of or against the measure. But
Palmer and Walsh and several others always
took their hats olf and rubbed their foreheads
when they met him after. Griffith and Palmer,
although foes, put their heads together and deter-
mined they would never let him deliver another
speech. They offered him the under-secretaryship
of the newly-created Department of Public In-
struction. Mr. Graham accordingly settled down
with £BOO and let politics and journalism go. After
a while he left the office and came down to Orange
(N.S.W.) to take share in a brewery. When the
under-secretaryship in the Education Office in
Sydney was lately vacant Mr. Graham was a can-
didate, but an unsuccessful one. The most notable
of his public achievements was that speech in the
Brisbane House. Now, however, he is dead—and
dead, too, away in Albany—and it can be said with
absolute truth that though a man easily set up as
a target for quiet jokes, he was the very soul of
sensitive honour.
It is cabled that when Julian Thomas,
“ The Vagabond,” was last seen in London he was
investigating a mug of porter and some bread and
cheese prior to going up to Gad’s Hill and writing
27 columns for the Argus on personal reminis-
cences of Shakespeare, Falstalf.and Charles Dickens
—people with whom he has drained many a cup of
sack in his eventful wanderings of the past 350
years.
Mr. W. 8. Northoote, who must be a deep
humorist, proposed recently in the House of Com-
mons that emigrants to Australia should be fur-
nished with return tickets. This proposal will com-
mend itself to all intending emigrants, as well as
to persons who desire, for the sake of their health,
to take a prolonged soa-trip. But the motion does
not go far enough. Mr, Northcote should have re-
membered that some of his return-ticket emi-
grants may possibly, for reasons connected with
their families or creditors, desire to stay in Aus-
tralia for a time, and would certainly be entitled
to receive something to start them in business
hero. Besides the return ticket, the English
authorities may justly be asked to give each pas-
senger on landing sufficient capital to buy a hash,
foundry, a pub., or at the very least a pack of
monte-cards and a gin-case. Otherwise these bold
and stalwart pioneers may find themselves ac tually
obliged to work for a living. If this idea of Mr.
Northcote’s is ever mentioned again it would afford
us joy to know that returns would be given to one
class of emigrants who seem likely to become a
curse, as they already area nuisance to the colony.
We allude to the military loafers, the swaggering
colonels, bibulous captains, and garrulous
generals, who find in N.S.W. a haven of refuge
from their creditors and critics in England, and
who infest all the clubs, and half tho pubs, in
Sydney. If such as these were furnished with re-
turn-tickets and forced to use the second half im-
mediately upon landing, we would hail Mr. North-
cote as our noble deliverer from a pest worse and
more expensive than book-agents or Scotch
thistles.
The dead body of a
flaxen-haired young fe-
male was recently for-
warded to the Imperial
Palace at St. Petersburg
In a package labelled
Perfumery.” Consider-
ing that the parcel had
come all the way from
Paris by slow train, the
label must have been
particularly appropriate
co the contents. But is
any significance to be
attached to this strange
behaviour of the dead
young lady? Can it be
that the Czar indulges
hereditary giddiness dur-
ing his brief respites from
dynamite do dging ? Such a
system of packing off de-
funct “victims” to live
crowned heads should be
discouraged on sanitary
grounds. Some European
monarchs and princes
would receive larger con-
signments of “per-
fumery” than the royal
undertaker could dispose
of, and a court would be
transformed into a char-
nel house.
Says a writer in Lon-
don Figaro “ The con-
viction of Richard Belt,
who undoubtedly ob-
tained money by false
pretences from Sir Wil-
liam Abdy, does not alter
my opinion that he was
a clever sculptor, or
modify my belief that be-
cause he happened to be
of humble origin he was
the target for the unjust
aspersions of some brain-
less idiots who happened
to be born in good cir-
cumstances. But, what-
ever his professional tal-
ents, Belt was quite un-
fitted for the r6le he at-
tempted to play. His
vanity was considerable,
and his flatterers, young
and old, male and female,
fed the flame, and con-
firmed in his not too
strong mind the delusion
that, with ail his ignor-
ance, he was intended to
shine in society. If only
he had been content to
stick to his studio, to
avoid extravagance, to
refuse to listen to the
compliments of silly girls,
and to bide his time, he
might have become really
celebrated. The whole
truth about the relations
between Belt and Sir
William Abdy will, pro-
bably, not be known un-
less the legal action which
Miss St. J ohn threatens,
leads to lurther recrimi-
nations, and sheds light
upon the call made by
Lady Abdy on Mr. Bey-
fus, of Russell-square,
and other episodes men-
tioned in the course of
the trial. There is a strong
suspicion on the part of
the public that, though
Belt committed a fraud,
some one else made a Jot
of money out of his trans-
actions with Sir William
Abdy.”
Dr. Hearn takes the Chancellorship of
the Melbourne University vacated by Bishop
Moorhens*. Thus the highest secular establish-
ment in Victoria reverts to a lay head. It was
always anomalous that under the Education Act
of that colony an ecclesiastic was ineligible for a
seat at a State School Board while eligible and
actually elected to a guiding and controlling posi-
tion at the head of the State University. A
university is only the first of national schools.
Everything justifying ecclesiastical management
of the one institution can be fairly urged on behalf
of the others. It is not, it must be admitted, the
Victorian public who deserve thanks for bringing
about this reversion. The Council of the Univer-
sity was left practically free to elect another
sacerdotal head if it choose. The Senate had
exhausted its resources on the occasion tof the
previous election and had no desire for another
engagement. That which redeems Victorian
secularism from an illogical position is the acci-
dent that there is not at the present time in the
colony an eminent and assertive cleric. The re-
version is therefore shorn of national honour. Dr,
Hearn is Chancellor, but if when the next vacancy
arises there be an Anglican prelate of large in-
fluence in Melbourne, there is nothing to show
that he will not be invited by the council to take
precedence over lay candidates. Until the people
of Victoria, who take such pride in their educa-
tional secularism, work out the principle to tho
end, they will find themselves wrong byysystem
and right by accident only. I

says that the •• yeoman bloed of the colony (the
real stuff-blue as indigo) is not likely to tamely
submit to be asphyxiated thus.” When we hear
such language again, we cry in the words of the
patent medicine advertisement, “What is this
disease that is coming upon us ? ”
At a banquet given in London to the
Ulster members, Mr. Miller, Q.C., who presided
earnestly advised Orangemen and all well-wishers
SHORT AND TO THE POINT.

to Protestantism never to consent to a Parliament
in Dublin.—Mr. Johnston, M.P., said that Orange-
men were determined to uphold* by arms if need
be, the rights and liberties of Protestants.-The
Rev. S. G. Potter urged the duty of Protestants,
when driven to extremity, to try the arbitrament
of the sword.—Major Saunderson,. M.P , said that
Orangemen would neither acknowledge the
authority nor obey the laws of an Irish Parliament.
Rather than submit to any other authority but
the Crown they would take up arms in their own
defence.
The R.C. Bishop of Nottingham’s crusade
against the Primrose League seems to have been
based on the idea that the shades of yellow were
assuming their natural aihQlty, and that the Prim-
rose and the Orange were becoming one. The
Tory party, hopelessly riddled, were trying the
“No Popery ” cry. But the bottom has already
been knocked out of the plan-so far as the Prim-
rose League is concerned—by Cardinal Manning,
who has assured all good Catholics that they may
freely join the League Its objects are to maintain
« religion or Christianity ”-to defend Popery and
Protestantism alike, in fact, against atheism and
anti-Christianity. That is very clever of Cardinal
Manning.
“ It is stated in Dublin that a considerable
number of the Irish constabulary have expressed
an intention to resign should Mr, Gladstones
Home Rule scheme place them under the control
of an Iris a Parliament.” This choice item is from
Life, a London Tory organ run by a German-Jew
who married a rich woman from Australia, and
who often manages to get his rag approvingly
quoted by the Sydney dailies. It is very like y
indeed that a large number of the Dublin police
would "clear” if the reign of Dublin Castle
ceased. It was pretty clearly shown in a recent
memorable trial that the chief aim of those in au-
thority at Dublin police office was to emulate the
example of Sodom and Gomorrah.
In the English poet-laureate’s Indo-Aus-
tralian Exhibition ode, cabled to Lord Carington
last week, we are assured that Britain will not
soueeze us Australians into rebellion by making
us nay the expenses of a possible line of profli-
gates and imbeciles such as lost the Empire
America. Thank you for nothing, Alfred. Did
vour lordship ever reflect what Kngland could do
now if America had remained “in?” Would 50
millions of people of all nationalities have their
House of Commons in the little island of Britain
or in Washington? On the population basis
America would now be entitled to 400 members
or ao in tbe Imperial Parliament, and they would
very soon show that they would sit “ where they
darned well please.”
The Archbishop of Canterbury lately said,
in reply to Karl Milltoun, who designated as spoli-
ation the pulling down of certain church buildings
in the Interests of the local poor—that he (the
Archbishop) was even in favour of selling chalices,
the chalices which had held the sacred elements,
and dividing the proceeds up among the poor.
That, he said, was the most holy use to which
jewels could be put. There is Communism in high
places, with a vengeance 1 But then archbishops
and bishops cannot be expected any more than
clergy of lower degree to practise what they
preach. Otherwise we should have Dr. Benson
boilipg down his mitre and crozier, letting ms
palace out in tenements, living himself on lentils,
and dividing his £15,000 a year among the poor.
Matthew Macfle, one of the best of colonial
authorities on finance, asserts that the system of
floating colonial loans has been the cause of
enormous losses to the colonies, the profits going
to useless banking institutions and brokers. Fully
2 per cent, of Australian loans have gone that
way. He quotes the governor of the Bank of
England as saying that the whole service the banks
render is to announce the loan, but they take no
risk whatever. London investors would just as
soon subscribe at the Agent-General’s Department
as anywhere else. He points out two curious
things. The Victorian Agents’ accounts do not
appear to be audited, and contracts are let in the
office out of which the clerks make a very nice
little thing. How are N.S.W. accounts audited ?
From here? If so, how do they arrange about
books ?
The cablegrams in the Sydney dailies tell
us about the Burmese “ rebels” and the Burmese
insurrection.” Where’s the “ insurrection? ” The
Burmese are not in insurrection against their King,
whom the English have packed off to India.
They are only “ insurrecting” against their
country’s invaders. We used to call the Soudanese
“ rebels”; why, on© could never understand, and
the designation was all the more perplexing con-
sidering that Mr. Gladstone called them ‘a people
struggling to be free.” Never believe a general
when he tells you that a nation likes to be walloped.
They said the same thing when Lord Wolseleys
troops entered Cairo. A man who was on the spot
says he has a lively recollection of the scowling
loots and the muttered curses with which the
Carienes welcomed our excellent friend Tommy
Atkins.
The late Egyptian war, undertaken by
England to oblige a few rich Hebrews, cost about
£lO 000,000 in money. The British army death-
roll was 79 officers and 1495 men; add the deaths in
the naval forces and the total is 3971. In addition,
6863 officers and men were Invalided, so that in
round numbers 10,000 good men, the pick of the
nation in a sense, have either been killed or in-
j ured to get dividends for money-grubbing usurers.
And in the face of all this it is sickening to read
accounts of the present horrible distress in Eng-
land. One sees, for instance, that an old widow
who has just lost her husband and is in arrears for
rent, has been granted Is. lOd. a week by the parish
in kind, and has to walk five miles almost bare-
footed on a London winter’s day to receive 3d.
worth of raw potatoes—which, owing to red-tape-
ism, are refused her.
A Rocky Ponds (Mount Aubrey, N.S.W.)
correspondent writes us under date 3rd May:—
“ Dear Bulletin,— Divine service in connection
with the Episcopalian Church is held here on the
first Sunday in each month. Yesterday being the
first Sunday in May, Mr. Carver held service in
Mr. Burton’s large room. During the service he
informed his hearers that the church was opposed
to the Divorce Bill now before the House, and
further intimated that it was the bishop’s desire
that all opposed to the Bill should sign a petition
which he had. A number of selectors signed the
paper, the majority of them not being able to
read—they have merely practised signing their
names. Not one who signed the paper knew what
he or she was signing; in fact, not one knew any-
thing at all about the Divorce Bill, this being the
first time they had ever heard of it. One man,
when asked what it was he had signed, said, abo-
lition of divorces.’ ”
The London Echo remarks that “no one
who is entitled to speak with any authority has
a formal plan of Imperial Federation ready. A
Federation League was started a few months ago,
and both Lord Kosebery and Mr. Forster spoke at
a conference of its members. But neither of these
statesmen attempted to sketch any workable plan
of federation, and they excused themselves on
the ground that to do so would be premature.
The truth is that the difficulties in the way of
Imperial Federation are insuperable. We wish it
were otherwise; but nothing Is to be gained by
shutting our eyes to facts. The colonies are con*
tent with their present relations to the mother
country, and any attempt to alter them in the
direction of closer union would not be supported
by the greater colonies. The future may show
the need for federation; but it has not been yet,
and until it is more harm than good would be done
by any attempt of the Government to bring it
about.”
Mr. Labouohere recently did good service
in the House of Commons in calling attention,
in a fearless and pointed manner, to the immense
sums voted to royalty in England. Besides the
Civil List, amounting to £385,000, her Majesty re-
ceives £31,997 for the maintenance and repair of
royal palaces and other smaller sums for mews,
stud-farms, yachts, and a hundred and one other
establishments. Altogether, the Civil List, with
its miscellaneous additions, totals up to about
£570,000, without counting the cost of sinecures
created for the benefit of a host of noble English
and German paupers. Some of the palaces the
Queen has not even seen for years, but her rela-
tions are installed therein rent free. The Duke of
Edinburgh, who receives £25,000 a year from the
nation, occupies Clarence House at a further ex-
pense to the taxpayers of nearly £3OOO. At the
Royal Mews, Pimlico, 100 horses are stabled and
230 attendants are paid to look after them; yet a
stud of a dozen horses would be quite sufficient
for all the work her Majesty would require them
to do. It would bo well for the Queen to forego
some of these demands on the nation. Mr.
Labouohere was supported by 131 members on his
motion to reduce the vote for royal parks by
£50,403: while only 114 members ranged themselves
on the other side. Queen Elizabeth knew how to
recede from her demands with grace and dignity.
Queen Victoria would do well to cultivate the
same art.
Figaro—a servile champion of “birth,”
bishons and bunkum—makes some characteristic
comments upon a recent conference on emigration
held in London. The little journal is angry with
the conference for obvious reasons. Many of the
speakers ventured to show the other aide of those
alluring pictures of colonial life which nave been
hurriedly painted by Tory philanthropists since the
unemployed began to get objectionable. But,
without touching upon this question it is Inter-
esting to note the reasons advanced by Figaro
for belittling this particular conference. It did
not attract “ an adequate number of public men”;
there were but two or three speakers of “any
particular weight,” the majority being “ obscure
returned emigrants.” From a Figaro point of
view, then, any practical acquaintance with its
subject disqualifies a man from discussing it, and
Mr. Gilbert’s creation of Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B,
—who advocated never going to sea as the most
suitable training for a ruler of the Queen’s naree—
is to be accepted quite au serieux. We are con-
firmed in this assumption by the fact that the Tory
twaddler lays special stress upon the absence of
Mr. Froude—holy Moses I—from this unfashionable
gathering. The globe-trotting historian is Just
now regarded as the one authority upon colonial
life, labour, and loyalty. His ‘ Oceana ’is a sort
of Australasian Bible full of holy truths, against
which the unfavourable affidavits of a million
“obscure returned emigrants” would avail
nothing. The emigrant who returns to his native
land without having drivelled in a colonial Parlia-
ment or grovelled for a C.M.G., ship is a creature
beneath Tory contempt. Henniker Heaton is a
brilliant exception. But then, he drivels in the
British Parliament.

’Twas midnight, and silence reigned around*
You could have heard a pin drop if you listened.
In fact you could have heard a ton of them drop if
you made listening a special business. Two loving
forms sat beneath the garden wall on a log, and
covered the approach of the old man with the
onen spots between the trees. The male lover’s
name was Tom-the lady’s, Fan, and they had been
on hugging acquaintance with each other for two
vears. He had told her all about the Bulgarian
Question, and funeral reform, and the best way to
cut a “ bull-tarrier’s” ears to make him “ratty,”
and other delicate topics on which most true
lovers long to dwell, and then he placed his arm
where he thought it would be most required, and
said- “ Do you know, deah, I like the name of Pan
so well; it sounds like the gentle rippling of a sun-
kissed brook upon my ears. I like it so well, in
fact that I made sister Sarah call her new poodle

the “ funny bone ” of his elbow against the wall
and moved away; “how would you like to have a

•‘Phantom Ship” is a legend of Manly
Beach. We could not always quite grip the
but toafc is of no oonsequenoe. It Is not
pne wants in this piece, it is thrill, and t
we would have received bushels had we not
been engaged during the startling tableaux
in watching the manufactures of the grand
mechanical effects at the O P. side. The
“Phantom Ship ” is weird, uncanny, and ghostly.
A glimpse of the supernatural, (blue-fire) Il-
lumes it, a glimmer of the ghastly adds to its
charms. Even the portly Holloway seems as
though about to flit to other and brighter realms;
Alfred Boothman’s moustache appears as though
tinted with the light of another sphere, and Miss
Dampler seems etheraallsed into a mere vision or
futurity. .

The scenery is a thing of beauty, and con-
sequently an eternal joy, and the orchestra is one
of uest six orchestras in Sydney.
“It’s no use to argy agin a suokcess,”
therefore -ur notice of “ Fun on the Bristol at
the Sydney Gaiety must be a good one. Since this
show was last in Sydney a lot of new humour has
been ja into it, and various alterations,
mainly Improvements, made in the business, that
now ministers to the rapture of every part of the
house. It would be a fastidious audience that
spurned this medley prodnoilon for everything
from nigger minstrel humour, to grand opera has
its turn on the stage.

John F. Sheridan has so much the big end
of the stick that for once we concur with a
morning contemporary which gravely alleges that
the piece would go tamely without him. wo
tamely! It would not go at all. It would be as
life ess as an Eaglehawk art-union, or a Sydney
daily paper. It is impossible to describe how
John does it, but the Widow O’Brien with him
really seems to be a possible creature, which is
more than can be said of any other of the
characters, bar the count. As the Stage says
of someone else Mr. Sheridan “ impersonates the
part in a way that few artistes that we know would
be able to impersonate ” the impersonation. Miss
May Livingstone is always amusing whether she
be white or black, and her make-up is such as to
leave it a question with many, as to whether she
is really white and washes black, or is a nigger
washed white for the second act. Martyn Hagan
is the irascible Captain. He Is always getting
angry over something wnenever ue is on —so are
the audience. Knight Aston knocks out good
music whenever he gets a chance, but his acting
is not greatly superior to that of Wilson Barrett.
* * *
With the help of varieties that may be
introduced “ Fun on the Bristol” should be good
for quite a considerable period, or even longer.

Sydney Olympic re-opened on Saturday
nignt wicn a new company in the immortal Dion’S
drama of the “ Octoroon.” The audience was not
numerous, the gallery being the only part of the
bouse which was well patronised. The play was
very creditably mounted and ran smoothly, the
applause at times reaching an octave above the
cue and dried order of things. Miss Fanny Wise-
man was Zoe, and save for her rather original way
of stepoing tor the next world, may be said to have
made her part a success. We do not know It
Fanny is used to dying (professionally, of course),
but judging from her performance we should
say she is’nt. When a person has an ounce of
rseaic inside, it is very unusual for him or her to
sit down with a beatified smile playing round the
mouth, make a neat speech and sail off to the
golden shore. We saw a bushman poisoned once
and he died very differently to Fanny. There was
no speech, there was no smile about him. Mr B.
Ryan, as the Indian, roused so much latent enthu-
siasm among the gofis that he had the honour or
being hauled before the curtain. The Jacob
M’Closky of Mr. Gerald Dillon, was not a success:
he mouthed hts words too much, and had an air
of melancholy about him, that even the prospect
of the Indian’s scalping knife in his ribs, could not
rid him of. Mr. W. South as Salem Scudder, made
up well as a Yank, but his dialect was very off.
The rest of the characters were filled by a band or
handsome and talented people, including Dot
Read, Maud Johnston, Sam. Howard, and A. L.
Burton. There is one thing we would suggest to
the management and that is, that they red uce the
size of their programme somewhat. At present it
is plenty large enough to paper a “ three-roomer.

The Lynch Family are revelling in crowded
and hilarious houses in their extended tour
through the Sunny South. Wagga saw them last
week, and the counter-attractions of a circus,
a political meeting, and a dog-fight did not seem
to militate against the attendance any. The
climate of the interior seems to agree with the
company. Parlat i wears a perennial smile, and
the Lynches are so completely rej uvenated that

The Majerouis are doing well at Melbourne
Bijou with “ Elizabeth, Queen of England.” Corn-
oared with the average historical drama, in five
acts, “Elizabeth” is quite an airy trifle. The
author. Signor Giacometti, has constructed five
short dramatic scenes of fairly equal strength
and interest, and has ohown such a tender regard
for modem English “Jingoism” that if the
author’s name had been kept dark we should have
thought Plain Bill was seeking laurels in a new
sphere of usefulness. Signor Giacometti has not
handicapped himself with too much historical
accuracy as regards dates. We have, for instance,
the Parliament urgently pressing the desirability
of the Queen’s marriage at the mature age of
55 and Elizabeth herself considering the matter
with many maidenly sighs. But this is put right
bv Signora Majaronl setting back the age of Bess
in the first four acts, and making an apparently
young woman oi Essex’s antiquated admirer. In
reality their ages were as wide apart as those of
the Baroness Burdett-Goutts and Ashmead
Bartlett. But these little matters in nowise
affect the interest of the story, which is
at least as reliable a yarn as Mr. Rusdens
“History of the New Zealand War.” The first
four acts set forth the rise and fall of the
Bari of Essex; the fifth act shows the Queen dying
of old age and grief for her last sweetheart. Essex,
according to Giacometti, was the only man Eliza-
beth ever loved. It Is due to the young man to
observe that he didn t appear very far gone on his
sovereign. He rightly reckoned her up as an art-
ful humbug, and expressed very substantial
doubts about the validity of her title of Virgin
Queen.” His scepticism on the last point—shouted
out to the ladies an i gentlemen of the Court-led
to his untimely deceas i In those degenerate days
it would probably lead to a royal suit for defama-
tion ot character. The incident of the giving of the
ring to Essex and his unfortunate failure to return
It according to arrangement are made much of.
The execution ot Mary Queen of scots and the
d ffeat of the Spanish Armada both take place dur-
ing toe evening behind the scenes, Shakespeare,
too. is referred to more than once, but greatly to
tue public disappointment, the divine William
doean t appear on tbe stage. However, as we get
an introduction to Sir Francis Bacon, many people
will consider that they have Shakespeare s
“ghost” actually before them. “Elizabeth is
presented with artistic completeness, Tbe scenery
seems accurate in detail, and the dresses are out
and out good. Even the bearing and get-up of
the supers does not detract from the dignity of the
scenes. True, the courtis on somewhat Ireeaud
easy terms with its avowedly dread sovereign but
the bes bred gentlemen are tbe worst sinners in
that respect. Besides, there Is little doubt tnat
Elizabeth was very free and easy at times. In the
title r6le, Signora Majaronl displays her ability to
the best advantage. Tne pride, vanity, love, and
cruelty of Blizaoeth are artistically blended,
and the performance is not lacking in comedy
t niches. Her death scene is simply immense
The wicked old hag with the crown grotesquely
set on her palsied old head makes a picture that
would harmonise with Irving s Louis XI. It is
unsurpassably appatnng. Signor Majeronl is a
courtly and impassioned Essex, whose love-mak-
ing is of the kind most acceptable to ladies. His
very pardonable defiance of his sovereign lady at
the end of the third act is a bit of acting which
deserves a better fate tban the scaffold. Mr.
Augustus Glover and Mr. W. G. Carey as Drake
and Hefflngham (it was spelt without an H when
we went to school) are appropriately rugged toils
to the gentlemanly Essex, whom they conspire to
cr-r-ush, and the others are, without exception,
carefully apparelled and alert as regards bye play.
In a word, there is about the whole show a certain
sense of dignity and reality too frequently want-
ing in the representation of historical plays.

“ Falka,” at the Opera House, is the name
of th« latest Melbourne sensation It is a series of
splendid soeotacuiar with good scenery,
and brisk, light music by Chassalgue libretto by
Farnle. Everything about It shows good form,
irom the host of girls to the programme, which
are “toney” things printed after the Leaden-
halle Presse on “handmade,” and lavisffly illus-
trated. I'ne plot is rather involved. Folbach,
Governor of Mongratz, in Hungary, is promised a
title be the Emperor on condition of his produc-
ing an heir. He adopts his nephew Tancred,
usher in a village school, who Is seized by the
Tzigane, a kind o f Hungarian gipsy horde, while
on a is way to join his uncle. Boleslas, the chief
of these festive cut-throats, has a sister named
Edwige. who aids Tancred to escape, but extorts
trom nim before doing so a promise of marriage,
which Tancred artfully forgets. While Eol-
bach awaits his nephew’s arrival, Falka, Ms
niece, elopes from a convent school witn
a student, Arthur. Then the trouble com-
mences. Arthur disguises himself as lalka,
who afterwards represents herself to Folbach as
his nephew Tancred, who, again, enters Folbach
Castle as a kind of under-footman. Boleslas helps
to straighten things out a bit by appearing on the
scene with his sister and some cutlery. He is paci-
fied by the denouement, wherein Boleslas marries
Tancred’s betrotbed, Tancred weds Edwige, and
Falka takes Arthur, while Folbach discards
Tancred and adopts Falka as his heiress, .briar
Pelican is a fat lay brother, who leaves the con-
vent school in search of Edwige, and consequent
fun. Yerdi plays Boleslas and makes a most pic-
turesque brigand chief—voice and appearance
both good. F. B. Appleby is Folbach, and
gets tne most out of the part. But the
success of the piece is Mr. R. Brough as Tancred,
under whose direction the whole is put on. ue
has a quiet and effective manner in the broadest
comic scenes, and doesn’t exasperate the observer.
The name-part is taken by Miss Ivanova. _ Q aite
a legion of lithe-limbed supernumeraries delight
the naidheads of the stalls, and excite the inflam-
mable pit. Moore and McDonald, the sub-lessees
from Rignold and Allison, claim the honour or
introducing tne piece. As there is some talk or
opening the new theatre in Sydney with * balka,
it’s 3 ust as well to know what we’ve got to expect.

The first representation of M'Mahon and
Leitch’s dramatised version of “ His Natural Life

Courier “marred by the entire failure of Miss
Anstead, who played Sarah Purfoy, tore present
the feline grace of the she-panther, which la the
real character of Rex’s young wife. Poor, good-
natured Floral And they wanted her to be a she-
panther 1 If Leitch wants the genuine article, we
can let him have cheap the address of a pretty
little she-panther, who now plays at a Sydney
theatre. We read that the play closed with the
Reverend North’s confession. Not that Leitcn
had no more to pay out, “hut the performance
had lasted four hours and a-half and the manage-
ment rightly considered that human nature could
stand no more.” This is, of course, sheer nonsense.
Just let Leitch bring the show down to Sydney and
give us a good seat at half-past i ina place
where we can see Frere hugging Sara Purfory.

of Victoria are mere chopping-blocks for the en-
terprising Nu-So’-Walers:—“ A man stating his
■ame as Robertson, recently from Sydney, has
ween victimising Melbourne medical men, chemists,
mnd dentists, by valueless cheques. He allowed the
wxtraetlon of a tooth by Heath and Kernot,
dentists, in order to get a cheque cashed.” Mr.
Robertson, thou hast deserved well of thy country,
even though it boast of men who would allow
their very jaws to be extracted to cash cheques—
even though it number among its million of popu-
lation nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninetv-nine persons who are
selling their immortal souls for coin of the realm.
Tet is civilisation progressing in the main ? Time
was when they drew the teeth of the opulent Jew

There was, last week, a wild scene of ex-
citement In one of the quietest suburbs of Mel-
bourne# A horse bolted. But let us take some
particulars from the local paper:—“The animal
dashed furiously on. A gentleman was seen to
dart out and make towards the runaway. People
stood with bated breath expecting to see him
knocked down and killed, but. catching the reins,
he gradually turned the frightened beast around
amid great cheers from the lookers-on. It was
then seen to be no other person than Councillor
Mills.” Now, why should the local thunderer
refer to a respectable councillor as a frightened
beast ?

have left, and others taken their places Among
tbe former I may mention our Sergeant Hash r.
who is retiring from the police force with a well-
merited pension, and going to live on his lately
purchased property near Holey Flat.” No doubt
Sergeant tTssher has earned his pension, but we
cannot keep sympathising with the country con-
stable who has to wait till old age and pension-
time before he can buy a bit r f ground ana a house
to live in. A good man in the city can retire early

Here is a Jewish item which will make the
Children yell. At Wrublowltz In Poland, they
used to have a burlesque Beth Din, with the Chief
Rabbi and the three dayanim sitting, and would
pass the day in asking riddles of each other. A
dayan would ask—“ Of Jew and Christian, which is
the dirtier of the two ? ” “ The Christian,” replies
the Rabbi. “You’re wrong, old momzlr,” shout
another dayan. “The Jew is the dirtier, for the
Christian is continually blackening him ” But the
best riddle they asked was—“ Which did King
Solomon love best—women or ebole< t pudding ? "
•• Women, certainly," shouted the dayans “ Why
so ?" Interrogates toe R«bbi. “Why because he
wrote * woman is bitter ’ (as presumably he found
t her), but nowhere does he say that sholent Is
bttter. Sohe loved sholent best.” Then the
Rabbi hits them over the head with his lulov. and
they go out and have drinks.
The criminals were handcuffed, but not
leg-ironed, and with their escort were awaiting
the train which would convey them to the country
traol. Suddenly a woman rushed from amongst
the (raping crowd of idlers standing round, *nd
with a shower of tears cried out; “ Kiss me Ned ;

the kis*ing biz. to come off. and the soft-hearted
«erge»nt-in-charge had to turn his head aside and
haul his sleeve across his eyes to wipe away a
t« ar. Some difference of opinion as to the pro-
per route to the gaol appears t > have occurred on
tbe Journey, however, and Ned and his escort
parted company. While the kissing game was on
the woman had paised a key from her mouth to
her gentle Edward’s, and with this he undid the
bracelet,” and allowed himself to take leg-bail

His Excellency the Governor and Lady
Carlngton, accompanied by the Hen. Miss Har
bord, Mias Wheelen, Captain Wellington, and Loro
Bertie, A.D.C., attended divine service on board
H.M.S. Nelson on Sunday, the 2nd May. We
regretted to notice that so popular a man as Bis
Excellency should be suffering from severe
catarrh, and bo compelled so frequently to
Interrupt the service by blowing hla vloe-rega l
nose. We have had a cold lately, and though our
nose is not vice-regal it’s Just as tender The naval
organ (observe the distinction) was played on by a
true blue. We never did think there was much
music in a man of war—we’re sure of it now.

On Tuesday evening, the 4th, the Exhibi-
tion building, Sydney, presented a very brilliant
appearance on the occasion of the ball given in aid
of the School of Industry. The building was most
tastefully ornamented with palms and flags and
wreaths, while hundreds of variegated Japanese
lanterns suspended from the ceilings and walls
presented a novel and picturesque appearance. A
most fashlonab’e assemblage att-nded, owing
probably to the presence of hii Bxoelenoy the
Governor and Lady Carlngton, who ware acorn
panied by the Hon Miss Harbord, Miss Wheelen,
Lord Bertie, Captain Gascoigne, Captain Terry,
A.D C., and Mr. Wellington, private secretary.
Lady Carlngton looked extremely pretty in char-
treuse merveilleuse satin with low bodice and
short sleeves, her hair becomingly dressed an*'
surmounted by a handsome tiara of diamonds—
diamond bangles and riviere of the same wert
worn on neck and arms. The Hon. Miss Har bore
was dressed in a becoming gown of white satin
asd tulle with natural pink roses on her .bodice
her hair done high, in which pink roses were als
worn. Lady Manning wore pale-blue silk trimmer
with cream lace, and Mr". Maoleay black tulle
richly and tastefully jetted. The Misses Throck
morton wore stylish black costumes, which, how-
ever. did not suit them to a very wondrous degree.
Miss Enid Macarthur was more happy in her choice
of all white. The Sydney Lancers were not largely
represented, and those who did appear would have
ooked very much better it their uniform" had had
the appearance of hiving been made for them-
selves amd not for much stouter men.
* * *
On Monday evening, the 3rd insfc , Mrs.
and the Misses Backhouse, Seven Oaks, gave s
most charming and successful dance, the guests
numbering about 60. Dancing was kept up till a
late hour, and many becoming and beautiful cos
tumea were worn.
* *
On Thursday evening, the 6th inst., Mrs.
Arthur Macarthur. of Darlmghurst, entertaima
about 60 guests. Dancing was supposed to be the
order of the evening. Amongst many faces well-
known in society was observed that of the Hon.
Harbord, looking charming as usual, and some o
the gentlemen from Government House.

on toe llib and 3ist Instant.
We never did belong to the royal navy and
are rather glad of it. for otherwise we mlgnt have
been placed in a similar position to that of tbv
officers of one of her Majesty’s ships on this
station. These officers, wishing to return some of
the kindness their Sydney Irlends had "howei-ea
on them, determined to give a ball on , Bh ° re
They hired a room, invited the guests and made
all necessary preparations. But they reckoned
without their host. Their chief commander, on
receiving an Invitation, said, Oh, certainly, geo*
tfemen; but as you dl i not first obtain my oermls.
slon I will send you off to sea the night*he
hall! So now you know your position, ihey
did; and quietly went among their friends and ex-
plained the situation. Thsre will be no ball. VVe
still say we are glad we are not in the navy, and
under so highly distinguished commander.

Mons. Kowalski scored another brilliant
success by his second concert last Friday night.
The “oH solos certainly were for the most part,
weak but exception must be taken to Miss
Saville’B singing of "Perles de Kose& (Kowalek )
which Is a nrllllant composition and -as oiilltantly
sung The same singer was not so happy in her
old favourite ‘ Old, Old Words,” but this w.B malrly
due to toe orchestra, which completely over-
powered her. and caused her voice to be ineffec-
tive Still tor all that an encore was accordtd
her * Mrs. Atkinson was unfortunate in the choice
of "her song, *• Because of Tnee ’ not making
the usual impression upon the audience. Nor
whs Herr Friedmann more fortunate with ms
Unnir for his voice is utterly unsuited for such
solos’as” Largo al Factotum.” It isn’t sufficiently
although musical enough for anything.
A duet between Mons. Kowalski (piano) and Mr.
M‘Lean (violin) was a grand item, but as a matter
kronnran the gems of the concert were Kowalski s
a his own compositions, which he
nUylTlnflnltely better than he does those of other
unmnosers. “11 dtait une fols is a very quaint

The Sydney D.T. slaverer again. This
time it is announced that Lady Carlngton has
expressed herself as highly pleased with the Law
i Courts.” The Governor’s wife is an inoffensive,
unpretentious little woman, and w f. do “
gUe wishes to he set up as au authority on law
courts,any more than she desires to be regarded as a
connoisseur ef penal establishments. Whom does it
interest to know what Lady Carlngton thinks
of law courts ? We’d like to know, however, what
Lady Carlngton thinks of the people who stand
pencil in hand at her receptions, cataloguing the
guests. *

The second annual ball of the Nevertire
Picnic Race Club took place at Dubbo on the
30th ultimo, and was a very enjoyable affair. The
snobbishness which was shown by a few members
‘ast year in black balling everybody whose posi-
tion in the social ladder was a fraction of a rung
below their own was this time conspicuous bv its
absence, and the Duchess ot Bounce and the
C unless of Pills might have been seen conversing
with the Merchant of Venice or the Master of Rolls
just as If such common trades-folfc were made of

Christ Church, South Yarra, Melbourne,
was the scene of a very pretty wedding on Tues-
day afternoon, 27th April. when the marriage of
4r Albert J, Hodtrklnson, of Humber Bank,
Richmond River, N.8.W., to Miss Ada Josephine
Hidmlston, of Albert Park, Melbourne, was
solemnized. The bride, who was given away
by her uncle, Mr. H. Bishop, of South
Varra, looked pretty and graceful in a wed-
ding gown of ruby satin, tastefully trimmed
with cream lace, bonnet to match. She was at-
tended to the altar by four little bridesmaids in
costumes of ruby and brown plush, two In each
colour. Amongst the guests present were Mrs. M.
i£ldston,the bridegroom’s sister, who wore a hand-
some gown of black velvet, with front of coffee
lace over ruby satin, bonnet of coffee and ruby;

lalne, white bonnet; Mrs. Nungesser (N.B.W),
prune silk and cashmere; Mrs. Edmiatoa, black
silk ; Mrs Bishop, grenat satin; Miss Elmij-

evening, they stayed on the lawn f r, I should say,
marly two hours. Tea wa« served in the refresh-

•ared for it; and, on the whole, it was a pleasant
afternoon.
At last the proprietors of one of our popu'ar
drapery establishments have seen fit ip take the
hint so long and earnestly thrown out to them as
to the advisability of attaching a tea-room to their
oremises. Mr. Quong Tart is the caterer and we
needed no second invitation yesterday morning to
step from Messrs John Hordern s show-room into
cne prettily constructed tea-room which is sjtuatea
at the further end. and partake of the famous
•tea and scone.’ 1 It la a pity, though, that the
proprietors have decided to debar the shop girls
from taking their lunch in tne tea-room. 1 can
quite understand that there are many 'ladies
amongst their customers who wou'd squirm at the
Idea of sitting down to a cud of tea in tne company
of these poor gins, out surely a small screen
would suffice to lesve them in blissful ignorance
of the t* rnb.'e fact that tnoy were actually drink-
ing tea in the same room as the girls who had a
moment before, perhaps, been serving them with
ribbons!

a surfeit of entertainments here at present, it

PEPPER AND SALT.
A striped red and white cotton shirt and
a pair of old white flannel drawers have been
found in the malle© scrub near Werracknabeal
(Vic). The Melbourne Age thinks that ‘‘the
owner of the articles has got lost in the scrub and
has perished.”
One of the most ingenious projects for
alleviating distress in the old country emanates
from the office of the Pall Mall Gazette “ A
special opportunity,” says the P.M.G., “is this
yew offered to the Queen, not only to give an
enormous stimulus to trade, bat to Increase the
loyalty of her subjects in all parts of Great
Britain. Here are the colonies, one and all, mak-
ing the greatest preparations to be worthily re-
presented at the forthcoming exhibition. Only
let it be announced that the Queen will give a few
large garden parties at Buckingham Palace, and
that her colonial subjects can without great diffi-
culty obtain an invitation to parties, and
there will be a perfect exodus from every colony
towards this country. Many a rich settler who
lives like a little king in some remote colony will
leave his retirement, come to England, kiss the
Queen’s hand (the italics ours), and go back to in-
form his adherents that there is not a more graci-
ous, charming, delightful old lady in all the world
than Queen Victoria, whose devoted subject he
will be tor all his remaining days.” This is altoge-
ther Immense 1 But a still betcer way of reviving
trade in Sngland, and so benefiting the masses
would be to start a grand State lottery, each pr'ze
winner to have a free passage home and the en-
tree to these delectable gardes parties. The pro
fits on the sale of tickets to be divided among the
unemp.oyed. (Sling us the banjo:—
Mr. O’Sullivan has called the N.8.W. Pre-
mier’s attention to the fact that Norfolk Island
has no representative in Parliament. But, then,
neither has Goat Island. And yet Norfolk Island is
not altogether unrepresented in the Press. The
periodical letter from there, evidently written by
a clergyman, is one of the spiciest things the
Sydney dailies ever get into their columns, and
we look for it as the parched Arab with hla black-
ened tongue hanging out of his mouth looketh
for the dim fringe of an oasis shimmering in the
faint horizon. Here are some samples of life in
that storm-tossed gem of the sea and centre of
tumultuous political life, clipped from a recent
Sydney daily“ A sail appeared to the north-east,
but just as we (the population—13) had mounted
a ridge she sailed away. (Ten days later ) A
whaling vessel put in to-day. We see by the file
of the Herald left that Governor Macquarie has
been dead some time. Who Is this Parkes, stated
to be editor of the Empire paper? What is the
meaning of this Exhibition in the Crystal Palace
just opened by the Prince Consort? You see we
receive our news so irregularly that we are alto-
gether behind the times. Will write by the next

Here’s a physician that healed himself
effectually. A man named Michael Quin was
found dead in a hut at a sawmill in Western Aus-
tralia. He had been living by himself for some
time past, was rarely seen except when he came to
the store for a tew purchases, and always took
away a stock of patent-medicines. The hut was
littered with bottles and plil-boxes of every de-
scription. Some quinine for him
should take the trouble to blow off the froth and
drink half before nerving the boy with the re-
mainder to tackle his geography. For want of
some* such judicious supervision no less than
eight boys from one school and four from
who came to Sydney to the examinations, well
prepared, foolishly filled up with a man’s allow-
ance of beer and smoked new clays to clear their
heads and steady the nerves with the result that
every man of them was ‘ plucked.’ Smoking and
beer-linking being necessary to life immediately
on leaving school, parents should see to it that
boys are brought on gradually.” [Agreatmora j
truth admirably expressed.— Ed B ]

It is time we gave obituary-verses a rest.
The humour of these productions can, in a general
way, be left to speak for itself. But the Melbourne
Age (it has much to answer for in this depart-
ment) recently published a descriptive and his-
torical poem which deserves notice on account of
the very serious speculations it arouses in the
mind of the thoughtful reader. An “oldest”
daughter of a deceased lady says:—
“ I heard my mother, she was ill,
And went to soothe her pain;
I left my home in Ballarat,
By the 11.30 train.
When I arrived in Melbourne,
I went straight to her side,
And on the following afternoon
My poor dear mother died.”
The fatal result of this visit naturally sets to
wondering whether the poor dear mother
might not have recovered if her affectionate rela-
tive had missed toe 11.30 train. Anyway, things
could’nt have turned out worse.
The “Hat Camera,” the most recent f angle
of this progressive age, appears to he an assured
success. At a meeting of the Liverpool Amateur
Photographic Association, Mr. Dresser exhibited a
very cunningly devised little camera, which only
added three ounces to the weight of his hat. It
can easily be concealed and worked in the hat.—
“A Teaoher ” writes us:— “Dear Bul-
letin,—! desire to point out a serious defect In
the system of preparing boys for the junior ex-
aminations, and I claim the co-operation of all
parents in this matter. It is a great disappoint-
ment to a teacher or parent when a boy, whose
education has been carefully attended to and
liberally paid for, fails to pass the standard at the
end of the year. Toe cause of many such mis-
haps is the neglect of the parents and teachers to
furnish a thorough grounding in the use of beer
and tobacco. The cigarette is the first stage, and
every father should leave his ‘ Old Judge ’ packet
somewhere about handy, and instruct the youth
in the art of smoking without expectoration. A
cigarette is very soothing between Latin and
algebra, a pipe may come in better just before
English grammar, because there is no English
grammar in existence worth studying, and a boy
might as well be enjoying his quiet smoke as try-
ing to understand the crazy old Morelia and Gar-
diners. Then, again, as to beer. A full pewter
is too large for some boys of 14, and all fathers
WALKER!
Very likely, very likely I he had wandered in his
way—
No food or drink had passed his lips for many a
weary day;
And so, at last, despairing of arriving at a pub.,
The stranger lay him down to die among the
mallee scrub.
He flung awav his cotton shirt (’twas striped with
red and white),
And shedding next his flannel drawers he bade the
world good-night;
Then, folding close his horny hands upon his naked
breast,
The stranger went off shiv’rlng to the Kingdom
of the Blest.
Oh! ye who die in downy beds, with weeping
friends about,
And lots of willing hands prepared to lay your
bodies out,
Think what it were to shuffle off alone—aye, there’s
the rub I—
Sans friends, sans bed, sans shirt— like him who
perished in the scrub!
PRILGRIMS OF LOVE
What a blissful, blissful prospect I what a happy,
happy dream!
May Heaven bless that journalist who hit upon a
scheme
For spreading peace and plenty and contentment
through a land,
By Inviting far-off colonists to kiss the monarch’s
band.
With what transport would the squatter quit his
pastoral retreat,
If he only were desired to be one of the elite—
To make one among that happy, highly-interest-
ing band,
Which is graciously allowed to osculate the
monarch’s hand.
Let the Invites, then, be Issued, let Vic. only give
word.
And no more the bitter cry of outcast London will
be heard;
For colonists as countless as the little grains of
sand,
Will hurry home to England just to kiss the royal
hand.
From Sydney and from Melbourne they will take
the P. and O.,
To get this glimpse of royalty—in hundreds they
will go;
From Af ric’s sunny fountain and from India’s coral
strand,
We, in fancy, see them speed to osculate their
monarch’s hand.
Who, reading this proposal, shall hare courage now
to say,
That kings are institutions that were better swept
away;
Those useful creatures will be more than ever in
demand,
When every snob can slobber o’er a rigid royal
hand.
Oh! the fever is upon us—wo must grovel with tho
rest,
Shall we get an invitation and be numbered with
the blest;
This news has made the bosom of The Bulletin
expand.
May God preserve bur gracious <Jueen until we
kiss her hand!
THE DEATH OF QEUN.
It was not whisky or disease
Nor any vice or sin
That made King Death stalk rudely up
And grip the hand of Quin.
’Twag Mother Siegel first called round,
Then Holloway dropped in;
And Warner brought his Safe Cure for
The patching-up of Quin.
And then for consultation, and
Because he looked so thin,
De Jongh brought round cod-liver oil
To fatten up poor Quin.
Next, Dr. Bell brought, liver-draughts,
Ay’rs ointment well rubbed in,
And Coilis Brown brought chlorodyne
To soothe the pains of Quin.
Some cuticura next he tried
To smooth his pimply skm,
And Dr. Clarke's blood mixture
By the pint gulped down poor Quin.
And er© he closed Its eyes in death
He'd one regret borne in—
“ I should have chewed the bottles up
Were the last words of Quin.
A hymn to your invention, worthy Dresser,
An instrument of mingled joy and woe,
A silent witness to the gay transgressor
Of wedded vows, who often has to go
Down town on business of an evening. He will
Forget the instrument Which cannot lie,
And when he stumbles home towards morning she
will
Secure his hat, and with revengeful eye
Explore the negatives. Oh Heaven 1 what scenes of
Festivity I what greenroom nymphs I what fizz I
Chi camera may be the heaven-sent means of
Entirely bursting up these larks of his,
Even snould this dangerous lead hat be “ caved in'*
Returning home beneath a reeling moon.
What odds ? Tne photographs are always saved in
A case like that. You’ve seen the “ Octoroon ” ?
Again, some carrot-headed gay deceiver,
At eve, with care adjusts each fiery curl,
Puts on his natty photographic beaver
And sallies out to meet his premier girl;
Will he be any less than broken-hearted
When in his hat she finds a photograph
Ta’en from the hat-rack just before he parted
Prom his inferior love—or will he laugh ?
Of old when lovers’ vows were warmly spoken,
And warmly answered if they went apart,
The man, though he possessed no other token
Could bear his mistress’ image on his heart,
Now when Adonis calls upon his lady
Her image on his heart may be, ’tis true,
But when to her he lifts his patent " cadey ”
Upon it ’twill be left imprinted too I
In Sydney, at the present time, we know that
Full many a tallow-chandler and his spouse
To common folk in different circles “ blow ” that
They’ve been “received” at the vice-regal house,
Which many doubt. If he had such a hat it
Would satisfy the doubters, one and all,
By showing (that is, if they could get at it)
A neat interior of the servants’ hall I
We have no doubt at all, or but a small one
This hat will “ take well,” and entirely please.
The faith! ui ought to buy the Cardinal one I
Tnen when a girl performs on the trapeze,
In aid of Peter’s holy church, we warrant
No counterfeit of her will there appear—
No reflexes of winsome rafflers, nor in’t
Aught except pictures, truthfully severe.
Or Crowns of Thorns-to help along the good
work
Wrought cunningly In many-coloured wools.
And chaste Madonnas, fashioned out of wood-
work
And broldered miracles from ladies’ schools..
This would be right. But would it not be
wrong to
Trust young (or old) men—ice would think It
crime—
With just such hats, who, in the front seats
throng to
Devour the ballet at the pantomime ?
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lubra’s Plaint
(Paraphrased from a funeral dirge heard at Port
Lincoln, 185 L)
Thou art trone to the islands of bliss, ray child,
That sleeT in a cloud of spray.
On the red-bill’s wing o’er the waters wild
Thy spirit hath floated away, (a)
And the fount of my bosom, it flows In vain—
Sad plenty in sorrow’s dearth,
Like a summer tempest of sudden rain
That melts not the baken earth.
I had worked me a hood of the yuro’s (b) skin,
Thy pleasing burden to bear;
Warm and woolly and soft within.
So thou shouldst nestle there.
Ah, mel that labour is all o’erthrown;
I toiled only to regret,
And the nimble creature that skin did own—
Why is it not living yet ?
Yea, though thou be dead, from place to place
We’ll journey together awhile;
Though silent, I’ll think thy tiny face
Yet on my neck dotn stpilel
And when the flesh is dry on thy brows,
I’ll climb where the tail gum-trees
Shall hold thee aloft in their feathery boughs
To be swayed by the autumn breezs.(c)
O, when the spirits thy life renew
More happily than of old;
When hither thou comest in big canoe
A white fellow stern and cold—
Dwelling in huts and claiming the land,
With store of cattle and food—
Holding our lives in thy cruel hand
To do as thou deemest good—
Chasing us into the waterless wild
That once were happy and free;
May the spirits whisper (d) thou wert my child.
And bid thee be kind to me I

The Great Awakener, his euphonium taking,
And clearing well his throat,

And over all the world, men harkening to it.

Bare-headed and gaunt, with their clothing in
tatters,
They kneel at the gateway of wealth,
A motley oolleotion of hollow-oheeked satyrs,
Who gaze at the carriage as by them it clatters
With looks between menace and stealth.
They're starving, they say, but the lordling knows
better,
A loafing demned lazy-backed crew,
Whose whining eternal but answers to fetter
The arms of the nation—a nation who yet her
Own aristocrats will bring through.
The cry is unheeded, and onward they drive; it
Is where there is plenty ana peace.
And wastefulness reigns where these rich people-
live; it
Is waste they are asked for, but rather than
give it.
They’d send them where troubles shall cease.
Their souls like their stomachs are gorged and
distended
With avarice, lustfulness, beef,
Their eyes see beyond not the hand that’s ex-
tended,
The heart that is broken, the hope that is ended.
The life that counts death a relief.
They live in security, safe from the spectre,
Tnat stalks amid poverty's hordes;
What matter to them though such lives may be
wreosed or
That hunger may gnaw them, the bouquet of
nectar
The same satisfaction affords.
I A heap of gross humours that rust on the gold,
they
Have coined from the flesh of the poor;
They filch off his coat and the pauper goes cold,
they
Uncover the children so wizened and old, aye,
And then kick the lot from the door.
I Let’s look to the day when the poor shall awaken
At last to a sense of their strength,
I When hunger and starvation grind, both have
taken

is shaken,

J.P.B.
WOMANHOOD.
Marriage, the gaol of every goodwoman’s amn
bltion, is. at best, not a surreit of sweets. There
are knobs and excresences, and queer unsightly
edges to the most beautlflui tree; and she who had
roared a family has passed through a career of
anxieties such as the superficial thinker cannot
realise. Ah J the mother’s joys may be great—but
her griefs many. When To . goes wrong, or Nelly
runs away with the dancing master, and she has to
defend her erring ones against the cruel taunts and
passionate resentment of her husband, their father,
the woman has a hard time of it. Ho w p.tlent sne
is; how gentle her submission; how sweet ner resig-
nation I But who shall say how she suffers beneath
that calm exterior? At riving at that period of
life,too, when all women undergo that mysterious
and perilious transition of physical force, known
as change of lite. As her past health has been, so
will she pass through the ordeal before her.
Thousands of women succomb, because they take
no steps to secure their strength, and to fortify
their system, and eradicate the effects of prior ail-
ments. This transition period is marked by a total
revolution of her life forces. All the organs of her
body are affected, because her blood is changed.
Her nervous system is strained; her brain is taxed.
And yet ninty-nine of such women go along with
their duties in patient suffering: or, if they do com-
plain, meet with scant sympathy from those around
them. However, in these times, when the laws of
I our being are taught to young women, we may
I hope that all this will be changed. In the meaa-
I time, it is gratifying to know the great good that
is being accomplished among sick and ailing
women, by the use of Warner’s safe cure. Among
the latest testimonials to this effect, is the follow-
ing: “Alfred-street, St. Leonards Bast, North
Shore, Sydney, N 8.W., March 8th, 1888 About
three years ago, I suffered very much from my
liver and kidneys. 1 did not suffer mueh acute
pain, but I was nevertheless not at all inclined, and
not fit, to attend to my household affairs, suffer-
ing greatly from a dull, heavy pain across my
back and loins, and between my shoulders, with
severe headaches. At the time I commenced
Warners safe cure. I was also sufferng from
erysipelas in my foot, which completely dis-
appeared after I had taken but one bottle. I took
five more, and am now quite well. Mrs. Mary
Wilkins,” Now, here we behold a very common
state of affairs. Thousands of people are in tae
strait this lady describes—suffering irons no acute
pain, but affected by an indescribable depression,
want of energy, and depression of spirits. As a
general thing, this is thought to be a matter of
“nerves” and resort is had to stimulants of drug
tonics, only to effect temporary relief, and in-
tensify the evil. Warner s sate cure strikes at the
root of the evil, by the removing conditions of
disease, and re-establishing those of health. Ladies,
therefore, whether maids or matrons, spinsters,
I widows, or motner-in-law. may well read, mark,
I learn, and Inwardly digest these facts, to their
I great profit and happiness.

and has been trading in this port for the past 25
years, sends us the following statement:—“About
seven or eight years ago I sprained my back in lift-
ing an anchor, and from that time until I came to
you for a Belt, I never was well. Excruciating
pains in the back and muscles used to attack me
with alarming persistency until really I could never
depend on freedom for a single day. Having tried
so many things ineffectually, you cannot wonder
that I purchased your Dr. Scott’s Electric Belt
with considerable misgiving, but I am happy to tell
you that since commencing to wear it I have been
entirely relieved and have not suffered from any
of my old symptoms since. lam now completely
j cured, and there are scores of men in the coastal
I trade to whom I have recommended it, who, from
I personal experience, can speak as highly of it as
myself.
DR. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC CORSET
For
HEALTH, COMFORT. AND BEAUTY.
IMPORTANT TO LADIES.
Mrs. Williams, of Mlllers-street, St. Leonards,
writes of these admirable curative appliances:
—“I cannot speak too highly of your Dr. Scott’s
Electric Corsets as a natural and scientific means
of relieving pain. For a very long period I suffered
from acute backache—one of the most distressing
complaints of our sex, but I am happy to inform
you that since wearing your corset (Dr. Scott’s) I
have never once felt a relapse or a return of my old
symptoms. I consider them, indeed, invaluable*
and frankly and earnestly recommend them.
DR, SCOTT’S ELECTRIC BELTS.
ALMOST MAGICAL.
Constable William Stapleton, of the Redfern
Police Station, has experienced some of the benefits
of curative electricity in the form of Dr. Scott’s
(the only genuine) Electric Belt. I suffered con-
siderably, says Mr. Stapleton, from muscular pains
in the back, caused through exposure and taking
cold in the execution of my duty during a heavy
rainstorm. You cannot imagine the amount of
pain and agony I suffered from this comparatively
trifling matter, and it became so bad that I was
obliged to consult our surgeon and obtain sick
leave. Neither the one or the ether availed, how-
ever, and as a last resort I tried your Dr, Scott’s
Electric Belt. The effect was almost magical. The
pain seemed to leave me instantly, and I have never
felt the slightest inconvenience from it. I have
recommended your Belt to scores of my friends,
and amongst others to Mr. F. Cavener, the head
porter of the Railway Station, who used it with
equally successful results upon a child of his. I
am well known in the force, and if my published
recommendation is of any service to you you are
welcome to it.
DR. SCOTT’S ELECTRIC CORSETS.
SPLENDID ARTICLES.
Mrs. Kirk, Bathurst, writes:—“l am highly re-
commending your Electric Corsets. They are
really splendid articles.'
BETTER THAN REPRESENTED.
Brooklyn, June 28.
Dr- Scott,—The Corsets I ordered six months ago
have worn splendidly, and have given satisfaction
every way. Tney are the best Corset I ever wore,
aside from their electric qualities, which are truly
marvellous. I suffered greatly from rheumatism
in my back and limbs; but your Electric Corsets
have entirely cured me. They are better than re-
presented.
Mrs. J. B. Babson.
RECOMMENDED.
Byron Creek, Richmond River.
Gentlemen,—Your Dr. Scott’s Electric Corset
and Belt came safely to hand. My wife finds very
great comfort through wearing your corset, and
I have not suffered from those pains in my back
that'used to worry me so before. I recommend
your goods with earnest confidence.
Yours faithfully,
T. Lea hey.
MORE RELIEF.
THEY COMB AND STILL THEY COMB.
St. Joseph’s Convent.

Gentlemen, Your Electric Corsets, which
pleased me very much, came duly to hand.
Truly yours.

CURED OF DYSPEPSIA.
Niles, Mich., January 5,1885.
Dr. Scott’s Electric Corsets have cured me of
acute dyspepsia, from which I had suffered for
eight years. His Electric Hair Brush cures my
headache every time.
Mrs. Wm. H. Peak.
WELL WORTH THE MONEY.
Mrs. Goughian, Oootamundra, writes, February
17:—“I received the Electric Corsets safely, and
am highly pleased with them. They are well
worth the money. I have also much pleaseure in
stating that I like your Electric Hair Brush very
much.”

Miss L. H. Alexander has passed the B.A.
xamination in history and political economy,
Melbourne University. A chair of millinery is
about to be established.
I A theatrical correspondent writes us, apro-
pos of a variety of things 111-assorted mar-
riages prevail In the theatrical profession. Bo
many marry who are totally unfitted for the
matrimonial state; hence, frequent trouble, and
swapping-round ensues.” ’* Swap ping-round ” is a
pretty calm expression.
A Bristol young man named Lovell, for-
bidden his lady love’s house by her father, hung
himself by his handkerchief on the knocker of his
sweetheart’s door. The old man out him down
and turned him over to the police, who ran him
into the cold unromantic gaol. You are very bad
when you love a girl up to the knocker.
He was being married, and was so confused
and nervous that he did’nt know whether he was
himself or hisitwin brother. ’Twas done, and as
the party’passed out of church, the best man
asked sympathetically “ How d’y feel now, old
hoy ? ” The bendiot pressed the plump arm linked
in his own, and murmured “ Better by half Char-
ley; better by half.”
Pause and reflect upon what follows. It
may save your life. A Collingwood (Vie.) husband
sought a dissolution of his marriage with his wife,
the other day. In the course of the evidence It
transpired that the wife was a “worker In hair.”
The dissolution was granted immediately. Never
marry a “ worker in hair.” There are enough bald-
headed men in the world.
They are raising a rumpus in Melbourne
over the decease of a 15-month-old baby. After
two doctors had done their worst for the little
innocent, a third practitioner was called in to try
his hand. Last of all, the baby died. Some of the
local gossips say it was “Injudiciously treated.”
Few will dispute the assertion. It must have been
a hardy infant to battle on so long against the two
first doctors.
The New York girls don’t think much of
the fascinating London masher, Kyrle Bellow,
once police-court reporter for the Melbourne
Herald. One daring hoarding-school-miss says
of the supernal gentleman in question:—“ Wbat
the girls see in him I can’t imagine. On the strt efc
he looks like a guy, and he walks as though he
moved by clockwork. Besides, he s au old man,
with horrid gray hair hanging down over his
shoulders. I think be is a fright.”
The Canterbury Times (N.Z.) is very
rough on applications for divorce coming before
the courts when the parties to the suit‘ are out-
rageously matched in age:—"What right have old
husbands to take up tbe time aud money i f the
country with petitions for dissolution of a union
that ought never to have been? Why should
young wives be permitted any relief from the
company (cruel, or otherwise, we need not dis-
cuss) of old men they ought never to have ac-
cepted ?”
Stuart Cumberland, now touring amongst
us, adopts a sweetly feminine method of escape
from his thought-reading difficulties. When he gets
out of sympathy with his subject acd the experi-
ment won’t come off, the wily Stuart iaiuts away
to slow music. This is a really large idea. We’ve
tried it and find it works splendidly. The other
day our irate missus put us to a severe test. She
asked us to think of what we’d been doing out up
to four o’clock that morning, and furnish an
explanation. We thought and thought without
getting any forreder, and at last we fainted off
under the ordeal. Tbe dear creature “ brought us
to” with cold water and kisses, and the paln'ul
subject has been solved sine die. It was Cumber-
land’s wrinkle. When you are stuck up with an
awkard poser—faint.

Bailarat is the cradle of first class finan-
ciers. But It is more than that—it is the mother’s
breast of eminent whisky-drinkers. An Irish
gentleman was brought before the Bench of that
enterprising city the other day on a charge of
breaking the windows of a cab, using vulgar, not
to say obscene, language, and generally making a
hyaena of himself. He pleaded not guilty. “Then,
if you are not guilty,” said the facetious presiding
magistrate, " who or what is ? ” “ The whisky of
the place, your Worship,” replied the Hibernian
hidalgo. We forget whether he got six months
or a testimonial. We think, however, it was six
months.
Lord Lecher Hawke, the distinguished
English peer, after being accused of seducing his
friend’s wife, denounced for card-sharping at the
clubs, and run in for being drunk and disorderly
in the streets, meets a pal who says. “ Dem’d bad
biz., this; whatoher going t’ do now?” “Do?”
sighs the other, “ why, there’s nothing left for me
now, old fellah, but the other world. “Whatl”
exclaims the affrighted friend, “kill yourself?”
“Kill!” replies the noble lord; “no, deah boy-I
eave for a holiday trip to Australia in the morn-
ng-that’s the form to-day.” Leaves, arrives, is
ifeted everywhere by the best society, and in a

There are evidences that a “Children’s
Column” will soon bo required for obituary
notices In the Melbourne Age. A little girl of 5
is thus affectionately remembered by her little
brother, aged 9:—
"Oh, say, is she permitted around my bed to
stand,
When guardian angels hover near, Is she of that
happy band ? ”
Fancy that sweet boy of 9 wondering if his 5
years’ old sister “ stands around ” at night.
Why doesn’t he adopt the simple device of going
to sleep with a piece of hardbake in his hand ? If
it’s still there In the morning, he’ll know that little
sister doesn’t belong to the band.
Many Australian diggers think about try-

escaped falling off the stage. The amateur led off
Fogarty several times, when Fogarty crossed
him with the right on the top of the head, and this
was about the only true hit the professional de-
livered during the bout. Mr. Seale commenced
business in earnest with the second round, visiting
Fogarty where and when he pleased, although we
never saw him fight less for the body than ne did
on Saturday night. Fogarty took bis punishment,
and It was severe, without wincing, and he ap-
peared dazed when the round terminated. The
thi-d round did not last three minutes, as the
amateur used both hands with telling effect on
Fogarty’s head, and then landed a really terrific
lei t hander lair on the mark, when Fogarty reeled
to his seat and said he could fight no longer The
amount of punishment doled out by the amateur
may be guaged by the fact that Fogarty one even-
ing stood six rounds before Jack Hall, who Is

Baseball, the “national game” of the

this side of the line, and if any of the exponents of

void as their pockets, which were mulct of 255. a

Into consideration the fact that the baseballers

so those members who didn’t get a chance to dis-
locate their jaws over Aristonlous and Zach Phelps
are beginning to lose faith in the chance of accli-
matising the “sport ”in Australia. Leaving the
merits of the game out of the question, if it is
liked by a section of the community, is it right
that it should be crushed in this manner by trustees
who were appointed with the oeject of fostering
healthy out-door sports ? athletic men are dolts,
or they would memorialise the autuoritiea on the

stand against the Wallaroos, being only two points
to the bad; but the Arfomas fairly ran over tae
Wellingtons bj 17 points to nil. A match between
the Stratnflelds and second University ended in a
win for the former by 6 points to nil, and the

“Owen,” the newspaper correspondent,
who on Saturday received his quietus by stumping
in the matoh Warwick v. 13 Surrey United, on
the following Monday described the work of
M’Donald, who stumped him, as “worthy of
Jarvis.” As a matter of taot “Owen” rushed
halt-way to the opposite wicket, to knock the
cover off a slow one of Gregory’s. It didn’t come
off, but his bails did, as a child could not have
missed taking the ball.

By cable we learn that Neil Matterson
and Godwin are unable to come to terms over the
proposed match, and that Nelson, the colonial
sculler, now In England, is to be awarded the
Humane Society’s medal for saving a little boy’s
life In the Thames. Talking of colonial scullers in
England, it will be interesting to wathh the first
impressions of the English Press—the Referee, In
particular—on the style of our William Beach.

The meeting between Brown and Wulf, in
outriggers, for £5O aside, came off on Saturday
afternoon over the champion course, Parramatta
Elver. Wulf was leading and appeared to have
the race in hand at Putney, when he fell out of
his boat owing to the carrying away of one of his
swivel rowlboks, The men are pretty sure to
meet again, when Wulf, should be make sure of
his rowiock-pins, ought to win in a canter from end
to end.

The nursery of Port Jackson yachtsmen,
as Mr. Creagh happily termed the B.A. canv«B
dingy club, wound up its season on Saturday last
with evolutions and a luncheon at Oremorne. The
mosquito fleet numbers 111 members and 33 boats,
and a right merry time tne little clippers have bad
during the past season, racing for ovei £6O worth
of prizes. Were the owners of our first-class
yachts as enthusiastic as the youngsters, we should
have some rare sport on Port Jackson waters.
* * *
It will be a grand thing in the interests of
yachting, this purchase of a clipper by the guber-
natorial Gascoigne. “Quite ‘de rigger’ now to
keep a yacht, old chappie, doncherknowl”

In the rifle competition held in Melbourne
to pick Victorians to gn to Wimbledon, Private
Allen made top score. 436; and Colonel Sleep, of
Ballarat, second with 417. Sleep went home with

The case Melbourne police v. Farnan and
Lees collapsed, and no wonder. There were con-
stables enough at the fight to stop a cyclone, but
they enjoyed the sport till 17 rounds bad been
fought, and all the stuffing knocked out of Mr.
Farnan, and next day coolly took proceedings
against the two pugilists.

“ ‘ Handsome Charlie ’ Lett, now resident
in England, by last mail sent a couple of Smith’s
photos, to Foley, one in ring costume, and the
other In mufti." Apropos ot the foregoing ex-
tract from a recently-published Bulletin sport-
ing par., “Hiram Ablff” writes:—* I take no ex-
ception to the qualificatlve aojeotive, diminutive
and apostrephlc title of Mr. Lett. But, If I re-
member aright, U.L. was, when in Sydney, secre-
tary to the society lor the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. Is he going to distribute his mercy to
Smith or the Blogger?”

The play so far in the match between the
Osborne and Wentworth clubs for the M’Quade—
sic—Cup quite justifies the opinion that the former
will make just as “holy a show” of the Went-
worths as they made of the Carltonians and others.

The “final” matoh for the N.B.W.Asso-
ciation Ground Cup will* in all probability, be
commenced on Saturday, in the Domain, when
the dispute for supremacy will be between the
Warwick and Belviaere elevens. If previous per-
formances ran be taken as a gauge the latter are
to have the £25 which is the bone of contention.

Judging from the onaraoter of the play in
the wallaroo and it sen ale football match last
Saturday, the ttugby game promises to be quite as
unlnereatlng «s on previous seasons. Ween will
a player learn that hugging the ball with the fond-
ness he might show to his best girl is not football?

During the second innings of the N.S.W.
eleven in the recent junior mter-oolonial match,
it was sarcastically remarked in the pavilion when
Toby md Brown were making their '.xcellort
stand, that tee tail have been sent la fi st, this
must have been a nasty twist for the N.S W.

The Victorian Football Association are
determined to stamp ou* the professional element
from the various clubs, but we tanoy there will be
little difficulty experienced in skimming round
the edges and corners of any rule which may be
made with regard to professionalism. One of the
dodges used to evade the rule is to appoint the
man they want tc pay for his services “ property
man." In the balance-sheet of one of the clubs
last season an item, £25, Is put down for the pay-
ment of the *' property man,” but the jok< is that
the property he had to take care of was only worth
about £9.

The S.A. Advertiser is quite pathetic
over the departure of Mr. Jack Crozier and his
stud for Victoria. ‘‘Through the aoolition of
racing,” says the Advertiser, “ South Australia
has smothered an industry on which a large num-
ber of people depended.” This is too true. Now,
what our fellow-colonists should have done was to
preserve the industry and smothered a lot of the
people who depended on it. We should have
thought, ourselves, that the “ books ” were partly
accountable for the prevailing distress in South
Australia. They’ve occasioned a good deal of dis-
tress in some newspaper offices at various times.

Since Dave Gregory’s accession to the post
of hon. seo. to the N.S W Cricket Association
that body has become considerably more popular
than previously amongst the real cricketers, ana
it is with regret we learn that tte stalwart and
genial skipper of the pioneer Australian Eleven
nas decided to throw up the position. Humour
hath it that the “ giobu>ar ’ delegate of tne
Warwicks aspires to the office.

The N.Z. Stud Co. have displayed sound
judgment in purchasing Nordeuleidt from Mr.
James White. Latest developments make it very
apparen that the Musket strain of blood is the
stoutest hitherto imported from England. Match-
lock, in particular, proves himself a better horse
the further he has to travel, aad Nordenfeldt
might have been hailed as winner ot tue last Mel-
bourne Cup if the course had been only a-quarh r
of a mile longer. Old Musket bioiseit was a com-
paratively moderate animai at any distance unoer
a mile, but at anything over two he was a *’ whale. ’
The New Zealand Company do well in sticking to
an equine family which for staying powers is pro-
bably unequalled in this or the old country.

Mr. Martin Loughlin, of Sheet Anchor
fame, has made a sporting contribution to toe
funds of an International Fancy Fair, at BaUarat.
Mr. L has presented the committee with his
steeplechaser Dundee, and the ladies—God bless

The in-and-out running of certain two-
year-olds at the a.J.C autumn meeting was some-
thing to make angels and bacaers weep Such
uncertainty among juveniles is altogether con-
trary to English precedent In the old countr>
two-year-old “form” is, speaking generally, the
easiest of turf problems to unravel. We refer
more particularly to cracks. Times out of num-
ber have the best young performers gone through
their first season without meeting defeat ana
that, too, after fulfli ing a long list of engage
meats. Last season the Bard won the whole 16
races he started for. Thus it comes about tfiai
long odds are systematically laid on crack two-
year-olds with a confidence that is justified by
results They may turn shifty with age, but the
young English thoroughbreds, with few excep-
tions, are innocent, and run “true.'’ The oftene*
they meet the more surely is their relative torm
confirmed. Owing to some unexplained causes,how
ever, it is evident tnat the ottener crack Austra-
lian youngsters race together tne mure completely
does tue guileless public get muddled. The several
performances ot Blairgowrie. Maddelina, Acme,
Chesharo, Volcano, Trident, and Philip augusuih
have been quite too perplexing. If they continue
their eccentricities through next season the Aus-
tralian backer will become extinct—like the dodo

Carnrick’s Cod Liver Oil&Milk
„. v , PEPTONISED (DIGESTED.)
■highly recommended fey the Medical Profession throughout the world as being
the best remedy for Coughs, Colds, Bronchitis, Scrofula, Wasting
Diseases, Consumption, General Debility, over-taxed brains, &c., &o.
It will produce an Immediate gain in flesh and strength.
Can be taken when all other forms of Cod Liver Oil are refused.
It equal parts of the best Norwegian Cod Liver Oil and concen-
trated fresh milk, both peptonised (digested).
The peptonised milk disguises the unpleasant taste and smell of the oil. and
makes ifc as sweet as cream; very palatable and most nourishing.
invaluable for children, and will agree with the most delicate persons, causing
no return or unpleasantness.
One trial will satisfy anyone of the great value of this new and unique pre-
paration.
The reconstructive or nutritive properties are five times greater than the
plain oil or any pther Emulsion, hence it is much cheaper.
Both the Oil and the Milk being digested, the whole will assimilate, whereas
in Cod Liver Oil and other Emulsions (being undigested) only a small
proportion is of any value. Ifc is the most nerfect Emulsion ever
made, and the only one of digested Cod Liver Oil and Milk.
Analysed and recommended by the first Professors in Europe.
We also manufacture the above preparation combined with Hypophosphites
of Lime and Soda. SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS.

Important to Mothers Moms
Carnrick’s Soluble Food for Infants, Invalids,
and Aged Persons, is the most nutritious, palatable, and easily-digested Infant’s
Pood ever manufactured, containing fifty per cent, of the solids of milk (digested),
and fifty per cent, of the finest wheat, converted into soluble form.
A most perfect food. The nearest approach to Mother’s Milk ever made.
It is unequalled for the formation of fat, flesh, and bone, and increasing
the vital forces SO necessary to health.
Specially recommended in cases of Marasmus, Diarrhoea, and Cholera
Infantum, and where the digestion is defective.
Children fed upon cereals or cow’s milk alone very often remain weak, and
suffer from softening of the bones, and when attacked by infantile iis-
orders are unable to resist the inroads of disease.
“CARNRICK’S SOLUBLE POOD” is invaluable for Invalids
and Aged Persons (who cannot digest farinaceous food), as it is rich
in nutritive and easily-digested albumenoids, thus increasing both flesh
and strength, and restoring the vital forces.
It is most convenient for use,being in a powdered form, and will keep indefinitely.
When boiled and stirred for three minutes it is ready for immediate use.

ROWLANDS’ ODONTO is the best, purest
and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such
Rowlands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
ROWLANDS BUKONIA is a beautifully
pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet nowder, and
has lately been much improved. Each box has
inside the lid a certificate of purity from Dr.
Redwood, PhD , F.C.S., &c. Sold in three tints :
white, rose, and cream.
ROWLANDS’ MA ASSAR OIL can now
be also had in a golden colour, which is especially
suites for fair or golden-haired children and per-
sons. Four sizes.
Ask any dealer in perfumery for Rowlands’
articles, of 30 Hatton Garden, London, and avoid

CONVINCE
WILL convince you of the wonder-
ful curative properties combined in
Dr. Bell’s Bitters, if the remarkable
cures that have been effected by its use fail to impress
upon your mind this repeatedly proven fact. Thous-
ands are using it,
it is a medicine
even more than
and all declare that
possessing all and
we claim for it. My
friend, if you are sick, or in that condition that you
cannot call yourself either sick or well, go and get a
bottle of Dr. Bell’s Bitters, and realise yourself how
this medicine hits the
right spot, and puts all
the machinery of your
body into working order.
One of our prominent business men said to us the
other day : “In the spring my wife got all run down
and could not eat anything'; passing a store I saw a
lot of Dr. Bell’s Bitters in the window, and I got a
bottle. After she had been taking it a week she had
a rousing’ appetite, and it did her a world of good.
She took three bottles, and it was the best investment
ever made.”
DO YOU KNOW
That the very best Blood Purifier and Spring Medi-
cine is Dr. Bell’s Bitters.
That it cures Biliousness, Indigestion, Dyspepsia,
Headache, and Kidney and Liver Complaints.
That it is a wonderful medicine for Restoring- and
sharpening the Appetite.
That it cures Scrofula, Salt Rheum, Boils, Pimples,
or other Diseases of the Blood.
If you suffer from any of these affections, try Dr.
Bell’s Bitters at once.
Dr. Bell’s Bitters as a Blood Purifier has no equal.
It tones the system, strengthens and invigorates,
giving new life.
The highest Medical Authorities pronounce it the
o ily known Specific for Kidney, Liver and Urinary
Diseases; thatit.has no equal as a BLOOD PURIFIER,
that it is the best safeguard against Contagious
Diseases, both acute and chronic, keeping the KID-
NEYS and LlVER—the great organs of the body-
in healthy condition, disease then being impossible.
Note. —Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, or Old People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously upon written application to
the Agents, accompanied by a certificate of a Minister
of the G ospel, certifying that they are unable to pay
for medicine.

.'ipHEJRE are many men In this colony who are,
■ day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early Indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering hi« existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this Invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Enloying Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system—regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfli his most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, and require no
restraint or hindrance from business. Pamphlets
enclosed in each case with testimonials.
In cases at 135., or four quantities in one, for 365.;
if by coach, 3s. 6d. extra. City and suburbs free.
