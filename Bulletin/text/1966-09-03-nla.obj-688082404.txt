Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves

excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy

COONAWARRA ESTATE
Coonawarra Estate is the original “Coonawarra”. This famous vineyard
was founded in 1890 (an illustration of the original cellars appears on
every label of genuine Coonawarra Estate wine). Years of careful culti-
vation have consistently produced vintage wines of exceptional quality.

LETTERS
lullaby Lads and Lasses
Sir,
Your ambidextrous feature writer,
Brian Buckley, is already becoming
notorious for his spleenish reporting on
a surprising variety of subjects. But
his effort on the Australian Dissenters
of 1966 (8., August 13) is his best so
far in shoddy, slovenly punctuated,
and badly written, political journalism.
However, from his chaotic ragbag of
cliches and facile political generalisa-
tions, one thing at least is clear: Buck-
ley doesn’t like the politics of those on
the left of him. One would expect,
though, that he could express his views
with more coherence and intelligence.
It happens that, although as a dis-
senter I stand left of centre, I rate
Orwell highly, am not a mindless drop-
out —nor do I keep their company. I
see the need for Western military
defense [sic], and I do not have an in-
herited hatred of capitalism. If Buckley
wants to criticise those who dissent
fair enough. But right now he needs to
be dragged screaming and kicking into
the field of intelligent, responsible jour-
nalism and maybe THE BULLETIN
should be given a nudge, too.
JOHN HOOKER
Prahran (Vic.)
Sir,
I may be a “tired old rump” (though
not of the Stalinist left), and I cer-
tainly don’t like Coca-Cola. However,
there is no “strong will to storm the
commanding heights occupied ... by
the Australian Establishment,” and
there are indeed positive likes for so
many of the things Brian Buckley thinks
must be disliked by his “Lullaby Lads
and Lasses” (8., August 13). Such as
President Johnson, Western military
defence, Hollywood, and George
Orwell, to name a few. And I read
“Dissent” (though the other magazines
only sporadically).
Could it be that Mr. Buckley’s lum-
pen lefties are not as accurately pinned
down as they might be? Or that he’s
mistaken in the way he lumps them
together? And he must know that to
say “Dissent” views China “through a
misty film of sentiment” is absolute
tosh, when even his own evidence uses

Incidentally, wouldn’t Mr. Buckley also
ca ll himself a “dissenter”? As such,
I would like to see him place himself
so firmly in a similarly black-and-white
categorisation.
PATRICIA HEALY
South Yana (Vic.)
Mr. lan Marsh (8., August 27) and
I are in agreement on one thing. The
article on the Dissenters should have
been longer, and, in fact, was before
it suffered editorial cuts. The editor
presumably thought the matter not
worth any more space. Although I dis-
agree, I can see strong arguments in
his favor. The strongest is that the
views of the Dissenters on domestic
problems, much of which I would sup-
port, on balance cannot be taken very
seriously, given their nineteenth cen-
tury attitudes to foreign policy and de-
fence. Mr. Marsh accurately describes
one of the major problems: The Dis-
senters’ “failure to recognise the charac-
ter and significance of modern totali-
tarianism.” Richard Walker described
the latter in THE BULLETIN, August
20, if Mr. Marsh cares to read him.

Who Wants War?
Sir,
Nobody except a madman would
wish to glorify war, especially the seek-
and-destroy type of conflict now gather-
ing impetus in Vietnam.
Just what right Americans, Austra-
lians, and New Zealanders have in be-
ing on this foreign soil is a policy
matter for their governments. Accord-
ingly, all the street-corner gossip, bar-
room arguments or student discussions
on this score can’t change things.
What now matters is that, irrespec-
tive of the war’s duration or ultimate
outcome, the upheaval is costing dearly
in human life, suffering, and misery
for all involved: servicemen, relatives,
and closer friends. Yet there are many
in the community who seem to regard
battle reports with cynicism, scepticism,
even scorn; or they prefer to dismiss
the reports as the inevitable result of
intrusion by the ANZUS partners into
affairs of no concern to them.
Surely, anyone save the couldn’t-
care-less individual must concede that
thousands of men . . . most of whom
would prefer to be back home are
making stoical sacrifices in the service
of their country and their fellow citi-
zens as well.
Australia’s rating in the eyes of the
world has been given a tremendous
upsurge by virtue of the heroism and
superb fighting qualities of her troops.
Where would it be possible to find in
all the annals of warfare a more soul-
stirring epic of courage than last
week’s fight at Baria, east of Saigon,
where 150 gallant youngsters many
of them National Servicemen took
the honors against odds of roughly

eight to one. Seventeen of them will
never see their homeland again!
But their sacrifice has not been in
vain because it has added a wider
conception of ANZAC throughout the
world. Added to this factor is the
team spirit between the Americans
and their allies from Down Under,
which should make it clear to other
Powers that here are two brotherhoods.
None of our kith and kin in Viet-
nam has gone there to seek medals
or glory, so perhaps the best tribute
we could pay to the dead and those
who will survive the conflict would be
to spare them and their families an
occasional thought. What better
niemorial?
RUPERT BEAUMONT
Mosman (N.S.W.)
The Action at Baria
Sir,
Consider some of the facts reported
by the ABC and daily Press relating to
the action at Baria.
The action was engaged about 3.45
p.m. and lasted three hours. Air sup-
port dropped thirty-five tons of bombs
on the attacking force. Artillery sup-
port from Australian, New Zealand,
and American units fired 3000 shells
into the combat area. Helicopters
dropped supplies when available ammu-
nition was almost exhausted. Armored
personnel carriers came up and helped
turn the tide of battle.
One may well ask questions. With all
respect to those concerned, it does not
seem that the survivors would welcome
over-simplification or distortion of the
facts. With such an intense support
from air and artillery units, is it con-
tended that their efforts achieved not
one enemy killed? Is it not most likely
that the greater percentage of enemy
losses was due to support and not
directly to “young Diggers”? Might not
the most optimistic proportionate “kill
rate” for a unit caught in ambush be
below four to one, giving an optimum
ratio of about 70 enemy dead as a
result of defensive action?
Other questions occur: why did our
men so deplete ammunition? Rain not-
withstanding, were communications and
supply lines over-extended? Was the
official handout intended to divert
attention from a near disaster?
D. G. CORNWELL
Neutral Bay (N.S.W.)
[There is no doubt that a large per-
centage of Communist casualties was
the result of air and artillery support,
but that does not in any way detract
from the heavy contribution of the in-
fantry to the victory. The Australian
unit was not ambushed but caught the
enemy in camp during aggressive
patrolling and the kill ratio was not
4 to 1 but at least 245 enemy dead
(the figure from the body-count alone)
to 17 Australian dead. There was no
question of an over-extended supply
line: helicopter re-supply is nowadays
routine and in this action the fighting
took place only four miles from the
Australian base camp.—Editor.]

The Orr Case
Sir,
It is indeed heartening to discover
that the swift purge of mirth is still
active in the rolling mills of inflexible
gravity and juvenile acrimoniousness
which constitute so much of the cor-
respondence spread for consumption,
like sour lard, in the pages of the Aus-
tralian Press. On one of my rare ex-
cursions into those pages I am lucky
enough to be treated to a comforter
Mr. Tim Bowden’s letter (8., Aug. 13).
It will be most amusing indeed if
THE BULLETIN does not commit the
immoral error of stifling a beautiful
spate of molten controversy by printing
only the first letter. Let us, the readers,
suck up the satisfaction of sitting back
while dozens of irate supporters of
Orr’s case fling the scalding sulphur
of their fury over the hapless victim.
I pity the ones who cannot see the real
reason for the letter it is so funny.
PETER LOFTUS
Adelaide (S.A.)
Sir,
Saddened though I was by Tim
Bowden’s apparent lack of generosity
toward the late Professor Orr (8.,
August 13), I was cheered up consid-
erably to note that even he has the
decency to admit that “It is a pity
that the University mishandled the
manner of Orr’s dismissal.”
That precisely is the issue the
impropriety of the University’s action
in summarily dismissing Professor Orr.

Hugh McCrae’s Verse
Sir,
After reading the review of Hugh
McCrae’s latest collection of verse, I
wondered whether anyone else has pre-
served cuttings of early BULLETIN
poems, as I have. Among them is a
short lyric by Mcßae, “The Deserted
Lover.”
Now that poets write from the head
rather than the heart, and have be-
come quite clinical, we are not likely
to have lyrics like this again unless
poets get into reverse and stage a
revolution.
The date of the lyric is not noted
in my private Anthology, but it begins:
“I have not died nor withered yet”
and it is certainly a classic. When is
music going to be brought back into
verse? Without music, poetry is as flat
and stale.

On Film Criticism
Sir,
Pondering on the short review of
Arthur Penn’s “The Chase” (8., Aug.
8), the only item pertaining to the film
I could find “almost claustrophobically
urban” was Beverly Tivey’s review. A
total of three short paragraphs can
hardly be termed a criticism when the
minuteness in size was not used as a

poignant dismissal. Undoubtedly the
majority of THE BULLETIN’S
readers must be urban dwellers and I
wonder if Miss Tivey felt any pangs of
claustrophobia while condensing re-
views of three films into what must have
amounted to a total of one column.
Film criticism has been widely dis-
cussed and debated. There has been no
universally accepted criterion on which
to base a review except the acknowl-
edged point that a critic should possess
enthusiasm and love for the medium
he criticises, encouraging as many
people as possible to partake of the
same pleasures which he himself has ex-
perienced. This appears impossible to
attain with a few words. A section de-
voted to films which is encumbered
appears to me as being devoid of sin-
cerity, and nothing but pretentious. It is
time lovers of the cinema campaigned
for the treatment of cinema as a serious
art form.

OF.0 F . all the learned and honorable
judges who permanently or tem-
porarily occupy the giddy eminence
of a seat on the bench of the Sup-
reme Court there is none of them so
liable to this frailty as Mr. Justice
Windeyer. It has been his mental mis-
fortune all his life to lack logical
acumen. Had he condemned the stric-
tures of the EVENING NEWS instead
of moving the machinery of the law—
more particularly that portion of it
which is rustiest and longest out of
use —to punish the proprietors of the
journal for Contempt he would have
saved himself some humiliation and
the whole British public the spectacle
of three judges, sitting in Banco, and
a big bar of juris-consults wasting
the best part of two days in a forensic
discussion on an old charge with a
new face, and which will take nearly
a week’s judicial meditation—three
judges a-thinking before a conclu-
sion can be arrived at. When will these
vague powers of “pulling” and “pluck-
ing” and “punishing” people for their
Contempt of Court cease in this
colony? They are obsolete in England
and unused in the neighboring colony
of Victoria.


Enthronement
Sydney's new Archbishop, Archbishop
Marcus Loane, delivers his address.
Archbishop Loane recalled the early
history of the Church of England in
Australia, then said that the Asian
countries "challenged the spirit of
Samuel Marsden today."
During the enthronement, Archbishop Loane is welcomed by the
bishops of the Archdiocese, by a senior Archdeacon on behalf of
the clergy, by a lay representative of the diocese and by two chil-
dren. The children said, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
A meeting which has been acclaimed as an historic exercise in ecumenism. Archbishop Loane talks with
the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Gilroy, and the Assistant Bishop of the Greek
Orthodox Church, Bishop Dionysios Nazianzou, after the enthronement ceremony. Pictures by Don Cameron


How to read a cork
and astound your friends
Tonight, when you coax the stopper
from a bottle of your favourite wine,
spare a few moments and consider
the cork.
It may seem an insignificant object,
dull and mundane, but it has an
interesting story to tell.
It started its life as a tiny part of the
craggy bark covering a majestic tree
in Portugal. Tonight, it will have com-
pleted its task, and have nothing
before it but an ignominious trip to
the dust bin.
What was this task? A vital one in the
maturing and ageing of your wine. It
created a seal that was not a seal . . .
a barrier that prevented the wine from
escaping, but at the same time
allowed just the right amount of air
to enter the bottle and mature the
wine correctly.
You could say that the relationship
between air and wine is much the
same as between salt and food. Too
much can spoil the final result
too little leaves the best flavour
unrealised.
You see, cork is porous. It is naturally
s 2

I

P
1
honeycombed with thousands of
minute air passages that allow the
wine to reach through to the air it
needs to “age” properly. Air (or
rather the oxygen in the air) gives the
wine its chance to reach adulthood
and develop the full character you
expect from your wine.
If you look closely you can see the
tiny holes. As a matter of fact, if the
wine you're serving happens to be a
red this will be easier, because the
natural tannins of the red wine will
have stained the cork showing you
where the wine has been. The depth
of this stain penetration is your in-
dication of the ‘bottle age’ of the
wine.
So how do you read a cork? If it’s too
moist the wine might be “pricked” or
sour tasting. If there’s a web-like
substance inside the cork it has prob-
ably been attacked by the cork moth.
If the cork is too dry, the wine has
been improperly stored it has been
left standing uprightand the wine has
not had a chance to reach through
the cork for its ration of air.
Actually, you don’t have to worry
about the cork if the wine comes from
Penfolds. Every Penfolds cork is care-
fully selected and inspected many
times before it reaches your bottle
department or liquor store.
Tonight, give the cork its due consid-
eration. Judge it to see that it has
done its appointed job. Then dispose
of it kindly. (Some people even keep
a collection.)
The wines that need particular atten-
tion to corking and uncorking
are the classic table wines (such as
Penfolds famous Dalwood or Eden
Valley wines). Choose them carefully,
store them carefully, draw the cork
carefully. Your attention is rewarded
by the wine itself particularly if it is
Penfolds.

Face of the Week
The RSL national executive wrote
in “strongest possible protest” to
Prime Minister Holt, demanding a
supplementary Budget to cover war
pension rises. The DLP decided to
base its election campaign on Aus-
tralia’s defence and security. In
Brisbane, the Queensland Industrial
Court declared invalid “closed shop”
trade unionism. The Broadcasting
Control Board began hearing appli-
cations for three new commercial
radio licences in Queensland. The
Australian-built ore carrier Bogong,
55,000 tons, was launched at
Whyalla, and Evans Deakin of Bris-
bane won its third contract to
build a roll-on ship for the ANL.
A possible America’s Cup yacht,
Dame Pattie, was launched in
Sydney to compete against Gretel
and Vim. The Melbourne Zoo
opened a new $20,000 one-mile
enclosure for its lions. Operation
New Members was launched by the
CMF.
★
The Federal Government decided
to spend $200,000 on a survey of
Cockburn Sound in W.A. as a pos-
sible new naval base. In Queens-
land, a survey of child delinquency
cases found that a 20 percent in-
crease had occurred, with last year’s
cases (1406) equalled in this year’s
first nine months. In Sydney, the
Supreme Court awarded $Bl,OOO to a
former CMF commando for spinal
injuries received in a fall during
cliff-climbing. An East Oakleigh,
Melbourne, family were haunted all
week by a mysterious knocking at
night, and crowds of curious people
by day. U'gal and finance experts
of the US Navy arrived in Canberra
to find solutions to the contract
problems at North West Cape com-
munications project. Air Minister
Howse announced that Australia’s
24 Fill bombers would cost
another $2.3 million, making the
total estimate about $lB6 million.
★
While supporting the Govern-
ment’s Vietnam commitment, Vic-
torian MHR Mr. S. J. Benson
(ALP) also said the Commonwealth
should insure every soldier serving
overseas. Robbery of the week was
the strongroom breaking of a
branch bank in Melbourne, yield-
ing $33,000. Joyce Grenfell was
playing in Adelaide. The Federal
Government proposed a Bill to re-
move Public Service conditions
affecting women employees who
marry.

SEPTEMBER 3, 1966
The First 60 Years...
IT IS too soon to start cheering
over the Federal Government’s
announcement last week about
the possibility of building naval
support facilities at Cockburn
Sound, 16 miles from Fremantle.
There has been no decision to
build a base, merely to see whether
a base, initially very small, is cap-
able of being built in a particular
area. We are months away from a
survey, many more from a decision,
and years from any actual con-
struction. But since it is over 60
years since the Navy first began
discussing the possibility of a base
in the West, it can at least rejoice
that it has finally persuaded the
Government to take a late, very
tentative step in the right direc-
tion.
Mr. Holt’s announcement is also
timely — ; and not simply because
there will be an election in Novem-
ber. It was made at a moment
when our few naval dockyards are
working at full peacetime
capacity and it comes on the eve
of Mr. Holt’s visit to London for
the Commonwealth Prime Minis-
ters’ meeting, where he can now
reassure Britain (and perhaps
warn Singapore) that we are be-
ginning to think about providing
a naval alternative to Singapore
should this become necessary. Such
reassurance is imperative if we
hope to persuade Britain to main-
tain its presence East of Suez.
Referring to both the British and
American Navies, Mr. Holt said:
“While the investigation will be
directed primarily to the require-
ments of the RAN, it will, of
course, take into account the pos-
sible need of Allied navies for use
of the proposed facilities.”
Yet as THE BULLETIN has
often argued, we need a naval
base in Western Australia irres-
pective of what happens in Singa-
pore. It is absurd that there is no
naval dockyard and only very
limited civilian facilities for some
10,000 miles of our coastline from
Melbourne to Brisbane. Fremantle
would seem the obvious site: as
the Navy points out, at the
moment RAN ships off the
Western Australian coast now have
to come to Garden Island, Sydney,
for supplies and maintenance (and
last year a ship which had a major
breakdown off the Western Aus-
tralian coast had to be towed to
Hong Kong for repairs!). Fre-
mantle has the power, the water,
the industrial back-up, and the
manpower. It is also a long way
from South-East Asia. It is at the
end of the Indian Ocean shipping
(including oil tankers) routes,
across which some 50 percent of
our external trade travels.
The Minister for Transport and
Shipping, Mr. Freeth, has put im
a plea for Albany instead of Cock-
burn Sound as the site for a base.
But although Albany has a mag-
nificent harbor, it has none of the
other advantages of Fremantle.
There would also be a good case
for developing a single large port
in the North-west, perhaps in the
King Bay area, instead of the two
or three small ones now operating,
but there, even more than at Al-
bany, the problems and cost of
installing the necessary indus-
trial capacity would be immense.
Cockburn Sound and Fremantle
are the ideal choice, even if it has
taken 60 years for the Government
to realise it.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Labor’s Shrinking Centre
The atmosphere is strange for election year. Even if they have no chance of
winning, parliamentarians usually can hypnotise themselves into believing that
they are going to win. But few in the Labor Party believe that there is going to
he a change of government on November 26.
Even before Captain Sam Benson
turned his bucket on Labor’s Left
wing imposed Vietnam and defence
policy, the Labor parliamentarians were
proceeding on the basis that when they
returned to Parliament they would
sit on the left-hand side of the Speaker s
chair and face a Liberal-Country Part,
coalition entrenched in Commonwealth
r c ~ w , • |
power for a further three years. While
they had an intense interest in the out-
come of their forthcoming elections as
far as their personal survival was con-
cerned, they were working on the
leadership position.
This in itself is a yardstick to their
electoral expectations. Opposition
Leader, Arthur Calwell, has announced
that he will retire from Labor leader-
ship only if Labor is defeated. If
Labor wins and is returned with
sufficient numbers to form a Govern-
ment, he will continue as leader and
as Prime Minister. Deputy Opposition
Leader, Gough Whitlam, has already
shown concern with this defeatist
psychology and its possible effect upon
the fortunes of the Labor Party at
the coming elections. When asked to
comment on the fact that Dr. Jim
Cairns had announced he would be a
candidate against Whitlam when the
opportunity came, Whitlam noted
tartly that he was sure Cairns was not
making his decision on the assumption
that Labor could not win the coming
elections.
But the belief that Labor cannot win
is widespread in the Labor Party. It
is against the backdrop of this belief
that the factions are formulating their
leadership plans.
Accepting for the purpose of dis-
cussion only that this pessimistic thesis
is correct and that a Labor leadership
struggle will immediately follow the
elections, it is interesting to note that
there has been quite a significant
development within the Federal Par-
liamentary Labor Party over recent
months. In a recent interview, Whit-
,am said ; , e accuratel that the Par .
r . T , l i
hamentary Labor Party, like Gaul,

™ ithbl the Part J J had increasingly

'J'HE vote for the Senate leadership
ballot pointed this up. Under the
new system of Caucus voting there is
less room for minor deals to squeeze
unwanted individuals out than there has
been in the past when the voting was
by exhaustive ballot. With only one
ballot and the distribution of pre-
ferences of those eliminated, there is
no room for ad hoc deals. It is the
bloc votes that count. It is a much
more clear-cut decision,
In the Senate leadership ballot,
Senator Reg Bishop, a well-regarded
South Australian, was both Whitlam’s
“pea” and the representative of the
Centre. He got ten votes. Senator Don
Willesee, Right winger and the ultimate
winner, got the Right wing’s bloc vote,
There was dissension on the Left and
Senator Lionel Murphy and Senator
Sam Cohen, both regarded with favor
by the Left wing, split the Left wing
vote. But the Left wing bloc vote was
so big that, even split, it enabled both
Gough Whitlam-will he win the defeat?
Murphy and Cohen to head Bishop, the
.moderates’ nominee.
When the struggle had developed into
an ideological one both Right and
Left wings knew they could ignore
Bishop. Their bloc votes were suf-
ficiently large and the Centre had
contracted so much that they knew
they could squeeze him out. His prim-
ary votes therefore became unimpor-
tant. Only his preferences mattered.
And, as the Right wing accurately
worked out, faced with the alternative
of either supporting a Left wing-backed
candidate or a Right wing-backed can-
didate the bulk of the Bishop support-
ers gave their second preferences to
Willesee, who received eight of Bishop’s
ten votes.
This now clearly discernible con-
traction in the numbers of the Party’s
centre is to some degree due par-
ticularly as far as the Right wing’s
vote is concerned to events now
taking place within the Labor Party.
While it would be premature to say
that the ALP machine wheel is turn-
ing in favor of the Right wing there
are signs that the wheel could turn.
With ex-Western Australian Mr. F.
E. Chamberlain sick, and at least tem-
porarily out of action, the Left wing
has lost probably its most able tactician
and Western Australia shows signs of
reverting to Right wing control. Now
that State Aid has been removed from
the Party arena South Australia, which
was strongly anti-State Aid, is less sus-
ceptible to Left wing exploitation.
N.S.W. and Tasmania, both Right
wing, are starting to fight instead of
pretending that they are Centre, a
pretence that endured while the Left
wing was unmistakably and unchal-
lengeably dominant Federally, in an
attempt to keep the Left wing off
their backs.
It has become known that in Vic-
toria, the Left wing’s bastion of power,
a “shadow” executive has been set up
with the object of replacing the present
Left wing executive after the next
elections. If the “shadow” executive
succeeds in this aim, the wheel will
undoubtedly start turning in the Right
wing’s favor both in the ALP machine
and within the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party.
But the erosion of the Centre has
put Whitlam in a position where
ultimately, when the leadership con-
frontation takes place, he will have to
go along with the Right wing. If he
does not he could finish in the same
position as Bishop squeezed out of
ihe leadership ballot by a Right wing
nominee on one hand and the Left
wing nominee (who will probably be
Cairns, but who could still be Frank
Crean) on the other hand.
In this situation, the odd position
exists that both the Left wing and
Right wing are working out how many
Right-wingers and Left-wingers could
be casualties at the next elections rather
than exuberantly working out, as is
usually the case, how many seats the
Opposition stands to win.
ALAN REID


A Low Ebb in Victoria
Five years ago, and also early in September, THE BULLETIN published Peter
Kelly’s definitive ABC of the Victorian ALP. At the time, Kelly’s judgment was
quite definite.
“The Victorian Party’s branch
membership is dying; its finances have
never been lower; its union affiliation
fees remain static; in each election it
loses more votes to the DLP; its anti-
Catholicism is so bitter a special
Masonic Lodge functions within the
Trades Hall; its political nepotism is
so blatant that even the electors are
turning away from those members who
have been given safe electoral seats by
their colleagues; and it is so com-
promised by continued collaboration
with Communists on unity tickets and
in pseudo-peace organisations that it is
little less than a Co,mmunist front
itself.”
In 1961 membership had fallen 9000
in three years down to 14,700; union
affiliation fees had dropped to about
£13,500. And so far as Kelly and
nearly all other professional observers
were concerned, the whole machine had
bottomed firmly and coldly on rock.
Having reached rock bottom, the Vic-
torian ALP adopted the motto of
Montaigne that in public affairs there
is no state so bad, provided it has age
and stability, that is not preferable to
change and disturbance.
Except that there has been a kind
of change: the bottom has lowered. The
Victorian ALP still does the same
things, but there is less of it and that
relatively poorer. Membership of the
Party has now fallen to about 7000
(minus the one they are losing this
week), which makes it about half as
big as the DLP, and a third as large
as the State Liberal Party. And it is
broke a situation which produces
great fighters in the ring, but poor
fighters before an electorate con-
ditioned to television and metropolitan
papers.
The balance sheet produced at the
last conference showed a small sur-
plus but, in fact, the Party is certainly
in the red and the most common figure
quoted at the Trades Hall is £4OOO.
Unless substantial assistance comes
gratuitously from the larger Left-wing
unions, the Victorian Party will soon
be unable to pay its staff, some of the
better informed of whom are already
very nervous on pay days.
If the financial situation is difficult
even for routine administration, it is
desperate for electoral purposes. The
Party has no reserves and it cannot
rely on support from the moderate
unions who are alienated from the
present ALP leadership and will not
give more than their affiliation fees.
Mr. Mick Jordan, the Secretary of
the Melbourne Trades Hall Council,
captured the feeling of the moderate
union leaders when he told the recent
ALP State Conference that he was not
particularly anxious that he or his
friends should win seats on the ALP
State Executive when this would mean
their sitting alongside men “who vote
with the Communists at the Trades Hall
every Thursday night.”
Perhaps even more serious for elec-
tion finances has been the drying up of
the Party “slush fund.” This fund con-
sists of donations from manufacturers,
breweries, and other friends of Labor.
Some manufacturers believe the ALP
is to some extent their ally in the area
of protective tariffs, and the breweries
are concerned with excise tax. The
ALP, of course, makes no promises, the
ritual formula is “no guarantees but
the door will always be open.”
In the final months of the Chifley
Government the “slush fund” was at
its biggest, and most of the ALP cam-
paign for the 1949 election was fin-
anced out of it. Now, however, many
of Labor’s former friends in capitalism
feel that Labor’s electoral prospects are
so dim as to make substantial con-
tributions to the Party a poor invest-
ment.
The Victorian Party must rely heavly
on Left wing union donations between
now and the election, but even here
there are problems. A number of Com-
munist and pro-Communist union
leaders do not care to see Labor do
well in this election: they realise that
the smaller the Labor Federal Caucus
the better the chances of Dr. Cairns
beating Mr. Whitlam in the 1967
Caucus ballot for the leadership. If
the ALP wins seats at the next elec-
tion the new members will be mostly
Whitlam supporters. Therefore the
Left wing unions will not do anything
grandiose about the election fund.
fro,m its financial problems
the Victorian Party has large ad-
ministrative troubles looming. Many of
the sub-committees of the executive are
notoriously inefficient in their tasks, but,
more importantly, the State Secretary,
Mr. Bill Hartley, no doubt affected by
the weaknesses of his executive assis-
tants, has been showing signs of impati-
ence and the chief executive officers
fear they may have to look for a new
secretary in the near future.
Mr. Hartley has always found the
constant public criticisms of his Party
hard to bear and he has shown obvious
signs of depression at the Party’s con-
tinuous decline in power and prestige.
The recent illness of Mr. F. E. Cham-
berlain has separated Mr. Hartley from
his former constant adviser and the
tactical confusion in which he em-
broiled the Left wing at the recent
Federal conference is only one of the
results of the absence of Mr. Cham-
berlain.
Mr. Hartley’s current mood was dis-
played last month when, after the ALP
newspaper, “Fact,” settled out of court
with Mr. John Bennetts, political cor-
respondent of the “Age,” for an edi-
torial in “Fact” over which Mr. Ben-
Gordon Bryant will he lose Wills?
netts had taken legal action, Mr. Hart-
ley released a Press statement accusing
the “Age” of printing an article which
was “false, malicious, and completely
at variance with the truth.” The article
in the “Age” referred to a decision of
the Victorian ALP Executive to try
to force Mr. Sam Benson to leave the
Defend Australia Committee under
threat of expulsion.
The “Age” report far from being
“false, malicious, and completely at
variance with the truth” may turn out
to have been true and accurate in
detail. In any case, a senior member
of the ALP Executive had “leaked”
the story.
In terms of numbers, organisation,
finance, and administration the Vic-
torian Party is at its lowest ebb and ,may
see further seats lost in the November
Federal election. The most likely losses
are Batman (either to Mr. Benson stand-
ing as an Independent or to the Liberal
Party), and Bendigo, which is now held
by the able pro-Whitlam man Mr. Beat-
on. But Mr. Gordon Bryant could be
in trouble in Wills if a general Labor
voting decline is added to ALP loss of
face over local issues (namely the
recent actions of Labor Caucus in a
local council), and Dr. Cairns could
face a difficult task in Yarra because
of population and class changes in the
district. Mr. Courtnay, in Darebin, is
also worried about his prospects. After
those the ALP has only Messrs. Calwell,
Crean, Pollard, Peters, and Mclvor
left.
1966 is the 75th anniversary year of
the Victorian ALP. It seems certain
to be reduced to eight and may go
down to five seats in the House of Rep-
resentatives. Perhaps the latter disaster
could provide the opportunity for the
Jordan supporters in the Trades Hall,
the white-collar union leaders now con-
templating ALP affiliation, and the in-
tellectuals and professional men gath-
ered around “Labor comment,” “Dis-
sent,” and the Fabian Society to make
another bid to restore the Party. Unless
they do these may be no 100th anni-
versary of the Victorian ALP.

Due Credit
Australia, like England, is a nation
of shopkeepers. The shoppers them-
selves are credited with being amongst
the most discerning and sophisticated
in the world, and by the end of 1966
they had better be honest as well.
Before December of this year the
Credit Reference Association of New
South Wales Limited will have been
launched from the office of the Retail
Traders’ Association of New South
Wales, and it will take nothing more
than a three-minute phone call to check
ai U cre dit risk,
A ready-reference credit bureau, the
new. association will be a non-profit
making co-operative of retailers, par-
ticularly those in the city and suburbs,
but embracing country towns as well.
All the existing information on custo-
mers now filed as classified in store
credit departments will become corn-
mon property, administered over by
twenty telephonists. To begin with, a
card-index system carrying code num-
bers will hold the information, but later
this may be replaced by an electronic
system. The card index has been very
successful overseas, but new methods
may be needed when the association
hits its stride.
At the present time interested re-
tailers are filling out a questionnaire
asking them to estimate the number
of queries they would need answered
in a day, and whether they would be
using a telephone, a courier, or mak-
ing requests by mail; when the peak-
loading would be expected and which
day of the week would be their busiest.
One leading store estimates 12,000 in-
quiries a day.
The retailers will be given a code
number, and there will be numbers on
the individual cards as well. This,
according to Mr. J. B. Griffin, Secre-
tary of the Retail Traders’ Association
of N.S.W., will prevent unauthorised
persons from obtaining information. “In
this way neighbors will be prevented
from checking on each other, and so
forth.”
Mr. Griffin has been a long-time
advocate of the Credit Bureau system.
He first raised the matter in 1938, but
the war intervened, and the years
after the war did not seem to be a
propitious time. The recessions and
booms of the last ten years have created
a different picture. The H. G. Palmer
case, now being heard, puts a search-
light on the matter of bad debts. But
theirs is only one of hundreds of simi-
lar cases, where both large and small
companies have been dragged down by
bad debts.
M R - GRIFFIN made a special trip
overseas to investigate the credit-
bureau systems in America, Canada,
and England.* He came back fired with
enthusiasm, and the Retail Traders’
Association, which first met in the
last century, decided to take a new
direction and form their own bureau.
They are possibly the only industrial
or trade association in the world to
have formed one. Most credit bureaus
stem from the information piled up by
debt collectors.
“Basically the association will supply
information on inquiry from members
as to bad debts,” Mr. Griffin said. “It is
intended to stop people obtaining
credit who are prone to evade payment.
There are people who are deliberately
fraudulent. They shop around for
goods and have no intention of pay-
ing the bill. The other danger is the
clearout. This is the debtor who flits
from address to address, often using
aliases. Usually he has to be written
off, because the goods cannot be re-
possessed and it is difficult to find him
in order to get a judgment against him.
“The .law has been so slanted for
consumer protection that recovery of
debts is costly. Repossession is not
usually successful because the retailer
sells new goods and they are second-
hand and worth much less when he gets
them back. He can try to get the differ-

ence in value from the repossessed
customer, but it is costly to chase
money like this, and often the company
has to cut its losses.”
Fortunately for the nerves of the
nation, 98 percent of the population
may get a clean bill of health or a
“negative report” from the Credit Ref-
erence Association. It is the two per-
cent, a fairly substantial number of
people, who will be in trouble. But in-
formation is still piling up, some of it
obtained from the Registrar in Bank-
ruptcy and from other court records.
“We realise,” Mr. Griffin said, “that
many people may have been in trouble
through no fault of their own at some
time or another, and in fact we have
given this a great deal of thought. We
don’t want to harm anyone. We don’t
want to reject anyone who is funda-
mentally honest but has been in trouble
through ill health or as the result of
strikes and periods of unemployment.
But these people usually make amends
for overdue payments, or write and tell
the store what trouble they are in.”
He denied that the bureau represents
an invasion of privacy. “The invasion
is qualified by the paying habits of the
people being investigated. The whole
trade is suffering from bad debts. These
bad debts have to be built back into the
cost structure of the company, and in
the end the honest public suffers. Some-
one has to pay.”
Mr. Griffin has been, very impressed
by the overseas acceptance of credit
bureaus and the success of the system
there. More than eight million names
are listed in New York, surely the
whole population.
So there is some hope for the Aus-
tralian battler who has survived World
War I, the Depression, World War 11,
plus all the man-made recessions,
droughts and floods perhaps by luck
his name is not on record and he may
still be able to get a refrigerator on the
slow-drip method.
APRIL HERSEY
A Liberal Arts Diploma
Despite newspaper reports to the contrary the new Liberal Arts diploma course
at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology will not require matriculation
certificates of its students when they begin the course next year.
As THE BULLETIN reported in
January the major force behind the new
diploma is the Education Department,
which hopes to use the course for its
primary, technical, and unqualified
secondary teachers. The Leaving Certi-
ficate requirement is especially satis-
factory for primary teachers, who form
the bulk of the service and most of
whom do not have matriculation. When
the Liberal Arts project of the RMIT
and the Education Department was first
made public a number of points of
opposition were raised by staff and
members of Melbourne and Monash
Universities and by Humanities teachers
in the State’s leading technical colleges.
The opposition took structural form
in the Liberal Arts Association, which
numbers among its members Professor
R. Jackson, Dean of Melbourne Uni-
versity’s Arts Faculty, Professors O. A.
Oeser, A. G. L. Shaw, and S. R. Davis,
and numerous Readers, Senior Lec-
turers, and Lecturers including Dr. Max
Charlesworth, Dr. Camo Jackson, and
Mr. Stephen Murray-Smith.
The Liberal Arts Association attacked
on three fronts:
• That the entry qualification should
not be the Leaving Certificate;
• That the educational aim of the
diploma should not be specifically
vocational;
• That the stafidard of the course as
projected has a number of serious
defects.
In a recent submission to the Interim
Council of the Victorian Institute of
Colleges the Liberal Arts Association
urged that as a matter of educational
politics the most pressing need is for
alternative education for students quali-
fied to enter a university and wishing to
do so but excluded by quota. The
Association acknowledged the claims for
further education by those who were
not qualified for, or did not wish to
pursue, a university degree course but
pointed out that Leaving entry to the
diploma course would fail to give
priority to the more gifted and better
qualified students: “It would be strange
if the State should provide further edu-
cation for the less gifted in preference
to the more gifted.”
On the questions of the vocational-
orientation of the courses and their
standards the Association has sub-
mitted that “whenever the traditional
Liberal Arts subjects are assimilated
into vocational training courses, they
suffer a sad change and one that is
accompanied by the most undesirable
social consequences.”
One may question some of the
supporting statements such as, “It is
true enough that love of learning alone
is sufficient motivation for only the
most brilliant.” But the dangers raised
are only too real, judging from Ameri-
can experience, and the likely standard
of the courses is a matter of serious
concern.
The major aim of the Education
Department and the State Government
is to offer a fairly easy qualification to
primary teachers. At present, primary
teachers in pursuit of extra certifi-
cates and promotion pursue a rather
odd series of subjects offered by the
Department itself. The ends are quali-
fications known as First Class Honors
and Second Class Honors. If the De-
partment uses the RMIT and other
colleges for diploma courses it will
save itself time, trouble, and also money,
since the technical colleges get Federal
grants whereas the State Department
training schemes are unassisted.
In addition, the education authorities
will have a course for = their trade
teachers in technical schools (quite a
number of whom are now forced to
take Humanities), and a course for
those with technical school Leaving
qualifications who cannot or will not
study for a technical diploma. At pre-
sent the latter are not accepted by the
teachers’ colleges, but with Humanities
diploma courses operating the Educa-
tion Department could have these
students qualified and back teaching
in technical schools by the time they~
are no older than 19 or 20.
Organisationally the new course is
a very neat trick indeed. It solves a
number of problems at one stroke
and even sneaks money out the back-
door of the Federal treasury. But the
danger seen by the RMIT, the technical
colleges which will follow its pilot
course, and the Education Department
is of creating a new course which will
suit their organisational needs yet will
be a contemptible failure in both fact
and reputation.
Stormy Copper
Copper keeps on being the stormy
petrel of Australian minerals. The
sudden recent swings in the local price
for the metal continue a series of dis-
turbances going hack to the Mt. Isa
shutdown.
At various times in the last two
years the industry has been plagued by
industrial strife, focal supply shortage,
exorbitant prices for imports, export
prohibitions; consumers have been
plagued by supply and price fluctua-
tions. The economy has suffered and
only suppliers of rival materials derived
any pleasure from the situation.
Our confusion in copper has strictly
local connotations but it also reflects
what has been little short of bedlam in
the world copper situation. Indeed,
once Mt. Isa, our biggest producer
(providing 70 percent of local require-


ments), got going after the strike we
stood a good chance of profiting hand-
somely from the unruly conditions pre-
vailing in world markets for the metal.
In fact, in the last year or so since
the recovery of local copper produc-
tion absolved Australian users from
importing fantastically priced copper,
Australian balance of payments has
done pretty well on the copper front
and local consumers have had the
benefit of buying most of their require-
ments at the established producers’
price. Until recently this has been very
much lower than that of the London
Metal Exchange, the world open mar-
ket price. Australian exporters of fab-
ricated products (on which there is
no embargo as there is on exports of
scrap) have been enjoying a bonanza
these last few months.
In the latter operations is to be
found the main clue to the 44 percent
, . • .u i i •
increase last month in the local price
v .
to $1267 a ton bringing it to parity
with the price then ruling for the metal
on the London Metal Exchange. What
was happening was that local fabrica-
tors were buying metal from Australian
producers at the then lower producers
price of $B7O a ton, doing a minimal
amount of fabricating on it and selling
the product overseas at the very much
higher price obtainable there. Not sur-
prisingly local metal producers were
highly indignant. Led by Mt. Lyell a
month ago, they broke away from the
producers’ price agreement and swung
in with the LME price.
As the mining companies fully
realised, this move was charged with
dynamite. What sort of dynajnite? It
would greatly increase their profits and,
in the case of Mt. Isa, this would re-
kindle the issues behind the Mackie
strike.
If the mining companies had put
themselves out on an industrial rela-
tions limb by this move they were soon
to be rescued by the very force which
had driven them there the LME
price itself. This has plummeted to be-
low the equivalent which they had
been getting for sales in Australia before
their price rise and as a first step to
maintain parity with it the Australian
price has been reduced to $ll5O a ton
and further downward moves are
likely. As this is being written the
LME price was hardening a little, but
not sufficiently to preclude a further
reduction in the Australian price if
local mining companies adhere to their
published intentions.
J. C. HORSFALL
The Long Wait for Justice
A huge back-log of cases has piled up in the N.S.W. Supreme Court. Yet only
12 months ago this court was dealing so quickly with accident cases that an
injured person often had his case heard and completed within a year of his injury.
How did this come about particu-
larly in view of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s much publicised “speedy justice”
policy? Firstly, there was an almost
catastrophic decline in the number of
injury cases disposed of by the Supreme
Court during the last Law Term (Janu-
ary-June, 1966). The disposal rate of
cases fell to a staggering 30 percent of
former years, because frequently
throughout the term as few as three,
two, or even only one judge was sit-
ting each day in jury cases, as against
ten or eleven in former years. Several
judges were sitting on the new Court
of Appeal, two were overseas for con-
siderable periods, another sat on the
Law Reform Commission, another on
the Rating Inquiry, another on an in-
quiry for the Queensland Government.
There was not a single replacement for
any of these absentees. Approximately
six judges, who would have spent a
considerable amount of time hearing
injury cases, did not sit at all. As a
result the injury case list at times
almost stopped moving. The device of
appointing four acting judges during
the mid-year vacation of four weeks
though a help did little to reduce the
accumulation of cases.
The second reason lies in a wide
shift in policy by the Government In-
surance Office, which is the real defen-
dant in about half the injury cases
heard by the Supreme Court. In pre-
vious years, lawyers on both sides would
settle about 90 percent of cases by
negotiation and bargaining some-
times before any action has been
brought, sometimes during the prepara-
tion of the case, sometimes at the door
of the Court or even after the case had
started. The GIO, in a change of
policy, refused to negotiate settlements
within three weeks of a trial.
Although from time to time state-
ments have been made—and one was
made last, week—that this policy has
been changed the number of cases
being settled is still a long way from
where it was. The impact of this policy
on the work can be judged from this—
if the settlement rate falls from 90
percent to 60 percent, the Supreme
Court must decide about treble the
number of cases. This, with fewer
judges than before, it has no hope of
doing. Cases bank up, delays multiply,
and the injured are “starved out” or
persuaded to take less than they might.
Why the change in GIO policy? A
policy of refusing to settle late in a
case does sometimes save some legal
and court costs by forcing a plaintiff
to settle early. But it deprives an
insurance company of its biggest tac-
tical advantage. Naturally a person
who has a serious case builds up rosy
dreams and hopes of the amount he
might be awarded. Part of the duty of
his legal advisers is to bring his feet
down to earth and counsel him of the
realities of his position. In particular,
an injured person must be brought to
realise that if he loses his case, it is
for him a disaster, whereas if the
insurance company loses it is simply
another statistic to be taken in con-
junction with the others. An insurance
company can average out its good and
bad results. An injured person cannot
as he has only one case —everything
lies on the turn of one card.
At no stage is this more immediately
brought home than immediately before
the trial. At conferences the difficul-
ties and uncertainties are closely
examined as the ordeal of trial
approaches. It is here, in an atmos-
phere of tension and uncertainty, that
an adroit defendant most successfully
negotiates, and can save his client most
money. The GIO, by its policy,
deprives itself of this tactical weapon.
By exploiting this new congestion-
producing policy, the GIO is collecting
as third-party premiums from N.S.W.
motorists, millions of dollars of reserves
which earn interest. On present indi-
cations money collected in 1966 may
well not have to be paid out until
1970, and will earn interest year by
year in the interim. This may be
grand business for insurers but it is
a bitter pill for the injured and their
dependants to be “starved” into
accepting an early and low settlement
or to spend years of deprivation await-
ing a trial that is supposed to be their
right.
Predictably, juries have been blamed
for delay. But lawyers point out since
February last non-jury trials have been
easier to obtain because of amendments
made to the law. At a rough estimate
perhaps 15 percent of cases are now
being tried without juries. But para-
doxically, in view of Government
policy, it is only since more non-jury
trials have taken place that the list has
bogged down.
The solution? If not more judges,
at least the number must be main-
tained. And the GIO? Some flexibility
and some sense of responsibility.
Mystery Tax
No great powers of deduction are
needed to reach the conclusion that Sir
Henry Bolte’s so-called “mystery tax”
will, in fact, be a personal income tax
levied in the name of education, or,
just possibly, education and health.
Sir Henry has already offered some
clues: He said last week the tax would
be new, “But in saying ‘new’ I mean
‘new’,” That it would affect many
Victorians; that it would be broadly
based; and that it would include pro-
vision for growth. Since the Consti-
tution appears to deny the States the
power to levy sales or purchase taxes
on goods and services, and payroll tax
would not be “broadly based and
affect many Victorians,” and the
present taxes, although they will be
raised, too, are not “new,” income tax
is about the only significant area of
possible revenue left.
The direction of the Premier’s in-


tendons was clearly enough displayed
in his 1964 budget speech when he
announced that the State would enter
the income tax field. He dropped his
plan a month after it was announced
because of lack of Federal co-operation,
but it is understood that the tax the
then Mr. Bolte planned in 1964 would
have been levied at the rate of one
penny for every pound of personal
income earned, that it would not have
been levied on companies, and that
the Government hoped to raise more
than £5 million a year from it.
Tt was honed that the Federal
It was hoped that the federal
Government would use its own machin-
ery to collect the tax for the State, and
that Victorians would have to fill in
only one tax return. When the Federal
Government refused to help, Victoria
decided that the cost of setting up its
own taxation apparatus wou e too
great, an mg m two tax leturns
wordd be unpopular electorally.
Now the Liberal Party is in a differ-
ent mood and Liberal Caucus is deter-
mined to back the Premier in his
efforts to get more money. Even if the
Federal Government refuses to assist,
State Cabinet will go ahead with its
own taxation project. The Common-
wealth has no constitutional right to
stop it, but its big potential weapon of
reply is to withold from Victoria its
annual Commonwealth grant.
However, this is not a real political
alternative, and Sir Henry is deter-
mined to run that risk. His hope is
that the Commonwealth will help him
collect the tax, and discussions are
continuing between Federal and State
officials in the hope of reaching agree-
ment on that issue. A fainter but larger
hope for the Victorian Treasury is that
Mr. McMahon will give in and grant
Victoria special relief once Sir Henry’s
budget shows that he is determined to
go ahead with State income tax. It is
a very faint hope, and at present the
odds are that Federal-State financial
relations are about to undergo their
biggest change since the introduction
of uniform taxation in war-time 1942.

Oakleigh Ghost
Now, if it were Bacchus Marsh,
Boydtown, Bathurst, or Bourke, the
thing would seem more credible, but a
ghost amongst the double and triple-
fronted weatherboards of Melbourne’s
East Oakleigh is the year’s most un-
likely story.
The Mathrick family became
acquainted with a .mysterious power a
couple of weeks ago when they heard
strange knocking noises on the outside
of their house. Mr. Mathrick was driv-
ing his truck interstate, so his wife
rang the police, who came and heard
but could not trace the source of the
noise. Constable Sherlock, of Oakleigh
Police, said he spent five hours listening
to the noise, but could not trace its
origins: “It seems like some super-
natural force.”
The next night the wireless patrol
came, and whilst they were making the
rounds with some neighbors there were
five violent raps on the wall two feet
j n front of them. The following even-
ing the 1000 onlookers arrived along
with numerous TV and news camera-
men, radio and Press reporters, who
filled .up the lounge room, trampled
°_ n garden, filled the gutters with
litter, and blocked the street. They also
scared off the ghost, who refused to
start knocking until after midnight,
when the crowd had gone home.
Whenitstarteditwoketheneigh-
bors, but won no concessions from Mrs.
Mathrick, who refused to believe “in
this supernatural busi n e s s,” and
plumped for a physical explanation,
However, she did admit believing in
flying saucers.
There has been no shortage of ad-
visers offering their own physical ex-
planations, which range from a faulty
water tank (suggested by a Mitcham
plumber) to loose-fitting aluminium
insulation (a Rosanna housewife), to
snakes banging their tails against the
floorboards and walls (anonymous
female well-wisher),
Meanwhile, as the ghost knocks on,
Mr. Mathrick says he is now more
“haunted” by the spectators than by
anything else: “The whole thing has
got out of hand and I only wish every-
one would go home and let us get some
sleep.”


After the Battle
Soldier’s Pay , Australia and America
By PETER SAMUEL
THE battle of Nui Dat is still being
assessed and the conclusion in
Canberra is that it holds important
tactical strategic lessons. Tactically
it was a great victory. Two reinforced
Communist battalions numbering 1800
to 2000 men, a good proportion of them
North Vietnamese regulars, were en-
camped overnight in fortified positions
resting before a planned assault on the
Australian, base camp at Vung Tau
five miles away. The battle began
when an Australian unit involved in
patrolling, specifically designed to pre-
empt such an attack, came across the
Communists.
Outnumbered 10 to one, the men
of D company with the help of Aus-
tralian and New Zealand artillery more
than held their own for three hours.
Helicopter resupply, which is standard
practice these days, was hampered by
very heavy rain, although ammunition
did get through. The new tracked
armoured personnel carriers plus an-
other 200 men arrived as reinforcements
and relieved pressure on D company
and put the Communists into full re-
treat. Two hundred and forty-five Com-
munist dead were counted, although it
is thought that up to 300 may have died
compared with the Australian loss, 17
dead. Casualties have probably reduced
the two Communist battalions from
1800 to 1000. About half the enemy
losses were due to artillery fire,
although many were suffered at the
hands of the Australian infantrymen in
fierce close-range fighting.
While these particular Communist
battalions are unlikely to be a threat
for some time, it is expected in Can-
berra that there will be more big
clashes of this sort over the next few
months. The Communists are undoubt-
edly worried at the success Australian
troops are having in their program of
pacification military occupation plus
civic action in a province which
has traditionally been one of their
strongholds.
The comments of American military
writer Bernard Fall on the North
Vietnamese appreciation of democratic
weaknesses are being quoted. The
Communists, on the basis of comments
by General Giap, expect that public
opinion in the democracies will demand
an end to “useless bloodshed,” especi-
ally if no end is in sight.
Australia, the first country involved
in Vietnam to have an election during
the war, may be a test-case. Fortunately,
the Labor party is not likely to vigor-
ously exploit Vietnam bloodshed in
the election campaign. All the Labor
parliamentarians who visited the
country came back more favorable to
the Government point of view. Mr.
Whitlam, who had taken no particular
interest in the issue before, came back
deeply impressed by what Australian
troops are doing, and several other
MPs are also working with the Party
to present some of the facts which
undermine the mythology on which
Leftist protest is based. Moderate
Labor MPs realise that public opinion

generally is rapidly growing more in-
tolerant of their Party’s extremist
stance. The violent protesters are be-
coming isolated, so Hanoi has nothing
to gain through relying on them.
But there are other matters besides
the tactical and strategic ones which
should concern Canberra. In all the
publicity about the battle of Nui
Dat, little attention has been given to
the pay and conditions of the men who
fought it. The hardheaded statisticians
called actuaries who are the key men
in the life assurance business are very
wary about putting a figure on the risk

to war in Vietnam. But it is probably
at least five tunes more dangerous than
t e domestic hazards encountered on
t e loads and elsewhere in Australia.
.e assurance companies ask three
times the ordinary premiums of
soldiers with notice of posting to the
war, and a low ceiling on the insured
amount.
So that rather coldly provides a
measure of the sacrifice through risk
made by our troops in Vietnam. What
do they get in return in terms of cash,
and what provision is made for their
families should they be killed?
The basic cash income is surprisingly
good, only the lowliest privates getting
ess than $4O a week plus a combat
allowance of $10.83. This brings them

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be
pleasantly surprised.
starts with a base pay rate which con-
verts to $2O a week. The GI gets a
slightly larger Vietnam combat loading
than the Australian $15.15 but
that still leaves him with a pay packet
a third smaller, with no married bonus.
But as we go up from the minimum
level, the American military pay starts
to look better by comparison’ With
their tradition of compulsory military
service in the United States, men are
expected to give about two years mili-
tary service for a pittance. After the
two years they start getting big incre-
ments, and so a U.S. sergeant will get
base pay of about $59 plus a Vietnam
allowance, taking his income to $74.
The Australian in the same rank gets
on i y about $63, unless he has a wife,
j n wb i c h case be j s almost exactly on a
p ar w Jth his American counterpart,
.. , . . , , ,
Ab ° ve ? he non-commissioned level,
tbe American pay streaks away. The
U.S. equivalent of a Sergeant-Major
get about $lOl to the Australians
$67, but, in addition, the American
can expect a substantial increment every
two years even if he does not get pro-
moted —a $5 increment to our $l.
Up at the level of Colonel the dif-
ference is more marked $220 to
$l4O.
By comparison with the Ameri-
cans, and no doubt mo*t armies, we
have a remarkably egalitarian pay
structure. Our conscripts are far better
paid than American draftees. This is
partly because our minimum pay scale
has been raised many times before con-
scription in an attempt to attract
volunteers in sufficient numbers.
Few Australians would want to go all
the way with LBJ on army pay. Ours
is a more egalitarian tradition and most
people would, I think, agree that our
foot-slogging privates and NCOs, con-
script and volunteer alike, deserve every
dollar they get and more. But there
is surely sense in examining the small-
ness of Australian army increments for
higher rank and longer service. A move
toward the American pay progression
would improve the rate of voluntary
enlistment and re-engagement.
THERE is one important area where
Australian society does not do nearly
as much for its soldiers as American
society, and that is in the provision it
makes for the families of its war dead.
The most the widow of an Australian
soldier can expect is about $2O a week
in pension from the Repatriation De-
partment, some help with medical and
educational expenses, and possibly a few
hundred dollars from her dead hus-
band’s retirement fund.
The absolute maximum she can get
from a life assurance policy is $6OOO
and in order to have sustained this her
husband will have had to pay premiums
of $223 a year, compared with the
regular rate of $B3 a year. The
United States makes incomparably
better provision than this. For a pre-
mium of $24 a year—one-tenth of the
Australian rate the American soldier
can get a life assurance of $lO,OOO and
at regular civilian rates he can increase
his policy to $20,000. This means
that his government arranges things so
that for about $2OO, over the two years
of his service, the American conscript
can ensure that his dependants will
get $20,000 should he die. The Aus-
tralian for the same outlay can only
get about $2500 worth of cover.
The American Government also helps
its war widows by paying them their
husbands’ full pay for a period of six
months after their death. After that the
widow receives compensation indemnity
of $25 a week plus 12 percent of her
husband’s salary for as long as she
remains unremarried. She and her
children are also eligible for civilian
social service benefits. These will pro-
vide $12.50 each child compared to our
Repatriation’s $3.90 for the first and
$2.75 for each subsequent child.
In the United States the war widow
and her children are at least compen-
sated for their human loss with gen-
eral provision for the material needs.
But here we provide so miserably that
we compound the human loss with a
material one.


Indonesia’s Civil War
From DONALD KIRK in DJAKARTA
PRESIDENT SUKARNO’S Inde-
pendence Day address seems to
have polarised forces for and
against him and pushed Indonesia to
the brink of civil war.
The most recent evidence of national
tension was a series of riots in Bandung,
capital of West Java and a leading
centre for anti-Communist intellectuals.
For two days pro-Sukarno forces, many
of them imported from Central Java, a
stronghold of Sukarno support, ram-
paged through the city and engaged in
a series of street fights with Sukarno’s
opponents. At least one student was
killed and a score injured.
Indonesian observers fear that
Sukarno may have succeeded in wreck-
ing the uneasy peace which he had
established with General Suharto. The
unsettling element in the President’s
address, delivered 21 years after he de-
clared Indonesia’s independence from
The Netherlands, was that it indicated
to anti-Communist students that he may
attempt to revive his old polices if
given the ghost of a chance. The tip-
off was his insistence on the old formula
of Nasakom standing for National-
ism, Religion, and Communism, the
three main ingredients in Indonesian
life before the unsuccessful Communist
coup last year.
“We don’t have to call it Nasakom —
we can call it Nasasos ” the President
suggested (i.e., Nationalism, Religion,
and Socialism). “These three factors are
still essential.” The students interpreted
his speech as a clever gambit for sup-
porting the Communist Party, banned in
March against his wishes. Fearing that
the President may obtain enough sup-
port to remain in office for years to
come, the leaders of the Action Com-
mand of Indonesian students have
opened a fresh campaign to have him
removed.
aim is to make certain he has
little popular support by the time
elections are held for members of the
People’s Consultative Congress, the
country’s highest governing body, which
could in turn elect a new president.
The prinicipal opposition to the students
is the Indonesian Nationalist Party
{PNI), which Sukarno himself found-
ed in 1927. Split between its fervently
pro-Sukarno Left wing and its moder-
ate leadership, the PNI has attempted
to compromise by stating that it sup-
ports Sukarno “as long as he remains
our President.”
The PNI draws most of its support
from Central and parts of Eastern
Java, where PNI students wearing black
uniforms and red berets are constantly
patrolling the roads and holding rallies
for the President. They shout, “Long
live Brother Karno,” and frequently
fight with anti-Communist, anti-Sukarno
students. The military authorities have
ordered students not to associate in
groups of more than five, but there are
frequent stories of knifings and killings
in the rice paddies and sugar cane.
The anti-Communist students have re-
ceived their most powerful backing from
the religious parties, which regard
Communism with sheer horror and the
hint of Communist influence in the PNI
as equally dangerous. Often at odds
with each other, the Muslims, Catholics,
and other Christians are united in an
anti-Communist fury. This unity is
specially unusual among the Muslims,
who are deeply divided between the
Muslim Scholars Party, the nation’s
largest political organisation, and the
Masjumi, outlawed by Sukarno six years
ago for opposing HIS concepts of
“guided democracy.” In East Java, the
Muslim Scholars have gained influence,
if not control, over the provincial
government even though the PNI holds
a majority in parts of the province.
President Sukarno has said that he
would welcome elections—“tomorrow if
it were possible.” His confidence stems
from the fact that he still has an almost
god-like fascination for millions of Cen-
tral and Eastern Javanese. Sukarno is
confident that they would elect enough
members of Congress to keep him safely
in office. He might not stand much
chance if the armed forces were solidly
against him under General Suharto. The
fact is, however, that the military police
force, the Marines, and air force para-
commandos are believed to favor him,
as well as vast numbers of enlisted men
in all branches of the armed forces.
Suharto can reshuffle commanders to
suit his taste, but he cannot alter the
views of thousands of troops quite so
easily.
It is because the anti-Communist
students sense all these problems that
they are determined to put Sukarno
down before he can recover from the
political beatings he has taken this year.
And it is because they are determined
to keep Sukarno in power that pro-
Sukarno mobs storm through cities like
Bandung, knifing and wounding
students. The question now is whether
Indonesia will succeed in maintaining
the uneasy peace—or plunge into civil
war.
Poland’s Coming Struggle
By ALEXANDER BREGMAN
AS the tenth anniversary of the
famous Polish “Spring in
October” revolt approaches,
there are signs that a climate not un-
like that of the revolt of 1956 is build-
ing up in the country. There are,
of course, many differences* which
make any forecast difficult. None-the-
less, for the first time in ten years, the
Polish people are not only deeply dis-
gruntled and in ferment, but convinced
that something is going to happen, that
things cannot go on as they are.
For years the prevailing mood in
the country was that of deep apathy.
The great hopes of October, 1956,
have long since disappeared. The
intellectuals in particular felt betrayed
by Gomulka, whom they helped so
much to power. Yet the party has been
able to withdraw step by step some
of the concessions made ten years ago
without provoking an outburst of anger.
The Polish masses felt that at least
things were still better than before the
October events. Also contributing to the
apathy was the feeling that nothing
could be done: from the West noth-
ing was expected, while in the East
the Soviet threat remained. Thus
every Pole has concentrated on im-
proving his own personal position.
This apathy now seems to be almost
a thing of the past. The growing
hostility toward the government and
the Party has come into the open. Not
without reason did the Communists
see the huge crowds attending the cele-
brations of 1,000 years of Polish Chris-
tianity as a kind of demonstration
against Communism; it was the regime’s
hostility which gave them this charac-
ter. There have been several incidents,
such as a crowd in Gdansk burning an
anti-Church poster, and clashes with
police in Warsaw with the crowd shout-
ing “Gestapo” at them. There was
even an attempt to march on the Party
headquarters in the capital and among
the slogans shouted by the demon-
strators was also a demand for “Free-
dom of speech.”
That does not mean the people are
ready to revolt; they are not. But,
neither the Poznan revolt in June,
1956, which started the chain leading
to the October events, or the Hun-
garian revolution, were premeditated.
Nobody expected them until they
actually happened. But without think-
ing of revolt, the Poles are less and
less prepared to accept things as they
are.
Several factors have contributed to
this change of mood. They see Rumania
pursuing a much more independent
policy, dictated by Rumanian and not
Russian interests, and regret that
Polish Communists are much less
nationalistic. Unlike Poland, Rumania
is not threatened by German ter-
ritorial claims and feels less depend-
ent upon Soviet help. But there
is no explanation or justification
for Poland’s lagging behind in
economic reforms. After all, it was
in Poland ten years ago that bold
plans of economic reform were first
produced. Yet today Hungary or
Czechoslovakia have gone much further

than Poland in the way of such re-
forms.
Another factor which is making the
Poles restless is the diminishing fear
of Soviet intervention. Until quite re-
cently much has been forgiven Mr.
Gomulka, because it was felt that he
was forced to do many things under
pressure from Moscow. Now people
are doubting this and believing it is
on his own initiative. While Poland re-
mains an ally, Moscow seems prepared
to leave all home affairs to the Polish
leaders and Gomulka could change
much without incurring Soviet wrath.
This is especially true of the struggle
against the Church. Nobody thinks that
Moscow forced Gomulka into the cam-
paign against Cardinal Wyszynski. On
the contrary, there is much evidence
that Moscow would have much pre-
ferred the regime to come to terms
with the church.
In general, the struggle with the
Episcopate is certainly the biggest single
factor in the regime’s unpopularity.
Gomulka’s policy succeded only in
uniting the whole Polish people behind
the Cardinal.
The way in which Gomulka played
his cards in the duel with the Primate
has been incredibly clumsy. By over-
playing their hand generally, the Com-
munists lost the chance they had. The
stronger the attacks against him, the
greater his popularity has grown. By
May he had won the full approval of
the masses for his offer of forgiveness.
The Communist efforts to use this
point against the Church boomeranged.
The walls of Polish cities have been
covered with posters with the caption:
“We will never forgive” meaning
German war crimes. But everywhere
Poles have added the word “Katyn”—
meaning the murder by the Russians
of thousands of Polish officers in 1940.
Another chance missed by the regime
was the Pope’s planned visit. Many
people believe that had Gomulka been
clever, he could exploit the visit to
strengthen the regime. People would
have seen Paul VI in the company of
the Communist leaders; it would have
been a kind of recognition of Com-
munist rule. But Gomulka felt he was
not strong enough to risk an ex-
plosion of national and religious fervor
should the Pope come. Thus what
could have been a strong trump-card
for him has become another blow to
his prestige which has never been lower
than at present. It was not an
exaggerated claim when Cardinal Wys-
zynski said during one of the mill-
enium celebrations that the whole of
Poland had now “gathered around its
priests.”
The big problem is what the nation,
however united against the regime, can
do about it. The bishops neither can
nor wish to act as political leaders.
While Gomulka treats the church as if
it were a political party, Cardinal Wys-
zynski stresses again and again that he
has no political ambitions. He has
immense prestige in the country and
is seen as its spiritual leader. But even
while being a rallying point for the
nation, the church cannot influence the
political evolution.
observers believe that should
another “October” come it would
be not a cvolt against one Communist
group but against the Communist dic-
tatorship as a whole. Not only has
the Rumanian example of independence
found followers in Poland, but also the
Yugoslav reformers, such as Professor
Mihajlov, have, too. Many younger
activists, technocrats, and intellectuals
would not be content with a dejno-
cratisation of the party; they want a
real, social-democrat opposition party
with legal opposition Press and
ultimately free democratic elections.
They are certain that only then could
a socialist system exist, because under
the present set-up the Party bureau-
cracy makes economic progress impos-
sible.
The Party, of course, is not ready
to abdicate power. But unable to rule
by terror, as it did until 1956, and not
having found the way to rule by con-
sent, it is falling into an impasse.
The situation is extremely confused.
The whole nation is more strongly
opposed to the regime than ever be-
fore, but has no leader who could
show the way. Some people, however,
believe that once things start moving,
new leaders could easily emerge.
The fact remains that ten years after
the Polish October, which for many
Poles was to be a first step, the nation
is ready and eager for a second big
step toward greater freedom. . I

ONE MORE
WEEK
Carving up the critics
“STATUES, I always say, are never
carved for critics.” Zubin Mehta, one
of the conductors of the visiting Israel
Philharmonic Orchestra, was talking
about the reviews of his performances
here, one of which apparently confused
a violin with a viola.
Mehta had opened the sumptuous
Music Centre in Los Angeles, built by
the efforts of Mrs. Norman Chandler,'
wife of the owner of the Los Angeles
“Times.” How had she gone about rais-
ing the money? “She didn’t waste time.
From a fabulously wealthy business con-
tractor, Mark Taper, she got $1 million.
In return he wanted his photo on the
front page of the Los Angeles ‘Times.’
That wasn’t exactly difficult to arrange
“And you should see the Founders’
room at the Centre. I tell you, it even
makes Versailles look nothing. Rem-
brandts on the walls, a dark green
marble bar ... It cost $25,000 each
for the founders to use that room. It
is the most expensive club in the world.
“I think you should get her here to
raise money to finish the Opera House
in record time. Lotteries are no good.
You want someone like Mrs. Chandler
and a generous public. And I tell you,
Americans are the most generous
people in the world. I went to a hos-
pitals charity dinner once at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel. It cost $5OOO a plate for
dinner. After dinner people made
pledges. By the time the evening was
over the guests had given $8 million.
I was the guest-of-honor and I couldn’t
believe it. This Music Centre of ours
really represents the most luxurious
form of Communism in the world.”
We asked Mehta what he thought of
the music being written just up the coast
in Hollywood. He said he very much
admired the work of Miklos Rozsa,
composer of the music for “Ben Hur,”
whose first piano concerto he would be
conducting at the Centre next April.
He also spoke highly of Elmer Bernstein
and Bronislau Kaper.
Mehta spoke warmly of audiences in
Australia and regretted that he had not
yet been able to visit the Opera House.
“You will just have to have two months
of opera a year and use the big names
to attract audiences at first. And I hope
you have now got an acoustics man per-
manently on the job. Or have you? I
know of only three men in the world
who could do it and none of them
appears to be here. You can’t make
music with a roof, you know.”
Relevant
AFTER plays on subjects of such im-
mediate relevance to our condition as
Lesbianism in London (“The Killing
of Sister George”) and incest in Ger-
many (“Altona”) the luck of the draw
in the interstate theatre season brought
“The Night of the Ding Dong” to
the Old Tote, Sydney.
It is a very funny play by Ralph
Peterson and although it is set in South
Australia in colonial days with Adelaide
menaced by a Russian gun-boat in the
Bight, its lightly stated message is that
a community will readily find money
for defence which it will not spend on
education. And what could be more
relevant to our post-Budget condition
than that?
Out like a Light
WILL RUSHTON the cartoonist is
back in Australia from his native Lon-
don. The first thing he did was very
thankfully to switch himself off, and
switched off he will stay.
Once he had got his wattage down
to a comfortable level, Rushton told
us that in the six months he had had
in London since leaving Australia he
had marked a certain feeling of depres-
sion among English people as the full
realisation that their Labor Govern-
ment is, in fact, a Conservative one
dawns. But more so, he believes, there
is a profound glumness as they face up
to the task of being the Swinging Eng-
land which “Time” magazine created.
From the vantage point of “Private
Eye” magazine, now, he admits, part
of the Establishment, he views the
switched-on generation with some mis-
trust. Where, he asks, are their writers?
What can be their importance if they
have nothing to say?
Rushton and Barry Humphries form
a sort of two-man jet set. Like all
smart people these days, they meet only
on international airports. Then they
remind each other that 18 months ago
they got an advance from a London
agent to do a stage revue together
and that, honestly, some time they
must get around to it.
Teenage Telly
SOME INSIGHT into teenage tele-
vision tastes as well as their viewing
habits emerged from the elaborate 23-
question survey forms which were filled
in by 10,122 Geelong secondary-school
students last year, results of which
came out last week.
Boys, it seems, have little taste for
sports shows but a big demand for
humor. Their overall favorite is (or
was) “Mavis Bramston.” Girls are less
inclined toward humor, nor do they
like musical or variety shows unless they
are studded with longhairs and guitar
twangers as in “GO,” which they voted
their runaway favorite. Apart from
that, where the boys go for humor,
girls go for realism, as in shows like
“Coronation Street.”
Geelong teacher Dr. W. R. Lang,
honorary secretary of the local regional
group of the Australian College of
Education, initiated the survey which
was carried out in August last year.
The forms went to 19 secondary schools,
State and private, in the Geelong area
and were filled in by day pupils and
boarders.
The boys-for-humor as against girls-
for-realism picture comes out in the
way the boys plumped more heavily
for “Bramston,” “The Saint,” “Gilli-
gan’s Island,” and “The Munsters”
while the girls leaned far more heavily
toward “National Velvet,” “Coronation
Street,” and “Peyton Place.” “Bram-
ston” was tops with 15 percent of the
boys, but with only nine percent of the
girls. Similarly, “GO” rated highest
with 20 percent of the girls and only
eight percent of the boys.
Most-disliked viewing to this age
group are children’s shows, possibly be-
cause they feel they have outgrown
them, and non-Bramston variety shows,
which they possibly dismiss as square.
“Disneyland” wins a few votes from
first and second formers, then disap-
pears from interest.
Sports shows got less than three per-

t vo tes as top favorites of first and
Second formers, edging up to five per-
S ent with sixth formers, but never pass-
■ s that. It is not until sixth form, in-
‘.Ltallv, that factual programs come
1 the picture. “Project ’65” got 10
ercent of sixth formers’ top votes,
“Weekend Magazine” five, and “Im-
aCt” three. And this doesn’t happen
‘ t a H with girls who, by sixth form,
e st ill engrossed in shows like “Coron-
ation Street.”
The survey seems, too, to have
anS wered the question of who dictates
,h a t a family sees on TV. Asked
if they ever ran into any bother see-
ing their favorite shows, more than 50
percent replied “never,” another 33
percent said “occasionally,” seven said
“often,” and four percent said a
bit sulkily perhaps that it happened
, “always.”
And what if there were no TV?
Again the boys’ alternatives were very
different from the girls’. Boys would
have, first, listened to records and
then, in order of preference, have
listened to radio, talked with their
families, or gone visiting. Girls rated
talking with families much lower. They
would have done hobby work, listened
to records, gone visiting, or just gone
to bed.
Baby Business
THE SARA QUADS, Judy, Phillip,
Alison, and Mark, are now' 16. Their
exclusive contract to appear in “The
Australian Women’s Weekly” has run
out, as designed, to allow them to grow
to adulthood in privacy. But this seems
as good a time as any to tell, for the
first time, the full story of how they
were signed up.
Leo Basser w'rites:
“I was sent to Bellingen, in northern
New' South Wales, in 1950. I arrived
in a downpour at the Bellingen River
District Hospital late in the afternoon
of August 17, briefed only by the then-
editor of the ‘Daily Telegraph,’ the
late Brian Penton, that the town ex-
pected a multiple birth.
“No reporter could have been
further behind the eight-ball, especially
when he discovered that the reporter
for the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ had
been in the town for two weeks and
was staying at the home of Mrs. Sara’s
doctor. The story was all sewn up by
my rival. Then a young nurse asked
me ‘Would I like a cup of tea?’ She
took me into the hospital kitchen but
wasn’t prepared to talk about what
was happening.
“A middle-aged man walked into the
kitchen. He was the Newcastle specialist
consultant on the birth. When he learnt
I was a reporter, he said, ‘Your opposi-
tion is inside in the doctors’ room. I
think you should have equal treatment.
Perhaps you would like to see the X-ray
it looks like the aftermath of a feed
of fish and chips.’ I saw* the X-ray and
only then realised I was in Bellingen
to report the birth of quadruplets.
“When the babies were born on
August 17, 18, and 19 representatives
of newspapers, magazines, radio
stations, commercial firms, theatrical
entrepreneurs descended on the small
town. My photographer and I found
that even hotel walls had ears and
moved our ‘business’ headquarters to
the local barber shop.
“After the birth the hospital began
issuing daily bulletins. At such a brief-
ing it was agreed that the first picture
would be taken on Wednesday, August
23. It was a gentleman’s agreement.
On Tuesday we got wind that an
opposition photographer had arranged
for a nurse to sneak a photo of the
babies through a ward window. His
negative had been rushed to the air-
port at Coff’s Harbor and been sent to
Sydney on the only plane out of the
district.
“We rang Sydney and reported this
crisis. The voice on the other end was
to the point: ‘Get a picture. Insist on
your rights. I’ll get a plane to Coff’s
Harbor. Get the picture or don’t come
back.’ We insisted on our rights and
the hospital allowed us one picture. A
fast car took the undeveloped negative
to the airport. About 7 p.m. a Qantas
plane arrived. The pilot looked dis-
mayed. ‘Have I flown all this way just
to collect one negative?’ he asked,
“The next morning our picture was
on the front pages of the ‘Daily Tele-
graph,’ but the ‘stolen’ picture never
appeared. The shot had failed,
“But Percy Sara’s name on a con-
tract was still missing. Sara was playing
hard to get. Until the Saturday morning,
3 wee k after the last baby had been
born. Sara walked mto the local news-
agent. I followed him and said to the
assistant, loudly enough to be over-
heard: I would like some souvenirs of
Bellingen. I am flying back to Sydney
this afternoon.’
“Half an hour later Sara phoned the
hotel. Would we meet him at his
solicitor’s office. There the contract
was signed.
“I was later to report the birth of
the Lucke quads at Bundaberg and
sign them up, and the Hudson quads at
Gilgandra (only one survived) and
sign them up. And I flew to New
Zealand to organise a contract for the
Lawson quintuplets. Don’t ask me to
work out the odds for one journalist
signing up four multiple births. It’s
billions to one.”

What Happens if Your Face
Simply Goes Out of Style?
Perhaps the solution is a new camera
Hannerle Dehn, British model brought here for
fabric promotion, whose face is right in style.
By JAN SMITH
IN Australia, where modelling is as
good a way as any for a girl to
fill in time until she gets married,
the rewards of the game are not quite
as high as they appear in films like
“Darling,” or comic strips like “Tiffany
Jones.”
At the moment, it is doubtful if sue-
cess, Australian-style, is enough to
satisfy any model with more than
jnodest ambitions. The average income
for models in Australia is around 40
or 50 dollars a week, compared with
as high as 100 dollars a day in New
York. Miss Pat Woodley and Miss June
Dally-Watkins, who run the two lead-
ing Sydney agencies, believe it is simply
that Australians won’t pay for a pretty
face whether from envy or lack of
promotional sense and don’t realise
the hard work that can go into keeping
it that way. '
“What happens if your face simply
goes out of style between this year
and the next?” Miss Woodley asked.
Other people in the trade, like pho-
tographer Ray Leighton, say it’s simply
a matter of economics. “Any Austra-
lian advertiser in a national women’s
magazine can’t hope to reach more
than two million people at the most,
Why should he have to pay the same
as his American counterpart who can
reach tens of millions in one issue of
‘McCalls’?”
And, photographers working for the
magazines know only too well that
the supply far exceeds the demand,
“They’re here today and gone tomor-
row, most of them,” said one man.
“And most times you don’t shed any
tears. They don’t realise the only reason
you pick them out of the model book
is that they might look good in a dress
or a make-up shot. They keep bleating
that you’re taking them from the wrong
side, or it’s not their best angle. Who
cares? All our readers and the
manufacturer are interested in is
the dress.”
Worse still, since last March, when
both June Dally-Watkins and Pat
Woodley brought in a new scale of
charges and instituted three grades of
model, a kind of cold war has existed
with the major Sydney department
stores, which steadfastly stick to the old
rates laid down by the Retail Traders’
Association.
Unmoved by pleas that modelling
was a highly skilled occupation, the •
stores, David Jones’ being usually cited
as the ringleader, stuck grimly to their
rate of 12 dollars a day regardless of
grading. Providentially, most of the
promotions were for mod clothes, and
who better to model them than go-go
girls? It is hard not to feel that the
models timed the whole business rather
badly, since by February the whole
go-go business was bursting out all over
town.
Understandably, a lot of the models
were not happy about the grading, and
many confessed that they would be
quite happy to be down-graded from
Premier to A, or from A to B Grade
—rather than find themselves priced
off the market by asking the Premier
rate of 36 dollars a day.
Go-go girls were bad enough, in the
eyes of the professional models, but
worse still was the muscling in by new
agencies and for all anyone knew, by
girls who weren’t even fashion models
at all, but decidedly tatty bits of work
from strip joints and worse.
M ISS MARIE GORTLEY, assistant
to the display manager of David
Jones’, described the worst of the
arrivistes as “girls whose eyelashes aren’t
stuck on properly.” Miss Woodley bit-
terly mentioned a “Honi Soit” defini-
tion of a model—“anyone under 25
who hasn’t got acne.”
But Miss Gortley said there was no
shortage of girls for the spring parades.
Spring parades, as most women know
instinctively, begin in July, zoom to
a peak among the daisies, lambs, or s
whatever the chosen decor is around
September, and subside until the winter
parades in late February. Smaller tur-
bulances are caused by the openings
of new stores and the birthdays of
existing ones.
Miss Gortley said they’d use any-
one who was well-scrubbed, well-
dressed, and reasonably experienced in
mannequin work, but admitted there was
a shortage of high-fashion models to
cater for maturer women, who might
feel that a crocheted granny dress was
not the best way to impress their hus-
band’s managing director. “We have
lots of matron models,” Miss Gortley
explained delicately, “especially for our
Parramatta promotions, but we could
do with a few more of the Judy Barra-
clough-June Massey type for high-
fashion clothes.”
It is too early to tell if the cold
war will mean an even bigger stream
of overseas-bound models, following in
the wake of girls like Colleen Fitz-
patrick, Margot McKendry, Anne Fel-
ton, and Pam Quinn, but the catwalk
of the department store is not the place
to make a fortune at the moment. This
means that the ambitious model must
concentrate on photographic modelling,
which demands a whole lot of inbuilt

qualities like photogenic features, and
either inbuilt or acquired ones like
stamina, slimness, and an ability to
pose.
A photographic model must be thin,
thin, thin. “In the beginning people
wanted big hearty girls the Aus-
tralian outdoor type but now they
seem to specialise in the thinner,
sophisticated type,” Miss Woodley said.
All models know the camera adds
weight, and a television camera even
more.
Achieving slimness is only part of
the discipline. A model needs early
nights, and with an income that is
anything but regular, an unerring
clothes sense so she can keep her ward-
robe in top condition. “In America
clients will supply things like evening
shoes and switches and wigs for a
picture but in Australia a girl has to
have them with her at a moment’s
notice,” Miss Woodley said. “And
if they are to be kept in a presentable
state, it means they are worn only on
jobs.”
! A MODEL .must be prepared to
spend 100 dollars or more on a
good selection of photographs when she
starts out an expense that can only
be avoided by acquiring a photog-
rapher boyfriend who might do them
for nothing. If the first photographer
doesn’t do a good job, there could well
be another 100 dollars to budget for.
“We suggest a special savings account
for photographs, and enough money to
keep yourself for two months,” said
Miss Woodley on the subject of taking
their first gamble.
June Dally-Watkins, in the basement
of Dymock’s building, had much the
same story to tell about lack of aware-
ness of just how hard a model had to
work. Still, there was at least one girl,
24-year-old Ana Nilsen, who thought
Sydney might offer more opportunities
for recognition than her home town of
Auckland. A tall, lean brunette with
enormous eyes and the discreetly un-
obtrusive nose that sends photographers
into raptures, she had just returned
from showing a batch of pictures
around her first Sydney newspaper
office.
No one had seemed too excited, but
Miss Nilsen wasn’t going to let it
bother her, and Miss Dally-Watkins
felt sure that in a few years, with more
experience, New York* and London
would have plenty to offer. Miss Dally-
Watkins had been saying earlier that
it wasn’t necessarily the most beautiful
girls who went furthest, and that some
of her success had started from the
most unprepossessing beginnings, but
Miss Nilsen didn’t seem to fit either
category.
In fact, there have been rumblings
lately from magazine and agency people
that distinctive girls are hard to come
by, and unkind words like “mass-
produced” and “assembly line” have
a way of cropping up whenever the
subject is discussed by people who
attend the annual new faces parades
at the big agencies. Miss Woodley may
have been over-touchy in objecting to
the anyone-under-25-without-acne gibe,
but she is dead right about faces being
in fashion.
Perhaps the only solution is a new
sort of camera.
Ray Leighton, a veteran fashion
photographer in Grosvenor Street, puts
his feet on the desk and says simply
that he’s tired of the whole bloody
business. “Yes, there’s a small nucleus
here that’s equal to the best in the
world. Or were here before they made
good overseas. Willi, Colleen, that one
with the big eyes ... I can’t remember
their flaming names any more, even.”
A household word on television five
years ago, when he obliged masochistic
housewives with his opinion on their
fashion shortcomings, he is not a man
to mince words.
“I’m getting too old to feel that
divine spark any more,” he confided.
“When you’ve been taking fashion
pictures as long as I have, since 1936,
it takes a miracle to get you staying
back after five o’clock to photograph
some poor little devil you feel just

And here’s the proof. Breaking through traditional conservatism,
six leading French producers sold 140,000,000 rigid PVC bottles
of red wine in 1964 alone! Geon rigid PVC—polyvinyl chloride

souring. Geon PVC does not shatter, weighs up to 80% less than
glass, and can be moulded in practically any shape or size,

might have what it takes. Out of the
goodness of your heart. I’m not saying
it hasn’t been known to happen that
I’ll run them off a batch of shots
sometimes I’ll even go into the dark-
room and develop them myself, and
that’s about the supreme sacrifice for
any photographer. When they say how
can they thank me I tell them to get
out. Quick. Before I change my mind.”
Leighton scoffs at the popular idea
that a Svengali-style photographer is
behind the success of most models.
“After photographing these dames all
day you’re usually halfway up the wall.
You scream at them because they stand
there like a sack of potatoes. You plead
with them, beg them, threaten them.
How any photographer in his senses
would want to do anything to them
afterwards but strangle them I can’t
imagine.”
Many of Ray Leighton’s models
break down and cry, and are never
asked back. “The only possible advan-
tage in taking one of them under your
wing would be that it would help you
as much as it would help them,” he
mused. “It’s no use having a model who
can’t act. It’s not twice as hard on
the photographer, it’s ten times as
hard.”
H E admitted things had got better
since the two leading models
schools had introduced photographic
courses and lectures by ex-top models
—“I mean recent ex-top models,” he
added tartly. But the models schools
themselves were a mixed blessing. “I
remember the old days when we had
to train our own models right from the
word go. Laurie Le Guay and I sort
of shared them out. Laurie discovered
Anne Felton and Margot McKendry
and I found June Massey and Norma
Geneave. It was tough, but now the
problem with models schools is that
they, all look the same.
“I don’t suppose you can blame the
poor little things. One of them gets a
few breaks, so they all copy her down
to the last stitch, regardless of whether
it suits them. It’s like a sausage machine.
They all walk the same, they all hold
their handbags the same way. It’s
awful. I’d say the best thing model
schools do is turn out mannequins.
Models are born. It’s like being an
actress. Either you are or you aren’t.
“It’s damned hard work and it takes
brains. Often the ones who get to the
top are the ones shortest on sheer
physical attraction. The ones you
wouldn’t look at twice without their
make-up. God, it’s incredible what you
can do with make-up, but I get this
awful wistful feeling for a clean-
scrubbed face occasionally. It’s brains
and dedication that win every time.”
He mentioned a top model, now
overseas, who bore out his remarks.
“She looked a real mess when she first
came here. Huge bust, real sloppy figure.
But she had the dedication of ten men.
I’ll swear she was a virgin till the day
she left Australia, she was so damn
dedicated, she simply didn’t have time.”

THE OTHER SEX
The Blackberry Man
Having become
a housewife
again after
many years on the
nine-to-five grind,
my first big surprise
was the number of
door-knockers who
are busy doing the
rounds.
When last a
housewife, back in
the ’thirties, answer-
ing the door several times a day was
just part of a routine. Everyone was
selling something in those days. A
master-builder sold soap, an accountant
sold coffee, young men carted round
huge suitcases full of cakes made by
their mothers, others had travelling
libraries.
Salesmen abounded, and insurance
agents came round in their dozens as
soon as one was noticeably pregnant.
Once the baby Tad arrived the photog-
raphers came in their numbers. Worst of
all were the strong young men who
came and offered to scrub your bath-
room and kitchen floor for 1/- or to
clean your windows for 2/-. Being a
very young bride and only 4 feet 11
inches tall I soon learned to cope with
this embarrassment by palming them
off with “sorry my mother is not at
home.”
However, there was one seller I wel-
comed and often look back on over
the years with nostalgia. It was the
blackberry man. Each season he would
come round selling a billycan full of
freshly picked blackberries for 1/-.
Even for those days when the basic
wage was less than £4 this was a bar-
gain. The first night one could be
really extravagant and have them with
a jar of fresh cream at 7d. The next
night some could be stewed and eaten
with custard and there was enough left
the next day to make a huge pie which
catefed for sweets for two more nights,
plus a slice or two in the cut lunch.
Alas! In the affluent society all local
councils have declared the blackberry
a noxious weed and have eradicated it
from their municipalities, so that you
can’t even go and pick your own any
more.
The door-knockers of the present day
are a totally different race. They are
female, well dressed, alert, and armed
with sheaves of papers. As you open
the door they greet you with a brisk:
“I just want to ask you a few questions
I’m NOT selling anything.” This
great stream of new door-knockers are
all conducting surveys.
You are obliged to ask them in, so
they can rest their numerous forms on
the kitchen table. Then they fire the
questions at you. What kind of table
salt do you use? When did you last buy
it? What color asparagus do you prefer
—green or white? No matter what
color you settle for, the next question
is, Why? Breakfast foods, soap powders,
soft drinks—it doesn’t matter what the
product is, the questions follow a
pattern. Once you have answered a
few of these questionnaires you know
perfectly well what is coming next.
' They all ask Have you a packet
of ... in the house now? What brand
is it? Not being a keen shopper and
never having visited a supermarket, I'm
afraid my knowledge of brands has
never advanced beyond the ’thirties. I
always have to go to my cupboard to
find out if I have the product and to
see what brand it is. Long before they
come to the question about what age
group I belong to, I know that I have
given away my age by my abysmal
ignorance of modern brands.
When I am briskly asked what I
first think of at the mention of soft
drinks, I truthfully say the name of a
brand that was a household word in the
’thirties and has probably been “taken
over” years ago. When they ask about
commercials on TV, yes, I remember
the tune and usually the jingle, but I
can’t remember what it advertises. Of
course, I remember the big rubber ball
with people jumping over it, but the
name of the product it advertises does
not come to me. I try to console myself
by remembering all my copimunity
activities, how I leave an open book
beside me when watching TV and read
a few pages while the commercials are
on.
£ HARDEN inwardly when it gets to
the last page of the “survey,” which
gets really personal. The age grouping
doesn’t worry me at all, though I notice
that they diplomatically start off by
asking me if I am in the 30-35 group.
They move up hesitatingly in groups of
five years till they poise the pencil at the
45-50 group.
I calmly say “next group please” and,
looking suitably surprised, they mark
it in. Then comes—What does your hus-
band do? Followed by—How much does
he earn? This question is also in groups,
this time rising by $lOOO, and you can
take your pick which one you settle for.
This morning I answered my door
again, and, not being in the mood for
“surveys,” I got in first by admitting
that I was not a good subject, as I dis-
liked shopping and was not really in-
terested in whether good things came
in glass or packets, as I threw all con-
tainers away just the same. The young
woman was doing a survey on soap pow-
ders and just wanted to know if I had
a certain brand in the house. I replied
that it was most unlikely, as I still used
after 35 years. That was it! I’d
struck the jackpot! She made me a gift
of two giant-sized packets. All I need
now to make my day complete is the
man with the blackberries!

WINE OF THE MONTH
Filling in the Blanc
THE September
Wine of the
Month is Sea-
view Sa u v ignon
Blanc, an almost
indescribable white
table wine.
It says on the
label, Sweet Table
Wine. Yet it is not
as sweet as a Sau-
terne or Barsac, or
one of the sweeter
Graves. Yet it is not as dry as one of
the drier Graves. It is a sort of too-
old-for-toys-too-young-for-boys kind of
wine.
Why am I so insistent on attempting
to classify this wine into overseas types?
Simply because it is made from Sauvi-
gnon Blanc, which I feel is one of the
most interesting white varieties in Aus-
tralia, and is the classic grape of the
classic white wines of Bordeaux.
Seaview is in McLaren Vale, not far
south of Adelaide, and is owned and
run by Ben Chaffey. I once called Ben
the most cheerful pessimist in the busi-
ness and I see no reason to search for
new descriptions. The weight of the
world is on his shoulders and I can
think of few men whose company I
enjoy more. He places great faith in the
Sauvignon Blanc variety and what it
can do for both dry and sweet wines.
He makes three wines from this
material, and of them this semi-sweet
Graves style what-have-you is my pick.
And perhaps it’s better to stop aiming
at classified targets and to just talk
of the wine.
Therq is a little sulphur apparent on
opening which doesn’t take long to
go. A delicate perfumed nose then
takes over. Understandably quite like
nothing else that you usually encounter.
It has certainly no relationship to any
of the fruity grape varieties, Rhine
Riesling, Traminer, and so on, and has
much more character than, say, White
Hermitage. I suppose that some Semil-
ions could develop a similarity to its
bouquet, but really it is quite individual.
The aroma and flavor are excellent.
There is sweetness evident on the
palate, but this is not luscious or cloy-
ing. The finish is clean and pleasant
and the wine is excellently balanced.
It is a strange creature and a bit
difficult to marry. Some thought it
would be excellent served well chilled
as an aperitif/but I disagree with this,
since. I don’t like any sweetness at all
in the mouth before food. I thought
it would be an excellent Gateau wine,
or better still accompanying fish served
in a rich cream sauce. I have read
many famous menus that had Chateau
d’ Yquem from Sauternes with fish
dishes and I have never really under-
stood the combination. But I will cer-
tainly try this one, as I feel this is a
most interesting wine.
Thomas Hardy and Sons at McLaren
Vale have long been fond of their
Sauvignon Blanc, though they chiefly
used it for making a rich luscious dessert
wine of considerable character. In fact,
they were the people who supplied the
cuttings to Ben Chaffey in 1954 and
from which he has achieved so much.
Of the other wines, one is a White
Burgundy which won Silver Medals
as a young wine and which is not really
a White Burgundy at all, but more to-
ward the dry Graves style. A bit like
Chateau Carbonnieux. The wine is
round, full and soft, well balanced, and
the grape character is not so evident as
in the sweeter wine, but it is still quite
distinctive. I like this wine very much.
The third Seaview wine containing
Sauvignon Blanc is the Harvest Moselle.
There are a number of casks at Seaview
which have stages of grape growing and
wine making carved into their heads.
The Harvest is one of them and the
wine is named after this cask. The
Moselle contains 55 percent Sauvignon
Blanc and 45 percent Rhine Riesling.
This is the celebrated wine that John
Avery, the son of the noted British wine
merchant, had served to him masked on
television. He said, “This is a top-quality
German wine which would sell for about
25/- to 30/- sterling in England and
which has all the character and style
that we expect from the Moselle area.”
And Andre Simon, who was notably re-
luctant to discuss too many Australian
wines during his visit here a couple of
years ago, went into print as saying that
he thought both the White Burgundy
and Moselle outstanding commercially
available white wines.
S° you can see I am pretty fascin-
ated with this grape variety alto-
gether and I feel that it has been rela-
tively ignored .by Australian wine-
makers. But you get bees in your
bonnet like these, though you realise
that you may be buzzing up the wrong
hive.
But two things happened in the space
of a couple of months which make me
believe that perhaps I was not. I have
always considered that the Thomas
Hardy Eden Moselle was one of the
best trade Moselles on the market. One
day, talking to someone from their
company, I suggested that they use
Sauvignon Blanc for light table wines
as well as dessert wines. “But we do,”
he said. “We use it for blending into
the Eden Moselle.” A day or so later
I went to a tasting at McWilliams and
noticed a particularly fine Rhine Ries-
ling from the Riverina area at Griffith.
I raved on to one of their noted wine
men for a while saying that the wine
had something extra. It had an inten-
sity and depth of flavor, especially on
the middle palate, that I didn’t usually
associate with Rhine Riesling. Particu-
larly Rhine Riesling from an irrigation
area. What was this they had done?
“Nothing much,” was the reply, “we
just added a fair quantity of Sauvignon
Blanc and we think the result is very
worth while.
So worth while in fact that the wine
won a Gold Medal a month ago in
Brisbane as a, Young White Wine.
Which only goes to show what a
little Sauvignon Blanc will do.

Get in Shape, Professor
AR E Austra-
lians becom-
ing too intel-
lectual? Many of
us today have this
disturbing thought
in the backs of our
minds. The suspi-
cion began with
the failure of our
athletes at the
Tokyo Olympic
Games - from
which, as sports writer Phil Tresidder
forcefully put it, they came home with
more transistors than medals. The
Commonwealth Games in Jamaica were
another disappointment, with our most
famed runner being defeated by un-
knowns from Kenya. Racecourse at-
tendances are down. Our boxers are
notoriously innocuous.
Concurrently with this decline in
sporting prowess there has been an un-
exampled proliferation of thoughtful
young men with beards and young
women without perms, arguing about
Utzon and Vietnam and so on. Whether
we like it or not, the Australian image
is changing. The time may be near
when the term “dinkum Aussie” will no
longer suggest a suntanned, beer-drink-
ing cricket barracker. It will stand for
a pallid, loquacious wine-drinker with
opinions on Italian films and nuclear
testing.
The winner of the Miss Australia
contest will be a sultry, ashen-faced
odalisque, described in Press reports
as “a typical Australian indoor girl.”
Can anything be done to arrest the
trend? I am glad to say one line of
remedial action has been indicated by
that vigorous and stimulating writer
Max Harris. In a recent article he de-
nounced the “unwholesome snobbery”
of Australian intellectuals in their at
titude to sport. As evidence of this lit
pointed out that they hardly ever writ
or review books about football, horse,
racing, etc. These effete individuals di
little or nothing to encourage the
nation’s athletes; indeed, by their aloo
attitude they tend to give sport a bat
name.
Fortunately there are, according t (
Mr. Harris, some honorable exceptions
He said: “Did you know that Vincen
Buckley, no less, and Clement Semmle:
are keen on the gallopers? Tha
Geoffrey Dutton hero-worships Jacl
Brabham? That Patrick White is abou
the wisest man I know on the subjec
of dogs?” Mr. Harris himself is a de
votee of Australian Rules football.
In general, however, hG charges an

encounters an art critic bursting witl
clear-eyed health, an economist whi
is handy with the mitts, or a poet it
hard training for the 100 metres free
style.
SOMETHING should be done abou
this situation. I am not in favor oi
extreme measures, such as compulsor;
games for book-reviewers. But I havt
a practical suggestion: it is the forma
tion of some kind of Intellectuals
Association for the Encouragement c:
Sport. The distinguished sports-lover
mentioned by Mr. Harris could sent
as a nucleus for the organisation.
Mr. Geoffrey Dutton might be pre-
pared to promote hot-rod racing; thers
would be no need for him to have dis
tasteful dealings with the Royal Auto-
mobile Club. It would perhaps be too
much to expect Mr. Patrick White to!
turn out for the Sarsaparilla Soccer
team, but with his wisdom in the ways
of dogs he might run a tipping servict
for Harold Park greyhound meetings.
Best of all, if it were possible, would
be for Mr. Harris to get together a
brainy Australian Rules side, witk
himself as captain-coach. Some well-
known personalities practically pick
themselves. There could be Dr. Frant
Knopfelmacher playing on the right
wing, Professor Frederick May on the
left, Mr. Donald Horne as a nippy
lover, and Dr. v Leonie Kramer in
charge of the ladies’ auxiliary.
But this is mere speculation. The
important thing is for our intellectuals
i o remember the Australian sporting
tradition. It will be something if we
can only get symposium-writers and
seminar-speakers to do 12 simple
exercises each morning. They, too, can
have beautiful bodies if they try. As
my old gym instructor would have
said, I want you thinkers to keep your
stomachs in and your chests hout.

NEW YORK LETTER
“Herald-Tribune” Wake
With Its Ghosts of the Great Days
THE funeral ser-
vice was held
in the ninth-
floor auditorium of
the Herald-Tribune
Building on West
Forty-First Street at
5 p.m., with mem-
bers of the staff at-
tending, as well as
agents of the enemy
with their TV
cameras and their
interviewing mikes. The wake was held,
after a not-quite-decent interval, at
Bleeck’s bar next door. At Bleeck’s
one remembered other nights when the
opening door might admit magnificent
Lucius Beebe, or slightly reeling John
O’Hara, fresh from the fleshpots of
Hollywood, or roly-poly Joe Liebling
from the “New Yorker,” or Tallulah
Bankhead, stil wearing make-up, from
the theatre around the corner. And
wartime nights with Australian cor-
respondents in transit from the Pacific
to the European theatre Bunny
Austin, Dave McNicoll, rotund Alan
Dawes, Ozzie White on crutches after
the New Hollandia invasion, and big
Ray Maley.
Yes, Bleek’s was ghost-ridden that
night. James Thurber and John Lard-
ner had perfected the match game at
the bar. Bob Benchley and theatrical
agent Dick Maney dreamed up a hun-
dred pranks at the corner near the
door. And former publisher Ogden
Reid, chain-drinking martinis, custom-
arily held his editorial conferences at
the bar with leader writers Geoffrey
Parsons and Henry Cabot Lodge.
!A T about 5.30 p.m. Red Smith (the
once fiery thatch now completely
white) walked in from the funeral ser-
vice, with columnists Jimmy Breslin and
Dick Schaap following soon after. As
usual, Red said it better than anyone
else: “It’s like the death of a woman
you’ve lived with for years and when
you know she’s been kicked to death
there’s anger along with grief.”
At the death-sentencing cum funeral
service earlier, publisher John Hay
Whitney, clad in banker’s dark grey,
had been obviously depressed as he
announced the final closing of the
strike-ridden newspaper after 133 years
of honorable service to the community.
Mr. Whitney is a decent man of
great wealth who had been pouring
five million dollars down the drain
for the past five years in a vain effort
to keep the “Herald-Tribune” alive.
Now he evoked gloom and not a few
tears from the remnants of his staff as
he gave them their notice. “This is a
day of mourning ... I have never been
involved in a more difficult or painful
decision than the one not to resume
publication . . . the “Herald-Tribune”
had a voice, a presence, a liveliness of
thought and a distinction of style . . .
it was a newspaper to be proud of . . .”
When he finished, there was applause
for the man’s obvious sincerity. Only
the TV interviewers wanted more:
“Were the unions to blame for this?”
“This is not a time for recrimination,”
replied Mr. Whitney as he started to
walk away. “Is it true you were just
tired of it all?” persisted another TV
man. The publisher stopped and said
quietly, “I have never been tired of it
all. I am very sad that we have not
been able to make it.”
The events leading up to the tragedy
can be told in a few melancholy para-
graphs. The jungle of conflicting in-
terests on the New York labor-union
scene and ever-increasing competition
from television and booming suburban
newspapers have led to three crippling
newspaper strikes in the five years since
Mr. Whitney acquired the “Herald-
Tribune.” The most recent strike,
which began more than three months
ago when the “Herald-Tribune”
announced its intention to merge with
the “New York World Telegram” and
“Sun” and the “New York Journal
American,” was perhaps the most
senseless of them all. It has not only
killed off the “Herald-Tribune” but
still prevents the other partners in the
merged paper from publishing their
proposed evening and Sunday news-
paper.
It has left this city of nearly ten
million people with three newspapers
(where fifteen flourished at the turn
of the century) the “New York
Times” and the “Daily News” in the
morning and the “New York Post” in
the evening. Of the three, only the
“Times” is a serious newspaper in the
old-fashioned sense.
We had all known for a long time
that the end was near but when it came
the hurt was surprisingly great. The
“Herald-Tribune” was the newspaper-
man’s newspaper. The “Times” is too
big, too serious, too dull ever to inspire
the special kind of affection that bound
its readers to the “Herald-Tribune.”
The newspaper had a splendid past, as
the inheritor of the traditions of Horace
Greeley and James Bennett, the twin
giants of 19th-century journalism. It
attracted the bright young men from
the best universities—and the simply
talented ones without a college degree.
During its heyday it brought intelli-
gence and encouragement to every
moral and social crusade. It was the
voice of Republican liberalism. In its
last two years, it dared to pioneer with
untried formats, gave young talented
writers and editors their heads, and
was by far the most exciting and enter-
prising daily in the land. But all to no
avail. There was always the great
grey “Times,” with its enormous adver-
tising lineage and nationwide circu-
lation, standing in the way, the unbeat-
able competitor.
The passing of the “Herald-Tribune”
(plus the still existing union threat
to the unborn merged “World Journal
Tribune”) places New York city in the
all-too-familiar pattern of other big
U.S. cities, many of which boast but
one newspaper in the morning and
one in the afternoon. In many cases,
both newspapers are published by
the same management, out of the same
premises. The newspaper industry in
this country is receding steadily into
what has been called “local monopoly.”
Whether this is a result of —or a
contributing cause of the increasing
conformity of American life remains a
moot question. At any rate, the “Her-
ald-Tribune,” is dead—and ask not for
whom the bell tolls.
full flavor of the “Herald-
Tribune” will not be completely
lost to the New York journalistic- scene.
Most of its columnists had been placed
under contract to the new “World
Journal Tribune,” and will appear in
that publication if and when it is
printed. These include Red Smith,
America’s most literate sports writer;
film critic Judith Crist, whose caustic
reviews have made her anathema to
Hollywood; fashion writer Eugenia
Sheppard, “the voice of Seventh
Avenue”; and daily columnists Jimmy
Breslin and Dick Schaap. Other noted
“Herald-Tribune” bylines, notably that
of Tom Wolfe, will be seen in the New
York magazine section of the projected
new' Sunday newspaper. Walter Kerr
has been offered the post of Broadway
theatrical reviewer on the new paper,
but so far has not accepted.
“This thing about the ‘Herald-
Tribune’ being dead is not quite true,”
Frank Conniff, editor of the “World
Journal Tribune,” insisted. “It wall live
on in the new situation.”
An intriguing aspect of the disap-
pearance of the “Herald-Tribune” is
the effect its absence might have on
the “New York Times,” now the sole
broadsheet in the morning field. Clifton
Daniel, managing editor of the “Times,”
said:
“The ‘Times’ considers itself very
much in competition on several fronts.
TV and radio are competitive,
since they make an appeal to people
who read the “Times.” The “Times”
remains in direct competition with the
old “Herald-Tribune” in Paris, where
we both publish international news-
papers.”

“I’m home ,
Baby,
I'm home ”
Short Story by Ian Mudie
IT was five-nineteen, just like it always
is when 1 get home. As soon as I
came in the front door I yelled out,
“I'm home, baby, I’m home.” Just as
I’ve done every night during our three
years of marriage. Only it’s not right
to say I yelled. Marge wouldn’t like
anyone that yelled. I just sort of sang
it out. Yes, sort of sang it. You know,
“I’m ho-ome, bab-ee, I’m ho-ome.”
But she didn’t call out “Yo-ho-oh-ee”
back like she’d done every night since
the day after the honeymoon, when I
started singing out, “I’m home, baby,
I’m home.” And that first time she
did it I said, “I liked the way you
answered me. Always do that, won’t
you?” And this time, when there wasn’t
a sound, I thought, I know, she’s been
talking on the phone to Jean or one
of the other girls she used to teach
with, and she’s suddenly realised the
time and rushed in to put some lipstick
on. So I stood there for a couple of
seconds, imagining her at the vanity
bar in the bathroom with her mouth
sort of quarter open and her lips held
stiff, pushed out towards the mirror.
And I gave her a couple of seconds
more to let her rub her lips over each
other to smooth the lipstick. Then I
sang out again, “I’m home, baby, I’m
home.”
But still she didn’t answer. So I
panicked. Perhaps she’d fallen and hurt
herself! So I ran to each of the rooms
in turn. But she wasn’t anywhere.
Although, except for the fact that she
was missing, there wasn’t anything un-
usual. Just everything spick-and-span
and in its place, just like she always
keeps it.
When I’d looked out the back door
to make sure she wasn’t taking a pair
of stockings or something off the rotary
line, I thought, I know, she’s found
she’s out of sauce or mustard or some-
thing, and she’s popped in through the
hole in the fence to borrow some from
Cynthine; and they’ve got talking and
she hasn’t noticed it’s time for me to be
home.
So I grinned to myself. When she
woke up how she was late and came
rushing in saying how sorry she was,
I’d be a real tease. I’d tell her that if
she wasn’t there in future when I came
in and sang out “I’m home, baby, I’m
home” I’d show her I’d work back
at the office with Miss Lashman. And
then, seeing Miss Lashman is well past
sixty, we’d have a good laugh . . .
I waited for about two minutes.
Then, for something to do, I looked
in the oven to see what was for dinner.
But the stove was cold; there wasn’t a
thing in it . . .
This really hit me. I jumped to the
kitchen window and stuck my head
out, just as Marge does when she wants
to speak to Cynthine. And I sang out
“Yo-hoo-oh-hee” just like she always
does to attract Cynthine’s attention.
Whenever I’ve done that in the past
it has always been Marge who has put
her head out of Cynthine’s kitchen
window. And she’d call out, “Coming,
Jack,” for she’s known it’s meant some-
one has come to see her or she’s
wanted on the phone.
But this time it was Cynthine who
leant out of the window. For a second
I hoped she’d say, “I’ll get Marge.”
But she didn’t. She said, “What’s up,
Jack?”
“Isn’t Marge there?” I said.
“No, Jack, why?”
“ ’Cos she isn’t here.”
“Isn’t there?”
“No.”
“But, Jack, she’s always there when
you get home, except on Fridays, when
you go to lodge and she goes to her
mother’s.”
“I know. But she isn’t anywhere.
You don’t know where she is, do you?”
“No, Jack. Surely nothing can be the
matter.”
She drew her head back in for a
moment and I knew she must be look-
ing at the clock. Then, “Hang on a
tick,” she called out to me. “I’ll just
turn the stove down. Then I’ll be over.
Tom won’t be home for ten minutes
yet.”
So I met her at the hole in the fence,
and when she’d ducked through it we
hurried toward the house.
“Wherever do you think she could
be, Jack?”
“I don’t know. I just don’t know.”
“You’ve looked everywhere?”
“Yes, everywhere.”
“In the . . . you know; she could
have been taken ill.”
“Yes, I’ve looked in the bathroom.
She’s not there. She’s just not any-
where.”
But, all the same, we went all
through the rooms again. And Cynthine,
who watches TV till the last channel
shuts down at night and watches a mid-
day movie, too, even looked under the
bed in the spare room, and in the
walk-in ’robe in the main bedroom, and
pushed aside the clothes that were
hanging there and looked behind them.
But Marge wasn’t anywhere. Not
anywhere.
“Jack,” Cynthine said, “I think I’d
better make you a cup of tea. When
Tom comes in he’ll realise where I am
and come in.”
“The kids,” I said, “what about their
tea?”
“Jack, it’s Wednesday.”
“Wednesday.”
“Yes, drive-in night for Tom and
me.”
“Oh, yes, of course; they’re over at
your mother’s.”
“Yes, at Gran’s. She loves having-
them, too. Says it makes her week.”
She lit the gas. “So there’s only Tom to
worry about; and, as I said, he’s not
due home for a few minutes yet.”
But it was one of those nights when
Tom didn’t get home on time. Prob-
ably “trapped in the pub by the
blokes,” as he usually describes it when
he’s late. So we had two cups of tea.
Then Cynthine suddenly said,V‘Oh,
Jack, the dinner!” She jumped up from
the table. “You just sit there,” she said
as she rushed out the back door. “I’ll
be back when I’ve turned it right off.”
WHILE she was away I suddenly
thought of the garage. Sb I raced
out there. But Marge hadn’t fallen and
stunned herself, or got into the Holden
and been taken ill, or anything. She
just wasn’t there.
As I was going back inside I met
Cynthine coming from their place. “It’s
all right,” she said “it wasn’t burnt.”
“The garage,” I said. “I’ve just been,
there.”
“Nothing?”
“No; no sign.”
“The Holden?”
“It’s there.”
“Oh, Jack, that’s good.” She went
in through the back door, which I was
holding open. “I mean, she hasn’t been
in an accident.”
“But she never goes out without the
car.”
“No, neither she does, Jack. Remem-
ber that time both our phones were
out of order; she even drove up to the
corner to ring Complaints.”
“I know, that’s what makes it so
worrying.”
“Yes, it’s funny, all right, Jack.”
So Cynthine made a fresh cup, and
we went over everything again. Not
that there was really anything to go
over. Marge and I had got up at the
usual time that morning. I’d done my
exercises as usual and had a shower
while Marge cooked the breakfast. Then

R. D. MARGINSON,
Vice-Principal.
I’d had my poached eggs as usual, said
“Look after yourself, baby,” like I
always do, and gone off to catch the
bus as I always do. Nothing unusual,
nothing out of routine at all . . .
“What about you, Cynthine; did
you notice anything unusual about
Marge today?”
“Jack, it’s Wednesday.”
“Wednesday?”
“Yes; my day at Gran’s.”
Then I remembered. On Wednesdays
Cynthine always goes straight on to
her mother’s after she’s dropped Haley
and Yve at school. Then after school
she picks them up, takes them straight
to her mother’s, and stays there till
it’s time to rush home and get Tom’s
tea. “Wednesdays,” as she always says,
“is deep-freeze peas and a quick steak.”
I was just thinking about this when
Cynthine said, “Jack, what do you have
for tea on Wednesdays?”
I thought for a second, then, “I
always like roast lamb on Wednesdays,”
I told her. “Why?”
“Well, Marge always makes the
butcher’s her first call of a morning.
Gets there just about nine. Why not
ring Barnett and ask him if she was
there; he lives at Grovene.”
So I rang. I felt a bit of a fool
asking him “Did my wife come into
the shop this morning?”
“As a matter of fact,” he said, “she
did. I’m still wondering what was
wrong. I always keep her a nice bit
of lamb on Wednesdays. So when she
came in I said ‘Morning, Mrs. Smith.
Here’s a nice bit of leg.’ And she just
looked at me and said, ‘You know,
Mr. Barnett, I don’t think I will,’ and
walked out.” He gave a sort of cough.
“Hope nothing’s wrong.”
“I do, too,” I said, and hung up.
WHEN I told Cynthine what he’d
said, she looked even more worried
than ever. “Oh, Jack, that’s not like
Marge. Perhaps she suddenly felt ill
and came home to lie down.”
“But her divan isn’t disturbed.”
“Oh, you know Marge. She’d tidy
it up afterwards, no matter how she
felt.”
“You don’t think . . . perhaps that
she’s gone to hospital? Surely Dr.
Walker would have rung me.”
“All the same, Jack, you’d better
check.”
So I rang him; but she hadn’t been
in touch with him all day.
“It’s not that,” I told Cynthine.
“But perhaps when she rang him he
was engaged. Perhaps she felt so bad
she couldn’t wait and rang someone
else.”
So I tried all the other doctors in
the district. None of them had heard
from her. A couple were quite sharp
about my ringing. One said he was in
surgery and one that he was having
dinner.
Just as I finished there was a shout
at the back door. “That wife of mine
here?”
It was Tom. He was a little tight,
as he always is when he gets home
late. If Cynthine realised it she didn’t
let on, although she usually turns on
a bit of an act. She just brought him
in, sat him down at the breakfast-nook
table, gave him a cup of tea, and told
him the whole story what there was
of it to tell.
“That’s bad, Jack,” he said when
she’d finished. “Look, hope you don’t
mind my asking, but you haven’t had
any blues with her lately? Haven’t been
playing round, have you?”
“Oh, Tom,” Cynthine said, “you
know very well they’re the happiest
couple. And Jack’s just the nicest hus-
band.”
“I don’t know anything of the sort,”
Tom said a little nastily. “Neighbors
don’t see everything. Bet Jack and
Marge don’t know when we have rows,
except every few months when you
get mad over nothing and start yelling
your head off at me.”
“Oh, Tom,” she said, “you’re impos-
sible. No one could say we aren’t happy.
You know very well I never . . .” and
she sort of let her voice trail away
to nothing.
Tom didn’t take any notice of her.
“Look, Jack, this might be a clue. Did
you notice anything unusual when you
got in tonight? Anything out of the way
at all?”
“No,” I told him. “I was right on
time, as usual, and when I came in the
front door I sang out, ‘l’m home, baby,
I’m home,’ like I always do. But she
didn’t answer me. She wasn’t here;
she just wasn’t here.”
“Well,” he said, “that’s not much
help.”
“No.”
“She didn’t leave a note saying she’d
cleared out or anything?”
“Oh, Jack,” Cynthine said, “how
could you!”
He stared at his teacup. “Sorry, I
just asked.” Then he slapped his knee.
“Of course, her old lady. Bet you!
Her old lady rang up to say she was
sick and Marge rushed across to Wood-
ville to see her.”
“But she would have taken the car,”
Cynthine told him in a voice that
meant “you silly fool.”
“But when she got out of the garage
the car could have been crook per-
haps the battery was on the blink. So
she rang for a taxi.”
“But she would have rung me at
the office first.”
“That just shows you, Jack,” he said,
“the old duck’s so sick that Marge
had to go off with a hell of a rush. Bet
you that’s it. You ring Marge’s old
woman’s number and I bet it’s your
trpuble-and-strife that answers the
phone. Go on.”
“Yes, you’d better check, anyway,
Jack,” Cynthine said. “Even though it
doesn’t seem to fit in with that business
about the butcher, Tom might be
right.”
“Yes, I suppose. But then she would
have rung me when she got to her
mother’s. Or at least within a few mom-
ents of my coming home. Marge
wouldn’t want me to worry.”
Then I rang Marge’s mother. I hated

doing it. She’s never forgiven me for
being seven years younger than Marge
and being what she calls “so quiet and
stick-at-home” and “hardly in Marge’s
mental class, are you, Jack?” And for
not having a better job. And she makes
so much fuss even over the smallest
thing; I could imagine what she’d be
like over this.
And she certainly was upset. Marge
hadn’t given her the usual ring that
morning, and she’d been so worried
she’d tried our number only she
called it “Marge’s number” half a
dozen times during the afternoon, and
had just been waiting until “Marge
had got dinner over” to try again.
She kept saying, “Oh, Jack, Jack, what
can have happened to my girl?” Then
she made up her mind that Marge had
been taken ill, lost her memory, wan-
dered off somewhere, and been knocked
down by a car in a daze and taken to
hospital. She wanted me to get the
Holden out and go to every police
station and see if they knew anything.
Then she said, “Oh, Jack . . . you
don’t think ... the morgue . . .”
“Oh, Mrs. Bertelsmeir,” I said, “I
don’t know what to think.”
“WELL, you’d beter get in touch
T with the police at once. And mind
you ring me back straight away.” Then
she hung up on me.
So I rang the local police station.
The chap there said to ring the central
station, so I did. The chap there was
very decent, but they’d heard nothing.
If they did they’d let me know. In the
meantime if I could tell them what
clothes she was wearing it might help.
So I hung up and told the others.
“I’ll look in the ’robe,” Cynthine
said, “and see if I can think of any
dress that isn’t there.”
While she went up to the main bed-
room to look, I rang Marge’s mother
again.
“Mrs. Bertelsmeir, the police don’t
know anything, but they’ll keep in
touch.”
“Oh,” she said shortly. Then, very
slow, “Young man, have you been
treating Marge properly lately?”
“Mrs. Bertelsmeir,” I said, “I’ve al-
ways treated Marge properly. No one
knows that better than you do.” Then
I hung up on her.
When I turned round, Cynthine was
standing in the doorway, white and
crying.
“You’ve found her!” I said, getting
up. “Is she . . .?”
“No, Jack, nothing like that. Sit
down.”
“But what’s wrong?”
“Jack, I was so upset when we were
looking through the ’robe before that
I didn’t notice. Quite a lot of her
clothes are missing. Two evening dresses
and her fur stole, too.”
“But if someone’s pinched them . .
“Jack, dear, you’d better face it
I think she’s . . . gone.”
“Marge!” I said. “Marge gone! But
why?”
“Women!” Tom said. “Women! You
can’t fathom them.”
“Perhaps she left a note, and we
didn’t notice it,” Cynthine said. “Let’s
look again.”
So we went right through the house.
But there wasn’t a note anywhere.
When we’d finished searching we sat
down in the lounge-room.
“Shouldn’t you be getting home to
your dinner?” I asked them. “It’s
awfully late for it. And what about the
drive-in?”
“Bother the drive-in,” Cynthine said.
“And I don’t feel like a bite to eat;
do you, Tom?”
“Well,” he said, drawling it out, “per-
haps a bit later.”
“And, anyway, Jack, when we do
have dinner you’ll come home and
share with us. Won’t he, Tom?”
“My oath!” Tom said.
“Thanks,” I told her, “but I’d rather
stay here. She might ring up. Or even
come home.”
“Oh, Jack, dear, you’ll have to face
it, it looks as if she’s gone for good.
And I always thought she was so
happy.”
“So did I.” I locked around the
room. It was so much her room that
I almost cried. I began to wonder if
she’d really gone, and because she was
too good for me. There were all the
things that showed what a brainy sort
of person she was pictures that didn’t
seem to someone like me to have any
meaning; two whole shelves of readers'
club books; the radiogram with the
Barry Humphries record she’s always
playing; a pile of Digests; the last Sat-
urday’s Australian folded open at that
Max Harris bloke’s article; and the
copy of “Gone With the Wind” that
she’s read twice and is always saying
she’s going to read again when she
gets time all kinds of things that
no one but her would be able to ap-
preciate.
I turned to Cynthine. “She hasn’t
said anything to you lately to make
you think . . . you know, that she . . .
that things weren’t quite right?”
“No, Jack; no, I don’t think so.”
She paused. “One day last week she
did say something, about it being a
wonder we didn’t call out to each other
from our kitchen windows to a time-
table. But I don’t think it meant any-
thing. You know, Marge what with
all her reading and everything she
sometimes says odd things that you
can’t quite understand.”
“Yes,” I said, “there’s no doubt she’s
real clever. There are times when even
I can’t fathom her.”
“Blest if I can fathom any woman,”
Tom said. “You should hear some of
the things that Cynthine says! Make
your hair stand on end.”
“Tom,” Cynthine said, “you know
very well I’m perfectly normal.”
“Normal woman,” he said, “that’s
about all,” and laughed.
“That’s enough.” Cynthine put her
hand on my knee and squeezed it. “You
want to be glad, Tom, that you don’t
have Jack’s troubles.”
“She’ll be back,” I said. “Marge will
be back.”
“That’s the boy,” Tom said, .“never
say die.”
Cynthine spoke as if she was quite
angry with Marge. “Oh, Jack, Jack,
and you’ve always been so good to
her.”
“She’s always been pretty good to
me,” I said, “and she’ll be back. I
know she will.”
And I’m so sure she will that when
I go off to the office each day I leave
the front door unlocked in case she’s
lost her key. And each night when I get
home at five-nineteen I sing out “I’m
home, baby, I’m home,” the moment I
step inside.
But so far she hasn’t been there to
answer me.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Play on Vietnam Theme
By J. C. KAYE
LAST March Alan Hopgood wrote a
play about the impact of the Viet-
nam war on Australians, and on
September 5 it opens at the Russell St.
Theatre, Melbourne. Already the word
is around that this is an “anti-con-
scription” play, and people are writing
letters to newspapers about it. Despite
the seeming protest of its title, however
- “Private Yuk Objects”-—it is not an
“anti-conscription” play at all, but
a play about the confusion created in
the minds and hearts of a middle-class
Melbourne family by the war and the
conscription of 20-year-olds introduced
in Australia to provide soldiers for it.
My authority for this is Alan Hop-
good. The working out of his play
is an analysis of Australian characters
faced with uncertainties of feeling,
knowledge, and commitment. Anyone
who goes along expecting anti-Vietnam
propaganda, or any political soap-box-
ing of the author’s views, may want his
money back.
To clear up another misunderstand-
ing immediately, Alan Hopgood, 31, is
not Alan Seymour, although he played,
in Perth early this year, the lead in
Seymour’s last play, “A Break in the
Music.” He is the author of “And The
Big Men Fly,” a satirical comedy on
Australian Rules football, which was a
satisfying success in Melbourne and
Adelaide, and of “The Golden Legion
of Cleaning Women,” about the world
of business. He has also written
“Terribly Terribly,” a “black comedy”
about Melbourne society life. This
has so far not found a stage in Aus-
tralia, but will be produced soon in the
United States by the drama group of
the University of California. Still
another play, about religion, revivalism
and Billy Grahamism, is also awaiting
an outlet.
“Private Yuk Objects” crystallised
in Alan Hopgood’s mind when a
couple of United States technical
sergeants were released by the Viet
Cong after two years’ imprisonment.
The Americans, although showing no
visible signs of brain-washing, wanted
to join anti-war groups when they re-
turned to their homeland. Their be-
haviour gave the playwright the nudge
he wanted. When , the idea had taken
shape he wrote his script in a week or
two.
“Private Yuk Objects” was commis-
sioned by the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, and will be produced by John
Sumner for the Union Theatre
Repertory, where Hopgood himself
acted and produced while taking out
an honors B.A. and a Diploma of
Education at Melbourne University.
Hopgood is by birth a Tasmanian, but
his ho,me has long been in Melbourne,
where he lives with his wife, formerly
Miss Gay Grunden, a girl from entirely
“Oliver!” with Richard Wordsworth, Toni Lamond, Terry McDermott, Ormonde
Douglas, Alton Harvey, Marion Edward, and Edward Howell. The British musical
is now at Sydney’s Theatre Royal.
outside the eccentric world of theatre,
whom he married last December.
The family of the new play consists
of Father (Michael Duffield), an ML A
of Establishment views on the Vietnam
war and Australia’s duty to be in it.
There are two sons. The younger, to
be played by Dennis Miller, has been
called up, and while not afraid to go,
protests (“with a fairly typical univer-
sity point of view”) that convincing
reasons why he should fight have yet
to be made clear to him. The older
son (with Alan Hopgood in the role)
is a volunteer Australian officer who
has been captured in the Vietnam
fighting, and in prison-camp scenes in
the play, comes under disputatious
interrogation from a Vietnamese
(Brian James) who has had tertiary
education in Sydney. There is a
Mother (Julia Blake). There is a
young sister (Amanda Irving) whose
precocity enables her to take a de-
tached, clear-eyed view of what is in-
volved in the others’ lives.
PRIVATE Yuk (David Turnbull) is a
country boy who feels, when he is
conscripted, the uncomplicated res-
ponse of an unquestioning young man.
From camp, however, he writes such
letters to his father (George Whaley)
that the father comes to town to try
to learn the truth. The father, at base,
is the sort of Australian who says only
“when you gotta go you gotta go.”
But Private Yuk’s protests cause him
for the first time to begin to ask
“Why?”
Why a name like “Yuk”? There is
no special reason. It came to Hop-
good as a striking word. That it has a
note of rustic naivete about it does not
mean that Hopgood is championing
this country lad against others. The
play, he reiterates, is not “documen-
tary,” nor is it propaganda. Sounding
out his own feeling, he believes that if
he were asked to fight in Vietnam he
would go.
The play arises from Hopgood’s per-
ceptions of the state of mind of Aus-
tralian people last March, when pro-
tests here and in the United States
were at their height. He has not
attempted to fit its story into actual
developments that have taken place
since then although it spreads over
several months of action. It is not a
history either.
In point of fact, comparing today
with five months ago, he thinks the
element of protest in Australia against
Vietnam has lessened if anything.
“People are not able to sustain their
involvement for very long,” he said.
“They seem relieved to forget about it.”
“It is a play of no political align-
ment,” Alan Hopgood summed up. “I
have tried to give all sides—or at least
what I feel are the important sides
some sort of statement. I know there
are people who want it to be an anti-
conscription play. Its fault may be that
it is going to disappoint the extremist
elements.”
He went on: “It’s about a family, at
a unique time, in a position where they


show their Australian traits of charac-
ter. It is also about the responsibility
of the older people, the leaders of the
community, to give honest explanations
to the intelligent younger generation.”
A danger for Hopgood, as a play-
wright, too, is that many people will
accuse him of giving sensational treat-
ment to a topical subject just to cash
in. “I don’t knock them for that,” he
said. “I don’t claim to be free of the
idea of ‘commercial’ success.”
But there is an area—he feels —which
Australian writers can honestly inhabit,
where they can write to appeal to the
large body of people outside the usual
pull of the small theatre,
Meanwhile, he writes steadily, if hap-
hazardly, and with no organised hours
of work, learning more from relative
failures like The Golden Legion” than
from sudden successes like And The
ig Men Fly, which he finished in a
wee ; , ! e f° otbab was so

, He never ex P ects to be rich, but is
filled with- optimism. Playwriting in
Australia, he believes, has never been
more vigorous. There should be plenty
of good things to come.
LETTER FROM HOLLAND
Jazz in the Concertgebouw
AMSTERDAM is but one flying-
hour from London, but Holland
is a thoroughly foreign country.
At least 80 percent of the people one
meets speak English, but despite the
similarities between the Dutch and
English ways of life, I felt much more
of a stranger than in Austria or Italy.
Both in the Netherlands and in Bel-
gium I was amazed by the apparent
degree of Americanisation, hit tunes,
Coca-Cola, jukeboxes, and strident ad-
vertising were far more obtrusive than
I could have expected. In Europe, be-
fore the war, the owner of a good radio
set could choose interesting musical
programs from at least a few of the
dozens of stations he received. This is
no longer the case; a search of the
wave-bands, even on a Sunday, rarely
produces anything but twelve-string
guitars, crooners, and Beatle-style
music. The exceptions are programs
such as the BBC’s and the Italians’
“Third,” but they can only be received
at relatively short distances.
My purpose in coming to Holland
was not, of course, sociological study
but listening to music. While I spent
much of my time as an ordinary tourist,
I also attended the 19th Holland Festi-
val, which featured concerts, plays, and
art shows in every major town of the
country.
Musically, the accent was on our
century and participating orchestras
from Holland and Germany, under
conductors Karajan, Ancerl, Boulez,
Haitink, Fournet, and Maderna played
works by Fortner, Stravinsky, Messiaen,
Vorisek, Varese, Bartok, Berg, Schon-
berg, and Webern in addition to stan-
dard classical fare leavened by Mahler
and Bruckner. There was also quite a
lot of new chamber music by Birt-
wistle, Will Eisma, Berio, and Hart-
mann, as well as a whole program of
Reger songs and two jazz concerts.
Among well-known performers who took
part were Menuhin, Herman Krebbers,
Rita Gorr, Henkemans, Maria Stader,
and several fine chamber ensembles.
The three events I attended during
the Festival’s final three days were a
rather mixed batch. The first, in the
venerable and acoustically wonderful
Concertgebouw, was advertised as a
Jazz Concert. It turned out to be a
“Big Band” event, not very interesting,
poorly attended and with jazz sadly
lacking. !
For my second concert, I travelled
to the Hague and heard a performance
of Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis” in the
Kurzaal of Scheveningen, the well-
known and icy North Sea resort. The
Resident Orchestra was conducted by
Willem van Otterloo in the absence of
the ailing 86-year-old Schuricht. Otter-
loo, who has been responsible for some
fine performances in Australia, was less
successful on his home ground. The
orchestra proved to be far from first-
rate and one remembers very poor
horns and pretty awful brasses, to say
nothing of the almost entirely off-pitch
playing in his soli by the mercifully
unnamed concert master. The singing
was, on the whole, of a higher standard.
Soprano Ingeborg Reichelt has a very
lovely full voice, and although she sang
off-pitch at times this was, very prob-
ably, caused by the accompanying
violin’s meanderings. Norma Proctor,
the alto, was unexciting but certainly
good enough to deserve employment in
a better performance. Yi-Kwei-Sze, the
Chinese bass known to us, was out-
standingly good and I only wished the
orchestra had allowed me to hear him
more clearly.
Luckily for me, the Festival’s final
night, though poorly attended, was
something of a feast. At the Concertge-
bouw, I heard the Netherlands Cham-
ber Orchestra conducted by David Zin-
man, already favorably known from a
few recordings. Zinman, who is only
30, has succeeded Szymon Goldberg
as this ensemble’s permanent conduc-
tor, clearly on merit alone. I believe
the ABC have been negotiating with
him, but existing commitments make
an early visit to Australia unlikely; he
asked many questions about the Aus-
tralian musical scene and I hope to
have whetted his appetite for such a
tour. Zinman conducts with admirable
restraint and clarity, free of all
exhibitionism; the orchestra consists of
about 30 players, led by brilliant
Thomas Magyar.
American 26 - year - old Stephen
Bishop played Mozart’s last concerto,
K. 595, in a manner befitting Rachmani-
noff rather than Mozart. With a big
piano tone, over-pedalling, and some
uncalled-for schmaltz, he was rsther
abetted by Zinman’s terribly slow tempi.
As Mr. Bishop has a sure touch and
good sense of phrasing he may, with
increasing maturity, prove worth watch-
ing.
PAUL FRCLICH
TELEVISION
Slow Start
NATURALLY, the success or failure
of a new series depends as much
or more on its program place-
ment as on script, actors, and publicity.
The Channels 7 in Sydney and Mel-
bourne have chosen 7.30 p.m. as the
time for “My Name’s McGooley
What’s Yours?” going for the kind of
whole family audience enjoyed by “The
Beverly Hillbillies.” In Sydney the new
comedy show is against “Perry Mason,”
a good new action show named “Con-
voy,” and a not-so-good English comedy
series, “Meet the Wife.” In Melbourne
the opposition will be “Alfred Hitch-
cock,” on GTV9, “The World of Woo-
ster” on ABV2, and a 7-8 p.m. show,
a BBC comedy series named “Here’s
Harry,” on ATVO.
On opposition alone, Hitchcock and
two varied British comedies, and on
the dull-thud effect of the premiere
episode, I would not give “My Name’s
McGooley” a ghost of a chance in
Melbourne, and little chance of success
in Sydney, where it has the disadvan-
tage of being followed by a reshowing
of “The Rag Trade,” which emphasises
how many humorous situations should
occur in a half hour.
With those points made, indicating
the strong opposition “McGooley” faces
in an effort to establish an audience,
I must admit that I can find little
reason to encourage viewers to desert
other shows for it, except on the scores
of curiosity and fairness to a struggling
new show, likely to go on struggling
unless it improves quickly and man-
ages to catch the hearts of those who
find the image of Domonic McGooley
(Chater) slobbering his cereal from a
plate irresistible.
Although Gordon Chater is the “star,”
and much has been made of that in
publicity, Wally (John Meillon) and
his wife, Rita (Judi Farr), were the
central figures in the first episode. Wally
took a computer error in his pay to
mean promotion, swaggered, decided to
sell the house they lived in (Dom-
onic’s), and while choosing a new'one
unleashed a flood of applicants for the
old, including a pretty pair of men,
that generally wasted man-of-all-parts,
Jack Allen, as an Italian poppa, and a
couple of park-bench sandwich-eaters
who rushed the bedroom for a com-
fortable sit-down.
All of this should have been hum-
orous. Somehow it wasn’t, and perhaps
the reason was found in a later sketch
on “Mavis Bramston” in which a couple

praised “McGooley” to the skies, then
asked Dad (Chater), who was asleep
in his chair. The pace of “My Name’s
McGooley” was strictly for the tortoises,
both in motion and speech. I do not
know whether to blame Ron Way’s
direction or author Ralph Peterson’s
producing. Even Chater’s ardent ad-
mirers must have felt cheated over his
lack of opportunity in the proceedings.
Even the one good line he had, “The
staircase’d come down if the borers stop
holding hands,” was thrown away.
Lines such as “I hope it chokes yar”
and “More scandal up there than you
can poke a stick at” were not, unfor-
tunately
What the show needs, even to have
a chance with Chater fans, is more of
Chater’s comic style, and generally less
of the appearance that each principal
is thinking up his own lines as he goes
along, and is slow-witted to boot.

CIUCCESSFUL artistic collaboration
is a rare and mysterious process,
just comprehensible when it
involves two distinct aspects of the
finished article like the words-and-
music teamwork of Gilbert and Sulli-
van. or George and Ira Gershwin. But
how can two men direct a film
together? Kadar and Klos prove that
it can be done; I don’t know what the
division of labor was, and must regard
them as a sort of Siamese-twin partner-
ship, for the tone and development of
“A Shop on the High Street” have
complete unity.
The film is simple enough in surface
construction, unlike the team’s intricate
previous film, “Death Is Called Engel-
chen” (which has had a far too limited
film-society release here.) Tono, a not-
too-prosperous carpenter in a Nazi-
dominated Czech village, becomes,
through the good offices of his go-get-
ting brother-in-law, the “Aryan con-
troller” of a moribund Jewish haber-
dashery. Tono, totally uninterested in
politics, the war, and anti-Semitism,
becomes grudgingly fond of the deaf,
obtuse old widow who owns the shop
and who persists in regarding him as
her hired help. The film starts gently,
as a bucolic comedy, but gradually the
terrible reality intrudes: Fascism is not
a joke, human beings are actually to be
deported to camps, and Tono, to his
own disgust, finds himself willing to
sacrifice the old woman rather than his
own skin.
Racial discrimination is the basis of
“One Potato, Two Potato” as well—
it’s the story of a deserted white woman
with a baby who later marries a negro
and then has to fight for custody of her
child when her wandering ex-husband
returns full of moral rectitude about
mixed marriages. Criticism of such
a film brands you as an unfeeling
monster, and certainly the subject
matter is genuinely moving and im-
portant. Its heart is certainly in the
right place, but little else is. This is
the sort of film which, because of its
sincerity, feels it can beg for your in-
dulgence—everyone was dedicated, it
didn’t cost much, three cameras blew
up during the shooting—(this last from
the publicity release!). Hard luck, of
course, but the audience is only con-
cerned with the final result.
On the same program is “The
Kitchen” (or what’s left of it—it can’t
have been meant to last barely an
hour), a film which may make you
think twice about dining out, set in
the kitchen of a big London restaurant
where the staff work, sweat, joke, and
quarrel while preparing and serving
alarming mounds of food. Like every-
thing written by Arnold Wesker, its
message is needlessly emphatic, and
the cutting is erratic and jumpy; but it
has moments of gripping intensity and
the acting is first class, with a fine
central performance from Carl Mohner.
The organisers of the first N.S.W.
International Film Festival placed
great stress on the word “international,”
unnecessarily since a “national” one
could hardly last out one evening. It
was a brave try, but hardly stimulating
there were some interesting, though
haphazardly chosen films, but the
viewing conditions were far from
ideal. The theatres used were Science


Hall at the University of N.S.W., and
the Ritz Theatre, Randwick. The latter
is at least a proper cinema of the old
suburban style, but Science Hall has
nothing to recommend it. It is over-
heated a criticism which certainly
can’t be levelled against the cavernous
Ritz! —the projection is poor, and the
acoustics appalling.
The Festival catalogue (a hand-
somely produced but uninformative
volume) promised discussion groups
and seminars, but these hardly eventu-
ated. Here again the size of the
theatres was partly at fault; in such
large halls discussions end either in
everyone shouting simultaneously in
order to be heard or in nobody open-
ing his mouth for fear of not being
heard at all.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
MUSIC
Promise of nirvana
Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Conduc-
tor, Zubin Mehta. Town Hall, Sydney.
MORE than one hundred musi-
cians, a distinguished inter-
national reputation of 30 years
standing, and a young conductor still
enjoying the upsurge of a brilliant
career is a combination irresistible in
anticipation. This promise of sym-
phonic nirvana, heightened by the
LSO’s successful tour earlier in the
year, was left unfulfilled by the Israel
Philharmonic. Perhaps expectation
exceeded possibility, but whatever the
case the qualities and shortcomings of
the orchestra and its conductor were
established in an attractively definite
manner. If a mistake was made, it was
invariably a howler, and when the
playing was good it was beautiful.
Like some gigantic, black full-stop
to the program, Mahler’s Symphony
No. 1 in D major served as both a
testing and exhibition piece. The strings
performed magnificently whether
casting layers of shimmering lushness
in the first movement or oozing the
sickly sweet melodies which embellish
the grotesque humor of the third
and confirmed an initial impression
that they were easily the most accom-
plished section of the orchestra. Des-
pite their countless opportunities, the
brass could manage little more than a
competent display. Even in the stormy
last movement, where Mahler out-
thunders Berlioz, the trombones re-
frained from that swaggering indul-
gence in all-out, brassy vulgarity which
the music so obviously demands.
Forming the bulk of the program’s
first half, the Schubert Symphony No.
3 found a considerably reduced orches-
tra responding with sensitive flexibility
toward a work of delightful good-
humor and grace. The woodwinds
sang sweetly, especially in the opening
two movements, and injected a
characteristic Viennese sentimentality
into the performance as a whole.
Zubin Mehta is a godsend for those
who view conducting as the most
sophisticated of all spectator sports,
Dark, handsome, and elegant in move-
ment, he is the most visually exciting
conductor to visit Australia since Lorin
Maazel. Although the grandness of his
gestures sometimes leads to rhythmic
untidiness, Mehta cannot be dismissed
as yet another showy fraud. He does,
however, tend to rely heavily on the
interest and excitement aroused by a
well-engineered climax, and where
music is purposefully anti-climactic, pre-
fers to ignore its substance and impose
an atmospheric invention of his own.
When in the third movement of the
Mahler symphony a bizarre mixture
of themes and textures is manipulated
so that it continually leads the listener
into musical dead-ends, Mehta treated
the movement as a placid Adagio, con-
ducting right over the subtle distortions
and preserving the music like so,me
no-longer fragrant violet trapped
between two yellowing sheets of blot-
ting paper.
DAVID SALTER
ON FILM
Nothing left to fight for
VIRTUALLY unnoticed the other
week, Peter Cowie, publisher of
many fine film books and one of
the best-known and most intelligent of
the new English school of criticism,
visited Sydney briefly as guest-of-honor
of the New South Wales Film Festival,
and gave talks on Joseph Losey, “with-
it” director of “Modesty Blaise” and
“The Servant,” during a welcome retro-
spective season of Losey’s work. I seized
the opportunity to ask Cowie what had
happened to that powerful upsurge of
Left-Wing cinema which emerged under
the heading of “Commitment” in the
Fifties, and stemmed partly from the
Kitchen Sink School at the Royal Court
Theatre, partly from Tony (“Tom
Jones”) Richardson and Lindsay (“This
Sporting Life”) Anderson, most fiercely
“committed” of all the “commitment”
crowd. “Well, the battle has been won,”
Cowie said. “They wanted a Labor
Government in. Now the Labor Govern-
ment is in they’ve nothing left to fight
for.
“Besides, Tony Richardson and John
Osborne are millionaires. Joseph Losey
is one of London’s most famous play-
boys. Only Lindsay Anderson has
gone on sticking to his ideals but
he’s bitterly disillusioned. I saw him
at Cannes, during the Film Festival,
unshaven, in a T-shirt, trying to crash
into parties to get free sandwiches.”
How did young people in Britain
break into an industry now, as Cowie
said, two thirds owned by America?
“Well, they go round begging offcuts
of strips of film they can patch together
and use. Then they get various people
to put in £5O each until they build
up a budget of £3OO-£4OO.
“Independent exhibitors in London
are very good. They see these young
people’s films—see every film that is
made, in fact, and try to give them a
showing.
“Kevin Brownlow, for instance, took
ten years to make ‘lt Happened Here,’
about an imagined Nazi invasion of
England. It was very good, and he
now has a union ticket and is working
on company films.
“But unfortunately the companies
which used to sponsor films have cut
down severely on their appropriations.
This, of course, has a good deal to do
with Britain’s economic state. BP
started the director James Hill. Ford
started Karel Reisz, who made ‘Mor-
gan.’ Shell helped John Heyer and
Bert Haamstra. But falling profits
made it very difficult. Now TV offers
the best opportunities—but it’s much
tougher than ten years ago.” Cowie
felt that Tynan had lost his sting,
Richardson and Osborne had sold their
souls, and Anderson had given up hope.
“It’s all so decadent, so fin de siecle
in Europe today. You have a feeling
of the Nineties, of Huysmans, Wilde,
and the Yellow Book.” I asked Cowie
what film summed up the flavor better
than any other of the time. “Roger
Corman’s ‘The Masque of the Red
Death’,” he said, with an air of finality.
Another visitor equally ignored was
the well-known Indian producer-writer-
director Ramanand Sagar, whose film
“Arzoo” (“Love in Kashmir”) was
shown at the N.S.W. Film Festival.
Sagar, a “box-office” director rather
like De Mille, said that the setup for
making films in India was compara-
tively simple. “You make one picture
cheaply, borrowing money from your
friends. Then, if that makes money,
you use the money to finance your next
picture. Gradually, the pictures get
bigger and bigger. Finally, you make
a spectacle.”
The film writer, then, made his own
film, produced it and sold it as well.
Sagar said he had begun as a novelist,
with a book about the Indian-Pakistani
partition entitled “And Then the
Human Died.” He had written a suc-
cessful play, “The Artist,” and had
gone on to write the scripts of 30
successful films in a handful of years.
Indian films had to have singing
episodes in the middle of the action,
didn’t they? “Yes. You see, for mil-
lions of Indians there is no other en-
tertainment. So that dance, comedy,
and song—-all the favored aspects of
theatre, of which they see nothing —-
have to be in films. And, of course,
they see no television, either.”
There was, Mr. Sagar added, no
government help in making these huge
films, but the vast TV-less captive
audience absorbed his product eagerly.
He always either used his own cash,
as he said, or that of Jewish money-
lenders. There were no chains of
theatres as in the Western world and
distributors took on each film as a
separate work, selling it to exhibitors
individually.

FINE OLD SCOTCH WHISKY A

She Was a Camera
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Reporting. Lillian Ross. Cape. $5.80.
I. ,
NCLUSIVENESS is the bane of
American slick magazines: there is
so much space to fill between those
shiny advertisements of Bermuda and
Miami and Nassau that writers for those
markets tend to run alarmingly on.
The “New Yorker” is particularly guilty
in this respect: apart from its notorious
finickiness its every word sieved
through a phalanx of editors with the
brains of painters on pinheads the
magazine’s prose has a terrible em-
balmed deadness, a flatly mechanical
recitation of facts that masquerades as
sophisticated reporting. The eye and
mind continually wander away from
these thin long columns of print at the
back to the flanking pictures of beach
umbrellas, untrodden sand, and blue
seas; stripped of their decor, “New
Yorker” articles tend to look sadly flat,
like linoleum. Such is the fate of Lillian
Ross, who now appears in collected
form in “Reporting”: on cheaper paper,
between severe covers, with a plain
white wrapper decorated by a type-
writer motif, she reads almost as dully
y - .
The book opens with The Yellow
Bus,” an account of the arrival in New
York of 18 members of the senior class
of the Bean Blossom Township High
School, Indiana, visiting the Big City
for the first time. Miss Ross informs us
that their plan for visiting New York
was divided into three parts: “One,
arriving; two, staying two days and
three nights; three, departing.” That
particular piece of information seems,
to say the best of it, superfluous, but
wait: Miss Ross has some more. And
some more, and some more. In fact, she
gives us every single detail of everything
that the Bean Blossom Township High
School of Indiana does during its brief
visit to Bagdad-on-the-Hudson.
To get there, Miss Ross says, took
the group eight hundred and forty
miles in thirty-nine and a half hours,
and she never misses the data after that.
She knows how much money the group
saved, and how the sum is divided be-
tween its members. She lists every
commonplace name in the group. She
follows them to their hotel, to food,
to Coney Island, and on various city
tours. Conversations are written down
and dwindling budgets recorded.
Finally, the group leaves town. And not
for a single moment has Miss Ross
taken us an inch below the surface, or
given us an ounce of wit, pathos, or
irony; she has “made an account,” and
it is as dreary as reading a balance-
sheet.
The reason is clear: Miss Ross can’t
write interpretatively, she can only
record. At best, she can select the detail
which discloses a flaw of character.
But even that seldom happens. More
usually, she simply makes lists as
though compiling some monstrous
Sears Roebuck catalogue of human be-
haviour.
Her article on the Miss America
contest in Atlantic City begins, for
instance, with a typical fact, like some-
thing churned out of a computer:
“There are thirteen million women in
the United States between the ages of
eighteen and thirty-eight. All of them
were eligible to compete for the title
of Miss America.” So what? Is this
meant to be funny, charged with
dramatic implications or what? We can-
not tell, because Miss Ross will not
allow herself to indulge in cruelty or
sympathy. She describes what must have
been a seedy and depressing event—.
pretty girls jostling fatuously for a
tinsel crown —without a trace of humor,
so that the facts, some of which should
have carried a burden of tragi-comedy,
remain just facts and are numbingly
presented in succession. The same goes
for the Mardi Gras ball piece; a mass
of details assembled, some of them
as, for instance, the fact that Henry
Fonda dressed up in royal robes as
monarch of the ballroom he surveyed
—strongly suggestive of all kinds of
irony and misery, yet finally making up
nothing more than a stolid jigsaw
puzzle of the scene, meticulously and
doggedly fitted together.
Later in the book, the author even
succeeds in stripping the subject of
bullfighting of its repellent fascination.
It is only in the last half of the col-
lection that she gets to grips with the
Big Subject: first Hemingway and then
Hollywood, and the making of “The
Red Badge of Courage,” in a re-
print of her famous “Picture,” which
was included presumably in order to
turn a slim volume into a commercially
adipose one.
THE Hemingway profile is as mad-
dening as her more recent one, on
Otto Preminger, which came out too
late for this collection. Hemingway
emerges with every word his amanuen-
sis determinedly records as a stunningly
humorless and inept conversationalist,
yet it’s easy to see that Lillian Ross
finds his talk, movements, and gestures
charged with importance. She accom-
panies him throughout a day and an
evening, and even fluffs an encounter
with Marlene Dietrich, about whom
she has nothing to say more interesting
than that the star sighs twice while
entering a room, and wears a fur coat.
Not a hint of Dietrich’s personality
comes through, simply because Dietrich
neither says nor does anything during
her brief encounter with Lillian Ross
which is particularly revealing. The
writing method by which Miss Ross
strait jackets herself forbids her to
explore Dietrich’s personality by means
of what Dietrich doesn’t say or do; the
description must always be exactly
physical, and the mind cannot be
probed unless it expresses itself through
words that shorthand can handle.
The long, sustained Hollywood piece,
“Picture,” is easily the best thing in
the book because, in it, the material
the struggle to make and finally break
a film that one can’t help feeling
wasn’t worth saving in the first place—•
rivets despite the flat way in which it
is reported. One is impressed more by
Lillian Ross’s fabulous luck than by her
tact or talent: every person she inter-
viewed at MGM from Louis B. Mayer
down seems to have been prepared to
strip himself spiritually naked for her
benefit. Aparently mousy and harm-


less, she sat there in corners of offices,
noting down every cruel detail in what
must have been a massive succession of
notebooks. And many of her details are,
so marvellous that this book has become
a classic —in spite of itself. Perhaps the
final comment on this determined writer
should come from a Metro victim of her
typewriter and her pencil. “Lillian
Ross?” he said, with that glitter of
reminiscent horror which usually only
the name Orson Welles can evoke in
Hollywood. “She took shorthand
faster than anybody I ever knew!”
Reign of Terror
GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
Defeating Communist Insurgency. Sir
Robert Thompson. Chatto and Windus.
$3.60.
IT IS very highly unlikely that a
better book of this length (170
pages) will ever be written about
countering insurgency.
And this not just because of Sir
Robert Thompson’s experience of such
matters: both Chindit operations in
Burma, years of service leading to be-
coming Secretary of Defence during the
Malayan Emergency, and more years
spent in Vietnam as a deeply trusted
adviser of the late President Diem. His
superb grasp of the problem as a
whole stems from the fact that he is
one of the last great civil servants of
the Imperialist Age; primarily an ad-
ministrator, he is moved even in the
midst of violence by a quiet confidence
in the abiding validity of the rule of
Law, calmly but implacably opposed
to those “special methods” which came
to dishonor the traditions of the French
Army, which free men must insist upon
calling torture.
Though he recognises that every in-
surgency must have a public rallying
cry—nationalism, reunification, land for
the landless —and “local seeds of con-
flict” (“contradictions,” as Mao calls
them) to exploit, he points out that
“. . . the insurgents’ strengths, includ-
ing active supporters, in both Malaya
and Vietnam (until the end of 1964)
were at no stage any more than one
percent of the population, and initially
a great deal less than that. This does
not qualify an insurgency as a ‘People’s
Revolutionary War’, but only as a
form of warfare designed to enable a
very small ruthless minority to gain
control over the people.”
The “witches’ brew” of ostensible
causes and contradictions —Communism
of course never being offered or even
mentioned —is not enough to get an
insurgency off the ground. A break-
down, or near breakdown, of civilian
administration in the remoter areas is
necessary: in Malaya the growth of
Chinese “squatters” during the Japanese
occupation (500,000 of them had to
be resettled under the Emergency); in
South Vietnam, areas which the Diem
Government could not properly ad-
minister before the camouflaged war
began. The war had to be waged in
South Vietnam; Hanoi could not afford
the obvious fact that social and
economic development was going ahead
much faster there than in the North.
And so it began in exactly the same
fashion as it began in Malaya: through
subversion and selective terrorism, “de-
signed to keep the population cowed.”
(“It is a policy that is continued right
through an insurgency in order to main-
tain ruthless control and frighten any
would-be supporters of the Govern-
ment. ) As an expert, Sir Robert is
fully aware that in other respects Com-
munist behavior is very correct
(much more correct often enough than
the behaviour of orthodox armies); and
that terrorism is selective: either the
tai get happens to be unpopular or he
is ?nad e unpopular (most effectively of
trough being accused of rape.
Ihere is no shortage of keen female
Party workeis who are prepared to en-
gineei a situation which will justify a
chaige of nature. It does not have
to be proved. )
Of course the efficacy of terrorism
is often challenged by Australian
friends of the Viet Cong from the
safety of their suburbs; people who
have often seen themselves as equipped
to analyse such matters on the ground
of having heroically endured the per-
tinacious, if exceedingly shadowy,. vigi-
lance of ASIO over the years. But the
situation is really not quite the same:
“On one occasion in Quang Ngai
Province, when the Viet Cong regained
control over a village which had been
in Government hands for a time, they
seized the headman and his family,
disembowelled his wife in front of him,
hacked off his childrens’ arms and
legs, and then emasculated him. This
method of dealing with traitors is cer-
tainly an effective way of winning that
‘popular support’ which so endears
insurgent movements to less well-
informed critics of the local government
and of those Western governments
which support it.”
The putting down of insurgency is
a “slow, routine, methodical” appli-
cation of certain measures; the gradual
building outwards from a secure base,
never over-extending one’s resources,
the complete separation of the guerilla
from the population on which he feeds
—destroying first the political organi-
sation, not the guerilla unit—a police
action, more than a military operation.
Under Diem, the strategic hamlets were
built too quickly and without a proper
strategic plan, so that the guerillas
were never properly mopped up and
the hamlets themselves were heavily
infiltrated—and the American-created
army was irrelevant to the kind of

It’s each for himself, and each
Has developed his own technique with an eye
To establish a beachhead. This should
Be their Eden where, under the black tide
Lapping the harbor shore, the gouts of blood
And muck from the meatworks mingle
With the fourth element. Clamor distracts.
There may be enough for all, but who counts?
The skills of riding the air or walking water
Are less than miracles, like that plenty’s horn
Disgorging itself, in someone’s terms, as waste.
Nothing is waste. The beaks and talons
Frisking the waves, and the appetites of water,
Speak cycle, but not end. Debris
Disturbs but feeds. The sounds of festival
Rise as at any party, and guests
Or seabirds fend for themselves, feed, mate,
Mingle and swoop and almost discriminate
Surfing a tide of self while the light holds
And the impersonal music crashes on.

threat encountered. Sir Robert saw
much heroism in the (80 percent
volunteer) army and amongst the
150,000 volunteer para-militaries in the
struggle against Communist insurgency,
but he also saw certain glaring mistakes.
As one of the men who won the 12-
year war in Malaya, he does not, like
progressive intellectuals, see Com-
munist victories as part of an ineluc-
table historical process.
Above all, Sir Robert knows that, “as
in all forms of human contest, an in-
surgency is a test of stamina and will.
The chief role of the foreign Press will
be to condition its own people, which
in turn will have its local effect, to
a long-drawn-out struggle which can
only be won by patience, determination,
and resolution.” Every significant aspect
of counter-insurgency is explored from
“Intelligence” to resources control,
from propaganda to agricultural pro-
duction, from ethnic minorities to the
proper use of airpower (which involves
as little bombing as possible), from the
treatment of prisoners to the training
of civil servants.
Though he points out that his pre-
scriptions are designed for a different
situation than that obtaining now, he
clearly has no doubt that, “just as with-
in a country a Communist insurgency
cannot be dealt with in isolation, so,
in a world-wide context, it is not an
isolated event but an integral part of
the continuing process of Communist
underground aggression through sub-
version and terror. No underdeveloped
or newly independent country can face
this threat alone.”
The book is written in an urbane
professional style throughout, but the
dedication reveals the man beneath the
coolly superb civil servant.
The Prisoners’ Children
By M. H. ELLIS
Convicts and the Colonies. A. G. L. Shaw.
Faber. $7.80.
PROFESSOR SHAW’S book has
been long awaited, and it was
worth waiting for. It adds a new
dimension to the documentation of the
convict legend; or it might be better
to put it that it removes the convict
story one step away from legend and
one toward an understanding of the
facts. It is a work not without its
faults: the mass of information which it
contains might have been more
thoroughly digested. But Professor Shaw
apparently values information when he
gets it and is most reluctant to lose
any detail once he has it in the bag.
There are weaknesses of fact, which
sometimes surprises. It is astonishing to
find a writer who has collected so much
information about the early autocratic
period of government announcing that
Governor Macquarie was the “son of
a Scottish laird” and that he had served
in the army with “gallantry and dis-
tinction.” He was not the son of a
laird but of a small tenant farmer who
was a distant relation of a laird. And
during the whole of his career in the
Army he was not actually involved in a
battle, missing most that he might have
fought in with gallantry through illness.
He was in only one skirmish, which was
not peculiarly gallant. All his distinc-
tion and promotion were gained in
administrative and secretarial positions.
Again, it is surprising to hear that
D’Arcy Wentworth, an educated medi-
cal man, was “not technically a con-
vict.” He was not a convict at all, even
though he had been acquitted of high-
way robbery charges on the basis of
evidence given by his alleged victims,
who contradicted that of the rather
disreputable and untrustworthy Bow
Street patrols. He was, in fact, as free
as air. If he had chosen to take a
ticket to New York nobody could very
well have stopped him.
True, the Royal Commissioner, T. J.
Bigge, very carelessly described him
as a convict and as a notorious high-
wayman, on the basis of gossip and
had to eat his words, lest Dr. Went-
worth’s son eat him. He was, in fact,
as his papers show, the personal friend
of every lieutenant governor and
Governor from King in Norfolk Island
onwards, except Bligh, welcome at
Government Houses, and in the “in-
timacy” of the excellencies. The author,
like most other writers, does not seem to
understand the difference between ad-
mission to the intimacy of Govern-
ment society and admission into official
society. Thus, when he brackets Simeon
Lord, the uneducated linen thief from
Lancashire, and Wentworth in the same
class, he is in error and would have
been, even, if Wentworth had been a
convict in some sense.
Men like Lord, who achieved official
office, such as appointment to the Corn-
mission of the Peace, were naturally
given the privileges to which the offices
would have entitled them, one of
which was attending official functions
including the daily levee over the
Governor’s luncheon table and levees
on Royal birthdays and official occas-
ions. But that did not mean that, even
though the King himself had described
them as “right trusty” in their com-
missions, they had been accepted into
the “Government House set.” Only
one or two, like Redfern, were invited
to Government House dinners. Mac-
quarie was indignant at the suggestion
that they might have been admitted to
his intimacy.
Still, for all such matters, which no
doubt may be sorted out easily in
future editions, the book is one long-
needed because it clearly emphasises
the fact that there was not just one
kind of convict the poor, put-upon
fellow who had poached a rabbit to
feed his hungry grandmother and had
been exiled for life by a cruel squire,
to suffer a life in which the natural
diet of the forlorn was cat’s-tail. And
it also makes it clear that there was not
just one kind of convict over the eighty
years during which transportation to
Australia subsisted; that there was not
a uniform treatment of convicts in all
periods, but that convict life varied
much according to circumstances and
the contemporary impact of crime on
public opinion in England and what
demand for convict labor there was
in the Colony.
JTOR example, in the beginning a lot
of the “people” were farm laborers
or laborers of other kinds because the
Government had at least a vague policy
of sending out some useful men. But
then later, London thieves began to
come in clouds and were followed by
the Irish. These started to drift in
especially after 1798, and if they were
not actually in some sort of rebellion,
they were usually making so much
noise that it sounded as if the first
howls of attacking Sinn Fein were be-
ing heard. They kept the whole colony
disturbed for years and when the popu-
lation reached a numerousness that
dulled the sound of their hurroos, they
continued to provide Australia with
bushrangers, harborers of highway-
men, and other ruffians of considerable
nuisance value the wild colonial boy,
the Kelly Gang—right up till the race
died out with the Kenniffs in Queens-
land at the beginning of the present
century.
The book is really a historical con-
spectus of the convict eras as convict
eras. Read from that point of view,
it provides a very interesting background
to general history as it evolves.
First, there is the period in which
there was little interest in sending out
more than the original lots of convicts.

Those which came in the 1790 s were
largely confined to the old, sick, or use-
less who died like flies en voyage or on
arrival. Then there was the era in
which the Irish with a nuisance-value
formed the bulk of the exports. Then,
the golden period of the Macquarie
age. In all these periods transportation
for most convicts who were not in-
trinsically bad or abnormal, was noth-
ing worse than an emigration to a
place in which they were freer than
when at liberty in England, with
regular and well-paid employment in
leisure hours for those who wanted it,
and the chance to acquire their own
homes and farms. They lived in their
own habitations. The main restrictions
were the ambit of their movements.
They were not generally under prison
restraint because there was no means
of restraining them.
F is ironic that Macquarie, the sup-
posed provider of a father’s tender
care for the wicked, should have taken
the first step to end this state of affairs
and acted toward producing a salutary
change in severity of restraint, even
before the Home Government was
spurred to meet the need for it.
It was in this period that the convict
barracks were established. That was
his own doing, primarily. But it was
not his doing that the change coincided
with a sudden hardening of a frightened
British public opinion along with a
demand to make transportation a more
severe and deterrent punishment.
That metamorphosis arose from the
frightened reactions of the British
property owner to universal theft by a
horde of impoverished returned
soldiers and their dependents, and the
opposite reaction of a horde of would-
be evildoers who were encouraged to
wickedness by glowing accounts from
their forerunners of the glorious life
of a lag in Botany Bay.
Thus, at one and the same stage, the
flow of convicts to Australia swelled
and the joys of being a convict in New
South Wales were very substantially
diminished by official action. This
latter development was due both to the
hardening attitude of the British
authorities and to the need for severer
discipline to control a population being
expanded by the British crime wave, in
which a greater and greater proportion
was coming under jail discipline, a
greater proportion was therefore resis-
tant to discipline and the harder to
control. Moreover, severity became
more marked because of changes in
the nature of the local population
in general.
For one thing, the creation of the
really large estate brought about a re-
markable diminution from the convict
point of view of the pleasures of the
assignment system. It was one thing
to be a beneficiary of “Cox’s Liberty”
or “one of Macarthur’s men,” well fed
and well cared for and almost free of
physical punishment. This given if one
preferred, in the early arcadian period,
to be assigned to an old Newgate pal
out on the “Oxberry,” who made the
sky of freedom the limit so long as
you were prepared to do his stealing
and take the raps for him.
It was quite another thing from the
older alternatives to become a bound
resident of Castle Forbes, or of some
corporation like the A. A. Company
which was almost a government in itself
and therefore a law unto itself.
With the 1820 s and the invention of
scientific bushranging, the liberty of the
ticket-of-leave man became restricted
and a new competitive element arrived.
Up to the time of Governor Brisbane,
it could be said that except for the
very small kernel of acid exclusives,
the community at large was almost
homogeneous—at least either entirely
or in some degree of convict origin and
therefore one big happy family with a
single overriding historic tradition. But,
with the material influx of free settlers
round about 1829, a community of free
origin developed to an extent that it
could more than compete for land and
work with the convict and emancipist
community, and from then onward the
doom of the convict system came
nearer to reality every day. It received
its coup de grace when the great in-
rushes of free men followed its partial
eclipse in 1839-42. Mining entrepre-
neurs of Newcastle, and other indus-
trialists, discovered that a skilled im-
ported free laborer was worth any three
convicts.
Professor Shaw gives a faithful
account of the changes. But it is an
account overlaid with detail which is
pabulum rather for the student who
already has a clear basic understanding
of convict era history. For those who
have no basic knowledge, or very little
of it, the detail and statistics are apt
to create a fog and blur the sharper
outlines.
This is no detraction to the book.
It merely moves it a step higher from
the level of basic information into the
realm of elucidation and corrobora-
tion. Looked at in its proper class, it
is as valuable as anything that has ever
been done in the field for early Aus-
tralian history.
F goes without saying that one dis-
agrees with some of Mr. Shaw’s con-
clusions, as he might disagree with some
of mine, and that there is still much
ground to be covered, especially in re-
spect of the effects of the convict in-
fusion, and of the enduring nature or
otherwise of the convict infusion. As
he notes, there was among the pioneers
astonishment at the excellent physique,
moral character, and industrious nature
of the child population deriving from
the convictry wholly or in part. Yet
in such a book it would have been
impossible to make the needed study
of the nature and extent of their des-
cendants. An even more detailed study
of the physical extent of the survival
of convict descendants and of their
influence in the community is required.
It is ironic that the feature of the
book which secured it most advertise-
ment was a rough incidental guess
which it contained as to how many
people of convict origin exist in Aus-
tralia today. Shaw makes a stab at
500,000. But there are so many modi-
fying factors that it might be called
only a wild guess. From an extensive
experience of the subject, I should say
that nobody could even guess at all
unless he could make an exhaustive
study of re-emigration, the nature and
age and marriage rates of convicts, and
their immediate descendants, and the
virility of the convict races. And that
it not possible. As Shaw indicates in his
appendix and I agree it is
not even possible to say with any
certainty how many convicts came to
this country. I only guess that rela-
tively few families of convict ingredi-
ent have not bred out. This guess or
deduction is based on an exhaustive
study of pioneer families and of Aus-
tralian Shorthorn cattle lines in Aus-
tralia, which make a good basis for
preliminary work, since cattle genera-
tions are shorter than human ones.
Professor Shaw’s book is one which
will have a permanent place among
the research tools of students of early
Australian history. I hope that he will
follow the salutary practice of revising
his editions in the light of the hugely
ballooning supply of new source
material, and not be deterred from
changing his mind, where new know-
ledge warrants it, by the sneers of the
school of critics so rife in the Univer-
tities, who believe that once an his-
torical statement or opinion has been
set down on paper, it should be irre-
vocable as far as the author is con-
cerned. As it stands, the book is an
honest bit of research, painstaking and
hall-marked throughout with evidence
of sedulous and exhaustive investigation
of documents and most other available
sources.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
States of Grumble
IT is quite usual for State Premiers to grumble about the
Commonwealth Budget and to complain that Canberra’s
meanness has left them in dire financial straits. In a
Federal system it is to be expected that governments at one
level will blame governments at another for their problems.
But this year the complaints are louder than usual. It is
quite evident that they do not represent mere political
buckpassing.
The State Treasuries are in trouble and it is worth trying
to sort out why. First there has been the drought, meaning
considerable losses of revenue to the railways which have
to be made up by the various governments. This is a
particular problem for N.S.W. Next is a problem arising
fro,m the formula which determines the Commonwealth’s
financial assistance grants to the States.
New South Wales has special problems this year, coping
with the extra year in its high schools, but generally the
States face ever-increasing demands. Traffic congestion
stealthily but steadily intensifies in Melbourne and Sydney,
and the inadequacy of the current scale of freeway con-
struction is blatantly obvious. The technological revolution
in shipping methods requires a rapid reconstruction of
harbors to take larger ships and provide for the handling
of containers. The availability of vast quantities of cheap
energy in the form of the new natural gas deposits calls
for the quick mobilisation of funds by governments to pro-
vide the necessary pipes and reticulation. And it can be
forcefully argued that these three areas rank very high in
a list of national priorities. The States should therefore get
the money to push ahead with them.
But from where? The Commonwealth, whose responsibil-
ities have grown quite rapidly in recent years, cannot be
expected to rush in; if it is to give special grants then it
must expect to get detailed proposals from the State Govern-
ments. Unfortunately, most State Premiers go to the June
financial talks in Canberra inadequately briefed. It was
no wonder that the Commonwealth refused at the last talks
to grant money for natural gas development, for the sad
fact was that no State had gone to the trouble of making
a formal application supported by an assessment of economic
viability. State Governments will have to work harder in
future preparing solidly argued and documented cases for
Commonwealth money.
And maybe we should not shudder too nervously at the
thought of new State taxes. Stamp duties, motor taxes, and
other traditional State taxes are now extremely high. There
may be a case for State payroll taxes, as Sir Henry Bolte
is said to be contemplating. The alternatives might be worse.
Semi-governmentals
COMING from Australia’s most experienced underwriter,
Mr. Staniforth Ricketson’s views on underwriting semi-
government loans as expressed at the meeting of Sher-
borne Investments last week command attention. As a preface
it is also worth remembering (Mr. Ricketson will certainly
never forget it) that, in the early 19505, J. B. Were and
Son, of which he is still senior partner (but reported to be
stepping down next year), were badly caught in the mid-
MEN AND MATTERS
THE war-time exploits of Peter
Stuart Isaacson need no push from
THE BULLETIN. They are legen-
dary. The publishing trade is also well
aware that the firm he founded after
his bombing days were over, with the
purchase of the Elsternwick “Adver-
tiser” in 1947, and built into a formid-
able network of suburban newspapers in
Melbourne has been forsaking that
field and fast capturing a big slice of
trade publications business Australia-
wide. Moreover, some of. his bigger
rivals have been “nibbling,” as he puts
it.
Now, with twenty-three publications
and a staff of ninety, recently reinforced
by Anthony Whitlock, from Southdown
Press and John Fairfax, as general
manager, the pace at Peter Isaac-
son Pty. Ltd. is hotter than ever. In a
few months the firm moves into new
premises in Porter Street, Prahran
(Isaacson once unsuccessfully stood for
the State seat there now held by
former test cricketer Sam Loxton), and
is about to launch a new type of trade
directory not so far available in Aus-
) tralia to add to his already successful
publications on exports and hotels/
motels.
The new one is an Australian edition
of the Kompass Register, which will
be virtually an encyclopedia of the
sources of supply
(not retail) of all
goods and services
procurable here.
The Komp a s s
Register is a Swiss
idea and is pro-
duced in many
overseas countries.
Isaacson pur-
chased the Aus-
tralian rights from
the International
Publishing Corporation in London. In
the meantime, Isaacson continues to
be a Jack-of-all-trades to his firm (in
which, incidentally, the Herald and
Weekly Times has a quarter share and
provides a useful paternal interest).
NO one who has spoken to Plessey
Pacific’s chief executive, Mr.
George Doust, can be in any
doubt of the importance the whole
Plessey group attaches to fundamental
research. Nor is Mr. Doust able to hide
his concern over the considerable lack
of basic research throughout Australian
industry. He doesn’t find its new pro-
duct development very impressive,
either.
Plessey Pacific has just given an
earnest of its local intentions by bring-
ing back Keith Hollywell from seven

years’ stint as a senior research scien-
tist with Plessey U.K. to head the elec-
tronic section’s Melbourne research lab.
Keith, born in Bunbury, W.A., took his
B.Sc. in Melbourne, following this with
a master’s degree from Adelaide.
What seems significant for Plessey’s
future planning, and indeed for the
direction much of the domestic elec-
tronics industry must take, is that Keith
Hollywell, before going to England,
worked for seven years with the
Weapons Research Establishment in
Adelaide. A mature and research-
oriented defence industry grows more
and more essential to Australia. The
defence plums will go to those prepared.
The Melbourne lab proposes to direct
pure and applied research into micro-
electronics, sonar, defence radio, air-
borne and ground radar, and ocean-
ography.


stream of underwriting a semi-government loan by an abrupt
and unforeseen rise in bond rate.
In effect, Mr. Ricketson wants the authorities to drop the
practice of arbitrarily fixing the terms of semi-governments
and leave them to the underwriters, with their expert know-
ledge of market conditions. Having underwritten an issue,
the ultimate responsibility rests with the underwriters, any-
how.
As he says, while competition amongst underwriters
ensures fair and reasonable terms, the terms recommended
by them must be considered sufficiently attractive to obtain
full subscription to a loan. The underwriting agreement
insures the borrower against any miscalculation on the
underwriter’s part, as well as against the risk of sudden
changes in market conditions jeopardising the success of an
issue.
Margarine Protection
As Professor H. R. Edwards’ full meaning may have been
obscured in last week’s reply to Mr. R. C. Crebbin (8.,
August 27, p. 65), we here expand his comments on Dr.
Harris’ table:
Dr. Harris’ estimate of 73 percent protection is the ratio
of the sum of protection from imports plus the bounty
(£12.8m. plus £12.3m.) to the export f.o.b. value (£34.4m.).
But, as he indicates, this does not take account of
exports. A reasonable counter view would be to say (of
course, in a whisper!) that in effect the bounty subsidises
exports, so that as far as the home market is concerned, the
measure of protection (other than from internal competition
among butter producers) is given by the ratio 12.8/34.4, about
37 percent.
As Dr. Harris estimates, in another table, in the “good”
export year 1963-4, returns due to the protection from imports
amounted to only £6m. and the export f.o.b. value was about
£4om., so this ratio was only 15 percent.
These estimates do not include the difference between
home sales valued at import, as against export, parity. If
there were unrestricted competition in the home market (no
Equalisation machinery), the Australian price would, in fact,
tend to fall to export parity, as supplies would be diverted
from export to the more profitable home market.
Avoidance of this by Equalisation is not protection against
imports, but in effect protection of dairy farmers against
themselves —and while opinions may differ at this point there
is a case on equity grounds, given the structure of the
industry, for neglecting this element in that it does not arise
in respect of other protected industries which are not
exporters. Proponents of the industry would also argue (also
noted by Dr. Harris and the 1960 Dairy Committee, par.
965) that export parity is a theoretical and shifting reference
point in that at this price level the industry would become
a net importer and, with the disappearance of Australian
exports, the world f.o.b. price itself would rise.
Dr. Harris also points out that in making comparisons with
protection to (the average of) secondary industry the above
estimate of 73 percent for butter should be reduced by one-
third to allow for the greater actual production content,
“value added,” in the butter case. This suggests the figure of
49 percent (only 30 percent for 1963-64), and one is tempted
to remark in view of the recent rise to 45 percent in the duty
on fully imported vehicles that “what is good for GM-H is
fair enough for the dairy farmer.” (But the motor industry is
not quite “average” in the relevant respect; GM-H is also
an exporter, etc. In any event, the proper conclusion, no
doubt, is that in both cases the level of protection is too
high.)
Dr. Harris presents as an alternative measure of the pro-
tection afforded the industry the sum of returns due to pro-
tection against imports, plus the bounty, in ratio of home
sales valued at import parity plus exports. For the earlier
period this was (12.8 plus 12.3)/(40.9 plus 23.5), equals 39
percent.
This, perhaps, comes closest to what one seeks to measure
by expressing the incidence of tariff protection in ad valorem
terms.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Mr. Justice Taylor, presi-
dent of the N.S.W. Industrial Commission, believes
the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission is tending
to overthrow “the ’ concept of determining the basic
wage on the needs of a wage-earner to live decently.”
Four days of wool auctions saw prices for most fine
qualities fall by 2.5 percent . . . Freight rates on wool
and general cargo going to Britain and the Continent
are to go up by four percent; refrigerated cargo rates
rise by ten percent . . . The Copper Producers Associa-
tion has cut the domestic price of copper by S2OO a
ton, bringing it back to $950.
Production statistics show that the output of heavy
industry generally grew in the three months to July;
the motor industry and most consumer durables
repeated earlier declines . . . Motor vehicle imports
fell back in July . . . Approvals to build private houses
and flats rose from 9588 to 10,266 in July; non-dwelling
approvals also advanced.
July savings bank deposits added ss4m. to reach a
record $5307.7m.; the gain in July, 1965, was $35.8m.
For the markets: Australian investors have been
pondering overseas perplexities, especially in Britain
and America, as well as expressing a considerable lack
of enthusiasm over the. Budget. So the share
has dropped well back, pausing a little but far from
reversing itself on Friday. Leaders and major base
metals are prominent in the retreat.
Industrials, including an array of blue chips, continue
to be hit in London. A brief rally on Friday could
not hold any part of the line except retails and textiles
. . . Active selling was a feature on Wall Street, widely
spread. Experts differ on whether the bargain atmos-
phere can last in such a booming economy.
For companies: Directors of BHP are “hopeful”
that an evident improvement in the local demand for
steel will continue; they find export sales “mostly not
satisfactory.” The BHP annual report discloses record
capital expenditure of $ 126.7 m. for 1965-66.
Japanese steel interests were rather puzzled by the
withdrawal of U.S.A.’s Cleveland Cliffs Iron Co. from
the Mount Newman iron ore combine; CSR, BHP,
and American Metal Climax plan to carry on . . .
New Zealand’s Tasman Pulp and Paper Co. is aiming
to supply kraft paper board to the Australian market
and has controverted Australian Paper Manufacturers’
charge that it will need to dump; Mr. McEwen warned
all parties against “uneconomic and harmful competi-
tion” . . . F. W. Williams’ shares have been suspended
until shareholders vote on liquidation proposals . . .
A receiver has not been appointed over Marcus Clark
pending receipt of more information on the Waltons’
takeover . . . The U.K. parent of Schweppes (Aust.)
intends to use some local assets to take up the new
issue.
Sydney’s Chevron Hotel brought $3.6m. when sold to
Brisbane’s Whitehouse Properties Pty., a family hotel
company; Chevron cost about sl2m. to build.
Profits pour out unabated, and mixed . . . Signifi-
cantly, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia earned less in its
half-year to June 30 and predicted a slightly lower
result for the full year; six months’ earnings were
$5,231,000 against the previous $5,929,000, the chief
villains being reduced lead and zinc prices . . . Western
Mining Corporation’s issue for nickel is at 3-for-10,
carrying a $2.50 premium on each 50 cent share; total
raisings will be $7,550,400 . . . Profit of a Consolidated
Gold Fields’ group member, Bellambi Coal, dropped
from $376,648 to $307,218, and a 10 percent dividend
was retained.
Pastoral connections suffered for obvious reasons . . .
Woolbroker Winchcombe, Carson had to endure a 60


percent earnings fall, from $607,052
to $247,518, but managed a steady,
uncovered six percent dividend . . .
A 22 percent fall-back came to Pitt,
Son and Badgery, whose earnings

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Thoughts after the Budget
THEY say in economics that think-
ing makes it so. Like most pithy
propositions this is not a general
truth, but it embodies a lot of sense.
And it may be of some relevance to
the effect of the Budget on the econ-
omy.
If the stock market is any reflection
of the thinking of key decision-makers
in industry and commerce, it appears
they do not believe Mr. McMahon’s
assertions that the Budget will prove
expansive in its effects on the rest of
the economy. If enough of them think
this and think it strongly enough, then
they may realise their pessimistic
expectations. By cutting back produc-
tion, laying off men, and pruning
expansion programs, they may collec-
tively bring about the fulfilment of
their individual fears.
As yet this is a theoretic possibility
and there is little evidence to suggest it
is already in process. Two or three
months ago it looked as though there
was a downturn developing in business
capital expenditures; since then these
have shown signs of hardening. March
quarter figures were down some 15 per-
cent on seasonally adjusted December
quarter figures, but it looks as though
there has been a recovery since then.
More significant, the approvals
statistics have shot up inexplicably
but unmistakably again. The July
figure of $46. lm. for private non-
housing construction approvals is the
highest monthly figure ever recorded.
That may be due to an annoying dis-
continuity introduced into the Statis-
tician’s series; it would not weaken the
argument that the past three months
have seen a remarkably large volume
of building plans passed by local
government authorities, a total of
sl2lm. worth. This is comparable with
the great surge which went through
around Christmas, 1964, and which
provided so much of the work which
kept the building industry busy last
year. The current crop of approvals
comes at a welcome time. Together
with housing, which looks like con-
tinuing to pick up slowly from its
subdued but not depressed level, they
will ensure that the building industry
continues to expand at least until the
end of this year.
The motor industry is, of course, the
saddest, softest spot in the economy at
present. The Easter recovery from the
October-November, ’65, slump has
withered badly. July figures showed
registrations down below the 360,000
annual rate, a severe drop on earlier
months when they seemed to be creep-
ing back up to the 400,000 mark.
(Capacity is approximately 450,000.)
Firms I contacted this week say there
was a further deterioration of the order
of 25 percent in the two weeks before
the Budget and that in the ten days
since then there has been no change. So
the August figure may be in the region
of 27,000 to 28,000, an annual rate of
little over 300,000.
rpHERE is a relevant aside which can
be made here, inspired by a day with
the parliamentarians’ army firepower
display. It should be possible to manu-
facture, economically, the armored per-
sonnel carriers which are now coming
into use in the Army.
Perhaps the greatest service the
Government could do for the motor
industry at the moment is to make ex-
porting easier. It can do this best by
energetic negotiations with neighboring
countries to try to get them to agree
not to go in for the blanket tariff pro-
tection of their new industries. It
should be possible to achieve some
access for the products of our motor
industry by offering to set up assembly
plants and encouraging some manufac-
ture of parts in Singapore, Taiwan, and
other countries of the region.

"An Old Tribal Custom"
AT feasts in the darker parts of
Africa, tribal chieftains eat first
and alone. The rest of the tribe
then have to take potluck. I learned
this at a party in South Yarra last
week when Mr. Maurice Deveze,
jnanager of the Banque Nationale de
Paris, entertained the African Ballet,
whose chief supped first in solitary
state. So is it with the Federal
Treasurer. It is customary here for
him to get first whack of tribal
revenues. The States, whose Budgets
come after his, only get the leftovers.
This year it will not be a case of the
States, at least not this one, simply
picking the old bones estate duties,
stamps, licences, and other hardies —•
or coveting others, like income tax,
being reserved by Canberra. Reinforced
by general public opinion down here
that the Federal Treasurer’s passing of
the tax buck to the States this year is
more strongly politically calculated
than usual, Sir Henry Bolte is entering
into the game with even more than
his accustomed gusto. He is cooking
up a new tax which he says has never
been seen here before (one had
thought, pace Adam Smith, that we
had all the taxes possible to cover us
from the cradle to the grave). Only
the vaguest of kites has been flown.
It is shrouded with mystery.

against a dead end, except for a hint
it may be a payroll tax in a new
guise. But roving here and there in
the search, I find some refreshing re-
thinking is being done around the City
on the question of tax reform. For
instance, I find that Mrs. Campbell
Tiech, the Labor candidate who is hop-
ing to chase Mr. Fox out of the Federal
seat of Henty in November, is trying
to convince the ALP to review its tra-
ditional opposition to indirect taxes.
Her idea is to change the main taxa-
tion base from income to expenditure,
mainly on equity grounds.
Mr. C. D. Kemp, director of the
Institute of Public Affairs, tells me
he is thinking along similar but more
strictly economic lines. He explains that
the bias is toward indirect taxation in
European countries, where direct tax-
ation is being increasingly directed to-
ward achieving selected objects. Kemp
feels we will veer in the same direction
here, that taxation will become less
important as an instrument of economic
control and that there will be more
emphasis on special ad hoc adjustment
during the course of the year. He also
sees a growing trend toward getting
revenue via higher charges on public
utilities, though in what sense this can
be regarded as indirect taxation is some-
what obscure. Kemp thinks a separate
State sales tax would be impracticable.
APROPOS of all this, it is well to
Xi. , . • , , ,
bear in mind that the most recent
book on taxation in Australia, that pub-
lished in 1964 in the names of four
authors, foremost being Professor R. I.
Downing, under the auspices of the
Social Sciences Research Council of
Australia, turns its back on “expendi-
ture” as a suitable tax base. Examining
the case put up for this base by Mr.
N. Calder (of Britain) it concludes
“that from the point of view of equity
we are not persuaded that an expendi-
ture tax even when it is made suffi-
ciently progressive is preferable to
income tax.” What is more, “the ex-
emption of saving would systematically
subsidise the accumulation of personal
wealth.”
We have to remember that Down-
ing was one of the strongest proponents
of a State income tax when the Premier
flew that kite two years ago and that
he is still welcome at Treasury Place.
I understand he is still much in favor
of such a tax, but neither that nor a
State sales tax would seem to be likely
candidates. A more intriguing pos-
sibility is whether Downing has been
able to sell Sir Henry the idea of a
tax on net worth. This was the central
advocacy of his book, which reads
equally as refreshing now as it did two
years ago.

Peter Murphy's Case Book
Once upon a time there was a prospectus ...
By CROESUS
IN preferring charges against Mr.
Stanley Korman arising from the
report (issued in May this year) of
the official investigator, Mr. Peter
Murphy, into Factors Ltd., the Vic-
torian Attorney-General could choose
from a wide range of allegations. As in
the case of Stanhill Development
Finance last year, Mr. Rylah has picked
a prospectus.
The matter being sub judice, one
cannot comment on the actual case to
be heard against Mr. Korman in the
City Court later this month (Septem-
ber). It will be in order, to assist
readers, merely to put the particular
prospectus — : that in December, 1958,
for an issue of £1,000,000 mortgage
debenture stock by Factors Ltd. which
brought in £1,184,900 —in historical
perspective; then to illustrate the ques-
tions involved in the case by drawing
from Mr. Murphy’s references in the
same report to a quite separate pro-
spectus, that in November, 1959, for
an issue of registered mortgage deben-
ture stock by Rockmans Ltd. which, in
the interim, Factors had acquired with
the assistance of the funds raised by
its earlier mortgage debenture stock
issue.
It will be recalled that (to cut a
long story short) in 1957 the Korman
interests acquired control of Factors
Ltd., then known as Automobile
Finance Company of Australia, and
early in 1958 proceeded to unscramble
the long - established hire - purchase
(motors) business and to embark on a
broad path of diversification in other
directions, the creation of numerous
subsidiaries (ultimately there were
eighty) and, let us say, whole-hearted
expansion.
'fHE big question facing the new con-
trollers of Factors (to which the
name was changed in 1958), then, was
where the money was to come from to
fertilise their ambitions for the com-
pany. In mid-1957 the then 34-year-
old Automobile Finance Company of
Australia was but a modest, even if
sturdy, little flower in the HP world.
It was activated mostly on bank money
and ordinary share capital. At June 30,
1957, its deferred liabilities accounted
for only £15,875 out of a balance sheet
total of £1,883,751.
As it proved, the burden of the pro-
vision of additional funds was, in the
first instance, put on shareholders and
bank overdraft, then partly shifted to
the general public, and so on to a
milking process of companies acquired
by takeovers. The initial step was to
issue £1,000,000 registered unsecured
convertible notes in June, 1958. Next
followed the issue in December, 1958,
of £1,000,000 mortgage debentures
(oversubscribed by £184,900), whose
prospectus is the subject of the City
Court’s forthcoming attention.
The upshot of these and other moves
(involving substantial sums owing to
vendors of shares in subsidiaries, others
on secured mortgages over various
newly acquired properties and unpaid
accounts under contracts of sale) was
that by June 30, 1959, deferred liabili-
ties had risen from £413,025 to
£5,576,198 in the short space of a year.
Within another thirteen months —
to July 31, 1960 (balance date was
changed in 1959-60)- —the group’s de-
ferred liabilities were up to £10,054,599
(£2,034,000 of the increase being
accounted for by the Rockmans’ de-
benture issue of November, 1959). For
present purposes this is as far as we
need go in time into the rise and fall
of Factors. Here we do not need to
follow Mr. Murphy through his intrigu-
ing and detailed story of how all this
money was disposed, but simply turn
to the matter of the Rockmans’ deben-
ture.
The kernel of the prospectus for
that Rockmans’ debenture was the in-
vestigating accountant’s report to Wal-
ter P. Ham & Co. on the profits of the
company. It reads: “As instructed
by you I have accepted the audited
accounts of Rockmans Showrooms
Ltd.” The audited accounts showed
net profit after tax for the year to
July 31, 1959, was £251,880, compared
with a corresponding amount of £98,443
for the previous year. On the basis
of these audited figures, Rockmans’
dividend for the year was increased
from 5 to 12J percent. That was in
September, 1959. The prospectus for
the debenture issue was dated Novem-
ber 4, 1959, two months later. The
investigating accountant’s report was
dated October 23.
Mr. Murphy takes two large and
separate bites at the profit shown in
these audited accounts. On the first
I shall merely quote him. There were,
he says (page 55 of his report), “at
least two significant facts which
assisted to bring about this marked in-
crease in profits. One is that the
arbitrary figure of £63,932 by which
Rockmans had since 1950 reduced the
stock (trading) was decreased by
£23,932 and £40,000 of this reserve
was fed back into profits. The other
was that Roger David and K. & E.
Rogers were acquired in June (that
is in the course of the 1958-59 year)
and just over £50,000 net profit had
been earned by those companies prior
to acquisition.” His conclusion was
that, although trading had improved,
taking these two items into account
and bearing in mind that in 1958
£70,000 had been written off the com-
party’s stock of evening wear “there was
not a great disparity between the 1958
and 1959 trading itself.”
Mr. Murphy is highly critical of the
practice for which a gateway would
appear to exist in the Companies Act
1961 of allowing an investigating
accountant reporting for the purpose
of a prospectus merely to accept
accounts audited by somebody else. He
says Part 2 of the Fifth Schedule
not specify the type of investigation to
be conducted by a “registered company
auditor” whose report is required ter
be set out in a prospectus.
That is his first bite and, as well as
raising a number of issues about which
we should hear much more in the next
few months, it seems high time the
Act was amended to close the loop-
hole and lay down something much
more specific as to the type of investiga-
tion to be conducted by investigating-
accountants.
M R ; MURPHY’S second bite is even
sharper. Not perhaps as sharp as his
tales of Willowbank, the shuffling of
Chevron Island, the Evandale Estate,
the loans to Korman family companies,
et cetera, but certainly jnore
mysterious. It involves a sum of
£145,935 relating to stock losses which
the directors of Rockmans found it
convenient to transfer as a debit from
the company’s 1959-60 profits back to-
the 1958-59 year, in the somewhat
innocent phraseology of “less adjust-
ment of profit in subsidiary company
relating to previous year.” That would
in effect have reduced the profit dis-
closed for that year (for prospectus
purposes?) from £251,880 to £105,948
(quite apart from any of the con-
siderations relating to stock provisions,
the writing-back of stock reserves, and
the inclusion of pre-acquisition profits).
Mr. Murphy’s casebook leaves us
rather suspended when he passes the
following judgment on this matter. “It
will be recalled,” he states on page 72,
“that Rockmans declared a dividend of
12J percent in 1959 based on their
published profits for that year and had
gone on to raise over £2 million in
a debenture issue in November 1959.
Earlier in 1960 it had forecast a net
profit from trading of over £200,000,
which would not have been realised
if that year had been debited with the
controversial £145,934. In choosing to
debit this amount wholly against the
profit of a previous year, Rockmans had
the benefit of both worlds.”
The epitaph for Rockmans debenture
holders who, though Factors lives on
with Mr. Korman today, lost £818,938
on account of principal as well as un-
paid interest of £173,585, could well
be found somewhere in Mr. Murphy’s
chapter on “How to Make Profits.

Benefits for Containers
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
CONTAINERS LTD. has entered a
recovery situation according to
Melbourne’s leading broker and the
shares are considered promising at cur-
rent prices of $2.80. The dividend re-
turn to investors at this price is about
5| percent after brokerage. The stock
is due for a market reassessment follow-
ing several changes in its prospects over
the past few months. These changes are
expected to break down the factors
which have held earnings steady over
the past four years despite annual 10
percent turnover increases.
The main change was the decision of
Heinz to give Containers the responsi-
bility for' making all its cans. The
significance of this move was not so
much in the extra profits it promised as
in the return of a major food processor
to the fold of the specialised canmaking
industry. .
Another factor has been the recent
changes in the company’s executive
structure. The original merger created
three separate structures and three
autonomous divisions, which have been
preventing the full rewards of amalga-
mation from showing through. Recent
moves have solved many of these
administrative issues according to the
broker, and internal economies should
help boost profits from now on.
The broker says the static perform-
ance of past years reflects the cost of
an expansion policy aimed at lowering
the reliance on the metal operations,
Benefits have been reduced by competi-
tion, but the overall rewards of this
program are due to arise. A lift in earn-
ing rate is predicted for 1965-66, despite
the $3.2 million capital increase created
by the note conversion of last December,
Looking to 1966-67, the interest burden
of the $4 million debenture issue to
finance the Heinz project is expected to
be easily offset by generally rising pro-
fits, initial returns from the project, and
tax savings from the investment allow-
ance on t * ie new P* ant -
And in the long term the Heinz con-
tract should provide a stable source of
earnings because of the size of the ven-
ture and the range of Heinz products,
Generally, then, Containers is entering
a new phase of expansion and should
be regarded in a new perspective,
.
the preliminary report
y T from Alliance Holdings Ltd. of
a 3.7 percent profit rise, year
ended June, was not in AGC s class of
performance, shareholders should be
encouraged by one of the reasons for
this.
Alliance has written off completely
the cost of installing electronic data
processing, yet has assumed that none
of this will be allowable as a tax de-
duction.
Tax is up, therefore, $31,000. So the
reported profit of $790,000 (up
$28,000) might have been as much as
12| percent better, but for this EDP,
which directors are confident will put
Alliance way ahead of other finance
companies in management control.
Earning rate would have been nearer
19 percent than the published 17.5 per-
cent without this substantial “oncer.”
Instead of the 14.6 percent earnings
yield from the 50c shares available at
60c, read 15.6 percent.
FOR those seeking an investment in
the lucrative commercial radio
industry, Victorian Broadcasting
Network must be the obvious buy. It is
head and shoulders above its N.S.W.
counterpart, Macquarie Broadcasting,
following what can only be described as
a brilliant 1965-66 year. Although its
market price is higher, so is its divi-
dend rate, dividend and earnings yields,
dividend cover, and asset backing.
The industry is not facing the same
range of cost increases that confront
the allied television and newspaper
fields. At the same time its revenues
are rising just as fast. VBN’s own
result confirmed this —profits rose 33
percent and dividend was held at 17{
percent on bonus-increased capital. On
that same capital, earning rate gained
from 34 to more than 36 percent. Fur-
ther benefits can be expected from
this fast-grower before very long.
NOW that the initial flurry of list-
ing is over, investors looking for
a promising growth stock should
consider the merits of Melbourne-based
F & H Evans Holdings Ltd. At around
70 cents the 50 cent shares are yielding
an attractive 6.4 percent from the pre-
dicted nine percent dividend for 1966-
67. In fact, payout for the year
could prove to be higher. Earning rate
was more than 16 percent in 1964-65.
It looks like reaching 18 percent for
1965-66 and could well go over the
20 percent mark by the time the cur-
rent year is over.
The company is Australia’s largest
maker of towbars. Other products are
semi-trailer tippers, caravan and bilge
pumps, playground equipment, and
hygienic garbage collection vehicles
which have been sold to councils in
every State, to Federal and State
Government departments, and have
been exported to New Zealand, Fiji,
Macao, and Malaysia. This spread of
business through different sectors of
the economy has long helped the group
The Chartist says:
AMI appears to be going against the general downtrend of the automotive
group and is now a promising recovery situation. After a sharp decline,
where prices fell from a high point of $1.46 in 1960 to a low of 18c in
1962, the stock has formed a consolidation base pattern and the wide fluctuations
of the past four years have established a broad uptrend channel at a basic rate
of 15 percent appreciation per annum. However, since the beginning of 1966,
the stock has been moving in a steeper intermediate uptrend at a rate of 100
percent, and the resistance level of the 1964 peak of 40c was recently broken on
very high volume. A short-term projection of about 62c is indicated, whilst
the base consolidation suggests a further rise to about the 80c level where the
situation would call for reassessment. Last sale price on 26/8/66 —48 c.

Financially the group is strong. Cur-
rent assets are double current liabilities
and if profits keep running at current
rates there will be no trouble in meet-
ing long-term liabilities when they fall
due. Net tangible asset backing at June
30 last was around 50 cents a share.
Add to these factors what appears to
be top-class management and the
shares appear even better buying. The
joint managing-directors are the same
men who founded the company in 1946

IT has been a little-publicised fact
that business interests in .North
Queensland and New Guinea are
considering establishing a shipping ser-
vice between the two areas. If the plan
goes through it will blow a sizable
hole in the Burns Philp domination of
the area’s shipping trade.
The promoters of the new proposal
include the Townsville and Port
Moresby Chambers of Commerce and
the Bougainville Trading Co. in the
islands. They plan to offer freight rates
substantially lower than those prevail-
ing at present. Their current surveys
are aimed at determining whether such
a new service can be established on an
economic basis, based initially on ex-
ports from Queensland. At this stage,
they believe, a suitable volume of
exports are available to establish and
maintain the new service. Time will
tell if they are game enough to chal-
lenge Burns Philp.

can company is concerned Australia
gets the export business.
Milk distribution and processing are
an important part of group activities,
strengthened in 1952 by the acquisition
of N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Pty.,
a company founded by Thomas Sut-
cliffe Mort, pioneer of refrigeration in
Australia.
The recent milk price rise gave
small relief for Consolidated, only 0.4 c
per gallon, and did not apply to its
1965-66 year. The company has con-
denseries at Taree and Grafton. A
Brisbane factory produces Waratah
cheese. Butter is sold under the Foley
brand, distributed by the subsidiary
Allowrie group.
Ice-cream, the original basis of the
company, is produced and sold in
N.S.W. and South Australia under the
Peters, Penguin, and Alaska labels.
This business has hotted up with the
advent of new companies like British
Tobacco with Frozo and Sunkist, and
the invasion of Victorian companies
like Devondale.
gVLI-S to supermarkets of the half-
gallon cans of ice-cream have be-
come very competitive, melting margins.
Accounts show a contingent liability
of $170,117, representing guarantees
given by the holding company to the
Rural Bank of N.S.W. to secure the
return of loans jmade to necessitous
dairyfarmers from funds made avail-
able by the State Government.
The company relies little on out-
side long-term finance (less than slm.),
but bank overdraft was almost doubled
to $ 1.59 m. at April 30, 1966, indicative
of the difficult conditions operating.
The purchase of Barrett’s bottled
milk and ice-cream factory at Orange
involved the issue of 209,524 50c
ordinary shares at a useful premium of
55c a share. This added $115,238 to
share premium reserve.
Significant increases in stocks from
$1.56m. to $1.97m., and in debtors
from $2.28m. to $2.76m., no doubt
reflect this purchase, as group trading
has otherwise been adverse.
Acquisition of the 50 percent share-
holding in Tallowmasters Pty. not
already held by Consolidated, and the
subsequent sale of the assets of the
business to Pridham Holdings, explains
the $52,095 capital profit in 1966
accounts.
With weather conditions as they are
in N.S.W., no great improvement can
be expected in 1966-67 profits. The
present historically low share price still
does not offer sufficient in income yield
to attract buying support, particularly
as the margin of earnings over the
generous dividend is almost nil.

MINING
Oil and the Offshore West
UNTIL recently the sparsely popu-
lated north-western corner of the
Australian continent has been
overlooked by most Australians. Now,
to the delight of the Western Aus-
tralian Government, recent develop-
ments of national importance, such as
the Ord River scheme, the discovery
and development for export of the huge
Pilbara iron ore deposits, and the
declaration of Barrow Island as a com-
mercial oilfield have put this forgotten
area well and truly on the map.
Judging by the enthusiasm of oil
exploration companies on the prospects
of the north-west continental shelf area
it seems that, in future, interest in this
part of Australia will be stimulated
even further.
The north-west continental shelf
widens to some 150 .miles or more by
comparison with the relatively narrow
continental shelf off the Victorian coast
—the scene of the recent Esso-BHP dis-
coveries. So far, offshore drilling tech-
niques have only permitted the drilling
of the continental shelf areas of the
world which, on average, extend to
depths of around 100 fathoms (600
feet). The exploitation of deeper off-
shore areas will depend on the discovery
of new techniques.
However, the Petroleum Information
Bureau, in its latest quarterly gazette,
forecasts that the continental shelf areas,
which already account for some 15
percent of Free World production, may
contain about 25 percent of available
petroleum in the world. The PIB also
points out that there are indications that
the average petroleum content of off-
shore areas may be greater than land,
because continental shelves contain a
high proportion of recent sediments
which are generally mope prolific for
oil accumulation than older rocks.
Already one commercial oilfield has
been discovered in the southern corner
of this north-west shelf, at Barrow
Island, by West Australian Petroleum
Pty. Ltd. (Wapet), in which the listed
company Ampol Exploration Ltd. has
a one-seventh interest. Wapet holds
most of the coastal offshore areas in this
northern half of Western Australia, as
well as others stretching almost to
Albany in the south.
Far from devoting all its efforts to
bringing Barrow Island into production
on schedule by next May, Wapet is
intensifying its offshore exploration
with a drilling program on other
islands in the vicinity. Drilling is about
to commence on the first island in this
program, Long Island, off the coast
from Onslow and some 60 to 70 miles
south west of Barrow Island.
Two other listed companies with
large-scale interests in the north-west
shelf area are Woodside (Lakes En-
trance) Oil Company N.L. and Mid-
Eastern Oil N.L.
Woodside has a 25 percent interest
and Mid-Eastern an 8 l-3rd percent
interest in some 134,000 square miles of
offshore areas, in partnership with
8.0. C. of Australia (representing
Burmah Oil Company of England) and
Shell Development (Australia) Pty.
Ltd., which each hold 33 l-3rd per-
cent interests in the areas. In the
largest of these areas, P.E. 213 H, cov-
ering nearly 104,000 square miles from
just north of the Monte Bello Islands
to a point offshore from the coast about
halfway between Derby and Wyndham,
California Asiatic Oil Co. has elected
to acquire half of Shell’s interest under
a previous agreement.
All partners contribute to costs of
exploration according to their percen-
tage interests, although Woodside and
Mid-Eastern are being reimbursed for
expenditures prior to the signing of the
agreement in 1964 and are also to re-
ceive certain other benefits in the event
of commercial production.
In 1963 an extensive aeromagnetic
survey was completed over most of
these offshore areas by Woodside and
Mid-Eastern. Since then marine seismic
surveys have been carried out, being
initially concentrated in the southern-
most areas near Barrow Island before
proceeding northwards to areas off-
shore from Darwin. Several structures
have been located at various points
throughout the entire area and these
are currently being examined in more
detail.
PERHAPS even more significant is
market talk that the big buyer of
Woodside shares on the market in
recent months has been buying the
shares more because of Woodside’s 25
percent interest in the north-west areas
than for its better known Gippsland
holdings which adjoin the Esso-BHP
Gipsland shelf areas. The buyer is be-
lieved to be Canadian Superior Oil, of
Calgary, Canada.
Through its subsidiary Tasman Oil
Pty. Ltd., Canadian Superior holds
P.E. 235 H, covering 19,400 square
miles offshore from a point some 80
miles north of Geraldton almost to the
North West Cape. Its farmouts from the
Alliance Group cover two areas in the
Bonaparte Gulf area, O.P. 8 and P.E.
127 H, where the Alliance Bonaparte
No. 2 well (onshore) encountered a
non-commercial gas flow in 1964,
establishing the presence of hydro-
carbons in the area. Canadian Superior
and another overseas company, Rich-
field Oil Corporation, of Los Angeles
(through its subsidiary Anacapa Cor-
poration), both have'the right to earn
a 26 percent interest in these areas,
which total some 23,600 square miles,
mostly offshore, by expending over
$2 million during a period of four
years from 1965.
In May this year the Alliance Group
reported that seismic work in P.E.
127 H had confirmed the existence of
a number of large offshore structures.
A drilling program was expected to
follow as soon as suitable equipment
became available.

interests in the north-west offshore

Abrolhos Oil N.L., and Hawkeshore

Few details have been issued on
exploration activities in these offshore
holdings.
The progress of offshore exploration
in this North-West offshore area is
bound to stimulate immense interest,
particularly when the Woodside
partners commence drilling, possibly
next year. However, investors should
not be faint-hearted if early wells are
not successful. On the basis of world
experience, the odds of finding oil-
fields early in a drilling program are
rather long. Wapet has quoted the odds
for drilling a successful wildcat well
in a basin that has proven potential as
l-in-15 for finding an oilfield in the
5- to 10-million barrel reserve category,
1-in-50 for an oilfield with reserves of
25 million barrels, 1-in-225 for finding
an oilfield with reserves of 5Q to- 100
million barrels, and so on. Wapet itself
had to drill over 120 wells after the
disappointing Rough Range No. 1 well
before it discovered the Barrow Island
field, which has estimated reserves of
85 million barrels of oil.
COMMODITIES
Base Metal Uncertainties
A T one sta § e on the London Metal
Exchange last week it seemed as
, lf ; he bottom had fallen out of
the ™ arket for all . th( j mam metals
quoted copper, tin, lead, and zinc,
, . r j 5, i
Although not as dramatic as the plunge
in copper prices, the other three markets
all made moves toward levels that will
soon bring them into the spotlight,
All four made some recovery after
the setbacks, but lost ground on balance,
Copper markets will be uncertain in
coming months as prices adjust to the
new situation. Assuming that the
Rhodesian affair does not again inter-
rupt supplies, the outlook for copper
supplies is excellent over the medium
term. The Chilean labor situation has
calmed dramatically in the past six
?’ , .
Producers m several countries have
, . . . , , j , ,
ambitious expansion plans scheduled
f f
tor completion in the next few years.
Production is sure to more rapidl
than consumption has , even at its best
- n recen t years, if these plans are
fulfilled
Consumption, on the other hand, is
being hit not only by substitution but
by economic stagnation in the U.K., and
possibly elsewhere in the future. The
Vietnam war is taking an increasing
proportion of U.S. supplies, yet there
are signs that the supply position is
improving in America despite these
demands.
In the short term the position is un-
predictable. Some at least of recent
LME falls have reflected a wait-and-see
attitude by consumers.
Some “influential” selling by specu-
lators or consumers has also been evi-
dent.
The level of demand depends not
only on consumption trends but on
consumers’ stock levels and on the
view taken by consumers on the need
for stocks to meet possible supply
cuts. A more confident view among
fabricators could bring into the open
supplies not recorded in the standard
statistics of output and use.
the tin price, which
had not been below £stg.l2so be-
tween February last year and mid-
August this year, suddenly broke down-
ward, almost touching £l2OO at one
stage. The International Tin Council’s
buffer stock manager may buy metal at
the £l2OO level.
And the General Services Admini-
stration, controller of U.S. stockpile
sales, stopped selling last year when
£l2OO was reached in London.
The tin market faces a stiffer test
later this year, when supplies held
up by commissioning of the new Thai-
land smelter again begin to flow over-
seas.
The GSA’s reaction to price moves
will be important, because U.S. re-
leases will determine price levels
above the ITC’s support at least —for
some years.
Lead and zinc prices have also
weakened after a period of steadiness.
In coming months the outlook for these
two is probablv the bleakest of the four.
The £stglo2 producers’ price for
zinc is coming under increased pres-
sure.
Sugar in Doldrums
THE sugar market remains in the
doldrums. News that Venezuela
would offer to sell raw sugar on
the free market last week sent prices
below their previous post-war low of
£stg,l6 a ton.
Prices had already been weakening on
reports of a good European beet crop.
Unless an international agreement is
set up to limit production, producers’
only hope is that some of them will
either be forced to cut output unilater-
ally by low prices or that natural
disasters will achieve the same effect.
More talks on re-establishing the
quotas under the International Sugar
Agreement will be held in London
shortly. Apart from the usual difficulties
of negotiating such matters, the world’s
largest exporter, Cuba, has yet to show
any determination to join the nom
Communist ranks.

NEW LIFE FOR TEXTILES
Thriving days for synthetic fabrics
TWENTY years ago a synthetic tex-
tile processing industry hardly
existed in Australia. Now it is
the dominant and most thriving part
of the Australian textile trade. Its
growth is far from finished, as is also
the redevelopment and reorganisation
of local synthetic yarn manufacturing
to serve the textilers.
For the Tariff Board has established
clearly that it wants larger units in the
industry, warning of the dangers of
fragmentation and the need for ration-
alisation.
Taking the hint, two processors and
merchants with largely complementary
operations, STP Holdings Ltd. and
Tennyson Textile (Holding) Ltd., are
currently arranging a merger.
By combining, STP and Tennyson
will share technical know-how, achieve
economies of scale in production, in
marketing (their total sales will be
about $15.5m.), and in buying. Since
the combination becomes one of the
top four consumers of textile synthetics
for weaving, manufacturers’ enthusiasm
to supply the big new group could lead
to- pared prices.
Further moves in this industry could
be along the lines of closer links be-
tween companies like Bruck Mills, pro-
ducing fabrics from yarn, and companies
that process and merchandise it. Bruck
already has a small shareholding in
Tennyson, which prints all Bruck fab-
rics. Or there could be further associ-
ations between processors and fibre
producers, both at home and overseas,
as manufacturers attempt to ensure their
outlets by vertical integration along
British lines.
ICI and Courtaulds both have
indirect shareholdings in STP through
Carrington and Dewhurst and James
Nelson, of Tasmania, the third biggest
synthetics weaver after Bruck Mills and
Bradford Cotton’s Burlington Mills.
Toyo, Rayon, of Japan, has also
held a 15 percent interest in Tennyson
since 1962-63. Among the polyesters,
Tergal has the field in Europe, Tery-
lene in Britain, Dacron in America, so
that Australia appeared the only volume
market available to Toyo’s Tetron.
Tennyson buys base fabric for process-
ing from Toyo when commercially
equitable, thus obtaining better service,
increased supplier co-operation, and
special articles exclusive to Tennyson’s
purpose. It also gains benefit from
Japanese research.
As the three fibre makers will end
up with a stake in the new merged
company, no one of them will have
enough control to influence buying
policies.
Besides the STP-Tennyson group, the
only other firm with screen printing
machines in Australia is Colortex
Fabrics Pty., of East Bentleigh.
The larger the textile processing units
become, the more important it will
be for yarn producers to tie them or
take them over. The largest indepen-
dent commission dyer in Australia,
Bradford Dye Works Pty., of Rosebery
(N.S.W.), and users of synthetics like
Prestige-Holeproof and Osti clearly
have growing significance to yarn pro-
ducers.
J)ESPITE strong links with British
companies and the existence of
British-dominated and U.S.-owned syn-
thetic yarn plants in Australia, local
synthetic textile processors have been
looking substantially to Japan for their
raw materials. By importing large quan-
tities of Japanese “grey cloth” (woven
but not finished) and then processing
it into material dyed and printed to
suit local tastes, Australian processors
are protecting themselves from Japanese
competition in the finished product.
In May, 1965, STP took over a
large customer for its synthetic fashion
fabrics, Sekers Silk Pty. Sekers is the
leading specialist, creator, and distribu-
tor of fashion fabrics in Australia and
has a sizable export business (18 per-
cent of turnover) to New Zealand,
South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore,
West Germany, England, and Italy. It
had been sole distributor of STP’s
printed silks for some years.
Executives of Sekers travel overseas
each year, like most others in Aus-
tralian textiles and fashion, to learn
the fashion trends, the latest fabric
qualities, designs and colors. They then
commission leading textile designers
(there are 50 in the STP-Sekers com-
bine alone) to create designs to their
needs, for exclusive use by Sekers.
An Australian Fashion Fabric Design
Award for 100 percent terylene fabrics
had been sponsored for the past four
years by Tennyson, R. H. Taffs Pty.,
and the Contemporary Art Society, to
prove that paintings can be adapted
for textile reproduction, and that textile
designs do not have to be done by
commercial artists. The designs have
been printed by Tennyson and made

Ask an expert and he’ll tell you a heater in one location, no matter how good and how
expensive, won’t warm a whole house. Warm air must be distributed through ducts,
individually into each room, for even house heating.
This is just what Gilbarco Central Heating does. And at a reasonable cost. It’s oil-fired
and thermostatically controlled for economy and gives you warmed filtered air distributed
through outlets into every room of your house. In summer it converts to assist ventilation
throughout the house.
If you’ve decided on whole-house heating, get it. Go to Gilbarco!

u p by Taffs into garments which sell
vel y well in the $2O-25 retail price
range.
Buyers from the big department
stores buy designs in Paris from a
design studio, if they are scrupulous
(if not, they steal ideas from ready-
made materials, but this puts them six
months behind in fashion), and get the
local textilers to produce them, some-
times against firm orders. The leading
Australian garment makers, like
Sportscraft, Kenneth Pirrie, Norma
Tullo, get' exclusive fabrics not found
in piecegoods departments of the stores,
but the stores again benefit from the
time lag in manufacturing.
To the mere male it is hard to
envisage such a rapid change in fabric
styles. But since 1955 the line in fashion
has not changed drastically, so that the
accent is on color and fabric design.
Stores now have to project three or
four fashion stories each season, and
what catches on in Australia may be
entirely unrelated to overseas vogues.
The rages for hessian, cotton crepe,
small flowers on dark colors, and brown
corduroy were all purely Australian
fashions.
The Australian woman displays more
commonsense and independence in
fashions than the Londoner, New
Yorker, or Parisienne. Gimmicky
fashions are not for her. There is, too,
a distinctive Australian fashion style,
closer to Californian than anything
else.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Be Cautious with Pastorals
Elders G. M. best at the moment
OVER the past five weeks, five of
the pastoral finance companies
have been reviewed. There are a
number of other such companies; the
annual report of Elder Smith lists all
the selling brokers and the number of
bales of wool that each received into
their stores during the selling season. An
examination of the list shows that the
companies covered by this series of
articles received the following percent-
ages of the total during the last two
seasons for which the information is
available.
Company 1963/4 1964/5
Dalgety and N.Z. Loan 21 60 21 11
Elder Smith G.M. 27 10 26 68
Pitt, Son 8t Badgery 3 41 3 47
Winchcombe, Carson 7 50 7.48
Younghusband (including Portland
Woolbrokers) 3.53 3.69
63.14 62.43
Other companies which might have
been included, i.e., those whose ordin-
ary shares are listed on the Australian
Stock Exchanges, are:
Australian Estates 3 96 3 99
Aust. Merc. Land & Finance 7 53 7 41
Bennett & Fisher 1 75 1.74
Dennys Lasceiles 2 54 2 49
Roberts Stewart & Co. 0 78 0 95
A. G. Webster & Woolgrowers 0 83 1 01
17.39 17.59
The first two are U.K.-based com-
panies and the shares are hardly traded
in Australia. The others are quite small
and the four together account for only
6 percent of the total wool received
into store.
These figures indicate very clearly
the extent to which Elders and Dalgetys
dominate the industry, and there is no
likelihood that any combination of the
others could achieve the coverage of
either of the two leaders. But a merger
between Winchcombe, Carson and Pitt,
Son & Badgery would give the com-
bination the leading position in New
South Wales, which produces more
wool than any of the other States:
Percentages of
total.
1963/4 1964/5
New South Wales 32.24 31 21
Victoria 29.12 29.38
Queensland 16.75 16,35
South Australia 11.37 11.31
Western Australia 8 71 9 58
Tasmania 1 81 2.17
New South Wales also has the
largest cattle population, after Queens-
land, as well as having the largest sheep
population and the largest pig popula-
tion. It would then seem to be the main
State for the pastoral finance companies
yet, although Dalgety has the largest
share of the wool with about. 22 per-
cent, Elders and Farmers & Graziers
both have 20 percent, followed by
Winchcombe with 16 percent, and Pitt,
Son & Badgery and the AML & F with
11 percent. By way of contrast, Elder
has 62 percent of the South
Australian market and about 55 percent
of the Western Australian market.
However, as has already been pointed
out in the case of Elder Smith, revenue
from the sale of wool on commission
does not seem to be the major source
of revenue any longer, and this would
also apply to Dalgety and probably
others. Unfortunately, a reasonable
assessment can only be made in Elder
Smith’s case because it is the only
company which gives a breakdown of
sales and also shows a figure for in-
come from trading before deducting
expenses. So far as can be judged,
commissions from the sale of wool have
averaged just over 11 percent of in-
come from trading over the last three
years and commission from livestock
sales about 13 percent. However, one
would judge that the prosperity of the
man on the land and his propensity to
purchase “merchandise” would have
some considerable bearing on the profits
of the pastoral finance companies. Un-
fortunately, again, there is no evidence
over the short period where worth!
while information on Elder Smith’s
sales is available, of any correlation
between the value of rural products sold
and the value of rural merchandise
sold.
The following items expressed as a
percentage of income from trading show
recent trends in sales and major ex-
pense items:—
1962/3 1963/4 1964/5
Wool and livestock
commission (estimated) 23 8 26 8 23 4
Other income 76.2 73.2 76.6
Staff costs (including long
service and annual leave
provisions) 38 4 35 3 35 6
Other expenses 32 5 29 0 27.9
The benefits of the Elder merger
would seem to be a saving of $1 mil-
lion in expenses while increasing total
revenue by $2.75 million. This increase
of $3.75 million accounts for the in-
crease in the pre-share earnings from
15.7 cents to 25.8 cents. However, it
seems unlikely that any further benefits
will be obtained from costs savings and
future improvements in per share
earnings will come from increases in
revenue.
The conclusion would be that, un-
less the companies can find some way,
to reduce their “staff costs” or to;
boost their sales from outside the rural
industry, the most that could be ex-
pected by way of “growth” would be,
about | of one percent per annum
above the growth of the economy as
a whole.
Currently, the shares of the five
companies are being priced as follows
by the market:
Div. Earn-
Last per Earnings Div. ings
sale share per share yield yield
Company $ cents 1965-1966 % %(a)
Elder Smith 245 10 0 27.6 4.1 11.2 >

N.Z.L. 5.10 30.0 46.9 5.9 9.2
Young-
husband 0.85 5 0 7.6 6 7 5.9 8.9
(a) Based on 1965 earnings per share.
On the basis of Younghusband’s 1966
earnings per share, the earnings yield
is 7.9 percent. If we assume that
the market is placing a value on pas-
toral companies’ shares to give an
earnings yield of, say, 8 percent, then
the following decreases in the 1965/6
earning rates are expected:
Elder Smith 29%
Winchcombe, Carson 25%
Dalgety & N.Z.L. 13%
Clearly, we cannot make any worth-
while assessment of the likely decline
in earning rates this year on the in-
formation which we have available; it
would be hard to believe that the de-
cline would exceed 20 percent in any
of these companies. From Elder
Smith’s figures, a fall of 20 percentjn
sales of wool or sales of livestock would
produce a fall of about 10 percent in
earnings per share. Elder Smith’s
low dividend relative to earnings prob-
ably is responsible for its pricing, and


it is worth noting that if Elder Smith paid out the same
proportion of earnings as the other companies the dividend
would be 17 cents per share, bringing the dividend yield
on the current price to about 7 percent.
For the long-term investor, Elder Smith looks like the
best value at the moment. The smaller companies, which
have a fluctuating history of dividends per share, seem
to be priced about correctly at the moment. Speculators
should be fairly cautious, however, because a break in the
drought may cause . a further reduction in earnings as
livestock sales decline with re-stocking.
THE CHARTIST SAYS
Watch for the Cycles
THE pastoral group of stocks should be regarded by
investors as strictly cyclical and their performance
since 1960 can be directly compared with the pastoral
index, which has formed a substantial base pattern. Elder
Smith Goldsbrough Mort seems to show the best prospects
of further capital growth at this particular point and
Winchcombe, Carson possibly the most promising recovery
situation, although minor fluctuations can be expected
below the 98c level in the short term.
A growth key has been included with the charts and
the rate of appreciation or depreciation per annum can be
measured in relation to the performance of the individual
stocks and the index. With the exception of Pitt, Son &
Badgery Ltd. and possibly Dalgety & N.Z. Loan, the pas-
toral stocks reviewed now appear to have based; investors
could expect a gradual improvement which must also be
related to the general market tone.
DALGETY & N.Z. LOAN. —The value of trend lines is
illustrated in this particular chart, where a decisive break
in an upward trend, which had continued for nearly two
years at a rate of 40 percent, gave a clear selling signal
about the $6.80 level. The stock followed a downward
movement until the low point of $4.52 was recorded in
November, 1965. It would appear that this stock is most
probably forming a base above the $4.60 level, but the
consolidation to date suggests that the stock could continue
in a general sideways movement for some time. However,
the situation would call for reassessment should prices fall
below the support level at $4.50. The present time is a
critical one for this stock.
ELDER SMITH GOLDSBROUGH MORT “topped”
earlier than Dalgety after an upward trend of nearly two
years duration at a rate of 40 percent per annum. The 1964
congestion area suggested a fall to approximately the $2.00
level and an actual low point of $1.97 was recorded in
June, 1965. The downtrend has now been penetrated and
the base consolidation formed to date suggests a rise to
approximately $3.30; investors could expect considerable
resistance about the $2.80 level from the range of trading
which took place in 1964. No uptrend has yet been con-
firmed, but the situation appears promising although a
minor reaction back toward a tentative trend line might
be expected over the next few weeks. This stock could be
classed as a general wide-swinging cyclical situation, but
with some growth prospects.
PITT, SON & BADGERY LTD. —The long-term trend
on this chart reveals an unimpressive performance since
1960, and at present the stock is still in a major downtrend
which has been evident since 1964. The overall picture
suggests more recessive tendencies and there is a lack of
support levels back to 1960. The stock has fallen to a
low point of $l.BB earlier this year and there is an absence
of any distinct base pattern up to the present time. The
possibility of a further decline cannot be discounted and
there would certainly be no technical reasons to buy this
stock at present.
WINCHCOMBE, CARSON LTD.— lnvestors who bought
into this stock in 1960, particularly near the top price of
$2.08, must be disappointed with the overall performance.
Although a 25 percent intermediate uptrend was followed
from late 1962 until the top formation in 1964, a selling
signal was clearly indicated about the $1.40 level. The
sharp downward trend which followed took the stock to a
low point of 72c early this year and achieved the major
downside objective from the 1964 top formation. The
present picture suggests a head-and-shoulders base reversal
pattern which could eventually take prices back to approxi-
mately the $1.40 level and possibly beyond. This stock
is technically very promising as a recovery situation.
YQUNGHUSBAND LIMITED. Although the long-
term trend does not show any real appreciation, investors
holding this stock since 1960 would not have suffered the
same degree of capital loss as some of the other pastoral
stocks. The top formation in 1964 was preceded by a
gentle uptrend to a high of $1.15 and a sharp decline
followed to a low point of 68c in February, 1966. This
stock could possibly offer some appreciation, but a con-
firmed trend is not evident at this stage. However, if
prices move above the 90c level in the near future, a
substantial rise to approximately $1.30 would be a distinct
possibility.

AUSTRALIAN POST OFFICE
MAN ON THE LAND
Two Pockets of Depression
Australia is indeed a lucky
country in that a peasant farm-
ing com,munity has never been
permitted to develop. The share-
cropper, the poor white, and the im-
poverished tenant have never been
part of the Australian tradition. True,
there was the battling cocky, but
many who were cockies are now
wealthy men. The transition has taken
place in their own lifetime, for which
they can thank, largely, the Country
Party and Mr. McEwan. It is also
true that there have been, and still
are, certain depressed segments of
primary industry. There have been
and still are, some poor farmers. But
never have they been so poor, and so
downtrodden, that all opportunity has
been denied them.
There has been suffering, certainly,
as there has been suffering in urban
communities, but never has there been
a depressed rural community quite
separate from the mainstream of Aus-
tralian life. New Zealand, probably,
is the only other country where this
circumstance has prevailed.
The peasant problem is very real to-
day in all the underdeveloped and de-
veloping nations of Africa, Asia, and
Latin America. It still exists to some
extent in the socialist countries of
Europe and in Italy and Spain. France,
Britain, and the Scandinavian coun-
tries have corrected it, but only after
200 years of turmoil and strife.
The United States, from the depres-
sion years onwards, has had the
problem of coping with displaced, and
often unemployable, rural workers and
smallholders. The problem is far from
solved. A good proportion of the par-
ticipants, both white and colored, in
the race riots are people who have
flooded into the cities from rural areas
where their labor is no longer required,
They have neither the skills nor the
training to fit readily into the Great
Society.
While there is simply no close simi-
larity, fortunately, there are, never-
theless, two particular segments of
primary industry in Australia which
today exhibit symptoms of depres-,
sion. These are dairying and horticul-
ture. Consolidation, a word which is
perhaps euphemistic, is the corrective
measure being called for.
W E refer, particularly, to the recent
advice of the N.S.W. Milk Board
chairman, Mr. J. A. Ferguson, that
small, uneconomic farms should be
amalgamated into commercial units,
with farmers wanting to leqve the in-
dustry being pensioned off. He is not
the only person to advocate this, of
course.
However, Mr. Ferguson has come up
with a fairly detailed outline of how it
could be done, and it is pertinent and
encouraging at this particular time,
The margarine controversy has resulted
in the opinion being voiced in some
circles that “there are no brains in
the dairying industry.” We have never
gone along with that particular
opinion. As we see it, margarine is
the lesser of the two big problems
facing Australian dairying. The Euro-
pean Common Market and the virtual
certainty that Europe will become self-
sufficient in dairy products (whether
Britain goes in or not) is by far the
bigger threat.
The attractive part of Mr. Ferguson’s
suggestion is that any consolidation
should be voluntary. This also is part
of the existing United Kingdom scheme
which Mr. Ferguson observed following
the world dairy congress in Munich

The Rhine Riesling grapes used for Yalumba White Table
Wines are picked when the degree of sugar and acid are
in balance (12° beaume and 8% acid). Immediately after
gently crushing through a special roller mill to avoid
stalkiness the juice is completely separated from the
skins, seeds and stems. This reduces astringency and con-
tributes to the delicacy of the wine. Fermentation is care-
fully controlled at regulated low temperatures. The wine
is then carefully prepared for very early bottling to avoid
excessive exposure to air, in order to maintain its crisp
freshness and full Rhine Riesling bouquet.

TABLE WINES
Famous since 1849
Vintaged by S. SMITH & SON PTY. LTD., Angaston, S.A.
earlier this year. The British white
paper on dairying (1965) says: “No
one could be compelled to take this
course (consolidation), but many could
profit from it. Anyone could continue
living in poverty if he wants to.”
Mr. Ferguson said he believed this
approach was the overall political
answer to the problem of small, un-
economic farms and could be arranged
using “commonsense on both sides.”
Through consolidation, and pensioning
off, farmers who remain would become
more competitive and would lessen their
dependence upon Government sub-
sidies.
A farmer, if he elected to retire from
the industry, would receive a lump
sum of $1250 plus $37.50 an acre for
farmers up to 55 years of age or an
annuity for life of $250 plus $2.50 an
acre a year if over 65. A choice
between a lump sum or an annuity
could be provided for farmers between
55 and 65. This would permit them to
either make a fresh start somewhere
else or retire from farming altogether.
WHAT would such a plan cost? This
can be ascertained in general terms
from the U.K. figures. The dairy herds
in both countries are about the same
-—three million head. The British
expenditure on the scheme is expected
to be between $37.5 million and $42.5
million a year. It sounds a lot of money,
but if, as anticipated, it does result
in remaining farmers being less de-
pendent on subsidy, then it could end
up .being good business.
While, in Australia, the pockets of
depression are evident in dairying, the
position is probably worse, or will be,
in horticulture (particularly dried
fruits, which are almost entirely depen-
dent on overseas markets). The recent
world sultana conference in Melbourne
ended on a very unhappy note, with
the United States delegation refusing
to be a party to minimum price levels.
A consolidation plan for fruitgrowers
may be more urgent than it is for
dairy farmers. Dairying has the advan-
tage in that it has been organised longer
than any other farm group.
The future for dairying, as indeed
for all farming in Australia, seems tied
up with industrial growth generally and
larger farm units. There comes a point
where the individual proprietor gives
way to the corporation, which operates
perhaps dozens of farms and pays wages
(and conditions) similar to those apply-
ing in industry generally.
The objection to this trend, in
specific terms, is that the corporations
are well able to afford to do the con-
solidating, but all too often the tax-
payer has to foot the bill. And the
objection, in general terms, is that
while voluntary consolidation can be
logical and feasible it may not be the
best way for 10 million people to re-
tain possession of the Australian con-
tinent.
Neither of these objections will pre-
vent consolidation happening.

AGRISEARCH
Pasture Losses from Treading
WHEREAS an elephant’s foot
exerts a pressure of about 101 b.
per square inch, a cow’s foot
exerts up to 181 b. and a sheep’s up to
121 b. In walking while grazing, cows
and sheep, therefore, do more damage
to pasture than elephants. A visiting
New Zealand scientist mentioned this
at a meeting of agrostologists in Can-
berra. He was warning them that they
may need to take into their reckoning
pasture losses caused by treading. Aus-
tralians, with their relatively extensive
grazing systems, have never worried
very much about this possibility. How-
ever, the matter will become increas-
ingly important as our trend to adopt
higher stocking rates continues.
The visitor,' Dr. Edmond, said that
New Zealanders calculated that tread-
ing can reduce the yield of pastures by
over 30 percent. The best dairy farms
in his country, he said, carried between
1 to 1 j milking cows per acre. Theoreti-
cally, they should be carrying the
equivalent of 3 to 4 milking cows per
acre per annum,
At Palmerston it was learned that
Romney sheep on good pasture walk
approximately two miles a day in the
course of filling their bellies. With this
information an experiment could be de-
vised to measure the effect that normal
walking has on pasture. From the re-
suits, the figure mentioned above was
calculated. It was also concluded that
rye grass and white clover are harmed
less by treading than several other
pasture species and that damage is
worst when the soil is wet.

Co/veS M the Open
SOLITARY confinement out of doors
is good for calves. They thrive
better and deaths are rare because
the calfhood diseases, white scours,
pneumonia, ringworm, and internal
parasites, are avoided. This, at any rate,
is Mr. L. P. Prewett’s conclusion. He is
a veterinary officer of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, who has
been rearing, most successfully, large
numbers of calves on the State Research
Farm at Werribee.
This farm is located near Melbourne
on an exposed plain where the weather
can be very bleak at times. Even so,
provided the calves are well fed, they
thrive and none die under these con-
ditions.
In practice, two systems have been
used at Werribee to prevent the spread
of disease. In one, the calves are
tethered in a paddock from birth to
weaning. For the first few weeks they
are moved to a fresh spot every second
day, but thereafter are moved daily.
Under the second system tethering is
continued only until the calves are three
weeks old, when they are given free
run of the paddock. However, the feed-
ing bails are spaced so that a calf
cannot reach into its neighbor’s pail.
This stops an infected calf spreading its
disease by contaminating the feed of
others.
Though the tethering, moving, and
individual feeding in portable bails
make extra work, time does not have
to be spent cleaning and maintaining
Dens and sheds. That other serious
disease of bobby calves, coccidiosis, does
not occur on the State Research Farm,
and so Mr. Prewett cannot say whether
his methods would combat it. Infectious
diseases are mainly a problem where
large numbers of calves are reared. His
precautions, based on isolation outdoors,
might not be worth while pursuing by
the farmer with a small herd.

SPECULATORS DIARY
A Start to the Meetings
And the pertinence of copper
HERE we are again at the start of the annual meeting season. And what
better introduction to the season than the Intrade meeting. The change in
fortunes of this company is best illustrated by the comparison between the
number of shareholders attending the 1965 annual meeting and those attending the
1968 meeting. From a paltry four it soared to just under 70.
What made the prospect of this meet-
ing so interesting was the desperate
fight that had gone on before it between
the board of directors headed by chair-
man Finn and the faction headed by
the former managing director, Dr.
Krupicka.
Shareholders had been bombarded
with correspondence from both sides.
The argument put forward by the
existing directors was that trading
should be terminated so that at least
shareholders would have cash assets
equivalent to 15 cents for every 50-
cent share. On the other side, Dr.
Krupicka and his merry men were all
for carrying on operations.
By the time the meeting arrived it
was, as put by one of Krupicka’s men,
“all over bar the shouting.” So into a
company with net assets of $60,000
stepped the Krupicka group. Came the
time for questions at the meeting and
someone politely asked how the present
board was to make up the deficit of
$130,000 between the current assets
and liabilities. An unfair question ap-
parently, for although they had spent
months campaigning to gain control
they claimed they’d only been a con-
stituted board for a few minutes.
On swept the meeting to the
appointment of auditors. One of the
Krupicka group supporters in the audi-
ence was all for the removal of the
present auditors. When it was estab-
lished that no other auditors had given
notice of standing for election, the new
board suggested to the meeting that
the appointment of auditors be left
to the board at a later date. No wonder
someone asked just who did the audi-
tors represent. The end result was that
the existing auditors were retained.
All in all, not a company in which
I would consider holding shares.
But back to a subject more pertinent
to the portfolio copper, and more
particularly Mt. Isa. Even making
allowance for the decline in the world
price of copper, the severe fall in price
of this stock has shocked me. There
has been some talk of a strike being
initiated by the AEU. However, one
benefit arising from the last strike is
that the AWU, which has control of
the bulk of the employees, is now fully
conscious of this danger. So this time,
if it comes to a showdown, the AWUi s
in a position to prevent it.
Perhaps the real nigger in the wood,
pile is the heavy fall in the world
copper price and, more particularly,.the
fear that the price may continue to
slide. Yet, while there might be some
slackening in demand by industry, i n .
creased U.S. military requirements
should fill the gap.
This all probably sounds as if I’m
going to buy Mt. Isa. Instead, I
plumped for 200 more Peko Wallsend
at $2.22. Knocked down because of
the fall in the world price of copper,
the shares should show a good reaction
when the company is put into its
proper perspective of gold producer.
A MUCH bigger fall in the last week
has’ been Planet. From a price of
50 cents, the shares plummeted to 40
cents on the announcement of the for-
mation of two separate companies to
look after the mineral interests. Con-
sidering that there has been no basic
change, it’s a pretty harsh reassessment
of the shares. Remember also Planet’s
10 percent interest in the offshore
leases next to BHP. I purchased 1000
shares at 40 cents.
The one sale for the week was the
1000 Westralian at 55 cents. These
shares had been in the portfolio for
six months an unusually long stay,
but certainly justified in view of the
profit of $lBO.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
1000 Westralian 55c $538
BOUGHT
200 Peko Wallsend $2.22 $455
1000 Planet 40c $4OB
At the end of the week the debit
balance had risen to $573.

Here you see, with Don Lane, Mr. H. Gorer,
the Managing Director of International
Majora. Mr. Gorer is very “with it.” He well
knows the value of merchandising through Don
Lane. There are thousands of do-it-yourself,
home handymen in the vast “Tonight Show”
audience of 401,000 different, but devoted
viewers. And they’re all good customers. Mr.
Gorer knows that Don Lane can shift as much
paint as a fleet of pantechnicons, and naturally
this is okay with the paint dealers, too. So
everybody is made happy, all round. Turn on
the fast and furious fun this week . . . there’s
a hot time in the old town every Tuesday and
