LITERARY NOTES.
A Book of Lovely Lubras.
The latest compliment reaches this locality
with rather a left-handed swing :
. . . The Sydney Bulletin holds the prouc
sway over all Australian print-productions. I
not only reaches the combos and stockmen o
Central Australia, but it reaches lepers on isolatec
islands, lighthouse-keepers that are difficult to
approach, and wild aboriginals have used its rec
cover as the salient point of their costume.
The unapproachable lighthouse-keeper may
pass ; but is it exactly as a leader of leper
opinion, a costumier of wild aboriginals, tha
one would wish to pose ?
* * * *
Mr. Willshire means well, of course. He
is one of the men who know and can’t write
and his booklet, ‘ ‘ The Land of the Dawn
ing ” (W. K. Thomas, Adelaide), collects
under a hackneyed title an aggravating
miscellany of personal narrative, crude
humor, and valuable observations regarding
Northern Territory aborigines—among whom
Mr. Willshire has been policeman, mission
ary, civiliser, king and god for many years
His domain covered the country neighboring
the Katharine, Daly, Gregory, Roper, anc
Victoria rivers; his subjects were cannibals o:
the Australian stone age ; his power was
all but absolute. His duty took him into
many regions untrodden by a white man
among many tribes who had never dreamt o
a white man’s existence ; he saw sights beau
tiful, awful, gorgeous, grotesque, curious
amazing, incredible ; lie mixed familiarly
with strange men, and learnt many strange
things ; and all that he brings back from his
perilous Voyages in the wilderness is a col-
lection of half-articulated tags, and scraps,
and vague hints, of the knowledge seething
within him. He has no voice. Really, it
would pay a literary syndicate to float “ The
Willshire Exploitation Company,” mine for
his ore, and smelt him into jo den speech.
* * * *
The most noticeable thing in Mr. Will-
shire’s book is his warm appreciation of oiu
charming country women of Way-Up. He
positively teems with lovely lubms :
A little blue in off in tin' full bloom of e;irly
loveliness, witli a stalk of red lilies in her banc
(p. 17).
Oro-ginnia Was eighteen, the image of health
and beauty (p. 27).
Poor girl, after marrying Mopie-mopie
she ran away with somebody else, and hit
Mopie-mopie with a yam stick when he came
to recover her. Her end was falling down a
cataract —per Mopie-mopie.
One, who was about eighteen [“ l’&ge critique”
—pour M. Willshire?] the picture of black
beauty and health, was called Billa-bil-100, which
means the king parrot. The other sister, whose
age was about sixteen, was an unblushing bronze,
and naturally timid. She was called Warren-no-
allv, or in English “The maid of the gully.” She
was of good phy-iquo and remarkable beauty
(p. 33;.
■But from between the rocks came a strap-
ping young girl, with the agility of a moun-
tain creature. She jumped from rock to rock,
straight to the grey horse I was silting upon
[natural magnetism, no doubt I], took hold of my
stirrup-iron, and ran alongside until we were out
of danger. She was arrayed in her native modesty,
and I may state this was the prettiest black girl I
ever saw (p. 41).
We ascertained from her that her name was
Puu-garra, which, in the native language, means
a kiss. . . Every line in the contour of her
person was the perfection of feminine beauty.
She moved with a grace beyond all power of re-
production. She had the bust of a Juno, and
hands that would delight a sculptor (p. 42).
The first thing we observed was a beautiful
■ savage maiden, who in her startled movements
was as graceful as a stag (p. 47).
She was a superlatively beautiful girl, with
abnormally beautiful proportions (p. 57).
Out from their flower-festooned alcoves came
the brilliant bevy of blushing maidens, all
timorous and coy (p. 61).
Hundreds of black virgins all nude and in the
full tide of youthful enjoyment, but like chartered
libertines in their conversation, and with languor
like harem denizens (p. 71).
&c., &c., &.— ad. lib.
Let us go to the Northern Territory !
* * * *
And all this time we have been taught by
Brunton Stephens and other poetic truth-
perverters, and by association with the de-
graded tribes of the coast, that the aboriginal
lady was a shapeless creature with a splay
mouth and a soul that never rose above
’bacca ! Let us go to the Northern Terri-
tory, where Mr. Willshire guarantees “to
track and round up now and again,” for the
edification of peripatetic literary persons, ‘ 4 a
bevy of smockless black girls, as sweet in
heart as the morning dew.”
* * * *
There is a legend that the white leader of
black trackers who capture lovely booty is
accorded a certain right which the good old
feudal seigniors claimed at the marriages of
their vassals—but Mr. Willshire says nothing
of this. His attitude is always that of a man
—and a brother. He even recites (on p. 30)
the story of his temptation and triumph when
“breezy gins ” danced round him a seductive
nautch which “about reached its apogee
when each of them had to touch my nose
with her big toe.” Willshire sat quiet and
blushed ; and when one old nigger muttered
something like “ladies’ choice,” and a
“ young woman with a mass of greasy and
tangled curls came and made overtures to
me, whilst the others began romping away up
and down the corroboree ground, I declined
with thanks, and bowed most courteously;
she, with equal politeness, returned the
courtesy.” Mem.—Pungarra, “the Kiss,”
didn’t have greasy and tangled curls.
* * * *
Mr. Wiltshire's conclusion of the whole
matter is noticeable :
Men would not remain so many years in a
country like this if there were no women, and
.... the Almighty .... has placed
them wherever the pioneers go.
What a potentiality of utile cum, dulce lurks in
the human intellect’s neat teleological twist t
* » * *
Away from the lubras Mr. Willshire gives
information only less interesting. He con-
demns black men, white missionaries, and
miscellaneous half-castes. He exalts black
women, some white men, and N.T. scenery.
He gives aboriginal vocabularies, drawings,
and one mysterious inscription. And his
pages are full of ethnological interest, often
excited, but rarely satisfied even as fully as
in this note on “tracking ” :
My native troopers are splendid trackers—never
fail over stones, through spinifex, over high ranges,
through gorges and long grass. If they lose the
tracks for a few minutes their instinct tells-.them
the direction, and on they go. If the travelling is
anything like good, they will jog along on horse
or camel at five miles per hour, appearing not to
be looking down at the tracks ; but still they have
them all the while. A bit of wild f rui t picked off a
tree, a grub taken from the bark of a tree, a
branch broken, a stone turned over, a little
bit of ash from a firestick, a dog’s track, all is
noticed, all is seen, and still we jog along four or
five miles an hour. If the offenders, who know
we are on their tracks, turn and walk backwards,
as they have done in my time, we know it is all
“monkey gammon,’’ they cannot fool the trackers.
Charlotte Waters and the Finke River produce
the most expert trackers the world ever saw. They
begin tracking lizards and snakes, &c., &c., from
their infancy and for their daily sustenance ;
without the wonderful faculty they would
go very hungry. I have noticed little
children who have been asleep in the
wurley, their mothers in the meantime having
walked down to the creek to have a bathe. The
child wakes up and finds its mother gone; it
starts to cry, and all the time walking round the
camp trying to pick up its mother’s track. At
last the child discovers it amongst many others,
and off it runs on the track right to its mother,
who may be half a mile away.
* * * *
It does not need the appendix of testi-
monials to show that Mr. Willshire is a fine,
manly fellow and a capable police officer.
Items.
The chief merit of Louis Becke’s style is its
simplicity ; when he starts to embroider it he
generally loses himself. Here, for example,
is the word -picture which commences “ Lup-
tpn’s Guest ” in his new book (take a long
breath 1) :
A long sweeping curve of coast, fringed
with tall plumed palms casting waving shadows
on the yellow sand as they sway and swish
softly to the breath of the brave trade-wind
that whistles through the thickly - verdured
hummocks on the weather side of the island,
to die away into a soft breath as, after pass-
ing through the belt of cocoanuts, it faintly
ripples the transparent depths of the lagoon—a
broad sheet of blue and silver stretching away
from the far distant western line of reef to the
smooth, yellow beach at the foot of the palms on
the easternmost islet.
Ah-h-h 1 It is lucky this concatenation o
pronouns is unique.
* • • *
In a clever pap. r m the New Review, ex-South
Sea Prime Minister Basil Thomson tells the
curious story of the balolo The balolo is a worm
—living vermicelli, as it were—with no head but
a mouth, and no body but a transparent pipe,
who lives his life deep in the fissures of the coral
reefs, rising twice a year to the upper waters only
to die phoenix-like in the propagation of his kind.
But —here is the curiosity—the balolo is a natural
almanac ; he has a fixed day for his appearance,
and he will not turn therefrom for all the hurri-
canes that ever raged south of the Line. In the
mere observance of seasons and fixed intervals
there would be no greater miracle than our own
bodies can show. The wonder lies in the fact
that the balolo keeps both lunar and solar time,
reconcilingand'adjusting them at regular intervals.
The balolo swarms to the surface on two nights in
the year : the nights of the third quarter of the
moon in October and in November ; and has never
departed from the time during the forty-eight
years it has been watched by Europeans. The
moon directs its choice of the day, the sun its
choice of the month ; and it follows that the
creature cannot maintain regular intervals of
either twelve or thirteen lunations without chang-
ing the calendar month of its re-appearance. For
two years it rises after a lapse of twelve lunations ;
every third year at the thirteenth. But, since
even this arrangemeet will gradually sunder solar
and lunar time, it further intercalates a lunation
once in the twenty-eight years. What are the
immediate impulses, of tide or of season, that
move it to rise on its appointed day, and keep it
back every three and every twenty-eight years,
no theorist has yet essayed to show.
One of the rarest of Australian books is “ The
Life of Emily Duncan ; an Autobiography, with
an Introduction by Robert Coles.” Sydney,
N.S.W., 1878. This is one of the few “objection-
able” productions of the Australian press.
The earliest Australian reprint of an English
book seems to have been “The Posthumous
Papers of the Pickwick Club. With Illustrations
after Phiz. Launceston, Y.D.L., 1838.” The
publisher in his preface says : —“lt is believed
that this is the largest publication which has been
issued from the N.S.W. or the Tasmanian press.
. . . The illustrations will be found fully
equal to the original, and, as the work of a
colonial artist, will preserve to the reprint its
character of a purely colonial publication.”
Christina Rossetti’s posthumous book of poems
is a very flat collection. Every wise author’s
corpse would carry its unpublished MS. along
with it to the crematorium. There is nothing so
aggravating as the zeal of friendly editors to
include “absolutely all the pieces hitherto uncol-
lected ” —because the author knew they weren’t
worth collecting.
Conan Doyle has definitely fixed his level as
that of a storyteller who can while away an hour
or two agreeably, but from whom nothing beyond
the ephemeral must ever be expected. “The
Exploits of Brigadier Gerard ” read well in the
magazines, and they don’t read badly strung to-
gether in a book. Doyle has learnt something
from Weyman, one sees; but he can’t quite mimic
Weyirian’s spontaneity. And the insistence on
English and French national traits becomes mere
caricature.
J. J. M‘Cue’s “Australian Poultry Guide’’
(Geo. Robertson) is a good little manual, with
valuable illustrations.
The best service one can do Anarchist Andrews
Reason is to point out an error in its logic. As
not unusual with logical errors, the fallacy comes
from an intrusive ego : it is comparatively easy to
find flaws in the argument of the other fellow.
Says Reason :
We cannot pay for food, rent, paper, ink, postage, &c.,
•ut of the sum of 30s. per issue, which was about the
return upon our first number from the sales. We have
not received the support vve had every right to expect.
What right has Reason to expect support? Why
is the popular cash to be tethered to its ideals .
Reason has a right to the support it gets ; no
more and no less. When it rises up to declare
that somebody should support it who doesn’t
want to support it, it attempts to infringe on
somebody’s rights in its own interest —which is
bad sense and bad anarchy.
The M.L. Triad prints some ingenious inter-
pretations by local newspapers of the cablegram
that ticketh in darkness. The other day it was
cabled that “doctors are using Rontgen’s dis-
covery with astounding results. Gallstones,
stones in the bladder, and injuries to the bones
are easily seen.” The Wairarapa Daily Times
printed it: —
Doctors are using Rontgen’s discovery with astounding
results. Mr. Gladstone’s stones in the bladder and
injuries to the bones are easily seen.
And at the beginning of the year came a mys-
terious cable about Italy and Abyssinia. The
Wellington Post had it: —
Rome, Jan. Ist.
The Italians have kidnapped two princes who are
closely related to Menelek, ruler of Abyssinia, and who
were travelling in Italy for their education.
The Nelson Mail interpreted it .
Rome, Jan. Ist.
Italian agents in Abyssinia are reported to have success-
fully kidnapped King Menelek, the ruler of the country.
The Nelson Colonist put in it this way :
Rome, Jan. Ist.
Mr. Menlick, who is travelling Italy for eduo.tional
purposes, has disappeared, and it is reported that an
Italian agent has kidnapped him.
No apologies to Victor Daley are needed for
this extract from Tom Bracken’s Annual, «
pleasant M.L. visitor ;
Oh, the Ould Wife, the Ould Wife,

Her dhresser nate, and quite eomplaibe

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.’’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tam worth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who

under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Sr. c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

BEFORE. YOU
T. E A F ;
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
(xeorge-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round—
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise
enough to

THE STATION BRAND.
< ?/ y° u ln the boots and the long-necked spurs,
x ou ve a nice little hackney there,
rather fancy that brand of hers—
Now what will you take for the mare ?
xou need not go off on too wide a tack,
, t m hardly in want of a horse,
t m only pricing your chestnut hack
tor the sake of the brand, of course.
No thanks ; I don’t fancy exchanges,
Besides, she’s a bit of a screw
As old as the Barrier Ranges,
And shook in the shoulders, too !
Now, what is the use of denial?
Much better have let things stand—•
No, thank you, I want no trial:
I’m buying the Tringa brand !
I know that she’ll carry me fast and far
In waterless waste or wet,
For never the “ TRI and a Bar ”
Was burnt on a bad one yet.
Do I know the brand ? Yes, I think Ido ;
I’ve carried it, hell-fire hot,
To the stockyard fence and passed it through
For many a cleanskin lot;
I’ve heard it hiss on the burning hide
And the short, sharp whinny of pain
As they lifted it off to thrust aside
Or lay to the lines again.
Do I know the brand ? T have watched it streak
To the front in the mustering days—
But why do I tell you—you’ve heard it speak,
And you know what the old hand says !
Enquire of the drovers from North of Bourke,
The Kings of the Overland,
Which are the horses to stand the work :
They will tell you, “ The Tringa Brand ! ”
And question the mailmen in flood-stress met,
Flogging, down in the mud,
Which are the pearls when the plains are wet,
They will tell you, The Tringa Blood ! ”
And ask of the men of the Furthest Back
What their favorite campers are
In the whirling dust when the stockwhips crack ;
And it’s “ TRI and a Bar.”
You can have your price; it’s a lot too much
As horses are selling to-day ;
But a man is a fool and acts as such
When sentiment shows the way ;
But spavined and aged and shoulder-shook,
I'm not regretting the deal,
For the old brand shows like an open book
What nothing else can reveal—
The far-off life with its witching charms
And the glamour of sun and star
In the happy days when our coat-of-arms
Was “ TRI and a Bar.”
GLENROWAN.
THE ANSWERING STRIDE.
I bred him and trained him and rode him,
He had plenty of heart and could stay ;
But the pace of the others soon showed him
He would want all his talent that day.
I feared they would give him the slip—
A young one who’d scarcely been tried,
But I gave him a clip with the spurs and the whip
And he won with his answering stride.
A soft one with breed and condition
And a bit of a pull in the weight
May smother a weak opposition
And win by the length of the straight.
But when you’re on one that won’t flinch,
A bundle of heart in a hide,
Nothing gives you each inch when it comes to the
pinch
Like the spur and the answering stride.
Your whip may be pride or ambition,
Perhaps a craving for money your spur;
Love of kudos, or social position,
Or perhaps it may only be “ her.”
But if you can carry the weight,
And you don t know you cannot till tried,
Take each lick of hard fate and you’ll win soon or
late
If you’ve grit for the answering stride.
Maoriland.

“ Canard ” arose from a French journalist
telling a yarn about his 20 ducks. He killed one,
and the other 19 ate it. So, till only two ducks
remained, and one ate the other.
A Sydney reporter had his pocket picked
the other day—by two newsboys who were trying
to sell him his own paper ! The poor scribe lost a
broken knife, some notes on a picnic, the result of
Tatt’s sweep, and an invite to a gospel meeting.

SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 1896.
To the Protectionists of N.S. Wales.
The recent election at Waverley (N.S.W.)
showed that in a great Foreign-trade strong-
hold the importers’ majority has largely
declined, and this fact has put a certai
amount of confidence into the Protections
party. The Cowra election, which followec
shortly afterwards, showed that in a Prc
tectionist stronghold the previously sma
minority of the shoddy party had grown sti
smaller, and this further encouraged th
N.S.W. National Party to look forward t
the good time coming when they will anne
the portfolios and the salaries. In th
ordinary course of events nothing can pre
vent its turn coming by-and-bye, unles
the party invents some even more effectual
method of cutting its own throat than ha
yet been discovered. The arrival of genuin
Freetrade in everything save alcohol ant
tobacco, which is due about the year 1900 o
so, if nothing occurs in the interim, will do
more to damage the importers’ cause than
anything that has yet happened in the
province. The fact that the old, conserva
tive Calico Jimmy element and the new
Labor element can never really coalesce is
another factor which tends to break up the
Foreign-trade party. The other fact that the
community grows weary of every Ministry,
sooner or later, and that Government by
Contradiction consists mostly in putting out
the man that the nation has grown tired of,
and replacing him by the man that it was
tired of previously, makes it dead certain
that the Protectionists will get their oppor-
tunity sooner or later. How much later it
will be, and how long the opportunity will
last when it comes, and when it goes how
long it will be before it comes again, are
matters which depend almost wholly on the
party itself and on its leaders. The Bulle-
tin therefore invites the Protectionist body
to seriously consider the position of its re-
presentatives in Parliament, and how they
got into that position, and to compare it with
the one they occupied a very few years ago,
and to weep over the result of the investi-
gation.
* * * *
A few years back the Protectionists were
the democratic element of N.S.W. Assembly.
They were the supporters of the land and
income tax policy, the men who wanted to
explode the great land monopoly, the main
supporters of payment of members and one-
man-one-vote. On more than one occasion
they pushed direct taxation measures through
the Assembly in the face of bitter opposition
from the Free-raid and Calico Jimmy inter-
est, only to lose them in a hostile Upper
House, which was solid almost to the last
fossil on Cobdenism. In those days the
State Land Bank, the State Bank of Issue,
the Referendum, the Abolition of Party Go-
vernment, the Woman Franchise, and other
burning questions of to-day had hardly begun
to arrive in politics; but, if they had ar-
rived, there is hardly a doubt, from the atti-
tude of the two parties, that the Protection-
ists would have supported them heartily, and
that the Foreign-trade-revenue-tariff men
would have been furiously hostile. Every
democrat worth calling such among the poli-
ticians of a few years ago was in the ranks of
the Protectionists ; the party was honored with
the loathing of the Legislative Council—the
surest proof that it deserved the confidence
of the people ; and the S.M. Herald looked
upon it with disgust, whereas now that
paper regards it rather as an erring brother.
And on the other side of the House were
the old Freetraders, the softgoods element
in the frock-coat and the shiny pot-hat, the
big landlords, the property-suffrage and vote-
for-thrift men, the solid individuals who
hated the very name of direct-taxation, the
worst class of religious bigots, the great mass
of the Upper House, Abigail, Parkes,
John Davies, the Yellow Pup generally,
and everything that was effete and moss-grown
and crusted over with the ancient crust of
time and prejudice.
* * * *
Then the unstable and incompetent leaders
of the National cause fooled their great chance
away. The game of Government by Con-
tradiction is at all times a difficult one to
play, and Dibbs played it badly, while Lyne
played it still worse. The Freetraders took
up the Land-and-Income tax, which they
had formerly opposed with all their power
and influence, and the Protectionist leaders,
who had formerly fought in defence of that
principle, drifted into opposing it simply
because it is the habit of the Opposition,
under the beautiful party system, to oppose
everything. The Freetraders, who had
urged the Upper House by frantic peti-
tions to reverse the will of the people’s
representatives by rejecting the Dibbs tariff,
attempted to curtail the power of that
aggressive body in order to prevent it doing
the very thing which they had previously, in
another set of conditions, urged it to do ;
and the Protectionist leaders, instead of
assisting them in the work, wandered by
their feeble policy of drift into being the
champions of their old enemy. Thereupon
the Upper House extended to them the right
hand of friendship, and with a lamentable
want of foresight they accepted the clammy
and shapeless offering and appeared before
the country as the champions and accom-
plices of the Fat Man chamber. They
attempted, through the mouth of G. Repub-
lican Dibbs, to repudiate the principle of
Payment of Members, of which they had
been the warmest advocates—apparently
because its former opponents, G. Reid and
Co., had become favorable to it. The Pro-
tectionist party, after a long and hard battle,
abolished the property vote in New South
Wales, and its tactless Parliamentary bosses
even began to show hostility to their own
great work when their enemies commenced
to approve of it. The Australian Star, the
recognised organ of the party, by its gradual
drift from Liberalism to advanced Toryism,
showed how the Protectionist leaders fell
from grace, just as the Telegraph, the
Foreign-trade organ, by its drift from
Liberalism to an even worse variety of Tory-
ism, shows how the bosses of the Calico
Jimmy interest would gladly fall also, if the
pressure of the Labor-party did not keep
them progressing. And the Protectionist
bosses fell simply because Lyne and Dibbs
stuck to the old party theory that an Oppo-
sition should oppose the Government in all
things, right or wrong ; that it should be
against the Government even if it was doing
the things which the Opposition had consis-
tently advocated ; and that the beginning,
middle, and end of its existence was to be
against the Government.
* * * *
There was no reason, apart from the desire
to be against the Government, why they
should have drifted into this fatal position.
In Maoriland the Protectionist party is also
the Labor party and the party which upholds
the land and income taxes, the State Land
Bank, woman suffrage, the compulsory eight-
hours’ system, the minimum wage, the State
insurance system, and the most advanced
political programme ever put forward by any
Australasian Government. In Victoria it
is the party which supports manhood and
womanhood suffrage, land and income tax,
State banking, the suppression of sweating
and bogus banks, the reform of the Legisla-
tive Council, and every other democratic
movement. In South Australia it is the
democratic party pure and simple. In N.S.
Wales it was the democratic party, but its
leaders, in their utter inability to see beyond
the miserable party exigencies of the moment,
have insisted on identifying it with every
Tory and every Tory movement which pro-
mised temporary assistance against the
Government. By thus selling their
democratic principles to buy the feeble
support for the moment of forty or fifty
ancient incapables in the Upper House, they
threw away the support later on of 40,000 or
50,000 democratic And they did not
even get the price of their ruinous bargain,
for the M’s.L.O. keep dying off, and the Go-
vernment replaces them with new men who
are younger and not so fat, and who know
not Lyne, so that the vote of the democratic
section of the community was mostly lost,
and that of the Upper House was not per-
manently gained.
• * * *
Idle situation now is a noble example of
the workings of Government by Contradic-
tion. Since the Dibbs-Lyne Ministry estab-
lished manhood suffrage pure and simple,
the vote of N.S. Wales is mainly a democratic
vote. The Protectionist leaders waited long
for the chance of appealing to this demo-
cratic vote, and apostatised just when it
came. On the fiscal question the country is
probably about equally divided. The Pro-
tectionist party represents the democracy
quite as well as the other, if not better.
Protection is the policy of the workman who
wants work at making boots and all manner
of other things for the local market, and the
farmer who wants a local market for his
butter and wheat and fruit. Freetrade is the
policy of the big importer in York-street,
Sydney, and his clients and dependents,
and of the squatter, whose wool goes abroad
in any case, and who views a good local
market for produce merely as a thing which
makes the pestilent selector multiply on his
run. Therefore, the Protectionist party is
at least as democratic as the other. It has
quite as much reason as the other to desire
the bursting up of big estates by a Land-tax
or otherwise ; the establishment of a State
Land Bank to suppress usurious rates of in-
terest ; the creation of a State Bank of Issue
which won’t burst and thereby create panics
and dislocate industry ; the minimum wage ;
the reform of the Council, which mainly re-
presents its inveterate enemies, the big
land-grabber and the usurer; and every other
good thing which the Reid Ministry has
offered or promised. And, in addition to
these, it wants Protection, for the sufficient
reason that it wants work and wages above
all other things.
* » * *
Meanwhile, circumstances over whicli the
Protectionists of the country at large have
no control, have made Lyme their principal
representative in Parliament. He was
appointed because he has great ability as
leader of an Opposition in the party sense—
that is to say, he has great ability in ex-
posing the errors of his opponents, and
stumps the country eloquently and inde-
fatigably in the party’s interests, and can
manage elections admirably, and will some
day, without doubt, if he lives and retains
his position, lead his followers back to
power—and won’t have the faintest idea what
to do with it, in any large and statesmanlike
sense, when he gets there. The party can’t
get rid of its able and brilliant incubus,
except by throwing him out at next election,
and that, in all probability, can only be done
by putting in a Freetrader and endorsing
Freetrade ; and the party in general can’t
do it—only the small section which consti-
tutes the Hume electorate ; and even if it
was done some other electorate would pro-
bably return the ejected one at the first
opportunity. The party in general can’t ex-
plain in any effectual way that it wants Pro-
tection and doesn’t want Lyne, or that
it wants Protection and Lvne, but that
it respectfully requests Lyne to add a
number of other democratic reforms to his
programme in addition to Protection, and if
it doesn’t want, Lyne it can’t signify what
other leader it does want. It can’t explain
when it returns Lyne and See by big
majorities, that it does so only because they
support Protection, and not because they
oppose almost every other of the country’s
democratic aspirations. It can’t make it
plain to these gentlemen which of their prin-
ciples it disapproves of, and thus give them
a chance to reform. It can’t explain any-
thing, m fact; it can only put them in, which
means enthusiastic approval of their Conser-
vatism, or put their opponents in, which
means whole-souled approval of their policy
of destroying local industries for the benefit
of the importer. _ The Protectionist leaders
now that they have relapsed into crusted
loryism, offer the country practically no-
thing except Protection; and the country
will accept only when it wants Protection so
very badly indeed that it will let every other
democratic aspiration go for the sake of
getting it.
* * * *
A leader of Lyne’s abilities who offered
genuine Protection, a good system of Local
Government, an income-tax and a graduated
land-tax with increased exemptions, absentee-
tax, woman suffrage, a State Land Bank on
a well-conceived plan, State life-insurance a
of d Partv llo^ 0 y ° f n ° te iSBUes ’ the abolition
ot Paity Government, an elective Upper
House, a drastic Companies Act, a measure
for the abolition of sweating, and who pro-
mised to cease borrowing and construct public
works out of revenue—in short, a Protec-
lomst leader of Lyne’s calibre with a vigor-
ous democratic programme, and who looked
as if he was a real democrat and not merely
? f °. r , the tnne being— might have got ?

lace. It may be a first-rate boot-lace, but
other things are needful as well. The pre-
sent situation of the Protectionists of New
South Wales is a mournful commentary
on the insufficiency of Party Government.
And until Ministers are elected by Parlia-
ment instead of getting there by accident,
and the Referendum is established so that
the community can express its opinion on
measures and men separately, when it wants
the measures and not the men, or the men
and not the measures, or part of one and
part of the other, there seems no remedy for
such deadlocks as the present.
How the Q. Government Party Won the
Elections.
As anticipated, the Queensland Government
party has been victorious at the general elec-
tion, and returns to power—numerically, at
least—almost as strong as in last Parliament.
Brisbane Courier, and Sydney Morning
Herald, and Melbourne Argus —and doubt-
less all the other Australasian Tory organs—
have duly congratulated it upon this result.
All that is left to the democratic press is to
congratulate it upon the manner in which this
result was accomplished.
* * * *
The Q. Govt, party won the elections by the
aid of the plural or property-vote—the vote
which measures a man not by what he is, but
by what he owns ; the vote which weighs flesh
and blood against bricks and mortar ; the vote
which worships the land-jobber, and the boom-
speculator, and the dummy-swindler, and'snaps
its fingers in the face of struggling industry;
the vote which counts wealth a glory to a man,
and poverty his abiding dishonor ; the vote
which declares that the ideal citizen is not an
Abraham Lincoln, but a Jay Gould, not the
toiler who bears the burdens of the people, but
the financial robber who exploits the people,
and founds the aggrandisement of an individual
upon the sufferings of a community. The
Government majority does not represent Man-
hood ; it represents Mortgages.
* * * *
The Q. Govt, party won the elections by
systematic disfranchisement of the electors
opposed to it. This disfranchisement began
with the absolute refusal to so reform the elec-
toral law that a man, in theory entitled to vote,
might vote wherever he chanced to be within
the province. The chief industries of Queens-
land are wool-growing and mining ; it is upon
these that she depends to balance imports with
exports ; it is from the profits of these that she
pays the interest upon her large foreign debt;
these stand between her and public and private
insolvency. Her agriculture, her manufactures,
are still little more than self-supporting. Here
is no reason to show favor to the agriculturist
and the artisan. But the artisan and the agri-
culturist are naturally confined to the districts
where they labor; they are stay-at-homes;
they have votes. Many miners, many men en-
gaged in the wool industry, are inevitably driven
to travel from place to place in search of profitable
employment; they are rovers ; they have no
votes. The injustice cries for remedy ; but the
bush laborers are notorious opponents of the
Govt, party, and the cry is stifled. The Queens
land Government is a public garrotter.

ihe Q. Govt, party won the elections by
shamelessly prostituting the machinery of go-
vernment to partisan ends. The Premier of the
province put himself at the head of a Political
Association whose chief mission was the dis-
franchisement of democratic voters. From the
Premier s office, over the Premier’s signature,
was issued circular after circular on behalf of
this, class organisation, exhorting the “purg-
ing of the rolls, the selection of “good men”
as agents and candidates, the defence of the
privileges of the propertied class, the pre-
vention of the spread of democratic principles.
he electoral registrars and electoral revision
courts continually felt the pressure of this
association—with the Premier’s name and offi-
cial authority behind it—urging, on various
pretexts, that the names of its suspected politi-
cal opponents be struck off the electoral rolls.
he levising magistrates—mostly nominees and
supporters of the Government—needed little
persuasion to deal severely with the voter who
based his claim to the franchise merely on
ns manhood; but, if any persuasion was
needed, the formal union of the head of the
Government with the Political Association sup-
phed it. This prostitution of the Premier’s
office sanctified party dishonesty, as thousands
of voteless Democrats to-day are well aware.
-IN or, even when the Democratic voter had
passed every legal pitfall, complied with every
formal punctilio, and thoroughly proved his
tight to vote, was his vote always secured to
him. At the revision courts, last January,
■ '1 new v °ters were added to the list. These,
tu the ordinary course, would have been entitled
to vote in April, and Parliament does not meet
till June. But the spies of the Political Asso-
ciation considered that most of these new
'oteis were adverse to the Government, so the
elections, which normally should have taken
place at the end of April, were antedated a
month, and the 3577 new voters were thus dis-
franchised. Thanks to its principals, the
V Govt, party can dispense with principles.

Q - party won the elections by
1 ising to the utmost the power of employers
to intimidate their workmen. In the country,
many squatters stations were appointed
epara e polling-places. This meant that the
dozen or score of men employed knew that the
tally of their votes would be published-so
nany for the Govt, candidate, so many against
him-and that out of a dozen or a score of
o ets i would be easy to discover those who

™ a W , nS the elect °ral rolls were keenly
“ sed ’ and 011 every voter was brought to
the Po Very P° ssible influence. For example,
the Courier agency declared that “great


efforts ” were made at Enoggera to replace
Opposition-leader Drake by R. W. Thurlow,
who crept into Brisbane mayoralty between the
jealousies of worthier men. The following cir-
cular shows the nature of these “ efforts ” :
To Messrs. . Herewith I give you the names of
Enoggera electors employed by your firm, and shall feel
obliged if you will see those gentlemen and kindly report
to me if I can depend upon their assistance and support
on the day of the election. It is essential that I should
have reported not only their promises, but where they are
to be found on that date. Your prompt attention will
oblige, R. W. Thurlow.
In Thurlow’s case, these tactics were fruitless;
in too many instances they were successful.
For vote by ballot, the Government substituted
vote by bludgeon.

The Q. Govt, party won the elections by
electoral fraud, by electoral cajolery, by elec-
toral intimidation, by the employment of every
dishonorable electoral artifice. The Bulletin
congratulates it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Trustees and Trustees.
Victorian Judges are humorous always when
dealing with the matter of fraudulent trustees.
Justice Hood awhile ago made a painfully
funny remark upon the conduct of an unfor-
tunate legal gentleman who had “applied a
client’s money to his own use, and when asked
for it was not able to comply with the request.”
According to his Honor, the aforesaid failure to
cash-up trust-money on demand “ would be
little or no offence in a layman, but it was an
offence in a professional man.” After which
Justice Hood reprimanded the delinquent, or
suspended him from practice for 48 hours, or
did something equally comic under the circum-
stances. It was not an isolated instance of
judicial waggery where fraudulent trusteeism
is concerned. Other Judges have addressed
other such solicitors in exactly the same mild
spirit, and the fact that these professional mis-
appropriators of coin are privileged to apply it
to their own uses is quite notorious—in Smell-
bourne. Nevertheless, one would expect the
potentates of the Bench to forbear from rubbing
the joke into the community’s callous hide.
Not so. The other day Judge Casey passed
sentence upon a youthful P.O. who had
been convicted of secreting lialf-a dozen letters
in his pocket. Doubtless the lad intended to
stick to the letters, although it happened he
was able to produce them, unopened, when
taxed with the offence. Judge Casey made a
speech to the prisoner. He said that the
larcenous letter-sorter, trembling behind the
spikes, was “ in the position of a fraudulent
trustee , and must be made an example of.” And
his Honor did make an example of the youth,
to the tune of 18 months’ hard labor. The
sentence was not unduly harsh, but the joke
was unintentionally cruel. Had that convicted
post-office understrapper occupied the position
of a solicitor who applies a client’s property to
his own use— i.e., had he been before the court,
though not behind the spikes, in the capacity of
a fraudulent legal trustee—he would have gone
forth with his tongue in his respectable cheek,
and no official stain (worth mentioning) on his
character. As it was, he went weeping away
under the wings of two gaol-warders.
A Tory Philanthropist.
Maoriland Tory party wants the limitations
on child-labor removed —in the interests of the
children. (The Vic. Tory party also wants no
limitations put on sweating, in the interests of
the sweated ln fact, it is always the
interests of the poor employe that the lory
party is thinking about). Button, M.H.R.,
voices the opinions of the party thus :
As to the limitation of child-labor, there were many in-
stances already where work which would be of immense
advantage to many families could not be got by boys and
girls who had not passed a certain standard—(A Voice :
“ A good thing, too.”) Was it altogether a, good thing ?
Was it better to “ cram ” a starving child with book learn-
ing or with bread and butter ? —(Applause.)
This, of course, shows that children of any age
should be allowed to toil in factories and work-
shops. Then, the limitations being removed by
the sympathetic Button kindof man, the Button
variety of employer would get his work done
bv ignorant, toil-worn, joyless, stunted children
at ss. a week instead of paying £2 a week to
adults, and the adults would either have to
work cheaper to compete with the children or
else be unemployed, and the “starving
children ” would increase tenfold in number
through the reduction of wages and the in-
crease of competition. Of course, if the
family Button alluded to could put its children
on the labor-market at the present rate of
wages, which rate is maintained by keeping
other children out cf the labor-market, things
would improve for it. But if all children were
treated similarly, then the wages of the adults
of the family would go down with a thud, and
the starvation would remain the same, and the
only gainer would be the employer, as repre-
sented by Button, who would get labor at
greatly reduced rates. Button, by the way,
doesn’t venture to allege that he knows any
family in the painful condition described; he
merely says, as a reason for abolishing the
limitations upon child-labor, that a hungry m '
fant wants food more than learning. Which is
quite as much to the point as if he said that a
cow wants grass rather than a family Bible, and
proved thereby that the Bible should be abol-
ished and the whole country sown with grass
from one end to the other.
Honorary Fat Men.
Dear Bulletin, -Honorary Fat Man be be
1 P or M L.C., must be dismissed in Victoria
before decent systems of government and justice
prevail. The present unpaid M.L.C. is a Mg
block in the way of reform, because only tuft-
hunters guinea pigs, and patronage-mongers
care for f post for which there is no direct
emolument— and the range of candidates offer
Tncr is so limited that the electors rarely have
any choice worth speaking of. The one tnft-
hunter in the field nets the position by default.
A nominee Upper House or a paid Uppet House
would be better than the present Vic. iambus
but reformers stand aghast at a House that was
designed to be incorrigible and irreclaimable,
and which answers its purpose. The best hope
is deferred hope; tlie Council must be fought
on its own ground, Fat Men a little less offen-
sive than the present crowd must be brought in,
and the House amended by slow degrees. Mean-
while, the present writer wants to make a
suggestion for hurrying up things. It is to
pay members of the Council (as Premier King-
ston has done in South Australia). The
method would be to provide, say, <£2oo per
man, or £9600, in the Appropriation Act,
and thus bring plenty of candidates into
the field at each election. The Council would
resist this item in the Appropriation Act, but
the Assembly could cheerfully wait for its sur-
render. The Council would not dare to throw
out the whole Act, and thus precipitate another
Black Wednesday at this juncture. A Black
Wednesday now would mean five more big
financial institutions and a shoal of small
in liquidation, with the attendant exposures of
“ reputable and respectable ” directors in the
Council and out of it. A Council containing 29
directors, many of them directors of very shaky
institutions, would accept the insult—and the
honorarium. Two objections will be raised to
this suggestion. First, that it is unconstitu-
tional, to which I offer no demur, only stipulat-
ing that is practicable. The other objection is
that it would be rewarding the obstinacy of
those in the Council, and still having a long
lease of membership to run. As a fact it would
cause life-long chagrin to at least 40 (ominous
number) landlords in the Council to have such a
novel and vital influence imported into their
elections, and any little advantage they might
gain for a few sessions would be compensated
by their inevitable defeat at the polls a little
later on—and also by the country’s gain in the
long run.—F.
Because the “Dons” of Sydney University
have shut-down hard upon the senseless repro-
duction here of an asinine English University
custom, the undergraduates got the sulks so
badly that they “ wouldn’t play,” and boycotted
the Commemoration ; but the Commemoration
got along all right, and the sun rose as usual
next morning. The Pundits, in fact, have
come out distinctly on top. The average
Briton’s share of the vis comica doesn’t run to
much beyond the baldest buffoonery. It is not
so much “ sadly ” that he takes his pleasure as
uncouthly, and the dismal tom-fooleries of
English University Commemorations haven’t
even the modest excuse of being funny. They
have immemorial usage, it is contended, behind
them, but the mere antiquity of a custom is, as
often as not, prima-facie evidence of its fatuity.
A tradition of blatant imbecility, at all events,
is a good one not to follow, and the Australian
alumnus, in striving to ape the clumsy rowdyism
of his beef-witted English analogue, is but
doing profitless injustice to his own more agile
mentality and more common-sense environment.
Let him originate for himself a rational
academic legend —not blindly copy what is
either a barbarism or a puerility or both.
Deakin, who spoke at last week’s Melb. anti-
sweating meeting, does not emerge from the
business as well as could have been hoped. One
of his heaviest charges against the Leg. Council
was that it limited the operation of the proposed
Factories Bill to three years. Sargood came out
in next day’s paper with the statement that
Deakin, when lunching with Sargood, origin-
ated the limitation. Deakin’s reply was that
he only referred to the disputed Permit-clause
but common people ask amazedly why Deakin
lunches with his political enemies, and whether
it is a confirmed habit. Furthermore, Deakin
tried to get in a good word for Sargood at the
anti-sweating meeting, but the good word was
howled at, and Deakin saved himself by a
violent peroration which might, and might not,
mean a good deal. Vacillation and compromise
have dogged Deakin too long, and it is due to
himself that he reform. Let him learn a verse
from the Song of Compromise :
I paralyze the hand of God
When He would loose at last
The cataract of vengeance due
For age-old crimes of caste !
Lands - Minister Carruthers, in publicly
threatening that he intended to' scrutinise the
bond-Mes of. every “conditional purchase
taken up under the Land Act of 61, or any
subseouent Act up to that of last year, was
merelv breathing wind. It is certain that all
c.p’s under the ’6l Act have either been forfeited
or certificated—many of them have passed
through several hands —and are now fairly
beyond any Ministerial reach. It is probable
also that dummying was absolutely legal in
New South Wales until ’75, and it is hard to
see how the law can go behind that fact. Again,
the Act of ’B4 provides definitely for the safety
of then existing certificated c.p’s. Yet, because
of the Carruthers threat, the New South
Wales banks are alleged—very much alleged,
apparently—to have begun to shut down on
advances to, and to call up the overdrafts of,
all squatters and others in re c.p. holdings.
And from a business point of view, the banks
are justified in doing so. Not that the “Crown
can absolutely regain the c.p’s, but because of
the possible tremendous cost of law proceedings,
if they should be conducted after the deadly
fashion of the Mercadool cases. Adding this
Hay terror to the Landaninkum tax, there is
new force in the advice—“ go on the land,
young man ; ” and new joy for the man who
has gone there.
The other day “ Lady ” Stout, wife of Robert,
K C M.G., put a dreadful spoke in her hus-
band’s wlieel for next election by expressing, at
a public meeting and in the most distinct terms,
her approval of Chinese immigration and her
admiration of the nice, clean, civil, industrious,
thrifty Chinaman. Stout has been an unsatis-
factory Democrat for a long time past. He has
been trying for a number of years to make
people forget his alliance with Vogel and his
awful Midland Railway. He tried hard to
succeed Ballance in the Premiership, and
if he had done so he was quite will-
ing to be an advanced Liberal and
follow in the dead leader’s footsteps. He didn t
get there, however, so he has been the candid
and disagreeable friend of th ®
don Ministry ever since. He has careiuiiy
avoided showing any signs of Toryism while he
was awake, in public at all events, but pro-
bably he has made wild remarks in his sleep
about his inclination to join Russell, and upset
the whole Government apple-cart, and bring in
Chinamen and land-grant railways, and stoush
Seddon in one act. Probably, also, he has made
similar observations over the mutton at dinner,
when he was unusually grumpy, and his wife,
thinking it was all real, has given Robert away
in public—the private Robert who was never
intended for publication—and created an im-
pression which he won’t get over for another 10
years, at least. No one will believe that Mrs.
Stout wasn’t voicing the hidden sentiments of
Robert, K.C.M.G., even though that lady
protests in sackcloth and ashes and tears, on
the platform of the Town Hall ; and the
Premiership of a Liberal Ministry, which
Stout has been waiting for so patiently,
looks as if it was gone for ever. The moral
is that no man should accept a title, and by
making his wife a “ Lady ” cause her to be
rushed after for platform-oratory purposes,
because every man’s wife knows him as some-
thing quite different from what he wants the
public to think he is, and she sees so much of
the domestic Robert that she is apt to forget
the other one. No public man would last long
if his wife took to explaining him as she sees
him. Supposing the wife of Premier Reid took
to believing and publicly expounding her hus-
band’s private views about the N.S.W. Labor-
party, for instance !
A new terror to newspaper-proprietors, &c.,
and a new source of income to “supers” and
others, are threatened as the result of a late
English libel-case. In Russell v. Notcutt, a
theatrical artiste recovered £lOO damages for a
libel which consisted in publishing her “ out of
her legitimate order on the playbill.” In this
case defendant apparently did it after his at-
tention had been called to it, but there are loud
complaints by him and many English papers
that it was held to be unnecessary that plaintiff
should prove that there was “ express malice ”
in the misplacing. As a matter of fact, the
law implies malice from the fact of publica-
tion. The case is certainly a peculiar one, and
may have consequences serious enough to war-
rant its consideration in any reforms in the
anomalous libel-law. It might possibly con-
trol the case of a newspaper reporting the
lawyers engaged in a case out of the order of
precedence ; and who is to tell that it may not
afford a cause of action to a Catholic archbishop
who is named in a Guvmentouse function after
a Protestant bishop ?
The attention of ladies interested in raising the
“age at which a mere ignorant child is per-
mitted by law to consent to her own infamy ”
is directed to the proceedings at Warragul
(Vic.) police court on April 14, when a “ mere
ignorant child ” only 11£ years old prosecuted
her adopted father on a charge of criminal
assault set forth with the greatest circumstan-
tiality. The monster guilty of this outrage
was not, however, punished, for the simple
reason that there wasn’t any monster and there
wasn’t any outrage, and the “ mere ignorant
child” of 11J went into the witness-box and
swore with the greatest coolness that she had
fabricated the entire story because her adopted
father was cross with her and she “ thought
she would like to go away for a change.” The
natural yearning for a “ change ” of the hys-
terical young female in a monotonous locality,
and the manner in which she secures it—as at
Gunnedah, Warragul, and a dozen other places
recently—at the expense of the most convenient
male, is suggested as a nice subject for the
age-of-consent essayists to spread themselves
over. The Warragul innocent, by the way,
goes scot free, as usual. There doesn’t seem
much else to do with a young lady whose
natural cussedness breaks out so early ; still
the advocates for “ equal laws for women ” may
note that she does go free.
It looks hard to the needy authorities of Sydney
Zoo that the Treasury should refuse the usual
£ for £ grant on the £5O of salary which secre-
tary Catlett has foregone for the benefit of the
Society. But the Treasury principle is the
sound one. Not once or twice hospital officials,
especially in outlying parts of Australia, have,
with the design of bulkily adding to their
funds, fixed up employes on a generous scale,
the understanding being that such employb
would denote £lO, £2O or £3O of the amount to
the respective institutions. The writer recalls
a case in which an hospital secretary, who
would have accepted the post at £5O, was
offered £lOO on the specified condition of giving
back £5O, which, on the Government plan of
£ for £ supplied the grocer-souled committee
with a secretary gratis. Mr. Catlett has been
on a fixed salary for many years, and as his
donation is but recent it is obvious that no
suspicion attaches to the Zoo committee ; but
if the Treasury honored the claim it would
suggest more wrongdoing to various bodies of
smart officials than it perpetrates by repu-
diating the Society’s claim in the present in-
stance.
Attorney-General Byrnes is of opinion that
Queensland can’t afford to federate lest its
trade might go to Sydney instead of to Bris-
bane (The idea that Queensland exists tor
anv purpose except to supply trade to Brisbane
probably doesn’t occur to Byrnes.) It is diffi-
cult to take Nelson’s dreadfully smart young
man seriously in this matter. Under Federa-
tion there will be one railway system, pre-
sumably one uniform railway rate, and no
border tariff; therefore trade must tend to
make for the nearest port, other things being
equal. Brisbane is a nearer port for all South
Queensland than Sydney or Newcastle, and it
should not only keep all the South Queensland
trade, but annex that of New South Wales as
far south as Glen Innes. If it doesn t, it can
only be because Brisbane is such a lamentable
port that people will pay higher railway rates
to ship their produce by Sydney or Newcastle.
But even at the worst, Federation should
help Brisbane, to some extent, at New South
Wales’s expense, by reason of its advantage in
distance, and Byrnes’s story is too thin. Ihe
real trouble is that the Fat Men of the nigger-
haunted land of leprosy don’t want to federate
with the beastly Democrats of New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and possibly
Maoriland, and give all these people a voice in
their affairs. Federation will be fatal to the
Fat Man regime Up North.
A vociferous milkman, one O’Keefe, has been
fined ss. at South Melbourne for crying “ Milk,
O ! ” on a Sunday morning, in the vicinity of a
place of worship. The noisy merchant made
himself heard within the tabernacle, and the
saints couldn’t pray for thinking that he was
a ha’penny a quart cheaper than their own milk-
man. Or else he clashed with the shepherd’s
discourse. Anyway, O’Keefe got fined. The
Loard’s Christian servants appear to have
things all their own way on Sundays. If a
sinner arranges a card-party, or an amateur
concert, he can’t effectively prosecute the
aggressive street-preacher who chooses to give
tongue on the kerbstone outside his place of
worship. The pious nuisance howls with im-
punity, whereas the useful member of society
who retails suction for the baby and liquid
ingredient for the toothsome custard-pudding
is forbidden to proclaim the Word. And this
reminds us that the law doesn’t protect the
Jewish Sabbath from street cries. O’Keefe
might stop his cart at the gates of the Syna-
gogue on the last day of the week and give ’em
“ Milk, 0 ! ” till further orders.
Melbourne Argus contends that the assertion
that a land-tax will reduce the value of land
and so enable the poor man to occupy it “is as
ridiculous as it is immoral ” :
For prices can only be reduced by rendering the land
less profitable than before, and the smaller the profit the
less the land is fit for the poor man’s occupation, and the
more is it likely to fall into the hands of capitalists who
can work it on a large scale.
The one conclusion to be drawn from this gospel
is that the poor man can never get near the
land on any terms. If it is cheap it must be
unprofitable, and will starve him ; if it is pro-
fitable, it is dear, and he can’t pay for it. The
Argus overlooks, or fails to understand, the
fact that a scientific land-tax does not decrease
the producing value of land, but only its specu-
lative value. Land in Collins-street would be
more valuable to the country and quite as
valuable to those who work upon it if it paid a
bouncing value-tax, but it would be of less
value to the landlord. Same with country
land. That vast tract between Melbourne and
Geelong, held by the Cijirnsides, would, under
the stimulus of a stiff graduated land-tax, soon
become of tremendous value to the people and
the State, because it would no longer pay the
Chirnsides to run a few sheep upon miles and
miles of arable land within almost a stone’s
throw of metropolitan markets.
In additions to the arguments often given
against allowing Judges too much rope in
deciding questions of fact, on account of their
hermit life and want of knowledge of the real
world, the following from “Junius ” on lawyers
generally is worth noting :
As to lawyers, their profession is supported by the in-
discriminate defence of right and wrong. ... As a
practical profession, the study of the law requires but a
moderate portion of abilities. The learning of a pleader
is usually upon a level with his integrity. The indis-
criminate defence of right and wrong contracts the under-
standing, while it corrupts the heart. Subtlety is soon
mistaken for wisdom, and impunity for virtue. If there
be any instances upon record, as some there are un-
doubtedly, of genius and morality united in a lawyer,
they are distinguished by their singularity, and operate
as exceptions.
The extract has especial point just now when
there appears to be a tendency to the indis-
criminate appointment of stipendiary magis-
trates from the ranks of the lawyers alone.
Hay, and Hell, and Booligal,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You come and see me, boys,” he said ;
“ You’ll find a welcome and a bed
And whisky any time you call,
Although our township hasn’t got
The name of quite a lively spot —
You see, I live in Booligal.
“ And people have an awful down
Upon the district and the town—
Which worse than hell itself they call;
In fact, the saying far and wide
Along the Riverina side
Is ‘ Hay and Hell and Booligal.’
“ No doubt it suits ’em vfery well
To say it’s worse than Hay or Hell,
But don’t you heed their talk at all.
Of course, there’s heat—no one denies—
And sand and dust and stacks of flies,
And rabbits, too, at Booligal.
“ But such a pleasant, quiet place,
You never see a stranger’s face—
They hardly ever care to call.
The drovers mostly pass it by ;
They reckon that they’d rather die
Than spend a night in Booligal.
“ The big mosquitoes frighten some—
You’ll lie awake to hear ’em hum—
And snakes about the township crawl;
But shearers, when they get their cheque,
They never come along and wreck
The blessed town of Booligal.
“ But down in Hay the shearers come
And fill themselves with fighting-rum,
And chase blue devils up the wall,
And fight the snaggers every day,
Until there is the deuce to pay —
There’s none of that in Booligal.
“ Of course, there isn’t much to see—
The billiard-table used to be
The great attraction for us all,
Until some careless, drunken curs
Got sleeping on it in their spurs,
And ruined it, in Booligal.
“ Just now there is a howling drought
That pretty near has starved us out—
It never seems to rain at all;
But, if there should come any rain,
You couldn’t cross the black-soil plain
You’d have to stop in Booligal.”
“ We’d have to stop ! ” With bated breath
We prayed that both in life and death
Our fate in other lines might fall :
“ Oh, send us to our just reward
In Hay or Hell, but, gracious Lord,
Deliver us from Booligal'. ”

Hie step from Oscar Wilde’s fluffy comedy
to the tragic “ Fedora ” is a long and sudden one,
but the B. and B. co. get over it without acci-
dent. “Fedora” opened well, and, if the public
appreciation of Saturday night rests on a sub-
stantial cash basis, it ought to be a paying spec.
It has all the thrill of melodrama, without the
corpse being dropped with too conspicuous a slump
right behind the footlights, and as the time usually
employed in making the corpse, finding, diagnos-
ing, and removing it, wiping up the blood-stain
and similar menial offices, is all saved, there is so
much the more leisure for thrill. The crime itself
is a gentlemanly, evening-dress affair which no one
can object to. But “Fedora” is a work of art
mainly as an essay on the cussedness of things in
general, and their unspeakable tendency to go
askew. It is the story of a woman who, in an ir-
responsible moment, starts a big stone rolling
downhill, and vainly calls to it to stop, till
finally it rolls over herself and everybody she
loves, and flattens out her little world into one
general wreck. She is almost the only woman
on record who proved herself an absolutely
reliable shot, with a stone or anything else,
and the results are so tragic that other women
should leave the business alone. The manner
in which Fedora works out her vengeance till it
gets beyond her control, and then repents of
it, and hangs shrieking on to the tail of the
monster she has created, and tries to stop it as
vainly as a speck holding back a Juggernaut, is
exceedingly artistic. It may not be very high art,
but the details of it —such art as it is—are perfect.

Mrs. Brough’s Fedora is an excellent crea-
tion, so far as it goes. It would look a lot better
if the public hadn’t seen her agonise in so many
characters and learned her methods, as they learn
everybody’s methods, sooner or later ; if she were
a new actress, and the Russian lady her first
appearance in this country, she would probably
score a triumph. Whether her death-scene is
realistic or not, no one really knows, for, nowa-
an enthusiast in art can’t buy a distracted
female and poison her in a drawing-room to see
how she dies ; but, at all events, it looks as
realistic as anyone could reasonably ask, and the
performance is a graceful and finished one all
through. Titheradge’s Ipanoff is not nearly so
good as many things this accomplished actor has
done. Ward and Miss Faber do the light and
frisky characters admirably, but the police-agent
of Dot Boucicault is the very best of the minor
parts, in his stoniness, and his strict atten-
tion to business, and his cold, stolid, unemotional
readiness to knout anybody on the shortest notice.
If a Russian police-agent doesn’t look exactly like
Boucicault it is his own fault. He certainly ought
to look that way.

“Thoroughbred,” which is new to Sydney,
is to be the next production at the Cri., and is due
on 2nd May.

A large, harrowing impossibility is the
“ Broad Arrow ’’-so-called, The Bulletin be-
lieves, because ice-cream doesn’t grow in Dahomey
—at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. It is a play in which
incongruity howls at large, and Time and Space
go round together on all-fours and hiccough at
each other on the sea-coast of Bohemia, and co-
herence is out in a state of awful drunk and in-
capable in the region where the green, unripe fact
grows on the rum-shrub, and where all things are
mixed up beyond comprehension. The most as-
tonishing events happen in it in a perfectly friendly
manner, and excite no surprise worth mentioning.
The villain, in the course of a brief but tempestu-
ous career, commits a robbery and gets his brother
fired out for it, embezzles <£20,000 from the same
patient brother when he comes back, gets him
gaoled for stealing his own money, “ blews ” the
principal girl’s fortune, annexes another man’s
wife and has him gaoled also, wrecks a train in
public, partially strangles a lady in evening dress,
and generally wades in gore. He is aided by a
wholly impracticable tunnel—the trains pass the end
of it instead of going through, and it is evidently
meant only for ventilation —and by an unaccount-
able Punch-and-Judy show. The hero takes refuge
in the Punch and J udy, after making his escape
from prison and being shot at and blown up in the
train, and coming down again on a corpse which
proves, by the papers in the pocket, to be that of
his best girl’s long-lost brother who wasn’t pre-
viously mentioned in the drama ; and he goes off
in the presence of the police with the uncouth
entertainment wrapped round him. Then, a
moment later, the next scene reveals him bursting
violently into a friend’s home for refuge, where
the Punch and Judy has somehow arrived in front
of him, through a door that is too small to let it
in, and is resting peacefully in a corner. Finally,
some of the many charges against him are cleared
up by the unsupported statement of the red-
headed drunk, and another accusation is removed
through the assertion of an unauthorised female
that the old convict explained it on his death-bed,
and the deed of gift which was going to cause the
old father s ejection having been found by the
abducted vvife whose previous husband was con-
cealed behind the curtain just before the parent
came in and cast everybody off in the presence of
"J e na, tural result of it all is something
that Ihe Bulletin can’t at present remember.
* * *
The cast mostly requires no particular
mention. Alfred Woods, who makes the best
comic aboriginal in A ustralia, is not at home in
tragic characters. In fact, except Leston and
Robert Inman, no one looks particularly at home.
Ihe leading lady, Miss Lilia Wilde, is good in
spots and very depressing in other spots, and the
rest of the co. seem mostly overwhelmed by the
ridiculousness of the show, and walk through it
apologetically. The railway accident is a large,
red, satisfying incident, and a new light is thrown
on Dartmoor as a place where the convict affably
tells the warder to get his hair cut with impunity,
and that about sums up the drama.

“ Djin-Djin ” is now in its fourth week at
Sydney Lyceum, and the audience still recalls
Coleman four times after the Scarecrow Dance
with severe regularity. There are many good
items in the panto., but the one which has soaked
deepest into the public soul is evidently the Scare-
crow Dance. Probably this is because Coleman’s
attitude is so suggestive of a defunct preacher who
has been hanged with his belltopper on, and left
there till his black suit grew rusty with exposure,
and the belltopper got bashed down over his ear,
and he became a murky ruin. Also, Coleman’s
dance shows that a scarecrow is practically an old
curate gone to seed, and it explains where the
disused curates go to, and various other matters.

B. Holt’s great military and bare-legged
spectacle, at Sydney Royal, has undergone no
change, and seems like lasting for a good while
longer. On Friday, it is to be under military
patronage; the local warrior is going to roll up
and look at himself in all the ridiculousness of his
bird-of-paradise get-up, and it is to be hoped the
lesson will do him good.

The Tivoli show rages with unabated fury.
Alice Leamar has sprung some new songs on the
Sydney public, and La Belle Maie has invented
some new attitudes on her slack wire, and a new
bass person, named Peter J osephs, is in fine voice,
and the general result is satisfactory. Sydney
Music Hall also keeps its head above water, largely
by the aid of a mystic person, named Lazron, who
knocks gravity out in one round, and reduces
Time and Space to general wreck ; but the Opera
House has gone under, and is again the deserted
wreck it used to be.

“ The Work Girl,” late of Sydney, was let
loose again at Melbourne Royal on Saturday. It
is difficult to trace any connection between this
raw-boned melodrama and the sweating evil
although it wanders into an alleged mantle-factory
m the fourth act. The girls employed at the fac-
tory are a sultry crowd. Their daily toil includes
a couple of comic songs and a rather dissolute
ballet. They sometimes make a pretence of
putting stitches into strips of calico, but, as a rule,
they spend the hours snatched from festivity in
calling the forewoman an “old cat.” The fatted
Hebrew who runs the establishment has no terrors
for them. They tear his top garments ofif his back
previous to hustling him under the table and loot-
ing his trousers, and the curtain falls upon a
tableau of two oppressed mantle-makers flourish-
ing a pair of unmentionables in the face of common
decency. A grave question as to what happens
after this is left open. Probably the victorious
damsels draw lots for the bulk of the Hebrew’s
wardrobe and split up his socks into souvenirs.
* * * *
The hero of “ The Work Girl” is originally
a stone-broke punter, pursued by a heavy villain
who covets his weeping wife. The wife, for her
part, gets overtaken by sudden death, which fatal
incident enables her to re-appear, as her own
daughter, 14 years later, when she loses her heart
to a painful young man, and secures an illicit
baby in exchange. Foolishness seems to run in
the family. Then the hero, having served a
long term of gaol, comes seeking his lost offspring,
and is grieved to find himself a grandfather under
such improper circumstances. All this while a
second villain is chasing his wealthy accomplice
with proofs of a foul murder committed in the
prologue. Finally truth prevails, and the mis-
creant in purple and fine linen comes to grief
along with the evil Genesis who was torn from his
pants. The mother of the unaffiliated infant gets
cleansed of her sin by plunging into the sea of
matrimony, and many other little matters are
cleared up or allowed to die.
*-* * *
The name-part appears to be played by
Miss Florrie Ford, an artiste plucked from the
alls. Anyway, Miss Florrie figures as a work-
girl, of a sort. Her acting is very devoid of detail
but she gives plenty of voice to her lines, and is
associated throughout with a cheerful tripe-dealer
(manager Westmacott). Scot Inglis, Plimmer,
Hazlitt, and J. W. Sweeney hang on to the stray
glimpses of plot with much vigor, whilst Miss
Harrie Ireland impersonates two females in dis-
tress. Miss Ireland, one regrets to observe, is
less sincere in her stage emotions than she used to
be, wherefore, seeing that the young lady has a
fine presence and ample intelligence to work upon
The Bulletin exhorts her to hurry up and do
further credit to her admiring country. Miss
Minna Phillips shines in the minor character of a
sassiety vixen, and the vehicles employed at her
interrupted wedding give pleasure to all.

At the Opera House the last two weeks of
Charles Godfrey are ebbing away, and a benefit
to that sometimes hoarse, but never coarse
comedian is announced. The Waxworks is anxious
to remind country visitors that it still occupies
the same old Bourke-street site, and is always up-
to-date in the Chamber of Horrors. A neat
entertainment by the veteran Cunard happens
there twice daily, for the sake of the surrounding
effigies, as well as the general public. Anything
that relieves the monotony of life for a waxworks
figure deserves liberal support.

“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” trimmed with an
interlude performance of trick-cycling, has started
another season at Melb. Alexandra. Dan. Barry’s
edition of the old hallelujah nigger promises to
pay a handsome dividend ; yet if a balloon
ascent, or some fireworks, were added to the pro-
gramme, it might be even more successful.
Thomas, in this instance, is identical with Larry
Dooley, onetime of the Tivoli company, and,
when the aged slave is submitted to auction in a
dress suit, he looks like a corpulent corner-man
mourning thelossof his tambourine. Luckily, Larry
is harmonious, and his portion of some admirable
singing atones for many shortcomings. A good
deal of music and apotheosis embellishes “ Uncle
Tom’s Cabin,” which, in its darkest and most
ferocious moods, is as wallopsome as ever. The
Simon Legree of Augustus Glover earns due
execration from the gallery. Oily Deering, Dan
Barry, Dobson, Miss Ethel Blair, and a valuable
Topsy in Miss Katie Towers, are in the cast, like-
wise twenty more people, blackened or otherwise.
The bloodhounds, “ kindly lent by <£. £. Smith,”
deserve special mention, on account of their age.
These dawgs, or their ancestors, have been
sniffing at lawyer Marks’s legs as long as anybody
can remember, and they serve to remind grey-
haired citizens of days agone, when they were
young men and didn’t feel well.

A growing spirit of opposition to Little
Billee manifests itself amidst the “ Trilby ”
boom. The play couldn’t proceed very well with-
out any Billee at all, more’s the pity ; but a hard,
unfeeling'public begins to think that the tiresome
lover might be reduced in quantity. Eor instance,
there is no reason why Billee should bring down
the second curtain with his mechanical cry of
“Tarfy, Tarfy, my hea-a-rt is broken!” If he
were to break his heart in profound silence, signi-
fying the smash by a display of pocket-handker-
chief, the curtain would fall more effectively than
at present. “ Tarfy, Tarfy ”is uncalled for,
and the world disapproves of it when it comes.
Apart from Billee and the Laird the company is
well chosen; the stage management is pictur-
esque, and the conclusion thoroughly artis-
tic. Nothing could be better, in its quiet
way, than Miss Jennie Reiffarth’s discovery
of the heroine’s decease, and her tearful warning
of that sad event to the messieurs in the adjoining
room. True, the man ought not to have rushed
away to afternoon tea, leaving Trilby quite alone,
but no matter. One or two grisettes are becoming
famous for the abandon of their backfalls on the
sofa, and the Christmas Eve revels get giddier all
round. The song off the stage was a comparative
failure last week, owing to the indisposition of
Miss Nagel, whose under-study didn’t rival her
rare, deep notes. However, the original organ is
pealing forth once more.
** * *
Little Billee, unconvincing as he appears,
might have been a much sadder failure, according
to the evidence of men fresh from ’Murka. Two
or three youthful Billees have been tried, with
shocking results. Small-sized mummers, even if
they can act, are not educated in the romantic-
lover line of character. They are comedians—
“low” and otherwise. The trouble is to get a
little man, who looks young and pretty, and can
Eersuade the male portion of an audience to take
im seriously when he talks love. Women are not
so difficult to interest in the matter. Many of
them—especially the big, buxom ones—don’t see
anything funny in a sighing mannikin.

A concert, for the worthy purpose of en-
larging the Consumptive Sanatorium at Echuca,
will be given in Melb. Town Hall next Tuesday
(28th). The names of Miss Nagel aforesaid, Miss
Maggie Stirling, and a dozen well-known artists
are down upon the programme, also Miss Kings-
ton, a promising young mezzo-soprano, will debut
on this occasion. Just now, when the first breaths
of winter are striking cold upon Melbourne’s
chest, and hacking coughs are a drug on the
market, the Sanatorium concert should appeal to
all sympathetic pockets. Such as are quite in-
different to the good cause may be touched by the
news that Lord Brassey has promised to attend,
and the list of other influential patrons is nearly
as long as the sea-serpent that rules the waves.

Lalla Miranda has sung to the Parisian
critics, at an invitation concert given by Madame
Richard, her instructress, and the notices predict
a brilliant operatic future for the dark-eyed
damsel. Lalla’s success, when it comes will be a
nasty jar for many Melbourne musical-jargonists
who wouldn’t admit that her sweet voice was
worth a course of training. These weie the people
who gushed over the hard, unsympathetic warble
of Evangeline Florence a few months ago, because
ner meretricious top notes were imported.
After debt cometh the judgment.

The report of the Mutual Life Association,
though a sound and solvent-looking document, gives some
evidence of the prevailing hard times. The premium in-
come for 1895 is £141,821, against £141,943 in 1894 and
£146,104 in 1893. The new premiums for ’95 (£12,482)
are, however, fully £llOO better than the previous year’s
record, which is a sign of improvement, and the receipts
from interest on investments keep up well, which is
another good feature. The total income for the year is
£195,364, and of this £32,000 has been added to the funds,
making them £1,087,767. Also, the death-losses are very
small.
The total expenses for the year are =£38,114 —
rather over 26| per cent, on premiums, or
per cent, on total income. These rates are dis-
tinctly high, but they are a great improvement on
past figures, and as the improvement is steady and con-
tinuous the Mutual Life Association is obviously moving
in the right direction. The securities have been written
down by £10,721, making no less than £30,843 written off
in the last three years for losses and depreciation. This
process may seem somewhat rough on policy-holders, but
it is the only way to keep the society on an absolutely
secure basis. The report is, in all respects, remarkably
full and distinct. It sets down properties acquired by
foreclosure separately from the society’s office premises
and divides freeholds from leaseholds. Overdue interest
is also a separate item, and the extreme smallness of the
amount (£1117) tends to show that the securities are in a
good condition. Also, there are no items in the list of
assets that are calculated to arouse suspicion, and every-
thing looks solid and prosperous.
Apropos of the want of detail in insurance
balance-sheets. The Mutual of Victoria, like the Mutual
Life Association, shows separately office property, pro-
perty acquired by foreclosure, interest accrued and
interest overdue. It also shows rents separately
from interest, and explains how long the overdue interest
has been outstanding. The A.M.P. Society, the Widows’
Fund, and the Temperance and General also show
interest arrears separately and differentiate between office
property and property acquired by foreclosure ; so that
in these five offices there are at least some definite signs
by which the policy-holders can judge how their funds are
getting on. The City Mutual shows foreclosed properties
separately, but says nothing about outstanding interest.
And the National Mutual and Colonial Mutual both lump
together properties purchased with properties foreclosed
and interest accrued with interest overdue, and give a
minimum of information generally'. Why isn’t there a pre-
scribed form of balance-sheet for all insurance-offices?
* * * *
The Royal Bank (Melb.) shows a slight improve-
ment on its previous balance-sheet. The net profits for
the half-year ended 31st March were £2099, against
£2038 for the previous half, and £2136 and £2875 for the
two preceding ones. Said profit equals about £1 Bs. per
cent, per annum, so the question of div. is again left in
abeyance, but the balance to credit of profit and loss now
represents £19,477. Deposits show an increase of £3OOO ;
bills in circulation, an increase of nearly £13,000 ; bills
receivable are £24,000 better, and note circulation has
gone up by £500; and these figures, combined with
the first improvement shown in the profits for a lom>-
time, suggest that things are on the mend with theßoyaf.
The available cash (£89,981) equals nearly 35 per cent, of
the liabilities to the public, which is a remarkably sub-
stantial reserve, and, as the uncalled capital is equal to
nearly double the liabilities, the position of the depositors
is sufficiently good. The directors remark sadly that the
Companies Act hasn’t been passed, and consequently they
are still waiting for an Opportunity to write off lost capi-
tal and put things on an absolutely straight footing, which
remark has now appeared in at least four successive
reports, and is beginning to grow wearisome. And The
Bulletin again suggests, as a simple solution, that the
Royal should write-off its accumulated balance of £19,447
as an instalment, at all events, and put the remainder of
the losses to the debit of profit and loss or to suspense
account, and so put things as straight as it can, in the
meantime. Surely the shareholders have a right to know
how they stand.
* * * *
The Union Trustee Co. of Melbourne has
decided not to pay any dividend this half-year. The net
profits for the 12 months are only £555, against £3648 last
year, and £2797 the one before, which is a very depressim* 1
state of things. The co. has £67,000 of its own money
invested (£12,420 in 4 per cent, debentures, £22,400 in 3i
per cent, debentures, £32,451 on mortgage, and the
balance on fixed deposit), and the interest totals about
£2970, estimating the mortgages at only 5 per cent.
Therefore it would seem that this year the trustee business
has been a dead loss of £2400 ; and the last two years, on
an average, it paid just a shade over working expenses.
The trustee business, in short, has been overdone in Mel-
bourne, where five companies are trying to live on an in-
dustry which, in Sydney, only manages to support two. In
August last the Union Trustee Co. rashly paid an interim
dividend of 2 per cent, which absorbed £1476, or
fully 800 more than the year’s net earnings, therefore
the balance to credit of profit and loss is reduced from
£2583 to £1662 as the result of a year’s work. The Union
Co., though it has been about 11 years in existence, has
no reserve fund; its shares (20s. paid-up) are selling
at about 6s. 6d. ; and its profits for the past year (which
amount to a little over 15s. per cent.) are not calculated to
make a, boom. There are no shady-looking features
in the balance-sheet; liberal reserves have been made
against possible losses, and apparently the co. is sound
and well-managed. The only trouble is a great deal too
much trustee co. in proportion to population.
* * * *
Russell-Jones, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), has a Bill on
hand providing for the absolute protection of life-insur-
ance policies from creditors, with the limitation that, if
the assured goes bankrupt or dies within three years after
insuring, the creditors shall have a lien on the' policy for
the amount of the premiums paid with 6 per cent, in-
terest. Tiie Bulletin strongly recommends that this last
proviso be cut out, and the Bill be made to read simply
that all policies up to £5OOO, and on which the premium
is payable quarterly, half-yearly, or annually, be abso-
lutely protected from everybody. It is impossible to pro-
tect all policies for any amount, else the prospective
insolvent might take out an endowment on his own life
tor £50,000, pay down the premium out of his creditors’
money in one lump of £25,000 or so, and then go broke
with this comfortable nest-egg put away, but the £5OOO
limit with the above proviso seems good enough. The
proposal of Jones, M.L.A., will, in many cases, defeat
itself. If a man goes insolvent three years after insuring
tor, say, £lOOO (premium, say, £4O annually), what
amount of protection is it which makes him owe £l2O and
£l4 Bs. interest on a policy whose present cash-value is
probably £6O ? At that rate, it would be £7B Bs. cheaper
lor , , ® protected one if the creditors seized the policy
and left him to start a fresh assurance.

Melbourne Argus says, regarding certain
recent bank-smashes, that no criminality attached
to any of the directors, because none of them
feathered their own nests with the vanished assets
Which is ridiculously bad logic, whether these particular
directors were criminal or not. First, no man knows
whether another man has feathered his own nest or not.
Second, if a man takes money he shouldn’t have taken,
the fact that he lost it afterwards in foolish speculations
doesn’t alter the case at all. If a clerk embezzles £lOO
from his employer, what difference does it make whether
he puts it in the savings-bank or “ blews ” it on a horse-
race? Does anyone ever claim that the embezzling clerk
isn’t criminal because he lost the money ? The directors
in question may have been honest enough in their inten-
tions, but, if the Argus supports them much longer in
this fashion, they won’t look like it.

N.S.W. Govt., after much inexplicable delay
and shuffling, is at last refunding the civil-servants the
amounts of their contributions to the Superannuation
Fund. This refers only to those who resigned since the
Act was amended, i e., at the beginning of this year.
Those who resigned before then cannot claim, and won’t
get a solitary copper. Those who still continue in the
service are permitted, under the amended Act, to cease
contributing to the Fund ii they feel so inclined. Many
have felt that way, and have withdrawn, with thanks,
from a fund in which they never knew exactly how they
stood for two consecutive days. But, all the same, those
who have withdrawn find that they are not entitled to a
refund of their money until they resign, when, they are
informed, they can claim the total amount of their con-
tributions, with 3 p.c. added—the interest, though, to be
calculated only from the beginning of this year.

Much of the legal aspect of the Mirams libel-
case hano-s round the meaning of the phrase “ to play
ducks and drakes.” The Slang Dictionary and sundry
copies of the “ Notes and Queries” have been searched
on the subject. Webster gives a good definition also :
“ To play at ducks and drakes with property—to throw it
away heedlessly or squander it foolishly and unpro-
fltably.”

The secretary of the Vie. Customs has received
a report from the inspector of drawbacks re a statement
copied by the London Citizen (without acknowledgment)
from the disreputable Bulletin. The report in question
practically confirms the truth of this beastly journal’s
much-quoted paragraph. The inspector says : “There is
no doubt that advantage has been taken by merchants of
the reduced rates of duty which have recently come into
operation to ship considerable quantities of old stock, in
order to obtain drawback on the old rates, but I know of
no instance in which goods have been shipped for draw-
back which have become useless or rotten, or since the
present regulations, of ‘ less value for house use than the
amount of drawback claimed ’ ; but, previous to that, it
had been the practice for some time, though not in ac-
cordance with the Act, to allow exporters (more particu-
larly soft-goods merchants) to obtain drawback on articles-
which have been found unsaleable at the end of a season,
at a price equal to the amount of duty originally paid.
As on goods not sold, but shipped for the supply of a
branch house, obviously only the full amount of duty
paid can be claimed, and the original invoice stamped by
a landing-waiter must be produced, I fail to see how the
assertion that invoices are ‘shockingly untruthful’ can
apply.” But The Bulletin doesn’t fail to see that old,
decrepit goods can he adapted to the requirements of an
original invoice that referred to quite a different lot. To
the Customs swindles of the psalm-singing soft-goods trade
there is no end.

Dear Bulletin, —You say it is illogical to assume
that the counterfeit-silver-coinage trouble is just begin-
ning. It is a recent trouble, because the slump in silver
is recent. Last week’s letter assumes that profitable
counterfeiting can be done while silver remains below 40
pence per ounce —leaving a minimum of 16 pence per
ounce for expenses and profit. Silver never got below 40
pence till 1892, when it averaged 39 13-16, in 1893 it was
35%, in 1894 it dropped to 29, and it would be about 30
for 1895. This indicates a period of four years to conceive,
develop, and carry out a big swindle necessitating secrecy,
study, and organisation.—M. [The conception probably
occupied thirty seconds. Secresy doesn’t occupy much
time. Any man who had ever worked in a mint had all

“ I visited Bayley’s the other day,” says a Bul-

morning, and the walk to the mine, about a mile from the
P. 0., was delightful, although one missed the foliage and
bird-life of most other parts of Australia. At the mine,
everything was quiet as the grave, the claim having been
shutdown for some time. The externals—the battery,
machinery, buildings—are on the most lavish scale;
fine draught horses are feeding quietly in the stable on
the best of hay, and the manager’s fowls, clucking about
his well-built and neat homestead, are as good as money
can purchase. Bayley’s seems to have everything a mine
should possess, except—gold.”

The London Mount Morgan people, D’Arcy,
Tom Hall, &c., have formed a syndicate for the purpose of
dealing in Australian mines. Their first operation, the
floating of the Mount Ferruin (W.A.) mine, was a tremen-
dous success, the thing being fairly rushed. Though a
great many of the companies lately advertised have gone
to allotment, the public (writes The Bulletin’s corres-
pondent) has been chary of taking a hand, and the under-
writing co's have been stuck lo the extent of 90 per cent.
It is time they began to disgorge their unholy gains, for
they had a good innings when first the Westralian boom
set in. When are the long-expected Westralian divs.
coming ? A few good declarations would be most welcome
just now, as everyone is predicting a revival of interest in
mining, which only needs the stimulus of a few divs. to
set it going. But there will be an awful shaking-out in
connection with the countless bubble co’s floated in
London.
* * * «
A most reliable mining anatomist —and from his
characteristic letter many will identify him—writes from
Kalgoorlie to The Bulletin : —“ I was down to see the
bottom development in the Boulder. They had driven
on a footwall stringer, and had to cross-cut 15 feet to the
reef which they had followed from the 150 ft. level in a
winze. The reef is about 12ft. wide, and similar material
to that mined at the 150 ft. level. They would not let me
sample it, but I could see it was being sent to the mill.
Lake View has also cut the lode at 200 ft., where it was
the full width of the shaft, and the manager told me it
sampled from 3oz. to 6oz. In both mines the reef in the
lower levels is living in the hard country, and I do not
think either will cut out; but the soft nature of the lode
material may change at any time to hard, and then the
question if the gold lives with depth will be settled. In
the Brown Hill, the vein formation continues in depth,
but it is hard and compact, with a large percentage of fine
sulphides and no gold. It is claimed that the shoot of ore
is south of the present lower developments.”
“ All the other mines on the south end which
have been developed have the same character of reefs.
You can notice by their workings that they have a fear of
the mines in depth. In the Boulder Main Reef, in par-
ticular, the shaft is 90ft. deep, but the lode is opened up
at 60ft., and shows a fine body of ore for several hundred
feet. I understand this has been opened some time, but
they have not put down a winze, which, I should say,
would suggest itself, as the vein-formation is soft and easy
sinking ground.
“The milling plants, and their lame attempts
to get a supply of water, together with a lack of
developments in depth, go to show that the Australian
owners are out for a sale of stock this summer in the
London market.
“I have an idea that the mines will live at
depth, but the shoots of ore will be shorter. However
that may be, there is no question as to the wonderful
developments of high-grade ore near the surface, and, if
the owners were half as good miners as the reefs are good
mines, the country, or rather the district, would be
further advanced, and be in a position to produce large
returns this winter.
“ The Brown Hill mill is not a big success. It
consists of two ore-crushers and a large set of rolls, by
which it was proposed to reduce the ore to a fineness or
40 mesh. From the rolls it is conveyed to a bin, thence
to an amalgamating barrel, revolved for two hours with a
light solution of cyanide and a charge of quicksilver,
thence the pulp passes over quicksilver traps to recover
the quicksilver and amalgam, and the pulp is run into
vats for cyanide. The original plan called for amalgama-
tion copper plates in the barrels to recover the coarse
gold, but these have been discarded. The fact that they
have no settlers after the barrels to regain the quicksilver
I believe will cause trouble. From trial tests they have
recovered up to 87 per cent, on lOoz. ore by the barrel and
light solution of cyanide. The oil engines I understand
have so far given satisfaction, but their crushing plant is
working very badly, yet it cannot be said they have had a
really fair test.
“ On the north end of the district, outside of
Hannan’s Reward, there is no improvement except that
they have the same small rich stringers and big lodes of
decomposed formation with stringers of quartz, which in
its decomposed state, may give 8 or l(klwts. per to
TTunmn’s Reward may be a good mine, but I fear it will
prove at the 300 ft. a large mass of diorite and stringers of
nuartz All who have visited Menzies speak well of it,
but no one is allowed to examine the bottom levels

quiet. The old story—too much white quartz^

Adelaide Quiz- “If the Great Boulder mine

Geraldton Express prints these sickening
things about the Nor’-West (W.A.) shows : “That much
advertised claim, ‘ The Nicholl,’ filled her shaft with
water ; and the small 6in. pump was totally unable to
cope with it, the water gaining 2ft. per shift. Conse-
quently all work is suspended. This was one of Bounder
Calvert’s flotations for £BO,OOO. Poor shareholders, their
chances are nix, and if they are wise they will consider
first loss the best, and let the squatter have a good water-
hole and be done with it. For gold in the stone on the
heap, no sane man would look ; there is not ldwt. to the
acre. At Pilbarra, the Great Broken Hill, which was to
go lOoz. for certain (that was before the battery arrived),
goes less pennyweights ; but, since it is all rubble, it may
pay, if wages come down to Chinkee price. The state of
Marble Bar is very precarious, the Stray Shot being the
only likely good thing tlfere at present, while such claims
as the Ironclad and the Augusta will shortly be forgotten.
At Bamboo, the Bulletin continues to give good returns,
250 tons averaging 3oz. to the ton, which is the best the
Nor’-West can yet show. Jowraima, which was going to
eclipse all predecessors by the marvellous returns from
the Yellow Aster group, is under partial exemptions, to
give the Bounding Prophet Calvert a chance to float it on
the London market. The Brilliant Corporation and
the Corporation Extended have been abandoned, and the
English capitalist is left again.”

Kalgoorlie: “The Mayor, Aid. Wilson, left

vestor. Wilson will probauiy find that it is beginning to
dawn on the Britisher that he had better wait till the dis-
trict asserts its own richness.

At last! “A lode, 30ft. wide, has been passed

to mend.

Another rich strike made in the Croesus mine at
Hannan’s. This makes at least 50 rich finds in two years,
and as it only has had one or two crushings the pur-
chasing English Co., which continues to put up deposits,
should complete the deal and pay itself back by
dollying out the great hunks of gold lying promiscuously
about the mine, and with the balance pay some big divs.
After that it would be a good idea to get some more gold
out of the mine.

Wired that Fitzgerald Moore, of “Advance”

which stands up out of the lake, and every stone napped
displayed gold. The show was purchased from Messrs.
Seftoii and party by the City of London Exploration Co.
for £50,000.” It is hard to imagine the astute Mr. 800
Sefton, who has “been there” so often, selling a moun-
tain which napped gold everywhere for a paltry 50 thou.

E.D. : “A recent Wild Cat par. asserts: ‘ln
nine cases out of ten, a manager leaving a mine is prima
facie evidence that it should be left by the shareholders
as well.’ Perhaps—when the manager leaves voluntarily;
but my experience teaches that in nine cases out of ten
when a manager leaves a mine, it is because a director up
town wants to put his wife’s cousin on in his place, or
because the manager is a man of grit, and refuses to find
a job in the face for some yahoo who doesn’t know a pick
from a drill, but who is a constituent of a political direc-
tor ; or because he has presumed to correct the impression
of the bombastic director that the underlay has something
to do with the bob-pit. Anyhow, nine cases out of ten,
it is through the fatuous meddlesomeness of the chuckle-
headed city mining man, who has acquired his experience
in the bacon-trade or peddling scrip. Directors of mines
are usually appointed for the reason that would induce
people to set Esquimaux growing orchids —because they
know nothing whatever about the business.”
Again the old contrast between Bunda-
berg and Mackay. Bundaberg, in Glassey’s
victory, emphasised a preference for the cause of
white Queensland and Democracy. Mackay
meekly returned the Boodlewraithian representa-
tives, and took the Kanaka, the Jap., the Chow
and all the leprous crew once more to its foetid
bosom. The Bundaberg victory is mainly due to
the fact that the little town possesses some of the
most ardent Rads and Labor propagandists in all
Queensland. Two or three men, by constant
endeavor and sacrifice, have made possible the
recent victory.
Constable Gordon, of Bendigo, probably
regrets the hour when he got married. The other
day a farmer named Northby wrote to Mrs.
Gordon imploring her to elope w ith him, and
Gordon—reckoning this a chance to n:a ;e a capture
and achieve promotion in the foorce—sent back a
telegram in his wife’s name,-asking giddy Northby
to call at the house after dark. When Northby,
full of sinful hope, came up toscratch, the ingenious
husband beat him brutally and dragged him into
custody for having unlawfully been on his
(Gordon’s) premises. It was a very scriking in-
stance of a policeman’s belief in his special licence
to do as he damn well pleases when he feels
aggrieved. However, thecase against farmer North-
by, who endured one broken nose and innumer-
able bruises, was dismissed. The constable is the
underneath dawg just now. He will take his trial
for assault and robbery, the allegation being that
he “ shook ” from the pocket of his wife’s damaged
admirer a sum of =£7B, which the amorous fellow
had brought along for elopement purposes. The
case is unique. Supposing that a husband does
so take money, is it a vulgar theft or a virtuous
transaction in defence of his wife’s “ honor ’’ ? A
man who has been cleaned out can’t conveniently
elope with a woman, anyway. Also, she, for her
part, loses all desire to roam if her lawful husband
lays hold upon the other fellow’s capital. Money
is a powerful persuader. It can either make the
mare to go astray, or tempt her to remain in the
stable.
The one subject for discussion in Sydney
at time of writing was whether Premier Reid did
the square and honorable and gentlemanly thing
in visiting Parkes on what looked then like his
death-bed, and condoling with him. The sight of
Reid was probably more likely to inflame Parkes
—if the old, ear-chewing warrior was in anything
like his usual fighting condition—and fill him with
smothered rage than the sight of any other man on
this earth, and the visit was calculated either to
hasten the old man’s death or else to rouse him tc
a desperate resolve to recover and do something
dreadful. Also, as Parkes was helpless at the
time, and too weak even to use violent language,
he couldn’t very well eject or shoo away Reid,
eaen if he wished to, so the situation was
somewhat like that of the hangman who first
ties up his victim so that he can’t stoush
him or kick him, and puts the white cap on his
head, so that he can’t see to butt, and then
proceeds to shake hands with him. On the
other hand, if Reid hadn’t visited Parkes,
and Parkes had died, the genial, fuzzy man with
the eye-glass would have been taunted ever after-
wards with being unable to forgive his enemy,
even on his deathbed. He might, indeed, have
struck a middle course by leaving his card surrep-
titiously at the front door, but that would have
looked as if he didn’t want to say anything kind
to his opponent, and preferred merely to stand off
and infuriate him by reminding him that he (Reid)
was alive and well, and in possession of Parkes’
beloved old billet and enjoying himself thoroughly,
while his predecessor was sick and stone-broke
and altogether down in the world. On the whole,
there is room for an interesting debate on the
question : What should Reid have done when
Parkes was ill in order to show good-feeling and
yet give Parkes a decent chance to recover ?

A brilliant suggestion for the re-naming of
South Australia comes from Lieut.-Colonel Ber-
gusson. This loyal warrior thinks that the province
should adopt the title of Kingsland for two reasons.
H would not only balance well with Queensland,
but would recall the fact that the colony was
founded in the reign of King William the Fourth,
after whose Queen its fair capital was named.”
I ergusson overlooks one important point. ‘ ‘ Kings-
land ” would become a vague, uncertain term as
time went on; its historical significance would
fadeaway, so to speak. Now William IY. was
popularly known as Silly Billy, and a billy is an
article of everyday Australian use. Why not con-
vert South Australia into Sillybillyland, thus
emphasising the appropriateness of its capital
city’s nomenclature ?

After church service, H.E. mounted his fiery steed

held on his extraordinary pith helmet, while the
other grasped the reins, and the tails of his clerical-
looking coat streamed aft in the wind. Every-
where he flew guards turned out, much to the dis-
comfiture of the local Tommy Atkins, who was
feeding at the time. A.D.C. Shaftesbury contem-

Lady G., fair, fat, and forty, ought to cut a com-

The Sunbeam averaged six miles an hour
between Gabo Island and Wilson s Promontory on
her return voyage from Sydney. But a few hours
extra on the quarter-deck make very little differ-
ence in Brassey’s ease. As a Governor h.e is mostly
at sea when he gets ashore.

The members of an inland municipal ooun

other day, were about to retire, when one of their
number approached H.E. and said, “ A moment,
please,” at the same time pulling from under his

picked this for Lady Lamantongue. Tell her to
send a bit of writing, to acknowledge it, and I’ll

than ever she did before. But why didn’t Meston

Vice-Chancellor M‘Laurin’s speech, at
to be delivered without interruption.
Writes*a Sydney University man*:—
The trouble between the Senate and the students of the
University is amusing enough, but, with double murders
and sensational suicides to hand, the daily papers need
hardly have given it such prominence. The Senate, how-
ever, has really only itself to blame. When, in the past,
the noise and interruptions became disgracefully promi-
, me authorities did not put a peremptory stop to the
display of hoodlumism. Instead, they suggested to that
committee which they now refuse to recognise that
?° n £ s should be arranged by the students. The
idea was that concentrated, organised noise would
be better than scattered interruption. They not only
countenanced the singing of songs but actually encour-
aged it. They found a place for the songs on the othcial
programme and even consulted the students a ‘
positions on the programme they would like for t
songs. Having made this compromise, degrad ng as it
was, they can hardly expect that the students wi q -
allow them to stop the disturbance which they
hitherto fostered. One effect of the noise at Co
ration was to do away with the speech by the Chancellor.
For many years this speech has been pnnted jiiit not
delivered'. But this year the absence of Judge W indejer
gave the Vice-Chancellor an opportunity of which ne was
determined to avail himself.
BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION.
BENEVOLENT OLD HUBBY : “ Dear, dear, look
at that poor young thing. Isn’t marriage
a terrible lottery?”
PRETTY YOUNG WIFE : “It is—so very few of
us can hope to be widows at thirty !”
When Gov. Smith visited Coolgardie, dur-
ing the great railway-drunk-celebration, the
Afghan residents presented him with a camel.
That aggravating animal smells very much like a
stale football which has been left in the sink for
three weeks, and it is also a loud, fretful, bad-
tempered beast, which will want to bite the Smith
family at the first opportunity, and probably Gov.
Smith doesn’t want to go about Perth on a camel,
for fear of rousing the small boys of the neighbor-
hood. But, being a Governor, it is his business
to smile under all circumstances, so he accepted
the hairy incubus and went for a ride on it, and
got so severely concussed that he probably won’t
feel quite the same Smith for a long time. He
also offered up Lady Smith as a sacrifice by bump-
ing her round the town on the animal; and that
bruised and aching lady expressed her gratitude.
Some of the things that a Governor’s wife has to
look as if she was grateful for are pretty hard
things.

AN APPLICATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the great storm in Melbourne, the other Sunday, a
young woman, while running for shelter to a church, was
killed by the fall of a hoarding. Her name was Love.
Melb.
So, while we live,
Come storm and stress
With suddenness,
Nor warning give ;
And in the whirlwind even
Love
Is overtaken.
And Faith, grown weak,
Storm-driven fails
At altar-rails,
A port to seek,
And seeing only clouds above
Is rudely shaken.
But though the sky
Breathe storm and stress
With suddenness,
Love cannot die ;
The earthly death is but the
portal
To Life immortal.

Acting - Judge Rogers, while
hearing a N.S.W. criminal case the
other day, stopped to send for some
cough-lozenges for a juror with a bad
cold. When the juror had solemnly
munched them, and announced that
he felt “ much better, thanks,” the
case proceeded. There are many ill-
nesses that disturb the course of
N.S.W. justice, and it’s a pity that
J udge Rogers can’t be made Supreme
Court physician -in - ordinary. A
little prescription from him for a fel-
low-judge’s liver, or for an uncon-
scious bias derived from a deranged
kidney, or for a tendency to hang-
by-the-neck-till-dead caused by a
slight lesion in the left cerebral
hemisphere, might be productive of
the very best results.

The other day Q. Govt, ukased
that the “ walk-about Kanaka ” —the
slave who tires of his bondage at the
expiry of his agreement, and “ walks
about ” for a holiday, keeping up
the market price of his labor—must
go to work after one month or go to
gaol. The planters fondly hoped that
this ruse would make the “ boys ” who
held out for .£1 a week come pleading
for ss. ; but the boys, developing un-
expected spirit and dignity, vow they
will sooner go home to their islands.
A large number of “ cheap and reli-
ables ” left Bundaberg per Rio Loge
the other day, and many more are
waiting to go by the Helena. And
“ the sugar industry is being ruined ”
once more, because it really looks as
if the planters would have to employ
a few whites at 15s. a week—poor
whites ! —for six months of the year.

At the big Melb. anti-sweating

vantages of a fine voice and a striking
presence, and at times he has a melo-
dramatic touch that reaches the mil-
lion. Champion deals out excellent
material, and does not hesitate to
sting his audience, but he lacks fire-
works. The Dismal Jimmy of the
meeting was a Ballarat delegate—a
prattling parson who gassed limply for half-an-
hour and bored the meeting to the verge of frenzy
with personal prosing and “miner” details,
“ Beware of parsons ! ” is a good motto for persons
arranging such meetings.

George William Down, a Sydney butcher
suicided last week by jumping over South Head
cliff Next day his wife s body was found at
Kerosene Bay, with the throat cut. The pair had
lived unhappily, and Down had been m gaol for
assaulting her, but she visited lnm regularly
during his imprisonment. The woman was no
doubt murdered by her husband- anyhow she was
murdered, for when did a woman commit suicide
by throat-cutting ? Down was 60 years old and Ins
wife wasn’t. She was a woman with attractive
eyes and a beautiful head of hair, and, like him,
she drank occasionally. «
Down was a disappointing individual. When
the tragedy was first reported it was announced
that he was heir to <£60,000, which vaguely sug-
gested that he was tall and young and adorned
with a beautiful moustache like an heir in the
Family Herald ; also, that he drove to South
Head in a cab and gave all his money to the cab-
man —which had a lordly sound about it—before
he threw himself over. People pictured him as
the stately hero out of the London J ournal, who,
being disappointed in love, threw a bag of gold to
the cabby and disappeared in a poetic fashion over
the cliff. Then it gradually transpired that he
was a retired sausage-man who used to fight
desperately with his wife in a cheap boarding-
house, and that his expectations only amounted to
<£4ooo, and that he was a common, violent, three-
penny-beer person with no special picturesqueness
about him at all. The last time he and his wife
were seen together she was removing him out of a
pub. because they had to go and look for new
lodgings, having got notice to quit for dragging
each other round the old lodgings by the hair. The
more or less demented sausage-man seems to have
sawn his wife’s throat suddenly in the midst of
the search for new lodgings.

Nothing new under the sun. It is re-
marked, as a wonder, in Melb., that a woman
claiming to be a qualified seafaring person has
applied for a mate’s certificate. Mrs. Taylor’s
book on navigation is a standard, and she com-
manded a ship for many voyages.
* * * *
That enterprising young woman who
wanted to be examined for a second mate’s certifi-
cate hadn’t a sea-leg to stand on, because she’d
have had to pass in practical seamanship—involv-
ing a knowledge of work aloft, where it doesn’t
appear she’d ever been. Also, if, as she threatens,
she attempts to obtain the certificate as a man,
she will have touched the law at two points
making a false declaration and wearing “ drag.”
Disguised female foremasters there have been,
and will be; but the Brute will still keep the
quarterdeck for himself.

Sydney, April 21, 1896.
My Dear Moorabinda —
If the numberless engagements and rumors of
engagements credited to a certain well-known
handsome society girl now having the necessary
clothes made in which to really and truly face the
matrimonial music, and no shilly-shally—if these
alleged conquests have any real foundation, the
happy man must feel something like Mrs. Blue-
beard felt when she peeped in and saw all the
scalps. Evidently the bouncing damsel regards
the aforesaid scalps in a philosophical light, for
the new “ engage,” which threatens to end in a
gold hoop, was in the air a few days after the
demise of one youth who looked all over a favorite
for a whole season. However, it really seems that
the lady is suited at last.
Pretty Grace Palotta hasn’t been lost in London,
but was playing at the Gaiety Theatre in the
“Shop Girl,” taking the part of Lady Dodo, as
she did here, and singing the same song, “Over
the Hills.” Palotta also took part in “All
Abroad,” in which she had a song, “ The Business
Girl, ” when she changed her dress four times in
full view of the audience, winding-up as a be-
witching “ boy,” in a pale-blue satin suit. From a
Gaiety co. standpoint, pale-blue satin pants are
very promising things in which to ascend the
ladder of fame, and may be regarded as a flag of
triumph, metaphorically speaking. Writing to a
Sydney friend, Miss Palotta enthuses over
blonde Ethel Haydon as one of the prettiest and
most charming of girls. Judging by Miss
Palotta’s letter, that Sydney pressman’s chance
looks brighter. “ Madge Rossel and I often talk
of the good times we had in Australia, and hope
they will return some day.”
High-toned damsels voyaging to Australia per
gilded mail-boat often get their finer feelings
grievously wrenched and their inherent decollet-
age, as it were, seriously trampled upon by the
lucky Coolgardians who come aboard at Westralia,
and who never have their willie-wagtails along,
but dine in large checks, flannel shirts and
other abominations. They generally get a table
to themselves far from the bare collar-bones and
boiled shirts of the society elemeilt, who exchange
looks of petrified astonishment and reach out for
their scent-bottles.
But it was left to an Australienne recently en
route from London, where she had got the indis-
pensable amount of British rudeness top-thatched
over her education, to really put these dreadful
creatures in their right place. A party of more or
less lucky Coolgardians of good class boarded the
steamer. They had no dress clothes, but they
kept to themselves at a table as usual, and after
dinner one of them struck a few home-sick chords
on the piano. This was the last straw to their
compatriot, who, at the sight of a serge suit on
a piano-stool after 9 p.m., was overcome by her
outraged feelings. She rose abruptly. “Ai shall
never touch the piano again after those Coolgardie
savages,” she said, indignantly, and swept scorn-
fully to her cabin. However, one of the savages
got even with the lady at the end of the journey
by proposing a clever toast which everybody
listened to and understood, while the damsel
turned every color in the beet-root family.
I believe there are certain sceptics who profess
to believe that the New Woman is merely the
Mrs. ’Arris of journalisin, and has no local habi-
tation, despite the bloomers in the shop windows,
the cigarette-smoking females on the walls, and the
bicycle. But surely they must swallow her now
when, in Victoria, she is applying for the position
of mate, and threatening to dress up as a man
and go ’Ome to get her certificate and end as a
captain, so there.
I have often wondered why the new female
didnk tackle the sea long ago, if only for the gold
buttons on the captain’s costiime, and his undis-
puted right to have the last word and go on the
bridge whenever he likes, and pick and choose the
company at his end of the table. A lawyer once
told me that, in Equity, sailors, women, and
lunatics are all classed together, and are dealt
gently with, as more or less irresponsible persons ;
so it looks as if the newest woman in Victoria has
a good case in trying to turn into a sailor, with
whom she is already on equal terms legally. She
can also turn into a lunatic at the same time, if
she likes. But bloomers should be insisted upon.
A company of amateurs is putting up “H.M.S.
Pinafore ” at Sydney Gaiety on April 29th and
May 2nd, in aid of the funds of the North Shore
Hospital. There are rumors that Gov. Hampden
will be present on one evening, and, as the ama-
teurs in question play ‘ ‘ Pinafore ” smartly and
have done it all before, the performances will,
doubtless, result in a big hat.
A young lady rose in the east in Sydney recently
and gave a piano-recital “ prior to her departure
for England.” She seemed to be an excellent
pupil, but her fireworks were scarcely brilliant
enough to justify her going ’Ome on them. But,
then, everybody who has a mere liking for any of
the arts rushes Europewards to aggravate it and
tease it until, after many weary years, it ends in a
big brass plate and one small pupil. Piccadilly,
alas, is paved with brilliant pianists, who will play
you a dozen sdjiatas and a fugue thrown in almost
for a square ineal. So say the long-haired men
who try to live by art in Sydney.
Bland Holt’s new leading woman, Miss Eliza-
beth Watson, is very like her sister Henrietta,
though not so swan-necked and nothing like so
good an actress. Her taste in dress is not so un-
usual, and there is much more method in her mil-
linery. In “ One of the Best ” she wears a stylish
green gown with black points and her neck bare
(bare necks would seem to run in that family).
Then a smart yellow satin gown with brocade
shoulder-flaps and frill sleeves of yellow chiffon ;
then a Quaker gown of grey; and lastly broad
black and white stripes, black and white hat en
suite, and a fluffy parasol. The other new Thes-
pienne, Miss Prances Ross, wears her chestnut
hair over her ears, and is a gracefully pretty woman
with good taste in dress and a voice that cracks
under emotional pressure. Miss Ross plays the
grig aspect of Mary Penrose admirably, but her
appeal to the Court-Martial to spare Walter
Baker wouldn’t have moved the heart of a nurse-
girl. It must be rather awful to be born an
ingenue and know that you must giggle and flip a
lace handkerchief down the theatrical years if you
want to be a success.
A soothing thing about “One of the Best” is
that you see more of the Bland Holts in it than
/anybody ever saw before—more of Mrs. Holt, at
least, for the genial Bland, in kilts, doesn’t come
within coo-ee of the rose-pink Bland, simply
draped in a bath-towel, whom Mrs. Holt discovers,
bathing, in the “Ratal Card.” But Mrs. Holt in
knickers is a pleasing revelation—from a front
view, anyhow. “ One of the Best ”is a coherent
and probable play, and, if only Cosgrove’s hair
wouldn’t lie down so aggressively and refuse to
arise even in a struggle, it would be difficult to
find fault with the gorgeous and lavish production.
“ One of the Best ” certainly is a “ cleamy ” play,
as Saturday’s programmes admitted. I have no
idea what sort of a play a ‘ ‘ cleamy ” play is—but
it is always safest to agree with the management.
The “Djin-Djin ” matinee last Saturday had a
tight-fit audience, and travelled from 2 to 5 with
the smoothness begotten of three weeks’ run.
There is no dust on the hem of Djin-Djin’s gar-
ments so far, and, while the golden ballet con-
tinues to look like new pins, and no harm comes
to Miss Young’s legs, there is no telling when the
large scintillating production will pull up. By the
way, Plo. Young ought to cork her speaking
visage and reduce her wardrobe if she really wants
to look like Prince Eucalyptus. All the royalties
of Australia are as black as the ace of spades, and
wear a great deal less than even Miss Young does.
A convincing Prince Eucalyptus who would bring
Flora Graupner to grass with a boomerang, and
feed her with raw ’possum out of a dilly-bag,
would lend much variety to the dazzling scene
when the paint begins to wear off.
A praiseworthy point about Mrs. Brough’s
Fedora was that she had not forgotten the dress-
maker, for the long-tailed wardrobe of the latest
version suffered nothing by comparison with other
Fedoras, and was miles ahead of the gaudy,
trumpery things Achurch had a fashion of ban-
daging her figure in. In the first act a paletot of
brocade with deep hems of sable and black velvet
sleeves was thrown off to show an ivory brocade
with bodice of shot tobacco-brown silk. In the
second a • very artful mingling of heliotrope
brocade and black, the bodice criss-crossed in
black jet lines ; in the third, a sallow tea-
gown with suggestions of green jet ; and in
the fourth frock Mrs. Brough looked best
of all —it was black silk broken up with
gold-spangled passementerie. In this stagily-
effective frock, with her golden hair a-hanging
down her back, I thought Mrs. Brough (all
through “Fedora” one never forgot it was Mrs.
Brough) looked her very best. Miss Faber, as
Countess Olga, wore a most killing brown hat in
the last act, and was otherwise modishly arrayed,
but some of the Countess’s he-friends ought to
have taken the precaution of mangling their
obviously-borrowed dress-clothes before coming
on. One youth especially was an ocean of
wrinkles—he really looked as if father’s pants did
not fit Johnny. Otherwise the “ Fedora ” staging
left nothing to be desired —except that Cecil Ward
had painted his face so red that he looked like a
candidate for Echo Farm.
Gov. and Lady Lamington,
potentates, are the most juvenile V.R. couple in
Australia, and quite a romantic interest attaches
to them, as they haven’t been married a year yet.
His Ex. is said to be tall and slight and very
young, but he doesn’t seem too young to know the
hanky-panky of the governing business. His
sympathetic visit to the poor people crushed under
an awning while waiting to see him pass was
worthy of ex-Govemor Carington. On dit that
Lady Lamington’s millinery is astonishing
Northern society, which usually dresses itself as if
it had every intention of ultimately paying the bill.
An awkward contretemps occurred on Gov.
Hampden’s arrival at Bathurst for the Show last
week. The V.R. train was half-an-hour before its
time—which was a new experience for Lord
Hampden, at any rate, who is more accustomed to
being after than before his appointment. Gov.
Hampden’s engine-driver got him there too soon,
and the consequence was that H.E. and suite were
left hanging about the station like empty poultry
crates until somebody alarmed a local potentate or
two. I hear that the Mayor has been apologising
ever since.
Gov. Hampden’s small son is said to be a paragon
among little boys, and a pattern to every urchin
in the land. He was allowed to go one Sunday
for a spin with a Sydney yachtsman, and when
the craft came to anchor the hos i j, on
there was too much gold-top and gold •
board one or two neighboring sailing-boats tor a
youth to be allowed to comprehen » he found
V.R. cherub below. Coming down later, hefound
him dutifully reading a prayer-book. If that boy
doesn’t look out, he will find himself the heio ot a
Sunday-school tract.
On Saturday ending Easter week, a Sydney
daily paper commented on the fact that neither
muslcf painting, nor the drama had been honored
at any of the Easter Government-House festnMms.
No doubt it was merely a coincidence that on
Monday invitations to the Governor s ball on the
following evening were marked urgent, ana
issued to members of the precessions, many o
whom attended the “ hop ” and partook ot Mis
Excellency’s hospitality. A much-bediamonded
gentleman from Poland voiced the feeling of the
assembly when he breathed in an audible whisper,
“ Vot a fine program ve could fix up if everybody
gave a turn. ”
Ed. Pinaud’s “Sapho” brand of perfumery is
the most successful superfluity of the age, so I was
pleased to receive from M. Moreau, the sole agent
in Australia, a delicious assortment of reviving
perfumes, “ sels Sapho ” warranted to cure Show-
ground and Art Gallery headaches in one sniff,
and smooth “Sapho” soap, all artistically done
up in floral caskets. The handsome way these
perfumes are arranged makes them an ornamental
adjunct to the- best regulated toilet-tables and
their fragrance .is flower-like.
One of two ladies, who had availed themselves
of the opportunity of inspecting the Sunbeam, was
heard to remark, when, leaving, “ What a wonder
Lord Brassey hasn’t a .billiard-table on board !
University Commemoration day without the
students seems something like limelight without
Rignold ; but it really was time the Senate put its
foot on wit and humor which seldom passed the
primitive stage of farmyard noises.
Miss Alice Muskett, the clever young Sydney
artist now sojourning in the Latin quarter of
Paris, has just had a picture accepted at the Salon.
Considering the sheet-time Miss Muskett has been
away from her native heath —she is Victorian-
born, by the way —this success speaks volumes for
the preliminary training she received in Aus-
tralia.
At Poverty Point.
Marie Elster scores a point in England by informing her
interviewers that she succeeded Frances Saville as Mar-
jorie at Melb. Princess’s. Frances Saville has made a big
name, and Elster is evidently coming on fast.
The first night of “Fbdora” at Sydney Criterion was
graced by the presence of Premier Reid, who flirted most
audaciously with his wife in a box.
The English Lord Chamberlain, in refusing to license
“ Joseph of Canaan,” was probably thinking of Mrs.
Potiphar.
Haresfoot : “ Williamson would always be a high-class
actor, if not great, his only lack being that purely natural
soul pathos, which marks Jefferson’s Caleb Plummer, and
is absent from Toole’s. Williamson’s Stofel deteriorated
through the necessity of coming down to the audience,
which weighs with every player. His Rip Van Winkle
was singularly creditable as an original study, while other
actors were under Jefferson’s thrall. In Kerry he was
quite perfect.”
Dampier’s first three nights in Bendigo (Vic.) averaged
£l5B a night. Record provincial business !
Pro. : Your sketch of J. C. Williamson omits to
mention the actor-manager’s “first appearance” on the
stage. It was in an Indian drama, “The Jibbernanisy,”
a thorough theatrical “ dime novel.” Therein young
Williamson played Little Tom Bruce, a “ one line ” part.
This “ first appearance ” was without his guardian’s con-
sent, and to prevent recognition J.C. disguised himself in
a gigantic muffler and great coat. When Tommy’s cue
arrived, from behind the muffler came a growling, unintelli-
gible gurgle. Not a word of the speech was decipherable,
and the youngster “got off” flurried, hot and uncom-
fortable, conscious only that he had made a failure.
J.C. at this time was only twelve years of age.”
By a curious coincidence the B. and B. Co. produced
‘ ‘ The Importance of Being Earnest ” at Sydney Cri. on
the anniversary of O. Wilde’s arrest.
A wave of prosperity has set in for “ the Firm.” “ Djin-
Djin” at Sydney Lyceum is repeating the Melb. success;
“Trilby” at Melb. Princess’s is running the record-
breaking “ Djin-Djin ” a close race ; and the Comic Opera
Co. at Adelaide is drawing the largest houses known for
years.
Mrs. Brough, sen. (Miss Romer) is at present in England,
where she has been, or is to be, operated upon for cata-
ract. The Bulletin is sorry to hear of her troubles.
The young-looking George Trader, of Trilby Co., takes
strong exception to the assertion that his name is “ un-
mistakably Yankee.” He was born in the North of Eng-
land, and says he has never met anyone in the States of
the same name.
A Bulletin correspondent George Trader, whose
lively Zou Zou is a strong feature of Trilby, is Boucicault’s
double in size and manner, though his touch is a little
lighter. He has played most of Boucicault’s parts in
’Murka, and as the Melb. public have fallen in love with
him as one woman Brough should make a bid for his ser-
vices when partner Dot departs hence. Trader also re-
sembles Boucy in a deep veneration for Pinero.
The’Murkan mummers say that the Melb. Princess’s
production of “Trilby” excels any seen in their country
in respect of the third act setting, the dancing in the
studio, and the general stage management.
About 7000 copies of “ Trilby ” have already been sold
from Cole’s Book Arcade, Melbourne. W. and M. by ar-
rangement with Cole, have their finger on the pulse of the
“ Trilby ” boom. Each copy of the book is furnished with
a neat advt. “ dodger ” supplied by the Firm, and at short
intervals an application for another 1000 “dodgers” is
telephoned from the Arcade to the Princess’s The book
pushes the show, and the show sells the book, so when
treas. Tallis meets Cole in the street they exchange smiles
like the augurs of old. s
Note the flaw in Godfrey’s clever make-up at Melb.
Tivoli : a snow-white head and a beet-red face under-
neath—blanc-mange surrounded by raspberry-jam.
Melba is returning to Eng. from the States with shekels
galore, and is to appear in June, at Covent Garden, at a
very high salary. There is no word now of her Australian
trip. You must wait for that, remarks The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, until her voice is wrecked, of
which there is no present appearance.
Why didn’t the Firm have the “Trilby” posters pro-
duced in black and white ? A new departure ; an illustra-
tion of Du Mauner s particular art; and, if well done
more effective than the eternal colored litho.

One of the most popular “ turns ” at a N.Y. dime

A performance of “Dandy Dick,” announced by a
suburban touring co. (professional), was stopped by B.
and 8., the other day, by threats of legal proceedings.
“Professor” Richard, the wild-haired “healer,” has
been having another awful exposure from the Calcutta
press. Richard has now been exposed almost all over the
civilised world, and he booms along serenely and makes
money just the same.
Polly Emery, despite her farewell benefit and the many
affecting paragraphs in the papers, isn’t going to England
just yet" She stays to play Audrey in “As You Like It,”
during the Potter-Bellew season, at Sydney Lyceum.
Bellew used to complain of some one who personated
him. Was it Reuben Keirl ?
Lalla Miranda’s voice is doing wonders under Rente
Richards’s tuition. Le Gil Blas, L’Echo de Paris,
L’Evenement, and other Paris papers praise her unstint-
edly. “ A delicious, exquisite, marvellous-voiced woman
with a brilliant future ” is amongst the encomiums passed
upon her.
Maggie Moore’s co. was recently stranded at Cobar
(N.S.VV.) for want of coach accommodation to take it to
Broken Hill. So the co. lighted out by rail for Mel-
bourne, thence overland to Adelaide, and from Adelaide
by train again to the Barrier township, and arrived up to
time after 1600 miles railway travelling, and sleeping in
the train most of the time. The way of the mummer in
the back-blocks is pretty hard.
Melba’s fear is that she will wax fat and matronly. Her
panacea is three cold baths a day.
Nitice posted at one of the London theatres : “Visitors
are requested to wipe their Trilbies.” So the English

The very latest rendering is “ Bluff and Boozy Cove.”

Our excellent Gaiety friends, Leedham Bantock, Fritz
Rimma and Mrs. Phelps, have found engagements in a

Dear Bulletin, —You allow someone to support “Dot”
Boucicault’s ridiculous explanation of the reason why we
have no great Australian actors (the prevalence of the
Australian accent) with an assertion that Australians do
not speak English, backed up by the yarn about “ plites,”
and “ kike,” and “ gripes.” Now, that yarn is a chestnut,
and it is an English chestnut, and was first told to the
discredit of the English-speaking peoples at the fountain
head, where the flow should be pure and undefiled.
Please, who do speak English if not the Australians ? Do
the English of Cornwall, Lancashire, Cumberland, or
Middlesex ? Is the worst Australian accent discoverable
by the nice ear of an expert like Mr. Boucicault nearly as
far from perfection as any one of the few-score English
dialects, or is the Australian’s grammar as formless and
void as that of the average Englander? And yet England
has produced a few great actors, if not Mr. Boucicault,
who will probably claim that he speaks the purest Dublin.
—S.S.
A gushing N. York critic on Yvette Guilberte “ She
has always been a striver, has this frail-built young
Frenchwoman, with the slenderness of Diana and the
earnestness of Fanny Davenport. And, if passing sorrows
have not furrowed the nacre of her white forehead, if
tears have not reddened her blonde eyes, it was because
her forehead was of pure Paros, and because tears under
her golden lashes turned to a limpid rosewater that pre-
served the little blue flower of poesy which struggled to
live in the large pale eyeballs.”
The Trilby foot, the Ellen Terry skip, and the Bern-
hardt mouth have dropped out of fashion with ’Murkan
women, and the latest craze is the Duse Eyelid Droop,
which consists in imitating the Italian actress’s drop ol
the eyelid in order to obtain “an expression of dreamy
and deeply-lustrous softness.”
Who will do up “ Trilby ”as a grand opera? Mascagni
should be put on the job.
The sexes, it seems, are still unequal in
South Australia. A letter published in Adelaide
Register :
Sir, —It is to be hoped that at the coming- elections a
little more courtesy will be shown to the ladies than was
accorded to them at the Town Hall the night of the
Premier’s address to his constituents. Five ladies stood
in the body of the hall for nearly two hours before it
occurred to one of the many hundreds of men to offer
them a seat, and then the offered chair was one just
vacated by a man who was leaving- the room. Need I say
that, as he took so long to find out that the lady might
like a seat, it was courteously declined ? If this is what
we are to expect on polling-day, I fear some of us will stay
at home.— Etiquette.
This Saturday (April 25) S.A. Assembly
general elections will begin and end. The present
contest has excited enormous interest locally,
inasmuch as it resolves itself into a pitched battle
between the National Ass and democratic parties.
Owing to its splendid organisation, the Labor-
party carried all before it in ’93, but since then
the Ass has organised, and, adopting- “manipula-
tion of the rolls ” as the chief item in its policy,
has greatly altered the condition of things. It is
not unlikely the Tories will win back one or two
metropolitan seats after all, Labor members
M‘Pherson, Wood and Hourigan not being
at all certain of re-election. But the Ass is in
fear as to the country constituencies. Many pro-
minent Tory members of last Assembly, notably
John Downer (Opposition leader), Howe, Caldwell,
Riddoch and Glynn, are in danger of succumbing
to local Liberal candidates who have adopted the
Ministerial programme, which, owing to its popu-
larity with the producers, has much enhanced
democratic chances in the provinces. But every-
thing depends upon that mysterious element—the
great woman vote. The Ass party professes to
believe it will go almost en bloc to Conservative
candidates ; the Democrats hope that at worst it
will be evenly divided.
A PROPOS DE DOTS.
The steamer which bears Dot away
Will duly carry one ;
And, if he meets a dot, they say
He’ll really marry one :
So, when he’s next in fair Austra-

The boat may carry three—hooray 1—
And he will carry one !

to 3; without Queensland, the chances are reckoned
3 to 10.
The rejection of Attorney-
General Byrnes by North Bris-
bane is said to have been in
part brought about by the
vigorous circulation of the
opinion that his return by the
premier constituency would
give him a solid title to the
reversion of the Premiership.
Byrnes being an R.C., the old
Adam of bigotry accordingly
put in his work. This is quite
likely. Queensland has not, so
far, had an R.C. Premier. It
has had them of most other re-
ligions, but no R.C. has entered
in ; and when John Douglas,
then Premier, allowed Bishop
Quinn to marry him, it was
seen by his friends, ;..iu the
result verified the forecast that,
although he stoutly declared he
was still a Protestant, his
ruling days were over.,
“ Black-labor Callan,” re-
marks a Bulletin correspon-
dent, “has again romped in
for Mount Morgan. This time
he had a majority of 306 ; last
time only 43. It is hard to be-
lieve that this is a true indica-
tion of the state of political
feeling on the Mount. The
contest was purely between
Labor and Capital (as personi-
fied by the Mt. Morgan Co.)
and not a political struggle at
all. One of the sights of the
day was the gangs of workmen
being marched down from the
works to the polling in
the charge of petty bosses. The
election afforded excellent op-
portunities of ‘crawling,’ and
these were not thrown away.
Labor also accounts for its
great defeat by the old cry of
R.C. influence. Anyhow, Fat-
man has got home again.
Political professions and
the legal profession don’t keep
good time together. The legal
M.P. who is a democrat on the
platform has often to be a ram-
pant Tory in practice. Witness
Deakin, 'for the ship-owners,
before the Sangster Shippmg-
board. It will be well for Alfred,
M.P., xf his radical supporters
out Essendon way have not fol-
lowed too closely the doings and
sayings of Alfred, lat Mans
legal adviser, before the Board.
The common elector does not
appreciate the subtle distinction
between the lawyer and the
politician. Deakin should care-
fully educate his constituents
up to the fact that his utter-
ances as a lawyer are always
“ without prejudice.”
Disraeli’s old cant phrase ‘‘ Poseo with
Honor,” was recently misprinted m » British
Torv paper “Peace with Horror. Which is
correct! P Peace with Armenian Horror is just
about it.
Seventy years ago, N.S.W. Government
“ran” a sugar plot of some 600 ac. at Port
Macquarie, and even then, and with the primitive
appliances at hand, succeeded in making a sma
profit on th© transaction.

Stereotyped hogwash, tailed with bare assertion.

It was truly a fearsome thing to hear one
of the Boodle wraith candidates during the late
election —a man whose name is a synonym for
illiteracy and coarseness—calling upon the electors
to support him in “the name of Christi-hanity
agin them ’ere hinfidels and hatheists of the Labor-
party. ”
The Jap.-trotted N.S. Wales Attorney-
General, J. Want, tells how the Chinese in the in-
terior of China, who have heard at all about the
China-Jap. war, believe that the invaders were
beaten back into the Yellow Sea, since they didn’t
march on to Pekin. Australia’s hope is that
China may sleep on thus soundly for another
century.
A hundred and ten Australian natives, led
by three aboriginals, are alleged to have marched
solidly up to vote for Byrnes at the Warwick
polling-booths. The writer has always had a
sneaking sort of satisfaction in being an Australian
native—an irrational, sentimental kind of satis-
faction, quite unconnected with logic—but it’s
fast leaving him.

Which is pleasant, stimulating talk.
The other day a N.S.W. firm secured a
Government contract for 1000 casks cement, and
the shoddy organs, especially Sydney D.T., cheered
vociferously, and said that this proved loca
industries can get along all right under Iree-
trade. As a matter of fact, the duty is still on
cement, and will remain on till Ist July, so the
case only shows that local industries can get along
all right under Protection. The cement industry
is simply in process of flickering out because buyers
are holding back till the duty comes off two months
hence. But, considering that it is still on, the
whoop about cement being a flourishing 1 reetrade
industry is interesting.
N.S.W. Lands Minister Carruthers, in his
speech at Hay, bound himself down to be member
of no Government that will raise the land-tax
above Id. Reid vowed the same thing some
months ago. Thus a Conservative ring is being
gradually formed in the land-tax camp, and, as
usual, two lawyers are the first to establish their
claim to lead the new party.
Some rough drafts of the proposed Bill for
throwing the support of indigent inmates in N.S.
Wales Govt, institutions on the shoulders of
well-to-do relatives, which there is hope of sub-
mitting to Parliament next session, indicate that
not only the well-off children, but the well-off
grandchildren of indigents will be compulsorily
distrained.
One-half million sterling represents the
amount of money involved in the N.S.W. sugar-
duty between now and the date on which Premier
Reid proposes to finally extinguish the tax. In
other words, Reid gives the sugar interest £500,000
more than he gives other manufacturing or agri-
cultural interests—and this is the point which no
eloquence can explain away.
Now that a new Commissioner of Vic.
Railways is appointed, revelations as to the run-
down condition of rolling-stock and railroads are
looming in the near distance. The first twelve-
months of John Mathieson’s reign may be ex-
pected to produce a big advance on the previous
year’s deficit, accounted for by a vast accumulation
of necessary repairing jobs and an unavoidable
expenditure on new goods.
If the N.S.W. (or any other) Government
adopted the sensible plan of creating a State Drink
Department, and ran all the groggeries, the adul-
teration of snakejuice would be killed in one act,
and comparative sobriety would reign as a sequence
to the fact that the Liquor Officer would take care
not to jeopardise his billet by over-supplying the
buyer. But these very reforms would extinguish
the “shocking example,” and the prohibitionist’s
occupation would be gone. Which is probably the
plumb reason why the prohibitionist glares side-
ways at the “ Gothenberg ” or other State-drink-
selling proposals, and vows that his conscience—
his conscience ! —will not permit him to coquet
with sin.
Considering the bitter wail of the Out-
landers in the Transvaal because the Boers don’t
allow them the franchise, it would be interesting
to know how many of these Outlanders were high-
dried Tories when in their own country. The
genuine Tory is a man who has the suffrage him-
self, and snorts furiously at the idea of giving it
to another man ; being the man on top, he pro-
fesses himself utterly unable to understand what
the man underneath can want with a voice in the
management of affairs. And yet when he goes to
a strange country, and there finds himself the man
underneath, and the man who is on top snorts at
the very idea of a thing like him wanting to have
a voice in anything, his howl of rage and astonish-
ment can be heard over four continents.
Q. Labor-party is trying with some in-
genuity to get Macdonald - Paterson and the
Telegraph crowd to form a new Ministerial party
vice the Nelson-cum -Courier crowd, and the
Worker promises qualified Labor support. The
idea is to sell support for concessions after the
fashion of the N.S.W. Labor-party. So far,
Paterson hasn’t given any overt signs of a wish
to wear uneasy shoes like Reid’s.
S.A. Tories loudly claim that the local
women owe the suffrage to them, and that J. L.
Stirling, an Ass man in the Council, was the first
to advocate the principle. What Stirling pro-
posed was to enfranchise women with property, in
all about 5000. What Kingston actually did was
to enfranchise 55,000 women on the basis of their
womanhood alone, and he carried the measure
through despite violent Tory opposition.
Sydney Telegraph’s special Q. election
correspondent is supposed to be its own ex-editor
Ward, now in charge of Brisb. Courier. S.M.
Herald’s special contribution—a very capable
letter—is set down to C. H. Buzacott, whom
Ward ejected. Buzzy is breaking his heart over
the spiteful, partisan tone which the Courier took
during the contest, and the “leading journal” is
severely taken to task by Rockhampton Argus.

tralian loyalty to Throne and Person, at the time
of the Jamieson filibust, be ennobbled on the fatal

Brisb. Courier, which thinks it can afford
to be honest after the elections, recommends the
repeal of Q. Contingent Voting Act, future elections
all on one day, and non-disqualification of candi-
dates for technical nomination-paper irregularities.
Couldn’t the Courier also afford to say something
re the throwing-out of 235 votes at Mackay because
the returning-officer initialled the front of the
ballot-papers instead of the back, and the alleged
interference of a Govt, officer at the same place?
In Messrs. Fitzgerald, Stewart and Kidston
(Central District M’sL.A.), the Q. Labor-party is
amply indemnified, in point of ability, for the
loss of Messrs. Reid, Fisher and Ogden. At the
same time it must be remembered that the flag
flown by the Rockhampton Democrats bore the
word “ Separation ” in the very largest and most
conspicuous letters, while the erstwhile Labor
Red was softened down into a most harmonious
and agreeable background of delicate pink. ‘ ‘ We’re
Scottish, ye ken—we Rockhampton Separation-
cum-Laborists !”
‘‘ I have a paper on Federation in my
pocket,” said Premier Braddon to a Tas. meeting
the other night, “ but I haven’t time to read it. I
will publish it in an English magazine and you
can read it there ”! !! Even an Australian opinion
on Australian Federation has, it seems, to be
exported to England and imported back again
before the local mind can tackle it! The Bulle-
tin hopes Premier Braddon’s next meeting will
tell him it hasn’t time to hear him talk ; but if he
likes he can go to England and speak, and his
speech can be cabled out.
The Hawthorn (Melb.) Liberal Association
has the honor to be first in the field with an Anti-
Fat' Man war-cry. Last week the H.L.A. con-
vened a conference to discuss the best means of
wiping out Softgoods Sargood when he offers him-
self for re-election to Vic. Leg. Council in Sept,
next. Thus far the real feeling of property-voters,
as a whole, towards Fat Man’s calm monopoly of
the Council has never been tested. The average
householder didn’t go to the poll. Moreover, there
wasn’t a poll, as often as not. The retiring Tory
waddled back to his seat unopposed.
The Turner Govt, does not intend carrying
out the recommendations of the Lormer Board re
a reform of the Vic. honorary magistracy. The
Premier “ feels that it is unnecessary to take such
a drastic step as that of superseding the honorary
bench.” This means that, in a few years’ time,
things will be exactly as they were, ; nd the
“honorarium” J.P. who parades town with his
hand behind him, palm uppermost, will be as
glaring an abomination as he was a few months
since; also, the kept magistrate of the street-
walker will grace the bench as dutifully as of yore.
Can sailors be compelled to put to sea in
an unseaworthy ship ? That appears to be the
crux of the action brought against the captain of
the Nicaraguan barque Dominion, for wages due
at Port Melbourne police-court. There is no
doubt that in the case of British ships the sailor
would be safe in refusing to go, but it is argued
that the Merchant Shipping Act doesn’t apply to
“foreign” vessels. There is a provision in the
Act, however, which, it is argued, provides that
in case of conflict between the foreign and the
local law in such matters, the Merchant Ship-
ping Act is to prevail.
Under present political conditions in
N.S.W. it is the height of frog-swollen tomfoolery
for the O’Sullivan-under-Lyne party to canvass
for public-meeting resolutions that “ every dis-
trict should petition the Governor to dissolve the
present Leg. Assembly.” Were H.E. to take
upon himself any such impertinence of power, a
revolution to deport him forcibly would be justi-
fiable. Voters, whether fools or not, must abide
by the actions of the Parliament they elect, and
only the “ responsible advisers ” can force upon the
Governor a dissolution. A plebiscite to the
Governor ? Pah ! An appeal to a doorknob !
S.A. Register has, for weeks past, per-
sistently accused Premier Kingston of inconsis-
tency as a politician. Not long ago the now
ultra-Tory Register was itself quite democratic,
and, amongst other items, was a strong advocate
of direct land-values taxation and adult suffrage.
The circumstances under which the Register
parted with Medway Day and abandoned all its
democratic ideas are still fresh in the public
memory. The Register would, no doubt, have
remained Liberal had the Ass not threatened to
establish a third Adelaide daily paper. “Needs
must when the devil drives.”

THE MANLY TRAGEDY.
Above are printed portraits of Miss Florence Collins, of North
Sydney, and her lover, Andrew Ernest Arkle, who on 16th inst. shot her
and himself at Manly. Miss Collins was 19 years of age ; Arkle a year
her senior. The pair had been on terms of intimacy for four years past,
and a short time ago he asked her to marry him, and was refused. Never-
theless, the intimacy continued, and frequent meetings appear to have
fanned to flame Arkle’s jealousy of a suspected rival. Miss Collins
accepted without foreboding his company to Manly on the fatal evening,
and an hour or two later she was found shot dead on a seat on the Manly
Esplanade. Arkle 'was alive when discovered, but died shortly afterwards.

M‘Coll, M.P. for Gunbower (Vic.), is a

to do.
The Lascar sailor who stood up to the

tain overboard and had a square set-to with him
i n the water, recalls the old-time class of Aus
tralian coasting skippers, such as Jack M‘Lean,
“ Hell-fire Jack,” who made it his boast that his
threat was his bond. Of many yarns told of him,
Ibis is at least authentic. While crawling up the
winding Yarra, a swell of high degree climbed up
on the bridge. Off the bridge, damn you, sir,
sald J a °k. The swell merely pulled out his field-
glasses and said, Aw. if you re not off the

The ex-Speaker of
Vic. Assembly seems to
have lost every vestige
of the majesty which for-
merly hedged him. One
of his co-councillors down

reflection for the House
that created Bent first

A certain clever

Which recalls Frank
Hutchinson, who, one
day, met a newspaper-
man who had long been
ill, and had just returned
from Europe. “ Glad to
see you back,” said Hut-
chinson, “ you seem all
right now. They were
kind enough to say, in
Sydney, you know, that
you had been prescribed
strict seclusion and the
shower-bath.” “Yes,”
said the scribe, “ I know
they did ; and that’s why
I wrote those signed arti-
cles in the Bunyip the
other day—just to let
them see the contrary.”
“ Ah, poor fellow,” said
Hutchinson, tapping his
forehead solemnly, “ I
never had the slightest
doubt of your brain my-
self —until I saw those
articles. ”
The medallion for the Macartney memorial
i n St. Paul’s, Melbourne, depicts the ancient

Bowdlerising the old warrior thus, to suit the
so ft of taste that would clap a bell-topper on
King Lear, or send Diogenes to get his hair cut !
James Balfour, M.L.C., is now asserting

When Gov. Hampden tells N.S. Wales
that, “ if you can only get a combination of good

The new strike at Hudson Brothers’ big

firm’s persistent anxiety to feed a horse on one
straw a day. The men originally earned an
average of about <£2 10s. a week, and consented to
a reduction to about <£2, and then to a further
reduction to about 30s. The question now is
whether they will rub along on about 255. and a
share in what are facetiously called “profits,”
which share wasn’t offered until there were no
profits and little prospect of any. They—or some
of them —say they won’t; but as the horse has
been trained down so fine now, there’s really
no reason why he shouldn’t live on air, which is
unquestionably very filling at the price.
Mortimer Franklyn, the cheeky person
who cost those sterling gentlemen, the Melbourne
Hentys, thousands over his wild ventures, the
Federal Australian and World, has of late
made thousands a year in London as an insurance-
canvasser ; but he is again bankrupt —all along of
Stock Exchange gambling. In explanation of his
Melb. failure he told the London registrar that he
“had endeavored to introduce high-class news-
papers, but they were over the heads of the people.”
The impudent Franklyn was a great man in Mel-
bourne when the Hentys were spoon-feeding him
with thousands, and he always had a footman
standing outside his office-door with folded arms.
His papers, though occasionally showing good
points, were in many respects beneath contempt-
nothing ever printed in Australia matched the
Federal Australian for “ Society ” crawlsome-
ness. The enthusiastic worminess of its style
gave color to the gibe that it was conducted by a
barber.
The Canadian House of Commons has just
given up the ghost, after completing two re-
cord sittings of 129 hours and 80 hours on the
Manitoba Schools Bill, during which the Bible
and the Bab Ballads were read at length, and the
local Neilds wagged jawbones with unprecedented
fury. The trouble (as South Australians may
note) is the old trouble of sectarian education,
from which “loyal ” Canada has hardly begun to
free herself. Nowhere do Orange and Green rave
more savagely than in Canada, the paradise of
Protestant arid Catholic. bigots alike. In the
eastern provinces denominational education still
flourishes as a matter of course. The western pro-
vince of Manitoba, six years ago, made an effort to
establish unsectarian State schools, lopped off the
R.C. endowment, was hauled before the Dominion
Parliament and the British Privy Council for
“ unconstitutional action,” and has been fighting
the question ever since. The present Bill, on
which Canada is asked to give an opinion
at a general election in June, is an effort
to compel Manitoba to reinstate the R.C.
schools, but exactly how the compulsion is to be
applied is a problem. The Dominion Ministry is
roasted between two fires, and all the old passions
of Bartholomew’s Day, and the Boyne water, and
the “ glorious and immortal memory,” are let
loose Religion and Rum are the two best stimu-
lants humanity knows of, but when Religion
starts in earnest Rum is nowhere.
Dicky Smith, the familiar little fur-capped
Crown Law messenger of Melb., passed from this
sphere last week. Dicky lent a bit of money to
bosses, though, to be sure, he was not such a
dabster in that line as some of the constables, who
have despised the bills of a saymor and gone for
the inspectors and shupenntendents with bull-
in-china-shop effect, if the occasion arose.

setting up the
speech ran short of
“ I’s ” and sent down
to the Herald for a
few hundreds of the
personal pronoun.
“Can’t lend you

of the Herald fore-
man — “we’re set-
ting up the same

We’ve run out of

Habbe was a Dane by birth, and was in his day and
in his own particular line a great man, but greater
men came along and he faded into a species of
eclipse. The best thing he did was the drop-
scene of the old Victoria Theatre, Sydney, and he
did it over again for Melbourne Opera House.
He was at one time in partnership with Wilson,
the well-known theatrical manager, who survives
both him and his later associate, Majeroni. Habbe
lived in retirement in Melbourne for a long time
before his death, and this generation hardly re-
membered even his name, until his obituary notice
recalled him vaguely to memory.
The Late A. C. HABBE, Scenic Artist.
Advt. from S.M. Herald of April 11 :
QONSCIENCE.
When I was a (steerage) passenger during the August
trip of theU.S.S. Rotokino from Auckland to Sydney, I
meanly stole half-a-crown from an article of clothing be-
longing to Mr. Roberts, and two boxes of matches from a
coat belonging to another (name unknown), both steerage
passengers.
The pipe, with case, that I raffled on board, and the
other articles that I sold to members of the crew, I did
under false pretences, for these all had been stolen by me
in New Zealand.
A week or so later, at Eden, when on board the U.S.S.
Oonah, on the way to Hobart, I swindled a person who
had come off to the steamer by giving him a foreign
copper coin instead of—and not so large as —a penny, as
part payment for a stamp for a letter for New Zealand,
that he had kindly consented to stamp and post for me oh
his return to shore.
Shortly after my return from Hobart I stole a piece of
Tobacco and a Pocket Knife that I had found on a seat in
the Botanical Gardens. I used the knife for a time, and
some weeks later I left both articles at the Superintendent
of the Garden’s house for the owner should he apply for
them.
I hid from several who had taken tickets in the raffle
that there were more members for it when it came off than
I had at first represented there would be. I was also
unaware of the value of the pipe and case, and also of
nearly all the articles I sold, and yet I stated positively
that such and such had been the price. In some instances
I asked for and obtained more than I knew was the value
of an article.
I hereby beg the pardon of ALL.

THIS Cbmpay is being formed to acquire Gold Mining 1 Leases Nos. 1782 and 2133, situate about twelve miles north of
White Feather and well-known as the “General Gordon.”
r* The property consists of 41J acres on the north shore of Red Lake, which at all times yields at a slight depth more
than sufficient water for milling purposes. At the present time there is a large volume of water on the surface of the
Lake. Since its discovery the prospectors have sunk one shaft 70ft. and one shaft 30ft., and opened up several large
costeens and trenches, and this work has confirmed the reputation of the mine for phenomenal richness, which was
indicated at the surface. Special attention is drawn to the published reports of Mr. G. R. Fearby, Dr. Chewings, J.
Renowden, and N. W. Harper, J.P., Manager of the Robinson Gold Mines, White Feather (Kanowna), all of whom are
unanimous in their opinion of the great value of this property which the Directors confidently believe to be the richest
in Western Australia.
It is the intention of the Directors to immediately proceed with the erection of a ten stamp mill, and at the same
time vigorously develop the mine. They also intended having a trial crushing before the allotment took place, but
owing to the late heavy rains rendering the transit of ore to the White Feather battery difficult this was found to be
impracticable.
The present issue of Shares will place the Company in possession of more than £lO,OOO working capital, which it
is believed will be ample, as there is an enormous quantity of ore ready for milling which will yield a very high
average. It is proposed to develope the mine on the open cut system, the position of the lodes being admirably
adapted for this method of working.
Steps are now being taken for the establishment of a London register.
The price to be paid for the property is £17,000 in cash and 40,000 fully paid-up Shares.
Applications for Shares shotild be made on the form enclosed to the Brokers of the Company. If the Shares
allotted be less than the number applied for, the surplus of the amount paid on deposit will be applied in reducing the
amount due on allotment, and where no allotment is made the deposit will be returned in full. Prospectuses and
application forms may be obtained at the offices of the Company, and also of the Brokers. It is intended to allot the
Shares .pro rata.
- SUMMARY OF REPORTS ON THE GENERAL GORDON.
From a carefully-selected bulk sample of the whole of the lode matter as exposed in the bottom of the shaft, I
obtained"the«splendid result of gold, 4oz. 19dwt. sgr. per ton 22401 b. In selecting this sample I carefully avoided and
threw out all ore that I had any suspicion would assay at all high, and this result may be accepted as the value of the
ordinary ore.
From stone that showed just a few colors the somewhat startling result of 8490 z. 12dwt. lgr. was obtained. The
ore shows gold freely enough, and when broken again and again it is seen to be well distributed through it. Near the
top of the shaft on the southern end good gold may be seen in the stone. At intervals this chute may be traced down
the wall to within 2ft. of the bottom of the shaft. There the gold becomes more plentiful and forms a yellow speckled
band that appears to pitch steep to the south. The ore hereabouts is very rich. I had blocks of this ore removed,
and the band when I left stood still in the face. I can only add that, in my opinion, immense bodies of highly payable
ore will be opened up in this mine, much of which as we have seen wil be phenomonally rich in gold.—’l remain,
respectfully yours,
General Gordon, Coolgardie, Oct. 15, 1895. OHAS. CHEWINGS, Geologist, Ph.D., F.G.S., etc.
So far as the developments are concerned the results are highly satisfactory, and the probabilities of the property
turning out an immense success are very great so far as the stone in the shaft is concerned. It is enormously rich,
and I see no reason why this same phenomenal class of stone should not exist elsewhere in the formation, as there is
nothing on the surface at the shaft to indicate rich stone, and there is no gainsaying the fact but that the property
has an excellent prospect in view.—Yours faithfully,
Kanowna, 16th October, 1895. N. W. HARPER, Manager Mt. Robinson G.M. Co.
The rock taken out of this shaft is simply impregnated with gold, the main golden chute dips to the south, and
during the time of my visit Dr. Chewings broke down some of the finest samples of gold bearing stone I have ever
seen. I myself broke down with a hammer and gad several pieces from right across the S. face, every piece of which
showed gold. The golden stone given you by' the prospectors for assay and show specimens cannot came near in point
of richness that broken out by Dr. Chewings, and which I should estimate to go several hundred ounces per ton. There
is every possibility and probability of this rich gold going down, as it is not in rich dabs and patches, but evenly dis
tributed through the stone. —I remain, etc.,
Coolgardie, 15/10/95. JOHN O. RENOWDEN, Manager Bayley’s No. 2 South.

HOT CLIMATES.—“ I cannot refrain from
adding my testimony to the great efficiency of
your Fruit Salt’ here. I have a store, and as
numerous travellers are constantly passing and
the climate being extremely hot, frequently 110°
in the shade, there is naturally much drink con-
sumed. It is a colonial custom that if a traveller
drops in your store, to ask the proprietor to liquor •
I did ‘liquor’ for some considerable time and found
my liver increasing in consequence. Having been
recommended your excellent ‘ Fruit Salt ’ I
steadily applied myself to six bottles in accordance
with the instructions given, and I feel myself
bound to say that the result was not only satis-
factory, but, I believe, has permanently reduced
my liver to its normal size. Since then I invari-
ably use your ‘Fruit Salt’ when asked to ‘liquor’
in place of the beverage which inebriates and
doesn’t always cheer, and charge the customer
as per usual.—l remain, Sir, yours truly, W.

five wins, with Preston a good second. This per-
formance is the more meritorious, as Mr. S. only
sent the one horse for each race, and those weeks
before the races. Mr. S. is always good over
Sydney and Adelaide races, but this time he has

Mark Twain Again.
There are few prominent Americans more favour-
ably known in Australia than “Mark Twain,” the
humorist. He was once. credited with a truism
which fairly illustrates the keenness of perception
and soundness of thought which gleam brightly
through and characterise his quaint diction. He
is reported as saying : —‘ ‘ There is no use filling
the upper story of a youth with scientific know-
ledge unless he has a fair stock of common-sense on
the ground floor.” Good, old-fashioned, common-
sense was what Mr. Hugh Barnett, a retired
Government servant, of Roma, Queensland, exer-
cised when he took advantage of his friends’ and
neighbours’ experience and chose a remedy for
indigestion and liver troubles which had cured
them. His experience justified that decision, and
is worthy of thoughtful consideration. He writes:
—“ From personal experience with Warner’s Safe
Cure I have no hesitation in advising persons
suffering from liver disease to take it in preference
to all other remedies. For a long time I endured
terrible suffering from that complaint. The pains
under the shoulder blades, down the back and in
my chest and side were so severe that I could get
no rest day or night. My appetite failed, and I
became so weak and worn out that I was obliged
to give up work of every kind. After spending
much time and money in other directions, I
started to take Warner’s Safe Cure, and after
using several bottles I am thankful to say that I
have quite recovered my former good health.”

SIXTEENTH REPORT.
Presented to the Shareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting on 29th April , 1896.
HDHE Directors beg to submit herewith balance-sheet and statement of accounts to 31st
Mai'cli, duly audited and certified, showing a profit for the half-year of £2099 Bs. 2d.,
which, with the balance previously at credit of profit and loss account, they propose to
carry forward. It is a matter for much regret that another session of Parliament has ended
without the passing of an amendment of the Companies Act, and that the Directors are
therefore still without the necessary legislative authority to write down capital or declare a
dividend out of the profits earned during the half-year.
The volume of business is well kept up, and it will be noticed that the bank’s financial
position continues strong, the cash reserves being 35 per cent, of the liabilities to the
public.
By order of the Board.

One of the pleasantest, coolest, most
central and best-appointed restaurants in Sydney
is the Manhattan Dining Room, situated in the
basement of the great Equitable Building in
George-street, Sydney. It is in the middle of the
busiest portion of Sydney, and is in every respect
a high-class establishment with good cooking, good
attendance, a lavish bill of fare, and luxurious
fittings and furnishings.*
The latest controversy is re the fairness of the
“ push stroke ” at billiards, upon which opinion is much
divided. Mitchell has challenged Roberts to play him at
the odds of a third of the game, “ push stroke barred,
and John has replied accepting it, but the champion
sarcastically says he would rather present Mitchell with a
substantial cheque if he wins than allow him or his
friends to risk their money in backing him (Mitchell).

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Randwick victories of Wallace will, no
doubt, resurrect the familiar paper talk about Car-
bine’s prospects at ’Ome. There’s a lot of luck in breed-
ing. Judicious nicking is a potent factor. Trenton may
beat him hollow, and there’s no visible bar to Carnage
putting both in the background. Ragimunde and Son-of-
a-gun are the only two notable gets of Petronel, so far.
Petronel himself unexpectedly won the Two Thousand
once, retiring with 11 races to his credit—mostly Queen’s
Plates. He proved very mediocre in handicap society.
» * * «
Wallace, 100 to 5, is already the big Cup
favorite. Seeing that he’ll get much less than 10st., and
that Wilson will have a rare string to choose from, one of
the younger well-bred stable-mates or Trentham seems a
much more hopeful spec.
* * * *
As Carbine and Carnage both ran second in
Melb. Cup as 4-year-olds, it would only be in keeping with
family traditions if Wallace followed suit. However, it’s
quite on the cards that when his time comes he’ll run
second to none.
One explanation of the early spring wagering is
the public’s success at Randwick. In handing over
cheques Ikey Mo got in his little doubles by way of
solatium, and generous backers picked promiscuously.
Merely a case of tempering the wind to the shorn ram.
• * * *
The extra meeting of the A. J.C., within a week
of a four-days’ autumn carnival, seemed like a greedy
grasp at a well-filled public purse. Its success was mainly
due to people having plenty of ring-money to play with.
* * » *
The poor quality of Sydney hurdlers as a class
was again exemplified on Saturday, when old Escort,
dead-lame a few days previously, won, unbacked, in a
field of four.
* * * *
V.R.C. four-horse steeple on Saturday saw all
the horses fall over, the jockeys doing the chasing to have
another try. Abbotsford eventually got home. Remi-
niscent of a by-gone M.L. chase. The horse that got
furthest round stopped at the water for a full half-hour.
His win was due to a Chow, who threw a packet of lighted
crackers at his feet, after palings and stockwhips had
failed. The leap was a record one.
w * • *
Lillie Bridge’s ruling over the Compulsion-
Eurobin business was a quaint affair. Because the owner
won with the prad he had backed (Eurobin) in preference
to the favorite, the latter was disqualified, and the event
declared “no race.” Had W. R. Wilson elected, at the
last moment, to win Sydney Cup with Trentham instead
of Wallace, the public might have growled, but the club
couldn’t declare it “no race.” Lilliputians should be
governed by common-sense law. Small prad-owners
ought, in future, either advertise their intentions or tell
the stewards that their second strings carry the cash.
• • * *
Response another third—in April Stakes ! Dan
O’Brien has lost more over this beauty than he got when
he sold Carbine.

Wallace has already won a latter-day Melb. Cup
In point of value ; £5BBl to date.
• * * *
Following the Miller stable was a profitable
business at Flemington last Saturday. The red-and-white
jacket only got home once in five tries, but the winning
animal, Preston, started at 8 to 1. In the same race the
roguish Moorite, receiving 121 b. from Preston, was tried
again and found wanting.

A little tip, by way of sport,
For coming Melbourne Cup—
When they shall hang the numbers up,
Be sure you “ hold the Fort ! ”
* * * *
Vic. and S. A. bookies launched out early books
over the Onkaparinga meeting. The natty Dungan, the
Steeple favorite since the weights appeared, was backed
for thousands. This, on the top of the heavy Sydney Cup
blow, won’t leave Ikey Mo much spare cash for billiards.
* * * *
The straight-going brothers Manifold begin to
find honesty a non-paying racingpolioy. Two years back,
their b.g. Apsley won four hurdle-races in Melb., including
a G.N. Starting with a light impost, victory brought
such penalties that his fourth win found him with impos-
sible burdens. Dungan, the flying “ lepper,” is another of
Manifolds’ experiences. Once successful at Caulfield and
twice at Onkaparinga, his career seems as ended as
Apsley’s.
* * * *
Although S.A. police have instructions to arrest
“bookies” found wagering at horse-races, the broken-
nosed seem to do just as they please at local cycle meet-
ings. At S.A. Easter meeting the pavilions were crowded
with books, who openly cried the odds, whilst the police
were in full force at Tattersall’s races held on the same
day, ready to run in any of the small remnant in attend-
ance there. Wanted at S.A. cycle meets, either no betting
at all, or the tote !

Ancient ’chaser Bushman, seen to advantage
lately, has retired twice, and is an old theatrical per-
former.

Musket blood at Randwick meeting—nine firsts,
nine seconds and six thirds.
* ♦ * *
Vic. reps, have only won Sydney Cup thrice in
15 years—Carbine (twice) and his son.
* * * *
Fishhook, Petrea, Progress, and Wallace have
been the only three-year-olds to win the double, Sydney
Leger and Cup, in 30 years.
* * * *
As a result of the Musket-blood boom at ’Ome,
Petronel has advanced at a bound to lOOgs. per mare.
One sporting paper avers that, as Australian cracks are
inferior to the cream of English thoroughbreds, Petronel’s
claims to be considered the chief of his line are unde-
niable. Which is rough on Carbine and Trenton. Judg-
ing by a well-printed picture of Petronel, he and Manton
(N.S.W.) are more like Musket than any of the family.
The stock of the English rep. have, so far, been remark-
able for stamina rather than speed.
* * * *
The only S. Gup winner that ever carried 8.12
before Wallace was The Barb in ’6B, when Stumpy and
Tim Whiffler ran second and third. The following year
Tait’s black demon won with 10.8, and the same pair
finished behind him.
* * * *
Noticed that since good stakes have been offered
by leading S.A. clubs, tempting Vic. horses across, local
owners have had to be content with a very small piece of
pie.
* * * *
Bookies laying small boys the odds to three-
pence are a disgusting feature of Randwick outside en-
closures. Hominy should be meted out to all caught
taking coppers from youngsters over a horse-race.
* * * *
A country club, excised by the Wellington
Metrop. body under the turf-restriction policy, has caused
an unseemly tote squabble in M.L. by securing a tote
permit from the Premier, through influence. The Metrop.
club refused sanction to the fixture, and Mr. Seddon de-
clined to give the big club itself a permit until it backed
down. So there is no racing, and the club and the Pre-
mier are now “ standing on their dignity.” The Premier
is likely to stand the longer, but this row may mean the
abolition of the tote next session, and then

The latest turf imbecility. Buy a race-game,
name the mechanical tin neddies after prominent real
Mackays ; note the one that wins oftenest during the
evening, and back him for the Cup.
* * * *
It will be very fashionable ere long to send
youngsters ’Ome after they’ve shown form here. Fat
slakes and honor and glory are tempting baits to the
average long-purse owner.
An incident of the first Champion race, of ’59,
is recalled by Mr. Filgate’s death. He owned The Barber,
who, with Juniper, was sent to represent S.A., but got
wrecked in the Admella. The pair swam ashore, Juniper
with broken legs. Discovered a few days afterwards, The
Barber was taken on a week's walk to Melb., and started
hog-fat.
* * * *
Viewed in the murky light of past experience,
metrop. clubs are far more chary of passing out disqualified
neddies than the smaller institutions. They endorse the
latter’s periodical black-lists with the unction of men con-
scientiously performing a public duty, but their own cases
are treated differently. Suburban clubs do toss the flies
out of their cream-juy but leading - lights are
afraid to touch big owners. Influence and stiffness run
tandem fashion on the turf.
* * * *
Auraria, raced as a two-year-old right up to the
end of last season, when she won a mile and a quarter
event, only lasted over the Spring and collapsed, perhaps
for good. Youngsters aren’t moulded on cast-iron prin-
ciples.
* * * *
Nine thoroughbred horses fetched a total of =£69
under the hammer last week at Sydney. An £8 racehorse
is generally dearer than a whole shipful of poor, but affec-
tionate relations. Seeing that racing failures are at dog’s-
meat prices now-a-days, it’s a wonder racing men don’t
attempt to convert them into trotters. They’d fetch
perhaps treble their cost. The idea that a racer can’t trot
because he isn’t bred that way, and that he will always
want to bolt, is erroneous. The writer has seen any
number shaping well at the game, and the only neddy
that ever went full speed ahead started from scratch, and
caused the whole field to break. His whiskied jock had
his own ideas about making up ground, and, after finish-
ing on the other side of a furze hedge, was passed out for
a quarter—which period he spent in hospital.

Next day, he was press-described as suddenly appearing
on the scene like “ a bolt from the blue.” His crowd
probably did look blue.

Übiquitous Gollan, with horses in England,
M.L., and Sydney, deserves more than a casual bit of luck.
Tirb’s win at Randwick and Ebor’s at Wolverhampton was
a unique double. Ebor was always a top-storey hurdler,
but has only won twice in Gollan’s colors. A steeple was
thought foreign to his nature. “ If a prad can lep, put
him at ’em.”

Wallace has inherited Carbine’s tendency to
hoof-splitting. The sire’s feet, as well as his teeth, were
troubling him when he carried lOst. into second place for
the Melb. Cup won by Bravo.

Surcingle: “Most of the principal jockeys

G. H. Clifford, Major George, and G. S.
Stead, three M.L. turf pillars, simultaneously announced
their retirement. Then Stead scored four wins and five
places at Christchurch meeting. Again the devil’s whis-
per ! Stead couldn’t get prices when his cracks were
auctioned, and so kept them.

Lord Byron (Neckersgat—Fille-de-Joie), winner
of V.R.C. April Hurdle-race, is well enough bred to win a
Melb. Cup. Brewer rode a wonderful race, and just
squeezed home by a neck.

The unwritten history of some of this season’s
big cycle handicaps would be interesting. As an instance
of the value of pacing, one back-mark man (an even-
money favorite in a field of 12) agreed to divide equally
with a rider (also among the back division) to pace him
through. The stake was one of the largest yet offered,
and the last-named rider had not a 25 to 1 chance of even
getting a place from his mark, in his then condition. It
was a great race, and the favorite could only get second
money. This—in itself a decent stake—was equally
divided with the pacemaker, who lasted long enough to
get his man up to the field.
In another valuable handicap the winner re-
ceived just 8-25ths of the total first-prize money. The
trainer, a man who can dictate his own terms, received a
third (besides a regular weekly payment), and the rest
went in “cuts” to pacers. As a one-time pedestrian, the
present writer, like many others, could not understand the
great advantage of pacing until he took to cycle racing.
Then it became easily apparent: there is a great differ-
ence between running a mile in 4.45 against a strong wind
and riding a bicycle against the same wind at a 2.25 bat.
Besides which there is the moral support of “ something
to go at”—not any disadvantage, even in pedestrianism.

It looks as if Peter Jackson is a back number,
The razor-edged Pony Moore has offered to back Charley

A sign of the times. The Sydney dailies announce

As showing the extent of the cycle craze, it is
cabled that a syndicate has boug'ht the pneumatic tire
co.’s business for £3,000,000. The co.’s original capital
was £22,500, and in a few years £658,000 has been paid in
divs. The scheme is to refloat for six millions—the figure
reached by Guinness’s brewery.

Martin should really have broken his neck in
the two-mile at Adelaide Easter cycling sports. He was
making the pace a cracker w'hen his tyre punctured and
the crack turned a complete somersault, Harris riding-
right over him.
* * * *
A. C. Nesbitt, an English cyclist, is said to have
ridden one mile, unpaced, on the main road, in lmin.
25 2-ssec.

Last Saturday’s racing convinced sceptics that
the Victorian wonder, Parsons, will rank as a second or
third-rater amongst European and American speedmen,
as he was, in turn, defeated by Rice, Porta, Megson, and
Harris—three times over a mile and once over five miles—
each of them having an equal amount of racing.
* * * *
The Melbourne bike reporters put in an excuse
for Parsons every time he gets beaten. He was always a
certain winner, until something happened to “give” the
victory to the other man, always presuming that the
other man was Martin, Porta, or Harris. The young
man will sorely miss this loyal barracking when he goes
abroad.
* * * *
Yankee Martin made himself decidedly nasty
over his mishap in the final heat of the Parsons Handi-
cap, alleging that sundry riders had conspired to bring
him down. Appearances didn’t favor the plugger’s com-
plaint, but some allowance can be made for the feelings
of a man who has just come a cropper from his bike and
been damaged in the head by a passing pedal.
Harris’s performances at the Parsons’ benefit
meeting in Melbourne suggested that the blonde Britisher
had been celebrating his recent return to “ form.” There
was no vigor in his sprint.
In the Parsons Handicap, Martin picked up the
field with a fine run, and then got pocketed. “ Martin in
the centre ; look out for the fall! ” said a spectator, who
had suffered by proximity to “ Plugger Bill ” in previous
races. Just then it came ; Martin bringing himself and a
section of the bunch down. Martin and Porta are most
execrable riders to compete against, both from want of
control of their high-geared machines, and from the reck-
less way in which they bustle for a chance to break
through.
* * * *
What about Zimmerman’s much-published
assertion that Parsons had proved himself superior to
Harris? Zim. either talked nonsense with malice afore-
thought, or else he was really as dull as he looked. The
Bulletin, at the time, wanted to know which Harris the
’Murkan “ authority ” was referring to —the man in con-
dition or altogether out of it. Both of them at their
best, Harris is considerably faster and stronger than
Parsons.
* * * *
The prolonged sprint with which Megson wore
Harris and co. down in the International Mile, at the
Parsons meeting, was the most brilliant (bar those of
Zimmerman) yet seen in Australia.
* * * •
The proposed Harris-Martin match climaxed in
the dressing-room at the Parsons meeting; a debate
between Martin and Harris’s trainer winding up in a set.
to, in which got badly worsted. It took
three able-bodied men to keep the Yank, off his victim
after the latter’s collapse. Martin, by the way, with his
moustache shaven, now presents a more Sioux-like ap-
pearance than ever, and, with a few feathers stuck m ms
hair, would be “Sitting Bull” or “Spotted Tail to
the life.
* * * *
Ex-sprinter Darrell is the first gentleman of
color to compete under the Vic. Cycle League s rules.
The unbleached American gets to the front rapidly, but
has not been long enough at the game to stay throughout
a fast-run race. Darrell is a perfect sft. Hercules, weigh-
ing list. 51b., without a superfluous ounce.
* * * *
Premier Turner’s son (confined, by the parental
edict, to the amateur class) has run first and second, from
scratch, in two consecutive races. With systematic
training he could soon be brought back amongst the first-
class professional division.
Betting is rampant at Melb. cycling meetings,
and the odds are cried by at least a score of petty book-
makers. The average number of starters in a handicap
heat is about a dozen, and it is always—“ 2tol on the
field !” Then some fatuous youth puts a half-crown on his
fancy. This at once establishes a favorite, and the cry
becomes, “6to 4 Pedals ;2to 1 on the field !” Someone
else puts a half-crown on Crank, which instantly sends
the betting to “2to 1, bar two.” However, people must
have “ something on,” and several of the best known of
the “shilling” books are doing much better at the ridi-
culous odds offered and taken than they can at even
suburban race swindles.
* * * *
Yankee files announce a projected mile cycle v.
train race. A sexplet is being built to travel 100 miles an
hour. Latest calculations show that the highest speed is
attainable with six riders, all above that number being
dead-weight. In the new machine each man is provided
with an air reservoir, and breathes through specially
designed tubes. With differentiated gear up to 150 the
sexplet will need to run a mile to get up speed, and two
more before it can be stopped. The man who falls off will
see stars.
* * * *
That modest young man, Mr. Percy Hunter,
late of Sydney D.T., now edits a Melb. cycling journal,
the fact being displayed on the cover in large caps. In
the current number the name of Mr Percy Hunter occurs
no less than seven times, a speech of his is awarded a
column with “ applause ” liberally interspersed and a por-
trait of his visage occupies a prominent position on a
central page.
* * * *
Harry K. Williams, of the S.M. Herald staff,
completed a cycling trip from Sydney to Melb. through
Snowy River district, “Banjo’s” country, during the
Easter Holidays. The journey has been done only once
before, by George Thorne in 1889, and is a heartrending
job from a cyclist’s point of view.
* * * *
The sculling-match (<£loo a-side) fixed for Aug.
between rising George Towns and plucky Chris. Neilsen
has a genuine sporting flavor Towns, only 21, has a
vague idea of being world’s champion some day. If he
doesn’t beat the Dutchman his prospects are about equal
to those of a camel in a hurdle-race.
* * * *
Stanbury will invite all ’Murka to “come on ”
if he downs Harding. As ’Murka consists mostly of the
Canadian Hanlan, it’s 2 to 1 the ancient will respond.
He’d reckon on making a good show, too, despite j’ears of
an adulterated-lemonade tendency. Stanbury should
beat Harding on July 13, unless he joins an Orange pro-
cession the day previous, and gets hit on the head with a
brick.

Australia may now gradually prepare itself for a

Editor Bulletin, —The speedy Ettie is not an
amateur-built boat. The Ettie was not built by “ Billy ”
Wain, but by his brother “ Bob,” boss boat-builder in the
Port-office yard. She was built in a backyard, at Bulimba,
under candle-light. “Bob ” Wain, in making her model,
was not guided by any other boat or person ; and he has
introduced a distinct style of craft. Sydney will have a
chance of seeing her in Nov. —J.D.

Despite N.S.W. reverses, Melb. Rugby foot-
ballers expect the coming season to boom their game.
Many converts have been captured ; one of the finest foot-
ball trophies ever offered locally is to be played for ; and,
as M.L. and English teams are expected over, things look
rosy for the game down south.
• * * *
Sydney Rugby Union’s scheme to send a team
’Ome in ’97 should stir up the football world this winter.
A few leaves from the management book of the Maori
team will require perusal and thorough revision. Cold
day heroes require an iron curb. An appalling thirst
develops the bump of continuity, and, from a festive
standpoint, places them on a par with a carol-singing
band out on a Christmas prowl.

An inventive Vie. civil servant seems to be
doing well out of his bicycle, the chief apparent advan-
tage of which is the comparatively easy working of its
high-gear and a decided facility for climbing big hills.
The rider’s position is altogether novel, standing rather
than sitting on the machine ; he also gets the extra
advantage of a glorified back-kick at the space he -has just
left behind. Another successful inventor is a Vic. Govt,
engineer, whose flying-machine is now being considered
by the British Admiralty. Ingenious arrangements for
counteracting specific gravity and effective steering-gear
constitute the main differences from other flying appara-
tus. Prof. Kernot is said to hold that the Australian has
at last successfully solved the flying problem.

Familiar names in a N.S.W. country race entry-
list—lkey Mo and Simple Jim.
ON THE ROAD—AT EASTER.
We watched them, doubled on their cycles,
whisking,
As if their lives depended on the pace ;
A metal road, fair wind, no small boys frisking
With tacks, or hooks, and sinister grimace.
They might have been in Mercury’s winged
sandals,
So swift the party travelled on the road,
With bodies bent, and firmly gripped the handles,
In suits of grey and felt hats —a la mode.
But worse than Hercules’ twelve labors, tracing
The outlines of these figures, to define
The men’s and girls’—that, innocent of lacing,
Displayed no angles or artistic line.
Their backs were much alike, no sign revealing,
The limbs, a has, were cased in leggings stout,
Defying every thrust of curious feeling
Tq prove the sex and settle points of doubt.
And as they wheeled along the track together
We looked, in vain, for frills or epaulets,
But found some hats distinguished by a feather,
And sundry knobs confined in back-hair nets.
It seems that nevermore in manner tricky
Our girls will live to graduate as flirts,
But, with a stoic heart beneath their dicky,
Develope muscle in divided skirts.

WONDERFUL
Blood-Purifying Effect
OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Railway Employe at Kalapoi, New
Zealand, writes:
V//0"
“About ten years ago, while en-
gaged in shunting, my foot caught
between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-
ing disappeared, and I have not
been troubled with it since.”

Thus a Hobart W.C.T.U. lady lecturer on
Woman Suffrage:—
Our brothers have a great aversion to what is often
jeeringly called the “New Woman.” 1 wonder if we
ought to take it as a compliment, or to mean they are
quite satisfied with women as they are? Well, we are not
satisfied with ourselves, and very often we are not satisfied
with them, and would gladly welcome, a “New Man.”
Then there was a chorus of shrill treble “hear
hears,” and the males in the audience looked un-
comfortable.
Parrots are terribly liable to tuberculosis,
and as pets are a greater menace to a household
than a hundred tuberculous cows. Of 154 sick
parrots treated at an English veterinary institute
last year, no less than 50 (or 36 per cent.) had tuber-
culosis, with Koch’s bacillus well developed. The
other day a doctor, called in to see a case of con-
sumption in a little girl, when the family history
was perfectly free from that disease, noticed the
pet parrot was ailing. The parrot was found to
have tuberculosis, and the problem of the girl’s
case was solved. “ Kiss pretty Joey ? ” No!
Dear Bulletin, —How does Dr. Fiaschi
escape the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment
Act which, in the case of his Scottish colleague,
Dr. “ Jim ” and whilom brother-filibusterer, are
about to be brought into operation with possibly
dire effect ? Dr. Fiaschi, holding H.M’s. commis-
sion as Surgeon-Captain in N.S.W. Cavalry, must
be a naturalized subject and have taken the oath
of allegiance ; therefore, he owes no patriotism to
any country but the one he resides in, and of
which he has deliberately elected to become a
citizen. Great Britain is not at war with Abys-
sinia ; if, therefore, a British subject joins the
Italians in their unholy attack upon Abyssinia,
how does he escape the charge of filibustering
within the meaning of the Foreign Enlistment
Act ? By the way, I see it stated that this Act
was passed in connection with Fenian raids into
Canada in 1870, yet, anterior to this, Lord Dun-
donald Cochrane was obliged to reside on the
Continent for a considerable time in order to
escape conviction under that Act for waging
war against Spain in the South American
Republics, and, later on, on behalf of so-
called Greek patriots. Cochrane’s case was even
less conspicuons than those of Drs. “Jim”
and Fiaschi, for he held no commission in the
service of Great Britain, and was a naturalized
subject of Chili, in which country he had acquired
property—nay, he had been struck off the navy-
list and, as it were, expatriated by a cruel and un-
just decision that deprived the country of the
services of a sea-king second not even to Nelson
himself. This, to his friends, appeared ample
justification for his actions, which, ultimately,
were pardoned. The loss to N.S.W. of a prac-
titioner of the standing and learning of Dr.
Fiaschi is in itself bad enough, but when it is
occasioned by a series of errors which may end in
even worse disaster to the militant surgeon him-
self, then it is deplorable. So far as we know,
Abyssinia is as yet a friendly power ; how, then,
(without coming under the Foreign Enlistment
Act) can any British subject join the Italian army
for the avowed purpose of fighting a friendly
power, even though that power be only an Ethio-
pian one? —Banshee. [Lord Dundonald’s case
was under a different Act. How does Fiaschi’s
case go with that of Hobart Pasha? Also, does
the Foreign Enlistment Act apply to the man
who enlists himself or the one who enlists other
people? Also, does it matter? —Ed. B.]

(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

valuable Remedies.”

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been
a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.

In a recent London law-suit, it was testi-
fied by experts that the average retail profit on
cigarettes was 75 per cent., on pipes and fancy-
goods 50, tobacco 20, British cigars 33 to 60, and
foreign cigars 33 per cent. “ The price of a cigar
depended, not on the taste of a smoker, but on the
position of the shop.”
The South African “sensitive plant” is
gaining a fim hold in Southern Queensland. The
Queenslanders view it as an interesting little
curiosity. Thus Stevenson re the same plant in
Samoa:—“A fool brought it over in a pot and
used to sentimentalise over the tender thing ; but
the tender thing has now taken charge of the
island, and strong men fight it with torn hands
for bare life.”

The realities of Australia, the Workman’s
Paradise Lost. “It was this way with me,” said
Tom, the bush-whacker, as he laid down his axe
for a smoke. “ Old man says to me ‘ what’s the
good of you slavin’ here for a paltry 15 shillin’s a
week ? Go to Australia and get your four pound
a week, and perhaps make your fortune.’ So I
came; landed in Melbourne with ten notes.
Didn’t know much of the country then or I
wouldn’t have busted it the way I did, in four
days. I had some pretty good togs on, so I
swapped ’em for a swag and billy and tramped off
to get a job at four notes a week. Walked about
for three months before I got a job. And it was a
job—slavin’ from four o’clock in the morning till
seven at night for ten bob a week. A chap on the
same place told me to save my money and go and
fet work through a labor-office in town. I did.
’aid a pound for the job and spent my last stiver
in the railway-fare. When I’d gone 150 miles by
train and walked another 30, I found there was no
job at all. Walked a few more hundred miles,
and landed at last, hanging in tatters, and half
starved, on another ten-bob-a-week job. Got the
sack the third week because I couldn’t split rails
quick enough. Picked up another billet in a few
days—eight bob a week this time. That was the
hardest work I ever had. One day the boss (he
was a cocky and quarryman combined) put me
feeding a stone crusher with an eleven-pronged
fork. I struck, and humped it once again. _ Took
a spell as slushy in a shanty after this at six bob
a week. Been two and a half years in the country
now and never got more than 12s. 6d. a week. I
ought to have known better than take advice from
the old man.”
When Rockhampton first arose on the
banks of Fitzroy an allotment was granted to the
Church of England, but, up to Separation time,
no minister of any denomination had settled
there, neither was there any school, so the
people subscribed and erected a building on this
allotment, which was used as a school on week-
days and as a church on Sundays. If a minister
of any kind visited Rockhampton he held the ser-
vice of his church in it, but, if there was no minis-
ter in town, the clerk of petty-sessions read the
Anglican service. However, after Separation,
Bishop Tufnell, of Brisbane, visited Rockhampton,
and was indignant that other denominations were
allowed to hold service in the building, which was
on C. of E. land. He preached in the church next
Sunday, and announced that no minister of any
other creed would in future be permitted to hold
service in it. As all had subscribed to the erection
of the place, people were very angry, and the com-
mittee by whom it had been built determined to
pull it down and put it up elsewhere. But, man
proposes and God disposes,” for, just after the
children had left the school on Monday, a heavy
squall levelled the edifice to the ground.

Victoria will have to do something desper-
ate with its Water Commission. Some time in
the long ago the Patterson Ministry appointed
certain of its hangers-on to go round the country
at the public expense, and report on the water and
irrigation trusts. The report was to be forth-
coming in three months ; but for two solid years
the Commission has gone to and fro, and consumed
much drink, solid food, and cigars, arid looked
with unseeing eye at irrigation ditches in all parts
of the country, and no report is forthcoming.
Finally, the Turner Ministry cut off the supplies
and left the Commission to pay its own food and
liquor bill; but it still wanders to and fro from
force of habit, and doesn’t report. Premier Turner
now thinks of having the Commission arrested for
vagrancy.
Torresian divers are hard to manage. The
other day a lugger was fitted out with extra piping
because the Manilla diver wished to go into deep
shell-bearing water. ,£l3 in advance did the
Manilla man receive ; a crew was specially fitted
out total outfit, about £BO. After five weeks the
boat returned with one pair shell valued at about
Is. 6d. The diver was afraid to go down in the
deep water.
Ihe Argus wants private ownership of
water, and points out that the Vic. fisheries are
being destroyed because water is “no man’s land.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He kissed the children as they slept, took
up his bag of Government rations, and, stepping
gently, went on tip-toe to the door. His wife was
there.
Good bye, Sarah,” he said, with a voice half
choking. I will write to you soon.”
“ I’m afraid, Hal, I’m afraid you are not fit for
bush work ; you know you are not. Mind you
come back at once if you have no luck.”
Never you worry, old woman. A change is
bound to come. I should have left this starving
Sydney life long ago. The bush is the place for a
man of spirit; thousands of miles of beautiful
land, undug and untrodden. Why, there must be
room for everybody there. Think of it, Sarah !
A little bark hut all our own, with a cow and pigs
and poultry, and a garden for vegetables, and—
and—no rent to pay ! ”
The man’s sad eyes flashed the joy his mind had
conjured up. The woman pretended to have faith,
and she kissed him long and softly on each cheek.
Then, standing in the doorway, she watched his
jaunty step gradually falter at the bending of the
road into the dragging walk of a spiritless man.
* * * *
A month had gone by since Labor Bureau
free-passes had deposited Henry M'Kinnon and a
score of other destitutes at a back-block township.
Sydney was well rid of this eyesore to her beau-
tiful streets. How many miles had MTvinnon
travelled since he left the railway-station ? It
seemed, to his unpractised feet, thousands and
thousands. His rations exhausted, for days he had
Hot lived, but existed on the casual meal given
at a wayside hut. If he had had more “cheek ”
he would have done better. If the roads had not
swarmed with others like himself, seeking the
work that was not to be found, the generosity of
the ordinary bushman would have supplied his
daily bread. “ But what can we do?” said one
Woman to him, as she cut him a crust off her last
loaf. “ If there was one there has been a dozen
swagmen call here this morning.” For three days he
had eaten nothing but a piece of raw pumpkin. One
foot was so blistered and swollen that he could not
put the boot on, and limped along with it swathed
in old rags and stringy-bark. He had no heart
now to go off the road and call at the houses, here
few and far between ; he plodded on wearily,
aimlessly, he knew not where. He had only
walked seven miles that day when he camped at
nightfall by the roadside.
“ Starving’s not so bad as they make out,” he
said to himself as he sat bathing his swollen foot;
“it was a bit rough yesterday, but to-day I feel
pretty right. If I could only get a smoke ! ”
“ Good evening, mate ! I’ll camp here,” and
the new-comer, unslinging his swag, sat down.
“ What, got a bad foot ? Not used to the road, I
can see. A bloke wants to know the ropes when
he humps his bluey, my oath ! ”
“ Can you find work, then ? ”
“Yakker be damned! I’ve never done er
tap for 20 year. Not such a mug. Ain’t
there hundreds an’ hundreds as is beggitv and
praying fer graft, and de yer think I’m dog enough
ter rob ’em of what I don’t want ? Got any
tucker ? ”
“ No,” said M‘Kinnon.
“ No more have I, worse luck ! This is one of
my off days, but I’ve got ’bacca enough for two. ”
The swagman proceeded*to cut up the remnant of
a plug, and, filling his own pipe and M’Kinnon’s,
®'™ ss and supperless they smoked.
• yon what it is, mate. The country is
just going to the devil, you make no error. I
know the time when a bloke was always right for
a square feed without asking. Now you have to
tell ein pretty straight you’ve got a mouth on
yer.”
NV hat s to be done?’’said M’Kinnon, feebly
interested.
1 here s too many of us, that’s a fact. I always
said, and always will say, that if fifty thousand
men of real grit liked to do it, they could make
the country as good as ever.’’
“ Do what? ”
Go and hang themselves. The country is all
right, it’s only over stocked. What we want is a
good boil-down of surplus labor.”
morning, when the svvagman left him,
* ii mnon was too stiff and full of pains to stir.
All that day he sat there, in the Jsame place, his
back resting against a blackbutt. Only when he
moved did he feel pains. The griping pangs in his
empty stomach troubled him no longer, and in its
place a fever warmed his limbs and fired his skin.
His mind reverted, with a species of fascination,
to the proposal of his late companion, for the im-
molation of the workless workers for the benefit of
their fellows.
“ Why not ? ” he asked himself. “ What are we
good for, anyhow ? A misery to ourselves, a
nuisance to others, unwelcome visitors. Why do
we not take the hint and go? For reasons we do
not understand, this world does not want us just
now—she gives us the sack. Why not be men,
and step out before we are kicked out ? ”
Then his mind wandered on to the memory of
his wife and children, and thoughts of himself
melted away in the doubts and misgivings of what
they had suffered and were suffering. He pictured
them in that bare, gaunt cottage, living on the
dole of charity; he noted the look in his wife’s
face as her pride revolted under the yoke she
carried; he marked his eldest girl, who wondered
why she had no boots to go to school; and so they
passed before him with the clearness of delirium,
and tears came from his eyes —he could look no
more.
The night had come, and with the night a howl-
ing rain. It poured, sheeted down in masses ; the
road was a river, the bush a lake, but the man
heeded it not. The tree was no shelter to him ;
even where he sat, a pool of water formed. Per-
haps the water cooled his hot limbs. His mind
travelling backwards had, by the natural progres-
sion of ideas, arrived at that moment, a month
ago, when he pictured the day-dream to his wife.
A bark hut with a little garden, a cow, a pig,
and poultry—all his own—and his mind, losing all
coherence, dwelt on this ideal and added details of
imposing splendor. Hives of bees, fruit-trees,
a paddock with a horse in it —all was plain to
him, through the rain that streamed off his old hat
on to his knees ; through the inky blackness of the
night his burning eyes saw clearly and more clearly.
The hut was there quite close to him. His wife
was at the door, rosy and well-clothed. They had
seen him at the gate and his youngsters were run-
ning, shouting, down the path to meet him. He
caught Bob up in his arms and danced him in the
air, the child’s eyes laughing back gladness to him.

Very few readers of the papers noticed in the
country telegrams the item from Waler.
The police report the finding of the dead bod}’ of a
swagman, name unknown, on the Sydney road. At the
coroner’s inquest a verdict, in accordance with the medi-
cal evidence, was returned that death had been caused by
want and exposure. A rider was added by the jury that
somethin# should be done to abate the nuisance caused
by the orowds of destitute tramps that infested the dis-
trict.

In a cottage at Marrickville, too damp for
a rent-paying tenant to live in, a sad-faced woman
and her children are ever at the window when the
postman passes on his rounds. The gleam of hope
in their eyes brightens only to fade, as he passes
unheeding by. They are waiting.
HENRY FLETCHER.
In Flood Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For twenty-four hours it had rained unceasingly.
The creeks that had stopped during the drought
were now swollen to miniature rivers. It was
getting towards midnight, and, save a light in the
“Squatters’ Arms,” darkness reigned over the
little township. The mail for Barwonga was
ready. The five horses stood harnessed to the
heavy coach and drooped their heads in the falling
rain.
‘ ‘ Any passengers ? ” asked the driver.
“ One, a woman. Says her husband is a shearer
—dying at Black Johnson’s pub.”
“I don’t believe I’ll get across the river; it
must be a banker by this. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if I have to put in a couple of days at
Bogan’s.”
“But you’ll try and get there, won’t you? I
must see him before he dies,” said a young woman
at the door.
The driver promised to do his best, and getting
his solitary passenger in the coach he picked up
his mail-bags at the office and was soon on the
lonely journey to Barwonga. For a long while
nothing was heard but the noise of the coach and
the falling rain, and vacantly the driver stared
over the heads of the leaders into the darkness
beyond the light of the big coach lamps.
A voice roused him.
“ Will you please let me come outside ? It’s so
lonely here.”
“ But you will be soaked in five minutes,” re-
monstrated the driver.
“That would be better than sitting here alone
with my sad thoughts.”
The driver gave way, and covered her up with
an old oil-skin. “That’s Bogan’s,” he said; “if
the river is too high we’ll have to come back here. ”
“ But you promised to try,” pleaded the young
wife.
The driver answered “Very well,” and shook
his horses up as they descended the long hill that
led to the river. It was pitch dark, and only an
accustomed eye could have told where the crossing-
place was. He handed the reins to his companion,
and, taking one of the lamps, walked to the edge.
He came back slowly.
“ It’s no go,” he said. “ When the stump in the
middle of the river’s covered it’s not safe. I’m
very sorry for you ; but I can’t risk another man’s
coach and horses, so I’ll have to turn them round.”
There was a minute’s silence. Then a deter-
mined voice said, “ Could one horse swim it? ”
“He might, if he weren’t hooked to anything.”
“ Will you take one out and I will ride him
across. ”
The driver stared. He was no coward ; he had
been in many a tight place; but he didn’t care
about facing the river in its present state.
“I’ll not go back,” she said. “ You may either
lend me a horse or leave me here.”
The driver thought a bit. “I’ll do neither.
If you were a man I’d leave you to your chances,
but as you’re a woman we’ll cross or go down
together.”
He shifted his mail-bags higher, and grasped the
reins. The woman clasped her hands and turned
her face heavenwards.
The leaders snorted, but he forced them into it
with whip and voice.
Between his shut teeth he said: “I haven’t
much faith in prayers, but you can throw in one
for me ; and if you feel the coach going jump clear
of the horses.”
The river was coming down with tremendous
force. For a moment the driver reckoned it was
all up. He could hear the water rushing through
the bottom of the coach, and the horses were
struggling for footing. He was about to cry
“ Jump ! ’’ when the leaders began to ascend, and
in a few minutes the water was only at the axles.
He turned to the woman just in time to stop her
from falling. She had fainted.
It was early morning in the Selectors’ Hotel,
and Black Johnson was leaning on the bar.
“ That shearer cove keeps asking about the
coach. Wants to know if Nelly’s come. There’ll
be no coach to-day unless the Devil drives. . . ,
What! It’s coming ? ”
“ Yes, and a stranger on the box.”
“ The Devil ! ”
“ No, Jack Duggan and a woman.”
But when the driver told his story he put the
woman first.
HUGH STONE.
Alleged by naturalist Milligan, of Traral-
gon, Vic., that the female Australian cuckoo is
polyandrous ; also, that female cuckoos and laugh-
ing jackasses often adopt stray youngsters in the
open country, or even feed caged youngsters with
choice morsels through the bars.
The serum treatment scores big successes
in leprosy. Sensibility returns rapidly to anaes-
thetic areas; the pigmented spots lose much. of
their colour ; the bloating much diminishes, and
bloated spots become almost normal; the tubercles
flatten, become soft, and disappear sometimes by
absorption, sometimes by suppuration; ulcerations
rapidly cicatrise and heal up ; the ‘ ‘ leonine
aspect ”is entirely lost; appetite, sleep, hope and
contentment return.
Dear Bulletin, —Your “ road-mending ”
farmer is all over N.S.W. The members are put
in by cockie “ road-menders.” And these same
contractors and muck-eaters have much to con-
tend against. In the small towns the J’s.P. take
such jobs in their sons’ names. In one, the farms
are snapped up by the local inspector of stock, as
are some of the show prizes. Tenders for police
and hospital wood are cut down in exactly the
same way. And still they “go on the land.”
But the Germans and Chinese and other aliens
don’t leave their farms for such work, and they
certainly eat better tucker than white men. I
have thought the matter over, and, after tackling
Freetrade, Protection, Federation, bimetallism,
State bank and State monopoly, I can only find
one exit to the difficulty and that is “ threepenny
drinks ”in the bush. That alone would leave a
balance of one-third of a man’s wages for house-
hold expenses. Yes, sir, let us have threepenny
beers, and big ones at that, and prosperity will
again reign.— Scotty the Wrinkler.

Chateau Wunghnu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The North Wind shaking
His torch on high
All folk is making
Extremely dry ;
The Town is baking
As ’twere a pie.
The City-Dweller
Both breathes and sees
This Dust-Compeller,
This Tophet breeze,
While in cool cellar
We lounge at ease.
We call the waiter,
“ Wunghnu ” demand :
The shirt-sleeved Satyr
Won’t understand ;
He brings—the traitor !
A foreign brand.
Plague take these young, new
Hands where one dines,
He thinks our tongue new—
Welsh he opines—
“ Bring Chateau Wunghnu l
The King of Wines / ”
He comes—proceeding
With step of stork—
Forth corkscrew ! speeding ,
Like lightning-fork,
It draws out bleeding
The faithful cork.
Now, no more juggling,
O Waiter droll!
The bottle, struggling
To reach the bowl,
With rich glug-gluggling
Gives up its soul.
See how it flashes,
This grape-blood fine !
Our beards it splashes,
O comrade mine !
Life dust and ashes
Were, wanting wine.
Amontillado
Fires heart and eyes;
Champagne the shadow
Of care defies;
An Eldorado
In Rhine-wine lies;
Port’s ever ready
For gen’rous deeds ;
Tokay, though heady,
Right nobly bleeds ;
But as a steady
Drink Wunghnu leads.
Yet is it wanting
In poesy:
No legends haunting
Its vassals be,
No tales enchanting
Of chivalry.
Spain’s grape hath stories :
Its blood the bold
Conqui stadores
Drank deep of old —
A wine of glories,
A wine of gold.
Who drinks, not sparing,
Beholdeth he
The great Cid bearing
His banner free,
Columbus daring
The unknown Sea;
And, haply biding
In this dream—Spain,
Don Quixote riding
Across the plain,
His squire confiding
Beside his rein.
The wine of France is
Aglow to-day
With flash of lances,
With feast and fray,
And dark-eyed glances
Of ladies gay.
See where together,
A flagon near,
Lie hat with feather,
And long rapier
Fine courting weather,
O Cavalier !
Bright Rhenish, gleaming
Moon-white ! Perchance
Thy wave clear-beaming
Still guards Romance,
Not dead, but dreaming
In spell-bound trance !
Not in Rhine-water,
But Rhine-wine fair,
Sir Rupert sought her—
(As bards declare)
The Elf-King’s daughter
With golden hair.
Still ’neath its smiling
Wave’s amber rings,
Men sweetly wiling
From earthly things,
Her song beguiling
The Loreley sings.
Your cup, wild siren,
That Deutschland drains—
Her heart of iron
Moved by your strains—
No blood shall fire in
Australian veins ;
Nor yours whose charm is
Your topaz eyne,
Nor yours whose armies
In gold-caps shine,
Shall charm or harm us—
Eh, comrade mine ?
No vintage alien
For thee or me !
Our fount Castalian
Of poesy
Shall wine Australian,
None other be.
Then place your hand in
This hand of mine,
And while we stand in
Her brave sunshine
Pledge deep our land in
Our land’s own wine.
It has no glamour
Of old romance;
Of war, and armour,
In Spain or France ;
Its poets stammer
As yet, perchance;
But he may wholly
Become a seer
Who quaffs it slowly ;
For he shall hear,
Though faintly, lowly,
Yet sweet and clear
The axes ringing
On mountain sides,
The wool-boats swinging
Down Darling tides,
The drovers singing
Where Clancy rides,
The miners driving,
The stockman’s strife;
All sounds conniving
To show the rife,
Rich, rude, strong-striving
Australian life.
Once more your hand in
This hand of mine !
And, while we stand in
The brave sunshine,
Pledge deep our land in
Our land’s own wine !

The N.S.W. Public Service Board, writes
a Bulletin correspondent, deserves well at the
hands of a long-suffering public, if only for its
hardihood in tackling, and finally bursting, the
notoriously-close religious ring which, in days gone
by, bossed the entrance to a certain ridiculously-
over-manned Govt, department. The writer re-
members with a shudder the solemn churchy atmo-
sphere which pervaded that office and all its doings
in its halcyon days. Everything about the place
bore testimony to the preternatural holiness of its
officials. The very light, streaming in, softly
touched their heads and endowed them with fan-
tastic haloes. The ledgers were not the greasy,
dog-eared vols. to be met with in other Govt,
offices —they had the sanctified appearance of
bibles, and the officials who reverently turned over
their pages wore the smug look of recording
angels. The officers were all dressed in seedy
black,- of the dullest and most sombre hue, save at
the seams and shoulders, which shone like glory.
One felt assured that when they arrived at office
in the morning they pawed each other with
cold, clammy hands, and asked if they were still
Saved, and, perhaps, sang a hymn and had prayers.
Anyhow, they were a snug family, cocksure of a
clear receipt at the final audit when the recon-
structed banks shall finally pay their depositors.
At mid-day they sat apart reading tracts, secretly
pecking at their lunches, and swilling large quan-
tities of cold water. They never spoke, but sniffed
constantly. Even on the office-boy had the un-
earthly blight fallen—he sat alone in a corner
reading a volume of the Rev. E. P. Roe’s, in lieu
of “ Dead wood Dick.”
An Idyll .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The ball-room at Government House is filled with
a brilliantly - plumaged throng. Their Good
Graciousnesses have just entered to the triumphal
strains of the National Anthem, and are distri-
buting nods, smiles, and handshakes to the grate-
ful crowd. White throats and bosoms gleam in
the lamplight—there is a glitter and sparkle of
innumerable diamonds, and here and there a
uniform makes a splash of color amid the sober
black of civilian dress.
A magnificent woman sails into the room. Smil-
ing, decolletee, spick and span from her diamond
tiara to the tip of her satin shoe, Mrs. Tom
Scourings is a perfect type of the well-developed
human animal. As poor little Tom follows her
up the room, he is ridiculously suggestive of a
Manly ferry-boat puffing up the harbor in the
wake of aP.& O. liner. She is soon surrounded
by a crowd of young men —and you may be sure
that little Freddy Tremayne, the A.D.C., is not
far away. He is a smart-looking little chap
is Freddy, always well-groomed, and to-night,
in the tight-fitting, plum-colored uniform of
the Royal Bengal Bouncers, he completely puts
the home-grown youths in the shade. True,
these inferior lights avenge themselves by telling
the girls that Freddy’s' waist derives its slimness
from the fact that he wears stays —but what of
that ! “ They adds to the simmetery ! ” as the
undertaker said when the two new doctors came
to town. Little Tom strolls off, with one or two
other husbands, to find the refreshment-room.
Supper is over, and things are beginning to liven
up a bit. The band is playing kitchen lancers,
and, to the strains of various music-hall melodies,
the dancers fly round and round, panting, laugh-
ing, and thoroughly roused with excitement —and
champagne. And one sees that in spite of the
gorgeous gowns, the diamonds and the dress
clothes, the old barbaric strain in human nature
still asserts itself. The light in these eyes is the
light that is in Hawaiian eyes when the “Hula
Hula ” begins to grow interesting. The music
breaks off in a final burst, and there is a rush for
the cool air of the garden.
Mrs. Tom and Freddy have found a secluded
seat down by the water’s edge, where there is
plenty of room for two people—if they sit the
right way.
And just below them the tiny waves are lap,
lap, lapping against the rocks, beneath the laugh-
ing moon. . . And whispering couples are coo-
ing and chuckling in every shady nook of the
garden.
And little Tom Scourings and some other hus-
bands are talking horse in the supper-room—and
taking terrible liberties with the sweet champagne.
And the band is playing “Home, Sweet Home’'
—with variations.
