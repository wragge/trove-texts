LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
ADONIS AND LOLITA
Sir,
For those concerned that censorship
powers are held by politicians and
policemen perhaps not widely enough
versed in English literature to fit them
for this authority, the following quota-
tion should be of interest. It is an
extract from an essay on “The Myth of
English Literature”, by Aubrey Menen:
“It is easy to read all the pure poetry
Shakespeare ever wrote because there is
not much of it. One of his poems is
‘Venus and Adonis’. It tells . . . how
Venus, a mature woman, attempts to
seduce Adonis, who refuses to be raped.
How old was Adonis? I am sure you
know the correct answer. But if you
have a lingering doubt you will find it
interesting to read stanzas 22, 70, 88,
100, 101 and 102. From these it can
be seen that Adonis could not have been
older than 14. Maybe he was younger.
I cannot say; it is a question for some
experienced doctor to answer. What
Shakespeare makes clear is that Adonis
was near, but had not quite attained,
the age of puberty.
“Now, this poem is on the shelves of
every self-respecting library in the
world. It is in the homes of millions
of clean-living, cultivated and moral
families . . . yet it is both more be-
-Builing and more shocking to staid sen-
sibilities than ‘Lolita’, the celebrated
novel of Mr Nabokov. The difference
between Mr Nabokov’s novel and Wil-
liam Shakespeare’s poem is that every-
body is reading the first and nobody, I
lake it, ever reads the second. I hope
this article will help to change the situ-
ation. I trust that from now on at least
some of the Brahmins of Eng. Lit., who
are so moved by Shakespeare’s verse,
w *ll be found joyously shouting the
stanzas I have listed on windswept
eaches or quoting them, with tears in
heir eyes, to their young pupils in order
o cultivate their taste for the truly
beautiful.”
Further comment would be super-
fluous.

QUEENSLAND'S CABINET
Sir,
Your article from “A Brisbane Cor-
respondent” (25/4/64) on the election
by the State Liberal Parliamentary
members of Mr D. Tooth, MLA, to fill
the Cabinet vacancy caused by the death
of the late Dr H. W. Noble, and the
failure of Mr R. Smith, MLA, to win
this election, contains two mis-state-
ments so palpable and so glaring as to
be nothing short of mischievous.
Your correspondent says that in last
year’s election Mr Smith “increased his
majority without any overt assistance in
his campaign from top party brass”.
This is just not true, and I am sure
Mr Smith would be the first to agree
that it is untrue. He received in Wind-
sor the same efficient and effective
assistance as did other State Liberal
Parliamentary Members, and with them
he enjoyed in 1963 a greater winning
margin than in 1960.
But the mischievous and shocking
charge of an inbuilt anti-Cathohc bias
in the Liberal Party because Mr Smith
did not win Cabinet position calls for
examination. “(Mr Smith) has the dis-
tinction, it is generally believed, of
being the only Roman Catholic in the
Liberal Party since Neal Macgroarty”;
“. . . placate those who suspect, on sta-
tistical grounds, that the Liberal Party
does not want Roman Catholics . . .”
These are the terms your Brisbane cor-
respondent used, and the public record
will demonstrate that they are totally
untrue. They are a good example of
that irresponsible and deliberately mali-
cious type of writing which causes a
growing number of people to question
journalistic pronouncements.
There have been over the years, and
are now, Catholics representing the
Liberal Party in Parliaments and acting
on the Party’s highest organisational
committees.

RETARDED CHILDREN
Sir,
Ann Gruen’s letter (25/4/64) left me
a little dismayed. On the basis of two
retarded children she knows of she sets
out to attack Maurice Benn’s sentence
for child murder a crime regarded
with horror by most civilised people.
Unlike her I am reasonably well in-
formed on the subject of sub-normal
children I have one of my own, a
daughter aged 15i. Also I have been
long associated with special schools for
retarded children, associations and other
bodies working for the welfare of these
children.
Ann Gruen obviously knows nothing
about retarded children. She knows
nothing of the little joys experienced
when fumbling fingers tie their first
knot, or overcome the button. She
knows nothing of the extraordinary
kindness, generosity, gentleness of the
retarded child. She knows nothing of
the kindness and understanding of most
people to the parents of the retarded
child, who believe as most do that these
children have a place in this world.
No, Ann Gruen, the solution is not to
hide them away where they won’t offend
the eye. Nor is the answer to kill them
off. These children need the love and
care of their families; they need the
understanding of the community the\
live in; they need special schools where
they can be taught and trained; they
need sheltered workshops where thev
can work and contribute to the
economy.

AUSTRALIAN WAR HISTORIES
Sir,
In his article “Gallipoli, Then . .."
(25/4/64) M. H. Ellis wrote: “Unlike
the war historians of World War II Witt
their army of aides and authors (C, E
W. Bean) wrote the whole military his-
tory of Australia's overseas land war
personally except for (Gullett’s and
Cutlack’s) volumes.” This suggests that
vastly more authors and a far larger
staff of assistants were employed on the
second Australian war history than oi
the first. In fact, seven authors wrote
the 14 volumes of the Australian War 1
history (15 if you include the pictorial
volume) and 13 wrote the 22 volume!
of the War II history: not a very greal
difference.
As for the “army of aides” that M
H. Ellis’s imagination has uncovered;
C. E. W. Bean started at Tu-ggeranoni
ACT, in 1920 with a staff of nine; the
staff of the War II history when it go;
under way at the old Hospital, Acton
ACT, in 1946 numbered six. The Wat
II history staff at its peak totalled 11.
working in Canberra, Sydney and Mel
bourne.
Today, with four volumes in the prey
or unfinished, a staff of two plus out
part-time worker is engaged on the Wat
II history. In the corresponding period
in the production of War I histon
(1937), when three volumes (two o!
them medical) were still unpublished
there were three on the staff plus a half-
time cartographer.

I am sure I express the feeling of ai

I am that you could allow the publica-

Within the few short months of J

the issue is still sub judice we ar
presented with an allegedly humor®

ENJOY SUPERB HILTON COMFORT AND VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!,
'ou've almost certainly heard about
lilton comfort and hospitality. And
II those nice things you’ve heard
re quite true.
What you may not have heard is
iow very reasonable it all is. What
excellent value you get for your
noney when you enjoy Hilton hos-
litality in any Hilton Hotel or Inn
n one of 27 cities throughout the
Jnited States.
I _..l
Skyline of downtown Houston, Tex.
And here’s what you get for your
money: a comfortable room that’s
fully air-conditioned. Courteous,
helpful service from Hilton person-
nel, many of whom speak your
la nguage and a half-dozen others as
well. And helpful little touches
hke changing your Pounds, Francs,
Guilders or Marks into Dollars.
Food? Ah, here’s where Hilton
hospitality excels itself. You can
en Joy anything from a modestly-
Pnced snack in a Coffee Shop to a
gourmet meal in a fine restaurant in
a ny Hilton Hotel or Inn.
Children? We love them. And to
prove it, there’s no extra charge for
your children who share your room.
So visit the U.S.A.—the Hilton way,
and bring the family along. No
matter what your itinerary, you'll
almost certainly be able to enjoy
Hiltpn hospitality. If you’re visiting
New York for the 1964 World’s Fair,
you can select from among five great
Hilton Hotels. Then, if you decide to
explore California's glorious Pacific
coastline, you’ll find Hilton hospi-
tality at the San Francisco Hilton,
opening May 25, or the Hilton Inn
at San Francisco’s Airport. If Los
Angeles is on your route, there's the
Statler Hilton or the Beverly Hilton.
And if you decide to range over
Texas, you shouldn’t miss the lovely
Shamrock Hilton in bustling Houston
or the Statler Hilton in Dallas.

OIL EXPLORATION
Sir,
Contrary to statements appearing in
your issue of April 25 (J. C. Horsfall,
“The French Oil Report”) and else-
where, the first off-shore licence granted
by the NSW Government was PEL 70,
which is now held, and has been since
1960, by my company, Central Coast
Oil Ltd, and its predecessors.
Whilst a good deal is known con-
cerning the very favorable oil/gas
potential of this part of the coastal
Sydney Basin and the adjoining littoral,
nothing whatever has been done further
out. The fact that the French mission
practically ignored NSW altogether in
its findings means very little; and Shell,
to whom the NSW Mines Minister ap-
proved licence-granting over the area
from Port Stephens to Nowra beyond
the 3-mile limit and in advance of the
resolution of the off-shore question be-
tween the States and Commonwealth,
evidently have quite different opinions.
The work now being planned by the
parties concerned in the exploration and
development of central coastal NSW
landward and seaward if successful
would put this part of Australia in the
box seat, oil/gas-wise.

THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET
Sir,
Mr Kevon Kemp’s review of the
recent season of the Australian Ballet
(2/5/64) must surely rank as the most
ridiculous exhibition of ignorance of
ballet, combined with the worst form of
ill manners, to have ever appeared in
your usually informed columns. I find
it so lacking in relevance to any of the
facts concerning the present company
or the performances of the dancers as
to be what I can only describe as an
hysterical outburst rather than informed
criticism.
Every leading ballet company in the
world invites from time to time guest
stars of world reputation to appear with'
them. No one can seriously believe
that this is in any way derogatory to
the leading dancers of the home-based
company. The very nature of ballet is
international. The only rule is talent.
Our national ballet is struggling to
establish itself; the fact that two of the
world’s greatest dancers are appearing
for a short time with it is a compliment
to its growing reputation and a joy for
all who value fine dancing. Mr Kemp
is hardly making a new revelation in
informing us of the ability of either
Miss Gorham or Miss Jones boij
these fine dancers are household words
amongst an informed theatre public jj
Australia, and it can be nothing but an
embarrassment for an outstanding and
serious dancer to have her work valued
only in terms of “sex appeal” and
“sensual communication”.
Such phrases from the pen of a writer
with ambitions (sadly, I feel, misplaced)
to achieve a standard of informed balk
criticism suggest that Mr Kemp has pen
haps been reading too many lurid
paperbacks of late.
Complete ignorance of the facts are
also revealed in references to the &
Basil Ballet Russe and its great succes
in Australia during the ’thirties. Hit
company did not “take Australia b
storm with the classic style”. At w
time in this or any other country thal
it appeared in did this company preset
a full-length classic ballet. It did, fron
time to time, a potted one-act versioc
of “Swan Lake” and “Aurora’s Wed
ding” but its great success was built ra
a repertoire of Russian character ba!
lets —“Coq d'Or”, “Petroushka”, “Print
Igor”, etc., and on the brilliant deni:
character and symphonic ballets of Mas
sine and Lichine. Such facts, which are
after all, a part of recent ballet history
should be known to any informed criti;

DFRB
Sir,
I would like to second Mr Key’s vot
of confidence in The Bulleti'
(28/3/64) in which he comments:
about possible victimisation of officer!
who have expressed their views in you
magazine. The simple truth is that nt
member of the Forces is permitted ti
communicate with the Press in any shaft
or form without authorisation. Techni-
cally, as a serving officer, this letter coe
stitutes an offence against the Defend
Act.
Mr Key also went on to mention th
“head-in-the-sand” attitude towards tf-
problems of the defence forces. As a:
example of this, there are commandin'
officers who have seen fit to prohib
discussion of the resignation and DFRr
issues in their units. In these units -
minimum of two officers who discus
these problems commit an offence whit
under the Defence Act may be construe 1
as mutiny. This very democratic sys-
tem points to the urgent need for *
union or association for the otherwise
unrepresented Forces.
The general fact that our defences a r jj
in a poor state, and that all is not "j-
-within the Forces, is obvious to tn
public by now, but issues like the DrK
and resignation controversies are only
a couple of the symptoms of the dise as ■
and the attempt to force officers to co
tinue service is rather like appty in J
tourniquet at the neck for a bleed)»
nose.

National Notebook
Way Out West
/George Englund, director of “The
™ Ugly American”, arrived an hour
late for the interview at his Sydney
hotel, wearing green corduroys, a sloppy
pullover and scuffs, and looking for
all the world like a slightly over-age
Commem. Day student. He had spent
part of the day talking with Morris West
at St Ives about a film version of “The
Shoes of the Fisherman” he is planning
to make independently, with release
through M-G-M.
Bright, dodgy, and full of whimsical
humor, Mr Englund seemed less likely
to be embarking on such a solemn
venture than to be about to plunge into
a song-and-dance routine. How, we
asked him, had he first become attracted
to the West project? “I read the book,”
he replied snidely. We said we gathered
that, but what was there in it that had
caught his fancy? As he changed his
shirt and wandered in and out the room,
he waxed more serious.
“The concept is rather
stunning. I read the book
in manuscript West’s
agent in Hollywood gave
it to me. I think it’s a
heroic novel in the tradi-
tional sense of the term, in
the Aristotleian sense. Too many of the
novels I’ve been reading have been about
a girl who becomes a nymphomaniac or
a boy who becomes a homosexual be-
cause they had trouble with parents who
didn’t understand them.
“You know the kind of thing?” We
did. “This is a book in which the central
character is concerned with problems
beyond himself. This is a great drama
of our time. The Pope stands at the
summit of the world. Directly under
God. He is the Vicar of Christ. He
stands in place of the Almighty. It’s
all very, very, very interesting. . .”
All this was spoken in a tone which
Gene Kelly might have used explaining
a tricky dance routine. “There are dif-
ficulties in transmuting the theme. Of
a Catholic modern Pope.” M-G-M had
the book on a verbal, not a written,
option, Mr Englund said, and no con-
tract had been prepared. We asked him
w hy producers hadn’t rushed to buy the
rights from the publishers of a work so
long on the best-seller lists. “Anyone
who rushed to buy those rights straight
away wouldn’t be long in the motion
picture business.”
There were problems with locations
'permission would have to be sought
horn the Vatican to use it for interiors)
and casting. “Of course I’d like St Peter
to play the Pope, but . . .” Mr Englund
shrugged with mock wistfulness; “You’ll
notice ‘The Devil’s Advocate’ hasn’t
been filmed yet, even though Warner’s
did buy it.” Couldn't the interiors be
recreated in Hollywood? “You can’t
recreate the Last Judgment,” Mr Englund
—who was once a beach bum, worked
with Brando on “One-Eyed Jacks” and
played the lead in “Anna Lucasta”—
said with a reproving smile. “The Sistine
Chapel is on its own, I think.” And he
laughed to himself as we crept away.
Case of the Controversial Coffin
Stanley Gardner, best-selling
creator of the world’s most busy-
body attorney, Perry Mason, looks like
becoming involved in a real-life court
drama himself.
In August, 1957, Gardner published an
article in the American glossy “Argosy”
casting doubts on the guilt of a mur-
derer grimly named Wilbur Coffin, who
had been executed the year before for
killing three bear hunters.
With “Argosy’s” pub-
lisher, Gardner formed a
“Court of Last Resort”
which would examine simi-
lar cases where miscar-
riages of justice were sus-
pected.
Now another writer who believes
Coffin innocent Canadian Jacques
Hebert has written a book on the
subject, “I Accuse the Assassins of
Coffin”, and a Commission has been set
up to look into the facts.
Hebert has suggested that Gardner be
called before the Commission with his
file on the case. “The Court of Last
Resort” looks like being taken seriously,
after all.
“Bandicoot”
IY/|arien Dreyer, of King’s Cross,
Sydney, has just won a thousand
pounds by gaining the Journalists’ Club
Award for the best Australian play
written in 1962-63. Eight years ago
Miss Dreyer, a “battler” amongst local
writers, decided that to get a play pro-
duced she would have to win a major
award—and gave herself ten years in
which to do it. She has made it in good
time.
Miss Dreyer generously tagged The
Bulletin’s drama critic, Kevon Kemp,
as the godfather of her play, “Bandicoot
On A Burnt Ridge”, but Kemp admits
only to encouraging from the sidelines.
The play itself, which he has seen from
its first bare synopsis through many
drafts, he describes as powerful and
exciting writing for two players only,

This Week’s Cover
VfTiLLiAM Dobell’s “Irish Boy at
” Marble Arch” (a little-known por-
trait from his London period, admired
by some critics as among his best
paintings) was one of the collection of
18 paintings willed by the late Major
Harold de Vahl Rubin to the Govern-
ment of Israel. Major Rubin owned one
of Australia’s largest and most eclectic
collections of paintings. The 18 to goto
Israel include Australian painters Drys-
dale, Nolan, Roberts and Streeton as well
as a Boudin, a Renoir, a Pissarro and a
Vuillard.
The collection was shown in Sydney
for one day only to help the Eye Health
Appeal. The appeal has now raised
more than the target of £250,000 need-
ed for the first stage of the rebuilt Eye
Hospital. The hospital will eventually
cost £1,250,000 and will rise 12 storeys
on the site of the old hospital at
Woolloomooloo.
“Bandicoot” concerns a frustrated
married couple, suddenly caught in a
glare of publicity and TV lights by being
on the fringe of a notorious crime. The
lights are, however, a little too much
for them exposing all the unswept
corners of their lives, and when the
brilliance is just as suddenly switched
off the wife makes a fresh, tragic attempt
at fame and immortality.

Red Line, or Yellow Line?
books provide so rich a clue
A to the censorship comedy of
contemporary Australia as “The
Thin Red Line.” Originally
released by Senator Denham Henty,
the Minister for Customs, against
the advice of his usually enlightened
Advisory Censorship Board, it was
then attacked and banned by various
libraries—whose powers of indirect
censorship are often underestimated
—and has finally been recognised as
a work of moderate literary merit.
At this point, many months later,
Victoria’s famous Vice Squad, ap-
parently still having no vice to worry
about in Melbourne, has warned
sellers against handling it. This time
they were even more subtle than in
the recent case of Mary McCarthy’s
“The Group”. Then they acted
openly; now it is not clear exactly
how they operated. Someone from
the Squad questioned one bookseller
about it and immediately almost
all the booksellers withdrew the
book. The book is no longer on sale,
but the chief of the Vice Squad can
still announce that his Squad has not
warned booksellers against selling
it. He added, however, that if any-
one did sell it the position would be
reviewed!
Apart from the disgrace of the
Vice Squad’s conduct, there are two
other disappointing features of the
affair. The first is the craven beha-
vior of most booksellers. One boo
from the Vice Squad and they run
for cover, regardless of their respon-
sibility to insist on the rights of
people concerned with books. The
second is the inactivity of the much
publicised Freedom to Read As-
sociation. It has made all sorts of
statements but appears to have done
nothing of any real significance.
What has happened to its determina-
tion to fight the Vice Squad in court?
Is it really bluffed by the possibility
that the Vice Squad would not use
the Police Offences Act against a
seller of the book—with a mere
fine as the possible penalty—but
would use the common law of ob-
scene libel—with the possible pen-
alty of a gaol sentence? With so
many prominent people in the As-
sociation—professors and the like
—could not one of them sell the
book and dare the Vice Squad to
gaol him? Surely not even those in-
famous policemen would be so fool-
hardy in an election year.
In the past, as soon as a censor
went too far, the critics of censor-
ship would immediately announce
the sale of the proscribed book on
such and such a corner at such and
such a time. There were many
court cases, many defeats, but
ultimate victory. This is what should
be done now. What on earth are
these distinguished Freedom-lovers
doing?
Maphilindo
ORITISH Foreign Secretary
R. A. Butler’s smooth state-
ments in Manila that he would
like to see “Asians settle Asian
affairs” and that he would also like
to see Maphilindo revived can be
interpreted in various ways and
doubtless the busy dialecticians of
Djakarta are doing just that. But
Mr Butler’s words should be taken
in conjunction with other words
uttered at the same time and in the
same place that the integrity of
Malaysia must be respected and
that Britain will honor its defence
commitments to Malaysia until
such time as it is allowed to live in
peace with its more powerful
neighbors. The significance of Mr
Butler’s statement was that it was
made in Manila, the capital of an
Asian country which has got itself
increasingly involved in a dispute
from which it can hope to gain very
little and is, in fact, losing a great
deal.
In his articles on President Maca-
pagal (last week’s issue and this
week’s), Alex Josey, who knows him
well, points out various reasons for
President Macapagal’s involvement
in the Malaysia dispute—fear of the
large Chinese population in Malay-
sia, his burgeoning sense of Filipino
nationalism, his resentment of the
way in which the British shrugged
off the Sabah claim and so on. But
when all is said and done the
Malaysia dispute remains a very
strange and self-destructive affair
for the Philippines to have be-
come so deeply involved in. In
opposing Malaysia on the issue of
the claims to Sabah the Philippines
is not only opposing a new, close
neighbor, peopled like itself by
Malays, but it also is ranged against
Britain, America, Australia and
New Zealand which are its close
allies in SEATO.
The Filipino stand on Malaysia
seems largely to be inspired by the
personal convictions and prejudices
of President Macapagal. His policy
is opposed by his own Vice-Presi-
dent and by many Filipinos who
are not greatly exercised by the
Sabah claims and fear the unpre-
dictable consequences of being in-
creasingly involved in Indonesia’s
confrontation. In fact the current
Filipino stand is a remarkable ex-
ample of how one man on a largely
artificial issue can gradually
manoeuvre a nation, government
and people into fixed positions from
which it becomes increasingly dif-
ficult to retreat.
While it may be true that Presi-
dent Macapagal is correct in seeing
himself as one of the last external
moderating influences on President
Soekarno it is also apparent that he
has growing doubts as to where
President Soekarno is leading him.
Hence his unwearying efforts to
bring about yet another Summit
meeting and the Malaysian-Filipino
agreement to exchange consulates.
This at least is a heartening sign
that both President Macapagal and
his advisers are aware of the final
traps of confrontation which shows
no signs of relenting and some sign f
of increasing.

CANBERRA
Reform for
The Armed Services?
Breaking the resistance of the Public Service
SHANE PALTRIDGE
Up to the mark
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
HThe Federal Cabinet is now prepared
■*" to give the Armed Services every-
thing within reason they want in
order to mount a worthwhile recruiting
scheme. Whether this mood continues
depends on: (a) the capacity of Defence
Minister Shane Paltridge to keep Cabinet
up to the mark; and (b) the capacity of
individual Cabinet Ministers to resist
the psychological pressure of those Com-
monwealth bureaucrats who regard
Servicemen, not as fellow public servants
but an inferior caste that ought to be
kept at levels below those of their white-
collared superiors.
Just how much the poor recruiting
figures and the avidity of men to get out
of the Services as soon as the oppor-
tunity presents itself owes to this attitude
on the part of some members of the
bureaucracy remains to be seen. But
Harry Turner (Liberal, NSW), Frank
Davis (Liberal, Vic.), John England
(CP, NSW) and others voiced their un-
easiness at the joint meeting of the Gov-
ernment parties last week. Phil Stokes
(Liberal, Vic.), John Jess (Liberal, Vic.)
and others have voiced similar uneasiness
before them.
The complaints they have listed may
sound minor. They relate to pensions,
housing, the long delays that Service-
men have before they can extract from
the Commonwealth education payments
for their children, and to which they are
entitled, the different treatment of
Servicemen from other public servants
proper, and the like. But they all add
up to annoyances that convince Service-
men—with some justification—that they
are regarded as an inferior caste.
A public servant can get a living allow-
ance, for example, with far less paper
work than a Serviceman. If he returns
from overseas, the public servant can
keep his family in a hotel longer than a
Serviceman newly returned from, say,
Malaysia before he finds alternative
quarters, and he gets better financial
treatment from his Commonwealth em-
ployer while he is at the hotel.
The list goes on and on. So many
Servicemen want to retire from the
Services and get into civilian life that
recently the stage was reached that the
Commonwealth refused to accept
officers’ resignations.
In last week's joint Party meeting
Paltridge handsomely gave his predeces-
sor, Paul Hasluck (moved a fortnight
ago from the Defence portfolio into Ex-
ternal Affairs) credit for drawing up the
blueprint that will —unless those public
servants who insist that Servicemen are
a lesser breed get their way—provide a
new deal for Servicemen. But Paltridge
seems to be taking the realistic view that
if a community is prosperous it cannot,
without conscription, have Armed
Services that do not participate in the
prosperity and high standards.
As I see it, the Government has two
problems: (1) the problem of the
Serviceman who sees himself getting a
worse deal than his fellow public servant
in mufti; and (2) the problem of attract-
ing recruits to the Services in a com-
munity in which there is full employ,
ment. Paltridge told the joint Govern-
ment Parties meeting that he had a
“catalogue” of things that he believed
had to be corrected before the Service-
man was convinced that he was getting
fair treatment. Included in this “cata-
logue” obviously must be pay allowances
and pension anomalies, though these may
come as the second step after the removal
of irritating caste distinctions.
The wider problem—that of attracting
recruits from a full employment economy
—is more complex. The Government
seems to be approaching this on the basis
that the Services may have to provide
more intensive training from their 'own
resources. If a man knows that the
longer he stays in the Services the bettei
equipped he will be to hold his own very
successfully when he goes back into
civilian life, the longer he is likely to
stay in the Services. Then, if he goes
out fully trained, he not only adds skills
to the civilian community but the Gov-
ernment is in the happy position of
knowing that there is a reserve of
Service-trained men upon whom it cat
draw in the event of an emergency.
There is no guarantee that Paltridge
will get his proposed reforms,, even the
milder ones, acted on. He has to breaks
strong psychological resistance on the
part of some civilian public servants.
But the fact that a “catalogue” of
Servicemen’s reasonable complaints has
been prepared and will reach Cabinet
within three weeks is a step in the right
direction.
THE SERVICES
The Right to Resign
Captain Marks v. the Commonwealth
FROM DAVID MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
npHE fate of about 100 Regular Army
officers was still uncertain when
the full High Court reserved its decision
on a test case heard in Melbourne last
week. Captain Mervyn A. Marks,
formerly of a survey regiment based at
Bendigo, was challenging the Common-
wealth over the right to have his resigna-
tion accepted.
His counsel was Mr G. Lush, Q.C.,
whose excellent but expensive services
are being financed through a trust fund
set up by the officers to back the case
and subscribed to by officers from all
Services. For the Commonwealth was the
Solicitor-General, Sir Kenneth Bailey,
Q.C. The Bench comprised Justices Kitto,
Taylor, Menzies, Windeyer and Owen,
The Captain's case rested mainly on
Section 17 (1) of the Defence Act which
says—“ Except during time of war,
officer may, in writing under his own
hand, tender the resignation of his com-
mission at any time by giving three
months’ notice.” Basically, Capta ,n
Marks claimed this statement impl' eJ
that the Governor-General would accept
his resignation.
Mr Lush said the proposition that a #
signation could not be effected by m ere i


tendering it rested on a slender line of
authority stemming from two cases re-
lating to service in the East India Co.
contested around 1769. He pointed out
it was trite law for the Crown to be able
;o terminate commissions at will; this
necessarily led to the concept that it must
also accept resignations.
Of course, if the High Court does find
in favor of Marks, this will not neces-
sarily mean that the 100 officers will be
automatically resigning. In the first place
;he case is mainly an attempt to assert
their “rights” and, if they are successful,
resignation will not necessarily follow,
Second, there is the almost certain
possibility of truth in the rumors that
amendments are being considered for the
Defence Act to counteract any decision
in favor of Marks,
Last is the hope that all this hullabaloo
will result in better pay and conditions
for Army officers. These men are severely
limited promotion-wise after 40 because
of the pyramid structure of Army oppor-
tunity.
CENSORSHIP
“The Thin Red Line”
Almost invisible
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A. RYLAH
No action?
The weird nature of Victoria’s censor-
A ship arrangements again became
apparent last week as a result of the
mystery of “The Thin Red Line”, a novel
with a war-time setting by US writer
James Jones. The novel has been on
sale since last year when Senator Henty,
the Minister for Customs, ordered its
release, but last week most Melbourne
booksellers deemed it prudent to with-
draw it from sale, even though the Chief
Secretary, Mr A. Rylah, stated that
police had not, to the best of his know-
ledge, taken any action against it.
However, Mr Peter Darby, manager
of general books at Robertson and
Mullen’s, told The Bulletin that his
firm had withdrawn the book from sale
following a warning from the police. “It
was not clear who warned us,” he added.
At this stage other city bookshops, in-
cluding Cheshire’s and the Austral, were
still selling the book. When word spread
that Robertson and Mullen’s were play-
ing safe, these and other shops withdrew
it from sale, even though they had not
even received as much as the vague hint
that came to R. and M. from the police.
However, a spokesman for Collins
Book Depot Pty Ltd, Mr G. Zifcak,
said his firm had gone on selling the
book at the time when other booksellers
Were pulling it off their shelves. Collins
were not selling it late last week, for the
reason that their stocks were exhausted.
Meanwhile, Mr R. C. Stein, Victorian
Manager of William Collins (Overseas),
who distribute the work, pointed out that
any suggestion of police interest in the
book would cause many booksellers to
drop it.
The Chief of the Vice Squad, Sgt.
Miller, added to a confused situation by
stating that the Squad had not warned
booksellers about “The Thin Red Line”.
However, he added, that if the book
went back into circulation in Victoria,
the situation would be reviewed!
Mr Rylah’s statement of last week that
police had not taken any action on the
book seemed to contradict an earlier
statement on March 25 in the Legislative
Assembly when he listed the novel as
one of three on which booksellers had
been warned. (The other two were “The
Group” and “The Song of the Red
Ruby”.)
“The Thin Red Line” has not aroused
the same interest as “The Group” ban-
ning, but it is an even better case-history
of Victoria’s furtive, hole-in-the-corner
controls over literature. Anonymous
policemen speak to booksellers and some-
times, apparently, to relatively junior
sales staff. As a result a book is quite
effectively banned. Meanwhile Govern-
ment leaders and responsible police
officials can issue double-talk denials
that anything has been banned.
The president of the Freedom to Read
Association, Professor Hector Monro,
last week condemned the ban on “The
Thin Red Line” and spoke of it as a
book with a serious literary purpose. The
Association has been involved for some
weeks in a study of the legal framework
within which Victorian censorship oper-
ates, but as yet has not moved to test
the laws at any point. It intends to bring
the literary censorship question into the
State elections in June.
TASMANIA
Post-mortem
What happened to the DLP?
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
Country Party has received a set-
A back to its plans for the Senate
election later this year as a result of
the party’s poor performance in the
recent Tasmanian elections. Federal
leaders of the CP actively encouraged
the Tasmanian branch’s revival last year
with an eye to Senator George Cole’s
shaky seat as the electoral plum for
their efforts.
Not only did the Country Party fail
to win a seat, but its State-wide vote of
only 5.3 per cent is not enough to
capture one Senate seat. The Liberal
Party, in a move to avoid Country
Party pressure for a joint Senate team,
rushed through Senate nominations for
a three-man team only a week before
the State poll.
Since the Country Party’s failure in
the State poll both the Liberal and
Labor Parties are more confident of
winning Senator Cole’s seat and thereby
depriving the DLP of its last remaining
representative in a Federal Parliament.
Even though the Country Party’s vote
was disappointing, it could still gain
a Senate seat with the aid of Labor.
Will Labor support the CP in the Senate
elections and therefore secure the estab-
lishment of a second non-Labor political
force in Tasmania or should it support
the Liberal Party and just be satisfied
with the revenge defeat of Senator
George Cole?
Senator Cole is disappointed with the
State poll results not so much as a
guide to his own chances his Senate
vote has never had much relation to
the DLP’s State vote but as a sign
of collapsing DLP morale and organi-
sation. Even though it fielded fewer can-
didates this time this will not explain
a drop from 5.3 per cent of the vote
in 1959 to 2.4 in 1964.
The sorry state of the Tasmanian DLP
was revealed publicly just before the
State poll when an influential section of
the party wanted preferences to go to
the ALP. The State leader, Mr Percy
Senior, led the revolt, but Senator Cole
won the day with a plea that a change
in preferences at this stage would only
harm the DLP in the Victorian elections
next month. The State executive reached
a compromise and directed preferences
to independent Liberals sympathetic to
State aid to non-State schools in three
of the five electorates. On top of this
situation there are strained relations be-
tween the National Civic Council and
the DLP State executive.


ANGLICANISM
The Vehement Vicar
of North Balwyn
Against the “Sales Chart Guzzle”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
E. BUTLER
A clash
Rev. J. P. Stevenson, vicar of St
Silas’ Church of England, North Bal-
wyn, has emerged as one of Melbourne’s
most vigorous and forthright clergymen
since he came here from the wheat-
belt parish of Wongan Hills (Western
Australia) in 1959. Before that Rev.
Stevenson, now 54, had some fifteen
years experience as a British Army
chaplain in occupied Germany, and
during the war in Algeria, the Middle
East and Italy. An Oxford Master of
Arts, his interests are extremely wide.
He is a Fellow of the Society of Antiqu-
arians of Scotland, a member of the
London Athenaeum Club, a writer and
one-time contributor to the “New States-
man” and “The Spectator”.
There is a great deal of the tradition-
alist and the patrician about Rev. Ste-
venson, but there is also a lot that is
fiercely radical. His experiences abroad
have left him acutely aware of world
refugee problems, both in Europe and
Asia, and of the contrast between Aus-
tralian affluence and the poverty which
is the lot of most of mankind.
In North Balwyn, in the very heart
of Melbourne’s executive territory, he
denounced from his pulpit the expense-
account way of life in a sermon on “the
Sales Chart Guzzle”. Reminding his
affluent congregation of the mass pover-
ty in other countries, he said: “For too
many top executives, expense-account
eating and drinking with customers is
a menace to health and often to family
life. This is certainly true of an area
like North Balwyn.” On another oc-
casion he attacked the “White Australia
Policy”, and hooligans replied by paint-
ing a sixty-foot slogan in paint on the
footpath outside his vicarage, “Steven-
son the Traitor Fool Traitor”. He
figured in a notable clash with Eric D.
Butler over anti-Semitism and was one
of the group who withdrew from the
ANZ Peace Congress of 1959 when it
was revealed as a Communist front.
Feeling rose against him last Septem-
ber when he arranged a ceremony at his
church to unveil a piece of the key-
stone of lona Abbey, Scotland, which
had been presented to St Silas’ by the
Presbyterian trustees at lona. At the
service the sermon was preached by
Dr A. C. Watson (Presbyterian), the les-
son was read by a Methodist and rep-
resentatives of the Lutheran and Ukrai-
nian Orthodox churches also took part.
Many of his parishioners were enraged
by this ecumenical gesture.
He has also drawn criticism for his
use of “hotted up” hymns and rhythm
groups to attract young people to his
church.
So the Vestry decided to silence him.
They carried an involved resolution with
the aim of preventing him from making
any public statements. He was asked
to “refrain from any publicity, either
written or verbal, with newspapers of
all classes, local Press, periodicals or
magazines, TV and radio, without first
submitting the suggested news release to
an advisory committee.”
He was not silenced for long. Apart
from writing to his Archbishop, Dr
Woods, who is at present in England,
he sought legal advice in Sydney. Armed
with this he made it known last week
that he would continue to speak out.
“I assented with shame then took
legal advice and recanted,” he explain-
ed. “I acted this little drama on a wide
stage to vindicate three principles.”
These principles relate to the right of
an incumbent “to speak out fearlessly
in the cause of righteousness”.
“If the Church is to face the chal-
lenge of our day and age with creative
thinking, most of it must come from the
clergy and some of it if it is really
creative will inevitably offend some
people.”
TAKEOVERS
Takeover Fever
Back to Rough Range Days
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HThe scene on ’change was as hectic as
any since the Rough Range oil boom
in 1953. Neither the Australian Biscuit
Company nor Nabisco was prepared to
lose a trick in their struggle to acquire
Victorian biscuit-maker Swallow and
Ariell, when their respective brokers,
Were’s and Potter’s, set about a bidding
match on the Melbourne Stock Exchange
last week to entice Swallow’s shareholders
to part with their shares on the open
market.
With speculators joining in to pick up
crumbs from the oscillations in prices as
first one and then the other broker left
the floor to lick his wounds and get fresh
instructions the duel was as dour as any
isince their match for Georges three years
ago, which Potter’s won. By late Friday
Were’s had got enough shares (53 per
cent) for the ABC to win the day, but at
a price which seemed out of all propor-
tion to the intrinsic value of the acquisi-
tion. In a matter of weeks the market
value of Swallow’s had nearly quadrupled.
As the Marketing Director of Swal-
lows put it, the company came in with
the gold rush of the 1850 s and seemed
to be going out with a gold rush on the
Stock Exchange. “We’re as happy as larks
down here”, said what is known as a
‘ senior forelady ’ at the Port Melbourne
factory, “isn’t it marvellous to think our
firm is so popular!”
INDUSTRY
The Gap
Opposition from the
building unions
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
series of meetings this month will
have to make far-reaching decisions
on a scheme for the training of skilled
tradesmen to cover the “apprenticeship
gap”. It will affect the lives of many
thousands.
The meetings of trade union officials
will help formulate the ACTU's attitude
to the Government’s supplementary
training scheme to increase the number
of tradesmen.
However, tensions and vested interests
could threaten the implementation of
the scheme even though the Federal
Department of Labor, under its Minister,
William McMahon, has handled the
whole project carefully and intelligently.
The Government proposals provide for
adult entry into trades after six months
intensive training in technical colleges
followed by a further period of two years
on-the-job training. Allowances would
be paid to trainees and they would get
the full tradesman’s rates during the two
years on-the-job training.
The need for such a scheme is based
on the argument that Australia, at its
present rate of industrial development
and population growth, should be train-
ing about 30,000 apprentices a year, but
at present is only providing 20,000.
Apart from the crisis situation in many
of the smaller trades the big-numbers


deficits are in the engineering, electrical
and building trades.
To an extent, particularly in the build-
ing industry, the “apprentice gap” is a
result of employers being reluctant to
take on obligations. Government pres-
sure and a sustained campaign led to
an increase of about thirty per cent in
the number of apprentices being taken
on over the last six months.
As well as filling the gap, the supple-
mentary scheme should provide an im-
portant function of helping those who
have made a wrong vocational choice or
drifted into a dead-end job.
There have been scattered stoppages
directed against the scheme and some
union protests, mainly from the building
trades unions where Communist in-
fluence is strong. Last week 200 appren-
tices held a protest rally outside Parlia-
ment House, Canberra.
After the rally Mr McMahon issued
a statement stressing that the new scheme
was supplementary to the existing appren-
ticeship scheme. But it is clear that main
trade union opposition will come from
the building trades groups. Their sus-
picions are based on two main grounds;
claims, largely true, that employers in that
industry have not done enough to attract
apprentices and a deeper suspicion that
old, time-honored structures of training
and status might be changed.
Something of a precedent for the adult
training has been set in the acceptance
within the engineering electrical trades
for briefer apprenticeship periods for
older youths. Last November the unions
accepted 3 and 3i year apprenticeships
for more highly educated 17 to 20 year
old youths.
With that precedent, there are strong
hopes that the ACTU will agree.
UNIVERSITIES
Back to Student Politics
Chasing tax cuts
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
all the fuss, flurry, folly and
"" fury of Sydney University’s Com-
memoration Day was filling the news-
paper pages last week the National
Union of University Students, which,
with 68,000 members, is one of the big-
gest representative organisations in Aus-
tralia, was providing quiet but dramatic
proof that students can do more than
riot. Firstly, officers of NUAUS (as the
jargon initials go) successfully completed
negotations for an international seminar
to be held in Sydney early in July with
’ delegates from 50 nations which will
mark the final passing of the influence of
the so-called apathetic student genera-
tion of the 19505.
The title of the seminar, “Students and
Political Action”, would have been un-
thinkable during the later years of the
late decade when Australian students,
in full retreat from the hectic Com-
munist and anti-Communist machines,
lived by the slogan of “apoliticism”.
But the last few years have seen Aus-
tralian students taking stands on issues
like apartheid.
The organisation of the seminar re-
presents a victory for the NUAUS after
a defeat suffered when the International
Students Conference was sent to New
Zealand late in June. The President of
NUAUS, Mr Robert MacDonald, argued
that Australia did not get the prestigious
conference because of Afro-Asian stu-
dent suspicion of the White Australia
policy.
On the home front the NUAUS has
organised itself better than most trade
unions to present a case for tax con-
cessions on fees and extra expenses. Out
of the 68,000 university students about
24,000 are part-timers, earning some
sort of salary, but for the majority pay-
ing their own fees.
Until now there have been no con-
cessions for those students. Also there
are other anomalies on taxation, e.g., the
relatively low allowable deduction ' for
parents, and the under 21 limit, exclu-
ding people like medical students. The
students’ case has been worked out by
a firm of chartered accountants and is
being backed by mass surveys.
Rising fees at universities have made
the plight of the part-time students
even more serious. It affects not only the
evening student because many students
take holiday work at which they find
themselves taxed at a rate which takes
no account of their heavy fees.

BUSINESSMEN
Underpaid
Directors?
One in ten over 70
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Tt is going rather too far to say that
accountants dominate the board
rooms of Australia, but as they are chair-
men of 63 of the 240 NSW public com-
panies included in a recent survey by
management consultant, Beckingsale and
Co., and comprise 20 per cent of the
837 non-executive directors in these com-
panies, obviously they have a consider-
able say in company direction, but not
as big as straight-out businessmen who
had 28 per cent of the non-executive
directors and 55 per cent of the chair-
men.
Against this, one must take into
account that a number of accountants
were brought in to salvage company
victims of various credit squeezes over
the years, particularly after the last one,
but the survey doesn’t say how many
of these were included in the sample.

portrait of a pioneer! . . . the first of 5,000,000!
You are looking at the grizzled, steely
features of a true Australian pioneer—
a pioneer with a long record of service
to the community. It is the original
EMMCO electricity meter made by an
all-Australian venture—the Electricity
Meter Manufacturing Company—better
known today as Email. And here the
meter you see assumes significance of
a special kind.
For today, Emmco has grown and diver-
sified beyond recognition, it became
one of the founding companies of the
vast group of electrical and industrial
manufacturers called Email. The one
meter has become many: in fact, the
meters that measure the water that
comes in your tap, the phone calls you
make, the gas your stove uses—even
the minutes you park your car—are all
relatives of the pioneer meter that is
illustrated here.
They are typical of the way in which
Email and its other activities touch
your way of life every day—quietly,
unobtrusively but with a proud record
of service to Australia.

It may be nearer the mark to say
that most accountants find their way on
to company boards because of their pro-
fessional expertise rather than because
as a class they are particularly adept at
the entrepreneur’s function. After all,
profit and loss accounts and balance
sheets are their bread and butter. Indeed
it is often suggested that, because they
are too close to the figures and too far
from the adventuresome horizon, they
exert a stultifying effect on enterprise,
so that profitability of companies could
well be in inverse proportion to their
numbers on company boards. The
survey does not cover this point, nor does
it in any way relate profitability to the
professional composition or size.
More revealing perhaps than the
make-up (only ten women directors in
the 240 companies) and size of boards
(average six members compared with 11
in the United States) is their strong
family flavor. In 46 per cent of the com-
panies the founder of the company was
a director, and 40 per cent of the com-
panies had founders as chairman (point-
ing both to industry’s youth and paternal-
ism). In about a third of the companies
the chairman was also managing direc-
tor, though the number of founders
among these is not stated.
An the survey’s showing, nobody can
say that the pure directorial function
is highly paid. Half of the directors
received less than £450 a year for their
services. But against this, nearly two-
thirds of the non-executive directors are
members of more than one board, and
there is sometimes a fine line between the
pure directorial function and the execu-
tive one, which of course is usually
highly rewarded.
As to age, only one of the companies
has an age limit for directors, one
director in ten is over seventy and the
greater number are between 50 and 60.
Pertinent to the question whether it
is feasible for companies to issue more
frequent profit statements, the survey
shows that in more than two-thirds of
the companies a profit and loss account
(which is unlikely to be audited, one
presumes) is prepared for each monthly
m eeting of directors and in the case of
roost of the others a written report from
'he chief executive is submitted.
Apropos of the transmission of board
decisions to the stock exchanges, it is
rovealed that the average board meets
(once a month) in the morning for two
1° three hours, so normally one would
expect the stock exchange to receive
decisions well within its trading hours.
,n the light of this, it may be asked
whether some companies have been with-
olding immediate transmission of
ecisions to the stock exchange to
| ensure their full coverage in the morn-
lnB dailies.


New Guinea's Elections
Ahead of Popular Demand — But Dull
In New Hanover , Lyndon Johnson couldn't he drafted
By KONEDOBU
The Returning Officer for remote
lalibu electorate in the primitive
Southern Highlands of Papua put
down his pencil and confirmed to his
weary colleagues and bored scrutineers
that Mr Koitagu Mano of Komuga, an
erstwhile Government interpreter, had
romped home. Mr Koitagu’s 11,488
votes exceeded the combined total of
those cast for his eight opponents. Said
the RO solemnly, “He’s got an absolute
majority, thank God.”
Declaration of the lalibu poll marked
what the New Guinea Administration
anxiously hopes is the close of the Terri-
tory’s first common roll elections. They
may also prove to be New Guinea’s
most sedate elections. If the art of
primitive dependency administration is
to keep a jump ahead of the popular
demand, its practice is also conducive
to dullness. The seeds of New Guinea
nationalism have doubtless been plant-
ed, but the elections demonstrated
pretty convincingly that they have yet
to sprout. Even in the townships the
patterns of political awareness were
markedly uneven. Sophisticated clerks
who had argued about electoral boun-
daries queued at polling booths with
illiterate migrant workers who insisted
on voting as abentees for tribal leaders
back in Chimbu because they suspected
that involving themselves in urban
politics might irrevocably commit them
to an urban existence. The composite
ballot paper, covering both the ‘‘open”
and “special” seats, promoted some
confusion and the optional preferential
system was used erratically.
Back in the villages, most of the
mountaineers went to the polls with
pretty clear ideas on whom they
wanted, but with only the haziest
notions of the constitutional significance
of the electoral operation. During pre-
ceding weeks they had been registered
and told how' to vote; they had been
exhorted by their spiritual mentors to
vote wisely; they had mildly enjoyed
the diversions afforded by campaigning
candidates. When the mobile polling
booths came around, about 70 per cent
of the voters dutifully turned out,
patiently waited their turns to vote,
politely solicited assistance from elec-
toral officers when in difficulties, and
quietly padded back home.
There were a few oddities. In the
Eastern Highlands the peripatetic red
ballot boxes became associated wfith an
outbreak of Asian flu. On New Han-
over, where a US survey team had
been recently working, it required a
visit by the District Commissioner from
Kavieng to convince the electors that
President Lyndon Johnson was not
available to be drafted. In widely
separated electorates of Madang Dis-
trict blocs of voters nostalgically
plumped for a former cult leader who
was soundly trounced in his home area.
But by and large, with relatively few
disruptions to electoral schedules from
rain and flooded rivers, operation Com-
mon Roll went off pretty smoothly.
The electoral campaigning was de-
finitely torpid. With no Party machinery
to organise rallies, peddle policy
choices, and generate some communal
fervor, the essential problem facing
each candidate was how to project him-
self as a charismatic personality. Few
succeeded in doing so. Most aspirants
for public office, politically inexperi-
enced and lacking financial resources,
were content to make one or two quiet
little tours and solicit support on a
basis of personal acquaintance. It was,
perhaps, unfortunate that throughout
the electioneering period controversial
local issues were in singularly short
supply.
All the candidates, brown and white,
perforce made much the same
approaches. Correctly gauging that few
votes w'ere to be won through harangu-
ing leisure-loving subsistence gardeners
on the futility of political advancement
without increased economic production,
they preached no hard doctrines. Play-
ing it safe, they mostly stuck to vague
promises to attract into their elector-
ates larger chunks of the development
and welfare funds provided by the Aus-
tralian taxpayer. Inevitably, their voices
lacked conviction.
Mr Koriam Urekit, contesting the
East New Britain open seat, is reported
to have been more enterprising. A
former village tul-tul who was gaoled
for his part in a cargo-cult outbreak
shortly after the Pacific War, he is sus-
pected of having embellished his cam-
paign speeches with non-Keynesian
economic concepts. He was elected
with a thumping majority, and the
Catholic Bishop of the region has ex-
pressed misgivings.
By and large, the candidates also re-


sisted the temptation to enliven pro-
ceedings by attacking each other. As
it was, competing tribal leaders fre-
quently campaigned in company (in cer-
tain areas the Administration assisted
them with transport) and at their joint
meetings modestly deferred to each
other with the grave courtesy instilled
by a Stone Age upbringing. It was left
to 20th-century Australian elements to
strike some tardy sparks. Immediately
after he had been declared the winner
of the South Markham (Special) seat,
Mr Graham Gilmore, who runs the
Kainantu pub, threatened to sue Mr
Mick Casey, who finished third in the
three-man contest, for defamation. It
is understood that Mr Casey, in the
course of some vigorous Melanesian
Pidgin speeches to Kainantu electors,
queried the worth of Mr Gilmore’s
contribution to the local economy and
invoked coarse Australian agricultural
imagery in impugning Mr Gilmore’s
veracity. Tempers have since cooled.
To be white is to win
Tt is Mr Casey, however, who has
occasioned the Administration most
concern. He has given notice of his
intention to invest £SO in an appeal to
the Court of Disputed Returns to have
the South Markham election declared in-
valid on the grounds that Mr Gilmore
did not poll an absolute majority of the
votes cast. Mr Casey might have a
case. Sections 161 and 162 of the 1963
Territory Electoral Ordinance, which
deal with the counting of votes, follow
Australian legislation in providing that
after the progressive elimination of
candidates and the distribution of pre-
ferences, “the candidate who has re-
ceived an absolute majority of votes
shall be elected.” An “absolute major-
ity of votes” is defined as “a greater
number than one-half of the whole
number of ballot papers (other than
informal ballot papers) including ex-
hausted ballot papers . . .” In drafting
these sections, the Administration’s law-
yers obviously overlooked the possibility
that with the Territory’s modified pre-
ferential system, which validates ballot
papers on which only one choice has
been marked, a winning candidate in a
contest involving more than two persons
m ay well finish up with less than half
of the total votes cast. While the Secre-
tary for Law has made reassuring
noises that legal interpretation of the
suspect clauses must pay regard to the
overall intention of the legislation, the
Chief Electoral Officer has glumly ad-
mitted that in at least 20 of the 54
se ats contested, the winner polled less
than haif of the total votes cast. It now
remains to be seen whether Mr Casey
will carry out his threat. (He has two
rnonths in which to make up his mind.)
“ he does, and his appeal is upheld,
other disappointed candidates could set
in train a flurry of expensive by-
elections, which would be embarrassing
to the Government and exceedingly
confusing to the indigenous population.
The Administration is reported to re-
gard the potentialities sufficiently
seriously to have sent a non-official
emissary to Mr Casey, requesting him
not to proceed.
The prediction made in these columns
(Bulletin, January 11) that whites
might win up to eight of the open seats
proved fairly accurate. Six Australians
(three of them in primitive Highlands
electorates) managed to persuade brown
voters that they would make better poli-
ticians than local tribal leaders. Three
of the successful six are ex-patrol
officers an interesting commentary
on Dr Murray Groves’ recent criticisms
of the oppressively colonialist attitudes
of the Department of Native Affairs.
The other three winners are Mr Keith
Levy, a Mt Hagen coffee grower, and
Mr Keith Tetley, a trader and crocodile
shooter domiciled in the damp (up to
300 inches per year) Kikori region of
Gulf District, and Mr Bill Bloomfield
of Wau, described as a driller and
tester.
Only two of the 12 indigenous mem-
bers (6 elected, 6 nominated) of the
last Legislative Council have been re-
turned. At Milne Bay, Mr John
Guise (Bulletin, January 11), who
allegedly campaigned on a platform of
“don't elect a white man”, overwhelmed
businessman Bob Bunting. In New
Ireland, Mr Nicholas Brokam, a quiet
fellow with solid Mission support, re-
tained his seat, narrowly defeating a
local planter, Pitamari the handle
selected by Mr Peter Murray for the
ballot papers. One of the surprises of
the elections was the virtual eclipse of
many apparently well-entrenched native
leaders. This was particularly notice-
able amongst New Britain’s relatively
advanced Tolais. Well-known figures
like Tovin Bainig, Nason Tokiala and
Tomari all men whose post-war ser-
vices in the local government and eco-
nomic development fields had greatly
assisted the Tolais to achieve their pre-
sent status of being New Guinea’s most
affluent indigenous society were
badly beaten. The successful candi-
dates in the two Tolai-dominated open
seats were Mr Matthias Toliman, a
Catholic Mission school teacher, and
Mr Koriam Urek.it, previously mention-
ed in these comments. Granted that
the old leadership was politically naive
in allowing conflicting personal ambi-
tions to split the vote, its chief stum-
bling block could well have been the
Tolai mistrust of tall poppies.
There are indications that in many
elections the religious missions success-
fully swung support to their protegees,
but they also suffered setbacks. In re-
mote Manus, Mr Paliau Moloat, a
demagogic ex-policeman and Council
President who broke with the Mission
14 years ago and founded his own sect,
emerged a comfortable winner in a field
of six. Another surprise win was the
election to the Markham open seat of
Mr Gaudi Mirau, a Papuan clerk. To
achieve this, Mr Mirau, a Kerema man,
had to defeat two locally popular Aus-
tralians and three local tribal leaders.
To anyone familiar with the strength of
tribal parochialism, not to mention the
distrust with which most Papuans and
New Guineans still eye each other, Mr
Mirau’s victory was remarkable and
disconcerting to the Markham electors.
The most probable explanation for this
freak result lies in the voters’ imper-
fect understanding of the operation of
the preferential voting system.
A surprising failure was that of Yali
Singina, a cult leader (he once served
a stiff gaol sentence for sundry illegal
activities) who reputedly exerted a
strongly mystical influence over much
of Madang District. While many voters
in electorates where he was not a can-
didate insisted on writing in his name, in
his home area, the Rai Coast, he finish-
ed a bad third. The sophisticated Mo-
tuans of the Port Moresby area gloomily
face the prospect of being represented
by a Goilala storeman, Mr Eriko
Rarupu, and are already requesting a
revision of electoral boundaries.
Warriors and orators
IV/fosT of the 38 newly-elected indige-
nous members are not as yet known
outside their districts, and information
on their personal attributes is currently
scanty. They include seven interpreters
and three schoolteachers, but the major-
ity are classified as subsistence farmers.
It appears that not more than half a
dozen are fluent in English, although
several others probably have a working
knowledge of it. The most common lan-
guage to the Assembly will be Melane-
sion Pidgin.

Assistant with long experience of the

connections in the Trobriand Islands. A
slight, mild-mannered fellow, relatively
well-travelled and capable of expressing
himself in fluent English, he could be
an asset to the House. The member for
Wewak-Aitape, Mr Simogun Pita, is an
ex-police sergeant with a distinguished
war record who now grows cocoa at
Dagua —a name that will ring bells with
Sixth Division infanteers. An uninhibited
extrovert with earthy common sense and
a humorous turn of phrase, Simogun is
aggressively pro-Australian. He pre-
viously served a term in the Legislative
Council, and may be counted upon to
enliven Assembly proceedings and to
reduce the interpreters to despair with
his rapid-fire, Sepik-inflicted Pidgin. Mr
Handaba Tiaba, the member for Tari
(Southern Highlands), is reputed to be
a formidable warrior and orator, but is
not conversant with any language other
than his local dialect. To offset this
potential disability he can boast six
wives and 10 children.
There is little doubt that, at least in
the early sittings, the dominant native
figure in the House of Assembly will be
Mr John Guise, who combines political
and administrative experience with an
ability to express himself fluently in
English, Motu and Pidgin. Considered
by some Australian residents to be anti-
white, and by others to be a political
weathercock, Guise, a sturdy, balding
fiftyish East Papuan, reputedly with a
dash of French royal blood in his veins,
is shrewd and ambitious. He has yet to
demonstrate the broad vision and per-
suasive leadership needed to weld the
indigenous members into a parliamen-
tary bloc. Much will depend on how the
numerically dominant but uneducated
and inexperienced Highlands members
react to the competing pressures to which
they will almost certainly be subjected
by the Administration, by the elected
whites, and by their relatively sophisti-
cated coastal brothers.
The reserve powers
least in short-range terms, the odds
would seem in favor of the 16 non-
official whites. Apart from the fact that
their number includes seven ex-kiaps and
a veteran missionary, Percy Chatterton,
all these men are fluent in either Pidgin
or Motu, and are in much closer daily
contact with the indigenous population

Keith McCarthy, the Director of Native
Affairs, has ever tramped the bush. Not
one of his parliamentary colleagues
some of them relative newcomers —can
speak either Pidgin or Motu and few of
h e m are even at their ease conversing
Wl th an evolved indigene in English. This
is the team which, under the leadership
of Assistant Administrator John Gun-
ther, will have to try to persuade a
House numerically dominated by un-
sophisticated hillsmen to legislate in
accordance with Canberra edicts. It is
not improbable that the ambitious Mr
lan Downs (Bulletin, Jan. 11), who
polled 126,000 votes against his oppo-
nent’s 38,000 in the Highlands Special
Electorate contest, will command a
majority in the House. His leadership
may be challenged by Don Barrett, a
New Britain planter and former MLC
who narrowly won the West Gazelle
seat. The House seems likely to elect as
its Speaker old Horrie Niall, recently re-
tired District Commissioner of Morobe.
The usual administrative arrangements
and the constitutional powers of the
House of Assembly are set out in the
amending Commonwealth Papua and
New Guinea Act of 1963. Twenty-two
members of the House assembled will
constitute a quorum. The House may
draw up its own standing orders and is
required to keep minutes of its proceed-
ings (the implications of maintaining
Hansard as a verbatim trilingual record
are positively frightening). The Speaker
is to be elected by vote of the House,
and may similarly be removed from
office.
The Act generally empowers the
House to make Ordinances for the peace,
order and good government of the
Territory, but imposes some important
limitations on its authority. No “vote,
resolution or proposed law” for the
appropriation of revenue shall be passed
“unless the purpose of the appropriation
has in the same session been recommend-
ed by message of the Administrator to
the House”. Depending on their subject
matter, Ordinances passed require the
assent of either the Administrator or the
Governor-General: the legislation that
must be referred to Canberra embraces
a wide range of matters, including
divorce, the disposal of Crown or Ad-
ministration land, all military arrange-
ments, immigration and deportation,
employment, arms, liquor and opium,
and the Public Service.
The Administrator may assent, withhold
assent, return an Ordinance to the House
with recommended amendments, or re-
serve it for the Governor-General’s plea-
sure. The Governor-General, within six
months of the presentation of an Ordi-
nance to the Administrator, is required
by the Act to proceed similarly. His
assent to an Ordinance only becomes
operative upon notification in the
Government Gazette.
The powers of both the Adminis-
trator and the House of Assembly are
further circumscribed by Section 57 of
the Amending Act, which empowers the
Governor-General, within six months
after the Administrator’s assent to an
Ordinance, to disallow it in whole or in
part, or to recommend amendments for
consideration by the House of Assembly.
Publication of a notice of disallowance
in the Government Gazette has the same
effect as repeal of the Ordinance. Each
Ordinance assented to by the Adminis-
trator or Governor-General, or from
which assent has been withheld, must be
tabled by the Minister for Territories in
both Houses of Federal Parliament
—reasons must also be tabled.
Early constitutional crises?
Oection 6 of the Amending Act also
provides for an Administrator’s
Council comprising three official and
seven elected members of the House
of Assembly, who are to be appointed
by the Minister on the nomination of
the Administrator. It is logical to
assume that this body will function
as the executive committee of the
House a sort of embryonic Cabinet,
but no pronouncements have yet been
made. To date the Administration has
also maintained silence regarding the
15 Under-Secretaries (to be appointed by
the Administrator) provided for in a
separate Ordinance, although it is under-
stood that 10 members, presumably in-
digenous, will be attached to different
Administration departments. An Under-
secretary who is unable to read a file
may find such an assignment as tedious
as will the Departmental Head. For their
efforts these Ministers-in-training will
receive salaries of £l3OO per year
(Ordinary members get £950 plus five
guineas per day sitting fees, free fares
and telephone and postage allowances of
£25 per year.) It seems probable that the
potential Under-Secretary field will be ex-
amined closely when the elected members
assemble next month at Sogeri, in the
Owen Stanley foothills, for an orientation
course to be conducted under Adminis-
tration aegis by the School of Pacific
Studies of the Australian National Uni-
versity.
The methods by which the members
of the Administrator’s Council and the
Under-Secretaries are nominated, includ-
ing the conditions attached by the Ad-
ministration to their tenures of office,
may well exercise a determining influence
on future political developments. It
would be tactically wise for the Adminis-
trator’s nominations to be, in effect,
selections made by the House itself, but
no indication has yet been given that this
procedure will be used. If the Adminis-
tration entertains ambitions to muster a
near-majority of votes in the House by
attempting to bind hand-picked indige-
nous office-bearers tightly to its policy
wheels, it will run the risk of precipita-
ting some early constitutional crises.

OUT AND ABOUT
The Sound
of Mr
Huntley
That namby-pamby ABC?
By JAN SMITH
By the end of his final lecture series
in Australia, at Sydney’s Union
Theatre, British film man, John
Huntley was almost in a state of hubris.
“To think, a discussion lasting nearly
two and a half hours. I would never
have thought it possible.”
Mr Huntley, lecturer in film apprecia-
tion for the British Film Institute and
author of several books on film and film
music, had been lecturing around
Australia for several weeks before his
criticisms of Bob Sanders’ “People”
(Channel 2) broke in the Press. “Namby-
pamby and lily-livered,” said Mr Hunt-
ley, attacking the ABC’s long-standing
habit of catering for minority groups
(“Old Time Ballroom”, “Country Call”)
in peak hours, and for soft-pedalling on
current affairs.
Mr Huntley wasn’t gunning solely for
the ABC, but the fact that he made his
criticisms on the ABC’s own programme,
at a time when the vast majority of
viewers were glued to imported attrac-
tions on the commercial channels, cer-
tainly proved his point.
Cheerful and uninhibited, Mr Huntley
clearly enjoyed- making a fuss. “i n
Melbourne,” he confided happily, “there
was a complete ban on me in the Press
after some Senators in Perth had sent
out word I was a dangerous heretic.”
The ban had worked well, said Mr
Huntley, until someone had interviewed
his wife for the social pages and un-
covered the whole story. If indeed
Mr Huntley had been starved of a lay
audience in Melbourne, he made up for
that in Sydney. His lectures at the
Union Theatre, sponsored by the Com-
monwealth Office of Education, followed
on a UNESCO-sponsored seminar on
film music at the Adelaide Festival.
A feature film industry, said Mr
Huntley, was a mark of a nation’s intel-
lectual maturity, and since it was an
economic impossibility in a country
with a population under 80 million it
was clearly the Government’s duty to
subsidise one handsomely, as did
governments in places like Sweden,
Italy, Poland and France. If South and
North Vietnam could have a feature
film industry, why not Australia?
In Italy the Government socked the
money out of the tourists. In Sweden
the theatres were heavily subsidised to
permit filming in the slack summer
months. In Britain cinemas were taxed
“Strong political action,” said Mr Hunt-
ley. “It’s the only way.”
Mr Huntley hinted that the Conserva-
tive Government had done more toward
establishing a British film industry than
had the Labor Party, outwardly more
concerned with employment and cul-
tural matters.
Mr Huntley was the first to admit the
North Country vogue had reached
saturation point, but when one con-
sidered the years of stylised “nice
movies (many of them produced by his
old employers, the Rank Company),
where everyone below a certain social
level was portrayed as a kind of quaint,
cap-doffing sub-species of mankind, it
was no wonder that the North Country
audience, confronted with “Room at the
Top”, experienced a thrill of recogni-
tion that had lasted well up to the
present day.
Mr Huntley disposed smartly of some-
one who wondered if the working man
wouldn’t really prefer 90 minutes of
Park Lane escapism. People liked to
find themselves and their problems
treated realistically, sympathetically o n
without condescension.
But whatever its virtues, the industrial-
social protest film must always be seen
as a stage of development “like your
kangaroos and outback stories ’ —• tj lB
must eventually give way to something
else. Films like “Tom Jones”, arriving
here any day, and “Doctor Strangelove,
scheduled for the Sydney Film Festival
were indications of a new direction, o
at least a new setting and approach

the same problems. “Tom Jones”, he
thought, explored the same questions of
social change and injustice as did the
bed-sitter films, only transposed to the
eighteenth century.
In “Doctor Strangelove”, it was a
matter of a new approach, showing how
farce could be even more confronting
than realism. “The part where the
world is destroyed is really hilarious,”
Mr Huntley promised. Vera Lynn, he
revealed, sang a saccharine song against
scenes of unparalleled chaos, reminiscent
of a Milligan film some years back
where the same sort of thing Nazis
bludgeoning Jews and bombing cities —•
went on while Milligan sang “It’s a
Great Big Wonderful World We Live
In”. This treatment, says Huntley, will
put a bite into a realistic mode already
becoming stereotyped.
Would Britain's directors go the way
of Bergman, Resnais and Antonioni?
Unlikely, said Mr Huntley, since the
British were not temperamentally in-
clined to experiment. Personally, he
liked the European approach, although
“Last Year at Marienbad” had baffled
him as much as anyone, and the theory
that it had actually represented a giant
mental asylum had its points.
In Britain, despite its enlightened
Government approach to finance, there
was no formal school for cinematogra-
phers. “Film-makers have to bash their
way through by fair means or foul,”
said Mr Huntley. Lindsay Anderson
came up through the Royal Court Thea-
tre, and most of the other new film
directors emerged from the stage, with
the result that the' transition to the film
medium meant glaring errors in tech-
nique.
The big problem, encountered in
“Room at the Top”, was to find an
actress capable of portraying an ordi-
nary middle-class woman.
“There simply wasn’t an actress in
Britain who didn't have a plum per-
manently stuck in her mouth from years
of theatre and drama school. We had
to rewrite the role for a Frenchwoman
and ask Simone Signoret.”
"Dussia and Poland, on the other hand,
* had special schools for film-makers.
“It's always difficult to convince creative
people that training is necessary,” Hunt-
ley said. “On one hand you have
people who say the best way to learn
film-making is to make films, and then
there's other people who advocate for-
mal training.”
Opponents of formal teaching pointed
to Russia as a grim example. “They
turn out horrible masses of stodge, but
the direction and technique are wonder-
ful,” Mr Huntley said. “They’re very
good on anything formal and spectacu-
lar, especially if it's more than 10Q years
old. They love Chekhov and Pushkin
and make hundreds of ‘Ladies with
Little Dogs’ each year’.”
Mr Huntley liked most of our current
affairs and news documentaries on tele-
vision, and was very happy with TCN's
“The Glittering Mile”, a recent feature
on Kings Cross.
Mr Huntley did like some local shows
(“Sound of Music” was one). His great-
est wrath was directed at the poorly-
made imitation of an overseas success.
“Barley Charlie”, a comedy series pro-
duced after three years’ gestation by the
“Rag Trade’s” Chesney and Wolfe, was
a classic example of what happened
when one attempted to mix two cultures.
“It is quite impossible,” said Mr
Huntley, “to expect a good local film
to be done by British writers and direc-
tors. The two countries are entirely
dissimilar in their social and economic
tempo. Britain, though it grieves me
to say it, is running down. Australia is
undoubtedly running up.”


The Nature of Love
A SHORT STORY
BY JUDITH WRIGHT
Yillers-Bret (call it that) was a decayed soldier-settlement from the First World
War; by 1938 few of the farms still existed. Some had been taken up into
others more prosperous, some had gone back to bush, their tottering gates
propped back, seedling eucalypts growing over their entrances.
On one of the last remaining apple-
orchards, tucked away under the shadow
of Mount Jameson, I had discovered the
Schwarzkopfs.
They had not been there long; per-
haps six months. We seldom went out
towards Mt Jameson; it was at the back
of our place, and Villers-Bret was at the
end of a dying road. But one hot day in
November, someone had dropped a
match on the other side of the mountain
(“those careless idiots over on Spencer’s
Creek”). It was dry and windy from
the north-west, and the grass and low
scrub on the flanks of the mountain
were sapless as kindling. When the fire
appeared over the spur, the wind was
already blowing blackened leaves and
ash in our direction.
The fact that the Schwarzkopfs’ farm
also lay in its path was, for us, inciden-
tal. Their cleared flats were the best
place to fight it, since the creek was ac-
cessible and a break could be burned
back there, in the windless shelter of
the mountain. My father, my sister
Helen, and I galloped there over the
short-cut through our back paddocks
that had once led to Villers-Bret’s store,
when that was still in existence.
When we reached the farm, a man
was standing on the verandah of the
four-roomed house, coughing and grip-
ping the rail with one hand, a hand with
what seemed, for a farmer, curiously
long white fingers. My father shouted
at him, gave him one glance as he
replied, and went on along the creek.
"New here”, he explained to us toler-
antly; “these blasted migrants don’t
know enough to keep themselves alive.”
At the fence, however, we found Lisa.
She was standing beside three old kero-
sene-tins of water that she had carried
from the creek and a pile of wet bags,
and she was waiting for the fire to
reach her. It was perhaps a quarter
of a mile off and burning well and she
would not have had a chance against
it. At first she refused to let my father
light the grass to burn a break, thinking
that he was merely abetting the inten-
tions of the fire. I had to explain things
to her, while Helen and my father did
the work.
She listened carefully and nodded.
“I see now. It is very good of you
to come to save us.” As I knew that
our corn-cultivation two miles down
the creek was in fact our first considera-
tion, and the house and fences the
second, I was then ashamed. She set
to work and helped with the break, and
by the end of the afternoon we had
turned the fire into the swamp country
where it could burn itself out without
doing more damage.
ITowever, incidentally to saving our
corn and fences, we had saved the
hundred old apple-trees on the Schwarz-
kopfs’ farm, the six cows that Lisa
milked, the old horse that she guided
in front of the single-furrow plough,
and the little cultivation where she
grew potatoes and pumpkins. These
things had for a year kept the Schwarz-
kopfs in food and supplied mending-
cotton and skeins of wool, with which
Lisa criss-crossed their clothes until they
had become little more than web-work
of the neatest convent darning.
Accordingly she took us back to the
house and fed us with apple-strudel
from the earliest windfalls, chokingly
sour, and thick cream and coffee, while
Eric talked to my father and played
host. I saw her large eyes shadowed
by her cheekbones as she moved about
above the kerosene-lamp on the table,
and her capable hands from which she
had scrubbed the charcoal with a worn
old floor-scrubbing brush on the tank-
stand outside, and fell in love on the
spot.
Not with Eric, though he was the
beauty of the pair; but with Lisa. It
is necessary, at seventeen, to be in love;
but there was no-one my own age to
be in love with. I was filling in time
at home, waiting to be allowed to take
a job somewhere in the city (seventeen
was considered too young for a girl to
leave home), and meanwhile teaching
my young sister while the boys were
away at boarding-school. Helen, of
course, fell in love with Eric; I could
see her across the table, watching his
pale, wax-clear profile presented with a
slight upward tilt of the jawbone and
sidelong glance. He had a tumble of
hair and moustache as glossy as a
horse-chestnut, and a way of playing a
few bars of something on the old
propped-up piano they had brought
with them (a scrap of Traumerei, a
snatch of Wagner) that was obviously
meant to ensnare.
My instinct, however, I see as I look
back, was right. There was no profit
in Eric; but to love Lisa was to receive.
And I was hungry; at seventeen one is
always hungry; to be taught, to be
admired, to be loved.
Lisa’s broad cheeks, her tilted,
anxiously-smiling eyes, her wide hard
hands and the dragged-back hair in a
madonna-bun on her nape, all pro-
claimed that she had no time to waste
on herself. Unlike Eric, all she did
was thorough and complete; she left
no corners unswept, her cows were
thoroughly stripped, her cowshed clean-
ed, her pumpkins and potatoes weeded.
And when, on my Sunday-afternoon
visits, after the dishes had been washed
and put away and the coffee drunk, she
finally sat down to her piano, she would
square her elbows, draw a breath and

without pausing or looking up would
plunge into, through, right to the end
of a Bach fugue, a Franck prelude;
something, anything, earnest, methodi-
cal and somehow noble. If that had
been all, perhaps I would not have sat
so long to listen; but Lisa always had
something more than one expected of
her, still to be given; and before long
the piano would change its song and
the lightest and most delicate notes
tvould come pouring from it as smooth-
ly as though Mozart himself had been
P a^in ®’
Eric, who never finished anything,
W'ould lie round for a while listening,
ordering Play the E Minor Rondo,
Lisa, but would get up after a while
and stroll off somewhere, to eat apples
or whittle wood. As for me, I had
not enough of Lisa to waste it, and
would sit on the cane chair that had
lost all but two canes in the back, and
watch her and her hands. Those hands
could do anything; milk a cow, scrub
a room, sew that exquisite convent-
sewing (she had darned my shirt so
that my mother exclaimed at it), pour
out Mozart or cut noodles with perfect
accuracy from the big sheet of paste
they had just rolled into mathematical
evenness. I received so much at those
hands, during the year I knew them, that
it was no wonder I poured my unspeak-
jng love towards them whenever I
watched.
-Well. Alice,” Eric would say wick-
edlyi tossing his shimmering hair, “I
hope well see you next Sunday . Poor
Lisa, she never sees anyone, you know,
except you I don’t mean to say that
y OU are n’t anyone and of course
me. But j don't count. Do I, Lisa?”
And without looking at her (they
seldom seemed to look at each other)
he wou ]d pick up her hand and kiss it,
lingeringly, directing the gesture at my
jealousy, not at Lisa's smile. Eric was
well aware of me, and naturally did
not like my imperviousness to his
beauty. Every foolishness I let slip
was picked up, whittled to sharpness
and at last, perhaps weeks later, lodged
exactly in some sensitive part. Un-
practised in the rivalry of love, I could
not return these pricks, and looking
back I think it served me right.
As to how the Schwarzkopfs had
come to Villers-Bret, why they had
bought the little dying farm from old
John Perkins (who always referred to
them as “the Huns”, having been one
of the original soldier-settlers there), I
never asked. Simply, they were there,
and in being there served the purpose
of my seventeen-year-old heart, which
in its pursuit of experience and relation-
ship was in reality as cold as a frog’s,
though I did not know it. I watched
Lisa with the devotion of a dog watch-
ing a bone, and listened to her playing,
and saw and heard nothing at all.
11/fY mother and father, however, were
much more interested in these ques-
tions than they were in Eric and Lisa
themselves. It was said the Schwarzkopfs
had come from South Australia lots
of Germans down there and had
brought with them enough money to
buy the farm, tied in a spotted hand-
kerchief in the bottom of a suitcase.
This was so scandalous that my mother
refused to believe it. Money belonged
in banks or in cheques, and to carry
it around naked, as it were, w 7 as like
parading the street in one's underwear.
“Some people will say anything. It's
just because they look a bit out of the
common. But it's certainly a queer
place to come to; those Continentals
generally stick together. Don’t they
ever tell you anything, Alice? Goodness
knows you've been over there enough
lately to have their whole life-histories.”
“I don't ask,” I said, immediately
making a virtue of this. “I don't ask
because it's their business. I hate all
this country-town inquisitiveness.”
“Hm, more likely you never thought
of it for yourself. Well, they can't
have been here long, good as their
English is. I notice it’s her job to do
the work outside, ploughing and milk-
ing and all, and that's regular peasant-
style German for you.”
“She only does it because she's
stronger than Eric. He’s been ill.”
Secretly I criticised her for doing so
much for Eric, and putting up with his
shiftiness over work; but I did not want
anyone else intruding into that secret
world which contained Lisa, and thus
worked by its own laws. In fact, I
wanted Lisa to myself.
By this time, Lisa was teaching me
music, as well as giving me her friend-
ship and kindness, and her Sundays
the only day, I now believe, she had
for anything except hard work. When
I reached the farmhouse it was always
clean, the dinner cooked and ready,
even if it was only potato-cakes and

cheese and noodles. Eric would 101 l
at the table, eat half-complainingly,
sneer sweetly at the presents I had
brought for Lisa. Certainly they must
have seemed to him, and perhaps to her,
almost mockingly useless a home-
made lavender bag, a hand-embroidered
handkerchief, a pot of jam and the
Schwarzkopfs were not getting richer.
Winter set in hard and cold, and the.
westerlies began early. Dry cold air
poured over the landscape and searched
through the thickest clothes like snow-
water; the cows cropping dry scraps of
grass grew as bony as clothes-racks
under their staring coats. My mother
began to worry about the Schwarzkopfs,
and sent joints of meat from the Friday
killing over with me most Sundays. I
think it was all the meat they ever ate.
Once, Lisa was out when I came;
she had gone far up the mountainside,
and came home staggering under a sheaf
of grass she had cut herself with an
old scythe. It was mostly blady-grass,
and very dry, and when she put it in
front of her favorite cow Gretel, Gretel
took no notice. She was lying near
the bail, not far from her calving, and
very weak.
“She will not eat,” Lisa said. She
bent over the cow for a moment, then
stood up and folded her arms. “Eric
wants to kill her, for meat.”
“I’ve brought you over some mutton,”
I said; “that’ll be better than killing poor
old Gretel. You may be able to save
the calf.”
“There is no milk. The other cows
are almost dry. It is better for the
calf not to live at all I suppose.”
“But you can’t kill a cow near cal-
ving,” I said. “She may have a heifer
—and then if the weather changed, and
it rained, you might keep them both.”
“The weather will not change,” Lisa
said. “I feel there is much worse to
come. But no, I am not dreaming of
letting Eric kill her. If she dies, she
must die in her own way, not in his.
I will not have her killed.”
It was not the first time I had sus-
pected a note of hostility, almost of
spitefulness, in her tone when she spoke
of Eric; but this time it was unmistak-
able. There was also another note, of
woe almost, that must have slipped in
unawares because of her physical
tiredness; she might perhaps have been
asking for an ear into which to tell a
story, appealing for a friend. I am
ashamed to remember how quickly I
withdrew. Behind the high-cheekboned
Madonna into whom I had turned her,
a real Lisa suddenly looked out, a face
grimacing in pain, a wry mouth that
might suddenly call for help, or demand
some acknowledgment in me of a
common humanity. I had nothing to
give such a woman, though from her
hands I had taken a great deal. Instead,
I pulled from my saddle-bag the parcel
of meat my mother had sent over, and
gave it to her with a few light self-
protective phrases. Lisa looked at it for
a moment in silence before she thanked
me.
Tnside the house Eric had lit a big
fire; the stove was hot and the kettle
singing. We had mutton chops and
baked pumpkin and coffee. Eric was
very gay, flushed with the heat of the
fire, and the dry air, his eyes sparkling.
The warmth melted me towards both
of them; we seemed to sit in fellowship,
heightened by the angry sound of the
wind outside.
“Just for once, Lisa,” Eric said sud-
denly, “a bottle of the white wine, do
you think? This is good food, and good
meat requires wine. We have been cold
all day, and now we are nearly warm
again; let us celebrate Alice's kind pre-
sent and our good fortune.”
Lisa nodded and opened the cup-
board. I could not help noticing how
little was in it the other half of the
pumpkin, a few potatoes, a pound or
two of flour, a tin of treacle. There
were two bottles lying on their sides
on the bottom shelf, and she brought
out one and opened it.
Though I was seventeen, I had never
tasted wine, which my mother regarded
as faintly sinful, my father, probably,
as cissy, since he came from Scotland
and drank whisky when he drank at
all. I thought of refusing, but in the
end took the thick glass that Eric
filled for me.
“This is the first meat we have had
for days,” said Lisa cheerfully, con-

firming what I had suspected. “It is a
pity Eric is such a bad shot. He missed
a rabbit on Wednesday and we were
very anxious for that rabbit.”
Eric threw another big log on the
fire. “Lisa is only rude, she cannot
shoot at all. And my hands were
frozen to the rifle. I thought Australia
was always warm and sunny, Alice; the
world is always destroying my illu-
sions.”
He laughed and talked, Lisa answered
more cheerfully than usual and I took
sip after sip of wine and felt the heat
of the fire making my face burn and
my eyes sting. I began to feel myself
truly out in the world at last, in Eric’s
sophisticated company, for he was talk-
ing of things I had no more than heard
of; of the ski-runs of Tirol, of the
Rhine running under ice, of vineyards
and vintages, of the famous wine-
makers of the hills near Bonn, of
castles and islands. Leaning intimately
on the table, we began to sing, first in
English; then Lisa began a German
song and went to the piano, and Eric
joined in. The bottle was empty, and I
was half-asleep, I put my head on my
arms and listened to their voices which
mingled lightly and sweetly, and tears
came into my eyes at the beauty and
worth of life and Lisa, and the beauty
and worthlessness of Eric. I fell asleep,
warm and melancholy, to the sound of
their singing.
When I woke, however, I felt I had
” been awakened by something unpleas-
ant, though I did not know what. They
had stopped singing. Eric stood at the
window, hands in his pockets, staring out
at the bare flats and the trees struggling
with the wind. Lisa was playing,
stubbornly and rather heavily, a Bach
fugue.
“I must go,” I said, “the pony will
be getting cold and it’s dark so early
now. I'm sorry I went to sleep and
missed the singing.”
Lisa closed the piano and got up.
“Please thank your mother for us, Alice,
for the good meat.”
“Yes,” Eric said, “please thank your
father, too. It is lucky for us we have
such kind, rich neighbors.”
“We’re not rich,” I began, but think-
ing of how much less rich the Schwarz-
kopfs were, I was silent. I determined
to come over as soon as I could and
bring them something more a cake,
some preserves, whatever I could beg
from mother.
Lisa looked at Eric with her head
bent forward dangerously, but said
nothing. She came with me to the yard,
where the pony was tied, and together
we examined Gretel the cow. She lay
there as before. I knew that a really
weak cow will lie sometimes for days,
unable to give birth, but I did not say

so. I helped Lisa to tie an old rug
made of sacks around her as well as
we could, and rode home in the half-
dark.
Next day, Helen had a bad cold, and
was made to stay in bed and miss her
lessons. I was free, and went with my
father riding round the paddocks, look-
ing for weak cattle to be moved into
the nearer paddocks, where they could
be given a little extra hay.
After two days, Helen's cold was no
better, and we had still one paddock to
look through. It was the far paddock,
bordering the short-cut to Villers-Bret.
“I'll look through them tomorrow,”
I told my father, “it won't take long.”
I would go to the Schwarzkopfs after-
wards, and take Lisa a plum-cake. I
had asked my mother about this, and
she had promised it rather reluctantly.
“You're getting too involved with those
people, Alice.”
“Pooh,” I said, “involved! It’s just
that they're having a hard time of it.
I can’t take music-lessons without pay-
ing something for it.”
There was a gate from the paddock
on to the old road, so I packed the
cake in a sugar-bag on the saddle, and
rode straight out there in the morning.
There was a lot of timber left in the
paddock, which made it hard to muster,
but left the cattle plenty of shelter from
the wind. I quartered it systematically,
but found few cattle; evidently they
w r ere huddled in the little hollow near
the road gate, above which a curving
ridge ran, hiding the valley except from
its crest. When I reached the top of
this ridge, I could see into the hollow
as if it were an amphitheatre. In this
amphitheatre a very strange scene was
taking place.
The cattle I was looking for were
there all right, and a small mob of
sheep as well my father’s best wean-
ers. The cattle were staring, heads all
one way, as cattle will at anyone un-
expected. The direction of their gaze
led me to the unlikely figure of Eric,
dressed in a tweed knickerbocker shoot-
ing outfit, and hidden from the direction
of the road by a clump of trees. He
had dropped to one knee, and was just
steadying his gun on his mark, which
was one of our fattest weathers, feeding
a little way from the mob.
It was like a sudden gush of cold
water, making me gasp, yet react very
fast. I could not possibly let him shoot;
nor could I withdraw, for in a moment
or two he could look up and see me
clearly on the ridgetop, not a hundred
yards from him. In any case, I was
righteously enraged, remembering the
cake in the sugar-bag balanced on the
pommel of my saddle; and I felt a
strong sense of property in those
wethers, which I had known since they
were lambs.
I tried to shout something, choked,
and cleared my throat. However, Eric
heard me, and with a violent start
looked up. I had no way out but to
ride over.
“Out shooting?” I decided to say
carelessly. But the words refused to
come. Eric must have known from
mv expression that I had clearly under-
stood the scene. To my complete
stupefaction he now raised the rifle
again, but this time pointed it at me.
This was absurd. It was reasonable
enough for people to steal a sheep
occasionally; I had never found anyone
doing it before, but I knew it often
happened. But nobody threatened
other people with rifles that was be-
havior quite outside reality. I had
been strictly brought up, and I knew
that you did not allow the business end
of your gun to point at anyone, even
if you knew perfectly well it wasn’t
loaded. Accordingly, I did not believe
it was happening, which must have
made me appear brave and in charge


of myself, when in fact I was not so
at all. “Put that thing down, Eric,” I
shouted; “you’ll get into trouble hand-
ling a gun in that silly way.”
Eric, however, had clearly lost his
head. Pale and sweating, he in turn
shouted at me. “You will tell no-one
of this, Alice. Nobody at all. Pro-
mise, or I will shoot. Swear you will
tell nobody.”
I saw with purely practical alarm
that his hands were shaking violently.
“You point that thing at the ground,”
I ordered.
Slowly Eric lowered the gun. “I
know you will be sensible, Alice. I
was going to shoot a sheep I admit
it. It was for Lisa. She is hungry and
she needs good food. We have no
money, and Lisa is going to have a
baby. You understand?”
“A baby Lisa?” I quite forgot
about the gun.
“You understand? A man must kill
for his wife and child.” Eric sounded
so pompous that I began to laugh. He
looked at me wdth real dislike.
I found all sorts of considerations
balancing themselves in my mind. “All
right,” I said at last, “I won't say any-
thing that is, if you leave our sheep
alone. And other people’s too,” I
added, thinking of the Simmondses
nearby, and their ewes in lamb. “I'll
bring Lisa what I can, and you can
practise shooting rabbits there are
more than enough of those to keep you
going. As a matter of fact, there’s a
cake in this bag for her now. You can
take it home w'ith you. I won’t say
anything.”
“Particularly not to Lisa? She wished
nobody to know . . .”
I was wondering if Lisa had any idea
W'here Eric w'as. It w 7 as the first
treacherous thought I had had about
her, and before I could stop it another
came, w'hich was that we had not
counted those sheep for some time. “I’m
mustering these sheep,” I said falsely,
“and my father will be wondering where
they are if I don't hurry. You’d better
get on home.”
T went round the sheep and took them
A up the ridge, while Eric walked back,
dragging the gun and holding the cake-
tin, and looking, in his knickerbockers,
extremely foolish and out of place. This
pleased me. However, when I had
counted the sheep and found that none
were missing, I began to remember the
round black hole in the rifle-barrel, and
how decidedly it had been directed at
me. I thought my mother had been
right in saying that I was becoming too
involved with “those people”.
So on Sunday, instead of going over
for my music-lesson, I cut out a dress,
and pretended I was too interested in
getting it tacked and fitted, to want to
go out anywhere. That would have
lasted all the afternoon, except that by
three o'clock I heard voices in the
garden, and looking out saw Lisa talk-
ing to my mother. When I went out,
rather reluctantly, I thought she seemed
shy with me. No, she would not stay
for a cup of tea; she was late in getting
home and the cows must be milked;
she had only come out for a walk and
to thank us for the cake; Eric would
come home and wonder where she had
gone. I had never heard her talk like
this, with a shrill edge and uneasily, and
my mother too looked at her thought-
fully.
“Did you really walk all the way?”
I said. It was a good six miles across
country.
“I had a lift, with Mrs Carter; she
was to town going. But I wanted to
walk, it is good exercise.” It was not
like Lisa to invert her sentences, either;
and I thought this was no time for her
to need more exercise, when she worked
all day in any case.
“Of course you mustn’t walk home,”
my mother said. My father had taken
the old utility truck, our only vehicle,
over to the bottom paddock dam,
where the cattle were beginning to bog
as they came in to drink, and corduroy
had to be laid. It would be a long
dirty job and he would not be back
before dark.
“I'll catch Helen’s pony and my own,”
I said, “and we’ll ride home, and I'll
lead the pony back.” She protested
earnestly, but I was already on my way
to the horse-paddock. Besides, I was
curious to know why she had come.
She was not at all a good rider, but
once in the saddle stayed there like a
sack of flour.
“But you should not have done it.
I would have enjoyed the walk, and
the cows have so little milk now that
the milking is soon over.”
“What happened to Gretel?” I said.
“She died a few days ago. The calf
was born dead, too.” Lisa looked at me
sideways. “Eric was angry. He said
I should not have kept him from killing
her; she would have made good meat,
but it was spoiled.”
“Oh,” I said, but the subject seemed
rather dangerous. I changed it. “I
hope the cake arrived safely?”
“It was for that I came to thank your
mother and for all the other things
of course. I did not expect to see you.”
“Why not? I was coming over today,
but I had a dress to make . . .”
“We cannot expect you to come every
week. Eric was luckier, meeting you
on the road that day. He tells me it was
quite an accident.”
“Well, yes.” I felt my face going hot
and a giggle coming, at the word, but
I choked it down into a cough. “I
thought he had better take the cake. I
was out mustering the sheep.”
Lisa had turned half round and was
watching me, and her face too was
burning. “And did you have much
to say to each other?”
I examined this for a moment, since
the way it was spoken seemed to hint
a trap. How much did she know? “No,
we just said hello. He was out shoot-
ing, but he hadn't shot anything
when I saw him.”
“You are sure you did not intend to
meet him?” She was jerking nervously
at the pony’s mouth and he began to
prop and sweat.
“Don't do that, .Lisa, it’s bad for his
mouth.” This was awful. I was now
certain that she knew or guessed what
he had been doing. “No, indeed, I
didn't know he was there. If I had, I
mightn’t have well, you know I never
can find much to say to Eric.”
“Oh, no, you never say much. But
you look at him. I have seen you.”
T was struck as if by lightning; turning
round to look at her I found myself
breathing through a wide-open mouth.
My image of Lisa and of the world
cracked across and rearranged itself
drastically. Was that why she had
come over this afternoon? Had she
wanted to see if I was out with Eric?
“Lisa,” I cried, “you're completely
wrong. If I’ve come to see you it’s
only been for for you.” She laughed
sharply. I began again. “Look, Eric
did tell me one thing, and it pleased
me a lot. About about the child.”
She let out a small cry; her eyes
turned black and her face white. I had
evidently not helped the situation.
“I’m sorry, I forgot he told me not
to tell you I knew.” I stammered on,
for she was crying now, large incredu-
lous tears. “But why don't you want
people to know? I think it’s lovely
I’m so glad you’re having a baby.”
Lisa dropped her head and began to
plait her fingers in Robin’s mane, but
she had stopped crying, with a gasp.
She rode on in silence. “He told you
I was to have a baby,” she said at last.
“You are sure of that, too?” I nodded,
deep in distress.
“It was a lie. Now you must tell
me. He would not have told you a
lie unless he had some purpose. What
had you what had he done?”
My throat swelled with panic and I
said nothing. She pulled up her pony
and dropped the reins altogether, cry-
ing out, “Alice! What had he done?”
I could see no way out, and I got off
my pony. While we sat together on
a log, and the ponies cropped dry grass
in the cold wind, I told her how we had
met.
She thought it over for a while, then
she began to laugh. I laughed, too, since
there wasn’t anything else to do.
“You have told me,” she said at last,


Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
■— the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder—so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.

it in the ‘too hard’ basket, please.

when she had stopped laughing and so
had I. “Now I can tell you. I owe
you that, because all the while I had
suspected you and you were only being
kind.”
“I wasn't!” I exclaimed. “I came
I come because I want to. I come for
you because you’re so good to me.”
“Now you are being kind again. You
won’t have to bother any more, because
we’re going away.”
Wind stung in my eyes and my lips
were cold.
“Where to? It will take a long time
to sell that farm.”
“We won't trouble. We can borrow
enough money to go back where we
came, and there’s the piano. But first
I must tell you.” She took a long lock
of her hair, that had come out of her
bun, in both hands, and quite calmly
began to pull it. Some of it came out.
I watched in horror.
“Eric is German; I am Swiss. Eric
is married, but not to me I think not
to me. No, wait. He married his
cousin, a Jewess. He too is Jewish,
partly Jewish.” She pronounced it
Yewish, so that for a moment I did not
understand what she was saying. “They
had a baby.”
I winced at this.
“We had known Eric for years, for
my father keeps a hotel in Geneva and
Eric was a traveller, you know, a com-
mercial traveller, in German wines.
One day he knocked at the door; he
asked could he stay for a little, there
was trouble. We knew what it must
be.”
“Hitler,” I mumbled.
“He stayed a while; then we told him,
if he could get his wife and the baby out,
we would take care of them, because
the news from Germany was bad. He
went. When he came back he was
crying and weeping; we could get no-
thing from him. I was sorry for him.
Eric is good at crying.”
“But surely . . .”
“No, wait. Then he told me his wife
was dead, the baby dead. He was afraid
for himself. Would I marry him and
we would go away together? I was very
sorry for him; I married him in Geneva.
My father had cousins out here; he gave
us a little money and we came out to
Australia. We got work in the vine-
yards, with my people.” She paused
for a while.
“Then came out another man, a man
who knew Eric. When he saw Eric in
the vineyard, he said to my people,
what are you doing with this man? He
has betrayed his wife into a concentra-
tion camp, and his own child, and to
save his own life, and he ran away and
left them.”
My breath stopped as at the climax
of a horror-picture.
“We went away from there next day,
with our money, and found this farm
because it was cheap. Eric says none
of that is true, all is lies. But Eric too
tells lies. Who am I to believe? Eric
is a coward, I have found that out, too.
Perhaps he would even have killed you
- I don’t know. But the child? No,
no!” she exclaimed, forgetting me alto-
gether and twisting her hand in her
hair with an extraordinary gesture. “He
could never have done that to the
child!”
XW E sat there for a long time, not
moving.
“Now we are going back,” she said.
“I have known for a long time that we
must go back. We will try to find them.
Perhaps they are not dead.” She untied
Robin’s reins from the fence and gave
them to me. “I can accept no more
of anybody’s kindness. I shall walk
home and tell Eric we are going. You
must take the horses back; look, almost
is the sunset.”
“Please ride him the rest of the way,
Lisa,” I begged, “it’s another three miles
and it’s so cold. I should never have
told you. I can’t forgive myself.”
“Goodbye, Alice. I am sorry I did
not trust your kindness, and I have told
you such things. You must forget
them.” She slipped under the fence to
take the short way home. I followed
her beseechingly, stammering about the
pony. The tears on my cheeks were
cold as snails.
She took my hand through the barbed
wire, and turned away. I watched her
set off, then turn back again.
“Do you know what is the worst of
all, Alice? It is my wickedness. I hope
they are dead both dead.”
She walked away through the thin
trees, the tress of hair blowing and her
hair coming out of its pins.
After a while I rode home again. I
felt as though I had climbed some very
steep cliff, following painfully after Lisa,
but from the top I could now perceive
something of the nature of love. It was
the last thing she gave me, and I did not
see her again. That was in July, 1939.

The Dura Mach 10 introduces a new
era of speed and sophistication in office
mechanization.
175 words a minute is by way of
saying that the new Dura Mach 10 is
the fastest automatic writing machine
in the world. The spherical typing head
makes this possible takes care of
swift language changes, too. English to
German, for instance, in 10 seconds!
Built into the unit as an integral part
is a high-speed punch and reader.
Punched paper tape or edge punched
cards, read by the machine, control the
various functions. Tabulation, carriage
return, paper feeding are completely
automatic.
The selection and capture of informa-
tion for subsequent processing is also
automatic, and completely free of all
operator decision.
Predetermined information is written
by the machine .automatically at a
speed of 175 words per minute. Where
variable data is to be written the
machine stops (again automatically)
and allows the operator to manually
enter this information.
Inbuilt safeguards constantly check
the manner in which the machine is
operated, thereby ensuring the validity
of data being stored for subsequent
processing.
The Dura Mach 10 is backed by Aus-
tralia-wide systcms-analysis, programm-
ing, and technical service facility.

*The first of two articles on President
Macapagal appeared last week.
OVERSEAS
A War against Graft
and Corruption
Concluding Macapagal of the Philippines
From ALEX JOSEY in Singapore
Some writers have suggested that
Macapagal continues to press his
Sabah claim partly because he
is frustrated by internal affairs. They
do not entirely dismiss Macapagal’s fear
of the Chinese in Malaysia, but they
say that internally he suffered disap-
pointments and, in consequence, turned
to an external diversion. This seems
difficult to understand, if true. When
Macapagal took office in November,
1961, one-fifth of the nation’s workers
were unemployed. He promised them a
New Era. He told the people: “I come
from the poor. Let me reap for you
the harvest of the poor. Let us break
the chains of poverty. Let me lead you
to prosperity.”
Staunchly believing in private enter-
prise, Macapagal stabilised the tottering
peso with huge loans from the United
States. He promised to make workers
capitalists. He set up a Development
Corporation to encourage, with long-
term loans, Fiiipino businessmen to set
up industries. He produced a 100 mil-
lion peso Emergency Employment Ad-
ministration to give three ‘months’ work
to 250,000 unemployed, paying them 4
pesos a day. Average wage in the Philip-
pines is about 2.50 pesos a day. Ten
pesos are worth an English pound.
In his State of the Nation Address to
Congress on January 27, 1964, Maca-
pagal pointed to an advance “in nearly
all fields”. He said that corruption
among Government officials “has, to a
marked degree”, diminished. A decon-
trolled economy with a stable exchange
rate had been achieved. International
reserves had improved. There was a
favorable balance of trade and favor-
able balances of payments. Per capita
income “is on the rise”. Industrial pro-
duction continued to increase, agricul-
tural output was' up. A nation-wide
housing programme for lower-income
groups had been launched. Free enter-
prise prospered. “Prospects” of cmploy-
ment improved in spite of “population
explosion”. The agricultural land re-
form, “though difficult to enforce effec-
tively”, was impressive and “an endur-
ing monument to the farsightedness of
our lawmakers”. To an ardent reformer
like Macapagal, this account of his
stewardship may have contained bitter
seeds of disappointment, but they seem
hardly sufficient, surely, to cause him
to turn aside to a hazardous foreign ad-
venture for distraction.
Macapagal was forced to admit that
prices had soared and that rice was in
short supply. He blamed a world short-
age of rice, an excuse which was hardly
valid or even accurate. Thousands were
still out of work, minimum wages were
too low, smuggling was serious and
“must be destroyed”, he said. In his list
of problems which he said must be solv-
ed if the Philippines was to progress,
Macapagal gave the eradication of graft
top priority.
To Macapagal’s credit he has always
waged a relentless war against graft and
corruption. In 1957, after 8 years in
Congress, a Filipino journalist described
him as “one of the few ruthlessly honest
elective officials that we have today”.
That year, Macapagal was elected Vice-
President. He received nearly 120,000
more votes than the total with which
Carlos P. Garcia won the Presidency.
When Macapagal became President in
1961 he opened the Presidential palace
to all Filipinos. He cancelled the tradi-
tional ball and held an open-air dance
instead to which everybody was invited.
He made an order forbidding members
of his family, or his wife’s family, from
taking any part in business deals with
the Government. He dismissed 100
corrupt officials, invited resignations
from many more. Within three months
he ended the notorious Stonehill affair
by sending this American merchant mil-
lionaire out of the country.
Harry Stonehill, formerly Steinberg of
Chicago, was a United States Army
officer who stayed on. In ten years,
Stonehill became a multi-millionaire. He
owned corporations, cigarette factories,
glass factories, many businesses. He
bribed high Government officials, vio-
lated revenue, customs, and banking regu-
lations. Members of Congress and the
Cabinet were on his payroll. Rumor
said he contributed heavily to Maca-
pagal’s Liberal Party. Stonehill was
arrested when he tried to strangle a
news-photographer. He was supposed
to be involved in a murder case.
When Macapagal took office, his
Secretary of Justice promised to expose
all on Stonehill’s payroll. But 16 pages
of his report were later found to be
missing, and the names of only 15 bribed
officials were eventually revealed. Stone-

hiil agreed to leave the Philippines
voluntarily. Charges against him were
dropped. Obviously, the Government
and he had come to terms. Stonehill
went to Australia. Later he moved to
Switzerland. Macapagal had smashed
the Stonehill racket, which had dug deep
into the Administration, but the climax
created dissatisfaction in certain quarters
and Macapagal was subjected to severe
criticism.
Since then, his enemies have made
many accusations against his integrity.
Politics in the Philippines can be passion-
ate and virulent, and the Philippines
Press, unfortunately influenced by the
worst type of American newspapers, is
a literature of snarling, sensation, and
protest. There are six English langu-
age newspapers, two Spanish, one Chin-
ese and two Tagalog, and all of them
accuse, expose, and complain. In addi-
tion, that is, to printing the normal
routine news of killings, kidnaps, rapes,,
holdups, assaults and robberies. Manila
is a crime-ridden city, under-policed, but
not lawless. There are at least three
known murders every week, probably
many unknown. In the Philippines every
Filipino has the right to carry a gun.
11/Tanila, a city of 20 radio stations and
seven television channels, many day
and night clubs and a thousand fac-
tories, covers over 15 square miles, and
has a population of a million and a half.
One hundred and fifty thousand of them
are believed to carry guns, though only
30,000 are licensed. At the entrance to
a radio station I read a notice which said
that guns must be parked with the re-
ceptionist. In this setting, the Filipinos’
passion for active and vitriolic policies,
which must inevitably involve the Head
of State, the most powerful of all poli-
ticians, can reach remarkable extents.
In April, 1963, a Congressman from
the Opposition party, the Nacionalists
Party, accused relatives of Macapagal of
improperly enriching themselves. At
once Macapagal ordered a police in-
quiry. He ordered his brother to make
a written statement on the cost of re-
pairs to his house and to explain the
source of the money. The charges were
groundless. When the cigarette smug-
gling racket became a national scandal,
a Senator handed the President docu-
ments allegedly implicating a Cabinet
Secretary, a Congressman, two generals
and nearly 50 other officials and leading
citizens. Macapagal passed copies of the
documents to the Press, which dare not
print them. Macapagal has taken over
the chairmanship of the investigating
committee, and has sworn to expose the
racket.
This has been Macapagal’s attitude to-
wards graft and corruption right from

the beginning of his career. Nobody
was surprised, therefore, when he was
sworn in as President that he published
a statement of his assets. They amount-
ed to $34,485. Yet in spite of all his
efforts, dishonesty persists at all levels.
“The port of Manila is so corrupt”, wrote
an American businessman in the “Far
Eastern Economic Review”, in 1963,
“that it has become a major burden to
the entire Philippines’ economy.” Man-
ila is one of the finest ports in the world.
President Macapagal faces all these
troubles as the champion of the common
man, the great believer in private enter-
prise. Annual per capita income of the
average Filipino is about 360 pesos,
which puts him fifth among the coun-
tries in Asia which have the lowest per
capita income, after Pakistan, India,
Thailand and Ceylon. As their self-
declared champion, the common man
in the Philippines expects a lot from
President Macapagal. He is one of the
most powerful men in the world: he
controls all executive departments, bur-
eaux and Government offices. He also
exercises supervision over Local Gov-
ernment. He is the commander-in-chief
of the armed forces. He is elected for a
term of four years and is eligible for a
second term. Macapagal is almost cer-
tain to be re-elected in 1965.
to the common man, in his
palace every Friday, President Maca-
pagal, powerful though he may be, is
subjected to criticism from political foes
as well as discontented common men.
Malacanang Palace, where he lives by
the Pasig River, was once the stately
country estate of a Spanish nobleman.
In 1863 it became the official residence
of the Spanish Governor. Subsequently,
the American Governor-General lived
there. From 1521 until 1899, the Philip-
pines was a Spanish colony, and these
three hundred and seventy years created
a Philippine culture which for the most
part is Spanish: but from 1901 until
July 4, 1946, the United States ruled
the Philippines, and the American influ-
ence continues to make a considerable
impact, and can even be noticed in cer-
tain ways in the Presidential palace.
No doubt the past has helped make
the Filipinos, . including Macapagal,
rather intense and touchy nationalists,
and sometimes their Asianism and their
nationalism can be aggressive and mili-
tant. Macapagal changed Independence
Day from July 4 to June 12, the anni-
versary of the day when the Filipinos
declared their independence from Spain
in 1898. Not because he was anti-
American, but because he was pro-
Filipino. Why did the Philippines so
long suffer subjection under the Spanish?

They were a courageous people, but they
lacked nationalism and leaders. History
has noted their spirit: they were never
servile. For a hundred years there were
occasions when the Dutch tried to cap-
ture the Philippines, but without success,
and the reasons for the Spanish victories,
one historian has recorded, included the
loyalty and fighting prowess of the Fili-
pinos. The British captured Manila in
1762, and treated the defenders badly.
But the following year, under the terms
of the Treaty of Paris, restored the
Philippines to the Spanish. This defeat
of the Spanish by the British caused the
Filipinos to realise that the Spanish were
not invincible, but another hundred years
were to pass before Filipino nationalism
began to grow strong.
Acknowledged as father of Filipino
nationalism, Jose Rizal was born in
1861. He was a genius. He spoke 22
languages. He was a physician and
writer. He wrote a book about the evils
of Spanish rule which made a tremend-
ous impression and gave birth to a spirit
of nationalism which spread throughout
the country. He formed a society dedi-
cated to the unity of the archipelago
into a compact, vigorous body. In 1896
the Spaniards executed Rizal after a
military trial where he was charged with
rebellion and sedition. This was the
biggest mistake the Spanish could have
made. Jose Rizal became a martyr, and
his death united the Filipinos as never
before. Soon the Spanish and the Fili-
pinos were at war.
Efforts were made to buy off the rebel
leader, General Aguinaldo. He accept-
ed the money to buy arms in Hong
Kong. Fighting continued. Then, sud-
denly, came American intervention. On
February 15, 1898,
the United States
battleship Ma i tie
was blown up in
Havana Harbor.
This gave the im-
perialistically - mind-
ed Americans of the
day the excuse they
had long awaited to
demand that the
Spanish evacuate
Cuba immediately.
Spain proudly re-
jected America’s de-
mand, declared war.
Almost within the
hour, an American fleet in Philippine
waters opened fire on nine Spanish war-
ships. They were all sunk. General
Aguinaldo, then in Singapore, hastened
to Manila, saw Admiral Dewey and laid
siege to Manila.
On June 21, 1898, the Filipino flag
was unfurled in the Philippines for the
first time. But by then America’s first
Expeditionary Force to go overseas had
reached Manila, and it was the Ameri-
cans and not the Filipinos to whom the
Spaniards surrendered the city. General
Anderson, commander of the American
forces, told the Filipinos to stay outside
the city. Then the Filipinos understood.
They were not independent. They had
new foreign masters. The Americans
paid Spain $2O million for giving up
their colony quietly. Filipino national-
ists refused to take this lying down.
Within a year the Filipino-American War
began, and lasted three years. General
Aguinaldo was captured in 1901; Malvar,
last of the Filipino leaders, surrendered
a year later. The Americans used
125,000 men to conquer the Philip-
pines. They passed a law making it a
treasonable offence for any Filipino to
advocate independence. Use of the Fili-
pino flag was banned. Filipinos became
nationals of the United States. As a
colonial power the United States follow-
ed the usual pattern of oppression.
But the clamor for independence
could not be stilled, and in 1935 Manuel
Quezon, largely - responsible for the
establishment of the Commonwealth of
the Philippines prior to complete inde-
pendence, became the first President.
Then the Americans promised absolute
independence by July 4, 1946. They
kept their promise in spite of the Second
World War, during which the Filipinos
suffered three dreadful years of Japan-
ese occupation. After 48 years of
American rule, the Philippines was free.
Manuel Roxas became the first President
of the republic.
In 40 years the Americans made Eng-
lish the dominant language. Although
the Spanish ruled for 400 years they
never succeeded in-making their langu-
age spoken through-
out the country.
This was simply be-
cause there were
never enough Spani-
ards in the Philip-
pines. They never
exceeded 4000. Nine
major languages and
about 80 dialects are
spoken in the Philip-
pines, but the three
official languages are
Tagalog, English and
Spanish. About 60
per cent of the
people speak Eng-
lish, nearly 40 per cent speak Tagalog.
Spanish is rapidly losing ground. Efforts
are being made to encourage the use of
Tagalog, but English is the language of
the Philippines’ 24 private universities
and other private and State educational
establishments. The Filipinos claim to
have one of the highest rates of literacy
in Asia: 75 per cent of the total popula-
tion can read and write. Unfortunately,
the Filipino teacher is poorly trained and
poorly paid, and the national educational
system inadequate. More than 600,000
children reach school age every year:
there are not yet enough schools for
them. “Hence,” wrote the editor of the
Philippine “Free Press” at the time of
President Macapagal’s installation, “the
spectacle of tens of thousands with
college degrees who are hardly literate.”
This is the background, historically,
economically, culturally, politically,

against which President Macapagal’s
domestic and international struggles and
policies must be judged. Of medium
height and build, quick-smiling, with the
professor’s traditional sloping brow,
smooth brown hair, steady, friendly eyes,
usually wearing the national dress, slacks
and barong Tagalog, a loose, transparent
shirt worn outside the trousers, Diosdado
Macapagal, President of the Philippines,
is a typical intellectual Filipino. He
has an inbred courtesy, kindness and
charm, combined with the exaggerated
politeness of the Spaniards, and all this
completely captivated Malaysia’s Tunku
Abdul Rahman when they met in Cam-
bodia early in 1964.
Like most Filipinos, Macapagal is
gracious and unassuming. On both
occasions when I met him, briefly, I was
reminded of this. An American writer
has called him a “gentle, tactful, brilliant
lawyer and academician who still occa-
sionally shows the naivete of a ‘pro-
vinciano’ when subjected to high-pres-
sure salesmanship”. That may be true.
My own impression is that Macapagal
is more calculating, less responsive, than
any other Filipino I have ever met. In
Cambodia, I had an opportunity, fleet-
ingly, to compare the genial, honest
charm of the Tunku with the smooth
politeness of Macapagal. Both were
lawyers, Macapagal the professor of law,
the Tunku an indifferent man of law,
but both were politicians and heads of
their Governments. I felt that the
Tunku probably had more sincerity,
more humanity. Macapagal, sitting next
to him, appeared more reserved, more
thoughtful perhaps; more calculating.
Jn Cambodia I saw Macapagal in for-
mal Western clothes, complete with
top hat. Ceremonial called for this. In
the Philippines, Macapagal has a genu-
ine concern for the common man and
an honest preference for the simple life.
When he became President he sold the
Presidential yacht which had cost $2.5
million. When he wants to relax he
plays billiards and talks with his family.
Like Asians generally, the Filipinos are
extremely family-minded. The family in
the Philippines is the backbone of the
nation. There are no poorhouses in the
Philippines, no social security schemes,
but there is family solidarity and respon-
sibility. The family looks after their
own old and workless.
Some of Macapagal’s fiercest critics
say that Macapagal has done this too
well: a brother is a provincial governor.
But Macapagal has weathered all these
storms. His private life, and his public
life, is totally devoid of scandal, and in
public speeches he does not fail some-
times to remind his opponents of this.
When he wants to get things done hur-
riedly he is often inclined to take short-
cuts, and so he is accused of being a
dictator. But there are many in Manila,
concerned for the common good, of the
opinion that Macapagal could, with effect,
be even more ruthless and dictatorial.
Much remains to be done in the Philip-
pines, as in other newly developed coun-
tries, and people are impatient for pro-
gress.
Yet traditions which hinder develop-
ment remain firmly rooted. No other
country in the world, for instance, has
such a long Christmas festival as the
Philippines. They enjoy 22 days of
fiesta.
Are the Filipinos lazy? Some are,
but not the farmers. They work in the
fields all day from early morning. What
must be remembered is that the climate
of the Philippines is hot most of the
year. Hot and humid. What I have
never been able to understand is why the
Filipinos, in their' many-island republic,
are not renowned fishermen. In the
waters around the Philippines are found
2000 species of fish, including the largest
in the world, the whale shark, and the
smallest, the Pandaka Pygmaes; yet,
though the Filipino is a good sailor, they
have to buy fish for food from Japan
and the United States.
President Macapagal has said that the
“role of the Philippines in Asia is to
demonstrate that democracy works”. In
spite of his dictatorial tendencies, people
close to Macapagal are convinced that
his belief in the common man and in
democracy is genuine. This makes the
contradictions which emerge through his
professed friendship with President Soe-
karno, the inventor of guided democracy,
and by his refusal to recognise demo-
cratic Malaysia, all the more remarkable.
A Malaysian, having lived many years
in Manila, offered a possible explanation
which he said is concealed in the char-
acter of all Filipinos. “All of them,”
he said, “are inveterate gamblers. They
are like the Chinese in this respect. They
will gamble on anything. Macapagal is
gambling that his fantastic claim on
Sabah might come off. He stands to win
a colony or, preferably, a tremendous
financial settlement. When he took on
his gamble he thought he had nothing
to lose. Now he can’t back out.” My
friend, probably biased, smiled. “Be-
ware,” he added, “Filipinos are notori-
ous as bad losers.”
M/hether, in fact, Macapagal gambled,
or misjudged, no matter what prin-
ciples may have been involved or were
lacking, whatever his motives, interna-
tionally he has lost status over his policy
towards Malaysia, his continued associa-
tion with Soekarno. Even Malaysian poli-
ticians would be reluctant to say this
publicly, though they believe this to be
true, because they do not want to make
it more difficult for Macapagal to with-
draw, as he must eventually, from a very
awkward position in which he now finds
himself.
For myself, believing in Macapagal
the man, I turn to his 1964 State of the
Nation Address for my ending of his
anti-Malaysia stand. Speaking to Con-
gress of the “errors of our ways” which,
he said, everyone made because “not
one of us is perfect”, Macapagal de-
clared: “The great sin is not in making
a mistake but in refusing to recognise
the mistake and to correct it.”
History will undoubtedly record that
President Macapagal helped to create a
grave situation in South-East Asia which
involved the peace and security of the
entire region when he cast covetous
eyes on Sabah, and became associated
with another President more likely to be
remembered for his rejection of demo-
cracy than his total failure to give suffer-
ing people food, clothes and houses.
After the 1964 SEATO Conference in
Manila, friends of the Philippines
thought they detected hopeful signs that
the mistake had been recognised, and
would be rectified.
It would probably be too much to say
that Sir Garfield Barwick’s restatement of
Australia’s unswerving military and poli-
tical support for Malaysia brought about
these signs; undoubtedly it contributed
as a reminder, perhaps to Macapagal the
family man, that in this part of the
world, as in others, there are family re-
sponsibilities among nations which sub-
scribe to common ideals. Macapagal
can ignore them at his peril.

Obscenity Loopholes
in Britain
LONDON
A new Bill intended to close “loop-
holes” in the present Obscene Pub-
lications Act is aimed in particular at
articles for reproduction.
The new Bill does not propose any
substantial change in the 1959 Act, but
is to avoid “shortcomings” revealed in
court cases since 1959.
It creates, for example, a new offence:
having an obscene article for publi-
cation for gain, thus making impossible
a repetition of a court ruling last year
that a photographic negative intended
for the reproduction of obscene prints
could not be forfeited because it was not
itself kept for publication.
If the Bill is passed the new offence
is to be punished with up to three years’

areas of confrontation with Red China,

Rowan said Soviet broadcasts in 10

He said that at the same time Russian

A suggestion made here by Kenya’s

States should wage a joint war against
South Africa. Mr Odinga appealed for
Chinese help in such a war.
The relevant part of Mr Odinga’s

it nor in the overseas transmission by
the official New China News Agency.
It could, however, be found on inside

Diplomatic observers, who tended not
to take the suggestion too seriously, felt
that China, despite her theories on just
war, would be extremely loath to commit
herself to taking part in any war against
South Africa.
They said the way out of what could
be an embarrassing situation could prob-
ably be found in a repetition of recent
pronouncements here that, although
“armed struggle” was the only course left
to non-white South Africans, they must
rely mainly on their own strength and

Black Muslims
and “Blood Brothers”
NEW YORK
A gang of 400 Negro youths, dedicated
to crime and attacks on white
people, has been formed in New York’s
teeming Harlem district, according to
“The New York Times.”
Police suspect that members of the
gang, ranging in age from 12 to the
20s, are responsible for four Harlem
murders of white persons.
According to a social worker in Har-
lem (the city's densely populated and run-
down Negro quarter) the youths were
being recruited by a rebel group of the
militant Black Muslim Movement.
Police investigation of the gang was
spurred by the fatal stabbing of a white
woman shopkeeper in Harlem last week.
The slaying of Mrs Margit Sugar, 45,
in her second-hand clothing store last
Wednesday apparently was unprovoked.
Coupled with the other three deaths in
Harlem, it gave rise to reports of a
racial vendetta, Associated Press of
America said.
Deputy Police Commissioner Walter
Arm declined to confirm or deny that
such a gang existed. Police would have
no statement “until we have something
on which we can take some action . . .
until we really know what we are talking
about,” he said.
Members of the youth gang called
themselves “Blood Brothers”.
Most of the rebel Black Muslims who
recruited the gang members belonged to
the Fruit of Islam, the security arm of the
Muslim organisation, whose members are
trained in karate and judo fighting
techniques.
The Muslims were believed to be
using the gang to build up a strong force
to oppose the police if trouble should
develop in Harlem.
(A spokesman for the 25,000 New
York policemen warned that if Negro
and white leaders did not reach accord
“we won't need Khrushchev to bury us,
we’ll bury each other.”) (AAP)

initialled a commercial agreement giving
Israel a foothold inside the Community’s
tariff wall for 20 of its agricultural and

The agreement was the result of three
weeks of negotiations which ended April
27 and was seen as the beginning of
increasing co-operation between the two
sides.
It was signed by external relations
Director-General Axel Herbst for the
European Commission and by Amiel E.
Najar, head of the Israeli mission to the
European Communities.
The agreement provides a reduction in
the Community’s common external tariff,
ranging from 10 to 40 per cent for
Israeli agricultural and industrial pro-
ducts and will be valid for three years.
The two sides also agreed to set up
a joint commission to watch over imple-
mentation of the agreement and note
trade trends between the Common Mar-
ket and Israel.
The agreement is renewable after the
first three-year period. (UPI)

LAUSANNE EXPOSITION
April to October, 1964
President Lazarno Gardenas and his
expropriation of foreign oil companies
in 1938 and against Vincente Lom-
bardo Toledano, head of the “Marxist-
Leninist” popular Socialist Party.
The setting up of a pro-Peking union
group here was said to be part of a
world-w'ide movement resulting from the
Moscow-Peking dispute and having its
effects in the Russian-controlled world
Trade Union Federation. The latter
group has headquarters in Prague.
The May Day manifesto of the new
group describes the Mexican Govern-
ment as “A Capitalist Regime”, a bour-
geois dictatorship . . . dominated by
US millionaires and their national man-
agers.”
It says the Government is repressing
workers and keeps them submissive by
armed intervention or by deceit sowed
by “Gardenas, Lombardo, and other false
leftists.”
The manifesto, in keeping with the
Chinese ideological “hard” line, says that
existing Labor organisations are con-
trolled by the Government and subser-
vient leaders.
“Peasants are brutally oppressed . . .
millions suffer hunger and cannot find
work, are semi-slaves . . it charges.

“Enemy of the
People”
MOSCOW
Pilnyak, a prominent Soviet
novelist who was shot as an “enemy
of the people” in the Stalin purges of
the mid-19305, has been rehabilitated, it
was officially reported.
Pilnyak, who once wrote a novel in
which he hinted that Stalin ordered a
major surgical operation which led to
fhe death of famed war commissar Mik-
hail Frunze, is one of the last of the
dictator’s literary victims to be exoner-
ated.
Dozens of other who were arrested
or shot in the Stalin era already have
een rehabilitated and their banned
hooks republished.
Now the Writers’ Union of the Russian
e deration (RSFSR) has announced that

No Seat
for China
NEW YORK
Japanese Ambassador to the United
Nations, Akira Matsui, said he did
not expect Communist China to be
seated in the United Nations this year.
He said in an appearance on the
television programme “Ladies of the
Press” that it was difficult to predict the
forthcoming vote in the General Assem-
bly.
“There may be some shift in the vot-
ing,” he said, “but I don’t expect a
great change this year.”
Matsui also said he did not expect all
the former French Community Nations
of Africa to be influenced by the deci-
sion of France to recognise Red China.
He pointed out that Government leaders
he met on a recent trip to Africa were
eager to show that they have independent
foreign policies.
“They may think about, maybe, a
reappraisal of their policy possibly, but
at the end I don’t think there will be
such a great shift in their voting,” he said.
He added that he did not think Japan
should make a “rush” decision on the
question of recognising two Chinas.
Matsui said he doubted that Japan
could contribute troops to any United
Nations permanent peace-keeping force
because of the “no-war” clause in the
Japanese constitution. He also said “our
treasury people would always think
twice” before consenting to support such
a force financially.
He said it was difficult to assess United
States influence in Asia but that the trip
of Attorney-General Robert F. Kennedy
to South-east Asia was “very timely and
extremely good.” (UPI)

Taking the War
To Hanoi
ITHACA, New York
PPran Van Chuong, former Ambassa-
dor to the United States from South
Vietnam, said that the war in his home-
land must be pushed into North Vietnam.
“This must be done, however, with
strategic bombings of factories and
bridges in order to keep fatalities among
the peasants of North Vietnam as low as
possible,” he said.
Chuong, who publicly broke with his
daughter, Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, last
year after her family was thrown out
of power in a military coup in South
Vietnam, blamed the Communists for
his country’s troubles and said the people
themselves were not to be held respon-
sible.
“The best defence is a good offence,”
Chuong said in a radio-television inter-
view.
Chuong was here to speak at Ithaca
College on the subject “Is Neutralisation
of Vietnam Possible?”
Noting that he was not a military
strategist, Chuong said the possibility
of Communist China’s entering the war
in full force if fighting is pushed into
North Vietnam is a “chance that must
be taken.” (UPI)
Another
Dien Bien Phu?
PEKING
/China’s main Communist newspaper,
“People’s Daily”, said that if the
United States persisted in its present
South Vietnam policy, “the result will
be another Dien Bien Phu”. It was com-
menting on the Vietnam situation in an
editorial marking the 10th anniversary
of Fall of Dien Bien Phu which, it said,
“brought final victory to the Vietnamese
people in their protracted war against
French Imperialism”.
The editorial, using the occasion to
make another indirect attack on Soviet
peaceful co-existence theories, said it was
“utter nonsense” to believe there were
no longer any just wars as distinct from
unjust wars.
“Wars waged by oppressed nations
against aggression and enslavement . . .
are always just . . .” it declared. (AAP.)
British Trade
With Cuba
LONDON
T>ritain is determined to stand firm by
her trade-with-Cuba policy, despite
renewed American pressure against it.
Government sources said Britain re-
grets she cannot join the American
embargo on trade with Cuba and will
continue to deal with the Havana regime
on a strictly commercial basis.
“We, too, have an election coming,”
said an authoritative source, implying the
Conservative Government cannot ignore
internal pressures from the Laborite
opposition for more overseas trade in
the light of the general election in
October.
The conflict with the United States
over Cuba trade is causing considerable
embarrassment and uneasiness in Gov-
ernment quarters where it is claimed
there is no alternative but to continue
to trade with Premier Fidel Castro.
President Johnson’s criticism of
British—and French—trade policy with
Cuba was seen as proof that Foreign
Secretary R. A. Butler has failed to con-
vince the American Executive of the
legitimacy of the British case.
Authoritative sources reiterated that
Britain cannot halt trade deals with Cuba,
with whom she has normal diplomatic
relations. Britain also disagrees with the
United States’ view that a trade embargo
is a suitable means of fighting a hostile
regime. (UPI.)
New Deal for
S-W Africa
CAPE TOWN
TTnited Party opposition leader Sir
De Villiers Graaff announced a
“New Deal” plan for South-West Africa.
The plan counters the Nationalist Gov-
ernment’s Bantustan proposals for the
Mandated Territory.
The United Party said its plan will
give the Africans of South-West Africa
more say in their own affairs and keep
the administration of the territory closer
to the spirit of the Mandate.
It said the plan will give more power,
instead of less to the South-West African
Legislature, including handing over con-
trol to them of non-white affairs.
It would recognise the division of t ®
country into Northern and Southern
regions with legislative bodies for eac
and would create a federal link between
the two regions and South Africa. (UP ■'

to keep abreast of the needs of an exploding population. The ways and the

That equals 247,000 loaves of bread. As a major producer of

From Golden Boy
to Grey-ing Eminence
The come-back of “ Jackie ” Hughes
By FRED WELLS
Still handsome, though running a
little to fat, his wavy hair now
nearly grey, and his moustache as
immaculately groomed as ever, he con-
tinues to look a pillar of bourgeois
respectability. Twenty years ago he
was the Golden Boy of the Labor move-
ment, and, though probably already a
Communist, almost controlled the ALP
and saw himself as the coming Com-
munist Front Premier of NSW.
Now after all these years behind the
scenes, and almost forgotten by the pub-
lic, Jack Hughes—former Vice-President
of the NSW ALP, former President of
the NSW Labor Council, and former
NSW Secretary of the Clerks’ Union —
has emerged again in the wider arena
of South-East Asia as front-man for
Moscow in a Peking-dominated region.
He never became the Communist Pre-
mier of NSW, but he is at least a
Foreign Secretary for Moscow, with
duties from Colombo to Djakarta and
Wellington.
What gave him his chance was the
Sino-Soviet split. Indeed this split has
given the Australian Communist Party
as a whole a new role. Since this Party
is the only one in or near Asia which
supports Mr Khrushchev, Moscow is
increasingly looking to it to help win
the Asian Communists away from
loyalty to Peking. The Communist
Party of Australia is once again, in
Moscow’s eyes, as important as it was
in the days when a younger L. L.
Sharkey was on the executive of the
Communist International and a voice to
be reckoned with in South-East Asia.
And none is better suited to this work
of tactful unification than the man who
once manipulated the whole Labor Party
in NSW in the name of Unity. Busier
now than ever, he recently returned
from Colombo claiming success against
the Pekingese; before that he was lobby-
ing with the New Zealand Communists
(with less success); soon he may be off
to Djakarta to keep Aidit from full
commitment to Peking.
The career of Morris John Rodwell
Hughes covers one of the most extra-
ordinary chapters of the story of Com-
munist infiltration of the Labor move-
ment. Born into a staunch Labor
family in 1910, he joined the then in-
significant Clerks’ Union in 1929 at the
age of 19. By March, 1933, he was
Assistant Secretary-Organiser of the
union. From this base he moved into
ALP and Trades Hall circles and, quick-
witted, likeable, dandyish, was soon
known as “the golden voiced boy-
orator of Labor”, a .coming man, per-
haps a new Holman.
Exactly when Hughes became a
member of the Communist Party is not
certain. He says he did not join until
1943, but ex-Communists vow he was
a member of the Party by 1936. In
any case from 1936 on he carried out
Communist policy after conferring with
high-ranking Communists.
In March, 1937, he was elected Vice-
President of the Labor Council and
spent most of his time at the Trades
Hall building an anti-Lang machine,
known as the Hughes-Evans faction
(Evans being an older comrade and
“front” man). By 1938 he was Presi-
dent of the Labor Council and was
strong enough to call on the ALP
Federal Executive to recognise his fac-
tion, instead of the Lang machine, as
official Labor in NSW.
He was riding high. At the historic
Unity Conference convened by the
Federal Executive in the Elizabethan
Theatre, Newtown, in August, 1939,
Hughes finally became Vice-President of
the ALP itself with Evans as secretary.
Redoubling his efforts, he planned a
complete victory at the 1940 State ALP
Conference and to place Communists
in safe Labor seats. But his come-
uppance was approaching.
The war against Hitler was on
then, of course, and Stalin was allied
with Hitler. At this point Hughes and
the Communist Party made their fiJ
big blunder. They tried to push tU
Labor Party into supporting Hitler anl
Stalin. When he read out his pJ
Stalin resolution to the Conference, fid
golden voice suddenly began to sound
like brass: “Hands off Russia is tbs
policy of the Labor Movement today j,
it has been in the past. We must nod
permit the imperialists or the military
dictatorship group to interfere agains
a country where at least they haC
abolished capitalism.”
The ALP passed the resolution! B: j
only gradually did Hughes realise tk f
the extreme Right-wingers and Lang-ii;.
had voted for it —to discredit 4s
Hughes machine in the public mis:
Hughes never recovered from 4
victory.
Meanwhile his grip seemed as sta t
as ever. He won a vote of confides:.
from the Labor Council; he prepared:,,

small, insignificant body into a strong,
lilitant organisation. He was finally de-
bated in 1951, and there was no longer

He was put in charge of the Party’s

enteel, democratic facade and rename

At the Party’s 16th Congress in 1951,
iughes delivered one of the most re-
markable of contemporary political
pteches, in which he called on Party
lembers to pimp on fellow members.
“There is a tradition in Australia,”
e said, “which assists in the covering
p of mistakes, of remaining silent about

Around Melbourne
THE OYOHUS OF THE PRAM BELT
T ast week on this page your
pioneer misled you a trifle. He
suggested that the most exciting enter-
tainments available in Melbourne on
a Sunday were the Botanic Gardens
and animals live at the Zoo and
stuffed at the Museum. This, of
course, was completely overlooking
the marvellous craze of the ’sixties—
looking at “display” houses. Indeed,
one trembles to think what it will be
like now that Mr Bury has introduced
his Home Savings Grant Bill with
its lovely £250 grant. Even with the
Bill still warm in his hand the ads
have started to appear: “Honey-
mooners! Visit Our Dream Sites This
Weekend. Plan Your Future Now.
Deposit, £250.”
The thing to do is to go out to
what we call the Perambulator Belt
into darkest Doncaster and nicest
Nunawading. You look at the classi-
fied ads on a Saturday morning, then
plan your day. For example, a short
time back there was a beauty, a
£150,000 display village at East Don-
caster. The traffic jams were two
miles long and 32,000 people surged
through in the first weekend.
The terminology takes a little
understanding. An OYOHU is an
own - your - own - home - unit and an
OYOV is an own-your-own-villa. The
FLAT, you understand, is outdated.
Then you will see EXPOSITION
homes advertised as opposed to mere
EXHIBITION homes. With an
exposition home you are entitled to
expect a display on a grander style,
rather like the New York World
Fair. You get the big sell. For
example, on a recent excursion I
found an exposition house with a huge
board outside which read: THE
FUTURAMIC SHEERLINE. This
did not confuse an old hand. I
checked the classified ads and realised
at once that it was the SF BV 3 spac.
bedrm., WW carpets, BIW robes,
EHWS that I had been reading about.
Apart from expositions there has
been a swing to Old England. You
get a triple-fronted, dream kit., BV
named “Tewkesbury Manor” or a
white brick SP lounge DD to dining-
rm called “Canterbury Mews”.
These houses are being built on
“closes”. A name like Salisbury Close
has a dignity not carried by a mere
Salisbury Street. Actually close really
means close to the street, close to your
neighbors and close as all hell on a
hot day.
TV and films also have had their
influence. You can buy a Sun Valley
or a Houston home. We did one time
have an estate called Sunset Strip, and
I believe people were very nearly
injured in the rush to get Number 77.
Some of the high quality display
houses are fully furnished. The dining-
room tables are set, with the best wine
glasses on the table. The bookshelves
are littered with well-thumbed copies
of Homer in the original Greek,
Balzac, Proust, Mary McCarthy, just
to indicate that people of culture and
distinction go for houses like these.
Tn order to get some first - hand
material on the display house
business I drove to darkest Doncaster
and picked a house I would be ’’proud
to own, and packed with quality
features for family living”. At the
door there was a young, tired-looking
gentleman who handed out pamphlets
from a box as you walked through.
He said about 30,000 people had been
through this house in the past few
months.
“What do you think?” he said.
“For most of them it’s just a nice way
of spending the afternoon, better than
the pictures. I guess about 20 per
cent of them have a vague idea that
they want to buy something. Less
than one in a thousand ever do any-
thing about it. Gee, you get real
nuts. One couple have been back
every week for over a year. If they
ever build they’ll sure be missed from
the circuit.”
Actually, it wasn’t easy to hear
what he was saying. Some little kids
were flushing the toilet in the bath-
room. and in the next room a honey-
moon couple were inspecting the
sand-blasted sailing ships on the
dining rm DGDs. Some loud re-
marks also were being made about
the feature wall and the feature ceil-
ing.
The gentleman said that many
people, of course, just came looking
for ideas on colorings, furnishings aoiiil
so on. Then frequently they take
those ideas home with them. They
would take door knobs, taps, towel
rail, globes, fluorescent tubes, shower
sprays anything that could be un-
screwed or lifted. One of the more
notable pieces of souveniring in receit
years was the house that lost a bath-
room cabinet and a stove out of the
kitchen.
Then there was the hideous prob-
lem of keeping the place clean. As
the end of the day it was rather like
the outer at the MCG. You had to
remove all the chewing gum, toffee
paper, sweep up the icecream sticks
and restore the missing door handles..
Despite such ads as: “You Can
Have A 4-Bedroom Dream Home On
Your Land For £25 Full Deposit",,
the housing situation in Victoria is not
as dreamy as one might wish. Last
week the Brotherhood of St Laurence
produced a booklet titled “High Reels
and Low Incomes”. It said that there
was a vulnerable group of at least
55,000 Victorian families who were
living on £2O a week or less. They
had virtually no hope of getting suit-
able housing at a price they coukil
afford.
The Brotherhood gave some ex-
amples. Some paid £6 a week for two)
rooms separated by a passageway.
There was an old two-storey terrace
house in North Carlton with holes in
the walls, water stains on the ceilings,
four bedrooms let at 11 guineas a
week, and the tenant had been asked
to leave because the landlord cooM

Typical rents paid by 23 families 5®
the study was £5 a room. Things
were very tough for deserted wives;
the seven children of one of the®

the Housing Commission added a fa®'
of these places to their list of display
houses, so that all Victoria could look
at them on their wonderful week-end
round.

A Master of Violence
Henri-Georges Clouzot's shock-tactics
BY BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Spies. Director, H.-G. Clouzot.

Dlouzot’s “Les Espions”, made in the
1950s before the same director's
‘La Verite”, is apparently yet another

after their production. Still, at that, we
jire specially favored: apart from some
inenthusiastic showings in its native

according to some reports it has been
panned in other countries.
The lack of any mention of “Les
pspions” in lists of the director’s work
!nay indicate that Clouzot himself hoped
t would sink without trace. It does have

onipetent enough, was undistinguished
*y the characteristic touch of Clouzot,
sually a highly individual director.
Clouzot first came to international
otice with “Le Corbeau”, made during
he war. Its postwar release was some-
what delayed because the film (about an
nonymous letter-writer whose mischief
ays bare the hatreds and jealousies
'eneath the stolid surface of provincial
fe) had commended itself to the Nazis
s a revelation of the corruption of-
rench society. Though this wasn’t the

vincial settings (even when he uses a
Paris background it is so self-contained
that it is more like a small town than
part of a great city); he has a predilec-
tion for characters who are out of kilter
and a delight in showing the departures
from the norm beneath a respectable
surface.
Above all he is, at his best, a master
of the house-of-cards style of film con-
struction, wherein a director heaps shock
upon shock, or absurdity upon absurdity,
finally leaving the strange structure
standing in improbable defiance of all
the laws of balance and gravity. Hitch-
cock and Rene Clair have brought off
this trick, which looks deceptively simple
and haphazard. In “The Wages Of Fear”
and “The Fiends” Clouzot accomplished
it triumphantly, tightening the tension
again and again to its apparently final
point, only to apply another turn of
the screw which miraculously didn't ruin
everything.
TTe has tried this in “Les Espions”, but
time and again the card-house falls
into a fiat and meaningless jumble, and
though Clouzot picks up the pieces and
starts over, this is a game at which
there is only one chance.
A doctor, despairingly administering
a failing psychiatric clinic, is offered
money by a mysterious stranger merely
for sheltering an agent for a few days,
after which the clinic is invaded by
sinister undesirables and the doctor be-
comes deeply and unwillingly involved.
This theme could be treated in several
ways, and unfortunately Clouzot has had
a go at all of them. Skittish humor of
the Hitchcock type is juxtaposed with the
horrific macabre, not to mention philo-
sophic considerations of the Duerrenmatt
type about the dilemma of the honest
simpleton lost in a world made for, and
by, crooks and twisters. All valid atti-
tudes, of course, but they cancel out.
There are traces of the real Clouzot in
the film, especially in the imaginative
soundtrack, which extracts full value
from a jangling telephone or the simul-
taneous scream of brakes and victim
in a motor crash; and the acting (Peter
Ustinov, Martita Hunt, Sam Jaffe, Vera
Clouzot) is generally stylish. But if, as
seems possible, Clouzot hoped that “Les
Espions” would be forgotten, he is un-
likely to be disappointed.

Tucker’s World
Albert Tucker. Australian Galleries.
Melbourne.
Tucker's exhibition of a
couple of years ago introduced his
brolgas and vivid green landscapes. In
his present exhibition they continue to
form a large section of the painting,
along with the much more familiar
Antipodean Head symbols. It is a
strong exhibition from a blunt, coherent
and experienced artist.
Perhaps more than most artists’ whole
work, Tucker's repays study and com-
parison over a long period. Symbols
which were fundamental to his urban
surrealism of the ’forties, like the red
crescent lips, occur in his most recent
painting. He appears to waste very
little, but rather to worry an idea until
it fits his firm line of development. He
does not use many symbols, and those
he does, carry, as a result, a very
heavy accretion of meaning. The Anti-
podean Head for example makes plain
reference to landscape, in texture and
cratering, to historical and social obser-.
vation, and to legendary archetypes of
the bushman as well as to a number
of private experiences not obvious in
the painting but nonetheless important
to the painter. It has developed too
from his own painting and hence evokes
reminiscences of earlier meanings and
other situations. Thus, to use his own
term, his images metamorphose con-
stantly, from person to landscape, and
act as rich symbols of a tough and
penetrating vision of Australia.
The landscapes and brolgas seem only
superficially different from the Heads.
For one thing the image of Pan (derived
in its turn from Cretan and Minoan
forms of axe and horns) which is super-
imposed in many pictures on the Antipo-
dean Heads asserts quite clearly Tucker's
harsh and frightening approach to land-
scape; and this approach is pursued
consistently through his birds and green
landscapes. They are not at all pretty
for all their iridescent colours. Tex-
tures are rough; soft landscape cliches
are assaulted head-on; the brolgas them-
selves. though superbly graceful, have
the same sharp dark heads as the bril-
liant parrots which slice the eye-sockets
of the Antipodeans.
I think with these paintings we are
seeing a shift in interest, possibly caused

simply by Tucker’s having moved to the

CBS —BP 233081.
T>arallel to the pride and interest w'e
A Australians are at last showing in
the talents of our w'riters and artists is
a growing awareness of our long-
neglected traditional songs and ballads,
and this has produced a comparatively
new figure in our entertainment w'orld—
the professional singer of folk songs.
In the United States, with W'hom we
have a “new world” kinship in this
respect, this stage w r as passed through
some years ago; a conscious revival of
interest in their folk heritage began in
the late ’thirties. To arouse enough
public interest to support a revival of
this sort, it seems necessary to sugar-
coat the pill. Lionel Long, our only
folk-singer so far to achieve a national
reputation, has been accused by the
purists of doing just this, but w'e prob-
ably need our Lionel Longs just as
America needed its Harry Belafonte, its
Josh White, and its Kingston Trio.
Folk song enthusiasts consider that
Gary Shearston, a 25-year-old Sydney
performer, is making our indigenous
songs palatable without sacrificing
authenticity. This recording is the
realisation of an ambition of Gary’s to
do for the songs of Australia what Pete
Seeger has done for American folk
songs.
Enough potential is revealed to
indicate that he may eventually succeed
in this. Meanwhile, he has given us one
of the pleasantest folk albums so far.
His general approach, like most of our
young folk-singers, is a little self-
conscious, a condition W'hich experience
and maturity should eradicate. I find his
delivery far too polite to suit most of
the songs; indeed, at times, he appears
to have a plum in his mouth.
His choice of songs is, on the whole,
pleasing, but our heritage in this regard
is not as rich as some would like to
think, often showing an appalling lack
of invention. Included here is a recently-
composed Victorian song (“Our Fathers
Cleared the Bush”) which is difficult to
take seriously. In sentiment and melody
it is commonplace and banal, in fact not
much improvement on those dreadful
imitation “cowboy” songs.
“Lachlan Tigers” (a shearing-shed
opus) and “The Overlander” are given
rousing treatments as are two Henry
Law'son poems (“The Bush Girl” and
“Reedy River”) which have been set to
music. What w r e appear to need at this
stage is an Alan Lomax to collect
material and to take a tape recorder to
the source before it’s too late.
Accompaniment, in which Shearston’s
guitar is supported by a second guitarist-
banjoist, is adequate.
Gary Shearston acknowledges his
indebtedness to America’s “Mr Folk
Music”, Pete Seeger, and, during Seeger’s
visit to this country last year, the two
met and exchanged songs.
In “The Bitter and the Sweet”, made
during a personal appearance at a Green-
wich Village folk club, Pete Seeger
proves himself to be an experienced and
natural entertainer in this medium.
Better than anyone, he bridges that awk-
ward gap between the authentic and the
commercial. In a baker’s dozen of songs
of English, Scottish, Spanish, and
American Negro origin, his rather reedy
voice expresses an enthusiasm which has
manifestly infected the large audience.
They even join him on some of the
choruses with surprisingly good effect.
Pete Seeger (a classmate of the late
President Kennedy at Harvard) has
devoted his life to American folk music;
constantly travelling, performing, collect-
ing, w r riting music and lyrics, it is not
surprising that he is acknowledged as
king of the folk revival.
One is struck by his versatility; few'
could tackle such diverse songs as Huddie
Ledbetter’s “Mr Tom Hughes's Town”,
the well-known “Barbara Allen”, and
the Spanish “Juanita” with equal success.
A feature of the album is “We Shall
Overcome”, the theme song of the inte-
gration movement in the American
South.
Where Seeger particularly gains over
Australian folk-singers is in his own
expert and always appropriate accom-
paniments whether on regular guitar, 12-
string guitar, or banjo. “Living in the
Country”, an original instrumental num-
ber, is delightful.
It is interesting to note that the re-
cording was by New' York socialite, John
Hammond, who (in the allied jazz field)
has probably discovered and encouraged
more talent than anyone.
There is still a lot for Gary Shearston
and other Australian folk-singers to learn
from Mr Seeger.

A Resounding Tinkle. N. F. Simpson.
The Lunchtime Theatre. St James
Hall. Sydney.
Othello. Shakespeare. New Theatre,
Sydney.
/\ke regrets that a venture as worthy as
the Trust's revival of its Lunchtime
Theatre should get off to a lame start,
Worse still, to a lame start that ought
to have been prevented—for miscasting
is something that shows up early enough
to be repaired.
This remarkably facile and potentially
very funny short play by N. F. Simpson,
after lonesco's style, needs just the right
sort of playing—a complete normalcy
in the midst of the idiotic lines —and if
it does not receive this, then the whole
issue falls flat. Unfortunately, Lynne
Murphy, in one of the main roles, and
Anna Volska, in a somewhat smaller role,
both contrived to give the snooty im-
pression that they really should not have
been mixed up in such a piece of drivel
at all. When players are seen to lad
confidence in their vehicle, they can
hardly expect their paying public to step
aboard for the journey.
I hesitate to blame Robin Lovejoy,
one of our very few good producers. But
someone has lapsed, and either this
present cast must be pulled into shape,
or replaced. I except from all these
strictures the only other player, Frank
Taylor, who struck exactly the right note
in everything he said and did.
Apart from the playing, discussed
above, the play itself has quite a special
humor to offer. Simpson plays on
accepted rhythms and forms of sentence,
forcing one to accept what his characters
are saying as perfectly sensible until hi
substitutes, for instance, a book for a
cup of tea: "Sit right down and have
a nice poem”, or "I wonder if we really
needed a new elephant this year”. And
before long. Simpson's off-centre logic
imposes itself and takes you into 3
delightful world of pretty, female uncles;
of suburban couples who trade in an
antelope for a brand-new boa constrictor.
You may even come away thinking that
it’s just as funny as your neighbors
trading in their last year's Holden.

Edmund Allison’s production has gone
for a straightforward vigorous style, with
military bluffness as the dominant mode.
Unfortunately, if one strips Othello down
to being merely a soldier, much of his
magic goes with it. He was, by the play’s
witness, a great general, a man of fire
and poetry as well as fighting prowess.
He had voice and vocabulary of a range
istarry enough to bewitch Desdemona—
and this ability in love must come
through even the most trimmed produc-
tion of the play.
If Othello’s passion is not clearly
marked in the playing, then his terrible
jealousy and its bloody end comes as
some sort of incredible, isolated accident.
I think New Theatre has somehow made
an attempt to scale Othello down —and
Siis strikes me as a reasonably fore-
doomed venture even with the best of
casts.
Costumes and settings are excellently
done, and the play’s action unfolds most
jclearly, but having said this, that is all
that can be said. None of the playing
.reaches anything near the right stature,
and one can only hope that the theatre
ivill buckle down to far more rigorous
:raining on Shakespeare, and the way
o speak him, before putting him on dis-
play again.

Quality Soap
Coronation Street. Channel 9. Sydney.
“/Coronation Street” is the sort of
show you should hate, or rather
ignore, in the same way as you hate or
ignore “Blue Hills” or “When A Girl
Marries”. But whereas I find it very
easy to hate “Blue Hills” and ignore
“When A Girl Marries” (I can’t do any-
thing but), “Coronation Street”, tele-
vision’s first endless, storyless soap opera,
is like some sort of Liverpudlian opiate.
And it is in many ways as brilliant
as it is habit-forming.
Set within the strict physical and
mental confines of one North of England
industrial block, it is a sympathetic but
nevertheless objective study in working-
class morality. For all its grimy senti-
mentality and exaggerated Christianity,
“Coronation Street” is rarely maudlin
and only occasionally is its dishonesty
calculated. Its humanity is genuine, and
I find it impossible not to be drawn into
its penny-pinching optimism and in-
sularity. I worry about Elsie Tanner
and sympathise with Minnie Caldwell;
I care what bitchiness Ena Sharpies gets
up to next week. “Coronation Street”
is brazen, emotional pickpocketing, and
I for one am a willing victim.
Why, though, it is not easy to explain.
Probably the domesticity and drabness
of the industrial slums are far more real
than the cheap over - sophisticated
escapism or self-righteous hypocrisy that
are the main fare of most American
series. The sedentary, dingy existence,
with all its simple pleasures and crises,
that those who live in “Coronation
Street” act out, has a reality and a
humility very refreshing after all those
“glamorous” doctors, lawyers and private
eyes. Virtually nothing happens—Karel
Reisz’s film of “Saturday Night and
Sunday Morning” seems sensationalised
by comparison—because to such people
nothing ever does happen, and so the
scale of values has adjusted and the
trivial becomes (to them) vital. And
because “Coronation Street” is so ad-
mirably realised in writing, production
and performance, it becomes vital also
to what is, in fact, an alien audience.
In England “Coronation Street” is an
institution. Most likely it is too foreign
to get such a response in Australia,
although for all its homilies and un-
abashed schmaltz its characters are
believable and likeable, and it is always
entertaining. As a television soap opera,
it works.

The Ordeal of Burley Griffin
From Canberra to Incinerators
By PAT WESTCOTT
Walter Burley Griffin. James Birrell.
Queensland University Press. 105 s.
Tt would surely be difficult to find a
more grotesque case in Australia’s
history of ill-treatment of an overseas
migrant than the record of frustrations
and abuse suffered by the unwitting
winner of the architectural plan for the
city of Canberra, Walter Burley Griffin.
He arrived in Australia as the designer
of the nation’s capital, chosen from 137
competitors, to end his career in this
country 24 years later as a designer of
public incinerators.
It took an upsurge of nationalism, a
searching for past heroes, and the 50th
anniversary of Canberra’s foundation to
arouse the Australian conscience, and
last year, a decade after his name was
scarcely known (a Melbourne news-
paper referred to him then as “Bailey
Griffith”), derision was overborne by
acclaim, a stamp was issued bearing his
portrait, and the great lake scheme he
envisioned for Canberra was given his
name.
Just how outstanding a figure Griffin
was, a partner rather than a pupil or
imitator of the internationally famous
Frank Lloyd Wright, and the enormous
debt Australian architecture as a whole
owes to him, have been absorbingly
detailed in this recently published book
by Queensland University Press, care-
fully researched and written by the
Architect Planner to the University of
Queensland, James Birrell.
Birrell's book is bound to be followed
by some considerable recasting of the
architectural giants in America. Birrell
has unearthed a strange relationship bet-
ween the work of Frank Lloyd Wright,
self-styled greatest architect of the last
five centuries, Walter Burley Griffin, who
was Wright's co-partner for five years
between 1900 and 1905, their common
roots in the work of the famous Louis
H. Sullivan, of the Chicago School, and
Griffin's brilliant wife, Marion Mahony,
for some years a senior in Wright's
office. After his departure from Ame-
rica to supervise the Canberra plan,
Birrell says Griffin rarely referred to
Wright, who, in turn, dismissed him
slightingly as “a draughtsman who went
to Australia”. Marion Griffin, when-
ever she alluded to her former employer,
implied that in some way he had acted
disloyally to the cause of “democratic
architectural principles”. In the Ar-
chives of the New York Historical
Society there is a twelve-volume auto-
biography by Marion Griffin. “Unfor-
tunately it is a very bitter document
and may never be published,” says Bir-
rell, mentioning only that she suggests
certain of Griffin's plans were taken
under false pretences from Australia
and found their way to Wright.
On her arrival in Australia, Marion
Griffin expressed her own absorption in
her husband’s genius and said, “I was
proud to have the prize come our way.”
(She had executed many of the draw-
ings for the Federal Capital competition
in photodyes and watercolor upon
satin.) “Proud for my husband’s sake.
I can never aspire to be as great an
architect as he, but I can best under-
stand and help him, and to a wife there
is no greater recompense.”
TVsillusionment soon caught up with
the prizewinning Griffins, however.
“The departmental board appointed to
establish the Federal Capital was not,
Griffin found to his disappointment,
composed of the informed men who
had framed the conditions of the initial
competition. . . . Their only concern
appeared to be to discredit Griffin and
his city plan. They objected to the con-
ception of a large city on the ground
that it could never eventuate in Austra-
lia, and to a city divided by formal
lakes because there was no local pre-
cedent. Despite the inclusion of lakes
in their own scheme, substantially the
same as those in Griffith's plan, and not-
withstanding that the site had been
selected because of the facilities there
for developing large areas of ornamental
waters, the board said the lakes were
too expensive and technically impractic-
able.” Fortunately for Australia, a
Senate Select Committee in 1955, with
only one of its seven members dissent-
ing, advocated a restoration of such
Griffin showpieces as the Lakes Scheme,
and among other things Capital Hill,
City Hill and the Government Triangle,
saying, “It is a grand plan and some-
thing we should hold on to.” Sir
William Holford, Professor of Town
Planning at London University, appoint-
ed in 1957 to report on the develop,
ment of Canberra, agreed that the best
features of “Griffin's bold and imagi.
native plan” should be preserved.
Birrell’s account of the frustrations
which beset Griffin make conscience,
pricking reading today he found that
his official powers were ineffectual,
powerful jealousies were undermining
him, design and construction were de-
layed, contour maps were supplied a!
the wrong scale, often they became
“lost” and invariably contained mistakes
in one, a prominent hill being shown
as a depression! Wilfully false esti-
mates of cost were given and at a sub-
sequent Royal Commission Griffin
showed that he had not been advisee
about the erection of any of the build-
ings which had gone up since his
appointment, although buildings to tk
tune of £30,000 had been erected, noi
had he been consulted on the con
struction of municipal services upoi
which £196,000 had been spent.
Birrell, supported by Melbourne
architect and author Robin Boyd, \vh
writes a foreword to the book, state I
unequivocally that Griffin, despite
“extremely difficult odds, consolidate;
modern architecture in Australia”. Bov
said that “Griffin’s monuments remai:
in the plan of Canberra and in abot
a dozen buildings, mostly in Melbourne ]
which were as good as anything in tk
world at the time, and sometimes per
haps the best of their time, and have
weathered with credit the critical tes
of nearly half a century.”
Birrell claims that the Salter House
in Glyndebourne Avenue, Toorak, i
“more important to the development o'
Australian domestic architecture tha: <
any other house in the country, makin t
the first clear statements on the con ‘
temporary house in temperate Austra
lia”. Another Melbourne House, in Out j
look Drive, “illustrates how more arfr,
culate Australian architecture would no?<
be had Griffin been able to expand b| j
ideas after his migration instead of & [
pending himself in their defence.” ,p
Newman College, the Roman Catho E
lie residential college at the University -
of Melbourne, is the largest buildin! i
Griffin erected in Australia, and Birre s
says its design, giving the key (l) :
Griffin’s philosophy of life, has had w ;
reaching consequences. He
“the request of the donors for the bui

haps the success of Newman Cole?


can in part be attributed to the archi-
tect’s deep appreciation of past archi-
tecture and particularly the Gothic
civilisation.”
Of Leonard House, in Melbourne’s
Elizabeth Street, one of the most sophi-
sticated town buildings in Australia,
Birrell says it “does more with Vic-
toria’s temperate values of light and
shadow in its textures, projections and
interstices than any building since
built”. The Capitol Theatre in Swan-
ston Street gave the world “its first
cinema of the new architecture, as well
as Griffin’s masterpiece”. “Internally,
the theatre is a study of mannered space
experiences, entered through a high,
large, square foyer. From this foyer

cally shaped tunnel-like stairs lit by
lights reminiscent of Salvador Dali

. . . upon entry into the main audi-
torium the effect is breathtaking. . . .
With no visible means of support a
great number of geometric forms hover
80 feet overhead in an infinite spatial
composition.”
Interest is being revived in the “exci-
ing” architectural forms embellishing
some disused quarries around Melbourne
and Sydney of which one of the
“reverbatory incinerators” in Small
Street, Willoughby, is an example. The
ornament on the Willoughby Building
is the latest authentic essay in Chicago
School geometric ornament in the
world, Birrell says. “It cascades down
the cliff face like a frozen waterfall of
crystalline shapes.” Hit by the depres-
sion, Griffin explained the incinerators:
“The final test of modernism is the re-
placement of industrial eyesores with
public amenities. During the seven
years of depression whilst industrial
growth had stopped, I fortunately found
a field in which the architect could help
allay the suspicious fears and political
animosities sufficiently to enable a dozen
municipal authorities to determine upon
sites within their boundaries for re-
placing dumps and other unsanitary and
uneconomic methods of disposal of
public waste matter, with quicker inci-
neration in monumental buildings. It
has been intended in these buildings
also to awaken an aversion to the fun-
damentally uneconomic conditions of
industrial ugliness.”
Poor Griffin. But Australia, how-
ever late in the day, is awakening to
his fame.

The two books under review throw
light on what he meant. Both books
make it clear that nobody escapes a
share of the blame. In the past the
States were indifferent to the Aborigines,
hmng content to “smooth the dying
pillow’. The missionaries were ill-

°rward to a time when the Aborigines
are ass *milated and live, work and think
as white Australians. But Strehlow comes
str °ngly against assimilation in his
Pamphlet, and surely he is right. An assi-
policy is the logical result of
at supreme arrogance which leads us
Europeans to think that not only is our
way of life the best, but that civilisation
is synonymous with Northern European
standards. The issue is important for
it seems that the average white Austra-
lian will not accept the Aborigine until
he is a white Blackman. Or maybe
not until he is physically white? But
make him a white man so that his
own customs and past are completely
obliterated, and we, the white Austra-
lians, will be so much the poorer. It
is not just handicrafts and material
objects that enrich Australian culture
but the languages and different customs
and values.
Both authors point to some of the
ways forward. Greater use of local
languages should be made by teachers,
missionaries and Government officers.
Community as opposed to individual
development should be encouraged
through village advancement societies
and co-operatives which will help abo-
lish the demoralising handout system.
Those who want to be assimilated could
always move to the towns.
It is hard being a Blackfellow because
we demand complete conformity before
we accept. But do we really want one
race, one culture, one language, one
vast indifferentiated cultural mass?

“Only God could get your legs that
high!” So someone said to Joan
Crawford after she finished her taxing
role in ‘Torch Song”, singing and
dancing her way with slashed skirt and
freezing grin through a filmed novelette
that marked her temporary comeback at
M-G-M. But until the early 19505, no-
body got her legs high but Joan, whose
adaptable personality survived three
successive decades of film fashions. In
‘‘Dancing Lady” she Charlestoned fran-
tically amid whirling balloon clusters on
a crowded party table; in “Mannequin”
she clawed her way to riches in the rag
trade; in “A Woman’s Face” she was
scarred and mean, a Swedish nursemaid
with murderous notions enslaved by the
peerlessly corrupt Conrad Veidt into
getting her hands on a wealthy poppet
with black kiss-curls. In “Mildred
Pierce” she tried to trap Jack Carson in
her Malibu beach-house with Zachary
Scott’s corpse when her daughter had in
fact murdered Zachary; a waitress, she
swept from bungalow to mansion in
seven reels, leaving scattered lovers on
her path and living to see her daughter
get the gas-chamber. “The Queen Bee”
saw her haughty, cruel, gowned by Jean-
Louis, someone addressing this mean
home-wrecker with the words, “What-
ever you are, you're on wheels!” But
best of all was her snake-hipped Vienna
in “Johnny Guitar”, shooting it out in a
Western street at dawn in tight black
trousers with Mercedes McCambridge,
sneering and crop-haired, in butch
opposition.
“A Portrait of Joan”, decked on the
cover with exactly that in pastel shades

jaw locked and emeralds aglitter —is
wholly splendid as a portrayal of a

lessly professional, of an unshakeable
assurance, Philistine, gaudy, glittering
and more body than brain. Lately, as
High Priestess of a bottled drink concern,
she has buried a husband and stepped
off planes in jungle cities like a goddess
from afar. No doubt the natives bend
down and moan when they see her, as
they did to the Amazon queen in a
Tarzan movie long ago.
Garbo, known to the faithful only by


her second name, massive, secretive, the
Swedish Narcissa who always wanted to
play St Francis, has always attracted
women audiences as strongly as Joan.
A splendidly obsessive book, “The Films
of Greta Garbo”, compiled by three
devotees who have combed through
thousands of photographs and memora-
bilia, is a monument to her silent and
sound Hollywood career. The ghost in
a publicity machine, she survived even
the Talkies, leaning up against a door-
jamb in the opening of “Anna Christie”
and saying “Geef me a viskee babee, and
don’t be stingee” to a waiting world.
She got her viskees, plenty of them, until
by 1943 with the vanishing of her
European fans, she got nervous and
cleared out, keeping us guessing for two
decades about possible comebacks. An
escape-valve in the Depression era, main-
taining a mysterious aura that probably
concealed A Simple Soul, she has been
given here her final hagiography, in
pictures of the kind that were once called
“shimmeringly lovely” and an intro-
duction of wholehearted fatuity by
Parker Tyler. For addicts, a must.
“Where We Came In” is a bird-brained
run-through of British film history from
Friese-Greene and his Magic Box to —
or almost to Sidney Box and the
current crisis. Specialists will be in-
terested to learn that the late Robert
Hamer was involved in the Free Cinema
movement and that Ken Annakin
adapted “Blanche Fury”. There are the
usual envious stabs at trans-Atlantic pro-
ductions, and the old fallacy about the
American “Gaslight” being inferior to
the English one is repeated—along with
scores of others. “Where We Came In?”
Quite.

Jn his attack upon critics, “Ars
Poetica”, John Thompson presents
the case for the author as critic:
He, only he, profoundly feels and
shares
Creative hopes and wavering despairs,
Endures the flux of wasteful waiting
nights
And days of dumbness and of failed
insights,
Suffering, at the last and at the best
Self-criticism tearing at his breast.
Another thing the author knows is
that the night that redeems the wasteful
waiting, etc., is largely luck, and gener-
ally does not come until the poet has
splashed around in many spheres and
styles. Thompson and Hopegood have
certainly done that; Thompson with
poems about Melbourne life, overseas
travel, joyful return to Australia, war,
industry, telephone linesmen, with a
“Letter to a Friend” (modelled on the
second satire of Sir Thomas Wyatt) and
advice to young men; Hopegood with
mystic ballads, Australian backblock
ballads, a Scotch ballad, verse essays on
Caliban and Austral Pan as symbols,
and translations of Baudelaire and
Villaespesa.
In such searches for a poet’s own
voice the poet often succeeds by using
someone else’s because it is so much
easier to hear than his own, especially
when it is strongly inflected; and for this
reason “The Zettle-zitter” is one of
Hopegood’s most perfect things, not a
word out of place:
’E be zittin’ on ’is zettle i’ the shaade,
As ’e zcit when Mr Gladstone were a
blaade
An’ ’is memr’y grows as grin.
When ’e’s ’ad ’is drop o’ gin
As one o’ thiz-yeer vlow’rs wot never
vaade.
Thompson achieves something of the
same felicity with another English dia-
lect piece:
Now toil be ended once again,
They cows be out, they pigs be fed,
And thou and I, two weary men,
Be off to supper and to bed
Once more, mate, and once less.
In Hopegood’s collection the closest
to his own voice is “The Garden of
Refuse”:
Down in Poppin High Street, 1
roomed behind a shop,
And lived embowered in margarine,
and dill and lollipop,
And every window was an eye, and
every eye a-pop . . .
And John Thompson finds himself
when, throwing off his indignation, his
dutiful efforts to publicise the workers
and his maledictions, he makes delighted
discovery in “The Adventurers” of a
scandal among his own crowd:
One week more,
They slap each other’s cheeks in
Martin Place,
And straightway their artesian passion
jets
Anew. Oh, never have there been such
bores.
This is the triumph of his later style,
and with it should be mentioned “The
Photograph Album”, “Beside the River”
and “Biography”.
The title-piece of Grace Perry’s “Red
Scarf”, and “Cyanosis”, “Carcinoma”,
“Aneurism”, “Ovarian” and “The Sting
of Sleep” give a more delicate perception
of what a doctor thinks than may be had
from Dr Benjamin Casey’s TV appear-
ances. In the quiet undertone of these
reveries Dr Perry is on her specially,
compassionate and assured; it is a bil
dismaying to find her in the other poems
as confused and helpless as any of herl
patients with life’s most common disease
(i.e., love).

Colonial Girl
:emembered With Affection (Lady
Broome’s “Letters to Guy”). With
short life and notes by Alexandra
Hasluck. OUP. 355.
Nf tune with the prevailing vogue for
early Australiana, eager editors are
•mbing the correspondence of early
ilonists.
Curiously enough—probably because
ey had more time on their hands than
eir lords and because the trivialities
life had more appeal to them than to
e haughty Georgian and mid-Victorian
male—women are by far the best social
chroniclers of the early days.
Mrs John Macarthur, Mrs Meredith,
Lady Franklin, Rachel Henning—they
all illuminate their times better than the
retrospects of delving academics, and one
of the best of them was Lady Broome,
who was a real “colonial girl”. She was
born Mary Anne Stewart, daughter of
the last of the Island Secretaries of
Jamaica. A wanderer of the earth, she
first married Sir George Barker (a hero
of the Indian Mutiny) and then married
the Canadian-born New Zealand sheep
farmer, Frederick Napier Broome, who
lost his property having devoted most of
his time on it to “writing poetry and
hunting wild pig,” as described by his
wife in her cheerful and absorbing books
“Station Life” and “Colonial Memories.”
Broome returned to England, became a
well - known correspondent of “The
Times,” and published two books of
verse, while his wife —who continued to
be known as Lady Barker until her
second husband was knighted— -wrote a
cookery book and conducted a “child-
ren’s corner” in the Press.
After a sojourn in Natal where
Broome became Colonial Secretary, he
was appointed Governor of Western
Australia in 1882.
When she arrived in Government
House in Perth, she penned the attractive
“Letters to Guy” (to her son at school
in England) which in their day had
quite a vogue as family reading.
Alexandra Hasluck has done a good
job of editing this slight but socially in-
formative correspondence with a mini-
mum of disturbance of the text and
with her neat and nicely balanced notes
and biography.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
More Liquid Embarrassment
JUDGED on the buoyant flow of income into Treasury coffers
and an embarrassment of loan funds, the Commonwealth
Government is very conscious of the word “liquidity”.
Statisticians also must be impressed with the rise in the volume
/i money available to the Australian public, because these
unds rose by £sll million in the first nine months of the
:urrent financial year, or 12 p.c. more than for the corres-
ponding nine months to March 1963.
Much of the surplus cash available to the public has gone
nto savings banks and trading banks and, just in case the
aiblic should take a sudden fit to splurge this money, the
Reserve Bank took steps to freeze £lo9m. of trading bank
unds and to raise interest rates all round. Higher savings
ank interest helps to retain savings while higher overdraft
ates tend to curb the whim to spend or expand. The big
'orry to the Reserve Bank is whether John Public will get
red of all this liquid, cash-type money and decide to convert
into a new home, a new car or a batch of new Beatle
icords.
The worry is not helped much by the latest higher-than-
xpected Government receipts which now look like giving
ie Commonwealth Treasurer a much better result than the
udget deficit. And the latest £4om. Commonwealth Loan
1 guaranteed a huge success at the new long term yield of
•7 p.c. The cautious saver may deduce from this that there
ow is less justification for increased taxation in the next
udget and therefore less need to save. Also, with the
xpected increase in the basic wage, people tend to talk
bout another burst of inflation.
With all this abounding liquidity, businessmen are asking if
le Reserve Bank will make yet another call to SRDs, thus
phoning off more funds from the trading banks. The Aus-
alian Bankers’ Association doesn’t think so, because the
ormal June quarter run-down in liquidity is approaching.
°r Coombs, Governor of the Reserve Bank, has made it
U| .te c lear that his main concern is the possibility of a sudden
ft itch of liquid assets into other avenues. The trading banks’
lew ’ s by siphoning off bank liquidity, the Reserve Bank
1 n ot trying to affect bank lending rates but rather to reduce
,e banks’ demands for assets, with the aim of moderating
le pressures forcing prices of Government securities up and
Merest rates down. This action, reinforced by other Reserve
an m °ves such as open market sales of Government securi-
es an( l higher interest rates, has had a cautionary psycholo-
lca e^ec t- And the trading banks, faced with a normal June
uarter run-down in liquidity (after the bulk of export earn-
- I§s have been received by the end of April) will not be in
Position to bid up for Government securities in the next
ew months. On this basis, the banks hope there will be
10 father call up.
L e Bank earlier gave quantitative directions to the
a ln g banks, indicating that new lending commitments should
to around £lom. a week. The banks have kept
/• c ' ose to this, because new lending has averaged £ 10.1 m.
' ee k t°f the first four months of 1964. Additionally, this
new lending has been offset by reductions and cancellations
of limits to curb any incipient desires to use up some of those
available overdraft limits.
Despite all this, there still remains a strong pool of liquid
resources ready to convert into other assets. Traditionally,
some of these liquids would be spent on a rising trend of
imports. But there should be plenty left over to spend on
other things such as building (already booming), cars (still
buoyant) and retail sales (up £4om. in the March quarter
compared with the March quarter of 1963).
Strong Future for
Aluminium Products
jyjAKERS of end-products from aluminium don’t realise the
tremendous demand which lies ahead for items like
window frames and fittings, exterior wall panels in home
building, transportation equipment, automotive trims, and
other uses. This opinion, based on consumer trends in the
US, was expressed at an Alcoa Press conference in Sydney
last week headed up by Mr Lawrence Litchfield, Jnr, board
chairman and chief executive officer of Aluminium Company
of America.
If US trends are a guide to product uses, beer cans with
pull-open aluminium tops are going to be in big demand.
Mr Litchfield believes that excess productive capacity in
Australia’s aluminium industry is not a thing to be feared.
Past experience has shown the aluminium giants that demand
can spurt ahead quickly and the manufacturers can be caught
by not having sufficient excess capacity. The need to keep
ahead of demand also is an insurance against substitutes.
Big industrial organisations planning to use a material in,
say, automotive component manufacture must be assured of
immediate supplies of material which will not rise in price as
soon as they place big orders. Excess productive capacity
in the aluminium industry therefore places it in a strong posi-
tion to meet consumer demands for new products. This
has been an important consideration in the use of aluminium
for defence projects in the US.
Aluminium production requires long-term planning and
people like Aluminium Company of America are looking
a long way ahead. Strong and increasing competition in this
field also assures a favorable price level for consumers. At
least that’s the general message.
Despite the presence in Australia of several key executives
from other aluminium companies, Mr Litchfield said there was
no particular “consortium” significance in this although, in the
past, his company had joined with others on a particular
project. Doubtless, however, the visitors will be keeping an
eye on one another, particularly with Gove bauxite deposits
in the Northern Territory the subject of intensive bidding
from applicants like Reynolds Metals, Pechincy (France),
American Metals Climax Co., the Swiss Aluminium Corpora-
tion, and Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co. (Canada).


Private Industrial Investment
For Papua-New Guinea
design and intention of the newly formed private com-
A pany, Australia New Guinea Corporation Ltd, sound
reminiscent of the South-East Asia Development Corporation
Ltd, which began operations throughout Malaysia early in
1963. Though financial rewards from Papua and New Guinea
may come more slowly, it is well that something positive has
quickly emerged from the much publicised visit of a team
of Australian industrialists to the Territory in May last year.
In point of fact, the directors (Mr S. Rich, chairman, Mr
F. M. Hewitt, Sir James Kirby, Mr M. T. Hansen and Mr
F. M. Osborne) do see the necessity for getting down to work
vigorously. They have observed that “world pressures are
imposing a new timetable wTiich will call for greater emphasis
on speed in the development of the Territories in the private
as well as the public sector”.
So the corporation’s first management group hopes to be
active in Port Moresby by June
30, ready to move in accord
with overall policy proceeding
from Sydney headquarters.
A sense of urgency and the
economic realities will be held
in the proper proportion by Sir
John Crawford, who is to act
as special adviser to the board.
Sir John's vcell-known interests,
too, must enable directors to
relate their Territory activities
to the possibilities of the whole
South-East Asian area. He has
been a frequent advocate of
Australia's private and public
responsibilities here.
Initial paid capital looks
small at £250,000, but later
Territory and overseas partici-
pation should not be too difficult
to attract. Most significantly,
however, Australian banks and
insurance companies have not
proved tardy in joining the venture.
The presence of the life institutions at least guarantees a
source of genuinely long-term funds, the provision of which is
crucial to the success of most Australian developmental
efforts.
ANGC's directors speak decisively of seeking industrial
potential. Mr Hansen’s presence on the board seems to
promise an early interest in timber.
Yet Government policy aims strenuously to stimulate suit-
able secondary industries. Official encouragement will doubt-
less try to bring the company to direct much of its operation
in that direction.
The then Minister for Territories, Mr Paul Hasluck, stated
his objective very clearly in February, 1963: Secondary
industries are required “to provide greater employment
opportunities; to bring about greater self-sufficiency through
local production; to promote wider use of local resources to
provide higher income per capita; and to accelerate the
technical advancement of the people.
A graph on this page illustrates the existing trade pattern.
Exports almost entirely comprise copra, coconut oil, cocoa,
coffee, timber and rubber the outcome of traditional
private investment in plantation industries. Principal customers
are Australia, UK, USA, West Germany, Japan and
Holland.
The great bulk of manufactured requirements are of neces-

sity imported and the abovementioned countries are joined
as suppliers by Indonesia and Hong Kong. Locally estab-
lished industries embrace copra crushing, plywood and veneer,
brewing, tobacco, printing, baking, paint, bricks, furniture and
joinery, pipe and concrete building material.
For the Territory’s mature political and economic advance-
ment the reign of the historical island traders must be supple-
mented with indigenous industry brought to a higher pitch
of skill and viability by overseas finance. ANGC makes a
meritorious start. ,
The Match Makers and
Decimalisation
"11/latches are one of the very few commodities whose price
has not risen since the last war. They are still selling at
2d. a box over the counter. In fact, when supermarkets run
them as a “special” they go for between Is. 3d. and Is. sd.
a dozen boxes. Of course, it must be remembered that each
box today contains fewer
matches than it did just after
the war.
But although the retail price
has not moved, the wholesale
price has. (Last time was in
1959.) This means that the
retailers have been suffering
from narrower margins. But
the shoe will be on the other
foot once decimal currency is
introduced only the retail
match sellers will benefit.
A spokesman for Bryant k
May, UK-owned, told The
Bulletin last week that his
company would not benefit from
decimalisation because its
matches were wholesaled at so
much a gross, not so much a
packet, so the extra profit would
be just about nil.
But this should not worry
the firm, judging by its 1963
results. Profit rose from £159,302 to £194,417 to equal |
13.5 p.c. on capital. Although the major part of the com- ■
pany's revenue came from matches, a printing works (which
makes the matchbox labels) and a moulded plastics subsidiary ,
helped things along. i
The most interesting development in the match making
industry at present is an attempt being made by Bryant & May
to supply its own wood from a plantation it is establishing
at Cobram (Vic.). To date supplies have come from the
poplar forests of Sweden.
The company’s spokesman said the success of this project
would not reduce raw material costs to any marked degree,
but it would make for a more stable supply and help the
company to be virtually self-sufficient. More important to
Australians will be the extra jobs created and the reduction m
the import bill.
About 150 of the 700 acres have been used so far in the
three plantings made since 1960 one planting is proposed
every year. The first crop is expected in 15 years when the
first trees will be approximately 20 inches in diameter.
The big advantage that the poplar has over the pine is
that the latter takes 30 years to reach the same diameter
Moreover, the poplar has a straighter grain so that t e
matches are less inclined to break. Moreover, they burn
better as the wood absorbs paraffin wax (in which all mate e
are dipped) much more easily than pinewood.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
In Search of a Wages Policy
Economists and lawyers need to co-operate
V Sydney last week, while the em-
ployers’ counsel, Mr James Robin-
n, was in the mid-stream of trying to
invince the Arbitration Commission of
e merits of the employers’ total wage
mcept, in Melbourne at the Econo-
ic Society’s weekend discussions on
comes policy confusion was being
led on confusion in the wage fixing
;id by a discussion which ranged
idely into the economic effects, of
age movements and the procedures of
e Commission.
This is not to derate the contribu-
)ns to the general thinking on incomes
>licy made by various speakers,
,)tably Professors Cochrane and Isaac,
the Economic Society symposium, but
ily to say that at times they were
ther advanced from the hot questions
>w being adjudicated by the Arbitra-
>n Commission.
For instance, nobody would expect
e Commission to adopt, at this
ncture, Cochrane’s idea that there
ould be productivity adjustments to
e basic wage at half-yearly intervals
hen the most the Commission is being
ked to do is, from the employers’
le> to make yearly adjustments on the
sis of productivity and capacity to
y, and, from the unions’ side, to in-
Jde periodical adjustments for price
ovements within that formula. (Mr
• G. Evans, of the ACTU, rubbed the
ices point home in his paper “Wages
•The Trade Union Point of View”.)
This is not to say that, like the
nployers in the current total wage
sc, which seeks to have the basic
a B e and margins clauses deleted from
e Metal Trades Award, the basic wage
°uld be dropped from the industrial
ctionary. For Cochrane believes that
basic wage adjusted half-yearly for
oductivity should be the primary target
a wages policy.
) N other hand, it did not attempt
to reconcile this advocacy with the
'uierous objections to maintaining the
‘-hotomy of basic wage and margins
't up by Mr Robinson in the total
application last week. One has
11 to get round Mr Robinson’s key ob-
■ 10n that basic wage awards give rise
a legacy for increases in margins,
1 that margins awards simply distri-
le productivity increases which have
already been distributed through in-
creases in the basic wage, leave in-
creases, working hours reductions, long-
term service leave and so on. But by
implication at any rate, since he did not
argue about accommodating price in-
creases, Cochrane evidently thinks these
would be looked after through produc-
tivity adjustments; that is in line with
the employers’ views.
Also, most of what Cochrane had to
say against automatic adjustments of
margins is worthy of deeper considera-
tion. That is, that margins for skill
should be used to attract the right
worker into the right job. The trouble
at present is that margins are used as
a general lever for wages and, irrespec-
tive of general productivity trends, bar-
gaining for skilled workers in short
supply goes on in the stratosphere of
over-award payments.
Cochrane thinks the Commission
should devote a lot more of its time to
the margins question “In a rapidly
developing technical world, workers with
skills, some of them new, are required
in differing proportions each year; a
constant investigation of the shortages
and the most appropriate means of alle-
viating them should be made; such a
policy combined with an automatically
adjusted basic wage would seem to be
economically and socially preferable to
an examination of the total or single
wage industry by industry or union by
union.”
Moreover, he was in favor of a mea-
sure of wages restraint on general
economic grounds. This was also an over-
riding argument of the Commonwealth
and the employers alike in the recent
basic wage case. As he said, “The
need for a wages policy became appa-
rent once it was appreciated that, so
long as monetary and fiscal policies
were employed in holding the economy
close to full employment, they were
powerless to control the course of infla-
tion arising from the independent tend-
ency of wages to increase at a faster
rate than average productivity. For,
if wages increase at a faster rate than
average productivity, then unless pro-
fit margins are reduced part of the
Increase in wages will be passed on in
higher prices.”
Furthermore, Cochrane pointed to the
inexorable upward movement of wages,
irrespective of the state of productivity
in any particular industry, especially in
this community where everybody is
keeping their eye on everyone else and
using all other wage increases to justify
increases for themselves. In such cir-
cumstances, he said, it became quite
impossible for productivity to rise by
enough to absorb all the wage increases
and to pay for expenditure on frills.
Professor Isaac put his finger on
several weaknesses in the present wage
fixing machinery, including the fact
that over-award payments were out of
its reach, but though the system was so
deeply rooted in the industrial scene,
any displacement or drastic change in
its basic framework might be ruled out
as being entirely unrealistic. In a word,
he wanted more direct Government par-
ticipation, the co-operation of all eco-
nomic policy - fixing bodies, and the
acceptance of the fundamental proposi-
tion that the Commission's delibera-
tions did not constitute a judicial pro-
cess. This was getting rather far away
from issues facing the Commission at
the moment.
Tn fact, the President of the Arbitra-
A tion Commission, Sir Richard Kirby,
who opened the symposium, fore-
armed with a reading of the various
papers, appeared somewhat disillusioned
by the failure of the speakers to focus
more attention on the hard and fast
tasks set the Commission and appealed
for more co-operation between econo-
mists and lawyers in their work relating
to the Commission.
“We have managed to tread together
in a somewhat confused and stumbling
way along a common path,” Sir Richard
said, “and the fact that this path has
existed and grown and been used by
economists and lawyers in the industrial
relations field is all to the good; but I
think it is time for both economists
and lawyers to consider whether they
should not, by joint effort, transform
the path into something like a paved
roadway.”
In the light of union strike threats
ahead of the awaited decisions on the
basic wage case and the current appli-
cation by the employers for a total
wage, that may seem altogether too
pious a hope, but at least it should be
aspired to. In any case, the matter of
the moment is to see whether the total
wage concept is, in fact, a step forward
towards it and to leave the broader
questions of changing the procedures
and tasks of the Arbitration Commission
to another day. Meanwhile it cannot
be very comforting to Sir Richard that
more industrial trouble is threatened
unless the unions get what they want
from the Commission.


“CROESUS”
The Multi-national Image
Motives behind Unilever’s expansion
TV/lulti-national corporations with big
investments in Australia get their
fair share of criticism under the heading
of exploitation (or something less),
mostly when they have a takeover of an
established business here in mind. It is
only fair, then, that they should occa-
sionally explain themselves as did the
chairman of Unilever Limited at the
world-wide group’s meeting in London
on April 29.
For a start, in spreading its invest-
ment around the world, the mighty Uni-
lever organisation apparently thinks that
Australia and New Zealand may be get-
ting rather too much of its available
capital resources. When a shareholder
asked at the London meeting why these
two countries, which were “expanding
very rapidly, enjoying stable government
and currency”, didn’t figure very promi-
nently in the capital projects outlined in
the report, the chairman explained that
the company had invested a lot of money
in this part of the world.
Indeed, quite recently “further sub-
stantial investment had been authorised”,
and the board was concerned whether it
was possibly getting an “undue” share.
In fact this corroborates something
said on the same lines to me last year
by one of the directors of Unilever
Australia.
Even so, compared with the money
Unilever is putting into expansion in
Europe and the UK, the amount we are
getting is chicken feed. For instance,
in food alone, in which during the last
ten years the group’s employed capital
has increased by £stgl 17 million to
£stglsB million, only 7 p.c. (or
£stgB million) of the increase is attri-
buted to Australia and New Zealand,
compared with 42 p.c. to Europe, 37 p.c.
to Britain and 12 p.c. to North and
South America.
npHE group's chairman didn’t say how
A much of the funds used for expansion
here in the 1954-63 period was found
from ploughed-back profits and from
new money, provided either from outside
local sources or by the parent company.
(About £2i million has been spent on
capital works by the Australian com-
panies in each of the last two years.)
Overseas companies operating in Aus-
tralia usually like to keep such fractions
secret, though Unilever has said before
that over the years it has ploughed back
about 75 p.c. of its profit for expansion
here. In 1962, for instance, it remitted
more than 50 p.c. (£750,000) of net pro-
fit overseas. Last year, when net profit
of £1,401,000 was only £71,000 lower
on the year, it remitted only 18 p.c.
(£250,000).
Presumably the cut in dividend remit-
tances last year had something to do
with the financing of the takeover of
Rosella, but the bulk if not all of the
£4,500,000 cash needed for that was
advanced by the parent in London.
(Advances from associated companies
increased by £4.9 million in 1963.)
The intention is apparently to pay
this back from retained profits, so that
the takeover will ultimately be financed
out of profits on Australian operations
and in the end will not entail a net gain
in capital inflow.
Going on what I have been told by
local Unilever executives on the parent
company’s somewhat cheeseparing atti-
tude towards providing new permanent
capital for the Australian operations, and
also on the remarks of the parent com-
pany’s chairman at the London meeting,
the parent company will be keen to
expedite the repatriation of the advances
made to acquire Rosella, so nobody
should run away with the idea that the
parent company has any special bene-
ficence towards us.
is not to say that the local Unilever
A executives are not striving to further
a genuine Australian image for their
operations, or that Unilever's expansion
here is largely a matter of taking over
existing businesses, but only that the
group is a doubtful quantity as a pro-
vider of overseas capital and that the
prospect for the years immediately ahead
is one of repatriation of dividends and
capital rather than new capital provision
from overseas.
Though Unilever Australia has, as in
the case of its Deb factory at Ballarat,
some new enterprises to its credit, a good
deal of its expansion has come through
takeovers of existing businesses and the
London chairman spent some time in
explaining this aspect of the group’s
policy.
“Between 1959 and 1963,” he said,
“we have bought, or taken a substantial
interest in, ice-cream businesses in the
Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, France,
Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Australia,
Canada, South Africa and the United
States. We have acquired meat busi-
nesses in the Netherlands and Germany;
in Sweden one canning business, and in
the Netherlands another as well as the
de Betuwe jam and fruit juice business.
“Last year the two major acquisitions
in the food field were Althea in Italy
and Rosella in Australia, each with a
specialised knowledge of tomato pro-
ducts, each with a high reputation in its
own country, a good share of the home
market and possibilities of its products
being suitable for other countries.
“Some people seem to think that for
Unilever to acquire existing companies
is in some way less meritorious than
building up its own businesses from
ground level. In Unilever we do both,
and for this there are very good reasons.
“If we are starting something that is
new in a country, there is no choice but
to build our own factories and set up
our own organisation to produce and
market the products. But when it is pos-
sible to acquire an existing business, this
can well be the most economical way
of entering the field.
“T>erhaps those who sometimes feel
critical when they read of our ac-
quiring other companies have a night-
mare vision of gallant little independent
companies being dragged kicking and
screaming into Unilever’s maw. Let me
reassure them. Our acquisitions are
essentially based upon a willing seller as
well as a willing buyer, and more often
than not the overtures are first made by
the existing owners of the business be-
cause they see very clearly the advantages
of becoming a part of Unilever.
“It may be that their business has
reached a stage at which they do
not of themselves command sufficient
capital to carry the costs of development
in an age in which plant, equipment and
research are becoming ever more
expensive.
“It may be a family business, with the
family getting older and coming to re-
cognise that, to ensure the future of their
business, skilled and sophisticated man-
agement techniques are required.
“Again—and this is increasingly the
case in the countries of the EEC —it
may be a business that has hitherto been
operating under the protection of
national tariffs and now, facing the pros-
pect of powerful international competi-
tion, itself seeks a powerful ally.
“In circumstances of this kind, if the
business and its products seem to us to
fit into our pattern, to be within the com-
petence of our own management skills
and to be capable of development, pre*
ferably in other countries as well, then
the setting is right for negotiations likely
to result in a satisfactory outcome to
both sides.”


Lessons to Learn in Asian Trade
Trade ship’s mission reveals need for quick action
By JOHN MOYES, who travelled in Centaur
Perhaps the best thing Australian
A businessmen could do about trade
with Asia would be to forget the phrase
“Trade with Asia”.
An Asian market does exist, of course.
But there is as much difference between
selling in Singapore and Japan as there
is between selling in Britain and the
Congo.
The “Asian market” is a series of
markets. All different. All with differ-
ing degrees of sophistication, differing
tastes, differing standards of living.
The second thing to say about export-
ing to Asian countries is that it is not
a job for enthusiastic amateurs, spurred
on by the Federal Government’s in-
centives, who hope to get rid of goods
over-produced for the domestic market.
The third thing to say is that no
manufacturer should enter the export
market unless he is prepared to guaran-
tee continuity of supply. Sadly, even
Australia’s biggest companies have some-
times failed to deliver the goods. The
result is not only a lost market for them
but a bad name for Australian exporters
generally.
Export is a tough business. Australia
is competing in a buyers’ market against
a field of skilled, determined (and often
subsidised) professionals.
In view of all this, what are Aus-
tralian manufacturers’ prospects of in-
creasing exports, particularly to the
markets of Asia?
In the short term, the answer seems
to be “good”. In the long term the
answer is going to depend very much
on how carefully and constantly Aus-
tralia watches a series of markets which
are changing their character with almost
unbelievable speed.
The short-term potential can perhaps
best be illustrated by the success of
the trade ship Centaur which visited six
Asian ports in a seven - week selling
mission.
Centaur was a £350,000 project,
carried 112 business men and women
and, according to mission leader Sir
Frank Ledger, wrote “immediate busi-
ness worth about £500,000”. That’s a
uice round figure. A cynic might say
its rather too nice and too round. But
if the “immediate” business doesn’t
quite measure up to Sir Frank’s ex-
pectation, there seems to be no doubt
at all that in the next 12 months the
amount of business written as a result
°f Centaur’s trip will be many times
£500,000.
This, of course, depends on intensive
and intelligent follow-up approaches,
frequent on - the - spot assessments of
market changes, and a realisation that
Asia —as stated earlier —is a series of
markets.
Take a simple example—door locks.
Building is booming in Malaysia, in
Thailand, in Hong Kong and in the
Philippines. There are tens of thousands
of doors to be locked —but the one type
of lock won't do for them all.
Singapore is concentrating on low-
cost housing, wants the cheapest locks
it can buy. Thailand is more interested
in price plus quality—something more
aesthetic. Hong Kong wants locks of
varying quality at the cheapest possible
price. And the Philippines (particularly
Manila, where there are more guns and
private police to the square mile than
you’d believe possible) wants to lock its
doors with the expensive, burglar-proof
key-in-knob type.
In short, there’s no such thing as a
lock for the “Asian market”. And locks
are by no means the only items where
tastes and requirements differ greatly
between these countries.
What, then, are the prospects in the
five Asian countries which Centaur
visited?
IN MALAYSIA
The short-term prospects are un-
doubtedly good. Confrontation (which
on official estimates has dampened
trade by only 8.6 p.c.) has had the
effect of speeding unity and progress,
and so the short-term market will really
boom. Inherent in this, though, is the
warning to Australia that the short-term
may be a lot “shorter” than some manu-
facturers realise. More of this later.
Traditionally, Australia has sold to
Malaysia a wide range of foodstuffs. But
in recent years the market has expanded
to include motor vehicles, office
machines, iron and steel products, etc.
Singapore is a free port, and it is
encouraging that Australian manufac-
turers have demonstrated that they can
compete in both price and quality. The
greatest prospect for future success
seems to lie in specialised and unique
goods of reputable brand and com-
petitive pricing.
In the long-term, however, there are
some clouds on the export horizon.
Malaysia’s growing nationalism and its
determination to raise the standard of
living of its people are resulting in a
giant “do-it-ourselves” campaign.
This campaign is two-pronged—estab-
lishment of local industries and threats
to protect them with tariffs. This is
true even in “free-port” Singapore,
though there is some opposition to
tariffs from Chinese merchants who see
their entrepot trade threatened.
Local industries are being set up in
industrial estates, and the Government
is offering many incentives (a 5-year tax
“holiday”, Government and semi-Gov-
ernment buying preference for local
products, etc.) to manufacturers.
Many industries already in production
are joint ventures —and, so far, too few
of them have an Australian content.
Japan is there. So are France, Hong
Kong, Britain and Germany. Malaysia
■ —particularly Singapore—is moving so
fast that Australian manufacturers may
be left behind. Worse than that. They
may be left outside the Malaysian tariff
curtain.
What Centaur sold
Aids to building and construction,
refrigerating and air-conditioning equip-
ent, builders’ hardware, kitchenware,
plumbers’ supplies, metal stampings,
heating units, metal working machinery,
electrical appliances, footwear, leather
goods, waxes, polishes and detergents,
mining equipment, fruit, dairy and food
products.
Best additional prospects: Pumps,
light earth-moving equipment, stock feed,
poultry, medium-priced footwear, TV
receivers, canned fruits.
IN THAILAND
The Thai market is more sophisticated
than the Malaysian, with huge public
and private works programmes which
provide Australia with an outlet for a
wide variety of machinery.
Politically, Australia is well regarded
(SEATO), and economically has direct
links through mining, glass and dairy
products industries established in Thai-
land. But here, too, the country is
developing its own industries. Wide-
awake manufacturers are selling in-
dustrial parts; another manufacturer has
been selling refrigeration parts for local
assembly.
A local Thai concern begins milling
flour next year and this will reduce
Australia’s flour exports. The compen-
sating factor is that the company

foods, zinc, paper.
IN THE PHILIPPINES
This, according to Sir Frank Ledger,
“is probably the best market, in a
relative scale, encountered” by the
Centaur mission. Certainly many
mission members who had expected
nothing in Manila have scampered back
there with order-books poised.
Two factors here are in Australia’s
favor. One is the fact that years of
American influence have produced a
sophisticated market which has made
Australia’s pricing generally competitive.
Add to this the fact that the biggest
exporter (the United States) loses much
of its “favored nation” tariff concession
next year.
The second factor is that Japan
(which is a strong competitor for trade)
has tw'o strikes against it. One is the
bitterness which continues from Japan’s
wartime occupation. The other is the
language barrier which, in a largely
American-speaking community, is to
Australia’s advantage.
In the Philippines, too, there is a
keen demand for joint ventures. Aus-
tralia is already associated in three, and
more are on the way.
If you're an exporter, paste this in
your memo book: About 60 p.c. of the
Philippines’ gross national product is
devoted to a large works programme.
What Centaur sold
Mining machinery, building materials,
builders’ hardware, fruits, canned goods,
specialised machinery, frozen foods.
Best additional prospects: Agricultural
machinery, copper piping and fittings,
leather, specialised building materials.
IN HONG KONG
Here, of course, the Australian ex-
porter is dealing with the toughest
customers in the world. The merchant
or shopkeeper can exist on profit
margins so fine you can barely see them.
And competition comes from every-
where (including the world’s two cheap-
est producers, Hong Kong itself and
mainland China).
There’s an immediate demand for
foodstuffs, and there are prospects for
specialised manufactured goods. But
Hong Kong is a country of traders, and
traders believe that trade is a two-way
street. So there’s some resentment at
the fact that Australia’s import policies
seem to discriminate against Hong
Kong.
Whether this is the cause or not, Aus-
tralia’s exports to Hong Kong have
dropped while the colony’s overall im-
ports have increased.
This trend can be reversed, but only
if Australian exporters realise that price
is paramount in Hong Kong. The in-
ternal market is growing; the entrepot
market is growing, too. But exporters
must shave their prices on the basis that
the merchants here believe in making a
fast buck—or even a fast half-buck.
And, for any exporter, a reasonable
number of half-bucks is better than a lot
of nothing at all!
What Centaur sold
Automotive spare parts and recon-
ditioning equipment, crayfish tails,
abalone.
Best additional prospects: Pumps,
light machinery and parts, steel, special-
ised food lines, women’s fashions.
IN JAPAN
This, of course, is both the most
exciting and most depressing of all the
markets in Asia. Exciting because of
the high standard of living and the
huge volume of Australian exports al-
ready achieved. Depressing because a
glance at Japan’s own production makes
any manufacturer shudder and wonder
how he can compete, not only in Japan,
but in any part of Asia.
Still, Japanese workers are demand-
ing higher wages (and getting them) so
costs of production are rising. And
Australia has already demonstrated that
she can more than compete in unsus-
pected fields. (For instance, two of
Singapore’s TV transmitters were sup-
plied by AWA.)
Potentially, Japan is the greatest
market open to Australia. Apart from
raw materials and minerals, specialised
fields are there for manufactured goods.
But who wants to know' about it? Last
week, sponsors virtually had to beg
people to attend a Japan Trade seminar.
It makes you wonder, doesn’t it?
What Centaur sold
Automotive equipment, milk powder,
casein, butter oils, cheese, scoured wool,
honey.
Best additional prospects: Apples w
quarantine restrictions are relaxed), rum,
minerals, exclusive garments, blankets.

MARKET POINTERS
Competition from Life Offices
Investment of £10.2 m. in shares by
the A.M.P. Society in 1963 empha-
sises once again the steadily growing
appetites of the life offices for equity
investment. The A.M.P. took £B.Bm. of
shares into its portfolio in the previous
year and, on the indicated rate of
growth, is a major force in the invest-
ment market.
Most of its purchases, of course, are
off-the-market placements, preference
share issues as part of loan arrangements,
etc. But such private arrangements help
to relieve the demands for equity funds
normally raised from shareholders and
investors.
When considering the combined
demands of institutions for equity
shares, the annual total is considerable.
Some people argue that if these invest-
ments were offered to shareholders or
made available to the general market,
there would be less shortage of scrip on
the market; hence lower prices. By the
same token, if the life offices competed
openly on the market for all their share
purchases, prices could become distorted
for the more popular issues.
In fact, such a situation already exists
for some of the “selective” investments.
Not only do the institutions provide
an under-pinning for the bond market,
but also for the share market. And those
who complain should realise that these
shares are tucked away for long term
investment, thus helping to stabilise the
open market where the investor buys his
shares.
More active local institutional invest-
ment should be encouraged so that Aus-
tralia s successful companies are not lost
to overseas bidders.

value shares was around 15s. 6d., cum-
jvidend of 3s. 6d. Since becoming ex-

The mine is being placed on a care

sag further.
The long term speculator, keeping the
MKU assets in mind, might do worse
than maintain a watchful eye on the
market to see if he can’t "speck” a few
shares at bargain prices. But he’ll need
patience.

Otrangely enough, overseas bids can
provide handsome capital profits to
local institutions, because they usually
hold sizeable parcels in so many com-
panies.
Ready Mixed Concrete, for example,
has a fair sprinkling of prominent com-
panies on its share register. It was gratify-
ing, therefore, to see that Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. took part in the largest
ever cash offer by Ready Mixed Con-
crete (UK) for a joint holding of at
least 50 p.c. and not more than 70 p.c.
of the 33 million shares in RMC.
It was an ironic switch to see the RMC
(UK) company, sold off at a £sm. profit
last year, coming back and offering to
buy a major slice of its erstwhile parent.
The two Australian directors, Messrs
B. N. Kelman and N. Davis, who went
to England and helped to make a huge
success of the UK company, obviously
agree with CSR that there are big expan-
sion prospects still remaining in Aus-
tralia.
This suggests more takeovers. While
digesting this thought, others in the
ready-mixed concrete business may con-
sider moves which would thoroughly
protect their flanks. Either way, it is
going to make things interesting.
But at 16s. a share, RMC directors
definitely refused to allow the bidders
to get to first base. The requested con-
fidential information could not be forth-
coming at that “maximum conditional”.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Beneficial Joins the Clique
Link with Britain’s second largest financier
As far as the shareholders of Beneficial
Finance are concerned, the greatest
value of the 25 p.c. share interest bought
by the National Commercial Bank of
Scotland will be the increased market
status enjoyed by the scrip. As well as
the substantial operational benefits which
must accrue from such an association,
the company is no longer “just another
financier’’ but a member of the CAGA-
Custom-lAC-etc. clique.
The shares of the clique companies do
not suffer such wide market fluctuations
as those of the less fortunate financing
companies. Their value and solidity are
in investors’ eyes shown by the fact that
a bank has seen fit to buy an interest
in their share capital. For this reason
their shares very rarely drop below par,
even if a dividend has been omitted, and
any news which is adverse to financiers
in general has a less devastating effect on
them than on the other companies in the
field. Many financiers have folded over
the years, but none of them was bank-
backed.
On the other hand, if a good future is
predicted for financiers, those with a
bank behind them usually share in any
increased market optimism at least to
the same extent as the normal ones.
j n eyes of the investor, then, Bene-
fi c i a l has joined the ranks of those finan-
c j ers vv h o will “never go broke”. But
probably just as important is the fact
that this type of thinking creates a situ-
ation where the market never lets the
shares drop below a certain value even
if times are bad.
General Credits is a good example of
this. In 1962 earnings were only equal
to 4.9 p.c. on capital and dividend was
omitted after having been cut from 12F
p.c. to 5 5/6 p.c. the year before. The
ss. shares took the initial shock of this
announcement by dropping to par, but
after a couple of weeks they were soon
wandering about between ss. 9d. and
6s. 6d. because of the optimism held for
their future in the light of the share in-
terest of the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia. The optimism was justified last
year when dividends were resumed at
6 2/3 p.c. and earnings recovered to
equal 7 p.c. on capital.
Of course, all this talk of market
status does not mean that Beneficial was
poorly regarded before. In fact, it was
quite well thought of because of its low
loss-ratio activities (finance for first and
second mortgages and home improve-
ments) and the Small share interests held
by the MLC (5 p.c.) and the SA Far-
mers’ Co-operative (10 p.c.).
The new link should lift profit as well
as status. It will create cheaper borrow-
ing and enable Beneficial to enter the
shorter term borrowing market—its con-
servative outlook has concentrated
mainly on long-term borrowing to date.
Also, it will have access to the know-how
of one of the world’s most successful
finance groups, for the National Com-
mercial Bank of Scotland owns half of
Lloyds and Scottish, Britain’s second
largest financier which has associated
companies in the UK, Africa, France,
Italy, Holland, Switzerland and the West
Indies.
It seems that Beneficial will need all
the help anyway if earnings on capital

stripping supplies. And even though
imports of nylon yarn in 1963 were
considerable, the quantity produced
by Fibremakers at Bayswater (Vic.)
doubled that of 1962.
Sales of nylon tyre-cord in 1963
were of major importance to the group
for the first time.
The year to December was the first
in which Fibremakers (formerly British
Nylon Spinners Aust. Ltd) handled the
sales of “Terylene” polyester fibre in
addition to making and selling nylon
yarn and staple.
Terylene polyester filament yarns and
stable fibres should be in production by
July, if all goes according to schedule.
This terylene plant will cost £ll million
m all. It will result in a large saving
of overseas funds.
Expansion at Bayswater in 1963 cost
£1.4 million. The group was committed
to capital expenditure of £2.2 million
at December 31, 1963.
Fibremakers (NZ) was acquired
during the year. The nylon spinning
factory at Wiri (near Auckland) will
cost over £3 million. It will supply
m °st of NZ's needs from 1965.
The company is now owned 50-50 by
ICI of the UK and ICIANZ. Paid
cnpital is £4 million in 7 p.c. non-
cuniulative preference shares and £4
million in ordinary shares.
A maiden preference dividend was paid
from 1963 profit, and a maiden ordi-
nary dividend of 10 p.c. This took
£680,000 of the £874,690 group profit.
It is only too evident that this is a
capital-intensive industry. Despite the
booming demand, the return on total
capital in 1963 was only 10.9 p.c. Great
sums of money will be needed always
to keep abreast of technological changes.
No Sugar in the Concrete
T He presence of two directors of Ready
Mixed Concrete (UK) Ltd in Syd-
I De y aroused investors’ interest a couple
of days before the astonishing bid, made
jointly with CSR, for from 50 p.c. to
70 p.c. of the capital of Ready Mixed
Concrete Ltd.
The omission of price in the first
approach left investors wondering, but
in the market-place the shares jumped
to 16s. 9d., compared with the pre-
rumor level of about 13s. 3d.
The chairman of RMC Australia
(Mr J. G. Palmer) assured CSR that
he and his fellow-directors would give
serious and prompt consideration of an
official offer including the price.
Rejection speedily followed when a
“maximum conditional” of 16s. a share
w'as actually bid. “A partnership of
undoubted strength” therefore remains
in abeyance. Investors will now watch
CSR particularly.
The position of an ex-subsidiary mak-
ing an offer for its one-time parent must
be unique in the annals of Australian
financial history.
In readiness for the move to Australia,
RMC (UK) announced a two-for-seven
issue at a substantial premium to raise
£stg3.ls million. If the offer was not

Pulling Out of a Nose-dive
T>onsford, Newman and Benson, Mel-
bourne-based warehouseman and
manufacturers’ representative, seems to
have pulled its profit out of the nose-
dive it has been in for about four years.
The company announced a “gratifying
improvement” in the ten months to April
30. This was apparently due to a sub-
stantial sales increase and steady
expenses.
The dive started in 1961 when earn-
ings slipped from 16.6 p.c. to 7.4 p.c.
In 1962 there was a further decline to
2.1 and last year they were nearly non-
existent at 0.7 p.c. Dividends have not
stopped, however, even though they
were uncovered in the last two years—
-10 p.c. in 1960, 5 p.c. in 1961 and 1962
and 4 p.c. last year. This policy has cut
reserves back from £74,000 to £63,000
over the period.
It may not be too optimistic to hope
for a return to the 10 p.c. payout in
the current year as an interim 5 p.c. has
been declared. However, one must be
wary in applying such an argument. The
final payout was completely omitted
last year after a 4 p.c. interim. This
was the case also in 1961 after an in-
terim of 5 p.c.
In 1962 the directors left their deci-
sion until the full accounts were at hand,
and it seems that this practice should
have been adopted every year so as to
avoid the possibility of misleading
people.
Pioneer Sugar’s Great Feat
HHo treble profit from an already very
satisfactory level was the remark-
able feat of Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.
Actual net result was £1,226,101,
showing an astronomical earning rate of
81.7 p.c. on capital.
While most of the increase was due
to stronger prices, output was 8.9 p.c.
higher, too. Tonnage produced rose from
146,000 to 159,000, and in the current
year to December, 1964, production is
expected to be 189,000 tons.
More sugar is being served up to
shareholders they receive 18 p.c. m
respect of 1963, compared with the 16
p.c. of other years. Bonus shares aris-
ing from the one-for-five issue in May,
1963, were entitled to the final 10 p.c.
payment.
While the shares came in for some
enthusiastic bidding on the day after the
announcement, investors did not lose
their heads. They finished for the day at
735. 9d. on the same yield basis (24
p.c.) as CSR shares.

Seasons Favor Younghusband
HThe clients who followed the advice
which most stockbrokers were
handing out a few months ago on in-
vesting in companies directly concerned
with the rural industry have been seeing
benefits for some weeks now. Market
prices have been firming and Dalgety-
NZL has already announced an in-
creased dividend payout.
But probably the best effort so far
is that of Younghusband in the year to
March 31. Profit jumped from £240,000
to £314,000 and dividend has been in-
creased from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. The
result is a record, and the payout repre-
sents a return to the level of 1959-60.
The company is a wool and produce
broker, general merchant and stock and
station agent.
The high prosperity of the rural in-
dustry at present is more fully reflected
in the pre-tax earnings which topped
£500,000 for the first time in the com-
pany’s 75-year history. The industry’s
prosperity is to a large extent based on
the good seasonal conditions as well
as wool prices, etc.
Probably the best way to pre-judge
the performance of a company such as
Younghusband is to keep an eye on
these seasonal conditions if they con-
tinue to be favorable then new records
could be set next year.
APM Borrows £4m.
A nnouncement of higher sales for the
first nine months of the year was
inclined to buoy up the shares of Aus-
tralian Paper Manufacturers, while the
news of the £4 million private note issue
was a depressing factor.
The second is likely to be the more
enduring influence.
The next share issue is, of course,
deferred by the loan. Whether share-
holders (and indirectly or more distant-
ly, noteholders) will be compensated by
some dividend increment is yet to be
seen.
The company has not paid more than
its present dividend rate of 8J p.c. since
1941.
The last call on shareholders (and
noteholders) for capital was the three-
for-ten issue of 7 p.c. convertible notes
in 1959-60.
If the £4 million had been sought
from share and noteholders, the ratio
would have been an awkward one-for-
seven or thereabouts. There is no doubt
it was much simpler to raise it in loan
form while there was plenty of such
funds available.
Price of 355. 3d. (yielding 4.7 p.c.)
looks over-optimistic. Compare this with
the 5.5 p.c. yield available from Asso-
ciated Pulp shares and better earnings
yield, too.
Titanium’s improvement
TI/'estern Titanium NL has let a
** £312,454 contract for the construc-
tion of bulk storage facilities at Bunbury,
which should be completed in nine
months.
This is being financed partly by the
December placement of 440,000 ss.
shares at ss. 6d. with Aberfoyle Hold-
ings Ltd. These shares rank for divi-
dends paid out of 1964-65 profits.
In the year to January 31, 1964, the
company earned a net £101,895, of
which £66,750 was distributed in divi-
dends of 4}d. per ss. share. The profit
compares with £84,120 in 1962-63 and
£37,008 in 1961-62.
Ilmenite is the principal raw material
for titanium white pigment. Western
Titanium is Australia’s largest producer
and most of the output is exported.
Much may hinge on the test parcel of
beneficiated ilmenite shipped to Du Pont
in the US. The up-graded raw material
(with higher titanium pigment content)
may compete with rutile.
It was Du Pont which contracted to
buy rutile from Rutile and Zircon Mines
(Newcastle) Ltd for five years.

Not that there will be any trouble
with under-subscription if the group’s
performance in the last year to June 30
is any indication of the future. In
round figures, the profit leapt from
£37,000 to £55,000 to equal 46 p.c. on
the issued capital, which was £120,000
at the time. Dividend on both classes

Of course, the picture won’t be quite

ed. Paid capital is expected to be in

last year’s profit down to an earning
rate of 25 p.c. In addition, a premium
is to be charged on the ss. shares and
the size of this will go a long way in
determining the prospects of any invest-
ment. Moreover, predicted dividends

Should More CRA Shares be in Local Hands?
A low yield from a great mine investment
By ROGER RANDERSON
/~\rdinary ss. shares in Conzinc Rio-
tinto of Australia Limited have
recently beei, changing hands at about
355. 9d. each, which shows a considerable
advance on the price of 14s. 6d. at
which a special issue for Australians
was made towards the end of 1962.
Few investors have a clear apprecia-
tion of CRA’s relationship to its British
parent company, and it seems desirable
to get this into focus before trying to
assess investment prospects of its shares.
CRA is the 90 p.c.-owned subsidiary
of The Rio Tinto - Zinc Corporation
Limited an enormously powerful
group which from London headquarters
directs the mining and processing of
many minerals on several continents,
including Australia, where about 38 p.c.
of its assets are located through the
CRA investment.
RTZ came into being in 1962 when
The Consolidated Zinc Corporation
Limited, previously well - known and
esteemed by Australian investors, sub-
merged its identity in amalgamation
with The Rio Tinto Company Limited,
which was much better known abroad,
although since 1955 it had been acquir-
ing local interests through an Aus-
tralian subsidiary.
Only the Australian, and New Zealand
mines and other investments of Consoli-
dated Zinc and Rio Tinto were put into
Conzinc RiotintO of Australia, so that
the latter receives no direct benefit from
RTZ’s operations in other parts of the
world.
Australians who held Consolidated
Zinc shares at the time of the amalga-
mation had the opportunity to exchange
20 of their ordinary £1 stg shares for
58 ordinary 10s. stg shares in RTZ, but
they received no right to acquire CRA
shares.
TTowever, members of the public who
held shares in Rio Tinto’s Australian
subsidiary, together with those who
availed themselves of the September 1,
1962, offer of 2,500,000 shares at
14s. 6d., became the local holders of
about 10 p.c. of CRA’s paid-up ordinary
capital of £10,683,028.
An immediate point of investment
interest emerges namely, the tight
holding by its parent of 90 p.c. of
CRA’s issued capital, which leaves only
about 4,273,211 ordinary ss. shares in
the hands of local investors, so that
there is a tendency for shortage of scrip
to force prices up disproportionately
when the company experiences favor-
able development.
Certainly, there have been some
favorable developments recently for
CRA, especially in the restoration of
world prices for base metals to highly
profitable levels.
Investigating accountants, in the pros-
pectus of September, 1962, estimated
that if the CRA group had been in
existence in previous years it would
have shown the following results:
% to
£ Ord. Cap.
1957 2,254,271 (20.9)
1958 1,800,104 (16.6)
1959 2,219,526 (20.6)
1960 2,600,730 (24.1)
1961 2,520,717 (23.4)
Stated profit showed only a slight
improvement in 1962 to £2,596,983,
representing 24.3 p.c. of paid-up ordin-
ary capital.
It jumped, however, by £962,389 to
£3,559,372 in the 12 months ended
December, 1963, to show a return of
33.2 p.c. for ordinary capital.
CRA has increased its dividend. With
a final payment of 5.4 pence on April
30 following the interim of 3.6 pence,
the company paid 15 p.c. (tax free) for
the 1963 year, compared with 12 p.c.
(tax-free) for 1962.
Investors at 355. 9d., however, secure
a dividend yield of almost 2.1 p.c., with
an earnings yield of about 4.6 p.c.
Admittedly, the similar great mining
investments of Mount Isa and Placer
are showing even lower earning yields
on a partial tax-free basis, but either
CRA is too dear or Broken Hill South
is much under-valued when the marked
difference between their earning yields
is considered.
The fact that the entire CRA dividend
is tax-free has been a powerful attrac-
tion for some private persons in the
higher income tax brackets, although it
is almost impossible to make any
general adjustment of the rate to reflect
the great variety of individual circum-
stances.
I, and perhaps many others, would
be glad to be informed whether, and to
what extent, tax-free payments will be
affected now that the Mary Kathleen
uranium project has been placed on a
“care and maintenance” basis, which is
likely to continue for perhaps six years
before private demands for nuclear
power become important enough to per-
mit the operation to be resumed.
It is regrettable that we are still
waiting for the shares of The Rio Tinto-'
waiting for the shares of The Rio Tinto-
Australian stock exchanges. The com-
pany failed in its application for listing
in 1962, because it was not then in a
position to comply with the require-
ment for the issuing of half-yearly
(interim) reports.
Surely such a large and efficient
organisation as RTZ should be able to
organise the regular release of this
additional information. Many great
American companies- go further and
issue reports to their shareholders each
quarter.
Listing of RTZ shares would facilitate
local dealings and afford greater scope
for transfers from London, which would
at least help to offset the present poo:
“spread” of CRA shares.
small move in 1962 towards in-
A creasing local Australian participation
in CRA’s ownership was described as a
“first step”, but time is rolling by with
out further progress in this direction.
Australian stock exchanges canno
indefinitely postpone the problem oi
reconciling the spread of CRA share
with their much stricter requirement
in this respect for listing local com
panies.
A recent price for the RTZ 10s. stj
share was 345. lid. stg, including tfc
right to a final distribution of Is. 3d. st?
less UK tax of 7s. 9d. in the £, which is
payable on July 1.
The British parent has increased it
total dividend from 15 to 171 P-C.
the 1963 year.
Dividend yield (after excluding
accruing final payment) thus appeal
on my rough calculations to be abou!
5.3 p.c. subject to tax, or 3.3 p.c. aft#
deduction of tax, which is much higher
than the tax-free 2.1 p.c. dividend
which CRA is showing.
RTZ’s stated profit is reported to havr
increased from £5,757,000 stg for 19 -
to £6,303,000 stg for 1963. It will
observed that the increase of £546,00
stg was less than the year's increase o
£A962,389 (equivalent to abou 1
£721,792 stg) shown by its CRA sub-
sidiary.
Earnings for ordinary capital
creased from the 1962 rate of about ■■
p.c. (determined after adding _” aC i
£1,440,000 of dividend tax provision j
to stated earnings), but I can only g ueil


the 1963 rate at about 27 p.c. while
awaiting a balance sheet for tax figures.
Without being able to give the exact
figure at present, it seems clear that
RTZ (with a share priced at less than
three and a half times its par value)
would have a higher earnings yield
subject to tax than CRA’s, with its share
priced at almost 7 times its par value.
However, CRA has a much stronger
balance sheet with £42,150,909 of
shareholders’ funds in relation to total
assets of £68,017,319. There is an
assets backing of about 19s. 9d. for
each of its 42,732,112 ordinary ss.
shares.
RTZ’s 1962 balance sheet showed
£75,624,000 of shareholders’ funds in
relation to total assets of £131,725,000.
Assets backing of about 21s. 6d. stg was
shown for each of its 60,178,642 ordin-
ary 10s. stg shares.
When base metal prices were de-
pressed the consideration of £25,000,000
. for Consolidated Zinc’s Australian in-
terests, satisfied by the issuing of 25
million CRA ss. shares at a premium of
15s. each, may have seemed to be very
satisfactory. The balance now seems
to have tilted considerably towards the
Rio Tinto side.
Their Mary Kathleen uranium pro-
ject, after contributing handsome divi-
dends, is ceasing to earn further
revenue, while heavy expenditure to find
workable copper deposits nearby has
proved abortive.
Rio Tinto’s collieries have been
showing losses.
CRA has disposed of the
Fitzpatrick quarrying and road con-
tracting interest, which originally came
from Rio Tinto.
The company, as the chairman, Sir
Maurice Mawby, informed the annual
meeting, is at present “heavily reliant
on the profits from the mining and
smelting of lead, silver and zinc.”
Mounting receipts from the great
Zinc ’ mine at Broken Hill, which is
the world’s largest lead producer, will
be supplemented to the extent of
£304,000 in each of the years 1964 to
3968 inclusive, as New Broken Hill
Consolidated makes reimbursement for
or e lent to it in the early post-war
years.
CRA is receiving increased dividends
from its 32 p.c. holding in New Broken
f3ill Consolidated, which is now the
worlds largest zinc producer, while the
latter is also making large payments
towards sharing exploration costs.
Increased earnings are also coming
from the company’s half interest in the
Broken Hill Associated Smelters, which
Is Ibe world’s largest lead smelter, and
so from Sulphide Corporation Pty
irnited at Cockle Creek, which is three-
quarters owned by CRA, while the re-
maining quarter interest is held by its
associated company, New Broken Hill.
CRA is making large investments as
the result of its half interest in Comalco
alumina and aluminium projects, in-
cluding the mining of bauxite at Weipa
(Queensland), smelting at Bell Bay (Tas-
mania) and fabrication at Yennora
(NSW).
It has only an eight p.c. interest in
Queensland Alumina Limited, which is
expected to have the world’s largest
single stream alumina plant operating at
Gladstone (Queensland) by 1967; this,
too, will require a large capital invest-
ment.
With a 60 p.c. interest in Hamersley
Holdings Pty Limited, CRA may have
to find further large sums of capital in
developing the vast iron ore deposits
of Western Australia.
It has a 53 p.c. interest in Interstate
Oil, which is concerned to a minor
. extent in discoveries of gas and oil by
the Associated Oil Exploration Group
and by Frome-Broken Hill Co. Pty Ltd.
No doubt CRA can expect before
much longer to receive revenue from
many other sources, including its large
Rio Tinto brick project at Campbell-
field (Vic.) and its titanium and zir-
conium project on North Stradbroke
Island (Queensland), besides Rio Tinto
collieries in the Burragorang Valley
and at Lithgow (NSW).
The company has a 231 p.c. interest
in Broken Hill South’s copper project
at Cobar (NSW), which should be pro-
ducing at an annual rate of 350,000
tons of ore a year by July of next year,
and at double this rate by the following
year.
Although Sir Maurice Mawby acknow-
ledged that development plans would, in
the longer term, require much capital
investment, he added that the group was
in a strong liquid position and that
funds needed for. some time to come
would be provided from internal sources
or by borrowings from institutions.
There can be no doubt at all that
CRA is a splendid mining investment,
growing stronger and stronger as it
separates its eggs into many baskets.
But I have three reservations, two
of an investment nature and the third
involving national preference or pre-
judice.
In groping my way through the in-
formation publicly available, I am not
convinced that there are sufficiently
early benefits to justify the shares’
present low dividend and earning yields.
Would it not be a better investment
proposition at present relative prices to
switch from CRA to RTZ shares, if the
latter were freely available in. this
market? Nevertheless, I am open to
conviction on these points.
Finally, Australia’s national interest
seems to favor RTZ taking steps to have
its shares listed on local stock exchanges,
as the shares of Consolidated Zinc once
were, and to “place” some of its large
CRA holdings with the Australian
public.
While there are advantages to be
derived from the association of a power-
ful international group with our mining
enterprises, the situation ' could easily
arise where the disproportionate alloca-
tion of funds to overseas projects could
lead to local projects being retarded.
It must be recognised, however, that
the adoption of these suggestions would
lead to an easing of the market for
CRA shares, besides facing local ex-
changes with larger demands for capital
in the future.
"Nonsense. No sooner is the lake full than someone starts a silly rumor."


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Olympic Compared with Dunlop
How far will joint ventures be taken?
When last writing about Olympic
Consolidated Industries Ltd (over
18 months ago), I drew attention to two
factors. It was pointed out that, ignoring
the 1960 “boom”, the share price over
six years had varied between 8s 9d. and
7s. but had increased to 10s. 7d. during
1962. It was also suggested that the
marketing of motor vehicle tyres would
become increasingly competitive.
The interim report last January seems
to confirm this, since it was stated that
“profits have been at a lower level due
to higher costs of manufacture and dis-
tribution and to increased local and
overseas competition.”
The share price, however, proceeded
to rise from the 10s. 7d. mark to as
high as 14s. 6d. about June, 1963, despite
the suggestion that they were probably
fully priced. They have since declined,
firstly to between 12s. and 13s. to give
a yield of about 4 p.c., and since the
interim announcement have fallen to
between 10s. 6d. and 11s. 6d. to yield
about 41 p.c. ,
All these yields are based on the
assumption that the final dividend will
be 51 p.c. to make a total of 10 p.c.
for the 1963-64 year—the same as in
the two preceding years. The yield would
be 10 p.c. less if the dividend rate should
revert to the 9 p.c. which was paid
steadily from 1954/55 to 1960/61 inclu-
sive.
The shares of Dunlop Rubber Aus-
tralia (with which comparison was made
at the time) have increased rather
dramatically. At around 50s, they are
equivalent to 725. 6d. cum bonus and
rights issue as compared with 425. 3d.
in September, 1962.
the bonus and rights issues
of July, 1963, contributed to the
rise in no small measure, but the an-
nouncement of an interim dividend at
41 p.c. which was in excess of the fore-
cast rate has prompted the market to
anticipate the maintenance of the pre-
issue dividend rate of 10 p.c. There is
some justification for this, as, despite
the bonus issue of one for six in 1959,
the 10 p.c. rate has been maintained
since 1957-58 inclusive.
If we ignore the bonus content of
rights issues (which is rather unfair to
Dunlop), the trend in per share divi-
dends, taking into account the bonus
issues which have been made by Dunlop,
are as follows —
Dividends per share 1954/55 100

(a) assuming 10 p.c. basis in each case.
Clearly, Dunlop has proved a superior
investment and it is perhaps surprising
that, on the price of each 20s. of ordin-
ary capital there is a difference of only
75., or Dunlop is selling only 16 p.c.
higher than Olympic.
If Dunlop’s rate of dividend growth
is maintained for the next ten years, the
shares at current prices would show an
effective yield of about 8 p.c. per annum.
To get a similar yield from Olympic on
the basis of past performance the price
would need to be about 7s 3d.
Better things are obviously expected
than the performance since 1955 and
it will be interesting to examine a few
points.
Tt has been noticeable that Dunlop and
-*• Olympic have been entering into a
few joint ventures. During 1963, Tyre
Makers South Australia Pty Ltd and
Westralian Tyre Makers Pty Ltd were
•formed, the two principals having equal
shares.
Two to three years earlier, they had
come together when Wheels and Rims
Australia Pty Ltd was formed; on this
occasion Ralph McKay Ltd was also
interested. Whether such associations
may lead to closer co-operation generally
can only be guessed at.
While it is not possible to estimate the
size of the investment in either venture,
Wheels and Rims has not yet contributed
any profit and Olympic General Pro-
ducts Pty Ltd traded at a loss in 1962/
63. Once these two ventures are profit
earning, we may see an improvement in
per share earnings.
Perhaps the main factor affecting
Olympic is the growth that is expected
in the vehicle “population” of Australia
in the future. It has been suggested that
the passenger vehicles on register in
1970 will be about 3.4 million, as against
the present population of 2.4 million.
This suggests a rate of increase of about
5 p.c. compound.
The following table shows the production
of “tyres (pneumatic) motor” and the
new registration and total on register of
all vehicles including motor cycles, but
excluding vehicles of the Defence
Forces—
('000) New Total on
Year Tyres Registrations Register
June 1961 4325 290 3002
June 1962 4002 273 3139
June 1963 5014 350 3324
December
1963 5089 379 3437
From these figures it is apparent that
the level of new vehicle registrations has
some marked effect on the level of tyre
production, and, of course, this would
be fairly obvious when it is considered
that each new vehicle requires five new
tyres. But it would seem that every
vehicle on register uses a tyre a year
at least. This ensures an increase in
production regardless of the fluctuations
that take place in new registrations.
*JPhe unknown factor in any appraisal
of future demand is the “scrappage"
rate, which in the years shown has been
4i p.c. and 5 p.c. of the vehicles on
register. Maintenance of this rate would
suggest that demand for tyres should
increase at about 6 p.c. per annum on
average.
Therefore, while a “growth” situation
exists — i.e., the market seems to be
likely to expand at a greater rate than
the economy as a whole — the prob-
lem remains as to the share which can be
maintained by Olympic. But perhaps il
is more important at this juncture for
the company to overcome the problems
in Olympic General Products Pty Ltd
which incurred the loss in 1962/63. It
seems that the venture in flooring cover-
ings, belting and insulation has not so
far proved successful.
Despite all the foregoing, Olympic’s
shares can hardly expect to be given the
market status of Dunlop’s until sonic
indication is given that the dividend will
be increased by lifting the rate, or by
new issues either cash or bonus. As the
company has been redeeming its un-
secured notes a cash issue seems un-
likely, but the relatively high cover of
the dividend payout by earnings means
that a dividend increase or bonus issue
is not impossible.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Plastics Company’s Recovery
But don't expect too much too soon
Stockbrockers breathed a sigh of re-
lief when Moulded Products (Aus-
Ltd reported a sound recovery
for the 12 months to December 31. The
stock was a favorite recommendation
by brokers to investors seeking repre-
sentation in the plastics industry.
After all, Moulded Products was the
largest manufacturer of plastics in the
southern hemisphere in total volume of
production, diversity of products mar-
keted and the scope of its operations.
It had paid dividends of 14 p.c. each
year since 1950, earnings had been con-
sistently high in relation to capital up
to 1960, and reserves had been built
up by premium issues to acquire small
businesses, and a premium issue to
ishareholders in 1960. A bonus was
considered only a matter of time.
Then came removal of import re-
strictions in 1960 and economic restric-
tions which severely hit the building and
motor industries for which Moulded
.largely catered. The high cost of dies
and moulds makes the company ex-
tremely sensitive to fluctuations in the
'sales volume.
i Markets had suddenly shrunk. Fur-
thermore, the cost of raw materials fell
appreciably under the highly competi-
tive situation, and stock values had to
be revised. Profit fell from £406,821
in 1960, to £167,381 in 1961.
The 14 p.c. dividend was maintained
in 1960 by drawing on reserves, but
earnings in 1961 of £297,505 were just
sufficient to cover the dividend commit-
ment.
The latest profit of £385,325 repre-
sents an excellent comeback from a very
difficult position. Pre-tax profit rose by
2L5 p.c. Generous investment allow-
ances and some losses carried forward
Iby subsidiaries minimised tax provision
to £134,855.
I The company extricated itself from
’trouble by materially reducing the num-
-1 ber of lines produced, exploiting those
’ °r which there was a good demand,
uand cutting costs wherever possible. It
operations on divisional

head office is in Melbourne with
. 3 manufacturing unit for compression
I, Ridings. At Frankston, injection and
? ow moulded products are made. The
rj. tone plant is engaged in calender-
| ng ’ ext rusion. styrene foam, tetra-pak
n , su rface finishing operations. The
jL a es , Ptont at Lilydale produces elec-
f c w i re s, cables and flexibles for power
transmission, control and communica-
tions.
Outside Victoria, there is a manufac-
turing plant at Yennora (NSW) for in-
jection-moulded products, and this, too,
is the main distribution centre for NSW.
During 1963 a £500,000 calender was
installed at the Mentone plant, which
gave the company the right to claim
investment allowances.
In 1962 exclusive Australasian rights
were obtained from Rostero SA of
Switzerland to make cast acrylic sheet,
which is used in the building and illumi-
nated sign industries. This was pro-
duced for the first time in 1963 by
Moulded.
Progress in 1963 in the fields of
vinyl coated fabric, cable production
and moulding division, was described by
directors as “substantial”.
Another highlight of 1963 was the
installation of an ICT 1500 computer.
In 1960 a share issue was made at
9s. premium to holders of shares or
7s. 6d. notes in the ratio of one-to-
four. At the same time a second note
issue was made to share and noteholders
in the ratio of one-for-five.
The company’s paid ordinary capital
is now £1,863,100 which will increase
by £496,905 on June 30 this year on the
conversion of 7s. 6d. notes to ss. ordi-
nary shares (adding £248,453 to share
premiums), and by £369,611 on June
30, 1966 on the conversion of 10s. notes
to ss. shares (adding £369,611 to share
premiums).
Shareholders showed their greatest
disappointment with Moulded Products
in 1963, when the 1962 results proved
that the company’s troubles would be
fairly prolonged. Those who held or
bought in when the shares fell to
9s. 5d. in 1963 are gratified by the re-
covery to present prices of around
12s. 3d.
The present yield of 5.7 p.c. is attrac-
tive to those wanting income spiced
with some growth prospects.
Assuming Moulded will have to pay
more or less normal tax rates this year,
substantial improvement in earnings will
be required to hold the 1963 earning
rate of 19.3 p.c. It would be wise,
therefore, for investors not to expect too
much from the company for two or
three years.

WATERS HOLDINGS LTD
Takeover Would Be a Tonic
General picture gloomy for investor
TAeclining liquidity and disappointing
” profit are features of the accounts
of Waters Holdings Ltd, NSW merchant
miller and manufacturer.
The holding company was formed in
July 1951, by the exchange of shares
>? the raho of four for each one m
the old trading company. The first
dividend rate thereafter was 6 p.c.,
which was lifted gradually to 9 p.c. for
the financial years to March, 1958,
1959 and 1960.
Since then the dividends have been
7 p.c. (1961), 2! p.c. (1962) and 5 p.c.
for each of 1963 and 1964. The year
to March 31, 1962, was the most diffi-
cult ever experienced by the company,
, rade tei severely affected b the
credit restr “ ictions
, . , . . .
business was founded in 1900
as Eastern produce merchants, opera-
ting as millers of rice and other grains,
grinders of rice and spices, and import-
ers of foods and seeds. Floor cover-
ings and furnishings were also handled.
In 1949-50 along with other rice-
millers, Waters decentralised in the
Murrumbidgee and Murray Valley areas.
A substantial interest was obtained in
two proprietary millers in those areas.
An investment was also acquired in
Northern Developments Pty Ltd, which
was experimenting in rice growing in
the north of Western Australia and in
the Northern Territory. This invest-
ment is still maintained. Northern
Developments is controlled by Associ-
ated Rural Industries Ltd.
In July, 1957, Waters acquired Mex
Cereal Co. Ltd of Adelaide and
Barossa Valley Milling Co. Ltd of
Tanunda, SA.
The chairman in his 1964 review
said sales of agricultural produce had
achieved satisfactory results, with in-
creased tonnage sold on export mar-
kets. Poor crops on the Darling Downs,
however, made the bird seed business
disappointing.
A continual recovery in world values
of imported lines brought satisfactory
profits for the produce department, and
the floor coverings and furnishing sec-
tion sold and earned higher.
Despite this seemingly cheerful report,
the net profit after tax was £38,928, of
which the 5 p.c. dividend took £35,904.
Over the five years of the accompany-
ing table, working capital has steadily
declined. The last capital issue was a
one-for-six at par in 1956. With the
20s. shares currently selling well below
par at 13s. 6d, (yielding 7.4 p.c.) the
company will have to resort to loan
capital or greater bank accommodation
if the liquidity position deteriorates.
Although the general picture is
gloomy for the investor, the invasion
of American food giants to the Aus-
tralian scene cast a ray of hope that
Waters Holdings Ltd may catch some
marauder's eye. At least that would
be the company's simplest tonic.

But it’s not the one you might think
Tf there’s not one thing happening with
RMC, it’s another! Out of the
blue, certainly as far as the CSR side
is concerned, comes this proposed part-
takeover offer by CSR and RMC (UK).
These days, unless options are in con-
siderable numbers, they are not neces-
sarily a reliable guide to future price
movements. But when call options for
RMC dominated the option column for
a couple of days just prior to the an-
nouncement, then it was obviously more
than just a casual fancy. In fact, it
seems to have developed into a minor
Ducon situation. So, while those option
holders become delirious with their
profits, just let them sober up with the
prospect of another official investigation.
My only interest in a takeover com-
pany is one of last week’s purchases,
Petries. It has now been announced
that the thriving country grocer Perme-
wan Wright is the interested party. I
was so impressed with this development
that I bought another 500 Petries shares
at 9s.
I also felt sorely tempted to increase
my holding in ODE now that the shares
are back to 6s. Looking at the very good
record and the promising interim report,
the fall is difficult to understand.
Rather than use my resources here,
though, I decided it was high time to
make my debut into the fertiliser indus-
try. The £3 bounty introduced in the
last Budget, the increasing emphasis on
property improvement, and the general
prosperity of the rural industry have all
contributed to a 100 p.c. increase in
fertiliser sales throughout Australia.
Furthermore, the demand shows no sign
of abating. A somewhat less, but still
significant, profit increase should result
for most of the companies in the
industry.
The question, of course, is which
fertiliser share to buy. Australian Fer-
tilisers has already doubled in price
from last year’s low of 495. At its
present price of 935. and on last year’s
earning rate of 16.4 p.c. the earnings
yield is a paltry 3.6 p.c.
south in pursuit for fertiliser
shares, I first became aware of Cresco
Fertilisers Ltd. In this case, the share
seemed much more sensibly priced,
.having an earnings yield of 7.2 p.c.,
just double that of Australian Fertilisers.
In traditional South Australian style,
Cresco has quietly carried on since the
beginning of the century, building up
reserves so that they are now twice the
size of the issued capital. Incidentally,
that issued capital has remained un-
changed for the last thirty years.
Earnings have always been conserva-
tively stated. Until 1963, it would ap-
pear as though a substantial deduction
for a plant replacement reserve was made
before profits each year and included
under a general heading of Commission,
Rebates and Sundries Accrued —a cur-
rent liabilities item. Even so, stated
profits still gave a very reasonable cover
to the normal dividend. The year 1963
must have been regarded as a good one
because directors moved the traditional
8 p.c. dividend up to 9 p.c. If it’s 10 p.c.
this year, it will have completed a full
cycle starting from 1929.
Besides its own fertiliser business
covering manufacturing, importing and
distribution, Cresco also has a substan-
tial share interest in Cresco (WA) Ltd,
Other share interests include Nairne
Pyrites Ltd, which operate a pyrites
mine at Nairne, and Sulphuric Acid Ltd,
It’s easy enough to talk about the
company, but very hard to buy the
shares. The first 100 shares were pur-
chased at 695. 6d. and then they took
a jump to 735. 6d. before I could get
the other 100.
An outlay of over £7OO, followed by
the cover of the short in Pioneer Con-
crete (£800), gave the account quite
a jolt. It also gave me a profit of £26.
Pioneer Concrete shares, and subse-
quently the rights, could well fall too
low. This would seem to be the case
with Marcus Clark rights at 9d. and
F. W. Williams rights at Bs. 9d. They
all bear watching.
To provide those much needed funds,
I sold off the Mobile Equipment, half
the Mt Isa holding and Palgrave. With
the interim dividend thrown in, Mobile
Equipment showed a profit of £67. The
loss of £l3 in Mt. Isa was simply the
brokerage each way. Retaining 200 is
my way of showing that I don’t regard
it as a lost cause, whereas Palgrave pro-
bably is.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Selling Goods to Red China
False claims on wheat diversions
Oir Wilfred Kent Hughes (Bulletin
25/4/64) made a point when he
said that the Red Chinese or in his
own terminology the “Chicoms” were
already capable of making first-class
woollens and that, therefore, their de-
sire for technical aid from the Interna-
tional Wool Secretariat must be highly
suspect.
Further evidence of this has arrived
in the form of a brochure published by
the “Australia-China Society”. It seems
fairly obvious that this society is one of
those “Communist fronts”.
Withal it is well written and its “facts”
are well presented. These things usually
are. But the “facts” do not stand a
very close scrutiny.
The main theme of this brochure is
that Australia, as she is now so active
in trading with Red China, should sup-
port her entry to the United Nations.
The brochure naturally enough refers
not to Red China (or the “Chicoms”)
hut to the People's Republic of China.
It says: “In the last few years China
has become something of an indispen-
sable market for Australia’s primary
products, particularly for wheat. Nor
can her purchases of wool be under-
estimated. She is Australia's eighth best
wool customer . .
It is being stressed on all sides that
Australia’s trading future must lie in the
development of her exports to the coun-
tries of Asia. With her 750 million
people, China must surely become the
most important of Australia’s Asian
customers.”
It goes on to suggest that China also
offers great potential as a market for
pur steel, other metals, machinery and,
! n particular, “motor cars and motor
’buses”.
J’he military needs of Red China come
in for discussion and, naturally
'•nough, this brochure derides entirely
any suggestions that any of the goods we
are likely to sell, to China would be
used for that end. Her policy is, we
are told, “bread before guns”.
I In general terms it is difficult to
answer these charges except by simi-
lar generalisations. But when the mat-
ter of wheat exports are discussed the
chink in the armor appears. The bro-
chure states that suggestions that the
Red Chinese have diverted some of the
wheat they have bought from us to
other parts of the world are totally
false. It says: “It is true that one cargo
of wheat was diverted by China to
Cuba, but that was done to relieve the
threat of famine caused by the havoc
of a hurricane which struck the island
late in 1963.”
This is simply not true. It is a
matter of documented record that wheat
sold to Red China has been diverted to
Albania, Cuba, Tunisia, Morocco and
North Korea.
And this is merely wheat diverted, at
this end, at the request of the Chinese
authorities. It does not include any
wheat actually landed on the Chinese
mainland.
Minister for Primary Industry, Mr
Adermann, only recently gave the
exact figures of these diversions of wheat
shipments from Australian ports. Since
the shipments to China began in Janu-
ary, 1961, 61,471 tons had been con-
signed to Albania, 12,232 tons to Cuba,
7453 tons to Tunisia, 3726 tons to
Morocco, and 57,146 tons to North
Korea.
This is a total of about 142,000 tons
diverted. In the same period (1961
onwards) the total shipments to China
amounted to about 5,000,000 tons. The
diversions, therefore, are not over-large.
But they are likewise far more than
“one shipment to Cuba” as stated by
the Australia-China Society brochure.
And they might be far more than
142,000 tons as we do not know the
destination of wheat once it reaches
China.
Critics and friends of the Australian
Labor Party will be intrigued by the
final thrust in this brochure.
It says: “It is now the responsibility
of Mr Calwell and the ALP to urge
upon the Government its own policy of
recognition. The Country Party must
place the interests of Australian primary
industry before those of rabid anti-
Communism. But, above all, Australians
in general must make it clear to the
Government that the true needs of Aus-
tralia must rank higher than those set
up by US foreign policy.”
Tf the Australia-China Society were
more active than it is (its main
activity seems to be dropping things in
letter-boxes) then here’s an angle that
might be used to good effect by our
meat trade representatives in Washing-
ton who are trying to make secure our
access to the US beef market.
They—that is, Mr J. L. Shute and
Sir William Gunn might argue that
if the US does not want our beef, then
Red China will take it. After all, Sir
William has that trip to Peking under
his belt which is more than any of the
US cattlemen would have.
But of greater interest, and import-
ance, is the fact that, according to the
Japan External Trade Organisation,
mainland China has recovered from a
series of bad seasons to such an extent
that Japanese exports of fruit, vegetables
and other foodstuffs have been severely
curtailed this year.
If this be so, and bearing in mind
that fruit and vegetables are more prone
to seasonal set-back than wheat, it fol-
lows that China’s own wheatlands must
have recovered.
At least it would appear that commit-
ting ourselves to large-scale wheat ex-
pansion here (and that is what has been
happening), on the theory that the China
trade will last forever, may be sticking
our necks out.


Problems in Wool Marketing
The city man really IS involved
city man never really believes that
-*• life can be hard for the woolgrow-
er. His idea of a woolgrower is in-
variably a fellow with a big hat, a Harris
tweed jacket, and a Mercedes that he
ought not be permitted to own because
he thrashes it so unmercifully. So he
wonders why it is that so much is being
written about the way in which wool is
sold.
“They are getting big prices . . .
what’s it matter if it’s auctioned or sold
some other way?” is a fairly typical
remark.
There are two reasons why the cam-
paigners for a change from unrestricted
auction are so active just now. The first
is that the Marketing Committee set
up by the Australian Wool Board is to
make its report to the Wool Industry
Conference in July. There is obviously
good reason to make as much noise
as you can if you want marketing
changes.
But the second reason is not quite so
obvious and is at least as important.
It is this: The only time anyone has a
real chance of changing the marketing
system for wool is during a war or when
prices are good.
This campaign to get marketing
changes is not a new thing. It has been
going on, with periodic fluctuations,
since the 19205. As war, fortunately, is
not available at the moment, the matter
of high prices needs to be amplified.
The wool industry is unique in many
respects. One of its most unusual fea-
tures is its separateness from the main-
stream of financial life. This applies
far more to wool than to any other pri-
mary industry.
A woolgrower really has two banks
he can approach. There is the bank
such as any of us use. Then there Is
the second bank —the broker-pastoralist
company.
As thousands of Australian woolgrow-
ers know from experience the
pastoralist-broker organisations have
frequently been prepared to do business
when the established banking institutions
have not. They may provide cash for
the grower in financial trouble. Know-
ing the business, they may accept a risk.
They might stock his property for him
and deduct from the clip the money he
owes on the sheep.
Any number of now well-to-do sheep
farmers got their start by acting, liter-
ally, as caretakers for sheep owned by
one of the big pastoral companies.
When prices are high woolgrowers
have the means to be independent and
clear of all debts to the official and the
unofficial bankers. But when prices are
low, and stay low, that’s a different
story.
It has been estimated that, at various
times of slump in the market, as much
as 70 p.c. of the total clip has been
under lien to the broking institutions.
In this kind of situation the growers
have little to say as it is not their wool.
At the present time, with prices good,
they do have their say.
Just why the pastoralist-brokers are
so adverse to anything other than the
free auction system is not entirely clear.
They would, in a reserve price scheme
within the auction system, for example,
still get their commission. But what
such a change would do and this at
least helps explain the antipathy of bro-
kers to change is to destroy the
broker-buyer relationship which has
been built up over 100 years.
Is a broker’s first duty to his client or
to the buyer? It is a question readily
answered in the case of houses or land
that are being traded. The commission
decides. But it is not so easily answered
in the case of wool. The buyers the
great majority act for overseas inter-
ests. As good practitioners of their
trade they appreciate the benefits of a
lively auction.
While, in general terms, they must
come to Australia for the bulk of their
purchases, they can, in certain cate-
gories, get what they need from South
Africa, or New Zealand, or from stocks
held around the world from the pre-
vious year or years.
The overseas buyers are also able to
employ the “big stick” of synthetics. As
a tactic this is not new. In the past
there was always cotton and rayon. But
under the existing system the buyers are
in a position to do some dictating. The
status of the client must inevitably be
affected by the extent to which he is a
creditor-client.
Both South Africa and New Zealand
have marketing schemes that have eradi-
cated the low-points in prices which
Australian growers fear. It is quite
common, under the present system, for
two growers here to sell almost identi-
cal wool, in quantity and quality, and
for there to be, say, £lOOO difference in
the result just because one was lucky to
strike a good moment during the auc-
tion.
What South Africa and New Zealand
do not have, however, are “wool
barons”, valued clients and rarely cre-
ditors, or pastoralist-brokers acting as
brokers of wool, bankers and owners of
vast flocks of sheep. Not to the same
extent, anyway.
Twice Australian woolgrowers have
had the opportunity to end the free
auction system. After the First World
War they had BAWRA (British-Austra-
lian Wool Realisation Association) and
after the Second World War, JO (Joint
Organisation). Each scheme was design-
ed to dispose of surplus stocks accumu-
lated during the wars. Each did so.
BAWRA has faded into the mists of
time. It was a public company and, to
continue as such, had to get a 75 p.c.
vote of growers to enable it to continue.
It got 74 p.c. and was therefore scrapped
... an odd type of vote.
JO is nearer to the present. The
reason why it was discontinued after
1949 was that 64,000 woolgrowers
voted NO and a mere 16,000 YES.
Remember the period though ... the
attempt to nationalise banking, the re-
jection of Labor’s plans for a socialistic
Australia.
Tn retrospect it is easy to say that JO
A became a confused issue amongst
all the talk of threatened socialism. A
marketing scheme for the disposal of
private goods can hardly be truly
socialistic. But at the time the socialism
brand stuck.
On top of that the really big prices
arrived and that was that. JO had
had it.
Now a good many woolgrowers are
having second thoughts. These thoughts
are presumably amongst the matters
being investigated by the Wool Board’s
Marketing Committee and they will,
presumably, be detailed when the report
is tabled in July.
But if the woolgrowers find that the
average city bloke is little impressed
with their grievances and if he begins
to ask why he should, as a taxpayer,
contribute to the promotion of wool
then the same woolgrowers should not
be altogether surprised. Any marketing
scheme which might utilise millions of
the taxpayers’ money, for example, to
“buy in” wool would be certain to meet
with stiff resistance from a largely un-
sympathetic public.
Just to give unfamiliar readers an
idea of the kind of money involved,
a “buy in” of, say, 20 p.c. of the clip
might need £6O million.
Certainly this “bought in” wool would
have value and might warrant an ad-
vance of, say, £4O million from any
banking institution. But it is still a lot
of money particularly when the pub'
lie at large would prefer schools or
hospitals.

The Furneaux Farms: What Now?
£6 million soldier settlement scheme
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Doldier-settlers on the Tasmanian
Agricultural Bank farms on Flinders
Island are waiting to see what is going
to happen this year. For the first per-
manent leases are soon to be granted,
10 years after the “Ag. Bank” moved
on to the island with giant bulldozers,
ditch-diggers, drainers and earth-movers.
To get a permanent lease, a farmer’s
holding must have reached the produc-
tive capacity of 1250 FEE's Flock
Ewe Equivalents.
Permanent leases were the lodestar of
the settlers. Now, when they are within
reach, do they want them? Some of the
settlers are not so sure. They don’t want
permanent leases because they are doing
very well as it is; a lot of them, in fact,
have never had it so good.
The Bank's soldier settlement project
got into gear in 1954. With Common-
wealth financial assistance it took over
160,000 acres of Crown and private land
on Flinders for War Service Land Settle-
ment.
The aim was to develop poor land
considered to be beyond the scope of
private enterprise, and to put the ex-
soldier into a farm that was ready to
produce. At that time it was probably
the biggest project of its kind in Austra-
lia.
Bulldozers cleared the scrubby, third
and fourth grade land. Draglines and
ditchers dug drains, a first imperative
on the flat, flood-prone soil.
They built 100 miles of roads. Each
block the average is 700 acres
was divided into six paddocks. The
ground was ploughed, fertilised, and
sown down, and houses, shedding, fences,
electricity plant, and water supplies pro-
vided.
The settlers chose their plant and stock.
The Bank paid for it; on 30 years’ terms
for plant and five years for stock, both
at 31 p.c. interest.
Whats the picture now? It looks
good. Everything seems to have done
We N 0n the gravelly soil, sheep and
cattle frequently top the markets, and
the blocks carry a heavy sole of clover
an d grasses.
Most of the 60 farms on the 61,259-
acre Furneaux Estate grossed about
*O,OOO last year. They pay an aver-
se rent of £4OO.
The farms are reckoned to have cost
aa average of £66,000 to get started.
ls includes road-making and all drain-
a § e - The scheme, expected to come to
an end in about three years, will have
aen cost £6 million.
No wonder the “old” islanders call
the settlement the “Gold Coast”. The
island, they growl, could have been
opened up by the locals years ago with
Government assistance to the order of
what outsiders are getting now.
The project taxed the full resources
of the experimental section of the De-
partment of Agriculture and the Agri-
cultural Bank.
The Agricultural Bank seems to have
been a benevolent landlord. There are
stories of farmers casually ringing up
for the services of this or that machine,
or for a mechanic to come and fix
something, of the Bank re-seeding mis-
managed pastures without charge, of
political overtones, of irresponsibility
and lack of desire to come out from
under the Bank’s financial umbrella.
It’s significant that only one settler of
the 60-odd has so far dropped out.
Some have made enough money to buy
additional freehold land. Others have
bought boats and even an adjacent
island or two.
But the complaints have already
begun. The Bank has offered 22 per-
manent leases at an average rental of
£5OO a year, plus an obligation to apply
200 cwt of superphosphate per acre per
year. Despite what they will be getting
for their money, many settlers express
dissatisfaction.
