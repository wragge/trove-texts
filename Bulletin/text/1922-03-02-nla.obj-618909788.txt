The Red Page
Bertram Stevens
I thought to. see him stand beside me here
Where brown earth, made familiarly my
. own,
Was rich with roses—each a friend most
dear—■
Lisping new thoughts with every petal
blown.
I thought to hear him speak of far wise
things
And nearer things less wise, while round
him fell
The long sweet shadow that the evening
brings.
With the trees whispering that all is well.
He could not come last Spring. We set
the day
Back to the droop of summer, looking still
For one good hour, the world pushed far-
away,
When we should laugh with silence on
this hill.
Here would we speak of science, here of
men.
Here of the lilt of well-remembered song;
Under this archway pause to dream the pen
Was a pure reed to pipe the years along.
And here, as evening gathered grey and cool,
Over far bushland tracts our eyes would
range
From the pale blossoming of the young jarool
To the wide .distances that know no
* change.
Ah, friend, we dreamed! And shall we cease
to dream
Because your steps can never wander here,
Can never share this place of shade and
gleam
In any moment of the moving year?
Spring, summer, autumn —all the torrent
mind
Pours down through rainbows to a voice-
less night.
Shall we dream on that you perchance may
find
Wider horizons—stars upon the height?
Your pictured eyes are gazing at me still.
Turn down the page and say your work
is done.
Ah, no! Some paths you made upon the
hill
Shall carry pilgrim feet till set of sun.

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
My Friend
Going on thirty years ago a representative
“push” of us went out to a house in Darling-
hurst —pr was it Paddington? There was
Fred Broomfield, of The Bulletin, with
fierce, pointed, dark moustache and beard,
after the fashion of his beloved D’Artagnan of
“The Three Musketeers”; with him Jim
Philp, of the Chinese Herald, and Victor
Daley, of any place where he could live —we
took him out to Waverley long ago, and,
almost exactly a year later, we took the little
woman who had stuck to him through so
many hard Bohemian years; we took her but
there, too, and buried her with him. There
was myself (who nearly made a funeral last
year), and there were one or two others who
are somewhere in the Shadows. We had
heard that Bert Stevens was very ill, and
that’s why we went to Darlinghurst or
wherever it was. We unlatched the gate;
but the sight of a black glove or something
that muffled the knocker gave us a start that
we c-ouldn’t hide, from each other. You see,
we were not yet hardened to the somewhat
solemn recreation of going out to Waverley,
or up to Rookwood, and coming back one
short; and we eyed each other apprehen-
sively, and then gloomily, before one of us
lifted the knocker —as if it might have had
a snake coiled round it. But Bert was
alive and decidedly cheerful about it;
and plainly pleased to see us. He gave
a thin hand to the most hopeless and
irreclaimable of the gang, and the hand gave
a sort of fatherly, brotherly pressure as well
as it could; for Bert was very weak. I
remember—for the other hand was mine.
He was the mainstay of the home then.
And he wore a moustache and an “imperial.”
He told me it had been his ambition, from
boyhood, to wear an imperial when the time
came. It disappeared over twenty years ago
• —as a condition of his marriage, if I remem-
ber rightly. The moustache followed it a
few years back. In those far years he was
a clerk with an old-fashioned firm of solici-
tors, Allen and Allen, who hated two things.
One was a smell of sharp practice ; the other
a canvasser for typewriting machines. You
had to imagine the members of the firm with
a quill pen behind each ear. They were the
sort of employers that would not only assist
the family of a sick employee, but go out and
see him; and you could see traces of the
“heads’ ” training in the clerk’s character.
He was an ardent single-taxer in those
days, and in touch with John Farrell,
and he talked much with Henry George.
Stirred to it by him I studied “Pro-
gress and Poverty” chapter by chapter, and
went with him to a lecture given by Henry
George in the old Exhibition Building. The
place was crowded. Those were the days of
lectures, deadly : earnestness and pathetically
honest and impossible dreamers. I remem-
ber one eager little man, who wanted to ask
his question, persistently calling “Mister
.Targe ! Mister Jarge ! Mister Jarge !” till it
became a wail. Bertram Stevens took on
single-tax with the same amiable earnestness
with which he would have taken on- a friend’s
illness or financial difficulties. His very
“rats” w-ere lovable.
His illness and straitened circumstances
at home forced him, in spite of generous old-
fashioned assistance from the lawyers, to
sacrifice his first library—it seemed a little
thing to us then, but was a tragedy to tlm
owner. A bookseller, then young himself,''
who saw the sick man’s lightened the
sacrifice by buying some of the volumes he
didn’t want and could see no profit in. We
shared a cab to the cemetery on South Head
the other afternoon.
From the first Bent Stevens had a foolish,
boyish longing for the somewhat doubtful
society of “men of letters,” though he could
hardly afford to know them. He was a
Bohemian at heart, but he didn’t look the
part and couldn’t speak the lines very well.
He could relax with the best of us, but he
couldn’t be reckless. The “relaxed” side of
him was just as lovable as the legal, or
logical, or any other side. And there were
moonlight trips to Manly and week-end trips
to CTosford (and one proposed trip to Bulli,
which shall never be taken now) —with
Victor Daley, who lived “all in x a garden
fair,” and Fred Broomfield and his ghostly
pal D’Artagnan, and Nelson Illingworth and
Jim Philp. And it was mostly Bertram
Stevens (and maybe one other), who made
up the shortage in the fares.
He was looking forward to and preparing
for his marriage, in his own characteristic way
—with a touch of the Allen and Allen about
it —when L went to London. When I came
back we found the young couple in a comfort-
able cottage out Double Bay way ; and they
took great interest in the prattle and argu-
ments of my little children —on the last visit
it was all about whether a ship was a “lie” or
a “she,” I think. Then the tragedy of my life
came to a climax, and the curtain was rung
down, and the old Bohemian days in Sydney
died and were buried with Victor Daley out
there in the Waverley Cemetery. Sydney
never had very much use for those old
Bohemian days; but they were very dear to
us. And their memory is even dearer now.
In the midst of all this Stevens left the
law to follow his false star and join the
woefully uneven ranks of literature. I
thought it was (for himself) the most fool-
ish thing he had done in his life, and strongly
advised him to get back again before it was
too late. But I ran against a. most unsus-
pected wall of stubbornness or determination.
Had it been otherwise he might have been
prevented from doing many foolish things
for pur sakes.
I didn’t go the other day to the funeral of
a fellow-writer or a critic or an anthologist.
I went to the funeral of a dear friend whom
I had treated badly in black days of suffering
and bitterness, when he was trying to do
his best to help me, and who was often met
with ingratitude from one or another of us.
He was the last of us that I dreamed would
go. His death surprised and touched me
more nearly than I had thought I could be
surprised and touched in these years. It
nearly brought back the old catch-in-the-throat
and the sudden vision of better and braver
things seen through half-exultant tears. It
was a fine day at South Head, but the sky
seemed strangely overcast —like the gather-
ing of dusk at noon.
You’ll forgive the “sentiment” in this, for
I am very weak; besides, I have grown old,
as the lives of Australian freelance writers
go. But there is great consolation in getting
old when you can remember well—but not
too well. A great deal of the bitterness
drops out of things then, and all the sweet-
ness is left for the gathering.
HENRY LAWSON.
Anatole France Grows Serious
Mr. John Lane deserves well of the Eng-
lish-speaking world for his translations of
the works of Anatole France, to which A
Mummer's Talc has lately been added.
Originally published in 1903 under the
ironical title of “Histoire Comique,” it deals
with the life of a pretty little actress of
the Odeon, Felicie Nanteuil, who, though
false, heartless, immoral, shameless, and ,
everything else that she ought not to be, is yet
rather fascinating. Long before the story
opens she has done everything that a girl
can do, even paying her teacher at the Con-
servatoire with woman’s current coin. She
attempts to desert her latest lover, an actor
named Chevalier, for a handsome young
diplomatist, De Ligny. The new lover takes
her to a lonely house which he rents for
such purposes; the old follows them, and
waits for them to come out. When they
finally emerge, satiated and cloyed with each
other, Chevalier shows himself in an atti-
tude of crucifixion and, mad with jealousy,
shoots himself dead at their feet. Quite
melodramatic, of course. Any cheap writer
might have written it; but he could not have
described the psychological torment that fol-
lows.
The tragedy affects the gay company of
the Odeon as when a stick is poked into an
ants’ nest; and a good deal of the book is
taken up with a description of the stately
funeral given by them to their comrade, with
catafalque and all, ,in the Pantheon no less.
A medical certificate has to be produced
before the Church authorities will allow the
Requiem Mass to be performed over the
suicide —it is necessary to prove that he was
insane, and this is easily done with the help
of Dr. Trublet, an old gentleman who is
obviously Anatole France himself. There is
some magnificent descriptive writing about
the church scene, and the doctor tries to con-
sole the mourners with the gentle pessimism
which is characteristic of modern hedonism.
But Felicie is not so easily comforted. “Doc-
tor,” she asks, “can you guarantee me that
there is nothing after death?” “My child,”
he answers, “there is nothing after death
to frighten you!” He will go no further,
and she tries to comfort herself with her
prayer-book—“by reading things that she does
not understand,” as M. France drily remarks.
This glint of a sly malice is very character-
istic of. M. France’s wit—perhaps of all
French wit.. We like to fancy that we are
too kindhearted to think of these subtle and
ironic things. We are, of course, quite
clever enough !
Above the ill-natured chatter of the
actresses the Dies Irae rumbles in the
mighty, roof “like a storm,” and Felicie
blames' herself for Chevalier’s death; she
believes her life to be accursed. M. France
has described all too vividly the horrible
sight of thef dead men lying in the half-dark
with a red hole blown in the hack of
his head; and the thing haunts the reader
almost as much as it haunts Felicie. She
tries to find refuge in the arms of her new
lovershe works fiercely at her profession
and is rewarded by a part in Molifere to be

streams.
Thereafter men grew feet too large and wise
For little mountain paths of moss and
fern;
The smoke of desert camps across their eyes
Taught them so much they had not sight
to learn
Of gracious shadows and sun-fondled green
And all the gentle promise of new light
Laughing and running where the mountains
lean
The burden of their fears against the night.
But that first morning in a golden cage
Dangled behind the moving caravan,
W here age bore trade of days to moving age
With little profit to the camel, man.
Drv, hot and weary is the pad we tread;
From palm to palm the way is very long—
Listen! The first white morning is not
dead!
We bore it with us and its name is Song.

The Watch Below.
When Death pays off Life’s voyage, may he
find me at sea,
Unbroken skyline round us, days from our
nearest port;
Low barometer rising, fair wind following
free,
A sapphire sky above us, and steep waves
breaking short.
Prop me on deck well forward where I can
see ahead,
The green waves coming over the last
sight for my eyes;
They were my true love always, well to be
with them dead ;
Happy when death with a seventh blots
out the clean-washed skies.
Lay me out on a grating, close to our hook-
er’s side,
Sewed in a canvas hammock, with fire-
bars at my feet;
Don’t stand in weary waiting, tilt it and let
me slide;
All that the skipper says o’er me, let it
be short and sweet.
There where the last wave bubbled bid me
a long farewell;
Off on my longest voyage, what though
the typhoons blow,
Down there I’ll lift untroubled, rocked by
the soundless swell,
And take, through the endless ages my
longest watch below.
Victoria.

Calvary.
Cry out and hide your faces! Bend your
knees!
Now is the ninth hour’s darkness on the
world!
“My God, my God, Thou hast forsaken me!”
Now is the veil rent, and the pillars
hurled
From their strong bases. Mercy’s wings
are furled,
And at the gibbet’s foot despair is serpent-
curled.
Oh, like successive thunder-clouds they pass,
The warfares of the nations: bloody steel
Makes dreadful lightnings; now the quick
tears fall;
Like driven sable mists the armies wheel,
And like strange, scattered bird-cries trum-
pets peal,
And in a thousand churches thousands
praying kneel.
Famine lifts wasted arms above its dead,
Its hollow, burning gaze on the stark sky;
Red plague sweeps seaward; fear shrieks
down the wind ;
From myriad pits of night the shuddering
cry
Of travail or soul-torture wings on high,
Faint, broken-pinioned—pain that, dying,
cannot die.
Innumerous desolations strew the years—
The bruised reed, the lily in the mire,
The fallen sparrow and the wounded deer,
And ships of flame, and cities seared with
fire:
Hearts pierced with seven swords of vain
desire;
Hope weeping with blind eyes above a
stringless lyre.
“My God, my God, Thou hast forsaken me!”
Life is upon the cross of death and fate.
Lo, every forest is a house of fear.
And all the coasts of the sea are desolate;
A grieving wood-dove mourns its hawk-
slain mate;
A black-clad woman lingers at a cottage
gate.
The blood-sweat starts from every pore of
. pain;
The savage scourges and the crown of
thorn—
Have they not known them, broken Son of
Man,
And flower fallen with the sickled corn?
Are not earth’s beauties shredded, strewn
and torn?
And on the hopeless dark breaks red the
hopeless morn.
“Ah. it is finished ! In Thy hands. O God” —
The cry of pain to peace, of depth to
height.
And yet the Sufferer calls upon Himself:
Lo! He is both the darkness and the light,
The victor and the vanquished in the fivht.
The golden Easter morning of the age-long
night.

LABOR AS THE SOLE SOURCE OF
WEALTH.
The tale about labor being the sole source
of wealth, and consequently entitled to the
entire product of the world’s efforts, is being
worked pretty hard just now. The men
who are chiefly responsible are not workers
themselves to any conspicuous extent. But
they apply earnestly for the job of recover-
ing, in behalf of the worker, and on their
own terms, what they say he has lost. When
the allegedly bereaved one goes to law for
his rights, they propose to hold the brief and
take the fees. When he rises in insux-rection
because of his wrongs, they propose to gen-
eral and field-marshal and admiral the move-
ment, with the suitable pay and uniform.
And having secured the worker the full
product (if any) of his industry and thus '
saved him, it seems natural that these
Lenins and Tkotskys should hold office
permanently, as the only authentic savers
in the market, to keep him from being lost
again. Rut, after all, there is a great deal
to be said for the theory that machinery is
40 or 50 per cent, of production, and the
art of managing, organising and knowing
how another 30 or 40 per cent., while
labor, taken by itself, is 20 per cent, at most.
Doubtless an intelligent community, starting
from scratch, with nothing but its labor,
might eke out an aboriginal existence on
the entire product of its toil, and gradually
devise machines and rise to better things.
And there is even some sort of existence in
the entire product of its labor for a com-
munity which isn’t a victim of adversity
but has gone dotty in pursuit of false gods,
and chased away its organisers of industry,
its machinery-makers and its intellectuals
generally. (These people always go when
the rank and file, the mere brawn and the
natural burden-bearers, get the entire out-
nut, there being nothing left for them to
live on.) But it isn’t much of a life when
the two elements which really make up
“capital” are eliminated. The process of
creating ne\y apparatus and a new roof to
keep the rain off it, and of growing a new
generation with the lost managing and in-
venting faculties, is painful and slow. On
the whole, it may be better to stick to the
capital we have than to take breezy chances.
* * * *
The world is full of illustrations which
throw doubt on the proposition that labor
is everything, and nothing else is anything.
An army is one. The 4000 or 400,000 pri-
vates represent labor —skilled labor, unless
the force is a disastrous mob of recruits.
The commander and officers stand for the
organising power—the commander especi-
ally. Everything portable, from Big Bertha
downwards, is machinery. It has been said
that a Portuguese army with the needful
apparatus and a superb leader could seize
England. It has been doubted if a British
army with thoroughly bad leadership could
hold the Isle of Man if the Manx men and
cats objected. In 1838 the Government sent
a fine army from India into Afghanistan.
The new sovereign was friendly, and was
by no means the senile incapable he has
been represented. A large section of the
people were at least mildly friendly. But
the British general was old, unacquainted
with the land, on his last legs, and had
never been anything very special at the best.
No one can say with absolute certainty why
this aged gentleman decided on a retreat
for which there was no urgent necessity.
It has always been a mystery why the
disordered exit was begun in the bitterest
January weather, seeing that the monarch
offered the use of a huge and defensible
fortress in which the whole force, if it was
really so tired that it had to tear itself away,
might dream through the idle hours till
spring. What is certain is that barring
some prisoners who were dug out after-
wards, one white soldier and a very few
browns remained out of 16,000. A few
years later a different sort of man, with no
force worth speaking about, held a solitary
house at Lucknow against an army for
three months. Happenings like these lend
color to the theory that, in any organised
undertaking, the capable head is about 40
per cent, of the show, and the toiling rank
and file are much what he makes them.
The Bulletin once drifted through a
sunny land where the capitalist had been
almost wholly shifted off the landscape.
Financial and trading companies, except a
few branches of foreign concerns, didn’t
exist. Big factories where the wage-slave
was exploited didn’t exist either. The
worker secured nearly all the product of
his labor, for the amount the Government
extorted from him was infinitesimal—-
though it tried hard enough. It was part
of the land of the Unspeakable Turk; and
when the Turk is closely considered the
resemblance between him and any ordinary
member of the N. S. Wales Labor Council
is rather remarkable. He lacks the commer-
cial and financial and manufacturing
qualities. He has no mechanical aptitude
and isn’t known to have devised even a new
nail. He is short of literary gifts. He was
never an organiser, except of war and devices
for the acquisition of other people’s goods.
He is neither builder nor artist. The Turk-
ish order of architecture, and the Turkish
school of painting, and the Turkish phil-
osophy, and the religion the Turks invented
are quite as unknown as anything this
Labor Council ever invented. Like a Labor
Councillor, the Turk is vain, violent, a great
believer in force, intolerant, and convinced
that he is the salt of the earth. His method
of government is, and has always been,
that of Theodore or McGirk. He simply
commanded people to produce wealth
whether they r had it or not. He never helped
them to have any. He could no more set a
new industry going than the N. S. Wales
Labor Council can get its Labor daily or
its co-operative woollen mill at Parramatta
m motion. The Turk’s theory was, and
is, always that of McGirr, the great Labor
landlord, that “the people can stand a lot
more taxation yet.” And as the Unspeak-
able Turk had a longer run than Theodore
or McGirr or the N. S. Wales Labor Coun-
cil, he dried up the wealth of a much richer
land than Australia.
**• * *
People go to the Turkish Empire to look at
ruins, because they naturally associate the
Turk with the non-constructive turn of mind,
just as they do the Red Internationale of
Moscow, and the Labor Council which has
become a branch thereof. Certainly Samaria,
a proud metropolis till the non-productive
people over-ran the land, is a; more remarkable
case of downfall than Darwin or Broken Hill.
But, then, the influence of the non-produc-
tive people lasted longer. There are still
traces of greatness, strength and beauty—
a fragment of city wall erected so strongly
in the palmy days of Omri and Jezebel that
the worst destroyer hasn’t quite obliterated
it; the remains of a market place with pillars
of extravagant marble ; even a broken temple
used by goats. In modern Samaria the soli-
tary two-storey house is, or was, occupied
by the local deputy-oppressor, two sons and
three harems. The oppressor’s house held
about £lO worth of furniture, for he was
working an exhausted claim —though it was
probably once as good as the claim which
the tax-gatherer is beginning to exhaust in
Queensland. Below the palace spread a
vista of what might pass as huge beehives
made of earth or manure. Viewed from the
street these proved to be hollow, though
often doorless and winaowless, with humans
inside—humans who worked long and hard
for ss. a week. It was the result of long
rule by mere tax-collectors who know as
little as Dooley or McTiernan about how
to foster self-supporting industries; anu tue
people who once organised big works and
invented and taught the use of machinery are
lon°- since dead or departed. It is a land
that has been Dooleyed for 400 years.
Australia had a little Samaria of its own
once. It built New Australia-in-Paraguay.
The New Australians left behind them their
share of the public debt, and their share of
the burden of supporting prisoners, lunatics,
orphans, invalids and the oldest inhabitant.
And in a year or two this robust band of
picked nilgrims lost the big common fund
earned by the individual members when they
were wage-slaves, their cattle and their self-
respect, and most of their clothes. Of oratory
they bad abundance: apparently the one
thing they lacked was the capitalist, not
meaning the man with money (they had
enough money themselves ior several such
enterprises), but the organiser, the machine
man, and the person with the gift of com-
mand to prevent the proceedings becoming
like a ballot of wild cats, all seeking the
Labor nomination for Sydney. The experi-
ment went to prove over again—to prove for
the millionth time—that, when the Com-
munistic mass runs the show and secures the
entire product of its toil, the reward tends
to fall to the neighborhood of £7 per annum,
and the diet, as described by a bitter pil-
grim, is apt to be “monkeys and beans.”
THE CHOICE IN N. S. WALES.
Australia, in a political sense, is the Land
bf Lost Content. It is a country infested
with parties which do not represent, and
make no attempt to represent, the average
man. That unfortunate person has been vir-
tually disfranchised since IUIO, when the
Labor party went mad. At the approaching
election in N. !S. Wales he will have to vote,
if he votes at all, for Dooley or Dulles.
In a few constituencies he will have the
alternative of supporting Cocky candidates,
and the Cockies (or Progressives), though
more honest than tiie other mobs, are omy
a small group, with a sectional inspiration
and appeal. Ten days ago at Bathurst
Dooley showed himself to be a mere politi-
cal charlatan, prepared to pull anybody's leg
and make any sacrifice of the State’s future
m order to win the vote that means his own
and his own little political group s present
advantage. At Wollongong a few days later
George Puller, the Opposition leader,
showed himself hardly more in tune witn
the real thoughts and aspirations of the
mass of his countrymen. And if Fuller’s
matter was not inspiring the manner was
even fess so. According to a friendly critic
the speech ’ was “a mere recitation, w ith a
pause at the commas and a sharp breaking
off at the full stops.” It is no fault of
I uller’s that he isn’t fluent, but a man who
has been in public life for 32 years, off and
on, ought to be able to say a few words
about the faith that is in him without refer-
ence to a manuscript. The conclusion liable
to be drawn is that he didn’t know wlmt his
policy was, or whether he had one, until it
was set down for him in black and white.
The programme thus given to the world
is warranted to harm nobody. It has all the
blameless attributes of a retired church-
warden. The most enthusiastic Nationalist
may peruse it without emotion; the most
sensitive Laborite without offence. It is
faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly
null. The dominant idea in Dooley’s mind
is to gam votes by promising all things to
all men. Fuller, on the other hand, is
haunted by a fear of losing votes by being
too specific. The trouble he takes to avoid
making positive statements on subjects
which, boldly handled, might cost his party
some support, is pathetic. Now and then
he summons up courage enough to
declare that “Parliamentary salaries
should be reduced £275 a year,” or
that “the laws should be revised so that
ederal and State electorates might har-
monise, also that the electoral machinery
might be in accord,” but for the most part
he seeks refuge in feeble compromises and
cloudy generalities. Instead 0 f abolishing
J'kc .Leg. Council, for instance, he would
reform” it by “reducing the membership
to numbers fluctuating between 50 and 65 ”
and doing away with life tenure—surely the
most fatuous scheme of reform on record.
He is against motherhood endowment, but
m favor of “pensions being paid to all who
are entitled thereto by reason of their strait-
cl , rc u mst ances.” He dislikes the Board
of Trade, but would retain “the humanitarian
principle of a basic wage, subject to certain
general conditions” ; also, “there will be no
reduction of wages in the Government ser-
vice if the Nationalists come back.” Other
workers there may be who are receiving
more than the industries can afford, but not
the Government servants. Their votes are
highly valued. On the. New State question
he is bold to the point of foolhardiness.
The matter,” he says, “is one for Federal
as well as State action, and I shall be will-
ing to expedite and assist in an early and
adequate consideration of the question.” He
is also as keen as Dooley on “decentralisa-
tion by the construction of new railways
and the opening up of new ports.” Like
Dooley, however, he refrains from going
into particulars about the railways or speci-
fying the ports. For the rest, land is to
be furnished for all who want it. country
life is to be made attractive, there are to
be “developmental works that will provide
employment, direct and indirect, for many
thousands,” and no immigrants will be
brought in unless they are of “the right
kind.” In short, there is a profuse supply
of all the old props. But beyond a few-
inevitable remarks about the rottenness of the
Government’s financial record Fuller pon-
derously avoided the most important subject
of all. If his party has a financial policy
he kept it a close secret at Wollongong.
* * ■* *
It is all lamentably uninspiring, and
were the circumstances normal defeat
would be the inevitable portion of such
a leader with such a programme. As
it is, failing a better alternative to the
direful Dooley, the wooden Nationalist is
quite likely to carry the country. In the
absence of a party representing the real
Australia, such is the pass to which things
have come. Fuller is dull but honest, and
most people prefer dull honesty to plausible
humbug. He is a Tory of the English
school, but Australians are familiar with that
type and know how to handle it. whereas
they don’t understand and are distrustful of
the Tammany types that have come in with
the new Labor party—the ward boss, the
ballot-rigger, and the politician who main-
tains that a city or a country may properly
be looted in the interests of those who put
him in power. Fuller’s strength lies not
in what he is but in what he isn’t. Electors
will vote for him, not because they like him
or his party, but because they fear Dooley
and MuOtrr and their party. He will g«t
the benefit of the feeling that if he can’t do
the country any good he won’t do it any
harm. His greatest dange- will come from
the toughs who vote earl” and often in
Labor selection-ballots, and whose oppor-
timities for mischief will be enormously in-
creased under proportional representation,
with the parties pretty evehly divided; If
he can provide against these impostdrs lie
will probably win the election. For, pend-
ing the arrival of a party that will stand
tor true Australianism, and not English
loryism or American Tammanyism, thou-
sands of democrats would rather vegetate
with r ULLEK than go to the Devil with
Dooley.
A POWER SCHEME FOR AUSTRALIA.
In the economy of the world to-day the
taost marked characteristic is the adhiissiofl
of the necessity for cheap power, it is
everywhere recognised that progress and
development are largely dependent upon a
constant and adequate supply that will be
always available, widely distributed and
easily applied. The ideal would be a power
available in every home, oil every farm and
m every factory, in the country not less
than tne town, and supplied at a price
within the reach of all. Oi all forms, electric
power stands easily first in the possibility
of such achievement, primarily because in
no other form can energy be So readily
stored, so widely distributed and so easily
applied to everyday use. In fact, the use
made of electric power by any country may
be said to determine its standard of comfort
if not of civilisation. Measured by such a rule
Australia occupies a position with the most
lowly civilised races, among whom the use Of
human brawn lias not been superseded
by the exercise of human brain to relieve
drudgery. In Norway there is rdughly Ih.p.
electrically generated to every two people;
in U.B.A. lh,p. to every three persons; in
Canada, of hydro-electric power, 1 to
every five persons, and a great deal
otherwise. Australia’s standing can be
gauged from the N. S. Wales figures, where
there are 80,C00h.p. electrically generated to
about 2,000,000 people, or lli.p. to every 25
of the population. Australia's power needs,
judged from these standards at, say, lh.p.
for every three persons, would be approxi-
mately 1,800,000h.p. N. S. Wales should have
approximately 700,0001i.p., and that ■ this
would be used if available is seen by the fact
that Tasmania is already absorbing over
60,000h.p., or more than one unit to every
four inhabitants.
Consideration of a few of the primary
industries of Australia and the bearing such
development would have on them illustrates
how valuable a .comprehensive power scheme
would be. Take wool, for instance. In 1918
the total value of the clip was roughly
£26,000,000. Of this only £900,000 was
made into cloth in Australia; but even this
meant the employment of 4000 persons am)
the use of SOOOh.p. If the balance was
made into tops 25,000h.p. would have been
required and £5,000,000 added to the value
of the export. If in addition Australia had
gone a little farther and made into cloth
just what it actually reimported for its own
needs, it would have saved over £2,000.000
and used an additional 10,000h.p. If it
exported all its wool made into cloth
40,000h.p. and 106,000 persons would have
employed in the actual industry.
£9,000,000 would have been paid in direct
wages and the value of the wool raised from
26 millions to 65 millions. Similarly with
zinc. Exports of zinc concentrates in 1913-
14 were 476,000 tons, valued at two and a
quarter millions. If these had been electri-
cally purified it would have needed 120,000-
h.p., and the 190,000 tons of metallic zinc
would have been worth just on four millions,
feuch instances • explain why in other lands
the provision and w.de distribution of electric
power on a comprehensive ordered scale is
regarded as of prime national importance—
as much so as a tariff.
Eugland, Sweden, Canada, Germany,
U.S.A. and in Maoriland power organisation
and control are being made national matters.
A power-supply system within reach of all
and capable of satisfying the needs of rural
and industrial communities is felt to be
essential to fully develop the national re-
sources. Its absence causes such an econo-
mic loss to the community that no nation
can afford to neglect the means of securing
it. In these countries it has been demon-
strated that the establishment of a general
power-supply system leads to a substantial
increase in national efficiency, and to
economy in capital, labor and'fuel; it en-
ables employers to develop their business and
increase their output without hampering
themselves by capital sunk in power plant.
Power lines provide a means of utilising
power from sources which are otherwise
wasted or remain undeveloped; by the facili-
ties offered closer settlement is promoted
and new industries rendered possible. The
economy possible is seen in the system estab-
lished by the North-East Coast collieries in
England, where 75 per cent, of the coal
previously used for power purposes has been
saved, representing no less than a million
tons per annum.
That similar savings in capital and main-
tenance would accrue here has been
shown by \\. Cokin. In Newcastle,
for instance, at present there are 25
small power-stations developing about
15,000h.p., with a combined maximum load
of only OOOOh.p. One large power-station of the
latter capacity could supply the whole of the
district. Were the water continuously avail-
able in Tumbarumba Creek, the Snowy River
and the Shoalhaven harnessed and tied in
with a general power scheme in N. S. Wales,
the 40,000h.p. available continuously would
provide 252,000,000 units each year, thus
saving coal to the extent of 250.000 tons.
Of all the States the two smallest. Tas-
mania and Victoria, have alone done some-
thing besides talk. Tasmania is harnessing
its water; Victoria i.s starting its brown-coal
scheme at Morwell. But something more is
required for Australian industries than hap-
hazard and desultory propositions in each
State, with different electrical standards, that
will ultimately lead to worse confusion and
greater loss than the break of rail wav gauge.
The electrical development of the Common-
wealth should be on Australian lines, carried
out on a definite plan. In Eastern Australia
an analysis of physical and geological features
shows the possibility of the establishment
of alternate fuel- and water-power schemes
which could be linked in such a way as to
m-’-r. +v>r> r-r-wtest use of the water available
with the minimum amount of storage, and


yet reduce the use of fuel to a minimum. The
recent advances in transmissibility of electric
power shows Australia’s position in its
eastern part, from Warrnambool in the south
to Cape York in the north, to be ideal for
such a series of alternative fuel and water
propositions, which, if linked up, would enable
a depth of 300 miles from the Pacific along
the whole length of Australia to be reticu-
lated. In the south, the Morwell brown-
coal scheme would .slightly overlap the area
supplied by a nest of southern water-power
schemes at the Snowy, Iviewa, Burrinjuck
and Shoalhaven. This would carry us up to
a fuel-power station situated at the pit-
mouth on the South Coast; then another sta-
tion could be situated similarly on the Hunter
coal seams which would link up with a water-
power proposition at the Clarence Gorge.
This could be joined in the north by power-
stations on the Ipswich coal measures, and
so on up to the falls on the Tully and Bar-
ron rivers, near Cape York.
All this could take place in an area about
500,000 square miles in extent, which has an
abundant rainfall, every variety of climate,
grows almost every known product, has big
mineral deposits and could be made not
merely the industrial magnet of the world,
but one of the most comfortable places to
live. in. To talk of unemployment in Aus-
tralia and of the impossibility of absorbing
immigrants when this work is calling to be
done can only be possible when the vision of
our statesmen is bounded by what can be
seen from the town halls of the capital
cities.
What is wanted is a big Apstrsliari to do
this job. One man, General John Monash,
has already organised the Australian forces
for victory in war. He has the capacity
to organise our power resources for victory
in p'dace.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Victoria Hangs Fire.
The Victorian Railways Committee admits
frankly that all the interest it takes in the
unification of Australia’s mixed railway
gauges amounts to less than nothing. It
makes the usual lamentation about the cost,
which is certainly harrowing enough ; and it
discovers a brand-new plea for doing nothing,
viz., that a uniform gauge is no longer
necessary for defence purposes. But it
doesn’t mention a cause of hesitation
which may be the most important of
all. Supposing the Commonwealth is per-
mitted to start tearing up the Victorian sys-
tem, will it finish the job, or will it faint
by the wayside and flicker out, as it has done
in the matter of the South j to-North line? If
it did, the State would be left with a chaos
of mixed gauges on its hands. Among the
mainland States Victoria has the tidiest and
most uniform system, bar that of N. S. Wales,
and as the latter State’s system isn’t to be
altered it can’t be left in the lurch. There
may be a certain pleasure in meeting an
obliging person who is willing to reconstruct
one’s house, though the pleasure is modified
when, as in this case, he proposes to charge
for the w r ork. But there is always the risk
that he may fail half-way, and leave the
domicile with the roof partly off, and the
water-pipes a tangled heap, like boa-constric-
tors in the front garden. If the huge under-
taking relies on loans (as, of course, it will)
the stoppage will happen the moment the
loans fail. If it relies on taxation (as, of
course, it won’t) the stoppage will eventuate
whenever sufficient people grow tired of pay-
ing the taxes. So far as the other States
are concerned, their interest centres in one
bit of Victoria’s system—its share of the
great trunk line which ties the capitals
together. When that is unified the rest of
the business may be found impracticable. Or
it may slow down so that Victoria may be
living for 40 years in a house that is under
reconstruction, amid a din of plumbers and
plasterers, and practically shut off from ex-
pansion. The example of S. Australia, which
paid out a land-grant of 200,000 acres per
mile as the price of a South-to-North line
and is now treated almost like an impertinent
mendicant when the matter turns up. isn’t
encouraging. All the satisfaction S.A. gets
is the occasional despatch of some flightv sur-
veying party of politicians or trick cyclists
to do another scurry .over the well-trodden
track, and take fire on the road, and report
at length to the waste-paper basket.
Hughes’s reputation as a sticker isn’t en-
couraging, either. A habit of leaping from
one subject to another, and abandoning seri-
ous pursuits to sport with his own tail, makes
the Prime Mystery a difficult individual to
keep to the point. The supreme risk, then,
is that the other parties to the transaction
may weary in the midst of it, and. like the
unstable Athenians of old, scoot after some
new thing. In anv scheme for unification
of gauges that liability will have to be pro-
vided for. Australia suffers enough from
the present chaos; the possibility of making
a worse will have to be guarded against.
Dooley Tells a Flattering Tale.
One of the glittering narratives with which
Dooley, Premier of Sydney, beguiles the
masses rightlv struggling to be free is that
when the politicians regain control of the
N. S. Wales railways, and all the 1947
strikers are re-employed, and the £4 ss.
wage and the 44-hour week are secured “for
all time” by Act of Parliament, freights and
fares will come down with a roar, and the
deficit scurry away like a scared rabbit. It
is implied that the low charges and the
towering surplus (the £4 ss. and the 44
hours have arrived already, and the deficit
grows more cavernous every day) are with-
held from the public by guilty and incanable
Commissioners protected by an obsolete Rail-
way Act, against which combination the
financial genius of the Dooley crowd has
hitherto struggled in vain. At Petersham
last week the familiar narrative was im-
proved upon:—
The Railway Commissioners are all-supreme under
Act of Parliament, and the only way that the Gov-
ernment, the elected representatives’ of the people,
can give effect to its railway policy is by an amend-
ment of that Act. It is the right of the people’s
representatives that they should be in a position
to erive effect to their policy in the railwavs. lust
as in other State enterprises. As a result of being
able to put into effect our policy in other State
enterprises, all those enterprises, with the exception
of the Murrumbidgee area, are paying. So far es
the Murrumbidgee area is concerned, we have rescued
it from the deplorable condition of years’ standing,
and in consequence of our scheme of re-organisatiqn
it will this year show a profit, exclusive of interest
charges.
Such remarks may sound impressive when
uttered by a capable little actor at an elec-
tion meeting, where there is no danger of
hostile reports and balance-sheets hitting
him in the eye. But when Lang, the Trea-
surer, was developing his melancholy
Budget it didn’t occur to him to suggest that
the Commissioners were preventing the Gov-
ernment from making the railways pay.
This is what Lang said: —
A very serious position has been created owing
to the deficiencies exhibited in the Railway Com-
missioners' accounts. I have approached the Com-
missioners and endeavored in every way possible to
see if the position could be met, but all to no
purpose. During the five years 1916-17 to 1920-21,
the aggregate deficiencies on the railways have
amounted to £1,411,000; and will be increased
this year by £1,100,000. The Commissioners ad-
vise me that the principal causes of the increase in
working expenses are: Increases of salaries and wages
due to the declaration of the Board of Trade,
£343,000; increased expenditure consequent on the
reduction of the working week to 44 hours,
£756,000 ; additional cost of maintaining new lines
to be opened during the year and providing for
increased train mileage, £109,000; increased interest
on loan capital, £364,000.
Nearly all these huge charges (the whole
of the basic wage and 44-hour week expen-
diture and part of the increased interest and
the cost of maintaining new lines) were im-
posed on the Commissioners by Dooley and
his friends. Instead, therefore, of the Com-
missioners blocking the Government from
making ends meet it was the other way
about: the Government interfered in one
direction only—-that of making the system
insolvent. Equally grotesque is Dooley’s
claim to have dragged order out of chaos
on the Murrumbidgee area. His Govern-
ment had three months to look into things
on the Murrumbidgee and a full year after
that to put its brilliant reforms into opera-
tion. At the end of that year the auditors
announced that the Dooleys had achieved
a loss, exclusive of interest, of £215.525,
which was £67,210 more than the accumu-
lated deficit for the three years preceding.
The canning factory alone, under Dooley
administration, showed a debit balance of
£145.699, which amounted to £162 per cent,
of the earnings. In a general review of this
gorgeous experiment in State socialism
under Dooley control, the auditors described
the results as “calamitous,” and attributed
them to “the absence of commercial acumen
and effective administration.” It might be
more correct to say that the calamities are
due to the presence of various things, such
as wholesale political corruption: but, at
any rate, the auditors set out the facts, and
the public can draw its own conclusions
from them.
The Grape Industry and the Wine Den.
Being concerned about the future of their
industry, the S. Aus. soldier-settlers who
grow wine grapes recently asked the Minister
of Industry to get some official light thrown
on the allegation that since Prohibition came
to pass in U.S.A. the California growers are
making more money by the production of
non-intoxicants —juices, syrups and the like
—than they ever made out of wine. The
president of the S.A. Alliance is quoted as
saying that “Prohibition in the U.S.A. has
shown that the growers of grapes can use
them to better advantage than they could
before.” But, according to the departmental
report on the 1920 Californian crop (it ap-
pears over the name of R. L. Nougaret,
head of the State Viticultural Service), only
4 per cent, of the output was used for juices
and syrups. Forty per cent, was sold in
California to those who make their own wine
(a practice now legal, though at first for-
bidden), 54 per cent, was shipped to other
States for the same purpose, and the remain-
ing 2 per cent, was dried. In an estimate
of the 1921 crop, issued by the Californian
Grapegrowers’ Exchange, the following quan-
tities are given:—
Exported to other States for sale to
home wine-makers .. .. .. 60 per cent.
Used for the same purpose in California 8 per cent.
Sundry non-beverage wines, including
those used for sacramental purposes
and in medical preparations .. .. 28 per cent.
Grape juice .. .. ..- .. 2 per cent.
Dried .. .. .. .. .. 2 per cent.
Judging by these figures the Volstead Act
hasn’t lessened the consumption of the bever-
age that maketh glad the heart of man.
Only, instead of being vinted by experts, as
formerly, the wine, or what passes for it,
is fabricated under the most primitive con-
ditions by hordes of amateurs, each of whom
is allowed to decoct 200 gallons of more or
less fearsome stuff for his own use. There
may be fanatics or imbeciles who believe
that the “cause of temperance” has been
advanced by the substitution of bad wine for
good, but nobody else will. In Australia,
with its small population and limited de-
mand, if the manufacture of wine for sale
were made illegal the industry in all its
ramifications would perish. It wouldn’t pay
to grow grapes for syrups or juices, or any-
thing of the kind, and the little wine that
might be made in the home wouldn’t provide
a living for 50 growers. But the large num-
ber of Australians engaged in the produc-
tion of grapes and wine have little to fear
from the professional prohibitionist. Their
greatest danger lies in the existence through-
out the Commonwealth of low-class wine-
shops conducted by ruffians and frequented
by demireps and crooks. Too long have they
been indifferent to the evil name given to
their industry—an industry with splendid
possibilities—by the prevalence of these noi-
some dens. The murder of the little girl
Alma Tirtschke by the Melbourne wine-
shop keeper Colin Ross is a warning that
they cannot afford to disregard. Any further
delay in launching a campaign against the
bad characters who batten on the wine trade
will be perilous to all concerned.
Australia’s Costly Inheritance.
“Whitehall” on Some Remnants:—
A modern State Governor is to the political
student what the rudimentary tail is to the anthro-
pologist. He is a survival. Signs of his past uses
still remain; but they are only signs. One of his
old functions was to entertain batches of successful,
undivorced and reasonably sober lawyers, doctors,
graziers, merchants and so on, with their wives and
grown-up offspring, at dinner- and luncheon-parties
throughout the year. At longer intervals he was
required to give balls, for which the whole of that
section known as Society had a prescriptive right to
cards. For some years before the world-war Society
had swollen to such an extent in the bigger States
that it was necessary for him to give two balls
where one had previously sufficed. And even then a
number of perfectly reputable people in the £3OOO-
--year-and-over class, who had written their names
in his book and otherwise fulfilled the conditions
entitling them twice a year or oftener to half-a-
dozen hours’ diversion free of charge, were left to
gnash their teeth in uninvited gloom. Champagne,
or some mixture bearing a colorable likeness to it,
was looked for not only at the dinners but at the
ball-suppers. While this beverage could be imported
for about six sovereigns a case; while food was
cheap; while the papers were still deriving an
immense revenue from their domestic servants
advts., it was possible for the Governor to fling his
periodical sops to the social Cerberus, and yet
remain solvent. But times have changed, and the
present position was poignantly set forth by the ex-
Governor of Tasmania:—-
Regarding the actual details of my financial posi-
tion, I have already said so much that it would be
mere repetition to tell you that the £2750 I re-
ceived as salary was eaten up by cost of gardeners,
housemaids, cooks, footmen, butler, grooms, chauffeur
and valet, to say nothing of salaries of my personal
staff.
Before Federation the status of a N. S. Wales
or Victorian Governor was such as to attract rich
men— Carringtons, Hopetouns, Brasseys, and the
like. It is so no longer. The parties have conse-
quently had to be ruthlessly retrenched in frequency,
in size and in quality. Imported champagne (at
not less than 30s. a bottle) is out of the question.
What the guests lose in that indefinable sense of up-
lift which so often accompanies the consumption of
extravagantly-priced liquors is more than made up,
no doubt, by their diminished liability to alcoholic
poisoning ; but they do not see it that way. Many
of them sneer at the relentlessly-diluted claret cup
which is all their glittering but indigent host can
offer them, remembering the cellars they have been
able to lay down in their own homes as a result of
“doing their bit” for King and Empire throughout
the war. And then there is that immense and grow-
ing residue of prosperous and respectable citizens
who would not fit into Government House even if its
occupant had the money to pay for what they con-
sumed while there. In the eyes of all these people—
and they number many thousands in every State —
his Ex. has become not only a superfluity but a
source of bodily discomfort of spiritual distress, as
the case may be.
Before the war, however little the Governor enter-
tained, however unedifying or unlikable his personal
character happened to be, he was sure of the support
of the Conservatives. His veto stood between the
wind of change and their security. But now, as the
constitutionalist Sidney Low recently wrote:—
The Secretary of State has officially declared that
the Governor in a British dominion is bound to fol-
low the advice of his Ministers in respect of any
question of internal politics. He has no discretion
in the matter. The colony is, in fact, a sort of Re-
public, with the Premier, for the time being, as its
virtual President. The same doctrine was affirmed
by Mr. Harcourt in the House of Commons when
dealing with the relations between Lord Gladstone
and General Botha in the South African Union.
iThat is to say, the Governor is no longer compe-
petent to block legislation or anything else. His
position is no stronger than that of a constitutional
sovereign. The more ignorant section of the popula-
tion do not understand this yet; and where they once
deferred to the Governor as the King’s Anointed
they now tend to abuse him. For example, Mr. Lee,
Nationalist M.L.A., remarked at a Protestant demon-
stration in Sydney on Anniversary Day
There was too much Governor, and the time would
come, if this sort of thing went on [i.e., the follow-
ing of Ministers’ advice by Governors], when we
should have to write to the Home Secretary and ask
him the relationship of the Governor to his people.
To sum up, nine-tenths of the Laborites have not
wanted the State Governor for many years ; ■ and now
the anti-Laborites are apparently turning against him.
Outside the political sphere 95 per cent, of the
population gain nothing from their Governor but the
privilege of paying for him; and now the other
five per cent, who used to get enjoyment from Gov-
ernment House functions find that they are “done”
far better at home or in the houses of their friends.
Yet he hangs on like the caudal remnant which each
of us retains ; the only difference being that the one
inheritance costs nothing, while the other has to be
regularly paid for like a motor-car or any other
continuing luxury.
Railway Servants and Railway Masters.
All the materials are in preparation for a
crisis in Australian railway affairs, and a
row at a meeting of the N.S.W. Amalga-
mated Engineers the other day added some
combustibles to the pile. The position of
a Railway Commissioner is more impossible
than ever before. Family life would be
much the same if the father and mother
had no say as to the size of the family—
if permanent infants of any size, color
and degree of crippledom and imbecility,
and in any number, were wished on them
at odd times, and they were ordered to
bring up the mixed progeny and make a
good job of it. The railway managers,
who really know something, do not control
the making or direction of new lines, it
having been found that politicians can
build more expensively and thus provide
more work for incompetents whose votes
are the main if not the only real considera-
tion. “The way to absorb the unemployed
is to employ them building railways,” is
the bray of a hundred political asses, until
the harassed Commissioner wishes that a
religious revival would set the unemployed
building cathedrals for a change. Nor has
the shadow-boss any more real control over
the running of the line after it has been
built. In most places two tribunals of non-
experts, one State and one Federal, raise
wages or lower them, with no question
about the means of paying them.
When wages are raised it is the busi-
ness of politicians to see that they go up.
When they are lowered because the cost of
living has fallen it is the duty of politicians
to see that they stay up. All that the Com-
missioners can do is to sit on the brakes occa-
sionally. Yet even that is too much, where-
fore the engineers demand that the Commis-
sioners, so far as N. S. Wales is concerned,
shall be sacked and replaced by men more
pleasing to the union. The position would be
more tolerable if the 35,000 railway unionists
suggested, by even a word, that the two mil-
lion other proprietors—those who pay prac-
tically all the railway loss through the
income-tax department—had the slightest
claim to be considered or consulted, or even
that they existed. Two million people don’t
like to be ignored, even by the haughtiest
railway aristocracy, in the fashion of the
old French noblesse ignoring a worm. And
the position is aggravated by the circum-
stance that Labor perpetually clamors for
more lines —rotten, hopeless, unpayable lines
built with absurdly expensive loans—to
“absorb the unemployed,” these being largely
the people whom Labor policy has caused to
grow up mere odd-jobbers and without occu-
pations. In 1919 the N.S.W. Commissioners,
in their report, mentioned 11 new lines or
sections. None of them paid working ex-
penses and interest; three didn’t even pay
working expenses. In 1920 they specified
10 new lines. None paid working costs and
interest; four failed to cover expenses. In
1921 seven new lines appeared. None paid
working costs and loan interest; six didn’t
cover costs. Quite a large part of the
State’s railway system is now a relief work
or charitable aid, run for the benefit of the
staff. And the staff now begins to demand
that it and it alone shall determine the size
of the relief. How long before the public
realises that all this must inevitably lead
to a violent crash!
*
Women and Wives.
A couple of hundred people want to say
something about Louise Dixon’s article (B
9/2/’221 on. “Women and Wives.” They
can’t all do it; but here are a few remarks
fairly typical of the rest: —
“L’Fou”: Louise Dixon laments that when two or
three (women) are gathered together they drag out
the same old topics—mostly not worth while, yet with
some human interest. But when two or three men
are gathered together, what do we hear ? Soul-stirring
conversations? Rather banalities, vague, second-hand
(or forty-second-hand) politics, growls about taxa-
tion (constructive criticism rarely ever), smutty
stories, sport and shop. Man’s shop-talk is no doubt
more varied than woman’s, generally, for he works
in more diverse shops. House and children are still
the nearly-universal woman’s trade. But it’s just
as good a shop as any of his, and yields as fine
food for thought—and conversation.
“Gae”: I wonder is Louise Dixon a man or just
a mere woman. The former, I think. Love never
was and never will be a woman’s whole existence,
and only the conceit of man keeps such twaddle
alive. I admit a woman looks to marriage; but
that is merely for the sake of Mrs. Grundy. Her
maternal instinct induces the marriage; a man is
the necessary evil. She doesn’t marry a man to
keep her; she only need consider her neighbors to see
that the woman in many cases is the real breadwinner.
Look at one’s fellow-travellers in a tram. The
flappers are bright enough; but the sad, worried
faces of the married women! A man mostly chooses
the bright, jolly girl for his wife —and straightway
proceeds to break her heart and spirits. Man may
be the superior animal; but he hasn’t got much to
be proud of so far as his relations with even the
woman he loves is concerned.
“Thorold Waters’’: Four or five years ago we
were told that woman had at last found herself. She
had heroically proved herself the equal in all respects
of man. I profoundly believe that she did so.
Even before the war I did not imagine that any
proof was wanting. But those years of stern endeavor
proved to the women who did the real battling
that their greatest asset was just that woman-
liness which doesn’t harp too much on “the future
of the sex.” Not long since I was a mute listener
to a conversation among (1) a remarkably clever
woman medico who had performed prodigies of work
and even valor in France, (2) the ex-matron of a
great war hospital, (3) the chief organiser of a body
of feminine war workers numbering thousands, and
(4) a woman writer of weighty treatises. They
talked of:—
(1) Hats, there apparently being nothing in the
world’s previous history to equal certain headwear
already seen, but as yet unpurchased.
(2) Babies, two of them in terms of motherly
rapture and the others in spinster envy.
(3) Husbands, and how to manage them, though
they didn’t seem to think they really needed much
managing.
From that atmosphere I drifted off to gossip with
a distinguished General, two successful business men,
a politician and a University don. They damned
the weather; said a lot about somebody named
Kirkwood, who hits little balls with large clubs ;
ragged the politician a little; rapturously recalled
the ices at Groppi’s, in Cairo (at least the warrior
and the don did), and then settled down to a heart-
to-heart talk about lawnmowers and dahlias. Both
parties were probably quite up to their job of married
Companionship, but they didn’t get up on intellectual
stilts about it. In the long run the future of the race
should be quite safe in their hands.
“Hattie Knight”: Louise Dixon asserts (1)
that woman’s emancipation and education have been
of no value to her, and she now “fits no better into
the Scheme of Things than she did before”; (2)
the root of the trouble is woman’s own attitude to-
wards life—she is over-sexed ; (3) yet “with every
generation marriage appears to become less of a suc-
cess” ; (4) wives and mothers are not interested
in anything deeper than domestic and suburban petty
affairs, and in no literature but trashy sex-question
stuff; (5) the average modern wife and mother
desires to avoid having children, but when she does
have them she blindly adores and admires them
with utter lack of discrimination and judgment.
From first to last the plaint is the eternal cry of
Youth in its pretty indignation at existing stupidi-
ties, which exist all the time, and have existed since
the days of Eve, and will no doubt exist until the
Last Day. Yet if the indignant reformer would just
cast her eyes round upon the Scheme of Things she
would realise that her Modern Woman is everywhere
now in the mere business world, and it is but tedious
declamation of the obvious to point out her splendid
successes in any kind of intellectual and artistic
pursuit or hobby or business or pastime, occupation
or livelihood, that civilisation can offer. Women on
the whole have advanced since they have been edu-
cated, and they have adapted themselves to politics,
civic affairs, professions, arts, trades. Concerning
the protest about woman’s parochial, limited out-
look, it is pitiful, it is depressing, it is true. But,
then, there are also scores and scores of big, brave
men doomed to reside in outer suburbs, whose con-
versation stutters round the pests and difficulties
infesting their little garden plots, the breathless con-
test on the local bowling-green, the women who take
the seats in the trams and the routine of office and
shop. It is inevitable. It is the stodge of the
stunted soul aggravated by environment.- But the
suburbs play their part in the Scheme of Things,
and these dull, depressing wives and mothers are
fulfilling useful functions there. The mother of a
young family is bound hand and foot and soul and
brain while that family is of tender years. And, if
she is normally conscientious and devoted, the routine
of the household and baby-care does absorb her,
must absorb her, for the time being. (It would

probably kill the average man if he were called upon
to cope with its tedium.)' But if she has intellect
and has developed her talents or mental inclinations
when young, she will emerge from her dose of early
motherhood substantially improved, and certainly better
poised and enriched in commonsense than her con-
temporary old-maid sister. As for sharing in the
hurly-burly side by side with men, many and many
an intelligent wife and mother longs and yearns for
a fuller life, but the husband and father with whom
she is associated resents and refuses it to her. It is
easy to judge, to ridicule, to scorn the stultified
suburban housewife. But there are wheels within
wheels for that wife and mother to struggle with,
and no emancipation laws can free her from her
humdrum routine. Many of her, the stodgiest and
most baby-obsessed, was an intelligent, bright income-
earner before she was married. She will emerge
again when the babies grow up —if her husband will
allow her. As for the other charge—that of being
over-sexed—-it can only be offered an emphatic con-
tradiction. The modern Australian woman is too
fond of sport, good fun, light and fleeting flirtation,
a jolly good time and many men-comrades to work
overtime with her love affairs. An affaire de coeur
was the only subject for the jeune demoiselle at one
time. But surfing, golf championships and the estab-

A traveller having told how the Yankees
are pouring fruit, grain, etc., into Java
while Australia gets hardly a look in, not-
withstanding that it is next door, the Syd-
ney Telegraph was moved to wail: —
The invasion by Americans of a market compara-
tively so far away is solely due to the push and
organisation of American business, coupled with
the work of the remarkably efficient U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce, whose scouts are out every-
where.
With that, encouragement W. ■ M. -Hughes
will now doubtless appoint 123 more Trade
Commissioners right off, and create a Chair
of Bagmanship at Canberra University as
well. But really the U.S. gets its business
by doing everything that the Telegraph
taught this country not to do. It avoided
foreign borrowing, while Australia wallowed
in it, and became flaccid and luxurious, and
possessed with an insane idea that somehow,
in this “new country,” men can and should
do less work for more pay than in effete old
lands. Then the U.S. person got a tariff
early, and made it his ambition to supply
all his own needs. Rich as he has. become,"
his imports in an ordinary year are, per
head, about one-quarter of heavily-indebted
Australia’s. And the Yank didn’t learn his
bagmanship from his Department of
Commerce. He learned it in the struggle
to sell the wooden ham and the huckleberry
piano of local make to his brother Yank.
Then he taught his Department of Commerce.;

The just-concluded Ross trial in Melbourne
must convince every reasonable citizen of
the necessity of limiting the license of the
press in such matters. Between the murder
and the arrest of Ross two at least of the
Melbourne papers acted in a manner that
was an incitement to public passion, and it
is not an exaggeration to say, with Max-
well, the condemned man’s counsel, that the
accused was already convicted in the minds
of most of the populace before a word had
been heard in his defence. In these circum-
stances it would not be ridiculous to assume
that the jurymen had their minds consciously
or unconsciously prejudiced in advance, and
in. some cases were sensitive to the mob
thirst for blood aroused by the dreadful
nature of the crime. This is not to say that
the jury did not give the case the gravest
deliberation; but it is obvious that any jury-
man standing for acquittal—a not impossible
verdict considering the “disreputable” evi-
dence for the Crown —would have, in the
state of public feeling, shown moral courage,
of a very high order. It was a great strain
on the jurymen, and it is a pity that the
Crown did not help them more in their
natural desire to escape advertisement. The
printing of their full names and addresses
in thick type was little less than an outrage.

“Homfrey Beale” in corroboration :
“Testing for Credit” (B. 16/2/’22) hits the target,
friend of mine, a professional man, was fined ss.
for drunkenness, his first and only offence. Long
afterwards he was chief witness in an assault case.
“You haven’t always appeared in this court as a
prosecuting witness?” sneeringly inquired the defend-
ing solicitor. “No,” replied my friend, who was
badly broken in an unsuccessful duel with a mine
in France; “I was here once for drunkenness, but I
am not the only one, Mr. Briefboy, with a smirched
record.” “You shouldn’t be rude,” interposed the
magistrate, but he said nothing to the lawyer about
the irrelevancy of the question. A Sydney paper
published a garbled account of the incident, and the
reputation of the witness was considerably damaged
amongst his friends and business acquaintances; in
fact, some avenues towards earning a livelihood
were promptly closed against him. Because in an
hour of ill-health, brought on by war-service, he had
once taken too much stimulant he was punished far
more heavily than the ruffian against whom he gave
evidence.
“Hanno”: Some months ago the headmaster
of a well-known Yic. school for boys decided
that his charges should have explained to them
what the pornographic book-dealer describes
as the “mysteries of life,” together with a
properly-worded warning as to the dangers
to which youths are exposed when they go
out into the world. There was a series of
heart-to-hdart talks with the lads, and as
the subject was treated in a careful and
thoughtful manner a considerable amount of
good was done. But among the boys’ parents
were several unable to appreciate the value
of the instruction being given, and a howl
was raised that the master was “putting
evil tho'ughts into the minds of the boys.”
The school trustees held an inquiry, and as
a result the reformer was sternly commanded
to ceas.e his efforts to substitute clean, scien-
tific knowledge for the murk of sexual igno-
rance. It would be hard to find a better
instance of that ultra-wowserism which, in
one way and another, has been responsible
for so> much suffering and misery, and which

BREEZY LAND SETTLEMENT POLITICIAN (inducting new settler ): “Well, here you, are,
my man. You’re on the land, so you’re off our minds. Even if you work twelve
hours a day for seven days a week arid a hob a month, it Won’t discredit our
basic wage and 44-hour policy one little bit. Wish we could get rid of more
fellows the same way.”
seems to cling tenaciously to the belief that
unpleasant things are dealt with best by
ignoring their existence altogether. In the
present case the boys for a while had the
advantage of instruction of a kind worth
its weight in gold; now they return to the
old poisonous way of being “enlightened”
by older, lads, and will be initiated into what
should be treated as a scientific subject by
way of its most debased aspects.

Those Home Rulers of the N. S. Wales
Northern Rivers are the mildest crowd of
pirates who ever cut the throat of a pump-
kin in cold blood. Candidates in this Ireland
of the Ma State have been interviewed to
find out if they are Home Rule or Unionist.
The anti-Laborites said they were enthu-
siastic about Home Rule as soon as the
State Legislature at Sydney will grant it;
and the State Legislature doesn’t even take
the trouble to refuse it—it simply ignores
the whole business, and proceeds to tax the
patient insurrectionists to pay for the re-
pair of Botany-road. Labor candidates said
they were in favor of Home Rule for the
North, and the breaking up of the big States
for closer settlement, provided the movement
was an all-Australian one. In other words,
they were willing that Ireland should have
Home Rule so long as Egypt and India got
it previously, or at the same time, but not
otherwise. ‘ When the Dooley Government
climbed into power, largely on the Wrongs-
of-Ireland ticket, it was a great deal more
strenuous about Home Rule than that. But
the Home Rulers of the Northern Rivers
take it all quite as a. matter of course.
“Crow-eater” from Brown Brother’s land:
The flogging trouble in Papua inevitably brings up
the “interfering with white women” cry. I’ve not
heard of any white men getting the cat for dis-
playing too active an- interest in the personal
charms of the colored ladies of those parts ; so the
Papuan boy is pondering why “that fella white man
law he two-face.” But there are some interesting
points about this “black man and white woman”
business. South Africa had a run of it a little while
back, and some lady correspondents wrote to the
press urging their sisters to. be more circumspect
in their conversation and attire, and particularly
not to indulge in the habit of displaying frilled
nighties, etc., to the houseboy bringing early tea
into the bedroom. The same advice is good in our
islands. There is the picture influence as well—both
the “movies” and the illustrated papers. I’ve seen
boys poring for hours over a fashion catalogue of
ladies’ underwear —you know the sort of thing I
mean. Again, natives working on the boats down
Townsville way return with glowing stories of their
intimacy with white ladies of the professional class.
These little things have a tendency to degrade the
white woman in the eyes of the native. A par in
an English paper recently mentioned that white-and-
colored marriages were on the increase in London- —five
were registered within a fortnight or so. Of course,
all this hasn’t much bearing on the Prime Minister’s
“explanation” (which I don’t accept in its entirety),
but, all the same, it shows how things are drifting.
And we don’t want any lynch-law horrors out here.
“Pick” in defence of the rifle: —•
“Rio” (B. 16/2/’22), fuming once more against
the rifle-clubs, says that in the war Lewis guns
and Stokes mortars took the place of the rifle, except
in sniping. In stationary fighting they did, but
“Rio” knows that whenever there was an ad-
vance the majority of the top-hoppers carried the
rifle. And, anyhow, if war came to Australia, skir-
mishing in the forests and ravines, where rifles
would be the only serviceable weapon, would bj our
means of offence when once the sea front was lost
—and that would probably be soon “ Rlo >s” oft
repeated gibe that only two-thirds of the riflemen
went to the Front is a half-truth that is the worst
kl "‘ ° a ,’ e ' He f et * hls fl !fires from the regi-
mental numbers allotted to riflemen when attested
In the-earlier years of the war they stood at between
62 000 and 68.000. But of that number «
half of the members had died, resigned or otherwise
left the clubs, and of the remainder almost even
physically fit man enlisted. From them the mipen
that even “Rio” extols were drafted, though in that
draft the authorities did not display the best di
crimination Dave McAuster, the champion rifle
shot and thrice King’s winner, served as a sapper
with the engineers The innuendo that riflemen
generally are elderly gentlemen unfit for active
service is the cap-rail of “Rio’s” absurdity. The
rifle-club regulations do not admit of ancients beiie
sworn-in.

“Hanno”: A few months ago I undertook
to ‘coach’—the present-day euphemism for
“cram”—a student for a medical examina-
tion based on a prescribed text-book. When-
ever I began to explain some interesting and
often essential point he would interrupt with
the remark that it was not likely to form the
basis of an exam, question. By constant
study of previous papers he had acquired a
pretty fair knowledge of what the examiners
were not likely to touch on. He got through
the exam, and is thus, according to the regu
lations, stamped as proficient in that branch
of the medical course—which he isn’t bv
10 miles or so, since he left untouched
about 50 per cent, of the subject. The two
main effects of our University system are to
turn out superficially-educated graduates
and (which is worse) to destroy the whole
value of the Universities as centres of learn-
ing. The world’s stock of knowledge was
built by . men who had -no thoughts of
worldly gain from their labors; but Aus-
traha is doing its best to exterminate this
spirit. Men whose only aim is to acquire
just enough knowledge to conceal their
ignorance from their examiners are not
.90111 g to give many fresh truths and thoughts
to humanity. And when our Universities
start to encourage them, then they cease to
be Universities, and instead become mere
technical colleges, and slipshod technical
colleges at that.
A military man on the pay of brass-hats:—
In Defence discussions a. lot of confusion arises
owing to an officer retaining his A.I.F. rank as an
honorary rank while being paid for his lower sub-
stantive grade. The rank which is paid for should be
used; and it would then be found that instead of a
swarm of expensive generals Australia gets hers very
eheaply. There are only four generals in the Com-
monwealth paid as such, viz., Chauvel, White,
Sn.LHEiM and Legge, who are respectively Inspector-
General, Chief of General Staff, Adjutant-General
and Commandant R. M. College. “Onediv” (B.
23/2/’22) says that each member of the Military
Board has a General to assist. They are all paid as
Colonels. The Q.M.G. himself (Forsyth) is only a
substantive colonel. Some of our Generals— Lloyd,
Phillips and Jess, for example—are only Lieut.-
Colonels for pay. So Australia gets the services of
brilliant A.I.F. Generals at the price of two grades
lower. Divisional commanders in England get
£2275, in Australia £800; and the Blighty billet,
being with regulars, is much the easier and more
attractive. There can be no doubt as to the out-
standing ability of Chauvel and Brudenell
White.. In England their salary would be either
£3308 or £4288 plus table money, soldier servants,
horses and, forage. They would enjoy a high social
prestige with many perquisites, and each would be
sure of some lucrative sinecure on retirement, in
addition to his retired pay, which would be £l2OO
a year—the sum they receive here when fully em-
ployed and with no pension prospects. Yet our
imported Admiral, whose duties are not so important
comparatively, the Navy being such a small concern,
gets £3OOO.

Professor Atkinson, of Melbourne, says
the Russian famine, which he has been in-
vestigating, is largely an artificial affair,
caused by the blundering Soviet’s seizure of
the farmers’ grain reserves. It was a story
in four chapters :
The Government “took over the entire control of
production, distribution and exchange.” Anybody
who sold a loaf to another except through the proper
Soviet official was technically hanged, and really
hanged if possible.
When the money the Soviet paid with became
Valueless the farmers stopped selling, and to some
extent left off growing, so that the surplus became
small and the margin against famine grew thin.
Then the Government, learning the rudiments of
political economy as it Staggered along, and having
its army, officials and town population to feed, took
what surplus there was, and paid for it with Bol-
shevik paper.
But the crop failure came along just then, and
the Bolshevik notes will buy nothing outside Russia
and next to nothing inside.
“It is easy to govern a country if one is
honest,” the late John Storey used to say.
Yet the Russian experience suggests that
one honest fool can do more damage in an
hour than a stampede of wild elephants can
in a month.

POLITICAL
POINTS
At Newtown the other day Dooley threw
himself into a serpentine attitude of horror,
and told about a secret meeting of employers
in Brisbane. Its purpose was to pay less
wages, or get more work done for the same
wages, and to raise election funds —but not
by blackmailing employees into the purchase
ol “bon,ds” bearing no interest and repay-
able no-time, which was the method prac-
tised in the Sydney municipal Labor interest.
Dooley supplied no date or place of meeting,
and gave no names, but he seldom does.
Probably the meeting, if it ever existed,
doesn’t mind Dooley’s revelation one bit.
Copper, which nearly reached £l3O per ton
during the war, is about £5B now, and as no
one dan extract as much wage out of £5B as
out of £l3O, everybody except political
Dooleys says wages and other things must
drop or the mines stay closed, Dooley will
also say it after the election, provided he
wins.
Because Victoria can afford to wait until
money becomes cheap, not having burdened
itself with a legion of loan-jobbers, it got
£4,000,000 in London the other day at £5
15s. 4d. per cent., and there was a rush to
buy the stock. Three weeks earlier the
chronically impecunious N. S. Wales Govern-
ment bounded into the market for £7,000,000
and had to pay £6 9s. 7d. per cent. Which
means, taking £4,000,000 as the standard,
that the Victorian interest bill will be nearly
£600,000 less than Ma’s in 20 years. Mc-
Pherson, the Vic. Treasurer, is pluming him-
self on his achievement, but he would be
entitled to ten thousand times more credit if he
did without loans altogether. However, the
incident is a bright commentary on the differ-
ence between moderately sound finance and
the thoroughly drunken variety.
A vast amount of mischievous rubbish is
talked by Labor Council “economists” about
the wickedness of “stock-watering.” With
a little knowledge they see cos. issuing
“bonus shares,” and they immediately as-
sume that the (say) 7 p.c. div. thereafter
paid is paid on “fictitious capital”—-at the
expense of the workers, of course. It is
nothing of the sort. A new manufacturing
co. makes a profit of (say) £5OOO. But as that
profit isn’t in money, but in raw materials
or book debts, the co. pays no dividend.
The next year it gets some cash in hand; but
it sees a chance to extend its works and,
incidentally, employ more labor. So instead
of paying a dividend it puts the profit into
plant. So it may go on for years, leaving
its profits or most of its profits in the busi-
ness 7’resentlv it might reasonably with-
draw its accumulated profits, dividing them
among .shareholders; instead, it issues what
are loosely called bonus shares —in other
words, shareholders are obliged to take
shares instead of cash: it is a forced contri-
bution of capital to extend the business and,
incidentally, employ more labor. But this
capital is no more “fictitious” than the
pay which the bush-worker doesn’t draw
at the time it is earned, but which he allows
to accumulate till his job is finished or he
goes for a fling in town.
A member of the French Cabinet has had
the courage to say what other people rnerely
tbink—that it isn’t likely France will ever
pay a cent of its debt to the United States.
It can’t pay in gold, for acquisitive. Uncle
Sam owns most of the world’s gold already,
and it can’t pay in goods, because Uncle,
with his tariff and his vast output, won’t
take goods. Which is just the. happy hole
that Queensland is hurrying iDto. John
Bull takes out his interest in goods. In
1919 he bought so much from us. and sold
us so little that there was £21,000.000 due
us on the settlement, and it was that money
which paid our interest bills and kept the
country out of a debtor's prison. The U.js>.
reversed the process, as it always does. It
sold Australia £28,000,000 worth of no-
tions,” bought £9,000,000 worth, and took
gold or our fatal lOU for the difference.
When a nation with these habits comes to
collect big interest and sinking fund in cosh,
as well as a staggering soft-and-hard-goods
account in pash, things will happen.
The pauperisation of Queensland, which
Nature made the wealthiest section of Aus-
tralasia, goes on apace.' In 1917-18 £0350
sufficed for public relief; next year £20,412
was enough; in 1919-20 £78,859 was de-
manded ; for 1920-21 the outgoings swelled to
£120,521. The present year will need at
least £200,000 for workhouse purposes, for
outdoor relief has already (in six months)
cost the Government £95,872. A country
that is taxing every man, woman and child,
on the average, at the rate of some ss. 4d.
A VALIANT DEFENDER (PRO TEM.).
DOOLEY: “Touch not a single hough—at least, not until the fruit is picked .”
per annum for relief purposes only is surely
as near an approach to a Pauper State as
Australasia has managed so far. Very soon
every third adult in Queensland will be in
receipt of State doles. The Theodore Minis-
try has no shame about this matter; in fact,
Treasurer Fihelly bragged about this
£200,000 relief expenditure shortly before his
departure as if it were a virtue. Under the
old system in Britain voters were bought
like cattle at election, time. In Queensland
the buying goes on steadily from one election
to the next.
Opening his bruised heart the other day to
a Westralian reporter, Gregory, Cocky
M.H.R. for Dampier, stated that “some little
time after the no-confidence debate” he had
been offered a portfolio. “This I declined —
of course —but I suggested a truce with the
Government” —which also goes without say-
ing—‘and things were looking good for both
truce and portfolio until “a few irrecon-
cilables” got busy and persuaded the
Agrarians to accept, “a policy of drift.
Whereupon “I declined to accept nu-
ther responsibility for the actions of the
party.” Since then the Government has
again expressed its willingness to con-
vert the baffled little man with a billet
—having failed to muzzle Cocky it is
anxious to split him —and, although Gregory
has declined the honor “for the time being,
his manner suggests the lady who, saying she
would ne’er consent, consented. He was a
Nationalist before he turned Cocky, and
didn’t see the light until his seat had become
unsafe for an adherent of the old faith.
Seemingly it is safe again.
A humorous coincidence of the week was
(1) the announcement of Gregory,
that he was “greatly impressed witp the
Priminister’s immigration policy,” so much
so that it was powerfully tempting him .to
join the Government, and (2) the resignation
of Gullett, Superintendent of Immigration, on
the ground that there is no policy to ad-
minister. "‘Nothing could be worse than the
present system,” said the fed-up man who is
leaving the absurd billet that was .specially
made for him. Gullett is said to be looking
towards Federal politics —the Labor side of
it, judging by his present outburst. Or it
may be that he is ready to be a faithful
follower of Watt.
Amid all the blither about building new
railways in Queensland, where the existing
lines pay 9s. per cent, on money that costs
nine times as much, nobody ever gets enthusi-
astic about the Longreach-Winton connec-
tion—a link that has more to be said in its
favor than almost any other public work
Queensland can mention. The railway
authorities have for years recommended it,
every public man of any standing admits it
onglit to be built,, and the press is practically
unanimous. But nobody ever pushes it,
though Government journals barrack madly
for railways that everybody knows will be a
dead loss, and want to spend a million in
opening up the Burnett by one route when it
could be as effectively opened up by another
at a cost of some £200,000. If only certain
well-known people had a copper-show half-
way between Longreach and Win ton, or if the
western votes were so uncertain that pur-
chase became a necessity, the connection would
be run through. But it wouldn’t put any
fresh votes into anybody’s pocket, and that
settles it.
When the new Acting-Minister for Home
and Territories (Senator Earle) had fitted
on his crown his first statement was that
the Northern Territory ought to be developed.
After which he fell into a deep reverie. When
it is a question of developing any other spot
—Oberon or Menindie or Dobbyn or Meeka-
tharra —everybody thinks of a railway first
thing. And when it is a cgse of reducing
the distance across Australia by one-half, and
opening a new short route to Japan. China,
India, the Philippines, the Dutch Indies, etc.,
and when there are 500,000 square miles of
country to be exploited and the line is half-
built already, one would think that some
Minister would get an inkling, instead of
drowning in a bog of bewilderment. Perhaps
if there were 11 Federal Parliamentary votes
at Darwin, as there were at Perth in 1907,
a flood of light would break in on people like
Earle.
“Dr. Nil” has a visitor: —
To-day I had a proof of the wonderful efficiency
of your Dooleyism. We people in benighted South
Aus. have been' reading every day in our papers
about t)ie Dooley Government “not being pressed for
monev,” and its intention to “keep wages up,” and
provide “motherhood endowment” at a cost of mil-
lions. Therefore 1 was not in the least surprised
when a sleek and well-dressed young man called to-
day with a printed receipt-book and told me ; he was
“collecting on behalf of the distressed of Broken
Hill.” He was soliciting alms for Mr. Dooley’s
staunchest supporters! When I recovered from the
shohk of admiration caused by the request for
charitable aid from a sister State ruled by a Govern-
ment that “is not pressed > for money” and has
created the workers’ K 1 Dorado, which it is pre-
sently going to multiply by two, I mildly suggested
that Broken Hill might as well “buy its sugar
where it bought its tea,” as we used to say in Lon-
don.
Theodore is following Lenin in out of the
wet. At Laidley the other day he com-
mitted his Government to a policy of co-
operation for the farmers —not the compul-
sory sort of co-operation, which is socialism
or communism, but voluntary co-operation
on the Yankee plan. There wasn’t a word
in the speech about Government ownership,
and the socialisation of the means of produc-
tion, distribution and exchange was also
ignored. “Co-operation,” said Theodore, “is
the best form of self-help for the man on the
land.” That statement alone should make
him a candidate for expulsion at the next
A.L.P. conference. The Labor politician
who preaches self-help proclaims himself an
enemy of the Revolution. The brand of the
bourgeois is on his brazen brow.
The prospects of the Commonwealth ship-
ping line grow bleaker than a lost Arctic
expedition. The Hun, who was a mighty
shipbuilder, not a mere shipbuyer, is at it
again. He built 25,000 tons of new vessels
in 1919, 250,000 in 1920. 600,000 in 1921, and
750.000 tons are looked for in 1922. The
Hun is building his ships at half the British
cost, which has lately been terrificyet it
is in Britain that Hughes’s real ships are
being built, though it is against German
ships that they will presently have to com-
pete. No nation that went to sea in bought
ships ever became a marine power; and no
nation that buys a fleet on a falling market
is ever likely to be a power at all. Inci-
dentally, it is characteristic that the line
should advertise “Regular Monthly Sail-
ings,” one vessel leaving on March 4 and
the next on Mav 10. Monthliness of that
sort breeds contempt. The passenger may
put up with it; but for the shipper of goods
it would mean ruin.
In one respect proportional representation
gives the public more fight for its money
than the single-electorate system. Where it
is pretty certain that two Blues and one
Buff will be elected, or vice versa, the efforts
of the Blues to destroy one another (for,
of course, a ticket of three must be run)
are at least as exciting as their collective
struggle with the other side. Cootamundra
(N.S.W.), for instance, is represented by
two Laboritcs and one Nationalist, and is
expected to vote the same way on March
25. The two Labor members are Loughlin,
the Lands Minister, and McGirr, Minister
of Motherhood, but having got a softer
thing in Sydney McGirr has transferred his
nomination, and with it his hatred of Lough-
lin, to brother Jim. So cordially do these
great democrats loathe one another that
each is advising his supporters to give their
second votes to the third Laborite Hoad;
also, Loughlin has publicly described McGirr
as a “shallow and unscrupulous limelighter”
with whom he wouldn’t be seen dead in any
constituency. Prop. rep. admits of one
comrade discharging venom at another. In
other days they had to bottle it up for the
sake of “the movement.”
From a member of the branch :—•
“Henry Horsecollar’s” grunt of dissatisfaction
(B. 16/2/’22) at the latest edition of the N.S.W.
Nationalist platform finds support amongst branches
whose resolutions, having been passed by confeience,
have been either omitted altogether or mangled in
process of inclusion. That cryptic reference to
“Yass Junction —Border of Federal Capital area,’
is a case in point. As the Yass Women’s Branch
moved it this resolution read:—
That the railway from Yass Junction to the
border of the Federal Capital area be proceeded
vvith at the earliest possible moment.
This is a vastly different proposition from the un-
intelligible balderdash on the printed platform. The
latter makes it appear that the Nationalists want the
Federal Capital area extended 28 or so miles to
embrace all the area between the present border
and Yass Junction. Had the plank been classified
under “Railways,” as it should have been, all
would have been plain.
“OO-O-O-O-OH!"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Dooley delivered his policy speech at
Bathurst.”
The shades of night were falling fast
When into Bathurst town there passed
A stranger, roaming vaguely through
In search of myths and marvels new.
And, lo! in that dim twilight hour
Out from the Town Hall’s stately tower
To east and west and south and north
A weird, wild fireworks show burst forth.
Swift rockets climbed to starry heights,
Then broke in showers of brilliant lights
That scattered promises around,
And fell, mere half-burnt sticks, to ground.
Great colored fires shone out like moons,
With spurting squibs that scattered boons;
Utopias flamed like soaring birds

And last, while brass bands banged and blared,
The great set-pieces lit and flared—
The glorious views of Times-to-be

Tableaux that told of vast loans spent,
Cheap beer and babies, coal and rent.

And gasped, “What means this outburst weird ?”

“There was not one of the points raised by the deputation that had not had his consideration, and it was because of that he was in the Cabinet. He believed in those things, and believed it was the duty of everyone to get
Australia down to a proper basis in regard to them. That was the sole reason that induced him to take the position of Treasurer.” —Federal Treasurer Bruce to an -’Economy" deputation.

The latest entries in the profits column sug-
gest that the A. G.'Li Co. has just managed
to squeeze out the statutory B’p.eLfor share-
holders. But they do not present earnings
in an altogether satisfactory way. The
N.S.W. Gas Act permits regulated cos. to.
charge annually against : revenue for replace-
ments, renewals and so on 31 p.c. of the
capital outlay on work ( B, etc., and stipulates
that the accumulation, is nOt at any time to
exceed 10 p.c. of the share and borrowed
capital. Since the passing of the amending
Act which permitted this lay-by conditions
have been unsettled, and this co.’s appropria-
tions for depreciation and various etceteras
have varied widely. The amounts So charged
against revenue, and the balances in hand
at the close of each half-year, have been
as follows: —

principal revenue and expenditure items
helps to explain the improvement —

Maintenance.. 67,465 123,238 137,259 160,991
A feature of the comparison is the largely
increased outlay on repairs and maintenance.
One way and another the co. has lately
been doing very well, and with gas at its
present proclaimed price it is likely to do
better. The old city works have been
vacated, and production is now concentrated
at Mortlake: and that should effect a saving.
Under the award controlling wages, the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s cost-of-living figures
automatically effect readjustments. In this
way a reduction of Is. per week was recently
made, and that, too, will help current earn-
in S s - . . . . -
But any improvement of profits is not
likely to give shareholders more than the
standard 8 p.c. div.: that is, unless the man-
agement distributes a bit extra before the
Labor and Industry Minister wakes up, or
unless the co. is able to induce the Minister
that it should be permitted to pay more than
the standard div. The sliding scale pro-
vided in the original Act still stands. For
every Id. by which the co. reduces the
standard price of gas—the standard price is
the latest price declared by the Court —the
co. is permitted to pay an extra I p.c. when
the reduction has operated for 12 months.
For every Id. reduction operating for six
months i p.c. increase of div. is allowed
for the year. With production costs on the
down-grade, there seem possibilities in this
sliding-scale arrangement, and if the talked-
of voluntary reduction in the price of gas does
take place, it will be interesting to see what
happens when dividend time comes round.
It is very doubtful how Parliament would
view any dividend increase achieved in this
way: the co. might lift its div. rate once,
but probably the Minister would then step
in. Under the Act, he has access to the
Court: he may institute an inquiry, and
secure a reduction in the price of gas to a
level which will merely provide the amount
required to pay the standard div. . The
weakness of the Act is that there is no
inducement for the cos. to effect savings by
improving their organisation. If the A. G.
L. Co. could prove to the satisfaction of
the Minister —or, preferably, in open
Court—that it had been able to make cer-
tain additional profits wholly by increased
efficiency, there is no reason why the co.
should not be allowed to do what it l lccs
with those profits. The present method of
adjusting prices according to costs regard-
less of any standard of productive efficiency
is merely' inviting waste and go-slow
methods.
There is now £2.152,428 of shareholders’
capital and £1.701,513 of borrowed money
in the concern. Last year the directors
made an effort to place, more shares to pro-
vide for extensions, but the virtual guar-
antee of 8 p.c. p.a. which the _ Gas Act
provides was not sufficiently enticing at the
time the issue was offered. The co. fin ally
got all the funds it required by issuing
£450,000 of 74 p.c. five-year debentures.

The'directors’ report usually has ; something
to say; but on this occasion it is as silent as
frozen, mutton. The slump of net profits to
£5052, which was probably not more than
outside ’ investments gave, is eloquent of the
condition of the meat-export trade during the
12 months. Still, if a falling-off of profit
is the worst that is to happed to this big In-
vercargill concern, it will have got off lightly.
Some other cos. in the business which made
extensive: and costly additions to. their,
works on borrowed money when managements
lost thqir heads because war-contracts had
given magnificent profits, have crashed hor-
ribly. The Southland co., however, is in
a different category. Whatever additions it
has made have come from profits, and while
since 1915 in the books fixed assets have
shown a net growth of less than - -£45,000,
£92,734 of profits have been stored. This
co., no doubt, learned its lesson in the ’nine- •
ties : it had a rough spin then, some capital
was written off, and divs. for many years
were meagre, 21 p.c. being paid on the;writ-
ten-down capital for a time. When the war
boom gave fat profits the Board exerdised
Scotch caution and held on to the bawbees:
in 1919, for instance, net profits represented
(57 p.c. on capital as increased by a bonus
issue just previously, but only 8 p.c. was paid
to shareholders. So the co. is in a very
strong position

Of the £113.248 final entry in the compari-
son £68,411. was the book value of invest-
ments, and after payment of the year’s
div. there was £15,000 cash in hand.
These two items were alone £17,600 in excess
of all liabilities. So there were no anxious
creditors, and the cq. is in a position to sit
tight and wait until old-world markets re-
cover.
Meantime, as reserves almost equal paid
capital, shareholders’ position is very snug.
Slightly more than one-half of their paid
capital is represented by the surplus of liquid
assets over liabilities. That leaves free-
hold and leasehold properties, works, machin-
ery, plant, etc., at four centres with a . book
value of £168,555 to back the £56,300 balance
of capital not represented by liquid assets.
And, most likely, during the flush years the
book values of fixed assets were carefully re-
viewed. Owing to the capitalisation of re-
serves, the 8 p.c. div. nowadays gives alirtost
one-third more to shareholders than 10 p.c.
did formerly.

This co. has had a remarkable career. It
was one of the old-time Melbourne boom
floats, and £lOO,OOO of its capital was swept
away when the day of reckoning arrived.
That left but £20,000 of scrip, and on even
that miserable remnant only 5 p.c. was being
paid as recently as 1908. About, 10 years ago
£OOOO more was got in to help, making paid
capital £20,000. The business has been so
carefully nursed and extended that latest
profits represented more than 50 p.c. on that.
Last year’s profits were exceptional, though,
and may not recur. Not so long ago, despite
the handsome divs. paid, shares were picked
up at par. Since then £32,500 of bonus scrip
has been added, so to the lucky ones who got
in at around par some years ago, the latest
20 p.c. div. means nearer 45 p.c. The co.
experienced no trouble during recent years in:

Revenue shown above does not include rents
and interest. Last year the co.- went into
occupation of the adjoining Wrixon’s Build-
ing, which it had purchased, remodelled and
pushed two storeys higher. The outlay—pro-
vided from an accumulation of cash assets —
has been justified by the £lOOO increase of
rents during the year. And while income
thus improved exes, were brought down by
the lower cost of provisions, by reducing staff,
find by installing labor-saving devices. Also,
having made liberal allowances for repairs in
previous years, the demands on that account
were smaller. But the directors do not hold
out hopes of continuing 20 p.c. divS.; the
latest transfer to capital mopped up most of
the accumulated profits, and they now talk
of the “need for building up the reserve fund
afresh.”
Taid capital is, £58,500, and the co. is
working on a £15,000 mortgage from the
Savings Bank. This compares the balance-
sheet position at various dates: —

This well-known artesian-boring business
was established in 1888, when several Can-
adian drillers entered into partnership. In
1897 it developed into a co., registered and
controlled in Canada. Only. £2160 of capi=-
tal was paid into the venture, and between
1890 and 1912 £32,362 was distributed in
divs,; but so much had been left in the busi-
ness . that when assets were appraised for
sale to a local co, nine years ago, a value
of £91,500 was placed upon. them. Including
goodwill, the present co, paid £lOO,OOO for
the business—£so,ooo of it in cash, the
balance in shares. Additional capital was
also raised to extend the local manufacture
of boring-plants, windmills, pumping machin-
ery, oil-engines, etc., and to finance trading
in imported machinery and hardware. The
co. nowadays has an extensive range of
agencies. . ...
In the first eight years net profits aver-
aged 104 p.c. on capital, after writing off
annually for depreciation 10 p.c. of boring-
plants, 'teams and conveyances, and 5 p.c.
of other fixed assets. Dividends averaged
8 p;c. per annum, and the lay-by of prom
improved the co.’s position by £lB,OOO-odd.
In 1920, however, £10,500 of reserves were
capitalised, and this resulted in about £lBOO
of the enlarged share register being repre-
sented by goodwill assets at October, -O.
A new issue of shares was made just prior
to the close of that year’s accounts, partly
to finance a new four-storey warehouse in
Brisbane, and to carry larger and more costly
stocks. The latter half of last year was
very unfavorable for the co.: m.arkets for
pastoral products crashed, and income-tax
assessments were burdensome. All artesian-
boring was suspended, the demand for the
co.’s goods fell off, and the financial year
closed with very large unrealised stocks.
A net profit of £9209 was shown after pro-
viding for taxation, but nothing was appa-
rently allowed for depreciation, the direc-
tors considering it “desirable to be prepared
for any decrease in the market value of
stocks rather than providing for the general
depreciation of plant, etc., so largely written
off in past years.’’ It was also decided to
leave the matter of payment of a dividend
to the discretion of directors.
The next table shows how the balance-
sheet position has changed over the past
three years and since the first accounts
were presented:—

The extent of the stocks and the trifling
amount at credit of the boring account are
eloquent of the co.’s troubles at the balanc-
ing date. The £148,719 of stocks at a time
when buyers were few and prices were
steadily declining made the co.’s position
far from comfortable; Everything for the
moment depends on unloading the large
stocks, and conditions have certainly not
been favorable since the balance. At best,
it seems unlikely that the co. will show much
profit for the current year; and it will be
very fortunate if it gets through without
loss. The directors no doubt now regret
their haste in capitalising £10,5€0 of
accumulated profits when business was boom-
ing. The result of that transfer was that,
though no div. was paid last year, at the
latest balance reserves were small in rela-
tion to paid capital. Had the £10,500 not
been capitalised, the co. would have a much
stronger first-line defence in the event of
stock values giving trouble.

table remained. In the first year a rebate
of gd. per sheep shorn wa.s made, and for
1921 the allowance was doubled, the net
charge last year thus amounting per
head. Meantime the co. has paid 6| p.c. on
capital—divs. are limited to 7 p.c.—£1214 of
formation exes, have been met, and reserves
of £3136 have accumulated. Consequently
the co. has been got into a comfortable posi-
tion : in buildings, plant and- machinery
£l7BO is sunk, there Is £1467 in stocks;
book debts amounting to £2918 and £8972 of
£ash remained after payment of the recent

that the whole of the £1063 set aside for
taxation goes that way. the concern holds
£8376 (net) liquid. Paid capital is £7OOB

Published figures offer no evidence as to
whether the co-op. co. is fleecing jumbucks
for the pastoralists more cheaply and effici-
ently than did the P.E. contractor. But the
directors report that “clients, on the whole,
are very satisfied” with the manner in which
work has been done, and add that, though a
wet season made operations expensive, “the
cost in no instance has been excessive, and
we have the satisfaction of learning from
sheep-owners generally that the advent of
this co. has been the means of keeping the
contract price of shearing Within reasonable
limits.”

Melbourne Office: 440 Little Collins Street,
Last week the Federal Government re-
enacted, under the Customs Act, the former
War Precautions prohibition agamst the
exportation from the Commonwealth, with-
out Ministerial assent, of metals, alloys and
minerals. It will he interesting to know
at whose request this has been done. At
the moment there are a few brave mortals
who are trying to save their souls and their
mining interests from destruction, and the
h ederal Government comes along with its
war-time restrictions to make the task
harder, if not impossible. Some time ago,
in response to pressure from all quarters,
'V. M. Hughes removed the restriction on
export, and as a consequence several mines
were able to re-open. Now it is up to the
Prime Minister to pause from his labors at
the conference which he has called to bring
about an increase of production, and state
who it is that wants our mines closed up
again and why. It is futile to argue that
the restriction will not close mines. It
wi.l, and those who have influenced the re-
lmposition of the export restriction know it.

The cabled account of the debate in the
House of Commons last week on the zinc-
concentrate contract is very interesting
reading in Australia at this juncture. It
throws some light ’ upon ' the little bubble
that was pricked recently by the manager
of the British mine at Broken Hill when,
to the consternation of those cos. which
were already well under way with serious
production, he decided to open up. In the
Commons debate a sum of £601,200 was
mentioned as a supplementary estimate to
cover the “estimated loss on the'zinc con-
centrates and spelter purchased in Aus-
tralia.” Truly the estimate is merely sup-
plementary, for, as the. Commons can see
plainly, that zinc-concentrates, and spelter
contract is going to cost the British tax-
payer millions of - pounds.
The president of the Board of Trade
admitted that the contract “was a bad one.”
One Liberal wanted to know “who signed
the final contract with the Australian
patriots,” and a Labor Commoner remarked
that Mr. Hughes “deserved credit for show-
ing Australia how patriotism could be made
to pay.” Another Liberal, “while admitting
that they could not break contracts, urged
the Government to approach the Australians
and press them for a square deal.” Though,
as one member put it, “the contract was
made in _the fervor of war-time excitement
and patriotism,” the British Government is
usually well able to take care of itself even
under such conditions. But some of the
war contracts had features other than ex-
citement attached to them. Several of them
came to light in Australia. It is perhaps
not to Australia’s discredit that she is to
be asked for a fair deal. The necessity for
asking should be probed at the other end.
If the British Government approaches
Prime Minister Hughes for a “square deal,”
as suggested,, probably the most surprised
man will be William Morris Hughes him-
self. As pointed out time and again by
The Bulletin during the war, the Prime
Minister in his metal policy was uncon-
sciously a tool for. powerful interests, and
well before the slump in prices came the
base metal industry of Australia was, thanks
to that policy, well on the way to extinc-
tion. _ On the face of it it appeared that
the zinc contract was a fine thing for the
Commonwealth generally, and for Broken
Hill in particular. But that was the short
view. If it were investigated in all its
bearings, the contract would be found to
be nothing short of a calamity to the Com-
monwealth. In the first place, it is such
an outrageously bad one for the buyer that
it cannot last. Only during war-time could
business be done on such impossible lines.
In the second place, if the contract is
allowed to be administered as at present, it
will not only cost the British taxpayers a
heap of money, but it is likely to sound the
death-knell, of several of the smaller Broken
Hill mines, and perhaps one or two others,
and ruin many shareholders. The Bulletin
some weeks ago warned shareholders that
they should bestir themselves, and ask their
directors a few pertinent questions. The
position is now such that every member of
every Board should be a real live man, and
no mere puppet.

A recent Mines Department estimate gives
the number of stamps on the Westralian
goldfields at about 2000 and other crushing
plants at ISO. More than 500 stamps and
167 of the other mills are in and around
Kalgoorlie, arid the remainder are spread
over 17 live and dead fields. The value of
the lot is computed at 2i millions, but as
a number of the plants have been rusting
for years and a lot of others are idle, their
actual value is considerably less. In fact,
some: plants in isolated places would pro-
bably not fetch the cost of dismantling and
transport. The worth' of copper-treatment
plants is estimated at £l5 000 : tin. £68;000 :
coal. £130,000: and lead. £lOO.OOO. But
tjie last item does not include the value of
the Fremantle smelters, owned by the
Golden Horseshoe crowd and others.
The syndicate of Adelaide and Kalgoorlie
specula tors who bought the White Hope,
Hampton Plains, has not done much so far,
but it anticipates making £20,000 out of
ore in sight. At the time the show- changed
hands reserves were estimated at 15,000 tons
of £3 ore, and there was plant said to be
worth at least £2OOO, besides buildings, a
manager’s house, a motor-car and a fair
stock of stores. The purchase price was
only £3OOO, and local shareholders are won-
dering who were the fortunate buyers.
* * * *
Freney’s shareholders want to know why
10,000 shares paid to 15s. have been sold to
Bruce and Co., of Adelaide, at £1 apiece,
and the reasons for giving the same crowd
a_six-mouths’ option on a further 10.000 at
255. When the deal was made buyers were
offering over 28s. Many scrip-owners are
sore because they were not given the oppor-
tunity of taking up the shares.
* * * »
A shindy is being raised in the West over
the doings of oil-concession holders in that
State. Some who have never seen their
holdings or done any prospecting on them
are selling square miles of country to blown-
out Hampton Plains cos. at absurd prices;
others are farming out portions of their
blocks in lots to suit purchasers; others
again are shepherding in the hope that an
early boom will enable them to sell. The
Government is being urged to compel the
concessionaires to bore or get out.
* * * *
Ivalgurli shareholders are likely to get £1
per share from the liquidators, or about 4s.
more than was recently estimated. For its
area the mine was for years one of the:
greatest and richest at Kalgoorlie. Gold
worth more than 4£ millions lias been won
to date, and nine-tenths of it has come from
a shoot barely 450 ft. in length in some levels,
and much shorter in others. Payable ore
gave out 1700 ft. down some years ago, when
the mainshaft reached calc-schist. To pre-
serve the workings some pillars have been
left, and from these and other spots tribu-
tors are likely to do well for a time. But
the property no longer offers any attractions
for working by a co.
*** . * ;
“8.E.”: Reference to the Great Fingall
(B. 23/2/’22) reminds me that the closing
down was due not so much to the ore being
low-grade, as to the working out of reserves.
The barrier to further development was the
steady shortening of the shoot; at the bottom
level (2400 ft.) there was only 200 ft. of it.
Winzes from the, bottom level disclosed 2oz.
stone, but the north end of the shoot was cut
off by the north wall of the dyke in which,
the. reef lay sloping steadily at 42 degrees,:
while the run of values in tlie south end
diminished at a much flatter angle. The re- 1
suit was that a year’s development would
yield only about 10,000 tons ore, and to main-
tain costs at a workable figure at least 48,000 ;
tons per vear were required. The patches
worked so profitably by the tributors until
the caving-in of the mine were the leavings of
the boom days in the upper levels.
The deep-lead at Elsmore Valley (N.S.W.)
is _to be given another trial. A co. with
£2500 tackled the proposition in the mid-
’nineties. It put down a shaft which bot-
tomed on slate at 225 ft., got into values after
driving 30ft., and dug out 643 tons tin. When
375 ft. down the lead a steep fall in the bot-
tom occurred, and, not having the funds to
sink deeper, water troubles beat the co. there.
Meantime. 3000 ft. up-stream the lead was
lost, and though the co. had paid its way for
eight years work ceased altogether. ' The
lead was given another go in 1911 by a
Brisbane crowd, but inefficient pumping plant
and the war suspended operations, and . the
leases were forfeited. Now Grey Wilson,
of Tingha Tin, and formerly of Y-Water,
having weighed up the geology, believes good
values should be got down the lead, particu-
larly where several tributaries come in. Scr
from James Mackay’s Melbourne office comes
a prospectus of the Elsmore Valley Deep-
Lead Prospecting Syndicate, in which big
guns G. 0. Klug, P. R. Sutherland and
H. H. Schlapp figure. Capital is £3OOO,
in 60 shares of £5O each; a dozen shares go
to the vendors, and . more than half of the
30 offered for subscription had been applied
for prior to the issue of the invitation. The
programme is to put down six bores to
locate the gutter; and as the N. S. Wales
Mines Department has undertaken to pay
half the cost of boring, the promoters reckon
£lOOO will cover the syndicate’s share. If
all goes well the syndicate will be absorbed
by a £30.000 co. Leases totalling 1759
acres have been taken up. and Wilson hopes
to find at least four miles of lead in the
area: but he will be lucky if six bores prove
ample to give a reliable guide.

N. R. Wales bauxite denosits are receiv-
ing the attention of the Mines Dena»*t:ment.
Those at Wingello. near M n ss Vale, are
alreadv being worked bv a Metbon’me vo-
in two of six leases four million tons
have' been proved. The ore wMch gives
aluminium also promises tn provide another
string for the I*nrp rf d] n nd Emmaville tin
districts. The Mines Department has re-
cently been making a preliminary investiga-
tion of these northern deposits, and numer-
ous samples have been sent to Sydney for
testing.
E. K. Hill, of B. H. Junction North, goes
to Cootamundra to mine-manage the promis-
ing Christmas Gift. That show has re-
sponded well to development, but it is still
early to measure up its worth. The pro-
gramme is to get down deeper and see what
happens to the formations there. Judging
from their dip in the present workings, there
is a possibility that they will come together
lower down, and, if so, the Gift should have
a huge body to operate.
The Clark-Wesley, Gundagai (N.S.W.),
is now assured of ample water. A pipe-line
to the big dam left by the old-timers has
been laid, and the pumping plant is ready.
Coincident with W. H. Corbould’s repre-
sentations to British and French share-
holders for further capital to work the Mt.
Elliott group, the London Mining Magazine
placed his proposed new copper-extraction
process before the British public. The essen-
tials of it are a sulphating roast, leaching,
chemical and electrolytic precipitation of
copper and the use of producer gas for the
whole metallurgical operation. Coke at £6
in Cloncurry killed any chance of treating
the huge low-grade ores of the grouD by
direct smelting, and that, explains Corbould’s
interest in the search for a low-volatile coal
locally and the • purchase of an interest in
the White Mountain coal, near Pentland.
The half-million tons low-grade sulphide ore
in the Mt. Elliott ,mine first started Corbould
on the hunt. Mt. Oxide, although primarily
a high-grade deposit, has enormous possibili-
ties in low-grade stuff, apart from the Con-
sols, Great Australia and the other strings.
It is unlikely that Corbould would have per-
mitted the process to be published if he had
not. been reasonably sure of its applicability
to the Mt. Elliott ores. _ If the process is all
it looks, much ore which had to be passed
over in the past in the old mines may yet
yield a profit for Mt. Elliott.

The Billy Hughes G. M. Co., which was
formed by P. F. Meredith’s syndicate after
it had started a mild revival in the Nor-
manby goidfield, back of Bowen (N.Q.), has
been working four of its shows during the
past year without any very startling results.
The reefs in the Boss Smith, Billy Hughes
and Perseverance have proved small so far,
being mostly under a foot, and values are
rather patchy, although good values have
been found in each. Still, it is too early
to expect the co. to have much idea of how
the shoots are pitching. In view of the
experience in the Frederick mine, where a
6ft. face was sampled for lOdwt., it can
reasonably be expected that any of the
smaller fry may at any time develop into
something decent. There are small crush-
in gs of high-grade ore available for the new
10-head battery, and they will help to
finance development. While there has not,
been-much success so far, the indications are
considered quite bright enough to go on with.
The, co. has a string of lodes to test in the
Grant mines if the others don’t come up to
expectations.
■* * * *
The Kangaroo Hills tinfield (N. 0.),
which, has produced two good mines, the
Sardine and the Shrimp, amongst a host of
smaller fry, has given evidence of another
good prospect which the super-optimist
reckons is “as good as the Sardine was at
the same stage.” The fish vocabularly hav-
ing been exhausted locally it is called the
Canary. As for comparisons with the Sardine,
yet there is not overmuch tn go on. Peter
the cold facts are that the shaft is down only
40ft., and as there is little other work done
Christensen located the show and disposed
of it locally for £5OO. It looks well; a vein
averaging 15in. in the shaft is going 30 p.c.
metal. The first crushing of 11. tons yielded
3 tons 18cwt. black tin/ which gives the ore
an approximate assay value of 24 p.c. metal.
As. most of the. lodes, including the Sardine,
carry the ore in lenses, the local pessimist
will want to see at least a couple of levels
scooped out before passing judgment.
* * * *
Tailem Bend and Murray Coal is pushing
ahead with development of the brown-coal
deposits at Moorlands (S.A.). The co. has
spent nearly £lO,OOO on testing the basin;
two shafts 150 ft. apart have been sunk, and
450 ft. of driving done. . The Government
has put down 33 bores, and, discarding all
seams less than sft. thick, more than 2f
million tons have been proved in 130 acres.
So far 800 tons have been raised and 200
tons despatched for experimental purposes.
Boring is to continue, the Government hav-
ing undertaken to operate and report on
the deposits if the co. will instal a light
drill designed by Mines Department boring-
ensrineer C. F. Duffield. and which should
reduce the cost of boring below even the
present ss. lOd. per foot. The Tailem
co.’s big trouble is transport. Five miles
cartage to the railway takes,lss. per inn,
and rail to Adelaide 10s. 3d. more. The
co. has appealed to the Government to link
up the field with a railway whi oh „ u

After a long silence, during which the
market became uneasy, Nawng Pet (P MS i
has come to light with a return of 74 tmi,
tin from 22,617yd5. handled in the first W
night of last month. Malaya has had a dry
season, and the Pet’s inadequate water-con-
seivation made continuous work impossible.
Ihe delayed wet season set in early last
month and the elevators got going. Water
is still the problem ; but one of three schemes
which were recommended at flotation is to
be proceeded with. Manager Mulligan has
materials on the spot to commence construc-
tion of the dam.

From an Australian in Burma:
The delay in constructing the Burma Corporation’s
zinc smelters at Jamshedpur (India) is in part due
to the fact that a suitable zinc product has not yet
been got at the mine; the extremely fine state of
division of the zinc and lead has hitherto been the
difficulty. This and other metallurgical troubles
are now being investigated by E. P. Matthewson.
Production since the last report (June, 1921) has
increased, figures for the month of October being
8827 tons of concentrate smelted yielding 3000 tons
refined lead and approximately 300,0000 z. of silver,
the zinc being sent to the slag. With its high silver
content this mine can be run profitably even at the
present price of metals, but there is little doubt
that the capital is excessive. The manager nowadays
is P. E. Marmion, who years ago was in Westralia.

Harry Gullett, the young man who is hav-
ing an argument with Hughes about immi-
gratio’* belongs to a family that is or has
been connected with innumerable Austra-
lian newspapers; and Hughes probably re-
membered it when he accepted the pushing
young man’s services as publicity agent, etc.,
just after the war. They were then thrown
a good deal into one another’s company, and
their wives came to Australia on a troop-
ship together in 1919. A little later, to
the astonishment of many a senior man in
the Commonvyealth service who has given
his life to his job and now draws six or
seven hundred a year, Gullett was appointed
head of Immigration activities at this end
at £l5OO a year. Having supplied him with
a job Hughes evidently thought lie had
done all that could be expected of him. He
didn’t realise that this was the unusual sort
of young man who wanted to be supplied
with, work as well as a job.
Andrew Fisher, having decided that he
can’t fit in with Australian Labor as it is
now, is seeking a job with the very different
British Labor party as M.P. for Kilmarnock
(Scotland). It is a pretty tough proposi-
tion, judging by past election results.

When Peacock was Premier for the first

Education, to go to the Carlton Training
College, and get Principal Tate for the bigger
job. So the young man ol 38, who looked
32, was installed. Peacock is Minister for

the thousands of. appointments made by the
1,0 Governments with which he has been

CLARE LEES,
the new Anglican
Archbishop of
Melbourne.
J. S. Reid, a contemporary of Archibald’s
in North Queensland journalism, died at
Maeedon (Vic.) recently.. Archibald came
south to help found The Bulletin 42 years
ago; Red, after running a paper for a
while at Wilcannia, moved across to a new
mining field which had just been discovered
on the S. Australian border, and established
the Silver Age at Silverton. Later it was
moved to Broken Hill; but by that time Reid
had made enough money out of one of the
various Round Hill booms, and had got
enough shares, in the Broken Hill Prop., to
rather despise the bright little infant with
the ink-smudge on its face. Apart from
the Broken Ilill Prop. Reid was not con-
nected with' ninny successes: the Emu Bay
railway and, the- Chillagoe Co. were- his

both of them. 1
Professor Mefedjth Atkinson is resign-
ing from Melbourne; Uni. staff to take over
the Review of , Reviews business. That’s
what he is best suited for. He is a natural-
successor to the Steads, and in their place
will have plenty of scope for saying the
wrong thing in a very earnest manner.
Charles Kierath, who died a few days ago
at Chiltern, aged 94, was Victoria’s pioneer
band-conductor. Arriving at Port Phillip
in the Arabia in ’55, he toured the goldfields
with his brasses till -most of his men deserted
to go digging. Thfen he took up land in the
Chiltern district, and distiiiguished himself
as a prize wheat-grower and - fomato-sauce
maker.
While in Sydney the millionair£._owner of
the yacht Speejacks shipped two dinkum
Aussies to run his little marvel-boat. Robert
Stewart, who took over as 1 skipper, has been
doing first-officer work with the 8.-P. Co. for
some time, and O. A. Granowski, who shipped
as engineer, is a graduate of Sydney Uni,,'

gave him a- day to get rid of his regular

to finish the tour with the cement-maker
and write up the story of the whole adven-

or so: and his idea is to then move on to
London, encouraged thereto by the success
of his friend Harrison Owen, whose work he
took over in Melbourne.
Sir Philip Proctor, who has come to Aus-
tralia as a director of Vestey’s, to investigate
matters in the Northern Territory, was during
the war the biggest wholesale butcher the
world has seen. He had charge of the meat
supplies not only for Britain and the British
and Dominion forces, but for the Allied
armies. He erred so much on the side of
safety that meat he had in cold store when
the Armistice was signed was being sold
well into 1921.
Allan McDougall topped the score in the
N.S.W. Labor pre-selection for the Senate.
He headed the Senate poll in 1910, being
then secretary of the Sydney Eight-Hour
Committee. This time he will have with
him ex-Senator Jack Grant and P. J. McGirr.
Donald Grant, one of the I.W.W. prison-
ers liberated after the Ewing report, is out
for Sturt, Brookfield’s old seat, as an Indus-
trial Laborite. Grant is a native of Inver-
ness, and belongs to a numerous family whose
members are widely scattered. One is in
the Transvaal, another in Germany, and others
in Canada and the U.S.A. The Australian
representative has one literary production to
his credit. He called his book'“Through Six

A dead man was the other day elected by
the votes- of the Sydney Councils to repre-
sent them on the Board of Fire Com-
missioners. ■ Between the taking and the
counting of the votes William Taylor, ex-
M.L.A., dropped dead, and the tally showed
that he had got 55 out of the 125 votes cast
for seVen candidates. The returning-officer,
after consulting Costs, gave the e’ection to the
next man, G. J. Baker, of Randwick.
The allegation that Colin Ross, the alleged
murderer of Alma Tirtschke, was suffering
from “a certain trouble” , was a matter of
interest to Sidney John Harding, in whom
Ross is said to • have reposed his confidence
in the 'remand yard of Melbourne Gaol.

The, passing of Richard W. Chase, at
Bowral (N.S.W.), aged -78, recalls the
troublous times /of 1888-89, when he played
the chief part bn the side of the' squatters
against the shearers in the Walgett district.
Viewed by the light of modern standards,
their .demands were ludicrous—-a rise from
17s. 6d. to fl per 100 and leave to stipk up
the union rules in the sheds were the chief,
But the latter ■ demand hurt the squatters’
amour propre, and Chase to circumvent the
foe imported 40 alleged shearers from 1 Mel--
bourne, 1000 miles aviay. /. He left, Walgett
for Lanillo, a distance of 40 milejs, with but
one recruit —the rest had . promptly jpined

If the Federal Parliament ratifies the new
boundaries proposed for Capricornia (.Q.),
W. G. Higgs will have to stretch his long
legs to cover his constituency at the next
elections. Capricornia is already a consider-
, able- fragment of Australia ; but if, as sug-
gested, Bundaberg and other centres are
thrown in, the area will be; 73,130 sq. miles,
which i s ttyore than half that of the British
Isles. Higgs, who will probably be opposed
by a local Labor man, is already getting to
work and listening to resolutions of confi-
dence from people who toiled to throttle him
when he sat behind Tudor. As he hasn’t
changed much in political color, the spectacle
of former enemies dashing addresses of alle-
giance at his feet must supply him with a
good deal of amusement.

Lamond, tart enough as a private member, has
grown grumpier with the weight of his responsi-
bilities. Admittedly it isp’t easy to handle a job
that is full of pitfalls to the neophyte; but the
trouble is that Lamond, always dogmatic, wants
to argue over everything and indulge the delusion
that a show of obstinacy is evidence of 'an inde-

democrat and a good Australian from his white

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The years are onward flying, and though our hair is
brown,
There is no use denying that we should settle down;
Full thirty years we squandered, trusting to luck or
fate,
As restlessly we wandered—and now we’re forty-
eight !
This is no song of sorrow, bewailing chances lost ;
We’d do the same to-mbrrow and wouldn’t count the
cost; ' ' •
We’d mingle with the dancers, old-fashioned in oui
gait,
And lead a set o’ lancers though we ate" foPt-jv’-right.
How good was life at twenty, the twenties that were
gay! '/
Ten years of joy in plenty, ah ! how they/’slipped
away ! . 1 ' ■'./ ’•
And once when Fortune beckoned we 'hadn’t time to
wait— - V•> .
She’d call again, we reckoned,'when we wer.e forty
eight. .' r
But luck and health were failing, the pace began to
tell,
And wc were often ailing, and we’d a glimpse of
Hell; r
We girded up and rallied before it was too late;
But Mistress Fortune dallied—and now we’re forty-
eight.
Our mates of old are scattered—-some fallen by the
way-
But there was one that mattered, and h"e , 'was last
to stray;
A dreamer and a rover, he always travelled straight,
But his day-dreams were over'ere he was forty-eight.
At sixty, though we’re wheezing, we’ll sing a husky
song, l;
Or crack a joke that’s pleasing -to pass the time
along;
Yet should wc die to-morrow, we'd quarrel, not with
fate j r ’"/■. ■ . r
Nor wail a dirge of sorrow —we’Ve lived till forty-
eight. - f

SOCIETY
From Justice Schutt’s Court: —
One has to think back to the Deeming, Knorr
and Martha Needle trials to parallel the battle for
Colin Ross’s life in Melbourne last week. For the
first couple of days the proceedings were mostly con-
fined to the evidence given in the Coroner’s Court,
but on the Crown’s production of one “Darkey”
Upton the hushed house felt that the sensations con-
fidently promised by innumerable barbers and
washer-women were about to be turned on. Upton,
small and not prepossessing, told how he had called
at Ross’s saloon at midnight on the day Alma
Tirtschke disappeared, and how he had asked for
a bottle of wine, which was passed to him by a
bloody hand while a female voice inside said: “My God,
what shall we do with it?” or words to that effect.
The revelation, delivered with an apparent apprecia-
tion of its dramatic value, made its due impression,
but it was scorned by the defence, and even Crown
Prosecutor Macindoe admitted that it wasn’t good
enough to “hang a cat on.” Later, however, Upton
was almost forgotten in the critical examination of
the hairs found on one of the blankets. Price, the
Government Analyst, could only affirm that, in his
opinion, the reddish hairs belonged to the dead girl;
but he was confident that they had not fallen from
the buster crop of Mrs. Wain, who had been pricing
Ross’s goods and chattels at his saloon on the night
of the tragedy. The later phases of the case, when
Ross’s relations and friends mustered in force, each
contributing a brick to the structure of an alibi.
GENEROUS MAN.
“I thought he mas such an indulgent hus-
band and always gave you everything
you wanted.”
“Yes, so he did —even gave me grounds for
a divorce.”
caused an atmosphere of bewilderment, and a jury
of 11 unremarkable citizens, led by a foreman with
the face of a Roman emperor, were plainly feeling
the strain of hoarding up details for the final talk
in the jury-room. Not less interesting was the
searching work of counsel. Macindoe, Crown Prose-
cutor, handled his ease very well, but he was out-
matched, forensically and in cross-examination, by
the falcon-like Brennan and the urbane but tenacious
Maxwell. The latter, seeming to see through you,
though very short of sight, was alert to every point,
and his address to the jury was a masterpiece. And
seeming the most unconcerned through that long
week of jazzing temperatures in a court-room packed
to suffocation was tiio ni.tral figure in the show.
Plainly uniniagiivi!ivc, he was often perky, and re-
garded one witness's taking the oath in the Hebrew
manner with his hat on a s a juicy bit of comic
relief. In the witness stand lie was confident and
impudent, and his suggestion that one lady’s evi-
dence was stimulated by hopes of the reward was as
mordant as the innuendo that the police were a lot
of snail-gatherers. Psychologically and pathologi-
cally, Ross is indeed a study.
* * * *
“B.B.”: When the Warrego was running
a banker near Charleville (Q.) recently, a
tliree-year-old girl, Edith
Jerome, fell into a deep hole.
A mere boy, Jack Adams, heard
her scream, ran to the river
and plunged in without remov-
ing clothing or boots. The girl
had sunk when he got there,
and he had to dive deep to get
her. Then the falling-in habit
seems to have spread, for
shortly afterwards three other
youngsters tipped into the river
—and all were rescued by young
Adams. The children* didn’t
know the name of their rescuer,
and it took three weeks to dis-
close the identity of the gritty
but casual kid.

“Bill Bowyang”: Drovers in
the N. Territory are built on
tough lines. Last year Richards
and party left
Matarank a for
Borroloola with
a mob of sheep,
a journey that
took the best part
of 12 months. In
places the grass
was so dense and
high that the drov-
ers had to cut
roads through it in
order to move the
sheep. Eventually
the wet season
closed in and
they were not able
to travel for sev-
eral weeks. Run-
ning short of pro-
visions, they were
reduced to a small
piece of damper
each day, though
of course there
was plenty of mutton. At last a carrier
brought them 6cwt. of supplies, at a cost,
incidentally, of £5O. After delivering what
was left of the sheep at Borroloola, one of
the drovers went down with berri-berri and
malaria, and tossed about in the bottom of
a buggy on the 500-mile journey back to
the Katherine.
* * * *
“Wassa”: “Yairs,” he said in answer to
my inquiry, “I put it to her to marry me
once, but nothin’ seemed to come of it. It
was this way. Me being a bit shy in wim-
min’s company, I didn’t know how to set her;
but one evening I gets me chance. We were
going to the pitchers and passing Blank’s
furniture shop, I seen a big double bed in
the window all made up, so I stops her. ‘Look
there,’ I says, ‘what about us chucking, our
boots under one of them?’ And she just
passed it off as a joke. That was 10 years
ago, and we still walks out together. I’ll
ask her again one of these days.”
* *
“Spare Corp.”: As fine a thing as any
about the Digger was his almost universal
hatred of getting any other Digger into
trouble with the Heads. One sergeant in
A.I.F. headquarters, who did a lot of escort
duty, used to allow his prisoners liberty on
their hndertakmg to meet him at the train
that would take them to their destination.
He was only “slipped up” once. On
another occasion he got into trouble through
his own fault. The prisoner was well cashed
and shouted so often that the escort with its
prisoner mislaid itself. Then the prisoner,
finding himself detached, and anxious not to
land the escort in trouble, went back to
A.I.F. Headquarters to see if he could pick
them up —and duly turned on the trouble he
had tried to avoid. An escort was sent from
Larkhill to take charge of a'man who had
missed draft to France. Escort and prisoner
got astray in Southampton; and the
prisoner, being the only one tp turn uo at
the boat, duly reported and joined his unit.
His particular virtue was rewarded with a
fatal bullet at Ypres a couple of weeks later.
“Sixenate” : If this isn’t a record it ought
to be. A Sydney man, something of a
waster, was brought to repentance by the
sudden death of his father and the serious
illness of his mother. On the day of the
old man’s funeral the mother’s con-
dition became critical, a contributing
cause being information about the son’s
treatment of a girl who had trusted
him too much. She implored him to marry
the girl, and he did so in the forenoon.
Then he went to the funeral—and returned
from it -just in time to be with his mother
when she died. He was arrested that even-
ing ; but when his circumstances were
known he was released on his own bail (he
was subsequently found guilty but released
on bond). After getting his bail he received
the information that his bride of that morn-
ing had presented him rvith an heir. Wed-
ding, funeral, death, imprisonment, release
and parenthood—surely about the limit in
overcrowding for one day.

“Barney” : I beg to differ. I think Den-
nis’s drawings in “A Book for Kids” are a
disgrace, and we are insulting the intelli-
VERY LIKELY.
“What is the matter, Mrs. Brown?”
“I was just wondering, mum, if we was
photographed that way would we really
look like that.”
gence of our children by giving them the
book. Mind you, it is the drawings I’m
talking about. I think we are all wrong:
I cannot understand why we are jazzing our
children’s minds with hideous and grotesque
things. The little girl is given a horrid
golliwog, the little boy an ugly caricature
of a yellow, spotted pup or some other
atrocity to play with and learn to love. The
Sunday paper issues a children’s supplement
filled with the ugliest and most absurd draw-
ings imaginable. At the
Jutt and Meff and other caricatures are
screened for the children. This constant
association with the ugly and grotesque must
affect our children’s ideas, of form. Think
of a South Sea islander’s idea of beauty
and our own. We are spoiling the child’s
appreciation for beautiful things. Environ-
ment is one of the most powerful factors in
the formation of character. Then let us
surround the cbi'd with things beautiful that
he may develop likewise.

An old gaol doctor discusses sore throats:
Recent references to the desire to witness hangings
make me wonder, as one who has witnessed half-a-
dozen, where lies the lure in them for the ordinary
member of the public. No ceremony I have seen
occupied longer than a few minutes—l recall one
which, by the watch, took exactly lmin 40sec. from
beginning to end —and all were marked by a drab-
ness which seemed to rob the affair of a good deal
of its popularly conceived terrors. Anyhow, those
inside see very little more than those outside. There
is the preliminary muster in the governor’s office
and the inspection of credentials in order to see that
no unauthorised person is present, the double-file
procession across to the scaffold and the ten seconds
or so of legal mummery in the form of the demand for
the condemned man and his production—then an-
other half a minute and the whole thing is over.
The outstanding feature of most executions I have
seen has been the coolness of the principal actor.
My most lasting recollection will be that of hearing
an undersized youth of about 20 cracking hideous
jokes with the hangman as that functionary adjusted
the greased rope. Another, who was being ushered
out for a particularly brutal murder, sticks in my
memory because pf the excessive politeness with
which he behaved and the charmingly courteous
manner in which he apologised to the executioner for
delaying the proceedings while he made a briei
speech of thanks to the two warders in whose care
he had been while m the condemned cell With the
solitary exception of one person who had to be given
hypodermic injections' of strychnine, there was a
striking sameness in the behavior of all. One con-
demned man told me the day before his finish that
the chaplain had caused him to see his crime in its
true light, and that he looked forward to being
hanged because of the opportunity for practical
atonement that it brought with it. Some years ago
a half-caste who was about to be dealt with in a
northern gaol asked the governor if a few of his
lady friends could be present at the ceremony, and
was gi ievously disappointed when the request was
turned down.
**, * *
“FY7” : “Mrs. Lance Rawson’s” storv (B
16/2/’22) of the young Australian* who
arrived at midnight in the midst of a cargo
of digger deck-passengers reminds me of
another who in the early ’nineties made his
appearance one blazing midday on the long
stretch of open downs between Surat and
St. George (Q.). The lady in the case was
the only passenger on Cobb and Co.’s big
coach bound to Surat, and Dave Tees, now
dead, was driving. Finding that there was
no time to be wasted, he pulled up and acted
as accoucheur, then drove his patients into
Surat, where both did him every credit.
Dave has told me the yarn many a time as
we passed the spot, and always reckoned
it was the right sort of birth for a true-
blue blanky Australian.

“Jobber”: The Heads were stuck for a
quarter-guard, so turned out a few of the
Methusaliers who had come over with the
horses. One grizzled old pot was doing his
turn, when about 17 brass-hats rode up.
Old Bill didn’t turn a hair, but leaned
against the rail and watched. The Tommy
officahs developed apoplexy, and as soon as
one was able to speak he breasted Bill and
proceeded to roar him up. “How long have
you been a soldier? Don’t you know”
But here the old man chipped in with a
perfectly friendly drawl: “I know this, son ;
yous are all ridin’ good sorts of ’orses.” It
broke the brass-hat up. “It’s no good,” he
gasped. “These Australians will never bf
disciplined.”

“Gouger” on a Digger’s foursome: —
We had been on Gallipoli a fortnight when four
mates in my. regiment decided that the chances of a
man seeing Australia again was one in four. So they
arranged that none of them was to touch his. deferred
pay and that the survivor on reaching Australia
was to receive the lot. Two days later a Jacko bomb
claimed the first. In the following month two of
the others were wounded ; but they played the game,
and were back in the line before their wouhds were
thoroughly cured. The fourth was then badly
gashed by a shell splinter. He was sent away to
hospital, but was returned to Anzac Cove two days
before the general evacuation, and had hardly set
foot of the beach before a shell from Beacfiy Bill
sent him west. Months later a spray of machine-
gun bullets registered the third man beneath the
date palms of El Quatia. That left only one, who
was now entitled to collect. Fate gave him his
RESOURCE.
FAMILIAR MALE : “Er — er—how d’you do?
Didn’t I meet you at Portsea last year?”
HAUGHTY SHE: “No, I wasn’t there.”
FAMILIAR MALE : "What a coincidence!
Neither was I!”
chance, for a bomb-dropping taube wounded him
again at Bir el Abd, and on coming out of hospital
he was offered a cushy guard job. But he refused
to take it, and fell at last within sight of Jerusalem,
sniped by a miserable Arab. So Death won the
wager thumbs down.

WHEN IT COMES HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love to see the handsome • dames
Cavorting in the sea
In costume that the Grundies shames,
Far short of neck to knee.
A woman never looks so fine
As when she’s dripping from the brine.
My neighbors’ wives are tall and fair,
Or short and dark are they.
No matter what complexion, they’re
Delightful in their way,
And some of them compare quite well
With Venus rising from the swell.
My wife delights to feel the cool,
Sweet Ocean’s fond caress....
I s’pose I’m something of a fool
But this I like much less.
In fact, I loathe to see her there —
She is most shapely and most fair!

“Moe”: New Guinea has had some strange
characters, but about the oddest was one
who, until a year or so ago, lived at the
hack of Humboldt Bay, where he was the
fully-accredited headman of the largest native
village. He was a full-blooded Chinaman and
landed there 20 years ago, the sole survivor of
the crew of a wrecked schooner. For some
reason or another the nigs, didn’t kai-kai
him, and he soon settled down to a peaceful
existence. Some years afterwards he became
boss of the community, and held the job un-
challenged. White men who passed his
way were always sure of a hearty reception
and in the latter years of his reign he carried
on a thriving business in paradise-bird
plumes, which his faithful subjects collected
for him. Blackwater fever finally got him,
and when he passed out the nigs, seemed
really to mourn for him.

Note from a friend of the family:—
Sydney possesses a wholesome-faced woman who
has the most strangely-assorted family—can I say
in the world? She has spent a lifetime collecting
children, and, incidentaJly, husbands. Originally
a nurse, she married a widower who in two years
died, leaving on her hands a baby of her own and
two children by his first wife. To keep them she
returned to nursing, and, one of her patients dying
in childbirth, she agreed to look after the widower’s
three children. In due course she became their step-
mother, and by the time she had two more chil-
dren of her own she found herself again a widow.
To maintain the orphanage that was on her hands
she went back to nursing again. Her third husband
was likewise a widower with children; but as he
had previously married a widow with a child, two
fresh assortments were delivered into the family.
Nineteen young men and women now affectionately
call her “Mother.” Eight of them are her own, but
by three different husbands; the rest have ’four
different parentages.
MY, HOW THEY HAD MISSED HER!
“Now. tell me all the scandal there's been
while I’ve been away."
“There has been none, dear."
“Yarrum” : How’s this for luck, or some-
thing? A few years ago a couple of settle-
ments in the Yass district (N.S.W.)
clamored for a decent road, but the heavy
timber and a light purse made the council-
lors shy at it. Then Providence took a
hand, and one night a mighty wind storm,
curiously local, felled the timber on a chain-
wide track clean through the bush. The
council did the rest at little cost.
“Copabella”: Reference is made by Zora
Cross (B. 2/2./’22) to the ancient Bush
legend of the Trotting Cob, a household
word i n Riverina,
sharing shuddersome
fame with the Cooee-
ing Woman. I, how-
ever, have met the
Trotting Cob in the
flesh. She followed
Victorian navvy
camps for years.
Though only about
4ft. 6in. tall and
weighing some 1001 b.,
she had a “way wid
’er” which made her
a dominating person-
ality in and out of
camp, and the biggest
buck navvy wilted
before her. I was
running a store along
a construction track
at the time, and she
once made hash, with
a snatched-up slasher,
of several shelves of
bottled goods, her
grievance a delicate
matter of refused
credit; another time,
refused credit by the
driver of a delivery
waggon, she laid him
out with one of his
own bottles of sauce,
and took what she
wanted. Visioned o’-
night in a lonely
camp, with the cur-
lews wailing and din-
goes howling in the
nearer hills, the Trot-
ting Cob of the bush-
man’s story was bad
enough ; I think, how-
ever, she of the camps
was as awesome—and far more destructive
when aroused.

“Coot”: The now delicensed Adam and
Eve hotel, at the rear of which is the
notorious Gun Alley, is one of the oldest
pub buildings in Melbourne. In 1542 its
licensee was one James Liddy, who in a
little garden on the present site of Gun Alley
raised probably the first head of cabbage
grown in* Melbourne. It was a worthy
vegetable, for it is recorded that it taped
sft. Bin. round the waist.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.”: The demolitions in Castle-
reagh-street to make way for the new
Government Savings Bank have exposed
an old building—very
old as buildings go in
Sydney. Back in the
’thirties the place was
put up by a merchant,
one Pittman, a name
now forgotten and to
be found only in the
books of the old legal
firm of Norton and
Co. Through this
firm Pittman con-
veyed the dwelling to
Captain Lamb, R.N.,
who made it his town
residence for many
years. Lamb sold it
to William Foster,
the barrister, who
shared the Bar prac-
tice with Wentworth,
Wardell and Broad-
hurst. Foster con-
veyed the property to
Fisher, son-in-law of
Wentworth, who in
turn sold to Dan
Egan. The latter
lived in a brick-and-
wood house on the
south side, the site
now being prepared
for the Savings Bank.
Egan was an M.L.A.
and P.M.G. in the
Robertson - 0 o wp e r
Ministry 1868-70: he
had been Mayor of
Sydney in 1853. In
the ’sixties the build-
ing became the Vic-
toria Club House,
after which the
Auditor-Ge ne r a l got possession of it for his
staff. When these removed to Bligh-street
the old Pittman house was let out in offices
to solicitors and others, a new front making
it flush with the street alignment.
“Three Stripes”: The sheepskin-vest coin-
cidence mentioned by “G.S” (B. 2/2/’22) re-
minds me. In 1915, when “billies” in
scores of thousands were being sent to the
Front, I enclosed in the one packed in our
house a note of good wishes, and
added, “If by any remote possibility
you should happen to meet my son,
GOLDEN LOCKS.
KITTY : “ What would you give to have hair
like mine?”
KATTY : “Oh, I don’t know; what did YOU
give, darling?"
Captain Blank, tell him your billy came
from liis people in Vic.” Shortly afterwards
my son wrote: “While I was supervising the
distribution of Christmas billies to my lot,
one of them approached me with your letter
in his hand, and grateful words on his lips.”
Our boy also sleeps “somewhere in France,”
but, to our great sorrow, in an unknown
grave.

Edward Dyson meets a brother bard:—*
that story of the peripatetic painter in water-
colors who disdained manual toil reminds me of the
poet laureate of Port Melbourne, a new appearance
among the stars above the local literary horizon.
He writes poems about local subjects (his master-
piece is a blood-stirring, hair-lifting description of
the Gun Alley tragedy) in the Masefield manner.
He told me he was the best Victorian poet. “Why
don’t you contribute to the press?” I asked. He
smiled disdainfully. “Because I ain’t sich a fool,’’
he replied. “I can make five bob a day hawkin’
ihe own pomes. Where’s the newspaper pote who
can do that?” Where, indeed?
“Will Lawson”: A monster whale is
stranded on one of the beaches of the old
whaling harbor of Porirua (M.L.), now only
used as a holiday resort, the earthquakes of
the fifties having lifted the sea-bottom
several feet. The whale, which is very dead,
is within a stone’s-throw of the Paremata
railway station, and the question of its
removal has- become acute. It was even
discussed in Parliament, where the Premier
airily undertook that the member for the
district should make an investigation during
the recess and report next session. Mean-
time the Marine Department and the County
Council are debating whether the whale is on
the land or in the sea, and each is urging the
other to remove the carcase. And while thev
argue the village of Paremata has become
what Zora Cross might call “a lyric vale of
violet sound.”
* * * *
“Alfred Gale’s” two sea-pictures:—
Years ago I was in a Sydney-owned ship bound
for Shanghai, coal-laden, with all sail set, when she
was suddenly struck by a heavy squall. The captain
ordered the helm hard up, but the ship was laying
over so much that she would not answer. The lee
rail was buried in bubbling foam, and it looked as if
the vessel would capsize any minute. Then the
order was snapped out: “Cut away the fore and
main sheets.” At the call, out came half-a-dozen
sheath-knives, and into the raging torrent to leeward
went two of the men. Holding on to the ringbolts
in the stanchions, and partly held by their mates,
they cut the ropes, and the ship, relieved of the
pressure of the wind in her two largest sails, slowly
righted; but the mainsail and foresail were torn to
ribbons before they could be clewed up.
Not so long ago I was on an inter-State steamer
when it was necessary to run a line ashore to heave
the vessel into a wharf. The quarter-boat was
ordered out, but the lanyard that confined the gripes
(i.e., strong pieces of rope and canvas sewn together
and passed round the boat to keep it steadv j n the
davits) had jambed. “Cut it,” said the officer in
charge of the three men on the job, and— not one
of those sailor-men had a knife, and they all said
so without a blush! The officer handed one his
pocket-knife, but at the first slash the blade broke
The old cook saved the situation with his gallev-
knife. “I say, boys, this wouldn’t do on a lee
shore; and,” he grinned, “have you all forgotten
what a sailor without a knife is like?”
“Pliilosophe”: Man has really to be edu-
cated into an appreciation of -comiort.
“Nitric” (B. 5/1/21:) found the wire mat-'
tresses in a coastal vessel in the Brisbane
Kiver covered with boards, Sailor Jack being
unable to sleep on the derned new-fangled
things. I know of a case where Europeans
fitted up a large hospital with such beds in
a famine-stricken Chinese town, and the
patients were found every morning sleeping
on the floor under the cots.
* * * *
“Domas”: “Hayband’s” reference to curi-
ous pub-names (B. 2(i/l/’22) recalls the
Seven Angels, so named because it was run
by a woman with seven good-looking daugh-
ters who were said to play cards and billiards
better than any man in the district. This
hotel was in a small mining town a few
miles from Maryborough (Vic.), and what
makes it remain very vividly in my mind is
that in 1876 I lived in the locality as a
young bride, and I only saw my husband
occasionally during the week, as he spoilt,
most of his time playing cards and billiards
with these girls—all the men, married and
single, did the same.
* * * #
“Hamer”: In my family there was a case
of mental telepathy on all fours with that
incidentally quoted by “S.S.S.” (B. 9/2/’22).
Captain Henry Mercer, in charge of the
Armstrong battery in the M.L. war, was
fatally wounded while leading a forlorn hope
at Rangiriri, his jaw being shattered. His
brother was in Quebec (Canada) at the
time, and woke up one night declaring that
he had seen his brother standing beside him
with a look of appeal in his eyes, and the
lower part of his face a mass of blood. An
unusually strong feeling had existed between
the brothers, and when Captain Mercer was
dying he had scribbled on a slip of paper—
he was unable to speak—a message for the
man in Canada, asking him to watch the
interests of his children.
“G.”: Through the death of Mrs. Bree, of
Hamilton (Vic.), who was the eldest daugh-
ter of the original Stephen Georsre Henty, of
Portland, a letter of thanks, written in the
form of a scroll, has come into the possession
of Wilfred Henty, eldest grandson of
Stephen George. The scroll—which unfor-
tunately has been rat-nibbled—was written
by the owners of the Admela, which was
wrecked between Portland and South Aus.
in the early days. The crew was rescued
by whale-boats sent out from Portland, at
that time simply a whaling station owned
by the Hentys. The name “Admela” is
made up of the two first letters of Adelaide,
Melbourne and Launceston, the ports be-
MISUNDERSTOOD.
MR. FLUR: “Absolutely no danger on this
beach. You may swim with perfect
safety as far as you can see.”
MISS TIMID: “What! Do you mean to tell
me those are safe breakers out there?”
MR. FLUB : “Safe breakers? Oh, dash it, no.
That's Percy Wilcox, our Mayor, and
the other's the bank manager!”
tween which she traded. Gordon’s “Ride
from the Wreck” was founded on the loss
of the Admela. After the Ilentys crossed
from the Speck their intention was to devote
themselves wholly to the whaling business,
but on the whales deciding to quit they
turned their attention to the land.

And Springtime too 1
It was too bad....
Well, I’ll tell you.
She....and I—
We.... 1 ....you see.
A moonlit sky ;
And she loved me.
Why should she weep?
Something was wrong
To cruelly keep
Our hearts from song.
I asked the sea
To sparkle more:
It splashed in glee
And kissed the shore.
I tried a tree.
“My love,” I said—
Her name’s Julie....
it shook its head.
I asked a star
A slight request:
It shone afar
And did its best.
But all in vain ;
For still she sighed.
I tried again.
“Moon, moon,” I cried.
And she was gay,
And all was well.
Moon knew the way
To break the spell.

O tired head, bowed!
Dear moon, to slip
Behind a cloud !

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Dook”: If “Gecko” (B. 2/2/’22) wants
to see the platypus in all its glory he should come
down here (Jamberoo, S. Coast, N.S.W.). The creeks
are swarming with them. The first indication you
have of a platypus rising is a large bubble, just as
though oil was welling up through the water; then
the bill and the top of the back emerge at the one
time. Often, though, the only sign that one has
come to the surface is a series of concentric ripples
spreading over the water as if someone had dropped
a pebble in. But, quietly as it emerges, the platy-
pus generally disappears with a resounding “plonk”
that scares all the perch for hours afterwards. I
have never yet seen one in brackish water.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Kangaroos are now so plen-
tiful in parts of S. Aus. as to be a pest. They are
not supposed to be found in wheat country, but the
recent spread of farm areas brings the two together.
Chief Secretary Bice has made public a police report
from Cummins, where 50 ’roos had been seen in a 100-
acre crop, had “eaten 30 acres right out as though
a mower had gone over it,” and damaged the rest.
The policeman reckoned the farmer would get a
three-bushel crop instead of the 15 bushels it looked
like in the spring; yet he had to enforce the Act
which protects the “vermin” from the beginning of
October to the end of March.
“Jim Carew”: I’m sorry to throw doubts
on “Mellish Reef’s” yarn (B. 2/2/’22) re the Rossel
islanders eating a cargo of Chinks, but there is a
good deal of uncertainty about it. The Rossel
islanders have never yet been proved cannibals, and
are an exceptionally unwarlike croM'd. I have
visited the Louisiade group four times on trading
expeditions, and while the natives will still talk of
the time the St. Paul was wrecked, there is never
any mention of the passengers having been turned
into “long pig.”
“Ophis”: A strange bird I’ve noticed
about Sydney puzzled me for a while. Its crest, like
that of the bellbird, goes to a very sharp point and
is black, like the head. The body is brown above
and white below, and there is a patch of crimson
feathers under the tail and just behind the eye. The
stranger is the Indian bulbul, which has got a start
in this country through a pair escaping from cap-
tivity near Sydney a few years ago. Its food con-
sists of insects and (unfortunately) fruit.
* * * *
“Jaekeroo”: Two women were recently
reported passing through Charleville (Q.) humping
matilda. Which reminds me of a swagman I once
met in the West who led a double life. Occasionally
he presented himself at a cottage on the roadside
dressed as a woman- —a stunt that never failed to get
his tucker-bag filled.
“P.C.”: I came across an old goat the
other day whose four legs were badly smashed, the
stumps protruding through the skin. His tracks led
back half-a-mile to a fallen limb. He was making
towards a dam and still had about a quarter of a
mile to go when I found him. His journey must
have been an appalling torture, and the spirit which
enabled him to get so far raised all goats in my
estimation. I gave the poor devil a drink, and then
put him out of his misery.
“Garfish”: On Jan. 30. at Woody Point,
Moreton Bay (Q.), I witnessed the capture of a 121 b.
lady shark. When opened she yielded 32 young
uns, ranging from 2ft. to 2ft. 6in., and as vigorous
as any old fish. Some of the local experts maintain
that the parent fish had come into shallow water to
throw her young, others were emphatic that the shark-
lets had been born some time previously, and that
they went in and out of ma’s mouth at will. If so,
goodness knows how many nippers never got back
to home and mother when she took the fatal bite.
* * * *
“Monaro”: While I don’t doubt “Rifle
Shot’s” statement (B. 2/2/’22) re the perforation
of the bull practically without sights, I can’t
explain how it is done. But a good marksman
often takes little notice of the sights. tfhe best
shot I’ve seen was an aboriginal monarch at Goondi-
windi (Q.), and with him the elevation of the gun
and the flash were almost simultaneous—no time for
sighting. At that, the gun was an ancient affair
plentifully bound with wire.
* * * *
“Te W.”: Excepting certain sea-fowl, such
as penguins, the only Australian birds which are
credited with a single egg are the lyre-birds
(three species) and the white-throated and
spotted night-jars, or night-hawks. The bustard
(wild or plains turkey) usually lays only one
egg, but sometimes it manages two. When this
bird bred each summer on the Monaro (N.S.W.)
plains I occasionally, but rarely, surprised one
with two chicks in attendance. Both lyre-birds
and night-jars are comparatively scarce, owing
no doubt to their scanty means of reproduction.
Yet the bustard, though practically a one-egg
layer, was plentiful prior to the advent of the
fox and the systematic spreading of rabbit
poison.
“Ross”: Two farmers in the midlands of
the Speck had a test as to which could kill, skin
and dress a sheep the quicker. The winner’s time
was lmin. 30sec., which is considered a record.
Is it?
“Bill R.” : “Alex” (B. 2/2/’22) has
not found the only canine cannibal. A Monaro
(N.S.W.) boundary-rider once owned a pedigreed
bitch by Olune, an imported Scotch collie. Among
sheepmen he had standing offers of a tenner apiece
for her pups, but every time she scoffed the lot
before their eyes were open. “Too close inbreeding,”
was the verdict of a vet.
CAN’T HELP GETTING RICH THERE.
“Struth! Sydney's the place for me! Thrippeny beers! More yer drink more yer save!”
“Wick”: Hefty families, is it? I nomi-
nate my S*. Aus. greyhound bitch. She has presented
us with 42 pups in her first three litters, and is still
too good for the foxes hereabouts.
* * * *
“Jobber”: I’ve never been bitten by a
snake. I can’t say whether “Howitzer” (B. 2/2/’22)
and “Veronal” was right about the trouble recurring.
But I was severely, knocked by Jacko, and again by
Fritz, and on the anniversary of each crack, the day,
not to mention the night, is anything but pleasant.- I
get queer spasms which I don’t feel at other times ;
and if I live to be an old man I shall never forget the
first anniversary of the second issue. My mate thought
I was going through the tent roof.
* * * *
“G.8.N.”: Tell “Tamac” (B. 2/2/’22) I
have a self-sown sunflower 13ft. high and 7sin.
round the butt. It has now 55 full-blown flowers,
none more than 7 inches in diameter and none less
than sin., and there are over 50 buds still to open.
The whole plant is quite as bushy as an ordinary
young gumtree.
NO GOOD TO GUNDAGAI!
BUNNY BILL ( buying cups and saucers ):
“Call that a saucer? Why, it wouldn't
'old ’arf a cup er tea!"
“D.D.”: “Delhi” (B. 9/2/’22) asks for
a tip for getting rid of ants. Powdered borax and
sugar mixed m equal quantities, moistened with
cold water, and left about the dwelling in open
containers will kill them in thousands. Reinforee-
ments will arrive but in a day or two the invaders
Mill gne it best. I have successfully tried this
many tiroes in town and country.
“Spes”: Re trouble from snakebite re-
curring (B. 12/l/’22). A small fox-terrier of my
acquaintance was bitten by a black snake in Novem-
ber, 1917, but pulled round. Each November since
he has suffered severely from fits, which occur for
about a fortnight and then cease.
“Hunter”: Tell “Morob” (B. 26/l/’2?
that a platypus I got had a duct in each spur lead-
ing to a gland at the base filled with an amber-
colored fluid which the animal could force out of
the point of the spur at will. After a gland had
been opened and exposed .to the sun the fluid
(poisonous or otherwise) dried into dark amber crys-
tals. I don’t want to part for good with the spur I
have, but I would lend it to any authority if it
would help to settle the argument.
“Johanna”: “McNorth” (B. 26/1/’°
thinks tobacco is not grown near the Papuan coast.
At Rabaul, following the two long coast roads of New
Britain, there are plots carefully cultivated by natives
who have an original way of curing the "weed. I
have seen dozens of boys wearing necklaces of green-
tobacco leaves, threaded on strings of coeoanut fibre.
Thus exposed the leaves dry, and no doubt the curing
process is helped by the oil from the nigs.’ bodies.
The boys are incessant smokers, and scraps of news-
paper begged from the baas serve for the rough cigar-
ettes they roll. But they don’t like The Bulletin.
“Too much thick pape that fella.”
* * *
“HecaguS”: Some time ago an angler
fishing off Marble Island (Q.) landed an lift. 9in.
shark. Its abnormal girth (Bft.) caused a stir, as
a boat’s crew was missing, so the lawyer was dis-
sected. Packed closely head-to-tail (sardine
fashion) were 44 baby sharks, each about 2ft. 3in.
long. The litter must have been on the verge of
deliverance, for when one was thrown into the sea it
promptly swam off. Will some marine specialist tell
us whether the head-to-tail packing is usual ?
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Casual visitors to the Straits
generally inquire for the canaries when they hear
a “chirp-chirp” coming from some unrevealed source.
The musician, though, is not a canary, but a small
lizard about 4 or 5 inches long, which elambers
about the walls and ceiling in its search for flies.
Frequently two or three, doing a Marathon wrong-way
up on the ceiling, will flop down on the luncheon-
table; but they’re perfectly harmless, and great
company when they get their full orchestra going.

WHY?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australian sunshine is pure gold,
Australian winds are ivine;
Australian trees grow tall and bold
Beneath a blue divine;
Why should we sentimentalise
On dreamy blue Kentucky skies?
From Cairns to Perth, from Eucla town
Across to Chillagoe,
Our stalwart men go up and down
With quiet eyes aglow,
And slow they weave, but steadfastly,
A mighty nation’s destiny.
Sun-bronzed their skin and strong their arms,
Sparing their speech and terse;
They feel their country’s lyric charms,
With love that throbs like verse;
But if they part their lips they sing
Of O —hi —o or Wy—o—ming.
In Carpentaria or Broome
Men ache for Sydney quays;
And cooped in town, in homesick gloom,
They dream of wattle-trees;
And so in song they sigh to be
Back Home in Dear Old Tennessee.

But sing of Coal-black Mammies dear.

I’ve nothing else to sing about.

“Bill Bowyang”: So far as I am aware
only one white man in Aus-
tralia was compelled to under-
go the terrible Abo. rite by
which the power of begetting
children is destroyed. This
was Narcisse Pellatier, the
young Frenchman who was
deserted by his shipwrecked
companions at Cape Direction
(N.Q.) in 1858, and lived
with the blacks for (7 years,
when he was rescued by the
crew of a pearling schooner.
Pellatier, who was only 16
years of age when he was
found by the natives, was a
handsome youth who attracted
the attention of the dusky
flappers in the tribe, and this
probably aroused the jealousy
of the old men and caused
them to authorise the carrying
out of the operation. Pellatier
returned to France shortly
after he was brought to Syd-
ney, but did not stay long in
his native land, and two
3‘ears later he was again seen
with the Cape Direction
blacks.


Is Business Heartless and Cruel?
Why are six £6OO men cut off?
Why not one £4OOO man instead ?
®s&|sf N companies all over Australia pay-
rolls are being scrutinised. And
time after time this happens: —
A £3OO man, a £4OO man and a
£3OO man will be eliminated —a
saving of £ 1 200. A larger saving could have
been made by eliminating one £l5OO man;
but the £l5OO man is kept.
Or six £6OO men go out; but the £4OOO
man remains.
What is the explanation? Is business
essentially cruel? Why should it visit its
misfortunes on the many who are least able
to bear it, instead of on the few who have
prospered most ?
The answer is twofold. The £l5OO and
£4OOO men are kept, first, because it would
be difficult to replace them when business
picks up again.
And, second, because such men under-
stand and can perform—in a pinch—the duties
of all their departmental subordinates. But
the departmental man knows his own depart-
ment, and is useless anywhere else.
TO LIFT MEN OVER THE DEAD-LINE.
Through the centre of every pay-roll a
dead-line runs. Below it are the specialised
men who can do one thing and one thing only.
Above it are managers, superintendents,
treasurers, directors and managing-directors.
They know enough about the fundamentals
of sales to direct salesmen; enough about
costs, accounting, factory and office manage-
ment, advertising and corporation finance to
be effective in any one of these departments.
Such men are rare; no company can afford
to spare them. For, with them as a nucleus
it can, at any time, fill in the departmental
positions in its business, and expand its
activities again. Without them it is lost.
It was to train men of this character that
the Alexander Hamilton Institute was formed
eleven years ago by a group of business leaders.
Of the thousands of men who have enrolled
for its Modern Business Course and Service,
24,054 are managing directors, 5738
directors, 8932 secretaries, 19,502 managers,
4276 sales managers.
These men have business worries, as all
men do; but the worry of losing their jobs is
not one of them. In good times or bad they
must be retained; they are the real essentials.
PRACTICAL TRAINING THAT HAS
PROVED ITS POWER.
In the past eleven years 155,000 men
decided to get the training for which the
demand always outruns the supply; they
have enrolled themselves in the Alexander
Hamilton Institute’s Modern Business Course
and Service.
The Institute has only one Course. Its
purpose is to take a man who has made a start
in business —he may be a salesman or auditor,
a superintendent or manager or engineer—-
and, by leading him successively through all
the different departments of modern business,
train him to direct the work of other men.
The divisions of this Course that treat of
sales and credits, accounting and merchandis-
ing, advertising, factory and office manage-
ment, finance —and all the rest are each the
work of experts. They give, in systematic*
pleasant reading, the best knowledge and
practice of the most successful business men.
They teach fundamental principles whose
application is universal —to every business
and in every country.
By serving years in each of these depart-
ments the average man could, if he chose,
gain this training by practical experience.
It’s the business of the Institute to save
these wasted years; to provide a more direct
path to success
THE JOY OF SUCCEEDING WHILE
. YOU ARE YOUNG.
If you have studied its advertising you
have been impressed with the fact that the
Alexander Hamilton Institute studiously
avoids exaggerated claims. It cannot double
men’s incomes over night nor transform
failures into successes in a month. But it can
and does do this: It eliminates the years that
too many men spend in going from one routine
departmental job to another. It does shorten
the path to success; and affords men the joy
of succeeding while they are still young.
Hundreds of its men reached positions
before thirty-five which would ordinarily have
come to them only at fifty or later. What the
Institute has done for such men it can and
will do for you.
“FORGING AHEAD IN BUSINESS”

facts about the Modern Business Course and
Service. They are published in a 1 16-page

“Battle-axe” : That 21ft. carpet-snake (B.
26/1/ 22) at Macknade Mill (N.Q.) was caught by
Arthur Buhler and photographed by Sid French. He
was so far from death that it took about 15 men all
their time to hole) him while Sid squeezed the bulb.
The poor devil went west through some idiot dropping
a lighted candle into his sleeping quarters.

“Wee Bobbie”: There are many ways of
dying, and here’s another to add to the list. A
native of Choiseul (Solomon Islands), fishing
on the reef, was lately struck by a fish of the garfish
species, long snouted and carrying teeth that make
one creep to look at them. In the islands we call
these fish “long toms.” In pursuit of their prey—
and they always seem to be pursuing something or
other—they shoot from the water like an arrow and
cover wonderful distances at a jump. The Kanaka
happened to be in line, and the hard spiky snout
entered his breast like a spear. The fish was buried
half its length in his bosom. He died within a few
hours.
* * * »
“Gouger”: A dog up. here (N.Q.) de-
veloped a fondness for the ripe mangoes that fall off
the trees. The other day he died. Suspecting
poison, the owner held a post-mortem. Inside he
found one of the large, flat mango seeds putting forth
energetic shoots.
*.* * *
“Vero”: Among Francis Birtles’s interest-
ing “discoveries” is the mysterious “carpenter-bird”
of Cape York (Q.), which from its photographic like-
ness proved to be the dollar-bird, or Pacific roller,
common along the north and south-eastern coasts of
Australia. The large white rounded spot on this
bird’s wings render ,jt easily distinguishable. Its
peculiar, harsh, creaking note certainly does recall ,
the sounds which emanate from the carpenter’s bench,
but the bird itself is. a very old friend. Like most
gaily-plumaged birds the dollar-marked chap’s missus
lays a plain white egg, and the hollow of a tree serves
as the incubator. It is noteworthy that most birds
which breed in semi-darkness have white eggs—-ap-
parently so that the fowl may be able to see them
in the gloom.
MORE POLICE INTERFERENCE.
THE JUDGE: “Have you anything to say?”
THE ACCUSED: “Y'r Honor, the las' time I
was here you said you would give me
another chance, an' I was takin' it when
the 'ops interfered.”
“599”: “J.E.G.’s” friend (B. 2/2/’22)
should try cylinder oil for the itch in his mare’s
tail. A marine-engineer friend of mine cured the
same complaint in his pony mare with a couple of
liberal dressings of it. He allowed about a week’s
interval between the applications.
“Dai R.”: How many creeks are there
in Australia that have never failed? For the pre-
miership I nominate Wollombi Creek (N.S.W.).
Within the memory of the oldest inhabitant it
never ceased to flow. In the last drought it was
hard put to it, and settlers who depended upon it
for their water were beginning to see mortgagees in
their sleep; but it continued gallantly to gurgle
over its bed till the break came. It has a couple
of hill springs to feed it, but many apparently
better-fed streams jibbed towards the close of that
drought.
CETTING EVEN WITH HER.
INSURANCE AGENT NUISANCE (persisting) :

THE MADAM: “No, thunk you. But I DO
wish you'd cull on our next-door neigh-
bor; she ployed a wry dirty trick On
mo the other day."
“Veronal” : What “J.L.” (B. 26/l/’22) says
of the mallee-hen, or mallee-fowl
(Leipna ocellata) is no doubt all
0.K., but the jungle-fowl (Mega-
podius tumulus), to which I re-
ferred, differs from the leipoa
both in architectural and certain
other domestic matters. Gould
(in, [ think, his “Handbook to
the Birds »of Australia”) figures
a mound of M. tumulus , ajid it is
of considerable height and appears
to have a fairly deep hbllow in
the middle. The megapodes (which
include the talegalla, or brush-
turkey) embrace several species,
ranging as far as the Philippines,
where the first example of this
peculiar order of birds was dis-
covered about a.d. 1521. Latham,
who described many Australian
birds at the end of 1700, chris-
tened the brush-turkey “New Hol-
land vulture,” which is on a par
with his name for the gillbird,
viz., “wattled bee-eater.” The
lyrebird (Menura superba) was
placed by Swainson in the order
Megapodidat,- or “great foots,”
but is now. sorted out into an
order of its own—the Menuridai.
It is remarkable that the mega-
podes retain the primeval habit,
common to most reptiles, of
allowing the sun to hatch their
eggs. But the diamond-snake
(for instance) coils affectionately
around its soft-shelled cargo, and
gives the sun a helping hand in
bringing the snakelets into the
world.
“Ophis”: Touching the argument about
carpet-snakes and rock-pythons (8.. 19/l/’22). The
carpet-snake (Python spilotes ) does not grow larger
than 12ft.; in fact, a 10-footer is unusual. On the
other hand, the rock-python of Queensland ( Python
amethystinus) grows up to 22ft. I have seen a cast
of one measuring 17ft. 4in., and I know of one in
the Brisbane Museum which is close on 22ft. “Gum-
digger’s” 10ft. Bin. tiger-snake is undoubtedly a
record. The largest wrigglers of the world are the
anaconda and the reticulated python, inhabiting S.
America and India respectively. They each grow to
30ft.
“Werrimee”: At one time the teamster’s
bunk was underneath his waggon; now it is always
slung behind. The change followed a tragedy in
the carrying days between the New England table-
land (N.S.W.) and the coast. A loaded waggon
was halted one wet evening on a low ridge. During
the night the wheels sunk to the naves in the
softened soil. They dug out a dead teamster in the
morning.
* * * *
“Te Whare”: Australia has its cassowary
(Casuarius australis ), but the gaudy-necked fowl
is confined to N. Queensland and N. Territory. The
late T. S. Wall got a
specimen in 1854, but
it was lost, and, as far
as any records I can
discover show, it was
not until 1866 that
another example was
caiight. This casso-
wary is attired in
coarse but glossy
bristle-like plumage,
and his neck caruncles
are bright red, yellow
and blue. In place of
wings the bird has
only a few stiff quills.
Another cassowary, the
moorulc (Casuarius ben-
nettii) inhabits New
Britain, whence the
late Dr. George Ben-
nett, of Sydney, got a
specimen in 1857 and
kept it for some time
in captivity with his
emu, which, he records,
used to eat tin-tacks
with avidity. The emu
is a near relation of
the cassowaries, and it
is said the natives of
the island of Ceram
called their cassowary
“e m e u,” o r “ema,”
which name has since
been commandeered for
our tin-tack gourmand.
Latham went so far as
to name the Ceram
cassowary Casuarius
emeu, but his termin-
ology doesn’t always stand at the present day.
“Lucius”: Has “Te Whare” and others
who are keeping their eyes on the cuckoo heard of
Edward Chance’s investigations in England ? He is
a Midlands managing director, and in his spare
moments has stalked the cuckoo, and now claims
to have discovered and filmed its egg-laying secret,
which has puzzled naturalists for centuries. His
yarn:—•
I made an entirely new discovery—that while most
birds lay one egg a day, in the morning, the cuckoo
lays one egg in two days, in the afternoon. I
reasoned first that the time of the cuckoo’s laying
must regulated by the, time of the laying of the
foster-bird. My next step wks to find where every
foster-bird’s nest was in the cuckoo’s district- In
this way I discovered the limit of the cuckoo’s natural
laying capacity, for —and I can
prove it-—the only time a cuckoo
lays in a nest other than that of
one of her usual species of foster-
bird is when her calculations
have been upset with regard tc
their nesting. Everything de-
pended on regular nesting, which
led me a step further. By taking
away the nest of a foster-bird (in
this case a meadow-pipit' or tit-
lark) I increased the number of
nests for the cuckoo to lay in,
for, by experimenting, I found
that the meadow-pipit will rebuild
up to five times when her nests
are disturbed. Eventually by
thus regulating the re-building
of meadow-pipits’ nests I was
able to regulate the laying of
the cuckoo, and by arranging the
succession so that the one
meadow-pipit’s nest next ready
was as far as possible away from
its predecessor I was able, with
my knowledge that the cuckoo
lays every 48 hours at a mote or
less certain time in the after-
noon, and by observing where she
perched, to forecast almost exactly
when and where she would next
lay. Thus I was able to bring
a cinematographer to the spot
at a day’s notice and record the whole proceeding.
“Eddyson”: Kelso was very interested in
one leg of a set of timber on the bottom level of
the Horseshoe at Yam. He let no other perceive his
concern, but he never passed that stout upright
without giving it a thought. Often miners have
a premonition of evil with regard to one special
bit of timbering, but Kelso’s feelings towards this
log were rather fond than otherwise, and when the
shift boss discovered a split in the upper end of
the leg and ordered anew one to be put in, the
faceman was deeply agitated, and watched the work
with eager eyes. The old log was sent up and Kelso’s
mind followed it with emotion. What could become
of it ? Was he to be parted from it for ever after
all these months? Possibly, if he asked for the
log on the plea of wanting it for a gatepost, Glas-
son would let him have it. Yet there would be risk
in asking. There would be risk in showing any
interest at all. The following day, by questioning
the stoker in a casual way, Kelso learned that
the piece of timber had gone into the firebox. Sud-
denly his interest attached to the ash-heap. If hi
a£s n °R f 6t T log , he WOuld be content with its
ashes Before he could formulate a plan, however,
he discoveied that Palmer had obtained the man-
agers consent, and had carted away a couple of
1 ds ° f ./ sh to make a ola >' door. Being on after-
noon shift, Kelso spent an hour the next day lazily
watching Palmer mix the ash with the clay, and
spread the composition on the floor of his barn; and
still the yearning to recover the remains of the old
log no matter in what form, possessed his soul
with a longing that kept him awake, scheming. Then
one night when Palmer and his wife were in Ballarat
and Tom the rouseabout was on the spree, Kelso got
in his good work. When Palmer returned he dis-
covered that every inch of the fine, hard clay had
been stripped from his barn floor, and the mystery
of it amazed him, as it did all Yam. Asa matter
of fact, Kelso had discovered an empty knot-hole in
that log, and had made a cunning cap of clay, dis-
guised with strips of hark, and into the hollow
had dropped every scrap of gold he had laid hands
on in the course of 17 months at the Horseshoe, his
idea being that some day when the mine was worked
out he would get down the ladder shaft and draw
the deposit. The ashes yielded 870 z., and then in
an auger hole in another log Kelso opened anew
account. For though searchers are assiduous love will
find a way.'

“Opliis”; “Hecagus” (B. 5/l/’22) wants
to know if eel-eating is anew habit of the black
snake. It is not. I have shot one which had an
eel inside, another which was digesting an ee) and
a small fish, and yet another with 12 complete and
several half-assimilated frogs in its dining-room.
Black snakes, which spend a lot of their time in
the water, seem to relish cold-blooded creatures as
an article of diet. The late “Prof.” Fox used* to
feed his specimens almost entirely on frogs.
* * * *
“Steve Hart”: I have often seen the
platypus (B. 2/2/’22) in coastal rivers, where the
water is as salt as the sea. They are voracious
feeders and like land worms and grubs, as well as
shrimps and mussels. But I have never seen one
leave the water and climb up the bank.

“E.S.S.” : 'The’pretty little ringtail ’pos-
sum, being protected by a law that is mostly too
dead to move, is a very rare beastie now in dis-
tricts where it was once plentiful. It builds a large
dome-shaped nest of ferns, leaves and teased stringy -
bark in the fork of a tree in scrubby situations; and
that conspicuous home is too tempting for the
unsentimental blokes whose pleasure is harrying and
murdering wild creatures. I have seen it nested in
a scrub close to a blacks’ camp. Binghi evidently
had some regard for it, • when it could survive for
years in his vicinity. We used to call it the red
ipossum on account of its rufous fur.
“Te Whare”: Has any Papuan naturalist
seen the nest of the bird of paradise? An explorer
of the ’seventies .states that it is made of fine, grass,
and that numbers occur in a single tree, but he may
have got his information from natives. Again, he

may have imagined it. Birds of paradise, by the way,
are, strangely enough, placed close to the crow family
in the genera of birds. Another remarkable Papuan
fowl is the gardener-bird ( Amblyornis ).' It builds a
play-arbor, or hut, of plant-stalks, grass and mosses,
with an opening in front, and decorates it with gaily-
colored blossoms. The Amblyornis is somewhat dingy
in plumage and is related to our bower-birds, which
Foster Fraser, who rushed through Australia some
years ago, accused of laying their eggs in their
canoodling arbors. As a matter of fact, the bower-
birds build fairly-neat nests of fine twigs, lined with
root fibres, and place them in the forks of trees, or
sometimes in wild vines. Neither does the gardener-
bird use its arbor otherwise than as an abode of
love.

There is a hard metallic glittering
In all the leaves;
A little brown-winged bird runs chittering
Under the eaves.
The furnace of the west is mellowing
To amber heat;
Grasses upon the hill are yellowing,
Dust holds my feet.
Inside the house there is a clattering—■
A crash and chime—
The typewriter has caught a smattering
Of summer rhyme.
Home music for the years’ remembering
The keyboard spills
Along the path that went Septembering
With daffodils.

ONLY when it is fitted with the
Patented Vacuum System
On the level, over roughest roads, and up and the steepest grades,
the Stewart Vacuum System is “always on the job, giving the car the
“constancy of a Niagara.
It permits of installing the fuel reservoir at the rear of the car, where it
belongs—makes possible a more beautiful car design, eliminates the troub e-
i some pressure and gravity-feed systems—trouble-proof for the life of the
| car.
After most exhaustive tests car manufacturers have come to the C( J^ IC^US^ O j
that there is but one feed system to consider —the Stewart raten e
Vacuum System. That is why the Stewart is found on such an
> enormous percentage of cars to-day.
Therefore, if you want the best from your car —if you would enjoy
real motoring pleasures, devoid of all feed troubles, insist that your
car be fitted with the Stewart Vacuum System.

Your Servant the Wind.
Wind power is always available. You can make it your daily assistant for
pumping and dispense with hand pumping or bucket carrying. Less drudgery
while the mill pays for itself
THE BILLABONG MILL
is sensitive in even a slight breeze—
the ball-bearing bedplate making it
turn and work when less sensitive
mills are idle.
IHE BILLABONG works better
and lasts longer because it has mas-
sive main castings, centre lift to
avoid strain, automatic lubrication,
and split bearings. There are five
bearings only, any one of which can
be renewed without moving any
gear. All these points of excellence
are safeguarded by the Combined
Speed Regulator and Governor.
This patented contrivance pre-
vents racing, adapts the mill’s speed
to the velocity of the wind, and pulls
the wheel out of the gale when it is
dangerous to pump. The moderate-
priced mill the farmer buys and
recommends.

performed at the Comedie Francaise, which
is one of the highest honors to be obtaine
on the French stage; she prays, she exoi-
cises Chevalier by burning his photographs,
she does everything that her simple intellect
suggests to her; she even sends De Ligny
away for a long absence, because it is omy
when lie kisses her that the horrid vision
appears. The study of the little trollop who
suddenly finds that her lies and lust have to
be paid for is intensely powerful, though
perhaps a tragic novelist like Hardy would
have caused the obsession to develop more
implacably and progressively. One knows,
that she is just a bad little “piece upon
whom M. France has lavished his coldest
irony, and yet one unwillingly sympathises
with her. She is not a pure and delightful
woman like Tess; sexually she is just as
bad as she can be; yet one is almost sorry
when at last the dead man triumphs drama-
tically, and FSlicie wails to De Ligny ‘ We
shall never again belong to each other, we
tw<i He forbids it!”
The literary .style is remarkable, even for
M. France. He seems to have tried to see
how many words lie could leave out; he is
ultra-Tacitean, not only in compressed
speech, but in what is even more difficult,
compressed thought. It is wonderf.il how
few words he 'finds really necessary to place
complex thoughts on paper, how few abstract
nouns, how few adjectives; how diamond-
clear are his sentences —-in thought how dia-
mond-hard. Like the diamond they have
been subjected to terrific pressure, so that
their value becomes to the value of ordinary
writing as diamonds are to coal. There are
passages which vie with the flashlights of
Kipling and Conrad, in which M. France
secures effects with a few words that a
lesser man could not obtain with a whole
dictionary. Let fne give one passage, selected
almost at random. F6licie and l)e Ligny
are about to enter the lonely house of assigna-
tion, on a cold winter’s evening:—
They alighted from the cab. The trees of the
boulevarde, in four straight lines, lifted their frail
skeletons into the fog. They heard the diminishing
rattle of their cab on its way back to the barrier,
and the trotting of a horse coming from Paris.
“How dismal the country is,” she said with a
shiver.
Pages of description are compressed into
these few words, yet how well they give the
impression of gloomy and silent cold amidst
straight lines that we all felt in Northern
France. The secret of Anatole France, like
the secret of Kipling, lies not in what he
says, but in what he suggests.
Of course the morals of the story are not
the morals of Australia; they are those of
La .Vie Pakisienne that so many of us
read and loved at the war, though the Com-
monwealth will not now allow it into the
country lest we should become depraved.
M., France does not hesitate to call a spade
a spade; no doubt he excuses _ himself by
thinking that it would be inartistic to call
it a “bloody shovel.” Yet "A Mummer’s
Tale” is refreshing after so*much American
slush and Miss Ethel M. Dell. It is Naughty.
The translation is good, but leaves an un-
easy feeling that sometimes M. Koche has
been unabie to find the one word —le mot juste
—which was needed to express the exact
thought. After all, is it possible to translate
supremely good and compressed prose from
one language to another V Does the excel-
lent French translation of Kipling suggest to
an educated Frenchman exactly the same
ideas that the original suggests to an edu-
cated Englishman?

Positives and Negatives
In the world of literature there are two
kinds of writers —those who have and those
who have not a Sense of Humor. Nhver
mi/jd the definition of that sense. Each of us
knows exactly what it is—a divine attribute
granted to a favored few, beginning with
oneself, and denied to the rest of the world.
And so authors, like Oliver Wendell Holmes’s
blondes, divide themselves into Positives and
Negatives. It is easy to pick them out.
Stevenson is a Positive, though except in his
letters he wastes little time on mere amusing.
iWordsworth is a Negative, and so are most
free-verse writers, and most American novel-
ists.
Once upon a time one of our greatest of
great-ancestors struck with a stone-weighted
club at his four-legged dinner. The dinner
side-stepped neatly, and vanished. The force
of the misdirected blow swung Great-Ancestor
completely round on one heel and the club
landed on the outside of his left knee. His
fellow-hunters roared with laughter. But
the remarkable thing is this: as he limped
away grinning with pain, he also grinned
faintly at his own mishap; and in that
moment Humor was born. Very slowly it is
spreading through the world, with many curi-
ous shoots in its rudimentary stages. Romp-
ing puppies often bare their teeth in what
seems a smile of amusement; kittens inviting
capture, then darting 'from the . baffled hand,
show a real sense of fun. A certain caged
magpie when fed always calls the cat. When
Puss runs up to the cage Mag takes a piece
of meat in his beak and holds it to her
through the bars, snatching it back just as
the cat opens her mouth and thinks she has
it. The trick is repeated many times, to the
bird’s obvious enjoyment, Puss submitting
because she knows she will be allowed a tit-
bit in the end. This is the lowest form of
humor, the practical joke, but surely humor
all the same. By a natural transition from
young animals to young humans we find the
saving sense develops generally late in chil-
dren, however merry; though an occasional
lucky one is early blessed with the consola-
tion of seeing the funny side of his troubles.
An aggrieved baby-boy once stopped in the
midst of his own uproar to criticise it. with
tearful amusement: “That sounded like a
little bow-wow!” And though he resumed
his howl exactly where he had interrupted it,
he could not keep on being sad much longer.
One of the most delightful of our Positive
novelists wrote a story of two sisters, one all
sensibility or soft romantic feelings, the other
with just a little touch of humor, of judg-
ment, that turned sensibility into sense. Per-
haps humor and judgment are much the same
thing, implying a breadth of vision, an ele-
vating power that lifts one up above calamity
to see it, if only in a lightning glimpse, from
above, as a god may see it. It is significant
that when judgment is utterly relaxed, when
the controlling hands are off the reins of
reason —in other words, when we are dream-
ing—humor simply does not exist. Ludicrous
things may happen in dreams, absurdities to
laugh at over the breakfast-table; but at the
moment when we believe they actually occur,
though we may be embarrassed or annoyed,
we are never amused by them.
The great humorous writers are keenly alive
to the pity and terror of existence —their
sensitive observation ensuires that. But
the rule does not apply conversely. _ Serious
authors with a mission, and those with none
but taking themselves gravely, are apt to be
betrayed by the very earnestness of their
zeal into literary “howlers” worse, because
of their context, than any examination-
harassed schoolboy’s. From Goethe down-
wards we find these writers hampered by the
lack of the saving sense, which should be
present at every tragic creation, dumb but
watchful like a guardian angel, lest some
incongruous expression slip in and wreak the
change from pathos to bathos.
It is of course undeniable that Negative
writers may and do rise to great heights of
beauty; but they may and do sink occasion-
ally to the ridiculous, or to the morbid and
needlessly offensive. Positive writers in
their most serious moods cannot be unhealthy.
Though they are offen sentimental it seems
to be with tongue in cheek. “Thomas
Ingoldsby” often has a few serious lines
slipped in among his levity, but he will over-
look no lapses on the part of his Muse, as
he plainly tells her :—-
Dry your eyes, Miss, blow your nose, and go on!
And consider Thackeray’s “Willow Tree,” a
plaintive ballad of ill-starred love, ending
in:—•
Domine, Domine !
Sing we a litany —
Sing for poor maiden-hearts broken and weary ;
Domine, Domine 1
Sing we a litany,
Wail we and weep we a wild Miserere !
One imagines him reading it through when
he had completed it, first with the _ usual
poet’s complacency, and then with an impish
twinkle behind his spectacles as he set to
work on “Another Version.” That tells how
the grief of the bereaved parents turns to
pardonable annoyance when their errant
daughter, instead of being romantically
drowned, turns up safely, with a rather fishy
excuse for her absence; and they
For the work of that
Cruel though , short night
Sent her to bed without
Tea for a fortnight,
the “Moral” naughtily parodying, the last
verse of the first version:—
Iley , diddle diddlety,
Cat and the Piddlety,
Maidens of England take caution by she 1
Let love and suicide
Never tempt you aside,
And always remember to take the door-key!
It is impossible to imagine Goethe even think-
ing of selecting bits of his own “Die Wahl-
verwandtschaften” to make fun of; yet they
fairly beg for it now and then.
Whenever a person is marked out by tem-
perament and training, and the success of suc-
ceeding, for one particular line, it may be
taken for granted that the perversity of
human nature makes him hunger to travel
in the opposite direction. There was never
yet a great comedian but hankered to play
Hamlet. And given the chance he might
have been a great Hamlet, for the under-
standing of comedy means the understanding
of tragedy, and skill breeds skill. Writers
are luckier than actors in that they can follow
out such whims at will, often triumphantly,
as in the case of W. W. Jacobs. To each his
outlet; to some a strange one. Lewis
Carroll, tired of writing clever nonsense,
“stretched himself” in “Condensation of
Determinants” and “Algebraic Formulae for
Ilesponsions”: and Stephen Leacock turns
from his burlesque to solemn professorial
classes.
Laughter and Tears are twins devoted.
Sometimes one hides from the other, but they
are never far apart. Shakspeare’s Biron,
when condemned to a punishment fitting his
crime of incorrigible and merciless flippancy,
and ordered to joke with the sick and jest
a twelvemonth in a hospital, cries out in the
unforgettable line : —•
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
With the omniscience of youth, he declares:
It cannot be; it is impossible;
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
He came to know better as he gained in
years and was acquainted with grief. Be
sure his laughter-loving wit grew only
brighter, though more tender, in the learning.
If Biron shadows forth Shakspeare himself,
as some critics assert, his knowledge of joy
and sorrow was infinitely wider and deener
by the the time he had travelled from “Love’s
Labor’s Lost” to “The Tempest.” And
lesser folk since Shakspeare’s day have been
fated to see agony, and death itself, faced
with courageous jesting.
ELSIE COLE.
Immortality
Flan MacDatlia was writing in Ogham on
the fan-like laths of his taibhli fileadh, rest-
ing the wood on a stone before the door of
the king’s house. On the balcony of the
grianan a woman flapped a woollen bed-rug
of many colors and tossed her head towards
Flan. King Conary Mor walked out of the
great door and lifted his hand in greeting.
The cloak of birds’ feathers on the king’s
left shoulder partly concealed his broad
toroue of beaten gold, but his crimson tunic,
embroidered with silver braid, told of his
high rank. After him came four men, tall
and strong, walking behind bronze shields.
“I reign for a few years,” thought Conary
as he looked over the cornlands of Meath,
“but the words Flan writes down will be
read to the end of the world.”
The woman shaking out dust on the bal-
cony of the grianan turned to her mate in
the room behind.
"It is great to be Flan. King Conary goes
out in feathers and crimson cloth and gold
and silver. When there -s no king Conary
there will still be a long thought of Flan and
the words he wrote.”
And Flan Mac Datha went on writing good
words on the fah-like laths of his taibhli
fileadh. .
Five hundred and six years after the death
of Flan Mac Datha, poet laureate of the
ard righ, the name Latin was given to an
illiterate people of Central Italy. Their fish-
ing village of Alba Longa was rapidly grow-
ing into a small town ; and the Latin war-
riors ran away from the Siculi, Etruscans
and other enemies less frequently than in
former times. Some deserted earthworks on
the hills a few miles inland were known as
Roma; and the village chiefs had an idea of
establishing the small community there for
greater safety.
* * * *
“There can be no doubt,” said the learned
lecturer, who spoke with a slight German
accent, “that the Latin alphabet supplied
the basis of the Ogham writing. Why it was
used in preference to Roman characters
must remain forever a mystery, but the
presence of the letter Q”... .
“The work of Herbert Scantpence is of
permanent literary value,” wrote the enthu-
siastic reviewer, in 1922. “There can be
little doubt that his work will outlive the
chances and changes of bur modern life and
b« read far on the centuries when the dust
lies thick upon us and upon our works.”
“There is no reason to believe,” said the pro-
fessor in 4(i02, “that British literature repre-
sents more than a somewhat clumsy imitation
of the Asiatic classics. The mystical Shaks-,
peare, of whose work no authentic line sur-
vives, is probably the god of war of the
northern barbarians. The few ouotations
from the obsolete languages of Europe bear
internal evidence of having been written at
a much later date than some scholars have
inferred; in fact, the consensus of modern
opinion is against the belief that the art of
writing could have reached the northern
countries earlier than 2900.”
“The copy of The Bulletin found in the
dry sand of a cave in eastern Australia in
4986 caused a long dispute over the authen-
ticity of the discovery,” wrote Hoo-kai-ho
in “A History of Universal Culture,” pub-
lished in the year 6693. “Scholars have
been divided into two camps ever since;
but if its genuineness could be established it
would go far to convince the world that as
early as 1922 the people of the southern con-
tinent were not wholly illiterate. Whether
Shakspeare lived before or after this date
we have no means of determining.”

The Inky Way
“A.II.”: C. G. Dixon, writing on “The Rewards of
Genius,” particularly with reference to Poets
Laureate (R.P. 2/2/’22), contends that eminently
respectable old men, who mostly award official honors,
are unlikely to appreciate new ideas, new forces, new
methods. They are “just as incapable, he adds,
“of appreciating new and original genius as Johnson
was of appreciating Milton, or as Pope would have
been of appreciating Wordsworth or Keats. the
general proposition seems reasonable. Put it
seems to be suggested that Milton was a
new and original genius” to Johnson in the
latter’s capacity of critic and writer of poets
lives; and I And it difficult to understand
how this can be advanced, seeing that Milton
died 34 years before Johnson was born. And didnit
Johnson appreciate Milton? Because he was totally
unable to admire “Lycidas” and said so with his
usual downrightness—in a passage that has been
quoted derisively, as an instance of prejudice run
wild, for over a century—is it fair to say that he
didn’t and couldn’t appreciate Milton? Mhy, even
at Shakspeare Johnson has a jab now and again.
Birred finds it rather a pleasant trait in Samuel
the anfractuous that he kept all his rough words (in
his “Lives of the Poets”) for the biggest men, viz.,
Shakspeare, Milton and Gray. But it was assuredly
not for their work as a whole; it was for opaque
parts,” or such as appeared obscure to him. in
!i great work,” he tells us, “there is a vicissitude of
luminous and opaque parts, as there is in «> e world
a succession of day and night. Milton, when hehas
expatiated in the sky, may be allowed sometimes to
revisit earth; for what other author ever soared so
high or sustained his flight so long? Hardly the
language of a critic, this, towards a poet whom he
is incapable of appreciating. Actually, could higher
appreciation be expressed in words?
“Wart” • “Pickwick” was not the only Dickens
book pirated in Launceston (Tas.) in the early days.
“Bleak House” and “Little Dorrit” were also issued
by Henry Dowling, and are scarcer than the Pick-
wick. Dowling had in his employ a convict, John ?
Briggs, who engraved the plates. (He also acted a
cook, bottlewasher and general factotum in the
house.) The illustrations were signed Fi/.z and
Fizz V D L.,” and they have no need to be ashamed
of ' themselves. Dowling first issued 1 ickwick,
and it was. such a success that he put in handl the
other two, but Dickens got to hear of it and set his
lawyers to work befpre copies could be distributed.
When Johnny Briggs was asked what he was sent
out” for, he'used to explain with a confidential air
that he was once found in bed with his boots on.
Judging by his. skill with the pen and graver I
should that it was forgery. A boxwood
hlook of Dowling’s signature which Johnny cut for
him when he . was Mayor of Launceston is near
enough to deceive a bank-teller.
From Frank White, who wrote his first par for
Tub Bulletin when, he was a school-teacher i •
Australia: “Here in Florida an Australian can feel
at home if only because the sun shines much as it
does out our way. From time to time a letter
reaches me from 'some dissatisfied Australian scribe
who wants to come here and get rich quick. My
advice to such Inky Wayfarers is not to expect to
get into print in this country till they ve been here
for a year or two —in other words, till they have
assimilated Americanism in all its . beautiful and
horrible phases. After that, it’s pretty much up to
the man. Journalism generally doeSn t P a y
money here. The fellows who are getting the big
returns are the feature men who can syndicate their
stuff. My last staff job was with the New ?he
ino World, where for a couple of years I bandied the
job of Marine Editor. Now pretty well established, I
have joined the feature men and sell my goods to
papers on both sides of the Atlantic. And after
eight years in American journalism I am able to
spend my winters in this sunny clime where million-
aires meander, away from the blizzards of New York
and Chicago.”
The Diggers’ Gazette, a soldiers’ paper in South
Aus., said it could hardly expect the editor of the
rival Returned Soldier to “have the common
decency to withdraw his charges,” however grossly
inaccurate,” about the report and balance-sheet ot
the Diggers’ League. That was well enough. But
the Gazette added: “His attempt to d 6 the League
an injury merely exposes his own crass ignorance
as well as unprincipled character.” That “unprin-
cipled character” cost the publishers £5O and costs.

“Tren”: The number of grubby youngsters
begging in crowded thoroughfares has in-
creased rapidly in Melbourne during the
.past year, and the evidence in a vag. case at
St. Kilda the other day proves it to be an
organised enterprise. A man was arrested

proceeds. He got 12 months.
“Jim Carew”: I was shown a proof
sovereign from the Sydney Mint, made from .
Australian gold and bearing date 1855.
The coin had a greenish-yellow tint, pro-
bably caused by the amount of silver mixed
with the gold. In those days silver in
Australia was worth about 55., and the
actual value of the sovereign was more than
20s. The “head” of the coin was similar
to that of the English sovereign, but on the
reverse side was a map of Australia sur-
mounted by a small crown. Underneath was
a laurel wreath and in it the words “Sydney
Mint” and the date. In the ’nineties I saw
one of these sovereigns sold for £25; but
the one shown me recently is not for sale

solemnly noted them on paper. Then the
prad was given another waggon to pull
and the performance was repeated, after
which a team of three greys hauled a five-ton
load and had to have their pulses felt. too.
It was really a working test of the advant-
age of ball-bearing over plain hubs, con-
ducted under actual working conditions. It
proved that a gee with his load on ball-
bearings was able to pull 50 p.c. more.
than on plain hubs. Incidentally, a lead-
ing vet. estimates that ball-bearings will
add two years to the life of a horse in front
of them. You’ve only to imagine yourself
spending a lifetime pushing a bike without
ball-bearings to realise how Dobbin will
welcome them.

“E.F.” on the making of wills: —
What layman will think as Chief Justice Irvine
(Vic.) did in the matter of a codicil which the late
William Gibson did not add to his will? Gibson (the
Foy and Gibson man) left to his relatives an estate
valued at 2J millions. He had a family of one
son and four daughters, and by his will the one son
William was to receive £400,000 as his share. The
son, who was married and had one daughter, pre-
deceased the old man. His death, seemingly, caused
the father to write a letter to his lawyers instructing
them to delete from the will the name of his dead
son, “also his heirs and successors in the will.” But
Gibson did not sign the addition to the document.
He died ere he could sign it. Vet the letter was
admitted as a codicil, and C.J. Irvine decided that
its meaning was the impoverishment of the testator’s
grand-daughter and daughter-in-law, and the corres-
ponding enrichment of his four daughters, who were
already half-millionaires or thereabouts. To a lay-
man this learned judgment is amazing. It makes no
allowance for the possible, or probable, difference
between the testator’s intention when he wrote the
letter and the decision he might have arrived at,
under the advice of his lawyers, when he came to put
his name to a codieil. Nobody can swear that, in in-
structing his lawyers to delete the references to his
deceased son, he intended to cut off his son’s widow
and his own flesh and blood without a bean. What
he would have done when it came to putting his let-
ter into his testament no Judge can guess. The
judgment, assuming that it will stand, looks uncom-
monly like an incentive to a bit more legislation.

“Loyalty to the British flag is characteristic of the
Hebrew race.” —Daily paper.
The suburbs of Jerusalem
Are rich and fair and wide;
And there the ancient race of Shem
Has hung its hat inside. 1
In Bloomsbury and Darlinghurst,
In Paris and in Rome,
The exiled people Judah nursed
Are very much at home.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
Lift up your gates and sing
The song of Aaron’s budded stem,
Which is “God Save the King” ;
And wave on high in every place,
In - spite of pain and loss,
The splendid banner of the race
That shows a threefold cross!
The triple balls of Lombard fame
No longer can suffice—
In fact, the old pawnbroking game
Is not considered nice.
No, pride demands a stronger flag;
And this at least is fair:
The Jew who makes the cross his brag
First put the emblem there.
Wave high the white and red and blue
Above the modern fog!
The Hebrew to this sign is true
As to his synagogue.
The bonds of Empire are his pride ;
And, shekeled fast to these,
What traitor hand shall dare divide
Jew-Jingo destinies!

P. O. M.


Age does not come with the
blare of trumpets. It creeps
along on velvet slippers— and
we are old before we know it.
HE Spanish philoso-
pher, Gracian, has said
somewhat cynically,
‘ ‘A beauty should break
her mirror early, lest
she do so later with open
eyes.”
T) UT Gracian lived at the end of the
Seventeenth Century before beauty
had recourse to the magic aids of today;
sweet scented, smooth textured, fasci-
natingly-packaged things for the hair,
the face, the hands, the nails. But if
you stop there —why you simply have
not begun. For after all what is a
pretty face with a poor figure? What
is a lovely skin, if it can’t be seen for
noticing that ugly pillowy curve from
armpit to ankle ?
AND yet so many women who would
L not think of neglecting their faces
are. falling into slipshod ways about
their figures the most relentless be-
trayers of advancing years. It is a very
subtle art, is the care of the figure; too
much or too little corsetry is fatal.
O
|F the woman who persists in adding
years and subtracting charm by
exaggerated, inflexible and obvious
corsetry that violates every law of
good taste, we can only say with the
French beauty and wit, Madame de
Sevigne, “Are there no such things in
the world as friends and looking
glasses ?’ ’ Particularly should the woman
of full figure be heedful of the modern,
slim-by-proportion corsetry that con-
ceals stoutness with a slenderizing har-
mony of natural lines.
TN these days of sophisticated cor-
setry, only the thoughtless woman
who placidly accepts her youthful slen-
derness as a permanent gift of the gods
and neglects to protect it with proper
corsetry, needs know the discourage-

fOU will never wish to take another dose of pills
after having once used Chamberlain’s Tablets.
They are easier and more pleasant to take, more

They leave the bowels in a natural condition, while

What does SKI 7 mean?
More than a long proved quality in ball bearings; even more than a KIND
of bearing—SsClP stands for an altogether different principle in ball bearings,
that has overcome all precedent, and has been the means of saving millions
of H.P. of waste energy.
The most advanced engineering practice of the present time in Australia and
throughout the world accepts
SKP
BALL BEARINGS
as being the nearest approach to frictionless power production yet devised.
For example, in actual test an Boz. bolt placed at the end of a 30in. pulley
spoke started the rotation of 140 ft. of shafting with pulleys. SKI 7
Ball Bearings are self-aligning and instantly adjust themselves to shaft
deflection, speing, or load change. Equipped with SKF Ball Bearings
you get more power out of the same plant than you could if plain bearings
or roller bearings were utilised—not to mention saving of oil, time, wages,
upkeep and increased life of bearings and belts.
We invite discussion of YOUR power problem.

A. E. Ford moves on after 13 years in
Adelaide as traffic superintendent of the
Tramways Trust. South Aus. born, he
was first on the Sydney lines, then in Ben-
digo. His latest land biggest) appointment
is with the Auckland tranis.
Passed out at 87, James Duffy, of Yass,
(N.S.W.). Born in Fermanagh, Ireland,
he Came to N. S. Wales in 1843, and was a
carrier in goldfield days between Sydney
and the Victorian diggings. Later he to >k
up land on the Barcoo, then settled on the
Murrumbidgee, and remained there until the
encroachment of the Burrinjuck waters
gave him marching orders.
At a Sunday evening meeting in Welling-
ton (M.L.) Robert Hogg, editor of the local
Truth, was debating socialism with an
opponent when the latter, becoming ruffled,
declared his inability to “make a silken
purse out of a Hogg’s ear.” “That,” replied
Hogg, not a whit offended, “is not the fault
of the hog, but of the foOl who tries to
do it!”
“Paudh” (M.L.) : The diverting Stephen
Leacock, the “Nonsense Novels” professor,
was in these parts in 1907, and delivered a
lecture at Victoria College, Wellington,_ on
“American and Canadian University Life.”
The attendance was poor. It is a risk to
miss seeing and hearing the casual visitor
from afar: you never know what fame he
may be the advance agent of.
Alexander Ross, lately of Temora
(N.S.W.), who is 88, recently decided to give
up work and live with his daughter at Bur-
wood ; but first he paid a visit to his brother,
aged 92, at Rossdale, near Goulburn. He
went by road, and drove his ancient pony
Hughie, aged 31, the whole of the 150 miles,
making the trip in three days. It was
Hughie’s last job, as he now settles in honor-
able retirement on the elder brother’s estate.
“N.” : Owing to increases in rail freights
the privately-owned steam vessels between
Sydney and Gosford are reaping a harvest.
Nowadays goods from Sydney to Ourimbah
go by boat to Gosford. thence by horse trac-
tion to tbe railway, and the last six miles
are done by rail. It has a fine, up-to-date
sound about it; but perhaps it is merely
a conspiracy to prevent the railway workers
getting the full product of their labor.
“All this talk about the increasing scanti-
ness of women’s bathing costumes makes me
tired,” said a white-haired man over the
most circumspect of S’Yarra tea-tables.
“When I was a lad I attended an aquatic
carnival, as it was called, at Brill’s Baths.
Brighton—in England, you know. The star
turn was a swimming and diving duet by
a man who wore nothing blit a pair of bath-
ing drawers, and a pretty girl in stocking-
ette tights, which began under her arms and
finished far above her knees. She had a
rose pinned at her bosom, and all the nicest
people in Brighton at the time called her
just sweet when she swam with one leg out
of water.”
“Yoyang” on a pot-boiler of importance:
At Douro, the old homestead of Henry O’Brien,
who squatted on the Yass and Murrumbidgee rivers
(N.S.W.) in the late twenties of last century, there
are still some of the old cauldrons used when in
1843 Henry O’Brien successfully experimented with
the boiling down of sheep—an idea which saved
hundreds of old-time settlers from bankruptcy.
O’Brien was related to the Marquis of Sligo, and is
said to have left India for Australia in a great hurry.
In 1823 he got his first grant, later bought stud
sheep from Macarthur, of Camden, and by 1829 was
well established with his flocks along the Yass and
Murrumbidgee. Then the great trouble came —much
the same sort of trouble that Dooley is trying to
dodge in his weak way to-day. The cessation of
transportation meant the stoppage of the large sums
of British money which used to come to maintain
the convicts, and sheep fell to Is. per head. It was
O'Brien who struck the idea of boiling them down
for their tallow, and though it meant an appalling
waste of meat it lifted the price in many cases to
4s. An attempt made simultaneously (in Charlotte
Place, Sydney) to can the meat failed.
“Alan Kinross” puts it on record: —
“Te Whare” (B. 15/12/’2l) asks for descendants
of the Imlay brothers, the pioneers of Bega (N.S.M .).
The son of the late Captain Alexander Imlay was
named Alexander, and at one time owned Comongin
station, outside Thargomindah (Q.). He died about
30 years ago, and his wife and four children have
a fine little war record all to themselves. Jean, the
eldest daughter, was with the Australian nursing ser-
vice, and was at one time second in command at
' Luna Park, the Aussie hospital near Heliopolis.
Later she was with an English casualty clearing
crowd near Cambrai. The eldest son, Alexander, left
Australia as a 2nd “loot” with the 16th Battalion,
and finished up as a colonel with five wound stripes,
D.S.O. and bar and three “mentions.” The younger
son, George, left as a private with a N.S.W. bat-
talion, and returned with three stars, three “men-
tions” and an M.C. The mother and the other sister
also did their whack with various comforts funds,
etc. There is still another Alexander —son of the
colonel —who is in Calcutta with his parents. Lieut.
Bert Borton, killed with the Maorilanders, was also
a grandson of the original Alexander.
IN RETROSPECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I wish I could have it all over again,
Plum-cake and jelly, and strawberry ice;
But the guests have all gone, and the big dock
strikes ten —-
Things never last long if they’re specially nice.
Well, I’ve had a good time, and it’s no use to sigh;
Soon Mummy will come, there are prayers to be
said,
An’ I’ve got such a pain, but I’m not going to cry,
For it means castor oil, and I’d sooner be dead!”
“How I wish I could have you all over again,
Oh, sweet mystic moon, by the blue-purple sea,
The glowing embrace of the dearest of men,
And the high notes of Love weaving strange
, melody!
Heigh-ho, but it’s over! The years yawn ahead—
He’s cross in the morning, and grumpy at e’en;
But I snuggle up close in the big double bed,
And dream little dreams of the ‘what might have
been.’ ”
Do I wish I could have them all over again,
The dear happy days that are ending so soon —
The wonderful party the night I was ten,
The new wine of love, and our fond honeymoon?
Ah, no, Mon ami, for Sorrow’s grim spear
Is blunted and dull at the end of the day ;
But the gems of remembrance glow tenderly clear,
When the glory of sunset is over the bay.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Gomox and the Iron Horse
THERE is no form of transport in which
Comox has not had a hand in building or
maintaining. Comox saves many thousands
of pounds for Australian Railways—saves it by
simplifying production and repairs
The efficiency of locomotives has been increased
25% by the use of superheated steam. In the
the construction of every loco, superheater there
are, at least, 81 separate Oxy Acetylene welds.
Only because of this process was their manufac-
ture rendered a profitable commercial under-
taking.
The large staff of operators employed by the
railway departments is a striking tribute to the
efficiency of the Oxy Acetylene process. Opera-
tions, hitherto impossible, are now common
practice, and work, previously involving hours by
older methods, is now done in minutes by Comox
Torches.
There is no branch of the metal industries where
Comox cannot play its time and money saving
part. Engineers, Foundries, Sheet Metal

There must be good profit or great fascina-
tion m hairdressing for women. Wealthy
Westralian Sam Copley, who looms large in
financial circles in the Cold Country, offered
his sister £5OO a year on condition that she
gave up a hairdressing business. The busy
woman turned the offer down flat.
. “A.P.8.”: “M.D.” (B. 2/2/’22) is right
regarding the Englishwoman's aversion ro
mixing ziffs with her kisses, but with the
b rench it is just the opposite. The only
tiling lacking in the Digger in mademoiselle’s
eyes was the general absence of foliage on
his face, and many a French girl implored
her favonte Digger to grow some, declaring
that bare faces were all right for priests
and actors but no bon for a soldier.
The son and heir of the Duke of Cam-
bridge will be linked up with Australia when
he marries a daughter of the Hon. Osmond
Hastings. Hon. Osmond is a brother of the
Earl of Huntingdon, who married the eldest
daughter of “Salmon” Wilson, the late red-
haired knight of Ballarat. An elder Miss
Hastings became the Fred Fairbairns’
daughter-in-law when she married Gor-
don I airbairn. She lives on a Victorian
sheep patch with her husband and baby, and
a sister lately came across the seas to stay
with her.
“0.K.”: After all, no story of ready wit
in modern mummerland can beat the classic
anecdote of old-man Compton, contemporary
with J. B. Buckstone, at a public dinner.
Such a grave, dignified gentleman was this
quaint comedian that, being mistaken for a
parson, he was called upon to ask a blessing
on the victuals. With hardly a moment’s
hesitation Compton arose and said: “O Lord,
open Thou our lips and our mouths shall
show forth Thy praise.” Perhaps it was a
steal from one of the characters he had
played in his long lifetime, but the apt
remembrance of it was as good as an im-
promptu.
Once..upon a. time an attenuated circus
struck' an up-country township. The show
consisted of 'a ten-year-old star, his parents
and two horses. On the opening night,
when the poor, half-starved, white-faced little
mite was doing his “great riding act,” he
tell off the horse, apparently from sheer
weakness. A bushman, in from one of
the stations, stood up, took off his hat, and
planked a pound note in it; then, still not
speaking, he went round the audience, hold-
ing the hat to each. Completing the round
he strolled aefoss the ring to the father of
the outfit, and handed him the hat with the
laconic remark, “Put the kid in the hos-
pital. His aid and advice were gratefully
accepted.. The kid, who was suffering from
malnutrition, made a good recovery, and
during the war was one of Australia’s most
brilliant Officers. By a freak of fortune, and
unknowingly at the time, he saved the life
of the son of the silent bushman who had
probably saved liirii.
From an Adelaide lawyer:—
The Bulletin (9/2/’22) praises the love of
the late Registrar-General Anthony for cor-
rectness. But he went a bit beyond that. For
example, our Real Property Act says that every docu-
ment for registration must be certified as correct by
a- lawyer or a licensed land-agent'. Well, when a
member of either profession has signed such a certi-
ficate the law has been complied •with. The Act
does not say that he must add in which capacity he
certifies. Mr. Anthony did.. Back wdiild come the
document with an endorsement, “Capacity.must.be
stated ; or, if the Registrar was feeling humorous,
and the solicitor signing was a very well-known
solicitor indeed: ‘ls Mr. So-and-so a licensed land-
agent?” Where two or three lawyers or land-agents
were gathered together “Anthony’s latest” was a safe
subject for profanity and swapping of yarns. Once
“natural love and affection” was named' as the con-
sideration for the transfer of a property by a well-
known gay citizen to a member of the opposite sex.
The R.-G. did a little Sherlock Holmes work. Then
he returned the document for correction, - with a
memo, requiring the word “natural” to be struck
out.
The cry of an Australian housekeeper
after two months in India :
There is a vast market waiting for Australian goods
in India. In the big cities and away up in the
interior the tale is told of the excellence of Austra-
lian food-stuffs—ham and bacon especially, and jam
and cake. “We had them during the war, you
know, and they were so good and really cheap.
But of course we can’t get them now.” Why not?
And if cake, why not biscuits? If jam, why not
tinned and bottled and dried fruits? Many of the
friends I have met or made did not even know that
Australian dried fruits existed. Why not honey
(an appalling price in India), and why not a hundred
other things? If a shipload of our foodstuffs were
landed in Bombay to-morrow, and its arrival properly
advertised, I’ll guarantee that not a pound of any-
thing would be left within a week. As it is, I
accompanied one shopper all over Bombay on a vain
quest for Australian cake, and left with a commis-
sion to send her some from Australia. Incidentally,
I also heard of Australian jams and tinned fruits
from an Englishwoman in Manila. But hers, alas!
was the old story of battered tins and dirty, dingy,
unattractive labels. And really the distribution of
our stuff in England is not much better. Any Eng-
lish people I met who had tasted Australian honey
liked it, but shied at the thought of buying the
smallest available tin —70 pounds! The good Austra-
lians I know who have it in their English houses
mostly get it through friends in Australia who send
it to them direct.
MY FUTURE LIES WITH YOU.

And here to-night I’ll swear
Vows that are not quite new, dear

Which you delight to hear.
I never loved before you ;
My love will never faint;
I’d face the lions for you;
Beloved one, I adore you
As anchorite his saint!
For truth I do not care, dear,.

To please you Hell 1 dare, dear.

Nobody will get a headache through try-
ing to foretell the climax of “Paddy the Next
Best Thing.” The experience of Sydney and
other places was repeated at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday. Except to a percentage
of theatregoers who have read the book the
dramatised version of “Paddy” seems
strangely elementary and glaringly obvious.
A blob of artless melodrama (suggestive of
the death of Dear Father in "Eyes of
Youth” and a hundred other plays) pro-
trudes like a coral-reef from a placid sea
of small talk, tinctured with extracts of “Peg
o’ My Heart,” “Taming of the Shrew’ and
railway-carriage drama. Viewing the Aus-
tralian production one can attribute the
popular English success of “Paddy” only to
the vast population of simplicity tnat listens
to its appeal in the old country. Differently
acted its appeal to the unintelligent classes-
would be stronger, but with the chief charac-
ter entrusted to the unconvincing treatment
of Miss Isobel Brosnan, and with more than
one head.of the co. revealing evidence of
false hair, “Paddy the Next Best Thing’
appears a rather crudely-theatrical enter-
tainment, bristling with artificial merriment
and full of conventional tricks. *
Allowance mhst be made for the nervous-
ness of Miss Brosnan last Saturday night. -
Her performance- bf the inexplicable romp
and inexcusable vixen • was overacted in
nearly all particulars. She showed practi-
cally no natural sense of humor, and the
character made it very difficult for a clever
imitation sense of humor to be substituted.
Certainly, the lady was happier in the rail-
way-carriage scene than at the outset, but
right up to curtain-fall she was overweighted.
She shared the fate of Isobel Wiltord, Nellie
McCarthy and Miss Bobby McMillen in
being contrasted with male comedians of the
least aggressive type, quiet-spoken men who
made the young ladies look and sound some-
what harsh and theatrical. Charles Court-
neidge, who has to play the calm and con-
stant lover of the lady of the auburn wings,
is nothing if not natural. He is not the
typical sixpenny storiette lover that he ought
to be. His calmness is a bit tame, and the
length, breadth and depth of his alleged
passion for the intensely trying young woman
are barely suggested even when he kisses
her struggling hands; but he always presents
himself unaffectedly. Anew McMaster, as
another harmless young man, runs on nar-
rower lines; Kay Souper is the father who
has to perish of heart complaint behind the
scene in order that grief may strike “Paddy”
whilst she is dancing a jig; and two elderly
ladies, one of whom is .Meta Pelham, are
required to figure in the middle distance and-
talk the merest twaddle. “Paddy” will be
transferred to the King’s on Saturday,
At Melbourne Palace a crowded house on
the second Saturday of the season settled any
doubts that might have been left in Allan
Wilkie’s mind. “Hamlet” was the bill, and
it was a sure draw, both Wilkie and his lead-
in*? lady being recognised a.s interesting
artists in the characters of the blood thirst j-
“Dorothy," at Sydney
Royal.

it was the revival

newed pubi c con-
fidence, shaken by
an indiscreet rovi-
va 1 of “Julius
Cmsar” to open
the' season. I n
the roaring comedy
it - happened that
actors who were
ineffective as
Brutus and Cas-
sius had been
placed out of
hai-m’s way as
Ant onio and
Ors i no, while
former ancient
Romans of no par-
ti cul a r account
were now favor-
ably circumstanced
as Sir Toby (Fred
Macdonald), Aguecheek (Hamilton Henry)
and Fabian (Felix Bland). Sir Toby,
though lacking roundness of humor, had
points of individuality which, with the ex-
ception of a puerile pantomime nose, were
pleasantly unusual; Sir Andrew’s face and
falsetto tones were not the whole of his
fortune, and Fabian was freshly- natural in
his part. Maria (Vera St. John) lent reality
to every scene she touched, despite her being
disguised in an awful birdcage gown, of the
kind that made civilisation hideous in the
days of Velasquez. Wilkie’s Malvolio is
always one of his best comedy efforts, very
forcible in the last scene, and the Viola of
Miss I-lunter-Watts, though _ grown rather
worn in voice, weary in spirit and a trifle
less picturesque, is still a better Viola than
many a plumper actress has been. Lprna
Forbes made a pleasing Countess, prepared
to be amorous when the right man came
along, and only wanting a more ldfty manner
to the world at large. Finally, among the
peoplte who really mattered there was Roy
Workman as a Clown with a good voice and
a cultivated warble. The Clown didn’t fit in
with Sir Toby and his blithering dupe, and
he had no pungency in his speech or charac-
ter in his fooling; but he was light and grace-
ful, and very tuneful. At this moment the
Wilkie show is “Romeo and Juliet,” with
the boss as Mercutio, a young Australian
as Romeo, Miss Watts as the youn** lady in
the case, and Fanny Wiseman as the Nurse
who is mainly responsible for the famous
Capulft Boneyard Tragedy. The “Shrew”
next Saturday.

“Johnny, Get Your Gun” is th do a turn
at Melbourne lioyal when “Paddy" has filled
in a week and removed to the King’s. In
this forbiddingly-named comedy Louis Ben-
nison, from ’Murka, will have the support
of'a strbng and numerous co„ and the..man-
agerial promise of a hilarious - entertainment
is most emphatic;

At Melbourne Majesty’s the panto, has
given place to “A Night Out,” and the re-
turn of Frith has restored to the riotous
proceeding ita original peculiarities. Dan
Avar has gone back to his previous place
as the police commissioner who makes him-
self polite.
At Melbourne Tivoli the new Frolics have
come to offer reparation for the yld Frolics/
In the present programme, which had about
a yard and a- half .to spare when* staged at
Saturday’s matinee, the humor of Recco
counts for much, and the unvivacity of Ley-
land Hodgson and Ethel Walker get no open-
ing in the two earliest scenes. Also the
Parisian underworld is noteworthy for its
private crematorium, where lydies who shove
other lydies into the river are burnt alive
for their indiscretion. Apart from the gay
and gruesome Frolics the show consists
mostly of the elay modellers and Bert Gil-
bert’s reckless racing speculation. A new
Nora (Eileen Robinson) helps listen to Gil-
bert’s fast and furious account of the dream
which came true, and there is more joy
among the gods over Bert’s supposititious
winner than over ninety-and-nine real- tips
that never came orf.
Una Bourne, beloved of Melbourne
concert-goers since she was a girleen, is giv-
ing a recital at the Town Hall next Thurs-
day, March 9.
Until Saturday night Tiie Bulletin
thought that the easiest way for a woman
to temporarily mislay all lxer loveliness .was
by violently chewing gum. But there is a
surer way. Let her place herself on a
dimly-lighted stage, have two strong spot-
lights thrown on her and then sing in a
loud voice with her mouth wide open. The
spotlights accentuate the shadows on her
face, make the wide-open mouth look like
the entrance to a dark cave and throw the
countenance out of focus. That is,, the im-
pression left after Gladys Moncrieff has
sung “Vilia” in “The Merry Widow” re-
vival at Sydney Majesty’s. “The Merry
Widow” will always be an acceptable lady
on account of the delightful music and danc-
ing and choruses. But Sonia, the widder
woman, has a lot to do with making an accept-
able show even more welcome; and Gladys
Moncrieff falls short of relicts that have
gone before. Leslie Holland is for the most
part Leslie Holland, and Phil Smith bears
a remarkable resemblance to himself; and
until this pair begin to differ from them-
selves they will be exceedingly popular. Zoe
Wenlce, who is Popoff’s? Wife, has a pleasing
voice and a taking way ; and Nellie Payne
is still waiting for the chance to do some-
thing big. With many other good qualities
Reginald Roberts still retains the nose which
has been in his possession for years; and
in that time- it has been put to a tremendous
lot of usp.

Andre Skalski, surely the youngest con-
ductor Sydney has known, is well repaid for
his enterprise in giving the orchestral Con-
cert on Saturday night. It was quite an old-
time Town Hall in regard both to the size
of the audience and the enthusiasm of the
applause that greeted the end of the first
number. This was the “Freischutz” over-
ture, and the slim, dark youngster with the
tragic eyes shepherded his musical flock till
it seemed as though it browsed on the Delect-
able Mountain. Another thing of beauty
was Andre’s qwn scoring of the waltz from
Rebikov’s “Christmas Tree.” The Schubert
and Schumann symphonies were two other
big items on a menu that also sparkled with
sweet .and light wines. At the close ; of
the heavy evening’s work the young man
was worn out, but revived under the storms
of applause that rocked the Town Hall, as
though it were a Manly ferry passing the
Heads. Or thereabouts.
Revival follows revival at Sydney Royal.
As The iulletin stampeded tni press a very
unpiratical-looking baritone —the same who,
about 14 hours before, had sung a plaintive
ballad to Dorothy’s kiss-curl —was explain-
ing to a ? peanut-munching gallery what a
Glorious Thing it in to be a Pirate King.
“The Gondoliers,” with Youth at the pyow
and Pleasure at the helm (if there is hny
helm, in a stage gondolaL will glide into
view on Saturday.

Sawing ladies in halves, freeing himhelf
from a straight jacket “while suspended: in
mi<3-air by the heels,” and struggling out of
an‘iron tank locked’; and filled j with water
(the tank, not the gentleman)•—-these are the
laitjest pastimes of Nicolai the Mysterious. His
show is to be seen at ‘the Sydney Criterion
unless l he has contrived, before this appears,
to get himself smothered or scragged.

Sydney Tivoli patrons had begun to adapt
themselves to a long life of quiet humor
of the Bard-Shields variety when the robust
W. J. Riokaby burst in on Saturday and
bombarded a hilarious audience with five
diverting numbers. “Major-General Worth-
ington” and the “Diddle Amurkan Song”
found bulls’-eyes; and, of course. there Was
“P.C. 40,” with an increased! leather-belt
circumference, but as clever as of old. ! A
star headliner, “Sawing a Woman j in
Halves,” provides an interesting interlude
aiid an incentive for a million fresh guesses.
The lady in the case gets the earnest atten-
tion of two men with a crosscut] saw, and, of
course, eiherges as good as new. Neil Me-
Innes, labelled entertainer, offers patter and
song, punctuated with hiccoughs, mostlv
about whisky. It is just as well some of
these turns are ticketed.

“The Sheik” is trailing his burnous across
the Sydney Globe sheet this week. There
is an English girl who disdains his love after
giving him the come-hither glance. Seizing
her one night wl-en she is gambolling across
the desert he swings her from the back of
her steed; but at the Great Moment the lady
turns upon him with the crucifix and foils
him with the Sign of the Cross. Then she
discovers that his old folks at home are
really Americans, and the close-up comes
with the Star-spangled banner and great
joy. Setting out as Youth Richard Bar-
thelemess drains the cup of Experience, and
what he doesn’t know- *about woman, wine
and song long before he is a baldhead makes
the youngster in the Lyric and Grand
benches yearn for half his luck. At the
Strand and Haymarket John Barrvmore
works overtime to make the “Lotos Eater”
a credible young man, but fails in the
attempt. At the Crystal Palace and Strand
Joe King and Diana Allen are respectively
Mam and Woman in another -slab of the
caveman methods that flappers are supposed
to love. It is nearly time they w'ere in-
vited to love something else.

Madeline Rossiter, for whom Adelaide
always had a special- fondness, dropped in
for a single evening lately at the English
Pierrots, and had a great welcome. "Babes
in the Wood” is just coming in at the Royal.
At the King’s the programme is mostly song
and talk, from -Jennie Hartley, Maud Court-
ney and the mere male who accompanies her,
or the. sound Viddish comedian Sam Stern.
The biggest score in the picture line goes
to Wondergraph, which was almost able to
convince the public that “capitalists” un-
named had tried to block the production of
EDMUND FISHER,
veteran Melbourne
critic.
“The' Whi s 11 e.”

Richard Barthel-
ness, at the York,
is a mixture of
romance and fight

of Virginia (“Tor-

West’s has a “Toll-

Thousands o f
Bulletin readers
will be glad to
meet Edmund
Fisher, who for 40
years has been
the paper’s theat-
rical critic in Mel-
bourne, and to
whose unimpaired
vigor with the pen
is now added an
experience pos-
sessed certainly by
nobody else in
Australia and pro-
bably by nobody
else in the world.
“Wealsman” on some Wfir Pictures:—
Lantern lectures, - with, fixed photographs on the
screen ' and an uninspired and fiat-voiced orator
making shadowy gesticulations and weary remarks
in the half-gloom of the platform, are necessarily
somewhat melancholy entertainments. But when,
as in the presentation of the Commonwealth s
Uncensored War Pictures in at least one capital city,
the show is given in a hall seven times too big for
■the audience and constructed with so little regani
for acoustics that a bull:voiced speaker could hardly
imake himself heard in the hack areas, and when
the lecturers are neither fluent in delivery nor clear
in enunciation nor f.a.q. in lung power well, 1
nominate it as the most depressing exhibition on
earth. ‘
Whatever advantage may exist in having these
war pictures “spoken to” by eye-witnesses like Bean
and Gullett and Gellibrand is surely outweighed by
the sufficiently obvious fact that the art of public
speaking has not been acquired by that trio. Also,
they seem to be handicapped by an unduly punctili-
ous observance of the very English rule that gentle-
men must never talk about themselves lest they
,should be thought self-assertive. This painful strain-
ing to achieve a reputation for strength by under-
statement should be cut right out of any programme
aiming to attract Australian audiences. The greatest
sinner of the trio in this-regard is General Gelli-
brand. The other hot night I paid three good
Australian shillings to hear him maunder from
Pozieres to Bullecourt. It sei~ned to me that a
man with no livelier imagination than that of a
pithed frog would have been hard put to it to talk
for an hour about that epic stunt of 1916-17 with-
out indulging to some extent in oratorical pyro-
technics. But Gellibrand stuck to his drab manu-
script like porridge to a blanket, and never once
let himself sparkle into a purple patch, though the
’ story fairiv bristled with dramatic potentialities.
'' If the heads of the Defence Department, or the
War Museum authorities, or whoever is responsible
for the present staging of Australia’s most Gupen-
dous historical event can do no better than thb.
then the sooner they get out of the show business the
more their countrymen will like them. Surely 7 the
great, thrilling story is worthy of something better
than an amateurish telling, "or the telling "by those
whose one-eyed interpretation of English manners
and customs has led them to regard all thrills as
deuced bad form, don’tcherknow. Are there no
Australian professional lecturers available? Perish
the suggestion ! I have heard at least one Australian
Digger, barely commissioned, tell his part of the
story of Mouquet Farm in a manner that lifted his
big audience to its feet in tears and cheers. Against
6uch a performance, unaided by pictures or music,
what do the authorities imagine Australians think
of the flat, dreary narrative of a Gellibrand, dr the
earnest though obviously hobbled oratory of a
Gullett or Bean? After all, it is perhaps merely
a matter of putting the right man where he belongs.
Let the fighters and writers stick to the job they
know and let the “spell-binders” retail the oral
goods. Given such a story to retail, imagine how the
windows would be dressed by public speakers of the
calibre of those introduced to us by the Much-
travelled Smythe, or the later orators of the Taits,
or the departed Alfreds, Deakin and Roberts, or
Holman, or Senator Tom Bakhap, or ex-Senator St.
Ledger!

“O.K.”: E. J. Carroll’s engagement of the
famous Cistercian Choir, from Rome, is
easily the biggest venture of its kind that
any Australian showman has been game to
risk. The first crowd of Jubilee Singers
brought here by Loudin and the Jungfrau
Kapelle with whom Hughes and Jinkins
made a nice little pile were only little lots
compared with the Cistercians who are to
open in Melbourne on April 15. The choir
comprises 60 voices, and wliat with musi-
cians, librarians, etc., Carroll will have 80
fares to pay. Talking of fares, one of the
artless Swiss yodellers aforementioned hap-
pened to die during the year they toured
Australia, and when Jinkins paid them their
final week’s salary and gave each Kapeller
his fare back to Switzerland, he was sur-
prised to see them whispering together. At
last a deputation waited upon him with a
request for the fare of the colleague who had
passed out.
“Lyre Bird”: Frank Hutchens will return
to Australia as piano-sparring partner of
Toscha Seidel, the Taits’ latest prodigy.
Hutchins, who came from M.L., got his edu-
cation with Matthay, London’s famous finger
gymnast, and he was on a further musical
pilgrimage to his beloved master when the
Taits netted him. Latei* on he will return to
his Con. studio in Sydney.
“Cremonensis”: J. and N. Tait (B.
2/2/’22), in defence of Spivakovsky, balance
the superlative criticisms of the Musical
News against the comparative coldness of the
Manchesteb Guardian. Very well; then
I will turn to the Musical News
(19/11/’2l) :
That Mr. Jascha Spivakovsky was a masterly
pianist, but given to exaggeration, was at once per-
ceived on his first English appearance in May. On
the 9th inst. he gave the impression of having culti-
vated a better sense of dynamic proportion. There
was more reason if less spontaneity in his treatment
of impassioned passages. Briefly he would seem
to be passing through the usual phases which precede
maturity.
The truth is that the Musical News, no less
than the Guardian, seems to recognise in
Spivakovsky another of those average
pianists of whom scores turn up in London
each year.
“Fax”: The scarecrow in the much-cur-
tained panto at Melbourne Majesty’s this
year must have reminded a good many people
of the late Johnnie Coleman, brother of the
scenic artist, who introduced the scarecrow
idea to Australia seven-and-twenty years
ago. What a truly humorous dancer was
there! And what a difference in the times
and the pantos since then! John Coleman
was one of the first of Riekards’s notable
importations, and one of his very best specs.,
for ’Arry booked the lean and nimble com-
edian for 12 months at £l5 a week, and
during that first year’s engagement lent him
to the Firm at £4O a. week to play a part
in “Djin-Djin.” Johnnie was then at his
best, yet Rickards had him for a popular
attraction at £l5 a week when required, and
made £25 a week profit on him when he
was not required! Subsequently J.C.W.
took Coleman on special engagements at a
higher figure, and so did Harry Rickards,
but never again was the established favorite
quite the Johnnie he had been in the first
year of his reign. Had they any one of
Coleman’s class in the J.C.W. panto this
year? Was there a company fit to asso-
ciate in one’s thoughts with the crowd of
comedians that Rickards collected for his
“Jack the Giant Killer” panto of 1897?
The Haytors, Tom Wootwell, George Lauri
and his wife, Albert Bellman, whose win-
some spouse, Lottie Moore, played principal
girl to the “boy” of Addie Conyers, a former
Gaiety star! Ivy Scott and Nellie Wdson
were among the also rans. The comedians
were too clever and too many, of course.
They clashed a bit, instead of playing up
to one another. But there they were. Enough
to leaven three or four of the panto lumps
one gets nowadays.
“B.I{.”: Though Allan Wilkie is a tradi-
tionalist in the presentation of Shnkspeare’s
plays, there is no reason why he should show
such slavish respect for every fatuity that
has come down from the bard. For in-
stance, everv ver-
sion of “Julius
Caesar” that I have
read makes the
potentate’s last
words to Brutus
the moth-eaten “Et
tu, Brute,” a n
allowable remark

ment, and used to play the character of a
fastidious man-milliner. He it was who
begged an angry madame not to so raise
her voice before the crgpe de Chine lest she
should interrupt its much-needed repose.
“Orb” : In recounting the bygone triumphs
of evergreen Nellie Mortyne, “Jud” (B.
23/2/’22) omits to record that the perennial
lady was the very charming ingenue in Her-
man Merivale-F. 0. Groves “Forget-me-not,”
with Genevieve Ward and W. 11. Vernon, at
the old Princess’s, ’way back in ’B3-84. She
was also the first Poppea in "Sign of the
Cross” in Sydney, and later on was the
original Aunt Martha in our first “Message
from Mars.” By the way, it is strange that
“Forget-me-not,” a most telling play, has
been shelved so long. It was revived at
Melbourne Opera House by Janet Achurch
in ’Ol, with George Leitch in his original part
of Prince Malleotti, but has not been done
since, I fancy.
“Peter” : Louis Bennison, who carries the
heaviest artillery in the cowboy drama,
“Johnny, Get Your Gun,” at Melbourne
Royal, is something more than a gunpowder
actor. He was leading man for awhile with
Marjorie Rambeau. one of Noo Yoik’s fixed
stars in romantic drama and comedy. Also,
he has roamed round a bit with the not-so-
youthful Nance O’Neil, and has played the
doctor, both on the stage and screen, in
Brieux’s “Damaged Goods.” Moreover, he
has a private passion for Shakspeare, and
any day he may be giving Shakspearean
recitals, without scenery, just to show Allan
Wilkie how some parts should be played.
“0.K.”: “T.R.H.” thinks I accused him
of faking the story of Irving’s collapse on
the stage after saying “Into Thy hands, O
Lord.” “I did not accuse, or even suspect,
the gentleman of being the originator of
the story: it dates back to the first telegram
and cables announcing Henry Irving’s de-
cease. As for my facts I simply referred to
Austin Brereton’s “Life of Henry Irving”
(page 334) :
On the Friday night, the 13th, he played
Beckett as impressively, as beautifully, as ever.
He then drove to his hotel with one of his staff,
Mr. J. W. Sheppard, but spoke never a word on
the journey. On arriving at the hotel he collapsed.
He was just able to murmur to Mr. Sheppard, “Give
me a chair,” was led to a couch in the hall, and died
at 10 minutes to 12 o’clock.
I take it that the long and stodgy “Life”
compiled by Austin Brereton, the old friend
and business man of Henry Irving, is as
good an authority as an “insignificant mem-
ber of Irving’s c 0.,” who “was on the stage
when the collapse *came.”
“Kapiti”: Maoriland is having a shot at
the film-making business. Annette Keller-
man has fixed up with Harry Waters, of
Everybody’s, Christchurch, to take the lead-
ing part in a home-made picture. Some of
the support is to be imported from U.S.A
The film will give Annette a chance to do
mermaid tricks, and incidentally show some
of the coast scenery of the shivery isles.
“Blackfriars”: Annie Abbott, the Little
Georgia Magnet who astonished variety
habitues 15 years back by defying the efforts
of men to lift her, is wiped out now
by a super-magnet who calls herself Resista,
which sounds like a cough mixture or
something to keep the snails away. When
this 7st. fragment, who has gone to Britain
with the blessing of the Rockefeller Institute,
takes her stand, three men cannot budge her
an inch. Unlike Annie Abbott, she doesn’t
bring arm or leg into play—just stands.
“Thorold Waters”: Fred Collier, who
threw a resonant baritone into Williamson
opera for some time, has found a place in
the National Opera Co., the co-operative
phoenix which has risen from the ashes of
Thomas Beecham’s fortune. He will be
one of its bass-baritones. The big basso of
the show is Robert Radford, who is sincere
to the point of sacrificing other more profitable
work in order to help steady British opera
up again.
“M.F.” : Kenneth Duffield, the still youth-
ful S. Australian whose tuneful music had
a good deal to do with the success of “Puss,
Puss” in London, has been collaborating
with Dion Titheradge, and they have up
their sleeve a big musical comedy which has
every hope of early production. Inciden-
tally, Duffield holds a brief for Andre Char-
iot, the Frenchman who gave him his first
contract, owns the leases of several London
theatres and already—aged only 38—has
produced 21 revues, besides many other
shows. “He’s a large, smiling man,” says
Duffield, “well liked by all his subjects and
a sort of father to all with whom he comes
in contact —unique among London managers,
as far ns I know.”
“T.W.”: The Carl Rosa operatists, who
have consented to a cut in screws all round,
never had very wonderful salaries, but theirs
was a constant job so long as they kept
their voices and their tempers. Occasionally
some star like John Coates would be takui
on for a few performances at comparatively
big 'money, but in the last eight or nine
years the Carl Rosa policy, even in the big
plunges into Covent Garden “off seasons,
has been to avoid the intrusion of outsiders.
Australian Beatrice Miranda and the other
regulars thus got whatever was going, and
the policy has held the combination together
in its times of stress.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : Melbourne native
Oswald Stoll has wrought a theatrical
miracle by transforming that colossal fiasco,
the Opera House in Ivingsway, into a brilli-
ant success. Built by the New York Jew,
Oscar Hammerstein, at a cost of more than
a million dollars, to wipe Covent Garden off
the earth, it was ignored by the Cockney
crowds and ended its opening chapter in
gloom and disaster. Hammerstein went back
to New York a wiser but poorer man. After
the house had been long a derelict Stoll took
it over, converted it into a picture-palace,
and at the annual meeting of shareholders
the other day announced a profit of ±sD,t>b.>
and a 15 per cent, dividend. Incidentally,

Nicola impersonates Bluey, an eccentric

Stoll criticised the recent decision of the
London County Council prohibiting the
admission of youngsters under 16, and men-
tioned that he was managing a music-hall
at the age of 15. It must be almost a record
in Anglo-Australian precocity.
“Hamfat”: Peel (whose name is some-
thing else) was, when I knew him years ago,
a man who insisted that his salary was
“never in any circumstances less than eight
quid a week, my boy.” When I suggested
that much money was to be made out of the
movies he declared he could never associate
himself with them —“Not art, sir ! Not art.
Last week I met him on the front of a
suburban picture-house looking so prosperous
that I thought he owned the place. “No, not
exactly,” he admitted. “As a matter of tact,
the salary is only four pounds five a week
but, then, you know, you get it!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miranda lay upon her bed
And bitter were the tears she shed,
And heavy was her heart as lead;
A sorry sight was she.
The cause of it, a worthless brute,
Young Cuddleford, a dissolute
And callous wretch of ill repute,
Strode homeward jauntily.
Young Cuddleford, a social flame,
Had earned himself a wicked name
That stirred a flood of righteous shame
In every female breast.
On women, wine and song and such
Pursuits he showed a master touch ;
He didn’t drink or sing so much,
But made up on the rest.
When first he met Miranda, he
Had chatted with her pleasantly;
’Twas down at Brighton by the Sea.
They strolled along the shore ;
The girl endeavored to preserve
An outward show of steely nerve,
And treated him with cold reserve—
She’d heard of him before.
She tried to dodge him, but in vain,
And once or twice they met again ;
At this stage she could not complain
Of any disrespect.
She was, of course, a trifle scared ;
She knew the things the fellow dared
And for his move was quite prepared.
She knew what to expect.
Miranda, let it here be said,
Had from her infancy been fed
On quite a stern and holy dread
Of ev’ry worldly sin.
Unconsciously she caught the pose
Of calm, unsullied pride that goes,
In all the moving-picture shows,
To make a heroine.
As Cuddleford sought more and more
To take her walking by the shore
A little oath Miranda swore
To rescue him from vice;
And when to dine he asked her out,
She answered “Yes,” and had no doubt
Her chance would come to put to rout
His boldness in a trice.
And so Miranda planned and guessed
How he would crush her to his chest
And scatter hairpins east and west,
The while she struggled free.
Then she would storm upon the cur ;
While he just crawled and cringed to her,
She’d criticise his character
And crush his dignity.
The night arrived. She seemed to wear
A whitebait net of pattern rare;
An osprey shining in her hair
Completed her array.
They dined, and saw the shadows fall.
He took her home; beside the wall
He squeezed her hand, and that was all,
Then softly went away.
Miranda lay upon her bed
And bitter were the tears she shed,
And heavy was her heart as lead;
Her pulse grew slow and weak.
The cause of it, a worthless brat,
Young Cuddleford, the plutocrat,
Strolled homeward all unconscious that
She broke her heart with pique!
VICTORIA.

The result of the Futurity Stakes at Caul-
field was to reduce tlie Newmarket to a question of
what can beat Eurythmic. Not that the great horse
scored the sort of win associated with famous
sprinters. He appeared to want nearly every yard of
the seven furlongs, and his performance was not as
convincing a trial for the flutter next Saturday as
that of Rostrum, Dunwil and Blue Cross in the
Hawlcsburn Handicap. All the same, Eurythmic set
people wondering whether there can be arty stopping
a horse that wins the Futurity with lOst. 71b. up.
Wish Wynne and Demetrius will meet him on rather
better terms next Saturday, but the larger piece of
weight off their backs will not amount to moie,
comparatively, than the reduction in -his. If Euiftn-
rnic gets away nicely, and has a fairly clear run on
the outside of the course, his backers may expect him
to beat Demetrius and the trusty mare once again.
Isa, Braehead and Carilla look quite as likely, or
more so, to turn the taoles on Eurythmic. Most
punters, however, will wisely refuse to think of
anything save the freak horse being a possible
‘•good thing.” If the writer prefers Rostrum,
Dunwil, Blue Cross and St. Ronans, giving'also a
hope to Lisnavane and Battleplane, it is" because all
six of them have first-class sprinting credentials,
have made a good showing down Flemington
and are unpenalised, whereas to expect the victory'
of Wish Wynne is to argue that she was positively
thrown into the race at her original weight..
The only thing against Rostrum thus far is that
he was left at the barrier in the Bouvke Handicap
after he had run second in the Newmarket last year.
Dunwil is notoriously a troublesome horse at the
barrier, and got badly away in the Epsom when
Beauford beat him. The only objection to Blue
Cross is advancing age, the trouble with Lisnavane is
that she sometimes lets her friends down badly, and
the doubt about St. Ronans is as to whether he ever
will prove quite as good as he looks, or is rumored to
be. The safest three to fancy for the Newmarket, per-
haps, are the most heavily backed ones —Dunwil,
Eurythmic, Rostrum. The last named, who seemed
to fairly outpace Dunwil last Saturday, is a fine
looking animal, and was good enough to run second
last year. Eurythmic has to give Rostrum 371 b. and
although he might do that easily enough with a
good balance of luck in his favor, the writer doubts
whether the champion is likely to pave the best of
the luck with a bunch of practised sprinters that
rarely fail to get away quickly. If one of the under-
7-stone division is to win] it should be St. Ronans.
A promising lot for the Australian. Cup are The
Rover, Stare, Amazonia, Sister Olive, Harvest King,
King of the Forest, Mufti and Earl of Seafield. Only
three times in 15 years has the winner’s weight
touched 8 stone, and not once within that period
has a three-year-old done the trick; yet one is
tempted to fancy Sister Olive with 7st. 12lb. aboard,
on the ground that staying is.her hobbv, and she has
done uncommonly well since;, winning Melbourne Cup.
Earl of Seafield ran a good race in the Woodcliff
Handicap, in which Mufti downed him, but his
reputation for stamina is purely r Westrgliart; at; pre-
sent whereas King o. ...e Forest won a- 14 furlongs
race’ at Randwick in October.. They can’t all be in
the picture, however, at the end’ of the long, long
journey next Tuesday. The writer prefers Sister
Olive, then Mufti and The Rover.
Eurythmic has now credited his owner, Lee
Steere with £31,501 in stake-money, which is £1875
more than Carbine won for Dan O’Brien and Donald,
Wallace. But beating Carbine’s record for stakes
winnings is a very different matter to rivalling his
record in handicap races.' Eurythmic. who already
has run two “nowheres” in Melbourne Cups, com-
Dared with a second and a first by the old original
champion, has now side-stepped his chance to cut a
figure in both the Newmarket and Australian Cup.
He was scratched for the long race last week.
Carbine in 1889 was entered for the two events, and
was placed in both. Carrying Bst. 121 b. as a three-
year-old he came third in the sprint to the light-
weight Sedition and the heavyweight Lochiel, the
last-named having won it two years earlier. And in
the Australian Cup young Carbine was second with
Sst Gib. to mighty Lochiel, who was giving him a
pound only. It was the only year he was entered
tor either race, and after sustaining those two
honorable defeats he won three w.f.a. races at the
meeting, two of them on one day. Then Carbine
went to Sydney and ran five races in four days, llie
first was a defeat by Abercorn, a great horse over
10 furlongs, buiS-the four wins following included the
Sydney Cup with 9st. aboard —a tidy weight for a
three-year-old. # #
Had Thespian downed Gloaming in the
Jackson Stakes at Wanganui (M.L.) on Saturday it
would have made a lot of difference to the sale of
the eight Absurd yearlings auctioned after the
races. Not only Gloaming but Tamatete finished m
front of Mr. Currie’s colt. The babies averaged
675 guineas, Thespian’s brother realising 1600.
“Earl of Seafield”: Father O’Grady, who
looks after an extensive parish in Jarrahland, has
for a hack the Perth Cup and Imperial Stakes winner
Lucky Escape. Posinatus also belongs to a priest.
But Lucky is much younger than Possy, and if the
padre ever turns his thoughts to the turf there may
be a race or two in the son of Bobadil yet.

Mina Wylie, by annexing the 440yds. Aus-
tralian championship at Hawthorn (Vic.) baths from
Lily Heaurepaire (Vic.) and Lily Robertson(N.S.W-),
now holds- all the free-style titles. But her time,
finiin. 50sec., was 14sec. slower than that notched by
Mina when she defeated her famous rival, Fanny
Durack, in a 440yds. test event recently. Elsio
Venning vanquished Mina in the 100 yds. breast-
stroke Championship in lmin. 30sec. —2 l-ssec. slowet
than her ' world’s best time for the distance. Thus
the iua State swimmers captured every free-style
title. However, they are going to be troubled by
the fleet mermaids of Maoriland. Pauline Hoeft,
who recently won her first Dominion championship
by heading Gwitha Shand over 100yds. in 67 4-6 sec..
has since swum the distance in 66 3-ssec., which is
only 3 l-ssec. outside Ethelda Bleibtrey’s world’s

minutes finished fourth. By some misunderstanding
times were not taken.
Bessie Grandemange (Sydney) showed a
trim pair of heels to Maud McDermott (Ardlethan)
in a 100-yards challenge race on Saturday. BeSsie
was syds. to the good at 50yds., and sped over the

(11 2-ssec.) established at Mudgee in 1916.

In their final appearance at Wellington the
Springboks met Maoriland’s best, and honors were
easy. J. K. Ayres-Oosterlaak (Transvaal) won the

in lOsec. ; and in the
220yds. he beat J. W.

which equals W. A. Wood-

took the 10-mile international scratch from Munro and

field won the mile scratch in 2min. 24 3-ssee., and
Kaltenbrun caught W. Muir (Q.) in a 10-lap pur-
suit. Les Munro, however, put a smudge on their
record by taking the five-mile scratch in tha good
time of 12min. 25sec. from E. Stidwell and Kalten-
brun. Two assaults were made on the Queensland
half-mile unpaced record, and after Munro had lopped
it from 61 l-10sec. to 601 sec., Thursfield reduced it
still further to 59 3-10 see.

At Svdney on Saturday Jim Anderson,, the

was heavy and sloppy, conditions which hardly suited
the tall Victorian, but Anderson is his fasten
Patterson won the first set comfortably, and th
second see-sawed till Anderson ran out at 9 J;
Thereafter it was Anderson all the way. He gave
a great exhibition of clean hitting and brilliant
cross-court play. The Victorian excelled in serving,
but his backhand was weak. Anderson the winner

(N.S.W.), another of the Davis Cup team, met
Patterson in languid mood and won by 7 a, l b,

(country champion) defeated Anderson and Miss
Lance (N.S.W. champion) after a long-drawn-out
tussle (13 —11, ■j —7, 6 —l) ; and Anderson and
Clarence Todd were always too good for Patterson
and R. V. Thomas (10 —8, 6 —3). Miss Cox s
display was excellent. # #
“15-30”: Tennis supporters are agreed
that Patterson. Anderson and O’Hara Wood are cev-
tainties for Australia’s next Davis Cup team, it
available, but they are divided between Brookes and
Hawkes for fourth place. Personally, 1 favor the
veteran. Allowing that he is finished aft a singles
player and has not his old alertness in the doubles,
he is still a man of uncanny, wisdom and judgment,
and as a mere M.C. directing the game of the others
he would be invaluable. Hawkes I have never re-
garded as a man of international rank, and all his
good work in America has not altered my opinion
that he is a three-set champion .capable of good play

“Old Hand”: Jack Blackman is gone. He
was a N. S. : Wales rowing enthusiast for a half a
century and a nrince of good fellows. When 1
knew him first he was a boss and I a boy in a
softgoods business in Pitt-street, Sydney. That was
in 1876, when Jack became captain of the Mercam
tile Rowing /Club. In those days he sported a Paget
coat of" Victorian cut ahd dark pants to match, and
the style!,never varied much in after days. Fashions
didn’t worry Jack. I was coxswain in a boat when
Jack got the news (it was in November, 1880) that
Ned Trickett had been walloped on the Thames by
Harlan. Jack was disconsolate. “Have anv of you
coves a lame brother or a crippled relative?’’ ha
said. “I’ll have to fight somebody or bust.” Ha
took Trickett’s defeat as a national calamity.

toss from Mayne, Richardson, the S. Aus. captain,
sent his men in. but barring Rundell (45), Towns-
end (29) and Smith (26) they shaped feebly against
Keating and Wallace, the Richmond express, and
fell for 160, Wallace taking 4 for 24 and Keating
4 for 28. Before stumps were drawn Victoria had
made 141 without loss —Mayne 82, O’Keefe 51. All
next day they remained in possession, and the last
wicket fell on the third day for 625. O’Keeffe’s
contribution was TBO, made in 273 minutes, Rans-
fqrd’s 129, Cody!s 107 and Mayne’s 85, Woodfull
remaining not out with 22. The colt batted under
difficulties, his left hand having been lacerated while
fielding. Smith (72), Richardson (21) and Run-
dell (30) gave the Croweaters a fair start in their
second innings, but then O’Keeffe got on the spot,
and at the end of the day’s play six wickets were
down for 194, the new champion having taken five
of them for 45.
These are O’Keeffe’s scores since he threw in his lot
with Carlton:—6, 127 m0.,.63, 10, 12, 96 n.o. (ail
in pennant matches), 87 and 79 (v. N. S'. Wales),
177 and 144 (for the Rest v. Australian XI), 180
(a S. Aus.). Aggregate, 981 ; average 109. And
he wasn’t reckoned good enough for Sydney grade
cricket.
Sydney had its usual wet week-end and
grade cricket had to be played on moist wickets. In
the circumstances hitting was the game, and the
finest display of the afternoon was given by Moyes,
the ex-Victorian, who knocked up 62 in a tick over
30 minutes for Gordon against St. George. Gordon
made 345, J. M. Taylor, the international, contribut-
ing 52, Watts 88 (made in an hour and a quarter)
and Hoskins 60 not out. For Mosman v. Glebe
Anderson "got 5 wickets for 35, Kelleway notching
42 of Glebe’s 93. Clemenger, of Western Suburbs,
sent five Waverley men to the pavilion for 51, but
the tail-enders batted spiritedly and Waverley’s total
was 151. Petersham reached 250 against Sydney.
Andrews top-scoring with 51. while Asher collected
4 for 71. Between showers University (Rock 52
and Bardsley 42) lost 4 for 124 v. Paddington. Love
(59) saved Balmain (149) from being obliterated by
Randwick, for whom Shea got 4 for 55 and Merchant
3 for 33. No play was attempted in Norths v.
Marrickville and C. Cumberland v. Manly.

Soft wickets gave the bowlers a chance to
improve their averages in Melbourne district cricket
on Saturday. The biggest disaster befell Hawthorn-
East, who lost to ’Wood by an innings and 7*.
The Magpies, resuming at 2 for 131, closed with
9 for 256, and skittled the enemy in their second
hits for 39, Ooppoek getting 6 for 13. Essendon,
with two absent, had an even worse experience on
going in again to face University. They scratched
up 32 (Eltham 4 for 6, and L. Freemantle 2 for
8), and lost by an innings and 22. The students
didn’t seem to find the wicket so difficult, since they
scored 6 for 196, Porter contributing 102. The
argument between P’ran and ’Cote would have been
close if it had been played
out. ’Cote, making' 196,
won on the first hits by
11 runs, Wootton, of
P’ran, bagging 6 for 61.
But in response to P’van’s
second total of 66 (Bur-
ley 6 for 22, and K. L.
Carroll 4 for 22) ’Cote,
without/ their stand-by,
Hartkopf, finished with 4
for 27, to which that
valiant performer “Ex-
tras” contributed 12.
Melbourne, who were 16
behind Saints on thy first
innings, made a desperate
effort to get a straight-
out win. But closing at
5.10 with 7 for 91 in
their second try, they
couldn’t massacre Saints,
who clung to the wicket
, for over an hour,, leaving
four 1 /dead for 15 runs.
Richmond beat North on
' the first* hits by 84. There
was only about an hour’s
play on the bog at Carl-
ton, 'Roy losing 1 for 32
after - the locals had de-
clared with 3 for 202, in-
cluding an unfinished 96
by O’Keeffe, who was very
busy in Adelaide.

The Vic.-Tas. match at Launceston was
a beanfeast for the batsmen. Going in first, the visi-
tors knocked up 550, of which W. Ponsford (St.
Kilda) got 162 and Remington 91. Tasmania
replied with 358 (Newton 117, Davis 56 and Butlef
54), and 275 for 6 wickets. An aggregate of 1183
for 26 wickets in three days is lively cricket an
things go. The game was drawn.

The poor standard of professional boxing
in Australia is largely due to the lordly contempt
of promoters for home-grown talent. Preference to
foreigners is their utterly rotten policy, distance
lending enchantment to the bruiser. Tom Heaney,
champion heavyweight of Maoriland, a youth of
abundant promise, came over to N. S. Wales a month
or two ago, but had to go to North Queensland
to get a fight. Griffin, a fast and hard-hitting
brother of Jim and Charlie of old, was
frozen out of Sydney, and has been boxing men
stones heavier than himself (he is a. welterweight)
in country towns. But any Yank who blows into
town with a mouthful of chewing-gum and a bundle
of press cuttings can get a match, which will turn
him in anything from £lOO to £5OO, at one of
the Stadiums. Such is Joe Simonich, who met
Charlie Ring at the Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night and lost every round of the 20 fought.
Simonich is game, but his punches were ineffetiive t .
and he had no stop for Ring’s left. In all proba-
bility Griffin could settle him in i'a few_ rohnds.
But the stoush impresarios have been bitten by
the importing craze, and the Griffins, Heaneys and
Bradleys have got to stand aside for third-rate
foreigners.

Stanley Mcßride, one of the latest crop of
importations, met Packy Me Far la ne, tile improving
Newcastle fedder, at Sydney on Saturday night, and
lost by a hatful of points. He looked* like being
onted in the first round, when a left on the ,iaw
felled him for three seconds, but stayed the full 20.

“Wagtail”: Who is the oldest retired
uruiser in Australia? I nominate “Bristol Bill”
Williams, who fought many a battle with the raw
’uns at the Red Bluff (now Elwood) in the ’sixties
and ’seventies, and is still on deck at 84. Bills
toughest fight went. 70 rounds, and the winner’s cut
was £25. The old ’un recently underwent an opera-
tion without chloroform, which shook him up a bit,
but he looks good for many a year yet.

Jamito is ambitious to wipe the grin off
the victorious countenance of Harry Stone, and a
match is likely in Melbourne at an early date. A
desire to stoush Stone has been brewing within the
Filipino for some time past, but after the Stone-
Edwards fiasco the other night, the lust for Henry s
blood became very marked and talk of a meeting
was revived. The Hebrew is perfectly willing to
face the cyclone, but he stipulates for a 9st. 81b.
limit, whereas his dusky opponent reckons that 9st.
61b. ought to be a fair thing. If Jamito is so wild
for a fight, he shouldn’t be worried by a little
matter of 21b. But, perhaps, after all, it is only his
manager talking.

given to the Whisky which now occupies a foremost place in the market.

OBJECTS OF COMPANY. To take over and carry out two contracts with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, whereby the Company agrees to
establish and maintain aerial mail, passenger and light-freight services between ADELAIDE, Mildura, Hay, Narrandera, Cootamundra, SYDNEY, Newcastle,
Kempsey, Ballma, Grafton and BRISBANE.
These contracts provide that the Commonwealth Government will pay the Company—
SUBSIDIES TOTALLING £29,000 PER ANNUM.
This investment must not be confused with haphazard attempts at irresponsible flying without efficient management arid organisation.
EXTRACTS FROM “THE BULLETIN” REVIEW:
“Australian Aerial Mail Services, Ltd. —Several
ambitious air ventures have been before the public in
recent years, but they have either crashed or never
developed wings. Captain H. J. Larkin unfolds
another scheme which has a stronger appeal....
Expenses are set down at under £,28,300, which is
a few hundreds less than the Government contracts
to pay in the first year. The prospectus puts it
another why: it includes 8 p.'c. on £60,000 of
capital with costs and shows that only £4066 of
revenue has to be wpn. from passengers and freights
to make that rate of div. possible if the Government
continues its subsidy on the scale fixed for the first
year. A feature of the float is that there is to be
no outlay on aerial surveys, etc.: the fleet will use
the Government landing stations.”
The prospects of this Company are
above the average, and investors
seeking a good return on, their
capital should apply for full Pros-
pectus to:—
EXTRACTS FROM REVIEW BY JOHN S. McINNES, F.1.C.A.,
BRISBANE' “DAILY MAIL”
“From an airman’s point of view the company will be well equipped,
for, it has attached to .its staff five of the most experienced and efficient
airmen in Australia, and the aeroplanes to be used are of the most modern
type. From a commercial point of view investors may confidently expect
tn'eir interests to be well cared for, the chairman of directors being Mr.
H. B. Howard Smith, of shipping fame.
“If one passenger only per trip is carried between capital cities, the
profit is estimated at 10 per cent, per annum.
“No capital expenditure is required for establishing landing stations,
this matter having been attended to by the Commonwealth Government,
which has established them at regular intervals between the capital cities.
“The Government will be required to be satisfied that everything is in
order so that the company will commence operations under the most
favorable auspices.
“The services are to be conducted on the most up-to-date lines and
equal to anything in existence in England and the Continent. The engines
a : re the well-known Rolls-Royce make, which were used in the historic
flight across the Atlantic, from England to Australia, England to South
Africa and England to India. . • .
“From independent evidence furnished to us it is apparent that the
air service companies in England and the Continent have attained a very
high state of efficiency. The average citizen is quite unable to realise
tbe extent to which flying is taking its place as a means of international
transit. In September iast the number of passengers carried between
Great Britain and the Continent was 8488 as against 3435 in the
previous April, and the number is steadily increasing.’ , .
~ “The prospectus sets out a very fair statement of the proposition,
which appears to be a reasonable one on the whole, and founded on
businesslike lines.”
EXTRACTS FROM REVIEW BY ALEX: JOBSON.
MELBOURNE “HERALD,” SYDNEY “TELEGRAPH,” BRISBANE
“TELEGRAPH.”
“The company .is being . fosiaed . ,to acquire from the Larkin Aircraft
Supply Co., Ltd., contracts with the Federal Government, whereby the
Government is to pay subsidies of £29,000 yearly for an aerial transport
service: of : one trip each: way weekly* between Adelaide, Sydney and Bris-
bane, carrying mails, passengers and light freights. The contracts are
only for one year, which militates against their value. It is estimated
that the annual cost of such services will be £28,266. The estimates
appear to be reasonable, so far as it has been possible to check the figures.
The company will be saved the expense of establishing landing stations, as
these are to be prepared by the Commonwealth Government. As -the
Government subsidy is 4s. 2d. the company will be on the right side if
its estimates are not exceeded. Moreover all the revenue from passengers
and freights will be profit. If on the average two passengers from Adelaide
to Sydney and return, and three passengers from Sydney to Brisbane and
return, are carried weekly, the revenue from this source alone! on the
fares scheduled, would be £9OOO yearly, representing 1 per cent, on a
share capital of £60,000. There seems a reasonable chance that at least
dividends of 8 per cent., as mentioned in the prospectus, will be earned.
“This proposition has a distinct advantage over any previous aviation
flotation placed before investors, in that the company will commence
business with a guaranteed revenue 6f £29,000, which it is estimated
will exceed the annual expenditure. Some of the schemes hitherto pro-
pounded had expectations of obtaining a Government contract, though
most of them had no expectations of a guaranteed revenue worth mention-
ing. The scheme appears to he drawn up on sound lines.”

The cot endowment isn’t enough: the Vic-
torian Marys insist on sending a personal
wedding-gift to the Princess. “Let the girl
have a present!” said the Mayoress. So a
gold portrait-frame is being made and
studded with opals like raisins in a plum-
duff. It will go to eke out > the meagre
collection of Mary’s jewels just reported
from London. “The girl” has u diamond
and sapphire necklace so large and heavy
that it can only be worn in sections; a few
hundredweight of pearls, diamonds, emeralds
and rubies; bracelets from her brothers;
necklaces from her Queen Mother and a
chain of matched diamonds from Londoners.
King George gave the bridegroom a silver

There was great excitement at Caulfield
on Saturday when Eurythmic beat Carbine’s
stake-money record. It was as if Carbine’s
very ghost was racing in the Futurity
Stakes. When the chestnut passed the post
the whole course seemed to go mad and there
was a tornado of yells and cheers and hand-
clapping. The crowd itself was a record.
Neither G.-G. nor State Governor was there,
but members of their house parties tucked
themselves into the vice-regal pen. Sensibly
severe tailoring was the order of the day.
and women wete no more conspicuous in
their dress than the men folk in comfy
tweeds. Mrs. Winter Irving’s knitted white
frock of sheer silk was rather tricky, and
the little Browne girl managed to light up
the scenery with wide yellow stripes on her
grey gown. Mrs. Mein tied her black hat
under her chin with a cunning ribbon and
wore grey-and-black silk. Mrs. Pitt Rivers
was in all black except for the gold em-
broidery on her veil. Nowadays veils are
really masks —the features disappear behind
big embroidered figures. Mrs. Woodforde
was smartly tailored in grey. Mayoress
Swanson wore black cloth and fringed gloves
that reached her elbows. Francis Syme
walked the lawn with his new bride, she in a
smart navy coat-dress, chalk-lined in red and
white. Mrs. Denison wore a smart cape-
coat of wonderful cut. Mrs. Cooper put
flame-colored tassels on her ultra-short navy
frock. Mrs. Buchanan haunted the bird
cage with a sporty air and a grey lustre suit
The smart woman walks the lawn now on
grey legs—whatever color the tailored suit
is, the well-aired limbs must be grey socked
and grey shod.
New Archgaiters Lees is determined to be
“popular,” and doesn’t care who Lnows it
He is more like an ardent, meteoric revivalist
than the conventional arch, of an Anglican
throne. He is a little man, with thick, broad
shoulders and a thick, broad accent, and a
fine aquiline profile, though seen full-face the
thick cropped brush of black hair and the
close-set black eyes take away the eagle look
and remind you more of an alert terrier. He
likes to be looked on as a sport, and makes
much of a picture of himself “kicking-off”
at football.
The new man intends to get well about the
country and into the Backblocks. In these
days of motors this should be comparatively
easy. Pioneer Bishop Perry, that severe
and classical-looking cleric, was a keen man
on country work, but his journeys on horse
and foot were heartbreaking.
The Governor and Lady Stradbroke give
many unrecorded and unofficial dinner-dances
at Stonington. The Countess is uncom-
monly good to the sassiety flapper and her
young man. Twenty or thirty are gathered
together by ’phone for dinner, and there is
the inevitable jazz afterwards. The recent
fancy-dress ball was built up from one of
these dinners, and grew into an affair of a
couple of hundred guests in the most in-
formal way.
Gerald Grove has taken on the job of
private secretary to the Earl. He is the
third since his Ex. arrived a year ago. Neil
Smith was the first, and then Haggard
agreed to act temporarily. It is not that
Stradbroke is hard to please, but it isn’t
easy, apparently, to get the ideal man.
On Friday night Adelaide Allan and Dr.
McLorinan 'staged a cheery farewell at the
Lyceum Club for singer Anne Williams,
who dimpled happily in gold brocade veiled in
ninon, with gold and blue roses flowering
between. Miss Allan was in misty black,
and the medical hostess in .shimmering blue.
Dame Nellie, trailing black lace draperies
with a headachey band of red leaves, was the
star guest. She was in great form and
prefaced a few complimentary remarks to
the singer with “Dear Anne Williams.”
She also applauded Anne’s song number with
warmth. Una Bourne sounded the grand
piano twice, and a M.L. tenor warbled the
hackneyed “Poi Song” with some skill.
Louie Dunne created a great impression
with a dramatic recital followed by a lighter
turn. Here again Dame Nellie led the ap-
plause. The social world and the leading
musical highbrows mingled happily, supper
was a pleasing incident, and all round it was
a lovely party.
Mrs. Glencross, president of the House-
wives’ Association here, is a Tasmanian.

Mayoress Swanson and a crowd of charity
committee-women had a party in the boudoir-
rooms at the Town Hall last Thursday as
a send-off to Mrs. Tallis, who departs with
her husband for a world tour. In war-
work and charity collections no one has
been more energetic than she.. Her com-
mittee friends presented her with a wallet
in a big basket of flowers, and the lady, m
quiet fawn-silk duds and a vivid tomato-
red hat, said “Thank you,” but baulked at
a speech. An elaborate tea was spread
among flowers, and consumed to music.
Dr. Frank Nyulasy has just got back from
a Cold Country trip with more . medical
honors in his bag. * When medicine isn’t
having his attention Shakspeare gets it. He
has long argued that Othello was a soldier
with a golden-brown skin, and not an Orient-
ally-robed blackamoor, and a paper uphold-
ing that view is to be read at this year’s
annual Shakspeare service at Stratford-on-
Avon.
. The South Yarra Kiddle sisters hired the
Frank Walkers’ reception parlors for their
musical frivol the other night. This was
by way of prelude to the elder .sister’s mar-
riage with the Evelyn Snodgrass -they
had to get in early with the party to fore-
stall the Lenten season, after which comes
• the wedding. The bride-elect stood hand-
somely in pastel-blue crepe draperies
wreathed at the waistline with pink and
blue silk roses, while smaller patterned
silk flora enwreathed her massed locks of
fair hair. Her clerical fiance created more
than a spiritual impression as he glode
round immaculately tailored in knee-
breeches, silk stockings and buckled shoes,
with his front waistcoated in silk under a
natty black-tailed coat. The Best People
swished round in their up-to-datest draperies.

No actor or actress

Marguerite Nielka —that cousin of Lady
Denman who used to be reported as doing
spectacular dances in the Naicest quarters
in London, and is a singer, too —has decided
to go for a seat in the Commons at the

the weird idea of singing her way into the
heart of a constituency—no campaign
speeches; merely music—“ ‘You sang, sir,
you say. Go then,’ said the ant, ‘and sing
abuses away.’ ”
Mrs. Charlotte Cameron had a great time
in the Apple Island. The medical Ram-
says showed her round Launceston. In
Hobart Mayoress Snowden gathered together
a crowd to meet her, and Mrs. Tom Murdoch
gave a supper-party in her honor. _ Mrs.
Murdoch took her to Craigin, the original
home of the Murdoch family, where cen-
tenary junketings are to held on March 3.
She prowled about Port Arthur, and was
given some delightful motor runs on the
country roads before returning to Melbourne
last week.

butter between whiles
from a Government
job. Returning to
Melbourne, he settled
in Heidelberg, and found enough pictures
around him to last him for the rest of his
life. His present show is his first attempt
to fill a hall with his work. In Sydney one
or two of his efforts invited buyers in Royal

volume. The hundreds of portraits con-
firmed his view as an old soldier that no-
thing was ever more warrior-like than the
faces of the Diggers. As for the fallen they
were, he said, the very Flowers of the Forest,
Greater tribute the old woodsman could not
pay.
Marcus Collins, of the Geelong woollen
mills, and his wife are touring the Speck.
He is an ardent angler and took over a
motor-boat with, his fishing tackle, his car
and his baggage. Mrs- Collins is one of the
frockiest of Western District dames, and
makes Melbourne take notice when she en-
tertains here.
Acting-Governor Nicholls, of the Speck,
is not in residence at Government House, but
the ballroom there is to be used for a dance.
The matrons of Hobart are also giving a
ball for the officers of the Fleet.
M. P. Hansen, who is to start on a Euro-
pean-Ameriean tour to pick up hints for
the Education Department, of which he
will be the next Director, was given a send-
off dinner at the week-end. Frank Tate did
the honors from the head of the table.
Roy Bridges, writer and novelist, has re-
joined the Age staff, and is on outdoor work.
.T. T. Miller, the new Sheriff, sat beside
Schutt, J., on the Criminal Court bench when
the jury said Colin Campbell Ross had mur-
dered 12-year-old Alma Tirtschke. Unless
Boss’s appeal to the three Judges results in
an order for a new trial, Miller will pro-
bably be stiil more in evidence on a Monday
morning in the near future.
Little Mrs. Jack Turnbull snaps her
fingers at superstition. After marrying on
a Friday and setting off on her honeymoon
tailored in green, she will begin housekeep-
ing in a house numbered 13. The place, which
is in Domain-street, South Yarra, belongs
to the Fred Fairbairns, who, now that their
family have all married, think a flat would
shelter them more comfortably. It was at
a jazz in this No. 13 that Edward P.
created a flutter by invading the host’s
dressing-room and rigging himself and
cousin Louis up as The Mad Hatter and
Little Tich. In “The Voyage of the Re-
nown”, the incident is mentioned as a frisky
Harbor City happening.
Mrs. Jim Ainslie, the medical Lemprieres’
only chick, hostessed an afternoon tea at her
South Yarra place on Friday afternoon. It
was to meet an aunt who, after many years
in the Cold Country, blew into Melbourne
and is now hurrying back again to collect
her pet pui3. The hostess fluttered graces
fully in pink frocking, and her mother and
aunt helped to pass the cakes.
Una Bourne promises a recital in the Town
Hall on March 9. This is the first time
she has had a moment to tackle a programme
“on her own” since she lobbed back from
the Other Side, as Dame Nellie has kept her
busy. Una is even more popular than when
she went away nine years ago, and her
modesty has not waned one jot. She lacks
all the airs of your successful artist; yet
she has “arrived” good and hard. In thfe
Cold Country recently she took the place erf
the great Busoni at a moment’s notice, and
the audiences hailed her work with joy.
The Shakspeareans are planning a pageant
in the Town Hall for the first week in April
Miss Hunter-Watts, who will be here at
that time, is to lend her stellar rays to the
show.
The fuss about the memorial for the Big
War made, folk think it time to finish the
uncompleted South African cenotaph in
St. Kilda-road. And now there’s a pretty
pother about that, too. They have dis-
covered an uncharted drain beneath it —a
big channel that runs to the Albert Park
lagoon—and the monument is ‘‘settling.”
The whole memorial should be shifted, but
there is no money available to move the
tons and tons of stone. And meantime
the poor old thing is very gradually going
underground.
Thirty old public-school boys are planning
a jazz in the St. Kilda Town Hall on Boat
Race night—May 12.
Seventeen stained-glass windows Lave been
presented by parishioners and friends to
the Church of the Immaculate Conception,
Haw-Hawthorn, to adorn the additions to
the building (now a fane of cathedral pro-
portions), which are nearly finished. Mrs.
Goll and Mrs. T. Hogan made up £BBB be-
tween them for the largest window, repre-
senting the Crucifixion. ,
Adelaide passes on a word or two: —
The vice-regals have gone to their summer resi-
dence, Marble Hill, for a few weeks.
Lady Weigall is appealing for support for a
juvenile revue, to he given in the Prince of Wales
Theatre for several nights. It is being organised
by Mrs. Dellcourt in aid of the Babies’ Home at
Walkerville, and Priscilla is to appear in a solo
dance.
The Rev. W. G. Marsh and his wife have just re-
turned after a 10-months’ trip to America, where
they have been on a visit to his sister in Massa-
chusetts. Mr. Marsh brought greetings to newspaper
men from Mr. Rathom, a Melbourne boy, who was
educated at Whinham College, Adelaide, and is
now editor of the Providence Journal. No U.S.
journalist was more quoted than Rathom during the
two years before Sam joined in the war.
Evelyn Harvey, of Kensington, and Audrey
Shapter, of McLaren Vale, are the winners this
year of the Gill memorial medal for the best example
of. applied art. The former’s winning exhibit was
a worked tablecloth, with a design of wild flowers,
and she is now entitled to a scholarship at the craft
classes at the School of Art for two years.
Chas. R. J. Glover’s pretty daughter Thelma said
“I will” to young Dr. Keith Pavy, of Naracoorte,
the other evening at St. John’s Church, which was
packed. Miss Elder, of Victoria, was the only brides-
maid, and Jack Glover was best man. There was
a reception afterwards at the Glovers’ residence, St.
Andrews, one of the finest old homes in North Adel-
aide.
The “Mother of Blighty” seems to strike excite-
ment even in peace time. En route for Strathalbyn,
her motor-car collided with a cart, but though
bruised and scratched she escaped serious injury.
Then at Gladstone she figured in a midnight fire at
her hotel. At latest she was at Riverton presenting
war medals and unveiling German guns. She is cer-
tainly a busy bee on a holiday tour.
“Pommies” who have established themselves here
are forming a community to meet boats that bring
immigrants, hold out the hand of welcome and ghc
useful tips that will avoid waste of time and money.
An admirable idea; hut a pity it was necessary for
the “Pommies” to move in the matter.

For durability of piano construction and tonal

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeprof
Horkry
February’s atmospheric blanket has
squeezed down upon the city, and the girl
about town has walked corsetless, and, if
she possesses a cretonne dress (and what
girl does not?), without an underskirt, too.
Going to the theatre has been like taking a
course in chiropractics ; a well-known dancing
girl is patenting automatic fans to be worn
on the garters; and Miss Suburbs and
mamma are busy packing for the trip to
Europe that will use up dad’s war profits.
Social life is a run-down watch. Only
three things hold the public interest. They
are Russian “culture,” the new gambling top,
and the riddle about the anger of Queen
Mary.
There’s no 40-hour week for Mother Aus-
tralia, thank you. She does her job thor-
oughly, even though it means working the
year round; and jolly proud of her labors
she should be when harvest-time comes.
Never all the world over could there be
shown finer, fatter melons, more luscious
grapes or more golden grain than our city
shop windows frame this Country Produc-
tion Week. Sheaves of wheat bound with
the royal purple or blue rustle proudly
above firm-fleshed tomatoes or belles of the
cabbage patch ; all the richness of this big
State of ours is spilling over into a riot
of vegetable glory. The school infant writ-
ing her week-end essay comes from city and
suburban street, and positively gorges on
the plenty before her eyes. Dirty scrap of
paper and pencil in hand, she writes a never-
ending list of what she sees, and when the
name of one of the stuffed native birds
eludes her, there is generally a kindly old
lady from the country near enough to give
her the information.
Sydney tennis enthusiasts made the best
of a drab day for the exhibition matches at
Double Bay on Saturday, and in wraps and
overcoats or from beneath umbrellas saw the
games amid drizzling showers. There was a
big sprinkling of country folk, and the chat-
tering told that some he v d trekked hundreds
of miles. The irrepressible F. D. McMasters,
of Cassilis, was here, there and everywhere,
and afterwards was an efficient referee; and
Dr. McElhone occupied the chair of central
umpire. The six-foot Andersons crowded
into the Northern stand, and had reason to
be overjoyed at the success of solemn-faced
brother Jim over Gerald Patterson. Another
six-footer to drop languidly into a chair
which cracked under his weight was Jack
Gregory, who has finally retired from first-
class cricket.
The Esperantists had a night-out last week,
when a new study-circle at Ashfield was
formed. Mrs. Kathleen Shonk hostessed the
gathering, and an interesting part of the
evening were elocutionary proofs that the
freak language is capable of expressing the
strongest and the tenderest emotions. One
member of the association even rendered a
fragment of “Hamlet” into Esperanto, with-
out any visible or audible protest from
Will Shbacvere. The Esperantists claim
that the world-wide adoption of their
tongue would kill race-hatreds and con-
flicts, just as a mutual language
always stops Billo and the Cop from com-
ing to loggerheads, and that it is the natural
corollary of Disarmament Conferences and
a League of Nations. Czecho-Slovakists are
said to have taken to Zamenhoff’s language
as a duck to water, and speak it now in
preference to their own. And that, anyhow,
is credible. Meantime the Ashfield branch
has acquired 30 new members.
Sydney is losing one of its colorful patches.
Another general election approaches, so the
city railway has been begun again, and the
latest operations have disturbed the bit of
Hyde Park where the side-show and the hyp-
notist went gay for many months. Never
again (perhaps) will it be possible for the
passing tram voyager to be gladdened by the
sight of a lady stretched across a wire in
mxd-air sleeping the sleep of the hypnotised,
wrapped about for her slumbers in gay crim-
son satin bloomers and a dashing black vel-
vet coat.
All the players of the State Orchestra and
Mr. Gravestock declare that the Maoriland
sehson was a great ’success. That it just
failed to show a profit is neither here nor
there—the guarantors ye have always with
you. Christchurch flung buns as well as
bouquets at fiddles and brasses ; canny Dune-
din anted up for four concerts (it can out
out the pantomime or reduce the mission
offering) ; Auckland and Wellington spent
recklessly, maybe in order to prove to them-
selves that Jennie Cullen’s tone w T as not in
it with little sister Mabel’s. Anyway, the
Orchestra is back (without Verbrugghen),
and the welcome-home concert was chiefly
characterised by huge gaps in the audience.
Conductor Joe Bradley led in fine style, and
the tree in front of the Conservatorium
quivered to the reverberations of the Tann-
hauser Overture. The singer of the even-
ing was Robert Harper, who rippled out the
Prize Song from “The Master Singers.”
Next Friday the Musical Association en
tertains the new J. and N. Tait star, Jascha
Spivakovsky. Music and sandwiches, and
Dagmar Thompson on the fiddle.
Burlington Bertie called on the soldiers at
Randwick one afternoon last week, and
Teddy Cahill and tenor Brooke, who also did
their bit on the programme, squired, her
there and back. The three rushed out in
between shows, and so strenuous was the
pace for the two young men—they are doing
four turns a day now, two at the Haymarket
and two at the Tivoli—that they hadn’t time
to take off their make-up ; and as their taxi
was one of the glass-above-the-waistline
kind, the trio received a lot of attention from
tram-loads of school kids. On the way back
the driver of the car, infected by the enthu-
siasm, unbent, too, and wore Burlington
Bertie’s hat at a rakish angle, and Ella
Shields slipped into an obscurity she has
not known since she started her Australian
career. The cheer the soldier-boys sent ring-
ing after the trio is a memory they’re going
to prize.
Mayoress McElhone sent out invitations
in honor of Clarice Cole, the contralto, for an
afternoon early last week, but, owing to the
hot-weather exodus, the cards netted only a
small return in guests. Everybody was en-
thusiastic, and when Clarice had ended the
last deep throb of “Out on the Rocks,” the
company gave the young songbird a fore-
taste of the fluttering atentions that fail to
a prima donna. Mrs. Hugh Ward and Mrs.
Alexander Gordon were warm in their
praises, and Clarice went home feeling like a
princess in a fairy story.
The committee for Dagmar Thompson’s
recital overflowed the new room of the Queen
Victoria Club—which, for the guidance of
those who might search for it as long as
some of last week’s party, is in the Bosch-
Bartel building in Castlereagh-street. Darling
Point to Asliiield is represented on the big
committee, so the Mosman girl should be
assured of a crammed Conservatorium on
the Bth. Joe Bradley’s little wife, in white
silk jersey-cloth and
a hat of pastel tints,
showed up well
against the brown
background of the
room ; and new Jus-
tice Pike’s lady was
there in black taf-
feta, ready to face a
mountain of work.
Dagmar is an old
Normanhurst girl, so
that fountain of
learning was well
represented, Mrs.
Stiles, a former
Drincipal, and Bea-
trice Tildesley, a sis-
ter of the present one,
being in the gather-
ing. And Dr. Mary
Booth surreptitiously handed out dodgers
about the resumption of the P.F.A. sitd; and
speeches were made by the President of the
Musical Association and Dr. Arthur. Dag-
mar wore a blue-shot taffeta dress that
melted into the blue of her big eyes. The
photo of her herewith is one of Ashby’s.
Phyllis McDonald’s concert brought all the
R.C. limousines to the Conservatorium the
other night, and this was mainly the result
of a committee strong on the social side
headed by champion organiser Mrs. Barlow.
Phyllis, in spite of her dimensions, has only
had to pay full tram-fare during the past
year; but she has enough gold medals to
make a complete outfit for an Island lady,
and a trick of the bow that transformed the
St. Saens swan, plucked by every amateur,
into a bird as breath-arresting and graceful
as Lohengrin’s wonder-creatures. For this
effort she was rewarded by some well-mean-
ing friend in front with the gift of a monster
paper effigy of the water-queen, whose out-
spread wings provided a resting-place for a
pile of chocolates sufficient to give the child
toothache for a year. Eight times in all the
brilliant youngster played, and gathered from
her admirers enough flowers to supply a
Venetian carnival.
Among the long list of assisting artists was
Nell Hayes, who held the ear with a well-
turned mezzo-soprano, and received a loud
hand from her admiring auntie, the Timothy
Coghlan lady, who, just arrived from Lon-
don, topped a very charming effect in grey
taffeta with a tight-fitting grey hat, its
shape reminiscent of a biretta, the crown
carrying an upright fringe of black ostrich
fronds. With her was her young daughter,
very high and severe as to her dark coiffure,
but for the rest in tne softness of apricot
georgette.
The sailor men of Italy are being danced
off their feet, for, like the Navy all tne world
over, they make gorgeous dancing partners.
Last Saturday night the Ainsworth home at
Warrawee decorated its ballroom with
Chinese lanterns and the colors of Italy in
honor of a group of young officers from the
visiting warboat. The North Shore line’s
prettiest buds came to the party, and the
good-looking daughters of the house, Fay and
Ruth, did the honors, with mother and father
and a bunch of juvenile aunts in the back-
ground. Auntie Jean Drummond rippled
out a- cascade of Italian opera in the draw-
ing-room as an accompaniment to supper,
and one by one the strangers tore themselves
away from the most fascinating partners and
took their places close to the singer. A
surplus of partners for the girls, a flooi
polished to a miracle, and good music—in
short, all the ingredients for a successful
dance—had been carefully prepared by the
flapper hostesses, and monster bowls of
dahlias and asters filled the landings and
lounges with the glory of the acres of gar-
dens around the house which the persistent
drip of the week-end rain made impossible
for even the most ardent between-dance
Nature-lover.
In the end the question was whether Rob-
son, the manager, should be appointed
managing editor of
Sydney Telegraph,
with an associate, or
whether I’ arm e r
Whyte should be
brought from Bris-
bane to succeed D.
D. Braham, who has
resigned, as plain
editor, leaving the
other man to look
after the till. The
Board settled it last
week by sending for
Farmer Whyte. Syd-
ney knows him very
well and esteems him
highly. He is a
student and a
scholar, who makes
almost a hobby of
Shakspeare, though he also plays bowls, and
when the law commanded newspapers to
sign their political articles during Federal
elections, Farmer Whyte’s name used to be
at the foot of most of the S. M. Herald’s
solemn warnings.
Before Rossy Lumsdaine becomes Mrs.
Allen Spowers at Easter-time, she is to
appear once more on the Repertory stage—
this time as the pretty daughter of Vachell’s
old furniture dealer in “Quinneys.” “Quin-
neys” re-opens in business, under the direc-
tion of Gregan McMahon, in the interests of
the Bush Book Club, and the production is
having all the boost that a Government
House send-off can give it.
Another bride of the year will be Jean
Williamson, who is marrying Cecil Traill.
She is having a dream-trousseau made for
the contract by the latest society undie-
planner—Jacqueline.
This (Thursday) morning Jack
Bean, Idealist, is becoming the second hus-
band of Mrs. John, one of the most ardent
workers in the Sydney fields of Theosophy.
Dr. Bean is the organising secretary of the
Theospphical Society for Australasia. So
the Liberal Catholic Church will put out
all its heaviest gold embroideries for the
ceremony, which Bishop Leadbeater will
duly perform.
Jerome Seymour Allen, a grandson of the
late Paddy Perkins, one-time member of
Queensland’s Upper House and the founder
of a successful brewery, was married re-
cently to Muriel Nash, of Cremorne. It
happened at the Sacred Heart Church, Mos-
man. Jerome’s father was an Englishman
of a Surrey clan, who met and married the
“handsome Miss Perkins” when he was tour-
ing Australia. He was among the pioneers
of submarine navigation, and one of the
family treasures is a copy of the invitation
card for a trial plunge of one of his craft.
The bride comes of an old Parramatta family.
Elsie Hewitt, of Neutral Bay, formerly of
Moree, where her late father owned many
sheep, has engaged herself to Wilfred Hor-
dern, second son of the Cecil Harderns, of
Kirribilli. Bride-to-be is an orphan. Her
only brother is going through Cambridge.
Last month Samarai put a red hibiscus in
its hair to welcome Bishop Newton, who had
labored among the sheep and the goats of
that diocese in his ungaitered days as a plain
shepherd. The Arthur Buntings’ home hung
out the “Welcome” banners, and his Grace
passed under a succession of triumphal red
and white flowering arches from the gate-
way to the wide verandah, where yellow
blooms sp.lied over some beautiful old-brass
urns and vases. Res’dent Magistrate Hig-
ginson and his wife assisted in doing the
nonois.
The I renduAustralian League of Help
lost a good friend when Mrs. Moreau died
last week, She was one of its earliest and
most consistent workers. Much sympathy
is felt for her husband and her three daugh-
tel? - i orcuu gli'ls are ardent jazzers,
and the dance season will miss their always-
C ' U r> Sl *' e - Nocking. One girl, Eugenie, helps
the itanicar firm to design some of its most
sophisticated garments.
Sydney Rowing Club members are saying
thanks to Mrs. )Y. 11. Chard for the gift of
a new eight-oar boat for next year’s cham-
Not long since her husband, one
of Sydney club’s oldest members, helped the
club to a four-oar boat. The family habit
is enthusiastically acclaimed.
Curtis-road, a narrow thoroughfare .with
houses mostly of weatherboard, in crowded
Balmain, was the last place in the world you
would have looked for Romance. You might
have been in it thousands of times and never
met anything more romantic than a meat-
waggon. But that was before ,the days of
Nazimova and Lilian Gish, who are now
nightly featured in a mowe palace a tew
yards up the street. Ten years ago the
infant would not have moved beyond the
main road, unattended, for a kingdom; but
the performances of the queens of moviedom
have not been thrown away on the new
generation. The adventures of Daisy White,
a_ girl of 16, and her little brother and
sisters, the youngest six, en route to Mel-
bourne to see-Grandma, would make a film
and take first prize for precocity. They
played ’possum until the Karoola had passed
the Heads; then they sang songs and sent
round the hat, and arrived safely, while the
folks at home wondered where those kids
could be all this time.
Here’s the arm of coincidence again.
Llewellyn Jones, who paints the delicate
little nature poems that Sydney is going to
acquire a taste for, was discussing a title
for one of the small canvases in his recent
exhibition at Anthony Horderns’ Gallery.
The artist wanted to put a couplet of Ken-
dall’s under the pictured mountain stream,
but the writing-man over-ruled him. When
the writing-man had disappeared, a stranger
who had been wandering about came up and
said, rather diffidently : “You know, I think
you were right. I thought of those lines
of Kendall the minute I saw the picture, and
Kendall was my father!”
The Melbourne Leader has commenced n
new novel, “The Blotted Scroll,” written by
“Oliver Wright.” This is the pseudonym
of Mary Macafee, who, through her mother, is
one of the well-known Arthur Allen family.
Nearly 20 years ago Miss Macafee left Syd-
ney for Florence and made her home. Her
brother, Captain Percival Macafee, was in
the English Army and went through the
war. She has written other books which
met with much success, but has been silent
during the last eight years. During the
war Miss Macafee had charge of a hospital
for wounded soldiers in Florence, and, though
a fragile woman, was a strenuous worker
all through. ;
The young brother of a Sydney girl, hav-
ing become a telegraphist in the G.P.0., in-
fected her with a craze for the Morse code,
and she turned out something of an expert.
When her holidays came round she decided on
a trip to Melbourne. At the first meal on
board she found herself beside the second offi-
cer and opposite “Sparks.” While fingering
his spoon with apparent casualness the Second
quietly tapped out “Some girl.” “Sparks’s”
fork just as quietly replied, “And she knows
it.” Muriel has the prettiest fingers ever
seen, but two men looked at them in absolute
horror as they daintily drummed out with
perfect accuracy, “Thanks. You are both quite
light.” It was the impudent “Sparks” who
eventually put a ring on one of those pretty
fingers.
Edward McKeown, the heavenly tenor, has
paid a flying visit from London to see his
people. He is a son of Roboi.t McKeown,
many years rector of St. Mary’s, Waverley,
but now taking life less strenuously with his
beloved dogs—-Irish terriers for preference.
Young McKeown began his English career
with the Moody-Manners Co.
Why will women persist in the ugliness
of war practices? At a party of ex-service
women the other day all but the heads had
been Waacs or Wrens or other Pommy ser-
vice women, mostly nice little things, balanc-
ing an outsize in feet with an enviable
pink-and-whiteness. The Heads —Australian
women, who should know better—had
acquired officer rank during service in Eng-
land and abroad, and persisted in addressing
the girls (who, of course, were privates, or
at least not more than sergeants) by their
surnames, Smith, Jones or Robinson, without
any softening prefix. It is a bit of feminine
military swank that ought to be sent out to
Moore Park.
The lion, masseuses of the North Shore
Hospital are going to run the jolliest stall
at the fair in aid of the big North Side insti-
tution, and to help furnish it they are hold-
ing a dance on March 4 in Warrmgah Hall.

Positively the V.C. Tyre will not skid—the Vacuum Cups render that
motoring nightmare an utter impossibility. Special Practical Tests and
every day experience in America and Australia have demonstrated that
beyond all cavil.
Thus you are Guaranteed Security from Skidding.
Long Service (with its consequent Economy in cost of maintenance)
and remarkable freedom from tyre troubles are automatically attained
by reason of the
Super-Quality of the V.C. Tyre.
Its wear-resisting capacity is very notable—and the longer the run and
the rougher the road the more insistently does this characteristic impress
itself upon even the most casual observer.
AND WHAT OF V.C. TYRE PRICES?
Well, they are REASONABLE—based upon a FAIR AND HONEST
APPRAISEMENT OF GOOD VALUE.

YOU WON’T GET A “HIDING,”
no matter what sort of a mix-up you
may be forced into, if you take up the
Baker Course and
LEARN BOXING
BY POST.
In a series of simple, easily-mastered
lessons the noted athlete, Reg. L.
(“Snowy”) Baker, has crystallised the
knowledge his long experience in the
ring has gained him. In this course he teaches you, step
by step, the whole art of self-defence, from the rudi-
ments of footwork right on to the finished methods
adopted by world champions. Each lesson is given
just as if you were attending the classes in Sydney,
and quite apart from learning how to defend yourself
there is a keen pleasure to be gained from the splen-
did physical exercise of practising the various
positions.
SEND FOR THE BOOKLET,
“Scientific Boxing in Your Home,” which tells all
about the Baker Course, fees, etc. All you have to
do, if you want this interesting booklet, is to write
ymur name and address across this advertisement,
enclose three stamps to cover postage, and we will
mail it by return.

Gabba: Airey didn’t, of course, suggest that
the shrinkage of population on Queensland mining
fields was due to climatic reasons. He said that the
fields had had the people, but that the North hadn’t
developed other industries to hold them —as, for
instance, Bendigo and Ballarat have done—when the
mines were worked 0ut.... Gecko: This great truth,
at any rate, shall have immortality:—
Let him whose thirst calls loud and clear
Get blithered while he may;
For no stiff, borne upon a bier,
Can put one pot away.
... .Burrundie: We should have to cut our ears off
before we could pass a couplet like
He who made a start
Barehanded out to fight a shark.
.... Oilskin: Cheerful enough; but that lady has
been put into jingle so often Drysdale: That
“poor blankard’’ got into The B. nearly three years
ago.... Mag: Too rough; but we’ll give you an
0.8. E. at least for the discovery of the “kingdom-
sing-dumb” rhyme C.F.C.: Others got in ahead
of you... .F.E.F.: The color is thick, but the yarn
is thin....Dinkum Aussie: The verse has gone to its
little wooden cross.... Geoff S.: That story has been
told for 40 years about General Jackson... .The Assist,
ant Nipper: “Road Gang” fails... .J.J.V.: Only a
piling up of commonplaces. .. .J.M.8.: They don’t
p get near... .Johnny Cake: Very rugged... .V.M.
(Concord): Try again in ten years.... Gem: You
can’t rhyme “time” and “kind” with “mine” in
this paper... .F.G.H.: Rotten. ... Blau: Wretched...
X.Y.Z.: The verse goes sick from the first couplet. .. .
Bluey: Very lame... .G.N.: “Passing” has too
many warts on it for a sonnet... .Pauline E.: Not
enough there.... J.H.L.: Not up... .0.F.: Goes like
a barrow on a three-cornered wheel. .. .H.G.M.:
Those “dewdrops” are artificial affairs with bad
rhymes.... ZZZ: Hop in here:—
THE FLEA.
It tackled Madame, made her fret;
It bit her dimpled elber —
The one thing that’s succeeded yet
In “stinging” Madame Melber.
... .George P.: Too deep a mystery... .Deirdre:
“Jim’s Mate” is rather crude and obvious....
F. : “The Cheerful Word” wasn’t. .. .H.H.8.:
Doesn’t strike us.... Edna L.: No use... .F.H.8.:
They fail in the telling more than in the material...
C.H.M.: What’s it all about ?.... Peg-a-way: Not
enough in the yarn. Try taking more than ten
minutes over the next. .. . J.8.A.: Only a mild inter-
est in the murdering of the corpse.... Evelyn J.:
Not well enough done... .A.E.G/: Sounds true, but
not worth telling..... .Helios: Rather extravagant....
D’R.C.: That stone-throwing yarn is the theme of
some of the best-known verses ever written in Aus-
tralia ; and you haven’t improved it.... Y.Y.Y.: Not
the goods for this market. .. .E.M. (Broome): Not
up to standard... .F.G.8.: Moves very heavily....
G. (Balranald): Snake verse has had its back
broken... .Kat: It has the merit of, striking origin-
ality :—•
She was very good to me, so
I could not but go with her home.
I let her mind my money. Her name I didn’t know.
And she never came back after leaving home.
I was disappointed, and the police I told.
She should have taken me, I’m brave but old.
For there’s blokes in the city who are bad,
And would a man let alone a woman have.
I’m sorry now I trusted her with money,
If she’s murdered on my hands her death "will be.
Though I’m innocent. ’Tis funny
To feel like that. Anyone can see
I tried to be good to her as she was to the.
But life’s not one honey-pot.
I’ll meet her after life’s lot.
She will know me o’er the sea
As Billie Muggin
Just finished scrubbin’.
. ...Elda: Rubbish... .Rolling Stone: The yarn is
too mixed; and you don’t get the mirth out of the
burning trousers. .. .S.O’S.: The verse is very
wooden... .C.H.M.: No use to us. What’s the matter
with taking a little trouble over a real yarn ?. . . .
Michael F.: “Hairpins” too slight. .. .H.D.8.: “Say,
hast thou” observed that antiquated English, badly
used, makes weak verse weaker?... .E.AV.L.: The
verse is uninteresting, and only says the ordinary
things heavily... .Wally: Doesn’t get near....
A. : There’s a whisper of something worth while,
but it doesn’t get beyond that.... Bobbie B.: Moves
rather, too much like a traction-engine... .M.W.
(Chatswood) : Very p00r.... Tweezer: No interest in
’4ie lines. .. .T.E.L.R.: A string of commonplace
questions can only irritate. .„ .Phyllis D.: Weak
little flutter.... Pidgeon: Doesn’t say much.... Fifi
B. : As thin and poor as the skilly our grandfathers
had to eat.... Curfew: Not badly done; but the idea
has corns on its hands.... Tew: “Insurance cos.
have always had a more or less fat time.” Turn up
a list of the infants of the past 40 years, and you’ll
be surprised at the number that have made a fat time
for the worms.... H.R.Y.: Sorry, that’s done with ;
but there are other subjects we should like to hear
about. .. .lienm ore: Can’t be done.... Shoot Cutter:
Description of snake too meagre Pippy: Every-
thing used is paid for. .'. .F.L.: Not enough in it. . .
Sky Pilot: Impossible to handle such closely-typed
copy Stelle O’Dorn: Hopelessly long-drawn-out.
....Otway: That “snake” with legs has been fully
discussed by the Abos«... Cynic: Ship incident of
no general interest.... Tarwin: Both old Bulletin
yarns Chas. J.: A bit too near the knuckle
Invalid: Threshed out sometime ago.. . .F.H.P.F.:
Not quite up ; but have another shot.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Mitti: Sketches and jokes both poor N.F.8.:
Doesn’t look as though you’ll make a living at it...
A.W.: No drawing there C.E.G.: A terrible pup.
C.G.: Some improvement; better opportunities
East when your work is of saleable quality... .E.H.:
Misses C.H.T.: That would be cruel to Punch...
G.H.: Still stiff in drawing and scratchy in treat-
ment M.J.M.: All below par M.M.: A poor
but honest attempt... .F.C.: No man with a hat
like that gets into The Bulletin F.C.M.: Out.
V.C.: Come again when you’ve learned drawing.
. ...J.F.W.: Low water mark... .T. 8.: Not up....
A.A.: Black masses cover a multitude of sins....
W.A.H.: Off the target C.T.: We tried not to
think evil of it G.H.P.: No health in it R.M.:
Misses M.L.: Going back A.G.F.: Considering.
“Pat Bushie”: Re “X2X’s” par (B.
16/2/’22) on wandering bullets. At Gal-
lipoli a Digger was struck by a ricocbetting
bullet on the right arm, near the shoulder.
It travelled over the shoulder blade, down his
back, through the buttock and remained
embedded in the thigh, about 6in. above the
knee. No bones were broken, and no sinews
cut. In the man’s arm is a hole about the size
of a two-bob piece where the bullet, went in.

Man: this is the iron
the wife wants
—get it!
Haven’t you noticed how tired-ort the wife is every ironing day—
after she has been toiling in the summer heat over hot stoves and
with old-fashioned flat-irons ?
It’s not a fair thing.
WITH A
“SPOT-REVO”
ELECTRIC
IRON
she’ll iron in cool comfort and convenience. She’ll finish her ironing:
Oarlicr.' There’ll be no after-ironing tiredness; in short, ironing
will cease to be a drudgery and become a pleasure.
Then there are two other things it’s worth your while considering:—

The Last Corroboree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The aboriginal “race of Murri” had a general
belief that, when all are dead, Biamee will call them
to a last fight and a last corroboree, and will then
take them to the Murri heaven of Mahgoon-Yirraba.
OH, hark from Fate’s tremendous gloom
The Voice which speaks the words of
doom !
From west to east, and south to north,
The awful mandate issues forth.
The fatal white man takes the place
Of Murri’s doomed unhappy race!
The men the Murri mothers bore
They are no more, no more, no more!
Their ghosts alone shall come again,
Assembled on some boundless plain.
One last corroboree, one last tight,
Then vanish in eternal night!
From where the Indian Ocean laves
The west .coast with her stormy waves
To where the vast Pacific rolls
In thunder o’er the coral shoals;
From where Cape Wilson sleeps at ease,
Far north to Torres’ tropic seas—
Where’er the circling sea surrounds
This great Australia’s utmost bounds
They came ; from where the eagles seek
A rest on Morong’s cloud-capped peak;
From where the sounding surges sweep
Through Coorann’s caverns, dark and deep,
And where the summer streamlets flow
. Down Kosciusko’s breast of snow ;
Where far on Woondine’s granite crest
The wild war-eagles build their nest;
Where savage Nature rudely decks
The red sandhills with spinifex,
And back in immemorial years
The wild men threw their woomera spears;
Where green Cameelda’s summits rise,
Tree-crowned in glorious tropic skies,
And sunlit springs, ’mid splendid scenes,
Pour cataracts down the dark ravines;
Far north where strong canoe men urge
Their pathway through the roaring surge.
Hark! Where the black-haired bunyip calls,
Where wail wild WoOroon’s waterfalls,
And strong-armed Cambaleena threw
The spear killed Biamee’s kangaroo,
The wasteful waters howl and hiss
Down dread Doondoora’s dark abyss.
Hills shake beneath the thunder crash,
Rocks shatter in the lightning flash.
On hollow shields the nullas rang,
Loud whirred the birdlike boomerang,
While through the silence far and near
Quivered the noiseless woomera spear.
Earth shopk beneath the measured beat
Of countless Murris’ naked feet.
The echoes of the hills prolong
The Murri women’s mournful song.
And hear the loud Buralga scream
From Leeaneena’s sounding stream !
That voice the listening moon reminds
To call the birds from all the winds.
They come, each from his resting place,
To see the last of Murri’s race!
The last lone boomerang is flung,
The last corroboree song is sung;
The shadowy hosts on that sad field,
Strike once again the sounding shield.
Stern Biamee calls them from the fight,
To vanish in surrounding night.
The days of Murri’s race are o’er,
They come no more, no more, no more!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE tank ship Bangan was discharging
benzine at the Installation wharf,
Yarraville. She was a dreary-looking
craft, rust-pitted from stern to forepeak;
sour yisdged as her Chinese crew, from the
hos’n down to the messroom boy. And slow
—a seven-knot ship. Little wonder that offi-
cers and engineers hated her during the long
runs from Havre to Borneo, or from Texas
to the China coast.
‘‘Number One down below!” Mr. Fissett,
the second engineer, a dominant personality
with menacing eyes and heavy jaw, yelled
in vibrant tones into the depths of the
engine-room. He waited a few seconds;
then, spitting wrath, he walked towards the
cylinder-tops. Suddenly the figure of a
Chinaman was silhouetted upon the iron
frame of the alley-way. With a noise that
resounded throughout the ship, Fissett re-
viled the luckless individual who had
ignored his urgent cry.
„ '-Damn you, Number One,” he roared,
‘Y ve been calling from topside thinking you
been; helping third and fourth engineer; and
instead you been sleep ’longside ash-hoist.
11l teach you! I’ll” Then, checking
ms passion, he continued : “You see firemen
have steam up sail 8 o’clock in the morn-
ing—-savvy ?”
With a nod of understanding, Number
One, a bland Oriental, who dispensed orders
or dire punishment with equal equanimity
among the yellow-skinned members of the
engine-room staff, padded softly away to
give instructions to his men.
Five minutes later the second engineer
gulped fiercely at a peg of whisky prepara-
tory to venting his wrath before the chief,
a o.W Tynesider.
CMef, I won’t sail any longer with
"his sleeping business is the last
straw. i o *- that rod down during mv
watch in the Sunda Straits. The third and
lourth won’t have him as a gift, and, what’s
, ilasn ’t any control over the men.”
VYhats to do?” queried the Chief.
' I don’t know; it’s beyond me.” Then
alter a minute’s silence: “I’ve got it”—and
iissett thumped the table till the spirit
mad * y ’ n the "lasses. “We’ll lose
! ” whistled his superior officer,
about the fine for the skipper?”
When J° Hell with him! Now, listen.
Alien we were here on the Solingara the
wanted to join his Chow relation in
mttle Bourke-street: so, for a small con-
sideration, I gave him a chance. Now he’ll
help me. Savvy ?”
“Yes, but”
“No huts, Chief; I’ve got it all worked
out. At 9.30 skipper and mates will be
ashore. We’ll dope Number One, put him in
the pump-room, and leave the rest to my
friend the bos’n, now a wealthy merchant.
He’ll have a car ready and—what do you
think of the scheme, Chief?”
The chief engineer by way. of answer
drank success to the enterprise in a stiff glass
of whisky.
Bill Fairbanks, the third engineer, clad
in dripping boiier-su.t, the result of a con-
test, with the condenser tubes, im. into his
mate’s room, waltzed a few steps, then re-
clined upon the settee, laugning heartily.
With elevated eyebrows, Harry Ellery, the
fourth, engineer, waited expectantly. “Yes,
old chap, you think the life has turned my
brain. I’ve been strafed on three occasions;
have sailed the seven seas God knows how
many times—'Ulysses is not in the hunt with
a chap who’s done 10 years on a tramp!
I’ve swigged gin, bitters, vermouth and star-
board light in all the God-forsaken ports
into which a filthy tanker shoves her nos •;
but, strange to say, I am still counted as
sane by that bloomin’ Dutch marine super
at Singapore. Remember, lad” —his voice
grew serious—“when Mr. Fissett
‘logged’ us after that jag in Colombo?”
“Yes!” Ellery’s mouth set grimly.
“Remember when he hauled us before the
Admiral at Gib. in T 7, and how the old boy
read us a lesson on duty to the Empire in
its hour of need?”
The junior engineer nodded, a steely glint
in his eye.
“Remember the countless times he has
let cross-head guides sizzle with the express
purpose of giving us a few anxious moments
when we’ve gone below?”
“Yes, damn him ; I’d like to fix him ; but”
Ellery smiled whimsically as he
glanced at an ugly, gnarled finger, the relic
of a collision with Fissett’s granite-like
countenance.
“Would you like to get even without hav-
ing a chip knocked off your angelic features?”
queried Fairbanks.
“You bet I would!”
“Well, if you’re on we can settle him.”
“How?” The tone had sealed the com-
pact.
“This way. I overheard the ‘queer fel-
low’ and the Chief hatching a plot, and my
great idea is a counterplot.”
The voice trailed off into, a whisper, and
the chums sat side by side chuckling inter-
mittently until the olive-faced mess-room
boy announced in his pidgin English: “Sup-
pose third and fourth engineer ready, Chow
ready.”
* » # *
Night had sent forth a cold, stinging wind
from the bay and a watery elusive moon
that momentarily left the wharf in darkness
but for the pin-point riding lights of the
Bangan. The slight but incessant lap of the
water and the faint, rhythmic stroke of an
auxiliary pump far below in the intestines
of the tanker were the only sounds that dis-
turbed the sombre silence of the night.
“Care for a peg?”
Harry Ellery hailed the shivering watch-
man, who acquiesced without hesitation —he
had enjoyed wonderful “Nights aboard” on
other tankers —and followed him into the
warmth and good-fellowship of the mess-
room. Fairbanks wdtli a laugh whistled a
few bars of “Watchman, Yvhat ot the
Night?” and the fellow, grasping the appro-
priateness of the tune, grinned back approv-
ingly. The mellow spirit soon loosened his
tongue. He swapped reminiscences of vari-
ous skippers of the line; told with many a
sly wink and grin of how McMartm 0.l the
Coonta told Hansen the captain that he would
not sail with him again, and how Hansen
promptly replied that he “wouldn’t carry tile
again as ballast.” The watchman was
sentimental, and shed a tew tears when
Ellery informed him that Mac and Hansen
had both disappeared into a blazing benzine
tank when the Coonta received her death-
blow off the Lizard at the hands of a strafing
ocean devil. Later he punctuated his yarns
with expressive hiccups and maudlin laugh-
ter, till suddenly he tell forward, a huddied
heap, upon the table, snoring stertorously.
Clang ! One bell!
The engineers, wiio had drunk sparingly,
sat without a movement, listening intently,
until a heavy tread was heard upon deck.
The sound acted on Ellery like the shock
from a galvanic battery. With amazing
alacrity he dissolved a white powdery sub-
stance into a glass of whisky.
“Hell of a night out,” grunted the second
engineer. as he strolled into the messroom.
“Sozzled?” he added as he discerned the
sprawling figure.
“Yes, well gone,” from Fairbanks. “Have
a peg, Mr. Fissett?”
“With an approving nod he sat down be-
side the recumbent figure, and drank with
evident relish. “Ellery, you had better take the
twelve to four watch,” he said. “I don’t
trust that Number One to raise steam
slowly. He d-don’t know a sh-sufn —wha’s
wrong?—sh-spanner from”
Fissett’s glass_ fell with a crash to the
floor. His head jerked forward and thumped
the table. Then he, too, lay sprawling,
oblivious to all around him.
“Now,” came in low tones from Fairbanks.
Instantly Ellery pluneed the messroom into
darkness, and almost simultaneously a volley
of oaths echoed throughout the interior —the
chums had collided violently in their hasty
efforts to score over Fissett, and had seen
myriads of stars whirling with lightning-like
rapidity before their eyes, delaying them for
a few moments. Clearheaded once more,
they groped upon all-fours towards their
quarry. A hurried, scuffling sound, punctu-
ated with exultant chuckles, commenced: a
jerky, uneven tread resounded on the com-
panion way ; then silence reigned once more
in the gloom of the messroom.
Some hours later the skipper paced the
bridge, talking excitedly to the chief, who
stared in perplexity towards the road that
led to the wharf. “I’ll report him to the
super, at Singapore ! Does he think he can
hold up the Bangan like this ! I suppose the
fool is in some wine-joint in the city, full to
the neck —he never gets ‘inked’ decently.”

Rescued from Blood Poison CSL Piles.
Impressed with the manner in which Zam-Buk rescued him from
blood-poison, Mr. W. Simpson, of Annerly Road, S. Brisbane, says:
“My right hand was crushed by a log, and the little finger split open
to the bone, and as the poison spread into the arm, hard lumps began
to form.
“Disabled for a fortnight, the injury cost me £lO in wages.
Fortunately I tried Zam-Buk. It did me a world of good, and so
perfectly healed the finger that there wasn’t scarce a mark to be seen.
' “For five years I had experimented with scores of remedies in search
of a cure for piles. Zam-Buk proved a real cure, and I take pleasure
in endorsing its value and reliability.”

M ith a savage jerk the exasperated skip-
per blew the steam siren, which had shrieked
at intervals during the last half-hour, "r ive
minutes more I’ll give him; then we throw
off,” he snapped definitely.
, Meanwhile the chief engineer spat viciously
into the river.
“Ah, here he is.”
“Damn near time, too,” rasped out the
navigator. “Well, what’s the meaning of
this.I’’ 1 ’’ as Fissett, his features a dull waxy
hue, rolled up the gangway.”
‘Hanged if I know. I must have gone
to sleep in the mess-room, and, waking, went
along to the Seafarers’ Inn for a pick-me-up.
I’ve been there ever since, too crook to leave.
All I’ve got to say is that I’d like to”
The. suave voice of the Number One cut
his railing short, with “Third engineer sent
me topside to see chief engineer.”
With a roar like a bull Fissett whirled
round and dropped the Oriental with a right
to the solar-plexus. Then leaving the China-
man gasping for breath he went fuming down
to the engine-room.
“I say, Chief,” came the voice of Ellery,
“this reversing gear Oh, it’s you!" lie
managed to stammer out.
“Yes, it’s me. Who were you expectin’?”
The chums stared at him in a sickly
fashion for a few moments, feeling limp and
a trifle shaken, as if they had seen a ghost,
and then turned to their respective duties.
“Done like a dinner!” whispered Fairbanks
in tragic tones, and the fourth engineer by
way of reply jerked savagely at the tele-
graph ; and within an hour thie fo’c’s’le head
of the Bangan was dipping to the sea.
* * * *
In the hut of a Chinese market-gardener a
white man awakened and stared in bewilder-
ment around him, till at last his eyes rested
upon the figure of an old Chinaman, who sat
gazing at him with the placid indifference of
the Oriental.
With a curse the European fired a volley
of questions at the fellow, and the only reply
to his harangue was a coolly-repeated “No
savvy, no savvy. You ’rongee man. We
expee’ ’nother man.”
The chums had shanghaied the night-
watchman.
H. L. MAPPIN.
Sally.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BALD Hill lifted its round shoulder to
the east of Phelan’s home, so that
when you came out even late in the
morning the shadow still lay upon it. All
around the sunshine might be golden on the
green of the saplings, but Phelan’s hut and
the cleared paddock in front were still
white with frost. Up on the slopes the
moisture would be kissed away into a light,
warm mist, but down round Phelan’s place
the winter was still heavy, and grass and
post-and-rail fence, bush and bark stable
stood white and damp and cold. The
Phelans were used to it. The little Phelans
thought that the sun rose like that all over
the world, which was a great place nearly
20 times as far across as from the selection
to Dalton —and that was 20 miles.
Up on the hill, then, the sun was out, but
down on the flat it was still early morning
when the little Phelans —the eldest of them
aged 11 —pushed open the dopy of the hut
and came out into the white .world. They
rubbed their hands and kicked about frozen
clods of grass and soil in an effort to warm
themselves. It was little Mike who found
the tragedy. A shrill cry from him brought,
the other twain running.
“Sally’s sick!” he said, and pointed to the
cage which stood on the outer wall of the hut
beneath the bark verandah.
Sally was the satin-bird which had been
their pet for a year. They clustered about
the wooden box which had been her home—
she was always “she” by reason of her name
—and they peered in at Sally. Sally was
evidently very sick, for Sally was lying on
her back with her two little legs thrust into
the air. One of her claws had been left in
the rabbit-trap which gave her to captivity,
and now the tiny shortened leg appeared par-
ticularly pitiful. The glossy plumage which
had been her pride was lustreless and rumpled,
the pink eyes which had looked out so
brightly on the trees and sky were clouded
over, the keen beak which had spoken soi
many strange things and made such wonder-
ful noises was twisted on one side, a little
open. Sally looked very cold and desolate,
for Sally was dead, and the frost of night
was still heavy upon Phelan’s place.
The eldest boy got a twig and poked Sally
with it, but the bird merely rolled over a
little and one wing fell limply open. The
two elders knew death and they whimpered
in the cold of the morning.
“Sally ul much?” asked Mike, but the
others did not answer him. They fled for
the comforting warmth of the stable.
There is something wonderfully cheering
and consoling about a bush stable, with the
smell of hay and harness and horse, with the
steam rising from the stalls and the horses
breathing white clouds and stamping their
hooves on the boards. The chirruping of
mice is cheerful, too, and the dog comes in
and makes a great pretence of catching them.
A stable is a good place on a frosty morning
when one has woe to bear.
Presently Timothy, sitting there on the
bags of chaff, expressed his awful fear to his
sister.
“I wonder,” said he, “if father done it?”
He said no more, but the little girl looked
at him with eyes of horror, and into her face
crept an expression of doubt and pain as
though the thought he had suggested had
robbed her of something precious.
“He wouldn’t!” she declared, but there
was no sureness in her voice.
“He said he would,” Timothy reminded
her.
So he had. Old Phelan had seen death
stalking Sally behind her bars, and had
threatened to end her sufferings. Also he
had. been annoyed in times of annoyance by
her continual chatter, her endless burblings.
Old Phelan didn’t care much for birds and
such things—too much of a pest they were.
The children, sitting there in the warm
gloom of the stable, recalled all these things
and magnified their portent. They had
always found their father rather terrible,
witn 111 s snock of red hair, his fierce eye and
tns long, hairy arms. Mum was their pos-
session, but Dad was a terror.
“He did say it —didn’t he?” persisted
Timothy.
His sister admitted sobbingly that he did.
But she made a last plea for her father.
She vowed that he wouldn’t do it even if
he said he would.
"D’you remember the day the poley cow
fell into the river?” Timothy countered,
“and Sally would say, ‘Get out! Get out!’
all the afternoon, and dad said he’d shut her
up, and went out with the big knife?”
A sob answered him.
Timothy had convinced himself, and he
lingered in the stable to avoid meeting the
eye of the man who had slain Sally. He de-
vised strange methods of vengeance—methods
whiqh, by their very intricacy, would prevent
any blame attaching to their author. The
best seemed to be to climb to the top of Bald
Hill and roll a big stone down at the right
moment. He was rather proud of the idea.
He unfolded it to Kathleen. Kathleen had
just mastered her outward show of grief, but
his desperate plot caused a fresh flow of
tears. Timothy looked upon her with pity-
ing disdain as an example of horrible weak-
ness.
The unexpected thud of hooves outside
brought them to the door of the stable. A
man in a wonderful blue uniform, like a sol-
dier out of a book, was riding across the
paddock to the hut. As was only to be ex-
pected, even the sun jumped up over Bald
Hill to see him and the shadow vanished
from Phelan’s place—the shadow of the
night, that is. The sun was warm as the
wondering children ran down the paddock,
but Sally was still lying dead in her box-
cage.
The man like a soldier out of a book was
talking to Mrs. Phelan at the door and she
ordered the children away with a strained
abruptness which was not her normal manner.
They slunk away down to the lightwood-tree
by the river, burdened with the sense of the
morning being one of dark things—Sally
dead, and a soldier at the house, and mum
with a funny white face. Even little Mike
was hushed.
From their seat on the log beneath the
lightwood they saw dad come out and go to the
stable; they saw him saddle up his horse;
they saw him ride away with his head hang-
ing down and looking neither to right nor to
left, without even a word to them ; they saw
the two riders reach the sliprails and the
soldier man got down and opened the rails
and put them back. Then once, sharply, Old
Phelan looked back at his hut. He seemed
to swing his head aWay swiftly. The
soldier-man-from-a-book and Dad passed out
of sight among the saplings.
Because they were very bewildered and
frightened the children lingered beneath the
lightwood, breakfastless and round-eyed. At
last they were drawn back to the house by a
queer sense of curiosity. They peeped
through the open door, and saw Mum sitting
within, her head buried in the curve of her
brown arm, which rested upon the stained
wooden table. Sally was still dead in her
cage.
\Vhen they peeped into the hut again Mum
was looking at them.
“Who was the soldier, Mum?” asked the
awe-stricken Timothy.
“He was a trooper—a policeman,” she said,
scarcely thinking of her words.
The children turned the thought over in
their small heads. Their mother seemed to
have forgotten them in her woe for her man
taken for sheep-stealing. The tears had made
pale tracks down her brown cheeks. Study-
ing her face Timothy came to a decision, but
before he spoke he looked challengingly at
his sister.
“The p’liceman had no right to take dad,”
he declared hotly, and paused. “I done it,”
he lied —“I killed Sally.”
DALE COLLINS.
The Green Bay.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sea is very green to-day,
Like fields of flowing grass;
And, speaking from the shining bay
As from a lookinsr-glass,
The quiet words the curled clouds say
Are echoed as they pass.
The land and sea sleep side by side:
The water-flowers are dead ;
Gay sands the sun has glorified
Are blooming in their stead;
But all the white foam-lilies died
The hour the wild wind fled.
Yet, stayed upon the level skies,
A shrill blue music sings ;
And where the brown rock-furrows rise
Are limpid whisperings;
While sloops like sun-drowsed butterflies
Are lifting silver wings.
Far out a toppling sky-sail fills;
The grim seas heel the chase;
With scuppers flashing into rills
And spray across her face,
A barque reels down the ocean hills
And strides the meadow-place.
The gaunt red anchor hurries down,
The long land folds the ship;
The promise of her parted gown
Is on the land’s red lip;
And, like a babe, some babbling town
Is slung across her hip.
All through the long and lovely hours
The. foolish houses stare,
And . tiptoe from their roseate bowers
The day’s last minutes fare,
And glean a wreath of poppy-flowers
To grace the Sunset’s hair.
VICTORIA.
BOYCE BOWDEN.

Good Braces Prolong the Life
of Your Wearing Apparel
It is the infinite care that is worked into SHIRLEY
PRESIDENT BRACES that makes them different from
other braces, just a better clinging to the outlines of the
figure, better shaped so as not to bind, that is what
carries the clothing so gracefully without hardly feeling
that one has braces on.
