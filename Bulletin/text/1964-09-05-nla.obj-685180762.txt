There’s no more exacting master than Tradition
The Yalumba tradition began with Samuel Smith who, in 1849, founded a vineyard to producj
wines equal to any in the world. A claret born of these concepts is Yalumba Galway Vintage
Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz varieties, Galway Vintage is an elegant, y e:
delightfully light, claret. Connoisseurs seek it out. Royal Show judges honour its quality. Galwsij
Vintage Claret, by Yalumba, is indeed worth asking for.

LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
NATIONAL SERVICE
Sir,
Dr T. B. Millar’s plea for “Two
Years’ National Service” (22/8/64)
comes nearly ten years too late. Had
such a scheme been adopted when Aus-
tralia “was playing at national service”
(Sir William Slim in an unguarded
moment or as a calculated indiscretion)
we would now have a reasonably well
trained reserve of troops. However,
during the locust years when in terms of
real money progressively less was spent
each year on defence, Indonesia has
developed her sea and air power and with
it an aggressive mood.
Dr Millar would do well to re-read
the article of Professor J. D. B. Miller,
“The Great Defence Humbug”
(Bulletin, 20/6/64), in which he
stated: “With proper air and sea support,
we could perform the sort of feat the Bri-
tish are now able to perform with their
‘ever-readies’. We should not have to
leave our troops in the one place for a
long time (as now in Malaya) because
of nothing with which to replace them.”
At present we lack sufficient ships and
aircraft to ensure the arrival of our
existing small army at its objectives, and
its maintenance, in the face of enemy
opposition. Australia’s need for a mari-
time stategy should be too obvious to
need stressing. Perhaps the best way of
emphasising it is to suggest that the
defence of Australia would be better
served if the Australian Army became
a corps d’elite of “ever-readies”—the
Royal Australian Marines!

AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE
Sir,
Mr B. C. Newland (15/8/64) says it
js “a pity ‘Major Mitchell’ has allowed
himself several assertions which may
have been true once upon a time and
others which are certainly not the only
'alid interpretations of the facts”.
Since his letter appeared, I have re-
studied “Bye Bye Birdie” (4/7/64)
most carefully. I was unable to find
an Y “assertion” unqualified by date
01 tense. I find it hard to believe that
anyone was left in doubt as to whether
any particular reference was to a past or
present circumstance.
“Once upon a time” could have been
an apt opening expression to use in re-
lating the fairy-tale-like activities of the
Zoological Society of SA. Nevertheless, I
feel it is not really the right phrase to
employ in the context. Mr Newlands has
placed it in an allusion to events the
most remote of which in time is 1959!
As to my “interpretation” of the facts,
I very carefully (being mindful of the
laws of libel) avoided any interpretation
of the known facts at all, “valid” or
otherwise, excepting only the conclusion
with which Mr Newland himself agrees
that “the role of some zoos seems a
question for very close Government
scrutiny”. I also made it very clear the
SA Government did not support the
Adelaide Zoo’s shenanigans in any way.
“MAJOR MITCHELL"
“US STUDENTS”
Sir,
Mr Neville Langdon (22/8/64)
speaks grandly of “us students”, and in-
sists that “we are not impressed . .
(an odd reminiscence of Queen Vic-
toria). I spoke only for myself, and of
course was not criticising students in
general, but only that small self-assertive
minority whose distaste for institutions
(“the Establishment”?) seems congruous
with their seeking institutional power and
then abusing it.
What surprises me is that Mr Lang-
don is more interested in disapproving
of me than in criticising “Honi Soit’s”
Nazi interlude. Will he tell your readers
to what conclusions about Nazism he is
led by his search for “utter honesty”?
Vincent Buckley
University of Melbourne.
Sir,
I should like to enquire on whose be-
half Neville Langdon (22/8/64) thought
his neat little piece of personal invective
on Mr Vincent Buckley was written. He
says, “We are not impressed by Mr Buck-
ley’s style of life, personally, or by the
class of individual to which he belongs”,
the “we” apparently referring to “us stu-
dents” and, more generally, “my own
generation”. As a member of this genera-
tion, and a student of Mr Buckley’s, I
should like to express my surprise at the
way Mr Langdon takes it upon himself
to advance his own strange views on be-
half of so many people, and my strongest
objection to this public airing of his un-
important opinions of Mr Buckley per-
sonally.
In addition, I suggest Mr Langdon
should do something about his powers of
critical appreciation. Whatever one’s
views are on student nihilism, it is diffi-
cult to see how anyone could interpret
Mr Buckley’s letter as “a gratuitous piece
of woolliness”. Incidentally, this “ageing
obscurantist” is 38 years old.

SERVICEMEN
Sir,
Your columns have recently carried
the banner for a better deal for Service-
men. Well, they seem to have got it and
could you therefore now ask them to stop
moaning, roll up their sleeves and get
down to doing the job for which they
are now being so well paid to do by the
taxpayers.
When one mixes with Service admini-
strators it is rarely that you hear a job
of work being discussed. The topic is
always more pay and better conditions,
and their energies are directed almost
solely to preparing submissions on such
matters.
How many business executives who
are required to accept responsibility and
display initiative in the competitive world
in which they operate are paid the
equivalent of a married major or lieuten-
ant-colonel, namely £3384 and £3804
respectively, plus free medical and dental
treatment?
Let's all stop overbidding for such
carefree occupations and direct our
efforts to ensuring that Service officers
are made aware of their responsibility to
the taxpayers for doing a job of work.

SINGAPORE RIOTS
Sir,
In your “Plain English Singapore’s
Riots” (8/8/64) it was wrong, in fact,
to say, “The simple fact is that Lee Kuan
Yew's dynamic PAP has done more with
slum clearance, energetic development
of industrial estates like Jurong and the
development of social and community
services than is yet thought of in Ma-
laya”. Consequently, it is quite false to
argue that “Alliance political jealousy in
Kuala Lumpur” is based on inferior
achievements in economic and social ad-
vance compared with the PAP's efforts
in Singapore. Slum clearance is hardly
relevant in Malaya, where poverty is
overwhelmingly of a rural nature. The
Government is making very strenuous
efforts to speed the economic advance
of the peasants, and the fact that these
happen to be Malays should surely not
sustain a charge of “communalism”
against the Alliance.
Malaya has a very long lead over
Singapore where industrial estates are
concerned. As to the development of
social and community services, it seems
that you are quite unaware of the details
of Malaya’s investment in social services
and infrastructure. Malaya’s approach to
economic development can certainly be
criticised, but hardly on the grounds of
inadequate provision of infrastructure.
Indeed, some critics have suggested that
the Development Plan places rather too
much emphasis upon the construction of
social overhead capital.
There may be communal extremists
within the Alliance and it is indeed true
that many Australians regard Malaysia
with misplaced “mindless enthusiasm”.
Nevertheless, your picture of a bumbling,
graft-ridden administration in Kuala
Lumpur presided over by an uneasy alli-
ance of communal groups is quite in-
accurate.
Most Malaysian citizens abhor vio-
lence and are well aware of the dangers
of communalism. With all its faults,
Malaysia is “the most orderly, trouble-
free country in Asia” yet no other de-
veloping country in Asia is handicapped
by such a potentially explosive racial
mixture. Surely the remarkable thing is
that rioting is so rare.

UNIVERSITY ALP CLUB
Sir,
Mr Jim Jupp in his rejoinder to Dr
Knopfelmacher (15/8/64) has signifi-
cantly neglected to mention the notorious
Victorian Central Executive of the ALP
in his analysis of the situation within
the Melbourne University ALP Club.
This body has effectively controlled all
opposition to its pro-Communist policies
from within the party, particularly from
its intellectuals. Frustrated by its elec-
toral failure, inhibited by fear of ex-
pulsion and having a love-hate relation-
ship to their source of political aspira-
tion, there is no wonder that a sickness
exists within university ALP circles. Dr
Knopfelmacher, who is one of the strong-
est antagonists of the VCE, has been pro-
jected to appear the cause of this illness.
Knopfelmacher has always opposed anti-
democratic and anti-intellectual tenden-
cies from both within and without the
university. In this he has shown great
moral courage. One of the few contro-
versialists at Melbourne University, his
highly intelligent discussion of topics,
ranging from the psychology of racial
prejudice to Marxism, are one of the few
highlights in a generally unedifying and
conformist university. His seminars have
attracted very capable students into the
ALP club, even though they have not
always agreed with his point of view.
To correct a serious misconception
made by Mr Jupp, the ALP Club has
never been up an anti-Communist blind
alley. It has been concerned with issues
of race relations involving anti-apartheid
and anti-WAP campaigns. It has pro-
tested against the Liberal Governments
censorship policies and conducted high-
level political discussion, such as the
Thomas Memorial Lectures given by
Crosland and Kamenka.

A dairy task force 500,000 strong
Look at lush, green dairy pastures . . . then see butter, cheese
and milk processing plants housing some of the most modern
equipment in the world—symmetrical layouts of gleaming
stainless steel and white enamel . . . add to these a complex
system of transport and distribution . . . then spread through
this closely knit network an army of Australians, 500,000 strong,
and you have just a glimpse of the benefit to the community
of the mammoth Dairy Industry.
Yearly output is 1,500 million gallons of whole milk—2oo,ooo
tons of butter—s6,ooo tons of cheese. Standing behind this
highly efficient industry is the producer, the man on the land
• . . traditional image of our national prosperity and progress.
Australian exports of dairy products are around £44 millions,
waking a vital contribution to our overseas income and an
all-time record for the industry. An export marketing
expansion programme promises a still brighter future.
Perhaps more important, however, is consideration of the
future potential of our home market. Australian consumption
dairy foods is one of the highest in the world, being 1,100 lbs.
Per head per year. It is anticipated that our population will
increase by 21 million in the next ten years, and will call for
2? additional 25% of dairy production. At the moment only
of our output is exported so that in this short space of
time we will consume all of our exportable surplus unless
considerable production expansion is achieved.
Pastures for dairying account for 25% of all spray and flood-
irrigated land for all purposes in Australia, and additional
food production will rest heavily on irrigation expansion. Water,
because it is Australia’s scarcest commodity, is the one limiting
factor. It is stated that at our present rate of development,
we will require 50% more water within ten years, or, alter-
natively, we must re-arrange our farm water use. Water
management will shape the extent and pace of our progress.
Throughout Australia, Hardie’s Distributors are key men in
the Irrigation Industry. They were selected for their knowledge,
experience and capacity to cope with the big tasks ahead.
They represent Australia’s biggest and most experienced manu-
facturer of irrigation piping and they are ready to give you
service and advice at a personal level.

THE SYLLABUS
Sir,
In many of the published views in the
daily Press on the proposed syllabus of
Christian education in NSW, it is gen-
erally advocated that we should give
equal time and opportunity for our child-
ren to be taught the philosophy of hea-
then religions. Any world traveller wil
know, even if he is not specifically a
Christian missionary, that in lands where
Islam, Buddha and Hinduism hold swaj
their religion gives only a nebulous hope
for the future, and imparts no motive
for present living. This is to say nothing
ol the degradation and misery in which
countless millions of their adherents sij
live.
Were not most of the hospitals am
healing services, notably leper missions
the result of Christian missions, even now
being largely maintained by them, oftet
in spite of continuing opposition fron
national governments?
I consider that the present moral de
cadence and lawlessness, particularly ii
Christian countries, is due to a lack of
specific Christian education.

NATIONAL SERVICE
Sir,
While university students appreciate
the necessity to bolster in some way Aust-
ralia's pitifully inadequate defence forces
we have strong reservations about the
current moves to reintroduce compul-
sory National Service training. It is cleat
from unhappy past experience, that any
such scheme would have to be based os
two years’ full-time service.
We feel it is important that the special
position of university students be con-
sidered in this context. In the interests oi
a community desperately short of tea-J
chers, doctors and other qualified pro-
fessional men, students should not b (
forced to delay the completion of then
courses by undertaking military training

“When I travel I don’t want to waste time.
I can’t afford to. That’s why I flew Pan Am
on my last trip.”
—says Mr. Clare Higson of Sydney, President, A.S.E.M. Export Association.
“I like to see my overseas customers,
then get right back home to my office.
I need an airline that flies everywhere—
without unnecessary changes of plane
and wasted time. An airline with world-
wide connections. Like Pan Am. I flew
49,000 miles with them on my last trip.”
As Mr. Higson found out, world-wide
connections make a world of difference
on a long business trip. Pan Am’s con-
venient schedule lets the busy executive
leave when he wants to, arrive when he
has to. The reason? Pan Am flies more
Jets to more places than any other air-
line. More across the Pacific. More
across the Atlantic. More ’Round the
World. It’s no wonder that so many
international businessmen choose to fly
on the World’s Most Experienced Air-
line. For first-class President Special or

LEARN FRENCH* AS NATURALLY AS HE DID
BY LISTENING
He learnt French as a child by listening to other people. You can do exactly the same
through Linguaphone. The only difference is that you listen to the voices of distinguished
speakers and professors on Linguaphone recordings (45 r.p.m. or tape). What they say
is specially designed to help you learn the language in a short time —an incredibly short
time.
Learning by Linguaphone is wonderfully easy. The process of learning almost takes you
by surprise You find yourself speaking the language, capturing the right accent and
intonation without any particular effort. To make sure you learn the written language at
the same time, you follow each lesson in an illustrated textbook. Linguaphone is the finest
audio-visual way of learning a language.
Over a million people have learned a language in this way choosing from thirty-
seven separate languages.

National Notebook
Lamb and the Lion
“T’jyi the oldest exhibition organiser in
A captivity,” was how Mr D. A. Lamb
described himself when we called to see
him last week at BOAC House in Sydney,
gr Lamb is general manager of British
Overseas Fairs, and has come to Austra-
lia to stage the £2sm. British Exhibition
at the Sydney Showground, beginning on
September 25. The exhibition, to be held
in conjunction with a British Military
Tournament and Tattoo, and with a
“British Fortnight” in which 2000 Sydney
retailers are co-operating, will be the
biggest show in his 35-year career.
Mr. Lamb, a likeable man with a
brisk, persuasive manner, told us that he
has been with British Overseas Fairs Ltd
since it was set up in 1953 by the Federa-
tion of British Industries. Like a soldier
recalling old campaigns he listed the
British exhibitions he has organised:
Baghdad '54, Copenhagen ’55, Brussels
’5B, Lisbon '59, New York '6O. “In Bagh-
dad,” he said, “I built an ice rink in the
desert in an ambient temperature of 130
degrees, and we brought out the Brighton
Ice Follies to put on a show. We were
demonstrating refrigeration machinery.
The sheiks wanted to buy the equipment,
all right, but only if they could have the
girls, too. They actually had the money
with them when they came to see me.”
We were about to remark to Mr Lamb
that it seemed ironical for this Sydney
exhibition, with its emphasis on Com-
monwealth trade, to come so soon after
Britain's failure to enter the Common
Market. He must have sensed the
thought hovering in the air, and it was
with evident pleasure that he shot it
down. “The exhibition’s got nothing to do
with the Common Market business,” he
said decisively. “The planning for it start-
ed in 1959. The Showground was booked
long before we were de-Gaulled. There’s
no ‘Rule Britannia’ thing about this. I
don't believe sentiment applies when
you're out to do business: We're offering
British goods simply on the basis of price,
quality and service.
“Let's face it,” he went on. “We’re
all busy buying and selling with our
former enemies; but contrary to what
everyone here seems to think, Britain is
still a bigger customer for Australia than
Japan. Last year Japan was in front
Part of the time, but she’s a seasonal
buyer, whereas we trade continuously.
Over the whole year Britain bought £256
million from you and Japan bought £244
million." An afterthought occurred to
bim and he murmured, “We’ve got no
restrictions on your meat, either.”
We asked Mr Lamb did he think there
was an appeal to Commonwealth senti-
ment in the staging of the tournament,
with its resounding names of participa-
ting regiments—the Grenadier Guards,
the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders, and so on. He
brushed the idea aside. “The tattoo suc-
ceeds because it’s bloody good entertain-
ment,” he said. “It’s a fantastic show.
We’re flying 500 troops and bandsmen
here at a cost of £150,000, and some of
them right at this moment are on active
service in the Borneo jungle. They’re
coming for a rest.
“No,” he said, “the only sentiment
about the tattoo is that the two Sunday
performances which we finally got per-
mission to hold will include a bit of
religion.”
Fair’s Fair
'jl/IELBOURNE is having problems with
its plans for a World Fair. The Pre-
mier, of all people, shocked the citizens of
the council when he was disloyal enough
to say: “I don’t want to knock the fair
until all the facts are known, but my
personal feeling is that it would be well
nigh impossible to finance.” The next
day Sir Maurice Nathan, who thought of
this thing, arrived home from his world
fair inspection tour. “With all respect to
my Premier,” said he, “Mr Bolte has
never ever seen a world fair.” And he
pointed out that could be the biggest
peacetime project ever undertaken in
Australia apart from the Snowy Moun-
tains scheme.
At the same time the public relations
department in the Southern Cross Hotel
was doing some lovely word-spinning.
A hand-out went around the city point-
ing out that, apart from its broad educa-
tional and cultural aims, the fair could be
fun. And it suggested some ideas. We
give a few quotes:
“A great saving on the wear and tear
of tourists who like to dash madly to all
corners of the continent to seek out Aus-
tralia’s unusual fauna in its native habitat
could be concentrated into one time-
saving section of the fairgrounds. Here
in this artificial sanctuary would be
gathered all the cute Australian animals
and birds which visitors love to drc-ol
over . . . platypi, kangaroos, lyre-birds,
wallabies, koalas, brolgas.
“Close by this setting, we could have
a bush maze, into which the more ad-
venturous types could penetrate. To ob-
viate the danger of becoming completely
lost and possibly left in the fairgrounds
overnight, each maze walker would be
provided with a coo-ee whistle, which
when blown loudly as a signal of distress
would quickly bring to his side a qualified
blacktracker (authentic).
“If the visitor were thirsty after his
experience, the blacktracker could assist
by rubbing a couple of sticks together,
making a fire and brewing a mug or two
of steaming billy tea, spiked with eucalyp-
tus leaves to add flavor to the brew and
atmosphere to the occasion.”
There are further suggestions of a
special Aussie Rules footy championship,
a Royal Show with woodchopping and
even coconut shies, using boomerangs
instead of padded balls ... all this and
much more. But in the meantime it is
coo-ee until we get the next hand-out.
Penny Foolish
IVl’essages to airline passengers over the
intercom in flight are well form-
alised now, so that many veteran travel-
lers can chant by heart the ritual of
hostess’s welcome, captain's weather and
flight report, and hostess's farewell. Any
change in the routine is a godsend. Pas-
sengers in aircraft out of Canberra the
other evening scored well. The captain
came on with a request for them all to
search their pockets and handbags for
a “counterfeit 1930 penny”.
The 1930 penny when genuine, is worth
about £BO on the numismatical market.
The captain explained that it was a
Canberra police request: the bad penny
had been passed out at the Canberra
Airport kiosk. We all searched, with a
kind of embarrassed hilarity, but with-
out success, only to learn in a few
minutes that the coin had been found in
another place, “heading for Perth”.
We mean sometime to look into this,
and find out what goes on at Canberra
Airport kiosk. In the meantime we re-
commend earth-to-air audience partici-
pation as a new gimmick to keep the
passengers’ minds off flying.
Spelling It Out
A father we know has just received
the prospectus and application form
from the Yarra Valley Church of
England School at Ringwood. The
school looks very promising indeed and


according to the prospectus it plans to
open in 1966. Only one thing disturbs
this father. There’s a section he has to
fill in which reads: “Farther’s name in
full . .
Admiral’s Cup
TTnusual winter activity among Syd-
ney’s ocean yacht racing types
prompted us to call for explanation on
Mr Norman Rydge, Jnr, winner of last
year’s winter points score.
There was, he told us, increased in-
terest in sail throughout Australia.
“But undoubtedly Australia’s intention
to send a team to compete in next year’s
Admiral’s Cup series has a lot to do
with it. So far seven boats are ready
to go to Britain. We have to select
three.”
Were the Sunday races elimination
events? We asked.
“No, these are the usual winter races
—actually started by the Cruising Yacht
Club to help the ocean boats keep their
hand in. But Australian challenge con-
tenders are participating with crack
crews offering their services—including
quite a few Gretel men.
“It’s quite a plum. Fares are paid to
the UK and back.
“The total time away from Australia
will be less than five weeks, and few
firms would begrudge that much leave
of absence for such a cause. Some eight
nations possibly including the Soviet
Union will be conipeting.
“The only ones we’re really concerned
about are the Yanks. We’ve seen some
good British boats come out to compete
in our Hobart race and their per-
formances indicate we rate pretty high
as ocean racers.”
Final selection will be made after
studying the results of four races set
down for later this year. These are the
Montagu Island and Cabbage Tree Island
events as well as two special 30-mile
ocean races.
“Choice may not boil down to the
place-getters,” said Mr Rydge. “If all
races are sailed in stormy weather, we
might decide to select a light weather
boat just to be on the safe side.”
Victory in the series could depend on
a sensitive craft’s performance in a light
weather event. The six boats ready to
represent Australia include last Hobart
winner Freya, owned and skippered by
the Halvorsen brothers, Salacia, Caprice
of Hiton, Norla and Mercedes all
veteran ocean yachts.
Two newcomers also make bids for
inclusion: a mighty 52ft Alan Payne-
designed steel-hulled sloop , Bacchus, an( j
the as yet unlaunched sloop, Camille
by well-known builder Ron Swanson.
Besides Rydge; the committee com-
prises Cruising Yacht Club Commodore
Bill Psaltis and Trygve Halvorsen. The
Prime Minister is patron.
Norman Rydge will be taking his
champion Lorita Maria over, too. “B ut
unofficially, we’re only 30ft on the
waterline—too short to make the team
“I want to sail her in the Fastnet
Race,” he said firmly. This 600-mile
ordeal takes boats from Plymouth

PLAIN ENGLISH
Heading Towards a
Dien Bien Phu
Couth Vietnam slides fast to
destruction and the US towards
another Dien Bien Phu. The choices
facing the US in South Vietnam, as
in South-East Asia generally, are
scarcely encouraging. As Dennis
Bloodworth points out in “No Room
For Neutrals” on page 31, the Ame-
ricans are victims of circumstances.
For a variety of reasons they are
suspect in most parts of Asia but
the principal reason is the creeping
paralysis of will and effort evident
throughout the sub-continent which
fear of China has engendered. Most
Asian leaders obviously believe that
China must, in the long run, win.
In Djakarta President Soekarno
shouts, “To hell with American
aid.” In Pnom Penh, Sihanouk
praises the forces of “anti-colonial-
ism”. In Rangoon, Ne Win will
\ accept only token American aid and
in Colombo, Mrs Bandaranaike will
accept none at all. Not one of these
leaders is a Communist; not one of
them is anything but a devout
believer in the sovereignty of his
country; not one believes he can
survive with American help and
not one has forgotten the brutal and
effective way China’s armies reduced
to dust the pretensions of India to
lead and to survive r, n indepen-
dent non-aligned nation.
South Vietnam is a perfect ex-
ample of the American dilemma.
Its government is weak and fre-
quently corrupt. Its people are
weary of nearly a generation of war
and of religious murder. Half of the
country is occupied by ruthless,
highly-skilled Communist terrorists
from North Vietnam. It can only
survive by a massive injection of
American military aid and by
strong, authoritarian American pres-
sure on its Government to reform.
To the Americans who have never
forgotten either the losses or the
humiliations of Korea the war
they did not win this can scarcely
be an attractive proposition. The
knowledge that such intervention
might lead to an unsuccessful or in-
conclusive war with China while
confirming America’s image in
Asian eyes as imperialist and neo-
colonialist can only make the pro-
position completely hideous.
And yet what are the alternatives?
Unless US military aid to South
Vietnam is stepped up on a mas-
sive scale it will succumb to the
Vietcong with all the military and
political implications such a defeat
would have for the security and
stability of South-East Asia’s only
two resolutely anti-Peking countries
Malaysia and Thailand. The de
Gaullist neutralist solution for South
Vietnam so much admired by
Sihanouk, Ne Win and others
seems not so much a solution as a
device for procuring peace on a
short-term basis, for buying time to
take a last breath before being
submerged. We should not dismiss
the possibility that the US in this
messy situation may be obliged to
seek a neutralist solution for South
Vietnam but equally we, no less
than the Americans, should have
no illusions that such an agreement
will achieve anything but put off,
for a while, the evil day of an ef-
fective takeover by China not only
of South Vietnam but probably of
all South-East Asia.
the NSW Government
has decided to suspend the new
General Religious Teaching syllabus
pending a review by the NSW Edu-
cation Department syllabus com-
mittee, the public will still assume,
or hope, that the committee will
make no significant changes in it.
At worst one may criticise the
NSW Education Department for
lack of tact, in not having consulted
church leaders before writing or pro-
claiming the new syllabus. But even
this is a matter of tact, not of deep
principle, since school syllabuses are
by tradition exclusively a matter
for educational authorities, not for
outside bodies, however respectable.
It would certainly be interpreted
as a bad precedent if educationists
announced they feel obliged to con-
sult a non-educational authority
that feels its interests affected by an
educational decision. However this
may be, the NSW Government has
now taken steps to clear itself even
of the charge of tactlessness.
The central point is that the new
syllabus met requirements of the
Public Instruction Act, which ex-
cludes dogmatic religious teaching
A Tactical Withdrawal?
from the secular syllabus (leaving
that to the clergy’s lessons) but
includes general religious teaching.
The 1959 syllabus, which was the
object of so much indignation, wrote
Christian dogmas into the secular
syllabus on which children were
compulsorily examined, and was of-
fensive to non-believers, Jews and
quite a few Christians. The new
syllabus remedied that mischief, and
naturally left dogmatic religious in-
struction its traditional place in
schools in the special lessons Tor
that purpose. Any serious retreat
from this position will not only re-
vive justifiable anger but will breach
the Act. One may sympathise with
those who feel that vague ethical
teaching is worse than nothing, but
they, if they are Christians, should
give greater attention to the religious
periods, and if they are not
Christian, should advocate amend-
ment of the Act to remove this
“general religious teaching” from the
secular syllabus.
While the Act stands, the new
syllabus must be defended and the
NSW Government should, with the
minimum delay, reinstate the new
syllabus.

THIS AUSTRALIA
THE VOYAGER
Definitely Not
A “Whitewash” Job
How far can a Royal Commissioner go?
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
SPICER, J.
Not to punish
Before Mr Justice Spicer’s report was
published, one of the leading quest-
ions was: just how far can a Royal
Commissioner feel free to make state-
ments about the responsibility of indivi-
duals when legal proceedings (in this
case courts martial) are likely after his
report?
Now that the report has been tabled,
amid the usual flurry of “whitewash”
from those who like to see other people
in trouble, this question has been
answered. The Royal Commissioner
was scrupulously descriptive in his re-
port of the actions of those on the Mel-
bourne’s bridge. The harshest words,
referring to acting Sub-Lt Bate, were:
“failed to exercise sufficient care as
officer of the watch to protect his own
vessel from collision.” In general terms,
the watch maintained by both Bate and
Commander Kelly was: “inadequate”.
On the commander of Melbourne,
Captain R. J. Robertson, the report was
again descriptive, weighing up the
factors and making the point that: “I
cannot help but feel that the chances of
collision occurring might have been less-
ened if some action as I have indicated
had been taken by Captain Robertson”.
from these examples it is clear that
the Royal Commissioner saw his role
as finding causes, not of setting punish-
ments. So the decision of the Naval
Board on possible courts martial now
becomes the main question.
A decision on courts martial would
place the imponderable question of
degree of negligence and the difficult
question of penalties before a court (or
several courts) of naval officers. This
function could not have been fairly carri-
ed out by the Royal Commissioner in
his report and it was almost certainly
ibis realisation that led Mr Justice Spicer
1° choose his words very deliberately.
First the Naval Board has the task of
deciding whether the austerely descriptive
Phrases of the Royal Commissioner war-
ra nt court martial action. Therefore the
m °st important moments in the career of
the three officers involved, Captain
Robertson, Commander Kelly and acting
Sub-Lt Bate, will be when the Prime
Minister rises to his feet in the House
to announce the report of the Board.
Apart from these possible legal re-
percussions the other question is
whether there will have to be any fun-
damental changes in naval procedures.
The Commissioner’s recommendations
are, while obviously important, marginal.
It is clear that life belt placement and
swimming training procedures will have
to be changed, but these do not con-
stitute major policy matters.
Nor do the other recommendations on
the availability of spanners, on the need
for working up exercises to take place
in day-time first, and for senior officers
to confer before such exercises, amount
to radical changes.
Nevertheless, one of the points that
is being lost in the reactions to the re-
port is that the job of the Commission
was not to conduct an investigation into
the Royal Australian Navy, but to look
at the fadts about one disaster.
Even on that level the Voyager affair
is a long way from being over.
DEFENCE
The Quiet Rebel v. the
Minister for the Army
Jess’s Half Hour
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
JOHN JESS
Coldly
TI/lost Federal Parliamentary rebels like
the prima donna broadcasting hour
of 8 p.m. to make their speeches. But
young John Jess, Liberal representative
for the Victorian electorate of Latrobe,
last week put himself into a different
category. He elected to be a “quiet
rebel”. Yet in a speech which started
on last Tuesday night at 11.23 p.m. and
concluded at 11.53 p.m. (a speaking time
which was likely to secure him the
minimum of publicity), Jess, 42, a
former estate agent (and hence probably
not a man to whom his Parliamentary
salary is unimportant) flayed the Gov-
ernment in a speech which, without
flourishes, was probably more devastating
than any delivered by the Opposition.
Coldly Jess took the six qualities that
the Army Minister, Mr Forbes, had said
the Australian Army must have. These
were: (1) adequate size; (2) mobility;
(3) availability; (4) capacity to move at
a moment’s notice; (5) adequate equip-
ment, and (6) equipment suitable for the
area to which the Army was likely to go.
Has it the size? Ruthlessly Jess
analysed the break-up through staffs,
trainees, headquarters and cadres for
CMF units when the strength of the
Army was 22,000. His conclusion based
on these official figures was that Aus-
tralia had a fighting force then of 7716,
including the logistic forces. Now the
Regular Forces are up to 24,000. In-
cluded in this 24,000 was the women’s
Services. “Have we the size that the
Minister says is essential?” Jess asked.
Has the Army mobility? Again Jess
painstakingly analysed the situation.
“Where are the ships required to move
heavy equipment, stores, tanks, bull-
dozers, and so on?” he asked.
Has it availability or the capacity to
move at a moment's notice? Again, no.
Has it the equipment? “Some years
ago the M6O machine gun was an-
nounced as standard equipment. Can
the Minister now say how many we
have? How many 105 millimetre howit-
zers? How much of the war equipment
table is planned to be filled with -303
rifles, bofors guns and twenty-five
pounders?” World War II equipment.

Bolte Mops up the £ 1 Rise
How much more can ALP voters take from
the ALP?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
MOSS
Pays to be nice
IVfR Bolte can risk a little unpopularity
over his coming Budget, having just
won an election, and achieved something
unusual in Victorian Parliamentary his-
tory in this century a majority in both
Houses. He can afford, therefore, and is
expected to mop up much of the recent
£1 Basic Wage increase by raising train
and tram fares, rail freights, gas and
electricity charges, hospital fees, drivers’
licences and stamp fees.
He can also afford to annoy country
voters (who will pay some of the new
charges) which he was careful not to do
when the Country Party held the balance
of power in the Upper House.
The Country Party's new leader, Mr
Moss, so far is not following the example
of the former leader, Sir Herbert Hyland,
for whom it was a lost day when he was
not sniping at the Bolte Government.
Moss was credited with sponsoring the
under-cover alliance with Labor, which
paid no dividends for either party at the
recent State election, but he also rep-
resents part of the Federal electorate of
John McEwen, who Las perhaps suggest-
ed to him that there is more to be got
out of co-operating with the Liberals.
(It may have been significant that the
other day Moss criticised the’naming of
Melbourne’s third university as “Latrobs”
and said that it should be called the
“Menzies” University.)
The Country Party’s interests are in-
volved heavily in the coming State re-
distribution. The Government is dropping
“two for one” the principle of two
State seats to each Federal seat, and will
redistribute on the basis of 80 rural votes
to 100 city votes. This should assist the
Country Party, provided boundaries are
not too unfavorably drawn. That makes
it good policy to be nice to the Liberals.
The ALP seems likely to be left with-
out a friend. Last year when Bolte in-
troduced a redistribution on the basis of
one vote one value, the ALP allowed it-
self to be inveigled by the Country Party
into rejecting the Bill in the Upper
House. Now the ALP will get a redis-
tribution on the 80:100 basis much
worse. Its seventeen seats could shrink to
a dozen.
How much more can the Victorian
ALP supporters take from their leaders?
PROMOTION
A World Fair for Melbourne?
"Pll meet him at the races "
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
“W hen 1 meet him at the races on
"" Saturday, I'll tell him a thing or
two about fairs,” said the former Lord
Mayor of Melbourne of the Premier of
Victoria, on arriving back home last
week from a world tour. Sir Maurice
Nathan was excited about his idea of
holding a World Fair in Melbourne in
1972 but highly indignant about Mr
Bolte’s coolness to it.
Sir Maurice, who heads a large retail
chain of furniture stores, is chairman of
the Australian World Fair Project
Committee, a group of businessmen
which is helping to finance a feasibility
study. But the day before Sir Maurice
returned, the Premier, Mr Bolte, said
he thought it would be “well nigh im-
possible” to finance a World Fair.
Everyone agrees, however, on this as-
pect: without the complete backing of the
Commonwealth, a World Fair would
never get beyond the pipe-dream stage.
The Prime Minister would have to ask
the Bureau International des Expositions
for a World Fair for Australia, and the
Treasury would have to supply funds.
A British fairs and promotions expert,
Mr Edwards, in Australia for the British
Exhibition in Sydney, pointed out one
difficulty: With defence, education and
national development straining Federal
resources, can we afford the outlay of
anything up to £lOO million for intang-
ible returns? Even New York’s World
Fair is already running into financial
difficulties.


LAW -I
Virtue Rewarded
[?]116 lawyers for the defence
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
Herbie” Ernst Graham, Labor’s
Eddie Ward of the West, caused
jproar in the WA Legislative Assembly
f as t week when he said Mr Justice Virtue
vas unfit to be a judge. He said Mr
Justice Virtue’s sentence of a maximum
lof two years’ gaol and 12 strokes of the
hirch on a youth for having had un-
lawful carnal knowledge of a girl under
16, was, for a first offender, excessive.
He also attacked critical remarks
■bout jury verdicts that Mr Justice
Virtue made in two cases. One was:
"This is the worst verdict I have heard
in this court.”
' J What Mr Graham did not emphasise
was that in the case, which ended in a
ibirching, the girl was a virgin abducted
by a carload of larrikins. She had tried
110 escape from the speeding car and was
held by the throat with her feet dragging
ion the road.
1 The trial was in 1962, and on an ap-
peal, the Chief Justice and two other
judges confirmed the sentence and com-
mented that it was richly deserved.
Heated scenes followed in the House
next day when Premier David Brand said
the Government deplored the use of
Parliamentary privilege to attack the
judge who, traditionally, cannot reply.
lln the Press, 116 lawyers stated their
[confidence in the judge and their dismay
iat the attack. Mr Graham then told the
[newspapers he had merely tried to stop
jjuries being intimidated by Mr Justice
Virtue. It may also be relevant to the
case that the judge is President of the
new WA Industrial Appeals Court est-
ablished by the Government and bitterly
I assailed by Labor.

The Private Eye
In the Workers'
Compensation Court
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
j|jVrHER of nine children Kimon
Christoforidis last week lost a claim
for £864 in Workers’ Compensation
yCoiirt because of a private investiga-
tor's film.
' The investigator’s film showed Christo-
foridis carrying out repairs to the roof-
°f h* s house and climbing up and down
I 1 ladder during a period he was allegedly
lnc apacitated.
fudge Williams in his judgment said
the film provided an excellent view of
the man, and his movements on the roof
were inconsistent with him having any
incapacity for work.
Christoforidis, 46, of North Street,
Marrickville, was employed as a main-
tenance fitter by Australian Glass Manu-
facturers Co. Pty Ltd, at Waterloo.
He received a back injury on October 5,
1962, at the company’s factory while
tightening a conveyor belt. For five
months the company paid compensation
until a private investigator managed to
obtain the film. Christoforidis claimed
compensation from March 9, 1963, to
December 10, 1963.

“The Oil Honeymoon
is over”
The Cost of living with Moonie crude
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Dr. M. MACKAY
Long knives
HTaking tobacco, for example, as a pre-
A cedent, Mr Beaton, Federal Member
for Bendigo, was on firm ground last
week in asking the Minister for National
Development, Mr Fairbairn, to legislate
to ensure that the consumption of crude
oil by Australian oil refineries included
a fixed percentage from Australian wells,
which up to this point means only
Moonie crude. But, as with tobacco, the
vital question is: At what price?
As for legislating on the matter, Mr
Fairbairn, like Sir William Spooner be-
fore him, is clearly reluctant. He could
only say the Government had the whole
question of the use of Australian crude
oil under close examination and hoped
the refineries would play ball without
Government intervention.
Earlier in the Budget debate, Dr Mal-
colm Mackay, who has projected himself
as a Parliamentary oil expert since his
recent advent to Canberra, said that soon
the refining companies “would devoutly
wish all indigenous Australian crude back
in the rocks from which it came” and
that their “long honeymoon of importing
cheap crude was over”. The struggle over
the price they would pay for Australian
crude “makes it reasonable to believe
that the long knives are out and sharp
for the coming negotiations”.
As with local oil in the USA, he seemed
to think the price here should be deter-
mined by a mixture of Government and
industrial controls, at a level which would
keep the rewards of exploration and new
discovery sufficiently high to encourage
UNDENOMINATIONAL GEOGRAPHY
fa&ulUtia
80 Years Ago: September 6, 1884
Qince the failure of Bishop Barry
(RC) to work up any sort of
agitation against the undenominational
character of the Public School teach-
ing, his partisans have resorted to dark
and devious devices. They have even
attempted to seduce the minds of the
young through their Australian Geo-
graphy, and to instil poison into the
public mind by the medium of parish
maps. To an emissary of Satan, or
Bishop Barry, or the Pope we are
not sure which fell the business of
dividing into three parishes, the parish
of Corong. He expended upon the
requisite work, in mapping, draught-
ing and so forth, several months of
time. And finding no local names
which would come handy for the new
parishes, he named the subivisions the
Parish of Barry and the Parish of
Moran. This outrage came under the
observation of a high-minded and
public-spirited officer, who instantly
detected the latent mischief of such
nomenclature. Were our people to be
wronged and demoralised by such
insidious methods, and he stand by?
Not if he knew it! God forbid! You
bet! He ordered the division to be
True, this nullified the
value of all the work done. It cost the
country something, truly. But what
of that? The integrity of our undenom-
inational and unsectarian geography
was preserved.

large-scale search. His approach was
rather different from Beaton's. A first
step for the Government was to follow
the US and fix a quota for all imported
crude. A second was for the Govern-
ment to decide on the pricing of local
crude, which should not be less than
the price set for local oil in the US and
Canada.
The refining companies have not been
silent either. Welcoming a discussion on
a possible national fuels policy, Mr E.
Angus Jones, Managing - Director of
Mobil, which has refineries in Victoria
and South Australia, said some of the
changes suggested have a multi-million
cost tag which would ultimately have to
be pinned on consumers.
Contrary to Mackay’s claims, he was
most emphatic that the international oil
companies have not been taking con-
sumers for a ride all these years. He
said that all along Mobil recognised that
any oil produced in Australia would have
to be refined here, and quite early re-
corded with the Government its willing-
ness to take up its share at a fair price.
The price ultimately set for Moonie
crude was considerably higher than the'
cost of imported Middle East crude,
stated that a locally-owned refiner flatty
refused to purchase Moonie crude at the
price which the overseas-owned com-
panies were called upon to pay for it
On the other side, he added, it was now
being stated that the price oil companies
were paying for imported crude was tool
high.
“To say the least, this is confusing,
Mr Jones said. “If overseas crude im-*
ported into Australia was priced on the
Moonie basis, it could cost Australia as
much as an additional £2O million
a year in foreign exchange.”

The Doctors’
Stories
"No Pensioners Wanted ”
FROM A MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT
Ane result of an article in last week’s
The Bulletin (“The Doctor's Story,,
Why I was fined £1500”) has been the}
formation of a pool of doctors who, likei
the doctor in that article, have been;
examined, and fined, by the Pensioner?
Medical Service Committee of Enquiry
in the past and who will now offer free
advice to future alleged “victims.”
This development also highlights the
increasing number of suburban doctors',
waiting rooms which have a placard
outside: “No Pensioners”. Until now, the;
explanation had to be sought in thel
usually anonymous letters to the “Medi-j
cal Journal of Australia” written by
general practitioners complaining that
they have been “done over” by the Pen-,'
sioner Medical Services Committee of
Enquiry, with a subsequent cut-back in)
their monthly pensioner service
from the Commonwealth.
Recently two Sydney general prac-i
titioners in a medical partnership, insteadi
of writing an anonymous letter to the
“Medical Journal”, successfully sued thej
Commonwealth in respect of disallowedj
pensioner medical service fees. The
judgment of Mr Justice Sugerman, the’
presiding judge in the NSW Full Court in
this case (Perkins v. Commonwealth),
that over £4OOO in fees should not have
been disallowed, was satisfactory for
these two general practitioners, but
had little effect on the now large and in-
creasingly growing numbers of p raC j
titioners who, after submitting to thel
Committee, find their pension medics
services fees slashed.

The general practitioners in the newly-

a better position than the regular medical

HEALTH - II
Golden Sands and
Typhoid Water?
" All very well to criticise , but sewage has to go
somewhere ”
W. SHEAHAN
No comment
FROM GORDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
A report last week that Sydney
** beaches from Cronulla to north of
Manly are heavily contaminated by
sewage pollution, including typhoid and
paratyphoid organisms, has apparently
struck NSW health authorities dumb.
The Minister for Health, Mr “Billy”
Sheahan, perhaps remembering the re-
cent furore over the Mona Vale Hos-
pital, has had nothing to say, and the
Department of Health hierarchy, it
seems, has been told to remain silent
until the Minister deems it fit to speak.
The Bulletin also approached Dr
E, S. A. Meyers, Director of State Health
Services, seeking an “official view”. It
was: “No comment, I’m sorry. Any
statement will have to come from the
Minister.” This was the reaction down
through the ranks.
The issue arose early last week when
the report, compiled by the Chief Medi-
cal Officer of the Sydney Water Board
s (Dr Michael J. Flynn) and the Chief
Chemist (Mr D. K. B. Thistlethwayte)
was released simultaneously in Sydney
Tokyo where it was being presented
at an international conference on water
(Pollution research.
. ft was contained in a paper “Sewerage
j Pollution and Sea Bathing”.
The report says:
| • Sydney beaches from Cronulla to
i north of Manly are contaminated by
sewage pollution, including typhoid and
I Paratyphoid organisms.
• This 20-mile stretch of water, in
I ®Mch thousands of people surf during
I summer months, absorbs 150 million gal-
'°ns of sewage every day.
• There are eight outlets pumping the
sewage and greasy industrial wastes into
'he main surfing areas.
The report also notes, more cheerfully,
that practically all cases of typhoid and
paratyphoid in Sydney in the past 10
years have been traced to contacts other
than swimming.
Occasional tests in the sewers indicate
that typhoid and paratyphoid organisms
were commonly present in the sewage
reaching the outfalls, although doctors,
pharmacists, schools and hospitals serv-
ing the areas have reported no increase
in typhoid, paratyphoid, infective hepa-
titis, or poliomyelitis among the coastal
population as compared with inland
groups. (Half NSW’s population lives in
the metropolitan area of Sydney, while
the other half lives a considerable dis-
tance from the beaches. But, says the
report, the incidence of infectious
diseases is similar for both groups.)
The Royal Surf Life Saving Associa-
tion reports that more than 4000 swim-
mers are rescued from drowning each
year; many of whom have swallowed
sea water but no infectious diseases have
been reported.
Health authorities believe that swim-
ming in any water causes an appreciable
risk of eye, ear, nose, or throat infec-
tions. But there was no evidence in
Sydney that swimming in sea water,
whether polluted or not, was the cause
of more illness of this type than swim-
ming in chlorinated fresh water swim-
ming pools.
The report says that new sewage
treatment works were under way, which
promised to ease the problem. The ex-
tension of outfalls of up to 2000 feet
offshore could also bring considerable
improvement.
In conclusion the report says:
• Bathing water quality involves a
poorly defined boundary between public
health and public amenity which has con-
siderable economic importance because
of the high costs of sewage treatment
plants;

• There is no evidence to justify any
current coliform standard used in public
health classification of bathing waters;
• A thorough epidemiological study
is warranted to determine the possibility
of obtaining a firm basis for a standard;
• If no such basis can be obtained
then bathing water quality becomes a
matter for aesthetic judgment.
In Sydney, an Associate Professor in
Bacteriology at the Sydney Hospital, Dr
D. D. Smith, described the report as
“very competent and encouraging. But
I’m not certain about the term safe from
the viewpoint of public health.”
Dr Smith's remarks are echoed by all
medical experts The Bulletin talked
with last week. Obviously if people are
swimming in diluted sewage there must
be some health hazard involved, and it
only needs one person to swallow enough
bacteria to trigger an outbreak of typ-
hoid and perhaps then will the authori-
ties sit up and take notice.
A spokesman for the Water Board said
the Board had spent millions of pounds
on treatment works at Bondi, Malabar,
Cronulla, Wollongong and Port Kembla
—an expenditure which was continuing.
He said the first stage of works to im-
prove the sewer outfall at North Head
would cost £500,000 and the total ex-
penditure on outfall improvement work
on the Sydney coastline this year would
cost more than £1 million.
Beachside council representatives have
all agreed with the contents in the re-
port. Liberal Mayor of Manly, Aid. W.
Nicholas, considers that in the past the
problem of sewage treatment had be-
come a political football. “It is all very
well to criticise, but sewage has to go
somewhere. Naturally no one is too
happy that the present bacterial level is
supposedly ‘safe’.’’ Manly Council takes
regular samplings of sea water.
A certain school of thought lends sup-
port to legislation similar to the NSW
Clean Air Act which could possibly en-
sure the problem was kept to a mini-
mum. But this step would take years to
become effective.
Meanwhile we wait for Mr “Billy
Sheahan to come out into the open with
an official view. . . .
BOXING
The Languishing
Sport
From the Stadium words
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
Australian professional boxing titles
have been changing hands with great
rapidity lately, but the only titleholder
seen at Sydney Stadium in recent months
has been middleweight Reg Hayes, who
earned about £5O in a mill with a Ger-
man boxer. It would be difficult for the
average Sydney or Brisbane follower of
boxing to name any two of the national
titleholders other than Rocky Gattellari.
Brisbane owns the bantam champion,
Noel Kunde, who is really a flyweight,
and apparently a good one. He won his
title in a match with Bob Allottey of
Ghana, also a flyweight. As there are
few other good bantams, Kunde is most
interested in a tilt at Gattellari.
The featherweight title is vacant, and
has been since Wally Taylor gave it
away several months ago. Ollie Taylor
was supposed to meet Johnny Famechon
for it in Melbourne, but there have been
delays. Famechon has met Les Dunn of
Victoria, Arthur Clarke of Brisbane, and
Max Murphy of NSW, all State champ-
ions, but for some reason he has to wait
for Ollie before becoming title-holder.
In the lightweights, Aldo Pravisani
went home, Gilberto Biondi assumed the
title, Kimpo Amarfio of Ghana took it
from him, and Biondi won it back, all
in Melbourne. David Floyd made a fairly
successful comeback in Sydney, but
whether he will meet Biondi is a matter
shrouded in the cigar mist of the Sta-
diums Ltd. board room.
The welterweight champion is Peter
Cobblah of Ghana, who won it from lan
McDonald.
The Stadium policy seems to be to
keep the fights going at Festival Hall,
Melbourne, every Friday night, with the
help of a contingent of boxers from
Ghana, wood-choppers, amateurs, and
any other help available. The Firm puts
on fights at Festival Hall in Brisbane
whenever it can. But in Sydney the
policy is to do as little about boxing as
possible. Thousands of words come out
of the Stadium about possible great
matches of the future, but action inside
the Stadium is limited to the willing
fans of Billy J. Tamer and Ray Charles.
This is patently silly. The Pacific area
contains many of the world’s best boxers,
and Australians who have supported the
Sydney Stadium for more than 50 years
deserve something from its management
in return.

THE RAG TRADE
" A goddamn crazy business..."
By BATMAN
Flinders Lane is utterly unlovely.
Admittedly its tone is uplifted near
Swanston Street by St Paul's Cathedral,
but physically it hasn't changed much
this century.
It’s a stretch of Victoriana, ugly build-
ing after ugly building, all plastered with
nameplates. Maybe the plates do not
shine with the lustre of medico plates in
the Paris end of Collins Street, but
here the tension and the blood pressure
is higher and they mean real business
just the same. You read names like
Virgo Teener Fashions, Miranda
Fashions, Schneider Manufacturing Co.,
Dorset Styles Mantle Specialists,
G. F. Tyrre —Quality Fashions, Piece-
goods, and so on.
Plastered against a window here and
there is the sign “MACHINISTS WANT-
ED, APPLY HERE”.
There are few places in the world
quite like the Lane. The nearest equiva-
lent would be the garment district in
Seventh Avenue, New York. There it
is fascinating to see the apprentices push-
ing their trolleys loaded with cheap
frocks on hangers. One occasionally
sees a trolley in the Lane, but not
often. The footpath is too narrow and
the incline too steep down from Spring
Street. More often one sees girls walk-
ing with piles of frocks over one arm, or
maybe motor cars loaded with piece-
goods in the back seat.
The Rag Trade, or if you prefer a
more genteel description, the Softgoods
Business, starts at Spring Street and
peters out five blocks down the hill to-
wards Queen Street. One time at least
three-quarters of all women’s clothing in
Australia passed through here. Since
1945 there has been strong competition
from Sydney and now the ratio would
be maybe 50 per cent Melbourne, 40
per cent, or more, Sydney. Nobody is
sure. The Lane is still the capital and
the Lane is still unique in the country.
It is a community within a community,
and, just like New York's Garment
Centre, no other major manufacturing in-
dustry has so much of its design, pro-
duction, sale and distribution facilities
concentrated into so small an area. All
this helps the tension deriving from the
sheer lack of space, and the movements
of trucks trying to get in and out. Take
a walk down the Lane and it is easy
to see that everybody seems to know
everybody else. They either recognise
each other or deliberately don't recognise
each other. Did we mention traffic as
a cause of tension? Actually, it's not
so much that at all. The tension comes
from trying to nut out all the time
what your competitors are up to.
117 e were walking. On the left is the
Noshery, an eating house, Continen-
tal style, with piles of magazines on the
shelves for the customers. They are
all fashion and garment industry maga-
zines. Maybe in there you could dream
what is likely to happen in 1966. On
the right is Trevola Robes, where the
Trevaskis family built their big empire.
Tom was an Olympian and one of the
best amateur wrestlers this country ever
saw. He’s one of the success stories of
the Lane and he put his money into
The Oasis Figure Form Pty Ltd, right
there beside his office. It is the only
muscle house we know where the steam
baths have the scent of pine trees, where
the gym floor is covered with wall-to-
wall burgundy carpet.
We were walking. There are doors
everywhere and they always seem to
lead to dark stairs. Climb the stairs and
the tale will always be the same. There
will be a large room lit with fluorescent
tubes with maybe 20, maybe 50, maybe
100, girls all bent over their Singer
machines, rags all over the floor. There’ll
be cutting machines, button marking
gadgets, irons and ironing boards.
Did you ever see Peter Jones in “The
Rag Trade'', the TV series? It's no
different in the Lane. Many of the
factories have moved out into Colling-
wood, Carlton and Brunswick, but there
are many that have not, and it is still a
good idea to have a showroom in the
Lane.
As one walks one sees plenty of little
fellows in big overcoats and in deep
Continental conversation. For the im-
porter, indentor, it is a good idea to
keep walking, to be seen often and the
conversation is inevitably about the hard
times. There are two international say-
ings associated with the Rag Trade:
“Something is going wrong all the time”
and “There's nothing wrong with the Rag
Trade that a good order wouldn't fix”.
Like graziers, the rag men are magnifi-
cent grumblers.
The weather hardly ever is kind to
the trade. Sydney’s summer was too
wet for the selling of frocks. Winter

didn’t come at all to Melbourne last
The summer wasn’t hot enough
an d when winter did come it was too
ijate; then everybody was caught with
' t he virus which made them stay at home
’when they should have been buying their
Loollen outfits. Ghastly it was. Then,
l as if it were a clerical plot, Easter was
early this year. Easter to suit the rag
trade needs to be nice and late. Then
[people have to buy winter outfits before
\hey set out for their holidays.
As Tom Trevaskis says: “In the old
days it was simple. You sold cottons
in the summer and woollens in the
(winter. Now we’re selling ahead all
■the time. Right now we’re working on
: 1965 and 1966. Last April we had to
Iwork our show for October, ’65.”
1 This is what gives those big, sad eyes
|to the rag men. All the time they are
'trying to guess what women will be
(wearing two years from now; it’s the
great imponderable. It’s like trying to
guess the prices of Oil Search or BHP
shares, or more like trying to pick the
double for the Caulfield and Melbourne
Cups. Failure can be disastrous. If
flowered prints go out, if two-piece cos-
tumes take the place of single-piece, if
bosoms are out and bellies are in, then
maybe you are ruined. As Sel Baton of
■Notts Novelties put it: “You can buy too
late, or you can buy too early.”
As he said, it’s like snooker. It’s not
so much the balls you put in the pockets,
it’s the ones left on the table that get
you into trouble.
When travel was Important
Mobody is very sure exactly why the
Lane became the tight little island
it is. Some say it was because of the
shipping. The sailing ships used to come
right up the Yarra to Princes Bridge
and the warehouses in the Lane were
right handy to the wharves. Others say
it was simply a matter of convenience
for the department stores, because until
the super-power of Bourke Street got
under way the stores were all around.
In Flinders Street, for example, as well
as Ball and Welch there was Snows, the
Mutual Store and Civil Service Stores.
Round the corner in Elizabeth Street
there was the mighty Craig's, and Hicks
U P in Collins Street, when Hicks was
Hicks.
Sel Baton remembers that in those
da ys the important thing was to travel,
to do one’s buying in Europe. One would
go away for six months every year, two
months for travelling, three months for
Li y>ng and one month for play. And,
°f course, it was quite a thing for any-
°ne to be so adventurous as to go over-
seas. “When we returned,” he said, “the
rcss would be there to interview us
a out fashion trends in Europe. Natur-
a y the fashion trends we told them
about were exactly what we had bought.”
Mr E. G. Creed, of Bonham and
Creed, remembers that until the First
World War the Lane was dominated by
the big warehouses, like Paterson, Laing
and Bruce, Brooks McGlashen and
McHarg, Beath Shiess and Felstead,
Richard Allen and Co., and others. They
owned the Lane.
They also financed the majority of the
retailers, using them as tied houses, just
as the breweries dominate the hotels.
And to get taken in by one of these
places was considered a very fine thing
indeed for a young man; almost like
getting a cadetship with an oil company.
But the pay was tough.
Sel Baton went to work for Conabere,
Grieve and Conabere. Labor was cheap
and in the Lane they called the Cona-
bere building “The Lighthouse”. The
lights were always on with the staff
sweating back to 10 p.m. Sel Baton
says the pay in 1913 was £lO for the
first year, payable at 16s. Bd. a month,
£2O for the second year, £3O for the
third. For working back to 10 p.m.,
one received one shilling tea-money.
Mr Creed, who also went through this,
says it was possible to get a pretty good
meal in Melbourne for ninepence and if
you were crafty you could save three-
pence a day. But, he says, if you
think traffic is bad in the Lane now,
you should have seen it before the First
World War. For one thing it wasn't
one way, as now. The hiring of buggies
was dirt - cheap. Gartons in Lonsdale
Street would deliver your horse and
buggy to the door, complete with whip
and rug. The travellers would leave the
horse standing down there all day. So
there they were, lined up either side of
the Lane, all the way down. It could
take you half an hour to get from
Elizabeth Street to Swanston Street.
Being a country traveller was a grand
affair, rather like setting out on safari.
Say one was the Gippsland representa-
tive for a big warehouse. The standard
equipment would be 20 to 30 basket
hampers, almost the size of a desk.
They would be lined with waterproof
American cloth and they would contain
the complete range from men’s shirts,
hats and socks to women’s stockings and
haberdashery. These would be put on
the train.
And so the traveller would proceed
from town to town. He would stop per-
haps at Warragul. The 30 hampers
would stay at the railway siding and he
would set himself up at the local hotel.
In those days all the hotels had special
showrooms for the travellers, where
they could show their wares to the
buyers.
Everything would be done at a fine,
leisurely pace. The traveller would tell
the carrier to go to the station and
bring down hampers 13, 17 and 22. He


would know which hamper contained
what was best for Warragul, and so it
would go on.
Mr Creed said the motor car fixed all
that. Now a traveller is expected to
do the best part of Victoria in a week.
In fact the speed-up in communications
had created the crazy modern tempo in
the Lane. In 1922 one took six months
for the overseas tour. In 1964 one
went by Qantas and maybe took as little
as three weeks.
The downfall of the great warehouses
was the result of steady white-anting.
During the First World War, Australia
was forced to start manufacturing many
of its own clothes, the clothes which had
always come from Lancashire.
Age of the specialist
woollen mills started and Australia
was in the textile business. So the
whole thing gathered pace. There were
manufacturers who made shirts, stock-
ings, socks, frocks and all the time deal-
ing direct with the stores instead of the
warehouses. And more and more it
became the age of the specialist. Mr
Creed says we have reached the stage
where now there are specialists for every-
thing, for different textiles, for millinery,
for hosiery, for woollens, and there are
all sorts of indentors in the Lane who
concentrate on one particular line. In-
stead of maybe six infinitely respectable
massive warehouses, there are now four
or five big firms and hundreds of little
ones all buzzing and competing.
And one gathered that the mortality
rate was as high as in a beehive during
a heat-wave.
Another factor in all this was the
change in the fields of activity. Lanca-
shire no longer was a serious force and
had practically given up the ghost. He
said his firm had some trade with
the Continent, some trade with the US,
but the bulk of its textiles came from
Japan. Good stuff? we asked.
“It's all good,” he said. “People
won't take the second-rate. You can’t
even sell cheap stuff in Collingwood and
Footscray today.”
If the Lane has a titular head, then
it must be Mr J. M. Shaw, head of the
very large house of Leroy and president
of the Garment Industries Association.
It is often said that it is impossible to
measure or count anything in the rag
trade, it’s all too crazy. However, Mr
Jack Shaw has spent untold hours put-
ting cases for the industry before the
Tariff Board, and his piles of informa-
tion add up to tomes of Bible - length.
Most of them prove that growth of the
industry in recent years has been sadly
unimpressive.
The clothing industry in all its ramifi-
cations employs 91,351 persons and pays
£65,458,000 a year in salaries. After
the food and metal industries it is Aus-
tralia's biggest employer. In 1961-62
there were 4296 factories which em-
ployed 91,351 people with an output
worth £238,829,000.
Those figures are little different from
1957-58 except that the number of fac-
tories and the number of those employed
are less. Mr Shaw points out that be-
tween 1961-62 and 1962-63 the real
value of clothing sales rose less than
1 per cent at a time when the population
growth was 2 per cent.
In 1952-53, excluding motor vehicles,
clothing made up 18 per cent of retail
sales. By 1961-62 it had fallen to 15.3
per cent and it is still falling.
Jack Shaw explained with much sad-
ness that the trend to casual dressing was
the cause. People didn’t dress up any
more and they spent all their money
on motor cars, washing machines and
hire-purchase.
He blames their troubles on other
things, too, such as the lack of good
machinists and the prevalence of back-
yard manufacturers. He says that most
good machinists can earn £3O a
week and more with overtime. But
girls don't want to do the four
years’ training and they certainly
don’t want to work in a factory when
they can get a nice dainty job sitting be-
hind a typewriter with maybe plenty of
boys in the offing. He could produce no
figures on the prevalence of backyard
manufacturing, of the men in Colling-
wood, Brunswick and Fitzroy who had
factories in their backyards and used
sweated New Australian labor, but he
insisted it was prevalent.
Another good man to see in the Lane
is Douglas Cox. He sits in his office and
behind him are interminable racks of
Douglas Cox creations all ready for the
summer. Douglas Cox is a former city
councillor and he speaks at a speed
to make a Hansard writer quail. Like a
grasshopper, his energy comes in gigantic
bursts.
“Of course, there’s a fascination in
this business,” he says. “If there wasn’t
I wouldn’t be in it. But the rag trade’s
like the food business, everybody thinks
they can run a restaurant and every-
body thinks they can make a woman’s
frock, but they can’t. I tell you there’s
somebody going broke around here every
week. The pitfalls are tremendous.”
One noticed too, that Douglas Cox
was very good at the industry expres-
sions. He would talk about the piano-
players. These were those tiresome
buyers who never bought and only took
notes. Then there were the knockers-off
The knockers-off were the dangerous
fellows who stole designs. Although the
knocking-off could start in Paris and
work all the way down the line with
knockers-off of knockers-off of knockers-
off until the last tiny ripples washed out
on the last beach, say in some country
retail store, and by that time other vast
cascades of knocking-off would be in
motion.
Douglas Cox, like many others in
the Lane, talked of the might of the
department stores. There were good
department stores and bad department
stores, but in numbers they were be-
coming fewer and fewer and more im-
perious in their demands. They were
now buying closer and closer to hand.
That is, the manufacturer would have to
wait and wait and wait for his order.
Sometimes the order would come, only
to be cancelled; maybe it would never
come at all, or maybe it would come
with only a fortnight to get everything
ready.
So the manufacturer would go ahead)
anyway, but often as not he would get
caught with a whole range that wouldn't
sell. The summer season had
gone. So he had to unload for any
price he could get —£5 frocks went for
£2, cloth worth £1 a yard went for 10s,
or ss. a yard, and the department stores
made a nice killing for their January
sales. Sometimes the stores even went
around demanding such things for their
sales.
And that was another thing—the sea-
sons were getting earlier and earlier.
There was the crazy situation where it
was downright frigid in a Melbourne
August, but the stores were already full
of summer fashions. Summer ended on
December 31 in time for the January
sales and winter ended on June 3i in
time for the winter sales.
Tears of rage
“Vou see,” said Douglas Cox, “pretty
A darned soon we will jump a whole
season. I don’t see any sense in selling
winter coats in January when the tem-
perature is 100 degrees.”
There are three things which bring
absolute tears of rage up and down the
Lane. There is the store which u
slashing prices. Maybe it is all-powerful
or maybe it has been mismanaged and
it has to unload stock, but this can he
hard on the manufacturer. He sees h |S

The 1890 plantings at Coonawarra Estate of
Hermitage (Shiraz) vines have been supple-
mented over recent years with plantings of
the rare and exquisite Cabernet Sauvignon.
Thus two distinctive high-quality clarets are
available from the Estate. We particularly
recommend two of the recent vintages:
COONAWARRA ESTATE CLARET

“famous make” lines cut in price by
half, sometimes with even the name
mentioned in the ads. So when he tries
to continue in business selling his
“famous make” models at £lO, it is im-
possible to convince all others that they
are not available at £4.
Another good rage - provoker is co-
operative advertising and the garment
industry has been complaining about this
in Canberra. It has become more the
rule than the exception that big stores
demand that the manufacturers pay their
share of the advertising.
According to the Lane this can be
done in a crafty fashion. Say Murphy’s
Super Store wishes to put an ad. in the
morning daily for Italian goods. It
goes to 10 firms which are importing
these Italian lines and asks for £6O
each. Perhaps the page spread costs
more than £6OO or perhaps it doesn't.
According to the men in the Lane there
are times when the ad. costs only £4OO
and Murphy’s Super Store makes a pro-
fit of £2OO. Murphy’s in this case is a
fictitious name, but the Lane men are
only too anxious to supply the real titles.
They claim co-operative advertising is
unfair because their profit margins do
not cater for it. The only person we
spoke to who did not object to this was
Tom Trevaskis. But he insists that his
products must be there alone in the ad.,
and he insists on seeing a pull of the ad.
before it appears and a copy of the
account. But co-operative advertising
is becoming the thing in the Lane. Un-
less they agree to it they get no orders
—there are too few buyers and too many
manufacturers.
Pirating
there is much talk about graft,
about the buyer who, with much
subtlety, demands his personal five per
cent “to cover his costs” before he will
make an order. Yes, there was talk about
this, but when one tried to get down to
specific dates, amounts and places, there
was no talk at all.
There is also pirating, knocking-off
in the grand style. Say Extravaganza
Creations, to coin a name, have bought
an expensive array of spring styles worth
£l5 each, wholesale. The brigand
knocker-off has already copied all these
styles. He goes to the buyer and sug-
gests sweetly that he can give him the
same thing, just as good, for £lO each.
Douglas Cox, the founder of the Gar-
ment Industries Association, says that the
Association was formed to rid the trade
of such evils and he insists that they have
largely disappeared. Not everybody
agrees, but there’s no doubt that less of
it exists than five years ago.
Then there’s the problem of getting
paid. Douglas Cox says he wouldn't like
to guess at the amount of bad debts in
the Lane, but it must run into hundreds
of thousands of pounds. “Everybody
leans on everybody else, from the retailer
right back to the manufacturer and the
importer, and sometimes you have to
wait six months. There are a few stores
like Myers, who pay at once. If you
are anxious they will even pay the
next day, but there are precious few
Myers in this world.”
He quoted the case of one man who
built a fine reputation by paying well on
a few short orders, then he went through
with £60,000 in seven weeks’ trading.
Mr J. C. Pollack, a frock manufac-
turer, and an Olympic fencer of some
repute, can talk movingly about this. He
says: “We deliver goods at the end of
July dated to September 1 and the terms
are 2 per cent for 30 days, so the 30
days become 60 days. But often you
have to wait six months for payment. So
what do you do? You have to put a
debt collector in action and that's another
client you never see again.”
He says the law is very interesting.
A man could come into his showroom,
see a two-shilling piece on the counter,
and take it. He would be up for larcency
and he could even go to gaol. On the
other hand a man could come in with
a big order. He offers proof that he has
already done business with big firms like
Gala Gowns, Leroy and Douglas Cox, so
you have no doubt that he is a good
trader. He may buy £l5O worth of
frocks or he may buy a lot more. Half
a year goes by and you don’t get paid.
Eventually he goes to court, he is de-
clared insolvent and he settles for six-
pence or a shilling in the pound. Unless
it can be proved that there was criminal
negligence, he has done nothing wrong,
He is an honorable fellow, not like the
wicked character who stole two-bob,
Mr Pollack says this is not rare by any
means. The honorable fellow carries on.
Next week he opens another business
over the road, this time in his wife’s
name.
It would be no trouble at all to fill
a series of volumes the size of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica on the worries
of the rag trade. One really should have
mentioned television. Douglas Cox says:
“Wherever TV springs its ugly head you
can wish sales goodbye for 12 months.
It happened in Melbourne, it has hap-
pened in every country town.
T. C. Beirne’s in Brisbane fell to David
Jones because of TV. No sales. For
a year the customers all became viewers
and just sit in front of that darned thing
in slacks or dressing-gowns. Nobody
buys anything.”
Yet, as Douglas Cox says, the rag trade
does have a fascination. Always there
has been the belief that here was one
business where all you needed was a
small office, a girl and a typewriter. You
would do everything on indent, buy from
the smart houses of Europe on order, and
make yourself a fortune without ever
having to soil your hands with merchan-
dise. In the Lane they agree it is still
possible to do this, but you need a devil
of a lot of luck, and a devil of a lot of
know-how. You have to get up very
early in the morning to win, and there
are an awful lot of characters who get
up earlier.
It has been written of Seventh Avenue
and it is the same in the Lane—it has
to spin like a top to stay upright and
everybody who is part of the whirl has
to move quickly to keep his place in
what is the most competitive, uncertain,
easy-to-enter, low-capitalised, fashion-
orientated goddamn crazy industry there
is.
But as long as women continue to be
the same contrary creatures they are and
wardrobes become obsolete faster than
nuclear bombers, then there’s sure to
be business in the rag trade.


OVERSEAS
The Great Southern
Rhodesia Plot
Conspiring for independence?
From COLIN LEGUM in Salisbury
Few people in Southern Rhodesia
doubt that a coup to declare inde-
pendence is likely to be tried
between late October —by when the new
British Government should be known —-
and the end of the year.
The whole atmosphere in Southern
Rhodesia today is of
open conspiracy.
Rhodesians have
only one topic of
conversation: how
and when the Gov-
ernment will act in
making the country
independent.
Friends, families and
neighbors are lining
U P against one an-
other on whether
they will support or
oppose a coup.
The Prime Mini-
sfer, Mr lan Doug-
hs Smith, who has
now announced that
he would be going to
London this month,
Rumors persist that Southern
Rhodesia intends to amend its con-
stitution, declare itself independent of
Queen and Commonwealth and reach
a mutual security pact with South
Africa’s Prime Minister Verwoerd and
Portugal’s Salazar which will guaran-
tee that South Africa, Southern Rho-
desia and Portuguese Angola and
Mozambique form a solid white sup-
remacist bloc in southern Africa.
Southern Rhodesia denies the ru-
mors but with 1000 of its 200,000
Europeans emigrating each month few
people in the country doubt that there
will be a “coup” by the end of Octo-
ber . . .
has repeatedly said that he would not act
until all possibilities of negotiations had
been explored to the “bitter end”. But
at the same time he has ruled out all
prospects of a negotiated settlement by
indicating that he will not budge an
inch on the racial question of enlarging
the franchise of
Rhodesia’s three mil-
lion Africans.
In a country with
only 200,000 whites
—now dwindling at
the rate of about
1000 a month as a
result of unemploy-
ment and insecurity
there has always
been close neigh-
borly feeling, rein-
forced by sentiments
of loyalty to “The
Old Country”. For
many, Queen and
country are now two
separate with
the Queen belonging
to Britain, a country
which many feel is engaged in “selling
out the whites in Africa” for her own
interests. White Rhodesians argue that,
if they are to preserve their way
of life, they must cut themselves adrift
from Britain and form a close alliance
with Dr Verwoerd to the south and with
Dr Salazar’s Portuguese colonies to the
east and the west.
These views are held not just by the
man in the street. These are the views
of the earnest and honestly forthright
45-year-old Prime Minister and all his
closest advisers.' They cannot see a
future for the white community in
Rhodesia if power passes in the near
future into the hands of Africans. Their
choice is a simple one. Either get out
now or make a last stand with what they
believe to be some hope of success.
A key figure in the present situation
is Sir Humphrey Vicary Gibbs in his
dual roles as Governor and Commander-
in-Chief of Rhodesia’s forces. Sir Hum-
phrey, an Old Etonian, came to settle
in the country 35 years ago when he was
still a young man. Nobody is in any
doubt where he stands. He would
strongly uphold the Queen’s authority.
But would he order the Army to go
against the Government? And what
would happen if he did?
The Chief of General Staff is 51-year-
old Major-General John Anderson, a
South African-born soldier who served
with the Black Watch and the Royal
Dragoons. Anderson would certainly
stand with Gibbs against an unconstitu-
tional act.
Few question the loyalty of the Rho-
desian top Army and Air Force com-
manders, but would their orders be obey-
ed by the rank and file in a conflict with
the Prime Minister? The other day, in the
mess of the Rhodesian Light Infantry,
the Prime Minister was cheered and slap-
ped on the back by the few hundred
white Rhodesians who comprise this one-
third-strength battalion with encouraging
cries of “We are with you, Smithy”.
The professional Army consists of
only 3226 officers and men, of whom the
majority are Africans, whose support
would in any event be extremely doubt-
ful in a serious crisis. The Government
would have to rely largely on the police
force and on the civilian reserves.
The police, headed by Commissioner
F. Barfoot, would probably support a
break-away Government —especially the
white policemen who are under-staffed
and desperately overworked and embit-
tered by the frustrating task of coping
with the terrible internecine struggle be-
tween the two African political move-
ments.
But how reliable are the 55,000 terri-
torials and police reservists? Many of
the reservist officers are bitter opponents
of the Government. They quote Sir

Make the Hongkong Hilton
your base. It’s right in the heart
of the major business and
governmental section of the
Colony. In fact, a lot of business
is done in the hotel’s own
conference rooms, with
bilingual stenographers on
hand to help.
When you’re not working, you
have the Peak Tram at your
doorstep, the Kowloon Ferry
nearby. You’ll relax in the
hotel’s 80-foot outdoor

several superb restaurants.
Fifty of Hong Kong’s finest

HONGKONG HILTON
Robert Tredgold, the former Rhodesian
Chief Justice, who has said that in the
event of a unilateral declaration of inde-
pendence “it would be the plain duty
of every soldier, policeman or civilian to
do everything in his power to defeat
these actions, even by the use of force”.
The possibility of white Rhodesians
fighting each other is often mentioned
by prominent people in private conver-
sation, but the Government discounts it.
“I can tell you precisely what the atti-
tude of most Rhodesians is,” a senior
Minister told me. “They want us ‘to do
the job well and to leave no smell’. And
that’s precisely what we will do when we
act. There will be a lot of wild talk
for a time, at the United Nations and
elsewhere, but nobody can touch us and
in time the world will get used to the
idea of living with an independent
Southern Rhodesia.”
There is no doubt that at this moment
a majority of the white electorate does
support the Smith Government. The
bulk of this support comes from the
white artisans—former supporters of
Sir Roy Welensky who feel that an
African majority Government would
threaten their privileged position—and
the tobacco farmers who fear that their
seignorial way of life would be threat-
ened.
Ranged against them are what might
be described as the local Establishment
—the small but influential business com-
munity, many with ties overseas, the
Church hierarchy, the judiciary and pro-
fessional classes, and the Press.
Traditionally this group has dominated
all governments until the Rhodesian
Front won its surprising victory in 1962.
The Establishment, not altogether hap-
pily, now looks to Sir Roy Welensky to
try to prevent the grab for power. Sir
Roy knows that he cannot bring the
Government down in the next few
crucial months. The best he can hope
for is that the approaching series of by-
elections might show that the white
electorate is deeply divided, and that this
might deflect the Smith Government.
If the electorate were to come out
strongly enough it might even encour-
age the Governor to act before Mr
Smith. It is just possible that a second
plan is being worked up in private—to
scotch the Smith Government by the
methods they themselves propose.
The business community attaches great
importance to the forging of a second
deterrent. They would like the leaders
of the main British political parties—
and especially Mr Harold Wilson —to
spell out in precise terms their intention
to impose total economic sanctions
against Southern Rhodesia in the event
of a coup.
The business leaders feel that if the
voters know what they stand to lose
they will begin to drift away from Mr
Smith’s adventure. But the Ministers
I have talked to make it clear that no
amount of economic hardship would
deter them. “A price must be paid in
the early stages for our determination to
protect our rights as white men in Africa,
and we are willing to pay this price,” a
senior Minister told me.
The members of Mr Smith’s inner
caucus are an interesting assortment-
few of them really Rhodesians at all.
The most intransigent member—apart
from Mr Smith himself—is Mr William
Harper, who was born in Calcutta where
his family had lived for two centuries.
This 48-year-old former Battle of Britain
pilot, who has been in the country only
since 1949, is determined that what
happened in India, and subsequently else-
where in Africa, will not happen in
Southern Rhodesia.
Preparing for the coup
question remains: how does the
Government hope to bring off its
coup? From what has been said, it is
clear that when it decides to act it will
choose a Friday evening to get the
advantage of the weekend.
It is likely simply to announce that it
will amend the constitution in a few
essential respects —these being the few
major powers which have not yet been
transferred to Salisbury from Westmin-
ster. Such a declaration would not
necessitate any immediate radical
changes. It would then wait for re-
actions.
If these were strong, either locally or
from abroad, it would declare a state of
emergency, call out the reservists —or
those among them who are known to
be reliable —and put a curb on the Press.
The Governor would be isolated either
by placing him under house arrest or
by removing him to a place of detention.
If there were any attempt by the
senior Army officers to act against the
Government, they would be relieved of
their command and replaced by hand-
picked supporters. This could be done
quite easily if the Government could
really rely on the rank and file.
If there were any sign of local resist-
ance its leaders would be arrested. Half
a dozen detention camps for Africans
and Europeans are. in readiness in differ-
ent parts of the country.
Part of the confidence of the Smith
Government rests on the belief that once
the deed has been done the white elec-
torate will accept the act and rally to the
Government, and that, whatever their
present doubts, Dr Verwoerd and Dr
Salazar will give it such support as it
may need.
Nobody should imagine that the
Ministers are incapable of going through
with their plan. They believe they can
win, and they are ready to act. (ofNs)

No Room
for Neutrals
Soekarno and Sihanouk...
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH
in Singapore
The two central figures of the cele-
brations that marked Indonesia's
National Day in Djakarta once had
little positive in common, apart from
their trenchant oratory and large, lumi-
nous eyes. But today their solidarity
against those whom President Soekarno
calls “dogs, wolves and imperialists”,
and Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cam-
bodia calls “neo-colonialists and their
lackeys”, strikingly illustrates the process
of polarisation in South-East Asia that is
leaving no place for the neutralist.
Addressing an audience of about one
million people, Soekarno laid the blame
for the rapidly deteriorating relations be-
tween his country and the United States
squarely on Washington’s support for
Malaysia. “I am a friend of the Com-
munists because they are revolutionary
people,” he shouted defiantly, and added
that he hoped Communist North Korea
and North Vietnam would “soon liberate
South Korea and South Vietnam, for
the southern parts are not free yet”.
This almost paraphrased earlier re-
marks of his guest, the Cambodian Head
of State, who declared on his arrival
that only two nations in former French
Indo-China “had been able to safeguard
their independence and save their people
from imperialist and neo-colonialist
domination—Cambodia and Communist
North Vietnam'’.
The prince went on to outbid the
Russians—and even the Chinese, who
have paid lip-service to the principle—
by announcing simply: “Cambodia can-
not co-exist with the imperialists.”
Only 21 months have passed since
Sihanouk last visited Djakarta, and on
that occasion he told me: “Relations be-
tween Indonesia and Malaya are not my
business, and you can judge my attitude
from the fact that, having visited Indo-
nesia, I am now going to Malaya.”
His balanced outlook was typical of
a time when, in both Djakarta and
Phnom Penh, Washington's representa-
tives were fighting the growing influence
of Moscow and Peking with dollar aid
and technical assistance programmes,
and the tw ; o neutralist leaders of Indo-
nesia and Cambodia sat on their respec-
hve fences like veterans. In the short in-
tervening period Cambodia has rejected
further United States’ assistance and
Sihanouk has described Communist
China as his country's best friend.
Soekarno has cried “To hell with
American aid” and accused Washington
of trying to “separate” Indonesia from
China. This is America's pay-off for
spending 365 million dollars on Cambo-
dia, more than 700 million dollars on
Indonesia.
The two countries can ilEafford these
dramatic but costly gestures. By the
beginning of August, Sihanouk was warn-
ing his five million Khmers that unless
austerity were introduced to improve
the economy “we may expect to face a
catastrophe without precedent for our
regime and our independence'’.
In Indonesia, Soekarno has cancelled
all future imports of much-needed rice
(Djakarta normally has to buy well over
one million tons a year), and has told
his people to eat more maize and sweet
potatoes.
Neither Soekarno nor Sihanouk is a
Communist, although Soekarno is under
pressure from the 2,500,000-strong Indo-
nesian Communist Party. Both, in fact,
are anxious to postpone for as long as

possible the dark day when their coun-
tries go Communist, and their individu-
alistic variations of “socialism'’ are
abruptly ended. Nevertheless, Indonesia
has now severed relations with South
Vietnam and is exchanging ambassadors
with the Communist North.
Sihanouk has since protested that he
made no specific reference to Soekarno's
campaign to “crush Malaysia”. He never-
theless declared: “Indonesia's victory will
automatically be Cambodia’s victory.
Cambodia and Indonesia will become a
united front against imperialism and neo-
colonialism.”
Meanwhile Ceylon has chosen to for-
go American aid, and Burma is only
accepting token assistance. Western
newspaper correspondents, barred from
Cambodia, are normally only granted
24-hour transit visas to Rangoon.
No country in the Far East has been
formally lost to the Communists in the
past 10 years, but every “neutralist”
State has wriggled out of the dollar em-
brace and slid to the Left. It is fashion-
able to blame “internal contradictions”
between State Department and Pentagon
or President and Congress, or the erratic
machinations of the Central Intelligence
Agency, or the Ugly American, or the
coterie of unattractive Asian friends
whose autocratic rule Washington
finances because no one can find any
effective democratic movements to sup-
port in their countries.
China: The feared colossus
T>ut the Americans are themselves vic-
** tims of circumstances. The biggest
single factor that determines neutralist
policy is the backward nations’ fear of
the Chinese colossus. America is far
off, but Communist China is near and
vast. Neutral Asian leaders believe
China will ultimately overrun this sub-
continent, and they are busy buying time.
They welcome de Gaulle's proposal for
neutralising the area not because they
fail to see it as a stepping-stone to a
Communist South-East Asia but because
it promises peace—for a while —in a
sub-continent constantly sacrificed by
ideological guerrilla war. Friendship with
the USA is a dangerous liaison. Con-
versely, the Americans are safer enemies
than “700,000,000 Chinese”.
Nor is this all. Soekarno is driven to
“confront” anti-Communist Malaysia by
his ambition to cut an anti-colonial
figure in three under-developed conti-
nents, and by his dream of a third
“Indonesian” empire.
Sihanouk, on the other hand, has an
atavistic fear of his larger neighbors.
The Thais and the Vietnamese have
almost erased Cambodia from the map
in the past, and today their anti-Com-
munist regimes are both firmly backed
by the United States.
The Americans cannot be all things to
all men. To support Vietnam is to earn
suspicion in Cambodia, to sympathise
with Malaysia is to alienate Indonesia.
Soekarno does not soften if they are
polite in Indonesia, and Sihanouk is not
cowed if they talk tough in Cambodia.
And behind both is a claque of under-
developed States for whom the Western

capitalist must automatically be in the
wrong, and even Indonesia’s brazen
agression against a young Malaysian
federation one-tenth her size appears as
a crusade against neo-colonialism,
Washington’s sharp reprisal against
North Vietnam for the torpedo-boat
attack against ships of the Seventh
Fleet in the Gulf of Tonking has un-
doubtedly startled Communists and
neutralists who thought they or their
backers were safe behind their own
frontiers. These include the Viet Cong
in South Vietnam and the Pathet Lao in
Laos, who depend on tenuous routes
from North Vietnam for supplies and
specialist cadres, and the Indonesians
who launch terrorist attacks with im-
punity against Malaysian Sarawak and
Sabah, knowing that the RAF and
Anglo-Malaysian security forces will not
violate their borders in order to destroy

to set out to lay the Chinese bogy, to
prove by further measured military
action that China, not the United States,

Migration of
the Poor
Europe’s labor shift
By a Special Correspondent
About one million workers are now
migrating annually from the poorer
countries of southern and south-
eastern Europe to jobs created by short-
age of labor in the richer States of the
north-west. More than 2,500,000
foreign migrant workers mostly
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,. Greek,
Turkish and Yugoslavs are earning
their living, mostly in West Germany,
France, Switzerland, but also in Britain,
Belgium and the Netherlands.
The movement of foreign labor has
proved a powerful stimulant to economic
expansion and personal prosperity in non-
Communist Europe in the past five years.
It has helped both the receiving coun-
tries and the labor exporting countries by
relieving economic and political pressures
°f unemployment and low wages in these
States.

millions of pounds worth of foreign cur-
rencies. For instance, in Switzerland
Italian building workers, earning about
£lO a week, send home as much as two-
thirds of their wages. Italians in West
Germany are estimated to send home
more than £5O million a year.
The foreign migrants now working in
Western Europe parallel the movement
to Britain of 500,000 colored Common-
wealth citizens and 350,000 Irish workers.
Britain would be hard hit without this
labor force. The public transport system,
particularly in London, the hospital ser-
vices, and the building industry would
be in acute difficulties.
The International Catholic Migration
Committee said in a recent report that
up to 1963 the total number of migrant
workers in Europe tended to increase
each year, but last year there was a
slight decline. This was almost entirely
due to a fall in the number of Italian
emigrants.
But, in place of the Italians, more and
more Spaniards are heading north to find
better-paid jobs. In the six main receiv-
ing countries the proportion of Spanish
migrants rose from 19 per cent of the
total foreign labor force in 1961 to 24
per cent last year.
Spanish, Italian and Portuguese work-
ers tend to settle mainly in France and
Switzerland; Greek, Turkish and Yugo-
slav workers seem to prefer West Ger-
many. Yugoslavia is the only Communist
country which allows its subjects to work
abroad. West Germany, where the
native labor shortage is severe, has at-
tracted the greatest number of foreign
workers in the last few years about
900,000.
Italians easily form the largest foreign
group in West Germany over 300,000,
followed by 120,000 Spaniards, 110,000
Greeks, 60,000 Dutch, 55,000 Turks,
50,000 Austrians and about 45,000
Yugoslavs. But all told 80 countries
have provided workers for the Federal
Republic, including several thousand
North Africans from the former French
territories.
Swiss restrictions
nPHE country with the highest proportion
of foreign workers is Switzerland.
They number over 700,000 more
than a third of the entire working popu-
lation. More than 70 per cent are Italian,
followed by Spaniards, Germans, French
and Greeks. They are spread through
most branches of Swiss industry. Last
year the flow of foreigners seeking work
grew so great it reached almost
800,000 that it threatened to get out
of hand and the Swiss Government im-
posed restrictions to control entry as part
of its fight against inflation.
The Swiss trade unions pressed for
limitation, declaring they could not re-
strict wage demands unless the Govern-
ment cut down the number of foreign
workers and reduced the working week.
There is a shortage of accommodation
and much serious overcrowding in flats
and shanty-towns.
The third largest magnet for migrants
is France. Ten years ago there were
1,500,000 foreign residents, of whom
500,000 were wage earners. The num-
ber steadily increased. About 20 per
cent of migrants from southern Europe
some 200,000 seek a better life
in France each year, and in addition
there are an estimated 250,000 Algerians
working in the country. Thousands of
poverty-stricken Portuguese have been
entering France clandestinely across the
Pyrenees, and many now work in Paris
and other cities as waiters.
Generally speaking, however, the entry
of southern European migrants into the
prosperous countries of Western Europe
is well organised. Nearly all workers
require labor and residence permits.
Fears in the Common Market countries
that the Community’s policy of remov-
ing general restrictions on the free move-
ment of workers would result in .a flood
of “cheap labor” have not been justified.

WELL, GET OUT OE IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the

‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too

Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-

energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin

OUT AND ABOUT
Miss Karlin
On Her
Feet
Personal and financewise
By JAN SMITH
Reclining gracefully on a convert-
ible bed the jet age equivalent
of a chaise longue —and flanked
by two vases of handsome pink flowers,
Miss Karlin was quick to stress that Aus-
tralia, personal-financewise had not been
all that necessary.
But to Mr Eric Duckworth of the
Phillip Theatre, who has bagged Miss
Karlin to star in the Australian revue,
Is Australia Really Necessary? Miss
Karlin almost certainly was, if not
necessary, at least a major entrepreneu-
rial triumph. “Miriam will be here, with
luck, until mid-February,” said Mr
Duckworth, “and after that she'll be
going with the show to Melbourne and
maybe elsewhere.”
Mr Duckworth explained that the re-
vue was strictly national, as opposed to
local, and in fact would be so topical
that a large portion of it still remained
to be written. Miss Karlin, sold on the
idea when she learnt it was to be largely
the work of John MacKellar, whom shed
known in London, had even written a
small piece herself, very way out, about
what she called “this Sydney-Melbourne
thing - ’.
“It's not true at all to say a success in
Sydney is doomed in Melbourne,” said
Mr Duckworth smoothly, “but we will
probably alter the emphasis a little m
different cities.”

Miss Karlin, known to thousands of
Australian viewers from her appearances
with Peter Jones in The Rag Trade
comedy series, had been about to embark
on a one-woman show at Chichester,
and a play, Cages, at the Arts Theatre.
But she had never been to Australia. In
fact she’d never been out of England,
except for a miserable week in New York
some years ago.
“I was in a play called ‘Women of
Twilight’,” said Miss Karlin, “and I was
playing an unmarried mother. ' In fact
we all were. It had done quite well in
London but when we arrived in America
to go on Broadway the play was picketed
by the Scenic Artists’ Union because we
were usins an English set. So it was all
rather awful with lousy reviews, and
after a week we all went home.
“It was a good play,” said Miss Karlin
sadly, “but 10 years before its time.”
Her one-woman show, however, was
like.y to be a great success. “It's all new
material specially written for me,” Miss
Karlin said, “and it’s called ‘Miriam Kar-
lin On Her Feet’. Because, you see, I
have a whole row of different shoes
spread a’ong the stage like footlights,
to wear for each change of part. I can
never really get the feel of a character
unless I have the right shoes for it, you
know.”
This day Miss Karlin was wearing pale
1 blue satin scuffs with high heels and
feathers, and was obviously being an
actress. “I’ve been in television on and
off since 1947 and I’ve only just begun
to feel I’m scratching the surface,” she
said. “Only now can I really become
involved in a television role without
letting extraneous things like lights and
cameras upset me.” For this reason she
hates working in films, where the lack
of sequence hinders proper development
of character.
She seldom sees her films, which
include The Small World of Sammy Lee,
and The Bargee, with Harold Corbett,
and tries to forget them as soon as pos-
sible. Her one happy experience in film
was The Small World of Sammy Lee,
working with director Ken Hughes. “He
works just like in theatre,” Miss Karlin
said, “and before we started he got us
all together and kind of familiarised us
with each character. We horsed around
and really knew what we were doing
by the time it started.”
The trip to Australia, then, had been
a happy release. “All my friends,
especially the ones in films, get sent to the
most exotic places all the time,” said
Miss Karlin. “It’s just not fair. You
know the most exotic place I ever got
s ent on location? Morecombe. With Oli-
vier in The Entertainer.”
The Rag Trade, a television comedy
series by scriptwriters Chesney and
Wolfe, is now finished in England, but
Peter Jones, the harassed factory owner
Fenner, is keeping the image alive in
Australia where he is starring in Boeing
Boeing! and for most people he is Mr
Fenner, eternally bargaining, pleading
and conniving with Miss Karlin, who is
even more Paddy.
During the interview Mr Duckworth re-
layed good news an invitation to open
an orchid show.
“I only ever opened one garment fac-
tory,” she said. “It belonged to a very
distant relative I’d never heard of, and
after he’d explained all the relationship
it was arranged I should open the factory
they made leisure wear and get a
pair of slacks out of it.”
Miss Karlin is the daughter of a bar-
rister and the niece of a professor, and
assured us her parents had been wonder-
fully good to her, considering she was
the only one in the family to have gone
into the arts. Her first appearance, after
studying with RADA, was in 1943 in
The Family Upstairs, and in 1946 she
had her first London role as Lorene in
The Time Of Your Life. Major roles
have included Sadie Thompson, the stu-
dent’s mother in The World of Sholem
Aleichem, Mrs Daigle in The Bad Seed
and Mrs Van Daan in The Diary of Anne
Frank.
Miriam Karlin has never been mar-
ried. “I could have, of course, and been
divorced dozens of times, but I’m looking
for a man who’s aggressive yet sensitive,
and they’re hard to find. You know?”
Miss Karlin, a firm believer in Living
according to one’s tastes, finds rent and
taxes an incomprehensible problem, but
she has recently got over the former by
buying a house in St John's Wood, a
studio cottage with a north light, high
ceilings and split-levels, which she is
decorating herself:
Miss Karlin rose to a lunchless lunch
hour. “Look at these lovely flowers from
Peter Jones,” she said, indicating sprays
of the fleshiest pink gladdies since Barry
Flumphries. It was too late to go into
explanations, but Mr Jones’ gift seemed a
happy omen for Miss Karlin’s and
Mr Duckworth’s latest satirical ad-
venture.


Last of the Noble Art’s
Great Professors
177 professional fights and only stopped once
From JOHN RAFFERTY in Glasgow
Stanley Matthews we can under-
stand as he plays his football into
middle age, and others, too, such
as the jockey Scobie Breasley. Unless by
extreme mischance they are not going to
be hurt. With Sugar Ray Robinson it is
a bit different. He is 43 years old,
according to his passport, and yet in
Glasgow he prepares to box Mick Leahy,
the British middleweight champion. That
fight, along with others he plans, will be
highly combatant and almost certainly he
will be hurt, maybe irreparably damaged.
It seems an outrageous risk.
Behind him is all the glory that any
boxer could earn, welterweight cham-
pion of the world, five times middle-
weight champion, almost universally
acclaimed as the finest pound-for-pound
boxer ever.
Maybe he hunts dollars, but he says
emphatically that when he flirts danger-
ously in middle age it is not for money.
“I don’t want money for money’s sake.
I don’t want a nickel more than I need.”
Maybe, of course, he is not sure yet how
much he will need. He has earned
$4 million from boxing already.
He speaks with a friendliness and sim-
plicity which is startling in one who has
been 24 years in the boxing jungle. He
exudes such a dignified air of brotherly
love that it was a long time before a
somewhat case-hardened observer such
as this one could accept that it was not
an act.
He says simply, “I think I can win the
middleweight title for a sixth time. That
is my absolute belief, my sole reason for
continuing to box, and the moment I'm
convinced otherwise I’ll quit.” That
seems a far-fetched ambition but last
year he had 10 fights and only Joey Giar-
dello beat him and he is now middle-
weight champion. Stranger things than
the re-enthronement of Sugar Ray
Robinson have happened.
He is an interesting physical specimen.
Under a happy, mature face is a well-
preserved body propped on legs slim as
a chorus dancer’s and just as attractive
to watch when in motion. He says: “I
was blessed with this body and it’s my
duty to take care of it.” In so doing he
eats but two meals a day. “Most people
eat too much anyway, most take food
just for the taste of it. I only eat what
is needed to keep my body fit.”
Everything he does nowadays is func-
tional. He talks of how hard he trained
when he was young and excited about
boxing. Now his training is mature and
relaxed. There is much work for his
hands, a greater emphasis on callisthen-
ics. He says in explanation, “I don't
do so much now but the difference is
that now everything is done for a pur-
pose.” He admits frankly that his box-
ing, too, has been pruned of energy-
sapping action and that now he fights flat
out for but one minute of each round.
He recollects with a shudder . . . “when I
think of the energy I used to waste as
I raced round the ring.”
The training is now done willingly and
conscientiously but it is the only part of
the day he does not obviously enjoy. He
even seems happy sitting at the lunch
table as the rest of the party eats lustily
and he has nothing. Breakfast and din-
ner are his meals. When asked about
training he screws up his face and says,
“It's my work that’s it, work.” He
talks of the middleweight championship
but not of those he will have to fight on
the way to it. The simple explanation
is that he knows nothing about them
and he explains, “I’m a fighter but not
a fight fan —I never watch boxing.”
He is the last of the great professors
of the noble art, for he could not happen
again. No boxer now could have the
number of apprenticeship fights he had
when he was learning his trade. He had
200 fights as an amateur before he be-
came professional.
He had 74 fights before he fought for
the welterweight championship. Modern
boxers do not have as many in a life-
time. He makes the point: “There are
no small shows now and the kids are
starting at the top in the Gardens.
Another thing, very few are teaching
boxing good like when I was a kid.”
He admits the drop in world class and
says honestly: “If there was the same
opposition around as when I was starting
I would not have been able to box until
I was 43.”
Robinson has ploughed elegantly
through much hectic opposition, the
Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta; Tommy
Bell, from whom he took the welter
title; Randolph Turpin, who has long
since fallen by the wayside; Carl Olsen:
Rocky Graziano; Gene Fulmer; Carmen
Basilio. There have been 177 fights and
only Joey Maxim stopped him and that
was for the light-heavyweight champion-
ship on a night of such exceptional heat
that even the referee collapsed.
But now Robinson is 43 and happy
to meet people and talk to them. He
quickly explains the inconsistency that
he punches the noses of people he loves
by saying: “I don't like boxing.” And
he says of his social work that he would
like to extend it when he quits and
deplores the amount of wickedness that
is around. “I guess we just don't pray
enough,” he says, and his deep sense of
religion is the final surprise, (ofns)


Around Melbourne
NIGHT OF HIGH DRAMA
¥>udget night is a good news night,
but for the real night of nights
in Melbourne there is nothing to com-
pare with the Brownlow. Every year
on the Tuesday after the last of the
home matches the Brownlow Medal
winner for the VFL’s best and fairest
footballer is announced at Harrison
House. It calls for big coverage. The
newspapers inevitably put on four re-
porters and as many photographers.
At least five radio stations are at
Harrison House to cover it live.
Oh, it is very dramatic. After each
match through the season the umpires
put in their sealed envelopes with
their votes for the “Best and Fairest”.
On Brownlow Night these are opened
progressively, like the calling of
votes for the election of a President.
The Victorian listening audience
would be at least 95 per cent; and
the suspense, awful.
But the real battle over the years
has been between the TV stations.
The prestige, the honor, of being first
on the screen with the reigning
Brownlow Medallist just cannot be
overestimated.
The preparations for this are hell
for all concerned. Usually there are
five or six players in the running.
They may be at home, they may be
with their girl-friends or, even worse,
they may be 50 miles off, like at
Geelong. This means having re-
porters, photographers, and outside
broadcast vans all over the place,
waiting for the result. The best method
of making sure is to tie up all the
prospects, but this can be very ex-
pensive. It could cost anything up to
£4OO.
The real battle has been between
Tony Charlton of GTV-9 and Michael
Williamson of HSV-7. Williamson
has won for the past five years
straight. Tony Charlton, though, says
they haven’t been real wins. HSV
has stooped to taping interviews be-
fore the announcement. Mike Wil-
liamson says this has happened only
once. In 1962 it was just too obvious
that Alistair Lord of Geelong was
going to win the Brownlow. Then
he heard that GTV planned to take
an outside broadcast van all the way
to Geelong just for the big interview.
So they decided to tape beforehand.
Bob Davis, the Geelong coach, was
present, and Lord was marvellous. He
was animated and excited, just like a
man who had won football’s great
Oscar. So they decided to use it The
minute the Brownlow was announced
they rolled the tape. Then, 2?
minutes later, Tony Charlton had the
real interview on GTV. Viewers who
were switching from channel to
channel found it hard to believe that
one footballer could be in two places.
“But the funny part was,” says Mike
Williamson, “many people believed
ours was the dinkum interview. They
were calling me saying that Tony
Charlton had pulled a fast one by
swinging in Alistair’s twin brother
Stewart.”
T ast year he made another big
gamble. He decided that Bobby
Skilton, captain of South Melbourne,
would win the medal. He hid Skilton
at the new home of the South Mel-
bourne coach, Noel McMahen, and
he had the place all wired for radio.
All through the counting they listened
to the radio broadcast and Mike
Williamson sat on the arm of Skilton’s
chair, not letting him out of his sight.
This way he had an interview with
Skilton on 3DB 28 seconds after he
was announced the winner at Har-
rison House. The next move was to
get him 20 miles to HSV for the TV
interview. It was a frightening drive.
At Elsternwick Junction they went
round the wrong side of a tram only
to face a tram coming the other way,
and they ended up virtually on the
footpath.
There has been talk of villainous
practices between the two stations, of
sabotaging cars and so on, but this
is untrue. Mike Williamson says it
has happened only once. One year
he was chasing the winner and he
was being followed by the photo-
grapher who was to take the photo-
graph for the “Make Mine Milk” ad.
Some of the boys from the “Football
Inquest” decided to help out. They
noticed Williamson was being fol-
lowed by another car, clearly a GTV
rival, so in the best “Roaring
’Twenties” style they ran him off the
road. Later they announced their fine
achievement. “That’s champion,” said
Williamson. “He was only one of
us.”
This year it was reported that Tony
Charlton wanted a truce, with an end
to the Brownlow rat race. His feel-
ing was that all the prospects should
be present at Harrison House and the
interviews conducted in gentlemanly
style at the one time. But it wasn’t to
be. HSV tied up all six prospects,
gaining solemn promises from them
as to where they would be. The star
prospect was Ken Fraser, the Essen-
don centre half-forward. The big
batteries concentrated at this place.
As the voting progressed Mike
Williamson’s assistant, Alan Gale, the
ex-Fitzroy star, realised that Fraser
had no chance and Gordon Collis of
Carlton couldn’t lose. The arrange-
ment was that Collis would meet them
at Campbell Motors. But Collis,
embarrassed that he wouldn’t win, had
fled to a flat in South Yarra. However,
Alan Gale had faith, he waited a
terrible 30 minutes at Campbell
Motors until Collis turned up.
So Williamson finally put Collis on
HSV at 10.04 p.m. to be first in the
field again. Charlton was second on
GTV 41 minutes later. ATV-0 and
ABV-2 came nowhere.
But the man who won financially
was Collis. Winning the Brownlow
is like winning the British Open Golf;
from now on everything flows.
As mentioned earlier, there’s the
milk ad., and this is another of the
great battles of the season —the battle
in the space of an hour to get the
new medallist through for the country
editions. But, by heavens, it was
done, Next morning there was the full
page ad. depicting Mr Collis beaming
in triumph over a full glass of milk,
pointing out how right he was to have
trained on milk. As the ad. said, he
couldn’t have done it without his
“pinta”. Why, even Mike Williamson
drinks it.

The Expatriates
Notes on some Australians abroad
S. M. BRUCE, by M. H. Ellis:
Stanley Melbourne Bruce was
unique among Australian Prime
Ministers. He was the handsomest, the
politically least experienced, the most
naturally gifted, the youngest at under
40 (save J. C. Watson, who was 37 but
lasted only four months) and the most
unexpected.
Son of a Scottish immigrant who rose
from the bottom rung of the ladder to
become senior partner in a great soft-
goods indent firm, he was sent to Mel-
bourne Grammar School and Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, rowed in a winning
Cambridge boat against Oxford, returned
to Australia to become head of the
family firm and settle comfortably into
Melbourne life.
In 1914, in England when war broke
out, he dropped everything, joined the
Lancashire Fusiliers, fought on Gallipoli
and in France and came home with a
pair of crutches, two helpings of wounds,
some mentions in despatches, an M.C.
a Croix de Guerre avec Palmes. Some-
body who heard one of his recruiting
speeches persuaded him to stand for
selection for the Federal seat of Flinders,
a second habitat of Toorak denizens,
which fell vacant at a by-election when
Sir William (“Iceberg”) Irvine became
Victorian Chief Justice.
Bruce, professing “no political know-
ledge whatever and, although it sounds
like an exaggeration, not too clear exactly
what Parliament I was standing for”,
sat in the gutter outside the selection
centre smoking his pipe and expecting to
enjoy the spectacle of Sir Edward Mit-
chell, QC, the favorite, romp home be-
fore the selection committee. But Sir
Edward didn’t, and his backers Bruce
swore out of sheer revenge decided to
foist the democrat in the gutter outside
on to the electorate. He won the seat
after they had “vamped up some sort
of a speech for him to make”.
As Prime Minister, Bruce stood head
and shoulders too much head and
shoulders above his Ministers and a
Parliament, most of whose members
had been in it so long that they had a
common outlook, a common technique
and approach and a common idiom.
He was a discerning financier and was
one of the few men who saw the depres-
sion coming, but nobody would listen to
him in Australia till too late. In defeat,
he was cheerful (and I suspect thankful).
He cheerfully accepted honorary and
other ministerial offices under Lyons,
served magnificently as Australian Mini-
ster at the Ottawa Conference and in
London during the war was the first Aus-
tralian ex-Minister actually to sit in the
House of Lords, and has always kept his
personal links with Australia.
He might have returned to the Prime
Ministership, but repulsed the most
strenuous efforts by Page and others to
bring him back. And he has lived in
England, because he has been more
appreciated in Europe than in his native
country.
PETER FINCH
By Kenneth Slessor:
At various stages of his life Peter Finch
has been a Buddhist acolyte, an anti-
aircraft gunner and an evening-paper
copyboy. To my regret, I knew nothing
of him during these phases. Indeed, when
I first encountered him just before the
war, he seemed at first glance nothing
more than a rather superior kind of
beatnik (though that word had not
yet been invented).
It was in an old Mansions Hotel back
bedroom at the Cross, where at the in-
vitation of a newspaper friend I was
drinking whisky out of a cracked teacup.
Finch was there drinking whisky out of
a cracked peanut-butter jar. He was a
slim, sallow-faced youth, noticeably
well-mannered and pleasingly deferential
to his elders (who were supplying the.
whisky).
My host commanded him to recite
and he at once rose and delivered an
hilarious, Rabelaisian version of “The
Shooting of Dangerous Dan McGrew”.
His voice was magnificent, his eye wild-
ly expressive and his miming superb. I
was captivated, the more so when I
learned that he had written the parody
himself.
Before I had an opportunity of dis-
covering more about him the war
deranged our lives. After it was over,
I met him again in Sydney at the
Journalists’ Club and soon realised that
he had burning theatrical ambitions.
He was working passionately to establish
the Mercury Theatre, a sort of open-air
touring company of dedicated players
who strove to wean the masses from
Hollywood talkies by giving perfor-
mances of Shakespeare and
during lunch-hours at factories.
If the Mercury Theatre did nothing
else it served to catch the attention of
Laurence Olivier, then visiting Australia,
and he quickly realised Finch’s potential,
offered him a job and helped him to get
to England. Since then I have met Peter
Finch only once, when he returned
briefly to Australia, and that occasion
was so obstructed by cannelloni, Chianti
and adoring admirers that we had time
for only a few disjointed words.
But what I remember most about
Peter Finch is that he is not only a great
and gifted actor, he is also a first-rate
poet. At the Journalists’ Club he rather
nervously showed me some of his verse.
It was so charming that I at once insisted
on seizing a piece for the anthology of
Australian poetry which I was editing
that year (1945). Here is the first
stanza:
“Tell them in the old worlds
How we can love,
Not the greensward
Underfoot,
But the basalt boulder,
White quartz,
River stones,
Deep amber-crevassed clay —•
No Roman edifice,
No piles Baroque
Or Byzantine,
But the gutted woolshed
Leaning charred
Against the wind,
Rust-red and grey.”
The only thing better than reading
this would be to hear Peter Finch read-
ing it.
SUMNER LOCKE ELLIOTT
By Doris
Fitton:
TTigh up in an apartment in New
York's Manhattan, Sumner Locke
Elliott, now a successful novelist and
playwright, writes as he wishes, with no
economic worries. This is due to the
high place he has won in the literary
world today. Leaving Sydney for New
York in 1947, Sumner very soon secur-
ed work in writing for television, spe-
cifically for one of the three big networks
of America Philco. For this company
he wrote original television plays and
many adaptations, among them the tele-
vision version of “Peter Pan” for Mary
Martin and Cyril Ritchard.
During this time he wrote a modern
American comedy called “Buy Me Blue
Ribbons,” which was presented on Broad-
way. The story behind the staging, the
backers (a mother and son the latter
was star of the play), its short run, makes
more dramatic reading than most plays.
Since its New York opening “Buy Me
Blue Ribbons” has played continuously

in American summer stock companies,
earning the author a regular income.
After some years in New York Sumner
w as commissioned to visit Hollywood
and write a scenario on Hedda Hopper,
famous columnist and ex-actress. So
fascinating was Sumner’s sojourn and
experiences in Hollywood that, instead
of writing the scenario, he wrote a bril-
liant article on Hedda. This was sub-
mitted to Harper’s Magazine, a well-
known literary journal, not to be con-
fused with Harper’s fashion magazine.
The article so pleased the editorial staff
that he was commissioned to write a
novel.
After two years Sumner completed his
novel, “Careful, He Might Hear You”,
a story of his life as a child in Sydney
30 years ago. This story had been at the
back of his mind for some years, he told
me, and its success is now literary his-
tory. The book has run into several
editions and is being translated into sev-
eral languages. It won the Miles Franklin
Literary Award of 1963 for the best
novel written about Australia in that
year. It is a brilliant exposition of life
in Sydney in the twenties.
In 1944 Sumner, having joined the
army, was sent to Mataranka, in the
Northern Territory. It was there that
he wrote “Rusty Bugles”, considered by
many people the finest Australian play
yet written and undoubtedly the truest
picture of the character of the Australian
soldier.
By the time he was 20 he had written
six full-length comedies, all of w'hich
were presented first at the Independent
Theatre.
It is interesting to note that in spite
of his skill as a playwright, it was with
his first novel that he gained world-wide
recognition. Patrick White told me he
thought that “Careful, He Might Hear
You” was the most exciting and brilliant
novel he had yet read by an Aus-
tralian.
LOUDON SAINTHILL, by his brother,
Peter Sainthill:
Sainthill was a person I
think everyone will agree of im-
mense charm. He was diffident in man-
ner and hesitant in speech, with a
very mild temperament. But all this con-
cealed an iron determination in what-
ever he was doing.
As a worker, he was quite indefatig-
able, keeping at it all hours of the day
& nd night, and often going on until day-
bght. He was perpetually designing,
painting, and planning for the future.
During his last year in Sydney he had
an exhibition of painting in oils (a
medium he rarely used) and of gou-
aches. On top of this he was designing
for plays, as usual, and taking on com-
missions galore, including a big flower
show.
One annual event for him was to re-
decorate his flat in Edgecliff from top to
bottom. Everything would come out and
he would replace everything. He always
did the flat in Victorian style, but it
would be a completely different place
each time he did it.
He had a passion for the Victorian
style, combined with Greek and rococo.
He also decorated other people’s houses
and flats.
He always knew exactly what he
wanted. One year he made history at
David Jones by doing their windows in
an extremely ornate and surrealist style
so fantastic it stopped the traffic. It was
a very costly affair indeed.
He always wanted to go back to Lon-
don he had been there as a designer
for the Monte Carlo Ballet Russe in
1939 and, after a spell of service on
board the Wanganella hospital ship as
an orderly which he had wangled
he thought constantly about returning
there.
He finally did so in 1948. Since then
as well as his very successful career
as a stage designer he has branched
out into something he hadn’t done here;
in Edinburgh, he restored a hotel of the
Georgian period to its former glory. Now
he has done others in the same way.
JUDITH ANDERSON, by Robin Lovejoy,
Resident Producer at the tlizabetnan
Trust:
TL/B'y association with Judith Anderson
T”- 8 - was as stage director and assistant to
Hugh Hunt for the production of
“Medea”, in which she starred in Aus-
tralia in 1955. I found her the most
uncompromising and definite person. She
knew exactly what she wanted and de-
clared her intentions in no uncertain
terms.
There was a degree of ruthlessness in
her nature. She was lacking in suscepti-
bility to other people’s feelings. She more
or less boasted she had “used up” a lot
of producers. She dominated the whole
handling of the play. But I always felt
she had an innate respect for my abilities.
She never made me feel inadequate.
On one occasion I found it necessary
to discipline her. I shouted at her. She
reacted like a lamb. I was very sur-
prised. On another occasion I myself
was at fault. A pillar on the stage had
been insufficiently secured. She lent on
it and fell over with it. I went to her
dressing-room and apologised with hang-
ing head. To my amazement —again—
she treated it as a joke. “Well, what
about that!” she cried.
Of course, when she appeared she saw
to it there was no other actor on the
stage. She would make more and more
demands about the degree of luminosity
in the lighting of her and so on. She
is an actress who belongs to the large,
pyrotechnic grande dame variety—-off
stage she is highly amusing. She has an
hilarious ability to see through the pom-
posity of others. It’s a slightly bitter
humor, though. Not a warm or humani-
tarian thing. Cynical, definitely.
ROBERT CLOSE
By William Hareourt:
“T never want to go north of Circular
Quay.” These were the words of
Robert S. Close in the Newcastle Hotel,
Sydney, many years ago. Bob went north.
But not before he had written a “dirty”
book (“Love Me, Sailor”), been sent to
gaol for obscene libel and acquired
illusions about becoming a great writer;
and disillusions about being an Aus-
tralian. I last saw him in a little Italian
town, north of Turin. It had been a
long, hard winter. Bob spoke no Italian
and the Italians spoke no English.
While not loved, as another English-
speaking eccentric, he was tolerated with
some affection. Bob was a big spender.
This also helped. When he had money
in his pocket he spread it around freely.
Nor did he kick dogs. As he strolled
through the square, mongrels wagged
their tails, but women moved away. One
Italian habit Bob had adopted. As a
bottom-pincher he outdid the most skilled
Sicilian.
He had just completed a Hitchcock-
style film script, based on the ‘Pyjama
Girl’ case. “Yer see, the cop falls in
love with the body. The first shot shows
him reading a newspaper to the ‘Pyjama
Girl’, preserved in a bath of formalin.”
Saturday night would see Bob in the
town’s main bar standing bottles of wine
for the priest, his bitter enemy, the
mayor, his ally, and the proprietor, his
mate. Sooner or later, in sign language
and bad French, he would harangue his
sympathetic, uncomprehending audience
on the Catholic dominance of Australia;
its bigotry, corruption and political in-
stability.
Bob would return to his white-washed
cottage, nestling beneath the huge Gothic
church, in the early hours of the morning.
At 7.00 a.m. every Sunday his aching
eyelids were slammed open by clanging
bells calling the faithful to Mass.
Bob discovered that the town was flat-
teringly described as a city in the pro-
vincial records. In Italian cities church
bells are not permitted to ring before
8.00 a.m. Bob appealed to the mayor, a
Socialist, who took it up with the local
Deputy, a Communist. When I left Italy
Bob looked like being the centre of a
cause celebre again. Perhaps he may be-
come disillusioned and emigrate to Aus-
tralia.


DIXIE DIARY
Behind the
Magnolia Curtain
“You have your kangaroos and we have our Freedom Riders
By PETER COLEMAN
( Recently returned from a tour of the United States)
When you arrive at the airport in
Jackson, Mississippi, you may
as well Dial for Truth at the
nearest phone. A brisk mid-Western
voice, like a soft-drink salesman’s,
answers: “This is Dial for Truth, the
24-hours-a-day service of the Jackson
Citizens’ Council with important infor-
mation for white residents. The number
one Nigra (Martin Luther King) has
turned up in Jackson and he says he is
sick and tired of hearing about Commu-
nists directing the civil rights agitation.
However, get this: a character named
Bayard Rustin has turned up with him.
This Nigra is a former member of the
Young Communist League, served 28
months in prison as a draft-dodger
during World War 11, and was convicted
in California on a disgusting morals
charge . . etc., etc. It seemed as if
Martin Luther King’s big meeting the
next night (for the Mississippi Summer
Project’s Negro registration drive) would
be a dirty one.
Driving into Jackson, you can scan the
local papers for any information about
the Summer Project or of the murder of
three Summer Project workers in Phila-
delphia, which fill papers across the rest
of America, but you will be lucky to
find more than a few sentences about
the invasion of “smelly, bearded beat-
niks” from the North. There will cer-
tainly be no reference to the allegations
on the daily Incident Sheet published
by the Summer Project. For example:
“Canton . Civil Rights car hit by bullet”.
“Clinton . Church of Holy Ghost arson”.
“Jackson . Car circles office with gun,
threatens teenager: ‘Want to shoot
some pool, nigger’
“Philadelphia . Newsman’s car deliber-
ately rammed by local citizen. News-
man gets two tickets”.
“Moss Point. Negro woman shot twice
at voter rally singing ‘We shall Over-
come’ ”.
“Clarksdale . Negro volunteer chased out
of laundromat, taken to jail and
beaten. Sheriff: ‘You’re a nigger and
you’re going to stay a nigger’ ”,
And so on—allegations of every form
of harassment from parking charges to
murder.
At the hotel the clerk says: “From
Australia, eh? Well, I guess you’ve got
your kangaroos and we’ve got our Free-
dom Riders. But the Freedom Riders
will be gone by the end of summer and
everything will be back to normal.”
The city of Jackson, deep in the heart
of Dixie and named in honor of the great
Democrat Andrew Jackson, does not
appear in the standard guide books. A
small city, it was razed by Sherman in
what even Southern liberals still call
“The War”, and 60 years ago its popu-
lation had only recovered to 7000,
Today it has about 150,000. Memphis
in Tennessee and New Orleans in
Louisiana were, and still are, the real
capitals of the State and, although there
are “Welcome to the Magnolia State”
signs everywhere and the State Govern-
ment is chasing, and getting, Northern
investment, the main “tourists” are likely
to be civil-righters, working on their
vacations or looking at the monuments
of their cause. They can see the local
park or swimming pool that, after deseg-
regation, were closed down rather than
admit Negroes. There is the Robert
E. Lee hotel that, after desegregation,
closed down. There is the 5 and 10 cent
store which used to have a coffee bar
with 60 seats, which after desegregation,
removed all the seats and closed the
bar at, presumably, heavy loss to the
owner. There is the Sun and Sand Motel
used by the Summer Project now
known as the Sun, Sand, Sin and Sub-
version Motel. There is the restaurant
where the waitresses burst into tears and
broke down at having to serve a Negro,
There are shops selling “Kennedy Half
Dollars for 25 cents, which is all
they’re worth”, and cars with stickers:
“Drive carefully, you are in FBI-occu-
pied Mississippi”. There are the scenes of
various arrests of integrationist clergy-
men, of various ambushes, of various
bashings.
Museum of defeat
T>ut, for the tourist, dominating every-
** thing is the segregationists’ temple—
the Old Capitol, a museum of blood and
defeat that enshrines Mississippi’s brief
history. Different rooms are devoted to
the leading chapters—the early wars
against the Indians (including the
French Army’s extermination of the
Natchez tribe), against the French and
the Spanish; the arrival of English and
Northern Irish settlers from the Eastern
States —Mississippi is one of the most
Anglo-Saxon-conscious regions in the
world; Secession; the War, defeat after
defeat; the collapse of the economy;
Reconstruction; Negro political do® 1-


nance; the emergence of Mississippi’s
Closed Society with segregationism as the
official creed of citizenry, Church and
Press. The local heroes and native sons
are honored, from Jefferson Davis to
Carson McCullers and William Faulkner
the Faulkner of: “If it came to fight-
ing I’d fight for Mississippi against the
United States even if it meant going out
into the street and shooting Negroes”,
not the Faulkner of the “inevitable
changes” which Southerners might have
accepted “with dignity and goodwill”.
It would be a sad museum, if it were
not so heartless about what it leaves out.
Mississippi’s is a short history. It is only
about as old as New South Wales and
was largely colonised in the early 19th
century by the same sort of white Pro-
testant settlers (there are hardly any
Catholics in Mississippi—less than two
per cent, though they are among the
most progressive, if ineffectual, citizens),
but it took its special path when it in-
vested heavily in slavery, for which it
has paid a price ever since not only in
war and defeat, but in inhumanity.
There is little reference in the Old
Capitol to the hideousness of slavery
(“Buck nigger for sale. Good breeder”)
and none to lynchings and race war —
and certainly none to the widesp ead
miscegenation.
White Mississippi prefers to see itself
as having no real race problem at all.
It wishes hypocritically the Negroes were
not there. (“Is it true what I hear tell
that in Australia you keep the Nigras
in the desert? Ho, ho, ho”.) But since
they are there, keep them under, so that
the whites may be a virtuous, industri-
ous, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, patriotic,
law-abiding flower of the Old South —
although it is neither old nor really
Southern, rather a mixture of the South
and the Wild West, with often the worst
of both. Above all, they are determined
to minimise the Negro vote by any
means—because with votes the Negro
42 per cent of the State’s 2,000,000
people would take over politically. To
prevent this they will use every local
law or law-evasion technique and toler-
ate intimidation, even murder. It is
not merely a matter of ideology; they
believe they would rather be dead than
integrated.
“Whites only”
Qn the political level, the propaganda is
conducted mainly by one Govern-
ment organisation—the State Sovereignty
Commission, and one private organisa-
tion, the Citizens’ Council. The State
Sovereignty Commission has offices in
the State Capitol—a classic Southern
P'le dominated inside by a statue of
Governor Bilbo (“If the blood of our
white race should become corrupted
with the blood of Africa, then the pre-
sent greatness of the United States of
America would be destroyed”) and re-
markable for a canteen and a lavatory
marked “Whites Only”. The staff, like
most Mississippians, is co-operative and
hospitable (“Have some coffee. Cole-
man? Now that's a fine Mississippi
name. Have you met Governor Cole-
man? Tell us about the niggers in White
Australia”), but run with the parsimo-
niousness of a typical Government office.
It sends speakers across America to
preach the value of segregation for the
South, if not for other places.
The Citizens’ Council is unique.
Launched ten years ago by W. J. Sim-
mons, of Jackson, it is now spreading
across America on the principle of
“Scratch a Northerner and you find a
Southerner”. Its image is compara-
tively intellectual and with-it. Anxious,
officially, to free segregationism from
the Ku - Klux - Klan and anti - Semitic
taints (it has a Rabbi on its board), it
stands on “philosophic” grounds, but
keeps dossiers on the race views of all
Jackson citizens, influences politicians,

A Mississippi Negro, after working
all his life for civil rights, decided
he had had enough and migrated to
New York. Some months later the
Lord appeared to him and said: “My
son, l want you to return to Missis-
sippi and continue the good work.”
The Negro was shocked and replied:
‘‘No, Lord. Anywhere, but not Mis-
sissippi.” But the Lord said: ‘‘Yes,
my son, you must return to Missis-
sippi, and work.” After a pause, the
Negro said: ‘‘Well, Lord, I'll go if
You come with me.” After a longer
pause, the Lord replied: ‘‘l tell you
what, my son, I’ll come as far as
Memphis, Tennessee.”
far and away the dominant non-party
machine in the State. No doubt it is as
heavily infiltrated by the FBI as is the
Ku-Klux-Klan, but this can only help
the FBI check on possible lawlessness
and in no way inhibits its propaganda.
Simmons has the reputation, along with
Governor Wallace of Alabama, of being
one of the brainiest of the segregation-
ists.
The school books this Citizens' Council
recommends has passages such as: “The
white man has always been kind to the
Negro. Negro people like to live by
themselves. Negroes use their own
bathrooms. The Negro has his own part
of town to live in. This is called our
Southern Way of Life. Do you know
that some people want the Negroes to
live with the white people? These
people want us to be unhappy. God
has made us different. And God knows
best”.
From family, school and Church on-
wards the Mississippi child is nurtured
in segregationism, of which this is a
comparatively moderate sample, and
when a sheriff fails an educated Negro
in the voter registration (literacy and
constitutional knowledge) test, and passes
an illiterate, white bum, it seems no
injustice, only God’s will. Mississippians
believe this as fervently as they believe in
Jesus Christ, the Anglo-Saxon heritage
and the greatness of America.
Intruders in “Paradise”
Tnto this “paradise” came COFO—the
A Conference of Federated Organi-
sations—in what has been probably the
most dramatic expression of the civil
rights movement and the Negro Revo-
lution. The Federated Organisations
include the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
(NAACP), the Students’ Non-violent Co-
ordinating Committee (SNCC), the Con-
gress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the
Southern Christian Leadership Confer-
ence. It rallied and trained hundreds
of volunteers to spend the summer in
Mississippi encouraging Negro voting
and militancy.
Predominately young in its member-
ship—as are the lawyers, doctors and
newsmen supporting them —COFO's first
big problem was to screen out the three
groups that undermine the civil rights
movement—the punks, the Communists,
and the beats. The punks and junkies
who figured so largely in the New York
riots, and who have no interest in civil
rights but a keen interest in looting, are
no real problem for the screeners. Nor
are the Communists so far —and they
are not likely to become one while the
Negroes produce the high quality leader-
ship they are now producing—but they
are concentrating on the Negro revolu-
tion and their posters linking civil rights
with demands for US withdrawal from
Berlin and South-East Asia turn up
among the Freedom Now posters in
many demonstrations. (The Black
Nationalists and Black Muslims who
want a separate Negro State are heavily
publicised in the Communist Press, are
also no problem for COFO screeners,
since they scorn such movements as the
Mississippi Summer Project.)
The beats, however, are a special
problem. Up to a point the Negro revo-
lution. that began with the Freedom Bus
Rides in the mid-19505, sprang out of a
beat spirit-—the Kerouac “Oh the Road"
determination to do something crazy
that everyone thought impossible, like
setting out for California with no money
and three gallons of gas or desegregating

The early success made it a band-
wagon, and now all sorts of phonies
and literary demagogues, working the
Protest Bit, are on to it. By scream-
ing “Segregation is Wrong”, 3000 times
an hour, as if they were saying some-
thing no one had thought of before, and
if possible making it a folk song, they
are really in business —show business.
Working the Bit (“Protest, baby, swing”)
they find that licking the same ice-cream
cone with a Negro in the streets of
Jackson is almost as big a kick as the
Slashed Wrists Bit back in the Village.
This sort of beat has little to offer,
but a few slipped through the COFO
screen and made it no easier to get voters
registered in Mississippi. The credit for
the screening here goes largely to the
National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People—an organisa-
tion which is often popularly dismissed
as having lost the initiative to more mili-
tant groups like Students Non-violent
Co-ordinating Committee (SNCC) or the
Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) —
both of which in fact are almost
insignificant in comparison. The
NAACP has the prestige (the vast
majority of Negroes have never heard
of CORE or SNCC; they all look to
the NAACP), the numbers, the money,
the lawyers—and both the militancy
and a keen awareness of how to win
their campaigns. Under its influence
the COFO programme went ahead with-
out the handicaps that would otherwise
have ruined it.
“De Lawd”
HPhe NAACP has, however, one short-
coming. It has no Great Man. He
belongs to his own organisation—the
Southern Christian Leadership Council—
and is Dr Martin Luther King. Some-
times criticised as a hit-and-run dealer
who orates and moves on leaving the
trouble behind him (the liberal New
York journalists who follow him around
sometimes call him, for the same reason,
“the boss nigger” or “de Lawd”), he
has far and away the most loyal
ing among Negroes up and down Ame-
rica. His coming to Jackson to boost
the Summer Project and help launch the
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party
(which last week failed to get seated at
the Democratic Convention^in Atlantic
City) was a great event in Mississippi
history.
The hot and stuffy Jackson Masonic
Hall was crowded out with about 3000
Negroes from miles around, long before
he arrived. A choir of children with
Medgar Evers sweat-shirts (Medgar
Evers was the assassinated NAACP
leader in Mississippi) sang freedom
songs until Martin Luther King, Bayard
Rustin (the organiser of the March on
Washington), the Rev. Ralph Abernethy,
and various SNCC, CORE and Freedom
Party leaders filled out the platform—
as usual with civil rights meetings,
nearly an hour late. King was the last
to speak, and while the northern SNCC
and CORE leaders and Bayard Rustin
(“When you take over Mississippi . . .”)
preached with what seemed to me a
rather icy contempt for the audience’s
“apathy”, it was King and Abernethy
they wanted to hear, and Abernethy who
stole the show for the Freedom Party.
He spoke with gusto, interspersing his
speech with the question: “How am I
doin’ tonight?” and the audience cheered
back madly.
Abernethy’s job was to work them up
and raise money: “The children of Israel
had to leave Egypt, but we tell the
Pharaohs of Mississippi: ‘We ain’t goiri
nowhere’. We’re going to stay and fight
like hell (cheers), despite the Uncle
Toms and Nervous Nellies. Look, there s
an Uncle Tom up there in the balcony!

look.) And there’s even one or two on
this platform” (hysteria). “We were
here before the Mayflower, and if any
of you want to go to Africa you can buy
your own ticket, ’cos we ain’t goin’
nowhere” (cheers). Then in a different
mood: “They say we stink. Well, I met
a white man in Georgia the other day,
and I had to hold my nose (laughter).
But that's his right. And it’s my right.
If we want to stink, we're going to stink,
and they better get their air fresheners,
because we’re on our way!” (cheers).
Then seriously: “But we’re gonna try and
take a bath as often as we can!” (cheers).
Meanwhile he was raising nearly
$2OO0 —from a poor audience—for the
Freedom Party.
The audience was getting impatient for
Martin Luther King. “Mr Pressman,
there are no riots in the South like in
Harlem. Do you know why? (pause).
Because of Martin Luther King! (tre-
mendous applause). Did you get that,
Mr Pressman? And who paid your
fare, Mr Pressman? Because nobody
paid our fares” (cheers).
Finally, Martin Luther King, in his
deep, rich, slow tones/handed down his
message: “You’ve got to desegregate your
■minds because, if all segregation vanished
tomorrow, in 20 years from now some-
Negroes would still go to the back of
the bus” (cheers). “To be free, you
have to believe, as the old slave preacher
said: ‘You ain't no nigger. You ain't no
slave. You're all God's children’.” . . .
“Remember Medgar Evers is not dead”
(cheers) and “if you have the faith of
a mustard seed, we shall overcome!
Above all, keep the faith!” (tumult).
At the end, after singing “We shall
overcome”, hundreds rushed to join the
Freedom Party and the meeting broke
up peacefully, without incident, without
the suggestion of violence.
Setting the clock back?
VTow, the Summer Project—one of the
great symbols of the Negro revo-
lution—is nearly over. Has it succeeded?
In one sense, obviously not. It has cer-
tainly recruited few voters; out of
Mississippi’s one million Negroes, only
about 23,000 are registered to vote and
the Summer Project added only a hand-
ful. It has, however, focused national
attention on Mississippi and the work
will obviously be carried on through the
winter by others. But was it worth it?
Many liberals (in the good, and not the
scornful sense) doubt it. They argue like
this: the Summer Project workers showed
the sort of idealism and heroism that
niakes one turn to the Budapest students
who threw themselves at Russian tanks
ln 1956 for a comparison. But the
Hungarians knew they were defeated and
chose death rather than slavery. Missis-
sippi is not a totalitarian State. There
are powerful forces working for accep-
tance of the Civil Rights Bill—from the
Jackson Chamber of Commerce to the
Mayor and various voluntary groups.
Mississippians are also proudly American
and are beginning to recognise the new
American mood. But the Summer Pro-
ject has stiffened Mississippi conserva-
tism; the “invaders” were so obviously
contemptuous of everything Mississip-
pi that, out of sheer self-defence, the
people grew more bitter to civil rights
than they would otherwise have been.
The Summer Project, on this view, has
set the clock back.
Further, the liberal critics say, the
Summer Project only suits those radicals
who are not concerned with steady pro-
gress but yearn for dramatic confronta-
tions and consider anything less than a
Federal occupancy of Mississippi and a
ruthless Federal reconstruction of the
State as a failure. For those who do
want steady progress and see it happen-
ing all over the South, including Missis-
sippi, where schools; restaurants and
hotels are being slowly integrated, this
sort of dramatisation is lunacy. The
effort, courage and idealism invested in
Mississippi would have led to much
greater results if it had been spent in,
say, Georgia—with the additional long-
term aim of isolating Mississippi and
making appeals to its Americanist con-
formity more powerful.
But the most serious criticism of all
is that the Summer Project misdirects the
Negro revolution completely. The basic
Negro problem in America, on this view,
is not lack of rights, which are estab-
lished in the North and are coming in
the South. It is lack of education. There
are universities, schools and big cor-
porations in America desperately looking
for qualified Negroes to give scholarships
and jobs to, but they cannot find them.
Negroes are not yet taking full advan-
tage of the undramatic educational
opportunities available. One aspect of
this is the lack of a commercial class

among Negroes around whom educated
and professional Negroes could gather,
as has happened with all other minority
groups which have advanced in this way.
But, as of now, the Negroes lack the
commercial ethic. They could, in
theory, own almost every business, big
and small, in Harlem, but they do not.
There are obvious historical explana-
tions for this commercial apathy among
Negroes, but the real progress will come
with gradual educational and commercial
progress. This will take two or three
generations, and there is no scope for
dramatics in it. It is as if, realising this,
civil rights workers turn South for kicks
and dramatics instead of pushing ahead
with the long, slow, educational haul.
This, it must be admitted, is a strong
line of argument. But it sounds better
than it is, quite apart from the fact that,
even if it were sound, it would make
little difference since in any case there
will be more Summer Projects and
possibly more race war before Missis-
sippians abandon their moral secession
from the United States. To be confident
that Mississippi will grant justice to
Negroes of its own free will, as William
Faulkner wished, one needs more than
a resolution from the Chamber of Com-
merce and some token school integration
in Biloxi. The forces of full-necked
segregationism are so powerful, the
public hatred of civil rights so deep, and
the emigration of Faulkner-type liberal
Mississippi patriots so great, that with the
best will in the world one cannot see
progress coming to Mississippi without
intense, unceasing outside pressure—not
only from the Summer Projects but from
the US Government and the FBI. This
is the State where the Philadelphia mur-
ders are considered barely worth men-
tioning in the local Press, where inte-
grationist clergymen are arrested at their
churches for “disturbing the peace”,
where the Governor of the State publicly
describes the NAACP as “Niggers, Apes,
Alligators, Coons and Polecats”, where
the University of Oxford could not ac-
cept one Negro student without thou-
sands of US soldiers to protect him. It
takes more than a Chamber of Com-
merce to change all that.
The tragedy of Mississippi is that out-
side pressure now will lead to greater
race violence, and postponement of the
pressure will make it even worse in the
long run. This is the price you pay for
slavery and for the segregationist outlook
in which the remark “Call me anything
but don't call me a moderate” is not a
wisecrack but is meant in deadly earnest.


REVIEWS
FILMS
A Fable for Sophisticates
The versatility of George Pal
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Seven Faces Of Dr Lao. Director,
George Pal. St. James Theatre,
Sydney.
The Patsy. Director, Jerry Lewis.
Prince Edward Theatre, Sydney.
,Tt‘s difficult to imagine why anyone
should think of “The Seven Faces
Of Dr Lao" (put on in Sydney by
M-G-M for the school holidays) as a
film for children. It’s a fable for adults,
based on a remarkable novel by Charles
G. Finney, which has a cult following
in America.
A synopsis hardly does justice to this
odd, allusive film. Dr Lao is a fantastic
Chinese who arrives on mule-back in a
little Western town apparently carrying
no luggage but a fish in a glass bowl.
Somehow he conjures up a circus in a
brightly colored tent, where he himself
entertains in various guises. The towns-
folk come to be amused, but Dr Lao’s
purpose is to hold up a mirror in which
they are forced to see their true selves.
He leaves everyone shaken up, but gener-
ally grateful for his visit.
Disguised as Pan he forces a prim
young widow to accept the joy of love;
as Medusa he teaches a salutary lesson
to a nagging wife; as the seer Apollonius
he shows a vain, foolish, old woman the
emptiness of her present and her future
(this scene between Tony Randall and
Lee Patrick is most effective).
George Pal directs this sophisticated,
literate fable with humor and subtlety,
proving again how much more he is
than a technical expert. Beginning his
career in Europe with animated puppet
films, Pal, since going to Hollywood, has
won four Oscars for special effects
(“Destination Moon”, “When Worlds
Collide”, “War Of The Worlds” and
“Tom Thumb”). But his films have
always a more satisfying content than
just clever photography.
Iti “Dr Lao”, Pal has obviously had
fun with the dazzling technical tricks,
hut they are only decorations on the
main theme. Tony Randall, also, enjoys
Ihe technical challenge of his seven
incarnations and gives considerable
depth of understanding to each charac-
terisation. It’s a pleasure to see this
talented actor at last given a worthy op-
portunity, after years of being the man
who didn't get Doris Day at the end
of the picture.
The film is imaginatively designed
and colored, with particularly memor-
able exteriors, and throughout there
are delightful touches of foolery like
the momentary appearance of Tony
Randall in his own person in the circus
audience, or the bagpipe music that ac-
companies the surprising apparition of
the Loch Ness Monster.
Terry Lewis is director and star of
“The Patsy”, a comedy which begins
promisingly with a production team’s
efforts to find a new boy to replace a
film star accidentally killed. Their efforts
to train a blockheaded hotel bellboy as
the new star bring a few very funny mo-
ments and some touches of sharp satire,
but they're widely spaced, since Jerry
Lewis’ understandable aim as director
is to keep himself on the screen all the
time.
This is unfair, to say the least, to
people like Peter Lorre, John Carradine,
Hans Conried and Everett Sloane. Also,
Lewis is not the best judge of his own
talent (which if disciplined is consider-
able) and allows himself to waste time
in idiotic gibbering; and his conviction
that he is a Chaplin-like, broken-hearted
clown is without foundation.
TELEVISION
Period Piece
Six Characters in Search of an Author.
Channel 2, Sydney.
Oirandello’s gimmicky period piece of
1 experimental drama came up sur-
prisingly well on ABC -TV the other
week. One might have wondered how
it could have survived a Second World
War let alone James Baldwin and Ed-
ward Albee—but it did. The six charac-
ters went through their ritualistic paces
and spoke their well ordered lines and,
unexpectedly, managed to engage our
attention and eventually win from us a
sort of grudging plausibility for them-
selves. Phillip Grenville Mann did a
good job in bringing them a little more
up to date by making them six Mel-
bourne characters who leave Flinders
St Station to burst into a TV rehearsal,
and Norman Kaye did a fine job of
acting as the father. In fact it was a
very good cast all round except that
Marea Letho as the stepdaughter might
have done better if she had spoken up
a little. However, that’s cavilling a bit
when one might say of the six that they
left viewers convinced that when it was
all over they were still wandering
around Melbourne in search of an
author.
P.D.H.
Victoriana
The Victorians. Channel 2, Sydney.
The Road. Channel 2, Sydney.
Tt is a wonder that some enterprising
A TV producer has not previously ex-
plored the rich field of Victorian drama.
Certainly the plays that entranced our
great-grandparents present some tricky
problems in acting and direction. They
can be treated as huge jokes and present-
ed with a bouncing gusto that simply
invites us to sit back and laugh at their
comical naivety. Or they can be played
perfectly straight. This is much more
difficult, but it can be done. I remember
once seeing a revival of “East Lynne” at
a shabby old theatre in Camden Town,
London. It would be an exaggeration
to say that the audience came to guffaw
and stayed to weep, but, by the time
the play arrived at that immortal line,
“Dead, and never called me mother!”,
you could have heard a pin drop. I dare
say most of us are dreadful sentimen-
talists at heart.
Underplaying, however, can be just
as hazardous as overplaying. Stripped of
their heroic gestures, mid-Victorian
dramas can be as dull as cold suet pud-
ding. “The Rent Day”, the first of a new
BBC series on Sydney’s Channel 2 on
Saturday evenings, did not entirely escape
the pitfall of understatement. Under the
general title of “The Victorians”, the
series is to consist of shortened film ver-
sions of eight plays by authors ranging
from Douglas Jerrold at the very begin-
ning of the Victorian age to Sir Arthur
Pinero at the very end. It includes such
classics as Boucicault’s “London Assur-
ance”, Tom Taylor’s “The Ticket-of-


Leave Man” and Henry Arthur Jones’s
“The Silver King”. It it a good selection,
though connoisseurs of Victoriana will
regret the absence of T. W. Robertson’s
masterpiece of innocent snobbery,
“Caste”, and it would have been good to
see one of the melodramas in which
Henry Irving once held Lyceum audi-
ences spellbound, either “The Bells” or
“The Lyons Mail”.
Strictly, “The Rent Day” does not
belong to the Victorian era as it was first
produced in 1832. But Douglas Jerrold,
one of the most remarkable jacks of all
trades in literary history, was a theatrical
pioneer in his day and his play contains
all the ingredients of the tear-jerkers
that flooded the stage for the next 50
years. In “The Rent Day” we met all
the stock characters' the evicted
tenant, the grasping land agent (in this
case unmasked, oddly enough, as a
retired highwayman), the heroine fend-
ing off the lecher, and the kindly young
squire setting all to rights in the end.
Victorian playwrights did not need a
Hays Office to tell them that vice should
be punished and virtue rewarded. Things
might be different in real life, but in those
days people did not go to the theatre to
peer into the squalid depths of contem-
porary England.
The director of “The Rent Day” was
obviously anxious to avoid over-exaggera-
tion and the players perhaps leaned over
a bit too far in their determination not
to guy their roles. Sometimes they
sounded positively apologetic. The movie
camera offers wonderful opportunities
for the melodramatic “aside” (remember
Olivier confiding his villainy to the close-
up lens in “Richard III”), but little use
was made of that device here. I couldn’t
help feeling that a mid-Victorian audi-
ence would have found the whole thing
rather tame. However, despite its re-
ticent acting and rather unimaginative
camera work, “The Rent Day” was good
entertainment and promised well for the
rest of the series.
“The Road”, last week’s ABC tele-
vision drama on Channel 2, Sydney, was
a “time play” with an unusual approach.
Set in 18th century England, it told of a
ghost-hunting expedition organised by a
rural squire, one of whose villagers has
heard terrifying noises in the woods at
night. The expedition, equipped with
lightning conductors and other para-
phernalia (for the squire is an amateur
scientist), ends in a brief, nightmarish
vision of the 20th century world to the
accompaniment of crashing bombs, air
raid sirens and a manic babble of fright-
ened human voices.
An excellent idea, yet somehow the
Melbourne production of the play never
really got off the ground until the last
few minutes. Instead of generating steadi-
ly-mounting tension it lumbered along,
bowed down, it seemed, by the weight
of the lines. The central weakness was
Alexander Archdale’s portrayal of the
rationalist from London whose smug
18th century philosophy of “enlighten-
ment” explodes in his face at the end.
Archdale is an actor of power rather than
subtlety. He turned the rationalist into
a contemptuous roarer when he would
have been far more convincing as a cold-
blooded sneerer. Competent perform-
ances came from Norman Kaye as the
squire and Martin Magee as the young
yokel whose experiences started the
whole business.

“jVfvKE a joyous noise unto the Lord.
-*■*-*■ Sing with a loud voice.” These
words, spoken by David in the 66th
Psalm, could easily have referred to the
Gospel music of the American Negro
and, especially to its greatest exponent,
Mahalia Jackson. My introduction to
Miss Jackson’s voice was some fifteen
years ago on a 78 rpm record of “In
My Home Over There” and since then,
in my ears, she can do no wrong.
She has a powerful contralto, perfectly
controlled and capable of the most subtle
nuances; a rich, dark flow of sound full
of the history of her race. Secular songs
are not generally included in her reper-
toire, but, no doubt due to the influence
of Bessie Smith during her New Orleans
girlhood, her voice is steeped in the “sin-
ful” inflections of the Blues. As a member
of the Sanctified Church in Mount Ver-
non is supposed to have said: “Mahalia,
she add more flowers and feathers than
anybody, and they all is exactly right.”
I have come to distrust records on
which jazz artists are accompanied by
concert orchestras: as a rule they detract
from the performance by negating the
essential spontaneity and overloading the
beat. “Let’s Pray Together” has an
orchestra and choir conducted by Marty
Paich and it must be admitted that he has
created a setting which is at once sym-
pathetic, rich and unobtrusive.
Some years ago, jazz critic Leonard
Feather compiled a jazz encyclopedia
which is now considered an essential
reference book on the subject. Attempt-
ing the same task on record presents in-
surmountable difficulties and becomes
merely an excuse for the issue of a mixed
bag of samples from each decade.
“Jazz of the Forties” is truly represen-
tative of the period but I believe more
exciting examples could have been found
than Artie Shaw’s “I Get a Kick Out Of
You”, Stan Kenton’s “Gambler’s Blues”,
Eddie Heywood’s “How High the Moon”
(even if this was virtually the national
anthem of jazz at the time), and “Honey-
suckle Rose” by the King Cole Trio. On
the other hand: “Wee Baby Blues”, which
mingles the stylistically diverse elements
of Joe Turner’s blues shouting with the
rococo piano of Art Tatum, is something
quite special; Coleman Hawkins solos
mightily on “How Deep Is the Ocean?”;
there is some happy Dixieland from the
Condon mob; Billie Holiday contributes
a moving “Lover Man”; and Lionel
Hampton, Woody Herman and Jay Mc-
Shann capably illustrate the big-band
sound of the era.
With his second album, Gary Shear-
ston unquestionably establishes himself as
one of the leading lights in the Austra-
lian corner of the folk revival. On “Songs
Of Our Time” his material is more
varied and interesting than on his first
record; but, unfortunately, he pushes
number after number to the brink of the
corn-belt with his adenoidal heartiness. In
three songs (Bob Dylan’s haunting “Don’t
Think Twice, It’s Alright”, Ewan Mc-
Coll’s “Dirty Old Town” and his own
“Don’t Wave to Me too Long”), Gary
overcomes this dreary nasal tonality by
pitching his voice higher and singing
more softly.
Bob Dylan’s marvellous attack on the
boxing racket, “Who Killed Dave'
Moore?”, suffers by comparison with
American versions as does the saim
composer’s “Hard Rain’s Agonna Fall'
a vivid contemporary poem which Mi
Shearston causes to sound pompous by
his over-emphatic treatment.
“Basic Wage Dream” and “It’s On"
are signs of a bright future for Austra-
lian composer, Don Henderson, and “We
Want Freedom” (the Aboriginal Char-
ter of Rights) is strikingly original. Two
lullabies written by Dorothy Hewett, dis-
mally set to music by Mike Leyden, and
sung in an expressionless drone by Gary
Shearston, can only be described as
awful.

only has he paired the artists and pro-
jects happily but the commissions have
been sufficiently challenging to give im-
petus to each painter’s development.
Mr Crooke has previously shown a
marked preference for, and a detached
yet sympathetic attitude towards North
Queensland. Such paintings were especial-
ly noted for their outstanding renditions
of heat, light and landscape. Thus the
artist did not come upon New Guinea
as romantically or artistically unprepared
as he might have done. For these rea-
sons one cannot feel deflated when this
series contains a large proportion of
paintings in a similar vein and only a
few canvases with noteworthy stylistic
deviations. Nonetheless stagnation is not
an element in the show, and these depar-
tures mark Ray Crooke’s coming of age
as a painter.
self-consciousness caused by his de-
ficiency in draftsmanship and compo-
sition is no longer so apparent. Instead
he has accepted his skill in creating a
still-life type pattern as a positive force
in itself and has proceeded with added
assurance to further perfect and vary
this most individual and magical langu-
age.
Crooke’s forte, a diffused Vermeerian
light that orders the dark -near-interior
and more distant sun-flooded exterior in
“Dawn, Papua” and “Koki Market”, has
rarely been as well controlled. But its
added effectiveness stems from the fact
that Crooke has increased his usually
subdued palette to include more intensely
emotional colors. It is these newer hues
that comprise the more striking areas
of canvas, and only rarely is a painting’s
tonal harmony lost because one hue, such
as the green in “Men in Masks”, is over-
powering. More frequently paintings
(“New Guinea Triptych”, “Koki Market”,
“Natives with Foliage”) contain large
passages where these colors have been
juxtaposed, forming abstracted designs
inspired by natural objects. Line is often
tentatively included in these and greatly
increases their emotional scope. In “New
Guinea Triptych" Crooke, for the first
time, consciously alters his usual
objective still-life interpretation for a
subjective rhythmical rendition of land-
scape evocative of the region’s eruptive,
seething nature that also alludes to the
characteristic mysterious brooding of its
inhabitants.
“Man Dancer” and lesser portrait
studies also fall into his new emotionally-
charged vein. However, both their con-
tent and the broad, sweeping application
of paint employed in them, are in a
nascent state and most undergo consider-
able refinement before becoming effective
champions of the artist’s very personal
responses. The introduction of impasto
in his flat, carefully-finished paint sur-
face is an even more disturbing device.
At present impastos such as the blue in
“Village, Rabaul” are arbitrary and
detract from what otherwise deserves
undivided attention. Nonetheless, the
very inclusion of thicker paint areas ex-
tends Crooke beyond his usual technical
range.
These innovations may be ascribed to
three factors —Crooke’s obvious growing
proficency and desire to explore new
ground; the challenge thrown up by the
new locale; the artificial circumstances
arising out of the terms of the commis-
sion. The third is perhaps the most
important factor. Previously, Crooke has
always worked slowly, leaving ample time
for an unrushed mental savoring of his
visual impressions. This was not pos-
sible in six months, and the result is that
he has had to paint immediately while
the images are still fresh. Naturally, the
artist would admit a preference for his
former method, but it is nevertheless true
that none of his magic is lost, and much
seems to have been gained, by the adop-
tion of new techniques.

Shades of the Prison-house
Friedrich Durrenmatt and the theme of liberty
By DAVID MARTIN
Four Plays. Friedrich Durrenmatt.
Jonathan Cape. 58s.
T|urrenmatt is the most important
dramatist working in Europe today
perhaps the most important in the
world. Embracing all opposites, un-
limited in his themes and apparently
with complete access to sub-threshold
levels of consciousness, his plays are as
difficult to generalise about as they could
possibly be; as difficult, one might say,
as life itself. “Only dilettanti worry about
style”, he once wrote. There is no rule
which he does not break, no experiment
he is not prepared to try. Nevertheless,
he is a playwright of classical dimensions.
Having studied philosophy, he still
disclaims that he is a philosopher in the
theatre. (“I speak only to those who fall
asleep listening to Heidegger.”) The
modern stage, he proclaims, is both a
museum and a laboratory, and the gro-
tesque only a way of making us per-
ceive the face- of a world without face.
The tragic is still possible, but pure
tragedy not. Tragedy predicates a true
community whose existence is now but
an embarrassing fiction. Heroes and the
state have become, to him, amorphous
abstractions; only in reducing his subjects
can the artist regain supremacy over his
materials. The solution is a comedy
which, in refusing to distinguish between
symbol and reality, creates its own real-
ism, confounding Aristotle with Aristo-
phanes.
Even Diirrenmatt’s prefatorial lecture
makes no easier an analytical approach
to these four plays, written in the period
1957-62, and consisting of “Romulus the
Great”, “The Marriage of Mr Missis-
sippi”, “An Angel Comes to Babylon”
and “The Physicists”. There is an almost
irresistible temptation to theorise about
his affinities with Nestroy— to whom
Durrenmatt would perhaps feel closest —
Brecht and particularly Max Frisch, that
other Swiss master. Yet all such com-
parisons could be barren. There is more
than a thematic resemblance to Frisch’s
“I am not Stiller” in “Mr Mississippi”,
and the “Swissness” of both authors is
much more than incidentally important:
it conditions their mood and the direction
of their attack. But Frisch is an ironist
and Durrenmatt has been called “an
apocalyptic in a small frame”. From
Brecht, Durrenmatt has borrowed parts
of his method and his attitude to the
role of the audience, but he is never an
ideologue. There's a similar element of
oratory but an opposite purpose. Dur-
renmatt cares little for men as outcrops
of their historic milieu, only for the
naked individual. The strange thing is
that while Brecht's political optimism
may somehow conduce to a sense of des-
pair, Diirrenmatt's cruel grotesqueries, at
the expense mainly of the universal
“Spiessburger” or petit bourgeois, white
or red, do not deprive us of hope.
Fraiilein von Zahnd, in her aristocratic
loonie-bin for physicists who are pretend-
ing to be mad to escape their irresponsi-
bilities, presides over an establishment in
which the victims choose freedom, and
murder their loving nurses that they may
not murder humanity.
HP hat sounds like Satre. But “Romulus”
could have been written by Show,
except that it is so sparse. The last
Roman emperor breeds his ridiculous
chickens while the Teutons conquer Italy
and the one devoted soldier who is left
wants to kill him for his uselessness. Old
Romulus, typically enough, is a methodi-
cal madman. He calculatingly aims at
ending the glorious sham, and when
Odoaker arrives he is hilariously found
to have the same objective. This is one
of the funniest and technically most per-
fect works of its kind created in this
century, simplicity itself to understand
and quite astonishingly different from
“Mr Mississippi”- and “Babylon”, the
play that made Durrenmatt famous.
I doubt whether anyone could define
the first of these two. Saint-Claude is
“executed” on stage twenty seconds after
curtain-rise. He then becomes narrator
of, and protagonist in, the drama of his
once-beloved Anastasia, who murdered
a husband and is blackmailed into mar-
riage by Florestan Mississippi, Public
Prosecutor, who killed his wife. Flore-
stan ruthlessly believes in Christian jus-
tice: love and justice are the two central
motifs of the play. The whole is a vast
satire on false morality, but much more
than that. I think the biggest question
asked here is whether man can change,
and if he cannot, what sense is there in
law, punishment and love? Every device
is used to sharpen the conflicts, Diiren-
matt insisting that however fantastic the
mise-en-scene may appear it should be
as “real” as possible. There are no guilty,
no innocent; but this time we feel that,
while the gods are laughing, man weeps
and the author with him.
“An Angel Comes to Babylon”, first
of an unfinished trilogy, is the most
poetic, elusive and sometimes most mov-
ing of the four plays, also the most
affirming. Comedy or not, it is an in-
verted medieval allegory. God creates a
maiden, Kurrubi, and sends her to Baby-
lon to make happy the poorest of beg-
gars. Nebuchadnezzar, in beggar's dis-
guise, falls in love with her but, until the
king finally gets her, she is protected by
the true beggar, Akki, a picaresque
character on a Falstaffian scale. It is a
tale of misery and degradation yet
courageous in its conclusions, as magni-
ficently summed up by Akki. It accepts
the Buddhist doctrine that all is suffering,
but not that we should break the wheel,
for with all its terror it is supremely
beautiful. Diirrenmatt's free-flowing dic-
tion here and there grows tiresome, but
even in translation it holds us spellbound
most of the way.
All the plays are well translated, in-
cluding James Kirkup's version of “The
Physicists”. This is the best known here;
which is my excuse for doing no more
than mention it. It is a parable of our
time, a tragedy sublimated into icy wit
where wisdom, having destroyed the fear
of God, acknowledges only the necessity
of silent duty.
Durrenmatt is not only a playwright
but he is a playwright first and fore-
most. He wrote for radio before he
turned to the legitimate stage and his
macabre novels, barely described as
detective stories, are well known. He has
been called an uncomfortable writer, and
deservedly, but what makes him so are
the questions he asks, not the answers
he gives, if any. Ultra-modern as his
plays are, the characters often strike us
as belonging to a world which ceased to
exist. It makes them the more real
because they demonstrate, very different-

ly from their counterparts in the “absurd”
theatre, how out of joint our time is. In
Schiller's and Kleist’s tragic dramas free
men assume guilt and are punished. Diir-
renmatt tells us that freedom in the old
sense has lost its meaning: a new one has
to be found. His people are punished
because they do not know it.
Son of a pastor, I see DLirrenmatt as
Brecht’s Protestant successor, another
type of revolutionary, answerable to
conscience rather than “committed”, and
the artist most likely to do for our age,
in which all the unities have been lost,
what Ibsen did for his.

John F. Kennedy: Portrait of a Presi-
dent. Hugh Sidey. Andre Deutsch.
465.
Dome Washington comment has re-
cently begun to assume that the
brief Presidency of John Kennedy may
go down in the history books as just a
footnote in accounts of the long tenure
of power of Lyndon Johnson. Certainly
Johnson seems assured of nine full years
of office to Kennedy's less than three. It
is one of the oddities of the present con-
stitutional arrangement governing the
Presidency that those who reach it by
elevation from the Vice-Presidency at
the death of the President in office may
expect a longer run than those who
originally achieve nomination in their
own right, since the advantages that at-
tend office are likely to assure them of
two elections of their own as well as the
residue of their predecessor's term.
This is the more ironic in that Vice-
Presidents are normally chosen to “bal-
ance the ticket” (e.g., a relatively con-
servative South-Westerner, Johnson, to
run with a relatively liberal North-East-
erner, Kennedy) rather than because
they seem the second best possible
Presidents to their respective parties.
Yet the importance of a political leader
is not to be measured by the span of
time in which he holds power but by
the magnitude of the questions with
which he has to grapple and the degree
to which he succeeds in giving events
a new direction. Judged by these criteria,
Kennedy was a very important President
indeed: the man who changed the pat-
tern, in more ways than one.
Admittedly, Mr Sidey does not offer
much evidence for this rating. It is one
of those gossipy, unambitious, mildly
entertaining journalistic accounts of a
President, of which normally two or
three are produced during the term of
office of any incumbent, with an eye
especially to the market at election time.
An earlier, very Republican and malici-
ous volume of the same sort appeared
during Kennedy’s lifetime. Mr Sidey
works for a Republican magazine,
“Time”, but perhaps he is not a Re-
publican. At any rate he is certainly not
malicious: the portrait he draws of Ken-
nedy is informed with a real sympathy
for the sitter, though it is not adulatory.
Most of the book was obviously written
by the end of 1962: only the last chapter
deals with the events of 1963, including
the assassination. Almost all of the book
is wisely left to read as if Kennedy were
still alive, which enables it to avoid any
note of obituary piety. It is rather hea-
vily padded with women’s-journal stuff
about what Jackie wore on various oc-
casions, and what the chef sent up for
dinner at parties, but all one can fairly
say against it is that a book written in the
style of innocuous “human interest”
journalism about a living President and
his family is bound to seem wildly in-
adequate as an account of one tragically
dead.
Yet the fascination of the subject
shines through all this. I think it is
Aristotle who remarks that poetry may
tell us more of the truth than history,
since poetry deals with the essences of
things and history with their appearances.
Kennedy's brief time in power (which
will obviously be, in due course, the sub-
ject of many a play and novel) gains
from its very compression the shape of
poetic drama, or perhaps rather the
shape of folk-legend. His first eighteen
months of office are a chronicle of mis-
fortune in the authentic legend-tradition:
the Bay of Pigs disaster in Cuba, the
sombre first encounter with Khrushchev
in Vienna, the building of the Berlin
Wall.
comes the great crisis and its reso-
lution, in the November, 1962, con-
frontation over Cuba, and a golden
period of apparent mastery, almost uni-
versal praise and hopes for the future
(the second term) until dark forces reach
up to strike him down in that moment
of world-televised shock at Dallas. Dark
forces, or just one random madman, as
meaningless as a traffic accident? All the
best legends are ambiguous, so the un-
certainties round the end of this one only
add to its potential, already well exempli-
fied, in fact, in the conspiracy theories
that have gathered around it.
Anyway, individual paranoia has per-
haps as good a claim as political con-
spiracy to be classified among the dark
forces. The pattern clearly parallels that
of a ballad about Billy the Kid or the
Wild Colonial Boy, as some perceptive
soul at the BBC noted in time to write
an in memoriam of the appropriate style,
the song “In the Summer of His Years”.
There is even a macabre kind of dramatic
logic about the circumstance that the
first major political leader who seemed to
belong wholly to this century, who
moved naturally in a world in which
television is a powerful political instru-
mentality, and who used that intrumen-
tality to project a charismatic leader-
ship, should have met death with full
world coverage in the medium.
Foreign affairs dominated the three
years of the Kennedy Administration,
and its real chronicling will have to wait
for the diplomatic histroians, of whom
Mr Sidey is certainly not one. There is
rather less substance, for instance, in his
account of the 1962 Cuban crisis than
can readily be derived from the “New
York Times”. In domestic affairs, Ken-
nedy’s memorial will be the Civil Rights
Bill, which he originated, though it took
Lyndon Johnson to get it through Con-
gress.
But as much as anything, his break
with averageness was in his own charac-
ter and circumstances. He deviated in
more ways than in his religious affiliation
from the standard pattern of an Ameri-
can with political ambitions. An urbane,
reserved, tenacious, complex man,, sur-
prisingly often alone despite his throng-
ing family, he was charged with that
competitive drive with which the elder
Kennedys seemed to endow their child-
ren. “Jack works as hard as a human
can, and Bobby works a little harder than
Jack”, old Joe Kennedy once remarked.
He enjoyed power and politics im-
mensely, but was capable of applying
his ironic humor to his own ambitions.
When someone once asked him why he
wanted to be President, he listed soberly


his official political objectives, then added
“Besides, the pay’s good”.
The eighteenth-century framers of the
American Presidency made the role that
of an elected monarch, and few Presi-
dents have understood this so well as
Kennedy, or seemed as fitted to it.

Ephemerals
Australian Little Magazines 1923-
1954. John Tregenza. Libraries
Board of South Australia. 30s.
/Ane of the problems in writing such
” a survey as this (published earlier
this year) is where to draw your bound-
aries. Tregenza limits his field by speci-
fying “little” magazines and devotes his
introduction to the matter of definition.
Margaret Anderson’s “Little Review”
(1914-29), published in Chicago, then
in New York, and finally in Paris, is re-
garded as the prototype, and the essen-
tial features of the little magazine are
taken to be a limited and uncompromis-
ing circle of readers, avant-garde atti-
tudes, and critical examination of social
issues.
Surveying the rapid growth of such
publications overseas from the time of
World War I onwards, and in Australia
in the 1930 s and 19405, Tregenza feels
he is able to describe them as “products
of an age of anxiety”. Quick to sprout,
they are, by the same token, liable to
wither just as suddenly; but the ephem-
eral in this field may well develop a
significance out of all proportion to its
size and life-span. Tregenza rightly in-
sists on this in his Epilogue and, indeed,
it is a fair conclusion to draw from the
extremely interesting material presented
in his central chapters.
A definition which insists on the avant-
garde element will not, however, take in
all the publications that come to mind in
a discussion of Australian magazines.
Avant-garde does apply to “Vision”, des-
pite its harking back to the English nine-
ties, and to “Angry Penguins”. A maga-
zine like “Australian New Writing”, on
the other hand, while offering social
criticism, is clearly not avant-garde in
any comparable way whatever might
be claimed for the progressiveness of its
political views. Tregenza is aware of this,
of course, but the original definition is a
trifle misleading.
In a text of 87 pages about ten pages
are given to “Vision” and twelve to
“Angry Penguins” and the Ern Malley
affair, and this sort of emphasis shows
where Tregenza’s interests mainly lie.
Since no account of these three decades
could ignore those very different maga-
zines “Southerly” and “Meanjin” (our
oldest extant specimens) Tregenza gives
them a couple of pages, but he describes
them as “deliberately eclectic” in outlook
and therefore not a primary concern of
his.
The value of this book lies in its ac-
count of the rise and fall of numerous
Australian magazines (including the
little-known ones) over a period of thirty
years, and in its placing of them in their
historical and cultural settings. Com-
ments are offered also on their literary
and sociological significance—one would
like more of these as they are often
illuminating: as when Tregenza draws a
parallel between the anti-fascist free
verse of “Point” and the jingoistic ballads
of the early 20th century, or when he
says “If the encouragement of experi-
mentalism is a little magazine function,
so too is the satire of experimentalism”,
or when, discussing leftist magazines, he
writes “Unintentionally ‘Yesterday and
Most of Today’ illustrates the fact that
the gulf between the writer and the
organiser, whether in a capitalist or
communist society, can be just as deep
as that, much emphasised by the Marx-
ists, between the capitalist and the
worker”.
A lot of information is packed into
this carefully documented little book. (An
error occurs on p. 20 Brian Penton was
editor of the Daily Telegraph, not The
Sydney Morning Herald.) There are four
illustrations and a valuable bibliography,
which provides considerable detail on
48 magazines of the period covered.
The Epilogue glances at publications
since 1953 and raises the general ques-
tion of subsidies. Pointer to the times
this book is published with the assistance
of the Commonwealth Literary Fund.

T>osacoke Mustian has loved Wesley
Beavers for eight years but she is
unsure of his love for her. The actions
which her emotions generate form the
skeletal plot of this first novel the Ameri-
can author Reynolds Price originally
published in 1962.
D. H. Lawrence remarked that “to be
great, a novel must have poetic insight”,
and though this novel is far removed
from Lawrence’s work it has some of
the qualities implied in that statement.
There are passages where the dialogue
is stilted, but any lapse is made up for
by the quality of poetic intensity in the
rest of the work. Price writes from the
interior of Rosa and works outwards to
the world of family relationships and
Wesley. The secondary characters are
neither blurred nor two-dimensional.
Wesley’s strangeness, his inability to
commit himself to Rosa, is heightened
by the author’s technique of juxtaposing
an image with an event. When Rosa is
under intense emotional stress we are
made to see Wesley as a hawk, a solitary
“killing bird”. Whilst ordinary prose
produces its effects cumulatively, Price
charges his prose by weaving imagery
and symbolism, the change from summer
to winter, into the events of the book so
that the total effect is of compression as
in a dream when a host of associations
condense into a compact form. Mildred,
Rosa’s friend, is seen before the birth of
her child which kills her: “her load
growing in her every second . . . sucking
blind at her life ...” This image of life
drawing life from another is repeated
several times and in such a way that we
associate the image with Wesley. In re-
fusing to give he becomes a child,
sucking blind at her life. Rosa, who is
playing the part of Mary in a Christmas
pageant allows the fretting “Child Jesus”
to suckle at her breast, through the mat-
erial of her dress. All this time Wesley’s
eyes are on her. Rosa realises she must
give, and in her decision to give and
accept what little she is given, Rosa
emerges as a powerful and mature
woman.
In his latest novel Bernard Glemser
exhibits a remarkable virtuosity. His
ability in handling the technique of a
dual time-structure never falters. In
objective time the novel spans a few
hours in the life of Nicholas Hart, a
young writer, but since 15 people are
involved in building a composite picture
of Nicholas they range back in their
memories over a period of ten years.
With each first-person account we dis-
cover a little more of Nick, but a great
deal more about the narrator. There are
some delightful, unconscious self-por-
traits and as most of the 15 characters
also know each other there are many
amusing revelations as we cross-check
each story. The change in style of each
“deposition” is superbly arranged and the
dialogue is cleverly altered in tone by
the mind which records it.
The scene of the book is the literary
amphitheatre of modern New York and
so, as we would expect, the writing is
sophisticated, witty and at times a little
too effervescent; it fizzes with names
like Sartre, Camus, Mailer, Heidegger
and Nietzsche.
By the end of the novel we are familiar
with Nick’s activities but the responsi-
bility for assessing his actions is thrown
on to the reader. Uultimately we must
decide whose opinion we value most. It
is a measure of Glemser’s talent, his

City of Night
The Tenants Of Moonbloom. Edward
Lewis Wallant. Gollancz. 265.
Qince the war, the world of American
fiction has been dominated by a
number of young Jewish writers of sensi-
tivity and extraordinary facility: Salinger,
Malamud, Bellow, Shaw, Mailer and
Roth to name a few. Well up on this list
must now be placed the name of Edward
Lewis Wallant, whose posthumously
published second novel, “The Tenants of
Moonbloom”, fulfils the promise of “The
Pawnbroker” which was published two
years ago.
To read a few pages of “The Tenants
of Moonbloom” is to be reminded of a
pre-war Jewish novelist, Nathanael West
(Nathan Weinstein). Like West, Wallant
died young (in 1962) after producing
several short, brilliant novels. Like West,
he is moved by the emptiness of metro-
politan life and, like West, his weapon
to combat it is satire. Unlike West, Wal-
lant is a hopeful writer. Whereas West
reduced to absurdity the human pretence
of nobility, Wallant, if equally relentless
in his observation, is compassionate
his cure for what ails us is “love, courage,
and delusion”. Both have similar gifts for
dialogue and for the fresh, poetic image,
and both laugh through their tears.
The character about whom “The Ten-
ants of Moonbloom” revolves is Norman
Moonbloom, “a small man of definite
limitations”, a material failure who has
avoided most of the challenges and re-
sponsibilities of life. “His solitude now
was the result of his metabolism, that
constant breathing in of joy and exhala-
tion of sadness. He had come to take
shallower breaths, and the two had be-
come mercifully mixed into melancholy
contentment.”
Reduced to acting as his Rachman-
like brother’s rent-collector for four
dilapidated New York apartment houses,
he makes the mistake of becoming emo-
tionally involved with his tenants: a
prizefighter obsessed with cleanliness; a
renegade Chinaman of perverse lusts;
two jazz musicians; a homosexual Negro
writer; married couples, some with child-
ren, some old and eccentric; a father and
his sluttish daughter; and so on. Their
lives are largely shoddy and frustrated,
but all have hopes, loves, and aspira-
tions. They also have their complaints
the bad water-pressure, the unlit stairs,
the peeling paint, the dripping taps
and these Moonbloom evades, partly
through inertia and partly because his
profiteering brother doesn’t believe in
spending money on the flats. Eventually,
their complaints merge in his mind with
their personal troubles and he becomes
obsessed with the idea of helping them.
A crack appears in his shell, gradually
widening to admit a tide of human
misery and, finally, allowing him to
emerge reborn. In a sort of inspired des-
pair he decides to do all the repairs him-
self although totally unsuited to the task.
This frantic programme culminates in a
brilliantly comic episode in which Moon-
bloom, a disbarred plumber, and a
colored caretaker, all inebriated, aspire
to fix the lavatory of a tenant who is
dying of cancer.
Told in a series of brief rent-collecting
scenes, the technique is necessarily epi-
sodic and fragmentary, but the writing
is strong enough to overcome the un-
avoidable lack of continuity. Several
frank but artistically justifiable passages
may offend the few, but it is hoped that
the book escapes being Rylahed as it
merits reading by a thoughtful audience
without sniggers. This is a novel that
will live when all the “Carpetbaggers”
and “Peyton Places” have reverted to
pulp.

The Aristide Case. Storm Jameson.
Macmillan. 265.
Not in the Calendar. Margaret Ken-
nedy. Macmillan. 265.
Qtorm Jameson in “The Aristide Case”
displays the sure touch, the profes-
sional artistry and technical skill that
has distinguished so many of her earlier
novels. She writes with a masculine
directness and realism, balanced by a
feminine delicacy and sensitivity in her
handling of human emotions.
The story, one of suspense and detec-
tion, is set in a Provencal village, in the
hills behind Nice; but the characters
could represent a small cross-section of
almost any community. The complexi-
ties of their natures are analysed with
piercing dexterity and exposed with
understanding and sympathy. Optimism
for the human race seems to be the
book’s main philosophy expressed
through Aristide Michal, the lusty hero,
a Greek who has somehow got to the
South of France.
Aristide is a splendid-looking fellow,
a swashbuckling character with the
qualities for success shrewdness, ambi-
tion, vanity and pride; but he lacks the
ruthlessness necessary for materialistic
survival.


By bringing the likeable, handsome
and gay Aristide close to defeat by hu-
miliation and disappointment, Miss
Jameson has been able to emphasise her
point of human resilience.
For underlying Aristide’s swaggering
virility, his egotism and buffoonery, are
qualities discerned by his more percep-
tive friends of delicacy and subtlety,
light-hearted scepticism and tolerance.
He is able to shrug off his financial ruin
with thoughts of new plans, and to take
the shamed Lotte back on different but
acceptable terms.
The story has a vaguely related
counter-theme about a 12-year-old boy,
who. having spent all his life in Germany
with prosperous foster parents, now
comes to live with his real mother in
the village. It is a digression that simply
reiterates that inborn qualities can over-
come circumstances, and re-emphasises
the buoyancy of the human spirit.
Margaret Kennedy also has a talent
for creating singular characters. Her
specialty is a woman of rare charm,
innocently amoral, an innately good per-
son who doesn’t know or want to know,
the rules vulnerable, wayward.
In “Not in the Calendar” this charac-
ter is Caroline, one of many sisters in a
wealthy English landed family. Carrie
does not know the rules, otherwise why
would she persist in playing with the
deaf mute child of one of the servants.
That child, Carrie must be made to see,
is an imbecile, a little animal, who can
make only grunting noises; it is all most
unsuitable. But Carrie, through their
games, has got through to the human
being locked in deafness.
Miss Kennedy’s story, in effect, illus-
trates the history and development of
teaching of the deaf in England. It is
1883 when Carrie and the deaf child
Win first play together, and little was
known then or understood about training
the deaf. Win, by chance, comes later
into the hands of one of the pioneer
teachers. And when the book ends, Win
is a mature woman, who through patient
teaching, has fought through to live as a
normal, intelligent human being and be-
come a famous artist and patron of
schools for the deaf. Caroline has found
fulfilment in training the deaf.
But this is more than a documentary.
In Miss Kennedy’s gifted hands it has
become a charming and absorbing study
of human nature. Particularly it is a
study of Caroline “a saint whose name
will never be listed in the Calendar (of
saints)” because her goodness is too un-
ruly, because she shocks the righteous,
pricks the pompous, squashes humbug,
disobeys convention, but entrances those
who love and admire her.

Today and Yesterday
A DOLLAR ANNIVERSARY
Tn the 150th anniversary of the
-*■ month in which the first official
issue of dollars and their fractions was
completed in Sydney, the semblances
of the first new dollar system coins
have seen the light, embellished with
the effigies of strange birds and ani-
mals.
The issues of coinage made in
1814 consisted of £lO,OOO worth of
Spanish dollars which arrived in Syd-
ney in the lockers of the rotting sloop
HMS Samarang, peopled by the quar-
relsome Captain Case, RN, and his
even more quarrelsome crew who lent
color to their too-long stay in Sydney
by pulling down citizens’ fences, firing
shots across the bows of commercial
vessels in Sydney Cove for failing to
salute the flag and boarding them to
shanghai their crews.
The dollars were handsome, large
coins and they were conveyed rever-
ently up the hill to Government House
at the corner of Bridge and Phillip
Streets where they were carefully
counted by the Acting Commissary,
Mr William Broughton who has a
host of descendants living today,
Major Antill, Governor Macquarie’s
Major of Brigade, also represented by
20th-century descendants of fame and
renown, and Mr Thomas Archer, act-
ing Deputy Commissary. Whereafter
the services of Mr John Henshall, a
somewhat picturesque character sus-
pected of coining on his own account,
was engaged to turn each coin into
two and thus inflate their value. The
outer ring became the famous “holey
dollar” valued at 55.; The central
roundels or “dumps” were stamped
with the words Fifteen Pence on the
reverse, and a crown and New South
Wales on the obverse. Thus, the origi-
nal value of the two pieces had been
increased from ss. to 6s. 3d. The issue
of them, made gradually over the
first seven months of 1814, was com-
pleted on August 2. They have now so
far disappeared that a pair were sold
recently for £486.
We know fairly reliably who fash-
ioned the new coins out of the old.
The crude punch to cut the “dump”
out of the dollar was the work of Mr
Henry Richardson and it seems likely
that the inscriptions were struck by
hand hammer. They are not by any
means regular or uniform among dif-
ferent coins.
It went without saying that so enter-
prising a population as that of New
South Wales did not long delay in
turning the new coinage to account.
Visiting mariners hastened to get some
experienced coiner or workman to
operate on their ship's stores of
dollars to turn them into two pieces
and increase their value by Is. 3d.
Even more enterprising ones per-
haps Mr Henshall among them be-
came a sore on the neck of the Bank
of New South Wales after it was
founded in 1817, by circulating dollars
and dumps of base metal, dollars
without the colonial mark, dollars with
counterfeit marks and a date reversed.
Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane de-
cided to end the use of the “holey
dollar" in 1822, but it was 1829 be-
fore they were safely collected. The
dollar as a unit of currency had be-
gun to go out in 1825. Wil’iam
Charles Wentworth's first bank book
with the Bank of New South Wales
dated in that year is made out in
dollars. It still exists.
The first bank notes were issued
by the Bank of New South Wales in
its foundation year 639 five-pound
notes; 1794 one-pound notes; 440
valued at 10s. each, 1192 at ss. and
several thousand two-shilling, shilling
and sixpenny tokens all dated April,
1817. This produced another cur-
rency.
Each of the notes was inscribed as
fallows:
Let us possess the public confidence
sxj long only as, by a faithful discharge
cf the honorable trust imposed in us,
we may show ourselves worthy of it.
Whenever any one man can say, “the
Bank has broken faith”, be then our
ruin and ours only, the immediate
consequences.
Some of these notes, if they still
existed would have value for their
autographs. They were all made out
payable to a mythical J. Lee and
signed in person by directors. It
proved either that some directors were
fond of signing them, or became
hypnotised while signing them and
signed a lot more than they should
have, since it was presently found
that the note issue was about 100 per
cent more numerous than it should
have been and that the Bank was
facing the “ruin” which it had men-
tioned in its pathetic inscription.
The Cashier of the Bank, who had
previously been secretary of the Bene-
volent Society, when asked whether
he had kept the numbers of each note
signed by particular directors, ans-
wered in shocked tones: “No, sir. The
directors are all gentlemen, and they
would have resented it.”

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Irritation at Government Spending
Australian industries, now faced with rising wages, higher
costs and the burden of an extra 6d. in the £ company
tax, are a little browned off at the startling increase in
Government expenditure this financial year. The Associated
Chambers of Commerce of Australia, in the latest issue of
the newsletter “Canberra Comments”, quite reasonably point
out that the private sector of the economy would have accepted
the increase in defence expenditure, even if it had been con-
siderably larger. But they are unhappy about the massive
increase in other Governmental spending.
Taxpayers are entitled to feel a little irked at shouldering
an unequal burden. If inflation is to be checked, they want
to see some restraints on Government spending as well as their
own.
From a company viewpoint, the Associated Chambers of
Commerce take issue with the Federal Treasurer, Mr Holt,
when he claims that tax on all companies should rise because
some manufacturing and mining companies, and some
exporters, would share in £3O million of tax concessions
previously granted by the Government. What about all the
other companies?
The period of tighter money, labor shortages and incipient
inflation inevitably must cause irritation to those companies
which are emerging from a difficult period after the 1960
credit squeeze. Their outlook was not helped any last week
when Mr Staniforth Ricketson came out with yet another
of his predictions, suggesting that another cycle of Govern-
ment monetary measures could be initiated should the Govern-
ment consider that inflationary pressures were jeopardising
cost and price stability. Mr Ricketson claimed that the
Treasurer's Budget speech tended to confirm the possible
erroneous impression that official policy relied more on cor-
rective actions than on prior planning.
Along with this dig at Mr Holt, it seems that Mr Ricketson
believes the danger of inflation is overrated, because he says
that competitive trading conditions should continue to restrain
prices and that there was no evidence of an unexpected
upsurge in consumer spending.
External influences, of course, must play their part and
the effect of rising imports and falling commodity prices
could alter the picture rapidly, thus influencing another loosen-
ing of Government screws.
An En-Zedder in the
Packaging Camp
Pantry of the United Empire Box Co. Ltd, of New Zealand,
into the moulded pulp packaging business in New South
Wales brings further competition to the booming packaging
industry and poses new queries on takeover possibilities.
When inquirers, seeking to track down the elusive bidder
for National Bag, Melbourne, were running out of likely
suitors, United Empire Box Co. Ltd was seized on as a possible
outsider. But the proposed method of entry to the Australian
market seems to knock that idea on the head.
UEB says it will establish a plant in conjunction with an
unnamed overseas partner and is placing 600,000 ss. shares
at 13s. 6d. (Aust.) a share, thus raising £405,000. This is
hardly the sort of deal for taking over the 3.1 million ss.
shares of National Bag, which are capitalised in the market
at nearly £4m.
However, with an overseas partner plus lan Potter and
Australian United Corporation Ltd as underwriters, UEB is
starting off in the right circles and doubtless will cause some
re-thinking in the packaging camps.
Listing Requirements
Spelled Out
Australian Associated Stock Exchanges are leaving
nothing to chance in keeping company secretaries informed
on the correct procedures to be followed by public companies
both before they apply for listing and after they are listed
on the Stock Exchange.
A special edition of listing requirements has been prepared
and forwarded to the secretary of every listed company to
guide them in all aspects of Stock Exchange requirements. The
guide is in a manual form with a detailed index.
The Stock Exchanges are now keeping up with modern
methods of maintaining share registers by mechanical means
and EDP systems. As a result, the use of a rubber seal and
facsimile signatures on share certificates is now permitted
without having to bear evidence of audit.
A new section has been written on takeovers, designed to
protect the market from uninformed speculation. The princi-
pal point on new takeover requirements is that the listed
company which receives the takeover offer must notify the
Exchange when a notice of intention of a takeover is received,
as distinct from the formal legal offer required to be submitted
under the Companies Act by the company which is making
the takeover offer.
Other new points include detailed requirements to be
observed by property trusts when applying for listing. This
follows the Stock Exchanges’ agreement to list property trusts,
announced earlier this year.
Recommendations are given to directors to guide them
when considering new issues, while explicit details of listing
requirements are itemised for the guidance of companies if
they wish to remain on the official Stock Exchange list.
A company secretary’s guide at the back of the listing
manual sets out the responsibilities of a company in making
announcements to the Stock Exchanges and advises that all
Australian Associated Stock Exchanges are now connected on
a telex service so that telegrams or telex messages may be sent
to all Exchanges by booking a “conference” call through the
PMG telex operator. Notification of the home Exchange is
not sufficient if a company's shares are listed on other
exchanges.
All announcements by telephone, telegram or telex must
be confirmed immediately in writing on company letterhead.
The Stock Exchanges also have issued a testy reminder that
any announcements, including public relations announce-
ments, on a company’s activities should be supplied to the
Stock Exchange not later than the release to the Press.


Preliminary profit statements must include a comparison
with the previous year and should be submitted in a uniform
style as set out in the secretary’s guide. This should help to
avoid confusion.
Incidentally, the recognised Stock Exchanges in Australia
are: Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney,
Ballarat, Bendigo, Launceston, Newcastle, Rockhampton.
Economist Urges Contributory
Pensions Scheme
lt/lR Ronald Gates’ paper “Incomes for the Aged”, delivered
to the winter school of the Economics Society of Australia
and New Zealand held in Sydney, deserves to be taken very
seriously indeed. It may, unfortunately, tend to suffer the
dismissal often given to proposals for contributory pension
schemes. Yet among the spate of criticisms of Australian
social services, Mr Gates furnishes a well-founded argument.
Social services in countries at Australia’s present economic
stage should never be regarded, in Professor R. M. Titmus’s
phrase, as “things apart; as phenomena of marginal interest,
like looking out of the window on a train journey”.
Titmus further emphasises: “They are part of the journey
itself. They are an integral part of industrialisation.”
That “integral part”, for age pensions alone, cost Australia
some £166 million in 1963-64 —representing 40 p.c. of all
National Welfare Fund payments, 9.7 p.c. of the Federal
Government’s net current outlay, and 1.9 p.c. of the gross
national product. “About 57i p.c. of the population of men
aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over are in receipt
of means-tested pensions from the Federal Government,”
Mr Gates points out.
Apart from the perpetual question of adequacy, the main
pensions’ battles are fought around the justice and necessity
of the means test. “As a result of the means test and of the
progressive character of the overall tax structure, age pensions
have become a powerful engine of income redistribution from
the relatively rich to the relatively poor,” Gates explains.
He also asserts, however, that “the means test imposes a
welfare loss on the recipients of pensions by inducing them
so to modify their choices that they obtain less than the
maximum satisfaction from their total resources, including
their pensions. The main departures from optimal choice have
been in transforming or dispos-
ing of assets, and in ceasing or
reducing gainful and psychologi-
cally-rewarding employment.”
In other words, people often
shed assets unwisely in order to
qualify for pensions. The incen-
tive to save is discouraged in the
very guise of providing welfare.
Statistical evidence suggests,
too, that the allowable non-pen-
sion portion of a full pensioner’s
whole income has hardly kept
pace with basic-wage rises. It
has quite definitely lagged be-
hind any improvement in the
average employee’s real earn-
ings.
Mr Gates does not believe
that gradual changes in the
Australian pension system can
make it either more efficient
economically or more equitable.
There may be no practical
alternative to a clean break.
The prospects for world wheat crops and their disposal are
discussed in an article on this page. The above graph sets out
Australian production and exports over the four years up to
1963-64.
Thus he is led to propose a National Superannuation Fund,
financially self-contained and operating on an actuarial basis.
Everybody between the ages of 20 and 59 should be called on
for a uniform annual contribution, at present working out at
about £26 to give a monthly pension, at 60, of £27.
Though this end result is to be free of means test, the
scheme requires that the Federal Government subsidise indi-
vidual contributions, where necessary in terms of average
family earnings, on a sliding-scale family means test. Both
pension rates and contributions would be varied yearly in
accord with movements in the overall earnings index.
The proposals embrace a method of financing the fund by
means of National Superannuation Bonds and cover means of
transition to the new scheme.
Wheat Surpluses for the
Western Nations
Bulletin has been warning in these columns of
prospective wheat surpluses in the Western world follow-
ing a bumper selling year when the Soviet and Red China
bought extensively. The Communists obviously are desperately
trying to avoid a similar crisis this coming financial year and
the depleted storage silos in the West have encouraged en-
thusiastic plantings. As a result, good crops in Communist
and Western European areas could spell surplus with a capital
“S”.
There is plenty of harvesting to be done before the final
figures are on the board —and nature often plays tricks on
hopeful farmers—but latest reports indicate surplus export
crops.
Canada and Australia are expected to have lower wheat
crops, though France is expected to have three million tons
available for export after meeting Common Market demands.
Italy expects to harvest 13 p.c. more than last year and is
looking hopefully for exports. The US also expects a 13 p.c.
higher harvest, but expects exports to drop by as much as
20 p.c.
Russia may get along much better than Red China, whose
harvest is not expected to meet basic demands following last
year's drought. Assuming Red China can afford it, experts
believe she may buy another five million tons, which may
permit Australia to maintain this market —assuming Russia, or
some other producer, does not step into the Red China market.
European reports now suggest
that the Russian harvest could
reach 140 million tons against
last year’s estimated 105 mil-
lion tons. If this is correct,
Russian wheat could have an
important influence on export
prices, because last year’s sharp
decline in Russian livestock
(slaughtered because of the
shortage of feed grains) could
reduce Russian requirements
for food grains possibly by six
million tons.
Against this, Western wheat
exporters hope Russia will build
up its wheat stocks again by
making purchases from the
West. There are so many “ifs”
and “buts” that it makes wheat
forecasts speculative and vul-
nerable. Nevertheless, there are
definite signs of Western wheat
surpluses which can only be
offset by continued Communist
buying.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
CEDA’s Survey of Export Potential
A positive programme still hard to find
Conceived about three years ago, when
even Sir John Crawford was seeing
a rise in exports to £1250 million in the
then foreseeable future more as a dream
than a practical proposition, the Com-
mittee for Economic Development of
Australia’s excellent study of export
potential has emerged after a year when
exports reached the miraculous height
of £1393 million.
However, CEDA’s strong team, which
comprised a judicious mixture of indus-
trialists, businessmen and economists led
by D. H. Merry, chief economist of the
ANZ Bank, has not been blinded by
last year’s bonanza. Sensibly, it has
based its projections on 1962-63, when
exports were much more sober and, on
its own construction of what it terms the
“normal” balance of payments for that
year, reserves would have fallen by
£lOO million. In actual fact reserves
gained £65 million in that year after a
net payment of £l2 million to the IMF.
So it can be seen at once that the report
is projecting the task for increasing ex-
ports to the required extent to achieve
external balance in 1972-73 against a
background far, far removed from last
year’s exceptional experience.
The report is modest in its claims as
a crystal ball reader of the possible pat-
tern and content of all the other items in
the balance of payments for 1972-73,
for in fact it makes a very brave shot.
In arriving at three different rates for the
required growth in export income to
achieve external balance in that year,
the only variable taken is capital inflow,
for which it makes three assumptions.
If net capital inflow is taken as £350 mil-
lion for 1972-73, imports rise to £1675
million (in the same “normal” sense as
imports for 1962-63 are put at £1075
million) and net invisibles cost us £350
million, then to achieve external balance
exports would have to increase by 5 p.c.
a year on the “normal” figure of
£lOOO million taken for 1962-63. That
is, exports would have to rise to
£1675 million (some £lBO million more
than the “normal” figure for 1962-63).
Qiven the same assumption with the ex-
ception of taking net capital inflow in
1972-73 as £325 million instead of
£350 million, a 5} p.c. a year increase in
exports from the 1962-63 “normal”
would be required to achieve external
balance. And if £2OO million is assumed
for net capital inflow in that year, then
a n annual rate of 6 p.c. increase in
exports would be required. In other
words, the report thinks it reasonable to
assume that something between an in-
crease of 5 to 6 p.c. in exports on 1962-
63 normal will be required by 1972-73.
As it aptly says, “Economics is no more
prophecy than physics; neither can fore-
tell the future” and the range of possibly
relevant assumptions about imports, capi-
tal inflow and net invisibles is wide.
The report achieves a fascinating eco-
nomics exercise in making this model.
It also has an intriguing essay, shyly
relegated to an appendix (as indeed is its
balance-of-payments model), on the
question whether exports should be
stimulated by some form of exchange
depreciation, though how far all the
authors would go in supporting the con-
clusion that a 2 to 4 p.c. annual fluctua-
tion in the exchange rate would be
desirable is left open. At any rate, a
way out looks to have been left for
dissenters, as there is some equivocation.
For instance, the report says “if we do
decide to make use of the exchange rate
(to help exports) a fluctuating rate may
well be the best way of doing so, but
if we can adjust our balance of pay-
ments successfully with a fixed rate—and
without prejudicing our rate of econo-
mic growth—this would be preferable”.
T>alliatives like exchange depreciation
A apart, the report's conclusions, parti-
cularly on the practicability of a massive
increase in exports of manufactures, are
not as penetrating as one might have ex-
pected. It is possibly a case of too many
expert cooks spoiling the final broth,
into which everything, including a plea
for the right amount of W'orld liquidity
for the maximum expansion of world
trade, is thrown in.
Yet there is preciseness in the main
conclusion that “the prospects of pro-
ducing and selling enough primary ex-
ports to close the long-run export gap
do not look bright. Primary exports will
have to provide most of the extra earn-
ings, but they cannot be expected to pro-
vide all of what we need. Manufactured
exports will have to rise even faster than
primary exports in a world of increasing
competitiveness.
“The likelihood of an ‘export gap’ sug-
gests positive measures to stimulate all
exports. Yet policy measures designed to
stimulate farm output will be abortive
if the resultant increase in exports cannot
be sold. This is a real long-term danger
for many of Australia’s major exports
wheat, dairy produce, sugar, dried and
canned fruits, and eggs in particular.”
Of possible measures to help primary
exports, the report suggests improved ru-
ral facilities to encourage low-cost ex-
pansion of output would make a valuable
contribution and that the expansion of
the special term credit facilities of the
trading banks would also assist.
Again, “there is a good case for in-
creasing Government expenditure on
agricultural research and extension ser-
vices”. But “any special incentives to
agriculture for balance-of-payments
reasons should be selective as far as pos-
sible, giving encouragement to those in-
dustries for which we have some degree
of comparative advantage and some pros-
pects of avoiding accumulation of an un-
saleable surplus”.
authors think Australia should be
A able to compete more effectively with
processed materials than with raw mat-
erials in world markets. In this connec-
tion they cite the growing export trade
in wool tops and the interesting experi-
ments recently in establishing factories
in Asia for treating dried milk exported
from Australia. Further particular exam-
ples in the manufacturing sphere would
include industries which use their capi-
tal-intensive manufacturing facilities to
produce components in Australia and
carry out the assembly in Asian centres,
where the labor-intensive operations can
be performed economically.
One searched hard in the report for
new suggestions, ideas to increase ex-
ports, that haven’t been broached before.
They are few and far between. One is
that we should study more closely the
methods used by Japan and Germany to
increase exports and there is a special
appendix on this. Others are that co-
operation between Government and ex-
porters should be re-examined; that mar-
ket study should be on more systema-
tic lines; that we must fill the gap in the
field of private research into product de-
sign, development and testing; and that
the exchange of information and “even
of plans and targets” with other coun-
tries should be considered.
The report covers the grounds on
which the export effort must be made
very adequately. But when you have read
it from cover to cover you are still with-
out the answer to the vital question
whether the efforts it points to will be
successful. You are left in the clouds:
“It is clear that the prospects for ex-
panding export sales are limitless and it
goes without saying that if our exporters
have only scratched the richer strata of
demand in many of the nearer and
richer markets, the potential in the
under-developed nations, not only of
Asia but of Africa and South America
as well, is massive and exciting.”


“CROESUS”
Perils for Monetary Policy
Avoiding a " really explosive " situation
TyiAYBE the need for the “harsh”
measures Dr H. C. Coombs has in
mind for a “really explosive” monetary
situation won't arise this year, but it is
interesting to consider whether such a
situation can be avoided and by what
means. The only thing made clear on
this score in the annua! report of the
Reserve Bank was that Coombs alone
might not be able to hold back the
boom tides. If the economy looked like
being swamped, the Treasurer would
have to come up with fiscal curbs to
back up the Reserve Bank's monetary
measures. It could imply that Dr
Coombs is not all that satisfied the
Treasury has so far pulled its full weight,
vide the Budget for instance, in contain-
ing the speculative forces which are
still thankfully in the background of the
current economic scene. Further, it
raises the question of how far monetary
policy itself can be made effective from
now on.
If we go back to the development of
the last boom here and the “harsh”
measures applied in November, 1960, it
will be recalled that ultimately it was
the Treasurer who did the job of stop-
ping it virtually singlehanded, with the
stiffest of any fiscal strictures to come
from Canberra in peace time. In that
situation, Dr Coombs confined himself
to a few warnings to the private banks to
go easy on their lending and also, in
equally gentlemanly a fashion, to the
fringe financiers to tighten their lending
taps. Apart from these verbal sallies,
monetary policy lay doggo in the crisis,
as it had all through 1960 when timely
rises in interest rates engineered by the
Reserve Bank could just possibly have
saved the Treasury the trouble of toying
with the tax-on-interest and putting on
other crash curbs.
some people would not agree
(say like Mr Ricketson, who for all his
tirades against the Reserve Bank is still
our leading authority on interest rates),
Dr Coombs has made great strides in
the application of monetary policy since
1960. He must get a good deal of the
credit for keeping the speculators at
bay in the highly inflammable liquidity
conditions of the last eighteen months or
more. In fact, over this period, mone-
tary policy has been leading the way
in preventing the development of boom
conditions and hasn’t been getting very
much help from fiscal policy at all.
Moreover, as the Reserve Bank report
says, monetary policy was put to a hard
test last year when, contrary to the usual
experience, strong expansion in the do-
mestic economy was accompanied by
rising liquidity occasioned by a build-up
in overseas reserves.
We will certainly be relying on mone-
tary policy to work another oracle this
year, but understandably the Reserve
Bank’s report doesn't say whether further
increases in interest rates are in prospect.
It has been left to Mr Ricketson to fore-
shadow “a second cycle of monetary
measures in the event of the Govern-
ment considering inflationary pressures
were jeopardising cost and price stabi-
lity”. After a Budget whose increase
in spending seems to have disturbed Dr
Coombs (as it has a lot of other people),
the Reserve Bank must be very worried
about the reduced scope for further in-
creases in interest rates and about the
likely effectiveness of any increases in
the event of internal prices rising more
sharply.
Tn fact, despite the reasonable expec-
A tation that he should be helped by a
drawing-down of overseas reserves and
liquidity this year Dr Coombs himself
now seems to be hinting that the pendu-
lum is swinging against him. His latest
report suggests the Reserve Bank is
concerned not so much about any diffi-
culties arising from surplus liquidity as
about the likely consequences of possible
swings out of liquid assets, and also of
a possible increase in the propensity to
spend. Both these possibilities hold
perils for interest rate policy as well as
for national savings, on which the
structures of the Budget and much else
depends.
Perhaps the threat of these two possi-
bilities is not so imminent, yet it cer-
tainly has to be considered. It will loom
much larger than it looks at the moment
if prices rise more sharply, because
rising prices would tend to weaken both
the preference for liquidity and the pro-
pensity to save. Proportionately stiffer
increases in interest rates would be re-
quired to make monetary policy effective.
In the absence of sharply rising prices,
there is the more immediate point Mr
Ricketson made to shareholders of Sher-
bourne Investments last week, that if the
Government is to succeed in reaching
its £275 million loan raising target this
year it will have to forgo arbitrary
interest rate manipulations such as
recently engineered in the bond market.
There is certainly a lot in this. One has
only to recall the holding-off of many
subscriptions to the undersubscribed May
loan by investors predicting an increase
in bond rate in the following loan. They
proved to be right. Thus, if only on
these considerations, the scope for inter-
est rate movements looks much smaller
than it did last year. With the Govern-
ment’s loan programme at stake, Dr
Coombs could well get a tip-off from
the Treasury to keep bond prices fairly
stable and support them in case of any
weakening.
is not to say that Dr Coombs’
A honeymoon with his new interest rate
bride is necessarily over, only that he
would probably do well to keep bond
prices stable from now on and would
find future increases in interest rates pro-
portionately less effective. There is still
some scope in bank interest rates struc-
ture to seek containment on the side of
new credit creation, though overall, as
yet, there is no strong compulsion for
action in this direction. Bank advances
in July rose less than their ten-year
average increase for that month and do
not look excessive against the back-
ground of record business and industrial
activity.
But bank credit will have to be
watched closely and choked off if neces-
sary by a gentleman’s agreement or
otherwise. As for the fringe financiers,
who are coming more into the picture
with a strong rise of £6 million to a new
record of HP outstandings in July, offi-
cial vigilance will have to tighten.
The latest rise in HP outstandings is
largely a reflection of motor vehicle
registrations’ climb to a new monthly
high in July. Doubtless, if the authorities
regarded the flow of resources into the
motor industry as excessive, they would
have taken more drastic action in the
Budget to get a reduction. The spurt
in HP does not cover the rest of now
more diversified finance company lend-
ing, where hidden dangers for monetary
stability may be lurking.
With effective moves in monetary
policy likely to be prejudiced by the
priority of Government loan raisings
over more general economic considera-
tions and the Budget wrapped but not
sewn up (additions to the defence vote
will almost certainly follow the current
review of requirements) in a loosely in-
flationary package, it is difficult to see in
what direction other than credit restric-
tion the authorities can move in the
event of prices rising more sharply in the
next few months. We can only keep our
fingers crossed that price increases will
be small and that later in the year the
Treasurer will not be forced into excep-
tional measures as he was four years ago.


FINANCE CORPORATION OF
AUSTRALIA LIMITED
(Incorporated in South Australia)
Chairman's Address at the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders held on Tuesday,
25th August, 1964
MR. R. S. TURNER
The Directors’ Report and
Balance Sheet as at June 30,
1964, with supporting Accounts
have informed Shareholders that
the Consolidated Net Profit of
the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the year ended June 30,
1964, was £443,020. This result
is after deduction of Minority
Shareholders’ Interests in one
Subsidiary Company and after
provision of £315,742 for In-
come Tax.
Since the publication of these
results the Federal Treasurer in
his Budget Speech has an-
nounced an increase in Tax
Rates on profits of Public Com-
panies from 8/- to 8/6 in the £l.
Group Tax liability will now be
approximately £20,500 in excess
of the provision made.
The disclosed profit exceeds
that of the previous year,
£380,522, by 16.4% and rep-
resents an earning rate of 18.3%
on average capital employed for
the year.
The recommended final divi-
dend will maintain the rate of
10% per annum, which has
been paid consistently since the
first year of the Company. Thus
profits available cover 1.8 times
the dividend requirement of
£243,782.
Retained profits increase the
Reserves by approximately
£200,000 to £1,198,476. This
will, however, be subject to a
reduction of £20,503 for ad-
ditional Income Tax.
Paid Up Capital increased
during the year to £2,756,663.
An issue of 1,000,000 Ordinary
Shares of 10/- each at par was
made in June, 1964, when 5/-
per share was paid up. The final
instalment of 5/- per share will
be payable on December 1,
1964. A further 11,250 Em-
ployees’ Shares of 10/- each
Were issued during the year to
the Trustees of the Company’s
Staff Superannuation Fund, for
the benefit of Senior Executives.
A total of 47,250 Employees’
Shares have now been issued, on
which unpaid capital amounts to
£16,962.
The number of Stockholders
and Shareholders had grown to
1,453 by June 30, 1964. The
Ordinary Shares are listed for
official quotation on the Stock
Exchanges of all mainland
capital cities and Share Registers
are maintained in those cities.
Net Outstandings—which rep-
resent the amounts owing by
customers, after deduction of
unearned income totalled
£29,377,999 at June 30, 1964,
an increase of 22.2% over the
corresponding figure a year
earlier. Thus the excellent
pattern of growth since 1960/61
the year of the “credit
squeeze”—has been maintained.
Unearned income is included
in certain types of contracts
written by the Company, and
the Provision for Unearned In-
come, £8,036,061 at June 30,
1964, represented 30.1% of the
Outstandings on the relevant
contracts relating to Real Estate
Loans, Leasing, Hire Purchase,
etc. Hire Purchase contracts for
Motor Vehicles and Appliances
constitute only a minor part of
the Company’s business Net
Outstandings were £1,300,210 at
the close of the year. Concentra-
tion on other types of business
has materially assisted the Com-
pany in minimising repossessions
and losses through bad debts.
The Contingency and Doubt-
ful Debts Reserve, which is not
included in Shareholders’ Funds,
but is deducted from the Current
Asset Outstandings, was in-
creased by £65,000 to £365,000.
The relevant Income Tax has
been paid, or provided, in
respect of sums transferred to
this Reserve.
The Company’s Debenture
Issues have again been well
supported by Investors, including
major financial institutions. The
issue currently open has already
attracted applications for more
than £3.5 millions, the largest
issue in the Company’s history.
Over-Subscriptions are still being
accepted.
From time to time the Com-
pany accepts Deposits usually
for shorter periods than are
available on Debenture Issues.
Total Deposits are relatively
static, as Debenture funds are
sought to finance the greater part
of the increase in outstandings.
At June 30, 1964, the Com-
pany had 9,982 Debenture
holders, and 665 Depositors,
and total borrowings were
£28,685,977.
Your Directors have main-
tained their policy of a high
degree of liquidity in the Com-
pany’s assets to ensure that at
all times borrowed moneys can
be repaid when due. At the
latest balance date, the Group
held Cash and Bank Balances,
Deposits and Commonwealth
Government Securities amount-
ing to £2,872,802. A further
£525,369 had been invested in
selected stocks quoted on the
Stock Exchanges, which at June
30, 1964, had a market value of
£638,472. An additional source
of liquidity is cash received from
outstandings. This currently ex-
ceeds £1.5 millions per month.
Outstandings are substantial
in all mainland States. It is
especially pleasing to record the
substantial growth of the
business in our Branches in
Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia, which do not enjoy the
advantages of the Head Office
State of South Australia, or the
greater populations and concen-
tration of business found in New
South Wales and Victoria.
In the past year, we have
expanded our activities through
the opening of a Branch in
Canberra, and by associating
with The Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation
in the establishment of Malaysian
Australian Finance Company
Limited to transact finance
business in Singapore and Kuala
Lumpur.
The demand for the use of
Leasing facilities has enabled
our subsidiary, F.C.A. Leasing
Limited, to show increases in
outstandings in every Branch
office. This trend is expected to
be maintained.
The Company’s association
with The Bank of Adelaide
our largest shareholder, owning
40% of the issued Ordinary
Capital continues to be of
great importance and assistance.
Sir Edward Hayward and Mr.
R. S. Thomson retire in accord-
ance with the Articles of Associa-
tion, but are eligible for re-
election, and offer themselves
accordingly.
Competition between the
Finance Companies remained
very keen during the year under
review. In recent months, the
availability of business, how-
ever, has been at the highest
level in the period of your Com-
pany’s existence. These con-
ditions have made even greater
demands on the Management
and Staff than heretofore. Share-
holders have been well served
by the General Managr, Mr.
A C. Noble, ably assisted by
Mr. K. W. Adcock, Mr. K. C.
Collins and a keen and enthusi-
astic staff at Head Office and in
each State Branch. On behalf of
the Board, and each Member of
the Company, I express our
thanks to the Management and
Staff.
R. S. TURNER
Chairman of Directors.

Sharing in the Building Boom
Sanitaryivare makers see excellent prospects
big upsurge in Australian building
has benefited not only the building
industry but also those which supply the
materials. One industry in particular is
enjoying boom conditions —the sanitary-
ware industry, makers of toilets, baths
and basins.
Two manufacturers The Bulletin
interviewed said they hadn’t had it so
good for ten years; others said that al-
though they could supply the demand, it
was at an unprecedented level. All fore-
cast good trading conditions for the
future.
Figures from the Commonwealth Sta-
tistician show that production of nearly
all PC (prime cost) items is rising. Pro-
duction of toilet pans in 1960-61 stood
at 250,390. By 1962-63 it had risen to
285,840 and for the first 11 months
of 1963-64 267,862 were produced. If
production for June this year is at the
same level as June last year, a new re-
cord will be set.
CIPE (cast iron, porcelain enamel)
bath production also looks like reaching
a new height, with output for the 11
months to May at 70,838 compared with
the full 1962-63 production of 75,455.
Earthenware or vitreous china wash
basin production for the first 11 months
of 1963-64 at 98,932 has already passed
the previous full year’s output of 98,140.
Production of CIPE wash basins, how-
ever, is declining. From an output of
96,800 in 1960-61, it has fallen from
82,794 in 1961-62 to 76,823 in 1962-63.
Production up till May this year totalled
67,431. It is likely that the full year’s
result will be lower than 1962-63.
The shot in the arm the Federal
Government has given the building in-
dustry, with its maximum £250 housing
subsidy to couples under 35 and the
housing loan guarantee corporation
which is expected to become reality
during the present Parliamentary session,
will provide, undoubtedly, expanding
markets for sanitaryware.
A part from the three dull building
years following the credit squeeze,
the level of building activity has been
rising each year. The number of new
houses and flats commenced in 1963-64
was 107,387, a big rise over the previous
year’s 88,269. The number of comple-
tions was 96,608, compared with 87,747,
and those under construction at the end
of the June quarter this year totalled
55,409, compared with 44,630 in the
previous corresponding period.
The big demand for housing is re-
flected in the number of house and flat
approvals granted during the year 1963-
64. They totalled 116,424 compared
with the previous year’s 94,389. It is
hard to gauge the value of office building
to sanitaryware manufacturers since
figures are not compiled, but judging by
the number of office blocks under con-
struction in all capital cities this, too,
would provide a valuable market.
Other factors affecting the industry’s
market are sewerage schemes and pros-
perity. With money relatively freely
available at present, not only building
but renovating and redecorating is more


easily possible now than it has been for
some time.
Figures on pressed steel sanitaryware
are not compiled. An executive of one
company said it represented about 30 to
35 p.c. of the total market. He added it
would grow and that in America it
claimed 45 p.c. of the market. The chief
advantage is price: a sft. 6in. bath in
cast iron and vitreous china costs about
£36, a pedestal basin about £l4 to £2O.
In pressed steel a bath costs about £26
and a basin £7 to £B.
An executive of Mcllwraith Industries
Pty Ltd, a member of the John Mc-
llwraith Industries Ltd group, which
supplies builders’ and plumbers’ requi-
sites, said he was pleased with the extra
demands the increased level of building
activity had placed on his company.
“After the war there was a tremen-
dous demand for all building materials,
everything was in short supply. About
1952 we got away from the quota system
and the industry went ahead at a rapid
pace. The industry must keep modern
to keep pace with the demands home
builders make and for this reason we
are in a position to supply any demand.
“The two and even three bathroom
home is a very important market for our
products. We make different types of
baths and basins which lend themselves
to the dual bathroomed house. There is
also a ready market for them for con-
versions and modernisations.”
Mcllwraith makes only cast-iron por-
celain enamel baths and basins and does
not deal with vitreous china. It also
markets a pressed steel porcelain enamel
bath. It recently introduced to the mar-
ket a new bath, the “Ambassador”,
which, said the executive, is enjoying a
large market.
However, tooling costs limit the num-
ber of styles available. The executive
said the patterns for a bath could cost as
much as £7500, and for a basin £2500.
The popularity of the vanity unit in
Australia provides a large number of
sales for manufacturers, the
executive of Mcllwraith said.
“The supply of basins for these
units is quite a considerable
part of our business. Vanity
tables have taken over to some
extent from pedestal basins and
their importance will continue
to grow.”
The acceptance of the vanity
unit in Australian bathrooms,
says one maker, A. V. Wehl
Ltd, is due to the fact that
they provide much - needed
storage space for bottles, etc.
A. V. Wehl Ltd, through its
subsidiary Plycraft, is making
about 5000 vanity units a year.
“The tendency to vanity units
is growing each year,” said
an executive. “They are
used in new houses as well as for
replacement purposes. Many people
when redecorating bathrooms prefer the
vanity unit to the pedestal basin.”
The executive said the quality of
vanity units had improved since the
1960-61 recession. “There is a move
now towards higher priced and better
quality units which decides the buyer
more to a vanity than to a pedestal
basin.
“W E
we would replacement units. The
new home market today is full of buyers
who would rather have a vanity unit than
the old-style basin and a builder who does
not put in a vanity finds the home hard
to sell. He also finds that during reno-
vation the home-owner will prefer a
vanity unit to a pedestal basin.
“Another reason for the popularity
of vanity units is the more modern think-
ing among Australian home buyers and
builders. This is a trend which has been
imported from America and will eventu-
ally reach the proportions here it has
there,” the executive added.
One of the companies in the vitreous
china sanitaryware field is Doulton Pot-
teries (Australia) Pty Ltd, an offshoot of
the English parent group. It makes
basins and toilet pans and a Doulton
executive described the market as “very
buoyant”.
He claimed that vitreous china had
better qualities than cast-iron porcelain
enamelware. Its impact-resisting quali-
ties were similar —if an object was drop-
ped on vitreous china the china would
crack, but if it were dropped on CIPE
it would chip the enamel leaving it prone
to rust. An impact which would shatter
china would render CIPE unusable.
However, moulds for vitreous china
were cheaper and could be changed at
a lower cost thus giving the manufacturer
a wider range of styles for his products.
Colors in sanitaryware are industry-wide.
Cast-iron Bath Production
Because a home-owener may have both
vitreous china and CIPE in his bath-
room the industry has agreed on a basic
set of colors —seven and white.
The Doulton executive said in Aus-
tralia there was a swing to vitreous china
away from CIPE. This had been caused
by the greater range of styles available
in china and its more attractive wear-
resistant properties. The price difference
between the two media is only shil-
lings. Figures quoted earlier in this
article give a statistical idea of how
CIPE is losing ground to vitreous china
in the basin-production field.
“The sanitaryware business is essen-
tially tied to the building industry—our
index of prosperity is closely related to
theirs. Toilet suites are tied to the
building industry but there is also a
big replacement market. Before the
introduction of vitreous china to Aus-
tralia, basins and toilet suites were made
from earthenware, a product which had
none of the desirable qualities of china.
“It was more brittle, subject to crazing
and in general an inferior product. The
incidence of breakage was high so the
home-owner would naturally seek a
stronger product. Vitreous china was the
answer. It has been in Australia in a
big way now for about six years.
“ A nother thing which has influenced
the upswing in the use of china has
been the expansion of sewerage facili-
ties in Australia. Sewerage extensions
or installations add substantially to our
business.
“Toilet and basins are very much con-
nected in their markets because of this.
The man who gets sewerage will, apart
from buying a toilet suite, also buy a
basin to redecorate his bathroom. The
expansion in Australian building and the
market for sanitaryware has made the
industry amongst the best in the world.”
An executive of Metters
Ltd, wholly - owned subsi-
diary of General Industries
Ltd, said it was impossible to
estimate the value of the re-
placement market to the sani-
tary ware industry. “In days
gone by it used to be 60 p.c.
new and 40 p.c. replacement
but with the advent of vitreous
china and pressed steel no one
could judge now. At any rate
the market is very buoyant.
“We anticipate the market is
going to grow in the next few
years because of the help the
Commonwealth Government
has given the building indus-
try. More modern styling will
help our future,” the executive
added.

Urging Northern Development
The policy and successes of FIDO
The debate on the development of in-
land, and particularly northern, Aus-
tralia is now never very far from public
attention. All sorts of people, not only
economists and civil servants, have
learned to talk vigorously and more in-
formedly about the Ord River (WA)
scheme and such things as the beef roads.
These affairs are manifestly important.
They also win a great deal more official
interest, even action, than they did a
relatively few years ago.
Apart from the opening up of new
enterprises, and sucn matters of principle
as decentralisation and balanced develop-
ment, crucial existing industries are at
stake —mining, sugar, meat, foi example.
If there often seems some difficulty in
drawing governmental gaze away from
the capital cities to these other national
problems, it is no wonder that a host of
private “ginger” groups have arisen to
press their special claims.
One of the most active and persistent
of such groups is the Federal Inland
Development Organisation, with the
catching initial abbreviation FIDO.
Its, inaugural meeting was held at
Bourke (NSW) on April 29, 1960. To
this came representatives of pastoral as-
sociations, the Shires’ Association of
NSW and, significantly, a number of
Federal and State parliamentarians of all
parties.
A goad to overcome what FIDO de-
scribed as “deplorable neglect, public
apathy and political indifference” perhaps
came from the vivid memory that over
one million head of cattle had perished
between Bourke and Darwin between
1958 and 1959.
The organisation has remained largely
non-political, though there were threats
towards the end of 1961 to run Inde-
pendent candidates at elections “unless
the major political parties get on to the
real development of the North in three
years.”
That method has evidently been for-
gotten, since FIDO can well claim to
have seen portion of its aims fulfilled
and a more widespread recognition of
developmental necessities.
But it sticks very firmly to one prin-
ciple at least —Federal responsibility. The
doctrine was again echoed by the then
president, Mr B. P. P. Lewis, at the last
annual meeting: “It does not really matter
whether planning, co-ordination and
priority allocation is in the hands of a
commission, an authority, or a division
of the Department of National Develop-
ment. The essential ingredient is Federal
responsibility, whether the constructing
authority be Federal, State or Local
Government.”
FIDO’s original aims were quite
specific, being well expressed in proposals
put before the first meeting: “The full
development of the north and inland of
Australia, by means of an adequate sys-
tem of roads from Wyndham and Darwin
to the southern States, including the
Pioneer’s Highway from Camooweal to
Bourke, with lateral roads servicing the
Channel country, and linked with Queens-
land railheads; also by the full control of
northern Australian waters, for the pur-
pose of irrigation and guaranteed flooding
of the channels.”
Thus its members are keenly immersed
in the major controversies which have
sprung up around the whole question of
northern development, especially eco-
nomic priorities in relation to the rest of
Australia and the vexed discussions sur-
rounding the relative returns of irrigation
schemes compared with other land de-
velopment projects.
Yet even a multitude of conflicting
forces appear to agree that northern Aus-
tralia must continue to develop. The dif-
ferences occur on the acceleration of an
already proceeding growth.
No one really quarrels with the further
encouragement of the cattle industry
“the industry which above all else has
shown its ability to survive in this area,”
as Professor K. O. Campbell puts it.
Perhaps it is natural, therefore, that
FIDO can report a measure of success
on the road programme. The Federal
Government has become more conscious
of beef-road necessities, however much
partisans must continue to quarrel about
the size of the presently - committed
financial grants.
FIDO believes that the allocations now
cover about half the requirements advo-
cated. There is some satisfaction, as well,
in seeing how the building of beef roads
by States’ Main Road Boards gives a
boost to other MRB operations, such as
re-routing old and surveying new lines of
access to the sources of beef supply.
The pattern of the western Queensland
roads, from the Barkly Highway towards
Bourke, apparently incorporates a goodly
section of the widely publicised Pioneers’
Highway.
Other FIDO successes can be seen in
the formation of a National Water Re-
sources Council, the Northern Division
of the Department of National Develop-
ment, and the constitution of a Com-
mittee of Investigation for Inland Trans-
port.

MARKET POINTERS
A Matter of Sales Vallies
Lend Lease accounts closely scrutinised
sudden wobbling in Lend Lease
shares last week was taken as a
pointer to balance-sheet revelations (re-
leased August 26). But after bouncing
off Bs. 3d. in Sydney, the shares rallied
to 9s. 2d. just before publication of the
annual accounts, which showed a 12.9
p.c. earning rate against 16.7 p.c. in the
previous term.
Of major interest to shareholders at
the moment is how to treat the write-off
of £250,000 on the lightweight aggregate
plant, which is claimed to have no bear-
ing on the 1963-64 year’s trading. It is
still a write-off against reserves and re-
duces the assets backing accordingly.
If the write-off of £250,000 had been
made against the current profits, the
stated net result would have fallen to
£234,924, or £ 140,840 less than the
10 p.c. dividend requirement.
★ ★ *
Tt also was unfortunate that in this
leaner year for Lend Lease it was
necessary to provide an extra £26,221
for tax underprovided in a previous year
—a small item, perhaps, which could
have been overlooked in a buoyant year
but nevertheless a further nibble at
reserves.
To finance its ventures, the group
increased its debenture commitment from
£7 to £8,394,625, while also in-
creasing its mortgage outstandings from
£989,879 to £1,665,441. A further
£640,000 in mortgage loans will be re-
ceived before September 30, but up to
June 30, 1964, long-term liabilities had
increased by £874,052, current liabilities
had increased by £671,966 (including tax
adjustment), and current assets had gone
down by £791,386 a general indi-
cation of tighter trading, with the bulk
of these funds absorbed by investments
in land and buildings (up to £1,093,891)
and debtors (up £1,897,890). Fixed
assets increased by just over £lm.,
meaning plant and freehold used in the
group’s operating activities.
★ ★ ★
T>ROperty investments of more than
£lom. are divided into two sections.
Investments in projects currently being
developed or held for sale total
£6,702,395 and are valued at net cost,
including interest and development
expenses.
Inevitably, these property investments
come under close scrutiny in the light of
previous experiences of other developers.
But the balance sheet clearly states that
the £6.7m. valuation is less amounts
written off to contain the aggregate
value at or below anticipated total sales
revenue.
A further item of £3.5m. in land and
buildings is classed as long-term invest-
ment, meaning property and leasehold
improvements being held for investment
income. The bulk of this item is in
NSW, valued at VG for the freehold at
£980,925 plus additions at cost, mainly
comprising Top Ryde extensions and
Compass Centre, £l.9m.
It is true that several of the £6.7m.
current project units are let, pending
sale, including Blues Point Towers and
Ithaca Gardens, Sydney, and Domain
Park and Lansell Road, Melbourne;
while £2im. is tied up in retail projects
around Sydney. So a great deal of
importance must atfach to what the com-
pany means when it speaks of containing
the aggregate value at or below antici-
pated sales revenue. If the final sales
figure is below anticipations, there could
be some write-offs. And, on current
disclosed earning rate, the market is
entitled to be cautious.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Osti Off to a Flying Start
Upward earning trend may lead to scrip shortage
Asti Holdings Ltd, Sydney manu-
” facturer of lingerie and dresses, is
taking advantage of the latest technical
improvements in knitting machines, and
is boosting its fabric production to five
million square yards per annum.
It has always held a strong position
in the knitwear business. From infor-
mation gathered at a recent Press con-
ference in Sydney, managing director
Frank Theeman is confident of gaining
an even larger slice of the market.
Preliminary results for 1963-64 show
that earning rate jumped from 24.4 p.c.
to 37.2 p.c. after £48,344 depreciation
(£45,974) and £11,981 tax —first pro-
vision for three years because of buying
two tax loss companies.
The profit was struck after writing off
£33,000, which was the cost of the first
tax-loss company acquired.
There remains a further £182,000 in
tax losses to offset current earnings, thus
placing the company in a happy position
for 1964-65.
Production capacity is being strained
to meet current orders. This is the news
investors want to hear. Orders in hand
for the current six months are consider-
ably higher than for the corresponding
period of last year and ten additional
warp looms will be installed before the
end of 1964.
By widening its fabric range, it
appears that knitters like Osti must be
eating into the weavers’ field. Judged on
the acceptance obviously accorded to its
products, Osti seems all set for further
additional expansion.
Although originally criticised for using
share capital to acquire its first tax-loss
company, Osti has used retained profits
to good purpose. It paid cash for its
second takeover and, at the present high
earning rate, is building up strong re-
serves.
It plans to take over a closely associ-
ated customer which is relatively under-
capitalised, and is using several thousand
yards of Osti materials a month.
The whole picture is one of rapid ex-
pansion, encouraged by rising sales.
Knitting machines work about 21 hours
a day and the dye house operates for
24 hours a day, Mr Theeman says.
As everyone knows, long production
runs are the most profitable. If Osti
reaches its planned target of £3 J million
to £4 million in the next two years, Mr
Theeman may be justified in claiming
that his company’s shares are worth 225.
to 255., particularly if the profit ratio
is maintained.
The company has proved it does not
need to worry about import competi-
tion. Also, it already enjoys an export
trade which can be expanded if it wishes.
Future prospects include the manu-
facture of outerwear, laces, fish nets,
curtain netting and even woollen suitings
mixed with synthetics.
If the company’s ordinary share capi-
tal remains in its present compact form
of £550,000 (25 p.c. of which is held
by institutions) the upward trend in earn-
ing rate could produce a scrip shortage
on the market.
Even after writing off £63,000 for the
cost of two tax-loss companies, reserves
would be £313,006, with further' sub-
stantial additions predicted this year (but
subject to £71,875 intangibles).
For a company which claims to have
such a flying start for 1964-65, the ss.
shares, yielding over 5 p.c., should be
a lock-away proposition.
Wariness Called For
Tn discussing the meagre 9.8 p.c. earn-
A ings for 1963-64, Pendene directors
say the result was influenced by recent
acquisitions and developments which,
although they lost money on the year,
show potential for profitability in the
future. The company is based in Mel-
bourne, as a printer and stationer mainly
Directors must indeed have great con-
fidence in the future profitability of these
projects. A 10 p.c. dividend will be
paid for the year, despite the fact that
it is uncovered. Such was the case in
1963, too, when earnings were a mere
9.7 p.c. However, a capital profit of
£2632 this year means that reserves will
not suffer by the payout. Nevertheless,
a dangerous policy is being pursued
where wariness should be the keynote.
Doubts on Drug Houses’ Tax
A lthough it won’t be much consola-
tion for shareholders,- the directors
of Drug Houses are to be warmly con-
gratulated for their progress reporting on
the 1963-64 year. Because of this, the
colossal profit slump from £971,000 to
£763,000 came as no great surprise. It
is probably greater than that expected by
the more optimistic investors, however.
The 1963 annual accounts and last
January's interim report both pointed
out the difficulties and clouded outlook
which the company was faced with.
And last week's announcement indicated
that the factors which reduced profits
in 1963-64 were likely to persist in the
current year. A statement such as this

shows a high degree of responsibility,
especially when the latest 1H p.c. divi-
dend is very sparsely covered by the
year’s earnings of a mere 12.8 p.c.
Now there is considerable doubt in
some circles as to whether the latest
earning rate will actually cover the divi-
dend. The extremely low tax provision,
for which directors gave no explana-
tion, has led many to think that a
degree of window-dressing has been done
by the company in order to create the
picture of a covered dividend. The tax
is only £366,000 on the 21 p.c. lower
profit of £763,000. Last year it was
£666,000 on the £971,000 earned. In
other words, tax is £300,000 lower,
although profit has fallen back only
£208,000. These figures do not line up,
especially as company tax rates have
risen, thanks to the latest Budget.
Of course, explanations may be found.
Expenditure on the integration of the
manufacturing activities may have crea-
ted investment allowances to reduce the
tax liability. Then again, tax-free divi-
dend income, such as that from Cynamid
DBA, may also provide some explana-
tion. It is up to directors to furnish
the reasons for the low tax provision
at the annual meeting or in the accounts.
This tax question could be vital next
year if earnings are to cover even a
10 p.c. dividend. If it has been dressed
up this year, then the effects could be
drastic on 1964-65 performance. If such
is not the case, then further capital ex-
penditure will have to be made to get
the benefits of investment allowance or,
alternatively, a heavy loss company
could be taken over. Such moves cannot
go on forever, however, and eventually
a full tax liability will be payable. Un-
less a rejuvenation of profits has occurred
by such time, Drug Houses may be in
more trouble than it is now.
Provincial Largesse
Provincial Traders Holding's
coming issue was probably not un-
expected. Though shareholders will
have to wait until “early next year”, they
can be thoroughly gratified at the par
basis.
For the ss. shares are at present sell-
ing close to 18s. 6d., not far off a 1964
peak of 19s. 3d. The yield on the 10 p.c.
dividend paid since 1960 stands at 2.7
p.c., a measure of considerable market
esteem. Earnings yield, on 1962-63
figures, is a strong 8.1 p.c.
The dividend does not seem likely to
go down after the issue. Directors have
already announced its retention for
1963-64, on top of profits “comparable
with the record results -achieved last
year”.
The annual report, due in October,
will give full details of the issue. Mean-
while there is news of considerable
trading progress, despite increased com-
petition. Looking at the retail trade as
a whole, directors sight more intense
competition for the group's main food
lines.
“However, they believe that the ex-
pansion of the last few years, which will
continue, will help to counter this,” a
preliminary statement confidently re-
marks.
The Queensland-based group extends
widely over food products, broiler
chickens (the largest business in Austra-
lia), grazing and farming products, stock
feeds, and even into hardware and
plumbing. It is interesting to observe
that Provincial’s last earning rate is
above those of Mauri Bros and Marrick-
ville Holdings, two very well traded
food stocks.
Comfortable-looking Fler
/Considering the high 1963-64 building
activity, the result from Fler for the
year to June 30 appears rather mediocre.
The company is a well-known furniture


manufacturer. Profit rose from £26,000
to £30,000 to almost maintain earnings
at around 17 p.c. after a higher prefer-
ence dividend deduction. Sales rose only
6 p.c. —to £l.l million. Dividend will
again be 10 p.c., the rate paid since
1960-61 listing.
Two factors combine to indicate a
much better result in the current year.
Firstly, the fact that profits in the first
six months of the year were 9 p.c.
lower than previously. To achieve a lift
to £30,000 in the final analysis shows
that a considerably better performance
reigned in the last six months. Second,
one must not forget that the effect of
a building boom on furniture demand
would come well after the houses, etc.,
were built.
This explains why business was so
much better in the second half and
augurs well for the current year, as well
as 1965-66, if the present rate of build-
ing continues. Housing completions
have only just started to rise strongly
and directors predict an increase in the
marriage rate soon, too.
The firm is well prepared for any on-
slaught of demand. Earlier this year
£40,000 in preference shares was
privately placed (redeemable 1974) to
provide extra working capital. Some
ranges have been extended and, in SA,
factory extensions have been completed.
Hardware Possibilities
ITardware Holdings’ bumper 1963-64
year turns one's thoughts rather
sharply to share issue possibilities. The
time could not be better. Sales, profits,
earning rate and dividend are all records
for the company. A cash raising could
probably be well employed in the 1964-
65 year if the current activity in the
building industry continues.
The last issue was one-for-four at par
in 1960-61 and the only other was made
on the same basis in 1955-56. The com-
pany operates from Melbourne as a
hardware merchant, steel supplier and
engineer for industry generally and the
building trade. One lot of subsidiaries
manufactures and sells a range of taps
tor bathrooms and kitchens.
In the latest year, these activities gave
.an earnings rate of 33.1 p.c. to more
than twice cover the 15 p.c. dividend.
Last year they were 25.2 p.c. to give a
similar cover for the 124 p.c. dividend
paid since 1955. At balance date last
year reserves of £630,000 came close
to topping the £640,000 paid capital.
Bonus prospects will now be even bigger
because reserves will exceed this sum
considerably. Assets have not been re-
valued since listing either.
Of course the thorn in all this theory
is the fact that dividends have been
lifted. This is an unusual practice if
any issue is being contemplated, as it is
all the harder to maintain on any in-
creased capital. Still, all is not lost.
Possibly, the move reflects great con-
fidence in future ability to pay, even on
higher capital. More likely, though, the
fact that the extra 24 p.c. was termed
“bonus” by directors could indicate that
an issue is in the wind, after which divi-
dends will return to the normal 121 p.c.
Cambridge Conservative
the surface, the 5 p.c. profit rise to
£227,635 by Cambridge Credit Cor-
poration Ltd looks well enough, even
though earning rate on higher average
capital drifts back from 17.2 to 15.25
p.c. Yet the entire advance was given
by a lower tax need, deriving from tax
losses and joint-company dividends.
Directors had previously announced
their intention of reducing the dividend
from a long-held 121 p.c. to 10 p.c., so
that move came as no surprise. They
sensibly and realistically see the advan-
tage of building up reserves.
Some available funds were not put to
possible use so that maturing debentures
could be safely met. In the event, a
high renewal rate made the precaution
excessive, but profitability was necessarily
lowered.
Engaged more in the less vulnerable
house mortgage business, Cambridge has
soft-pedalled on the hire-purchase side
and therefore should have fewer pro-
blems with debtors’ ledgers. This is a
decided advantage to shareholders when
large write-offs are so fashionable.
The ss. shares hover around 6s. 6d.,
slightly under a 1964 best at 6s. 9d.
Quarrymasters’ Quandary
\ lbion Quarries and Reids’ Quarries,
both Melbourne-based, announced
substantial profit increases for their
1963-64 year last week —Albion up
from £154,000 to £250,000 and Reids’
up from £92,000 to £109,000. Albion’s
dividend is rising from 10 p.c. to 124 p.c.
and Reids’ will be maintained at 10 p.c.
Although the results will no doubt be
gratifying to shareholders, they are not
particularly brilliant. They represent re-
covery, not improvement. Moreover,
the recovery is incomplete, following the
extremely heavy setbacks of last year
when deadly competition and price-
cutting, sometimes to below cost, chop-
ped huge hunks off profits.
Albion’s earning rate represents 18.6
p.c. on ordinary capital, compared with
11.5 p.c. last year. It is still way below
the 22.1 p.c. earned in 1962 and even
further behind the 26.3 p.c. and 23.2 p.c.
of 1960 and 1961. The lift in dividend
to 12i p.c. still gives shareholders a
smaller distribution than the 15 p.c.
paid in 1960, 1961 and 1962.
Of course the one-for-two bonus issue
made in 1959-60 helps add some glow to
this uninspiring performance. But it is
now four years since that capital move
and results are still historically low.
The Reids’ Quarries performance is
even poorer, although shareholders have
not had any dividend cut despite the
setbacks. It has been 10 p.c. every year
since 1960. The cover is still scant,
though the latest earnings improved
from 10.4 p.c. to 11.9 p.c. The recovery
this represents is even worse than
Albion's. In 1962, the rate was 19.6
p.c. after coming back from 24.6 in
1961. In 1960 it was 19.5 p.c.
Shareholders’ pockets may not have
suffered quite as much in this case,
because dividend has never been cut and
there have been two issues since 1-960.
In 1960-61 there was a bonus made on
the same terms as Albion’s 1959-60
issue, in 1963, a one-for-five issue
of ss. ordinaries, with 7s. 6d. premium,
left some capital gain for shareholders.
Nevertheless, these issues have been a
big factor in reducing earnings to a level
which does not cover dividends very
safely.
Builder’s Bonus
Sydney building contractor Paynter
and Dixon Industries Ltd is to mark
its most successful year with a one-for-
three bonus —the second in four years.
Following the record profit of
£142,546 (a rise of 11 p.c.), directors
plan to raise issued capital to £508,385
and pay a 15 p.c. dividend —equal to
20 p.c. on pre-issue capital.
The company’s last issue was in
October, 1960, when it handed out two
shares for five held. It joined the Stock
Exchange list in 1957, so shareholders
who have stuck with it have been well
rewarded. The shares are currently
selling at around 295. 3d., where they
yield 3.1 p.c.

lengthy stay at 124 p.c. Things appeared
rather grim when the latest year's interim

was cut to 4 p.c. hinting at an 8 p.c.
yearly rate.
Actual profit for 1963-64, at £542,623,
showed a £143,844 advance. Earning
rate does not especially thrill at 12.3
p.c. However, directors are able to state
that the better rate of sales and profit
has also been visible since June.
Bradford's great strength in a healthy
textile industry would come from its
technical modernity, which the chair-
man, Sir Robert Webster, warmly de-
fended at the last annual meeting. His
remarks on such matters as the tariff
and overseas competition will be keenly
examined when he speaks again.
Reward from Brambles
T>rambles Industries’ directors did
■*"* not take very long after reporting
an excellent 1963-64 profit to come up
with a bonus issue the group’s first
and to be made on a one-for-three
basis. The capacious share premium
reserve, which in the 1963 accounts
stood at £2,286,766, provides the source.
A thoroughly contemporary technique
will bring the traditional 20 p.c. divi-
dend, paid since 1959, back to a post-
bonus 15 p.c., so that shareholders
receive only the same income for a time
at least.
Nevertheless, investors don’t seem to
have minded that move unduly. They
have lifted the ss. shares to 255. 6d.,
above this year's previous top at 245. 3d.
These levels are distinctly higher than
1963’s best of 20s.
The shares certainly deserve attention
for a still favorable yield and continued
prospects of growth. Brambles’ recently
accomplished reorganisation, involving
withdrawal from some operations and
the selling of certain assets, came after
a period of some rather heady take-
overs. The company now looks much
more shipshape, with its range of trans-
port services broadly able to take
advantage of present booming demands.
Naughty But Nice
/"|ne sincerely hopes that Noske In-
dustries is not making a vain attempt
to restore dividends to the buoyant 1960
level. Despite a profit fall from £173,000
to £167,000 in the latest year, the pay-
out is to be lifted from 10 p.c. to 11 p.c.
Following the 1961 one-for-three par
issue, earnings came back to 14 p.c. and
the dividend to lli p.c. A catastrophic
crash in 1962 reduced earnings to a
microscopic 1.9 p.c., yet the dividend
only came back to 6i p.c., uncovered.
Last year a substantial recovery to 19.9
p.c. permitted a 10 p.c. distribution to
shareholders.
Although the minor 1964 setback
covers the new 11 p.c. payout with
safety, the dividend lift still seems to be
a rather unusual move.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Seven Fat Years for Metals?
EZ Industries in a cyclical situation
A week or two ago the price of EZ
Industries Ltd shares again reached
265. 3d., the high price of 1960. At
these levels, the dividend yield is only
3.8 p.c. if the company only pays Is. per
share and a 10 p.c. increase in the divi-
dend would still mean that the yield is
historically low. But over the last twelve
months, it has certainly been a capital
gains stock. From the beginning of July,
1963, through to November, the shares
could have been purchased below 18s.,
and probably much nearer to 17s. A
50 p.c. capital increase is not unattrac-
tive.
The share price, however, has un-
doubtedly been stimulated by the rapidly
rising prices for zinc and by the news of
the shortages of fertilisers and the boun-
ties thereon. It will, therefore, be inter-
esting to examine the position (as well
as a layman can) to try to decide
whether the stock can be purchased now
for the long term or whether the “specu-
lative” element is such that a long-term
investor should wait for the price to
come back.
While EZ Industries at Risdon pro-
duces cadmium and also superphosphate
and sulphate of ammonia, it cannot be
denied that the main product is high
grade refined zinc. It would appear that
zinc probably represents 80 p.c. of the
“sales” of Risdon. From the well pre-
sented annual reports, it is possible to
trace not only the geographical distribu-
tion of sales but also the prices over the
years in Australia, UK and USA. The
following table shows in percentage form
the destination of sales:
Year to Austra-
June 30 lia NZ USA India UK Other
1957 64 1 11 15 8 1
1958 71 1 3 20 3 2
1959 63 1 5 18 7 6
1960 73 1 2 11 8 5
1961 73 2 17 3 5
1962 46 2 2 12 20 18
1963 34 2 9 39 16
These figures indicate that when the
Cockle Creek plant of the Sulphide
Corporation came into production in the
latter half of the 1961 calendar year,
EZ Industries had to look to overseas
markets to take up quite a sizeable pro-
portion of its output. Very roughly one
could say that exports had to be doubled.
At that stage the prospects of sales to the
United Kingdom were somewhat clouded
by the negotiations on the Common
Market. These factors, coupled with
others, almost certainly had the effect of
depressing the share price quite markedly
at the end of 1961 and the last sale in
November (the annual general meeting
was held on November 28 that year)
was 13s.
Fortunately, judging by the percentage
of sales directed to the UK in the fol-
lowing years, the Common Market nego-
tiations failed but the substantial increase
in exports sold to the UK coincided with
depressed zinc prices on the London
Metal Exchange. The following table
shows the trend of the average annual
price of “good ordinary brand” zinc on
an index basis, using the 1956-57 average
price as a base = 100.
Year to
June 30 London USA
1957 100.0 100.0
1958 71.1 76.1
1959 76.3 82.8
1960 95.2 94.0
1961 90.0 92.5
1962 76.4 88.7
1963 74.1 87.5
So far as the 1963-64 year is con-
cerned, it would seem that the average
price of zinc will reach the 1956-57
levels. As the increase seems to have
been fairly steady throughout most of
the year, it seems that a 35 p.c. improve-
ment can be expected on the revenue
received from London sales, even if only
the same amount was sold to London.
It is probable that the increase in revenue
overall will be greater, because firstly
a larger proportion of the output could
have gone to London, secondly the Aus-
tralian price formerly pegged at £AIOO
per ton has been freed to vary with
LME prices, and thirdly the premiums
on high grade and special high grade zinc
would have increased.
It therefore seems fairly certain that
profits for the 1963-64 year will be
“substantially higher” than in recent
years, as the interim report indicated in
respect of the first 28 weeks of the year.
As the chairman pointed out in his last
report, the upward trend in zinc prices
has been brought about by an overall
strengthening in demand and, despite the
emergence of a new Canadian producer
with a capacity to supply at least 70,000
tons of high grade zinc, the demand for
EZ's product exceeds the company’s
capacity to supply.
Prognostications about the future
trends in world demand are clearly a
matter for the producers and any ama-
teur can only be guessing. It seems that
the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group estimated record levels for 1963
and considered that a further increase in
1964 was likely. So far as EZ is con-
cerned, it appears that it could have to
market about 90,000 tons of zinc over-
seas. This suggests that in the future it
will be much more sensitive to over-
seas demand than it has been in the past.
Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out
that over the five years from 1956-57 to
1960-61 inclusive, when it was supplying
the bulk of its zinc to the home market,
the Australian price was lower than the
LME and New York prices.
Guesswork as to the extent that in-
creasing usage of aluminium, for exam-
ple, will affect the demand for zinc is
also hazardous—6s p.c. of Australian
consumption of zinc is in galvanising and
it does seem that metals such as alumi-
nium and copper could make inroads
into this area.
To date, the impression created is that
of a cyclical situation rather than a
growth situation. This leaves the pro-
blem of the price that should be paid
for a stock of EZ Industries calibre.
Last April, in a detailed study of the
company, a leading Sydney firm of stock-
brokers suggested that, at 21s. 6d., the
shares were attractive because the divi-
dend yield on a 10 p.c. rate would be
4.6 p.c. and over 5 p.c. if the rate went
to 11 p.c. Per share earnings were anti-
cipated to be of the order of Is. Bd. per
share. While the firm did not make this
point, the earnings yield would then be
approximately li p.c. from the price
of 21s. 6d.
Looking at the position over the last
seven years, one could say that a good
average price for this stock would have
been around 18s. to show a dividend
yield from a 10 p.c. dividend of 6 p.c.
and an earnings yield of about 7i p.c.
However, it could be that we are moving
into the “seven fat years” so far as
metal prices are concerned. This could
mean substantially improved results for
EZ Industries and almost certainly
greater dividends for shareholders.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
The Fruits of Expansion
Finance Corporation still growing
In the ten years since it turned public,
Finance Corporation of Australia
Ltd has fared extraordinarily well. Based
in Adelaide, the company is one of the
more highly regarded financiers, thanks
partly to a 40 p.c. shareholding which
the Bank of Adelaide maintains. At
present, operations are carried on through
17 subsidiaries —14 incorporated in SA,
two in WA and one in Victoria.
However, the concentration on SA is
not quite as marked as these figures indi-
cate. Many subsidiaries run branch
offices in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane,
Perth and just last January a Canberra
branch was added to the list. As if this
wide spread of business is not enough,
the company is also setting up shop in
Malaysia. The Malaysian Australian
Finance Co. is being established with a
capital equivalent to £150,000 —FCA
will contribute 45 p.c. of this, the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. 30
p.c., and Malaysian investors will be
offered the remaining 25 p.c.
The venture will undertake the type of
financing successfully developed by FCA
in Australia. Briefly, this covers six main
fields—real estate finance for homes,
home sites, home improvements, flat and
home unit projects, property develop-
ment and sub-division activity; leasing, of
industrial and commercial equipment and
motor vehicles; discounting, on mort-
gages and contracts of sale; business
loans; hire purchase; and, finally, per-
sonal loans.
Despite this range of business and the
extensive geographical area which the
company covers, its home State has still
been the basic provider of stability and
expansion. Being an SA financial leader
and the only local financier with bank-
backing, local business naturally flows
straight to it. Once this flow reached
a relatively static state, the interstate
moves started in earnest in an effort to
expand. At home, diversification into
new fields of finance was used to achieve
expansionary goals too.
Perhaps the commencement of regular
shareholders’ issues in 1958 and the
takeover of Automobile Finance in that
same year (SA-based) heralded the start
of the expansive growth in recent years.
In 1960, the industrial equipment leasing
subsidiary was started and in 1961 Way-
mouth Motor Co. (SA-based) was taken
over. All these moves, and the increasing
interstate business, increased lending
volume no end. In 1960, net outstand-
ings were £13.1 million and at June 30
last they were £29.4 million. Over the
same period, total borrowings have risen
from £12.1 million to £28.7 million. Net
assets, or shareholders’ funds, have mul-
tiplied from £1.2 million to £4 million.
So long as lending still increases at
such a spectacular rate, FCA will con-
tinue to call on shareholders for more
funds. It cannot go on lending more
unless this is done, because debenture
capital must not exceed six times share-
holders’ funds nor four-fifths of current
assets, whichever is lowest. To keep
within these boundaries, five issues have
been made since 1958, all at par, all
raising capital by £500,000: 1958, one-
for-one; 1960, one-for-two; 1961, one-
for-three; 1963, one-for-four; April, 1964,
one-for-five.
Despite this rapid expansion, earning
rates have been maintained between 18
p.c. and 20 p.c. over the whole period.
Dividends have always been 10 p.c. The
Bank of Adelaide has maintained its
40 p.c. interest. This has created the
rather amusing position where, eventu-
ally, its interest could be worth more
than its own capital. Once this latest
issue is fully paid for, FCA's capital will
be more than £3 million, the bank’s
£1.75 million. Already, almost half of
the bank’s profits come from FCA.
The next call for capital should be
within two years and, on all indications,
it will be a one-for-six at par 10s. This
would raise another £500,000, lifting paid
capital to more than £3.5 million. With
the rapid expansion going on in the Aus-
tralian economy, the issue could well
come within a year. When it does, the
bank will hold £1.4 million of the figure
and will have taken another step toward
its own £1.75 million capital.
FCA originally swung into the public
limelight with a capital of only £500,000.
This has now been multiplied six times.

In effect, the offspring has now outgrown
its own parent. Or, to give the situation
another twist, one could echo a comment
made in The Bulletin of March 28:
“The child has become the father of the
man.’’
What, then, of the future? In the short
run, the trend seems to be pretty clear.
The company can undoubtedly see fur-
ther expansionary opportunities, inter-
state and possibly overseas. This will, of
course, mean more borrowing and lend-
ing, and more issues to shareholders.
These should see steady 10 p.c. dividends
and the 18 p.c. to 20 p.c. earning rates
for some time yet. Expansion may not
be as spectacular as that since 1960, but
it will be clearly discernible.
Only by studying the balance sheets
annually will one be able to ascertain if
the company has reached its “optimum ’.
It could well go on expanding widely
every year, depending on policy and the
ingenuity of directors. A study of the
profit, gross outstandings and total bor-
rowings every year should give a fair
indication of whether expansion is slow-
ing to any great extent. As the table
shows, there has been little sign of
any slow-up during the ’sixties.
Once expansion does slow down, the
end of the company's history as a capital
growth stock will not necessarily be at
hand. Already reserves have been climb-
ing rapidly and the ex-dividend profit
surplus has been higher every year. If
reserves continue to grow at recent rates,
the company will be extremely “bonus
prone” by the time it reaches any “opti-
mum” of performance.
In the meantime, the shares should be
really good buying at the current
255. 3d., if one can leave them in a port-
folio for three to five years. Another
issue in the near future, or some sudden
flurry, could very well yield a sizeable
capital profit sooner than expected.
Historically, the price is not really high
and it yields from the dividend a fair
4 p.c.
The summarised balance sheet
shows in hard figures the full extent of
growth in recent years. Working capital
figures do little to reflect true liquidity
when calculated in the normal manner
for a financier but, in this case, they at
least reflect the colossal growth in current
assets as compared with the lesser in-
crease in current liabilities. As regards
FCA’s future commitments and liquidity,
the following figures for the consolidated
group prove more valuable. All inter-
company indebtedness within the group
has been excluded. The position is
healthy.
Period £ Receivable £ Payable
0-2 years 21,956,291 13,835,891
2—5 years 10,367,861 6,842,808
5+ years 8,395,037 8,667,504
£40,719,189 £29,346,203
The growth in fixed assets has been
good but patchy. This is of little conse-
quence, as such assets are relatively un-
important to a financier. The increasing
figure for investments reflects a certain
extra degree of stability for profits in
future years, especially if the figure rises.
The faster growth in loan capital over
paid capital reflects the company's grow-
ing business and may provide some
grounds for further paid capital increases
if earnings could be kept up once such
moves were made.
Summing up, a stock showing a barely
reasonable dividend yield but offering
good capital growth prospects over the
next three years and possibly quite
spectacular growth if kept in a portfolio
for longer. There is also a chance of an
early rise in the market price if another
issue is rumored earlier than expected.
There is little chance of seeing dividends
or earning rates rise any appreciable de-
gree as long as the firm keeps expanding
at its present rate.
CASBEN PRODUCTIONS LTD
A Battle for Sales
Casben Productions Ltd has taken
serious stock of itself after two
years of steadily declining profits fol-
lowed by two heavy losses. The com-
pany is undertaking a severe rationalisa-
tion of production as a possible solution
of its ills.
The losses in 1962-63 and 1963-64
were both caused by incorrect assess-
ment of the market, resulting in a very
heavy carryover stock at the end of the
year, which had to be sold at a loss or
heavily discounted.
Despite hopeful signs early in the
1963-64 year that the previous year’s
losses would not be repeated, operations
did not proceed as anticipated. Orders
for fashion goods were received too late
to permit planned production. The
company was again forced to manufac-
ture for stock.
Sales for the first six months were
excellent. Then a setback occurred, with
repeat business in November and
December not coming up to budget
expectations.
This resulted in a sales fall, leaving
excess stocks of piecegoods and manu-
factured garments on hand. Some of
these were cleared at a loss. All redun-
dant stock at the end of the year was
written down.
As a result, deficit for the 12 months
to April was £30,843 —better than the
deficit of £44,497 recorded in the pre-
vious year. Nevertheless, it lifted accu-
mulated losses to £54,375.
Last profit was £23,511, earned in
1961-62, or only a little more than half
the record £43,874 earned two years
earlier.
The company's profit history has been
subject to fairly wide fluctuations since
it obtained stock exchange listing in
1951, when 160,000 ss. shares were
placed with the public at 7s. 6d. plus
charges. Capital at this stage was
£llO,OOO.
Since then there have been two cash
issues—a one-for-four at par in 1954
and a year later a one-for-two also at
par.
Paid-up capital at last balance date
stood at £234,250, made up of 825,000
ordinary ss. shares and £28,000 in 6 p.c.
preference shares held by the MLC.
These preference shares are redeemable
at the annual rate of £2000:
The reserve position is still good
However, the last two losses have re-
duced assets backing of each ss. share

were written out of the books in 1961.
Accounts for the latest year to April
30 show that the company’s liquid posi-
tion has declined further.
Overdraft was up from £162,958 to
£198,103, while loans on mortgage,
which first appeared in the accounts in
1963, are up from £6362 to £14,931.
Stock is up from £351,193 to
£387,990, the highest point for more
than six years, while trade debtors are
down from £106,714 to £74,895.
Fixed assets are virtually unchanged at
£172,571 despite the closing of small
plants at Weston, near Newcastle, and
Wollongong. Operations are now con-
fined to plants in Cessnock and Sydney,
which should result in a number of
economies.
Efforts are now being directed to im-
proving liquidity and rationalising pro-
duction, rather than continuing the past
policy of carrying a wide range of high
fashion lines.
The chairman (Mr W. A. Casben) says
that the company will continue to pro-
vide the market with novelties and still
aim to be fashion leaders. However,
greater attention will be directed towards
popular-priced merchandise produced
on a basis of quantity, quality and good
value.
This should reduce the risk of a large
carryover of fashion stocks at the end
of the season, with the resultant adverse
effect on earnings. The effect must take
some considerable time to become
apparent in the company's earnings.
In the meantime, the market has
priced the shares at around 2s. 3d., only
a little above the year’s low point. At
this level they appear to have long-term
recovery prospects with an element of
speculation.
The company is recognised as a leader
in its field. With the shares so much
below the assets backing, it must be
vulnerable to a takeover.
Tableland far from Tinny
XTigh world metal prices have benefited
yet another mining company —■
Tableland Tin Dredging N.L. which, in
the year to June 30, turned a loss of
£10,531 into a record profit of £131,661.
The excellent result was helped by
the company's move into what it calls
“the higher value ground of Finches
area”, where it started dredging in
February this year.
The latest result was arrived at after
providing £9658 for depreciation (last
year £4589) and £93,000 for tax (nil).
Dividends take a fair slice of the profit
with £12,800 for two years’ arrears on
the preferences and a total of £55,000
on the ordinaries. Payout on the
ordinaries (interim Is. tax-free, final
Is. 6d., of which Is. is tax-free) rep-
resents 12i p.c.
Out of remaining profits, £4OOO has
been diverted to the preference share-
holders’ reserve and £50,000 to a pro-
vision for property development.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The Profits Keep Tumbling Out
Sophisticated adjustments are called for
As the 1963-64 profits keep tumbling
out, a quick adjustment has to be
made to one’s thinking of each company.
Some of the announcements have been
extraordinarily good. Probably the re-
sult that amazes me most is Burns Con-
solidated. From a run-down structure
there has emerged one of the most dy-
namic companies on the Stock Exchange.
What is frustrating was my inability to
recognise the potential of this company
a year or two ago.
The good results, of course, have been
balanced out by the bad. Deposit and
Investment has probably been the most
notable share fall. From a high of 10s.
this year the shares are now just over the
4s. mark. Could this be another type of
Limbo and its “How low can you go?”
Then we had Drug Houses. The divi-
dend commitment was only just covered
by the lower profits. In fact, if the taxa-
tion provision is any guide, the dividend
rate of 11 £ p.c. was actually above the
true earning rate. An unexpected result
such as this often knocks too much off a
share price. Such being the case, the
first sale in Drug Houses could well have
been 355. However, the market adopted
a more sophisticated attitude than usual.
The opportunity of a quick profit (or,
perhaps, a delayed loss) did not arise.
Instead, my first purchase this week
was Eric White. Apart from the inter-
im report published some months ago, its
situation has not altered since I bought
the shares at 15s. 6d. in the first week
of trading early this year. Although I
sold too early, it ultimately proved one
of my best buying decisions so far in
1964. The purchase was made in the
face of criticism from all directions,
primarily because the company had no
fixed assets of any consequence. As
often happens, though, the majority who
profess to know all know very little.
Eric White is one of the largest public
relations firms in the world. Formed less
than 20 years ago, it now has offices
throughout Australia, and in London,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Auckland.
While most investors are probably a
little hazy about what a public relations
firm does, they have a pretty firm under-
standing of just what profits are.
For the second year in succession, ad-
justed profits in 1963 rose by 12 p.c. to
£31,900. If, as would seem only fair,
this profit figure is based on the capital
of £79,500 at June 30, 1963, earning
rate is 40 p.c. The placement of 82,000
ss. shares at 7s 9d. prior to listing has
now brought the capital up to £lOO,OOO.
These funds must take a little time to be
fully employed. Even so, earning rate
should be at least 33 p.c. as directors
stated in the interim report that earnings
more than twice covered the proposed
16f p.c. dividend. Not only does this
mean higher profits this year, but it also
means that profits have continued their
upward trend.
The other deciding influence in buying
this share is that it has fallen 4s. in the
last month. There are very few shares
around and this weakening seemed to be
only due to neglect.
If I thought I was smart buying Eric
White early in its Stock Exchange career,
I wasn’t so brilliant with my purchase
of Ardlethan Tin. Up they had gone to
13s. and I was too vain to take it. Now
the bottom’s dropped out and I just don’t
know where it’s going to finish.
The moral, of course, is to stick to
something tangible. Thus my renewed
enthusiasm about Tableland Tin. Con-
sidering that the tin dredge has only been
in the productive area for five months of
the year, a profit of £131,661 on a com-
bined effective capital of £440,000 is out-
standing.
Of all metal prices, tin has stayed the
firmest, hardly wavering from the £1270
sterling level. Barring the unknown, and
that’s very difficult, Tableland Tin could
earn close to 100 p.c. this year.
What puzzles me is that the shares fell
back to 445. on this result. Not only did
I use the funds from the Ardlethan Tin
sale but I also drew heavily on the cash
reserves to build my holding up to an
even 1000.
Compensating my loss of £74 on
Ardlethan was the profit of £64 on
Chemical Materials. Ardlethan has
taught me a lesson not to be greedy!

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Preserving the Wild Animals
Must the kangaroo and buffalo go?
Tn any discussion on the preservation of
wild animals it soon becomes
apparent that only the animals are
honest. Man—the animal given the
power to think—is forever the hypocrite.
To some degree, every wild animal
faces the threat of extinction every day
of his life —but the degree does vary.
Currently facing a particular threat in
Australia are the kangaroo and the
Northern Territory buffalo.
A great many people clearly care
about the kangaroo. No one appears to
give two hoots for the poor old buffalo.
Why?
Each is an animal of the wild. Each
must care for its young, seek food as
best it can, avoid its enemies and survive,
if it can, drought, fire and flood. Each
feels pain and each bleeds.
True, the kangaroo is a “native” and
the buffalo is “introduced”. This surely
is a relative distinction. The vast
majority of Australians were “intro-
duced” and the ancestors of the present-
day buffalo were here long before the
ancestors of most Australians.
The buffalo hit with a high-powered
bullet, or with his insides poisoned, feels
exactly the same as the kangaroo in the
same predicament. The difference in
attitude—on our part—is explained by
the fact that we have adopted the kan-
garoo as our national emblem. We use
him, or rather his effigy, as a manifesta-
tion of national pride. He is our totem
and our joss.
The reason we feel differently about
the slaughter of the kangaroo and the
slaughter of the buffalo is based not on
any concern for either animal so much
as our own need for self-identification
and self-esteem. This attitude is utterly
selfish, utterly inconsistent, and utterly
hypocritical.
It is utterly unrealistic, also.
Whether we like it or not, the fact
has to be faced that both the kangaroo
and the buffalo are headed for extinction.
The buffalo, because he is less numerous
and has less friends, will go first.
Details of a planned and systematic
eradication (i.e., extermination) of
buffaloes have been announced by the
Northern Territory Director of Lands,
Mr A. Richardson, in Darwin. He said
it had been decided to adopt suggestions
made by the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics expert, Mr Van Holst, who
made a survey of NT buffalo country
towards the end of last year. Over a
period of 20 years, the herds, estimated
to number between 150,000 and 200,000
beasts, would be gradually eliminated.
Mr Richardson said there were two
main reasons for the eradication plan.
The buffalo was a highly dangerous beast
from the point of view of animal
diseases particularly foot-and-mouth.
If these diseases got into Australia’s
north they would be harbored by the
buffaloes and control would be extremely
difficult.
The second reason was that beef cattle
were a better economic proposition. The
buffaloes were utilising grassland which
could be better used by beef cattle.
One does not wish to question the
wisdom of either of these reasons,
though one must point out that the
second is the more relevant.
The buffalo was originally introduced
about a century ago in the Darwin
region, as a domesticated animal. Some
escaped and the wild herds eventually
multiplied.
They were contained within some
100,000 square miles of Darwin through
natural barriers. Arid stretches barred
the way to Queensland. Had they been
able to spread that far, they might easily
have over-run much of Queensland and
NSW.


HELP
LEGACY
all the year round
They have had little economic use
except for sporadic trade in hides and
some shipments of live animals to the
East. There has been a not very lucrative
“big game” industry going for some
years. Many visiting shooters have found
the amenities pretty rugged and the
buffalo about as exciting to shoot as a
cow in a paddock.
So sentence of death has been passed
on the buffalo. No such sentence, offi-
cially that is, has been passed on the
kangaroo but his days may be said to
be numbered also.
He is being shot at the rate of thou-
sands a week. Most of the meat goes to
feed pet dogs and cats in the big cities
—a fair reflection of man’s hypocrisy.
Whether the trade in meat is banned or
not, the decimation is likely to continue.
If there is a trade in meat and skins,
the method of extermination is likely to
remain the rifle. Otherwise it is odds-on
that some other method, either biological
or poisoning, will be used. Which is
worse? Does it really matter?
At wildlife societies’ gatherings for
some time now there has been talk that
there has been developed an equivalent
of myxomatosis which could be applied
to kangaroos. No authority, and this
includes the CSIRO, has either con-
firmed or denied the rumor.
Wildlife enthusiasts are, regrettably,
somewhat inconsistent themselves. Say-
ing that farmers must not rid their
properties of kangaroos is just the same
as saying that accountants, steelworkers,
shop assistants, university professors,
and what have you, should also accept
a salary reduction of maybe 50 p.c.
Until now, the farmer and the kanga-
roo, in many districts, have been able
to get along fairly well. It is perfectly
true that in natural country the sheep
and the kangaroo need not necessarily
eat the same vegetation. At least there
is enough evidence to suggest that there
is some doubt about whether one kan-
garoo equals one sheep.
But from now on the big story in
Australian agriculture is going to be
pasture improvement. Once pastures be-
come improved, there is no doubt what-
soever. The kangaroo forsakes the
natural vegetation for the improved
pasture.
Responsible scientists and agricultural-
ists all say that Australia must double
her wool production in the next 20
years to keep the wool industry and, to
a large extent, this nation in business.
Most agree that pasture improvement
will provide most of that increase.
What has happened to date to the
kangaroo will be relatively slight com-
pared with what will happen once the
super goes on and the clover, rye and
phalaris and other seeds go in on an
ever-increasing scale.
Is there an answer to this?
There is no complete answer. This
writer believes there is a compromise
solution at least preferable to the final
solution of complete extermination of
kangaroos.
Could not this nation afford to set
aside really large and worthwhile areas
as great national parks where all wild-
life, including even buffaloes, could be
allowed to live as nature intended? We
stress the last part —as nature intended.
Too many well-meaning animal-lovers
insist that nature reserves be stocked
only with “nice” animals such as kan-
garoos and koalas. “Nasty” animals,
such as native cats and dingoes, must be
kept out. This is no good.
Tf there is to be a veto, let it be against
A those introduced animals which
genuinely upset the balance rabbits,
foxes and pussy-cats gone wild.
Planning and staffing these big parks
would pose no problems. All the
present State wildlife departments, or
their equivalents, have sincere personnel
who would have constructive ideas on
this subject and so also would the uni-
versities.
There are game reserves and parks in
existence already, of course, but this
writer envisages something on a much
larger and more comprehensive scaled-
something of the order of 100 square
miles set aside in each representative
district.
It would cost money? Of course it
would. But there are many examples of
how such finance can be raised, other
than cutting into already committed
public expenditure.
In California, for example, the fine
parks are paid for by revenue from the
all-totalisator racetracks. This seems
fitting, somehow. The racehorse, a noble
animal, assists by his exertions the
preservation of creatures of the wild.
And this writer, for one, would prefer
to buy a ticket in a lottery devoted to
game preservation rather than one aimed
at building a grandiose opera house
sometime in the distant future.
Whatever we do, let’s be honest about
it. It could not be financed by passing
around the hat. It would be necessary
in some cases to buy properties already
being utilised for primary production
and a fair price would have to be paid.
The idea that a nature reserve should be
land that nobody wants because it
is no good for anything is the height
of human hypocrisy. (Red Indians and
Australian Aboriginals might agree.)
In the long run, should worthwhile
areas of good land be returned to their
natural state, there would be many
benefits for us, all quite apart from
aesthetics.
What with the need for greater
primary production, and the increasing
hazards of pesticides, all wildlife is
headed in one direction unless we really
do something on a large scale. Too
readily we point the finger at others.
The new African nations are accused
of beastliness in their efforts to rid
themselves of their wild animals.
Most of us know that at one time
the buffalo (or bison) roamed the North
American continent. At one time, also,
Britain had bears and wolves.
Man, wherever he is, has a right to
survive. The 16th-century English baron,
the 19th-century American plainsman,
the present-day Australian sheepfarmer
and the Nigerian coffee-grower are all
examples of man exercising that right.
Every time a sharpshooter on the
western plains lets go at a kangaroo
with a high-velocity .232, we all have a
finger on the trigger. Likewise we are
all guilty whenever a scientist working
in a nice clean laboratory comes up
with a new, more deadly, killer spray
or killer disease.
We cannot wash our hands entirely
clean, probably. At least we ought to be
able to remove some of the smell.
Butcher versus Supermarket
How will the farmer he affected?
: Tlhe battle between the butcher and the
A supermarket is hotting up a little in
certain Melbourne suburbs. Melbourne is
said to be the main area for supermarket
development in Australia and probably
this is so.
At any rate, the Sydney tragedy of a
shopkeeper going to prison rather than
paying a fine for late trading is unlikely
to occur in Victoria, for the very good
reason that the small corner grocery store
has, apart from “Continental delicacy”
shops, pretty well disappeared.
The butcher may be the next to go
and this is of interest to the farmer.
(Butchers also, no doubt.)
With little fuss or bother, and virtually
no advertising, certain suburban super-
markets have been selling considerable
quantities of packaged meat in recent

months. The meat includes most of the
things you can buy at the butcher’s shop
_-legs of lamb, steak, beef, chops and
so on. It is packaged and “light”, not
“deep”, frozen.
Prices? If anything, the supermarket
meat is a penny or two a pound dearer
than at the “cheap” butcher and a little
under the “quality” butcher’s prices.
Quality? According to housewives, ex-
tremely good. And, according to at least
one butcher in competition with the
supermarkets, suspiciously so.
“They could not possibly be selling
this meat at the prices they do and show
a profit”, he said. “They are taking a
loss in the hope they will drive us out
of business.”
The manager of a supermarket denied
this. But he admitted that packaged meat
was a big item in marketing plans. “So
far we have just scratched the surface,”
he said. “We aren’t even advertising
meat, although we do advertise chickens
and fish.”
Supermarkets do have an impersonal
quality all right. Probably the reason does
lie in the allegations by the butcher.
How will the prices the farmer gets
for his beef and mutton on the hoof
react? So far there is no way of knowing.
No one knows for sure, except the
directors of supermarket chains, what
plans there are in this country for “verti-
cal integration”. “Vertical integration” is
just a flash way of saying “monopoly”.
It is widespread in the United States and
is one of the reasons for the sick state
of the home US beef-growing industry.
The supermarket chain owns the out-
lets, the killing works, and the farms on
which the beef is raised. If it does not
own the farms outright, it controls them
by marketing arrangements with the
farmers.
It could be a good thing for the farm-
er; or it could be a bad thing. The farmer
right now must come to terms with the
possibilities of this kind of operation and
plan accordingly.
Judging Wheat Competitions
How points are allotted
By MARIEL LEE
Itarmers who enter wheat crop com-
petitions, and even those who wish
to grow better crops, need to be con-
versant with the basis on which these
are judged, the scale of points awarded
and why points are lost.
The allotting of points may vary
somewhat from State to State. In the
main, however, they will agree with
those adopted by the Farm Competition
Association of Victoria, which allows 35
points for estimated yield, 20 for purity
and type, 15 for absence of weeds, 15
for absence of disease, and 15 for
evenness.
The importance of high yield is
stressed by allotting most points for
this, though other factors more under
the farmer’s control may offset a lighter
yield. Even with maximum care some
weeds may creep into a competition
crop, but the points lost still depend
largely on the kind of weeds. Any
noxious weeds, like saffron thistle, or
objectionable ones, like melilotus, would
cause severe deductions. Allowance
would be made for those like skeleton
weed, where it was obvious that
approved measures had been taken
against the pest.
In crop competitions, purity means
freedom from barley, rye, oats, or even
other wheat varieties. Two varieties can
certainly be included in one entry.
There must be no intermingling of
varieties along the dividing line or at
corners. Each variety, too, must be true
to the accepted standard type of that
variety. Since even pure seed will pro-
duce some off-types, a few of these might
be overlooked. Too many off-types and
strangers would mean loss of points. To
counter the tendency towards off-types
the farmer must either obtain a new line
of pure seed, or, before harvest, rogue a
section of his crop and build up his own
pure seed from this.
Presence of any preventable disease,
like bunt or ball smut, which can be
controlled by thorough pickling of seed,
would be penalised by loss of points.
Rust, from which most recommended
varieties are not immune, would be more
leniently regarded.
Evenness applies to preparation as
well as the actual crop, the appearance
of which depends upon height, density
and drilling all being even. Here results
depend largely on seasonal conditions.
Too much rain at sowing time, or soon
after, waterlogging the crop; too little
rain, or rain at the wrong period, all
make for patchiness and adversely affect
yield. An extreme case was the drowning
of two stray sheep in one Victorian
farmer's recently-sown crop intended for
competition! Only expert husbandry
and unremitting effort can counter such
difficulties.
