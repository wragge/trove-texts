TREES FOR TOMORROW
PAPER FOR PROGRESS (No. 2 of a series)
Foresters of A.P.M. Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd. are today planning and planting
the forests needed to supply generations as yet unborn.
Most paper and paper products are made from wood. Since 1950 A.P.M.’s forestry company,
A.P.M. Forests Pty. Ltd., has established about 40 million trees on more than 50,000 acres of tree
farms in Victoria, Queensland and N.S.W.
The five million trees planted by the company in 1964 will help to meet Australia’s requirements
of wood and wood products in the 1980’s.
Annual plantings of more than 8,000 acres are planned for the years ahead.

And no room cooler can filter dust, pollen and germs from

HOW
BIG
IS ■■
BIGGEST?
When talking of industry, there can be no question about it the Railways of Australia are outstandingly
the biggest. Collectively, they represent a capital investment of £782 million. As the nation’s biggest
employer, they directly give employment to 131,000 men and women; indirectly, they give employment to
scores of thousands more —from those who build their locomotives to those who supply carpets for the floors
of their air-conditioned trains.
How big is biggest? The Railways of Australia operate 2,952 locomotives, 7,127 passenger vehicles and
96,186 goods wagons over 25,500 miles of track. Last year, the Railways of Australia had a turnover of
£209 million; paid out nearly £146 million in salaries and wages; bought goods and materials to the
value of £6O million.
Last year, the trains of the Railways of Australia ran 96 million miles (a distance to beyond the sun),
carried 471 million passengers and moved 56 million tons of freight in a never-ending collection and
distribution of the nation’s wealth. Railway support means more jobs for more Australians to work
towards the ideal of a more progressive, more prosperous Australia.

National Notebook
Misfortune
T>erth’s festival hasn’t been every-
body’s idea of a festival, the chief
difficulty at times being to find the festi-
val. Visitors to Perth have been spared
the agonising decisions of Adelaide with
half a dozen-odd major attractions on
the same night, but they have felt at times
that Perth might have kept things
moving.
Stronger criticisms of Perth’s leisurely
way of tackling things came from Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust producer Robin
Lovejoy, who produced “Othello” at the
New Fortune Theatre within the Univer-
sity of Western Australia. Mr Lovejoy
said afterwards that confusion, muddle-
headedness and lack of managerial con-
trol at the theatre had made the produc-
tion an ordeal.
Mr Lovejoy said he had no complaints
about his cast, but he claimed he had
been promised people from various Uni-
versity groups to help build scenery,
make costumes and work back-stage.
“When 1 arrived,” Mr Lovejoy said,
“I was told much of this help had been
withdrawn. Costumes were ready too late
to be used in rehearsals and I had to sew
for four days myself to help get them
ready.”
Getting Them Rolling
Tt had been, for Messrs Jagger, Richard,
Watts, Jones and Wyman, a hard
night’s flight. “How much further have
we Stones got to roll before we get to
Australia?” they asked the air hostess
midway between Honolulu and Fiji.
Everyone who was no one was at
Mascot airport to meet them. About
3000 teenagers had rolled up by available
bus since dawn. There was also a thick
pocket of Press, radio, TV interviewers
and disc jockeys and two young women
who said they were from Channel 10.
“You must be joking,” promoter Mr
Harry Miller said. They assured him they
were not. “We're from the news division
and this is to be included in an hour-long
spectacular Channel 10 is going to screen
when it begins transmission,” they ex-
plained. Mr Miller walked dazedly away.
The first Rolling Stone to set foot in
Australia, Mick Jagger, paused in the
doorway of the first-class passenger exit.
It was too much for the younger on-
lookers who began to scream deliriously
and surge forward. A section of barri-
cade collapsed. One long-legged girl
eluded the plunging policemen in a
head-long sprint to the laughing Jagger.
She managed to hug him before a
uniformed arm snatched her back with
a wrench that neatly removed her blouse.
Joined by his colleagues and Mr
Andrew Loog Oldham, the group’s
“brains”, Jagger led the way into their
seats at the Press conference inside the
terminal. The questions came slowly, pre-
dictably.
After a long .silence Mr Loog Oldham
took over. “I know the sort of thing to
ask them to get them rolling,” he an-
nounced and then asked: “Is that real
hair?”, “Are you anaemic?”, and “What
do you do for kicks?” in quick succession.-
Wyman then yawned outright. “What’s
your message for parents, then?” one
interviewer persisted. “Immorality,” said
Keith Richard. “Really?” someone piped.
“Aw, come off it, nit! That's what you
Press lot want us to say, isn’t it?” Richard
rejoined. The Stones then adjourned to
the radio and TV conference. Two young
women stopped them on the way
through. They were the girls from Chan-
nel 10 requesting autographs.
During the second conference Wyman
began to wake up a bit. Enough to say
that his striking resemblance to Charles
II was, as far as he knew, just coinci-
dental. All the Stones mocked a sugges-
tion that they might be interested in
marrying Australian girls. “Bill and me
are already married and the rest of us
are only here for three weeks,” Charlie
Watts said. “Well, that’s a relief, any-
way,” someone replied.
Pausing only to sign more autographs
for the girls from Channel 10, the Stones
then rolled on.
Event
of the year’s major cultural events
in New Zealand will be a produc-
tion of “Porgy and Bess” by the New
Zealand Opera Company with a mixed
Maori-Negro cast.
Unique Opportunity
A s far as we know the last London
deb. put on black stockings and a
leather dress and vanished into the
wilderness of Chelsea about five years
ago. It was thought then that the species
was extinct but apparently a sub-species
still thrives the Australian girl who
wants to live out the anachronism of the
London season. There are 300-odd
applications to join Lady Mackworth’s
debs’ tour of Europe which leaves in
March.
These applications are being sifted by
the organisers, Travelwise, and Lady
Mackworth to select 15 girls. We asked
the manager of Travelwise, Mr Bede
McCauley, how the selection was being
made.
“I can’t tell you who is going,” he
said, “but I can tell you who is not
going. For a start the girl who does not
have all the basic social graces will not
go and neither will the girl who must be
in the limelight all the time with photos
and so on.”
The tour costs £1495 and is for six
months. There are four days at Ascot,
but if you want to go to the Buckingham
Palace garden party you have to get your
own invitation through Australia House
or the Agents-General.
Having straightened out the practical
details, the itinerary adds: “This is a
unique opportunity for our girls to obtain
an introduction to society and culture
such as they could never hope to obtain
here in Australia.”
Children s Theatre
'T'he recently launched Australian
A Theatre for Young People is now
moving on from its first full-scale produc-
tion, Barbara Vernon’s “Hullabaloo
Belay”, which may go on tour soon, to
the idea of theatre workshops for child-
ren.
These, mercifully, are not to train
children to become performers but audi-
ence. The theatre's executive secretary,
Miss Diana Sharpe, recently spent four
weeks in England (with the help of Air
India, because the theatre hasn’t got that

sort of money yet) studying this sort of
thing there.
Miss Sharpe found that although much
of the theatre offered to children in
England was not particularly good, in-
teresting things were being done in the
workshops. “You might get as many as
200 children at a workshop theatre on
a Saturday morning,” she said. “They
would be given a simple theme and
within the space of a couple of hours
would work out how it should be pre-
sented.”
Miss Sharpe, said that the latest British
White Paper on education stated that
drama should not be just a frill but an
integral part of education, and the Lon-
don County Council has instructed its
teachers to make more use of drama.
The Australian Theatre for Young
People seems to be taking steps towards
making drama an integral part of the
education of New South Wales children.
But although their work has the blessing
of the Education Department, under the
Wyndham plan it seems ample provision
is made for music and art but drama re-
mains haphazard.
Changeover
\ recent changeover at the US In-
formation Service headquarters in
Sydney has brought James Markey from
Indonesia to succeed Milton Chase. Mr
Markey comes to Australia after terms
in Formosa, Korea, Thailand and two
in Indonesia. Mr Chase, who was for
five years in Kuala Lumpur before
coming to Australia, now goes to
Washington, probably to work for the
Voice of America.
Mr Chase had one glimpse of Aus-
tralia before he came here three years
ago. When he escaped from the Philip-
pines in 1941 he spent a couple of days
in Perth before being shipped back to
the United States. He visited Perth
recently and found it changed almost
beyond recognition.
One of Mr Chase’s regrets is that
during his term of office he could not
succeed in persuading Washington to
send an exhibition of modern American
art to Australia. “We had something to
do with the Michener collection,” he
said, “but although we have collections
of prints going the rounds here, we
haven’t managed to get official sponsor-
ship of an art exhibition. That’s when
Australia realN seems the end of the
line.”
Mr Chase pointed out that the United
States Information Service had been
responsible for the first visit to Aus-
tralia of the Alvin Ailey Dance Com-
pany, which is at present making a
return tour under commercial sponsor-
ship. However, most entertainment
groups are aimed mainly at the uni-
versity level.
Early Shift
At 6 a.m. precisely, Mr Aub Laidlaw
unlocked the shutters at the beach
end of the tunnel and invited us in out
of the cold. The southerly wind had not
deterred a score or more hardies from
taking their pre-breakfast constitutional
on Bondi, but it was a lot cosier inside
the tunnel.
This is the underground passage lead-
ing from the Bondi Surf Life Saving
Clubhouse to the beach. “I perch here
and get an uninterrupted view of what's
going on along the entire beach,” Mr
Laidlaw said. As Bondi’s beach inspec-
tor for some 35 years he is used to start-
ing work early.
“Sometimes during summer the first
thing I have to do is wake up the people
sleeping on the beach. I let them snore
until about seven o'clock then I go over
and say good morning and tell them it’s
time for breakfast.”
But the main job, Mr Laidlaw said,
was to save lives. Four permanent in-
spectors were employed by Waverley
Council at Bondi. “You see that bloke
out there,” Mr Laidlaw said, pointing
towards the first line of breakers. “He’s
got out there in about seven seconds
while we’ve been talking. There’s a rip
taking him out, but he’s all right now
he’s reached the choppy stuff. He knows
what he’s doing, but you’ve got to
watch them.
Surfies are a bit of a menace at Bondi,
Mr Laidlaw told us. “I wouldn't have
them here at all if I had my own way.
They cut the lines on the lifesavers’
reels. Did you know that? And they
break off the danger signs’ poles. Then
they pinch the safety flags.”
Mr Laidlaw thinks Bondi is noth-
ing like it used to be. “It’s never
been the same since they stopped the
trams,” he said. “In those days you’d
get about 300 people, counting hangers-
on, arriving on double trams every three
minutes. We'd pack in 100,000 on this
beach on Sunday, now the best we get
is about 50,000.”
Anniversary
January 26 is the 177th anniversary of
the founding of Australia. Coming
up behind is The Bulletin. Eighty-five
years ago on January 31 was “sent broad-
cast through the colonies the first num-
ber of The Bulletin”.
A thought for Anniversary Day is that
only a few months ago a Sydney Junior
Chamber of Commerce demanded that
the names of Ball's Head and Ball’s Head
Bay be changed. Australians may have
little feeling for their history but why
would a chamber of commerce want to
wipe out the memory of the first man
who engaged in foreign trade on our be-
half? Lt Henry Ball was captain of
HMS Supply, the naval tender, in which
Governor Phillip entered Sydney Harbor
on January 26, 1788, after 252 days at
sea. A couple of weeks later Lt Ball
left for Norfolk Island in Supply, on the
way naming Ball’s Pyramid off Lord
Howe Island. In the desperate days of
1790, Ball took Supply to Batavia where
the Dutch extracted every penny they
could out of him selling him stores for
the tiny colony.
CONFOUNDED CONDESCENSION
bulletin
80 Years Ago: January 31, 1885
\ mong the new-chums who have
been interviewed on the arrival of
mail steamers at South Australia is
Admiral Tryon, who, it appears, was
condescending enough to say that “if
a Federal (Australian) fleet were
formed, he thought it probable some
arrangement might be made by which
colonial vessels of war might receive
the same status as vessels of the
Imperial navy.” This strikes us as
tolerably cool and impudent. What
we would suggest is this: that were a
Federal Australian fleet formed, the
officers of that fleet should take pre-
cedence, in Australia, over officers of
corresponding rank in any fleet
whatever. What concern would the
Imperial fleet be to Australians
if, as Admiral Tryon said, we
“could not altogether rely on” it.
as compared with the Federal fleet,
upon which we could altogether rely
to the utmost of its capabilities. The
“status” of a fleet should, to Austra-
flans, be governed by its ultimate value
for the pur pose for which it would
j n t enc j ec i— i n this instance, the
defence of ALlstralia . Confound these
, .. t ,
condescend,ng puppets. They do more
lo create alienations of feeling by
insensate haw-hawisms than all the
wisdom of real statesmen can repair
in a generation. We read not long ago,
in a London paper, that Admiral
Tryon’s appointment to this station
was the result of favoritism, and in-
volved'the passing over of many offi-
cers of greater experience and senior
rank. Well, anyhow, if Admiralty pets
must be sent, care misfit be taken that
they should not prattle and disclose
the magnificence of their indiscretion.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Bishop and the Dreaded Words
TV/hen the Anglican Bishop of Gipps-
land, Dr D. A. Garnsey, said last
week that the Anglican Church had
neglected its responsibilities in the field
of politics, one knew at once how many
people would interpret or misinterpret
him. There were many to claim that
the Bishop was simply saying that the
Church should have a greater spiritual
influence on daily life so that citizens
may act in a more Christian way when
they are engaged in politics, etc., etc.
The implication was that the Bishop
was not saying anything that has not
been said many times before. Who
can forget (or is it remember?) the
Call to the Nation of 1951 and the
derisive influence it had on daily life?
In fact, however, the Bishop was
doing far more than repeat the standard
clerical cliches. Firstly, the Anglican
Church is the church to which the
largest number of Australians belong
(if only nominally) and to which they
still look for religious guidance (even
if only out of family habit). Yet in a
world which has been more divided on
political-moral matters than at any
time since the Reformation and
Counter - Reformation, when slavery
has been revived and expanded, when
terrorism and mass-slaughter become
commonplace, when the churches and
any independent groups have been
more systematically attacked by totali-
tarian governments than at any time
in world history—in this sort of world
Anglicans have too often looked to
the Church leaders and found a deep
indifference to these matters combined
with a passionate concern over such
comparatively trivial issues as drink,
homosexuality and lewd novels or
such comparatively dead ones as
State Aid. While there have been
notable exceptions, Anglicans have
even found some Church leaders
apologising for Communism and lend-
ing respectability to “Peace” fronts.
The fact that they have had little poli-
tical influence may be fortunate, but is
beside the point. The point is that
the Church has lost the habit and skill
of leadership on the great issues of the
day.
Secondly, the Bishop was referring to
more than the intangible spiritual in-
fluence of the Church on daily life. He
was raising the question of hard, down-
to-earth political organisation, of—
dreaded words!—interference in poli-
tics. Communists or Fascists have not
been beaten, poverty has not been eli-
minated by intangible spiritual influ-
ences alone, but by efficient political
organisation, often under this religious
influence. Politics is organisation, and
the Churches only succeed in having
political influence when they are linked
with lay organisations which they can
stimulate and guide. There is no sense
in making a fetish of non-interference;
every time an Anglican votes he inter-
feres in politics, since interference is
only a synonym for participation, and
if the Church is afraid to interfere, it
is afraid of politics. As Dr Garnsey
said: “The Old Testament prophets
were constantly interfering in political
matters —foreign policy and domestic.”
This does not mean of course that
the Church should run the details of lay
political organisations, but it should
encourage participation in, and if
necessary the formation of, political
organisations. At the moment the
Anglican Church, the biggest church in
Australia, does no such thing. Yet
these were the radical ideas that Dr
Garnsey was surely raising. It would
be a great pity if they were yet again
translated into pointless cliches.
Thick and Thin
T'he war in South Vietnam may now
A be entering one of its most fateful
periods as it seems increasingly pro-
bable that there will be some moves,
however limited, to carry it to the
North. Last November, President L. B.
Johnson agreed “in principle” with
the US Ambassador to South Vietnam,
Maxwell Taylor, to move the war
north, but only on condition that the
South Vietnam Government were
stable. Since the overthrow of the
Diem regime, there has been no
thoroughly stable government in
Saigon and no likelihood of one. But
the new Tran Van Huong Government
seems to be as stable a government as
it is possible to get until it begins to
win victories over the Communists and
is able to persuade the people to sup-
port it with more confidence.
The political condition for retaliation
against Hanoi therefore now exists.
At the same time North Vietnam esca-
lation of the war inside South Vietnam
has intensified as the Communists have
moved on from guerrilla operations to
conventional battles. In the last of
the recent major battles, the battle of
Phuoc Tuy, 40 miles south-east of
Saigon, the Communists committed
three battalions of 1500 men and won
their biggest victory in the war so far.
Further, fresh Communist troops have
been moving down regularly from
North Vietnam at the rate of 400 to
600 a month, bringing Chinese mortars
and rifles with them.
The Saigon authorities do not as-
sume that the Communists intend their
escalation to culminate in a full-scale
decisive battle comparable to Dien
Bien Phu, even if only because Ameri-
can air power could turn that into a
Communist catastrophe. But if the
Communists can surround Saigon, they
can destroy any hopes of political
stability in the city, and if they can
continue to erode away the Govern-
ment’s General Reserve —its ten elite
battalions—in major but not full-scale
battles, the Government would have to
depend on its inferior regulars and its
days would be numbered.
In this situation limited retaliation
against North Vietnam for each
new Northern operation in the South
may be the only effective deterrent.
The steel industry near Hanoi and the
Haiphong cement works are obvious
targets, which up till now the Ameri-
cans have restrained the South Viet-
nam Government from attacking. If
the war does develop on these lines, it
would be up to Hanoi to see that it
does not escalate further, and, given
its vulnerability, it would probably
quickly do so. If Hanoi then with-
draws from South Vietnam, the Saigon
Government can return to its old
policy of confining the war to the South
and winning it there.
The fundamental point, however, is
that a victory for the Communists in
South Vietnam would mean delivering
all of South-East Asia to the Commu-
nists and Australia has no alternative
but to support the South Vietnam
Government through thick and thin.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Purging Barry Jones?
Meanwhile back at HQ
MELBOURNE Barry Jones will
be opposed to an old and unpredictable
opponent when he faces the Victorian
ALP Central Executive on February 8.
Instead of the affluent Bob Dyer, the
quiz masters will be a dedicated band
of class warfare guerrillas whose chief
aim is to remind the Labor movement
that nothing in society has altered since
Disraeli wrote “Sybil", and whose major
achievement has been to guarantee Sir
Robert Menzies and Henry Bolte record
terms of office.
Charges were originally laid against
Barry Jones by Brian Zouch, an un-
compromising sort of man who works
for a suburban paper in Melbourne. In
July last year Jones circulated privately
an analysis of the state of the Labor
Party which attempted to account for
its series of electoral defeats. This
analysis, although having the outward
appearance of rationality and modera-
tion, was uncovered by Mr Zouch as a
McCarthyist smear against the unity of
Labor: even worse, it showed traces of
sympathy with Santamaria.
Writing in the Melbourne Socialist
magazine “Dissent” last year Jones said
of the ALP: “I find little hatred or fear
of the Victorian ALP nowadays—it
seems to be a very toothless old tiger—
but the Party does excite much good
humored derision. Many voters feel
sorry for the Party and would like to see
it restored—even if only as an effective
opposition, but do not trust it enough
to give it a vote.
“I submit that there are three main
reasons for Labor's persistent failure:
(a) lack of public confidence in evasive
or contradictory policies; (b) a feeling
that the Party lacks sufficient compe-
tence to govern and (c) the narrowing
basis of Party support.”
Although Mr Zouch could not de-
monstrate his case by exact reference to
the text, the ALP Executive, under-
standably impatient with the nagging
concern of Party intellectuals for elec-
toral achievement, decided to teach
Jones and his like a lesson: To the
Ripponlea branch of the ALP, of which
Jones is president, they sent five of their
toughest men: Wally Butler, Ted Innes,
Bert Nolan, Bill Browm and Bill Hartley.
The order was to get Jones reprimanded
and, if possible, expelled by his own
branch. The Ripponlea branch refused
to be intimidated. It tailed to accept
the view of the Executive and passed a
vote of confidence in Jones. All that
most observers learnt from this small
demonstration of its death-wish was that
the Victorian Executive was even more
out of contact with branch feeling than
was hitherto apparent: there was never
any significant chance of the branch
censuring Jones.
Meanwhile, back at headquarters it
has been decided, after lengthy debate,
that Jones must face the Executive on
February 8 to once again answer the
charges of Mr Zouch. One faction, of
which the State President and Secretary,
Messrs Holt and Hartley, are said to
belong, would rather drop the whole
matter on the grounds that it is bad
public relations for the ALP to attempt
to discipline a TV folk hero.
BARRY JONES
However, the more anti-intellectual
elements on the Executive have managed
to prevail and Jones faces the possibi-
lity of reprimand and expulsion. Jones’
high standing with a number of Labor
parliamentarians will probably save him
from the latter. And so the Victorian
ALP having alienated white-collar work-
ers, Catholics, Jews and new Australians,
proceeds on its latest quest of alienating
social and political thinkers: it can win
neither the money nor the box.
QUEENSLAND
The Isa’s Ruin
Dingoes?
MT ISA —The slow-burning fuse of
the Mount Isa Mines dispute, lit on
August 25 last year, now seems only
days away from flash-point. Last week
the Queensland Government showed
that it has almost lost patience with
Mount Isa's striking miners when Pre-
mier Frank Nicklin declared after a long
Cabinet meeting: “The Government
realises and accepts responsibility in this
matter and wishes to make it perfectly
clear that, if good sense does not pre-
vail, it will take firm action to uphold
industrial laws in this State.” Mr Nick-
lin labelled “a certain section of irre-
sponsible persons who fail to appreciate
the grave issues involved” of having
placed Mount Isa in a position where it
was in real danger of being ruined. He
appealed to the miners for “good sense
and sanity” and asked them to return
to work. This, Mr Nicklin said, was
the Government's final appeal. There
are few people in Queensland that feel
the State Government does not mean
what it says this time.
On December 10 last year the State
Government declared that there was a
State of Emergency at Mount Isa where
400 miners had refused contract work
for four and a half months in an effort
to secure wage and condition claims,
A declaration which came into force on
December 10 ordered Mount Isa Mines
Limited to keep the mines open and
that the miners return to normal work,
But the miners refused contract work,
many were sacked, and eventually the
mines closed down on December 15 for
“economic reasons". When this hap-
pened the miners claimed the State
Government had “dingoed" by passing
the responsibility back to the Mines’
management. However. Nicklin and his
Government had not dingoed. They
simply were trying to avoid using a
mailed fist, when there was a chance
of peaceful settlement. The Govern-
ment's final hope for mediation was
State Industrial Commissioner H. J.
Harvey who has the ability to talk to
unionists in their own language,
But even Commissioner Harvey failed
to cool the hot-heads at Mount Isa when
he flew there. For days, Commissioner
Harvey presided over a compulsory
conference at which miners made many
gains. Among them: an increase of
33T per cent in the contract price while
six-hour conditions applied; a provision
that all contracts be signed within 24
hours. The shift in which the agree-


ment was made and copies of the
contract be made available to represent-
atives of the contract parties and union
representatives on the Contract Refer-
ence Board; greater recognition by Con-
ti act Reference Board, a simplified griev-
ance procedure wh.ch w.ll be intro-
duced into the Mount Isa Mines Award,
, . f
by consent of the parties, to speed up
the handling of disputes; greater re-
sponsibility be placed with the company
for the supply of machines and equip-
ment for the use of contractors. These
were only some of the gains besides £3
wage increase granted by the State In-
dustrial Commission.
Commissioner Harvey planned to tell
a mass meeting of miners at Mount Isa
last week of their gains. But the meet-
ing was broken up by a wildly yelling,
booing, cat-calling section of miners
carefully spaced around the Star Thea-
The troub , e started when the
_ , , ~ , „ . ,
Federal president and Queensland secre-
-1 , TT .
taI T of the Australian Workers Union,
Edgar Williams, tried to speak. Mr
Harvey left the stage and shortly after
Mr Williams followed. At the time of
going to press, the State Government
seemed to be determined to enforce its
declaration of a State of Emergency.
RELIGION
The Buddhists at Cowra
Ecumenical half-hour at the Japanese cemetery
COWRA —The circumstances of the
first Buddhist ritual ever to be conducted
publicly in Australia were about as
ecumenical and authentically Australian
as the Cowra district could have made
them: the scene, amongst the gums and
persistent small bush-fly stingings, in
brilliant sunshine and 100 degrees of dry
heat, was the Japan section of the war
cemetery outside Cowra; arrangements
were by the Japanese community in
Sydney, who had taken advantage of
the temporary sojourn of two priests
on their way home after a year’s re-
fresher course in temples of Bangkok.
The Anglican rector, Rev. S. Carr,
wearing his Rotary badge, and the Rev.
R. Leahr (Methodist) were with the
Mayor of Cowra, Aid. A. J. Oliver,
and the RSL president, Mr T. H.
Bryant, to greet the priests at the air-
port and later at the cemetery. Father
Whelan (RC) would have been along
too but an urgent call came in before
the plane from Sydney had touched
down 90 minutes late.
Mr Y. Ooka,* vice-consul in Sydney,
had motored to Cowra the previous
afternoon (in his private capacity) with
the makeshift altar, a table with screw-
in legs. By noon, when the service
belatedly started, this altar had been
set up opposite the pathway to the
black granite column which is the chief
feature of the cemetery’s exquisite lay-
out. On a snow-white cloth were
flowers, a bowl with incense sticks, two
candles, a silver gong and two soft-
drink bottles containing water (ordinary,
but brought from Japan). After reciting
the sutras, the two priests, each taking
one side of it, toured the cemetery
sprinkling a drop of this water from the
fatherland on each of 522 nameplates.
For besides those of 275 from the
Cowra p.o.w. camp (nearly all of whom
were killed in a fanatical dawn break-
out on August 5, 1944 or later suicided)
the remains of all other Japanese
nationals who died within Australia in
the war period are concentrated there
under arrangements between the two
Governments and the Anzac Agency of
the War Graves Commission. The
section adjoins the graves of Australian
soldiers who died in Cowra, mostly the
machine-gun crew overpowered in the
first wave of the 1944 breakout.
At the earlier official opening on
November 23, 1964, there was impres-
sive representation from Canberra and
Tokyo but no public prayers, as the
Japanese Administration cannot sponsor
denominational acts. But here, as in
Japan, most Japanese are Buddhists, and
Japanese priests in prayer at Australian war
graves, Cowra
to them the cemetery ground remained
unconsecrated until means could be
found to comfort the souls of the 522
exiled dead contained in it. The
fortuitous arrival of the Rev. Justinin
Otaga and the Rev. Shuno Norimi made
this possible.
The two priests faced the altar, the
seats of the congregation ranged in semi-
circles behind them.
Otaga Obo-san raised a white parch-
ment from which he read the c/m/7 in-
forming the 522 souls of the state of
Japan to that moment, of the arrange-
ments that had been made to bring their
earthly remains to a common resting-
place. Before raising the parchment a
little higher and then placing it on the
altar with a deep and slow obeisance, he
charged the spirits to rest in peace. In
concluding his choji he had been moved
to write that all realised the 522 souls
he addressed would rest the more peace-
fully could they be assured that never
again would Japan undergo the tragedy
and futility of war.
It lasted 30 minutes, the average dura-
tion of a Christian mass. Not once did
the celebrants refer to a book. Then,
after sprinkling the 522 nameplates, and
without informing anyone of their in-
tention (for seemingly to them it was
settled procedure in the circumstances),
the priests moved solemnly and at first
alone to the few nearby Australian
graves where for a little over five
minutes they repeated, also by heart,
part of the sutras they had been reciting
100 yards away at the altar fronting
the Japanese section, where the aroma
grew more fragrant and exotic as in-
dividual Japanese took turns to light
sticks in the incense bowl, joining their
hands in prayer and bowing.

WA ELECTION
Key Fronts
Campaigns focus on TV
PERTH The Brand-Nalder Liberal-
Country Party coalition looks set to be
the first postwar West Australian
Government to return for a third term.
Premier Dave Brand opens his short,
sharp campaign on February 2; Oppo-
sition Leader Bert Hawke replies on
February 5, and the voters decide on
February 20. Both campaigns will focus
on TV, although Mr Hawke's platform
will be put forward live at Northam, it
will be pre-recorded. While Mr Brand's
rather bland personality gets through
well on TV, he cannot match the force-
fulness of the Opposition Leader. And
this approach will be left to Cabinet TV
star Charles Court.
The Government will be going in on

the crest of a wave, able to put up a
platform not of development to come,
but of accelerated development on five
key fronts—minerals, agriculture, indus-
try and trade, the North, and tourism.
February 20 will also see the first

ing to land owned or rented.) Because

though Labor could increase its tally.
EDUCATION
B. Schools
" Chances are slim ”
MELBOURNE —lt would be sur-
prising if a January passed without some
complaint about the injustices of school
and public examinations. The “Mel-
bourne Herald” used such a complaint
recently to cane the Victorian Assistant
Minister of Education, Mr J. F. Rossiter,
when a correspondent claimed that
students sitting for internal school exa-
minations had a long lead in job-
hunting over those sitting for external
public examinations (who have to wait
two months longer for their results).
Mr R. O. Desailly, President of the
Victorian Secondary Teachers’ Associa-
tion, added fuel by pointing out that
results in accredited schools (Class A
schools) were not only delivered earlier
but were also markedly better than re-
sults in non-accredited (Class B) schools.
The Victorian Secondary Teachers’
Association survey of Intermediate and
Leaving Certificate examination results
showed that 75 per cent of Class A can-
didates passed against 55 per cent Class
B candidates. All other things being
equal, it seemed that Class B schools
were also second class schools.
An accredited school must satisfy
University requirements, especially in
staff qualifications. As accrediting
spreads (it is not compulsory) the Class
B schools tend more and more to be
the poorly staffed ones. Whether this
is the cause of their examination failure,
there is no doubt that parents are be-
ginning to distrust their standards.
The chief obstacle to choosing one's
own school is the Departmental policy
of zoning students. To the Department
all schools are theoretically equal, and
so may be stocked by the easiest method
available. If they are not equal, people
must either shift house or try to buck
the system; but while the schools are all
crowded, the chances of winning are
slim.


THE CONFRONTATION
Sam Lipski interviews the Indonesian Ambassador and the Malaysian High Commissioner
RADEN AHMAD KOSASIH
LIM YEW HOCK
AT the Indonesian Embassy, Canberra,
Sam Lipski asked Major - General
R. A. Kosasih: Are Australia and Indo-
nesia in a state of undeclared war? Is
Indonesia going Communist? Does Dr
Sukarno want to meet Sir Robert Men-
zies? How long will Confrontation last?
Q. Ambassador Kosasih, how would
you describe the present relations be-
tween Indonesia and Australia? Do you
agree, for instance, that we are in a state
of “undeclared war”?
Ambassador Kosasih. Definitely not.
There are differences in the political out-
look, but talk of undeclared war will not
help. I think we have good relations now.
Q. Indonesian leaders have agreed
that relations with Australia have deteri-
orated. At what point did the deteriora-
tion begin?
A. Relations until recently were not
so good, because some people were say-
ing that Australia should send more
troops to Malaysia. But I think that
since President Sukarno explained that
he wants to settle the dispute peacefully,
this talk has died down in Australia.
Q. Have you any evidence for this
change?
A. I hope that there is evidence for
such a change.
Q. Will there be any change for the
better in relations between the two coun-
tries if there is no change in Indonesia’s
Confrontation?
A. Of course things may get worse,
but that is why it is so important to
solve the problem of Malaysia. If you
look at the map you will see that Indo-
nesia wants to have a friendly neighbor
in Australia, not an enemy.
Q. Do you think that a formal
guarantee of Indonesia’s borders—as
Mr Calwell suggested—would make any
difference to Confrontation?
A. We appreciate any suggestion put
forward with the aim of easing the ten-
sion in South-East Asia, including the
recent suggestions made by Mr Calwell.
But, on the other hand, I should like to
stress the following points. First, Malay-
sia does not exist. We do not recog-
nise Malaysia. Second, the peace and
stability of South-East Asia should be in
the hands of the people in the area
themselves.
Q. What do you mean when you say
“Malaysia does not exist”?
A. Well, basically Malaysia was not
created from the will of the people—it
is built on foreign interests who are
protecting that country. We have to in-
vestigate the real wishes of the people.
Q. Didn’t this happen with the United
Nations’ investigation in the states of
Sabah and Sarawak?
A. North Kalimantan is a very big
area and an investigation which lasted
only for a very few days cannot tell
what is the wish of the people.
Q. Has there been any change in
Britain’s attitude to the dispute since
the Labor Government took power?
A. So far, I do not see any difference.
Again I stress, so far.
Q. Is it possible to describe a Socialist
Government like Mr Wilson’s as neo-
colonialist or imperialist?
A. I will tell you. There are two
types of socialism.
Q. What are they?
A. There is the revolutionary social-
ism of the New Emerging Forces and
the old socialism of the Old Established
Forces.
Q. What sort of a socialist is Mr
Wilson?
A. No comment.
Q. Many commentators say that the
withdrawal from the United Nations,
the continuation of confrontation, the
banning of the National Communist
Party, Murba, are all signs of growing
Communist (PKI) strength and influence
in Indonesia. Are the Communists gain-
ing more power?
A. No I don’t think so. The reason
for banning the Murba party is that
those who are not preaching national
unity must be banned.
Q. But was not the Murba party,
like the Army, a counter-balance to the
Communists?
A. There is no sense of truth in the
idea that there is any confrontation be-
tween the Army and the PKI. The Com-
munist Party is like any other party in
Indonesia, and it does not enjoy any
special preferential treatment. The
national and religious parties are ahead
of it in numbers.
Q. If the Communist Party is treated
like every party, why is the Murba
banned, as you have just confirmed?
A. Well, the Murba made its dis-
agreement with national unity public. If
the Communists have different views
they do not say so in public. They
agree with the Government in public.
Q. What will happen when President
Sukarno goes? Will the Communists
take over or will there be a struggle be-
tween the Army and the Communists?
A. I have not seen any conflict be-
tween the two groups at present, but I
want to stress that the armed forces are
a living apporat of the Revolution. We

in the armed forces have had to deal
with Communist revolts and with Right-
wing revolts, but I repeat we are a
living apparat of the Revolution. I think
the matter of Communism is very much
exaggerated.
Q. There is some concern in Australia
that Indonesia could go Communist,
which may mean a large nation on Aus-
tralia’s border taking orders from
Peking. Are you saying that there is no
basis for this concern?
A. Well, the Communists have two
seats in the Cabinet and one other is
seconded to the Cabinet but none has
executive power.
Q. Would you not agree that this is
not a real measure of their strength and
that a Communist Party can have power
without seats in Cabinet?
A. Well, how do you mean?
Q. It has been pointed out that their
strength comes from control of trade
unions and their well-organised “front”
groups.
A. The other political parties are just
as strong in the trade unions. Some are
stronger. It is all exaggerated.
Q. Why have so many Western
writers recently stressed the growing
strength of the Communists? I refer to
the work of people like Mr Bruce
Grant, Dr Herbert Feith and the Ameri-
can study done for the Rand Corpora-
tion by Dr Guy Pauker.
A. Yes, we have heard of them. But
you must remember that when some
of these people write a book they have
to sell it and they are sometimes being
sensational.
Q. Is this how you would regard all
of them?
A. Look, you have to realise that
Communism is your issue not ours. For
us it is not such an issue.
Q. On the matter of Confrontation
perhaps you could explain the military
thinking of Indonesia. In nearly all the
raids on Malaysia so far the Indonesian
troops have been rounded up very
quickly, many have been killed, many
have given in without a fight, and nearly
all have been captured. What’s the mili-
tary point to it all?
A. Every occurrence has its merits
and significance. Do you know how
much it is costing Malaysia to catch one
volunteer?
Q. So you are quite happy to con-
tinue this, if it ties up the troops and
resources of Malaysia?
A. Yes, and there is a political aspect.
It helps to draw the attention of the
world to Indonesia’s case.
Q. Do the people of Indonesia hear
what is going on in these raids?
A. Yes they do.
Q. Are the people interested in Con-
frontation? Do you think this is an easy
thing for them to accept?
A. Of course not. But up to now
it has been necessary to make sacrifices
for our Revolution.
Q. When will you stop making sacri-
fices? When will the Revolution end?
A. Never.
Q. What do you mean?
A. Well, we mean by Revolution
that we will work for a just and pros-
perous society for Indonesia and the
whole of mankind. The Revolution is
not over until all men are free from
colonialism. There will always be a
struggle.
Q. Was your withdrawal from the
United Nations part of this Revolution?
A. It was definitely a step forward.
We had to show the world that we are
against the domination of other peoples
by one or two powers. At first we were
not understood in Asia and Africa, but
when we explained our reasons to them,
many countries have understood it.
Q. Since the withdrawal there has
been speculation that the Peking Gov-
ernment and Indonesia will form an
alternative organisation to the United
Nations. Is this likely?
A. I don't think so. The PKI or
Peking had nothing to do with the with-
drawal. It was not done on impulse.
We were not surprised when it hap-
pened.
“Malaysia does not
exist”
Q. What about the reported plans for
a military pact between Peking and
Djakarta?
A. Every country has the right to
choose her own way to defend herself.
Q. But would such a pact with
Peking be in Indonesia’s interests?
A. No, I don't think so. But as far
as I know there is no proposal for such
a pact.
Q. Why does Indonesia not confront
East New Guinea? Why is East New
Guinea, which shares a land border with
West Irian, different from Malaysia, and
why don't you feel threatened?
A. Because we have never been at-
tacked from across that border.
Q. In a speech before the recent
Senate elections, Sir Robert Menzies
said that Australia should be prepared
for attacks and infiltration across the
border into East New Guinea. Was
Sir Robert Menzies right?
A. No comment.
Q. You saw President Sukarno be-
fore you left to take up your new post
in December. Can you tell us what his
health was like and how it is affecting
his leadership?
A. He looked well when I saw him,
but he was being treated for some pro-
blem with his leg. He is definitely the
respected Leader of Indonesia. It is
the national interests of Indonesia which
guide President Sukarno.
Q. If that is so, can you explain
what is the national interest in creating
the economic hardships which have fol-
lowed Confrontation? In 1963 there was
a stage when Indonesia looked as if she
might make the Great Leap Forward—
there were plans for development which
the United States was prepared to back
with billions of dollars. All this has been
sacrificed. Is this not terribly self- des-
tructive?
A. We are, of course, suffering in the
material field although there are coun-
tries willing to help us. But when the
choice is between following the path of
revolution or having some material
gains, then we have to choose the first
path.
Q. Could Indonesia undertake a full-
scale war against Malaysia?
A. We do not want a war.
Q. But are you strong enough to
wage one, if it started?
A. No comment, except to say again
that the armed forces are the living
apparat of the Revolution. We hope for
a peaceful solution.
Q. The latest British assessment seems
to be that there will be no full-scale
war over Malaysia. Do you agree?
A. No comment.
Q. What would satisfy Indonesia at
this stage?
A. We want a return to the Manila
Agreement, a strengthening of the
Maphilindo idea and an Afro-Asian
Conciliation Commission. We will abide
by their decision.
Q. What about the long-term future?
Can Indonesia accept the presence of
Britain in Malaysia?
A. Let me ask you a question? Can
the Malaysians accept it for long?
Q. I think they would probably not
mind.
A. Well, as long as it was on the basis
of equality, as we are now with the
Dutch who are returning, then we do
not mind. But we do not want colonial-
ist domination.
Q. Finally, what can Australia do to
improve relations between Indonesia
and Australia?
A. Any initiative to use your good
offices to bring the two parties in the
dispute together would be welcome. We
should keep up our contacts.
Q. What about the proposal of a
meeting between Sir Robert Menzies and
President Sukarno?
A. I think there would be no harm
in a meeting between two recognised
leaders. Don’t you think so?
Q. Have you any indications that
such a meeting might take place?
A. I do not work on indications, only
on facts. But I am hoping.


“Malaysia Won’t Be Crushed”
AT the Malaysian High Commission,
Sam Lipski asked Lim Yew Hock:
Should Australia do more to help
Malaysia? Why does America keep aid-
ing Indonesia? Will Malaysia last?
Q. Tun Lim, have you met the new
Indonesian ambassador, Major - General
Kosasih, yet?
A. Yes, we’ve met. You know that
Canberra has a mosque in which the
Embassy of Indonesia and the High
Commissions of Pakistan and Malaysia
are the trustees. Well, that’s where we
met —in a house of worship.
Q. What has Confrontation meant to
Malaysia economically?
A. Well, there has been some loss to
the Singapore trade as a result of the
boycott, but it has been negligible.
Q. Has Confrontation had any bene-
ficial effects?
A. Indonesia’s aggression has helped
to hasten the determination and unity
of the people of Malaysia.
Q. As recently as the New Year the
Singapore Chief Minister, Lee Kuan
Yew, did warn that racial divisions
could destroy the Federation.
A. Yes, but only to the extent that
the racial problem can be exploited.
You see, there are no inherent racial
animosities but there are differences
which have not been solved and they
provide potential ground for exploita-
tion.
Q. When you say there are no in-
herent racial differences, what about last
year’s riots?
A. Those riots were not the result of
one racial group trying to dominate
another group. They were the result of
propaganda and ignorance. There are
pro-Communist elements ready to exploit
these differences. But the point is that
they do not offer the people genuine dis-
sent nor an honest political difference
they are advocating suvbersion.
Q. Are there any political or intel-
lectual or other interested groups who
would have what you describe as an
“honest political difference” on the way
the Government should handle the dis-
pute?
A. Everyone except the pro-Com-
munists supports the principle that ag-
gression must be resisted. No one has
criticised the British defence effort.
Q. On this matter of the British in
Malaysia, how do you answer the In-
donesian charge that you are a British
creation, propped up by British guns
and British money?
A. All I can say to that is thank God
we have the British there. If Confronta-
tion were to stop, then we would ask
the British to withdraw most of their
forces, and the British would certainly
agree.
Q. But the Indonesians claim that
you can never be really independent
while there is any British presence in
the area.
A. What comes first? The chicken or
the egg? As far as defence is concerned
we admit that our interest calls for a
strong ally in the area, but that is our
right and we do not threaten anybody
by it. As for economic interests, we don’t
depend on any props. Facts and figures
prove that. Take the rubber estates
which have been going for 60 or 70
years. Sure, the boards have directors in
London but most shareholders are
Malaysians. And they are not going to
kick the British up the backside and
allow those plantations to be ruined.
Let’s be frank. As long as we reap the
benefits and as long as we are doing
well out of it, why go in for this irra-
tional economic nationalism?
Q. What is your assessment of Indo-
nesia’s withdrawal from the United
Nations?
A. That’s really a matter for the In-
donesians to answer. But there was
Sukarno boasting that he would crush
“Sukarno had to
save his ego”
us by the time the cock crowed on New
Year’s Day. Well, he had to do some-
thing to save his ego when we were still
there.
Q. Why do you think Indonesia
keeps launching raids which are almost
complete military failures?
A. You say failures. Well you know
they are. We know they are. But do the
Indonesian people know they are?
Q. Do you think, then, that these
raids are largely organised for internal
consumption?
A. Well, largely. But there is also the
influence of the PKI.
Q. Hasn’t Confrontation succeeded to
the extent that it has tied up men and
resources that Malaysia would have pre-
ferred to use for development?
A. We are spending far more money
on defence than we would want to but
our development has not been that
badly affected. And what about Indo-
nesia? She’s got hundreds of thousands
in her armed forces and her economic
development is in chaos.
Q. A recent editorial in the conser-
vative English weekly “The Spectator”
said: “Britain has no business whatsoever
in allowing Malaysia to indulge in the
sort of challenging statements that bring
conflict all the nearer.”
A. If we had wanted to be irrespon-
sible, we could have said to Britain and
to you and to New Zealand: “Look here,
we don’t believe in your sincerity. We
want proof.” Then we could have told
our boys: “In you go,” and taken the
conflict across the border. That would
have involved you and the whole Com-
monwealth. But we’ve said all the time:
“Don't let things escalate.” I would say
that this affects you in Australia particu-
larly. You’re in, but you're still not in,
if you know what I mean.
Q. Well, what do Malaysians think of
our continued aid to Indonesia and the
maintenance of diplomatic relations on
the one hand and our killing of Indo-
nesian raiders on the other?
A. You kill their raiders not because
you go out of your way to kill them
but because they go out of their way to
be killed. You’re not in a state of unde-
clared war. You probably feel that
there could be a change for the better
in Indonesia and you want to keep the
lines of communication open.
Q. How about the Americans and
Malaysia? You rejected their offer of a
loan with interest to buy jet planes.
Why?
A. It was a matter of principle with
us that we should have an interest-free
loan. We believe the Americans when
they say they would help us. But we
also believe that that assistance should
come now. The Americans have sunk
billions of dollars into Indonesia. They’re
still pinning their hopes on Indonesia
not going Communist after Sukarno.
Q. Do you think their hopes are for-
lorn?
A. Utterly forlorn. I think that there
will probably be a complete fragmenta-
tion after Sukarno goes. I would not say
that as of now a Communist takeover
in inevitable, but the longer America
helps to keep Sukarno in power the
more time the PKI has to organise.
Q. It’s been suggested that there is
split-level thinking by the Americans
about Vietnam and Malaysia, regarding
one as strategically important and the
other as less so.
A. The fall of either would be
equally disastrous. From Peking’s point
of view it’s a pincer movement. Either
they go up from the south or come
down from the north or both.
Q. How have you found Australians
generally reacting to the dispute?
A. I have sensed that the Australian
doesn’t like a bully. We know you don’t
want Malaysia crushed. It won’t be.


A Night with the Skunk Hunters
Chasing Indonesian gunboats on the Malacca Patrol
From ANTHONY BROWN in Singapore
The Malacca Patrol sailed at sun-
down from Clifford's Quay, in the
commercial district of Singapore.
The fleet of small, fast gunboats sailed
past high-castled junks with russet sails
and blue and white eyes painted on their
bows, past a hundred merchantmen an-
chored in Singapore roads, past a white
liner of the Messageries Maritime, past
Raffles Light flashing at the evening at
every ten seconds, past the exhaust flares
blaring at the petroleum plant across the
water at Jurong from the dangerous
goods anchorage, past a line of sampans
chugging to sea to catch the black and
white pomfret and the blachang, the
caviar of the East.
Sri Pahang, a 103 ft Vesper-built gun-
boat of the Royal Malaysian Navy, made
its way beneath giant cumulo-nimbus
along the foreshore of casuarina, man-
grove and aquatic trees of Singapore
Island, and out beyond St John’s Light
and The Brothers into the Straits of
Malacca, that narrow, shallow waterway
which has become the main front line in
the n iar-war between Malaysia and Indo-
nesia, to which British forces of all arms
are deeply involved.
Tonight we have been ordered into
The Golden Thread, as The Straits were
called during the days of the Spice Island
trade, with 23 other warships to “skunk
hunt'*—for Indonesian warships and in-
vasion craft are known, in that metallic
vocabulary peculiar to radiotelephonists,
radar operators and war-room plotters, as
“skunks”. Our patrol is to prevent Indo-
nesian commandos and “volunteers”
from landing on the Malayan Peninsular
coast, to prevent piracy, and to ensure
the free transit of commerce down this
important link of intercourse between the
Occident and the Orient, between the
Indian Ocean and the China Sea. For the
passage of trade has become as hazard-
ous now as it was during the 18th and
19th centuries when British frigates
destroyed the pirates as a politico-military
force and thus guaranteed the clipper
trade against plunder and murder on the
High Seas.
Piracy, with seaborne and airborne in-
vasion of Singapore and the Malayan
Peninsula, has been resurrected as a
device of warfare by President Sukarno
in his near-war policy of confrontation
of Malaysia.
Confrontation has passed beyond mere
military tiddlywinks. Nearly 100,000
men are involved in Malaysia, Singapore
and the Borneo States; among tangled
coastal plains, crocodile-infested man-
grove, amidst high volcanic mountains,
amid jungle so dense that even Gurkhas
cannot cut their way through at more
than a mile a day. And a war at sea
as irritating as mosquito attacks in tern-
pestuous squalls called “Sumatras” which
are attended by violent winds, rain, thun-
der, lightning, waterspouts.
This great waterway is narrow, shal-
low, romantic. At one point it is less than
20 miles between Sumatra and Malacca.
It begins at Penang amidst cypresses,
lime, nutmeg, ginger groves and tin
mines, and it ends near the Chinese junk
moorings close to Raffles Hotel, that
white-painted monument to the founding
father of Britain in Asia. To Sukarno
it is symbolic of the Great Majahapit
Empire, that empire which was to Indo-
nesia what the Elizabethan Age was to
Britain or the Tang Dynasty to China,
An empire which Sukarno seeks to re-
create.
Our warship is darkened. In the radar
room is the outline of Sumatra in red
phosphorescence on the screen —an
island of 108,380 square miles, part of
the spice islands of the early merchant
adventurers, part of Presiden Sukarno’s
present empire of 3000 islands and 100
million people. Sumatra, lair of some of
the advanced Indonesian bases, is an out-
line of dark volcanic hills on our Decca
TM7O7 combat radar, with valleys
flooded with lakes, and deep gorges
watched over by dormant cones. To star-
board as we lay in ambush for a sus-
pect junk was Malaya, its coastline of
creeks, mud, swamps, rubber plantations;
where grows the huge rafflesia, the
world's largest flower (it has a bloom
often a yard across); down which fleets
of ikan layer fish, each about eight to
ten feet long, speed, their dorsal fins
erected like sails above the waterway,
And above the coastline, lit by lightning,
stands the triple peaks of Mount Ophir,
which may have been the Biblical mount-
ain of Gold and Gems. Our radar screen
and the lightning showed the Straits
the heart of the Majahapit Empire,
The empire, which is the motivation of
Sukarno, was founded in 1293, and
when modern Indonesians refer to the
glories of their past they are certain to
mention it. It lasted almost a century,
until it collapsed through the afflictions


The business leaders of Australia
called for a
third Sydney television channel.
How will you back your judgment ?
Australia’s leading advertisers played a major
part in setting Channel TEN up in business by
representations to the Government for a third
commercial channel. The Government heeded
and nearly 9,000 shareholders made the
venture possible.
Already the advent of TEN has resulted in
improved service to advertisers and their
agencies.
But it means more than that.
It means a vital increase in advertising room— *
50% more peak time availabilities.
It means the opportunity many principal adver-
tisers seized when television began here —top
shows at primetimes at concession rates. The
TEN Foundation Club benefits offer up to one-
third saving in station time in the first 12
months.
We're going to give our competitors the
stimulus of vigorous competition, and our
advertisers the benefit of new lower-cost
opportunities.
TEN has the drive, the programmes and the
facilities to gain at least its share of audience
*—and audience that will, in fact, increase with
the new expanded transmission coverage. And
it has now recruited a first-class team of
thoroughly competent, experienced personnel.
TEN is fortunate in that it has no set-conver*
sion problems.
Its technical standards are the highest. TEN
possesses the first Ampex V.R.2000 videotape
machines enabling new and exciting uses of
this low-cost commercial production medium.
IVlore peak time availabilities... a wider choice
of programmes . . . more competition and
higher technical standards. Isn’t that really
why you asked for TEN?

Many advertisers are already doing so

of malaria and associated diseases, and
the extravagance of its court. Its most
powerful personality was not a king
but a prime minister named Gajah
Mada, who is now one of the symbols of
modern Indonesia. He codified the laws
and customs of the kingdom and his
administration was so solidly based that
it remained essentially the same into the
19th century. Gajah Mada was the last
man until President Sukarno to unite
Indonesia.
Raffles came with a dream of British
Asia. He called Java “The Queen of the
East” and had an imperialist’s love affair
with the island. He built Singapore as
the great free trade port between Europe
and India, China and the Indies. But
then Raffles heard in 1824 the White-
hall had handed the Indies to Holland
on a parchment platter while Malaya and
Singapore were handed to Britain by the
red seal of Holland. Although secure in
the colonial halls of fame Raffles who
was being dunned for debts to the East
India Company, his employers was
badly afflicted and was found dead at
the bottom of his stairs on his 45th
birthday. He had died of an apoplectic
stroke.
But before he died he conceived the
Malacca Patrol. For from time un-
recorded piracy, plunder, the sacking of
Malayan cities, was part of the political
dynamics of the Straits. Then peace was
brought to the Straits by British frigates
mounting 12-pounder swivel guns. The
Allies are attempting to restore security
to the Straits with the frigate of the 20th
century, vessels mounting quick-firing
4.5 inch guns and carrying helicopters.
For Sukarno —and other modern Indo-
nesians hold “colonialism” responsible
for the destruction of Indonesia’s Golden
Age, and have built powerful forces to
restore their nation and to create the
New Indonesian Empire.
Indonesia has been spending about
£440 million a year on her armed ser-
vices and, according to the Institute of
Strategic Studies, she has an army of
350,000, a navy of 35,000, an air force
of 27,000, 30,000 parachute troops. Her
air force is an impressive superficially
at least “mix” of Russian Badger
medium bombers, light attack jet
bombers, and MIGs of all marks up to
the supersonic 21. Her navy consists of
one 20,000-ton Sverdlovsk class cruiser
with the probability of a second on
order from the Soviet Union 7 Skory
class destroyers, 6 frigates, 2 corvettes,
2 ocean-going minesweepers, 21 anti-
submarine warfare vessels, 18 inshore
minesweepers, 12 submarines, 30 MTBs,
5 Komor class Russian missile-carrying
craft.
She also has 24 assorted vessels —tank
landing ships, infantry landing craft, at-
tack transports, submarine parent ships,
a supply ship, two depot ships, oilers and
one survey vessel.
Indonesia’s Navy has made a repeated
series of demonstrations of naval power
along the Borneo Straits, the Sunda
Straits and —as I write —the Sri Pahang’s
radarman is watching the progress
of two “India Golf Bravos” (radar langu-
age for Indonesian gunboats) within
Indonesian territorial waters, apparently
shepherding a group of sampans.
British naval intelligence has formed
the short-term opinion that medium-scale
landings backed by demonstrations of
naval power must be expected along the
Malacca Coast in the near future and,
in consequence, as Sri Pahang is making
its silent way down the Straits, the
Malaysian Central Government has taken
the unprecedented step of placing al-
most the entire south-western coast of
Malaysia under a curfew from high-
water mark to three miles out. This is en-
abling the fleet to detect more rapidly by
radar intruding “skunks” which, until
now, have been joining the fishing fleet of
over 2000 vessels, and using this cover to
beat radar detection.
What is war?
Tn four months there have been 70
A acts of piracy, all against fishermen.
Thirty-two fishermen have disappeared
together with 45 fishing vessels and four
junks. This piracy has been executed by
gunboats of the Indonesian Customs Ser-
vice using 70-ft-long German-built gun-
boats, painted dark grey, speed 25 knots,
crewed by men in army jungle green uni-
forms. They have been approaching the
fleets with their ensigns covered, their
vessels darkened, and their pennant
numbers painted out. The fishing sam-
pans which have eyes painted on their
prows to “enable them to see their way”
are then, in turn, used to land infiltra-
tors along the Malacca Coast.
Whatever doubts Malaysia’s Prime
Minister may have about the precise
legal definition of the conflict with Indo-
nesia— he has written through the Thai
Government to President Sukarno to
establish whether a state of war as de-
fined by the Geneva Convention exists
between the States—the combatants have
doubt. To the crews of the Javelins and
Shackletons on patrol above us Indo-
nesian aircraft are known as “bandits”;
to the warships in this screen they are
“skunks”; and ashore, in red chinograph
pencil on intelligence maps, they are
clearly marked as “enemy”. In conse-
quence Allied forces have been issued
with a formal directive from the Malay-
sian Government.
A copy, white, foolscap, stenographed,
lies amid the clutter of night glasses,
automatics, on a clip holding the pink-
colored slips of emergency, secret signals,
before the helmsman. This directive per-
mits Allied and more particularly —-
British forces to fire for effect or deter-
rence, to engage in hot pursuit, intercep-
tion, arrest, detention, when the law of
the sea or of the air or the sovereignty
of Malaysia is infringed. Thus British,
Australian and Malaysian warships have
been in action constantly and if to
Britain this may seem to be a minor war
conducted by the Indonesians with a
determination to create the maximum
irritation with the minimum military

Malacca is a luxuriant world, bathed
in the monsoons: where tonight infantry-
men prowl in search of Indonesians
hiding in the perpetual twilight of the
rain forest; where Malaysian field force
men, para-military troops, hunt for arms
and agents amidst communities of Par-
sees in spotless whites; Jews and Arabs
in dark, rich silks; Bombay merchants
in whites with crimson girdles; Bengali
washermen and the huts of Klings from

sives in a world of Chinese joss sticks,

the confusing, polyglot, polychrome
mass of the Malacca coast where lives,

Malcolm Lavisse, of Barmouth, is called
in his cabin. “Captain bridge!” “Go

call action stations.”
“Stabbed with the kris”
PThrE watch ran bare-footed to action
stations across the scrubbed white
deck. The 40.70 Bofors ranged on to
their targets in the gloom—one Indone-
sian gunboat and six sampans. Another
party broke open the racks of Sterling
sub-machine-guns in the wardroom and
ran to boarding stations fore and aft,
mounting their machine-guns on the
forecastle and the mountings behind the
bridge. Suddenly, at the moment before
the captain, standing on the bridge in his
dressing-gown but wearing a steel helmet
and carrying a pistol, ordered our search-
lights on to the target, we were detected.
The Indonesian sped off into territorial
waters at full speed leaving behind six
sampans. In them were found their
hands up while others threw their hand
grenades, stens, ammunition and explo-
sives over the side ten men. Each had
a small, red scorpion on the inside of his
belt a symbol of belonging to the
Indonesian commandos and they were
roped to the stanchions to be taken
ashore for police interrogation.
And each man was a blood oath man.
While under 2\ months’ training in com-
mando operations on islands within sight
of Singapore Harbor they had been re-
quired to hold the Koran with their right
hand and, sitting before a table carrying
a kris, a pistol and a rope, took this oath:
“I pledge to be loyal to the Cause, and
I will not leak out my secret. If I betray
I will be killed with the pistol, I will be
stabbed with the kris, or I will be hanged
with the rope.”
In the well of one of the sampans was
a number of ikan layer fish. Into the
belly of each had been stuffed small arms
ammunition.
The Malacca Patrol continues tonight.


Where Kennedy Is King
So many mothers—and one TV son
By J. C. KAYE
Mr Graham Kennedy and his em-
ployer, the General Television
Corporation Pty Ltd (owner of
GTV-9 Melbourne, and partly-owned
subsidiary of Television Corporation
Ltd, of Sydney, owner of TCN-9) have
opened talks for a new Kennedy con-
tract. When its details have been com-
pleted, it will ensure the continuation of
30-year-old Graham Kennedy at GTV-9
to at least 1968.
Kennedy, also known as Gay-Gay, or
The King, began at Channel 9 in 1957
on about £1250 a year. According to
a GTV-9 publicity man Kennedy’s pre-
sent contract, ending in May, pays him
around £25,000, while leaving him free
for personal appearance and freelance
engagements which net him about £250
a time.
In 1957 he was a hard-worked little
man, on the set of In Melbourne To-
night (IMT) five nights a week, Monday
to Friday inclusive. Under his present
contract, he appears on IMT on only
three nights, Monday to Wednesday
inclusive. He also does not have to
memorise commercials in full as he
once had to, but ad libs from memorised
“pointers”.
These commercial details indicate
that at the GTV-9 set-up in Richmond
The King is a valuable piece of royalty
and care is taken to keep him satisfied.
GTV-9 are said to have insured him for
£250,000.
The returns obtained, however, are
obvious to Kennedy, his employers and
the Australian TV industry. As a for-
mula, the show —so long as it has
Kennedy—has everything—the ability
to help GTV-9 meet its requirements
in Australian acts, while pleasing spon-
sors and public and making a lot of
money.
IMT, a variety programme, has run
continuously since 1957 with breaks of
only four weeks each year, and has so
many commercials that the viewer
sometimes wonders whether it is a
variety programme with advertisements
or vice versa. I have counted more
than 20 taped ads, live commercials and
trade-namings in a one-hour IMT
performance. The secret of this (some-
thing that no one in Australia has been
able to copy perfectly)—is that the
sight of Kennedy doing a commercial is
a form of entertainment itself.
Between the commercials, and the im-
ported and local acts of the variety
show, The King is also a showman of
unusual personality, who can clown,
sing, mimic, dance, act a bit, quip, and
be both winning and mildly offensive.
He has mastered the problem of build-
ing intimacy between studio and parlor.
With his neat, boyish figure, his clean-
cut impishness, his drolleries and sar-
casms, his romping and mugging, his
shrugging insouciance he holds in thrall
a great and valuable army—the army
of Mums of Victoria. They show their
deep attachment by loving him and/or
hating him; flattering him and/or
abusing him. So many mothers—and
one TV son.
As a result, IMT—although it is not,
as I write, in the Top Ten of popularity
for Victoria—looks like running forever.
It may seem strange that IMT attracts
such public attention, and plays such
a role in TV journals, when its ratings
are relatively low.
It s obvious that the people who en-
joy reading about Kennedy don’t always
watch his programme. They absorb
minute facts about his private and pub-
lic life, from the way he collects old
lamps and lanterns to the oddity that,
for self-protection, he has arranged that
his cheques must have two signatures
beside his own. But at 9.30 p.m.
apparently they often take in some other
show.
From the point of view of the indus-
try, IMT, although not in the first ten
as a rule, is remarkable for its capacity
to sell goods to its viewers. Those who
watch do buy. Sol Same, a shirt-maker
who has grown from small-time to big-
time in a few years in Melbourne,
openly attributes his success to the
Kennedy personality. And, I am told
at GTV-9, there is a waiting list of adver-
tisers hoping to cash in one day on the
loyalty of the Kennedy following.
“I can't see any end to it,” Kennedy
told me when I saw him at his Frank-
ston home. “If we were going to meet
any fatal crisis we would have met it
by now.”
He went on, with a clear-headed
honesty which is one of his off-camera
characteristics: “I said to Mr Bednall
(general manager of GTV-9) not long
ago, ‘What happens if the years pass
and the ratings go down and down and
down until . . .?’ and he just answered,
‘Graham, we'll find a way to build them
up again’.”
Meanwhile, the other Melbourne sta-
tions continue hopefully to “straddle”
IMT with picked feature films and live
and syndicated shows covering all or
part of its 9.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. spot.
The King himself, with none of the
recuperation allowed to performers who
appear on TV only once a week, has
now been in, IMT more than 1500 times.
A lot of them have been first-rate.
Some, he admits, have been lousy. “I
feel "‘sometimes that I’ve lost the audi-
ence. They don’t laugh. My heart
sinks, but I don't panic now like I used
to. After a bad show I keep the audi-
ence back, perhaps 45 minutes, and
carry on, and send them away happy.”
King Kennedy has had comparable
success in other States, except New

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
South Wales, where, although Kennedy
programmes and connected excerpts
from IMTs have had a reasonable run,
the Sydney critics have slaughtered him.
Why? “It takes time,” he said.
“When lack Davey first came to Mel-
bourne, the radio audience wasn’t
knocked over. It took Jack about
eight years to get the appreciation here
he had in Sydney. The TV audience
there is different perhaps. The usual
term is ‘more sophisticated’. Then
there’s interstate rivalry . . . TV poli-
tics . . .”
The King is confident that he can win
a bigger Sydney following. Another
“national” IMT series is being prepared,
using not only Kennedy but other IMT
figures, such as Noel Ferrier and
Tommy Hanlon, and the Sydney per-
sonality, Jimmy Hannan, who has been
appearing with Kennedy here.
There is another way of looking at
the Kennedy Sydney failures, put to me
by the editor of a TV journal. “Gra-
ham,” he said, “went to TV from 3UZ
Melbourne where he had become quite
well known as the partner of ‘Nicky’
Nicholls, in their radio breakfast ses-
sion. He was very young, and pretty
raw, like so many people in TV when it
started. It’s doubtful if he would get
a job in Melbourne now with only the
talents he had then. He took to TV
the great audience of Mums and mar-
rieds he had on radio. He didn’t have
to create a TV audience from nothing.
In Sydney he has had to do this. It’s
not easy.”
Faster Effects
At Frankston, Kennedy told me:
“There’s no doubt that I have mat-
ured over the seven years I’ve been in
television. As I work now I have a big-
ger store of experience that I can draw
on.”
He’s interested now in ways of
achieving faster effects. He admires, for
instance, the quick blackouts in the TV
shows of Charlie Drake, the diminutive
English comedian with the falsetto
voice. He has learned, too, more of
the techniques of achieving comedy
with sexual allusions, shocking his audi-
ence pleasantly, without opening him-
self to criticism.
He now has such command of the
double entendre for suburbia that he
draws no more rebukes from the GTV-9
management. (He has never been cen-
sured by the Control Board.) When
he needs a joke in a hurry, he makes a
quip about something in the news out-
side of politics, which he prefers to
leave alone.
Kennedy, the only son of an unhappy
marriage (his divorced parents have
both remarried), is the son of a market-
stall holder. He went to Caulfield State
School and to Melbourne Boys’ High.
He did well at English and Art, but left
after taking his Intermediate Certificate,'
which Victorian children sit for at about
15 or 16.
He became interested in theatre
quite early, making his own sets of

Land on your feet in Queensland!
Wherever you look in Queensland today there are
opportunities for business development, large and
small. It’s just a case of deciding on the right place
for the right business.
Here your first, and lasting friends, could be the well
informed senior officers of Queensland’s Department
of Industrial Development. They will gladly give you
frank and objective advice on industrial sites and
premises with real potential for manufacturers.
It is the Department's job to assist manufacturers to
land on their feet in Australia’s great northern State,
with its diversified sources of raw materials, ample
power and fuel, and thriving population living in the
cities and towns of Australia’s most decentralised
State.
The prospective investor is warmly welcomed in
Queensland because there is so much to share and the
climate is so conducive to industrial expansion. Crown
land is available for industrial purposes on special or
perpetual leases which may be converted to freehold.

cardboard or balsa wood, and in photo-
graphy, which even as a boy he opera-
ted as a business. Odd jobs in an
uncle's city hairdressing shop, in Radio
Australia, and in 3UZ studios led to his
becoming a turntable boy at 3UZ.
When two lads senior to him were
called into the Army, Nicky made him
his juvenile partner.
When Melbourne TV began in 1956,
he was determined to break into it. He
even had his teeth improved in pre-
paration. Norman Spencer, of GTV-9,
spotted him when he went to the GTV-9
studios in 1957 to take part in a Red
Cross show being broadcast over both
3UZ and the TV station. For a time
he kept both his 3UZ and TV jobs
going, netting a total of £75 a week.
Gaining confidence then, he began his
five-nights-a-week IMT career.
Today he is king of the studio in a
real sense. His show, and his success
with it keep about 200 people, inclu-
ding a band and a ballet and a large
group of people behind the scenes and
on the business side, at work in the
style to which they have become accus-
tomed.
At the studio, he has his private cara-
van, equipped with refrigerator and
shower and other comforts. He has no
immediate hiring and firing powers, but
his word is pretty much law in what
and who goes on. There are script-
writers, but he uses or rejects their
stuff as he likes.
Few close jriends
TTis home at Frankston is a converted
60-year-old house, on a sloping site,
with a view of the sea. He has a grey
Mercedes which the studio gave him
(he found himself up for £lOOO gift-
tax) and a swimming pool.
He has been called “a recluse"’ and
told me: “I have a few close friends.
But you could count them on two hands
and have some fingers over.” He dresses
smartly, drinks a lot of tea. smokes
menthol cigarettes, enjoys beer as much
as anyone, shuns exercise, and is wor-
ried just now by a (to me unnoticeable)
touch of obesity.
People gawk at him wherever he goes,
and even follow his car for miles to get
his autograph. To go to a restaurant
or theatre becomes something of a
harassment, particularly when drunks
set out to rile him. People also climb
into his garden, and take pictures of
each other by his swimming pool. They
steal his flowers, and any loose objects,
such as drinking mugs, left on garden
tables.
Financially, in his own words, he is
now “sound”. He owns a 250-acre
dairy farm near Drouin. where land
runs at about £2OO an acre, and has a
share farmer on it. He spends a lot
of free time there. “The farm” gets
regular mention in the informal chatter
of his show. He also has other invest-
ments. “I realised I knew nothing about
business,” he said, “so I put things in
the hands of people who do.”
I mentioned Kennedy later to a man
who has seen quite a bit of him. He
remarked: “Graham is like the mana-
ging director of a business. The busi-
ness is Graham Kennedy. He sees
himself very largely in a detached sort
of way, but is vitally involved all the
same.
“As things have turned out, I think,
frankly, that he is a bit stunned by the
success and money that have come to
him, a onetime working-class boy. He
has kept his head. He's no prima
donna, or snob, and he's no baby-kisser.
He's all right.
“You can't get very close to him,
but you can’t help wishing him luck.”

The Ordeal of
Peter Thomson
How is God?
By PATRICK TENNISON
History might like to recall some
day that it began in Melbourne
shortly after 8 p.m. on Decem-
ber 9, 1964. An Anglican priest said
on a television programme that he did
not believe in God.
A bit bald? Let’s look at the type-
script of the programme. The inter-
viewer was the ABC’s Gerald Lyons.
The programme was his regular Wed-
nesday - nighter, People, on ABV-2.
With Lyons was the Rev. Peter Thom-
son, vicar of the parish of St James in
Melbourne’s north of the Yarra, light
industrial and residential suburb of
East Thornbury. Lively and youth-
minded Thomson had been asked in to
the programme primarily to talk about
an off-beat Chistmas Eve religious-cum-
variety entertainment for young people
he had helped arrange and was to com-
pere. Lyons began probing also for
some of the young cleric’s other uncon-
ventional ideas. He asked Thomson
if he believed in God, “as a Supreme
Being, distinct and apart from the
world”.
Thomson: “No, I don’t.”
Lyons asked was Thomson, a practi-
sing minister of religion, in fact an
atheist.
Thomson: “In this sense, yes. In
another sense, no. Definitely not.”
The pertinent issue was confused,
rather than helped, by the added pre-
sence of another clergyman with simi-
lar, though not identical, ideas. But
here, it seemed, was an Australian
minister, at last, who was game to take
up publicly a line similar to the one
the Bishop of Woolwich had espoused
in his original controversial article in
the English newspaper “The Observer”
and in his book “Honest to God”
which was published almost two years
ago in England. In this book, the
Bishop hacked away at what seemed
the very core of Christian belief as it
has come down to the 20th century.
He started with a swishing away of
God as a bearded father figure, ulti-
mately going what some would call the
whole gamut to condoning some in-
stances of extra-marital sexual inter-
course.
Thomson’s TV interview concentra-
ted mainly on the God aspect. After it,
he fell publicly silent. This silence of
a seemingly outspoken minister puzzled
many Church and non-Church people
anxious to know or at least to hear
more. In fact, he had been cautioned
by some of his Church colleagues to
stay silent. Others urged him to give
the topic an Australian ventilation that
they felt must come one day. He
finally agreed to co-operate for a
Bulletin interview.
Pender Street in East Thornbury,
where the St James’ Church and vicar-
age stand, is a haphazard affair with
two hefty kinks in it and an assortment
along both sides of tired-looking, lower-
middle-class homes, most of about
First World War vintage. St James’
Church, with its white-painted walls and
red corrugated iron roof, looks slightly
older but just as wan. Fittingly, it
seemed in this context, the adjoining
vicarage is a brisk, contemporary, semi-
ranch-style affair.
Thomson, his wife Helen and their
two children all seem composites like
this of what is old and new in Church
life. He wore his “dog collar” with a
bright blue unclerical cardigan. With
the orthodox suburban church providing
a background to the vicarage back gar-
den, his wife played there with the
children who were in similarly bright,
modern, casual wear. Thomson’s earn-
est expressiveness and the recent months
of worry over inward and outward argu-
ment have made him look somewhat
older than his 28 years. In interview
conversation, he speaks out well; most
times still in the style of the fluently
sincere sermoniser, even when the site is
non-pulpit and his big-windowed vicar-
age study. His words come in a torrent
of ideas and quotes from religious and
secular authorities. Failing in a word
or a phrase, he will dive to his book-
shelves for an authoritative check.
Often his words trail into overlong,
sometimes incomplete, sentences. He
struggles to retain correct measures of
malt and yeast in his theological brew.
When occasionally it might spew over
in a mess of word ideas, he hastens to
mop it all up again with some deft
logical polishing.
“It’s not a case of either/or,” he
stresses firmly. ‘'lt's both/and.
“What I believe and what so many
in the Church throughout the Western
world suggest leads to a new dimension
of thought and structure in the Church.
“What it does mean is the end of the
reign of dogmatic thinking, whether of
the 4th, 16th or 19th century; that is,
this dogmatism as an end in itself,
whether the Church holds it as a neces-
sary condition of salvation or not. It
means a re-examination of the teaching
of those times in their historically de-
termined situation and to see them as
honest expressions of the thinking of a
pre-scientific age.”
He punctuates his explanations with
the suggestions and arguments of a wide
range of writers: Woolwich’s Bishop
Robinson and the “Cambridge school”
of course, as well as Freud, the Ger-
man martyr Bonhoeffer, the urgent re-
former Paul Tillich (his favorite),
Bultmann, Barth, Nietzsche, Kierke-
gaard and a host of others.
As Thomson sees it, they are all
fighting for greater enlightenment and
they all fit a pattern, even Marx, in
their attempt to leave the past to the
past if necessary and to live and join
in the creation of the present and the
future. He doesn’t pretend to have all
the answers. On the question of the
Hereafter, for instance, he says: “I’m
living and I know this and I experience
at times what Bonhoeffer called the
Beyond in our midst. But I don’t as
yet know of a spirit world separate or
apart from my existence which often
seems to be taken for the Hereafter.”
Basically, he feels deeply that it is
time the Church had a cleaning off of
a lot of the “encrustments” that have
adhered to it over the ages—mentally
and practically.
Man comes of age
TTe explains: “Nowadays there’s a
phrase ‘man come of age’, which
means that scientifically man, in his pre-
sent world view, can explain the universe
without recourse to the God hypothesis.
If you keep to the pre-scientific world
view, which is the traditional dogma of

the Church, you’re writing off a great
number of people who find it meaning-
less. They number perhaps even more
than those the Church feels it is pro-
tecting in its attempt not to befuddle.
The stumbling block and millstone work
both ways.”
On the question of God he says: “To-
day, with the big breakthrough of
existential philosophy in men like
Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, we at least
know what God is not.
“Then there is Tillich, who is
accepted as one of the leading philoso-
phical theologians, who has called the
earlier theistic philosophy of men such
as Hegel a delusion based on the unpar-
donable separation of pure thought from
existence. Hegel overlooked real exis-
tence, with all its intrinsic struggle and
pain. As well as Tillich, others who
have opposed the Hegelian theories have
included Feuerbach, Marx, Kierkegaard
and Nietzsche.
“Kierkegaard even went so far as to
say that the God of pure essence, who
is infinitely distant as the summit of all
values, serenely crowning all the beau-
tiful and good, a God above the clouds,
is dead! He will not speak of God
apart from existence—apart from ‘my
existence’. This is why Tillich can say
in another context —and Bishop Robin-
son agrees with him —‘The protest of
a-theism against such a highest Person
is correct’.
“Huxley contents himself with say-
ing, ‘For my part, the sense of spiritual
relief which comes from rejecting the
idea of God as a supernatural Being is
enormous’.
“Some, like Feuerbach and Nietzsche,
have felt even more strongly and have
suggested that this is the God they must
kill, as it is the greatest enemy to man’s
coming of age.”
But, abolish or kill the bearded
father figure God and what is left?
Thomson reasons: “Only when you
etch out the god of supernaturalism can
you discover God. In what concerns
you ultimately, you discover not a Being
but rather Being itself—Life belonging
to Life. You are grasped by Being
itself and you discover that the courage
to be is rooted in the God who appears
when the other God disappears in the
anxiety of doubt.
“This is only possible when we look
at the picture of Jesus as the Christ and
discover Him, in Bonhoeffer’s phrase,
as ‘the Man for others’.”
Getting right down to it, Thomson
sees that the Church’s biggest battle was
fought in the 4th to 6th centuries over
the whole question of Christ.
As we know, those early century
Church “battles” centred on the question
of whether Jesus was truly God and also
truly Man—it finally being agreed that
He was both—and how this had come
about, how it was to be handled in
dogma. Thomson now transposes the
context of all this to 1965 thought:
“In the picture of Jesus as the Christ
as that picture is embodied in the scrip-
tures we can say that we are grasped
by the medium of final revelation. We
learn that he who possesses himself com-
pletely surrenders himself completely—
to the uttermost. This is seen on the
Cross. This self-emptying love, this
agape, is the climactic breakthrough of
man to the ground of his being, Being
itself.
“By His life and work, Christ can
best be expressed as ‘the Man for
others’. The Cross has been and con-
tinues to be the stumbling block and
rock of offence to modern man. Unless
we see the Cross as the symbol of the
Man for others, we can't know God.
This is what Christ was. And if we
can’t act Christ in our lives, in our com-
mitments to others, we can’t know God
in the abstract or in action. Even if
we pray all day or read our Bibles all
day or lead so-called good lives, we
benefit nothing at all because it would
not be grounded in the Cross. It would
not be in the precept of the Man for
others.”
A Westernised Christ
Tf all or much of this is at first hard to
grasp fully, Thomson’s other argu-
ments, whether constructive or destruc-
tive, help paint a broader picture. For
many, some aspects of that portrayal
might have disturbing or complicated
results. For instance, he flays most
Western artists of all ages for providing
us with a smugly Westernised, tall,
commanding, white-skinned Christ:
“It’s the same old story —‘if oxen had
hands to draw, they would draw God in
the likeness of an ox’. Do you realise
that if Christ was in the flesh now he
would never be allowed to live in Aus-
tralia? We know from research that
Galileans of that period were the color
of North Africans. If not completely
black, they were certainly colored.
And, as well as being swarthy, most
were short. What a mess this, for
instance, makes of some Christians’
attitudes to race issues!”
In this new wave concept of religion,
conscience as the religious world has
long accepted it, goes right overboard:
“There's no such thing as conscience
as we’ve been taught it for generations;
that is, as the inner voice of God direc-
ting moral actions,” Thomson believes.
“This utterly false belief has enabled
the Church to be a party to some of
the most inhuman atrocities in the his-
tory of mankind. One need only cite
as examples the Inquisition, the Euro-
pean religious turmoils and the early
United States witch hunts. And when

a man like Barth charges Tillich with
trying to fight the inquisitor, as if any
human organisation is destined to have
this problem—especially the Church, I
clap my hands with joy to think that
Tillich is concerned enough to fight it.
“On the contemporary scene, we see
the resigned attitude of the Church to
the Western neurosis of exploitation—
the lust for money and power —which
no longer threatens to destroy our civi-
lisation but is in fact in the process of
doing so.
“When Paul borrowed the term ‘con-
science’ straight from the ancient
Greeks, it expressed nothing more than
the experience of pain or guilt following
an action—not before it. When the
Latins, in their more practical frame of
reference, took it over it was given the
double meaning, thereby enabling moral
judgments. This was how we got the
frighteningly demonic creation of the
system of casuistry.
“But as I said before, the only cri-
terion of morality in any form is in
terms of the Man for others, in the pic-
ture of Jesus on the Cross. In our
language it can be expressed by the
word ‘love’. Or, as St Augustine has
said, ‘Love God and do as you like’,
which is no doubt conditioned by what
we mean by loving God. This surely
brings us back to the Cross and the
Man for others.
“Thus conscience, as the sum total of
conscious and sub-conscious guilt ex-
periences associated within our mental
framework, can be nothing more than
a negative ‘Thou shalt not'. And the
Church is not true to the life of its
Founder if it continues to foster this
idea which only leads to an abyss of
anxiety, doubt and meaninglessness. It
fails if it refuses to acknowledge the
desperate need to leap, risk or chance
that in commitment to the Man for
others is the only criterion of creative
and life-giving action. This is only pos-
sible as I commit myself in the Christ
act with my fellow man. The faith of
the Man for others is characterised in
Jesus’s story of the Good Samaritan.”
What of divine inspiration and reve-
lation?
Existential situation
HThomson again: ‘ Man is created in
A the image of God. Perception of this
is in direct proportion to a person’s com-
mitment to ‘do the truth’, the Christ
act. It is certainly not the exclusive
prerogative of the Church and, in many
cases, the Church in its existential situ-
ation finds it necessary to kill or crucify
those who bear its testimony.
“This was the case with Christ —
killed by the Church of His day—and
it has been with many charged with
heresy under the inquisitional attitude
of the Church as it attempts to defend
what it calls truth. But truth is its own
criterion and, as such, hardly needs
defence.”
What about the Bible and the Creeds?
“Yes, I accept them both as very
necessary. The Bible confronts us with
the questions of ultimate concern and
patiently directs us to the point where
we are grasped by Being itself. That
is, I know myself to the point where I
realise that I am not myself. And I
find that although unacceptable I am
declared acceptable by Being itself. At
this point, I know I am free to choose
to live as the Man for others or to die
unto myself. The Creed I accept as
a necessary statement of faith of a pre-
scientific age which directs me to what
is really ultimate concern for my exis-
tence. I do not accept it as the end in
itself, but rather as a signpost that can
or can not lead me to the God of my
existence.”
The Commandments?
‘This is more or less like the question
of conscience. They are limited as
means, but only to those grasped by the
reality of the Man for others, which has
no limit. The Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath.”
The Church?
“This is too big to comment on in
an undertaking of the size of this one
now. But, in passing, it seems to me
that it is only the Body of Christ in so far
as it expresses existentially what it is
essentially, in its commitment to the
Christ act, the scandal of the Cross.
It is only the Church when it exists to
serve the world in the role of the suffer-
ing servant committed in agape to the
world. This makes nonsense of the
truism that the Church is perhaps the
most conservative force in society,
backing the status quo rather than
daring to take risks—even if proved
wrong. Vested interests in however
subtle a form plague the Church as it
does many other organisations. As the
Archbishop of Canterbury said at the
1963 Anglican Congress in Toronto
when he called the whole Anglican
communion to a programme of mutual
responsibility: ‘A Church that lives unto
itself will die unto itself.”
On this point Thomson likes the story
of a man who fell into a deep well and
found he could not get out. Buddha
appeared at the well top and suggested
as a way out: “My son, believe you are
not there!” Next came Confucius to
the well top and asked if the man had
followed Confucian teachings. “My
son,” said Confucius, “you could not
have followed my teachings or else you
could not be there.” The man appealed
next to Christ for aid. Suddenly, he
saw Christ standing in the well beside
him.
On the Trinity, Thomson says: “This
is excitingly presented in terms of
existential analogy. But if it means, as
often expressed in modern interpreta-
tions, tri-theism, then I agree with
Bishop Pike of San Francisco who says
it should be abandoned, because it is
meaningless.”
The clergy?
“The system of professional clergy-
men as constituted today, especially in
the parish set-up, is devastatingly in-
effective in terms of manpower but also
on the question of position. I often
doubt the validity of what has become

in many ways a caste system. I com-
mend wholeheartedly the lay movement
in the Church towards a fuller share in
the ministry of the Cross.
“I realise that these views are sure
to be as destructive in their effect as
constructive because they hit hard at
much that seems sacred and taboo.
And when it comes to the point, there
are few who can see the both/ and. We
are all inclined to choose either/or.”
Black versus White
T>ut he sees the new dimension he
sketches as the only possibility for
real ecumenism “one that transcends
in language and structure the opposites
of the past.”
Pessimistic about the future of civi-
lisation, he sees the end to the present
structure as unavoidable.
“Not that this will mean the end of
the world,” he quickly adds.
“The Church will find itself plunged
into the horror of black versus white
and the inevitable clash of East and
West. Let us hope to God we find the
Cross in time to be effective witnesses
to it.”
Denuded of myth, he sees the Church
making it possible to discover once
again what he calls the real cause of
offence to man, the Cross:
“It is forever forcing people into a
decision, like a kid on the edge of a
swimming pool. He has been taught
the theory, but will he dare take the
plunge? Unless he does, he can’t live.
Because he has never been prepared to
lose his life. This is when we are hit
by the picture of Jesus as the Man for
others.
“Prayer, in its reflective aspect as
meditation, becomes honest and logical
thought. Prayer in action becomes the
commitment of ourselves to others in
the Christ act.”
Thomson sadly finds the attitude of
the Australian church in general to this
new dimension far more apathetic than
the Church in England, where he spent
his last two years; one in a Cambridge
curacy, the other as vicar at a nearby
village. He is disappointed, too, that no
Australian churchman older, better
known, more widely experienced and
“acceptable” than himself in this
country has been willing to raise the
points he now raises. In Britain, the
US, France, Holland and, only slightly
differently perhaps, in Rome, questions
like these are soul-searchingly debated.
Peter Thomson says they can no
longer be put to one side in Australia.
As he speaks out now, he recalls the
words of St Augustine which were re-
peated by the Bishop of Woolwich in
his book and which seem eminently
repeatable here and now: “To say
something, however inadequate, is bet-
ter than silence.”
Letters to the Editor
Open letter
To the Minister for Customs
Dear Senator Anderson,
As it seems probable that you have
mislaid my letter of November 10 last
in your files, I hope you don’t mind if I
begin by reviewing briefly the history of
my negotiations with your department.
Whilst holidaying in Britain last July, I
mailed a parcel of books to myself at
my Sydney address. Upon my return in
September, I was informed that two of
my books, “The Ginger Man” and “The
Fourth of June”, had been seized by your
ever-vigilant officials. Evidently your de-
partment subsequently satisfied itself that
the latter book had not dealt adequately
with the more interesting aspects of the
life of the boys at Eton, for it was re-
turned, in a well-thumbed condition, to
me. “The Ginger Man”, however, turned
out to be a “prohibited import”.
At this stage, I wrote to you, asking
you to reconsider your decision, and
suggesting that a discussion between us
might be of help. In reply, you not only
rejected the suggestion of a discussion
(as serving “no useful purpose”), but
stated categorically that you were unable
to approve of the book’s release to me,
on the grounds that I would put it to
“personal use” were I to receive it. (Just
what you mean by “personal use” is, I
confess, obscure to me, but it is evidently
improper. Perhaps there is a suggestion
of deviant sexual behavior in it?)
Undeterred by this, I then wrote again
to you (on November 10) asking you to
provide me with the reasons underlying
the decision to seize my book. As I
pointed out then, it is surely unreasonable
of the Government, whatever the formal
legal position may be, to expect a citizen
to institute legal action in order to dis-
cover the reasons behind an administra-
tive decision which affects him adversely.
Since then, no reply . . .
While I realise that you have been
busy in the intervening period (we all
know the harrowing uncertainties of run-
ning for the Senate as No. 2 on the Gov-
ernment ticket), I really must insist that
you do me the courtesy of a reply. Per-
haps I may revive my suggestion for a
discussion in an amended form by chal-
lenging you to a public debate on your
action in seizing my book?

SlR.—Let us keep the record correct.
In writing of William Joyce (8., Jan. 9)
one cannot but agree with Geoffrey
Scott that his voice was not a joke.
This voice, described by Geoffrey Scott
as grating and sardonic, was not only
these things. It was the voice of an
Englishman aping his social superiors.
From a Devon farmer to a London
University professor the conclusion
independently reached was the same
as my own this was the voice of
“the servant when he reigneth”. And
we could not answer back. I did not
meet anybody who did not switch him
off half way through and go to mun-
dane or wash tasks with more energy.
Churchill’s “fight them in the hills”
speech rallied us from a carefully un-
spoken individual sense of defeat by
fatigue. But as he finished it was the
subtle half-memory of the Joyce voice
that made me act and perhaps made
my dear, mild ever-peaceloving mother
approve me (with my little children and
a dying father in the house as hostages
to fortune). She said: “What are you
doing, Mary?” I said: “I’in putting
the big coal hatchet behind the scullery
door for the first German officer who
walks in here. You persuade him to
sit at the kitchen table (we had only one
fire) and I’ll let him have a dong on
the head.” She said: “Very well. But
don’t say ‘dong’!” I think this was
typical.
Joyce made it certain that if England
were invaded as we expected there
would be nobody outside the resistance.

would cut a third of what was written,

SCIENCE
Sodom
and Gomorrah
By Dr ABRAHAM MARCUS
How do people behave after an earth-
quake? Two psychiatrists writing in
“The Lancet”, one of Britain’s
leading medical journals, tell of their
experiences in Skoplje, Yugoslavia, im-
mediately after the earthquake there in
July, 1963.
They had been sent as part of a
psychiatric team from the Institute of
Mental Health in Belgrade and reached
the scene next day. Skoplje had been
almost totally destroyed; of a population
of 200,000 more than 1000 had died and
3300 were injured.
Generally the psychiatrists confirmed
the experience of others in previous
catastrophes the heavy bombings of
World War 11, Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
other earthquakes —in which three-
quarters of the people had mild mental
disturbances. Although the great majority
recover quickly, only one-quarter of the
population is capable of actively helping
immediately after the disaster.
This was the case in Skoplje. They
tell of 20 lorry drivers detailed to take
bodies to the cemetery. A few hours
later only four were at work and they
continued for days.
There was no mass panic. In a few
days two-thirds of the survivors were
evacuated. Immediately after the earth-
quake people herded together. No one
wanted to be left alone. Families clung
together and separation of parents and
children was especially hard to bear.
Children evacuated to children’s homes
in other districts began to wet the bed at
night.
In the immediate aftermath there were
some cases of near-psychotic disorder
which soon recovered. The commonest
response was a combination of sluggish-
ness and apathy.
In a few days, as stupor diminished,
came fear and depression. Repeated earth
tremors occurred and people would
spring up ready to flee. Even the barking
of a dog produced this escape reaction.
Adults expressed their fear by talking
and dreamt of it at night. Children ex-
pressed their fear in play about the earth-
quake and burials.
Superstitious rumors were rife, especi-
ally among the older people “The
earthquake had come because people had
lived too well.” As in the story of Prome-
theus, pride had defied the gods and
brought retribution, or sinfulness had
earned a terrible penalty as in the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah, (ofns)


REVIEW
ART
Provincial Portraiture
By FRANK COZZARELLI
Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prize Ex-
hibition. Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney.
At this year’s Archibald, no prize was
awarded; critics have attacked the pass-
ing over of Eric Smith’s portrait of
Leonard Hessing and Sam Fullbrook’s of
Dr J. F. Cairns. Here The Bulletin’s
new art critic discusses the whole vexed
question of the prize itself; next week
he will analyse the individual paintings.
Eventually the Archibald and all other
art prizes must go. They are repugnant
because no collective, jury arbitrated
selection and evaluation is worth any-
thing.
Critical wrath should be brought to
bear on precisely those aspects which
most endear the Archibald to the public:
1. “Distinguished people are honored
for their accomplishments.” The portraits
promote the myth of the “self-made”
Australian. (Vulgar chauvinism.) This
a priori school of thought insists that
every sitter be socially prominent,
educated, gentle and refined yet easily
capable of digging ditches all day to stop
a bushfire (hands are always painted
strongly). Like Procrustes, they cut or
stretch the guest to fit the bed.
2. “The pictures look real.” The
Archibald ideology binds its adherents to
immediately verifiable surface “facts”,
thereby undermining their power of
objective judgment and in the end cuts
them off from reality altogether. This
parochial attitude is self indulgent in its
disregard of the inalienable responsi-
bilities inherent in the name “artist”. To
the self-proclaimed cause of humanistic
art, mirror images are a betrayal. A
portrait should seek that which is unique
in his subject, extracting and distilling for
the sake of the distillate, and this, of
necessity, requires a considerable degree
of abstraction and distortion. Realistic
rendering may be dismissed as nothing
more than a lurk to drive up the price
of photographs.
3. “The artists are famous, their work
easily understandable.” The Archibald
has hardened into a social institution and
its winners accorded social prestige and
rewards. This can only be possible pro-
vided they supply symbols readily
sanctioned by convention, familiar
through repetition, therefore, by defini-
tion, imitative. Symbols function in a
compensatory way, soothing the conflicts
of the conscious mind assuring the
symbol Simons that nothing is so
irrational, secret or difficult that it can
not be explained in a simple way. The
assumptions, principles, methods and
goals of the Archibald are unworthy of
and should be held in contempt by
creative artists.
4. “The technical excellence de-
manded upholds standards.” What is
most striking about this exhibition is the
incredible unawareness of the history
and development, of the need and use
of art rather than its manufacture. Art
is and has always been man’s best tool
for uncovering knowledge about himself;
psychiatry, science, religion or what have
you notwithstanding. To use it to re-
hash the familiar is a serious abrogation
of duty and privilege.
5. “It aids the cause of art.” Illusion-
ist devices are in violation of the central
aesthetic purpose which has nothing to
do with someone’s reflections on the tip
of the nose but with bringing out signifi-
cant elemental forms, not seen before,
enriching experience and cultivating a
new awareness, a heightened sensitivity,
a widened sensibility.
While all sensibilities are self serving
to those who promote them, the Gallery
and exhibiting artists can be fairly
criticised for disseminating a moribund,
discredited, empty art of cosmetics.
Sydney lacks a serious “pilot” gallery
that would promote an involvement and
commitment on the part of the public
to contemporary art. Nowhere in any
comparable sized city outside Australia
would one find a comparable institution
willing to house the Archibald.
6. “It promotes activity in a neglected
style.” The image of man has so shrunk
and become repellent after two world
wars that any depiction of it, to be valid,
must reveal the terror, scars and loss of
grace as well. Simplistic nostalgia for
the old reveals disenchantment with the
present and an unwillingness to revitalise
it. The paintings are styleless in the
historical sense. The style of this century
is predicated upon urban intransigent
abstractions. Absence of style indicates
decadence. Story - telling realism tends
to be the only thing a provincial artist
can do and the one thing an urban art
can do without. So, too, the bland for-
mality and anonymous factualism, sup-
ported by the Archibald traffic with mass
culture. It is Venus that is desired, not
Waltzing Matilda.
No sooner do the jurors mark up a
score for rigid selectivity, by failing to
give the Archibald a flawed hero, than
they erase it with the wide-of-the-mark
gesture of finding two winners for the
Wynne. It is a landscape prize worth
£2OO. The trustees of the Art Gallery
of NSW came up with £2OO more of
their own scarce funds and honor Sam
Fullbrook once more, for the second
consecutive time, and David Strachan
for the second time as well. They
are the winners only by courtesy of the
jurors. A nearby Fred Williams is
easily their superior. While one may
always quarrel with judges’ decisions (it’s
too late anyway, the money’s gone) the
real cause of contention are the paint-
ings themselves.
The Strachan is a fuzzy, romantic
snapshot of someplace, ostensibly in
color but faded to a near black and
white. Color is reduced to a handmaiden
of line serving to ignoble function of
shading forms. Shading is a dirty word
in painting and Strachan should know
better than to use it.
The Fullbrook, at first glance, appears
more sophisticated. There is an attempt
to build forms with blocks of color, to
have background recede and fore-
ground advance due to the capacity in-
herent in hot and cold colors to seem
to do this.
The Sulman award went to Ken
Reinhard for a collage, assemblage,
papier-colle, geometric abstraction, comic
strip, drawing, painting. It is hard to
know what to make of it since he didn’t
know either. Entitled “The Private
Public Preview”, it would seem to be a
vicious roasting of the Hungry Horse
Gallery's gambit of inviting potential

day before the critics come around.
Reinhard has attended one, and although
he bites the hand that fed him, his satire
has no teeth in it. He depicts a silly-
looking crowd of culture vultures and
has lettered unlettered remarks issuing
from their mouths as in the manner of
comic strips. But he avoids offending
the dilettante dullards by refraining from
giving anyone illustrated a speaking
recognizable likeness.
That it is the art world of hot-eyed
pursuers of the latest “fads” that is Rein-
hard’s quarry is attested to by an attrac-
tive little geometric Vassarely-like
abstraction, painted on a separate can-
vas and attached to the main picture.
That the hunter is this time the victim
is evidenced by the fact that the ridiculed
abstraction is the best part of the paint-
ing. Reinhard’s strength is his directness
of non-verbal statements stripped of fussy
tricks of painting. He is good and brash
and loud. As yet he is not too clear.
of harm are heard less often now.
Events have proved them wrong. Most
television is harmless, some of it is very
good, for a mass entertainment medium.
The dangers are in the best shows not
the worst, and only if their excellence
can lead us to illusion as “The Defen-
ders” and “Breaking Point” might.
In “The Defenders” the Prestons are
represented as men who live by Law,
believe in the Law, and are credits to
it. “The Defenders” is a well acted,
well produced series which might easily
convince any of us that respect for the
Law, and a constant cleansing of its
processes, are well left in the hands
of the lawyers.
“The Breaking Point” offers a more
dangerous illusion than “The Defenders”.
Its central character is a psychiatrist
who appears to cure the patients who
attend his idealised clinic with a sor-
rowful look and infinite understanding.
This, too, is as far from the realities
of Australian clinical treatment as Goldi-
locks and the Three Bears. And because
lack of understanding and lack of
finance, untempered by public pressures,
is holding back desperately needed im-
provements and facilities for treatment
in our own mental hospitals, any popu-
lar series which deludes the public into
a sense that all’s well calls for a note of
warning.
Estimates vary from one in five to
one in every seven members of the
public who will need this form of hos-
pitalisation some time in our lives.
There will be no Dr Thompson sorrow-
ing over us and giving his understand-
ing. There will be treatment varying
from drugs to electro-shock, in large
wards of people loosely classified as
patients at a similar stage, but actually
ranging from near-sane to near-
demented, from children to old people.
If education depended on one teacher
to every 100 school children of an
ability range from cretin to genius, we
would refuse to tolerate it. We do not
see the real world of the real Dr
Thompsons, or the true dramas of peo-
ple who have passed breaking point. So
we continue to tolerate mass treatment,
where a more individual treatment is
needed, and we lengthen or deepen the
torments of mental illness.
No one can blame “The Breaking
Point” for this. I would not miss an
episode. But it and “The Defenders”
are dream stuff and it is as well to keep
the distinction clearly in mind. The
laws are imperfect and the best lawyers
are too busy to care. A sane person
forced to spend a week in a mental
clinic would very likely end as a patient.
The Prestons and Dr Thompson are,
like Fairy Godmothers, ideals and not
realities.
FRANK ROBERTS
PERTH FESTIVAL
A Cultural Spree
If it has not quite come of age, the 13th
annual Festival of Perth is proving a
very precocious teenager; with a more
mature attitude towards publicity (which
had hitherto been haphazard) the Festi-
val has been given a national coverage
for the first time. Even some of the
popular magazines have given space to
Perth’s cultural spree. And it has been
a success so far: better films, more
varied music, and certainly more out-
standing drama, than on other occasions.
Robin Lovejoy’s production of “Othel-
lo”, which officially opened the Festival,
provoked criticism because of an almost
continually changing interpretation
caused by the theatre itself. Many of
the formal actor-audience barriers dis-
appear in the theatre’s extraordinarily
intimate atmosphere. The players
seemed to be feeling their way, using
the big apron stage increasingly boldly
and building new relationships with the
people in “the pit” and around them on
the corridor galleries.
Ron Haddrick’s Othello earned brick-
bats because he was not considered
black, brooding, or boorish enough for
the part. He was no Anthony Quayle,
it's true. But he could be taken to task
only on the score of interpretation,
giving an aesthetic and fine-feeling
Othello instead of the jealous barbarian
expected.
As Desdemona, red-haired ABC pre-
sentation anouncer Jennifer West was
beautiful and talented, but perhaps too
mature and statuesque for the role. This
tended to point up the lack of raw
virility in Haddrick’s performance.
“Othello” has been alternating with
“A Winter’s Tale” at the New Fortune
(the Shakespeare season closes on Febru-
ary 10). “A Winter’s Tale”, although
plagued by the kind of technical hitches
that so annoyed Robin Lovejoy, attained
an effective simplicity of style, despite
effects like the complete freezing of
background players to focus attention
on those who held the stage. Frederick
Parslow as Leontes tended to over-
emote, but Judy Wilson was workman-
like as Queen Hermione.
Before the Festival’s formal opening,
the programme of drama began with a
heavy Russian story, adapted to the
stage, produced and played by the one
man on a drab set; certain ingredients
of boredom. But Melbourne’s Peter
O’Shaughnessy, brought across after
having played the same role in Cork
and Dublin, crammed Gogol’s “Diary of
a Madman” with all the tricks of a
trade he has mastered so well.

The Hell of Negroes
By DAVID MARTIN
Black Voices. Edited by Herbert Hill. Elek.
• 50s.
America it is to thee
Thou boasted land of liberty,
■ It is to thee I raise my song,
Thou land of blood, and crime, and
wrong.
James Whitfield, a Negro poet, published
these lines in 1853, and Herbert Hill
quotes them in his introduction to “Black
Voices.” With a little more sophistication
they could have been written today.
Today’s Negro still sings of America as
a land of crime and wrong, but his song
is still raised to her, however deep in
anguish.
The problems of the Negro writer
staggers the outsider. Try as he may, he
cannot be anything but a Negro; more
than for his African brother his color
conditions his reality as artist and man.
If one thing stands out from this collec-
tion it is that the Negro writer’s gigantic
striving for universality is limited by a
consciousness of race which, if he would
forget it, is again and again imposed on
him by his environment. (Think of Joyce
having to write from the standpoint of
Parnell.) If freedom is the recognition of
necessity, it is only by acknowledging
bondage that he can be free. New per-
spectives, new terms and symbols may
arise “Africanism”, “Negritude”
but they do not yet mark a qualitative
change. In all essentials Langston Hughes
and Leßoi Jones have to address man-
kind from the same plot of ground,
material and spiritual, as Whitfield occu-
pied. Their opportunities have grown
considerably, the complexity of their
situation immeasurably, but the dynamic
remains the same.
It is the complexity which forces itself
on our attention. The creative Negro is
a man between three worlds: the white
in general, the white American, and the
black ghetto. Speaking, as he must, for
the dark man, he is alienated from that
sector of his society, the middle class,
which in others promotes the rising in-
telligentsia. His alienation is more com-
plete than is the white writer’s, and more
harrowing because it disrupts the concept
of race (nationalism would probably be
a better word) which shapes him. He
cannot be in the full sense an American,
nor in the old sense a Negro. If he once
believed that there was a special Negro
quality a vital elan, an immediate re-
sponsiveness to the elemental that
would make his contribution unique;
looking at his own bourgeoisie he can no
longer believe even that. As Prof. St Clair
Drake points out in his essay, “The
Dilemma of the American Negro Scho-
lar,” this special quality eventually evap-
orates under urbanisation.
In the ’thirties, during the second wave
of the Negro renaissance, many of the
best Negro writers sought closeness to the
folk through adherence to the Commu-
nist Party and the industrial ethos, but it
seems to have been a passing phase.
Their approach to the resurgence of
Africa also appears to be cautious and
tentative. It has some of the ambivalence
of Diaspora Jews to Zionism, possibly
engendered by what happened in Liberia.
Strangely, there is no reference in this
collection to the Black Muslims, but then
it has nothing in it half as important as
Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time”.
Indeed, it is not in its own right a
very remarkable book. Only half-a-dozen
stories and essays could claim much
merit, and, with the exception of one,
they bring us no new illumination.
Nevertheless, to the non-American reader
“Black Voices” is valuable. One has to
take it as a whole, feeling oneself into
the total atmosphere it projects. That the
most gifted Negro writers work from
Paris, Rome or Mexico City makes no
difference, or, rather, their double-exile
helps to make the atmosphere what it is.
The exceptional piece appears at the
very beginning, Horace R. Cayton’s
sketch of a holiday spent at Sinclair
Lewis’ home. This is memorable in its
clear-eyed view of pathos, with Lewis,
lonely, disillusioned and seigneurial in
spite of himself, clinging to his Negro
servants for democratic assurance, but
not able to give them anything in return.
It is the best thing I have read on the
tragedy of a certain kind of liberal.
Much of the collection’s material is,
if only implicitly, autobiographical, and
among it the extract from Katherine
Dunham’s childhood takes first place.
“The Creek” is quite beautifully written,
though there is nothing especially Negro
about it. It simply tells of a girl freeing
herself from bleak surroundings domin-
ated by an unhappy father, whose love
for her has incestuous undertones. With
powerful, unsentimental recall it reveals
the artist at the first cross-road of emo-
tional decision. Only the segment from
Baldwin’s “Go Tell It On the Mountain”
can survive next to it. It is of course well
known, but one is glad to find it because
it is equally strong on two fronts, as in-
sight into self and as a masterly depiction
of the Harlem milieu.
Of what pertains to the United States
directly, Langston Hughes’ “Rock,
Church”, Ted Poston’s “Rat Joiner Routs
the Klan”, Benjamin A. Brown’s “Thun-
der at Dawn” and “Out of the Hospital
and Under the Bar”, by Ralph Ellison,
will leave their impact. “Rock, Church”
is the tale of an ambitious pastor who
has himself “nailed” to the cross in his
downtown chapel. It is very funny, even
more than this author’s sketch, also in-
cluded, about what befell a group of
Negro actors in Moscow. “Rat Joiner” is
unusual: it treats the Ku Klux Klan from
a humorous angle. “Thunder at Dawn”
primitively but effectively exposes the
sad experiences of a Southern bellhop
who, when a white client wants to rub
his head for luck, proposes to rub the
other’s in exchange. Ralph Ellison gives
us an original draft-chapter from his
Kafkaesque novel, “Invisible Man”, in
which the real and the symbolic strait-
jacket merge in the mind of patient and
reader. It has the visual intensity of a
Fritz Lang film.
Ellison, with Richard Wright, Claude
McKay, William Motley and James Bald-
win, are the great figures in modern
Negro literature, leaving aside the play-
wrights and Countee Cullen, the poet, as
well as Langston Hughes, who is also
best as a poet. Cullen and McKay fall
outside the boundaries of this anthology,
and Motley is represented by a crudely
propagandistic piece which does no jus-
tice to the author of “Knock On Any
Door”. Richard Wright’s last and un-
finished novel yields five Paris episodes
in his characteristic vein of angry irony.
To think that a Natchez plantation boy
could run the entire gamut of protest
from socialist realism to existentialism!
Chester Himes, another Left-Banker, fol-
lows in his path with a passage from
“Lonely Crusade” which epitomises the
very spirit of frustration.
There are proud flashbacks to slavery
and emancipation, a reasonably good
story by Dorothy West on the status
seeker who passes white, and other bits


and slices of varying juiciness. Taken
together, they ask* the question: “Who
are we?” and, naturally, give a score of
answers. Few anticipate the time when
the only question worth asking will be:
“Who am I?”
A short verse section rounds off the
volume, but selected too much at ran-
dom to be really helpful. Gwendolyn
Brooks, far more impressive as poet than
story writer (which, I think, is equally
true of Leßoi Jones), seems to draw with
the same ease on the traditions of the
Blues and on Auden, to produce some-
thing stolen from neither, and Langston
Hughes’ translations from non-American
Negro poets hint at bridges that, chal-
lenging to be crossed, yet exist mainly in
the imagination.
“Black voices” is a bad metaphor. It
recalls Satchmo. I would have spoken of
black keys, for it’s on them that this
tune is mostly played.
Drab Allegory
Trial at Monomoy. John Masters. Michael
Joseph. 265. 6d.
A Child Possessed. R. C. Hutchinson. Geof-
rey Bles. 265. 6d.
The man of action turned writer is an
attractive figure. John Masters shares
with Kipling the ability to lay out the
crazy quilt of India, and with Conrad an
ability for strong plot. But the troubled
subjectivity of Conrad and the elegiac
obsessions underlying the action are
missing; and this has proved Masters’
undoing. It would be silly to carp at
Masters for not being a Conrad, were it
not for the fact that this is the direction
he has now tried to take: towards the
higher reaches of art. What we are of-
fered, in “Trial at Monomoy”, a story of
a small New England community threat-
ened by storm and flooding from the sea,
is, according to the blurb: “. . . like Pil-
grim’s Progress’ and ‘Moby Dick’ ... a
huge allegory of the mid-20th century.”
It is huge only in its boredom, and an
allegory only in painful intention.
In fairness it is necessary to ask what has
gone wrong.
We go along with it for a while: the
town is threatened with destruction;
Remington, in charge of the coastguard,
warns the civic leaders and is not pro-
perly heeded. There follows a tediously
predictable parable of selfishness and self-
sacrifice, with revelations of character
under pressure when the populace takes
refuge in a holiday hotel. The pushing,
he-man tycoon is revealed as a latent
homosexual; his frustrated wife goes on
a nymphomaniac binge; a loose society
woman panics and attempts suicide, and
so on. When a popular writer strains for
“significance” the pitfall that awaits him
is a quite simple one: sooner or later he
puts a strain on the reader’s credulity.
This has happened to Masters, and it is-
an embarrassing thing to see in the
author of as good a book as “The De-
ceivers”. The strain on credulity is two-
fold: firstly, in ham-handed and extrane-
ous symbolism married to drab realism;
secondly, in a disastrously unbelievable
ending which suddenly tries for naked
parable. Some ordinary seamen from a
wrecked Spanish freighter, together with
their captain, solemnly try to decide
whether the Americans are worth saving
which the Spaniards have the means
to do on philosophical grounds. They
discuss “The Iceman Cometh”, and
sound like a Madrid version of “The
Critics”. Finally, Masters’ writing has
taken on with uncanny exactness all the
bad attributes of American writing of the
post-Hemingway-and-Faulkner period,
making sex sound like an operation for
piles, and conveying the itching feeling
that nothing of what is being said will
ever matter. The characters are mere
specimens from a psychiatric casebook.
Violence has to be practised on them to
make them seem to matter. But, alas,
they still don’t.
R. C. Hutchinson could not provide a
better contrast. He is thoroughly Euro-
pean: he cares about his characters, and
he makes us care. He convinces us that
an imbecile girl, daughter of a Russian
truck-driver in Marseilles, is not only
worth caring about but has a terrible im-
portance. He deliberately sets us great
obstacles. The girl is so retarded as to
seem less intelligent than an animal; in
her fishlike eyes there seems no human
response. The question is posed: is her
father right in taking her away from
one of the best institutions in Europe
(where his estranged wife, a wealthy
actress, has placed her) to care for
the girl himself in a tiny slum room?
Stepan, the father, a Russian intellectual
who had ended as a truck-driver because
of an inability to commit himself to nor-
mal ambitions, is portrayed with intelli-
gence and great understanding of the
Slavic temperament. He is a saint-figure
whose virtues are believable; only such
a man, cheerful in the face of the public
spectacle the girl creates, driving his
truck with her strapped at his side, seems
capable of the sacrifice the story portrays.
His achievement is small; he gives her a
sort of happiness and gains response
from her. But we share his joy, and rea-
lise that this is a love story. Normally, I
would consider Eugenie not worth the
sacrifice. Yet Hutchinson forced me to
share Stepan’s passionate religious con-
viction that locked inside his daughter
was a soul as important as any other.
Hutchinson is not a writer of great
stylistic originality; he is sometimes trite;
yet this story of the pain and joy of a
special love seems more worthwhile than
most contemporary writing: certainly
more worthwhile, for example, than Nor-
man Mailer's dismal hymns to the
orgasm.

Desires and Scruples
The Jealous God. John Braine. Eyre &
Spottiswoode. 265.
Summer’s Tales 1. Edited by Kylie Tennant.
Macmillan. 255.
One suspects, rather cynically, that John
Braine, author of “Room at the Top”,
wrote his new book with the box office
in mind. The formula adds up. Sex, more
than implied, religion the hot issue of
Catholics versus Protestants, and a pat
solution happy or unhappy, depending
upon one’s outlook.
Vincent, the hero, is a decent fellow
mixed up by his environment. His mother
seems most to blame. She has prayed for
him to enter the priesthood, longed for
it from the day he was born. At 30 he
still vaguely considers the idea, but his
sex impulses are too strong to keep the
prospect seriously in mind. Nor can he
be really interested in the nice Catholic
girls his mother favors.
There is nothing really unexpected
about this rather pedestrian book. One is
not surprised that when Vincent does fall
in love, the girl is a Protestant, and a
divorced one at that. Vincent is now torn
between his desires and his religious
scruples. The girl’s feelings appear
secondary. It's a dilemma that crops up
all too frequently in real life and causes
much unhappiness. Someone has to suffer
no matter what solution is found. In this
case a few unhappy scapegoats solve the
problem for Vincent and his mother.
The novel is rather too melodramatic
to be taken entirely seriously, but at
least it does show how better feelings can
be twisted by convention and prejudice.
“Summer’s Tales 1” is a book of short
stories by fifteen Australian writers. Each
one, as editor Kylie Tennant writes in
her note, tackles life's problems, paro-
chial or universal, differently.
Margaret Dick in “Summer Sunday”
writes with a piercing clarity and
subtlety. Her story is beautifully con-
structed, and with a discriminating econo-
my of words emphasises the poignancy
and tragedy of a young girl’s death and
the merciless censure of society.
“Another Melba”, by Patricia Rolfe,
is about an expatriate Australian spinster
who went to Paris years before to pursue
a singing career. Though her success was
never great, she deludes herself that she
could never have led an “ordinary” life
in a Sydney suburb, that her career has
been far more satisfying than marriage.
And Kylie Tennant’s “The Antago-
nists” points up frustration and hopeless-
ness the frustration through ignorance
of an old farmer because he cannot

Exactly why Rupert Inglis went into poli-
tics neither he nor anyone else knows.
He’d wanted to join the Foreign Office,
but failed and so became a history tutor
at an Oxford college. Politics he sees as
some sort of compensation, like the
James Bond Bentley he drives ostenta-
tiously and rather guiltily. But the Bent-
ley has the wrong image for the cam-
paign, so he is not allowed to use it;
instead he leads around a ridiculous bull-
terrier called Chamberlain which his
James Bond girl gave him before she
deserted him. But Chamberlain with his
embarrassing name (giving the wrong
political image again) isn’t Rupert’s only
problem. There’s Lady Inkerman, the
nymphomaniac wife of the Tory lord;
the visiting African who tries to rape the
wife of one of the liberal pro-African
Conservatives; the procession of Young
Conservative motor cars . . . “The Short
List” isn’t at all an original novel; it
owes too much to “Lucky Jim” without
managing to be so funny; in the farcical
scenes the really comic is somehow
missed. But it is continually entertain-
ing, with, like the policy Rupert and
David Walder (himself a Conservative
MP) represent, nothing serious to cause
any disturbance.
Andrew Shonfield’s main character is
also academic, though his extracurricular
activities are not as a politician but as
a TV personality. Suddenly at a party
Geoffrey Cutlass finds his sense of his
own personality (as opposed to the TV
one?) shifted from himself to a position
nine to twelve inches above his head
at an angle of about 45 degrees. And
with this science fiction idea established,
we suffer Geoffrey’s experiences, which
would seem to involve a discovery of his
Self and a recognition of his egotism.
“A Man Beside Himself”, despite its
brevity, manages to be boring. This
is not just because the characters are
only sketched in, but because there
seems no reason for their being in at all.
Underneath the stylish modernness, the
quasi-metaphysics, the hints of the ab-
surd, the bits of psychology, there is the
awful pointlessness, not of Geoffrey’s life,
but of Mr Shonfield’s novel.
After four years of marriage, Emma
has had two children but no lovers.
Amazingly, too, her actor husband David
Evans has been faithful to her. Then
came “that Garrick year, as I shall always
think of it”, when she accompanies David
to the wilds of the English provinces
where he is acting in a drama festival.
Emma tells the story herself, in a straight-
forward, simple way that allows her to
state things directly many a more com-
petent novelist would spend weeks trying
to insert carefully and suggestively. But
Miss Drabble has a no-nonsense direct-
ness, and, as in her much-praised first
novel, succeeds in presenting the per-
sona of a self-satisfied, cultured, tasteful
and typical unpleasant sort of Oxbridge
girl. There is an accomplished tape-
recorder realism, especially in the bed-
room quarrels and breast-feeding sequen-
ces. There are tart little observations
about house furnishings and theatrical
egos. But Miss Drabble aims for more
than just this and has produced a novel-
length book. She has devised a plot,
which limps sadly along from quiet anti-
climax to quiet anti-climax, dropped milk
bottles, an off-stage suicide, the near
drowning of Emma’s daughter, and of
course the central scene. There, Emma
and the man whom throughout the book
we are kept in suspense about (will she
sleep with him or not?) arrive in the
garage where David is just zipping (up
or down) the girl he’s been playing oppo-
site. But for those who like their fiction
easy to read and read many times before,
this alternative choice of the Book Society
should while away a heavy wash at the
launderette.

It is not easy why I’m linked with you—
humans involved are outside all the laws
and we are taunted by a point of view.
Our rhythms meet the way a dancer’s
do—
love can be lifting, another love can
pause:
it is not easy why I’m linked with you
but love knits each void that we are
meeting through.
Since we have different loves for all the
flaws
we are taunted by a point of view.
Our marriage skids, persists—and is
made new.
Yet I admit (and want no saving clause)
it is not easy why I’m linked with you.
We have our glances I believe are true —
then hear in silences the rain’s applause
and we are taunted by a point of view.
In confidence our alien eyes pursue
and doubts exalt what innocence
ignores—
that it’s not easy why I'm linked with
you
and we are taunted by a point of view.

Kaiser Bill
The Kaiser and His Times. Michael Bal-
four. Cresset Press. 635.
Once when Kaiser William II visited a
colonial exhibition in Berlin he was
shown the house of a Negro chieftain
with the skulls of his enemies hanging
on poles outside. “If only I could see
the members of the Reichstag strung
up like that!”, the Kaiser said to his
suite. It was a characteristic remark —•
half-jocular, impulsive and arrogant. It
was the sort of thing the Kaiser went
on saying from the day he succeeded
to the German throne until the day he
fled into exile in Holland. No wonder
he kept his ministers in a perpetual
state of dismay and most of Europe in
a perpetual simmer of alarm.
By judicious selection from among
the Kaiser’s pronouncements it would
be easy to build up a picture of a classic
royal megalomaniac, if not a royal
lunatic. “We Hohenzollerns derive our
crown from Heaven alone and are
answerable only to Heaven”.

Colin Simpson is no propagandist for
anybody. He is a fluent, observant, talented

The result is a big book, in both concept

educated, objective manner one has come
to expect of Simpson through a series of
excellent travel books.

Having set the stage for it, Simpson traces
the rise of the modern communist State
in Russia from its rickety beginnings,
patiently unravelling plot and counterplot,
and lucidly delineating the leading charac-
ters in a drama that rocked the world
forever.

Whatever Simpson has to say, good or
bad, is said forthrightly, with humour,
compassion or indignation as the circum-

Angus & Robertson
shows that William was a more complex
character than this. Behind the facade
of the “knight in shining armor” (as
the Kaiser once described himself to the
Austrian Emperor), behind the bluster
and drill-sergeant obsession with military
parade, was a neurasthenic, a creature
of romantic fancies and uncontrollable
impulses with the temperament of a
prima donna. “The Kaiser is like a
balloon,” Bismarck once remarked. “If
you don't keep fast hold of the string
you don't know where he will be off to.”
The trouble was that, after Bismarck
went, there was no personality in Ger-
many strong enough to keep a tight
hold on the string.
Politicians, according to the Kaiser,
were “utter cads” who must be con-
fined to their proper function of voting
funds for more battleships and loyally
supporting whatever imperial aims their
master happened to be pursuing at the
time. It was the privilege of service
chiefs and diplomats simply to tender
advice and then receive their orders.
While Germany’s economy was boom-
ing, while her industrialists were cap-
turing one new market after another,
it was possible to get away with such
a system. Chancellors might grumble
privately about the Kaiser’s unpredic-
table moods, about the alarms and sus-
picions he scattered all over Europe,
but the great mass of the German people
were quite contented under the regime.
If the Kaiser was making Germany
feared as well as respected, so much the
better.
The old myth about William’s per-
sonal responsibility for World War I
has long been exploded. Balfour shows
that the Kaiser took a long time to
come round to the view of his naval
and army chiefs that war with England
was inevitable. When he finally did so he
was still subject to fits of terrible appre-
hension at the prospect. The English,
he once declared, “belong with us in
the great Teutonic race which Heaven
has entrusted with the culture of the
world”. (Thirty years later the old exile
of Doom greeted the news of Hitler’s
persecution of the Jews with the out-
burst “For the first time in my life I
am ashamed to be a German!”) The
strange love-hate relationship with Eng-
land dominated the Kaiser's outlook
throughout his reign. As a young ruler
he regarded his grandmother,
Victoria, with the deepest awe. Though
he affected to despise Uncle Bertie
(Edward VII), he passionately envied
the easy, genial, country-gentleman life
of the English monarch and his court.
He wanted to be liked by the English
and was moved to tears when he was
cheered by the crowd on one of his
visits to London.
Unfortunately, whenever it appeared
that Germany, England and France
might be drawing together, at least in
peaceful co-existence, William indulged
his f a { a ] gift for impulsive dramatics
sending a telegram to President Kruger
or a wars hjp to Morocco. If German
political leaders had had the guts, to
stand up to William’s hectoring and his-
trionics, the course of 20th-century
events might have been very different
indeed.
Balfour’s 450-page book is heavy
going in parts. He seems to have been
infected by a kind of Teutonic literary
sententiousness and ponderosity. It is,
however, a good deal more than a mere
“life” of the Kaiser and provides a
solid, well-documented survey of Ger-
man political and economic life in the
generation before 1914.
GEOFFREY SCOTT
Autumn, 1939
Each morning, we would go out
And see smashed helmets, limbs,
Piles of black rubble,
Children on doorsteps, aching
With the fierce light, and blazing
Clothes, black shoe leather crumpled
like licorice.
Bearing nets we passed through fields,
Grass stroking knees with wet knives,
To collect severed heads, schoolboys
Whistling in the light, hooting
At the air raid warning,
Chattering at the drumming of huge
bombs.
We were paid by the hour for those
limbs,
Then on gaunt trucks, they’d go
Like fasces, tied with rag strips,
To the mouths of incinerators
There to be gobbled like chips.
And we’d sweep the ashes with birch
brooms.
That first September was good.
Fleece in blue sky, humming
Things probing, the first keen
Sharpness of lichen smells,
Lemon and honey in the throat,
Muscles pricked by fine hay.
What if the planes kept going
Out over the bright channel?
The death-lists, the life-breath
Cancelled each other out.
All right, they died there, splintered to
pieces
In a hail of flak. We were discovering
love.
One day we ran out in the rain,
Stripped to the waist, not men
Yet, our limbs scarcely swelling,
Or chests broadened with struggle.
And we laughed, gathering the wet in
handfuls.
Knowing what was to come.
Years of dirt, hands
Sweating to the barrage sounds,
Compasses, bombing maps of Rome and
Dresden,
Balsa-wood planes, Hitlers with gap
teeth,
Uncles lost in their wing-sewn coats,
But a fierce stinging in the veins.
Let them wage war, let them wage it.
We were young, and too young to be
in it.

Unseen Employment Statistics
School leavers have an important distinction these days.
Whether they are out job-hunting or sprawled on the
beach pondering what to do, they are an unreported
factor in official statistics. So how can you assess the figures
of registered unemployed when many young people do not
even bother to register?
Talk to any fifth-year student during December and he
or she cannot tell you if they will be looking for a job in
January, going back to school, or entering the university.
Then, in January, ask those who passed and those who
failed in the Leaving what they intend to do and, more
particularly, ask them if they rushed to the Commonwealth
Employment Office to register for unemployment. Those
who decide to seek employment often use their own initia-
tive to rustle up a job. Sometimes, after failure to land a
job, they may register with the Employment Office.
Then again, after failing to land a job, some go back to
school. But these figures are not shown in the unemploy-
ment statistics. The number of people registered for jobs
rose by 17,400 to 54,000 in December, including those still
affected by the Mt Isa strike and by the cessation of seasonal
work. Also included would be those young people who had
temporary jobs over Christmas and were looking for fur-
ther employment, even if temporary.
By no means could these figures include all the young
people who will be looking for jobs in 1965. Nor will they
t all appear on the unemployment register in January. Pride,
'independence or initiative encourage them to strike out on
their own before they become a statistic. Some of them
remain an unknown statistic, riding the waves, borrowing
from their parents, perhaps even being sent off to a business
college after failure to locate a job.
There must be thousands of these unknown statistics
which would lift unemployment figures above 54,500 yet
be ill-equipped in many cases to fill the stated job vacancies
of 61,500 (these jumped remarkably from 49,600 in Nov-
ember).
Fewer Intermediate age students are available on the
NSW market this year because of the Wyndham school
syllabus, which now restricts the percentage of leavers after
third year at high school. Even so, there were 14,113 boys
under 21 registered for unemployment in December and
15,524 girls (compared with November figures of 5555
and 9537).
Job vacancies are stated to have increased by 11,900 in
December but registrants under 21 increased by 13,545.
Add to this the unknown statistics arising from Leaving
Certificate results and the nation’s unemployed figure could
rise well above 60,000. On these figures, the labor position
(in the younger age group) is not so tight for junior white
collar workers. The skilled labor section is still exception-
ally tight and some of these jobs are not even notified be-
cause of the known non-availability of skilled technicians
(who have to be brought from overseas or pinched from
someone else).
Soft Shoe Treatment
TVd provide Britain with a long-term loan to solve her
A current payments crisis, it is being suggested that
unencumbered sterling and dollar balances of IMF members
should be transferred to the IMF and that holders of these
balances should be given a gold-convertibility guarantee.
However, this would require an undertaking from the US
and Britain not to ask for any drawings from the Fund for
at least two or three years.
Europe needs to be convinced that Britain can solve her
problems, but the image has not been improved by latest
reports that a projected £750 million deficit will be incurred
by the UK aircraft industry unless the TSR2 project is
scrapped. A narrowing of Britain’s trade gap in December
was heartening, though Europe’s central bankers are won-
dering if this is a flash in the pan.
Since France’s recent move to convert some of its reserves
into gold, other European nations have indicated they are
not wedded to the idea of inconvertible dollars. The pro-
jected conversion has forced into the open a situation where
Europe’s central bankers admit the need for a change in
the international payments system and that it is useless to
accumulate dollar and sterling balances if they are not
fully convertible. It has been demonstrated that the US,
although undertaking to convert dollars into gold, cannot
meet a persistent run on its gold reserves.
France, and other members of the Common Market, now
have indicated a willingness to help in any loan arrange-
ments for Britain. They would also like to see Britain’s
15 p.c. import tax waived as a condition of helping her
meet the economic crisis. Britain, on the other hand, has
been told by the Government that she must retain the import
surcharge at least until September if she is to have any
chance of solving her payments deficit.
Against this apparent impasse, the central bankers went
into a huddle at their regular meeting in Basle early this
month to consider how the stop-gap loan to Britain can be
renewed, preferably on a long-term basis Without some
workable support for sterling, they realise that European
currencies could be undermined.
Although convinced that Britain has not done enough
(or is incapable of doing enough) to solve its economic
difficulties, they evidently are prepared to hold off until
April to see what further moves the Wilson Government
takes to ward off devaluation.

MOUNT ISA MINES LIMITED
to the People
Mount Isa Mines Limited offers no apology for reporting direct to the
people of Australia the facts of the industrial dispute, now in its
twenty-second week, and referring to it as a national tragedy—a
completely unnecessary tragedy.
Because the Company has always adhered to the principle of arbitration,
it has refrained up to the present from making any public announce-
ment on the issues involved, believing that it should not do so until
every possible means of obtaining a settlement had been exhausted.
But now, the facts must be told—in plain unvarnished language.
9 Employees of Mount Isa Mines Limited
at Mount Isa numbered over 4000 men
and women drawing wages annually of
nearly £8,000,000. Capital projects
provided work for another 800 contrac-
tors' employees. Minimum male adult
wages were £26/14/4 per 40-hour
week. Contract miners averaged more
than £5O per 40-hour week. Some
earned over £6O per week.
9 Refusal by the Queensland Industrial
Commission of Union claims for a wage
increase of £4 per week and a demand
by local representatives of the Aus-
tralian Workers' Union that the Com-
pany should ignore the Commission's
determination and reach a separate
agreement triggered off the dispute.
A ban on contract work imposed by

9 An order by the Industrial Commission
directing members of the Australian
Workers' Union not to participate in
an unauthorised strike and the declara-
tion of a State of Emergency by the
Queensland Government were flagrantly
disobeyed.
# Copper production ceased. Under-
ground employees who had refused to
obey the Orders were dismissed and
other employees stood down.
# A once prosperous and happy com-
munity was plunged into a major
industrial crisis. Disruptive forces con-
tinued an active campaign to prevent
a return to work.
# An increase of £3 per week, totalling
£600,000 a year, granted by the Indus-
trial Commission on 24th December,
1964, raised the bonus and prosperity
loading to £ll per week and the
total minimum wages to £29/14/4 per
week. Workers at Mount Isa Mines
thereby received total bonuses and
loadings over and above wages of
more than £2,250,000 per year. Despite
this, the strike continued.
9 At a 10-day conference between Union
and company representatives at Mount
Isa, Industrial Commissioner Harvey
made every effort to effect a settle-
ment. The Commissioner's proposal to
report on the outcome of the con-
ference and recommend a return to
work to a mass meeting of A.W.U.
members on January 16, however, was
frustrated by irresponsible elements
who broke up the meeting.
# The due processes of the law have been
abandoned for direct action. The
welfare of men, women and children
has been sacrificed to the personal
ambitions of ruthless men. The course
they have followed can only serve
interests hostile to Australia.

I11 Winds from Overseas
Realism called for in Australia
T>lunted horns of the early January
market bulls bear witness to the in-
fluence unfavorable overseas influences
may prove to have on stock exchange in-
vestment in Australia this year. Equally,
these winds might be expected to temper
the general economic pace and require
less direct action by the monetary
authorities to contain the bursting full
employment economy. The guarded views
being taken by share markets in the last
two weeks are entirely realistic.
Though the authorities can hardly wel-
come the possibilities of the economy
suffering from lower export income,
which, together with the possibility of
reduced capital inflow, are implicit in
economic trends in the UK, if not so
much in the US and Japan, at least the
failure of home-grown flowers to bloom
means they can rest more easily for the
time being. A “little” Budget in February
can now be ruled out and rather less
weighty call-ups to SRD be expected in
the next few months than would other-
wise have been necessary.
The warning on export prices has been
there for several months and is now
being posted in more positive form by a
retreat in London metal prices. This re-
treat is admittedly patchy for the rea-
son that the world statistical position in
most metals and commodities is still
strong and by and large prices have to re-
flect the huge problems faced by the UK
in getting its balance of payments back to
a viable basis, not to speak of making
the economic adjustments required by
the socialist policies of its new Govern-
ment.
As yet Australians probably haven’t
begun to understand the magnitude of
these problems. Even in the UK itself we
find the usually reliable observers at
sixes and sevens. For instance, last week
the London “Economist” and “Investors’
Chronicle” were advising different
courses for the Government to take on
the 15 p.c. surcharge on imports, which
the Wilson Government put on as an
emergency measure soon after coming to
office. The “Economist” urged it not to
remove the surcharge until November at
the earliest, whereas the “Investors’
Chronicle” said it should be dropped at
the earliest opportunity.
A correct reading of the situation may
be that 1965 is going to be a long battle
to save sterling, that pressure from the
big international bears of the currency
is going to be on all the time in expecta-
tion of devaluation being forced some
time during the London autumn. More-
over, and this is the more immediate
point for us, economic activity in the
UK will be forced downwards with the
consequent reductions in demand for im-
ports of commodities and raw materials.
At the same time, the outflow of long-
term capital from the UK will be on a
greatly restricted scale. This makes a
doubly implicit impact for us. Even if
our own overseas reserves position may
look historically strong, we must expect
it to be substantially and progressively
eroded as the year wears on.
We have to realise that if production
and employment are still holding up re-
markably well in the UK (even after
four “crisis” months and a 7 p.c. Bank
Rate), this is largely because the econo-
my is still bowling along on the strength
of economic ammunition laid in during
last year’s boom, which the previous
Government on general admission al-
J. McEWEN
lowed to go on too long in face of serious
weakness in the balance of payments.
Nemesis is inevitable. The respite for
internal economic activity gained by three
billion dollars short - term support for
sterling can only, by its nature, be tem-
porary. The basic fact is that the econo-
my will have to take the strain of a
massive reduction in imports and this,
even on a conservative view, will have to
last for a couple of years, unless in the

ASK THE 'WALES' FOR DETAILS
interim a miraculous change comes over
the UK exports whose last year’s weak-
ness has so far not been repaired des-
pite new official incentives.
The chances of a massive expansion
of UK exports can not be rated very
highly in present world trade circum-
stances. The best that can be said to date
is that, after an indifferent year, exports
did very well last month and that the
trade gap was reduced significantly to
£stg6l million, compared with £lO3
million in November. The UK has been
going for a big export drive in Europe.
But this has been limping as exports
have been slipping badly, especially to
Italy, which has acute economic difficulty
at present. To make up for this, exports
to the US, the sterling area and South
Africa have been rising. The question is
whether these areas are going to take
more UK exports or less.
In the sterling area Australia will be a
crucial market. Last year we were fourth
on the list of the UK's customers, after
the US, Canada and Western Germany,
and on present trends we look a good
prospect. On the other hand if, as seems
very likely, our export income is going
to suffer, this is going to have adverse
repercussions on our imports from the
UK. Similar reasoning can be applied to
the demand for UK exports in other
sterling area markets. The process is
familiar enough. An all-round fall in
world prices for primary products would,
as so often has happened before, reduce
the importing power of the outlying
sterling area countries more than anyone
else. Taken together, and including South
Africa (no longer in the area), these
take a high proportion of UK exports.
Equally, if, as is happening, the UK
surcharge on imports (mainly of manu-
factured and semi-manufactured goods)
is cutting back UK imports from Europe
in the manner intended, then a revival
in Europe's demand for UK exports
seems to be ruled out at least until the
surcharge is lifted.
It need hardly be said, also, that given
the inevitability of restricted markets in
the UK, all these countries are going to
be looking elsewhere to sell their exports
and this means to a large extent markets
in which Australia and Japan are striving
to extend their interests. This field, which
includes, for instance, South-East Asia
and the emergent countries of Africa, is
bound to become a more difficult one for
the UK, whose success will depend on
whether the Wilson Government’s export
incentives are strong enough and if its
efforts to induce more competitiveness in
UK exports are successful.
A big question mark also lies over the
ability and willingness of the North
American market to absorb more im-
ports. This is, as it were, the 64-dollar
question. On the face of it, as the
United States is heading into another
year of booming activity with official con-
fidence in achieving a 5 p.c. increase in
GNP, America would seem to be a happy
hunting ground for exporters at large.
However, New Year reviews from vari-
ous US sources suggest that, while the
first half of the year will be very good,
activity there is likely to slacken off in
the second half. The only cloud on the
horizon seen, for instance, by the “New
York Times" in its 128-page survey of the
economy last week was the possibility
of a steel strike, though the journal also
warned against expecting indefinite pro-
longation of an expansionary cycle which
is now entering its fifth year “the
longest period of peacetime growth in
the nation's history”—and that Presi-
dent Johnson’s penchant for getting
things done on the telephone would, this
year, be worked overtime.
On the ground of absorbability, ex-
ports to the United States should at least
hold up very well for some time yet. But
many exporters from countries seeking
alternative markets there will doubtless
knock on the door in vain. No overall
solution to the UK's export problem
would seem to lie in that direction. On
other grounds the United States looks
better placed to absorb more imports.
For instance, it has made great strides
in getting its own balance-of-payments
deficit down. In the third quarter last
year it had been reduced to an annual
rate of 2.2 billion dollars, compared with
actual deficits of 3.3 and 3.6 billion
dollars in 1963 and 1962. But can it be
expected that at long last its tariff will
be made rather more liberal? On this
latter front the world will probably have
to keep keeping fingers crossed. Yet if
world trade and commodity prices take a
dive this year, we can at least rely on
Mr McEwen to rally the new world to
the cause and, for once in a while, he
may at least find in Mr Wilson some-
body in the UK to come strongly along
with him.

Getting a Stake in Land
Real estate prices shoot ahead
A survey of real estate on Australia’s
east coast shows widely varying con-
ditions. In Brisbane land for both resi-
dential and commercial purposes more
than meets the market demand In Syd-
ney supply and demand are matched,
with an emphasis on outer suburban
developments. In Melbourne there is a
shortage of land in developed areas and
more than enough in outer areas.
In Sydney and Melbourne a curious
situation exists with land for industrial
purposes. From the well-established areas
such as Alexandria, Zetland, Waterloo (in
Sydney) and Fitzroy, Collingwood,
Brunswick (in Melbourne) there is a
swing to further outlying areas. Black-
town, St Marys, Sunshine, Broad-
meadows all these are becoming popu-
lar with the industrialist.
Curiouser and curiouser, the land
vacated in the old-established industrial
areas is becoming harder to shift. One
agent in Sydney told of a block at Alex-
andria he had on his books for two years.
In Melbourne the same thing applies.
Some firms have established warehouses
on the old site. In a few cases they are
unnecessary. Transport and labor supply
are two of the principal causes of the
change.
The land market apparently did not
suffer greatly during the credit squeeze.
That is to say land owners, except in a
few cases/ were not forced to sell at a
loss. Prices stagnated (and stabilised).
Since 1960 they have increased by up to
30 p.c. Agents The Bulletin spoke to
all agreed on one point: anyone con-
templating a land purchase should do so
now before prices go higher.
One agent said that prices had spur-
ted ahead in the last twelve months.
“Land priced around £2OOO to £2500 is
increasing in price in greater proportion
than the land around the £5OOO-£6OOO
mark,” he said.
Mr C. Benhiam, federal sales manager
of Hooker-Rex Pty Ltd, described the
land market as “buoyant. Prices recently
have risen 10 to 123 p.c. One of the
causes of this is the development of sub-
divisions. As soon as we develop an
estate prices go up 20 p.c. when the pur-
chaser reclaims his expenses like legal
costs, rates and taxes, etc.
“And the land values will not stabilise
in the next five years unless there is
some economic restraint. There is large-
scale development of outlying areas now
because of the shortage of land close to
the city. In the next five years or so
there will be redevelopment of older
areas, when all the available land is taken
up. In these areas land is getting scarcer
and scarcer, and people are asking far
too much for it.
“The greatest trouble developers are
facing today is development costs and
the high specifications required by coun-
cils. Some are being forced out of the
game. The provision of amenities such
as roads, water and sewerage to every
block of land is very costly and means
that capital is tied up for quite a while
before the developer can get his money
back. Some councils now require you
to lodge with them money for the pro-
vision of footpaths.
“Unfortunately in Sydney the speci-
fications and standards required for the
provision of these facilities vary from
council to council. Some require wider
roads or more land for parks and gardens
than others. While this goes on the price
for these amenities cannot be stabilised,
and neither can the cost of land.”
Mr C. S. Dyson, managing director of
C. J. Munro Pty Ltd of Cronulla, said
land prices along Sydney’s coast had
forced buyers inland. “Land along the
coast is becoming very rare and when
it is available the price is very high. It’s
a vicious circle really because, when
people move away from the coast, land
in further goes up in price. For instance
land at Miranda that two years ago cost
£l6OO is riot available now for under
£2400.”
An agent in the Manly - Warringah
area, north of Sydney, said that, while
demand for land was good and steady,
the supply often could not meet it.
“The demand for residential land today
is better than it has been since the re-
cession. As fast as land is put on the
market it is snapped up. Only recently we
had 24 blocks for sale by auction and
they all went very quickly.
“Commercial sites for small shops in
the area today are becoming very hard
to sell. Developments like the Warringah
Mall (one of the biggest shopping deve-
lopments in Sydney) have taken a lot
of the shine off the small sites. But
despite the shortage of land business
should be pretty good in the future.
The population grows by 6000 to 8000
a year here and they must live some-
where.”
As far as industrial land is concerned
both Sydney and Melbourne are similar.
Some agents The Bulletin spoke to in
both cities felt that the move away from

traditionally industrial areas would start
a much-needed decentralisation. One
went so far as to say there was a possi-
bility the old sites would eventually be
re-used for housing.
The old sites are invariably difficult
to sell because of various factors, in-
cluding size, lack of room for expan-
sion and difficulties with parking and
transport thanks to narrow streets and
traffic congestion. Some firms have had
their old sites on the market for up to
two years.
Cheaper land in the new industrial
areas always proves more attractive if
a portion of it must be unproductive.
Ex-inner suburb executives have learnt
their lesson well. “Most companies
moving out today,” one said, “are
buying up two or three times as much
land as they need in an effort to pro-
vide for future expansion. Of course,
buying such as this is an investment too,
as any land not needed can usually be
sold at a really fat profit once three or
four years have gone by.”
A feature of Victorian residential real
estate business is the heavy emphasis on
auctioning at the actual site. “This has
maintained the general interest in pro-
perties at a very high level,” a spokes-
man for the Real Estate and Stock
Institute said.
In Victoria too, headaches have been
caused by the councils’ kerbing, gutter-
ing and drainage requirements where
any big development is made. Land
prices are now higher on estates be-
cause of this. However, the general
opinion was that customers did not mind
paying extra for made roads and the
like. “Better to get it over and done
with than to be called on for extra cash
a few years hence when the council
finally got around to building a road,”
one agent said.
“Building blocks are under-supplied
in the well-populated suburbs now and
usually fetch a good price,” an agent
said. “The really choice blocks are few
and far between in the newly developed
areas, though there are thousands of
normal sites for buyers to choose from
without there being any serious over-
supply. There is in the really outward
areas, of course, but these have always
been bought with the long-term in view
anyway.”
“The land market in Brisbane is very
well supplied,” one Brisbane agent said.
“In fact you could say it is over-
supplied. With such an over-supplied
market we were hit hardest of all in
the credit squeeze, yet it has come back
very strongly. Naturally, being a small
city, prices are lower than Sydney or
Melbourne. A block in Sydney that
costs £2500 to £3OOO is available here
for £l5OO. Prices have not increased at
the same rate as they have in the south-
ern cities.”

Implications of ICIANZ
A cleverly conceived issue
gigantic premium issue to be made
to ICIANZ shareholders rounds off
(presuming it is not just another stage)
what must be one of the most startling
few months of expansion in Australian
industrial history. Only six months ago
first moves to raise £6 million in notes
were announced. In September the group
completed a £4 million deal giving it con-
trol over Australian Fertilisers. In Dec-
ember, plans were revealed for the spend-
ing of £9 million on extensions to the
Botany plant, a joint petro-chemical ven-
ture at Kurnell was announced involving
£l3i million, and a £l4 million share
deal was completed with the English
parent to make Fibremakers a wholly-
owned subsidiary.
Probably even more startling, how-
ever, is the fact that the issue will lift
paid capital to £49i million almost
double the £2si million at balance date
in 1961. Directors have arranged for the
money to be called in over 18 months,
so the increase will not take real effect
until balance date next year which is
not quite so arresting.
The previous issue to shareholders was
more generous, being one-for-four at a
7s. 6d. premium in 1961. Prior to that
was the 1957 issue, a two-for-five at a
ss. premium only.
Generosity necessarily diminishes with
the growth in paid capital and the rise in
share prices. The current issue will raise
a total of almost £10.4 million, which
is not to be sneezed at. It is the third
largest issue made by a public company
in Australia. BHP holds the honors with
a £16.1 million raising in 1961 and £10.6
million in 1959, both issues at par.
ICIANZ's earlier one-for-four premium
issue raised a total of £8.7 million.
Baiting Repco
T ast week’s strong recommendation
by Automotive Components’ direc-
tors to accept the revised takeover bid
from Repco chimed accurately with the
words of The Bulletin on p. 40 of the
January 9 issue. Briefly, the article
pointed out that the rejection of the
original bid was merely a bait to in-
crease the value of the offer, which
Repco obligingly decided to do.
ACL directors cannot be criticised for
the manoeuvre, especially as it was suc-
cessful. Why did they decide, though,
in their acceptance statement, to virtu-
ally admit that the rejection was not
very genuine?
In the first place the acceptance by
shareholders was “strongly” recommend-
ed. Highly unlikely, as the revised bid
was only a few pence higher—not
enough to warrant such a change in
attitude. In the second place the ac-
ceptance statement said no other offer
had been made —this contrasts, although
not directly, with earlier statements that
approaches had been made. Third, as
if the second was not serious enough,
directors openly pointed out that cash
returns and growth prospects were
greater by accepting the offer, two fac-
tors which were noticeably absent in
the original non-recommendation.
There’s danger in displaying one’s
apparent cunning so openly and it’s
hardly the moral to show up one's
savior.

Success Story
HThe oft-predicted, long-awaited bonus
issue from the Dandenong (Vic.)-
based Minster group of carpet compa-
nies has finally come through. As ex-
pected, it will be a one-for-three and the
directors are of the opinion that the 20
p.c. dividends will continue untouched.
No doubt there is some disappointment
among the real optimists, who were
punting for a one-for-two on the
strength that such was the ratio back
in 1959-60, while three-for-four was
handed out the time before in 1956-57.
Around £547,000 will be capitalised,
lifting paid capital to close on £2.2 mil-
lion. The 1959-60 issue involved a
similar amount of £540,000, but the
previous one only £463,000. Share-
holders have never been called on to
contribute funds for expansion since
the initial public issue in 1953.
Dividends have risen from a maiden
8f p.c. to 15 p.c. the year after listing,
then to the current rate in 1958-59.
Takeovers have been negligible and the
asset backing for each 10s. share has
risen in the present decade from 15s. 2d.
to 225. Bd.
Bigger and Brighter
TJright as the figures were in the recent
interim report from merchant Per-
mewan Wright, the results for the full
year to March 31 will be even brighter
with the inclusion of Sydney-based
Petries in the consolidated accounts.
Although the shares issued to finance
the takeover rank from April 1 last year
and although a full year’s trading by
Petries will be included in the final re-
sults, directors did not choose to com-
pound the figures of their latest acqui-
sition into the fully audited accounts as
at September 30. This would give a
more accurate overall picture, but a
spokesman for the company told The
Bulletin that the move had been de-
ferred until the compulsory acquisition
of a few remaining shares had been
completed.
Petries aside, the half-yearly accounts
showed that the group is set for another
record year. Profit was £204,000 com-
pared with £359,000 after tax adjust-
ments in the full 1963-64 year. Ex-
pressed on an annual basis, earning rate
came out at 24.4 p.c., against 21.6 p.c.
previously. The final consolidation
should show an earning rate over the
full year much closer to 30 p.c.
Needless to say, shareholders will be
seeing another 121 p.c. dividend for
the current year and 1965-66 too, when
a one-for-five premium issue to be made
next month will become dividend rank-
ing.

Falling coal is sharp and abrasive.
That's why tough metals are needed
to carry it. Coal is also corrosive.
That's why a metal like Australuco
aluminium is needed.
These coal chutes at Queensland's
Bulimba ‘B’ Power Station are prime
examples of aluminium’s versatility.
They have to be tough, and they
have to last with a minimum of
maintenance and upkeep.
Aluminium, of course, will last. It
won't rot or rust, and it needs no
painting for protection. It is ex-
tremely resilient, and stands up to
the toughest treatment. And, being
light, it is easier to install than
heavier metals.
These are all good reasons why the
Southern Electric Authority specified
aluminium from Australuco, whose
technical design work assisted in the
development of the boiler chutes.
They're reasons, too, why a long
service life is confidently predicted.
Australuco's engineers and tech-
nicians, backed by the world-wide
experience and knowledge of the
parent company, Alcan, are able to
supply the latest information about
the many applications of aluminium
in all phases of Australian industry.
Perhaps Australuco can help you?

LEGACY
SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Enter Long-term Prospects
Is short-term growing difficult?
{Occasionally readers do my ego the
world of good by expressing dis-
belief at the ability of this diary to make
quite a useful little bit of money out of
the share market. Last week one cor-
respondent was even kind enough to
say something about my “perspicacity”.
Come now, we don’t even know the
meaning of such big words on this
page!
Anyway, no matter how lucky I
might have been in the past there is no
doubt that 1965 looks like being a very
difficult year for us speculators. Have
you noticed how brokers are beginning
to say how good the “long - term”
prospects are? Always a dangerous
sign. It generally means they don’t like
the look of the short-term.
So perhaps I’ll do better out of put
options and selling short this year than
buying. My put option on United Tele-
casters is beginning to move along quite
nicely, but CSR is holding grimly on to
its 695. to 70s. level. Of course, I
hardly dare mention the name of CSR.
They got rather upset about my revela-
tion that some Ready Mixed Concrete
shareholders are in the happy position
of being paid twice, once in cash and
once in shares. Now the same thing
has happened to another speculator-
friend!
Meanwhile other small shareholders
in Ready Mixed are still protesting
bitterly that they have been issued with
tiny parcels of CSR and Blue Metal
shares instead of cash, because they
neglected to fill the forms in correctly.
Perhaps if CSR and BMI had treated
these shareholders more leniently, those
who have been paid twice might be
more inclined to reveal their identities.
For my own part I’ve indulged in
a little more shorting. This time it was
Captain Products, the importers of
canned fish. Its shares have always
been one of the more spectacular
market performers, with wild dashes
up and equally sudden drops down. For
example, it is only a month or two ago
that the shares slipped inexplicably from
755. to 665. In the past few days they
have shot up to 84s. —as a result,
apparently, of one of those mysterious
recommendations from an investment
service. So I took the opportunity to
short 200. Not that I have anything
against Captain Products. On the con-
trary, they look to be an excellent share.
But on past performance they are likely
to fall before they rise again.
I haven’t been all pessimist and spoil-
sport this week, however. I did buy
some Australian Chemical. This was
after Hercules Powder announced that
it would go ahead with its partial take-
over, even though it hadn’t got as many
shares as it would like. Initially it said
it had received a 36 p.c. acceptance and
then next day rather curiously upped
this figure to 45 p.c.
Be that as it may, Australian Chemi-
cal could be a good investment now
that it is coming firmly under the wing
of Hercules Powder. Rather a good
name for a company, isn’t it? Makes
me think of gun powder. In fact that’s
probably how it got its name, as I see
that it lists explosives among its pro-
ducts. Hercules, though, is apparently
rather more modern than gunpowder:
nowadays it also makes missile pro-
pellants. And a lot of other things, too
resins, rosins and all sorts of things.
This is what Australian Chemical has
also been making but, of course, on a
more modest scale. Nevertheless Aus-
tralian Chemical was able to report a
rather surprising 50 p.c. profit increase
for the first quarter of the current year.
That, together with the longer-term (sic)
benefits from the Hercules Powder take-
over, made me think the IQs. shares
looked well worthwhile at 265. 6d. So
I bought 200.
That meant my transactions for the
week were:
BOUGHT
200 Australian Chemical, 26/6 .. £270
SOLD SHORT
200 Captain Products, 84/- £B5O
The purchase of the Australian
Chemical still left me with cash in
hand. From this you can see that I am
treading cautiously.

Low Earnings Yield Unjustified?
Rocla Industries faces testing period
T>ocla Industries Limited must be
* one of the few Australian companies
which has been an exporter of technical
“know how” rather than an importer.
About two years ago it was stated that
this “know how” had been provided to
fifteen overseas countries, including the
USA. It may well be that this factor has
had an important bearing on the price of
the shares, for, over the last five years,
they have not sold below 17s. and at that
price the dividend yield would have been
3.7 p.c. The increases in the dividend rate
that have taken place certainly mean that
the current return on the investment
made at 17s. is now 4 p.c. Even this is
not a very high return. The main advan-
tage is undoubtedly the 62 p.c. capital
appreciation that took place in about
eighteen months by the price rising to
275. 6d.
Today it must be wondered whether
an V further appreciation can take place
in the short term, since at the last sale
. ’ . .
price of 265. 9d. the dividend yield is
, 0 .
only 2.6 p.c. and the earnings yield is
only 4.0 p.c. Only brewery and news-
paper shares sell at prices to show lower
dividend and earnings yields. Rocla’s
competitors are certainly not so well
thought of by investors, since their shares
sell at prices which give dividend yields
at least 45 p.c. greater and earnings
yields at least 65 p.c. greater,
In general terms, Rocla’s record has
been superior but it has not been as
dramatic as the breweries and news-
papers. The earnings and dividend per
share indices (adjusted for bonus and
cash issues), taking the 1957-8 year as a
base of 100, are as follows:
Year 1958/9 '59/60 '6O/1 '6l/2 '62/3 '63/4
Earnings 120 109 111 124 147 145
Dividends 104 104 107 110 121 123
These figures suggest that earnings per
share have been increasing over this
period at an average compound rate of
about 6 p.c. per annum, while dividends
per share have been increasing at the
average compound rate of only 3} p.c.
per annum. If we assume that there is
little prospect that the shares will sell at
an earnings yield of less than 4 p.c.
(price/earnings ratio equivalent is 25),
then future price increases will only re-
sult from earnings per share increases.
Clearly the future will need to produce
greater increases than the past or the
shares will hover around their present
price for some time to come. However,
we all know that this is a purely theoreti-
cal argument because, with very little
change in earnings per share, prices over
the last two years have ranged from 17s.
to 275. 6d. This means that the earnings
yield has ranged from 6.4 p.c. down to
3.9 p.c.
Looking into the future is always
hazardous, though every purchaser of a
share must do this, if only subcon-
sciously. Only “guesstimates” are ever
possible, yet at least they should give an
idea of the chances that are being taken.
So far as concrete pipes are concerned,
it seems probable that the Australian
demand will increase in the future at a
rate of between 4 p.c. and 5 p.c. per
annum compound. As Rocla is estab-
lished in all States with the exception of
Western Australia and Tasmania, there
is little prospect of its volume in this
product increasing at a much greater rate
than the overall market.
It is in the field of earthenware pro-
ducts that the greatest possibility of an in-
crease exists, because no attempt has
been made as yet to enter the New South
Wales and Queensland markets. This
should not be over-difficult because the
name of Rocla is already well known in
those States. Strong competition will be
met from PGH Industries, which is well
established in this field.
Rocla’s figures for the volume of out-
put in units is available with exception
of the years 1959-60, 1960-1 and 1961-2.
Although the comparison may be in-
valid, the indices of this figure and that
of net profit are as follows: —

fits have been increasing at a rate about
2 p.c. per annum greater than the rate
of increase in sales volume. Over this
period that is a very good record.
The actual rates of growth are almost
certainly not comparable, as four com-
panies were acquired during the period.
One of these was subsequently re-sold,
while another (Tesselated Tile Holdings)
has withdrawn from tile production. This
appears to be the period when the com-
pany was entering the earthenware pro-
ducts field. From the statement made
regarding the profits (or lack of profits)
during the first half of 1963-4 so far as
Mellody’s was concerned, it may be rea-
sonable to assume that there have been
problems which could have inhibited the
growth rate of “net profit”.
So far as the future is concerned, it
would seem that there will be no shortage
of cement for some time to come. In
fact, there is a strong possibility that
there will be over-capacity for two or
three years. The prospects of any major
cost increase here is therefore unlikely.
Mellody’s Holdings and Earthenware
Industries would have held sufficient clay
reserves for some years, but difficulty
could be experienced in obtaining ade-
quate supplies in other States should the
company decide to compete there. It is
believed that the company enjoys excel-
lent labor relations, so there is no reason
to believe that any cost problems could
arise that would not be common to the
rest of the community.
Generally, one gets the impression that
growth in per share earnings may not be
quite as rapid as it has been in the past.
It would be helpful to know the split-up
of assets, sales and profits between the
concrete and earthenware divisions. This
does not seem to be available. At a guess,
it could be concluded that, up to the
present, earthenware has not been con-
tributing its share of the profits in relation
to the capital invested. As it also seems
that the position will be rectified this

In summary, Rocla Industries is a
company with good management and
good customers. It is engaged in indus-
tries that seem to have a reasonable
potential and which are not subject to
import competition. While the company
is fortunate in that its products are in
great demand for Government works, the
competition for these contracts must be
intense during recession periods.
It is very difficult to see sufficient
growth in the future to justify the present
low earnings yield. Although there have
been two bonus issues and a reconstruc-
tion in the last seven years, they did not
add very much to the dividend payout.
The major increase has come in the last
two years with lifts in the actual divi-
dend rate. The increase has been less than
id. per share per annum, so it can
hardly be this factor which has contri-
buted to the high price.
It will be very interesting to see what
the future brings. Rocla’s expert manage-
ment will certainly produce the best pos-
sible results.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
What’s Wrong with Wool Prices
An industry in a troubled state
wool marketing was not an issue,
particularly in rural electorates,
during the recent Senate campaign is
one of the mysteries of the year. It can
only be assumed that there was an
agreement between the political parties
to lay off the subject. Naturally this
would not have been motivated by
gentlemanly ideals. It would have been
agreed upon because the whole market-
ing question is so complex, and so criss-
crossed with relevant and semi-relevant
issues, that no one political party could
have gained anything.
Yet now the figures for the first half
of the wool selling season are out. They
make it imperative, for the good of the
country as well as the woolgrower, that
the wool issues be cleared up.
There are three main reasons given
by woolbrokers for the fall:
• Delays in consignments due to
shearing difficulties.
• Refusal of an increasing number
of growers to accept ruling prices.
• Less activity on the part of both
Japanese and British buyers who, last
season, took 44 p.c. of the wool.
To these reasons may be added a
fourth, one for which no exact figures
are yet available. This is the acreage
taken out of sheep production and
given over to wheat. The wheat boom,
thanks to Red China, is such that land
never before under crops has been put
under wheat in many districts. Wheat
is even being grown on the fringes of
Essendon Aerodrome, less than 10
miles from the centre of Melbourne.
Unfortunately woolgrowers seem no
closer to settling the issues of market-
ing and promotion which are be-
setting their industry. A kind of wash-
ing of the hands, an inertia if you like,
seems to have taken hold. Nearly every-
thing that is being said has been said
before.
Wool Board chief Sir William Gunn
has been hard at it, of course. He has
waged a campaign per medium of
50 country radio stations to convince
growers that all will be solved by im-
plementation of the reserve price plan.
He has not said anything remarkably
new and his opponents are not in fact
attacking him because of anything that
he said in his broadcasts. Rather they
are letting him have it on the score
that he should not be using Wool Board
funds to promote a cause about which
growers, who supply the Wool Board
with funds, are divided.
Meanwhile, prices continue to slide.
Two things seem urgently required
of the Commonwealth Government.
One is that the way must be cleared
as quickly as possible for the Logan
Downs challenge to the validity of the
Wool Tax Act in the High Court. The
other is that the referendum on market-
ing should be held as quickly as
possible. Reserve price advocates will
blanch, but if the referendum is not to
be held at all then that should be
decided quickly also.
The High Court challenge is, accord-
ing to those supporting it, no good
reason for a delay in holding a referen-
dum on reserve price marketing. But
they assume that everyone is as close
to the matter as they are. Most people,
however, including politicians and in-
cluding plenty of woolgrowers, are not
close to the finer implications of this
Court challenge at all.
It might be said that the Court
challenge will clear up the promotion
question once and for all. Will it? A
good deal of the matter which the
supporters of the action hope to bring
to light in the Court may very well be
ruled inadmissible. Court actions, par-
ticularly ones involving a fine principle,
have a habit of dragging on and on.
The law cannot be hurried.
Far too much of the argument for
and against reserve-price selling now is
hypothetical. Reserve price men say
that if the reserve had been operating
this season then the slump in prices
would have been avoided. Anti-
reservists say that if the reserve price
system had been operating then the
slump would have wiped out the fund
backing, or seriously depleted it.
Such arguments, no matter how well
intentioned or documented, can mean
little, really. They are rather like play-
ing the stock market, on paper, and

discovering that it is easy to become
a millionaire. The fact is that prices
are down 20 p.c.
Is there anything on the credit side
which might be of interest to wool-
growers and those non-woolgrowers
who play the wool futures market? A
couple of things.
The figures to hand concern wool
which has passed through auction. Part
of the difference between these first-
half figures and last season’s may
possibly be attributable to a greater
amount of wool this season being sold
by private treaty. There is no evidence
of a big buying operation by either the
United States or Red China, but it could
still happen.
The most valuable piece of work done
by the International Wool Secretariat
in a long time took place a couple of
weeks ago. Certainly it is a change (for
the good) to be able to record some-
thing other than the hiring of Miss
World and the Woolmark campaign as
evidence of IWS activity.
Sir William Gunn, Mr W. J. Vines
(IWS director), Mr Jack Acland (New
Zealand Wool Board chief) and Mr
Van der Wath (South Africa) attended
a meeting of Woollens and Worsteds of
America Inc. and discussed ways and
means of increasing American con-
sumption of home-manufactured wool-
len textiles. Sir William was elected
vice-president of WAWA, adding to his
considerable portfolio of appointments.
Despite the inroads of synthetics, the
US, because of its sheer size, is still the
third largest wool consumer in the
world. It’s reasonably certain that the
American members of WAWA are not
concerned overmuch if they increase
their share of the US market at the
expense of British, Italian and Japanese
imported textiles—all made from Aus-
tralian wool. Nevertheless, the prospect
of increased sales of Australian wool to
the US should be something of en-
couragement to the Australian wool-
grower.
Another encouraging item is that
wool quality, according to the Aus-

techniques are improving also.
Before anyone starts predicting that
the bottom has fallen out of wool, the
exact amount being consigned to private
buyers, for sale direct to overseas manu-
facturers, should be ascertained. It may
be that the current slip is more at the
expense of the auction system than at
the expense of wool generally.

creased growing of wheat, that sheep
numbers are themselves drastically
down. It is more likely that a certain
percentage has been transferred to

they have. The conclusion must be that
the troubled state of the industry is as

a clamp-down on public discussion. The
executive of the Wool Industry Con-
ference has asked the Wool Board to
refrain from making public statements
about its marketing proposals.
