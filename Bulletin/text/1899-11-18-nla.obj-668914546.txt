A Tea Party.
Mks. Gordon had asked a few of them home with
her from the Club to take tea. The women had
gone upstairs to tidy themselves a bit, while the
men waited in the drawing-room. Presently Mrs.
Gordon pushed aside the portiere, and with mock
ceremony and circumstance ushered her friends
into a chamber of dainty appointments,, softly lit.
She saw among the men one who had not been of
the party on the links, but he motioned her to
withhold her greeting, and she assumed that he
had already passed a word with the others —since
none particularly recognised his presence—and
merely nodded her salute.
“I’m so cold, Madge ! Do hurry, dear,” cned
one of the women.
“ From cold and thirst deliver us, good Mrs.
Gordon,” supplemented a man, glancing at the
tea-table service.
. . . “ Pretend not to bother me, dearest. But
listen the new-comer whispered, standing
beside her. As she moved to the table he fol-
lowed, and she pulled'a chair for him close to her
elbow after seating herself.
“All ye that are chilled,” gayly began Mrs.
Gordon;' “but that’s irreverent. You lead me
into bad habits, Mr. Wilson. Will you take any
tea in yours ? ” and she poised a little decanter
above his cup.
. . . “ Don't let them notice. You must be very
brave, dear," admonished the whisper from behind
her shoulder.
“Any tea? Indeed, I will. Most excellent
flavor for rum I find it.”
“If you answer his prayer to deliver him from
thirst you will have an enemy for life, Mrs.
Gordon.”
“That would be the least of my petitions that
Mrs. Gordon has refused ”
. . . ‘‘ Fire seen Jack, dearest ,” continued
he at her elbow.
“ Where’s your husband, Madge. You said he
would be here for tea. That’s why I came.”
“Missed his train. I suppose,’’-she carelessly re-
plied. “He would be here before now from the
4.10. Jack’s a spendthrift with engagements.
Can’t keep any.”
. . . “ We met at the station ” —■
“ It’s turning into a beastly night,” said one of
the men, who walked to a window ; then turned
from that outlook on bitter darkness to regard
complacently the soft lamp-light and warmth of
his more immediate surroundings.
“You have the cosiest house, Madge,” and a
plump little lady settled more comfortably into a
chair.
.. . We met at the station, ” repeated the
whisper, “ and he insisted on my walking up with
him."
“Say, Mrs. Gordon, did you see me drive from
the first tee on that final round ? ”
“Indeed, I did!” enthusiastically returned
Mrs. Gordon. “ Did you reach the green ? ”
. . . “He has been suspecting us, dear, for
weeks ” .
The antagonist of the man who made the drive
spoke up joyously : “He did not. Fell just short;
foozled like a duffer, and the hole cost him four.”
“ But you took five.”
“ No, sir ; I won out on that hole.”
Mrs. Gordon had forgotten them, as she list-
ened intently. . . . “ And now he knows.”
“ What! ” she cried, tensely.
“ Beg your pardon, Mrs. Gordon ? ”
“Oh —er—did you really let Mr. Wilson beat
you, Harry ? I’m ashamed ”
“My dear lady, of course I did not.”
“ Of course, he did not,” rejoined Mr. Wilson,
with sarcastic inflection ; “ even up at the eighth,
and had just one stroke to the good at the finish.”
. . . “ He accused me coming through the woods.
He knew. I lied, sweetheart ; fervently at first, and
then badly ”
Mrs. Gordon was leaning slightly toward the
chair at her side, but she caught the curious
glance of the woman nearest her, and straightened
sharply. A reckless light flashed into her eyes.
“ Golf ! ” she exclaimed, contemptuously ; “it
will be croquet next. Why don’t you hunt, or
play polo, or ”
14 Flirt, ” suggested her chum.
“But that requires an excellent reputation,
dear,” oautioned Mrs. Gordon, sweetly.
. . . “He told me his proofs. He knows. I told
him it was my fault, all mine—as it was, dear
heart.”
“Then you ride, Mrs. Gordon?” questioned
Wilson.
“Oh —yes,” she replied, absently. She did not
observe that her chum was making a signal to the
other woman.
“Then let me lend you my pony for a few
days.”
“Thank you. I’m sure you ’re very good.”
. . . .“ I begged him, to let you off. To take it
out on me then and there, —”
“And we will go out to-morrow afternoon
then ? ”
“ Better be careful, old man. Jack’s dread-
fully jealous, is n’t he, Mrs. Gordon ? ’’
Her chum added : “To say nothing of ”
. . . . “ But he said we must both pay ’’^-faintly—
“ with our lives.”
Mrs. Gordon’s teacup clattered against the
saucer as she replaced it after a tremendous
sipping.
“That’s right, Wilson. He half killed a
strange chap for addressing her, although the
poor beggar spoke quite by mistake.”
Mrs. Gordon laughed cheerlessly: “Oh, but
that occurred years ago. ”
“ On your honeymoon, was n’t it ? ” inquired her
closest friend. Mrs. Gordon blushed, dully.
. . . 1 ‘ I saw he, meant it. I sprang at him—”
“Well, now, by gad, I’ll chance it if you will,
Mrs. Gordon.”
.. . “ But I slipped and missed him. He drove
a blow right into my face that bowled me over ; ”
“Then it’s a date, Mrs. Gordon?” persisted
Wilson.
But she did not answer. Her head was turned,
and she stared wide-eyed over her shoulder.
. . . “He was on me before I could stir. He
pressed his revolver against my forehead ”
“Madge, Madge, what is it?” and her friend
with sincere concern hastily rose.
.... “ And he fired.”
The handle of Mrs. Gordon’s teacup cracked
between her fingers, as she uttered a harsh cry.
A maid had startled her by approaching unseen
and touching her shoulder. The maid leaned to
whisper to her. The men had risen and stood
uneasily beside their chairs. Mrs. Gordon’s friend
spoke again. “Madge, dear” ——
Mrs. Gordon rose slowly, trembling. “Please,”
she said, with a pathetic effort to smile, “ you
must excuse me a minute. Jack has come. He
wants to see me.” Then she turned to look
lovingly upon the empty chair that had stood at
her elbow. The heavy portiere swayed into place
after her passage beneath it. It hung in sullen
folds in the terrible silence.
LAYTON BREWER, in The Criterion.
Stray Notes.
There has been the usual delay in the final
touches of “ Steele Rudd’s ” book (why won’t
books go like oysters, by clockwork, instead of
like women, by strings you pull ?), but the books
are now on sale, and selling faster chan the
binder can deliver them. So much for ex-
pectant buyers, licking eager lips. . . Tor . the
perforce-stoical, lacking six bob, it might be
urged that delay was immaterial, were not “On
Our Selection ’ ’ a book that everybody must
borrow who cannot buy. For really, there does .
not appear to have been anything better suited to
the Australian country audience since this is
the place where one searches for an exemplar and
finds only the next paragraph.

The modernising of Lond. Punch is expected
with curiosity. Even Conservative England has
kicked against the pricks of mid-century humour
at last, and expostulates with dreary Burnand.
The introduction of Phil. May and others has
been so much appreciated that Punch leaps boldly
into next year with an enlargement, and a re-
vision of methods, and a change ot themes and
style. Then there will indeed be ground for the
fogey’s complaint: “ Punch isn’t what it used
to be. ” And all the congregation will say thank
goodness.

Always we return to our first loves. E. J.
Brady, who is trekking west and north for health
and “copy”—with a van, and k cook, and a dog
■ —reached his birthplace at Carcoar, X.8.W., the
other day; and the birthplace was glad to see
him in a column-and-a-half of the local paper’s
print. Carcoar wants to be the Federal capital,
and its ownership of a local poet is emphasised as
another point in the argument—though on which
side the argument is n’t quite clear.

‘ ‘ The Last Hours of a Lion Heart, a Threnody, ”
by H. C. J. Lingham (Melville, Mullen, and
Slade), is a belated address to the English fanatic
Gordon, in doggerel verse like this —
Within the palace walls Vv- pensive sat,
Uppn his head a Turkish pasha’s cap ;
Before hilri was a table, and on that
Three hooks, some papers, and an outstretch’d map.
Anon he wrote, and ever as he turned
His fine blue eyes a moment on the map,
Hope in their depths, intensely burn’d,
And some great thought seem’d all his soul to rap.
This is published in Melbourne under vice-regal
patronage—and deserves it.
“ The Over-Seas Library ” of Fisher Unwin
opened well enough with Cunningham Graham’s
“ The Ipane ” —since Graham is a man with brains
and a, style and the hunter-rover instinct which
thrills hereditary tendrils always ; and continued
well enough with A. Werner’s “The Captain of
the Locusts ” —one supposes A. Werner to be
that mettled Alice who wrote “ Bannerman of
the Dandenong ” for The Bulletin, and pub-
lished even better verses in “A Time and Times.”
“In Guiana Wilds,” the next of the series,
was just passable. Now we have “The
Wei 1-Sinkers, ” by somebody who. is Ethel
Quinn ” on the cover and “Teth Quinn” on the
title-page-’-—-and wish Australia had been left out
of the galley. As “an Australian pastoral ” there
was no reason why “The Well-Sinkers ” should
have been written, or published. The local colour
amounts to a row of pins; but the book is so
nerveless and forceless thai it tells nothing,
nothing, deserves nothing. “ Close,” says Teth-
Ethel as a climax, “close the pages of a disap-
pointing story of a disappointing land.” The land
may defend itself ; but the story never excites hope
or interest enough to be disappointing. It merely
fails, being too flat to fall.

“ The Pelican ” writes —
As to E. Wilson Dobbs’ quotation of “ Even Solomon in
all his glory was not li.A’d like one of these.” I have
always understood that this originated at a picture
“ view ”in London. Solomon J. Solomon —best, known
to Australians by his “ Hercules ” picture in the Ballarat
gallery—was not popular with the small earthenware gods
who pull.the R. A. wires in Britain ; so, despite first-flight
work, was passed over year by year whilst bis inferiors
were elected to the Academy. At the aforesaid view a
picture of Solomon’s created more than usual interest.
“Oh,” sneered a mediocre brother to a bevy of his kin,
“here" we have Solomon in all his glory.” “ But not
R.A’d like one of these,” commented a quick-witted
listener.

Arthur Adams’s book of verses bas received un-
commonly flattering reviews (perhaps we are too
good to our bards ;*but better good than Kendall-
wise neglectful) ; and his native Maoriland is
selling its mere and pawning its taupo to purchase.
The Christchurch Press rises to the occasion in a
leading article which holds that, “there is no
manner of doubt that Mr. Adams is a true poet ”;
but regrets the absence of Jingo sentiment.
It is not enough for a Maorilander to love Maori-
land ;he must love Britain too. Children, honour
your father and your mother, and remember your
great-grandmother in the days of your poetical
youth, that your bays may be strong in the Maori-
land which buyeth you.

The New Zealand Magazine arrives, and is un-
commonly well satisfied with itself. The accom-
panying circular thinks “ you will agree with us
that no Colonial Magazine hitherto published lias
possessed equal claims to the support of the read-
ing public.” After this, The Bookfellow’s solemn
assurance that there is not one distinguished piece
of verse or prose in' eighty-two pages is precisely
what might have been expected.

“Is The Australian Magazine dead?’’asks a
correspondent. Well, The Australian Magazine
isn’t quite sure. It" dissembled last month ; but
if certain negotiations are successful we’ll have
another number or two. Disaster, on the old
lines, was certain.

Arthur Bayldon complains that the writer of an
article on. local poets in last Review of Reviews
dubbed him author, swimmer, lecturer, and for-
tune-teller . Bayldon says he is interested in
palmistry, and reads your fortune in your hand,
but he would scorn to tell it for money. “ I have
never engaged in any calling that is not legitimate
and moral, ” he writes indignantly.
jX J*
Here, by the way, are some of Bayldon’s verses,
new and neatly-touched—
One can say of Kipling's Transvaal war-verses,
printed in Lond. Times of Sept, 20, that they are
every whit as bad as the cause they flatter—and
one cannot say more.

Sydney Telegraph the other day announced the
death of Grant Allen, “the famous novelist.”
“ Infamous novelist ” would have been as far from
the truth, yet might have left a juster impression.
A little temporary notoriety was novelist Grant
Allen’s portion: but fame ! My Grief ! His
were decent, workmanlike novels, written
by a man who had no vocation to the busi-
ness, and wrote fiction for a living because the
gross public would notbuyhisscienee. Grant Allen
was happy when expounding Spencer and Darwin,
developing their theories and diverging on timid
little side-tracks of his own. He clung to the
skirts of the apostles of Evolution, and did a won-
derful amount of disciple-work in newspapers and
magazines during the last twenty years. A Cana-
dian by birth, an Englishman by res ’
laboured continually, and burnt out a
great or “ famous, ” but a useful writer, an p g
and estimable man.
THE BOOKFELLOW.
THE MUSE: TO A POET.
She sits alone with her beautiful face
Just seen through her hair down streaming,
Where the perfect pilgrims rest a space
And the tethered souls lie dreaming.
Her raiment woven of starry mist
In lappets and folds falls lightly ;
And a steady star like an amethyst
On her calm clear brow burns brightly.
She never moves but her wonderful songs
Fill the listening souls with euiotiofi :
’Mid thunder and flame she blazons our wrongs ;
’Mid music and light our devotion.
A. D. Bayldon.
Verses by Grant Allen
(FROM "THE LOWER SLOPES”).
A BALLADE OF EVOLUTION.
In the mud of the Cambrian main
Did our earliest ancestor dive
From a shapeless albuminous grain
We mortals our being derive.
He could split himself up into five.
Or roll himself round like a ball;
For the fittest will always survive,
While the weakliest go to the wall.
As an active aseidian again
Fresh forms he began to contrive,
Till he grew to a fish with a brain,
And brought forth a mammal alive.
With his rivals he next had to strive
To woo him a mate and a thrall :
So the handsomest managed to wivef
While the ugliest went to the wall.
At length as an ape he was fain
The nuts of the forest to rive,
Till.he took to the low-lying plain.
And proceeded his fellows to knive.
Thus did cannibal men first arrive
One another to swallow and maul :
And the strongest continued to thrive,
While the weakliest went to the walk
ENVOY.
Prince, in our civilised hive,
Now money’s the measure of all;
And the wealthy in coaches can drive,
While the needier go to the wall.
THE FIRST IDEALIST.
A jelly-fish swam in a tropical sea.,
And he said, “ This world it consists of Me :
There’s nothing above and nothing below
That a jelly-fish ever can possibly know
(Since we’ve got no sight, or hearing, or smell),
Beyond what ovrr single sense can tell.
Now, all that I learn from the sense of touch
Is the fact of my feelings, viewed as such.
But to think they have any external cause
Is an inference clean against logical laws,
Again, to suppose, as I’ve hitherto done,
There are other jelly-fish under the sun,
Is a pure assumption that can’t be backed
By a jot of proof or a single fact.
In short, like Hume, I very much doubt
If there’s anything else at all without.
So I come at last to the plain conclusion,
When the subject is fairly set free from confusion,
That the universe simply centres in Me,
And if I were not, then nothing would be.”
That minute, a shark, who was strolling by,
Just gulped him down, in the twink of an eye ;
And he died, with a few convulsive twists.
if .* , .■ /’
But, somehow, the universe still exists.
A VINDICATION.
Let him, the wiser man who springs
Hereafter, up from childhood shape
His action like the greater ape,
But I was born to other things.
In M moriam, cxx.
Ah, happy you who know your birth
Has loftier origin than earth :
I would not quench that generous fire,
But rather silently admire :
Yet if another, less in luck,
Amid his random thoughts has struck
Some clue which leads him on to think
Mankind is but the latest link
In being’s endless, widening chain
Through higher types and higher again :
If, after months of patient thought,
His wavering mind is slowly brought
To grasp a simpler, humbler creed,
And deem himself an ape indeed ;
Then, having judged the notion true,
What should an ape of spirit do
But.manfully resign his dream.
And take his rank in nature’s scheme ?
Nor need he, yet, behind him cast
The gathered greatness of the past.
He well may nurse each nobler thrill,
Each holier deed, each purer will.
Since earlier apes have raised their race
So high above its former place,
Why may not he as well aspire
To raise his race some places higher ?
To add an atom to the store
Of wisdom heaped by apes before ;
To feel within his hungry breast
Some goading spur of grand unrest,
Some glorious aim, in impulse rife,
That urges onto fuller life,
Nor leaves to rust in dull content
The powers a million ages lent.
And surely such an ape as this
May live a life not much amiss !
May love the right, eschew the wrong ;
Defend the weaker from the st rong;
Teach other after apes to be
Nobler and better far than he ;
In spite of calumny and scorn,
Mould younger ages yet unborn
To loftier thoughts and loftier still,
Beyond all human h ope or will;
Yet act, himself, his little part
On Nature’s stage, with all his heart,
And show that even an ape may be
A credit to his ancestry.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Maoriland in a general way went off what
little head it had over its Transvaal contingent,
and the fountains of the great deep were broken
up, and it rained bosh in torrents, and every
hollow place in the two islands was filled with
bathos and interjections. But when its contin-
gent actually embarked on 21st October the New
Zealand Mail, in the first of its 12 columns of
thin wash, struck the top note. This is the note :
October 21st is a fateful day in history, a day memor-
able to every Briton not only on account of the glorious
victory won on that day in Trafalgar’s Bay nearly a
century ago, but as the day on which the man who above
all others helped to make England Mistress of the Seas
lost his life—Vicount Horatio Nelson. Nothing happier
or more appropriate was said in the many patriotic
speeches delivered than his Excellency’s reference to Nel-
son’s great signal. October 21st, 1899, is a day of which
New Zealanders may feel proud to the end of time—it
will be to them what St. Crispin’s Day was to Henry the
Fifth and his army before Agincourt.
A pitiable sign of national decadence is the ten-
dency to get drunk with the glory of small things.
And the community which classifies the despatch
of 200 ill-disciplined volunteers to do a little shoot-
ing in a little war along with Trafalgar and Agin-
court is drunk with the smallest of small things
it has swallowed a speck and got delirium-tremeus.
Love’s Legacy.
The light upon her cheek
Is nearing its eclipse,
The lips whereof you speak
Are not for lovers’ lips.
The wherefore and the why
Make men and maidens weep;
Gold lights of hair and eye
Grey grow in endless sleep.
A flower is she indeed,
A lily-ohalice pale,
But evil was the seed
Whence sprung a growth so frail.
The debts we pile to-day
They pay in ceaseless tears—
With streaming eyes they pay
The score in after-years.
Who should not meet have met.
They sin—the world rolls on 1
Dust all except the debt:
Who pays ? She dies anon.
RODERIO QUINN.
Wild Oats.
Fling them broadcast! do not spare the measure t
Not an idle dalliance shall we miss j
Not a tremor, not a flimsy treasure,
Not a whisper, not a furtive kiss 1
Faithfully the heart, when life is slowing,
Will account for all we lavished thus.
Hundredfold the seed we have been sowing
Will return its harvest unto us.
When below dead leaves the Spring lies sleeping,
We, my love, shall sit alone and be
Reaping, reaping
Golden sheaves of precious memory.
Prodigal and careless, youth spells laughter,
Softly uttered words, a jest, a sigh,
Vows and tears and quarrels, and thereafter
Smiles and fondlings—and a light good-bye!
But it passed, the folly that was soaring
Recklessly and scattering the grains ;
Winter is upon me now and pouring
Icy water into trembling veins.
Deep his bloodless hand my face is seaming;
But I turn toward the sunset glow.
Dreaming, dreaming
Of the summer days of long ago.
How they cling, the hours that once were fleetest 1
Do you still remember : far above
Noise and city gritne I met you, sweetest,
And you sang to ine a song of love.
But I went my way, and, soon besotted,
Lost myself in fancies grave and gay ;
And the little melody was blotted
From the consciousness of yesterday.
Now, I know not whence, the winds are bringing
Note for note the music back again,
Singing, singing
Tenderly that lingering refrain.
Once, at dusk, when paradise is nearest:
Through the branches fell the softened gleams
Of the dying eve upon you, dearest,
And your eyes were full of wondrous dreams.
And I watched you, questioning, surmising,
Till a silver flood aroused us two.
In the awe-hushed east the moon was rising,
And our glances met; and then I knew !
’Twas the essence of a lifetime’s yearning,
Just a flash —but ah, I feel it yet
Burning, burning
With a message I shall ne’er forget.
How the thoughtless Maydays we have wasted
Rally back forsaken age to bless !
Not a draught of joy that we have tasted,
Not a wassail, not a shy caress,
But returns when we are old and lonely,
Yielding up the sweets we left behind ;
Making life, that seemed a wanton only,
Rich and purposeful and well-designed.
Love, I see you now 1 Your head is leaning
On my breast, and —ah, the heart goes free,
Gleaning, gleaning
O’er the harvest-field of memory.

To the Departing Contingents.
Belated.
IS the valedictory
address which ought
to have been de-
livered by the Pre-
miers to the depart-
ing contingents,
only the wet weather
and other circum-
stances got in the
way. It is there-
fore delivered per
medium of The
Bulletin, and sent
after them by post:
We, Richard John Sed-
don, James Dickson, Wil-
liam John Lyne, George
Turner, Charles Came-
ron Kingston, and John
Forrest, also a composite Premier from Tasmania,
who is partly Edward Braddon and partly his suc-
cessor, Neil Lewis, do hereby lake oath to the following
effect; and we, Edmund Barton, George Reid, Duncan
Gillies, Vauien Solomon, William Russell Russell, and
other leading politicians out of office, do likewise, as
follows: —
(1) You are now going forth with our best blessing to
shoot at a number of complete strangers, to needlessly
make their wives widows and their children orphans, to
be cheap hired homicides at less than the wages of a
piok-and-shovel-man, to burst-up one of the command-
ments, in a quarrel of which you know practically
nothing. May your path be decorated with the blood
and brains of many house fathers, and may .vou earn the
curses of innumerable widows and orphans. You can’t
be eminently successful without earning the curses of
many widows and orphans.
(2) You are not fighting in defence of your country, so
you lack the only thing which makes war respectable and
even glorious.
(3) Not one in a hundred of you has studied South
African history sufficiently to be able to tell whether
there is any semblance of justice in Britain’s
cause. All you know of the matter is gathered
from the shrieks of 240 Imperialist papers, no
two of which tell the same story. We are in the
same situation. Therefore your only excuse, and
ours, lies in the theory that it is the duty of Australia to
stand by Britain right or wrong. We preaoh that theory
but we don’t act up to it in our calmer moments. When
Britain asked us to give free admission to her produots
we refused. When Bri-
tain said it. was right to
send convicts to Australia
we said, in effect, that she
was a Sappiiira. When
Britain said that the
great New Guinea land
grant was equitable and
advisable, we said that
she was another Sap-
phira. When Britain
declared it was fair that
her “ submerged tenth ’’
should find homes in
these provinces we gave
back talk to our aged and
beloved mother.
(4) We all say that it is
the duty of Australia to
make sacrifices to aid
Britain. And all seven
Premiers practise, or ad-
vocate, Protection, and
urge Australia to damage
Back Talk.
Britain all it can by shutting out her products, and
closing our markets against her, in Australia’s own
separate interests.
* * * *
(5) May you shoot straight, and bring desolation into
many homes, and make many mothers childless in a
quarrel that isn't yours, and return home covered with
medals. Also, may God bless anrl direct you, and may
He guide you towards property that will burn easily.
Shoot promptly, or the other
fellow will.
(8) There is no easier
way of getting up a
sudden yell of popu-
larity than by sending
off a contingent. Any
fool can send a con-
tingent. In fact, any
fool can send a dozen
contingents. It pleases
the contingenteers—
they like the trip, and
the uniform, and the
shivoo when they leave,
and the girls who kiss
them before they go.
It pleases the people
who get. their billets.
The Fat Man likes it,
because in the excite-
ment the fool of a com-
munity stops thinking
about local reforms.
The city people like to
see the show. It pleases
the baby, and the push,
and the sloppy, down-
at-heel woman with a
large family and a larger
hole in her stocking.
Also, it is a good excuse
for some extra drinking.
The community is fur-

ful we will probably get
Titles, which will be a
pleasant thing for 11s.
If you see the head of

uncertain thing. That
agriculturist behind the
rock may be the one
whose death will just
make the difference be-
tween success and fail-
ure. It is the last Boer
that breaks the camel’s
back. In other words,
there is a Boer some-
where whose death will
just turn the scale be-
tween our getting or
not getting our titles.
There is no Boer so
small or so well-con-
cealed that he may nob
possibly be that Boer.
(V) Every Premier must do something remarkable or
unusual if he wants to keep his billet long. It is a wise
Premier who knows how to be as unusual as possible in
the easiest possible way. We might have acquired fame
by providing N.S.W. with a good Local Government
system, by reforming our Upper Houses (they all want it
badly enough), by settling the Kalgoorlie mining diffi-
culty in a way satisfactory to all parties, by abolishing
sweating, by establishing a minimum wage, by putting a
stop to borrowing, by paying off the deficits, by wiping
out the plural voter, or in a dozen other ways. But these
things are dry and tough and brown and laborious, and
utterly unpicturesque, and they all require brains.

ther gratified because it expects to have the excite-
ment of reading about how the other fellow was shot in
the stomach; I here is something pleasing in reading
about the other fellow’s misfortunes. Also, the lives of
most people are so dead and barren that anything new is
a pleasure. Even an unusually long snake is better than
nothing. Besides, war helps on the trade in compressed
produce and tinned meat.
The proper study of a
grown-up Boer.
(9) Therefore, we give
you our blessing, and trust
that you may leave the
Boer baby fatherless. Then
when he grows up he will
study the geography of
this great country to see
where the mercenaries
came from who killed his
breadwinner, and Austra-
lia will be much advertised
thereby.
(10) A few disloyal peo-
ple have objected to this
noble proceeding. They
are cowards, who merely
want an excuse for staying
at home. We are also
staying at home, but that,
is quite different. The
man who stays at home
and objects to the war is a
coward. The man who
stays at home and whoops
to other people to go to
the war is a hero. VVe
are heroes—but for God’s
sake be careful what you’re doing with that rifle while
we’re addressing you.
(11) It is necessary for the Boer to be extirgni-hed.
His bit of territory looks ugly on the map. It prevents
it all being painted red from Cape Town to Cairo. The
Boer has a small selection in the midst of the stupendous
territories of Britain, and the squatter (which is Britain)
has got, tired of seeing that small seleclor over the fence.
He has to be wiped out. Many of vou are selectors’
sons yourselves. You are going to fight for the big and
gloiious squatter. Some day your own adjacent squatter
will find means to fire you out of your selections. Then
you will know bow it
ieels. Abo it will ferve
you darned well right.
(12) Great men live
and make their fame
and earn I heir titles by
the manipulation of
silly, bloodthirsty foo's
just like you. You v ill
receive further informa-
tion on this point when
you come back—if you
do come back.

sence some one else will

with you all your life. You will find your billet filled
on your return. There won’t be any plunder unless you
take it out in cattle, which aren’t portable. The port-
able wealth belongs to the Outlanders already.
(14) It is necessary to extinguish the Boers because
they tax the alien without representation, just as we do.
It is especially necessary to assist Britain in upholding
the glorious doctrine of “ no taxation without represen-
tation.” The British empire taxes a larger number of
people without giving them a shred of Parliamentary
representation than any other State in the world, China
only excepted. Even Russia doesn’t possess so large a
population that is taxed without Parliamentary repre-
sentation. We have knocked so many large pieces off
this glorious principle that we have to take all the more
care of the bits that remain. If we didn’t look mighty
sharp after the glorious principle in other countries
there would be none of it left.
* * * ♦
(15) We don’t grant naturalisation as a right to any-
body—it is only a privilege, which may be granted or not
as we please. The conduct of the Boer in not granting it
as a right is utterly infamous.
(16) Those of you who hail from Maoriland, Queens-
land, and N.S.W. have no votes for your own Upper
House. The rest of you only have votes for the Upper
House if you own property, and if you had sense enough
to acquire property you would also have sense enough
not to go away on any such fool errand as this. When
you come back with a wooden leg your chance of ever
having the requisite property will be so much the less ; a
wooden leg isn’t one of the possessions which gives a roan
a Council vote. Not having votes for your own Upper
Houses, it is all the more advisable that you should go
and fight the Boer for not giving an Upper House vote to
people like you. Otherwise you might slay and fight us
on the same question —which would be beastly.
“ My troubles about the
boot-tax.”
(17) The Boer is an
extortioner who exacts
from his miserable coun-
try a revenue almost as
large in proportion to
population as that of
Maoriland or Queensland,
and almost half as large
as that of Westralia. He
taxes the gold-industry
nearly as heavily as we
do in Queensland and
Westralia, and one-twen-
tieth as heavily as the
British do in Rhodesia.
He burdens the Outlander
with outrageous cus-
toms tariff almost as
weighty as that of Maori-
land, Queensland, Tas-
mania, S.A., or Westralia.
You may have noticed in
the Melbourne Age that
the insupportable duty
on boots in the Trans-
vaal is one-fifth as heavy
as that levied in some
cases in Victoria. This
sort of thing makes the
blood of any free Briton boil. You will boil personally.
We boil by deputy—that is through you. You will boil
for us.
(18) In this country, years
ago, we had a suspicion
that an alien race was grow*
ing so fast that it would
presently outnumber our
own people. We didn’t offer
these aliens the franchise,
or give them naturalisation
as a matter of right, or let
them govern the country,
as a consequence—though
you are going to fight
the Boer for not doing these
things. Instead we put a
poll-tax on them, and other
restrictions, and taxed
Assisting emigration.
them without representation—even though many of
them were subjects of the glorious Empire for which
you are now about to fight—and the law winked
its other eye when the white miner cleared them
off some of our goldfields with pick-handles and
brutal violence; also, it was enacted in some pro-
vinces that they were not to be naturalised and have
votes under any circumstances, even after 80 years’
residence. The conduct-of the Boers in copying, even in
a very limited fashion, our just and righteous action is
infamous beyond words. Just here we choke with honest
British indignation.
(T 9) It is your glorious mission to go forth on this occa-
sion and fight for the Fat Man and the Absentee. Nine-
tenths of the wealth of the Transvaal is said to be owned
by Outlanders —mostly absentee mining corporations.
The fact that the Boers own only one-tenth of the
wealth of their own country shows clearly that they have
been extorting huge sums from the Outlander. The Out-
landers pay most of the taxes. You don’t give the
absentee a vote, and you also make him pay taxes. If
the absentee owned nine-tenths of the wealth of your
country you would make him pay most of the faxes also.
In two provinces you would make him pay extra taxes
for being an absentee. You therefore go forth to fight

ished convictions—which

who are not overbur-
dened with convictions
ourselves (one of us has
standing against hi s

you, alleged democrats
mostly, going off to be
shot in defence of the
Absentee and the Fat
Man, and in support
of the doctrine that
poverty, not wealth,
should bear the chief
tax burden, is interest-
ing. We a 1 ways thought that democrats were mostly
fools. Now we know that they'are. You are the very
worst kind—the sort that makes the gods shriek with
derision.
(20) You are expected to carry under your waistcoats
the glowing conviction that you are going to defend
people of your own race from outrage. The outrages
that have happened have been mentioned several
hundred dozen times in the papers. There are
said to have been two murders of British subjects;
also, a statement
appeared recently
that some young
Boers wrecked a
British trader’s

The Political Betrayal of Australia.
When the Q. contingent—who go to fight, in
a quarrel which is not theirs, a little people
defending their homes and liberty against over-
whelming foreign aggression left Brisbane
for the Transvaal, Chief-Justice Griffith,
K.C.M.G., uttered some remarkable words to
justify his new' Lieutenant-Governorship to the
givers. He told the men that the grounds of
the Transvaal war were no business of theirs;
that it was sufficient for them that Britain had
decided on w j ar; that they were to resign their
consciences and their right of private judgment
at the bidding of British politicians on the other
side of the world, whose motives they did not
know and whose actions they could not control.
A more scandalous, a more degrading doctrine
was never promulgated in a free community.
Yet in New South Wales a man whom Aus-
tralians have been taught to honor, Edmund
Barton, chorussed the public declaration of
Premier Lyne, that when Britain called it was
not Australia’s business to question : it washer
duty to blindly obey. When those who are
elevated to be leaders of the nation so betray
the trust reposed in them, who shall guide the
people? , * ,
We have no voice in the government of Britain;
we cannot lift a finger to influence her policy; we
do not, and in the nature of things we cannot,
take an active part in her plots and diplomacies,
her peace and war. Yet Chief-Justice Griffith
urges, and Edmund Barton urges, that


we are to blindly and unhesitatingly follow
her flag, no matter how villainous her
projects, how opposed to honor and reason her
acts! There is to be no more independent
judgment in Australia, no more national free-
will. We are chained to Britain’s imperial
chariot, and in its rut of blood we must follow,
with servile bodies and minds in chains.
Griffith and Barton declare that they are
loyal to Britain when they urge such slavery
upon us. The Bulletin declares that they are
false to Australia —to the land where they
live, to the country which has elevated them to
dignity and supports them in honor.
* * * *
In this shameful act of aggression upon a
patriot State to which Australia stands com-
mitted, she has been betrayed by her Parlia-
ments. The people have been taken unawares ;
and their minds have been biassed by lying re-
ports and still more lying suppressions in the
newspapers, and by specious arguments ad-
vanced by people whom they have been taught
to trust. The average Australian even
now knows nothing of the rights and
wrongs of the Transvaal war. The ever-aggres-
sive and fast-growing Australian military caste
have committed the Ministries ; the Ministries
have committed the Parliaments; and for lack
of a few men of spirit, and knowledge, and
standing, the Parliaments have misled the
people. There will be a heavy reckoning in
money ; there may be a heavier reckoning in
blood. It is more than time to publicly pro-
test against the unreason and disgrace of
Australia being led into unnecessary and
unjustifiable war. If there are in this
country any men who value its character, and
have hope in its future, The Bulletin
hopes and believes that they will unite in a
national league against shameless militarism
and the more shameless treachery which defends
that militarism in an evil quarrel. Private dis-
approval is of little use. From every city and
town of Australia there should come a public
disclaimer of the doctrine which binds Aus-
tralian liberties hand-anrl-foot and sells them
to Britain—in good cause, or bad, or none.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Forrest and Chaos.
Premier Forrest’s idea about how to take his
three-barrelled Federal Referendum in W.A.
(he wants to find out whether the people prefer
the present Bill, the proposed new Bill drafted
by a W.A. Parliamentary Committee, or no
Bill at all) are interesting but foggy :
Sir John Forrest replied that the issue would be very
simple. The question would be submitted as follows
1> Ar e you in favor of either bill—yes or no. 2. If
bound to have one Bill, which shall it be—the original
one or the one as amended by the select committee ?
Now, supposing out of 20,000 voters there are
8000 against Federation as expressed by either
Bill, but ]OOO of them think, if driven to it,
they would prefer the present Bill, and 7000
think they would prefer the proposed new
Bill; and there are 12,000 voters for Federa-
tion—7ooo for the present Bill and 5000 for the
new Bill—who would win? Supposing Barton,
and Reid stand for a one-member con-
stituency, and the vote is taken in this way :
“Do you want Reid to get in—yes or no?
But if you had to choose between Barton and
Wise which would you prefer?” What kind
of an expression of public opinion would
follow ? Or suppose it read : “Do you believe
in the imposition of an income-tax of Is.
in the £, but if you had to choose between
being drowned or burned alive, which would
you take”? If that question were submitted in
Sydney or Melbourne the chances are that out
of any thousand votes taken at random there
would be 500 for a Is. income-tax and 1000 for
being drowned. Premier Forrest seems to
have struck a unique device for obscuring the
issue beyond all human comprehension. For-
rest, by the way, proposes, as a means of add-
ing to the confusion, to put the two questions on
separate papers, so that out of the 8000 voters
for the present Bill, it would be impossible to
tell whether 7999 wanted it right out and the
other man only wanted it if he couldn’t secure
the defeat of both Bills, or whether it had only
one out-and-out supporter and the other 7999
preferred no Federation at all, and only sup-
ported this Bill as a less evil than the other
Bill.
♦
The Small Perjured Female.
A TRULY amazing event happened a few days
ago in Sydney—so amazing that the public
sat up with a shock and asked itself if it was
really in its right mind. The usual girl brought
the usual charge of assault against a man. It
was about as incredible as usual ; she alleged
that the crime was committed inside an omni-
bus driving through the city, and in the close
vicinity of any number of witnesses. The
case broke down under an overwhelming mass
of evidence for the defence, and (hen Judge
Docker committed the accused to take her trial
for perjury ! ! The Bulletin really believes
that, ainid the hundred, or two or three hun-
dred cases in which, within the last ten years,
it has been proved that a female laid an utterly
groundless charge of assault, and tried to bring
about the death, or imprisonment, of a man
from sheer spite, or love of notoriety, or other
objectionable reasons, there has hitherto been
no instance in which any attempt has been
made by the State to punish the perjurer. Even
the girl who got Buttnek sentenced to death
on a charge which she afterwards admitted to be
only the result of her foul and gruesome yearn-
ing after romance wasn’t so much as fined
2s. 6d. It has been tacitly understood until
now, among Judges, Attorneys-General, Crown
Law officers, and the like, that any woman was
privileged to perjuie herself with impunity
provided she did it in this particular direction.
In fact the Judge and the Attorney-General
have been the tacit accomplices of the unclean-
minded female who desired to get some man
hanged or imprisoned on a false accusation.
Charges of this particular kind arc more com-
mon in Australia than in almost any other
country in the world. The bulk of them
prove to be mere perjury (perjury committed
with absolute impunity) by evil-minded females,
and probably more than half the remainder are
cases wherein the accused was wrongfully con-
victed because the evil-minded female didn’t
happen to be found out. The Bulletin
doesn’t advance this as mere theory ; it
has good grounds for the assumption.
Coghlan, the N.S. \V. Statistician, publishes in
his “ Childbirth in N.S. W.” an amazing table
in which he shows that, among the women who
married in N.S. W, during the last six years,
nearly one out of every four was definitely con-
victed, by the date of birth of her first child, of
unchastity before marriage, and reckoning ille-
gitimate births in addition to these it seems
that practically one-half the young women of
N.S. VV. are provedlv immoral in the conven-
tional sense of the term ! There is no reason
to suppose that things are much better in the
other provinces, and when to those who are
provedly unchaste is added the necessarily un-
definable mass of cases where unchastity has
left no evidence the possible result is something
almost incredible. Men don’t need to commit
forcible assaults on so complaisant a race
therefore The Bulletin doesn’t believe in one-
tenth of the stories of assault. And in a
country where so enormous a proportion of
young women and girls have either to admit
that they fell willingly and of their own accord,
or protect their alleged characters by charging
some man with making their fall compulsory,
almost every charge brought by a woman
against a man should be regarded with intense
suspicion unless backed by the strongest of evi-
dence. N.S. W., of all places in the world, is
the one where no man should be con-
victed of this class of crime on the
mere uncorroborated assertion of any woman
—as Buttner and Suffield and many more
were convicted. The case above alluded to, by
the way, was one in which the accused had
friends and money, and could hire men to ran-
sack the city, at ruinous expense to himself, for
the needful witnesses to prove his innocence.
A friendless man without money would probably
have got three years and two floggings—in the
absence of that Crown Defender whom At-
torney-General Wise holds to be so wholly un-
necessary. Of course, if the charge had been a
capital one, he would have been allowed a sum
of money by the .Treasury for his defence—
about a quarter as much as it cost to rebutt
even this clumsy and easily-exploded perjury.
4.
Still Wanted—A Public Defender.
The proposal of Griffith, M.L.A., to appoint
a Crown Defender, as a fair counterbalance in
the case of impecunious prisoners to the Crow n
Prosecutor, has been rejected in N.S. W.
Assembly by a majority of more than 2 Lo 1.
Only a few members spoke, and these were
mostly lawyers who clung to the old precedents,
and the old groove, and the old rut, and could
see nothing wrong with the existing system.
The two most voluminous lawyers are thus
summarised by Sydney Telegraph: —
Mr. Meagher pointed out that 75 per cent, of the
criminal class were old offenders, so that the proposal to
appoint a Public Defender would be largely in theinterests
of such class. As to the legal aspect of the question, it
should always be remembered that the Judge to a large
extent, protected the prisoner. He could understand such
a proposal emanating from the Chamber of Deputies, but
not in a country where every man was held to be innocent
until proved to be guilty.
Mr. Wise (Attorney-General) said the Judge was
notoriously ihe advocate of Ihe prisoner, and the Crown
Prosecutor, although bound to prove the evidence
against the accused to its* legitimate extent, was also
bound by the traditions of his office and the
profession to which he belonged not to in any wav
unduly press the evidence against the prisoner. It
was also his duty to bring out any evidence in
favor of the accused. Any Crown Prosecutor of
experience would not hesitate, if he perceived
certain evidence which would tend to prove the inno-
cence of the prisoner, to draw the attention of the Judge
and jury to it. There might be cases where, under cer-
tain circumstances, momentary injustice would be done
to a prisoner, but this was at once corrected by the Judge.
Where a prisoner was undefended, as long as he held the
position of Attorney-General, if any member of the
House or any private citizen could prove that any Crown
Prosecutor had tried to unduly press any ease against a
prisoner, or wilfully omitted any fact in his favor he
(Mr. Wise) would very soon deal with that Crown Prose-
cutor. He thought they would believe, however, that
there was no Crown Prosecutor in this country who could
be so negligent of the high duties of his office or so for-
getful of the traditions of that office. In all cases where
a prisoner was to be tried on a capital charge provision
was already made in the Estimates for a sum of money to
fee leading counsel to prepare his defence.
These remarks are a striking instance of the
professional advocate’s inability to see more
than one side of the case. Here are some
glimpses of the other side :
(1) Seventy-five per cent, of the criminal classes ar enot
old offenders—at least Cogiilan, in his “ Wealth and
Progress of N.S. W.” for 1898 (page 818), estimates that of
the persons sent to prison in 1897 only about 27 per cent
had previous convictions, which doesn’t look it. And if
Meagher’s statement were true, it only means that when
a person has been once convicted, he is thereafter guilty
of every crime charged against him, and so doesn't”need
to tie defended.
(2) Australian law doesn’t hold a man innocent till he
is proved guilty. It is about time this moss-grown
wheeze was dropped into oblivion. It holds him guilty
from the first moment he is arrested, and (save in capital
cases, when it allots him a miserable 15 guineas wherewith
to battle for his life) it tells him that if lie isn’t guilty he
must hire men to prove his innocence, and find facts and
witnesses at his own expense. If he can’t do this it is his
own funeral.
(3) Attorney-General Wise says, without bringing for-
ward a scrap of proof, that “ the Judge is notoriously the
advocate of the prisoner.” Does he not know of scores
of cases where Judges such as Windeyer, and others who
could be named, were notoriously advocates against the
prisoner?
(4) If Wise’s statement were correct (which it isn’t), it
is only further proof of the utter rottenness of the pre-
sent system. No man can be an advocate for either side
and an unbiassed Judge of both sides at the same time.
(5) If Wise s statement were correct (which it isn’t),' it
is pure childishness to say that the Judge’s advocacy is a
fair defence. The penniless prisoner is looked up in gaol.
The police who locked him up have to make a good case
against him to justify their action. They scour ihe
country for hundreds of miles, it need be, for evidence
against the prisoner. No one scours the country
in his favor. The police may manufacture evidence
where the real article runs short (they have
every inducement to do so, for if the case fails it
reflects on the officer who arrested a man on insufficient
grounds, and if a crime is committed and nobody is
rightly or wron ly convicted of it, it means that the force
has been baffled, which is a bad reflection on its effi-
ciency)and t here is noone to Havel round in the prisoner’s
interest and keep an eye on their doings. The penniless
and friendless prisoner, in a difficult and complicated
case, is locked away helplessly while the other side
gathers evidence to convict him, and his case isn’t pre-
pared by any one. If in a civil case the defendant were
locked up to prevent him preparing his case and getting
his witmsses ready—what would Wise think of it ? And
B. It. Wise asks the public to believe that the man whose
witnesses are all or mostly absent, and whose case isn’t
prepared, is fully compensated if the Judge (who knows
nothing of the matter except what he has heard in court,
who hasn’t seen the missing witnesses, doesn’t know
them or their evidence, and who has learned the circum-
stances only from the carefully-prepared Crown case)
occasionally manifests a passing interest in him.
(6) Attorney-General VVise also alleyes that the penni-
less, friendless, undefended prisoner is all right, because
“if a Crown Prosecutor of experience perceived evi-
dence” in his favor he would mention it. Even if he
always did draw attention to such evidence when he per-
ceived it, what good is that? The trouble is that it isn’t
there to perceive. The evidence for the prosecution is
all there, but the locked-up prisoner can’t bring his own
evidence, and if he can’t pay anyone else to bring it how
is it to be perceivable ? So the promise that if the thing
which can’t arrive happens to get there and is perceived
it will be mentioned is just about nil.
(7) ?• R - Wise also says that if it is PROVED to him
(he being the sole judge of whether it is proved or not, and
ha\ ing already decided that the idea is quite preposl erous)
that any Crown Prosecutor WILFULLY omitted facts in
a prisoners favor (which can’t possibly be done unless the
C.P. admits it himself for no one can prove, save himself,
u 1 !v e f ¥‘ ts didn,t s!i P his memory) he will deal with
thatC.P. in some way not specified. Which is about as
safe a promise as any man could make. But what satis-
faction is it to the wrongly-convicted prisoner jf the C.P.
is dealt with—which, at the worst, can only mean de-
priving him of future Crown fees.
(S) The statement that in capital cases the Crown sup-
plies the means to fee “ leading counsel ” is hereby flatly
contradicted. The Crown pay's enough to fee a fifth-rate
lawyer, and about one-tenth of the amount required to
get lip an intricate case. Why, for a start, no leading
barrister would, even in these hard times, dream of
accepting a brief in a capital case at under 50 guineas.
(9) And B. R. Wise states that if injustice is done to a
prisoner it is “ at-once corrected by the Judge.” Is it
really? If an injustice is done to the prisoner because he
hadn t the means to bring valuable evidence from some
place hundreds of miles away, how is the Judge, who knows
nothing of that evidence, to “ at once ” correct the mis-
take? Of course very few cases of wrongful conviction
are proved. How can they be when there is practically
no legal machinery for proving them ? Sukfieui might
have proved that he was wrongfully' convicted if there
had been any court for him to prove it in—but there
wasn’t. So jong as a man can only prove that he is
wrongly convicted by petitioning the Minister for Justice
for a new hearing, and so long as the routine Minister
refuses flatly-, nobody will prove that he was wrongly con-
victed. The one way' to make justice infallible on paper
is to make dead sure that when once a man is convicted
he will never get a chance to prove that he was wrongly-
convicted, and that is about how things are in good old
N.B. W.
Jingo War Lies and Hypocrisies.
Anybody who wants to know the rights and
wrongs of the Transvaal war—or even to get a
true idea of its progress—must read the Cape
and English newspapers, not the scandalously
“cooked” cables in the Australian dailies.
Who in Australia could gather from what
has been printed in the local dailies that
at least one - fourth of the British Deople
are openly opposed to the war ? " Yet
London Spectator says so ; and the Spec-
tator is a war organ. Lyne and Barton,
Kingston and Dickson, and the other political
babies, may be given the credit of honest belief
that the British are fighting to give the Out-
landers the franchise. It is an insufficient
reason for war, if it existed ; but it does not
exist. The real casus belli, says London Star,
is Ooe v. Oom. Said A. E. Pease, the Liberal
M.P. :
Tbe real object of those who clamored for intervention
was the subjection of the Transvaal and the possession of
its material resources -the most sordid object most hypo-
critically- cloaked. The real crimes of the Boers were
three —(1) There was gold within their frontiers ; (2) thev
desired to retain their independence ; (3) they beat us at
Majuba Hill.
The Dean of Winchester writes :
But to what kind and degree of oppression are the
Uitlanders subject ? That they- suffer in various way-s
from the bad go\ eminent of a stupid, narrow-minded,
prejudiced people ; that they are unfairly excluded from
the franchise, and overtaxed, cannot be questioned.
Nevertheless, they grow rich. It cannot be said that
their lives or property are in danger, or that their wives
and daughters are subjected to insult and outrage. Less
than 70 y-ears ago some of our largest towns in England
were unrepresented in Parliament; the working classes
were shut out from the franchise ; wages in many depart-
ments of labor were very low, the cost of the necessaries
of life, especially bread, was high ; the elections were
practically in the hands of a wealthy oligarchy. The
demands for reform were met by a prolonged and stub-
born resistance on the part of the wealthier classes,
which were then dominant in the country. But would
these wrongs, which surely were quite as great as those
which the Uitlanders now suffer, have justified civil war?
Or, supposing that the sulferers had been French or
German settlers, would such grievances have justified
France or Germany in going to war with England ?
And hundreds of other prominent men in Eng-
land profess disgust, as well they may, at the
hypocrisy which puts the Oil blunders’ griev-
ance forward as a stalking-horse for British
greed to shoot behind. The white Labor Party
in Johannesburg expressly declares it does not
want war, seeing that if the Boers chastise
workers with whips, the Outlander-speculators
will chastise them with scorpions. The leader
of the Outlanders, the well-known Hebrew
speculator, Lionel Phillips, declares “we don’t
care a fig for the franchise.” President Kruger
offered a seven-years’franchise, which would at
once give 50,000 British residents the vote.
Chamberlain demanded five years and
Britain is really supposed to be fighting over
the two years’ difference! It is fighting
because the Rand speculators want the Rand
gold at their absolute disposal, and because the
Jingo party is aggrieved that the little Dutch
republics should stand in the way of the abso-
lute British ownership of South Africa. And
on behalf of the syndicators the Australians
have been jockeyed by a set of toadying Jingo
politicians to join in the fight in the interests of
pure Boodle.

“ Mean White ” to The Bulletin
While thanking you for publishing my let er of 26 6 ’9B
and thus drawing attention to the then threatened Jap.
invasion, I have to again ask you to inquire re the
rumored exploiting of Melville Island, N.T., by an Eng-
lish syndicate. This large island is situated at the ex-
treme north of Australia, and is practically unexplored.
Good agricultural land is known to exist, and being well
watered it is of considerable value—far too good to be
handed over to John Bill and Co. It seems unjust to
United Australia that the province of S. A. should he thus
giving away huge concessions at the present time. The
Territory is a big place, but the man who wants a
farm, or the prospector, very often has to go far
before putting in his pegs. Most of the earth
here belongs to someone who doesn’t know enough
about the country to locate its position in an atlas—
As for instance : (1) The N.T. Goldfields Co. (who have
grabbed an enormous tract of auriferous country, and
are mostly in a state of “ under tribute ” to our well-
beloved and trusty brother, An Fat). (2) The An-To-
French Co., now travelling under the disguise' of r the
“ Arnheim Land Development C 0.,” or words to that
effect—one hears so little of their efforts that it is hard
to recollect their correct name ; hut there is no Haw in
their grip on a fat slice of fine mineral country. Of
course, there may not be much in the report re Melville
Island, but you would be in a better position to ascertain
than I am ; and it appears (to me at least) necessary that
Federated Australia’s interests should he safeguarded
against a possible second Thursday Island, which nib-ht
easily occur if this Thursday Island, located amidst the
pearling-grounds, was allowed bv provincial apathy to
pass from ultimate Federal control. P.S.—By the way
are you aware that a double duty—one in Adelaide and a
second one at Port Darwin -is charged on sugar, rice
tea, molasses, opium, meal, and Chinese oil, coining from
the South into the Territory ? You also sneer at Queens-
land’s “weekly leper.” Well, anyhow, they do try to
oatch him, and look after him when caught; but S.A.
doesn’t, until he has grown conspicuously noxious, and
then it carefully lands him on an island, from which he
can (and invariably does) walk off to the mainland at low
water, before finally disappearing. Officially, he then
dies, as a strict search would only offend the Chinese. —
M.W.
Some London dockers went on strike a few
years ago and Australian workmen began to
make levies for their support. At once there
was a wild protest that it was wrong for
Australian workmen to contribute, until
they had weighed the Englishmen’s
cause. A little later during the Aus-
tralian strikes the doctrine was preached
that one union ought to help another whether
it had inquired into its trouble or not. The
mild protest became a howl and then a shriek—
it was “immoral,” “undemocratic,” “blind
folly,” and several other things. And the
avvfullest howlers and shriekers of all were
some of the very men who just now are saying
that it is enough to know that Britain has a
row on (in the Transvaal) because they are
Britons too ! Yah ! The spines of the N.S. W.
Laborists are of the consistence of strawberries-
and-cream.
♦
This, from Queensland Progress (owned and
edited by Drake, M.L.A.), has a ring of
genuineness about it:—
I dropped across a man the other day who had just
arrived from Johannesburg. He is a bright, athletic
Britisher, who was a stoker on one of the Transvaal rail-
ways and was receiving £l6 a month for his work. He
said he left the Transvaal with a number of his mates
because he saw war ahead ; and while lie could not take
up arms for the Boers against his countrymen, he could
not aid the British in crushing a people who had always
treated him with kindness and generosity. Interrogated
as to the state of things in Johannesberg, he said the
British and Boer merchants were close friends, and the
best of good fellowship existed between the working
men of all nationalities. It was quite a common
thing to attend a “musical evening’’ at the house
of an English shopkeeper and find the party an
even mixture of Dutchmen and Britishers. My casual
acquaintance, who is now staying at a Brisbane hotel,
says that during all the years tie was in the Transvaal he
never saw a Boer official insult an Outlander, and he
never knew of a case where a British subject was denied
justice in the law courts. His only complaint against the
Boers was that the men from the country “ were very ex-
clusive and did not, care to mix with foreigners.” Asked
whether he thought British rule would be preferred by
the British working classes in Johannesburg, he em-
phatically replied, “No ; the workers there think that
when the Rhodes crowd get full control of the Govern-
ment t hey will shift the taxation from the mine-owners
on lo the workers. Besides when the capitalistic crowd get
everything in their hands, and run the local police and
military, wages will come down with a run.’’ I place the
opinion of this man—a level-headed, fairly well-read, and
much-travelled Englishman—before anything that ap-
pears in prejudiced papers and faked’ “ letters to the
editor.” As 1 was speaking to him—at the corner of
George and Queen streets—the City Engineer was super-
intending the erection of a garland with the motto “Go
where glory waits you.” Looking up at the. letters the
itinerant stoker sardonically remarked, “Take mv tip
for it, old man, there is d little glory waiting there.
They ought to drop the l out of glory to be near the
mark.” If any reader of Progress doubts the truth of
the statements contained in this paragraph, I will have
much pleasure in referring him to the stoker who has
just arrived, and who has been the innocent cause of
these remarks.
In the matter of the Transvaal, Chambeflain,
the British war-invoker, is following precisely
the policy which he denounced in 1884, and
eating all the words he uttered then— when
there was even less reason for them than to-
day. In 1883 Chamberlain said
If the Orange Free State, as most probably would have
been the case, had joined with the Transvaal Boers, no
doubt Lord Salisbury would have declared war on it too.
And if then, what was not at all unlikely, the whole
Dutch population of the Cape had risen, Lord Salisbury,
with a light heart, would have led this country into a war
more serious in its consequences, more certain to be fruit-
less of good results, than any war in which we have been
engaged since we tried to compel the allegiance of the
American colonies.”—Mr. Chamberlain at Birmingham
31 March, ISS3.
The ex-Republican, ex-Liberal, is now a bitter
Imperialist ; and Chief-Justice Griffith and
others tell Australians that it is no business of
theirs to question his policy—it is their duty
(save the mark !) to fight in a foreign quarrel at
self-contradicted Chamberlain’s bidding !
An intelligent live alderman (most aldermen
are unintelligent and dead) of North Sydney
Council proposes this as a settlement of the
North Sydney bridge problem :
That this (North Sydney) Council will be willing to join
with the other municipal councils of North Sydney dis-
trict in guaranteeing to the Government any deficiency
between the net returns from the bridge and the interest
on the cost of construction, provided that the councils
have control of the traffic, and that they receive the
surplus when the returns exceed the amount of the inte-
rest and a sinking-fund.
That is, at least, a step in the right direction.
The facts which North Sydney needs to paste
in its hat, and on its beer-pot., and in all other
places where they will constantly meet the eye
are these: Whether the bridge is built by i| ]e
municipality or by a private company, the
people of North Sydney— the people who supply
the traffic by going back and forward between
their suburb and the city—have to pay, in tolls
and fares, the interest on the cost of the bridge
and tbe cost of all necessary repairs. If they
build it themselves, or get the Government to
do it under guarantee, the money (say =£500,000)
will cost about 3£ per cent, (say .£16,500 a year,
and, allowing £5OOO a year for repairs and
maintenance, £21,000 a year). If a company
builds it, the work will cost at least £lOO,OOO
more, for there are flotation expenses and first
robbers’ profits to allow for—say £600,000.
The co. will borrow part of that at almost cer-
tainly not less than 5 per cent., and it will
do its best to get 5 per cent, on its own money
making £30,000 a year, or, with £5OOO a year
for maintenance, £35,000 a year. And, as the
people of North Sydney have to supply the
money in either case, it is just a question
whether they prefer to build the bridge them-
selves and pay £21,500 a year, or get a com-
pany to build it and pay £35,000 a year. If
the other municipalities won’t join North
Sydney in saving all this money, North Sydney
should go into the speculation on its own, and
save the money itself.
Before the Victorian minimum-wage law came
into force there were 30 factories which em-
ployed unpaid child labor—so-called beginners
and appi entices, who gave their services gratis
in consideration of being taught a trade. They
are all paid now. In the trades where the
minimum wage applies the number of employes
has increased ; the average wages are hi "her;
the proportion of men employed is larger faud,*

enacted the minimum wage, and its experiment

There may not be much solid material in
the “ Geisha,” but it is evidently good enough to
fill Her Majesty’s for a week’s revival. The pub-
lic takes a deep, fatherly interest in O Mimosa
San, and O Hana San, and O Kinkoto San, and O
Iviku San, and Komurasaki San, to say nothing
of Nokori San, and Oyuoha San, and Koliana
San, and Bebe San, and Roly Roly San. They
are all nice girls who go along at a short, excited
trot, and are dressed in that indefinite Japanese
mosquito-curtain, which seems to begin nowhere
and to accumulate loosely 24 times round the girl,
till the far end of it perishes through inanition.
These thrilling Jap. clothes are fastened by noth-
ing to nothing in particular, and appear liable to
fall off at any moment, and the joy of speculating
as to how they keep on is an evening’s excitement
in itself. The stage Japan is a restful place where
no sordid work ever goes on. Nobody tries to
make a haggard living with a fruit-barrow on
which are 3G bananas of doubtful probity for 3d.
Nobody carries bricks up a ladder. No person
named Bill, or Hakodato, or Smith, arrives
home on Saturday night with a bloater in his
pocket and blackens his missus’s eye. In the
stage Japan people toil not, neither do they spin,
but they live by singing to each other, and swap-
ping tea, and wearing beautiful but indefinite
clothes, and making music on the little red bridge
that straddles over the little blue river. This
mild and gracious haziness has a good deal to do
with the success of the “Geisha,” and the auc-
tioning of Dorothy Vane to the big Japanese peer
with the brown-crockery countenance has a good
deal more. The audience would mostly like to buy
Dorothy itself, if, in the present dearth of cash,
it could get her on time-payment.
» * * •
The “Geisha” ends indefinitely and
begins ditto, and it has no middle worth swearing
by. It doesn’t pretend to any plot. Dorothy’s
object in being sold by auction is vague and un-
specific, and appears to arise mainly through
hysteria at her lover being sung to by the
girl with the bed-curtains wrapped around
her. But distant fields are green, and dis-
tant girls are browner than adjacent ones, and
the Jap. opera is good enough if viewed in a
purely Jappy atmosphere as Jappy atmospheres
are on the stage. It is finely mounted, and the
co. is as good as ever. Pauli hasn’t deteriorated,
and Bathurst wears the spiked helmet of a blame-
less military career with his old energy. The
absence of clever Rose Musgrove is regrettable,
but her place is filled so well by Nina Osborne
that it is only a mitigated grief after all. Ken-
ningham is a valuable addition to the company,
and Florence Perry is even better than she used
to be. On the opening night, howeyer, Dorothy
Vane, when she rushed over the bridge pursued
by the big wheelbarrow, was somewhat of a dis-
appointment. She proceeded to break her troubled
little heart with a hurried dab of red on each
cheek and another dab in doubtful perspective on
her lower lip, and the effect was dubious. As for
Lauri’s Chinaman Wun, he is, if possible, a more
mellow Mongol humorist than ever, and his bald
head glows with an unearthly radiance in the sun-
light. Howard Vernon is the only character w r ho
really makes this writer feel grieved all over.
Vernon deserves a better part than that of the
large despot with the earthenware countenance
who goes round oppressing his subjects in a petti-
coat. and getting married occasionally.

“ La Poupee ” will commence a six-niglits’
season on Saturday.

John F. Sheridan’s scrap of mirth ends
now at a more reasonable hour than it did on the
first night, so the most serious charge herein
brought against the Lyceum show is withdrawn.
The saving has been effected by cutting out a few
of the oldest jokes—the ones that were published
in the very earliest BULLETIN in the days when it
had a nude editor, and the Xmas number was
printed on basalt with an axe (said Xmas number
is now very rare, for after it came out the manage-
ment decided to suspend publication until Adam
should be born). A few of the jokes that remain
are old enough to go out alone at night in perfect
safety, and if two or three more of them dropped
off their absence would be thankfully received.
Still “ Columbus ” is good enough to justify this
paper in turning the breath of calumny off at the
meter—the right to turn it on again being always
reserved in case anything very ancient turns up
among the alleged humor of the thin gentleman
alluded to last week.
George Rignold decided to extend his
stormy career at Sydney Criterion for one week
more, so the chaste and elevating railway accident
will happen until to-morrow (Friday) night.
There begins to be a streak of pathos about the
openings and shuttings of the large old man. lie
is still capable of excellent work, but on the whole
he strikes more ba.d luck than good. The large
old man has out-stayed his welcome in Australia
exactly in the sense that Sydney Post Office tower
has been here too long. In other words he has
become an institution. This country is not partial
to institutions. The old stage favorite always
goes the same road. When he becomes a very old-
established favorite, the public is glad, right
down to its boots, to hear that he is going to re-
open for the 170th time after a three months’
absence in the other big city, which is also so
fond of him that business is seldom satisfactory.
On his first night a moderate audience applauds
enough for ten when he enters. After that
the public stay away pretty unanimously for
three months, and remark that Sydney or
Melbourne, as the case may be, would never look
the same without the old favorite, and if he left
permanently, the gap would be considerable ; and
when his season ends the public is very sorry, and
hopes he will soon be back. It is all through
having become too like the post-office tower. If
George Rignold and the post-office tower went to
America, or England, or South Africa for a year
or two, they would probably do really good busi-
ness in the new country, and when they came
back (if it was worth their while to come back),
they might be really appreciated. They are both
in the same situation. Probably people would
weep tears of joy at seeing the post-office tower,
and would give it their last copper —if it had re-
turned after a five years’ absence. As things are,
they are so fond of it that they don’t know it is
there.

At Sydney Palace George Dean still sings
his awful song of how “She Bumps.” He has
been singing it for ages and as long as misguided
people will applaud he will continue to do so. But
it is very dreadful. Costello has given up gibing
at the military and appears principally as the
Sheeny Coon, a weird apparition with a blazing
diamond that lights up the whole stage. And
some other people who have been on the pro-
gramme with reasonable success for a long time
are still there.

Harry Rickards has decided to rebuild the
burnt Sydney Tivoli on a better design. The
bygone Tiv. was inwardly rather a plain-looking
erection, but the new edition thereof is to be con-
structed on greatly improved principles. At least
it is intended that such shall be the case, though
sometimes too much improvement ends in disaster.
The Palace is a case in point; it was crowded so
full of improved principles that the average
manager apparently feels there isn’t room for him-
self and all the principles at the same time, and
the usual fate of the too-gorgeous structure is
blank emptiness. But Rickards is a manager of
great experience, and it isn’t likely that he will
fall into a mistake of that kind.
To-night (Thursday, 16th) Mdlle. Trebelli
opens her Sydney season in the Centenary Hall,
York-street, the Town Hall being otherwise en-
gaged. The gifted lady is assisted by the Maori-
land baritone John Prouse. There are to be three
recitals only—to-night, Saturday the 18th, and
Tuesday 21st. Mddle. Trebelli leaves for Europe
on the 22nd, so there is no chance of the season
being extended, and all those who wish to hear
real melody should make the most of the oppor-
tunity.

At Melb. Princess’s, the sun shines on the
Brough Comedy Co. as it never shone before. A
first week of brief revivals and mighty audiences
was followed on Saturday by a first production (in
Melb.) of “Gay Lord Quex,” a comedy which
would probably have prospered at any time, and
is undoubtedly going to do well just now. The
humor, the cynicism and wisdom of author
Arthur Pinero come out brilliantly, as usual, in
“Quex.” His work breathes the raw spirit of an
unwholesome, up-to-date little world, and shows
character-types in a plain state of respectable
depravity. A shocking comedy—as the London
purists complained—in so far that it tells many
truths outright, and suggests many others. Also,
worse still, an entertaining comedy, likely to draw
the crowd and shake the conceit of people whose
“morality” is a delusion always, and a snare
when it gets the chance.
» * * •
The keynote of the story is struck by Mrs.
Brough when she puts her foot on a chair and
pulls up her stocking. This time she clutches the
stocking through her skirt, so to speak, instead of
boldly seizing her hosiery, but she strikes the key-
note all the same. The effect is muffled, but the
ring of truth is iu it. Mrs. 8., the manicurist, is
going out for the day ; there are no men present,
so, like a practical business woman, she fixes up
her foot-gear with all possible haste. The heroine
of an ordinary stage-play lives in an artificial
world, where female legs are supposed to be held
sacred, but “ Quex ” deals with the actualities of
society, and gives to legs their full significance.
Woman appears minus wings and haloes in
this story. The unselfish, maternal phase of
their usefulness doesn’t happen to be brought out,
neither are they particularly loyal to anything
save their precious reputations. Two of them, for
opposite reasons, make assaults on the brand-new
virtue of old Lord Quex. One woman is a cold-
blooded trickster, who merely wants, to see
whether his lordship will go so far as to make her
scream for assistance ; the other is a giddy duchess
with a weakness for long, lingering farewells.
But Quex, at the age of 48, hopes to marry a com-
paratively innocent spinster and become a good
man, as reformed roues go, and he emerges trnun-
pliantly from a sequence of spicy scenes in a bed-
room, and secures the idol of his battered heart.
She is not a truly noble idol herself. None of the
characters are built that way. The comedy
simply goes to show that woman is the weaker
tiling, and that honor on the man’s part is
a very slowly acquired taste where alluring
charms are concerned. When a young man of 2d
gets the same temptation which the older sinner
had resisted, he fails without a struggle. Twenty
years later he will want to enjoy the satisfaction
of going straight, but in the meantime his girl has
seen him kissing the manicurist, and has promised
to marry the other fellow. Robert Brough is not
one’s idea, of a real Lord Quex, yet he plays the
part satisfactorily, because he is a keen, incisive
actor, and not too old, too young, or too short for
the task. Mrs. Brough, as the artful mani-
curist, seems not to put on enough style.
Her wiles are crude and rough, rather
than cat-like, and her old fault of over-em-
phasis in sjleaking is very noticeable. Miss
Temple, too, gives a hard, low-comedy turn to the
character of the sentimental duchess, but of all
the people who might have been stronger it may
bo said that the play makes them sufficiently in-
teresting. Miss Grace Noble is a success, likewise
the aged Countess and the bald-headed ruin who
spent his manhood’s prime in nursing malaria on
the West Coast of Africa. The very small parts
are carefully filled, and the show, taken for all in
all, has the honor of being the smartest thing ob-
tainable in Melbourne nowadays.

At Melbourne Royal the dredging of Miss
Dora Win ton from the Mersey’s muddy bed will
be discontinued after Friday, and on Saturday
the full strength of the Holloway-Anderson co.

the onslaught wiil be conducted regardless of ex-

“The Power and the Glory” until Christmas

The last nights of Dante are happening at
St. George’s Hall. Early next week the graceful
wizard will gather up the ashes of his burnt lady,
together with the empty pipes where the magic
supper comes from, and all the other mysteries
appertaining to his craft, and will move along in
the direction of Queensland. Melbourne took
very kindly to Dante from the first, not solely on
account of the things he does, but also because of
the wav in which he does them. Therefore the
news that he is about to go away for an indefinite
period may be expected to agitate the public mind
in a moderate degree, and ensure large farewell
audiences for the curly-headed identity.

G. W. Hunter, the Yaldares, and the same
other people as before are pegging away indus-
triously at the Bijou. The awful war-song of
Pelham, the British Patrick, continues to fetch a
mild response from the gallery, but even the gods
are growing tired of avenging Majuba, and they
don’t heap damnation on poor old Kruger with
the same energy as of yore. Pretty soon the time
will be ripe for a reactionary ballad to the
effect that “The Boer’s not so black as my ’at”
or something in the same line of sentiment. Fitz-
gerald Bros, finished their Melb. season with a
full tent on Saturday night, and the Circus and
Menagerie are now rushing through Gippsland at
the rate of six towns per week. Also, the Alex-
andra has resumed its normal state of emptiness.
The last dramatic co. which met its doom at the
Aleck was the absolutely awfullest on record, and
nobody seems to know whether the season lasted
longer than one night.

J. C. Williamson’s intense regret at leaung
Melbourne Princess’s (“most expensive theatre to
run ”) and his determination to settle down in
Sydney and spare himself the fatigue of spending
“ three months, of every year in railway journeys
between the two cities,” etc., etc., must have made
many people smile. Williamson, no doubt, would
be prepared to take a long lease of the Princess's
if the proprietors, of whom George Musgrove is
one, would accept reasonable terms. The Firm
paid a higher rent than the beautiful theatre was
worth, considering that it is badly situated for
chance custom. Nobody drops into the Princess’s
after 8 o’clock, to get out of the wet, or because
they have nowhere else to go to. Melb. Royal is
the place for casual careless patronage. For every
unpremeditated half-sovereign that trickles into
the toney Princess’s between 8 and 9 o’clock £5
will trickle into the Royal, for the simple reason
that it lias the best theatre site in Melbourne bar
the Opera House, which is now closed.

During the week’s run of “ Ma Mie
Rosette ’’ at Melb. Princess’s, an attack of in-
fluenza compelled Pauli to make way for P.
Bathurst as Henri of Navarre. Even the occursed
’flu has its uses. Bathurst, who is tall enough to
look the character, contrived to play it in a quite
Brownlowlikc style. Pauli was a weak, trivial
monarch. He missed his most important points,
as, for instance, in the scene where Vincent finds
him canoodling Rosette. The King is supposed to
curse the reckless folly of his amour, whilst sus-
pecting that a trap has been set for him, and he
should almost hiss the words from between his
teeth —“ into what a hornet’s nest have I fallen !”
Pauli spoke the line on the first night as though
he were addressing a casual enquiry to
circle.

“ ‘ From “ silk stockings ” to the Peerage,’ ” writes Thr
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ may never be written
after all, for Francis and May are ‘ out ’ after but five
years’matrimony. Australia’s old friend, Lady fiancis
Pelham-Clinton-Hope, n6e May Yohe, understudy for the
Duchessdom of Newcastle, is an ‘actress and a lady of
spotless reputation—excepting when she sines. A Lon-
don manager said, ‘ May lias only four notes ; but they re
corkers.’ The hope of May has fled from her without
apparent cause, and for the sake of Frank Clarks old
co. and other aspirants for the strawberry-leaves, it is
hoped the lady will sit on the castle drawbridge, weep in
the moat, but refuse to be outed.”
It is a thousand pities that poor Oscar Girard didn’t
live to see the N.S.YV. contingent depart. On that sad
wet Saturday, when tne dripping infantry trudged down
to the Kent with strange squashy sounds, lik-- trodden-on
toads in i heir hoots, there was just one thing wanting to
complete tile show. Oscar Girard, in tire glittering uni-
form of the Ante-Cigarette Society of Cohoes, with his
sword and his tassels, and his yellow cocked hat, tramping
manfully alongside George Dibbs, and keeping a much
better step, it is to be hoped, than that great tinancial
warrior, would have made things complete. But, per-
haps, the want was deeper than that. The show was
liadlv stage-managed. If the Government had engaged
Williamson and Bland Holt (who are both accustomed to
handle large bodies of troops), and given them a free
hand with the arrangements, the results should have
been superb. Think of the Waterloo tableau in the “ Royal
Divorce,” and consider how it ought to have been done
with the real men in front, and behind them, and siiading
imperceptibly into them, thousands of painted soldiers on
canvas, and miles of painted artillery, till it would seem
that 50,000 men were streaming down the streets;
and Riguold superintending the lime-light arrangements;
and Holloway bossing the supers who supplied the
applause !
Howard Vernon has a unique record as Ko-Ko in “ Mi-
kado.” When the opera was first produced at the
Melb. Royal, 14 years ago, he created the part of the
Lord High Executioner, and he has resumed the hald-

Vernon has never missed a performance, and to all intents
and purposes, has been the only Ko-Ko that Australia
has known.
Bessie Doyle, the Australian violinist, is not married, as
was lately stated in the press, to the rich Mr. Geo.
Bullough, of Kinloch Caslle, Oban, Scotland, whose ac-

and her mother travelled for a time, but to a Mr. Robert
Mitchell; it was Mr. Bullough who issued the wedding-
invitations, and the ceremony took place on board his
yacht. '
“ Snell ” : Sir Christopher’s kit, as displayed in “The
Liars,” affords an explanation of the deliberation ob-
servable in the movements of the British w ar boss start-
ing out to do batLle. If Redvers Buller, for instance,
carries along with him half the truck hurled about the
stage by the warrior in the comedy, the miraculous thing
is that lie ever got going at all. Gen. Brough has trick
chairs, trick baths, trick lanterns, cups, mirrors, &c.,
&c., all apparently tougher problems than a detailed
plan of campaign. The introduction of this military
mus um smothers the interest of the act, and the audi-
ence is gabbling about the General s patent folding bath-
tub and miraculous camp-stool, that twists into a
bassinet or a toast-rack, while Brough is throwing
cynical homilies off his chest.

Revenue and expenditure returns for the first
four months of llie financial year of the three provinces
which issue monthly reports of their outgoings :
Revenue. 1 ' Slir P lus -
Queensland ... £1,047,150 £905,882 £741,208
Westlaiia ... 874,297 772,011 102,286
Deficit.
N.S. Wales ... 3,0.26,196 3,447,723 411,627
Westralia commenced the year with an accumulated
deficit of £247,34!), so it is now reduced to £145,063.
Queensland’s surplus, as already mentioned, doesn’t
signify so much as might appear ; that province’s bill for
interest on the public debt is all to he paid yet. But one
very significant fact in the matter of loan expenditure
goes a long way to account for Queensland’s boom.
N.S.W. spent £635,132 of loan money in the four months
—erpial to £1 Bs. 4d. per inhabitant per annum. Queens-
land got through £394,521 —about £2 7s. 6d. per head per
annum. Almost every Australian boom, if carefully
inspected, arises out of artificial prosperity created by a
sudden and violent increase of borrowing.
The action of N.S.W. Supreme Court in fining
four aldermen of Lambton for not imposing a special rate
was in every way commendable. The pity is that the
aldermen of Sydney who voted against a sufficient in-
crease of rates to make revenue and expenditure meet
can’t be fined £lOOO each, with something extra for the
worst cases. About nine years ago Lambton raised a loan
of £7OOO from the Commercial Bank of Australia to pay
for an electric-lighting plant. Then it hadn’t the energy
to tax itself to pay for the advantages it enjoyed, and up
to 1894 it met neither principal nor interest. When the
bank sued for its money a mean and unsuccessful attempt
was made to repudiate the debt on the ground that cer-
tain necessary legal formalities hadn’t been fulfilled
before borrowing ; the plea virtually being that Lambton
shouldn’t pay its debt because of its own illegal action.
The bank obtained judgment, and then the aldermen re-
signed so unanimously that there wasn’t a quorum left.
Every resident who was approached on the subject re-
fused to be an alderman—it is alleged that almost every
male ratepayer in his right mind, and out of gaol, was
applied to—and municipal government left off. Then the
Governor nominated aldermen by virtue of a power which
the State retains to meet such eases—a power which is
little known, and which came on the municipality by sur-
prise. The new aldermen also neglected to levy the re-
quired special rate, and the bank was no “ forwarder.”
Next it obtained an order from the Supreme Court that the
necessary rate should be levied ; the mayor proposed a
spe "al rate of 6d. in the £; and the proposal was rejected,
fout aldermen voting against it. At this stage the law
came down on the four with a fine of £lO each and costs,
and imprisonment till said moneys were paid—which is
a remarkably good thing tor the better and cleaner muni-
cipal government of N.S.W. And now the Commercial
of Australia begins to have hopes of at Jast getting back
some of its loan.

The latest tontine idea is that of the Riverina
Co-operative Life Assurance Trust (Albury, N.S.W.).
This concern lias made arrangements with the National
Mutual Life Association for the issue of life policies under
a special table. Said i>olicies are payable at death only,
but are oil the 20-year plan—i.r., after 20 annual pay-
ments they become fully paid-up and are free of all
charges, though still entitled to profits. And it is
specially arranged under the new table that if the person
assured dies within the 20 years during which the Trust
lasts, the Association pays the full amount of the policy,
and returns all premiums paid, with 3 per cent com-
pound interest thereon. Every member of the trust in-
sures his life for a larger or smaller amount, and
transfers the policy to the trustees. The representa-
tives of those who die receive back the premiums paid
on their policies, and interest thereon, the amount
of the insurance itself goes to the Trust, and is divided
among the surviving members at the end of 20 years—the
survivors also receiving back their own policies. Obvi-
ously if 60 persons join an institution of this kind, and in-
sure their lives for £lOOO each, and 30 of them die within
the 20 years during which the trust lasts, the remaining 30
will get back their own policies and have in addition
£30,000 to divide among them, together with all the in-
terest earned by the investment of the policy moneys.
And with regard to the 30 who die, their representatives
will receive back all the premiums they paid, with 3 per
cent, interest, so they won’t have done so badly. The
only incurably bad feature about the business seems to he
that, instead of the policies and the cash as it comes
in being held by a solid joint-stock institution
—a Trustee company for preference—which doesn’t
die, or go off its head and be put in an asylum,
and which has a big capital behind it as a guarantee that
all will be well, two Albury business-men are to act as
trustees. Twenty years is a long time, and a great many
things often happen to two most irreproachable business-
men in that period. Also, a possible 115,000 or £20,000,
or £30,000, is a lot of cash, saying nothing of the value of
the policies. The private business-man’s safe is some-
times cheap and unreliable. If he loses the money in bad
investments he hasn’t £975,000 of uncalled capital to fall
back upon. He may fall downstairs and land on his skull,
and become mentally unreliable—a whole trustee co.
never all falls down the stair on its skull. And many
other things have been known to happen. Altogether,
the present writer regards this objection as practically
insuperable. Otherwise the scheme looks good enough. -

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. has a weird
knack of always earning almost exactly the amount of its
10 per cent, dividend—the surplus being just sufficient to
relieve the monotony of things a little. Profits for the
last few t ears have been :
March, 1594 .. 4 99.914 March. 1597 .. £85.473
September, 1594 £97,489 September. 1897 £85,391
March, 1895 .. £90,642 March, 1898 .. £85,725
September, 1895 £85,309 September, 1898 * 85,404
March, 1896 .. £85,167 March. 1899 .. £85,581
September, 1596 £85,546 September, 1899 £85,812
Dividend for the half-year at 10 per cent, per annum
absorbs £55,100, so the surplus is £712. And on such a
huge amount this is st riking it very accurately indeed.

The unlucky Federal Talace Hotel Co., Mel-
bourne, closes the year to 31st .Inly with its usual ill-for-
tune. In 1897 this concern made a profit of £1237. In
1898 there was a loss of 'lB2. The loss for 1599 is £125,
so it is a little better than last year’s return, but not
much better. The Federal began its wild career with a
paid-up capital of £122.752, anti of this £109,990 has been
written off as lost, leaving a mere fragment of £12.762 as
the present parl-up capital. There is a mortgage of
£OO.OOO on the co.’s sky-towering structure, and the
interest on that swallows up everything. There is no
earthly prospect of lifting the mortgage, either; a mort-
gage that amounts to five times the paid-up capital isn t
easy to lift. If the supremely idiotic Victorian law would
allow the Federal to get a liquor license things might im-
prove, but that statute—constructed in the days when
the Cold-Tea doctrine of Jimmy Munro lay heavy on the
land—is adamant.

being the second Melb. institution of its kind which has
got back to this desirable state within the last few
months. The is something unusual among
Melbourne building-societies. It never suspended, re-
constructed, asked its depositors for extended time or
reduced interest, wrote off capital as lost, or burst in any
shape or form whatever. It transferred its reserve of
£7500 to contingency fund to cover possible losses, ana
for a few years it suspended dividends, adding its earn-
ings to contingency fund instead, and that was all.
Profits during the bad times were as follows :
1892 .. £8265 1896 .. £1917
1893 .. 5148 1897 .. 2254
1894 .. 3378 1898 .. 2473
1895 .. 3046 1899 .. 2768
In 1894 the Langridge found it necessary to reduce the
interest charged on mortgages by 1 per cent., which
accounted to a great extent for the drop in profits. Up
to 1893 all earnings were added to contingency fund to
protide for possible loss in the realisation of securities.
The fund now stands at £29,915, which is considered suf-
ficient provision as against £128,271, nominal value of
securities. Out of this year’s profits, therefore, it has
been decided to pay a 2 per cent, dividend (£1682), which
leaves £lOB6 to carry forward. The gross earnings are
equal to £4 12s. 9d. percent, and the net earnings to only
£3 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum on the alleged net value
of the assets, and these figures don’t look as if the provi-
sion for depreciation was any too large. At all events,
the St. Joseph’s Society (Sydney) realises >6 16s. per
cent, gross or £4 10s. percent, net on the written-down
value of its assets, and though this is much better than
the Langridge’s earnings, it isn’t satisfied, but is devoting
its profits to further writing-down. The best feature
about the Langridge Society is that it works on e 85,000
of its own capital and rather less than £13,000 of deposits,
and the visible reason why it never required to reconstruct
was that it never overburdened itself with borrowed
money. It seems a pity, however, that the management
didn’t apply £lOOO of the £lOB6 which remains at credit
of profit and loss as the beginning of a new reserve-fund.
The re-establishment of the reserve is a work which can’t
be commenced too soon.

Tooth and Co., Limited (Sydney), constructors
of beer and other allegedly demoralising drinks—some
recent profits :
March, 1893 £40,435 September, 1596 ... £35,.72
September, 1893 ... 36,455 March, 1897 42,555
March, 1884 37,603 September, 1597 ... 35,573
September, 1894 ... 32,048 March, 1898 42,778
March, 1895 ... 40,765 September, 1898 ... 36,125
September, 1895 ... 34,319 March, 1889 . ... 43,241
March, 1896 43,568 September, 1899 ... 38,296
The usual dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum
absorbs £31,509 ; £5OOO is added to reserve ; and £2500 is
written off for depreciation of plant. These amount to
£39,000, so. the profit-balance is reduced by £794 — from
£10,159 to i 9365. Tooth and Co. paid 8 per cent, divi-
dends for a long time, until 1893 ; since then, the co. has
paid 7 per cent, and gone in for strengthening the reserve,
which, at the beginning of 1893, was only £37,500. It is
now £95,000, and the profits are steadily growing larger.
The September half is the one when the public thirst is at
a minimum, and this is the best September half for many
years.

Mr. J. Murphy, lately from Papua, where he
spent eight months, gives to a Rockhampton paper an
awful account of the New Guinea goldfields. The miners
are, for the most part, eking out but a miserable exist-
ence, while the fever scourge is as rampant as ever. Of the
38 men composing the party with which he landed in New
Guinea, as many as 16, to his own knowledge, died of it.
There were upwards of 200 men on the field during the
first week of his visit, but of these he thought no more
than 70 now remained.
• • • •
A working miner, lately from Woodlark Island,
does not give a too enthusiastic account of the place,
which he declares is a horrible one to live in. His party
did well by selling out their claim as a surface show,
guaranteeing nothing as to reef or lode bearing gold :
“ There’s our lease : take it for what you can see.” “ But
aren’t there good reefs there, with rich gold?” asked the
enquirer. “ Our first work there was from 3dwt to 4dwt.;
then we got patches with an oz. ; then many patches
better and worse. It is an outlandish and expensive
place, and it takes a good yield per ton to pay.” “ Have
you heard of or seen any stuff over there that would go
20oz. to the ton ? ” “ I haven’t heard of or seen such a
thing while on the island ; but, mind you, I could get a
load of stuff together, with a lot of trouble, by picking
veins and fossicking for specimen pieces of quartz.
I say I could get a load that would give a
big return ; but I wouldn’t promise a second.”
“ I suppose you men made the most of your hands and
brains to sell your claims?” “ Why should you suppose
we are bigger fools than other people ? You ask me one
question and I ask you another.” In view of this it would
be interesting to know exactly how the specimen 17cwt.
sent for crushing, and which was reported to yield 230 z.,
was gathered—whether it was taken just as it came to
hand, or picked ? Also what has become of the alleged
promise to send a second and larger parcel to Dapto for
further proof of the richness of the lease or leases. Like-
wise why have the shares slumped so greatly since the
arrival of the manager in Sydney ? Has some southerly
breeze blown in the cold truth? If not, why have the
cornering gentlemen relaxed their squeeze?
It is a solemn fact that not enough is yet known
of Woodlark Island to justify the public in investing
boldly. If the directors would only send along some very
well-known man to report, they'would, if the glowing
representations made to them were anything like borne
out, easily get the ' 20,000 additional capital they now ask
for, to pav for the other leases under offer and square-
up things generally. Woodlark Island, according to some
of the Charters Towers people, is a very big tiling indeed.

Opal-mining is a precarious game. After
stumbling on the gem, for which there are scarcely more
“ indications ” than there are in fossicking for goid-slugs
in an alluvial patch, the digger has to risk the market. It
takes a man with a lot of experience to at all accurately
value an opal stone ; and as the market consists mainly
of shrewd gentlemen named Isaac and Jacob, the new-
chum mostly gets “ left.” Also, it is suspected sometimes
that Isaac arid Jacob are not such bitter enemies as they
seem to be in the street. But, worse still for the digger,
the only Australian opal-fields of any account are in the
Never-Never, where the bigger dealers decline to remain
through the summer ; so that from October to March the
local gem-market is as flat as a western plain.
If the digger worked for a co. with some
capital this would not matter much ; but as it
happens, when the opal-digger is not absolutely on
his own he is on tribute. One of the periodical slumps
has just occurred, and there is tribulation at White
Cliffs, the far-back N.S.W. field where 1500 men have
lately been making anything from a very small crust and
a very little dripping up to <8 or £lO a week. The Eng-
lish co., not satisfied with its percentage on the prices
ruling, has been sacking tributors wholesale, and three or
four hundred men are on their uppers in the wilderness a
couple of hundred miles from anywhere.
» * * *
A usually well-informed correspondent alleges ;
“The trouble with the White Cliffs opal field is ‘leakage,’
and unless the management can persuade the authorities
to introduce proper regulations to control the opal in-
dustry, the town itself, built entirely from the mines, will
again become the haunt of the dingo. The ‘ leakage
from the Company's claims has been large from the jump,
but latterly it must have comprised 80 or 90 per cent, of
the good opal. It is said to be the work, mainly, of two
or three persons who lay themselves out for the stolen
opal and tempt the men into the traffic. As the result of
recent disclosures all bands but 50 have been discharged
from the Company’s claims ( ostensibly by reason of dm-
ness in the opal market) and the only chance for the Cliffs
is stringent legislation directed chiefly against the
* cronk ’ buver.”

Broken Hill Block 10’s gross profit last half-year
(to Sept. 30) was £57,481; net profit (making allowance for
depreciation, &c.), t'54,242. Divs. amounting to £30,000
were paid ; t'30,000 was put to reserve (this is the co.'s
beginning in that respect) ; and £47,899 is carried for-
ward, as against £53,657 brought forward from the pre-
vious half. Including the Vic. Gove. 3 per cents, which
constitute the reserve fund, the liquid assets on Sept. 30
were worth £100,245 ; liabilities amounted to £10,613.
The surplus was thus £59,632. The object of the reserve
is not stated ; presumably it is chiefly to provide machin-
ery for zinc treatment when developments warrant the
expenditure. Profits during the last four half-years have
moved in this way :
March, 1898, £20,546 March, 1899, £.50,723
September, 1898, £40,209 September, 1899, £57,481
The quantity of ore handled has gone from 53,866 to
77,185 tons. That is, while profits have advanced 95 per
cent, the output of ore has advanced only 43 per cent.
It would be pleasant to believe, as it has been so often
represented, that this very good result has been due to
improvements in the processes of treatment ; but, unfor-
tunately, the figures will not allow us to believe anything
of the sort. From an average of 2s. 2.)d. (nearly) in the
half-year ended March, ’9B, the price of silver has gone t.o
an average of 2s. 3jd. (nearly) in the last half-year ; in the
same time lead has gone from £l2 16s. 3d. to £l4 10s. lid.
The quantity of silver in the concentrates last half-year
was 439,7840 z. ; of lead, 8313 tons. So here we have prac-
tically' the whole increase in the dividends accounted for.
The fact appears to be that the improvements made in
the concentrating processes have hardly more than coun-
terbalanced the deterioration in the character of the ore
—that is, the ore, while fairly-well maintaining its metal
contents, has become harder, and thus more difficult and
costly' both to mine and to crush.
The directors of Block 10 state that “ most im-
portant advances have been made towards the successful
and profitable treatment of the zinciferous material by
the application .of magnetic separation.” They have
“ had demonstrated to them on a small scale the success-
ful treatment of a portion of the co.’s dump (of 166,000
tons), which leads them to the belief that within a short
time the whole of this product will be easily and cheaply
dealt with.” But even if the zinc can be concentrated,
much will still remain to be done in concentrating the
silver and lead. Here is the present position : Last half-
year 77,185 tons of ore were raised and concentrated. The
at present marketable product was 12,680 tons of concen-
trates. The balance (except a little slimes, &c.) went to
this dump of “zinciferous material” —tailings it used to
be called : stuff, anyhow, which is not taken as an asset
in the accounts. The concentrates contained 439,7840 z.
silver and 8313 tons lead. The ore (77,185 tons) was
worth ltijoz. silver, 17£ per cent, lead; that is, it
contained 1,2G0,6550z. silver and 12,600 tons lead.
Therefore, while 439,7840 z. silver was saved, 820,90-loz.
went into the dump of “ zinciferous material ’’
which is not taken as an asset ; and while 8313
tons lead was saved, 4257 tons lead went into the
dump. Summed up. then, Block 10 makes its £lOO,OOO a
year out of one-third of its silver and two-thirds of its
jead ; practically the whole of the zinc and the other one-
third of lead and two-thirds of the silver go into the
dump, which isn’t an asset yet so far as the accounts are
concerned, hut which the directors hope to convert into
one hy-and-bye. And that, as applied to this one co., is
the “ zinc,problem ” of Broken Hill; for it is the presence
of the zinc in close association with the lead and silver
which prevents cleaner ore-dressing.

The situation in Victoria over the law relating
to mining on tribute is a peculiar instance of want of
grit, or foresight, or presence of mind, or something . on
the part of the responsible Minister. Said law provides
that the tributer shall have a claim on all gold up to one-
half the ordinary current rate of wages—which gives him
a claim to about 225. 6d. per week ; if the mine is poor,
and the trihuter's share of the proceeds under his agree-
ment don't amount to 225. Gd. or thereabouts per week,
the agreement is suspended so far as to ensure the tributer
this minimum wage. The “ subsistence clause,” in fact,
is a very moderate application of the minimum-wage
principle. The figure was made excessively moderate for
the express purpose of preventing abuses ; if the tributer
had a lien on all gold up to, say, £2 10s. a week, he would
probably only produce that much, hut few men would
voluntarily live-on 225. Gd. a week. Just before this
law came in force most of the , Ballarat tributes
were renewed for lengthy terms, so as to evade its
operation as long as possible. Now many of them are ex-
piring. The mine-owners allege—as most employers
allege about the minimum wage under all circumstances
—that the terms are ruinous, that they will put an end
to tributing in many mines, and throw a most deserving
class out of employment, &c., &e. No doubt this is, to a
great extent, only the regulation bluff of the employer
against the minimum wage. Possibly, if the Minister
simply said that the law must be enforced (it hasn't had
anything like a fair trial yet) things would simmer down,
and it would be found that tributing would goon just as
usual. Every progressive idea lias been met with the
same shriek of ruin and eertain disaster. But the Minis-
ter hasn’t Hie courage to enforce the law. nor the courage
to repeal it. so he proposes to compromise bv unlawfully
suspending it on bis own authority—which illegal act will
bring him lots of trouble hereafter.

North 1)101101 Lyell: Cabled from London thab
it is proposed to provide another ClOO.Oni) capital by i lie
issue of shares : money to he used on the railway, in de-
velopment., and for other purposes. Declared in Mel-
bourne that the mine is earning at the rate of £GouO a
month, and it is expected to be earning £15,000 a month
after the New Year, when larger quantities of ore will be
sent to the Mount Lyell smelter. Then why not pay for
the new works out of profit and keep the shares? Any-
how, itjs only another proof of the enormous amount of
money required to open up these mines, and many little
copper mines will go to sleep when this fact is more
generally recognised. m 0 0
From Mount Lvell (Tas.) The Lvell camp is
looking well. In fact it never looked better—especially
the big mine, where the No. 6 level has put a different com-
plexion on the concern. The South Tharsis concentrat-
ing will be a success. It is a simple mechanical concen-
trating proposition. The plant is especially well-designed
for classifying the products, and a high extraction is pro-
bable. With the start of this plant and its successful
treatment of the low grade schists on Lyell, there will be
a mild boom in the smaller L.yell stocks, more especially
those on the western fall of the Mount.

Carnage South, some 40 miles from Cool-
cardie.—Owners last week dollied upwards of 800 oz. in a
few days ; said to have taken out lOOoz. before ; have GO
to 70 tons of 15oz. “ tack ” at grass, and a lot of gold in
sight in the mine, where the stone is said to be literally
held together with gold. Unfortunately, the mine on the
gold knobs of which you can hang your hat has usually a
very short life. However, the Carnage South owners
have had all the luck of it. About a year ago they
bought the Carnage lease itself for £5 ; subsequently
sold it for £3OOO, and took up the adjoining land where
their luck still pursues them. Probably, if they wished
it, they could get the Carnage lease back again fora fiver.

Chillagoe and Mt. Garnet : Prominent officers

account for the slump in the shares of these concerns,
and all have given the usual assurance that no develop-
ments have occurred in the mines to give cause for appre-
hension as to the way the different ore bodies are opening
up. It was alwavs thus. None the less, the market talks
differently. The public has probably arrived at that
stage of the game when it is beginning to reckon up the
cost of getting these mines into a copper-producing state,
and is probably asking itself where the copper market is
likely to go in the meantime. This month the metal fell
£3 per to:i in less than a week. What it may do before
any Chillagoe or Mt. Garnet copper arrives goodness only
knows.

It is whispered (but, of course, not in the
daily press) that five members of that part of the
N.S.VV. Contingent which embarked at Sydney
on s.s. Kent disappeared from the ship while she
was still in harbor—and they are not believed to
be drowned either. If they are still alive they
must indeed be brave men—-for it would be much
more nerve-racking to face your friends than to
face the Boers under all the circumstances. Which
remark more or less applies to such, if any, of the
returning N.S.W. Lancers as cannot show con-
vincing reason for their unexpected re-appearance
in these parts.
It caused a big shock to Jingo circles to find
that 35—exactly one-third—out of the 105 Lancers
who all volunteered in England for active service
and were accorded such a gorgeous send-off
by the Cockney population were not going
to the front after all, but were inglori-
ously coming back .to Sydney. Of course
it has all been elaborately explained. In
the first place, several of the troopers were under
age, and the N.S.W. Govt, had, at the request of
their relatives, cabled instructions that they were
not to go to the war. Then some of the Lancers
had often been in hospital during their stay in
England, and were obviously unfit for service ;
also the employers of quite a number of the men
had called on them to return to work, without fail,
at the end of the leave originally given, and they
are returning accordingly. Now, it is printed
that the fond mothers are all indignantly pro-
testing that they were quite ready to sacrifice
Augustus, Reginald, or Algernon on the altar of
HE WANTED TO GO.
“I wanted to yo awfully, don’tcherknow, but they
couldn't find ROOM for me!”
St. Jingo, and that they never asked that he
be sent l>; k at once, and that they are quite sure
he would go Boer-killing if allowed. Also, the
employer excuse is weakening in the joints some-
what, and the further the matter is pursued the
more painful the subject becomes.
Truth to tell, the wind is already leaking out of
this rascally Contingent business. The public
begins to see “ the works ” with which it is sought
to maintain the hollow and transient enthusiasm.
In the first place, the fund, started for the pur-
pose of insuring the precious lives of the gaudy
“ Lanceahs ” for .£2OO apiece, only realised enough
to insure them for .£lOO each —which is pro-
bably the full value of any citizen of a pro-
fessedly free and democratic State who would
willingly associate himself with so base and dis-
graceful a scheme of plunder. And, after all,
most of the money raised came in big cheques
from wealthy persons more or less directly associ-
ated with the painted regiment which some years
ago harried a man out of its ranks because he—
aw —sold socks over a countah.
The “Patriotic” fund is in its wayhaving ashard
a time as the ‘Lancer-insurance scheme. Despite
the frantic whip-up of the whole daily press the
rank-and-file of the population is “not taking
any ” and not a few of the business firms who are
sending cheques are doing so merely under stress
of polite black-mail—“ Jones and Co. have given
ten guineas, so we’ll have to send a cheque. Charge
it to advertising account.” Then subscriptions
are being obsequiously promoted among the
employees of some big concerns because it will
please the boss, who has subscribed largely, and
the military clique and Naicest society racket is
being worked for all it is worth by all the most
prominent male and female toadies. But the
enthusiasm is merely pumped-up ; underlying it
all in the public heart is the conviction that the
Transvaal war is a cowardly scheme of plunder
and that Australia’s participation in it is a crime
against mankind.

When the well-boomed Mounted Rifle
portion of N.S.W. War Contingent (the Rifles,
according to the newspapers, were volunteering
almost to a man) had collected all volunteers
only 70 could be raked up able to pass the Doctor.
98 were required, and as this meant letting in 20
more of the hated Australian Horse, the
“ Mounted Foot ” proceeded to recruit in Sydney
and fill up with civilians, seamen, infantry men—
anyone who happened to come along. Most of
the accepted when given horses didn’t know the
kicking end and promptly fell off when the nag
cantered. The public got a glimpse of their
knowledge when, after the farewell at Barracks,
they were ordered “right-about turn” and a
swarm of them turned “ left-about.” This
was the mob that couldn’t hit the target on Rand-
wick rifle range. Parliament should have a few
questions to ask on the matter.
And is there anything funnier than the
address made by General French to the men of
the Mounted Rifles and Australian Horse who,
chagrined at finding themselves trapped into act-
ing on board ship as grooms to several hundred
Imperial horses consigned to South Africa, began
to murmur and had their grievance ventilated in
Parliament. “To look after horses,” said the
General—surely he is an Irish gintieman who is
quite sure he has his finger on the Australian
pulse—“ is one of a soldier’s noblest duties—he is
caring for his faithful ally on the battlefield.”
Then he yelled that there was no compulsion and
that anybody who didn’t absolutely love minding
horses could fall out ; and, of course, nobody
dared publicly fall out. Also, of course, every-
body cursed under his breath at being shanghaied
as a groom to J. Bull.
What young Australia is rushing after to the
Transvaal is, of course, a Government billet. In
Australia half the population is ready to
commit robbery and murder, or thereabouts, to
get a Government billet in any part of the earth.
But the billet-hunters draw the line at washing
the “ faithful ally.”

The present is not the first time that Tas-
mania has exported warriors. On 6th Oct., 1863,
a “contingent of military settlers ’’ left Hobart
by the s.s. Derwent Hunter for the Maori war.
There were 83 all told. Quaintly says Hobart
Town Mercury of Oct. 7, 1863
They are on the whole a fine body of men, and seemed
Hi the highest spirits. One great point in their favor is

A Hobart Mercury, Oct. 9th, 1899, item
concludes
The names of volunteers for the Tasmanian contingent
about to proceed to the front in South Africa were taken,
viz.l lieutenant, 2 non-commissioned officers, and 7
gunners.
There’s no place like home.
The last sentence is part of an ad.—but it has a
cruel apropos.

The Tasmanian Transvaal goat-hunters
were thoroughly kissed at their final leave taking.
The troop-train left Hobart platform at 6 a.m.,
and the early-morning female was present in large
numbers and in various stages of dishabille. One
sweet young tiling, clad in yesternight’s muddy
shoes and a dress hooked on anyhow, was bodily
yanked up on to the footboard on the off side of
the train, where she kissed no fewer than four
warriors. She blushed furiously, and the crowd
grinned loudly as each volunteer in turn pre-
tended to screen with his wide-awake his next-
door mate’s soulful nose-rub.
Women should never argue with those
beneath them. In fact, they can’t. Writer saw it
tried the other day when the Transvaal-bound
brigands were leaving a Southern city. Train
couldn’t start until the girls could be induced to
climb down off the exalted footboards. The rail-
way officials ordered them down, and some of the
girls turned to argue the point. But, as their feet
were on a level with the bold, bad porter’s eyes,
the argument was over in no time, and the lydies
hurriedly elected to wave their final good-byes
from terra firma.
TOO LATE.
INDIGNANT SKIPPER (to very flighty “lady” passenger): “If you think, madam,
you are going to imperil the good name of my ship with impunity , you
are mistaken. I shall take steps to”-
SHE (sweetly) : “My dear captain, you are TOO LATE.”
“ J.D.” : Was in a Hobart seedsman’s shop,
the other day, when a woman asked for “ six-
pen’north of concubine seed.” Without a smile
the shopman fulfilled the order—-of course, out of
the columbine drawer. He told me that the
blunder was so common it had ceased to tickle
him.

A measure is before Queensland Parlia-
ment for the legitimatisation of children
born out of wedlock, whose parents afterwards
marry. A good idea, but not large enough to
meet such a very large case. The unlawful
infant is growing so numerous now that
Australia will have yet to consider ways and
means for legitimatising the children whose
parents don’t marry—by declaring them the
legitimate children of an official State
Father, for instance. It isn’t absolutely
necessary that he should be a human
being ; the unwedded lady “in
trouble” could come to a Govern-
ment office and be formally mar-
ried to an official iron parent,
called Fitzgibbon or Beau-
champ, and his death from
excessive drinking could be
registered afterwards, so as
to leave her free to marry
again if a real flesh hus-
band came along. Or,
if the constant registra-
tion of Beauchamp’s death
from excessive drinking was
calculated to discredit this coun-
try by making the mortality
from alcohol excessively high,
he could be put down as
drowned in a heroic attempt
to save life during a ship-
wreck. To have no illegiti-
macy in Australia, and to
have 7000 men lost every
year while bravely rescuing
their drowning fellow-crea-
tures would be a magnifi-
cent advt. —far better than
the Transvaal contingent—for
the courage and morality of the
race. It might suggest that the
Australian is an awful navigator, but that can’t
be helped. Every great idea has its drawbacks.

At North Melb. Court the other week, a
26-year old parlormaid summoned the son of her
late employer on the same old paternity charge.
Complainant stated that in 1894 (when she was
21) defendant seduced her, and a child was born.
The “seducer” was 15 years old at the time,
nevertheless the Court made an order for ss. a-
week. Woman’s innocence must be protected !
Brisban e
WoR K K R re-
hashed an old
and somewhat
discredited as-
sertion in this
wise: “Marria-
ges always vary
with the price
of bread. When
food is cheap
marriages tend
to increase, etc.”
Consequently
the marriage and
birth rate rise
with the pros-
perity of a coun-
try. As a matter
of fact the Aus-
tralians at large
are a living dis-
proof of this
doctrine. The
United States
and our own pro-
vinces show a
lower birth-rate
than Europe,
although the
average Yank,
like the average
Australian, is
much better off
than the average
European. The
birth-rates of
Servia, Hungary
and Russia are
the highest in
the world ; yet
these three
nations are also
about the
poorest people
that Europe
possesses. “The
chronio condi-
tion of a large
section of the
Russian peasan-
try,” says Tols-
toi, “is starva-
tion.” “The
Russian cradle,”
says Stead, “is
never empty.”
Adam Smith
tells how it was
no uncommon
thing in his day
to find a gaunt
half-starved Heeland woman with a family of 12 or
13 children. Families of that kind are becoming
more and more scarce in Britain every year, and
yet Britain is, at present, a rather prosperous
country. France is, perhaps, the most well-to-do
country in Europe ; yet the French population
increases hardly at all.

Admiral Pearson apparently fears a Boer
invasion of Australia; if not, how explain this
official announcement re the warships visiting
Hobson’s Bay for the Cup : “ Visitors to the war-
ships, in view of hostilities in the Transvaal, are
now not allowed below the upper deck.” Surely
it was very dangerous for Admiral and officers to
leave the vessels and go to Flemington. Suppose
the Boers had attacked while the race was being
run !

Aii up-country parson sent a Bible to a
member of the Vic. contingent who hailed from
his district, telling him to carry it in the field, as
cases had been known of Bibles stopping bullets
and saving the lives of soldiers. The swaddy
took it down to Williamstown Rifle Ranges, stuck
it up against the target, and tried his new ’303
Enfield service rifle upon it at a pretty long range.
Next day he sent it back to Rev. Mr. Smuggins
with four neat round bullet-holes clean through it,
and a note saying that the paper was evidently of
inferior quality.

The bladders of bunkum have been swel-
ling and swelling over the despatch of Australian
troops to the Transvaal; and one of them has
burst with a loud report in Queensland. Major
Ricardo, the particular swashbuckler who leads
the Q. contingent to shoot down Boers for home
and country, ordered 100 tons of forage in Mel-
bourne—without Govt, authority, and apparently
because it seemed the proper swollen sort of thing
to do. The local Q. agriculturist howled that he
should have had the order ! and Premier Dickson
at first denied that there was any order. He was
wrong ; and trouble threatened till, at the
bunkum banquet to the departing officials,
Dickson announced that “ a patriotic Queens-
lander ” had given bis cheque for the foraae—
£7so; and the advertising drapers and others
very nearly burst with enthusiasm. Dickson
nearly burst too when the cheque was dishonored
two days later, and the Govt, sadly paid-up to
stop the scandal. Away from the champagne
“the patriotic Queenslander ” had decided to
hold on to his £750, and return his “vociferous
cheers.” A lovely incident—and so characteristic.

It would appear that many pauncheous
Australians of more or less prominence induced
their relatives to go to the war solely for the pur-
pose of getting themselves reproduced in the
illustrated papers in the same process-block with
the little cheap heroes. “Mr. Blank Dash, and
his son Reginald who is a member of the
contingent, and “Mr. Jabez Asterisk, J.P., and
his brother Augustus ; the latter goes to Africa to
fightfor Queen and Empire,” have been looming all
over the place in squalid etchings, and in every
instance Dash or Asterisk is blowing out his pout,
and filling the wall-space in the attitude of a fat
patriot shoring up a great nation at the peril of
his waistband. One Vic. nabob, who is devoting
several relations to the noble cause, adopts a tragio
Napoleonic attitude through a long series of
photographs, one glance at which should convince
the most timid that the Empire is quite safe.

Westralia’s Transvaal Contingent was a
motley affair, partly in uniform —about four
different varieties of uniform—and the rest in
ordinary slop suits and casual old hats. Half of
it consisted of absolutely raw recruits who hardly
knew enough to hit an enemy with the butt-end.
A uniform dress was devised at the last moment
and tailoring commenced in red-hot haste, while
frantic telegrams streamed through to Melbourne
for ornamental buttons. Melbourne had a splen-
did chance then to secure the union of all Aus-
tralia, and it threw the chance away. If it had
telegraphed that no buttons would be supplied
unless W.A. accepted the Commonwealth Bill,
W.A. would either have had to accept or else
send its troops to Africa with their pants held up
with a long nail.

“ Sarah Sop ” to The Bulletin :
Let me say that that Sydney daily’s account of the
“ singular display of patriotism ” at the final practice of
“Judas Maccabaeus” by Sydney Philharmonic Society
was absolutely false. There was not the faintest attempt
at spontaneous or any other cheering on the part of
either orchestra, chorus, or audience of favored friends.
In fact, there was not any but the usual enthusiasm, in-
spired by the fine singing of Newbury-Spada. Said daily
makes a Jingo-jackass of itself. I sang at all the prac-
tices, so I know. I might add that sundry beefy bassos
who were reckoning on a brilliant British victory at
Ladysmith, had arranged “to give it lip and lungs and
loyalty” in certain choruses, but then — vide cables—
something went wrong with the works.

Melb. Cup was the most ruthless leg-show
that has ever fallen to the lot of the shrinking
Antipodean. One cannot help noting in the
swagger girl of thiscontinent an abnormal craving
to display the lean or fatted calf, and when oppor-
tunity offers she publicly advertises her legs with
an effrontery that simply amazes the donah from
the tobacco-factory. The lawn on Cup Day was
a morass and mud was everywhere, and the Stand
dames and damsels took up their drapery with
both hands, and waddled around like ducks.
Judging by the vigor with which they took in
sail, most of the ladies imagined they were wading
knee-deep in the soup. Of several dames of title
and consequence Australia can now say it knows
exactly how they stand, and a bold photographer
who snapped one fashionable group has labelled
it: “ Calves in Pasture.”

Sydney Telegraph item :
Several clergymen at Albury have protested against
the holding of “Hospital Sunday,” on the ground that
it involves the desecration of the Sabbath.
It also interferes with the Church’s own Plate,
so the Church denounces the Hospital Plate as
Sabbath-breaking. But its own sordid mercenary
collection isn’t Sabbath-breaking. Evidently the
time has arrived for a new revelation and an up-
to-date Scripture. It is now a crime to be
charitable on Sunday. The Sabbath is not made
for man, and man is only made for the parson.

Concerning a vice-regal experiment :
W.A. Governor Jerry Smith, of hotel-financing fame,
about a year ago suggested that Westralian cyclist 3
should undertake a relay ride from Albany to Perth (254
miles), to carry a despatch announcing the supposed
capture of the Federal forts by an enemy’s cruiser. The
idea was taken up with such alacrity that within 12
months all arrangements were made, and the ride has just
been accomplished. The distance was divided amongst
28 cyclists, who arranged to carry the message through
in 15 hours. Gov. Smith waited for its arrival at 3.30 on
Saturday afternoon, but it never came, and H.E. retired
to bed with the message still undelivered. It came along
at 1.30 a.m., when the last cyclist, after ringing in vain at
the door-bell at Govt. House, reported himself at Perth
police station. The time taken was 25 hours, an hour
less than the record trip made by one of the ancient
coaches which used to do the journey in the olden time
before the railway days. The funniest pare of the pro-
ceedings was not announced fill some days after the
grand relay ride, when the original despatch,'announcing
the capture of Albany by an invading enemy, was picked
up by a settler about 100 miles from Albany, or two-fifths
of the way to Perth, and sent back by prosaic post to the
sender, the Govt. Resident, at Albany. The extreme
speed at which the cyclists travelled somehow made it
impossible to carry the despatch, which was dropped on
the road without anyone apparently noticing it. The
moral is that when Albany is captured it will be safer to
send the news through by stage coach. It is quicker than
the Westralian wire, and only one hour slower than
relays of cyclists, and it is more certain.

Dear Bulletin. —According to N.S.W.
Education Act a married teacher of (say) an Bth-
class school is entitled to .£l4B per annum, plus
£3O rent-allowance. If there is no vested resi-
dence, however, the teacher has to take any house
available, and is then only allowed the rent actu-
ally paid to the owner of what is frequently a
miserable structure. Thus the Department actu-
ally profits by the teacher’s discomfort. It says
he is entitled to a house worth £3O per annum,
yet it tells him to rent Blank’s house for £lO, and
scoops the £2O difference. Minister Perry has
in this matter a chance to show what stuff he’s
made of. He might see that if the married coun-
try teacher does not get his residence, he gets his
£3O. — Bark Hut.

“A Working-Man,” lamenting in Sydney
Daily Telegraph that the bakers’ picnic is to be

tain questions in order to say “No” with great
vehemence: “ Can it be said for a moment that
the master-bakers are too illiberal to concede a
week - day for such a purpose ? Perish the
thought!” Well, whether the thought “perished”
accordingly or not, the fact is still rampant that
the said noble-spirited bakers work their men 80
or 90 hours a week for from 255. to 40s.

At the recent Sydney licensing-courts,
the magistrates continued their) old game of re-
stricting the sale of Australian wine by
limiting: new licenses to restaurant-
keepers and grocers who sold by the
bottle. In one such case, an elo-
quent lady, evidently connected
with the W.C.T.U., offered oppo-
sition, and on learning that the
Bencli was favorable because appli-
cant was a grocer who sold by the
-bottle, she said that the court’s
arbitrary rule was a foolish one,
because wine never did so much
harm as when sent wholesale into
people’s homes. By the way, Crick,
M.L.A., in Opposition some time
ago, stated that he was determined
to use his Parliamentary position to
remove these restrictions on the sale
of native wines. And now he is in

Dear Bulletin. Although
the Melb. Board of Health is doing
much to purify food supplies, a
lot remains to be done. A
grazing friend of mine recently
sold 15 worn-out and diseased
bulls, for a few' shillings each,
on the strict understanding that
they were to be killed for their hide
and bones, but he found that an
attempt had been made to sell them
for butcher’s meat in Melbourne.
The B. of H. spoilt the little en-
terprise, but not till three of
the decayed beasts had been
sold to a suburban butcher for
nearly .£4 each. I once as-
sisted in the despatch of an
ancient boar w'ith a hide im-
pervious to bullets and spears.
He was duly cured, and sent
to Melb., giving a return of
r nearly £2. When I’m in town now,
I pass meat of any kind.—Y.
How is it that the bugle-call and drum-roll
have such a charm for the average draper ? In
Brisbane the drapers are warriors, in soul, to a
man. A leading Calico-Jemmy gave a banquet
to the departing soldiery, and the knights of the
yard-wand howled themselves hoarse with joy as
the Contingent marched down Queen-street. It
must he the clothes—the uniforms—that fill the
draper clan with unspeakable enthusiasm. For a
kindred reason they despise the Boers, many of
whom probably haven’t any uniform at all.

A 16-year girl-witness in a recent sly-grog-

never been to school, had never seen a clergyman,

“ Constance Clyde” decides to close early:
Sydney suburban shopkeepers are petitioning that,
when N.S.W. Early Closing Bill comes into force, their
shops be exempt from its provisions. They do not allege
that the suburban assistant is incapable of fatigue, or
even that he is more robust and enduring than his town
brother, and the reasons they do give for the course they
advocate are about as tired as the individual himself. The
proposal that certain shops should be exempt because
they are run by the proprietor’s own family seems un-
necessary, because there is no reason why a man should
be allowed to sweat his own son and daughter more than
anyone e'se’s. Also, quite unnecessary sympathy is
wasted on the working-man’s wife and her alleged* in-
ability to shop before six o’clock, owing to domestio
duties. There seems to be a vague impression among
legislators in general that the average working family
always has six babies, each under two years, whereas,
quite frequently, there is no infant at all. And as, when
she does possess a baby, the working-woman makes no
bones about taking it to theatres, or using it as a lever to
make her way through crowds on Labor-days, or Departure
of Contingent Days, or other glad occasions, there does not
seem much reason why she should not take it out shop-
ping as well. But the working woman is the working
woman’s worst enemy, and the allegation that she is
forced to it is mostly lie. Ac present shops are open to
10 and 11 p.m. on Saturday nights, and yet on Sunday
mornings, little Janie can be seen regularly trotting to
the back door of the little shop at the corner for the 3d.
worth of treacle and the packet of baking-powder that
were forgotten yesterday. If shops remained open to
3 a.m. there are people who would postpone their shop-
ping to 2.55 exactly, and raise a cry about the public
convenience when it was proposed to close up at 1 a.m.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, November 14, 1599.
Mr Dkar Mvek. —
Mr. Victor Cork ran is nnnr the most popular
member of Lord .Beauchamp’s staff, the suave
Captain Lindsay having departed, and Captain
Smith still continuing to swathe himself in sulky
looks. Mr. Corkran came in for a good deal of
blame at the time of the blue and white hops,
society declaring vaguely that he had brought
them out from Ireland, and that it was all his
fault these new-fangled ideas were foisted on
select folk like those who live at Potts Point. It
was said that he tried to egg his Ex. on to behave
like royalty, because he had been aide-de-camp to
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a gentleman who
is entitled to get into the carriage before his wife,
and because he didn’t realise that a mere colonial
Governor is not on a par with the Lord Lieu-
tenant of Ireland. However, as time went on it
was inevitable it should be seen that his Ex. was
not a young man to be led round by his private
secretary or by anybody else. Far more likely
that he looked up the doingsof that other bachelor
governor, Sir Alfred Milner, and tried to imitate
the manner of his brilliant social successes at the
Cape. Therefore society is carefully removing the
blame from Mr. Corkran’s shoulders,.and finding
out what a pleasant, remarkably unaffected and
kindly personality belongs to the man who conies
between little Billee and the bufferings of this
wicked world.
Looking up the etiquette at Dublin Castle func-
tions, I certainly found some similarity between
the Lord Lieutenant’s doings, and the explosive
acts of our Ex. Invitation cards are required to
be handed in, and there is such a thing observed
as a private entree. But other things are very
different. For instance, when a lady is being pre-
sented, the Lord Lieutenant salutes her with a
kiss. Surely, if Mr. Corkran was going to bring
anything at all out from Ireland, he never would
have been so cruel as to leave that behind.
I don’t know whether His Ex. is aware of it,
but the Alfred Milner bachelor regime owes most
of its brilliancy to the assistance of a lady,
Mrs. Hanbury-Williams, the charming wife of
Colonel Hanbury-Williams, Sir Milner’s secre-
tary. M.A.P. lately burst into loud admiration
of her clever effective way of running things. She
is described as a “petite, sweet, winning lady,”
and is said to have shown herself as genuine a
diplomat as the Governor in her way of helping to
govern the Cape. No lady ever had a more diffi-
cult task to perform, and no one ever succeeded
so brilliantly. Cape society was in a dislocated
mood. Section opposed section, and there was
always the old standing jealousy between the
British and the Dutch elements. But before Mrs.
Williams had been at the Cape a month she had
drawn to Government House the leaders of all
cliques, and had set a salon going that has kept
up even in the midst of wild political ferment.
This opens an easy, natural, and effective way
out of the difficult}' of a Govt.-Houseful of bache-
lor youths, and Society meandering about leader-
less, like chicks sans a hen. I wouldn’t suggest
for one moment that His Ex. should sacrifice him-
self on the altar of matrimony, but humbly
and deprecatingly I offer the hint that one of his
aides—the Hero of Khartoum, for instance, who
has never caught on violently with Sydney
society—should acquire a dashing wife who will
live at Govt. House, lead Society, act hostess
to V.R. functions, spread a feminine atmosphere
over things, and still leave us our bachelor boy-
Governor.
Not all Sydney was at the Cup last week, but
what wasn’t went into hiding so that it would
seem to be away. Although Society women
didn’t go over in great numbers this year some-
how, deterred probably by the necessity of staying
at home to weep over sons or husbands going war-
wards, nothing has been seen of Potts Point for the
last week or so. Mrs. Dicken, the fair-haired,
dollish-looking wife of a naval man, went from
here to be the guest of the Brasseys, and Mrs.
Alison, nee Burdekin, and her pretty Dresden-
china sister, the typical fair, fresh debutante, put
up with Janet, Lady Clarke. The Mayor and
Mayoress and lively Miss Harris stayed at
Menzies’. A local Jewish beauty who had all her
wardrobe ready for the festival gave tip the trip
owing to the illness of a relative.
From all accounts of the Cup gowning there
6eems to have been only one woman in Melbourne
this year, Janet, widow of the late William
Clarke, Bart. Every paper I take up expends at
least one-fourth of its descriptions on Lady
Clarke’s hats and gowns, her tea, her luncheon,
her dinner for the Governors and dance after-
wards, how she talked to Lord Beauchamp, her
photograph talking to Lord Brassey, her photo-
graph looking away from Lord Tennyson, and her
feneral equipments, which appear to have struck
lelbourne dumb as far as almost anyone else is
concerned.
The next most-talked-of Cup visitor was from
Sydney—the daughter of the king of the bookies,
Miss Oxenham—who debuted among us last year
and was considered very pretty, but seems to have
swarmed up into the front rank of Australian
beauty since her appearance at the Melbourne
Govt. House balls.
A little late in coming is the musical treat of
the year. This Thursday—Nov. 10—“ Little
Trebelli ” opens a short season at the Centenary
Hall, when the public will hear this finished,
fascinating warbler as often as nine times in one
evening—a generous contribution, if you like.
Trebelli leaves Australia next week, so I advise
everyone who cares to be wooed and caressed by a
sweet voice—for this is what Trebelli does —to
hasten to this last chance of hearing her.
A second visit to “Little Christopher Colum-
bus ” found crowds bustling into the Lyceum in a
way to delight a manager’s heart. For a long time
tlie Lyceum has been rather down on its luck,
but “Little Christopher ” looks like a popular
thing that the public won’t tire of in a hurry.
Celia Mavis, a local Hebress with a pretty voice,
looks well in the scarlet silk skirts of a Spanish
dancing-girl, with black lace, poppies in her hair,
but her legs are a little stiff for “a wave of the
sea. ”
Fred Sinclair, in the opinion of the local
theatre-goer, loses a good chance when he imitates
a newly-arrived Governor. The house holds its
breath when he goes out to get himself up like a
Gov., and everybody mentally sees a tall, thin
exotic, with an unfading smile, clean-shaven and
well, you know the picture. Then Sinclair
comes back, and great disappointment falls on the
house, for he wears a fair beard, and isn't an
imitation, or even a caricature, of any Governor
we know. It is an opportunity recklessly thrown
away by anybody whose legs are so conspicuously
vice-regal as O’Hooligan’s. The gallery-boy, who
has a wonderful flow of mixed metaphor, calls
them “sky-scrapers.”
How does a woman get into her frock ? That’s
always a puzzle to a man. But much more mysti-
fying to the feminine mind is the ciuestion : How
does a man get into skirts and underskirts?
There’s one black dress in “Little Christopher”
that might puzzle the most brilliant dressmaking
mind, and one looks with awe on the genial
Johnny, with his Hebrew phiz flirting round in a
lovely Parisian creation of black paillettes massed
on each other in bewildering numbers, and every
one sewn on by hand separately. The whole
is a mass of shimmering, scaly black, cut
a la Empire ; a black feather droops over each
shoulder, and the sleeves are composed of narrow
bands of paillettes, criss-crossed twice round the
arms as far as the elbow. It is lined all through
with black glace, and represents an amount of
handstitching that makes one’s back ache to
think of. Just imagine all that magnificence on a
man ! Perhaps you will be glad to learn that this
frock refuses to look as well on as off. In the
hand it is a dream, but on Sheridan the skirt
refuses to do that mysterious, indescribable thing
called setting.
A chat with Gracie Whiteford (Mrs. Johnny
Sheridan) and her husband, is rather confusing
behind the scenes, as the plump, pretty little lady
wears a shapely little navy blue coat and trousers
and gilt epaulettes, and the husband swirls round
in a frock of apricot plush, slashed up over white
satin covered with guipure, and a lovel}' creamy-
feathered hat, with masses of pale-pink roses on the
back of the hair. A boy-dresser helps Mr. Sheridan
off with this heavy garment and brings forward
the black paillettes. This is held low down on the
floor, and Sheridan, looking frightfully hot in a
pink flannel slip bodice and white petticoat, lifts
one daintily black-satined foot, and steps into the
neck of his gown. (Jnst as you suspected.) And
the frock is then rapidly run up his figure till he
can net his arms into those delicate sleeves that
look as if they had been thought of, but never
actually made. Once in it, the man completely
disappears, and a humorous Irishwoman'it is who
catches up diamond ornaments, and critically
sticks them all over her, fastening them in her
hair with that subtle familiar little pat. And it
is awfully like a woman who catches up a pair of
high-heeled pink satin shoes from a long row of
tan, and black, and pink, and white, arched and
rosetted and buckled shoes, and looks at them
tenderly, and remarks, “ I’m awfully light on my
feet; I’ve worn these fourteen months at the
Lyric, and now I’ve just had them re-covered
with pale-pink.” And still more feminine is he
who casts a slow, affectionate glance at a dream
of a violet hat, lined with lace, and trimmed with
lilac and green leaves, and one large pink rose at
the side. While he does this his wife adjusts her
trousers round the feet. A little, blaek-haired
edition of Sheridan tears in and out of the dress-
ing-room. He seems to be a smart boy, for
he finds no difficulty in recollecting that the
plump little man in blue trousers is Ma, and the
lady in the black ball-dress, with black tips in her
hair, is Pa.
I hear that the alleged latest engagement —that
of Miss Carrie Moore and Sydney Bracy—was a
mistake and a baseless rumor, after all. There
never was such a thing, and no evidence is before
the Court to suggest that there ever will be.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The climate on Cup Day, though really nice
for a duck or pig parade, was fatal to our annual
woman-show. Such a draggle-tailed spectacle has
seldom been seen since Noah & Co. huddled into
their house-boat. Nevertheless, the vice-regal
party looked most chirpy in their hierh-and-dry
Flemington crib, commanding, as it did, a wide
panorama of sodden humanity. All the guber-
natorial men wore biggish bouquets of red carna-
tions, save Beauchamp the Beautiful, in whose
button-hole one tender blue Canterbury bell ‘hung
its head as if to hide from view.’ This lone
blossom, unless emblematic of the See of Canter-
bury , and H.E. 's ecclesiastical leanings, was
chosen, like that becoming azure shirt, to match
the wearer’s blue eyes. Gov. Brassey looked a
little better than at the Derby, where the dowds
in their dowdiness seemed to hang heavily on his
hands. Fortunately a change came o’er the
Baronial brow on Cup Day, thanks to a haber-
dashery improvement in his vicinity, so marked as
to suggest a vice-regal sewing-bee on the eve of
the big race-meeting.
“ Lady Brassey’s black Cup-gown was a tame
affair in comparison with Janet Lady Clarke’s,
owing to the latter’s sensational mauve glass-
trimming. On all sides one heard the iridescent
balls dangling from said gorgeous gimp, likened
to Xmas-tree balloons, fairy lamps, &c. But
every,madness has its method if one can only find
it. My key to the gimp cryptogram in question,
interprets the crystal flowers as wonderland lilies,
lolling out their tongues, each tongue terminating
in a brobdingnagian purple carbuncle which
sounds rather like a description of the ‘beasts’
in Revelations.
“Mrs. Pearson, the dark-eyed wearer of a
brown Cup-suit, touched with orange, must have
been a brunette belle in her day. She and the
bearded Admiral looked a comfortable couple, who
kept themselves to themselves, and saw the races
with the length of the vice-regal box between
them and their hosts. Maybe ‘Precedence Pear-
son,’owning allegiance to none but the Governor
of the province, exclusive of visiting proconsuls,
regards himself fro tem. as Victoria’s vice-regal
understudy and as such maintains high state and
mentally conducts a levee of his own in his
especial corner of the gubernatorial enclosure.
Compared with the Naval Chief, Comman-
dant Holled - Smith comes off poorly. In
public he seldom basks in the vice-regal presence,
much less poses as part representative of Her Most
Gracious. On Cup Day, Lady Holled-Smith in
rainy-day blue, by no means looked her best—un-
like hubby, whose aspect in his brown cover-
all set women picturing a vision of delight 20
years younger than the massive militaire of
to-day.
“At the races Trebelli in unobtrusive black
looked a quiet little lady. In fact her costume
was as subdued as if its top layers were drying
in the cloak-room. The singer’s lady - friend
did the lawn with a black lace shawl over
her head, vice her ruined hat, while one of
our smartest sporting dames, judging by the short
plain slip, visible under her Newmarket, had dis-
carded her ornamental top petticoat along with
her dress-skirt.
“ But the chief sensation of Gov. Brassey’s Cup
Ball was caused, not by a lovely dress or a beauti-
ful woman, or by anything of the usual kind, but
by —a man’s moustache. A young German naval
officer was present in full uniform, and he had his
upper lip adorned with a genuine Kaiser Wilhelm
moustache. The ends of it were brushed up, fan-
fashion, bristling fiercely ‘like quills-upon the
fretful porcupine.’ The officer was a flaxen-
haired oval-faced youth, and may have been
amiable, but his mo. gave him a most threatening
appearance. Many women in the ballroom had
probably devoted much care to the doing of their
hair, but the ‘doing’ of the Hohenzollern
moustache must have been a work of real hard
labor.
“A Melbourne Cup visitor is the Earl of
Dunmore, an elderly Scotch peer born 58 years
ago, and now jogging round the world *on his
own.’ He is quite undistinguished, though he is
‘Lord Superior of the Isle of St. Kilda.’ •
“At the night before the Derby ball, Lord
Beauchamp showed a disposition to shrink far
away into his shell from the rude raw stare of the
multitudes. His knees nearly gave way in the
Australian Horse tights, as he faced the fierce
gaze of the ball-room battlers in the first set. His
first aide and staff were away from his side, and
the nervous young Governor nearly fell on his
nose twice during the ordeal. Admiral Pearson
romped through it, and Lady Tennyson came in a
good second. The poet’s first-born, and Mrs.
Pearson should be well shaken before taken. They
passed through the figures as if the dead birds of
Flemington were decomposing right under their
proud noses.
“ Only one Beauchamp story has gone the
rounds so far. By Wednesday’s Vice-Regal Ball
his Ex. had thawed a bit, and he actually said to
the wife of a lucky horse-owner, ‘I am so nervous,
you know —1 feel as if they were all looking and
talking about me.’ The popular matron meta-
phorically patted his august knuckles and assured
the young man that the Melb. people were
addicted to ruthless and open quizzing. ‘ Then all
Australians are the same,’ murmured his Ex.,
tugging at his cuffs.
“Perennial Wallington, swinging his body
slowly from side to side in the Vice-Regal party
processing into Govt. House ball-room, and setting
an example to the other nervous aides who were
getting along anyhow, reminded me for all
the world of poor Girard, the ‘ Belle of New
York ’ man. The seasoned tactician’s action and
every step seemed to be seriously saying—‘ Of
course—you can never be like us—but—be as like
us—as you’re able to be.’
“Gov. Beauchamp gossiped freely in Mel-
bourne about the blue and white ticket business.
‘Fact of the matter was, don’t you know,’ said he,
‘ when we got to Sydney there wasn’t a line to
guide us as to who people were. Lord Hampden’s
aides had either destroyed, or taken away with
them, their lists of people. We knew in a rough
way that some people—official folk and so on,
don’t you know- —were admitted before others, just
as my friend Lord Brassey tells us is done here
and elsewhere. But you see we didn’t know who
were the people who had a right to be admitted
first. So my aides had to guess, more or less, and
of course some offence was given. Very sorry
vou know, but Hampden’s people really ought to
have left us something as a guide.’ The young
man was glad to learn from Uncle Tom how the
tiling is managed in Melbourne. The plan there
is to give all guests cards of the same color, but
the privileged few have an extra card of entry.
“The Vic. Artists’ Society lately received a
donation of £25 from an ‘anonymous friend,’ who
is shrewdly suspected of being Lord Beauchamp.
In a commercial way of speaking the V.A.S.
doesn’t deserve any such cash patronage, for ib
once caught Gov. Brassey in a weak moment and
failed to take advantage of the phenomenal oppor-
tunity. Lord B. was the guest of the Society at a
picture show within a day or two of his landing in
Victoria. The old gentleman hadn’t yet settled
down to a due sense of vice-regal thriftiness, as it
were, and when the Society’s ‘burden of debt’ was
mentioned he offered—positively offered—to write
a cheque for the full amount of the burden. Did
the President and committee rush for a sheet of
paper and a pen ? No, they gratefully declined
the four-figured cheque on the ground that ib
would be nobler of them to clear off the debt by
their own exertions ; whereupon the Baron heaved
a sigh of relief and made up his mind never to risk
another refusal of the same nature.
“ Mayor McEacharn being a man of trade him-
self, thought he was complimenting Gov. Ranfurly,
when at the Mayoral banquet in Cup week he
said that his Ex., ‘ like most of those present, had
had experience in business. He believed he was
once connected with the salmon-fisheries.’ Now
you can't hurt an English aristocrat more than by
suggesting that he was connected with trade.
He’ll forgive you for saying that his grandmother
murdered her cook, or that his aunt died of drink,
but to sav that he is trady is an unpardonable
offence. Ranfurly put on a haughty look and
tossed his nose in the air. In his reply he assured
the audience that his only connection with salmon
had been in eating it, fishing for it, or paying
for it.
“At present Sydney girls are plentiful here-
abouts. Pale, slight, dainty Ruby Marks in
simple frocks is labelled ‘a typical Northerner.’
Inez Bensusan, bright-cheeked and dark-haired,
exhibits striking coiffures and smart blouses on
local platforms. Miss Oxenham in a thrilling pink
frock, danced no end, and ‘knocked ’em’generally
at the first vice-regal hop, also she gleamed
through the gloom of Cup Day in seasonable
scarlet.
“The late ‘Big’ Clarke’s widow left half her
family behind her in England, it seems. Eldest
daughter Mary is doing a round of visits, first to
Lady liopetoun, then to Lady Kintore, and other
‘good houses ; ’ after which she. will take a look
at Spain (the place where the onions and bull-
fights come from), prior to starting for her native
land in March next. Bonnie Mary, by the way,
appears to have been one of the admired presentees
at the Queen’s Drawing-Room. Reggie Clarke is
going into the army, and Russell and the other
boy are both at Oxford University. Vera, the
second daughter, who has grown very tall, re-
turned with her mother ; also a French governess
for the children was included in the party.
Whilst on the Clarke subject, I may as 'well cor-
rect the statement that Bart. Rupert went off to
South Africa the other week. His destination
was China, and he took his brother Ernest to bear
him company among the mandarins, which is
good news, considering the awfully Boerlike state
of the other country. Australia will be glad to
learn that, its only native baronet is in no danger
of having to lay down his life or his legs (like the
Duke of Devonshire’s nephew) for the honor and
glory of England.
“That very nice little musical woman, Mrs.
Doubleday, seems to be acquiring more kicks than
ha’pence from her ‘ discoveries.’ She had hardly
got over the ingratitude of the Castles’ damsel
(who couldn’t help losing her head under the boom
circumstances), when that native white-frocked
child, Lili Sharp, broke away from her discoverer
and announced her intention of making millions
‘on her own ’ in Westralia and other songful
regions. Fair Lili didn’t even condescend to
warble, at Mrs. Doubleday’s benefit concert, the
other week, although she undoubtedly owes her
name—whatever it may be worth —to the exertions
and influence of the popular widow, r kor when
Lili made her really first appearance at Melbourne
Town Hall her other name was St. Leonards, and
she didn’t get treble encores, or enthusiastic
notices in the press.

The rain which did so much to mar the
pleasure of “Cup day” was not altogether unkind.
It provided a gracious display of female outline
when lovely, but limp, dresses clung closely to
graceful forms. The most admired outlines were
those that denoted the presence of P.D. corsets,
and it speaks volumes for the popularity of the

What can be more uncomfortable in a house
than the continual messing about in the trimming of

Ail you have to do is to keep the well filled.*

tician, and is said to have done some very
good business lately. Burns also wrote a

Storyette of David Syme. One of his
dogs seeming hopelessly sick, the gardener
suggested that it be killed. “ No," said
David ; “ the matter requires consideration.
Don’t kill.him yet. I’ll think it over.” The
dog died that night; and next day the man
met Mr. Syme walking up and down in the
garden. He was about to inform him of the
tyke’s end, but the old man’s brow wore such
an air of deep thought—as though he were
girding up his loins to make history—that
the gardener was afraid to break in upon
his portentous meditations with anything
short of an earthquake to justify him. Sud-
denly David stopped in front of him and
spake : “ Ah, John, I’ve been considering
that matter of the dog. You may kill
him.”
David Syme made £9500 out of the sale

Within a few weeks they cut it up and retailed it
for .£138,700, and netted a profit of .£950 per
share after paying expenses. David Syme is

registrations were none two strict, and a man
could be almost any age he liked.

Old Dr. Lang’s
prophetic insight
was extraordin-
ary. He even
foresaw all the
wretched bungl-
ing over Sydney
municipal affairs,
and, over 40 years
ago, advocated
what will now al-
most certainly be-
come law, the
simultaneous elec-
tion of aldermen
by the citizens.
Another matter to
Lang’s credit was
his opposition to
Whitton’s propo-
sal to take Hyde
Park for a central railway station. In 1869
he advocated the taking of the present site of
the Victoria Markets for the station, and com-
munication with Redfern by tunnels. And now
it is likely the old man's bones will be dug up
because of the very necessity he anticipated 30
years ago !
Mr. John Leard writes to The Bulletin
from Merriwa :
It is printed that the grave of that well-known
explorer, Mr. John Roper, at Merriwa, is neglected. As
one of Mr. Roper’s executors, I beg to assure you that
such is not the case. The grave is well tended, and is
enclosed by a neat stone curbing. The foundation for a
memorial stone is in place, and the stone will be placed
there in due course. This, of course, is done by the late
Mr. Roper’s personal friends.
“ Davig ” : Apropos that story or the Vic.
officer who laid out his superior tor calling him a
liar (B. 28/10/99). Old Sir Harry Smith, who
gave the first Pretorius (grandfather of the one en-
gaged at Elands Laagte) an awful gruelling at
Boomplaats, when advancing against the Sikhs,
at Moodkee, came on a soldier of the both, who
had fallen out to take a stone out of his shoe. Said
the General —“What are you doing there, you
damned coward?’’ “You’re a damned iiar,”
promptly retorted the man, and tramped off to
join his regiment.
A story has long been current that Seddon
and Kingston can’t abide Reid because the latter,
who was the last of the Premiers to reach England
at Jubilee time, announced when interviewed on
behalf of the Imperial authorities immediately on
his arrival that he would not accept a knighthood.
He thus upset the apple-cart of the two other
un-titled men, whom his refusal debarred from
clutching the eagerly-proffered bauble—for J. Bull
loves to see all the beasts on his distant runs bear-
ing the brand of the head station. Apropos, Reid
was the only Australian Premier who went ’Ome
unaccompanied by his wife.
Queensland’s old friend, Pritchard Morgan,
is said to have got all those big Chinese mineral
concessions by reason of occupying “a high place
in the favor of the Dowager-Empress ” —her name,
by the way, is Tse-hi Twan-yui Kang-i Chang-yu
Ohwang-cheng Shai-kung Chin hein Chung-hi—
who has appointed him “ unofficial adviser in
mining to tne Court of Pekin, and administrator
of Szechuan.” Still the same old W.P.M., the
glances of whose bright, dark eye slew ’em all
like a Maxim gun. Black, white, yellow—wher-
ever he tarried, everything in petticoats had but
one god—and the name thereof was Morgan.
“O.T.”:Once asked a friend to have a
drink in the old Albion at Melbourne, but when I
came to plank the coin—hole in pocket! I was
looking foolish when in came Zox and another,
“ Aha ! ” said the genial one, “ have a drink ; I’ve
just picked up half-a-sov.” Then this scribe ex-
plained that half-a-sov. was the precise sum he
had lost. Exhibited hole in pocket, and suggested
that it was probable, to say the least, that the
coin belonged to him. Zox cocked one sceptical
eye on the writer and another on the chandelier,
as he said, “We’ll compromise, my son. I pay
for the drinks, lend you half-a-crown, and the
balance goes to the Prisoners’ Aid Society. May-
be you’ll get it back some day, when you need it
more.”
Charles Powers has just been appointed
Queensland Crown-Solicitor at a salary of .£BOO
per annum, may be viewed as the practical
wind-up of Powers the politician. Amiable,
ready, somewhat clever and somewhat facile,
Charles Powers turned out a splendid failure as a
Parliamentarian, owing’ principally to a spongy
deterioration of the vertebrae. It was really the
black-labor question that killed him. One election
saw him posing as the champion of “ Queensland
for the White Man”; another beheld him plead-
ing the cause of kanaka labor and the sugar-kings
with a view to ousting Glassey. The present
appointment is probably a reward for the last
mentioned piece of tergiversation. Indepen-
dently of politics, Powers is somewhat popular
and held in considerable esteem.
Judge Coli'ey, who was stricken with fatal
paralysis while holding court at Moree lately,
did his best work perhaps as Crown-Prosecutor ;
and, from the Crown point of view, his best in
that capacity was in connection with the Broken
Hill strike conspiracy case. He had the advant-
age there, though, of working up the case even
for the police court, doing the work which the
police and the Crown Law office generally do.
Pitted against J. H. Want when the venue was
changed to Heniliquin, Coffey at once adopted
towards the jury of slow-moving “cookies” the
attitude of a benevolent middle-aged party who
really couldn’t do anybody an injury. So while
for the defence there was a fierce denunciation of
the police, and especially of the detectives and
the mines’ “agents,” for the Crown there was
merely this benevolent gentleman talking in a
most confidential way to the jury, and all the
time rubbing it into the accused, though in sorrow
and not in anger. And the jury of rustics, who
never did understand what it was all about (didn’t
they find one of the accused guilty of conspiring
with himself until the Judge directed them to go
back and think over it?) took Mr. Coffey’s
word for it—and the rest was left to the Judge.

Almost every 25-year-old blind horse in
Australia was offered to the military authorities
as a mount for the Australian soldiers in the
Transvaal. People who had horses to sell ap-
peared quite unable to take the contingent seri-
ously. A strange, homeless-looking procession
of the halt, the lame, the blind, the patriarch,
the skeleton, the cat’s-meat, and the roarer, kept
making towards military head-quarters, and had
to be eternally shooed away from the front gate.
Every owner was of the same opinion—the
animal might not look much, but
he was good enough for the
Boers to shoot at. And quite a
number of owners had a fixed
conviction that if they could get
at someone in authority and offer
him 25 per cent, commission,
the deal would come off. The
ineradicable impression in horse
circles was that the whole affair
was a scheme organised for the
purpose of getting rid of worn-
out horses to the Government,
and there was a constant gravi-
tation to the baok of the pre-
mises in the hope that some
person who looked like the
person who was working the
scheme might be visible over
the fence and might be nego-
tiated with surreptitiously.
There was no shred of faith or
patriotism in horse circles.
When the owners were assured
that the country wanted to send
only the best men and horses
on this errand —the kind that
would do it credit —they merely
inferred that the man who gob up the swindle
had old nags of his own to trade off and
didn’t want theirs. So they led their crocks away
again, disgusted, but with no faith in the patriot-
ism of anybody.

The Queensland Contingent is taking to
the Transvaal a pure-bred dingo—as regimental
pet. The dingo is undoubtedly Australian enough,
bub his characteristics are not precisely of the
heroic sort. Dingo-valor, however, is probably
the high-water mark of the daring of warriors
who go to assist the big and numerous Bull to
thrash the little Boer republic.

“E.Z. ” : Another Spartan. B
was a S.Q. boundary-rider. While out on the
run his horse slipped and fell, and B.’s thigh was
fractured. When he came to, the horse was
grazing a chain or so away, and B. started to
crawl to the neddy, but failed to catch him. Then
with his knife he cut down two saplings, using
the forks thereof as the arm-rests of crutches.
With these he dragged himself five miles to a
coach-road, where he was picked up by a German
hawker near sundown. Carted to the station, he
was next day taken to the railway and sent over
100 miles by train to a hospital. He entirely
recovered and lived to become a deadly bore with
the story of his sufferings.

“ W.G.W.” : Instancing the kangaroo’s
low intelligence, Bartlett (late Super, of London
Zoo) says in “Wild Animals in Captivity ” :
If several females live together, the young one on
leaving the pouch of its mother will take possession of
the pouch of another female. Thus the young ones
change about, the mothers either being unable to dis-
tinguish or being quite indifferent to the rearing of their
respective offspring.
Contrast this with the fact that the allegedly
stupid sheep-mother can identify her own progeny
amongst hundreds, and will never suckle a strange
lamb.

“ Malle ” : Some men’s liquid capacity is
marvellous. I once knew a German navvy who
oould swill off a three-quart billy of milk in one
go. Same gentleman had a weakness for pork.
Early one morning a man heard a shot, and
going to see what was up, found the Deutsoher,
gun in hand, regarding a deceased porker with
much satisfaction. What do you mean by shoot-
ing Brown’s pigs, was asked ; to which the Teuton
unblushingly replied—“l shood heem, pegause if
I hadent hat mine long poots on, der tyvil vould
hef shewed me der leg off ! ” Which is full-brother
to the venerable biting-sheep yarn.
“C.M.Gr.” : How is this for absence of
mind ? Bill and Jim (nob the original) were en-
gaged in pile-getting a few miles out fromNagam-
bie, Yic. By an unfortunate oversight Bill’s
“stick ” fell on Jim one day, pinning him to the
ground in a broken and contrite condition. Bill
at once lost his head, and made a rush for Coy’s
Diggings, seeking assistance, leaving his mate
under the log. Before reaching Coy’s, William
utterly forgot what he was running for, and pre-
sently slowed to his habitual walk. When he
reached home he had tea as usual, and he only re-
called the accident an hour later when he strolled
over to Jim’s hut to borrow tobacco, and found
that Jim was not in.
A MAN MISSING.

2ND DITTO : “ Wot man? ”
1ST H. : “ The cove as cuts a track for ’im when ’e

“Shaker”: Courage is indeed a curious
commodity. Have known a V.C. man walk 10
miles rather than back a usually quiet horse after
a spell; also have seen a man, who had previously
gone down a 30ft. shaft with two live shots in the
bottom, extinguished the fuses, and brought up
his injured mate, fairly paralysed with terror
when a bullock feinted at him in a cattle-yard.

“ A.E.G.” : Re the police pistoleer, I saw
a trooper at Clyde River, N.S.W., take four
shots with his revolver at “nobody’s” dog
five paces off. He missed every time, and
was obliged to settle
the animal with a stick.
He blamed the weap-
on. Consider the risk
of entrusting a pistol
to a man who can’t
even go near hitting
what he fires at.
Writer would just as
soon bo the “wanted”
one as the casual man-
in-the-street when the
average trap is on the
shoot. Of course whab
happened in the case
above related was that
every bullet went over
the dog. A heavy revolver
at that range would “throw-up” per-
haps as much as 12 inches.
“F.E.A.” : Re “C.H.W.’s”
“following” orows (B. 26/8/’99).
When I used to be duck-shooting
round the waterholes and swamps at
Merriman’s Creek, Gippsland, a
sparrow-hawk followed me about —at
first at a respectful distance,but after-
wards—finding I did not molest him—
within easy gun-shot. Found him very
useful in making the ducks “sib’’till
I gob within range. If a duck was
only so much wounded as to fly with
difficulty my “mate’’would Have it
to a certainty, and I never grudged
him his bird as he earned it 10 times
over. Suddenly he failed to turn up.
I suspect he followed some other
shootisb who did nob know his value
and “ pilled ” him.

Utilising misfortune! A N.S. W.

“ Groper ” : Have never seen any printed
reference to the curious faob thab half-a-minute’s
exposure to the sun is fatal to the bull-ant. I
have won bets on the event. The red ants ap-
pear to stand heat better. By-the-way, I have
seen a bull-ant’s nest besieged by thousands of
little black ants. When this happens, any bully
thab ventures forth is promptly grabbed by the
ends of his legs and dragged oub flat, so thab he
can’t get either his fore or after weapons to bear.
Then he is calmly assassinated by another con-
tingent.
“Ben Sun”: The
designation “ Bungaree
savages,” invented by
the caustic C. E. Jones,
used to be fairly well jus-
tified. Trifles, such as
striking a man on the
head with a bottle, were
locally considered merely
amusing, and nearly
every male Bungaree-er
was minus an eye or an
ear, or a finger or two.
Every “Pat’s” day a
band used to go there
from Ballarat, and the
crowd that came back
with it was mixed and
memorable. Dashing
horses hauling “ traps ”
that promised to break
up in every rut; candi-
dates for the bonemill
dragging new “ turn-
outs,” and often yoked
thereto by straw-ropes ;
men and women stagger-
ing along to keep up with
the band, and only en-
abled to do so by the
frequency of the pubs
along the way. Alto-
gether, the mixture of
band and brogue, and
liquor and laughter, and
dust and curses, was
good enough for any saint
in the calendar, and it
was mostly a week before
the male part of the crowd
got home, having been
fined from five to forty
shillings in the interval.
But those bright days are
no more. Physically,
Bungaree has still the
best men and brightest women in Victoria, but,
alas! it is now sinfully respectable and “right-
thinking.”

“ Alpar ” : An old lady in Illawarra dis-

the rats were the thieves. They’d skim the dishes
with their tails, and roll the cream along the earth
floor into their holes. Subsequently they were

were found stored away. I have myself frequently
seen rats gather cream up on their tails, and retire
to a safe place to lick them. In another case a pig-
butcher had gob in a couple of tons of coarse salt,
which he left Stored away for months. When
he went to get some, he found columns of salt
standing, but not a vestige of the bags, which the
rats had taken to make nests with.

In the good old “ early days ” the
“ assigned servant ” of a farmer of The Penin-
sula, near Windsor, N.S.W., having been flogged
for absence without leave, was heard to say that
there would be a “ big blaze over the affair before
long.” Shortly afterwards a haystack belong-
ing to his master was burnt. The servant was
tried for arson, convicted principally upon what
he had said himself, and duly hanged. He pro-
tested his innocence to the last, and made a vio-
lent struggle on the scaffold. Many years later
the farmer’s wife made a death-bed confession
that it was she who had (accidentally) ignited the
haystack with a candle while looking for a nest-
ing-hen, and had been afraid to tell the truth
about it.

“Won Hie”: Re speed of snakes
(“Hooka,” B. 7/10/’99). When a lad, I came,
one day in the bush, on a big brown snake, and
went at him with a stick. He made off with
aboub 3yds. start, and, after a 200yds. sprint over
very fair ground, reached his hole 10yds. in front
of me, although I was a better runner than
common, A snake does not spring off the ground,
nor does he spring backwards off his tail. He is,
nevertheless, more dangerous behind than in
front, on account of the nasty way he has of
doubling back along the ground with head slightly
raised.

“Via ” : Re snakes jumping (8., l/10/’99),
Dr. Zandler, ophidian expert of London Zoo.,
asserts in Chambers’Journal that it is physically
impossible for any snake to spring. Zandler has
had 25 years’ experience of snakes, and has
handled scores of thousands; nevertheless, I have
myself seen a N.Q. tiger-snake make a clear dart
of feet into the air ; and in Nova Scotia the genial
“ rattler ” forms himself into a hoop and trundles
like a cycle. Seeing ought to be believing.

“Bos.”: Some queer bush notions. I
know a wife who considered it was no use putting

who, when he wanted to grow corn, jabbed holes
in the ground with a crowbar, and dropped in the
corn ! Couldn’t make oub why it never came up ;
said the ground must be too poor.

“Betti”: Re “Waifs” query (B.

sheep are sometimes thus killed. I have seen
nine found dead together. As for the eaglehavvk,
he is not abroad at night when nearly all these
killings take place.

THE SMALL BOY’S PRAYER.
He was a small Australian boy,
His Christian name was Ted,
And to his gentle mother’s joy
He knelt down by his bed.
’Twas not the usual command
Reluctantly obeyed—
He knelt alone, and raised his hand,
And silently he prayed.
His mother’s eyelash dropped a tear,
She smoothed his curly head.
“'What was it that jou prayed tor, dear?”
The pious mother said,
“ For Tommy Ryan's bat,” he cried,
“ He bought it new to-day,
I couldn’t pinch it, though I tried,
’An so I thought I’d pray.”

Thu latest addition to the long list of un-
discovered crimes in Queensland—the murder of
Sydney Pearce, a young carrier at Winton, W.Q.
has once more given the heavy Bananaland
policeman room for a display of the effective
methods used in allowing criminals to escape.
After exhausting all the stock lines of prancing
aimlessly round, walking enthusiastically over what
tracks there were about the scene of the murder,
and shadowing 803 suspicious persons, the foorce
launched out on an entirely original track. From
Townsville it sent out one of its smartest men in
the guise of a swagsman. The style in which he
humped his bluey gave him clean away, and his
slouch hat and goggles were a danger-signal visible
a mile off. This worthy unit of a worthy whole
followed out the plan he had began so well by
riding into Winton on a cattle-train in the middle
of the day, and his burlesque was such an im-
mediate success that he was promptly run in by
the local cop on suspicion of being concerned in
the murder. A scornful grin awaited his tale of
being a D., but it cost about .£lO in identificatory
telegrams before he was released. Result, the
criminals “ still at large ’’—good old phrase. The
Police Commission now sitting does not think it
necessary to go further north than Brisbane.

A big co.
has started op-
erations in
New York re-
tailing liquid
air for domes-
tic purposes.
The co.’s cir-
cular points
out that liquid
air has all the
advantages of
ice without the
disadvan-
tages. Also, it
has some ad-
vantages that
ice has not.
The co. sup-
plies the stuff
in felt-covered
and lined
cases,
from a
quart
up to
several
gallons.
It can be kept
for 24 hours
without the
slightest risk.
It can be used
to keep provi-
sion-safes cool,
and as it eva-
porates it
merely turns in-
to dry cold air.
Water cooled by
having a little liquid
air mixed with it is
not only iced but steri-
lized. It lias been
found that it makes
excellent ice - cream.
Sprayed over cordials
and wines in the bottle
it acts at once, and
beats ice right out of
the field. It can be
sprayed all over the
room and furniture,
and cools the air,
charges it with oxy-
gen, kills microbes,
and does not harm
the furniture, or pictures, or ornaments, Ihe ice
companies of New York regard the new competi-
tor with more than dislike.
Now that N.S. W. police have been
ordered to collect the dog tax for current year it
is well the public and country Benches shoul
know that the Central Police Court Bench, Syd-
ney, has ruled that feeding an unregistered dog
renders the feeder liable to be summoned tor tne
dog tax.
The N.S. W. public servant, after long and
weary waiting, does get a rise of salary now and
then. His easeisn’t quite hopeless. For instance,
in a recent Government Gazette the Public
Service Board dashes money about in this awtully
reckless fashion : Sarah McLure, postmistress and
telegraph operator, increased from .£O5 a yeai te
,£66 a year ; F. Knowles, from £lO4 to .£lO5 ; <)
Howell, from £lO4 to £lO5 ; R. Matthews, from
£lO4 to £lO5. The Bulletin devoutly hopes
these people will put their sudden wealth to a
good use.

been trying the very thing—he was singing My
God, my Father, while I stray” on his head when

Melbourne University Senate, after much
debate on the question of empowering the Council
to dismiss “improper” professors at a moment’s

dox views—religious, political, scientific, or philo-
sophical—will not rank as “ improper ” conduct.
Which really means that, if the new rule had
been passed previous to the publication of Mar-
shall Hall’s book of “ Hymns,” and the utterance
of sundry wild speeches wherewith he shocked the
unco guid at about the time of the “ Hymns ”
outcry in the Argus, it would have made no dif-
ference to the musical professor. The new rule
leaves him at liberty to be the same Marshall Hall
as before. So that’s all right.
The BOTTLE "Oh"
Man
FOR THE BULLETIN.
T AIN’T the kind of bloke as takes to any
steady job—
I drives a bottle-cart around the town.
A man what keeps his eye about need ne/oer want a
bob—
I couldn’t bear to'.work for\every brown.
There’s lots of ’andy things about in everybody’s
yard,
There’s cocks and 'ens a-running to and fro,
And little dongs what comes and barks—we takes ’em
off their guard;
And we puts ’em with the Empty Bottle, Oh!
So it’s “ Any empty bottles, any empty bottles,
oh! ”
You can hear us shout for half a mile or so ;
You can see the women rushing
To take in the Monday’s washing
When, they hear the cry of “ Empty Bottle, Oh! ’
I’m driving down by Wexford-street, and up a win
dow goes—
A girl pulxinut ’er ’ead and looks at me,
An allright tart with ginger hair and freckles on ’er
nose—
I stops the cart and walks across to see.
“ There ain’t no bottles ’ere," says she, “ since father
took the pledge.”
“No bottles 'ere ‘l" says I. “ I’d like to know
Wot right you ’ave to stick your ’ead outside the win-
der-ledge,
If you ’aren’t got no Empty Bottle, Oh! ”
I sometimes gives the ’orse a spell, and then the push
and me
We takes a little trip to Chowder Bay;
Oh, ain’t it nice the ’ole day long a-gazing at the sea
And a-hiding of the tanglefoot away!
But when the booze gets 'old of us and fellers starts
to “ scrap,’’
There's some what likes blue-metal for to throw!
Bui as for me, I alivays says, foi laying-out a trap,
Oh, there’s nothing like an Empty Bottle, Oh!

Jack Shay : Can’t let your dream be dreamt in
this paper Boxer: Didn’t he? Old 28th : But what
about the 1500 Boers that were blown up with Lyddite?
Cable tells no more concerning them. Was it a fish-
story? Mac Murder : What concern should Australia
have with the hideous old religious feuds of Ireland? Let
Australians cherish the welfare and independence of their
own country, and see that their politicians look for
reward to the Australian citizen and not to the British
aristocracy and glorified shopkeepers far over the sea
Nutzon : Your poem herewith :
Said the man with the pen, “ I dare not go-
lfs very much safer to skite and blow,
As I’ve got to write an article hot
Fit for a paper, full of rot,
So I never have time to go and bleed
For the Empire’s wrongs I never heed
‘ It’s only a picnic ’ so I say
And the simple reason I stop away
It’s easier far to stay and write
Than go to a distant land to fight
I’m ‘ making history.’ What do you say ?
And getting moreover my weekly pay.”
“ Our history’s made by writing slush .
And filling the weeklies full of mush ;
Let other fools do what brave men dare—
I sit and write in my easy chair.
Let true men go, where cowards fail.
But I’ll write and smoke and drink my ale;
So I’ll sit and write and the country sway,
For I care for nought if I get my pay.
And yet you didn’t go yourself. The Bulletin’s “ Man
with the Hoe ” held that the whole Contingent business
was wrong, and therefore he didn’t go. You say it is
right, so presumably you don’t go through sheer
cowardice. By your own showing you are not a “ true
man,” and you are one of the “ cowards who fail.”
A. Wrex : Rather wrecky.. F.J.K. : According to Cogh-
lan’B “Statistics of the Seven Colonies” for 1898, the
figures at end of 1898 were : Melbourne and suburbs,
469,680 ; Sydney and suburbs, 426,950. Haven’t got the
other information on premises ... S.A.R. (Coolgardie):
One great object of the charge instituted by the banks
on each account was to extinguish the small forgotten
balances that are such a trouble to every bank. When a
bank has looked after 9s. Bd. long enough it deserves
10s. 6d. for doing it Fair Play: Transvaal revenue in
1896 (when it reached about the top figure) was £5 10s.
per inhabitant, or £l9 12s. per white inhabitant. Wes-
tralian revenue, same year, £l9 17s. sd. per inhabitant,
or about £2l per white inhabitant. Natal (British colony
alongside Transvaal), £2 14s. per inhabitant, or £29 per
white inhabitant ; Queensland revenue is now about
£8 7s. 6d. per inhabitant ; N.S.W., £7 4s. lid.
There is nothing very unusual about the Transvaal
revenue. Never heard about the other allegations

B.S. : Kipling was in Australia at the time of the Melb.
Cup of 1892, and remained some months altogether.
Patterson assumed office at the beginning of ’93 o’B. :
There were plenty of precedents. N.S.YV. Chief-Justices
Forbes, Martin and Salomons were appointed to the seat
direct, without preliminary apprenticeship as puisne
Judges, though Dowling and Alfred Stephen were raised
from assistant or puisne to the rank of Chief .... Henry
Inee Farrell : You are two oracular, for, as has been here
shown, the statement in question did, after all, appear in
the Encycloposdia Brit' Lois B. : All very well, but why
should anyone be haled before court for “contempt” in
using “ insulting observations” to certain jurymen with
respect to their verdict, while you so often hear insulting
observations' from the bench about a jury’s verdict?
Judge Docker, for instance, has insulted no end of juries.
. . Michl. O’A. : All your argument is based on the
statement that the Transvaal declined to arbitrate,
whereas it was Britain that declined arbitration which
was proposed by the Boers . Alip Arslan : You say, in
effect, that the Australian militaire doesn’t care a rag
whether the Transvaal war is right or wrong as long as
he gets change and excitement: —
Sweetbriar : Too late. Should have been sent last week.
A Constant Reader (Melb.) : M.S. too difficult
Alvermarle : Don’t understand your question ... Some-
times Sane : “ Maddv ”is bright and smart; you are dull
and elephantine \V. Curtis : Too domestic a story
Scall.v : Too diffuse Simple Simon : Thanks ... Alsa :
(1) : She can’t demand return fare unless specified in the
agreement. Does she know exactly what was in the
agreement. (2) Her mistress can dismiss her if she
doesn’t obey orders. There is very little satisfaction to
be had anyway. F.W.O. : Will print “D.” F.F..’
You mustn’t set down Rosebery as a softy. As a matter
of fact, he is the only British nobleman of brilliant reputs
who ever maintained in Australia the fame which had
preceded him. This country never heard such after-
dinner speeches, since or before. Rackarock : Quits
right, but we don’t want to “rub it in.” The thing i*
past, and there are other aspects to tackle in earnest
Bo : Too much primal melancholy A.T.0.: Worthless,
W.L.B. : No value A.R. : We have read worse

usuahle David G. : Possibly one Hochkirch :
Villainous Potts : Not enough force or reality
Nullah : Merely amounts to statement that a decompos-

Sir Rah : Now, when did you ever see Sunday-school

Can’t give name of “ the best doctor,” but, if you will send

specialists to choose from E.W.S. : There is no such
law either in Victoria or Tasmania, but, in S.A., a woman
who alleges that she is to become a mother at some future
date of an illegitimate child can get the father
bound over to pay all contingent exes. There have been
several cases in which this law has been invoked G. M. :

ish ; those w’ith large intellects and small hearts who
dexterously turn the organisation to business profit; and
those with small intellects and small hearts who want

“ The term ‘ filthy lucre,’ by which money
is often called, originated in Scotland,” says a
Sydney Sunday paper, “ and referred to the well-
worn ill-notes of that country.” Now, as a matter
of fact, the term “filthy lucre” comes from the
Bible, and may be found in the First Epistle to
Timothy.
Some phe-

We scoff at the ancient heathen who worshipped the
silver stars;
While we turn from our Christian teachers and bow to
the war-god Mars;
With one hand outstretched to the broadsword, and one
to the stranger’s door,
With a cry for peace to Our Father, and one for the
stranger’s gore.
Our hands have grown tired of labor, long day after day
the same,
Our languid pulses have weakened, and our hearts are
yearning for “ fame.”
The food that the spirit craves for —just “something
different ” to do ;
Our souls have forgotten our bodies, we hunger for some-
thing new.
We scoff at the ancient heathen who worshipped the
silver stars.
While we turn from Christian teachers, and bow to the
war-god Mars.


Now that N.S.W. police have been ordered to collect the
dog-tax for current year it is well the public and country
I Benches should know that the Central Police Court Bench,
Sydney, has ruled that feeding an unregistered dog renders
[.the feeder liable to be summoned for the dog-tax.
Domain Dweller (to stray dog): “ Alars ! poor tyke, I
dussent do it. If I shared this ere bone with yer I should
be committin’ a felony under the Act.”
“ Mr. Copeland, in the Leg. Assembly, read a letter received
from the relatives of pne of the contingent leaving by the
Langton Grange, complaining that each man would have 12
horses to look after, which was considered too much, and was
also quite a different kind of
service from what was volun-
' teered for.
“ Mr. Lyne said that it
was the first time he had
"heard of the men being em-
ployed in looking after the
horses by the Langton
Grange that belonged to
the Imperial Government.
He, did not think it was
the correct thing for the
men to be employed in I
attending to horses
for the Imperial Go-
vernment, and it
should not be
allowed.”
Chorus of Imperial Mokes : “ Steward 1 ”
Is Heaven a Place?” asks a Sydney religious
paper. Mr. Isaac Kueh, bookmaker, says it is not, within
the meaning of the Act.
The O’Sullivan has hit upon a characteristic idea for
beautifying Pinchgut. He says: “We might retain the
tower as a relic of the early days, but the other portion
of the islet should be utilised as the site for a statue of
‘ Australia Facing the Dawn.’ It would be an imposing
object by day, and at night it might be lighted by elec-
tricity, and thus serve as a beacon.” Our artist submits
a design—only he would call it “ Australia Facing the
<Music.”
Australian Parent : “ Yes, my

Child : “ What was iW-drink ? ”
Parent “A kindred disease;

fever, went to the Transvaal, fell
down » rifle-pit or something, and

Police Magistrate ; “ Look here, why
have you brought that cow into court 1 ”
Officer : “ Well, sor, the daler satis-
fled me Mat he sold the milk just as he got it, an’ I have shated home the
guilt where it belongs ! ”
Here you see an electrical
person connected with the Govt,
trying to explain why the

" The British prisoners taken by the Boers have been sent to Pre-
toria, where they are being well treated. They amuse themselves by
playing football.” ■ „
Old Resident : “ Do you see
.that man coming along with a
crooked leg and no lower jaw ?
well, he’s a Transvaal veteran.”
V isitor : “ How interesting !
Ancl his injuries were received, I
kuppose, in fighting for the dear old flag?”
O. R.: “ Not exactly ;he got them playing football while a
prisoner ! ”

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have along thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a

has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

The Editor endorses the Mayor’s
Statement.
Glen Innes Guardian says: “The Mayor
AND His Cure -- Elsewhere Messrs. Warner and
Co. publish a testimonial for their ‘Safe Cure’
sent them »y Mayor Healey. Mr. Healey swears-
by this well known remedy, and we feel sure that
his experience will lead others to try a medicine
whose good qualities are already known to so
many in Glen Innes. Mrs. Healey is not the first,
by any means, in Glen Innes, who has benefited
by this excellent preparation.”
THE MAYOR’S STATEMENT.
Glen Innes, N.S.W., Oct. 11, ’9B.
H. H. Warner and Co., Ltd. Melbourne.
Gentlemen,—l have often thought it my duty
for the sake of others to write you. It will be five
years next month since my wife was given up by
two doctors as a patient w'ho could not live the
night through.
She had been treated for heart complaint; but
we afterwards found that it was kidney disease.
On Sunday when the doctors told me she would
not live another day—the dropsical swelling had
then extended from her legs into the body—a
friend said tome: “Try Warner’s Safe Cure.” At
half-past ten that night I procured a bottle and :
gave her one dose, then in about an hour another.
She said soon after, “Jim, I feel a little easier.”'
I continued with Warner’s Safe Cure, giving up.
the doctor’s medicine, and to-day she is a living
monument to its efficacy. The doctors and every-
one who knew her were astonished.
I have recommended this medicine scores of
times since, and we always keep it in the house.
If my liver is sluggish I take it as a tonic and
invigorator.
After five years I consider the trial a fair one,,
and that it is consistent to call my wife’s cure
permanent. I am well known in Glen Innes,.
having lived here sixteen years, been fourteen
years Alderman, and twice elected Mayor of the
municipality, and I am not afraid to sign my
name as a guarantee that Warner’s Safe Cur* is
what it is represented to be.—Yours faithfilly,
James Healey, Mayor.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Motto for the Australian Commonwealth :
“ Take away that bauble ! ”
To be discussed at the first Federal elec-
tion—Loyalty to England, Treachery to Australia.
S.A. National Association recently pre-
sented a petition to Parliament against household
suffrage “signed” by 10,000 electors. Investiga-
tion disclosed the fact that hundreds of the alleged
signatures were in the same handwriting !
Premier Dickson still hopes to prove one
too many for his enemies. He is introducing a
Bill for the formation of a Public Works Com-
mittee on N.S.W. lines. The members will, of
course, be drawn from the ranks of the waverers.
S. A. Tories are again utterly disorganised.
In the Assembly, Solomon has been a failure as
Opposition leader, with the result that some, of
his colleagues are working hard to depose him.
Glynn and Griffiths have practically seceded from
the party.
According tb the cable the French papers
got in a gibe over the British troubles in the
Transvaal. Thus:
England denies that, she forced war on the Boers. It
must be quite true : witness her unpreparedness.
Several “ great ” Australian dailies actually ac-
cepted the cable seriously and wrote it up as a
French compliment to England’s peace-loving pro-
clivities ! !!
Australia, it is decreed by the local title-
brigade and Imperialistic military clique, is to
have no independent national existence. When
the guns of London Stock Exchange began to
boom in battle, then, without question as to the
why or wherefore, Australia’s cannon must boom
responsively. Australia must never be permitted
to be a Nation. She must figure merely as a
wart on the nose of Rothschild, Rhodes, Beit,
and co.
“ Dismal Bill ” Rollestdn is of opinion
that Maoriland should be slow to join the Com-
monwealth and “surrender its self-governing
powers.” And the Dismal One is a prominent
member of the Tory party which proposes to
charm the deaf adder of popular approval at the
coming election with the promise to “submit the
Bill to the people.” Pity that party isn’t a. little
more definite as to what it intends doing with the
Bill if the people accept it.
Apparently the proposal to send another
contingent to South Africa, mooted in a moment
of irresponsible refreshment, when this country’s
hat was tottering on its ear and its tie had got
into its mouth, and it had no troubles save a hazy
fear that it had left the keyhole at home on top
of the piano, has been quietly dropped. Some of
the provinces had enough woe in scraping up the
contingents they have sent already. Besides, it’s
no use making a toil of a pleasure.
Cabled that the Transvaal has during the
last two years imported 150,000 rifles and 300
cannon—which, says the stock-exchange press,
clearly shows that the Boers weren’t a peaceful
and guileless people upon whom a Great Power,
acting as the tool of capitalists, forced a carefully-
prepared war. When a man finds burglars prowl-
ing about his premises, he buys a pistol. When
the Transvaal found herself invaded by brigand
Jamieson, she, knowing his masters and their
motives, bought guns.
Dr. Delany, R.C. coadjutor-Bishop of
Hobart, highly approves of the Australian Con-
tingent. He says that, the tocsin of war being
sounded, every true patriot should rally to the
defence of the Empire without pausing to consider
motives or causes, &c.—
During recent Hobart election, Lands
Minister Mulcahy said that Cameron, because he
set the ball rolling that bowled out skipper Miles,
and deposed the Braddon Govt., wanted to be
made Premier; and he likened him to a private
soldier that won the Y.C. and then expected to
be made a general. Cameron, in reply, at his
next meeting “ No, but Bird, Lewis, and Mul-
cahy were on board a sinking ship, and I went
out in an open boat to rescue them. They re-
warded me by stealing my boat. Mulcahy says I
gave him a certificate of character here a few
months ago, and said he was an honest man, but
that was before he stole my boat.”
If N.S.W. ex-Premier Reid, who already
feels the boom of the coming reaction, could but
put back the clock beyond the evil hour in which
he tendered N.S.W. troops to Britain to help
throttle the Transvaal patriots! “ The Ministry,”
he snarls, “is going off its head about this war-
business.” How clearly he now sees in his mind’s
eye his great lost opportunity! He might not
have succeeded in at once displacing the existing
N.S.W. Government, but on this Transvaal-Con-
tingent issue he would have been able to lay
broad and deep the foundations of his leadership
of the party—the Australian National Party.
Now is the Parting of the Ways.
The old lie about the treachery ot the
Boers at l Bronkhorst Spruit is going round the
Australian Jingo press. And—one among many
witnesses—F. R. Statham, the well-known
Afrikander, writes to London Spectator of Sept.
30
In November, 1881, less than a year after the occur-
rence, Sir Evelyn Wood, in my presence and in the
presence of several military officers and civilians (includ-
ing the late Sir Robert Fowler, M.P.), emphatically gave
it as his opinion that the Bronkhorst Spruit affair was “a
fair fight.” lam one of those who regard a war between
Great Britain and the Transvaal as something more than
absolutely unnecessary. But even if I thought such a
war could be justified, I should consider it a miserable
business to go about slandering my enemy beforehand.
The Australian liar is in even worse case, since he
makes it his business to slander someone else’s
enemy—a little band of patriots fighting for
hearth and country against the overwhelming
British.
The moral courage displayed by Q. Labor-
leader Dawson over the Transvaal contingent
business has raised him high in the estimation of
men who place the expression of honest conviction
before popular favor. Dawson denounced the
contingent in fierce terms, and has stuck to
every word of his
original statement
in the face of much
abuse and many
threats of per-
sonal violence.
RATION-BREAKING AND NATION-
MAKING.
FEDERATION: “Alas, my boy! are you then too
intent on the breaking of another man’s nation
to care for the making of your own?”
AUSTRALIA: “Garni don’t bother me. Can’t you
see I’m busy?”
Ex-Pre-
mier More-
head was the
only Leg. Coun-
cillor in the Land
of Mysterious Mur-
der who raised his
voice against Queens-
land’s participation
in the Boer butchery.
Poor old Morehead
might have de-
veloped into a Radi-
cal statesman all
the legislation he did
attempt was of a
Democratic kind and
his Ministry fell try-
ing to pass a property-tax—had he been able to
throw the Q.N.B. shackles off his wrists.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Wise asks, as a
cogent reason against having a Crown Defender
to look after undefended prisoners, whether the
Defender would be expected to appear for accused
persons, even if he believed them guilty. And this
foolish little question actually seemed to impress
the Assembly. So long as the Crown Prosecutor
appears against prisoners, whether he thinks them
innocent or not, the Crown Defender would appear
for them whether he thought them guilty Or not.
He couldn't be exp.ected to have more conscience
or prescience than a Crown Prosecutor—could he ?
The fact that a Melbourne syndicate made
£330,000 profit in about two months on an outlay
of only .£106,000 (say 150 per cent, per annum),
by buying the late James Tyson’s Gippsland
estate in one lump, and re-selling in small farms,
shows chat there is money for the State in the
business of resuming large properties for closer
settlement, if it is done on business lines.- But
the first essential is that the State must have
power of compulsory purchase at a fair price.
The idea that it is a wealthy idiot who should
always pay twice as much as any other buyer
needs to be killed dead to begin with.
THE TWO NOSES.
BILLL RYAN : “ Now, yards. I’m Paul Sinkervalley,
an’ if Ike Jonsen ’ll on’y turn ’is ’ead t’other
way, I’ll jest balance this piece o’ pyper on me
boko.”
The Lyne Government materially im-
proves the N.S.W. Early Closing Bill by making
it apply to all municipalities, with power of ex-
tension to outside districts. And it is plodding
on steadily with the measure, despite the raucous
ourse of Tory ex-Premier Reid, who raised up his
voice the other night to denounce the whole busi-
ness as an “ outrage.”
Premier Lyne’s reported statement at the
recent soi-disant “ patriotic ” meeting that all the
N.S.W. Assembly members who opposed the
Transvaal expedition had since come round to the
other side and were among the most enthusiastic
supporters of the thing, is quite baseless. But it
is true that Lyne has the Labor-party, as a party,
in his pocket over the matter, the bulk of the
members being too cowardly, too fearful for their
billets, to stem the popular panio of the hour.
It is alleged, apparently on good authority,
that the Labor party in S.A. Assembly proposed
to abandon Kingston and throw in its lot with the
Tories on the paltry excuse that the Stagnant
Crowd was willing to enact that no man should be
a member of both the State and the Federal Par-
liament, while Kingston wasn’t. The unholy
alliance, it is declared, was only averted by the
votes of the Labor members in the Council.
The price of the proposed apostacy is said to have
been two portfolios in a new Fat Man Govern-
ment, or one portfolio and the billet of Govern-
ment Whip.
Now, when the British guns are
booming, says
Lyne, is not
cuss the rights
the Transvaal
simply the duty
bans to help close-
imperial ranks.”
N.S.W. Premier
the time to dis-
or wrongs of
war; it is
of Austra-
up the
“Now
is not
the
time !” Then, when was, or is, the time? Was
it when the bebaubled and the bauble-expectant,
decided, behind the backs cf Parliament and the
people, to ■practically commit Australia to the
sending of mercenaries on an errand of Robbery-
under-Arms ? .
The Q. Lands Repurchase Act as worked
by the dishonest Brisbane oligarchy, is made intoan
engine for buying from friends of persons in high
places, at a big figure, land which the Govt,
previously sold for a low figure or no figure at all.
The Seaforth estate at Mackay—in the constitu-
ency of Ministers Dairymple'and Chataway—was
valued by the owners for rating purposes at
12«. fid. per acre, and was sold to the Govt, at
.£3 13s. per acre ! MTlwraith might smell the
familiar stink of the transaction in Scotland.
* The Elections
Bill before Q. As-
sembly provides for
.the elimination of
all existing quali-
fications except that
of residence for 12
months in the pro-
vince and three
months in one dis-
trict. The contin-
gent vote clauses
are retained. Pro-
vision is made for
absent electors to
record votes wher-
ever they may be
by absentee voting-
papers. When new
rolls are compiled,
every elector will
receive a notice
calling on him to
make a fresh claim
for registration, failing which his name
will not be placed on the roll. And to think
that this measure directly emanated from the
carrying of that allegedly undemocratic Federal
Enabling Bill!
It was strictly in keeping with “ the
eternal fitness” that the Australian-Imperialist
military bosses disallowed chaplains to their
brigand contingents. We have never read, for
instance, that Captain Kidd or Bully Hayes
carried a chaplain round, and, to come nearer
home, neither Mr. Daniel Morgan, nor the Jin-
gera Clarkes, nor Frank Gardiner, Esq., nor the
late Mr. Butler, are known to have had spiritual
advisers in their train. Even' the Kelly Gang
had no chaplain—until Ned stood on the gallows,
or thereabouts.
A. R. Addison in S.A. Upper House :
The strongest opponents of this measure (the pouncil
Reform scheme*) in my district are two men one ol wnom
has paid no rent for five years while the other has P
no rent for three years. ... The Hon. Mr. Ward talks
about the folly of giving votes to men who live in nouses
not fit for pigs. Well, it may be an honest pig ana one
that pays its rent.
“You may carry fire and sword into the
midst of peace and industry—such a war of the
strongest Government in the world against this
weak little Republic will bring you no glory, it
will bring you no profit but mischief, and it will
be wrong. You may make thousands of women
widows and thousands of children fatherless. It
will be wrong. You may add a new province to
your Empire. It will still be wrong. You may
give greater buoyancy to the South African stock
and share market. You may create South Afri-
can booms. You may send the price of Mr.
Rhodes’s Chartereds up to a point beyond the
dreams of avarice. Yet, even then it will be
wrong.”—JohnMorley, tothe British, 15th Sept.,
1899.
“ The Boers have invested Aliwal North.”
This is the town which gave its name to the treaty
of 1869, which the British broke (as they had
broken the treaties of 1852). Britain undertook
by the treaty of Aliwal North to leave the Boers
alone; and as soon as diamonds were found at
Kimberley they broke the treaty, annexed the
Free State territory, and grabbed the diamonds.
“This one action,” writes Fronde in “Oceana,”
“ has been the cause of all the troubles which
have since befallen South Africa.” The Boers
know England as a robber and treaty-breaker,
and (in the Jameson raid) as a filibuster. Yet
the British find it strange that the Boers import
ammunition, fortify tteir capital, and drill their
militia !
On 4th November S.M. Herald devoted
a whole leading article to the subject of the two
British subjects who have been murdered in the
Transvaal within the last few years
This roused the Uitlander population. They prepared
immense petitions to the Queen invoking the protection
of their country. The British Government was at once
put in the position of either abandoning British subjects
who complained of systematic abuse, or else supporting
these subjects in their just claims for redress of
grievances.
It is lucky for Paul Kruger that the unpunished
Gatton murders didn’t also happen in the Trans-
vaal, or he would probably have been blown from
a cannon. But why the country where three
British subjects have just been butchered with
impunity should be so angry at the country where
only two have been murdered passes understand-
ing. If Australia wanted to demonstrate that the
slaughter of British subjects is not to go un-
punished, there was no need to send a Contingent.
Tt would have been much cheaper to hang Premier
Dickson.
The grandiloquent N.S.W. Works Minister
O’Sullivan rants about “ Australia facing the
Dawn!” Rather it is the Omadhaun “facing”
Australia! Pinchgut Rock, on part of which
Fort Denison stands and where O’Sullivan would
build his colossus, carried its well-fed gallows in
the early days and saw starved wretches swung
off while the city sat down to breakfast. From
Fort Denison there can be significance in no
direction —save that at the moment of the poser’s
maunderings transports steam past carrying Aus-
tralian mercenaries to the disgraceful work of
strangling a brave nation in the interests of Greed.
Further, OS. says that all the states entering the
Commonwealth should be invited to contribute
to the expense of erecting the colossus. With as
much fitness the states could be invited to buy a
pair of pants for the Parliamentary representative
of Jerrabombera. The Bulletin moves as an
amendment the statue should be at Roebourne
(W. A.) and should look north-westward, and be
called “ Australia Facing its Creditors.” Roe-
bourne is nearer in a bee-line to our creditors than
any other Australian town.
Let us shout long and loud,
Soggarth aroon;
Shout with the biggest crowd,
Soggarth aroon ;
Let us pretend to see
Freedom in tyranny,
Virtue in villainy,
Soggarth aroon.

So that periods jingle let the sense go hang.
Sing about the “ Old King,” whom we must not

Nothing of the New Ring filled with lucre’s lust.
Use your knack of rhyming so that all the clamor
Seems pure patriotic. Pshaw! ’tis nought but

Bosh, of death or •glory in the cause of Beit!
Mark in Eckstein, Wernher, and the German-
sheeny gang,
What is there of England? Npt from it they
sprang.
Trump up lying messages, spread the false report;
Any rot of this sort does for the untaught.
As it did aforetime, paving bogus raid
Flashed the wire the danger of the child and maid.
Never one in danger, when the truth was told,
Cowardly invention in the raid for gold.
In the doughty Jameson host prating war’s
alarms,
All it did of fighting laying down its arms !
Sing of pinchbeck heroes, eager for the fray
Till the rifles rang out, eager then to stay.
Sing Colossus Money-Bags, man of false renown
King of Money, Grubbers, with a tinsel Crown.
Sing of all the. humbug, sing of all the flam,
Seven or five years’ franchise? No one cares a

Distant be the fatal day, and cursed he the hour
When English blood is shed or risked for lucre's

referred to. A 200-word telegram (probably
franked) was received in reply. The last sen-
tence reads : —
• • . It is a pity Parliament has not something better to
do than waste its time on such frivolous nonsense.
(Signed) Edward T. Miles.
Coming from a man whom Parliament recently
forced to resign bis seat and portfolio because of
crooked practices in connection with Marine
Board contracts, this rebuke ought to have con-
siderable effect.
The opinions of the ruck of the W.A.
Ministry (which is mostly ruck) are interesting
reading. The Attorney-General holds that the
Commonwealth Bill shouldn’t be referred to the
people at all—that Parliament should settle tho
matter; but if there must be a referendum he
thinks that no Federation Bill should be accepted
unless tivo-thirds of the voters support it. If there
are 7000 votes against Federation and 13.090 for
it he reckons the 7000 should win. The Minister
of Railways reckons it is “unsafe” to let the
people have any voice at all in the matter. And
the Commissioner of Lands wants to refer both
Bills to the people, but even if the people accept
the present Bill he is going to oppose it all he
knows. Said Commissioner believes that the
voice of the people should prevail if the people
yell the way he yells —not otherwise.
It goes without the saying that Sands and
McDougall, of Melbourne, have published a
capital war map of South Africa, showing all the
railway lines completed up to date.
British colonists in South Africa cut a
poor figure in comparison with the American
colonists of yore who greatly assisted to capture
Canada from the French. Says the historian
The war with the French broke the American feeling of
dependence on the mother country. Poorly armed,
equipped, and disciplined, the colonial, or- “ provincial”
troops had certainly shown fighting qualities of.no mean
order. Colonists would not have been disposed, under
any circumstances, to underrate the military qualities of
their own men, but their self-glorification found a larger
material because of the poor quality of the officers who
were sent to represent Great Britain in the colonies. . . .
the incompetence of many of the British officers is almost
incomprehensible. Its effects were increased by an iilftr
indifference to the advice of colonial leaders which, in a
new and unknown country, was certain to place British,
soldiers again and again in positions where they appeared
to great disadvantage alongside of their colonial allies or
rivals. The provincial who had stood his ground, firing
from behind trees and stumps, while the regulars ran past
him in headlong retreat, came home with a sense of his
own innate superiority which was sure to bring its
results. The defeat of Braddock (a “gallant and
opinionated” British officer) was the prologue to Blin-
ker’s Hill.
The champion Australian Jingo is the
leader-writer of a Bendigo (Vic.) paper. Writing
of the capitulation of 1500 British troops at Lady-
smith, he says :
Sir George White says he alone is accountable for having
sent these two battalions to an untenable position. So be
it. Commanders of armies have been broken or shot for
smaller mistakes. But if Sir George White sent his troops
to a death trap, it is to be presumed he did not tell them
they could escape b.v laying down their arms ! From
that black and craven crime the officers and men them-
selves can never be absolved. The Royal Irish Fusileers
and Gloucestershire regiments will never wash out that
stain ; no, nor the British Army itself. No excuse or
“ explanation” can diminish its baseness. It mattered
not if the 1500 were surrounded by 15,000 foes, their duty
was, as is the duty of all British soldiers, to die rather
than surrender. Would there have been any British
Empire to-day but for the actions fought and won, or
fought and lost, against impossible odds ! The extermina-
tion of Sir George White’s army, if every man had died
fighting, would have been a lesser calamity than the
capitulation of this fifteen hundred. It is the greatest, h ow
to the honor and prestige of England recorded m her his-
tory. . . . No victories to come can efface the s aiu on
the national scutcheon. If those fifteen hundred nun
had died fighting: they might not have saved the day, hnt-
the.v would have saved the honor of their army and their
nation, and'the never-to'be-forgotten disgrace which will
accompany every one of them to his dying hour. Ilad-
their bodies been left on the Drakensberg ranges they
would have died heroes; they are alive and they are pol-
troons, the prisoners and playthings of the lordly voor-
trekker and his viouw. It is to be earnestly hoped that
their lives will be made intolerable. That the filthy Boer
will spit in their faces and the women use them ns they
use the Kaffirs. The names of the infamous fifteen hun-
dis.,l should he published broadcast through the empire,
they should be expelled from the army and cast out. of
the nation. They have done more to- degrade and dis-
honor England than all her enemies combined could
effect, and where the shame and evil of their example-
will end will not be known in this generation. Let them
be anathema. ...
Now when this stupendous hero gets into a much
smaller tight place—say, when he is confronted
with one libel writ instead of with 2000 rifles—-
does he always fight it out to the bitter end
regardless of ruin, and carry his appeal, if need be,
to the highest court in the empire, and go down
gloriously in an ocean of costs—or does he ever
cravenly withdraw his remarks, and thereby
become an infamous editor whose filthy sub-
scribers ought to spit on him ? *

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
THE F A.MOXTS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OP ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation m the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where Coughs have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient
and a Complete Cure is certain. & 6 J *

CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I beard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Dear Sir. —I suffered from a severe cold on the chest,
with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit
until I used your Bronchitis Cure, which gave me relief
at once, and completely cured me. lam delighted with
it. It is a really wonderful medicine ; does good at once,
and “can’t be licked.”—Yours sincerely,

had a bottle from you before for my little girl when she
was seven months old. She had been suffering ffom
bronchitis from her birth, and now she is 3 years old, and
has not had a return of it since. It is a splendid medi-
cine for bronchitis or colds of any sort.

I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.”
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent, her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”
12 Years’ Agony.
DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were enlirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—l remain, Sir,
yours most respectfully,
“WILLIAM CROCKETT,
“Baker's Swamp P. 0., via Dripstone, New South
Wales.”
A Five Years’ Case.
CURED BY ONE SMALL BOTTLE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—Kindly send me one
large bottle of your Bronchitis Cure. lam more than
pleased with the results of your wonderful medicine, as a
small bottle cured my little girl, who had been suffering
for five years, and now I do not feel safe to be without it.
I remain, yours respectfully,
AGNES F. KENNEDY,
Bethanga, Victoria.
A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“Dear Sir,—Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief!
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment!
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS' CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes “After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced toitry Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then
which was in the beginning of 1883— 15 years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it,.”
Writing again on the 4t,h April, 1899, he states:—“ I
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

In re the returning N.S.W. Lancers :
Dear Bulletin. —One point may as well be emphasised
for the benefit of a small unthinking section of the
N.S.YV. public who seem to feel satisfied that the proper
way to establish the certainty of their own pluck and
general ability to see red is to blackguard the 31 Lancers
who are coming home to Australia from Aldershot.
Despite all that has been said in official quarters, the
whole detachment in England never did volunteer for
service in South Africa. And unless that word “ volun-
teer ” is to be used, iu future, in its true meaning,
it ought to be dropped. Colonel Burns says that he
does not believe that there is a coward in'the Aider-
shot lot; the public of N.S.W., some of whom know
better even than Colonel Burns many of the reasons
actuating the returning-31 (for some reasons have been
thoughtfully veiled from Ids eyes) also believe that there
are no cowards. But if five or seven are virtually court-
martialled for not volunteering there will be proved to
exist cowards—or something worse—elsewhere. The
balderdash that has been talked over these Lancers is
enough to excite ridicule, were the occasion not of con-
siderable moment to men who had to muster up more
pluck to come than to stop. London Chronicle was cor
rect, even though Agent-General Salomons contradicted
its statement, that all the N.S.W. Lancers had not volun-
teered, and it verified its statement as soon as the
detachment got to Table Bay. And the N.S.W. public
may he informed that the Lancers did not get a chance
of taking part, with the British troops in theanlumn
manoeuvres, which they went ’Ome primarily to see. —X.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The time for Merriwee’s Cep (3.3HJ) has only
twice been equalled (in length) within the past 24 years.
Glenloth in 'O2, and the mare Briseis in 70, recorded the
same time exactly.
Herbert Power, owner of Merriwee, dates his
recent run of luck from the time he moved into his pre-
sent house in Albert-street, E. Melb. The building,
standing against the handsome Presbyterian College, was
formerly Don Juan House, the historic residence erected
by Joe Thompson after the horse, Don Juan, won the
Cup. The bookie occupied the house up to the time he
left for England, and new owners changed its name.
The stable is credited with bagging about £BO,OOO over
Merriwee’s win.
* * * *
Merriwee’s owner has stuck to the turf con-
sistently for 30 years : 22 years ago he had an even
better thing than Merriwee in Savanaka, which did
not come off through Waxy falling in front of him,
thus enabling Chester to win by a head. Strange
tosay, Merriwee was interfered with last Tuesday
week by Blue Metal and Burrahri coming down, but for-
tunately that did not prevent him getting home. Through
training his coll privately the owner got the cream of the
market—which is good biz. (when it can be done) for
those who feed and keep the nag.
• » • *
Circumstances conspired to prevent the general
public getting very sweet, on Merriwee's chance for
the Cup. in the first place, they didn’t expect the com-
paratively “ flark " cot to win the Derby although he
was second favorite at the start. Outside the stable circle
the excellence of Merriwee was not even suspected until
the week previous to the Derby, and when at last he
came to be talked of as a “rod in pickle,’’the public
were naturally incredulous. It is so seldom that an
eleventh-hour “tip" for the Derby proves to he the
best horse of the season. Merriwee won the blue ribbon
in capital style, but the time was slow, therefore for
want of proof that he was anything more than the best
of a moderate field punters remained sceptical about his
ability to do w hat only two 3-year-olds (Newhaven and
Aura'ria) had done in the past 12 years or more. Then,
when they were just beginning to ask themselves
whether the older horses might he an unusually bad lot,
the rairi came down in torrents, and all the “knowing”
people expected that the ’99 Cnp race would produce
another surprise—of the Glenloth kind. Anyway, they
couldn't form a big. fancy for little Merriwee, who looked
hardly strong enough to win in dry weather. So the
Derby winner landed the double amidst very little cheer-
ing—save the hoarse shouts of Ike.v Mo.
* * * *
Through winning Melbourne Derby and Cup
Merriwee falls into line with Lantern, Briseis, Chester,
Grand Flaneur, Martini-Henry and Newhaven, each
credited with the dual victory. Under existent circum-
stances the achievement is a great one as the Derby
winner is called upon to carry vv.f.a. in the big event.
Record for 43 years shows that only seven Derby w inners
have got home in the Cup, and of all these only Martini-
Henry, New haven and Merriwee carried w.f.a.
* » • »
Winners over Merriwee’s Cup, outside the
stable ami its immediate connections, are not plentiful.
One Sydney turf writer on a sporting weekly, who has
been singularly successful as a tipster-simply because
he sees the horses at work every morning and puts two
and two together before venturing an opinion—hacked
the Cups double at £lOOO to £2, besides winning £lOO or
so straight-out on Dewey.
* • * *
Wins of Merriwee and Finland at recent V.R.C.
meeting have given Bill of Portland stock a great boost.
A set was made against the imported St. Simon sire upon
his arrival, but getting Bobadil in his first, Merriwee in
his second, and Finland in his third years should knock all
decriers.
• • * *
“Merriwee did not please in a sprint with
Tramp," wrote the Melb. Hhr-ald tout, on Derby morning.
Also the Aon tout reported, “ Merriwee bears a well-
trained appearance, but has lightened off considerably
since ,he was last seen in public. Now that he is
thoroughly prepared and reduced in bulk, Merriwee does
not fill the eye as a typical Derby colt, but looks do not
account for everything.” That’s so.
* * * *
The hill at Flemington under the influence of a
little rain anrl a good deal of wear-and-tear becomes a
shocking snare, and as hard to keep a grip on as a greased
buckjumper or a mountain of moist soap. On Cup Day
ail sorts, sexes, and conditions of people were shooting
its shiny cataracts. Just about Cup time, when the
slides were getting in their best work, many fat and
reputable citizens were knocked into the mud by frenzied
strangers, who tobogganed wildly down hill on their
beam-ends, and portly matrons slipped, slid, tottered, ~
and then shot for the lowlands, iike green logswinging
down a skid. Also, the Flat was a bottomless black bog,
and over near the carriage-paddock, where traffic is
thickest and the drunks most do congregate, was a veri-
table glue-pot, which caught unguarded inebriates as
fly-paper traps its victims. One genial soul, carrying a
terrific load of beer, placidly sank after a half-hearted
struggle; into the warm mud, and composed himself to
sleep. He was subsequently rescued by a begrimed and
weary policeman, who declared he had been plucking
boozy dreamers from the bed of black clay all through
the afternoon. The same policeman averred that, when
struggling to lift one man from the mud, he was abused
by the crowd for not letting the men “have it out.”
There was another nian beneath.
• * • *
This year at least the awful Cup
Was blessed in each teetotal quarter :
For Pluvius first filled it up,
Then overflowed the thing with water 1
• * * *
Although the amount of early betting on the
Cup is not a fourth of what it was a dozen years ago, and
the crowd outside the V.R.C. office on “accept&nce-dav,”
which one time overflowed from the pavement into the
roadway, is now represented by about two men and a
boy, the “books” must have had a lot of dead-stuff on
hand before the horses went to the post. Cranberry,
Cocos, The Chief, Fleet Admiral, were warm public
favorites as far back as September, and week-after-week
they were backed, until they all went dotty.
.** » " *
Melb. Stakes running, which in two years out
of three, throws some light op the Melb. Cup chances,
merely served to misguide the public this year. Allow-
ing for tlie difference between the w.f.a. and handicap
terms there was no reason to expect Mora, Wait-a-Bit
and Gauleon, the three placed horses for the Stakes, to
he beaten in the" Cup' by three—Voyou, War God and
Dirk Hammerhand—that had finished far behind them in
the shorter race.
English-bred bay, Voyou, which Australasian
says was foaled in N.S.W., was certainly the enigma of
recent V.RtC. meeting. Going better than anything at
Flemington in the mornings, he look his supporters down
twice in public outings when they swore by him, then
came along .and squelched Flodden after a ding-dong
fight right to the post; later, ran a close-second in Melb.
Cup, and last. Saturday got away with V.R.C. Handicap
from a good field. .Money went on him pretty freely each
time he won, and in Melb. Cup. Voyou is a nag that has
a will of his own apparently, and the stable know it;
otherwise it would not have backed him so persis-
tently,
• • • •
The starting price of Voyou for Melb. Cup was
returned by the local press at 25 to 1, although it was
hard to get more than 20’s from the “books,” many of
whom were “saving” the mysterious English nag. The
writer put 10s. on Voyou in a Club tote, working on the
“sweep” principle, and got £4 Is. dividend. Which
means that Voyou would have paid nearly 23J4 to one on
a win, and 3 to 1 if it had finished third, nolw ithstand-
ing the Club’s deduction of 10 per cent, commission.
Mr. Francis Foy announces that he has no in-
tention of selling his horses, Voyou and April Fool, and
doesn’t know how it came to be rumored that he ever
thought of such a thing. Voyou, which cost his present
owner only 50 guineas, isn’t for sale at any price, and
will go to Mr. Foy’s stud when finished racing.

All the skiting of the “clever division ” behind
Mora couldn't make the showy mare a warm Cup-favorite.
She was meeting Wait-a-Bit on nearly a stone better
terms than when she beat Him for the Melbourne Stakes,
and, on paper, she was just as much a “ dead-bird ” as
Ruenalf had looked to be in Patron's year. But punters,
who had not quite forgottpn the Ruenalf failure, refused
to accept Mora as a genuine stayer, and they were ap-
parently right. It is one thing 1 for a big lump of horse-
flesh, like Mora, to win a Ij-mile weight-for-ave race and
quite another thing to stay 2 miles under a lighter burden.
The weight in Mora’s ease seemed a less important con-
sideration than the distance she had to travel. It is the
last 3 furlongs that find them out.
* • * *
Owner Forrester reckoned that the heavy rain
which turned the course into a quagmire would enable
War God to win the Melbourne Clip, and he feared noth-
ing but Dewey at the finish. The mud was favorable to
W ar God’s split hoofs, no doubt, yet it didn't seem to suit
his action particularly well, for whereas last year he was
the first horse to get round rhe turn for home, this year
he never got nearer than the fourth position wherein he
finished. Honest, but somewhat slow. War God has been
placed fourth in two successive .Melbourne Cups. Asa
3-year-old he ran third to Merloolas and Amberite in
Sydney Cup.
.... • * »
Starting 27 times. Cocos has won five races—a
poor record indeed for such an undoubted top-sawyer,
llis owner, Tom Payten, tidnks he will run no more.
Cocos has been lucky and unlucky—more the latter
than the former. Bad riding was against him in
Picture's A.J.C. Derby, but fortune stood to him when
he accounted for Bobsdil, and also in the Spring Stakes
won by I.ee-Metford, but which Cocos got. Cocos’s great
dash in Caulfield Cup, with 9.1) up, promised big things,
but the old leg showed out again.

Results of V.R.C. meeting, concluded last
Saturday, are flattering to Mr. Geo. Lee(N.S.W.). The
winner of Derby and Cup, runner-up in Maribyrnong
Plate, and dam of Miss Carbine, who appropriated
Hotham Handicap,, were bred by him. Sires of Dewey’s
and Flintlock's dams, grand-dam of Mora,, and sire of
Wait-a-Bit’s grand-dam all came from Mr. Lee's old mare,
Sappho, bred in his younger days. Merriwee, Wi gel mar,
and Diffidence are from Mr. Lee’s mare, Etra-Weenie.
lie has never owner! more than three-brood mares at one
time, and yet has given to the turf such nags as The
Barb, Barbeile, Barbarian, and several lesser lights.
* , .• » •
Wait-a-Bit, as a four and five-year-old, ran un-
placed in the Xlelb. Stakes. In his sixth year the son of
Malria ran second, not because he had grown more
speedy, but because the horses that beat him aforetime
had either broken down or been exported to England.
The exported Battalion, Grafter, Newhaven, and Aurum,
contemporaries of Wait-a-Bit, represent a good deal of
Melb. Stakes and Cup “ form ” among them. Front ’96
to’9B they filled places as follows Two firsts arid one
second in the Stakes, and two firsts, one second, and one
third in the Cup.
• * * *
Race for 0. B. Fisher Plate, on Saturday,
settled the question as to the relative merits of Merriwee
and Dewey. Former won easily, and now has an indis-
putable claim to the honor of champion three-year-old,
with Parthian second.

For the edification of punters at Caulfield and
Flemington Tub Bulletin gives herewith some statistics
of the 2-year-old racing during the recent carnival, also a
few comments on “ reversals of form.’’ This will help to
explain why the average punter who put his money on
certain horses when they lost, did not piit his money on
them when they won. Particular attention is directed to
the starting prices.

The performances of Kenley on Oct. 14th and
21st were not very impressive. A student of “form”
would not expect to find the colt distinguishing himself
in w.f.a. races a fortnight later, although he would have
to be prepared for the discovery that Kenley was a stayer
rather than a sprinter. Anyway, Kenley won the Maiden
Plate at Flemington (6 furlongs) on Nov. 4th, beating, at
weight for age, the 3-year-old mare Nitre, who subse-
quently won the Oaks. Said Nitre started first favorite
for the Oaks, by the way. In the Maiden Plate, where
there were only four runners, she started at 5 to 1. Again
Kenley, on Nov. 9th, won the Flying Stakes (7 furlongs),
bearing Mora, Djin Djin, Wait-a-bit, and Australian Star
at weight for age. To resume the statistics

Haut Boy, receiving 101 b. from Fol.vxena in a half-mile
flutter, starts first favorite and wins. On this occasion
Haut Boy gives Ulh. to Fides, if you please. In trie
Debutante Stakes, Haut Boy finishes slightly ahead of
Finland, both colts carrying the same weight; but in
Maribyrnong Plate (5 fur.) Finland runs away from Haut
Boy and The Idler. In the Nursery Handicap of Nov. 7,
Haut Boy (unbacked) utterly fails to give 151 b. to Fides,
or 21b. to Polyxena, but two days later he easily beats
Polyxena at level weights.
The Bulletin is not intending to suggest
“cronkness” in the defeats of Haut Bov, Finland,
Kenley, or any other hard-worked youngster whose name
figures in the foregoing lists. This journal merely
advises holiday punters to sit down and oonsider the
foolishness of trying to discover the real "form’’ of
Haut Boy, Finland, Kenley, and Co. Maybe bad jockey-
ship, bad weather, or bad starts -one or other, or all of
those considerations—were accountable for the present
tangled appearance of their merits. The records prove
nothing for certain save that the public are fools to take
such racing seriously, and risk more than a trifling sum
on the chances of the game.
As with the 2-yrar-old racing, so with all the
other racing at Caulfield and Flemington. The consis-
tent “form” shown by Merriwee and Dewey (in his
latter attempts) were oases in a desert of sport, so-called,
which excited no enthusiasm whatever. Take the case
of Voyou, the horse that ran second for Melbourne Cup.
Yoyou surely had given the public no shadow of reason
for backing him, yet the noble army of bookmakers and
trainers, also a few touts, were quite prepared to see
“ the English horse win easily.”
Hon. Bill Long’s demand for an enquiry by the
V.R.C. committee into the runnning of Parthian at the
Spring meeting' sounds like a saiire on sundry other
owners who were content to say nothing about the
vagaries of their nags. Parthian was one of the compara-
tively consistent performers. Starting four times, he ran
third for the Derby, and won two races. It was only in
the Van-Yean Stakes, for which he started favorite, that
Mr. hong’s colt ran poorly. After which Yeomans was
substituted for Mat. Harris on Parthian’s back.
* * * ♦
The C. B. Fisher Plate, run on the last day of
the V.R.C. Spring Meeting, is about the most satisfactory
sporting event of the year. The best horse almost in-
variably gets home. Merriwee’s predecessor was The
Grafter. In '97 Aururn won ; in ’96 Bloodshot, who had
finished second to Newhaven for the Melb. Cup. In ’95,
Wallace arid Auraria, the Derb3' and Cup winners, ran
their famous dead-heat-. Every year since the name of
the Plate was changed from Canterbury to C. B. Fisher,
the result has been strictly according to “ form.”
Sydney police were most unaccountably gal-
vanised into action re tote-shops on Melb. Cup day.
Sensational swoops made on Market anti Pitt-street estab-
ments attracted huge crowds. Only with difficulty were
prisoners got away and then through back entrances and
by means of cabs. In each case 13 were captured ; had
the raid taken place two boms earlier over 100 might
have been snared in one place. The presiding Ikeys
must have “ known something,” for they got away with
the cash—one lacerating his arm badly while bursting
through a window. Since then two other dashes have
been made, but only three or four arrests effected.
Meantime the game flourishes even as the green hay tree,
and looks like continuing to do so ad infinitum.

Major George’s Nelson—Moonga colt, Sea Horse,
appropriated M.L. Cup last week. His sire was a clinker
in bis time. Twelve years ago he bad the Australian Cup
won, hut his rider’s had judgment allowed Trident to
come up and snatch victory almost on the post. Dan
O’Brien’s Malat.ua, by Malua—Faithful, was second to Sea
Hoise. Malatua cost his present owner 460 guineas at
Mr. J. V. Smith’s sale of yearlings in Melbourne. Dan
has long been playing to had luck—had he scored in the
Cup it would have been a popular win indeed ; hut
Saturday’s racing at Christchurch (M.L.) brought a
measure of consolation to him : Malatua won the Jockey
Club Handicap, and at same meeting Sea Horse appro-
priated Canterbury Cup.

The wood-chopping struggle was a big feature
at Kogafah (Sydney) Charity Carnival on 9th irist. The
contest was open to Illawarra railway-line residents.
Twenty men came from different quarters with gleaming,
specially-prepared axes—all out-and-out bushtnen who
knew the business thoroughly. Dressed white-gum logs,
16in. through and sft. high were provided. Each com-
petitor had a “pointer,” who indicated after even - stroke
where next should fall, and had to he mighty quick about
it. Heat winners turned up in Fretus, Towel], M*Don-
nell,- and Bennett. R. M’Donnell won in 2min. 24Jsec.
Every cut made a palpable impression; at times
chunks rolled away. Tow-ell (second) got in 3 chops to
winner’s 2, but they lacked effect.

Practice of the various crews engaged in to-day’s
Interprovincial Eight-oar race, on the Varra, indicates
that that class of rowing, as compared with the form of
years ago, has much deteriorated. S.A. sends a team for
the first time, with a crude style peculiarly its own.
Though the fixture was originally instituted and carried
on for years by Vic and N.S.W., the latter province
dropped out some time hack, owing to a dispute over the
amateurdefinition—Victoria including manual-labor men,
N.S.W. objecting. Subsequently, only Q. and Vic. were
engaged, but now the trouble has been got rid of satis-
factorily, and everything promises well for the future.
Melb. critics aver that the mother-province reps, swing
unevenly and are much inclined to “ bucket ” forward,
but look upon them as a fast crew, liable to make an ex-
citing race. Many good judges think highly of the
Bananalanders' chances. Writer expects to see, as of
yore, N.S.W. and Victoria fighting out the finish, and
will have his dollars on the latter —they go in more for
oar-row ing than the cornstalks.

Most swimming clubs in and around Sydney
had outings on Saturday. A comer for championship
honors was introduced. Craig, of Balmain Club, covered
97yds. in lm. 3 l-ssec., which it is any odds he will im-
prove upon later, and thus take rank with “Mud”
Bishop, Lane and co.

A.A.A.U. championship, decided in Brisbane
last week, left supremacy with M.L. (5 wins). Q. and
N.S.W. scored 4 each, but as the mother province had
iimst seconds it goes above Q. Vic. was last, securing 2
wins only. M.L. got away with 1-mile walk (M’Affer),
throwing 161 b. hammer—l3oft. 2in., an Australian record
(Madill), 3-miles flat (Malthus), pole vault—loft. lljin.
(Te Paa), and 440yds. hurdles (Smith). N.S.W. won high
jump—sft. Sin. (English); 100yds. flat—9 9-10 sec. (Row-
ley) ; long jump—2lft. 9Jin. (English), and 220yds.—
22 l-ssec, Australian record (Rowley). Q. triumphs were
—putting 161 b. shot—43ft. 2in., Australian record
(Hawkes), 3-miles walk (Corrigan), 880yds. flat (Went-
worth), 1-mile flat (Wentworth). Vic. got home in 120yds.
hurdles (Gardner) and 440yds. flat (Shea). On the whole,
performances were mediocre, and should convince the
Union that the idea of a team for England and Paris next
year must be abandoned, as it probably will in any case,
for funds are low all round.

Cycling doesn’t pay in Adelaide. S.A. League
of wheelmen dropped £6O over its recent two-days’
meeting-, despite favorable weather and absence of rival
attractions. Yet, on top of this, S.A. Cricket Associa-

The most exciting event at the recent Rand wick
rifle meeting was the “Queen’s.” Alhury Jacobs, who
put up a possible at one range, in the final round ran his
score to 268, and was reckoned a certainty until “ Bisley ”
Fargher pegged along and got to 269, when the event
looked all over. Then Hicks, of Shellharbor, stepped in,
and, shooting beautifully, finished up at 271, amidst
cheers. Meanwhile his brother, J. G., reckoned to lie
clean out of it, was coolly dotting up bulls’-eyes, and,
continuing to do so with great he also
finished up at 271. The shoot-off from the 900yds. mark
was a peculiar contest. J. O. fired first, and missed the
target every time, and his brother proceeded to do like-
wise, but his last shot hit an inch from the edge and he
won. .

“M.Q.” : See Murphy (7.12) and Evans (8.6)
fought for the bantam-weight championship of Tasmania
t'other day, and Evans won in fifth round. How can
sporting scribes call Evans a“ bantam,” seeing thatSst. is
the maximum of that division ? Evans is in the
“ feather" class.

The Australian Star said of the Jeffries-
Sharkey fight that “ the journals which find no fault with
such exhibitions are busy denouncin';: the brutality of
Spanish bull-fights.” Hut the important difference in the
cases is that the pug. is a free agent—needn t light if tie
doesn’t want to ; whereas the bull, besides being de-
liberately tortured into fighting, lias no chance from the
start, never being allowed to leave the arena alive. Then
there is the butchery of the forlorn old crocks of horses
that are rewarded for a life of usefulness by a, in many
ca-es, lingering death —inasmuch as they are sometimes
led off with entrails dragging on the ground, to he tem-
porarily patched-up and sent on again to supply more
“sport.” No amount of whitewash can make a prize-
fight an elevating spectacle, hut, compared with a bull-
fight, it is a lecture on moral philosophy.
* * • *
In the light of past experience, the public were
quite justified in presuming that the Caulfield Guineas
would prove to have been somewhat of a Derby trial.
The Lest of the Guineas horses are very apt to get there
or thereabouts in the chief three-year-old event, hut this
year punters were woefully deceived. Tremarden, Scorn,
and Promontory, the placed ones at Caulfield, finished
tenth, seventh, and ninth in the Derby.
* * • •
Compare the running in the October Stakes at
Caulfield with what was seen at Flemingtoti on Derby
Day, four week later, Scorn (8.4) finished a neck behind
Mora (8.13) and a couple of lengths in front of Dewey
(8.4) and Wait-a-Bit (9.11). It would seem that Scorn
can't go further than 10 furlongs, the distance of the
October Stakes aforesaid.
* * * •
Wanted, for the Australian turf two or three
very “ crack ” jockeys who would each pick his mounts
from more than one particular stable, and make a
speciality of always riding to win. Wanted, something
that punters could swear by, as in the days when James
White and Donald Wallace competed for the big prizes,
and horses from other stabies were considered quite good
enough to follow if Hales or Mick O’Brien happened to be
“ up. ” These times there is no simple means of discover-
ing bona-fide goers and possible winners, and no unin-
formed punter cares to hack a nag on the hare fact that
it belongs to a particular man, or will he the mount of a
fashionable jockey. In fact (here are no fashionable
jockeys to speak of. Take the two important w.f.a. races,
Melbourne Stakes and Derby, for ’9B and ’99 —four events
in all. The greatest number of starters for either event
in either year was IX, the total number of starters being
37. and if there had been a dozen representative “ crack”
jockeys available, they would have sufficed to put those
four w.f.a. races through, presuming that all the owners
concerned were genuine sports desirous of getting the
best possible riding talent on the job. Well, 25 jockeys
were employed, and only two of them figured oftener
than one--oh the back of a “plac'd” horse. M. Harris
and VV. Delaney—who each rode twice into a place—were
the rare exceptions.
• * • »
As evidence of how little respect is paid to
jockeyship in Australia, it is worth mentioning that the
lists of principal race-winners published in “Miller's
Racing Chronicle ” don’t give the names of the riders at
all.

And GEORGE STREET. BRISBANE-
Despite every effort of suppression, the funda-
mental decency of the B'-er leaders constant.ly
leaks out in cabled messages. Prisoners are
kindly trealed, uniformly. The wounded are
well looked after when in Boer hands.
The combatants “fraternise” over the
treatment of the wounded after one
sharp skirmish. Kruger safeguards British
property in the Transvaal, and, so far as we
have definite news of any kind, the amenities
of civilised warfare are being strictly observed.
Still the yarns about firing on the hospitals and
the Red-Cross flag, about luring Britishers into
traps by means of flags of truce, are always
with us, and may be resignedly accepted as
likely to be with us to the end. By the way,
what has become of the silly (because chemi-
cally-impossible) cyanide yarn of the wholesale
poisoning of the streams by Boers? And what
is the difference, either from a humanitarian
or a military standpoint, between poisoning
water witli cyanide, and poisoning air with the
unrespirable fumes of Lyddite ? The British
unquestionably have committed the one atrocity,
and the Boers, equally unquestionably, up to
the present, haven’t committed the other. Yet
our daily rags calmly go on re-echoing every
London libel and ascribing a monopoly of
“treachery” and inhumanity to the Boers.
The “ conscience ” of the self-righteous
Jingo has to be lulled into quietude by suf-
ficient calumnies about the enemy before it will
allow him to attack them.
Mr. J. A. Wilkinson (Coolalta Wines) lias

quality of Coolalta wine.*
Everything considered, Merriwec’s capture
of tlm “ double ’’ was a great achievement, and,
considering the keenness of the contest in business
enterprise, the constant winning of “doubles” by
the London and American Supply Stores is also
remarkable. Said wins being for. fine quality of
goods combined with reasonableness of price.

Bad luck fell upon a Portland (Vic.)
family recently. First a sister was burnt to
death, then her husband met a similar fate, one
brother shot himself, and another w as found dead
on the,sands. The last of the family, a woman,
w'as drowned the other day.
South Australia is going it! Market-
gardeners and their laborers are actually arranging
a scale of working hours. Some dissatisfied toilers
have been grumbling that from sunrise to sunset
isn’t a fair tiling every day of the week ; and the
employers reckon they might manage to fix the
knock-off for four o’clock Saturday afternoons.
But a concession like that is not to be made
lightly ; so a committee has been appointed to
sleep on it.
Perished recently the Wellington (M.L.)
Critic after a short and inglorious career. It was
started to smash Seddou and died (according to
itself) because it was too good for degenerate
Maoriland, and because it was born 25 years before
its time. In reality it died through trying to eat
a brick wall with an inefficient set of teeth.
Nearly all its tales (reprinted without acknowledg-
ment) had originally appeared in The Bulletin,
and the rest of its space was devoted principally
to enonnous'y lengthy statements to the effect
that The Bulletin is a low’ paper and panders to
the masses.
Kipling has written that, ivhen the
casualties in battle amount to 50 per cent, of the
combatants, w r ar will cease; and, according to
Block’s big book on “The Future of War” —
“ The outward and visible sign of the end of war
was the introduction of the magazine-rifle.”
Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating,
and here are the casualties in six battles fought
within two centuries —the first three with the
smoothbore musket: —Blenheim (1704), casualties
(killed and wounded), 26 per cent. ; Zorndorf
(1758), casualties 38 per cent. ; Marengo (1800),
casualties 22 per cent. ; Solferino (1859), muzzle-
loading rifle, casualties 10 per cent. ; Sadcuva
(1866), breech-loader against muzzle-loader,
casualties G per cent. ; Gravelotte (1870), breech-
loaders, casualties 9 per cent. Thus we see that
as weapons improve casualties diminish. 'I here
are no reliable figures available to show the effect of
the magazine-rifle ; but latest renorts from the
Transvaal seem to indicate that the casualties
there have been about 10 per cent, of combatants
actually engaged at Glencoe, Eland’s Laagte, and
on Oct! 29, but there the bayonet w'as freely used.
Statements of inventors and reports of target
practice lead to absurdly exaggerated estimates of
the effect of artillery and rifle fire in battle.
If The Bulletin says so then it must be
right— that M‘Lean Bros, and Rigg, Ltd., of
Melbourne and Sydney, are the right people, for
electro-plated goods, table cutlerv, pocket knives,
&c. They also have the latest, cheapest, and best
method for summer cooking—the Primus Chief
Cooking and Steaming Apparatus, 70s. and 80s.
Call and see them at work. Also the Royal Bath
Heater for Wood, price 70s. Don't forget, for

Cabled, from Maoriland, the demise of
Lieut.-col. McDonnell—after Von Tempsky, the
most noted of Maori-figbters in the sanguinary
bush warfare of the sixties. Of Irish extraction,
and the son of a naval officer, he was as brave a
soldier as ever buckled on a sword. His rashness,
in fact, has somewhat dimmed his military credit,
the ambushing of his force, at the second battle
of Te Ngutu-o to-Manu (Anglice, “The bill of the
bird ”), being a black mark against him as a tac-
tician. However, though in this fight his reputa-
tion as a stategist suffered, he put a pinnacle on
his fame for bravery. The ambuscade of the
Maoris, under wily old Titokowarn, involved
McDonnell’s column whilst on a narrow track,
margined by dense bush and four miles from open
country. The bush vomited lead, the Forest
Rangers fell fast, and retreat was inevitable.
The wounded were collected, and were saved
by the bravery of the leader, who, when
the stretcher - bearers wavered in their duty,
and seemed inclined to desert their charges,
remained under a hail of bullets until the wounded
had passed to comparative safety. Then, through
the long, trying march, lie covered the rear of his
little column, and got out of the mess with ail the
honors of war. On another occasion, whilst
scouting witli Von Tempsky, the twain were
hidden in a flax swamp without food for 48 hours,
but brought away a large amount of valuable in-
formation overheard from the Maoris in an adja-
cent pah. Altogether, M'Donnell, during tlie
war, was under fire 40 times, and was four times
wounded. His services were tardily recognised by
Govt. 20 years after with the much-prized Cross.
Despite tbe fervent beat and amid the
rush of jingo literature, The Bulletin gladly
rises to record the receipt of volutin- VII. of Hor-
witz’s Victorian Statutes, and to lock the valuab e
tome away safely in its bookcase, for Horwitz’s
Statutes is a valuable work. The 7th vol. takes
up the thread of Vic. legislation from “ Public
Service”to “Sugar,’’ including the Public Works
Act of I*9o, Railway Act 1800, Real Property
Act of the same year, Registration of Deaths,
Births and Marriages Acts 1800 and ’93, and (lie
Seaman’s Act 1890. The Acts are arranged in
alphabetical and chronological order, with notes
and indices, and there is also an alphabetical list
of the cases cited in the volume, which is a big
succession of warning beacons am id the shoals and
rocks of precedent.
N.S.W., Parliamentary item
Mr. 0. H. U"i<i, leader of the Opposition in the Legisla-
tive Assembly, last night presented a petition signed by a
very large number of storekeepers and others in ihe city
of Sydney and suburbs with regard to Ihe Early Closing
Bili. They asked the House loagrce to such amendments
in the measure as would prevent the interests of hiv dreds
of struggling owners of businesses being saeriticed in giv-
ing relief to tbe sho)> assistants. The shopkeepers on
whose behalf the amendments were solicited were said to
be people who mainly depended on business done after 6
o’clock for a livelihood.
The late-hour str.uggb-r has one incurable delusion;
at present a lot of his customers buy tln-ir clothes
and food after 6 p.tn., and if all shops closed at (5,
these people, instead of buying earlier, would do
without food and go to work dressed only in a
sugar-bag.

Mr. 0. J. A. NIELSEN.
A Living Witness of the virtues of the
Axfaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12,1898.
To Herr Rassmussf.n.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.
Parliament House, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Alfaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Alfaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,
E. W. O’SULLIVAN, M.L.A.
Nerves, Liver, and Kidneys Cured.
175 Young-street, Annandale, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having- suffered for some time from a com
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Alfaline Remedies, ana their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the oenefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.
Twenty-Two Years’ Nervousness Cured.
211 Crown-road, Ultimo, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmusse.n.
Dear Sir. Your wonderful Alfaline Vitality Pills com-
pletely cured me of an awful case of nervousness of
twenty-two years’ standing.—Yours very truly,
TOM ATKINS.
Blood Disease Cured.
Sth. Murwillumbah, Jan. 4, ’99.
Herr Rassmussen, Sydney. —Dear Sir, —Having just
finished the course of Alfaline Blood Pills and Alfaline
Liver and Kidney Pills, I have pleasure in stating that
they have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-
though previous to trying them I had fried three different
doctors without effect. For the benefit of those who may
be suffering in a similar manner, and as a proof of my
gratitude, you are perfectly at liberty to publish this short
note in the interest of suffering humanity.—Yours Grate-
fully, THOS. KING. Witness — Frank Gribert.

A Living Example in Newcastle.
TZEHIETIIBTXe] ZP_A_i:CXS IXT CHEST &; SHOUTED IE ZRS
A New Woman with Three Bottles,
MRS. W. MATTHEWS.
(For the “Newcastle Herald.'’)
Mis. William Matthews, who resides in
a pretty little cottage in Elder Street,
Lambton. is a living example of the ethcacy
of C:cmcnts Tome as a representative tried i-
Vino. Some years back she was a terrible
sufferer with liver complaint and indices-
Mon.. Now, for a lady of 61 years of age,
aho is hale and hearty and able to walk
about with freedom instead of beum bur-
dened with pain.
These facts were mentioned in Newcastle,
and a reporter was despatched to enquiro
into the truth of them.
“I shall never forget the beneGt I de-
rived from Clements 'I onic,” was tho lady's
first remark when tho reporter explained
his mission. “ 1 had often felt so bad that
I really thought I could not live many
months, and yet a few days after I com
menccd taking Clements Tonic I felt re-
freslred.” -
“ What were your ailments, Mrs. Mat-
thews ? ” ■
“ I bad many ailments, but 1 fancy liver
troubles and indigestion oeoaaiaued the
most misery at times ; the soreness became
so acute that I could scarcely move about to
do my home work, and 1 always felt tired
the first thing in the morning as well as the
last thing at night/'
“ Did you see any medical men ? ”
Yes.r 'the doctors told me I wanted a
change. They said the sea air was too
strong for me, and suggested that 1 should
go into the country."
“ Did you go ’ ”
“I went to Singleton for a few weeks,
and that climate made me feel better in
comparison, but I never felt as well as 1
did through taking Clements Tonic.”
“ Was your illness of long standing ? ”
“For 3 or 4 years 1 was very bad with
liver trouble and indigestion. 1 used to be
attacked wiLh terrible pains in the chest
and between the shoulders, and at mes I
could scarcely move about. My appetite
seemed to have left me. I bad no desire
for my meals. I used to eat just to keep
up my strength, and what little I did eat
used to cause me great suffering by reason
of the indigestion.”
“Could you obtain any rest at nights?”
“Many and many a weary night 1 have
put in. I have often prayed for daylight
to o*Me, and wkea I got up 1 used to have
that same old tired and languid feeling.
Life was a perfect drudgery to me, nothing
seemed to do me any good. I could not
bear the slightest noise, and the smallest
trifles would have the most distressing
effect upon my nerves. I was down-hearted
beyond expression.”
“ Who suggested Clements Tonic ? ”
“ I think,” added Mrs. Matthews, “ tliat
it was one of my sons. I have one an
engine driver on the railways and another
is a student at the University—or it may
have been a neighbour that suggested it.
At all events I got a bottle, and 1 give all
tho credit to Clements Tonic for the bene-
ficial change that has been brought about in
my system.”
“ How soon lid you experience relief ? ’
enquired the newspaper man.
“ Before I finished the first bottle,” was
the grateful lady’s immediate answer,
“I took three bottles altogether. It
made me feel quite a new* woman. I could
eat and sleep afterwards like a grow'ing
girl, and I had no bad after effects. My
liver seemed to have righted itself, and tho
indigestion pains gradually passed away.
I am seldom troubled with indigestion now
l give all the credit for my cure to Clements
Tonic. I hope I shall never want a few
shillings to buy it, because I regard it as a
woman’s friend.” c
“ Have you any objection to this testi-
mony being published?” enquired the re-
porter, holding up his shorthand notes.
“ You can make what use you like of it,”
replied Mrs. Matthews. “Clements Toni s
has saved my life, and I am not afraid to
own up to it.”

INTIMATE STRANGERS.
Suppose a man to have lived fifty years without
ever having seen the reflection of his own face.
Now lead him before a mirror and let him have a
look. He will, of course, recognise the outlines
and general appearance of his body; but his
features will be as new and strange to him as
those of a person he has never before met. Yet
he has worn that mask all his life; has touched
it with his hands times beyond counting ; has by
means of it expressed the feelings and passions
of half a century; has heard its peculiarities
remarked upon by others —yet. bone of his bone
and flesh of his flesh as it is, the glass presents it
to his gaze as a novelty. Fortunately Nature has
so made us that we are commonly satisfied with
our looks, otherwise this man might curse the
hour he first beheld his own countenance.
On a page of a book which lies on my table this
bright morning is picture which—were it pub-
lished without title or description—probably the
most of us would not understand ; yet the original
is vitally important to every human being. No
mirror throws back its structure to the eye, nor
has the owner ever laid hands on it. Neverthe-
less its name is daily on our lips, and on its faith-
ful performance of duty largely depend our
efficiency and happiness.
Still, people are continually alluding to it in
words of wailing and complaint. They find no
end of fault with it when it goes wrong, and when
it goes right seldom pay it the compliment of
doing good work. “ The way of the world,” you
remind me ; “ alas ! the way of the world. ”
For example here is one who says that in the
early part of 890 she began to suffer from a bad
stomach and indigestion. Now the stomach tries
to be good and not bad. It makes constant and
mighty efforts to accomplish its task and so
furnish the rest of the body with health, strength,
and beauty ; but it often fails dismally, and then
its owner characterises it as a “ bad ” stomach.
Now who or what is accountable ?
Continuing, our correspondent adds : “I had no
relish for food, and after eating I had pain at the
chest and sides. Whatever kind of food I took
nothing agreed with me. I made use of various
medicines in hopes of relief, but none of them did
me any good. At last a neighbour, Mrs. Tyrell,
told me how she had benefitted —having had the
same complaint—by Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and
recommended me to try it. Somewhat encouraged
by what she said, I procured a bottle of this
remedy, and soon found that it relieved me as
nothing else had done. I could eat better, all
food agreed with me, and I felt better every way.
Since that time—now four years ago—l have kept
well, taking an occasional dose of the Syrup when
I seemed to need it. My daughter suffered from
the same trouble, and Mother Seigel’s Syrup had
the like good effect in her case. You are at
liberty to make any use you like of this statement.”
—(Signed) Mrs. Elizabeth Naulty, Forester’s Arms
Inn, 96, Scouringburn, Dundee, July 2nd, 1897.
This lady’s stomach did not become “ bad ” of
“ malice prepense and aforethought, ” as the
lawyers say of certain criminals. The cause lay
in the conditions of her life, her habits of eating,
maybe—with, possibly, inherited weakness.
There are so many things, and combinations of
things, that tend to produce or develop dyspepsia
that it is hard to trace them in individual instances.
The symptoms (or consequences), however, are
more numerous, dangerous, and deceptive than
the uninstructed imagine. It is for this reason
that so great a multitude of alleged “dyspepsia
remedies ” a' e prepared.
But the “bad” stomach having been slow to
abandon duty and strike work, does not respond
to any and all sorts of drugs that may be thrown
hopefully into it. The cure must be exactly
adapted to the disease, and if there is a medicine
which so perfectly meets this requirement as
Mother Seigel’s Syrup the world has not yet heard
of it. The tired and inflamed organ receives it
for the genuine stimulus and healer that it is—
and the “bad ’’stomach is changed back into a
good one.
You now guess what that picture on my table
represents —a machine in your body you will
never see, but which in other'ways you may study
and know more about.

diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons sufler-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.
Head What Medical Men Say About Them .
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged
and restores healthy evacuations in eases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. :- -BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening ; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.

A Woman and a Fly.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She was a sort of experimentalist in emotions, and
■he was lonely. Teaching in the backblocks
sharpens the flirtation-palate of a pretty girl, and
does not decrease her possibilities.
As far as this particular victim went, she had
not meant to go further than an experiment. He
saw things differently.
He w r as only a “cockatoo,” with little brain
beyond “sheep,” and she was rather a clever girl,
with no desire for settling in life at twenty.
What tempted her into mischief was his size—he
was one of those tall, strong, hot-tempered male
animals who always seem to appeal to small
women.
They were returning from a ride one after-
noon at sunset, when the plains were tenderly
tipped with violet and gold. He was thinking
of her ; she was thinking of the other man—in
Sydney.
“ I am not going to fall in love with you.” The
suddenness of the remark aroused her; its
piquancy startled her.
“No?” she queried tentatively. He was
silent.
The girl laughed softly as she hummed, “ No-
body asked you, sir, she said ” ; at the same time
steadying her horse to a walk. The experiment was
promising, she reflected, and she wanted the full
measure of its sensations When you have a fly
on a pin you should watch it wriggle, and enjoy
yourself.
He looked at her suspiciously with an uncom-
fortable idea that she was laughing at him. Very
likely she was : she never took these impression-
able men seriously.
“Pretend you didn’t try?” he suggested. She
shook her little head with sudden gravity. “You
do not understand me—dear 1 ” She said the last
word softly, daringly.
When they reached home, and he was lifting
her from the saddle, he suddenly kissed her.
What came over her that she did not protest ?
She could not understand ; and she was generally
particular in these matters. Besides, she was
curiously cold-blooded, and so never attempted to
lose her self-respect. The man was trembling—
things were getting beyond a joke for him.
A few days after, he called again. She was
very subdued, and more puzzling than ever. She
was lying in a camp-chair on the verandah,
dreamily watching the shadows chasing each other
in and out of the straggling belt of timber in the
distance.
“ Is there any hope for me ? ”
She looked up at him quickly, half-frightened
at the expression on his face.
“For what? ” she said, shrinkingly.
“ Well, you let me kiss you ; you know what
that means ! ” His voice sounded like a threat.
She looked up at him thoughtfully; the tall,
well-knit figure pleased her—one part of her ; but
the narrow forehead and general unpolished look
about him offended the other part of her. “I
don’t see how I could prevent you,” she ventured
audaciously.
He literally gasped “ Why, you never tried.”
“I was too hurt,” said the girl, with a pretty
air of dignity.
His face became absolutely miserable ; and she
became afraid that compassion (a usual and un-
suspected foe with some women) would master her
wisdom. She took a mental leap into the possible
future> S he saw herself his wife and him the
father of her children. ,
Tnat thought saved her. It had been an
interestin;? experiment, and the fly had wriggled
bß:Ul tifully ; but ’tvvas time to kill it. “Good-
bye,” she said.

Circumstantial Evidence.
A FORGOTTEN QUEENSLAND STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was trouble on the station. Three of the
best horses had mysteriously disappeared. From
the tracks, which were followed until lost, it was
evident that they had been driven away by the
thieves—two mounted men. One was a pet cut-
ting-out horse of the manager’s, and a bit of a
racer ; another was a remarkably good easy hack,
needless to say, a pet of everybody’s ; the third a
promising weil-bred colt. It seemed, indeed, that
the thieves knew exactly what horses to pick.
It was debated on the station whether to send
for the police or not, most bushmen having a
rooted belief that one of themselves is worth
two policemen in a matter of this sort. The mana-
ger, thinking that it was the best way of getting,
at any rate, one or two of his horses back, des-
patched a man to the nearest police station, about
35 miles away, to give information.
Dickson, the man sent on this errand, was a
smart young fellow, a good tracker, and one of
those who believed he could run rings round a
policeman. Like many smart young fellows, he
considered himself much cleverer than he really
was.
He reached the so-called township whore the
police station was situated, and delivered his
message. The sub-inspector told him that he
would come out himself with a black trooper, and
Dickson went to the one and only pub, and put up
for the night. He had had just enough whisky to
loosen his tongue, and indiscreetly announced his
errand, which he had been warned to keep dark ;
also, he proclaimed his intention of getting to
windward of the police in a way that should greatly
redound to his own honor and glory.
Next morning he was up betimes. His horse
had been stabled, and he was at the police station
before the sleepy camp-sergeant had fairly rubbed
his eyes open. To him Dickson entrusted a mes-
sage to the effect that “ coming along he had seen
tracks of cattle crossing the ' road, and as
he suspected them to be some outsiders they had
long been looking for, he intended to follow up
the tracks, so he would not accompany the sub-
inspector back to the station, but would he tell
the manager where he had gone to?” The half-
awake camp-sergeant assented, and Dickson
started.
Now, the brilliant idea that had entered the
young fellow’s head was, that he would go and
make an effort by himself to recover the lost trail,
and if he succeeded, why, the police would be out-
witted.
It was not long before he reached the place
where the tracks had been lost, and, after much
casting about and many hours’ work, actually
succeeded in picking them up again, only now
there wore only three tracks, instead of five as
formerly. Also, they had not been travelling'as
fast, and were split up as though they had been
feeding along as they went. They were being
driven, it was evident, but by whom? Fortune
favoured Dickson, who was much elated by his
success. The trail crossed the bed of a somewhat
broad, sandy creek, damp in places, and there the
tracks of a young black-boy, or of agin, were plainly
apparent behind the horses.
It was now well on in the afternoon, but Dickson
never dreamt of turning back ; his horse was still
fresh, and the scent was hot, and, in a couple of
hours' time, he was again rewarded. Before him
he saw a black gin strolling along in the usual cos-
tume of a semi-civilised aboriginal lady, namely,
a Scotch-twill shirt. To “ round her up ” was the
work of a few short minutes, but there were no
horses in sight. To his repeated enquiries as to
the horses, all she would say was, “ Yowi ! yowi,”
and point ahead. He made her understand that
she was to keep up with him, and went slowly
along on the tracks. Suddenly, the gin disap-
peared ; he had looked back but a moment before,
and she was at his horse’s heels; now she was-no
longer to be seen. He looked and hunted in vain
for a glimpse of the twill shirt, but the gin had of
course taken it off and then slipped behind a tree,
and, once behind a fair-sized tree, no iguana in the
world is as smart as a nigger in keeping it between
you and himself, no matter how you dodge.
The gin was gone, and there was nothing left but
to stick tothe horse-tracks, which hedid until dusk.
He had some bread and meat with him, and tea
and sugar, which he had brought in anticipation
of having to camp out. At the first patch of
decent grass he turned his horse out, hobbled with
a stirrup-leather, and after a hasty meal lay down
with his head on his saddle and slept as a tired
man does. At dawn he awoke and looked for his
bridle to go and get his horse. Instead of the
bridle, there hung on the iimb the stirrup-leather
with which he had hobbled his horse overnight.
m ■ c ■. , . , , , ■ , ~
There was nothing for it but to put his saddle
up in a tree and walk to the station to face the
music ; arriving there in a very tired and hungry
condition. 1 he manager and sub-inspector were
still absent, so he concluded to say nothing about
his adventures until they returned, not wishing to
tracking him vainly for some time, he had given it
best and walked home.
In due time the manager and sub-inspector re-
, , i ,i i l a' lit
turned unsuccessful, the tracks having finally been
lost in some rough country beyond where Dickson
had been. Dickson told his tale, and two days
afterwards was arrested on warrant on a charge of
horse stealing.
‘ ‘ ’ . , . . .
1 lie chain of evidence against him was complete
in every way. He had boasted at the pub. about
outwitting the police. He had left a lying mes-
sage about cattle-tracks when it was easily proved
that no cattle-tracks had crossed the road as hie
stated. He had come home with a story about
having been thrown, and afterwards told another
fairy-tale altogether, Moreover, the horses stolen
were the best on the station and had been selected
by someone who knew the place well. There was
no link wanting.
The police theory was that he had gone to warn
his accomplice that the black trackers had been
sent for, and tell him, or them, to clear out
speedily. Against all this Dickson had nothing
to offer bub his simple, unsupported word and
good past.
His committal was a foregone conclusion, as
was his after-conviction on trial. The Judge was
very severe, the well-known Bowen Downs cattle-
stealing case being then fresh in the memory of. the
public. He administered to the prisoner a
lengthened homily on the iniquity of a young
man like him, in a good situation, with every
prospect of getting on, falling into evil courses.
Then he gave him five years. - -
I* l due course Dickson went to St. Helena, and
was there for nearly one year of his sentence
when a deserter from the native police, who had
been looked for for some time, was arrested
travelling with a mob of cattle on their way to
the Northern Territory. The police officer
w .ho recognised and took him, had some sus-
picion that the boy might be Dickson’s miss-
in £ accomplice (as he knew the district well
where the theft had taken place) and questioned
him.. The boy admitted that Dickson had
nothing whatever to do with it, and that
his story was correct. The instigator was a
man known as “Bill the Miner,” and both
he and the ex-trooper knew the horses on the
station well. Bill heard Dickson gasconading in
the pub, and immediately slipped away, saddled-
U P. ar >d made for the place where the horses were
planted, and the gin was sent to watch for Dick-
son an£ l lead him on. She had driven the horses
f° r some distance, in the first instance, over
ground, in order to confuse the tracks.

Melbourne Table Talk obituarises the late
Thomas Suffield :
The death of Thomas Suffield, in Summer Hill, a Sydney
suharl ?- last . re,,, ° ve f 3 ° ne ° f the principals in a
capital crime which has kept New South Wales in a fer-
for over eight years. The case was tried by the
deceased Judire Windeyer, some features of the trial
causing a section of the public dissatisfaction. Suffield
was found guilty and sentenced to ten years imprison-
ment, but those who were merely dissatisfied with the
manner of the trial joined forces with those who main-
tained Suffield innocent, and both succeeded in harassing
four successive Ministers of Justice. Ministers again and
again investigated the new points brought up, but found
there was nothing in them.
And, to be equally logical, about six French Min-
isters of Justice investigated the case in favor of
Dreyfus—Table Talk, run by a Hebrew, howls
loudly over Dreyfus—and found there was nothing
in it. But, as a matter of fact, the N.S.W. Min-
isters didn’t find that there was nothing in
Suffield’s case. They only, being red : tapeists,
decided that there was no precedent for re-opening
the case. They said it was a chose juyie —that the
matter was closed—just as the French Ministers
did in the matter of their Suffield.


In 1871 drowsy Wesfcralia had 51,724 acres
under crop ; in 1881 the area had actually gone up
to 53,353 acres, and by 1891 to 64,209 acres. But in
the next seven years there was aspring to 171,164
acres. It is not satisfactory, though, to find from
the returns under the Industrial Statistics Act
that less than 3000 acres had been added this year.
Bigjohn’s beloved Banbury is not, by the way, in
any sense, the premier spud-raising electorate;
the neighbouring Wellington has 908 acres under
potato crop, while Bunbury’s is a mere patch of
432 acres.
Your Neighbor’s Word.
If your neighbor tells you something, you are more apt to believe it than if it merely
comes to you as a rumor from some far away place—
You know your neighbor and—if you have any doubts—can easily investigate his
statements —
That’s why, in telling you about DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS, we tell
you what your neighbors say about them—
Home endorsements—testimony that can’t be doubted—
Testimony that comes from all over Sydney—the glad rejoicings of men and women
who have suffered all the tortures that come in the wake of kidney disorders and
who have been cured by the wonderful little conqueror of kidney ills. That’s the
sort of guarantee that goes with every box of DOAN S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.
But be sure they are DOAN’S.
Only room for three statements to-day. Hundreds more will follow.
WOOLLOOMOOLOO.
Mr. Joseph Hammon, who carries on busi-
ness as a painter and paper-hanger at No.
56 Stanley-streeb, Woolloomooloo, says:
“At intervals during the past five years I
suffered from kidney disorder. The worst
symptom was an aching back, which became
very painful when I had to stoop down. I
tried belladonna plasters, but they had no
beneficial effect. One day, while in New-
man’s Pharmacy, in King-street, this city, I
procured some of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. I took them faithfully, and they have
done me a world of good. The pain has
left me, and I have not had any further
signs of kidney disturbance. I have re-
commended the pills to many people, as
I have every faith in them myself, and
believe them to be the best kidney remedy
made.”
GLEBE.
Mr. William Greenland is a printer, and
lives at No. 22 Forsyth-street, Glebe. He
says: “For some considerable time I suf-
fered from backache and kidney complaint,
having a heavy aching pain in the small of
my back, just over the kidneys, which
troubled me a good deal. The secretions
were very much disordered, containing a
large amount of sediment. I procured some
of Doan’s Backache Pills, and I now have
pleasure in stating that they did me a great
deal of good, completely removing my
trouble, and putting the kidneys in a healthy
state. Although I had previously tried a
number of other remedies I failed to get any
benefit. I have recommended these pills to
a number of people, some of whom I know
have tried them, and, like myself, have de-
rived great benefit.”
STJSSEX-STREET.
Mr. Rbt. Ryan lives at No. 30D Sussex-
street. He is a married man, and has lived
for some years in the locality. He said:
“ Some 18 months ago my kidneys became
seriously affected, and I was regularly
afflicted with backache. My condition gradu-
ally became worse, and although I tried
several well-known remedies I found it im-
possible to get relief. I obtained some of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at Newnan’s
Pharmacy in King-street, which I have tried
with great success. They have completely
cured the backache and other pains from
which I suffered. It is now 12 months since
I took the pills and I have had no return of
my complaint. I must say these pills are a
splendid remedy for kidney complaints, and
sufferers cannot do better than give them a
trial.”

The Week-Day God.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two Gods there are who rule the World, and
shall rule it evermore ;
Two Gods there are whom, variously, the sons of
men adore ;
And One He is Almighty named in Sabbath
psalmody ;
And One He goes without a name, and a greater
God is He.
The Sabbath-God has temples vast, with domes of
span sublime ;
Their spires arise and pierce the skies, in ev’ry
kind of clime.
To Him the nations of the Earth, in all its seas
and lands,
Bow humble heads, bend humble knees, and lift
imploring hands.
To Him the loud Hosannahs rise the rolling world
around ;
His name in all the tongues of men by day and
night doth sound :
The long processions of his priests in solemn pomp
go by,
Beneath the Gothic minster arch, or arch of
orient sky.
The Week-Day God He needs no shrines, though
many a shrine has He,
In ev’ry mart, in ev’ry heart, wherever man may
be.
He needs no priests his praises high to chant at
night and morn,
For ev’ry man-child is to Him a Priest and Levite
born.
The Sabbath*God beyond the stars dwells silent
and alone;
In awful majesty he sits upon His Great White
Throne.
But the Week-Day God he goe3 abroad amongst
the sons of men,
In kindly way, at feast and fray, and keeps them
in his ken.
He scorns not, with the miser mean, on broken
crusts to dine ;
But chiefly in Amphitryon’s hall He loves to sit at
wine.
For high of heart is He, and wise, and full of
golden grace—
Lust of the Eye and Pride of Life are shining in
his face.
And when to war the nations go, however end
their broils,
The Sabbath-God receives the praise—the Week-
Day God the spoils.
“O Sabbath-God,” the victors cry, “ the triumph
all was Thine ! ”
The gold is by the Week-Day God stored in his
Spandau shrine.
The people call the Sabbath God, All-Merciful
and Wise,
And Just, and Good, and Jealous, on His Throne
above the skies,
But the Week-Day God is tolerant—no jealous
god is He :
He drives in state on Sundays late to join the
psalmody.
The Sabbath-God seems growing old, and slacker
in the hand ;
Though still the rolling anthems rise to Him
from sea and land.
The Week-Day God with humor broad—for very
droll is He—
Gives store of gold to still uphold His Rival’s
Mystery.
The Week-Day God He is the God of travail and
of strife ;
The Week-Day God He is tin- God of all the days
of life.
The Sabbath-God He is the God of fad in 01 eye
and breath— °
Almighty of the Sick-Room -Lord of the Bed of
Death !
Two Gods there are who rule the World and shall
rule it evermore ;
Two Gods there are whom, variously, the sons of
men adore,
And One He is Almighty named in Sabbath
psalmody,
And One He goes without a name, and a greater
God is He.
V.J.D.
Harold Boyd to The Bulletin, from
Newfoundland :
A line from this out-of-the-way place. After exploring
Canada I got here by way of Sydney, Cape Breton,
which meant a railway journey of some 600 miles across
the island—a regular feast of mountain, lake and stream.
The trout in the streams were so plentiful that a pebble
thrown in the water would bring numbers to the surface,
and during wayside waits for engine-water, some of us
were able to hook a few. Newfoundland, long famous for
its cod, is now becoming equally famous for its minerals,
especially iron and copper. I have examined several
copper properties here, showing very fine prospects. The
out-put of Bell Island iron mine is 5001) tons ore daily,
and with the special local facilities for ship-loading they
can stow away 5000 tons in 7 hours. G. R. Reid, an old Aus-
tralian, has lately built a railway here, of which he is the
owner. He also owns 500,000 acres of land—so vou see a
man need not remain in Australia to own the earth.
Newfoundlanders are very proud of their ancient isle,
which became a Crown Colony as far back as 1497 (what
price Captain Cook?); but it is only now they are
waking-up to the mineral and commercial possibilities of
their country.
In 1870 the late Baron Grant promoted in
London companies having an aggregate capital of
.£26,000,000, and made 4£ millions profit out of
them. The deficiency of his first bankruptcy was
.£163,000. Hooley, in ’96, promoted co’s having
a totaljiomina] capital of over 18 millions, made
over £5,000,000 profit on the turnover, and went
insolvent with a deficiency of .£346,000. Grant
built a sumptuous mansion in Park Lane, and
(like Colonel North, Barney Barnato, and Woolf
Joel, all of whom made money in much the same
way and built mansions in the same street in the
zenith of their booming notoriety) never contrived
to live in it. Curiously enough, in each case the
man was finished, financially or otherwise, before
the mansion.

The hot red day was drawing to a close. For
15 weary hours the relentless sun had scorched
the dusty earth. Now, with a final angry glare
of defiant hate, he was slowly sinking behind
the dull, drooping timber that edged the plain.
In the shade of a bark-roofed cowshed a small
boy was leaning listlessly against the broken rails
of a tumbledown stock-yard. No cows to run up
in the evening, now. The Demon Drought had
drained them dry—blood and all!
From a small, bare, hot-looking hut, roofed with
the wretched corrugated iron that in all parts of
the interior glares and shimmers in the everlasting
sun, a man appeared. He was lean and brown
and wiry-looking, the veins standing out on the
backs of his hands like knotted cords ; his bare
arms thin and shrunken. In his eyes was a look
of weary pain. “ Tim !” he called.
The boy did not move. He scarcely seemed to
hear.
“ Tim 1 ” called the man again, and the boy re-
plied. “Come here,” said the man, “I want
you.”
Going up to him, the boy stood in a tired, care-
less attitude, and waited.
“ Where is Roger? ” asked the man,
“ Pokin’ about the cow-yard, pickin up the last
bit o’ packin’ I cadged for him from the hawker
yisterday,” answered the boy.
“Do you think you could ride him to Marlow’s
bv morning? Your mother’s took bad, and, if
Mrs. Marlow can’t come, I’m thinking it’ll be a
bad case.”
The man spoke wearily—hopelessly; but there
was a touch of kindness in his voice. The boy
looked up wistfully at the man’s face, much as a
dog might, when asked to do something beyond
his powers. “I kin try, father,” he answered
slowly. The man turned and walked into the
house: the boy went and caught the horse.
Throwing on the broken-baoked saddle, with one
knee-pad torn off, he led the horse to a fence and
clambered on. As he shoved back the hurdle that
led on to the main road he looked back at the
house. He was thinking of the long, lonely ride
in the eerie darkness of the night. Already the
afterglow had died out of the sky, and the mourn-
ful deadly stillness of the drought-stricken plains
began to weigh heavily. He felt inclined to turn
back, but he thought of his mother, and manfully
faced the road.
At the hut he had left, his mother was thinking
of him. She had noticed the man go out and come
back ; had heard the horse moving, and easily
enough guessed the cause. “ How could you
do it?” she asked the man, as the shuffling
step died away, deadened by the dust. “ I only
aslced him if he’d go,”replied the man, passing his
hand across his brow. “I didn’t press it on him.”
Silence fell.
The boy was riding on slowly ; for, young as he
was, he knew the only chance of reaching his
destination was to let the starved horse take his
time. Back in the hut the man was thinking it
was a good thing Roger had some breeding in
him. He came of the game Grandmaster race ;
he would jog on till he dropped. For a game
rider with a game horse, the attempt was not
altogether hopeless; especially as the rider was
such a featherweight.
Tim travelled on through the darkness. At
every sound a thousand nameless fears rose within
him. Once, when some emus loomed dimly before
him, he felt inclined to turn and race home again.
How ghostly and grotesque they appeared, stalking
slowly through the darkness. Leaning down, he
placed his face against Roger’s neck for com-
panionship. By-and-by the moon rose. On
either side of the road, and away ahead, the
g and bughe(J se^ed to be ßeckoning to
him as they waVP d slowly in the soft, warm night
wind. The summer lightning playing on the
horizon grew dim and indistinct. He wondered
what the time might be. Gradually the moon
climbed the sky and floated calmly amongst the
ling stars . Somehow it looked comforting.
Stiff the old horse jogged on. Tim began to
feel s i ee py. The eeriness of his ride began to
we ar off, and the long, dull continuity of it re-
mained. Every now and then he would waken
with a start from his dozing and wonder where he
was . and lf lfc was nearly daylight yet. Suddenly
he was thoroughly aroused. There was a sound of
hooting and shouting in Ins ears. It wm only the
mo pokes along the almost dry river. Ihe moon
paled slovvly.
At sunrise Tim reached Marlow s. As he rode
U P to house a hard-faced woman appeared on
the verandah. , .
A child tried to crawl out after her and, falling
over the doorstep, began to cry. “ Dash you ! ’
said the woman, turning round angnlv. “ Can’t
you hold your row • What’s your trouble ? ” she
asked, facing back to lim.
‘‘ Mother’s took bad. Father wants you,’ he
said.
“And how am I to get there?” she asked—
“the old man’s away with the horse.”
Tltn stared at her stupidly. “D dif I
know!” he said.
“ Turn you horse out anyway,” she said, with a
bitter smile. “ He’ll get as much to eat here as
he does a t home, I suppose.”
Tim looked round the flat, desolate country,
“ I suppose so,” he assented,
“ Wait a bit,” said the woman ; “I know! The
old man left a bit of feed here. We’ll stick it into
y° ur horse and take him back in the spring-cart,
He £°es in harness, don’t he ? ”
“Yes!” said Tim, “he’ll go.” His eyes
brightened at the thought of a feed for Roger,
R e 3 a first-rate ’un ! ’ he added,
In two hours they started back, with Roger
between the shafts. Tim was sleeping in the
bottom of the spring-cart. The hard-faced woman
was driving ; her puling child by her side,
And this is the way of the bush. Pluck—end-
less pluck—in man and beast; and the grim,
gaunt women risking all and getting little—facing
beat and dust and misery for the sake of love and
friendship ; taking all things as they come, and
fading no one in the hour of need !

PASTEURISED
BUTTER • • •
m.
The same remarks that apply to milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a fine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few, we are
pleased to say, only a few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is “ * '
to know that these are getting- less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only id. per lb. It would pay consumers well to give six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, SBld y©lir orders to US, and we will deliver it at your doors.
rntter such as we have described is app eeiated always, whereas at afternoon teas or tor ordinary use
at any price. The famous “Berry” brand Pasteurised butter can be obtained only from this Company.
