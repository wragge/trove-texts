SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Two recent volumes in Ward, Lock, anc
Bowden’s Colonial Library are Guy Booth K
" Strange Company ” and Outrara Tr
tram’s “Dead Gallant” and “King o
Hearts ” (bound together). The excelle
printing and binding, and the admirab
illustrations of this series, make some of ti
older “ colonial ” libraries look almost mea
by comparison. For there is an evolution :

Tristram is anew historical romancer of ver
creditable calibre, and his two readable tale
perhaps approach as near to Weyman
(among recent writers) facile-princeps qualit
as anything which can readily be quoted.
Two splendid-value books are the collec
tion of weird short stories “Aut Diabolu
aut Nihil” (35., 45.) and Kipling’s “Bar
rack-Room Ballads ’ (35., 4s.) —Just out i
grateful “colonial library ” form.
Here is the dramatic close of Louis Becke’
new book, “ His Native Wife ” (Is. 2d.):
blowly -Barrington opened his eyes and gazec
stupidly around him. A raging thirst and a sounc
of someone sobbing had roused him from hi
death like sleep, and in a faint voice he called fo
water.
1 hank God! ” murmured Helen, and raisin
his head on her arm she placed a young cocoanu
ko his lips.
He drank, and then with a heavy sigh sank bac
on the rolled-up mat that formed his pillow, anc
dosed his eyes again.
She knelt beside him for a few moments wit
her hands clasped tightly together, and then ben
down and kissed him—for the last time.
Then came the sound of crunching grave
outside and the doorway of the house wa
darkened by two figures, but she neither heard no
Sr w them as she sobbed out her heart over the un
conscious man.
“See, Nader, ec thy white husband and the
Christ-woman for whom he hath cast thee off,’
and tfi n the old «oman slipped a knife into the
girl’s hand.
As Nadee sprang forward Helen raised her face
and then the knife flashed and sank deep dowi
into her heart and stilled it for ever.
A wild, shrieking laugh made Kate Trenton
and Jose Herrera spring to their feet, to see a
hideous old woman with long, snow-white hair
standing at the door of the chiefs house ; and the
next moment a young girl, as fair-skinned almost
as Kate hoiself, stepped outside.
Again that awful, screeching laugh rang out,
and the hag took the girl by the hand and led her
tut in full view of the village. Then she spoke.
‘‘.See, O men of LSsap, the red hand of
N T ftd e. Hold thou it up, my wood-dove, and let
;h m see the blood of the Christ-woman who stole
:hy lover from thee with her strong witchcraft.”
And Nadee, with blazing eyes and panting
•osom, held up the bloodied knife.”
, At sunset that night the whale-boat, with Kate
IVenton s head pillowed against her lover’s bosom,
evas fifty miles away ; and Jack Barrington with
i glad cry awoke to find bending over him the
jalm face of his native wife.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Jnnr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it. —Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe, He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,

reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS

opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your ease, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post

IHB ORDER OF THE BATH.
This is an Order of Knighthood, much prized by
people who have a PENCHANT for distinctive
initials and TINSEL decoration. The circum-
stances under which it is conferred are various.
Sometimes its acceptance is involved in “ A
NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS," the
recipient being content to wipe off old scores.
On the other hand, the distinction occasional y
falls to the great and brave, to distinguished
soldiers, colonial Premiers, and wily politicians.
Many a man would give ANY MONEY for the
privilege of C. B. after his name, and there are
authenticated cases of enormous sums having
been paid, in one way or another, when there was
a chance of becoming a 0.8. or a G. 0.8.
LUXURIOUS BATHS
AT LOW PRICES.
Let the bathless, and the inadequately supplied,
listen to our moving tale.
We offer the nicest and most suitable baths for
every purpose, all at prices which, until we took
the matter in hand, were quite unknown in this
city. Here is one that cannot fail to bring us
customers and fame.
MASSIVE CAST-IRON BATH.
White Silicate Enamelled inside, Oak Grained
outside.
This splendid bath is of tapered shape ; that is
to say, it is wider at one end than at the other,
and slopes conveniently. It stands on ornamental
feet, and has a wide roll edge. No disfiguring
wood casing is necessary for fixing, and the bath
is altogether a handsome piece of furniture.
COMPLETE WITH PLUG AND WASHER,
575. 6cl.
The usual price for a similar bath is 85s. We
may add that this bath is manufactured in the
colony, the enamelling process being done at our
own factory. To many who have looked upon a
much higher figure for a bath of this character as
a fair thing, we think this bath, and the price of
it, will prove an interesting revelation.

To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure* and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. . No grea'er leg-

“ In this world we honor—and we rightly
honor—the strong, the successful, and the rich.
We despise the weak, the dependent, and the
poor.”— Walter Besant (lately knighted) in the
Argus.
The young Duke of Marlborough, like his
shady father and pugnacious uncle Randolph, has
captured a rich ’Murkan wife—Miss Vanderbilt,
the most gilded girl in the market (dowry,
£2,000,000). The bridegroom is to have a
£600,000 settlement. Love of money runs in the
blood. The original Malbrook, who plundered
the public exchequer in his prime, was a notorious
sponger upon the ladies in his early days.
The recent Melb. bench-packing allega-
tions recall the old story -of the Queenslander
charged with “ illegally using,” who got a few
friends on the bench and then pleaded shortness
of sight, unable to see brands. Discharged with-
out a stain on his character. And, to prove that
the verdict was genuine, he immediately after-
wards for a wager wrote the Lord’s Prayer on a
sixpence.
The Bulletin committed the wickedest
error any journal can be guilty of when it described
Miss Jennings-Oarrnichael as the original Vic-
torian girl to obtain a trained nurse’s certificate.
That misstatement touches the lady’s age very
deeply. Even a poetess, amidst her strivings after
an immortal fame, retains a sweet, womanly objec-
tion to seeming about 20 years older than her birth
certificate. Miss Carmichael was not the first of
Victorian trained nurses, but the first pupil to
take a certificate from the nurses’ training-school
at the Children’s Hospital, Melb. This explana-
tion should enable the bardess’s devoted admirers
to breathe again.
The branches at 283 George-street, Sydney,
and 586 Collins-street, Melbourne, of the Silverton
(Eng.) India-rubber, Gutta-percha and Telegraph
Works Co., worthily represent a world-famous
institution. This co., besides being the boss-
manufacturer of all rubber goods, is, perhaps,
the largest submarine cable manufacturer and
layer extant—its fleet of steamers has a carrying
capacity of 12,000 tons. The co’s Silverton works
cover 15 acres; employ 3000 hands ashore and
400 afloat; pay <£loo,ooo annually in wages alone;
use 2000 incandescent lights in their works ; pro-
duce 1,250,0001 b. of rubber goods per annum. The
co. is prepared not only to supply Australia with
all the rubber goods she demands, but to teach
her that there are other rubber goods which srie
should have—for instance, how sadly the bushrnan
wants educating who prefers rheumatism to the
co’s ground sheet 1 Sporting requisites include
tennis balls and shoes, cricketing shoes and pads ;
fishing stockings and. trousers; billiard cushions.
Druggists’sundries are waterproof sheeting, rubber
bandages, air and water-beds and pillows. Cloth-
ing takes in rubber boots, shoes, waterproof
collars, cuffs, overcoats, ponchos, capes, coatings,
ladies’ cloaks, etc. There are door springs, door
stops, carriage-springs’ bumpers, wringers’ and
mangles’ rubber-covered rollers, railway-truck
buffers, rock and brick drill machines’ buffers.
There are also wires for electric lighting, torpedo
apparatus, a Pacific cable, canvas and rubber
belting.*
A curious problem is suggested by the cir-
cumstances connected with the suicide of the late
Constable M'Phee, of Cranbourne (Vic.). It was
stated at the inquest that he had, when a young
man, been thrown from his horse, sustaining a
fracture of the skull from which he had suffered
internally ever since. The coroner’s jury, taking
these facts into consideration, found that deceased
shot himself in a fit of temporary insanity which
they believed to be the result of said injury.
Problem : If, instead of killing himself, a man
whose brain was fractured 15 or 16 years before,
but who during many of those years was con-
sidered to be sufficiently sane and responsible to
be a policeman, killed somebody else —what view
would gaol-doctors take of his action, and what
would be the verdict of a jury (not necessarily
charged by Judge ) empanelled to try him
on a charge of murder ? Eor, after all, it is a
mere toss-up whether homicidal mania ends in
murder, or suicide, or both.
In Sydney D.T. office lately Mr. Frank
J. Bevan put up an Australian record on the
linotype machine. In 15min,, under the stop-
watch, Bevan set up 78 lines of solid nonpareil
matter, without lead or rule, or headline of any
kind, amounting to 4056 ens. This performance,
which equals 16,224 ens per hour, is, remarks the
Telegraph, all the more remarkable when it is
remembered that Mr. Bevan has had less than six
months’continn.; i-notice as an operator. The
previous record « .. .fe by Mr. Philip Balls, an
American exp i came to Australia to take
charge of th,- b ■ *at the office of the Mel-
bourne Eveni.n \.ld, and who, on his arrival
in Sydney, on June 18 last (when just off a long
sea-voyage and with a machine new to him), set
up in the Telegraph office 67 lines of solid non-
pareil in the same time, viz., 15min., equal to
13,936 ens per hour.
The old Hobart firm of A. M'Gregor and
Co. has been wound up. Largely identified
with shipping and mercantile pursuits, the name
of Alick M'Gregor, who for years was one of the
representatives for Hobart in the Leg, Council,
was widely-known. Besides owning a number of
whalers, of which only two remain fit for active
service, the firm had several clippers engaged in
the London-Hobart trade, and some smart inter-
provincial tenders—the now Sydney-owned Loon-
gana, a handsome craft, being one of the last built
for them. During the last year or two they have
disposed of most of their fleet, and the last of
their “deep water” ships, the trim Harriet
M'Gregor, passed into Danish hands recently in
London. The selling of these ships has been a
decided loss to the port of Hobart. Advancing
years and declining health have caused “old
Alick ” to relinquish business and retire to his
superb mansion at Battery Point, which, com-
manding a view of the city and harbor, is often
mistaken by strangers for Govt. House.

66 Yankee Boodle Mended with Polities .
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “ Y ANKEE DOODLE ” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford tc
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands“CON-
QUEROR,” “ SIR ROGER,” “ CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE’
ranks supreme.

The Dean Case—Revised Version.
The confessions made within the last few
days by George Dean, by his solicitor
(Meagher), and by Smith, the North Shore
chemist—in short, the confessions made
almost simultaneously by almost everybody
directly or indirectly connected with the
famous Sydney poisoning-case—have sud-
denly cleared up one of the most mysterious
criminal problems of this decade, and ruined
the Dean fetish beyond all redemption.
The confessions which will probably be made
by one or two other persons as soon as the
police can find them are likely to supply the
few details that are still wanting. And
after its manner in such cases, the great,
illogical public which, a few weeks ago, was
in a state cf unreasoning adoration of Dean
—such unreasoning adoration that it would
probably have put him in Parliament if it
had had the chance, and actually did put his
blatherskiting solicitor there, by way of
honoring Dean at second-hand—has now
rushed bo the opposite extreme. It is pre-
pared now to “ canonise ” Dean’s much-
wrungod wife, whom it hated and loathed a
little while ago, despite the fact that no
direct evidence had ever appeared against
her, any more than it had then appeared
against Dean himself. A section of it
is almost even prepared to canonise his
mother-in-law, who still stands out con-
spicuously as a most unfit person for such a
purpose, and is also prepared to canonise
Judge Windeyer, whose method of con-
ducting the trial was the principal cause
of the after-trouble. And for the mo-
ment it has almost unanimously decided
that interference with any legal sentence
is a mistake. In short, it is in such
a mood that for the next few months it will
be prepared bo acquiesce in the hanging of
anybody on almost any evidence, no matter
by what unfairness the verdict is obtained.
The general decision of the press is that
Judge Windeyer s impartiality and legal
acumen have been fully vindicated. And in
the midst of this popular frenzy it is worth
while to point out that the original trial of
D. an is just as unfair, as lopsided, as unjust
and as utterly unjustifir*' 1 - now as it was
five or six months ago. Of all the execra-
tions which The Bulletin heaped on that
famous burlesoue it takes back not one word,
and all the recent revelations do not alter the
situation as it was last April in the least,
* * •
When Dean was originally convicted no
one had seen him poisoning his victim ; no
one had found him in possession of any
poison ; and no one brought forward a
scintilla of evidence to show that accused had
ever obtained poison from any source what-
ever. There was no motive, or shadow of a
motive, alleged to show why he should want
to get rid of his wife. Despite most
strenuous efforts to drag her in, the cus-
tomary “other woman” never appeared in
the case ; no one attempted to prove that
the prisoner was jealous of Mrs. Dean, or
had any cause to be jealous of her,
or had anything to gain by her death.
The medical evidence, as understood by
the jury and narrated by the reporters,
was absurdly and hopelessly contradic-
tory. It tended to show, in the first
place, that Mrs. Dean had taken enough
poison to kill half-a-dozen women. Then
being confronted with the difficulty of
explaining how a woman who was fatally
poisoned six times over, didn’t die, or even
come within measurable distance of death,
the Attorney-General took refuge in the
glaringly absurd assertion that the two
poisons administered were antidotes to each
other. That ridiculously inaccurate state-
ment remains still as an ugly blot on the
acumen of the prosecution ; it helped to
bring a guilty man within a short distance
of the gallows, and it might quite as readily
have brought an innocent man there instead.
Even Mrs. Dean did not assert directly that
she saw her husband putting poison into her
food and drink ; she merely detailed certain
suspicious movements on his part. Her evi-
dence was corroborated to an appreciable
extent by her mother only, and even her
corroboration was limited; moreover, it pre-
sently transpired that, instead of being the
spotless person which the police (notwith-
standing their knowledge to the contrary)
tacitly represented her to be, Mrs. Seymour
was a lady whose long and dismally ugly past
made her testimony a thing to bo received
with much reservation.
The evidence which was then before the
court was not sufficient to justify any Judge
or any jury in regarding Dean’s guilt as
legally proved. In fact, there was no proof
at all, in the legal sense of the term. Yet
Judge Windeyer summed up strongly against
the prisoner, and declared, almost in so
many words, that his guilt was a certainty.
Also, when even his very “straight” sum-
ming-up failed to bring the jury to a decision,
he took extraordinary means to drive it
to the conclusion at which he obviously had
himself arrived. He sent for the jurymen,
who were supposed to come to an absolutely
independent opinion, uninfluenced by any-
thing outside the evidence, on a matter of life
or death, and expressed his astonishment
that they should hesitate at all on so simple
and obvious a matter. He told them that
they had a painful duty to perform, and, as
the acquittal of an innocent man is not in
any sense a painful duty, this certainly
implied that the duty in question was to con-
vict the prisoner. He pointed out to them
that they might recommend Dean to mercy,
(mercy for Dean, who, if guilty, had cold-
bloodedly poisoned his wife in childbirth !)
and, as a recommendation to mercy can only
attach to a verdict of “guilty,” this was
another definite intimation as to the kind of
verdict it was their duty to bring in. He
denounced the theory of the defence as
“ monstrous,” and he intimated to the jury-
men that unless they came to a prompt
decision—in other words, unless they left off
weighing the evidence and hurried to a con-
clusion —they would necessarily be locked
up till Monday morning, it being then late
on the evening of Saturday. Under, or at
any rate after, all this pressure, the jury,
which had then disagreed for over seven
hours, arrived at exactly the sort of verdict
which the Judge had so distinctly suggested,
and did so in the short space of seven
minutes.
# • *
The people who were responsible for the
memorable agitation which followed were :
(I) The police, who failed utterly to trace the
sale of poison to Dean ; (2) the Crown
lawyers who, according to Julian Salomons,
failed so Utterly in the same direction that
the witness Smith was never even asked
whether he had sold the poison ; (3) the
Crown lawyers again who put forward Mrs.
Seymour as a reputable witness, whereas the
public presently learned things concerning
her which seriously injured her apparent
credibility ; (4) Attorney-General Want in
particular, who tilled in an obvious gap in
the medical evidence by adopting a theory
that was wholly untenable, and which
should have at once struck any man
with any experience of legal-medical
questions as untenable ; (5) and, above
all, Judge vWindeyer, whose method
of bringing pressure on the jury roused an
almost unanimous howl throughout the
press, and led even the usually placid and
always law-abiding Argus to draw a parallel
between his remarks and those of Judge
Jeffreys when he drove a jury to an unjust
verdict in the case of Alice Lisle. All the
confessions and revelations which have
transpired since cannot alter the situation as
it was then. Judge Windeyer had no pro-
phetic knowledge of vvht.'> was to be revealed
a few months later. All he had to go upon
was the evidence as it stood last April, and
on that evidence the verdict of “guilty”
was wholly unjustifiable. The fact that Mr.
Windeyer arrived by the wrong road at the
right conclusion does not prove his accur-
acy or reliability of judgment by one
iota. He arrived at the same conclusion
in the Mount Rennie case, and there is the
very strongest reason for believing him to
have been wrong in essential particulars.
He arrived at the same conclusion in the
Butler case, and he was undoubtedly
wrong. He arrived again at his too
frequent conclusion in the Dean case, and
he was right—as it happens. In every case
there are necessarily only two possible
alternatives guilt or innocence. The
man who backs one alternative out
of a possible two must be right sometimes.
The man who tips one horse out s of a
possible two, or who always prophesies
rain in a climate where it rains three days in
the week, or who tries persistently to pick
the higher of two cards, must win now and
then, but because he wins he doesn’t neces-
sarily show foresight or legal acumen or im-
partiality, or any other notable quality.
• • •
Moreover, Judge Windeyer, even apart
from his remarkable conduct at the trial,
was the principal cause of the agitation, by
the fact that he was Judge Windeyer. The
public had—and will have again when the
present feeling has died away —an instinctive
distrust of the Mount Rennie Judge and his
methods of conducting criminal trials. Had
any other Justice on the N.S.W. Bench ob-
tained or recorded the same verdict, even on
the same miserably insufficient evidence, and
expressed his conviction after—not before—
the jury’s decision that the verdict was a
just one, George Dean would very likely
have been hanged and forgotten long ago.
In Mr. Windeyer’s case, under the same
circumstances, such a thing was impossible.
The public had come to regard him as a per-
sonage whose idiosyncracy it was to enforce
his own views of a case upon the jury, and
it acted accordingly. It was, and still is,
fully justified in its action. All that has
since transpired does not alter by one single
fraction the fact that if George Dean had
been hanged or imprisoned on the evidence
as it was then, or on a verdict obtained
under the circumstances that characterised
the Dean verdict, it would have been
a blot on civilisation. The medical tes-
timony on which the prosecution relied was
scouted by the two expert doctors, F. Norton
Manning and Sydney Jones, who were ap-
pointed to the Commission on the ground
that they were among the most eminent and
experienced members of their profession in
Sydney. And even the third Commissioner,
Rogers, Q.C., who sent in an adverse
report, did not venture to assert that the
evidence was satisfactory. He merely stated,
as the sole reason for his verdict, his
childishly unsophisticated belief that a
young woman just on the threshold of
life could not have poisoned herself—and
as a third party might, on the evidence
then available, have been the real criminal,
or there might have been no criminal at all,
this impotent statement was wholly irrele-
vant. If the methods of the Dean trial are
allowed to continue because in that case the
right man was found guilty by accident, then
almost anybody may be found guilty of
almost anything, and the law cannot always
strike the right man by accident.
* * •
It has been a frequent assertion, within
the last few days, that a foul imputation has
been removed from the administration
of justice in New South Wales. Another
frequent assertion is that the evils of trial
by public sentiment have been fully exposed.
Both statements are utterly false and foolish
and illogical. The foul imputation upon the
administration of justice is that Dean was
found guilty of poisoning when no poison
had been traced to his possession ; when no
one had seen him administer the poison ;
when the medical evidence, as recorded in
the Judge’s notes, was wholly impossible
and was bolstered up by a ridiculous mis-
statement on the part of the prosecution ;
and when the jury gave its verdict under
extreme pressure from the presiding Judge,
instead of being left to form its own un-
biassed conclusions. The further imputations
are that the police (as in regard to Mrs.
Seymour) suppress evidence calculated to tell
in favor of the accused ; and the law spends
immense sums and puts all its machinery
in motion to hunt out facts against the
prisoner and present them in the most con-
vincing shape to the jury, while it furnishes
no machinery at all to dig up facts telling in
his favor. Therefore, only a wealthy sus-
pect who can hire enormously expensive
legal and professional aid ever gets a fair
trial —except by accident. These foul im-
putations remain exactly as they were. The
law in the present instance merely occupies
the position of a man who fired his gun
wildly into a mob and hit somebody, who
was proved long afterwards to have deserved
all that happened to him. But it is also
on record that by the same process the law
has hit the wrong person on previous
occasions, and if it continues the same
promiscuous method it will certainly do
so again. As regards the other assertion,
trial by public sentiment is the only thing
connected with the Dean case that has not
been more or less discredited by that
disastrous affair. Thanks to it, the law has
been saved from the final disgrace of com-
mitting what, on the evidence that existed
last April, would have been nothing short of
State murder. The reputation of the detec-
tive force has been considerably damaged by
the wonderful number of things it failed to
discover at the right time. The Crown Law
Department has not improved its character
by the way it filled one gap, at all events,
in the evidence. The Bench has lost
caste woefully by its method of conducting the
case. The miserable weakness of the defence
at the trial has served as a reflection on the
whole system of Botany Bay alleged justice,
which hires the best legal talent in the
country to present one side of the case, and
leaves the other side to be supported by a
young solicitor working often from tnei’e
motives of charity, tempered by a consuming
desire to get into Parliament and listen to
the wagging of his awn jaw. But trial by
public sentiment has proved itself patient,
equitable, reasonably intelligent, and wholly
honest from first to last, and that is as much
as can be expected of any court in this
world.
Trial by Fad.
The other day a well-advertised N.S. W. Judge
was reported to have said that he “knew”
a certain witness was lying “ because he
shuffled his feet ! ” A trenchant and timely
commentary upon that preposterous criterion
of credibility now comes to hand in the fact
that assassin Dean’s demeanour, under all the
long-drawn dubiety of his chances, remained
consistently that of a man sustained by the
consciousness of innocence. To the very last,
Dean looked at the world with an unflinching
eye. When on his ferry steamer he saw a man
who had acted the friend to him, he went and
placed in that friend’s palm, in token of Grati-
tude, the big, horny, honest hand with which
he had put the arsenic into Mrs. Dean’s lemon-
syrup.

Mankind, as Le Sage observed, is prone to
imagine it sees what it has expected to see, and
the chances are that 99 persons out of 100 will,
in the case of a suspected murderer, translate
into unmistakable indications of criminality
the self-same physiognomical peculiarities which
would speak to them, in the case of a “just
man made perfect,” only the language of
benevolence and brotherly love. “ Once accuse
a man of a crime,” said Dalley at the trial of
Scott, the Sussex-street murderer, “and people
will be ready to believe him guilty. Place the
most honest and pleasing face behind these
rails, and it at once becomes a face that ex-
presses every passion.” This, unfortunately, is
as inevitable as it is that the “ fluke ” —for it
was no more—of the Judge in the Dean case*
will, to a miserable certainty, incline the Sheep
of the community to dangerous reliance upon
mere “beliefs” of a man who, though he is,
doubtless in strict accordance with the nature
of things, is, as an administrator of justice,
most palpably at variance with the fitness of
them.

A Judge, like other people, must have his
discriminatory capacity estimated not so much
by its exercise within accustomed technical
lines as by the cogency with which it is applied
to questions more or less outside those lines.
But a Judge—as people are too apt to forget—
is but a picturesquely-upholstered and not
always very distinguished law yer, and the con-
tinued practice of the legal profession, according
to more than one psychological authority, has a
distinctly deteriorating effect upon the “power,”
as Lewes puts it, “of estimating general prob-
ability, as distinguished from forensic.” The
lawyer, in a word —like the parson —keeps get-
ting into that ratiocinative rut out of which it
is the tendency of the remaining learned profes-
sion to keep constantly forcing its exercisers.
In which not-sufficiently-observed circumstance
lies the explanation of the facts that a man
who, within the judicial atmosphere, enjoys
reasonable logical heal Lb may become a hopeless
dialectic wreck the moment he gets outside it.
The distinguished legal minority of the Dean
Commission was unable—or said so—to accept
the theory in which his medical colleagues saw
nothing at all incompatible with a very ordinary
experience. “Medical jurisprudence,” wrote
Maudesley, “ would be a much more efficient
factor in the determination of verdicts if the
average lawyer didn’t labor under the delusion
that he is, ips6 factd, a better reasoner than the
average doctor.”
m * •
The lawyer, at all events, has, for so far,
failed to discover the futility of generalisations
from the outer man about the inner. Physiog-
nomy, demeanor —the externality, generally, of
an accused person —must, perforce, produce an
impression one way or other, but, to demon-
strate the dangerous absurdity of making that
impression a conviction, it is only necessary to
remember that a quarter-inch black chin-stubble
would make Bum Sikes of the Angel Gabriel,
or to weirdly conjure up the collocation, behind
the spikes, of three of N.S. Wales’ best-known
and most reputable lawyers—unwashed, un- 1
shaven and arraigned for the attempted murder
of, say, one W. P. Crick. What a wealth of
physiognomical acumen would come to light
about —distributively—the “ cruel, remorseless
mouth,” and the “ ferociously glaring eye,”
and the “ cunning little monkey-grin ! ” But
Lombroso —probably the most accomplished
anthropologist living—focusses the whole ques-
tion to admiration in a single sentence.
“ Physiognomical and physiological phenomena
unquestionably Speak a language which may
hereafter be found perfectly coherent and
intelligible, but there is at present some
danger that an imperfect acquaintance with
even its alphabet may ccurtribute to miscarriage
of justice by the punishment of the innocent.”
Which utterance of a man who has done much
to disentangle criminological issues The Bul-
letin heartily commends to the consideration
of a profession that has done a good deal more
to confuse them.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Vic. Coal Question.
The Victorian Government coal-contract situa-
tion is practically this : Two years ago the
Newcastle companies supplied the Victorian
railways with coal at 14s. sd. per ton. A year
ago, when the Gippsland supply began to com-
pete strongly with the imported article, the
price was reduced to 12s. Now it is offered at
11s. delivered in Melbourne—for one year
only, so presumably this price represents a
desperate effort to swamp the Victorian
mine - owners. Meanwhile, the Outtrim
Co., whose coal seems, so far, the only kind
produced in Victoria—except perhaps that of
the Jumbunna mine—which is fully equal to the
Newcastle article, offers to supply at 9s. fid. at
the mine. This, after paying haulage, will pro-
bably amount to 12s. 3d. per ton at Melbourne.
The difference is considered well spent, partly
because the local supply will furnish employ-
ment to some hundreds of families ; partly
because Govt, can enforce the minimum-wage
clause, which it cannot do in the Newcastle
mines; partly because the new arrangement
will prevent nearly £lOO,OOO leaving the pro-
vince annually ; and partly because it is owing
in the main to Victorian competition that the
Government has escaped from the heavy exac-
tions of the N.S.W. exporters, therefore it
is to its interest to encourage that competi-
tion. Further, the £lOO,OOO a year spent
in Victoria will be liable to income-tax,
while the same amount spent in New
South Wales yielded nothing at all. The
springing up of new •coalmining towns
will create property that will yield taxation
revenue to the shire treasuries. It will increase
the value of land in the vicinity, and thereby
further increase the revenue. It will yield
a small income in stamps on the receipts for
dividends and salaries, and on letters in con-
nection with the business. As coal mining is a
thirsty business the Government, by encourag-
ing it, will help along the drink revenue. When
the shareholder dies, after accumulating a pile
out of his dividends, the Government will get
at him for probate and legacy duty, whereas it
can’t get at the Newcastle shareholder who is
out of its jurisdiction. It will also take small
bits out of that annual £lOO,OOO in a dozen
other ways by direct and indirect taxation,
from the tobacco and dog taxes down to the
licence-fee for the inevitable new pub. where
the new coal-miner quenches his thirst. The
establishment of a big local industry is a thing
of many aspects, and the odd Is. 3d. or a little
less per ton is about the smallest of them.
Civil Service Reform.
The N.S.W. Civil Service Reform Bill, intro-
duced by Premier Reid, is a measure which
may do a lot of good, even though it does not
produce quite all that is expected of it. The
main feature of the scheme is that it establishes
the principle of appointment and promotion by
competitive examination instead of appointment
and promotion by having an uncle in Parlia-
ment, as hitherto. It also classifies the Service
into different grades, with a maximum salary
in each grade, so that unless the civil-servant
can climb into another grade by passing the
requisite examination, influence will, or ought
to be, powerless to help him along beyond a
certain limit. The Service is to be under the
control of three commissioners, and if the three
are strong enough to resist political pressure,
there should be very little of the old corruption
left. Probably a new variety of corruption will
spring up by-and-bye instead of the old sort;
but that must be a matter for future considera-
tion. For the time, at all events, there should
be rather less glaring corruption than hitherto,
and the habit of appointing Maloney should be
hardly so prevalent as it has been. If the new
system is honestly conducted, it should remove
the greatest difficulty in the way of retrench-
ment—the necessity of not sacking any friend,
or relative, or influential constituent, of any out
of the 125 M’s.P. under pain of that mem-
ber’s lasting animosity, as the Commis-
sioners will be, to a great extent, beyond
the reach of any member’s animosity. If
it is conducted with only a moderate amount
of dishonesty, it will mean that the province
will have to find billets for the friends (rela-
tives are barred) of the three Commissioners,
instead of for those of 125 politicians, so that
there will be a distinct gain. And if it is con-
ducted very dishonestly indeed, it will probably
mean that the member for Smith’s Curse will
live on the Commissioners’ door-mat instead of
on that of the Ministry, and that the young
man with influence will generally get through
his examination, when the equally unintelligent
young man without influence won’t, and that
the former will rise to the maximum
salary in his grade a good deal faster
than the other fellow. Meanwhile, nothing in
particular is done with the great problem —that
of the bankrupt Superannuation Fund. All
new appointees, instead of contributing to the
fund, are to insure their lives, but though this
is to be compulsory the Government doesn’t
propose to start a State Life Insurance Depart-
ment, so as to guarantee that the civil
servant whom it has compelled to pay
premiums all his life won’t be left in the
lurch by a “ busted ” office when he dies.
Also, sundry new regulations have been made
concerning the Fund, but nothing is done to
alleviate the awful fact that the said Fund is
burst-up aud hopelessly insolvent, and wants
£2,000,000 or £3,000,000 to put it straight
again. Premier Reid, however, promises that
he will look into this difficulty in a month or
two, or R«xt year, or in 1906, or some time.
The Four Sexes.
The lamentable balderdash talked by the
W.C.T.U. about the moral inferiority of the
“ other sex ” is based mostly upon an obstinate
blindness to the utter futility of quarrelling
with Man because he isn’t Woman ! Which is
precisely why he never could and never can
conform to the old-hen standard of conduct set
up for him by every cheap female apostle who
has cackled herself into confounding a mere
vulgar itch for meddling with a Heaven-
sent mission for the moral regeneration of
the universe. Such a silly sisterhood of
faddists as the W.O.T.U. is only possible
as a morbid product of that civilisation, the
history of which is mainly the history of the
man—not of the sub-feminine anomaly M'ho
is as sexually uncharacteristic as the sub-
masculine woman who makes an ideal of
him—but of the red-blooded, robust fellow
whose vital energy brings him, at every turn,
into conflict with some small conventional
morality or other. It is the male man,
in short—with all the male man’s inci-
dental “ wickedness ” who has, up to date,
run the world and the woman and the
woman-man, and who will probably be found
in charge of that little contract long after
the man-woman has discovered that the only
he who has ever taken her seriously is the he
who ought properly to have been a she, and
who, by acknowledging woman as his equal,
has become, ipso facto, her inferior. But it is
the type—not the aberration—that “goes,”
and it is but the atypical woman who—because
she is atypical—turns herself into a miserable
travesty of man, and succeeds to admiration in
confuting her own contention that Nature has
foregone in her favor the otherwise universal
law of the subordination of the female. And,
not of her, but of the womanly woman who
beholds her antics with astonishment, are, for
the most part, born the men whose vital
activity and intellectual vigor are the dominant
factors in the progress of the race.
The Damp Judge.
The following telegram, printed last Saturday
by Sydney Daily Telegraph, will, in the
opinion of level-headed people, constitute one
of the deadliest stabs inflicted on the dignity
of N.S.W. Supreme Court since the memorable
evening when a puisne Judge solemnly patron-
ised a bogus spiritualistic stance and was more
or less taken in by the chocolate-eating spooks
of “ Cissie ” and “Josephine ” :
MR. JUSTICE WINDEYER IN ADELAIDE.
EULOGISED BY A CLERGYMAN.
THE JUDGE MOVED TO TEARS.
SPEECH BY THE REV. JOHN WATSFORD.
A REMARKABLE AND PATHETIC SCENE.
Adelaidb, Friday.—There was a deeply interesting and
pathetic scene at Government House, Adelaide, to-day,
when his Excellency the Lieut.-Governor entertained at
lunch a small party of clergymen, who had met to
take formal leave of a brother cleric before his de-
parture for Melbourne. Among the guests was
Mr. Justice Windbybr, of New South Wales, who
is passing through Adelaide on his way to Broken
Hill. Sir William Windbybr found himself in sym-
pathetic company, as it was evident that the clergymen
present had watched the tragic course of George Dean’s
trial with keen interest, and that their sympathies were
witli the much-abused Judge.
It was hardly possible that the gentlemen round him
could avoid referring to the events that are the common
talk of Australia. The Rev. W. H. Fitciiett was the first
to give expression to the prevailing felling. He referred
to the presence of Sir William, and congratulated him
upon the complete change in the public feeling towards
him, which had now taken place. He who had been so
abused and vilified was now shown to he in the right, and
the man whom he had sentenced had proved himself after
all an even greater villain than was first supposed.
Eye-witnesses aver that Mr. Justice Windbybr was
moved to tears at these kindly references. When the
time came for him to respond, he completely broke down.
For weeks past, he said, his back had been against the
wall ; the current of public feeling had been adverse to
him; and he had b°en represented as unjust and cruel.
But through it all he had been sustained by a conscious-
ness of his own integrity'. Now that the reaction had set
in, the kind expressions which poured in upon him were
more than he could well bear.
The Judge’s utterance was choked with sobs, and there
was not one present hut was deeply moved. “ The stern
and cruel Judge” of popular estimation was after all
shown to be a man of deep and tender feeling, and as
grateful for the approval of his fellows as others. The
pathos of the scene was increased when the patriarchal
Rev. John Watsford, who was born in Parramatta nearly
80 years ago, referred to Mr. Justice Windeybr’s father,
whom he had known in other days as a man of sterling
integrity and commanding power, who could control
audiences as few others could. Other things were said,
which those who were present decline to repeat, as being
too sacred for the public eye ; but the whole scene is des-
cribed as one which could never b° forgotten.
Before the party broke up the Rev. John Watsford had
all present down on their knees, and gave God thanks for
the past, and invoked the Divine blessings on all, and
especially on the one whose recent experiences had been
so hard lo bear.
It is indeed “pathetic” to find a Supreme
Court Judge reported as having wept with
emotion at a parsons’ lunch-party. His Honor’s
dampness is described as proving him to be “a
man of deep and tender feeling.” Judge Win-
deyeb may be a man of deep and tender feel-
ing, but his recent alleged sloppy aspect doesn’t
prove it by any means. Tears are not neces-
sarily an evidence of “ feeling; ” they often
arise through gratified vanity, male hysteria,
and other causes.
Even before “’Possum” Dean had come
tumbling down his tree of innocence, Melb.
Age (“narked,” no doubt, at the lead assumed
by the hated Argus in denouncing the iniquity
of the trial) joined in the reactionary hymn of
praise to the wigged oracle. “The judicial
acumen and impartiality of Judge Windeyer
is re-established. . . . The Sydney public
will have time to reflect how completely it has
been taken in, and the result will probably be
that Mr. Justice Windeyer will take Dean’s
place in its regard,” sang the Age. Can that
time-serving newspaper show cause why proof
of Dean’s guilt, long after his trial, should be
held to justify Judge Windeyer’s assertion of
Dean’s guilt upon unsatisfactory evidence ?
The black facts of the case, as now revealed,
make very indifferent whitewash for the facts
of the trial. George Dean’s innocence seemed
quite probable at a time when Judge Windeyer
was as sure he was guilty as if he had actually
seen him poisoning his wife. The Sydney
public protested against the Judge’s cocksure-
ness. If the public assumed the certainty of
Dean’s innocence on the absolute certainty that
he didn’t get a fair trial, then Dean’s place in
that soft-headed public’s regard is a suitable
position for Judge Windeyer to occupy. Let
the people who dedicated ballads to Dean
cudgel their brains anew on Judge Windeyer’s
behalf.
Melbourne Punch quotes some examples of
-the salaries paid to Anglican parsons in the
Victorian country districts. One reverend and
hungry wretch gets £B9 a year without a house,
has a large district which necessitates keeping
two horses or cruelly overworking one, anil
three congregations to preach to. Another has
£lO7 a year, no house, four congregations, and
one horse to keep. A third starveling has ten
congregations to attend to and £ll3 a year.
Other salaries are £BO (three congregations) ;
£B9 (four congregations, no residence, one
horse to keep); £ll4 (24 alleged congregations,
no residence, three horses to keep), and so on.
There appear to be a very large number of cases
like these, which are merely a few typical in-
stances. The Victorian Christians let these ini-
quities go on, and take very little apparent in-
terest in the feeble efforts now and then made
to furnish the parson with a living wage, and
yet put up £5OOO a year amid great enthusiasm
for Chinese missions. Consequently, The Bul-
letin is more and more convinced that the
Chinese mission enthusiasm arises solely from
the fact that the Chow is remote and mysterious
and more or less picturesque and the owner of a
pig-tail; and that if he wasn’t all these things
he might die and go to Gehenna without any-
one caring much about him. In other words,
the Chinese mission enthusiasm, and the Soudan
contingent, and the small boy’s desire to be a
Deadwood Dick and scalp the raging Indian,
and the Dean excitement, and the Barker-
Placke prize-fight are all manifestations of the
public craving for something new and extra-
ordinary and containing more or less possi-
bilities of bloodshed—other people’s blood being
shed for preference.
The following letter, printed in Sydney Stock
and Station Journal of Bth Oct., 1895, pur-
ports to bear the signature of Mr. J. C. Ryrib,
of Wemabah (N.S. W.), one of the biggest
squatters in the province :
BREEDING HUMAN BEINGS.
(TO TUB EDITOR “ S.S. AND S. JOURNAL.”
Sir,—l am much pleased with the originality and truth
of your flying memos, in your issue of 24th inst. re breed-
ing human beings. You say truly, “In Australia we are
breeding the best of sheep in the world. Under our
lovely skies we are raising cattle and horses that beat all
competitors, but along with them we are raising some of
the meanest human beings that ever cursed the earth."
Quite true. Then, again: “Some people appear to be
under the impression that the reason we have so many
larrikins is owing to the lack of parental control,” &c.
Nothing of the kind ; it is owing to this cursed Edu-
cation Act, which makes the boys who have gained
a smalterivg ashamed of their parents when they
see the mother go to the wash-tub and the father
tuck up his sleeves to go to work like an honest,
hard-working man. Say they, We are fitted for something
better, and won’t work ; hence springs the agitator, street-
corner man, lounger, and larrikin. This so-called educa-
tion makes the boy discontented with his position in life.
We never had any larrikins before this Education Act
came into vogue ; that is the cause of larrikins. Give me
the working man who can neither read nor write, for then
he will give his whole attention to his work, instead of
devoting his time to noiels and agitation, etc. There are
superiors, inferiors, and equals all over the world, and very
properly so, and when pitchforked out of their positions
hence eruptions and troubles. People wonder at the
depression of the times and its cause, for it applies to
the whole world. It all lies in a nutshell, too many pro-
ducers and competitors, too many people in the world,
swarming like rabbits, and trying to shove each other off
the face of the earth to gain a livelihood. Some 25 years
ago everyone in the country was contented, thriving, and
doing well. Now, no one is doing wed, a hand-to-mouth
arrangement, with ruination slaring him in the face, and
thousands of men walking about the country starving
and not able to find work.—Yours, etc., J. C. Ryrib.
Wemabah, Dubbo, or Trangie. September 26,1895.
The conflict of opinion between Dr. Jamieson
and Dr. O’Connor on the question of lunacy
raised in the trial of Wilson before Acting-
Judge Backhouse at Sydney, the other day,
illustrates once more the incompleteness of ex-
pert evidence. From experts in handwriting
to experts in brain-disease, and from these
again to experts in criminal jurisprudence, the
knowledge and experience of one will, if a
little search is made, be contradicted by the
knowledge and experience of another. Look
at Pilcher and Salomons in the George Dean
case. It does not follow from this that expert
opinion is worthless, or that it should not be
submitted to a jury. But it does follow that
the evidence of a single expert, or two or three
experts, readied up by one side, should not be
allowed to possess the weight the ordinary jury
attaches to it. Chemical theories, for instance,
if dependent on the evidence of one analyst
only, should be viewed with the gravest sus-
picion.
The N.S.W. Justice Department’s recent ukase
that a sick prisoner shall, when he needs alco-
hol, be compelled to take it “ with a drug ”
(i.e., in an unpalatable or even nauseous form),
is revolting to the average doctor, the creed of
the profession being that in sickness all men
are to be treated in the same spirit. The order,
when you come to look at it, is really an order
for the institution of torture, and is in its way
as repulsive to every white man as the depart-
ment’s “ humane gag.” Would such a system
be tolerated for an instant by the honorary
medical staff of a public hospital ? The argu-
ment as to the new regulation being necessary
to stop malingering carries with it its own
refutation ; malingerers form but a small per-
centage of cases treated, and why should the
innocent-in-this-respect be made to suffer with
the guilty? But that it is the creed of the
N.S.W. Justice Department to give no man
the benefit of the doubt needed no additional
demonstration. Malingerers occasionally ap-
pear in every hospital, and it is surely as easy
to detect them in the gaol hospitals as in the
great city institutions.
■
In 1865, says a Fortnightly Review article,
an Italian named Pelizzioni was tried, in
London, before Baron Martin, for the murder
of a fellow-countryman in an affray at Saffron
Hill. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. In passing sentence the Judge made
the following remarks, which should always be
remembered when the acumen begotten of a
sound legal training and long experience is
relied on as a safeguard against error :
In my judgment it was very impossible for the jury to
have come to any other conclusion. The evidence was
about the clearest and the most direct that after a
long course of experience in the administration of
criminal justice 1 have ever known. / am as satisfied as
I can be of anything that Gregorio did not injlict the
wound, and that you were the person who did.
The trial was over. The Home Secretary would
most certainly, after the Judge’s expression of
opinion, never have interfered. The date of
the execution was fixed. Yet the unhappy
prisoner was guiltless of the crime, and it was
only through the exertions of a private indivi-
dual that an innocent man was saved from
Uie gallows. A fellow-countryman of his suc-
ceeded in persuading the real culprit (the
Gregorio so expressly exculpated by the
Judge) to come forward and acknowledge the
crime. He was subsequently tried for man-
slaughter and convicted, while Pellxzioni
received a free pardon.
The abolition of State aid to denominational
schools is to cost the Westralian taxpayer
■£15,000 in cash. The amount originally recom-
mended (by a Parliamentary committee well-
picked by the Govt.) was £30,000; the Govt,
managed to carry £20,000 by 16 votes to 15, and
then decided to compromise with the Opposi-
tion at £5OOO less. The province has got off as
well as could be expected under the circum-
stances, considering that the whole agitation
against sectarian grants has sprung up within
the last five years, since the arrival of
the hated and enlightened “ t’othersiders. ”
Five years ago nobody dared to talk “ aboli-
tion of State aid to religion ” to the Forrest
crowd ; and the Forrest crowd never dreamt
of talking “compromise” to the complaisant
Opposition. But the world moves—and so
does Westralia and the Westralian Parlia-
ment, thanks to Leake, Illingworth,:
Randall, and similar foes of bigotry. None
the less, the grant of £15,000 is a public scandal.
The priests’ and parsons’ schools, subsidised by
the State that they might attract pupils from
the State schools and sow in impressionable
young minds the seeds of dogmatic error and
religious feud, were not entitled to one penny of
compensation. Rather were they entitled to
congratulate themselves on getting off without
restitution. Westralia stultifies itself by taking
away the endowment with one hand and with
the other donating a sum of money the interest
on which will pretty nearly equal the endow-
ment. The fact that the sectarian schools have
accumulated valuable property under the old
system was impudently put forward as a reason
for compensation—and Westralia has followed
the example of the man who, when his horse
was stolen, advertised that he would be glad to
present the thief with the saddle and bridle as
well. The only consolation is that it is Wes-
tralia, and things might have been worse.
The new Sydney markets, to cost £204,000,
are the biggest single contract of the sort ever let
by aN.S.W, municipality. The work has now bten
going on for 11 months, and will last two y. ars
longer. The exterior lineal measurement ot the
whole building is £ mile 30yds.; and the summit
will be 192. t. above the street.
Dear old Hingland, land of freedom ! A
hospital-nurse went to visit her father at a London
West End hotel. Bhe appeared in the breakfast-
room in her hospital uniform, whereon up steps
the landlord, and informs her, in West End tones,
that she cannot be admitted as a guest, as her
uniform was objected to.
Blow, Gentle Meagher .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, wouldn’t you like the truth to hear of how it
came about—
How Meagher began to blow-o-oh, and Jul-i-an to
shout;
How Kater asked a question clear, how Want
became obscure;
How Patsy Crick unoricked and cricked—it
puzzles you, I’m sure.
But this little thing I would have you know :
The beginning and end and the whole was blow—
Australian blow,
Our own blow,
Not the Brummagem foreign kind—Oh, no !
But good old, genuine, ’possum-and-platypus,
bright Australian blow.
Because, you see, when Dean was clear and
pardoned by the Crown
It seemed a thing and a silly thing to give up the
renown;
To give up the renown, my boys, that lies in cun-
ning law
To prove that black is surely white, and a crack is
never a flaw.
But this little thing I would have you know :
The beginning and end and the whole was blow—
Australian blow,
Our own blow,
Not the spurious foreign thing—by Joe !
But right-down, regular, wattle-and-gum-tree, gay
Australian blow.
For Salomons looms in attorney-land, and thriving
lawyers scan
The eyes and nose (but especially nose) of this
successful man,
And blink and wink as they try to win the much

A fresh sea-breeze from the back-cloth and
an imaginary smell of salt-horse, born of the
realism of the scenery, attended the revival of
old “ Pinafore,” at the Lyceum, on Saturday.
It is a good many years since this opera was
last presented in Sydney, though sundry
amateur co.’s have committed it at intervals in
the suburbs, with more or less success. The
general impression on its re appearance is that
it is about the brightest and freshest of modern
operas ; the atmosphere from the painted ocean
in the background is a pleasant thing-to meet
with, and'the ancient man-of-war is a work of
art, and perfect down to the smallest detail.
Miss Juliet Wray takes the character of Jose-
phine for the first three nights, Miss Florence
Young filling the blue skirt of that innocent
child of the deep for the second half of the
season. Miss W.’s Josephine was well received,
though the performance, vocally and otherwise,
is hardly equal to her great success as Clairette.
Her acting, which was somewhat nervous, not
to say uneven and bumpy, in the first act on
Saturday, steadied wonderfully as the piece
progressed. Lauri doesn’t put much fun into
the character of Joseph Porter, but he is
tolerably effective, and the rest of the cast is
about faultless. Mrs. BVacy is one of the best
Buttercups The Bulletin remembers. Wal-
lace Brownlow and Tapley are both at their
brightest, and Edward Farley’s Dick Deadeye
is a marvel of angularity and many other good
qualities. Likewise, the chorus is particularly
excellent, and that fascinating little girl, Ivy
Scott, the smallest midshipmite yet seen, was
received in a cordial spirit, and encored till she
was nearly dead from exhaustion. The present
“ Pinafore ” is a beautifully-finished perform-
ance, and the blue sea and the fleet at anchor
in the distance are calculated to make Aus-
tralians feel reconciled, in a glow of nautical
fervor, even to the naval subsidy and the un-
picturesque spectacle of Garden Island, and the
occasional running of the Ringarooma on the
rocks.

Miss Annis Montague has a farewell
matinee benefit to-day (Thursday), at Sydney
Lyceum. The show is under tremendously in-
fluential patronage, and a good programme will
be presented, with the assistance of almost
everybody who is anybody worth mentioning in
theatrical circles.
** * *
Pro. Kennedy’s latest idea is to put a man
in a mesmeric sleep, keep him in that con-
dition for six days, and waken him at 10 sharp
on Saturday night (the 19th) in the presence of
an enthusiastic audience. The patient will
then sit up suddenly in a dazed frame of mind,
and realise that a whole week has dropped out
of his existence. All through this week the
animate mass of dead meat will be visible to
the press and the medical profession. Relays
of watchers appointed by the Sydney doctors
and others will watch him ceaselessly to keep
him from being eaten by rats, to scare the flies
off him, and to prevent dogs or stray pigs
taking bites out of him. The Bulletin’s pri-
vate opinion is that the police, if they can,
ought to shut down on the wretched spectacle
and show the Professor out of the town, also
that Parliament should enact—as has already
been done in some European countries—that
mesmerism is illegal save for medical purposes
only. It further draws attention to the fact
that if this kind of experiment happens too
often, it will end, sooner err later, in the
watchers going out for a surreptitious drink,
and the rats eating a considerable amount of
the trance patient in their absence.

The “ Prairie King ” is prospering at Her
Majesty’s. The literary merits of the piece are
at the same low ebb as reported last week, but
King Hedley’s stupendous dive into the tem-
pestuous tank in Act 11., and his horse’s mighty
fall from the broken bridge into the same tank
in Act 111., and the martial array of cowboys
who swim the tank in Act IY., are sufficient to
keep any drama going. The leading horse takes
to the work in a kindly spirit, and seems to fall
through the bridge every night in a perfectly
contented frame of mind. Apparently the
drama will go on and prosper till someone
starts a rival show with a bigger tank and
drops an elephant into it.

George Leitch’s “ Land of the Moa ” opens
at Sydney Royal on Saturday. The scenery is
announced to include the Pink Terraces of
Rotomahana, the Sulphur Island, the Black
Crater, the Devil’s Blowhole, the Wharepuni
of Rewi (whatever that may be), the Bush of
Tikitiri (whatever that may be), the eruption
of Tarawera, and many other beauties and
horrors. Those two excellent artists, the
Dacres, have joined the eo., likewise Sophia,
the well-known Maori lady who used to act as
guide at the hot lakes, and to wash the aston-
ished and undressed visitor in the mud-springs.
A rumour is already current that the scenery
will arouse her old familiar instincts, and that
she will make a strenuous effort to undress
and wash Leitch in the middle of the drama.
* * * *
Albert Banvard has not yet broken his
famous neck by his “ dive from the dome ” at
Sydney Tivoli, so that stupendous spectacle is
still on view. If he does break his neck, Tim
Bulletin presumes that the other six Banvards
will have to do their reckless performance on
the trapeze up by the roof in mourning tights.
Fred Garnett, a boneless individual, who seems
to be lineally descended from the crinky ser-
pent, has been added to the co. John Coleman,
the English funny man, is announced for
Saturday; and, wet or dry, in spite of de-
pression and drought and the Dean mystery,
the shekels still roll in with monotonous regu-
larity.
Last Monday, the variety co. at Sydney
Empire announced its performance was “ in
the presence of the officers and crew of the mis-
sionary ship John Williams.” This spiritual
recognition ought to be sufficient guarantee of
the merits of the show. The people who go
down to the sea in ships to rescue the poor
heathen are generally good judges of a perform-
ance with legs in it.

The Fitzgeralds’ sensational show, concern-
ing which The Bulletin has said many pleasant
things during its late Melb. season, opens at
Sydney Exhibition Building on Saturday.
* * * *
Mr. John Lawler advertises in this issue
for all kinds of first-class variety artistes for his
new music-hall at 608, 610 and 612 George-
street, which opens shortly. The hall is a
splendid structure, well-built, well-ventilated
and beautifully decorated, lighted by electri-
city, and practically fire-proof. It is capable of
accommodating with ease 1000 people, and
should be found one of the most elegant and
comfortable places of amusement in Sydney.

“The meek shall inherit the earth.” ; Not
yet a bit, for if there is a meek man and a
worthy it is W. J. Wilson, but his share of the
planet will not pay much land-tax. Men over
30 don’t need to be told that W. J. Wilson is
one of the oldest and most honoured figures in
the theatrical world. As scenic artist, mana-
ger and impresario his name has stood before
the public for 40 years without reproach. His
lines have not fallen in pleasant places for
several years back, so he is going to take a
benefit next Tuesday. All the stars scintillat-
ing in the Sydney theatrical firmament will re-
volve around him. And though many of the
public may be indifferent to the merits of Mr.
Wilson, or callous as to his position, yet when
it is known that a programme of exceptional
attractiveness and magnitude has been pre-
pared, and that the prices will be “ three, two,
and one,” there will probably be a bumper
house, which is the end aimed at.

After six months’absence “The Gaiety
Girl ” came back to Melbourne Princess’s on
Saturday, and got a louder approval, especially
from the amphitheatre, than was ever given to
the handsome novelty in its early struggling
days. This increase of popularity for “The
Gaiety Girl ” performance seems fully propor-
tionate to its falling off in point of artistic
merit. Louis Bradfield now takes the place
of Monkhouse as Doctor Brierley, and this
necessitates a new Bobbie, neither change
being a cause for rejoicing. The departed
fat man was a comedian with a humour "of his
own. He lent considerable drollery to a rather
dull character. Bradfield, who has no natural
humour, but only a clever, mechanical vola-
tility, plays Doctor Brierley on Lonnenesque
lines, and the chief effect of his industrious
mumming is to make Monkhouse respected
by many people who didn’t think the
stout person funny until his successor
challenged comparisons. The same people will
regret that Elton wasn’t called upon to fill the
gap (and he would, The Bulletin fancies, have
fitted it neatly), if only for the sake of avoiding
any further alteration of the original cast.
Miss Decima Moore and the gorgeous Widow
Hobson both suffer from the new order of
things, but Fred Kaye is still more palpably
comic than before ; and Palolta puls a little
earnestness into her bewitching picture of the
demon French girl, and the show is the co.’s
best all-round display, anyhow. “ In Town ”
next Saturday. The Saturday after that—the
Deluge. They sail for Europe per the Oruba.
O, woe is us !
* * * *
“ Joseph of Canaan ” is doing well at
the Royal. The first six nights looked healthy ;
the seventh was like unto one of the fat oxen
that stalked out of the river ; so Mrs. Putiphar
may be expected to have a guilty secret for
Joseph’s ear of scorn until further notice.
Parson Walters’ drama gains dignity and polish
as it grows older. The offspring of Jacob and
the Egyptian son of Erin with a brogue, are
leaving more footprints on the desert sand, so
to speak ; also, Pharaoh is less unduly civil to
his subjects than of yore. The scene in Court,
where George Rignold passes judgment on the
royal nightmare, has such a strong hold of
the audience that the prevailing silence
would explode and blow the roof off if
Ata were to strike a match. Just here
it may be remarked that Pharaoh’s dream,
although ordained by Heaven, was produced
by natural causes. When the Chief Baker was
flung into prison, a second-rate baker took
charge of Pharaoh’s pastry, therefore the sod-
dened undercrust sat heavy on ruler’s chest
and indigestion set in. And the fruity wines
which the temporary Chief Butler placed on
the rich man’s table did make him bilious.
Miss Maud Williamson, Scot Inglis, Miss
Claudius, and J. W. Hazlitt are happily placed
in this grave spectacle. Likewise the High
Priest’s daughter, who runs wild among the
clergy of the period, and needs a mother to
look after her, is an interesting young person in
white.

Fitzgerald Bros.’ uncommon show having
put in its appointed time at Melb. Exhibition,
hurried away to Bendigo on Monday, but may
return to the big metropolitan building sooner
or later, for another short season. Graceful
Madame Antonio, diver Peart, the contortionists
and Mahomet stand out as the astonishing
features of a select company, but the lady on
the rolling globe and a trio of male acrobats give
valuable support. Peart’s blood-curdling per-
formance fetched a warning letter from the
police department after the second night. His
platform was then fixed higher than his record
in London, where he had, moreover, a bigger
tank to aim at. Ultimately the management
reduced the Professor’s dive to a distance of
about 110 ft., and the authorities breathed more
freely.
** * *
The Fitzgeralds’ talking horse, Maho-
met, is just a wonder, or rather his trainer’s
imperceptible trick of telling the horse
what to do, and when to cease doing it, is
wonderful. If an attendant, way down among
the audience, holds up a slate in a particular
way which denotes the figure written on the
other side, the horse raps the correct number,
but not out of his own head, as your “ Poverty
Point ” paragraphist seems to think. Trainer
Probasco looks at the slate, having previously
explained to the audience the attendant’s
system of announcing each particular number,
and he (Probasco) appeals to Mahomet, who
gives a prompt answer. If a 0 has been
figured on the slate, Mahomet doesn’t rap at
all, but merely shakes his head. The oftener
one watches the performance with one eye on
the tutor and the other on his four-legged pupil,
the more extraordinary it seems. Probasco
talks to the horse as though it had a series of
answers to his sentences stored in its memory,
and the animal never hesitates about replying
with a nod or a shake of the head. For in-
stance, he asks “You like kissing the young
ladies?” (Mahomet nods.) “ You like kissing
the old maids?” (Mahomet shakes a No.)
“Is one kiss enough for the young ladies ? ”
(No, from the horse.) “You like more than
one ? ” (Mahomet nods.) “ How many kisses
do you think they ought to have ? ” (Mahomet
stamps his hoof again and again until told to
stop.) And when asked to show the audience
how he kisses the girls, Mahomet promptly
turns his neck and puts his muzzle to Pro-
basco’s mouth. An educated horse —educated
apparently to understand hints so cunningly
given to him that alert lookers-on can’t detect
any means by which he is prompted. Mahomet
doesn’t need to be stationed at a considerable
distance from his audience. Occasionally he
walks into a newspaper office, climbs upstairs
to the editor’s sanctum, and goes through the
business there.

Harry Shine and Miss Millie Herberte
join the Rickards’ Co. at Melbourne Opera
House on Saturday. The Gaiety, dropping its
alias of Oxford, reopens on the same evening
with a host of varieties, and a few other places
are offering fitful entertainments in the belief
that a dancing carnival has commenced.

Are the Irish of Melbourne not patriotic

The Victorian Artists, who, in spite of
their youthful mannerisms and bilious eccentri-
cities on canvas, deserve to flourish, are about
to hold a Carnival at Melbourne Exhibition in
aid of their banking-account. Long ago these
sanguine dreamers built an Art Gallery on
“ tick,” and the procee Is of the coming Carni-
val will go towards obliterating the debt so
rashly incurred. The promoters have sassiety
at their back and splendid prospects of success
before them. About GOO ladies, together with
an influential mob of male persons, have formed
committees all over the place for the purpose of
working up a boom, Melbourne is strewn over
with hand-painted show-cards, mainly the
clever work of certain “ cannibal ” caricatur-
ists, advertising the Carnival, and the noble
Brassey will perform the inaugural ceremony,
supported by lady B. and suite, probably on
bikes. Wednesday, Ocr,. 23rd, is the date fixed
for this unique event. It is to be a carnival of
infinite variety, extending over several days,
and the full programme measures half-a-tnile in
length, or a trifle less- Indeed, if the com-
mittee and the people wlo have promised to
take part in the entertainment had taken up a
unanimous collection for the good cause at the
outset, they might have wiped out the artists'
debt without holding a carnival.

Louis Bradfield is genuinely funny when a
newspaper reporter comes along to interview him,
and the delicate question of Arthur Roberts crops
up. It appears from a recent interview that
“ Mr. Bradfield was glad to be able to create
‘ Gentleman Joe ’ for himself here, as it had nob
been produced when he left London. As he.has
only seen Mr. Arthur Roberts play three times in
his life , he can hardly be said to have copied
his Captain Coddington of ‘ln Town.’” Cer-
tainly not. The resemblance between the two
performances was no doubt a mere accident-all
the same it was a lucky accident for Bradfield.
The great fault of Bradfield’s “Gentleman Joe”
is that the cabby seems a comparatively original
creation. People would have preferred another
lot of accidental reminders of Roberts. Yet
there’s no serious fault to be found with Braddy
“on his own.” He’s a very good “singing
waiter ” sort of comedian, although not a natural
humorist. Not one actor in a thousand is an
original humorist in any department, for a humor-
ist must be able to laugh at his own weaknesses,
and it is hard—O, it is hard—for the man who
laughs at himself to take seriously to an actor’s
life. Why is acting the one profession, or art, in
which women are at least equal, if not superior, to
men? Because the ladies are lacking in sense of
humor. But this is moralising.
** * *
The attitude assumed by professional
musicians towards newspaper critics is, after all, a
good deal more absurd than the airs which critics
give themselves. Little Mark Hambourg, for
instance, says : “ I never look at what they write.
Who are they ? ” If it comes to that, who are the
people responsible for Mark’s treble recalls and
“unparalleled ovations?” The general public,
devoid of musical feeling and artistic sense, for
the most part. They cheer Mark for his excep-
tional ability to strike a given number of notes
correctly within a given time, but they would be
more impressed by an automaton smiting the
same keys at a higher rate of speed. Firework
pianoforte-playing appeals to the order of intellect
that prefers an acrobatic show to a grand opera.
*# * *
Mind-reading ? Ah ! Pin-finding 1 Pshaw 1
That represents the logical attitude of one of the
latest Sydney showmanisms. The conditions of
pin-finding have never been above suspicion, i.e.,
if the performer intends people seriously to believe
that he enacts his feats by mind-reading. Muscle-
jerking is another so-called scientific wonder. So
is “shuffling the feet in the witness-box,” accord-
ing to a learned Judge. None of the feats per-
formed were any better, and most of them were
not nearly as good as those performed by the
Steens (Prof, and Mrne.), who both owned up that
they had a secret oracular code that merely de-
manded from them constant practice and uninter-
rupted alertness. If a pin-finder can find a pin by
mind-reading, then he can disclose the pin-hider’s
thoughts on anything. Let that test be made,
but let it be made under conditions that will abso-
lutely be above all suspicion of collusion between
the thinker and the reader.
At Poverty Point .
The Gee Gees were so largely parcelled off and engaged
to the male members of the 00. when they arrived, that
local Johnniedom simply hadn’t a look-in.
Juliet Wray is foolish to call herself by any name
beginning- with a silent letter. People will allude to her
as M ss R., while jockeys and bookies will think she is
connected with “ Boh Bay.” What's the odds there is not
a 2 year-old fldy of the same name next year—say out of
Melodious by Sound, or a mare by Bonypart?
Melbourne playgoers would like to see a slimmer Joseph
in Canaan. George Kignold would make an excellent
king—fat, Pharaoh, and fifty. Seeing Joseph as he is, it
is hard to believe in those seven years of famine.
When “Joseph of Canaan ” was in rehearsal, Rignold
is said to have had a terrible time keeping Sweeney from
acting his part in Irish. This was a mistake. A Hebrew
with a brogue would have supplied the comic relief sadly
wanting in the piece.
It was Henry Arthur Jones who once said that he
wouldn’t want to go further than the Bible to find plots
for new plays. There’s the story of Daniel: the yarn
about Elijah (or was it Elisha?), and the leper Naaman,
and the covetous servant who “ tapped ” Naaman for
handsome presents and was doomed to take over the
warrior’s discarded leprosy along with 'em. And Jonah
and the whale. Ye gods ! what sort of a marine spectacle
would Bland Holt make out of Jonah and the whale !
David would he a good line ; and Samson ! Think of
George Rignold in the live-act melodrama “S mishit,”
concluding wilh the polling down of the Philistine temple
and the death of everybody !
Fitzgerald Bros.’ “entertainment” (why not “cir-
cus? ’) disdains the plebeian “ interval." “Ten minutes’
repose " is the more aesthetic programme-note.
Fred. Kaye is a misogynist and refuses to reside in the

muslin on the premises K >ye “shifts.” In this way he
has led a peripatetic existence in Melh., five hostelries

and it is quite possible that he may sample one or two
more before the season closes. Kaye, by the by, lias just
got over a bad bilious attack. It is suspected that lie saw
one of the New Women on a “ bike.”
The clerical career of pastor Walters, as snob, appears
to be ended in the fatal gulf of stage structure. Asa
preacher, or rather lecturer, be was ever agreeable, though
serving up a haggis of what he bad read. His friend
Wybert Reeve is understood to be bis mentor io the dis-
pute wilh Rignold. Whenever Walters refers to a “dis-
tinguished theatrical friend of mine,” or something like
that, it is Wybert, who even occupied Walters’s Melh.
pulpit once or twice. If Walters put Reeve into the
pulpit, and R eve puts Walters on t'n* stag", it will be a
fair swap. Walters cultivates a decidi d G. V. Ibooke
appearance. ills friend Rev. John Reid, of Melh., is
another good old actor at his elbow.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback- the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

An Insurance Swindle,
A rather good story appears in the Havannah
Trade Journal, devoted to the interests of
tobacco. It appears that an ingenious, but econo-
mical smoker, with a weakness for good cigars,
purchased a thousand of the famous B.L. Corto
Rothschilds and forthwith insured them. Then
he set to work to smoke them, and having con-
sumed them all, demanded £25 from the insurance
company, on the ground that the whole of the
insured stock had been destroyed by fire. The
court decided in his favor, whereupon the com-
pany brought an action for conspiracy, accusing
him of having intentionally set fire to the cigars,
and obtained his committal to prison for three
months. THe story may be true or it may not.
At any rate, the B.L. Corto Rothschild cigars are
the best value ever imported into Australia. They
are a delicious smoke, and sold by all first-class
tobacconists at 6d. each.*

Pro.: “‘Joseph of Canaan ' is worth about £2OOO for
production in England and America. Kignold means to
have a slioe of this, and it is not merely the barren honor

Dear BCLLRTIN, —Archaeological criticisms on “Joseph”

Dear Bulletin, —Now that the subject of Juliet Flegel-
(auh is getting worn out—down to the bone as it were—
how would a story about old man Flegeltaub go? It was
when Juliet was at an age when she little thought of the
free ads. the yet unborn Bulletin would dish up for her,
that I had a benefit in the frosty city : to make it boom
(the benefit) I advertised gifts, and amongst the articles I
bought a gorgeous clock from Mr. Flegeltaub. It had a
marble stand, a crystal cover, and seemed to be built of
solid gold angels and cupids. Well, the show was brought
off successfully, and, singularly enough, the clock was
won by the printer, to whom a bill was owing, hut that s
another story. When he got the clock he wanted a key
to wind it up, and as none of the keys in Ballarat seemed
to be nude for that build of machine, lie came and
bothered me for one. I, in turn, went to Flegel, who
said he would soon supply the deficiency. A day or two
passed, but no key could be found. At last Flegeltaub’s
patience wore out, and with a comical smile he asked
me “Vat de deffel do you vant mitderkey? Doyou really
oxpect so glorious-looking a concern to go?”—P. ABBOTT.

Sketch.
The Rev. Walters, in his letters to the Melb. papers, re
the authorship of “Joseph of Canaan,” piously resenis
the insinuation of Ansuin George that his dialogue, as it
Stood iu the original* was calculated to harrow up the
sensibilities of those good church-goers whom George was
most anxious to inveigle into the Royal, and asserls that,
on the contrary, the management made the temptation-
scene much more templing than it is in ins version. The
reverend dramatist thinks Joseph is over-tempted in
Kignold s representation of the scene, and the cast-iron
propriety of Joseph, under the circumstances, certainly
does lend to the situation an air of improbability.
Danvers—poor old Danvers—died the other week in
some dull corner of Hmgland, paralysed and forgotten.
He was a burlesque actor, and a droll fellow in the long

John Wood were glad to dance “break-downs” in his
company. There may still he found in ancient theatrical
albums a few photos, of little Marie Wilton throwing her
legs at Danvers, and Mrs. Bancrott.jit is said, never misses
a chance of buying up those souvenirs of her frisky past.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
October 15, 1895,
My Dear Moorabinda—
It was not at all disappointing to mo to find the
French ball, in aid of the Bienfaisanco Francaise
(at Sydney Town Hall last Monday evening), just
the facsimile of the balls that we’ve been having
all along, because French and English mixtures
never do effervesce. Asa usual sort of charity
dance, then, it may be said to have “got home ”
—good gallery and floor attendance, up-to-date
music, nicely-trimmed basement supper, and the
usual gloomy cavern for the patronisers, which is
called the dais. Ball committees seem to have a
solemn rule not to throw any more light on
their bell-wethers than can be helped, and it is
probably the murky atmosphere into which
these centre ornaments are plunged which
makes them dress so weirdly sometimes. The
best dress on the dais was worn by pretty
Madame Blanc: it was the shade of Parma
violets in satin brocade mingled with ivory satin,
and as the wearer fluttered .about the dark dais it
looked like a Francisca blossom blowing about a
coal-hole.
The Acting-Governess, in black satin brocade
with gaps of oyster-white brocade (by the way,
the A. V.R. habit of holding up the tail of her
gown when she promenades, though strictly
economical, is scarcely complimentary to the
broom-and-duster committee), was hardly distin-
guishable in the Cimmerian gloom of the dais ;
and the Major-Generaless also in black, with a
spray of natural roses, was merely an outline in
the darkness. The president (Lady limes) was
more visible in yellow brocade with violets and
violet satin ribbons. Miss Granville sported a
quaint garb of cream and mauve and striped silk.
The two youngest A.V.R. daughters were rather
limp in floral frocks.
Madame Tauveron (one of the hon. secs.) wore
a fetching confection of mauve and green silk
crepe, which made a Frenchy ensemble—but there
was plenty of sternly English Locking to dilute
the artistic effect of the one or two light and airy
confections on top. On the whole the toggery
was not smart —it’s too late in the season for
ball-frocks. Mark Harnbourg, whose Town-hall
concerts are a glittering success, turned up in a
basin-crop. Like the swan who should never be
seen walking, so Mark Harnbourg should never
be far off a piano-stool, for it is borne in upon
one that this brilliant and lionised youth could
not attempt to catch a pig in a passage, as the
saying goes—also that his hips are as wide as a
woman’s. Another celebrity, standing in conver-
sation with a real live poet, was Grace Rebellious
Susan Noble, who looked very captivating in blue
brocade and violets.
Talking of actresses reminds me that the
nuptials of Mr. Alf Marks (of Darling Point) and
Miss Claire Leighton, of theGee-Gees, werequietly
performed in Melbourne last week, with Mr.
Stuart Wallace as best man. The newly-married
pair didn’t rush away to hide their happiness,
but went to the races after the ceremony, the
bride appearing in “The Shop Girl ” at night.
Miss Leighton is the first Gee-Gee (so far as I
remember) to make a more or less society match
in Australia, for Letty Lind and her silver king
came to cross purposes and matrimony didn’t
eventuate.
The concert given last week at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hall by M. Napoleon Boffard—a recently-
unpacked tenor from Paris, with a somewhat
soprano quality about his top-register—was a
success of three —the tenor himself, Miss Edith
King, and Edgar Strauss. The rest was chaos;
for Kowalski, billed to appear, did not show.
Financially the concert was “Jack Frost.” Syd-
ney has become so inured to charity concerts
where the artists give their services, that the
common sort of concert, to which you go for
music’s sake alone and not to buy John Smith a
cork leg, never gets a show. And strange
vocalists, who willingly lend their services to
charity concerts, at first with an eye to biz (as they
vainly imagine), quickly make the starvation dis-
covery that Sydney musicians are people who go
to great expense beforehand to perfect themselves
in their art so that, apparently, the services they
are obliged to give away for nothing will be the
best to be obtained locally. One of the best ways
for a musioian to attract a paying audience in
Australia is to die a horrible and well-advertised
death, leaving a fascinating widow not over 84,
and a large and influential committee to work up
a ben. on her behalf.
The S.A.O.S. concert in Sydney Town Hall last
Thursday week was a well-rounded-off show, with
Sig. Hazon in the bird-cage threatening the per-
formers with his shillelagh, and a good spread of
audience in front. It was a great success for the
orchestra, though the vocalist of the evening—
Miss Flo. Eidaile—was naturally too comic
operatio in her style to sing Wagner s music
acceptably. The tuft on top of the pop*
cert was Beethoven’s concerto for violin
and ’chestra. Mr. Allpress played the fiddle
part in a manner which did equal credit to
his soul and his muscles, for the concerto is a tour
de force, lasting about three-quarters of an hour;
and the orchestra boomed and twanged, and pom-
pora’d in strapping style. I didn’t so keenly ap-
preciate the Sakantala overture —whicli suggested
a bit of particularly ferocious tapestry
set to music. . >y 1 "’ .
Apropos of music, the newest idea in religious
circles is to have an overture played for a
quarter of an hour before the agony com-
mences. It was announced last week that
the newly-arrived-from-Tasmania lady-organist
of a psychologically-inclined Sydney church,
which would be eternally staging problem-
plays if it ever turned inside-out and became a
theatre, would play the organ for a quarter of an
hour prior to the service—introducing, the worldly
might imagine, the principal airs to be heard dur-
ing the performance, with a chastened waltz-
movement illustrative of the deacon going round
after ttie threepenny-bits. Soon religious ads.
will run, “ Overture at 7.3 o—commence at 8.”
A particularly awful example of the horrible
effects of the Trinity College musical exams, is
the Queensland waltz, by Jean Lamond. Tins
awkward composition somehow reminds you
of a hash of ancient drinking-songs which are not
pursued far enough to be absolutely glaringly
“reminiscent,” but their ghosts hover o’er every
page most noticeably in the main air. And any-
body who could dance to it would also be able to
waltz to the tender strains of Chinese opera.
From Gordon and Gotch I have 'received anew
and revised copy of “Still Apart,” in D. A
dash after the. D would fill a long-felt want.
Titipu society now possesses two Mrs, Mala-
props moving in the highest circles—which is the
safest place for them to be if they really want
their uncertain English to ese.ape detection. 'lhe
latest from Mrs. M. No. 2 (whose society nick-
name is “Mrs. Partington”) was a story of how
she was driving to see a friend recently when “ I
nearly had a severe accident, for the horses shied
at a gladiator lying on the verandah.” Shemeant
alligator, of course, the same as she meant “ in-
flammation ” when she said about somebody’s
wound that “amputation” had set in.
Talking about alligators as verandah-ornaments
reminds me that the handsomest and most original
of lamp-stands is a tripod of emu-legs (from the
knee down and including the toes), which have
been thrown into a tan-pit just as they were cut
from the birds and left to tan for a year or so. So
far, the only part of an emu which has been made
into a drawing-room ornament is the large,
green egg, which is extremely monotonous as an
object of vertu —is never useful —and is almost as
common as woolwork flowers under glass. The
legs—so long overlooked —are rarer and naturally
more fashionable and expensive, for, while the
emu’s laying capacities are infinite, given a fair
field, there are seldom more than two legs to each
bird.
A Sydney medico had a rather unusual experi-
ence the other day, which almost induced him to
believe that women are only oysters in petticoats,
in the absence of satisfactory explanation. A
patient came to him suffering from a tumor in her
right ear, and, when the surgeon had operated and
removed the swelling, it was found to contain a
small pearl! The only explanation that occurred
was that the patient must have been sleeping with
her cheek on the ring when the pearl had got
loose and slipped in. This is another of the awful
consequences of being engaged to be married, and
is also a good yarn for an impecunious Romeo _to
remember when he wants to get over giving
jewels to his Juliet. “Take this plain gold ring,
my ownest. I love you too well to give you any-
thing that could drop down your ear.”
And talking of disappearing pearls somehow
reminds me that an Australian girl swallowed
four artificial teeth the other day. What a treat
it would be to see an Australian woman clad in
her own teeth and not girning at you with blue
horse-fangs in a yellow face, or vice-versa. Asa
rule an Australienne’s teeth are as false as her
tongue, only the teetli are safer. You can tell the
shop-made grinders at a glance, while you only
find out the falsehoods bit by bit.
Looking up the statistics, the other day, I was
interested to see that a foundling-asylum in Russia
receives 12,039 wild oats every year, of whom all
the boys are trained for the navy. Giddiness > is
hereditary—and this may account for the weird
proclivities of a large number of .naval officers
who wear tan boots and look quite harmless seen
publicly in a civilised city, although the denizens
of remote lands tell other tales. I hear, for in-
stance, that a certain gold - buttoned contin-
gent who went recently cruising amid the
innocent coral isles had a distinctly gorgeous time.
One of the games was a water-chute—each gallant
Oapt. Corcoran being deftly guided to the depths
below by a belle sauvage dressed in the very ex-
treme fashion of the country. Beyond the fun to
be got out of this sort of thing, the gallant cruise-
abouts don’t seem to have come back with any
very startling information. I hear that one
spoffish lieutenant has learnt how to get a good
buttercup gloss on his tan feet by means of banana-
skins—but that seems a little thing to go all those
weary miles after.
The Society of Artists* children*s-party last
Friday evening, at York-street Kink, was a clever
idea cleverly carried out. The novel programme
by Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton)
was most artistically compiled from every point
of view, and the several hundred infants, rang-
ing from well-grown 14 to very small fours, had
a joyous time, what with the awful tragedy of
Punch and Judy, singing, dancing, funny sketches,
and absolutely unlimited “pastry” to crown the
whole and encourage the colic. The evening was
an amusing novelty for the oldsters, too, who
came in full war-paint, though the crowd was too
great for “ grown-up ” furbelows to make a hit,
and besides, it was most emphatically the nursery
first and the rest nowhere. Sydney society cer-
tainly has a fair share of pretty children. One
child in white, with blue rosettes and golden hair
d la Nellie Stewart’s “Paul Jones’’ wig, was a
veritable bundle of dimples—but what struck mo
most about some of the bantlings was their strik-
ing likeness to tlieir proud papas. You could ,
place almost all the society olive branches at least
without looking at the catalogue, so to speak, i
because of that strong likeness.
The Art Society’s annual conversazione, held at
the rooms, Pitt-st., on 9th inst,, was the usual
well-dressed crowd being entertained with vocal
and band music and long welcome intervals for
copious refreshments. Acting vice-royalty turned
up missing, and the lengthy brand-new president
of the society was detained at the Legislative
Assembly. Considering the new president’s indies,
it is possible he bad caught his hair in a Parlia-
mentary skylight and could not be extricated in
time to turn up. However, he sent the presi-
dentess and a daughter as his proxies, and,
generally speaking, the highest compliment a man
of the world can pay any function is to stop
severely away himself and send his wife and
daughter. The Art Society's conversazmne made
the usual success, and calmly performed its old
sleight-of-hand trick of getting more crowds into
a given space than would seem to be arithmetically
possible.
Talking about festivals and f£tes —the Sydney
bigwigs who attended a recent naval tea- party
were hurt in the tenderest part of their etiquette
at the attentions paid by the host to a veteran
politician and the lady whom he convoyed—report
having it that the lady’s white attire was a dress-
rehearsal for the bridal robes which she will
shortly assume. The veteran was reverently
seated in the front row, so to speak, all day long,
to the disgust of the Bigwig par excellence, who
is said never to have sent him a card for even the
most unflinchingly official functions.
“ H.M.S. Pinafore ’’ revived briskly at Sydney
Lyceum last Saturday. All the same, I have
heard and seen better Josephines than Juliet
Wray, who came like a blue coot —a burlesque
Josephine in a short satin redingote, a blue cap,
and red hair hanging down her back. Captains’
daughters don’t dress like that even in comic-
opera, and so her change to a long skirted bridal
gown and her hair (golden this time) in a teapot-
knot, was quite a relief. But most people won-
dered why Flo. Young wasn’t put up for the first
night, if only for her vocal abilities ; truth to tell,
Miss Wray’s voice was somewhat distressing at
various points in “Pinafore.”
Wallace Brownlow (and I wish to state, in
answer to several correspondents, that Wallace
Brownlow is his real name, and there is no fear
of him turning out to be William Brown) cut a
dash as Captain Corcoran, and balanced his
cocked hat as if to the manner born ; neither did he
catch his heels in his sword. The Captain is one
of W.B.’s picture-parts, evidently. Tapley made
a very pretty tar—indeed, I think “Rafe ” Rack-
straw is one of Tapley’s picture-parts, too—but
the she-sailors who danced the jig with flags in
the second act were not so picturesque, taking
them all round—only so many bounding argu-
ments why women shouldn’t wear trousers on top.
Lauri’s Sir Joseph reminded me of Captain Cook
as seen in'Hyde Park —especially one attitude —
but slow-running parts are not Lauri’s best vein.
I suppose we have at last arrived near the
denouement of the Dean case, and one can’t help
feeling glad that the whole bag of tricks was
revealed before any more women made exhibi-
tions of themselves in deifying the wily
ferry captain and showing a disposition to
twine flowers in his hair. A lot of
women have occasion to feel very small indeed
over this affair. 1 wonder, for instance, how that
excited female feels, who tore off her glove to
shake hands with the idol of the hour before he
toppled over, and then enthusiastically kissed the
place where his horny hand —the one with which
he poisoned Madaine’s tea—had pressed ? For
my part I must confess I thought the youth
falsely accused at first, but felt some doubts
about his innocence when I read that canting,
ultra-pious letter of his, concocted after his sen-
tence to death —a letter brimming over with
mawkish expressions of piety. Innocent people
are not always religious ; on the contrary, an easy
flow of Scripture is the trade-mark of calculating
guile in 99 cases out of a hundred. It is signifi-
cant that since the cat got out of the bag not a
telling text has escaped the prisoner’s lips—a cigar
and a newspaper, both profane things, are more in
his line apparently, which shows conclusively that
the man who turns the whites of his eyes up to
Heaven on the shortest notice has generally a
great deal to conceal.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The most wholly criminal aspects of the
Dean case were that Crick made bis Parliamen-
tary statement about Meagher’s guilt on Tuesday
night, when this paper was just going to press,
and that Dean made bis confession on Wednesday
afternoon, when last week’s issue of The Bulle-
tin was nearly all printed. Considering that The
Bulletin has spoken not unkindly of Mr. Crick
on many occasions, it regards his conduct in con-
fessing on Tuesday night as black ingratitude. All
lawyers are requested to confess in future not
later than Monday afternoon.
• # #
The downfall oi Dean arises solely through
the desire of every weak man to breathe into the
capacious ear of somebody the dreadful secret
which is too large to be humped around alone. So
Dean breathed his story into the huge ear of
Meagher, and Meagher, built on the same plan,
promptly started breathing on bis own account.
If Dean hadn’t told Meagher, Meagher wouldn’t
have told Salomons, and Salomons wouldn’t have
told Want, and chemist Smith possibly wouldn’t
have told anybody, and the whole problem would
most likely have lain quiet till the end. A man
who knows how to get rid of the body on scientific
principles, and who lias no accomplices, and doesn’t
keep a diary, or talk in bis sleep, or breathe into
the large, convoluted ear of any person whatever,
is the ideal murderer. Therefore, every intended
assassin should take this for his motto: “Don’t
breathe.” If he must mention the dreadful fact
to ease his mind, then he should go outside the
Heads in a small boat at midnight and mention it
in Latin to the dog-star, and even then be should
do it only when a strong westerly is blowing.
# • •
Dean’s confession was a plain, business-
like statement of alleged fact with no frills on it.
Meagher’s was an elevated document with great
chunks of high-toned eloquence—the work of a
vain little solicitor posturing to the last. “ I only
wish I could put buck the universe again to the
Photo. by Kerry.
Mrs. DEAN and BABY.
day I made my first error” (quotation from the
“Silver King” slightly altered and badly im-
proved : “Oh, God,” says Wilfred Denver, “put
back Thy universe and give me yesterday ”). The
idea of Meagher putting back the universe is very
fine. “ And as there is a destiny that shapes our
ends rougb-bew them how we will ” (Shakespeare).
“Sir Julian Salomons became from me the re-
pository of the secret.” Even at this crisis
the fallen attorney doesn’t simply say, “I told
Salomons, Q.G.” Again, “I am determined to
endure mental torture no longer nor to stifle the
voice of truth.” “ I became aware after Ids con-
viction of his guilt, aud, coming from Darling-
hurst in the tram, I was torn asunder,” &c.
This is partly eloquence and partly bathos; picture
a police-court solicitor being torn asunder in a
tram ! And then there is the peroration :
I trust with my young life—-yet under 30 years of age—
I may in some other portion of the globe lead the life of
truth, and use my humble faculties in the small sphere I
shall move in for the promotion of the happiness and win-
ning the esteem of those I come in contact with in a
strange country, and that in the land I love my acts may
in days to come be forgiven and forgotten.
“ The land I love !” Patriotism, the last refuge
of an attorney ! The saddest thing about Meagher,
after all, is the eloquence of bis downfall. He fell
like G. Rignold, in the centre of the stage, with
the limelight on him and his eyes fixed on the
gallery.

It is notable that the S.M. Herald made
no reference whatever to the weeping-and-wailing
S.A. gubernatorial-clerical lunch-party at which
Judge Windeyer was present and was prayed for,
and at which “ all ” went down on their marrow-
bones. Did not the Herald’s Adelaide corres-
pondent supply the information, or is the Herald
developing a sense of humor? The latter alterna-
tive, however incredible, is preferable to the
theory that the Herald didn’t know about the
affair. That the clergy should turn dog on the
Herald is absolutely inconceivable.

Except M‘Millan, M.L.A., the committee
and officials of the Miry Dean fund are all
lawyers. Mrs. Dean is deserving of all sympathy,
for she has been cruelly injured, and the most
strenuous enquiries, fair and foul, have utterly
failed to disclose a single spot on her character.
But let there be no mistake about the fund raised
on her behalf—it is designed by, at any rate, the
non-legal subscribers, from whose pockets most of
it vvillnorne, solely as a means of placing her in
comfort, and not as a medium of whitewashing
any functionary whose failure to properly perform
his duty has been at least the indirect means of
enabling a cold-blooded intending assassin to
escape the full penalty of his crime.

That the proposal to revoke the royal
pardon granted to Dean on the report of the Com-
mission should be seriously discussed in official-
legal and political circles is a lamentable evidence
of the pettifogging style of the N.S.W. powers
that be. To revoke a royal pardon would be, as
it were, to debase, to “smash,” the legal cur-
rency. It would be like a bank dishonoring its
own big note in order to get level with a cat's-
meat man. It would be as though the Archangel
Gabriel, after sounding the last trump, told the
dead to get back into their graves for a
few minutes, as the Deity hadn’t yet finished
breakfast. The proposal to revoke so tremen-
dous an instrument as a royal pardon shows
how many grocer-souled wretches are in the
Botanv Bay legislature, at the Botany Bay bar,

When in the condemned-cell, Possum
Dean wrote the following beautiful letter to
Parson Bennett-Anderson :
Darlinghurst Gaol,
April 13, 1895.
Dear Friend—
It gives me great pleasure to write these few lines to
you, trusting it will reach you with God’s speed, for
the comfort which you gave to me on your visit to
me on Thursday. Likewise the sermon which you left
with me, enHtled “ Death Overcome," which (/ires me
yreat spirit when / read it, w'lieh / am doinj daily, as I
have, to prepare myself to meet my Maker. Bat, thanks
to Oof, I wi|l he able to meet Him a pure and innocent
beiny; and I also hope the Lord will forgive the ones
which have brought this trouble on me, and that it may
please him to forgive mine, enemies, persecutors, and
slaiKlerers, and to turn their hearts, which has been
against me. I also hope to see you again when an oppor-
tunity affords you.
Trusting with God s will and wish,
I remain,
Yours innocently,
Cav. George Dean,
Darlinghurst Gaol.
1i.1.P.
When Possum got out he told the Norwich
Chambers meeting that—
He would do anything in his power to uphold his repu-
tation in his future life. He had led a very good life
before and trusted in God to continue to do so. He
would shun any traps that might be laid for him.
But he didn’t shun the traps enough. They
grabbed him—twice —on the steamer.

If any really keen, forceful young barrister
cuts bis throat anywhere in N.B.W. within the
next six months, The Bulletin will know that he
did it because lie had lost the one great oppor-
tunity of bis life—the chance to rise in one act to
the top of bis profession by defending (whether to
acquittal or conviction) George Dean. If that
misguided harbor mariner hadn’t confessed, but
bad lied to the bitter end, he would have afforded
somebody a splendid opening. His barrister could
have risen up and pointed out that his client was
a brave and noble-hearted young seaman (here
Dean would smite his hairy chest in the dock);
that he had gone through a great ordeal and was
yet strong in his innocence (here Dean would
assume the upward expression of Moses when lie
strikes the rock in the Sunday-school lithograph).
Then he would explain that his client hadn’t
fled from the country after his release like one
driven away by a guilty conscience (here Dean
would assume the attitude of G. Washington in
the darkest hours of bis fortunes). After that he
would allude to the discrepancies in the evidence
—the fact that Meagher said he fell on the floor
when he heard about the alleged discovery of bis
guilt, whereas a warder was present and could
assert that he didn’t fall on anything; the fact
that the chemist denied supplying the strychnine,
so that it was wholly unaccounted for; the fact
that witneseses who swore against him had
previously declared the exact opposite of what
they now asserted, and were as unreliable in one
capacity as in the other (here Dean would pass his
brown band through his back hair and look like
Sir Walter Raleigh when he was going to be
executed on a false accusation). Then, when he
had spread himself on these and several dozen
other discrepancies, he would point with a
trembling forefinger to his client’s previous good
character (here Dean would again pound on his
chest, like the cheerful African gorilla) and throw
in a peroration. And, instead of all these glories,
the fallen mariner, who is evidently quite devoid
of all artistic-legal instincts, made a common,
vulgar confession with common, vulgar perspira-
tion slopping off him as he did it, and his head
smoking with agitation and moisture.

Sandridge, which badly wanted to be the
landing-place "f Lord Br issey, and was denied
the honor and glory b ’cause it looks like the in-
carnation of tiie dead boom, and smells of soap-
works and other rank industries, has been com-
forted. The other day Brassey’s dog (hats off !)
was landed there, also his groom (bow reverenti-
ally !) and a few truck-loads of goods belonging to
the noble lord. The local paper gushed oyer this
circumstance, and the mayor was with difficulty
prevented from reading an address of welcome to

The New Woman has progressed from the
psychological to the bike-ological.
The Church of England is
now cutting its own throat with
the pig’s-foot of divorce. It won’t
recognise as a churchman or a
churchwoman anyone legally
divorced, unless he or she had
been sinned against adulteronsly.
It won’t remarry anyone divorced,
unless he or she has been divorced
for that one reason only, and is
himself or herself free from the
allegation of adultery. Of course,
it can’t prevent these other lies
and shes from getting re-married
elsewhere and elsehow, but it holds
them, in the Church’s awful eye,
as living in a state of sinful
non-wedlock. This seems “bad
business ” for the church.

The report of the last South
Sea Islands cruise of the mission
steamer, John Williams, is, in
places, exhilarating reading for
the unregenerate. At Tan, in the
island of Manna, the Queen de-
livered a sermon ; the maids of
honor, “in gala dresses,” chap-
eroned by the Queen’s cup-bearer,
visited the steamer —it may easily
be unofficially supposed that,
after the way of women, they
mashed whomsoever they would
—and “a special official reception
to do honor to the ship took the
form of a grand kava-making
ceremony, at the conclusion of
which there was a feast.” In
other words, a grand drunk on
stewed and brewed kava-musb and
maidens’ spittle ! And afterwards
a gorge ! There is evidently much
hope for gospel-missions that in-
clude “ kava-makmg ’’ among
their recognised and patronised
institutions. Kava and roast pig !
Who wouldn’t be an islands mis-
sionary ? Queen-shepherds and
maids-of-bonor ! And a royal
cup-bearer! Almost do they per-
suade us to be a gospel buccaneer.
The Melbourne Y.M.C. A., having arranged
for a festival at a local cricket-ground on 26th
mst., and Lord Brassey having promised bis vice-
regal presence, the Christian masters of the cere-
monies made a circular appeal as follows to mem-
bers of the pious bong-tung : “The members’
balcony has been especially reserved, as well as
retiring-room, in which afternoon tea, &c., will be
provided [‘ etcetera ’ in the retiring-room sounds
mysterious], and as the balcony will only hold
about 100 people, and the management desire to
secure the presence of suitable society to associate
with his Excellency, a limited number of tickets at
one guinea have been issued. If you are able to
accept the enclosed ticket, to admit yourself and
a lady, please reply at earliest convenience.” Cer-
tain less exalted Christians, who, although Saved,
are not suitable for Brassey, seem to have taken
affront at this circular. Which is sad indeed :
The Y.M.C. A. professes a socialistic religion
which reverences poverty and systematically curses
the rich, but its idea of what constitutes “suitable
society to associate with his Excellency ” is—the
fat person who can spare .£1 Is.
Such disgusting grovel is typical of a city in
which, almost above every other city, they have
always a welcome for the Golden Calf and never
one for the Prodigal Son.
• • •
If papers must grovel, they may as well
grovel accurately. Lord Richard Nevill and
Lady Maud Warrender are on Brassey’s staff in
Melb. The papers persistently speak of them as
“Lord Nevill” and “Lady Warrender.” They
are nothing of the kind. If Richard were “Lord
Nevill,” it would indicate that he was either a
peer or the eldest son of a peer, but, as he is only
a younger son, he is just “Lord Richard ” and no
more. The Bulletin’s superior knowledge of the
British aristocracy and its forms aud usages

A fact not hitherto stated in connection
with the disgraceful struggle of the loyal rabble at
Melb. Govt. House, on the occasion when the
visitors’ book was opened, is that in the
fight the Madden book, which was also lying on
the table, was knocked off, trampled upon, and
kicked about the floor. It is a bulky tome, and
the women who found it getting mixed up with
their legs ami petticoats, stamped on it furiously.
Finally, it was kicked out into the middle of the
entranoe-hall, where it lay until it was picked up
by a servant. And the people who did this were
those who, only a few days before, had been eat-
ing Madden’s cakes and drinking Madden’s claret-
cup ! The indecent rudeness of a loyal “ push ”is
only equalled by its ingratitude.

A correspondent enquires what has become
of case No. 1862 under a letter near the com-
mencement of the alphabet in the books of
N.S.W. divorce-court? Also, whether it is possible
to get a divorce privately in N.S.W. ? The Bul-
letin cannot answer either question though it
has heard (possibly unfounded) rumors cqnoern-
cerning such things. As the books of the divorce-
court cannot, by rule of court— i.e., by a purely
Judge-made law—be inspected without an order
from a solicitor on one side or other of a case, it
would seem that where a divorce-case doss not
appear on the published list, and has been heard
at a time when reporters cannot be expected to be
present, it can be kept perfectly dark as long as
ever the respective attorneys engaged like to keep
it dark.

Melbourne’s Mayor-elect is one Strong,
who, when the Council had chosen him, as per
previous arrangement, to succeed Mayor Snow-
den, “could not find words to express his feelings.
He was neither proud nor vain, but he thought he
had every reason for feeling proud, in being elected
by the unanimous vote of the council, to be chosen,
as it were, by the voice of the people, whose repre-
sentatives they were. It had been said that the
king could do no wrong, and he supposed that
implied that the sovereign must be right if guided
by the counsels of his advisers. So it would be
with him (Or. Strong).” The Bulletin will watch
the career of Strong with much interest. An
immediate successor to the reviled Snowden who
can fancy himself an infallible monarch, elected by
the Voice of People, ought to be well-worth watch-
ing. A tout will be hired to rise with the lark
and see Strong gallop.

Apropos the Vanderbilt- Marlborough alli-
ance, certain parties personally interested in
N.S.W. divorce-law would like Justice Wmdeyers
jurisdiction extended to the point reached in a
Vanderbilt suit tried before a N.Y. Supreme
Court less than a year ago. In that case, Alva
Vanderbilt obtained a divorce with a right to
marry again, the divorce decree at the same time
disqualifying William K. from marrying while
Alva lives.
Ever since she can
remember, Mias Emily
Meston, wlio is a Melb.
girl, and still in the early
twenties, has wished to
paint. She joined the
300 students of the Vic-
torian National Gallery
in ’9l, and studied three
years under the late Mr.
Folingsby, then director,
and Mr. McOubbin. The
third year she exhibited
at the Students’ Exhibi-
tion. She has had her
studio in Sydney the past
three years; in ’93 she
showed three pictures at
the N.S.W. Art Society’s
Exhibition ; five pictures
in ’94 and seven in ’95.
This year one of the pic-
tures—a bunch of grapes
—was bought for the
National Art Gallery of
N.S.W. In her own
opinion, her best painting
is the portrait of the Rev.
Maclnnes, now on view
at the Society of Artists’
Exhibition. Of this pic-
ture The Bulletin lias
already remarked that it
is probably the best and
strongest portrait yet
painted in Australia by
a woman. MissMeston’s
work is her life ; the pic-
ture she is painting takes
complete possession of
her ; she works from four
to six hours daily, but
her picture haunts her
mind always. She hasn’t
seen the Melbourne Art
Gallery for three years;
when she was last there
her fancy was mostly
taken with the picture of
“Ulyssesand the Sirens.”
Among the Sydney Art
Gallery’s collection she
was chiefly impressed by
“The Spring,” “The
Snake Charmer,”
“ Circe,” and “ The Horse Bazaar.”

Major-Gen. Hutton declined to allow the
Permanent Artillery band to play in connection
with the Sydney Eight-hours’ Day, on the ground
that the celebration was a political one. A
doubtful reason. Six months ago, he ruled that
the band might play for hire wherever asked, so
long as no conflict with duties was entailed, and
gave as his ground that such bands enjoyed such
liberties all over the world. This, again, is in-
sufficient as a reason. But withal, he is more
consistent than the Eight-hour people, who first
objected to the band playing in competition with
unemployed musicians, and next applied to have
it play at their own ceremony.

The pending Marlborough - Vanderbilt
wedding has provided Melb. papers with a text
for long and caustic sermons on democratic
America’s adoration of titles. The aristocratic
Britisher’s adoration of dollars doesn’t seem to be

remark. The Age that visits the sins of a Van-
derbilt on “democratic America,” must accept
Benjamin Benjamin, MTntyre, and Snowden as
good “democratic Australian” types.

And glared at all creation. Rain and sun,

Planning his ruin. “ Let there not be owed
One pious rite,” he said, “lest I who sowed
So well, be ere the reaping quite undone
By floods, or drought, or fraud too fine to shun !”
Forthwith he reckoned all his ledger showed :
Then rose with face demure and gravely took
(First locking fast his gold and books of trade)
From its due place of state the Holy Book,
Chose the fit passage, slowly stept downstairs,
And called the shop-boy and his one small maid
With proud humility to evening prayers.

W.J. ; Judge Windeyer suggested (see daily
press reports) that the jury might find Dean guilty with
a recommendation to mercy. Yet he surely knew that if
Dean was guilty, his case was so atrocious as to deserve
no shadow of mercy. He also ought to have known that
the recommendation counted for nothing, because only a
few weeks before Williams and Montgomery, for a mere
assault with no definite murderous premeditation, were
hanged, despite such a recommendation. No man who
was sure that Dean had deliberately tried to poison his wife
in childbirth could logically recommend that monster to
mercy; such a recommendation could hardly be made
except by a jury that wasn’t sure and was afraid of Us soul

The Mutual Life Association of Australasia
considers that The Bulletin did it a serious injustice in
its issue of 17th August, and again last week, when it
mentioned that the Association’s “last balance-sheet
shows no reserve whatever ” for depreciation of securities.
Tub Bulletin fails to see where the injustice comes in,
hut it desires to state the circumstances as fully and fairly
as possible. The Mutual Life Association this year wrote
£5270 off the valuation of its assets to provide for depre-
ciation. Last year it wrote off £16,283 for the same pur-
pose, and it makes a larger or smaller allowance every
year, presumably sufficient to cover any falling-off in this
respect. As Tub Bulletin remarked in reviewing the
Association’s last report, it “ wisely makes provision for
depreciation as it goes along.” The Mutual Life Associa-
tion is preparing to put its valuation on a 3J per cent,
basis, like the A.M.P., and unlike moat of its other busi-
ness rivals. It Ins already made large reserves for this
purpose. The fact that the Mutual Life is about lo take
this valuable precaution is much to its credit, and the
sooner other societies do the same the better it will be for
their policyholders.

The N.S.W. loan of £4,000,000 went off in
London at £96 18s. 3d. Allowing for the “ accrued in-
terest ” the price is, roughly, £96 Bs. 9d., and after
deducting stamp-duty, and estimating the expenses on
the lowest scale, the province will get something like 195
net for each £lOO. Under these circumstances, the fact
that N.S.W. has floated what is nominally the cheapest
loan ever issued by an Australasian province doesn’t
amount to very much after all. Making allowance for
the loss of £5 on every £lOO at repayment 40 years hence,
the cost of the loan is £3 ss. Bd. per cent. The province’s
4 per cent, debentures with an 18 years’ currency are now
worth £llO 10s. in the Sydney market, which, allowing
for the loss to the holder on redemption, means that they
are worth about £3 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum. In the
case of a local issue, the saving in expenses of manage-
ment, the work being done locally by the Treasury in-
stead of by a bank as in London, and the further saving
in cost of remitting interest, are additional advantages.
Therefore, there seems no reason to believe that the
London market, despite all the glare and whoop about
Mr. Reid’s great financial operation, has done anything
which the local market, with decent management, couldn't
have done better.
• ♦ * *
The new N.S.W. Civil Service Act provides
that all future Stale employes must insure their lives.
But it doesn’t provide any State institution or any Stale-
guaranteed and State-audited private institution in which
they can insure. It simply compels them to pay annually
into a possibly-rotten office-for no one outside each
office, and only a few inside, really know whether it
is rotten or not—a considerable proportion of their earn-
ings. If the office bursts at last, and the widow and
children of the deceased C.S. are left destitute, they will
have good reason to ask the Government to refund the
premiums (with compound interest) which it com-
pelled the old man to pay, and which are now so
very badly W’anted. Why not create a State Life
Insurance Department, and compel the civil servants
to insure in that? In the circumstances the De-
partment, under moderately good management,
would be the best thing of its kind in Australasia —the
A.M.P. Society not excepted. It would have, say, 30,000
reliable clients. It would need to pay no commission, or
travelling expenses, or advertising charges to get their
business. It would incur no expense in collecting pre-
miums ; the Treasury would deduct the premium from
each man's salary and send it along. It wouldn’t need
any stupendous office to impress the public with. It
could invest all its money in State and good municipal
securities, in its own office property, and in loans on its
own policies, and thus save the vast amount of clerical
and legal wmrk involved in investments on mortgage, and
also most of the big losses through “ depreciation,” which
come along every now and then and make such ghastly
holes in the profits.
With all these expenses saved the State institu-
tion, under a clever insurance expert, should get along by
spending something like 4 per cent, of its income in
expenses. The A.M.P. Society spends nearly 9 per cent.,
and other Australasian offices anything up to 30 per
cent. And though the Government denartment, by
avoiding the somewhat shaky mortgage business, would
probably not realise more than £4 per cent, on its funds,
whereas the other offices average £5 Bs., the saving in
expenses and in depreciation should enable it to pay the
biggest bonuses in Australasia. With its compulsory
civil-service business it would be independent of outside
support, but it would take as much outside support as it
could get without paying commission to agents. The
public would gradually learn of its existence, and come
to it with their proposals ; the large profits and the State
security would be sufficient advt. If Premier Reid lets
this chance slide he will have missed the biggest oppor-
tunity of his career.

Maoriland Government is going to transfer its
London financial business—inscription of loans, payment
of interest, flotation of new loans, &c. from the Bank of
England to the 8.N.Z., and thus the annual payment of
£14,000 a year, instead of going to a purely English insti-
tution, will go to assist one that is at least partly local.
The other provinces should follow this example, if they
are not prepared to conduct the business at the Agent-
Generals’ offices, and thus a great many thousands per
an. would go to support local concerns. The 8.N.5.W.,
National of Australasia, Bank of Victoria, Bank of Ade-
laide, Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney, Commercial of
Australia, Q.N.8., and many others have London offices
where they could represent their respective provinces
with as much dignity as is needed and scoop in the com-
mission in a thankful frame of mind.

The Federal Bank liquidation is getting on
slowly. When it closed its doors the late Munro institu-
tion had £202,214 in hand, and it has since collected
£320,419 from its creditors and only £42,348 from share-
holders, making £564,981. After paying notes and the
Government's preferential claims the creditors have had
£210,000 in dividends, and ttiere are £1,250,000 still due
them. The remaining assets are nominally £1,500,000,
but if they realise half that amount they will do about as
well as can be expected.

The Mutual Life Association issues a new table
under which it is possible to insure by paying only half the
usual rate for the first five years. This is a great con-
venience to those who want to get the largest amount of
insurance for the smallest immediate cost. Other offices
do the same variety of business, hut the Mutual Life
Association has extended the principle further than
usual by applying it not only to whole-life, but also to
limited premium and endowment assurances.

The blank folly of the Victorian bankruptcy
system, under which any person may set up in business
as a trustee in insolvency, and b“ entrusted with the
winding-up of estates, and do very much as he pleases,
was badly shown up in a recent application for the re-
moval of one of the rapacious tribe. This individual had
charge of the estate of a bankrupt importer. The assets
realised £497, and as the trustee charged £533 for col-
lecting them there was nothing left for anybody save
himself. As a rule, no single creditor takes the trouble
to move in such a case, and the trustee has a pleasant
time, but the present instance moved an aggravated
bank to action. The trustee got into the box and pro-
tended to explain. He paid one clerk a salary of £2 10s.
a week, and charged the estate £6 a week for his services.
He paid one of his sons £l, and another 15s. per week,
and he charged the estate £6 a week for their combined
services. Whether the estate got their whole services, or
wheiher they were being also charged against other
estates at the same tim», didn’t appear. According to
the trustee “it was the custom” to do those things,
which assertion is probably true. An ndvrUsng
account of £l4 10s. was charged, by “ a slip of the pen,”
as£2o 4<. Finally, the trustee had taken the a-counts
aw-ay with him to a remot- part of Gippsland, so that the
estate and all information connected therewith practically
vanished. Yet the court only disallowed the more glaring
Items in the bill, and made an order for £lO 10s. costs.
Another Melbourne trustee has just been re-
moved from the charge of a large insolvent estate for the
simple and beautiful reason that he has disappeared
altogether, and no one knows where ’e are. How the
estate, or any other estates in his charge, had got on
under these conditions wasn’t explained. If the other
departments of the law were run in the same helter-
skelter fashion, and it became necessary to appoint a new
judge every few days, on the ground that an old one had

St. Joseph’s Investment and Building Society,
of Sydney, has also arranged to reduce deposit interest
from sto 3 percent. A rather desolate report was pre-

senting £57,000 are still paying up interest and instal-
ments of principal as they become due. On about
£40,000 the society is getting interest with tolerable
regularity. The other £156,000 represents foreclosed
properties. Therefore, St. Joseph’s is loaded with un-

Game out of the Premier Permanent smash with something
over five figures to the bad. Some recent strictures, no
doubt, moved him to adjourn the Mirams action with
scant ceremony, “in order that it may be taken by
another Judge." This formula has become a regular
thing now. Every Melb. Judge is more or less unfitted
to adjudicate upon any financial case without the bias of
personal circumstances, or a suspicion of it, creeping in ;

the shares through the jobbers, so far they have not met

A sample Coolgardie boom wire : “ The Kings-
ley Hill mine, Broad Arrow, has been sold to the London
and South African 00., of which Mr. Cecil Rhodes is
managing director. Mr. H. Rice has also a large interest
in the lode”—[We know Rhodes, but who is Rice?] —
" which is 53ft. wide, and four different assayers in Cool-
gardie gave results varying from IJoz. to 30oz. to the
ton.” The variation is considerable, but if we strike the
mean we get an average of over 150 z., and, bear in mind,
the reef is 53ft, widel One nan quite understand Cecil
Khodes’ action, and see the reason of the recent
slump in South African shares. True, they turn out there
over 200,0000 z. a month, but they have about 3000 stamps
at work, and what would this mine turn out with 3000
stamps? Say (allowing 120 tons weekly for each 10 head)
540,0000 z. a week, or tivo millions sterling—£loo,ooo,ooo
a year. The Bulletin is tempted to speck ten bob in
that mine.

other W.A. fields and published in the Eastern dailies had
been true, then gold would be cheaper to-day than lead-

The famous Madame Berry mine has put up a
world’s alluvial div. record of £900,000, while close on
£150,000 has gone in a 7J and 9 per cent, royalty to the
Seven Hills estate owners, chiefly the defunct Martin
Loughlin and W. Bailey, Ballarat’s “Scotch” horsey
man, whose annual cut tots up £lO,OOO. Although
Madame seems to be on the wane—the last block of the
rich southern gutter was lately taken out—the chances
are that the Ristori West run of wash will be met with in
the small section of untried ground now being pros-
pected. In tier palmy days Madame paid 10s. a month
per share. Biggest holder, A. J. Sprague, a Melb. man.
Altogether Madame has been kind to original scrippers,
each 17s. 9d. paid-up share having returned £46 odd.
Berry Consols, 95th div. of 2s. Gold won,
136,3840 z. ; divs., £237,000; royalty (74) paid, £43,000.
Long worked rich ground at No.’l shaft nearly exhausted,
but the bores.abotit a mile away have proved a big body
of wash to exist there. At No. 2 shaft, near where, in
deep ground, it is thought the Australasian lead has been
located, the wash is turning out well. This lead spreads
out to a tremendous width. A big area yet to work with
decidedly favorable prospects.
Another 40ft. driving should land the Berry
Consols Extended in the gold-bearing country which
dipped underfoot from a rise from west main level.
B fore dipping the gutter panned out 12oz. to the
machine, and if it lives up to that richness when located
again shareholders will not regret their long call-paying
era.

Working Miners Homebush Co., at Mary-

New field between Orbost and Bendoe, in the
Croajingolong district, promises well; Govt, mining in-
pector Sharpe names it as the best Gippsland find since
Long Tunnel, and it extends overa wide belt of auriferous
country. Chief mine, Ace of Clubs, has a 4ft. lode,
picked up a few chains off a 7in. lode discovered by learn-
ing. The Bairnsdale R.C. priest has pegged out a claim.
At Caasilis, near Omeo, several shows are turn-
ing out 3oz. stone, with an occasional break of Boz.
thin, and until deep level permanency assured, public
hold off this as well as the Glen Wills field.
Some smart Melb. men have taken up big slices
of alluvial country at Drouin. Good gold got in the
shallow', and bores will shortly prospect for the rich deep
gutter supposed to exist.

Wired that “miners, mechanics, and laborers”
are in demand at Coolgardie. No doubt a repetition of
the Broken Hill hoom experience, when hundreds of
W'orkmen took to stock-jobbing. While shares mounted,
of course, they did well ; after that—well, they had to
slink back to work in the mines. And then the’eompeti-
tion began. It may pay Eastern miners to remember
that.

Mailed from London to Bulletin :—“ The
market here is still very good for W.A. mines, and things
in the Hannan’s district are now- on the boom. Oiher
districts are not so much sought after—notably, the
Murchison. It would be a hard matter lo place a Mur-
chison mine here now, even with the present boom.
People do not care for that region, as the bat teries are not
realising anticipations. It is hard to tell how long the
boom will last, but it looks to me as if there ought to he
an end to it soon, as people are getting filled up with this
sort of stuff, and when the time comes for unloading there
will be a colossal scramble. Everybody is bull now, there
are no bears in the field, and it is not safe to sell, no
matter how bad a thing is. People buy the bad stock
because it is cheap, and raise the price on you should you
undertake to bear it.”

The late magnificent return from the Lake
Austin mine (the Island, W.A.) of 330 z. from all stone on
hand up to date has somewhat spoilt the rush for the
spoil on the Murchison, although one English 00. there
continues to buy right and left.

Pettigrew, formerly manager of the Maritana,
W.A., asserts that the formation on the east side of the
hill was discovered by him 18 months ago, and reported
to the directors as a lode 15ft. wide, averaging 2oz.

Bitten years ago

for a recent ga-

One prominent journalist on a Melb. daily
was particularly incensed at Trenwith’s recent
allusion to the average pressman as a “literary

name.
Premier Kingston has got a cable from the

W. J. Trickett, M. L.C., at Sydney Town
Hall meeting in April last : —“ If Dean be guilty,
he should have had no mercy, but should have
been hung, drawn, and quartered.” Some men
will never obtain what others think are their
deserts.
The more or less native-born figure-head
of a “great ” Australian daily : “I am proud to
say I shall never forget I am an Englishman.”
Hard-up Australian scribe: “ I don’t suppose you
will—while you can collar thousands of pounds’
worth of free matter from English newspapers
every year and let me starve.”
Before Dean had been 24 hours out of gaol
the show-fiends were after him with proposals to
put him upon itinerant exhibition. As high as
■£4o a week is said to have been offered, and, even
at that figure—judging by the way the gobemouches
rushed the Wallaby and the police-courts—there
ought to have been a gold-mine in the thing.
Parson Fitchett, the editor-preacher, who
mouths about laying his daily work at God’s feet
—for revision, we suppose—refers to Lane’s Cosme
settlement as “ A Mendicant Utopia.” Which is
pretty good from an official head of the greatest
begging organisation with which the world is
oppressed.
Major-Gen. Hutton, who has just emu-

Mark Twain was so delighted with Marcus
Clarke’s “For the Term of His Natural Life”
that he devoted himself to getting all Clarke’s
books. He has got a complete set with
the exception of “Long Odds,” which is at

in which Clarke —who knew nothing about sport-
ing matters —made a filly win the Derby.
Justice Williams (Vic.) has answered the
uproar of criticism of his new religion, in a little
lecture on Mrs. Grundy. His Honor abuses the
old lady, and again held up his noble exemplar,
George Higinbothara, as a man who followed the
right and dusted his boots with the sacred robes
of Mrs. G. But how does Hartley Williams,
K.C.M.G., account for his bauble, his Imperial
ringworm, if it is not the badge of Mrs. Grundy,
and a sign to his fellows that her fat patronage
and husky blessing are a joy and comfort to his
soul ?
It is averred that George Rignold, when
first he thought about producing a Biblical play,
asked several friends, who professed to have read
the Bible, what particular part of it would be
appropriate. The story most strongly urged upon
him, ere lie fixed on Joseph, was that of the
Prodig d Sun. George didn’t quite know what
the Pr idigal Son did in particular, but he asked
questions, and ascertained that the principal
character would have to live for a time amongst
swine, and eat the husks which the swine did eat.
That killed th ■ project. George barred associating
with pigs, but why didn’t he play the Fatted
Calf?

Nireaha, a Maori
of nearly 21-stone,
appeared as a witness
recently at Pahiatua
(M.L.). His dimen-
sions almost pre-
vented him getting
through the doorway,
and it was proposed
at first to take his
evidence on the foot-
path. When he did
get in, all efforts to
put him in the wit-
ness-box failed, and
he had to be sworn
standing on the floor
of the court.
Emanuel Abra-
hams, the Melb, gun-
mark forger, being
wanted as an insol-
vency witness, seems
to have started a new
and comprehensive
disease to keep him
out of court. Accord-
ing to a doctor’s evi-
dence, all Emanuel’s
“ higher faculties are
in abeyance and he is
intellectually no bet-
ter than a beast.”

allow witness time to

question wants an-
swering here: What
kind of “higher
faculties ” did Eman-
uel have to start
with ?
It was endeavored to get up a press recep-
tion to Mark Twain in Adelaide, but the reporters
objected either to advertise themselves at Mark’s
expense or to advertise him at their expense.

The Sketch on Parkes’s sonnets :
It is a valiant little book, full of fresh, youthful enthu-
siasms, and evidence of mental and physical health. Will
any of our age-worn, weary young poets ever be able to
write an autobiographical sonnet called “Four Score,”
and in this temper?—
I count the mercifullest part of all
God’s mercies, in this coil of eighty years,
Is that no sense of being disappears
Or fails.
Apropos, there is a shriekingly-funny lie current
just now about the evident non-failure of one
sense of the virile old gentleman’s being.
Mr. A. W. Eales, who was bom at Duck-
enfield, Morpeth, N.S. W., barely 22 years ago, ia
incomparably the best shot of his age in Australia
and at present the best in N.S W. He began
shooting when 13 years old. He was elected a
member of the M.S. W. Gun Club in ’93, and was
put on the 26yds. mark. Since then he has won
more trophies than any other member, and has
never drawn less than £5O out of an open handi-
cap. Last Dec. he killed 66 out of 69 birds off
29yds.; last April, 50 running off 30yds.; a week
later, another consecutive 50 off 31yds. ; in
Sept., 42 off 30yds., and the same day
54 out of 55 off 30yds. Last week he
eclipsed himself by winning N.S. Wales
Gun Club cup, with nine kills off 32yds., and by
directly afterwards killing 16
birds off 34yds. This last dis-
tance is the new club limit, and
Mr. Eales is the first man in Aus-
tralian pigeon - shooting to merit
the distinction of deserving it. Carver,
Brewer, and Clark, never shot in com-
petition behind 32yds. Another feature of Eales’s
last brilliant performance is that he deserved
every bird he brought down —there was no luck
in it —only hard, clean shooting. It has often
been said that every morning, at Duckenfield, Mr.
Eales kills his 25 birds in practice, but he denies
ever shooting at pigeons during the last six months
except in matches. He has considerable field-
shooting, however.
“Possum” Dean, the poisoner, had his
fortune told recently, and the fortune-teller’s in-
criminating document was found in his pocket
when he was arrested. He had received it the
same day, and it ran thus :
Reading from a photo, of George Dean, Esq. : —The face
shows you to be active, energetic and industrious. You
have the powers of grasping an idea quickly, and putting
it in lucid form. lam afraid your trouble is not yet over.
You are true hearted, and a very loyal friend. You will
succeed very well in life. Although you have had sorrow,
much brightness will yet come into your life, for you are
honorable, upright and brave in all your dealings. One
who would scorn to be guilty of a mean action either
for popularity or gain, who would respect your elders and
be courteous to all. You are fond of animals, and love
fresh air and exercise of games. You have a strong will,
and are extremely independent.
Had Dean been able to “grasp an idea quickly”
he would long since have grasped the idea that he
ought to be in Chili.
John Haynes is the most robust humorist
of N.S.W. Assembly. Long ago something was
said in debate about a bucket of unpleasantness
having been thrown over an individual to whom
the Govt, of the day had been making a grant or
giving a billet, or something. “ I remember the
occurrence well,” said Haynes, “ and it was nob
unearned ‘increment,’ either.” Only he didn’t
say increment.
Gov. Hopetoun used to twit Murray Smith
with his alliance with Max Hirsoh, the Single-
taxer. “ How can you, Mr. Smith,” the shaven
Gov. used to say, “ stand on the same platform as
a man who advocates robbery?” Smith used to
squirm and feel awkward. He says himself that
it made his relations with Hopetoun uncomfort-
able.
The Dean curse, if there is to be one, has
started out well with Dean’s adopted father, good
old Deutscher Konneoke, of Woollahra, who,

CUSTOMER: “ Right you are , Tottie —let him he tried by a jury of

after expending his substance on his protege, has
been almost killed by the discovery of the truth,
which he would not at first accept, even upon
Dean’s own testimony. Man’s faith in man will
evidently outlive the cynicism which pretends
that it has no existence.

So inextricably are politics interwoven with the adminis-
tration of justice.
But why should the Attorney-General be a politi*
cal officer ?
Dr. MacLaurin? M.L.C., opposes the Land-
tax in N.S.W. because the Maoriland tax, as he
asserts, costs .£30,000 a year in expenses of collec-
tion. As a matter of fact, the M.L. Land and
Income-taxes cost, at the highest estimate, about
iG17,000 a year for collection, including the charges
of the periodical assessment.

If the minimum for N.S.W. Income-tax
be fixed at £l5O, it is unlikely, despite a general
opinion among M.sL.A. to the contrary, that
their Parliamentary allowance of £3OO will
remain untouched. Several members hold that
electioneering expenses, direct and indirect, when
deducted from the £3OO, will leave them still out-
side the taxation area. But if this plea be set up,
it will undoubtedly be taken to the courts and dis-
allowed. In Tasmania the Chief-Justice has ruled
that electioneering expenses cannot be allowed
against an Income-tax claim.
N.S.W. Justice Stephen’s original six
months’ leave on full pay expired on Aug. 12.
Does he still draw full pay? Judges’ liberties
and privileges appear to awe every class of Aus-
tralian politicians.
Taverner, Vic. Minister of Agriculture,
about the best-abused man in the Turner Ministry,
got level with his political antagonists the other

were in power they went about the country eating
turkeys; I export them.”
As Angus Cameron says, re the vaunted
N.S.W. Public Service Regulation Bill: “Ecclesi-
astical and social influence are as noxious as
political influence if allowed to affect appoint-
ments in the public service.” There are thousands
in the public service who owe nothing to the poli-
tician, but who came over the wall of “faith ” on
one side or eminent social intercession on the
other.
Of late, the uncompromising-single-tax
party has been little heard from. Two years
ago no newspaper-controversy ever started with-
out the single tax people chipping in and nointing
out that the remedy lay in Georgeism. Had the
Dean affair occurred a couple of years since, the
whole thing would have been settled by a refer-
ence to “Progress and Poverty,” signed “Yours
truly, W. E. Johnston,” or “Percy R. Meggy,”
or words to that effect.
It didn’t take long to thrust Garrick out
of Q. Agent-Generalship, in which Acting-A.-G.
Dicken is a mere warming-pan ; but Govt, hasn’t
yet appointed a successor to Judge Harding. The
obvious course is to remove Chubb or Cooper from
Townsville to Brisbane, and give Paul, or Noel,
or Miller a step up to a Supreme Court at Rock-
hampton. But it isn’t the course that appeals to
Kanakaland diplomacy. Besides, Minister
Philp’s Townsville seat is shaky now, and a lioness
robbed of her whelps is nothing to Townsville
robbed of an official.
N.S.W. Legislative Council, though it
may mutilate Reid’s direct taxation proposals,
presents no such hostile front to such measures as
it has done in the recent past. Ten years ago it
contemptuously threw out Jennings’ Bill for a
land-tax, two years later a similar Bill sent up by
the Parkes Government, and Dibbs’ Income-tax
Bill of a couple of years ago. On these occasions
it was impossible to get more than half the mem-
bers of the Council to attend. For the Parkes
Bill only seven voted, while for those of Jennings
and Dibbs only seven votes stand recorded.
Maoriland, like Victoria, has been wallow-
ing through the long, dismal job of revising the
tariff. The result isn’t satisfactory. A lot of the
members know something of one industry only.
A lot more have no practical knowledge of any
industry whatever. Sometimes a whole batch of
duties would be fixed when the only man who had
any practical knowledge of the subject was away,
and when the member who professed to know
about it, but who had got all his information
upside-down, was unhappily present. Then the
other man who thought lie knew about it also,
but who had got his information inside-out, would
arrive later on, and supply a lot more valuable
ignorance on the subject, only a different kind of
ignorance from the previous lot, and get the item
recommitted and altered, so that instead of being
bow-legged as it was before, it would become
knock-kneed instead. And when all the solicitors,
squatters, farmers, financial-agents, merchants,
and auctioneers had finished telling each other
about industries they had never seen, and about
machinery they had never heard of, they fixed up
a tariff which is about as good as might be ex-
pected under the circumstances.
South Australia
commenced a systematic
plan of planting and con-
serving forests 19 years
ago. The expenditure up
to date has been £129,000,
while the revenue has
been .£115,000, and the
forests now existing are
reckoned as being worth
<£loB,ooo. The deficit
was confined to the early
days of the system, and
now the annual revenue
exceeds the expenditure
by =£3ooo. N.S. Wales
has had a forest conserva-
tion system for 22 years,
and in 1893 (the last year
for which statistics are
available) the revenue of
the department was £9546
and the expenditure
.£19,459, salaries and
travelling expenses alone
coming to nearly£ 14,000!
When <£50,000 has been
‘ blewed ” in one year
for thinning, how on
eart/i will the account
stand ?
The anti-vaccination
movement is growing in
Victoria. In that pro-
vince vaccination is com-
pulsory; in N.S.W. it is
purely optional. The
result in 1892 was that
there were no deaths from
smallpox in Victoria,
while in N.S.W. there
was only one. Vaccina-
tion is a dirty and dan
gerous practice, which
often results in the trans-
mission of loathsome
diseases, and the results
of the compulsory system
apparently are not worth
the risk. It probably
prevents smallpox to a
considerable extent, and
therefore it was useful
and valuable in the in-
sanitary past; but small-
pox, like most other epi-
demics, arises mostly
from dirt and stupidity, and with a little atten’
tion to cleanliness it has become almost extinct.
Vaccination now-a-days seems to be a habit, or
a species of Joss, more than anything else.
A Bill now before Vic. Assembly authorises
women to vote, on the same basis as men, at elec-
tions for the Leg. Assembly only. The Council
is to be elected by male property franchise as
heretofore. This suggests the possibility of a
really great experiment. Let the Council be
elected by manhood suffrage, if such a reform can
be brought about, while the Assembly is elected
on manhood and womanhood suffrage. Then give
the two houses co-ordinate powers, and after that
let the person who is responsible for the experi-
ment conceal himself in the hills till he sees how it
is going to pan out.
Some one nearly broke up a Vic. political
banquet by handing in a bogus telegram to the
effect that the Melbourne market had collapsed,
burying many people in the ruins, and in its fall
had carried away the viaduct, thus causing the
wreck of a passenger-train and horrible carnage.
Another train had fallen into the gap on top of
the first one, and its boiler had burst, and then
the ruins had taken fire, and a sickening odor of
burning passenger had spread all over the city.
Unluckily, the hoax was discovered, so this well-
meant effort to shut off the usual dreary speech
about the great future of Victoria failed of its
purpose.
A cheeky British person named Evans,
who collects stamps, has lodged a complaint with
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies,
that Postmaster-General Cook is reprinting old
N.S.W. stamps and selling them. Therefore the
market is becoming over-supplied with ancient
N.S.W. stamps, and the value of specimens,
which were once rare and valuable, is seriously
diminished. P.M.G. Cook tersely replies that he
is doing so for the good of the N.S.W. revenue,
and apparently intends to continue at the work.
Consequently the British person named Evans
will have to simmer down. N.S.W. can go on
issuing its own stamps as long as it pleases.
Not one of the Freetrade-party in Vic.
Assembly holds his principles consistently. Every
man of them makes an exception in favor of some
industry carried on in his own constituency.
Frank Madden (Eastern Suburbs) is a Freetrader
except as to pipeclay ; Bowen (Wangaratta) seeks
special protection for Victorian-grown tobacco;
Mackenzie (Broadford) advocates protection on
strawboard ; Le.vien (Barwon) tries to protect fish
and bananas; Squatter Staughton (West Bourke)
advocates stiff duties on explosives ; J. S. White
(Albert Park) goes in for protecting hat-nets ; and
so on. The Victorian Freetrader would clap 25
per cent, on Sin if the Devil had a factory in his
electorate.
“A distinguished member of the bar in
a neighboring province—a gentleman who has
held the highest official rank in that province”
(Madden? Way? Griffith?) —“has written com-
plimenting Salomons, Q.C., and expressing the
opinion that he was fully within his professional
rights in divulging the statement made to him by
attorney Meagher re Dean. “ I was so sorry to
see the Commission granted in the first instance,
but your brave conduct and the resolute action of
Mr. Want in backing you up have brought good
out of evil.” And there you have the cat out of
the bag ! All the lawyers are so sorry that the
eccentricities of “ legal ” justice should have been
reviewed by laymen. Hence many things.
Old Man Parkes has retired from the
contest for the seat which Meagher lost
through breathing his great secret into the
ear of Salomons. Copeland and one Dr. Hodg-
son are also in the field. From all present
appearances, however, the seat is lost to Protec-
A BEEF.
NEW-CHUM MINER (he left Collins-street to prospect) : “ Haw — my

tionist Copeland, who, all things considered, is by
far the best of the bunch. Meagher was a Protec-
tionist, and that practically settles the case. That
fallen solicitor might have done one good turn to
his party by joining the Reid crowd when he felt
the earth slipping beneath his feet; then he would
have divided his disgrace equally between the two
parties, and given them a fair run for his seat. As
it is, dozens of people voted the Protectionist
ticket last election because Meagher defended
Dean, and many moro dozens will be converted to
Freetrade this election for the same reason. The
mental attitude of many voters is simply : “Pro-
tection ain’t no good ; look at Meagher ! ”
Another Redmond Barry story. A sailor
speaking very low in court was told he would be
committed for contempt if he didn’t speak up.
Sailor responded in speaking - trumpet tones.
Barry, thinking he was being guyed, committed
the sailor forthwith. It took counsel a full quarter-
hour to smooth Barry’s ruffled dignity and explain
that sailors’ voices have no middle-register.
Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs. Tooth and Co., Kent
Brewery, are the Sydney agents.
In these days, when people in Sydney a*e
positively pestered with photographers advertising
by means of phrases well calculated to startle and
to attract those who run as they read, it is well to
remember that, after all, the value of what is
artistic is certainly not gauged by quantity or
measurement, and, as photographers should be
possessed of artistic merit, their true value depends
on the quality of their work. At the present
juncture, Sydney is highly favored, as we see
photographic galleries charging rates for work of
a class which, in any city of the old world, would
command a price double that charged here. The
work of several firms, notably Charlemont and
Co., of George-street, Sydney, is known and
highly appreciated all over Australasia. The
prices charged are such as will certainly cause to
be distributed through the community photo-
graphs of a high order of merit. Charlemont and
Co.’s rooms and studio are all that is to be
desired, and make easy the despatch of a large
volume of business. This firm’s work is worth
inspection.*

More rushes in N.W. Westralia. A Chinaman

John had three horses which he wanted to sell; he

Dally Bros. (5), original owners of the great
Tasmania mine, after sluicing the decomposed portion of
the reef and grassing all intruding solid quartz, sold out
for £5OOO and an interest. The ore won by the Daliys
yielded £BOOO to the purchasing co. This, the co.’s first
streak of luck, was followed by the cheap acquisition of
the Golden Gate and Florence Nightingale, two rich West
and adjoining sections. After_ this, on the East, the
Lefroy, whose crosscut was within three feet of the reef,
sickened, and was taken over by the boss 00. Also
Daily’s United (now a valuable property) fell into its
hands ; and last, not least, the Phcenix, with a big lump
of underlay, which she was too poor to reach, amalga-
mated. Further, the Tasmania leases cover all alluvial.

Dear Bulletin, — “Tag. miners do not love
John. They had enough of him on the E. Coast tin-
fields,” &c. Your remarks imply censure—not all
deserved. John ousted the tin-miner by organisation
and dogged perseverance. He worked hard for his
money, but had to go without credit for his virtues
because he had vices and was yellow. True, John smoked
opium and played fanian and ran lotteries day and night,
but there was method always in his madness. He never
neglected his work. He didn’t work spasmodically for a
fortnight, and then drink and wallow in all manner of
filth for the balance of the month, and go back to his
camp to inveigh against every man not out on strike
while he was on the spree. No ;he fed well, supported a
large percentage of non-producing Chows, paid tribute to
the Europeans, and had money to spare 1 Honor to him,
though we “chuck him out, the brute.”—Yours in the

The wire-rope question is troubling the Northern

result of rapid or continuous bending. This process takes
place particularly at the portion of the rope just clear of
the pulley and at the shoe—especially in shafts using
buckets. It is suggested that ten or fifteen feet be cut off
the rope every few months —thus removing the most
defective portions.

Dear Bulletin, —I am a New England selector
and do more than a bit in shooting wallabies and trap-
ping opossums. There is something rotten about certain
of the salesmen-agents in Sydney. The prices quoted in
the papers are merely delusive to people like me. There
are no thicker-furred ’possums in N.S.W. than up here in
this severe climate. ’Possums here don’t fool about,
sitting in the forks of trees. Consequently, “rumpers”
are few. But they abound in our sale-accounts. Last lob
of 'possums I sent in—some hundreds—l culled severely.
Everything which could possibly be fancied to be
“rumped” I kept back, and tanned for rugs for own
use. My account-sales came along all the same. Fifty
rumpers—exactly 50, mark you—at less than Is. per doz.
Top market quotation, 10s. per doz. Of my lot, a re-
markably even parcel, less than 50 fetched Bs. lid. per
doz., then so many 6s. 9d., and so on in batches of 70, 30,
5, &c.— so very exact, you see, down to 3s. per doz.
Then I sent, say, 50 wallaby skins. Got an account sales
of 50 skins right enough. Top market quotation, 18s. per
doz. at the time. Half-a-dozen, say, of mine “fetched ”
15s. 6d. per doz., and little batches down to 2d. each. One
excellent feature is that a couple of doz., say, are set down
at nominal prices as being “ shot-holed.” Singular, con-
sidering that I don’t use a shot-gun. Every wallaby was
shot by me with a rifle! Per contra, I didn’t send a
single kangaroo or wallaroo skin, that lot, but I got a
return-sales for just my right number of wallabies, divided
into kangaroos and wallaroos, at bigger prices than
wallaby skins would bring. Then, again, I am
charged “rail” expenses for a parcel sent by sea.
I have tried two different firms, and my returns
have always been flagrant humbug and glaringly
“faked.” But what am I to dot Selectors are
completely at the mercy of these auctioneer-agents.
The direct commission charges they make are but 5 per
cent. Nothing can be clearer on the face of some of my
accounts rendered for small batches than that these
ostensible charges don’t pay for the clerical work of
making out the documents. I tell you that according to
my experience there is crooked work in the alleged prices
which the skins fetch. If ’possum-skins are quoted in
reports furnished to the papers by Sydney selling
agents at 10s. 6d. for top-greys—the best sort—and 1 send
in a picked lot of 50doz. of the finest greys that New Eng-
land produces, pegged out in tip-top style, all trapped
and not a shot-hole in a skin, and every skin the least
shade thin-furred in any part thrown out when making
up the parcel, I am lucky if I receive ss. per doz. on the

holed.—Smith.
George Dibbs is the first N.S.W. ex-
Premier to take a subordinate post under Govt.
One, James Martin, took a Chief-Justiceship; and
two, Charles Cowper and William Forster,
became Agents-General, but although the Agent-
Generalship is in the Civil Service, the three ex-
Premiers named passed on to positions of respon-
sibility and influence rather above than below that
of a temporary Premiership. This shows the
natural modesty of Dibbs, or proves the truth of
the old adage that “ needs must when the devil
drives.”
The boyish-looking Earl of Shaftesbury,
one of Brassey’s aidekongs, is a grandson of the
noted philanthropist of that ilk. One of the most
touching episodes in the life of the latter was
when the Oovent Garden costers, overflowing
with gratitude at the efforts of his lordship to
ameliorate their lot, subscribed among themselves
and presented him with —a donkey, flhe youthful
earl should feel a responsive thrill when he visits
Sydney Zoo and sees the donkey that cost the
N.S.W. taxpayer £300,000.
It is a somewhat startling fact that Mr.
Darley, in his dual capacity of N.S.W, Chief
Justice and Acting-Governor, draws the third
highest amount in the way of salary among
officials, excluding royalties, in the entire British
empire. The highest salary is that of the Gov.-
General of India, £25,000; the Lord-Lieut. of
Ireland takes £20,000 ; then come the English
ambassador at Paris with £lO,OOO, and the Lord
Chancellor with £6OOO for his chancellorship and
£4OOO for Speakership of the Lords. There are
other salaries of £lO,OOO ; but, with the exception
of the two named, the little N.S.W. potentate
leads the empire.
Electrocution having proved unsatisfactory
in U.S.A., it is now proposer! to try the lethal
chamber. While the condemned is sleeping, after
a secretly-administered tasteless opiate, his room
will be quietly filled with carbonic acid gas, and
he will painlessly pass from life.
A rising Australian poet (not Sladen), who
had allowed his hair to grow en voyage, and whose
pockets bulged with MSS., waited on editor Ash-
down, of Black and White, and, after presenting
his card, proceeded to read one of his little things.
Ashdown, who stands about 74in., and is thin in
proportion, gradually reared himself up to his
full height, like a hop-pole, or an anaconda
balancing himself on the tip of his tail. “Would
you mind if I turn you out? ” said the lanky one,
suavely, as he elongated himself. Whereupon
the wild-eyed poet fled, leaving his MS. behind.
Vogel’s appointment as Financial-Adviser
to M.L. Government, in succession to Penrose
Julyan, will be a godsend to the famous loanster.
The post has been secured through the influence
of the Tribes, aided by J.V.’s M.L. friends. It is
no secret that the man who once conjured with
millions, and whose name was synonymous with
every kind of wild-cat venture, has long been in
low water. He has moved from one of the swell
squares, and was living in a ramshackle villa at
Moysey-on-Thames after the severance of his con-
nection with the N.Y. Life. The new appoint-
ment (worth, all told, about .£lOOO a year) was
practically arranged during Treas. Ward’s visit to
London, in return for certain services rendered by
Julius, and at the urgent request of Baron
Schroeder and other big men on ’Change.
When in office as Chief Secretary, Alfred
Deakin used to lunch regularly with his econo-
mical colleague, the late Prof. Pearson, at a six-
penny restaurant in Little Collins-street, where
lentii-soup was a specialty. John Nirnmo, when
Vie. Works Minister, generally carried his lunch
to the office in his pocket, and might have been
seen about noon alternately carving a slice of
bread and a piece of meat, or a raw onion, with a
pocket-knife, and washing it (the food, not the
pocket-knife) down with a draught of cold water.
Nirnmo gave a lot to public charities, including a
heap of good advice and a fund of blessings, not
to mention several volumes of departmental litera-
ture for which he had no further use. Gillies
lunched at the Athenaeum sumptuously, and
seldom dined without fizz. Munro, in his best
days, lunched at the full-and-plenty table of one
of his own coffee-palaces.
A good many Melbourne people didn’t
know that Sir Righteous Wrixon was an Irishman
until (for his piety is verra Scawtish) he took
the chair at Mrs. Andrews’ recent lecture on
“ Woman’s Revolt. ” When Dr. Pat. Moloney,
proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman in a
long, discursive speech, had called him the finest
lawyer and the noblest statesman under Heaven,
there was no question as to Wrixon’s nationality.
This was clearly a case of one Irishman but
tering another Irishman. Wrixon felt called
upon to suggest that his admiring “fellow
countryman ” had piled it on rather too thick,
though, indeed, Dr. Pat. hadn’t said much more
than the average Scotchman says of a brither
Scot on any similar occasion. When will Eng-
lishmen start a mutual-admiration society for
offensive and defensive purposes ?
Maorilanders in London claim that Westby
Perceval, their Agent-General, is the very model
of the right man in the right place. He is tall
and of distinguished appearance, and is about the
only one of the Agents, next, of course, to the
veteran Saul Samuel, who can go through the
flummery of a big function without putting his
foot in it., Duncan Gillies is still the blunt, un-
polished miner, and appears to hoard his salary.
Playford is loud, aggressive, ungrammatical, and
drops his “h’s,” and since Braddon left, the
others don’t count for much. Both Perceval and
his wife have money. He “receives” in first-
class style, as for example at the splendid welcome
he gave to Hori Grey, which must have cost over
JGOOO. Moreover, there is a great deal in a name,
Juliet to the contrary notwithstanding, and that
of Perceval, recalling a tragical historic event, has
a vaguely-aristooratio association.
Mrs. “ Robert Elsmere ” Ward was born
a Sorell, and her Tasmanian relations used to say
she had the Sorell semper. Once her parents sent
her on a short visit to her godfather, then Arch-
deacon Reibey (now Tas. M.H.A.), and there
came a morning when the future novelist was very
naughty. “You mustn’t make faces at the
table,” she was told. “Then I’ll go out and
make faces at the juniper tree,” she threatened.
“Very well,” said the archdeacon ; “but if you do
the tree will throw water over you.” “It won’t,”
said the child, and ran away to carry out her
threat, while a housemaid, by her godfather’s
instructions, set out with a bucket of water by a
roundabout path to hide behind the tree. The
little girl made faces at the tree to her heart’s
content, and turned to go, when souse came the
water over her. She ran for her life to the house,
but meeting the archdeacon she stopped and
clenched her little fist, and stamped her little
foot at him, with “ Godpapa, I hate you ! ” But
when that child grew up she had her revenge.
Souse came a bucket of water over Archdeacon
Reibey’s church, which in its turn stamped an
indignant foot and said, “Mrs. Humphry Ward,
we hate you.”
When the question of Deeming’s sanity
was raised by attorney Lyle, Dr. Shields, the Vic.
Govt, medical officer, who has recently been much
in evidence over the Abrahams case, was deputed to
make tests as to the soundness of the murderer’s
mind. The doctor, notwithstanding his long asso-
ciation with convicts, and in despite of the Italian
proverb, “Five doctors, four atheists,” is most
pronouncedly orthodox, and frequently administers
to the soul of the criminal as well as to his body.
“What do you think of the Ten Command-
ments? ” was his first question to Deeming, when
probing for a weakness in the murderer’s intellect.
“Not much,” said Deeming, philosophically.
“You see, Moses lived a long time ago, and
catered for a very different class of people from
what are on the earth to-day. We require a new
order of fiction now ; though, I believe, if Moses
had lived in these times, he would have been found
equal to modern requirements as a writer.”
“ Don’t you think it wrong to rob your neighbor ? ”
was the doctor’s next question. “Well, it all
depends,” said Deeming. “If my neighbor
happens to have something which he doesn’t want,
and which I do want, where is the harm of my
taking it from him?” “Don’t you think it
wrong to take life?” he was then asked. “You
don’t mean to say that you have murdered any-
body?” he enquired, looking the doctor pity-
ingly in the face. “If you have done anything
like that, I am afraid you are beyond any
power of mine for good. Truly, murder is a
terrible thing.” Shields, whose amiable placidity
was proof even against this impertinence, merely
rejoined, “ Well, sir, you are a philosopher, what-
ever else you may be.” That afternoon the doctor
reported to the Executive Council that the mur-
derer was perfectly sane.
The troubles of life are many,
The pleasures ot life are few ;
The troubles all go to the Gentile,
The pleasures belong to the Jew.

Hori Grey, during his sojourn in London,
has found leisure, in the intervals of bookstall
exploration, to write several magazine-articles,
and to give friendly advice to “colonial ” authors.
Tor one article on Australian Tederation in the
Contemporary he drew .£35. He was also liber-
ally paid for an article on Woman’s Franchise.
The old man evidently believes in the adage,
“ The laborer is worthy of his hire,”
Warra : In the gully by the creek lay the
carcase of an old mare. Not far off stood a lean,
lank foal. Leading from the carcase to the top of
the range was a track of beaten mud and under-
growth. The mare, exhausted by the drought and
her natural efforts to preserve the equine race, the
last straw being the cold weather, had fallen on
the ridge. Then began the vain struggle tor life,
the alow agony of death—down, down, down—
the foal following the progress, which lasted maybe
a fortnight, and terminated at the creek. Yet,
knowing the horror of the horse’s last days, there
are men who, to save themselves the thrill of
shooting an old favorite, “ turn him out to die 1 ”
It is said, “ He giveth his beloved sleep,” The
noble horse is evidently little loved, for his sleep
is long, long a-coming.
Melbourne women almost universally wear
their boots and shoes much narrower in the tread,
and an inch or an inch and a-quarter higher in
the heel than Sydney women do. The boot-trade
has a Melbourne last and a Sydney last, which
are altogether different. The Sydney taste doesn’t
differ from the Melbourne in color, but Melbourne
is the home of narrow tread and high heel. At
present the Sydney woman’s heel is from lin. to
the Melbourne woman’s from 2in. to 2|in.
If a bootman put the Melb. boot on the Sydney
market ruin would follow, just as it would if he
put the Sydney boot on the Melb. market. The
boot-authorities point out that Sydney’s hills are
probably the cause of the local wide tread and low
heel, while Melbourne’s flatness admits the narrow
tread and high-heel boot with comfort. But it is
not that. It is on account of the rivalry between
the two cities. Melbourne must distinguish itself
from Sydney, even if it is done with corns and
bunions and the sad ingrowing nail.
Most of the London publishers are deluged
with literary productions from “ the colonies.”
The success of Rolf Boldrewood and a few others
created a temporary boom in Australian stories
and sketches, but it soon died out. The method
adopted by some of the editors of London maga-
zines and weekly papers in dealing with “colonial”
MSS. is peculiar. They divide them into three
classes those written by authors who have
made a reputation, those written by men whose
names are less known, and those written by
others, the majority, whose names are not
known at all. This is the order in which the
MSS. are read by the editors, so that it natur-
ally happens that obscure writers stand hardly
any chance at all. As a London editor put it,
“ It is the brand on the blacking” that takes with
the public. Marriott Watson almost starved for
a year before “ The Web of the Spider ’’made a
lucky hit. “Iota” (Mrs. Caffyn) received but a
trifle for her first book, and Fergus Hume only
makes a moderate income.
Editor Bulletin, —It is charged against
Australian fiction that it smells of the charnel-
house, and delights in abattoir adjectives ; that it
revels in the morbid and sanguinary, finding no
story complete without the services of an under-
taker. This chamber of horrors is becoming only
less wearisome than the inevitable wedding-bells
and half-a-dozen brats that are found on the last
page of the British-made article. It was the cus-
tom of ancient builders to place under their
monuments a holocaust of slain enemies ; perhaps
the edifice of our literature is being built on a
foundation of “stiffs,” tuck-pointed with blood
and tears. But surely the morgue must have
limits, the day of slaughter must be near its end ;
and if we cannot hold a concert, then why not a
wake on the poor lamented defunct? When
writers have wiped their eyes dry over the graves
of the bushman, the swagman, and the prospector,
they may find that human interest can be aroused
with many other chords than those of the requiem;
which is only a minor air in the vast range of
melodies open to their choice. We want, by pre-
ference, the history of the real men about us ; who
neither die in the bush, make sudden fortunes, or
pass unchequered lives with their wives. Men
who finally die in their beds, much to the relief of
the sorrowing family which quarrels over the
insurance-money. And, above all, with the
tragedy of life so present to us, we want in our
reading moments to find in fiction what is so often
absent in fact—a little comedy and joy.—H.F.
J, H. Witheford, having floated several
mining go’s in the London market, thought it
would be easy to induce the Admiralty to establish
naval workshops in Auckland (M.L.) harbour.
With some trouble he obtained an introduction to
the First Lord, but was told that he would be
fired out when the interview had lasted exactly
3min. by the clock. He put on a top hat and a
frock coat, stuck a bunch of primroses in his
button-hole, handed in his pasteboard, and was
ushered into a gorgeous apartment where the
exalted personage sat at a huge table. The Auck-
lander, a man gifted with some cheek and readi-
ness of resource, walked briskly up to the great
man, seized his hand, wrung it with the vigor of a
blacksmith, and asked him in a cheery way how
he was. My lord turned pale and stared through
his eye-glass at the eccentric visitor, w ho proceeded
to quote voluminous reports, stacks of figures,
and newspaper clippings in support of Auckland’s
claims to be made the naval station of the South
Pacific. My lord held up a deprecatory hand,
but this merely acted as a stimulus to Witheford’s
eloquence. When at length he paused for breath
his lordship drawled out: “ The only thing I
know about New Zealand is that you have bor-
rowed a great deal too much money.” For a
single instant Witheford was taken aback, but,
recovering his presence of mind, he again grabbed
his lordship’s hand, and exclaimed, in a tone of
fervent admiration: “Right you are. But as I
was about to remark when you interrupted me ”
He got no further. Melud made a convulsive
dart at the electric button, and was saved by the
prompt entrance ot his secretary, who showed the
visitor out.

THE RABBIT PEST, AND HOW TO
GRAPPLE WITH IT.
In dealing with this question, the ingenuity of
thousands of our colonists has been exerted to
find some means of stamping out the rabbit
plague. Fencing, trapping, poisoning, all have
been employed to arrest the increase of this pest,
but unfortunately the plague still makes progress,
and is surely extending through Queensland in
spite of all efforts to arrest the advance. Few
people realise the enormous annual outlay of land-
holders in checking the increase of rabbits. The
sum spent every year exceeds .£1)00,000 sterling.
New Zealand is the only colony so far that has
thoroughly reduced the plague. The new poison
employed there, called “ TOXA,” is the agent
through which bunny is destroyed by the million,
and tlie New Zealander through it has practically
made rabbit-destruction a paying business. The
action of this poison is instantaneous. Once a
rabbit touches it he rarely runs 20 yards, and all
the tkius are secured, which more than defray the
lal or and cost of the poison. The National Wool
,C< mp ny of Melbourne has introduced the poison
to Australia, and, where tried, it hasgiven excellent
results ; so much so that the company has decided
to manufacture in Melbourne, in order to reduce
the price of the poison as low as possible.*
HOW TO PREVENT PREMATURE
death from disease.—Use, END’S “FRUIT
SALT.” It ought to be kept in every bedroom in
readiness for any emergency; without such a
simple precaut ion the jeopardy of life is immensely
increased. The action of the “FRUIT SALT’’
is entirely in accordance with nature, its use is
imperatively necessary to the enjoyment of perfect
health, and the prolongation of life (you cannot
overstate its value), and some day it will be
acknowledged by the whole world to be the
greatest blessing bestowed upon man for the pre-
vention of all disastrous diseases. Sold by all

Dear, dear I When you come to think of it how
closely related things are ; how one thing brings
up another. Ideas are like a lot of beads on a
string, aren’t they ?
A letter I have just been reading makes me re-
member what happened to me one winter about
twenty years ago. The story is too long to tell
here, so 111 merely give you the tail-end of it. I
was supercargo on a bark bound from London to
Rio. -v tremendous gale, lasting five days,
wrecked us. Forty-eight hours after it ceased
there j* ere four men and no more loft on the
vessel. The captain had been killed by a falling
► pa , three of the crow washed overboard, and the
rest of the -hips company (save us four) went
away in the long-boat with the first and second
mates. We were taking in water through a leak
at the rate of six im hes an hour. Working with
all our might the four of us could pump that out
in forty minutes, but we must do it every hour.
It was awful wo<-k. For two days we kept it up,
without sleep Then we stopped, took io the
quarter boat and shoved off. The sea was quiet
—no wind. While we lay to within a mile of her
the ship threw up her nose and went down stern
first. We were picked up the next day by a
Danish b ig.
Now the odd thing is that the letter that re-
minded me of that experience has nothing what-
ever to say about ships. Please help me to find
out the association.
The lady who writes the letter says that in
July, 1881, she got a bad fright. Exac ly what it
was she doesn t tell. I wish she did. Anyway it
bo upset her that she didn’r get over the effects of
it for nine years. After that her appetite fell off;
she lost all real relish for food, and what she did
eat only made ti ouble instead of nourishing her.
j t gave her pain in the pit of the stomach and
(curiously enough) between the shoulders. She
says her eyes and skin presently turned yellow as
a butce cup. Her face and abdomen swelled, and
her feet the same, the latter so much so that she
was obliged to have her shoes made larger.
“ I got little sleep at night,” she says, “ and was
in so much pain 1 hid to be propped up with pil-
lows. For weeks together 1 could not lie down in
bed. I had a dry, hollow cough, and bad night
sweats. Then diarrhoea set in and my bowels
became ulcerated I was often in dreadful agony
for forty-eight hours at a time. Then I would
have a chill as hough a bucket of cold water were
poured down my back. I KOt so low I could no
longer sew, knit, or do any housework or look
after my children. My siste’ - had to come and
help in the house.
“ Everybody said I was in ™ decline and must
die. What I suffered for eight years tongue
cannot tell. The doctor could do nothing for me.
He said my complaint was complicated and bad to
deal with. In 1886 I wen tas an outdoor pa 1 lent
to the Shrewsbury Infl mary, but only got
uansient relief.”
The writer is in gooa health now, but why did
her case remind me of the shipwreck ? Let’s settle
that first. The a-sociation is easy and natural.
Just see. The ship rank because we four men
hadn’t the stiength to pump out the water as fast
as i. came in. twenty men might have git her
into port. It is the last straw that breaks the
c imel s back ; the last unsupplied need Lira makes
poverty abject and desperate.
These bodies of ours carry the seeds of disease
with them all the time —chiefly the poisons created
by imper ect digestion, made worse by ca eless
habits. But as long as nothing extraordinary
happens we manage to scrape along in a half-and-
half sort of fashion. Yet we’ve got in our blood
the stuff that any of a dozen diseases is made of,
only waiting for something to set it afire. While
the liver, kidneys, and lungs and skin keep us
fairly free —that is, don’t let the load get too heavy
—we say, “Oh, yes, I’m tolerably well, thank
you.” Little pains and unpleasant symptoms
bother us now and then, but we don’t fancy they
mean anything.
By-and-bye something happens. A cold, too
hearty a meal, a night of dissipation, an affliction
through death or loss of property, a fright, as in
Mrs. Bunco’s case, &c. Over we go. The last
straw has crushed us. One loose spark has blown
up the barrel of powder. The crew is too small to
save the ship. The kidneys, liver, skin, and
stomach strike work, and we must have help right
away or perish. All of which means the explosion
of latent indigestion and dyspepsia poisons in the
blood.
There! isn’t it plain why I thought of the ship ?
Now for the conclusion of the lady’s story. She
says : “In 1889 I first. heard of Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. Half a bottle made mo feel
better, and by keeping on taking it I was soon
strong and well as ever. (Signed) Mrs. Ann
Bunce, The Park, Worthen, near Shrewsbury,
February 22nd, 1893.”
If there were only a way to save sinking ships
as certain and trustworthy as Mother Seigel’s
medicine is in the case of sinking human bodies,
what a blessing it would be to poor sailors.*
Colonel Macdonald.
Cor,. Malcolm Macdonald, who is 76 years old,
over 6ft. high, straight as a pine, and in appearance
the beau-ideal of a soldier, received liis first com-
mission in ’37 and spent 15 years in India, where
he commanded a regiment of native irregular
cavalry. In ’57, during the Mutiny, he came to
Sydney to buy horses, got married and stayed
here. For 30 years he was the most active Sydney
patron of swordsmen, fencers, boxers, cricketers,
and athletes in general, and when he contributed to
Sydney Punch, that paper characterised the “noble
art” as the “nurse of manliness.” During those
years he had a boxing or fencing or broadsword
bout with every champion who visited Sydney.
In ’6O, at the Victoria Theatre, lie met Parker
(the Sergt. G°orge of “Bleak House”), a Life-
Guards’corporal, with blunt cavalry swords. Each
swordsman’s only protection was a helmet, and
the prospect of deadly thrust or broken bones
caused the excited crowd, after £290 had been
taken at the doors, to surge over the doorkeepers
and overflow into the building. Parker (who was
afterwards killed by falling from his horse in
Photo. by Kerry.
COLONEL MALCOLM MACDONALD.
Gippsland) received the worst punisliment, but on
points the Colonel let him win. When Mace
came to Australia, he brought with him the
champion swordsman of America, but the Colonel
beat him easily. Foley, who recently beat Major-
General Hutton’s best swordsman, owes his skill
in no small degree to the Colonel’s teaching.
» # »
Black Perry, who introduced the blow on the
point of the jaw, was the most wonderful boxer
the Colonel ever met. A Philadelphian black,
6ft. 2in. high, he would have been champion of
England had not the opposing crowd given him a
dummy £lO-note, then laid information against
him for passing it, and got him “ lagged ” for life
to Botany Bay. Perry, as a ticket-of-leavo man,
was for many years in the Colonel’s service.
There was heaps of fighting in those days (before
and after ’GO), but Perry was easily champion.
He met Huff, the Windsor giant (6ft, 6in.), and
“ cooked his goose ”in a very few rounds. Perry
was a scienced hurricane, and when in battle he
would cow many men with his horrible grimaces.
# * #
Foley, when the Colonel first knew him, was a
bricklayer, working for Sir John Young at the
erection of the old Exhibition Building, Redfern
Park, Sydney. After his work he would come
across to the Colonel’s house in Elizabeth-street —
that house has long been demolished, and the site
is now occupied by Toohey’s brewery. The
Colonel taught Foley the noble art —“ Foley was
never a hard hitter, but he was a most accurate
judge of distance and a wonderful counterer.”
It was Mace, the Gipsy, who could neither read nor
write yet made a “ book;” whose sharp, fixed eye,
strong as the eagle’s, preserved his face from even
one blow in 14 battles, who finished Foley’s
education. The Colonel never saw Foley in any
of his big battles —the one fight of Foley’s that he
saw was an impromptu affair for not more than
a fiver a side. No one dreamt then of Foley’s
White Horse Hotel in George-street, and of
Foley’s £5OOO a year income from his boxing-hall.
* # •
Mace received £lOOO from Wilson’s Circus
for five weeks of sparring during the interval.
It was there that Foley first showed as a scientist.

Concerning fighting, the old Colonel says
“We must have something to try the muscles of
men’s bodies and the endurance of their hearts.
We have also to fight those who won’t live quietly
until we have thrashed them. Of course, the
world would be better without any fighting, but
then it would not be our world. Still, no man has
a right to indulge in the prize-fight unless he is
prepared to get his face battered and to swallow
half-a-dozen teeth or so. Prize-fighting is prize-
fighting.” Terrible punisliment was given and
taken by the old-timers. A man would come back
to his corner with the red of his lower lip hanging
from the corner of his mouth, and the second would
bite the loose piece off and send his man uja again.
The hollow-chested, long-necked, peak-nosed Lang-
ham. whom no man could strike without being
struck back, blinded Sayers in a few rounds, and
Sayers (with his one sound arm) blinded Heenan.
The Colonel was referee at the Dawson-Burge
contest, when Dawson cut Burge’s face into
ribbons—yet the iron Burge was out next day
enjoying the sun and air. The Colonel also acted as
referee in the Placke-Barker fight, in the presence
of Sergeant Brennan of the N.S. W. police.


Vie. Artists’ Exhibition.
The Victorian Artists’ Exhibition this year, as
of yore, is held under the disadvantage of a big
debt, which sits with soulless and sordid
obstinacy upon the society’s chest. Somehow,
it seems to have cast its baleful influence over
the artists also. The work generally gives the
impression of having been done with the bailiff
in the house; and the landscape coloring, for
the most part, represents Nature as viewed
with jaundiced eyes through pale-brown spec-
tacles. A sickly affectation of a vague some-
thing which never was on land or sea pervades
the large majority of pictures on the line. They
are all of them on the line. The works that
might have been “ skied ” were mercifully re-
fused admission. Furthermore, there are alto-
gether too many studies from still-life —flowers,
boiled prawns, and other class-room subjects.
If these were weeded out, the residue might
make a tolerable show. Of landscapes, there
is a large assortment. David Davies makes
the most ambitious bid for fame in “The
Season of Storm and Stress and Toil,” a
large, ploughed field, tinted with the juice
of stewed prunes; plough, horses, and driver
in the middle of it; a straight, flat wall of
heavy paint standing for a sky background.
The picture is far more suggestive than in-
spiring, and the artist is better represented by
less ambitious work elsewhere. Withers has
got a good result in “ Tranquil Winter,” and
Tucker’s “ The Lover’s House,” a moonshiny
bit, is full of atmosphere and charm—a har-
monious picture. “The Last Watch,” a sea-
scape, by George Pontin, representing two
shipwrecked sailors, the chief figure badly
drawn, on a raft in a wilderness of water, is an
unconvincing attempt at realism, but another
Pontin effort in the North Gallery shows more
merit. Mather’s “Mount Mimda” deserves
admiration, despite its chromo-lithograph style.
• * •
There are not many life pieces, chiefly owing
to the fact that the local artists are too poverty-
stricken to hire the requisite models ; and,
somehow, they can’t, as in Paris, be got for
love, whether because the artists are not attrac-
tive enough, or for other reasons, The Bulletin
has not yet discovered. Tudor Tucker’s por-
trait of one of his pupils is strong, graceful, and
alive ; also, E. P. Fox’s portrait of himself, and
the little girl figure in his “ Art Students,” are
pleasing bits of painting. Bernard Hall takes
the palm for technical skill with his “Portrait
of a Lady,” a small-sized study of feminine
wearing-apparel and costume accessories, with
an unassuming wearer included in the scheme.
* * *
The water-colors are for the most part better
than the oils, and a pastel sketch by E. P. Fox
is, perhaps, the gem of the collection. There
are not a score of black-and-white drawings on
the walls, none of them especially worthy of
note. The etching of Mather’s “ Bathing-place
on the Watts ” is conspicuous as the only bit of
nude work in the collection.
Miss Bessie Way, daughter of Dr. Way
and niece of the S.a. Limit.-Gov., has been
appointed matron of the hospital at Hannan’s.
She was one of the nurses of “the better class”
whom Premier Kingston charged the Adelaide
hospital board with unfairly promoting.
“ Cecil John Wilson” (really Cecil Long,
a member of a highly-respectable English family)
has been sentenced to death at Sydney for
having induced to take poison one Edwin Nelson
Hampson, whom he then pushed over a cliff.
Hampson miraculously escaped death, and Wil-
son, who held .£5OO insurance on his intended
victim’s life, was arrested. The defence was
insanity, prisoner having been an inmate of several
English asylums. Which all goes to show that
there may be much method in madness.
It is now within a few months of 30 years
since Julian Salomons made his celebrated tech-
nical defence of murderer Bertrand. On Ber-
trand’s first trial the jury disagreed ; on the second
trial, before the same udge (the same counsel
being engaged), evidence, by counsel's consent,
was admitted from the Judge’s notes of the first
trial. Bertrand was convicted and sentenced to
death, and was to have been hanged on the same
day as bushranger Dunn 16th March, 1866.
Here Salomons (who had held no brief at either
trial) stepped in and moved the Full Court
on the ground that the notes of the Judge on the
first trial were not good evidence on the second.
The Judges were equally divided on the question,
which was eventually referred to the Privy Coun-
cil. The conviction was upheld, but it was recom-
mended that owing to the lapse of time the
sentence should not be executed. It is a coin-
cidence that Loth the Bertrand case and the Dean
case arose at North Shore, Sydney.
The Lynch rnurder-case, tried at Adelaide
Oct. sessions, and which ended in the conviction
of Geo. Lynch for the murder of Donald Ross,
was, perhaps, the “ biggest ” murder-case ever
tried in S. A. Lynch picked up Ross, a boy of 18,
in Ballarat in ’94, and, after knocking about Sydney
and Brisbane, they walked to Adelaide. At
Balaklava (S. A. ) they quarrelled and parted, but
Lynch openly threatened to “do for” the boy,
and wrote letters to the same effect which were
produced at the trial. One day in Aug. deceased
went to a ford to cart water, and some children,
hearing a gun-shot, ran to the scene and saw
Lynch deliberately shoot his mate with the second
shot. The chief witness was a little girl of nine
years, whose evidence could not be shaken. It is
believed there is something besides the quarrel
which prompted Lynch to put the boy out of the
way. Lynch is 50 years old, fairly well educated,
and was formerly in the navy, and it is a little
doubtful whether he is wholly sane. The last
S.A. murder case was that of Brown, who killed
his mate, Maroski, under similar circumstances.
Judge Boucant, who tried Lynch, lia& been on the
bench nearly 20 years, yet had never sentenced a
prisoner to death before.
The business deadlock that occurred the
other day between Sydney Fat Stock Buyers’
Association and an auctioneering firm, recalls a
comical Adelaide auctioneering incident. A well-
known firm which devoted itself chiefly to selling
wool and stud-sheep, found itself, on the an-
nounced date of an important sale, bound by un-
deniable engagements elsewhere. So it asked a
brother firm of fat-cattle auctioneers to kindly
send one of their salesmen to conduct this sale.
Now, the fat-cattle auctioneers had, of course,
butchers and a rough crowd of clients, and were
not particular in being lialf-an-hour 1 ite ; but the
clients of the wool and sheep-breeding firm were
sedate old pastoral magnates, with big bank
balances and mighty manners always on tap.
Well, the cattle-salesmen’s man, a burly, red-
faced, jolly-coiinteiianced fellow, strolled calmly
up to conduct the wool or sheep sale, lialf-an-hour
late, as was his wont with the butchers, sprang
into the rostrum, read out “Loti,” brought down
his gavel with a thump, and tooted out—“ Now,
then, you blanky, bhmky So-and-so’s, give us a
lurid bid, explode yer ! ” The dignified magnates,
after gazing speechlessly at each other for a few
seconds, stalked solemnly out, one after the other.
They were too paralysed even to protest against
the jolly-faced man’s rude language; while lie
was simply nonplussed, and ejaculated—“ What
the cardinal-tinted Paradise have I done now?”
Huxley’s epitaph :
And if there be no meeting past the grave,
If all is darkness, silence, yet ’tis rest;
Be not, afraid, ye waiting hearts that weep,
For God still giretb His tieloved sleep,
And if an endless sleep He wills—so best.
The New Women of Melbourne snort
vigorously at pretty Mrs. Andrews and her lec-
ture on “ Woman’s Revolt.” Her sole intention
is to win the approval of men, they say. Therein
lies the little apostle’s offence. The men do
approve. She practises what she preaches. Mrs.
A. deserves to have her bonnet torn off her head
and jumped upon by the W.O.T.U.
A S.M. Herald correspondent asserts
that Erskine-street, Sydney, was named after the
lawyer-lord, Erskine. The street was actually
named after Col. Erskine, who was in Australia
with the 4Cth Regt. in 1816. Druitt-street was
named after the 48th Regt. major of that name,
and Wynyard-sqnare and street were named after
the major-general who commanded the troops in
Sydney in ’47.
A Chinaman bought a horse, saddle and
bridle for £5 10s. On his way home he had to
cross a few creeks which—thanks to the prayers
for rain—were running strong. The last was a
bit stronger than the others, and carried the horse
off his legs, capsizing the Chow. John managed
to get ashore, and, looking round, saw his pur-
chase in full sail towards the river. Overcome at
the loss, he burst into tears and exclaimed : “Goo
by horsey, goo by saddley, goo by blidley ! Go to
hell my fi pong ten.”
Dear Bulletin, —Re “The Breaker’s”
“drooping myalls” and “massy bloodwoods.”
The poet’s logic, as well as his botanical know-
ledge, is absolutely inverted. One swallow doesn’t
make a summer, even if what “The Breaker”
says in reply to rny criticism be correct. There
are, as we all know, botanical freaks in N.S. W.
and in other parts which have puzzled, and
still puzzle, the Von Muellers, and Baylcys,
and Tenison Woodses of Australia ; but because,
for example, tropical flora can be found in Wollon-
gong. Milton, and Bateman’s Bay districts, no
intelligent person dreams of peopling those regions
with all tropical plants, reptiles, or birds. The
impression that “ Breaker's ” “ pome ” was calcu-
lated to have upon ordinary readers was that it
was a common and general occurrence to find
pines, myalls, and bloodwoods growing together,
and this impression would be an utterly
false and misleading one. On Lake George,
N.S. Wales, seagulls—which, some few years
ago, were swept there from the Pacific by
easterly gales—are found in thousands, and are
yearly increasing in numbers. This fact, accord-
ing to “ Breaker’s ” logic, would convert Lake
George into a vast inland sea and people its
waters with whales, porpoises, sword-fish and
tiger-sharks! The bush “ pote ” is, from a
scientific standpoint, a fraud, a curse, and a
delusion—a reckless and lavish distributor of
everything that is scientifically absurd, outrageous
and untenable; and in this respect “Theßreaker”
is far from being the least culpable offender.—
Yours, &c., H. J. M’Cooey.

The editor of the Sunday Telegraph (London) presents
his compliments to The Bulletin and begs insertion for
the enclosed item of news, not as yet published in Aus-
tralia :
“We are in a position to state that West Australia is
about to lie endowed with a National Gallery. The col-
lection of pictures with which it is proposed that the in-
stitution shall be opened at Perth is the gift of Mr. Albert
F. Calvert and it will include the portraits of the adven-

pioneers of Australian development. A full length por-
trait of Sir George Grey, KC.B.—one of the earliest, as
Mr. Calvert is himself one of the latest, hut hy no means
least successful or plucky of West Australian explorers—

collection. Mr. Calvert’s munificence is, of course, the
direct nut come of his own association with Wes’ ern
Australia, and will lie regarded as an interesting and
creditable sequel to the presentation at the Imperial In-
stitute of which lie was the recipient. When Mr. Calvert
came to London for tlie purpose of advocating the auri-
ferous resources of West Australia (immortal phrase!
Ed. B.)the time scarcely seemed opportune, considering
that South Africa held the field, and that a new Aus-
tralian El Dorado was heard of with scepticism. It is in
a very large measure due to Mr. Calvert’s capacity and to
his supply of accurate information that that prejudice
has been dispell* d. Having won confidence by si raight-
forward policy, lie can now rely on the most influential
backing in London, and hopes are expressed that the
suggested opening up of Western Australia by railway
lines may soon be accomplished. Among the consequent

An Advertising Dodge.
You can’t always tell by the heading of an
article what it is. It may be an advertisement
for Warner’s Safe Cure, “a safe, sure, and positive
cure for diseases of the kidneys and liver, and
their developments,” and you do not read adver-
tisements if you know it, but you have read this
one so far, and ought to finish it, as it will only
take you thirty seconds to read the testimonial of
Mrs. Eliza Parkes, who has resided in Gisborne,
Victoria, for thirty years, which is witnessed by
the wife of the H.ev. Mcßride, Wesleyan Minister
of Kineton. She says ; “ About six years ago I
was taken very ill, and was confined to my bed
for several months, being attended by the doctor
who resided here at that time, whom I believe to
be a very clever and skilled physician, and most
certainly a very careful and attentive one. After
doing all he could for me, he gave me no hopes
whatever of my recovery, and stated that I was
suffering from diseased kidneys; the liver, he said,
was also in a very bad state, the action of the
heart very weak, and the blood very thick and
poor. My legs were swollen to an enormous size.
Having heard from friends about Warner’s Safe
Cure, I determined to try it. I bought one bottle
at a time, and f found it was doing me good, so I
continued taking it, and after taking several
bottles was able to get out of bed. Still continu-
ing the medicine, I soon became strong and able
to get about as well as ever. This I consider a
wonderful cure, as my age is now seventy-six
years, and I have not had the least symptoms of
the old complaint since I left off taking the medi-
cine, which was six years ago. I informed the
doctor that I was.using Warner’s Safe Cure, and
lie recommended me to continue, as he candidly
said it was a very good medicine.”*

T. Blake, the Victorian cross-country
champion, is a wiry man, 22 years old, sft, Gin.
high, and with no particular development to indi-
cate his body’s endurance or his heart’s pluck.
Yet he is a signal performer over long distances ;
he won the two-miles championship in ’9l; the
three-miles scratch team’s race against Australia
in ’92; the same race again last year ; the Vic.
ten-miles cross-country championship in ’93, com-
ing home in 63min., and over a minute before
second man; and he won it again in ’94, with a
new record of 59min. 44sec., or 40sec. ahead of
second man. He holds the record for every Vic-
torian cross-country event; his time for the five-
miles cross-country championship is 29min. Isec.
He recently met Biggs, the N.S.W, cross-country
hero, in a three-mile race, and downed him.
Blake is captain of the Carlton (Melb.) football
team, with which he has played four years. He

What was poisoner Dean’s motive ? He
apparently loved Mary Seymour during their
eight months’ courtship, when he came almost
every Sunday morning on his bicycle to breakfast;
and he loved her for a month or so after marriage,
but after that Mrs. Dean thinks he grew to hate
her, or to love some other woman. Yet, when in
gaol, he wrote his wife a letter of 10 sentences in
which he calls her “dear” or “darling” seven
times, and Mrs. Dean believes that he will
yet send for her and to her alone confess
the motive of his crime. Dean’s protestations
of love were doubtless hypocritical, for had he a
spark of affection he would not have allowed his
wife to sue him for maintenance after compassing
her death and escaping due retribution. No
suspicion of any kind attaches to Mrs.
Dean’s career, and Dean, on his own
statement, knew nothing of Mrs. Sey-
mour’s antecedents until they were unearthed
in evidence. Dean’s temper was sullen and un-
certain ; he would fly into a violent rage on the
slightest provocation and not speak to his wife
for a month after. This characteristic is familiar
to every man or woman who knows him well.
Dean’s father, a police-sergeant, committed suicide
because a fellow-sergeant captured a bushranger
whom both were seeking, and his mother and
some other relatives of his, according to appar-
ently reliable accounts, seem to be in low mental
health, but Dean himself never showed any
erratic tendencies. He was a strictly temperate,
unforgiving man, a hard worker, a faithful ser-
vant, a tyrannical husband, yet the last man,
according to general repute, whom his worst
enemy would have suspected of administering
poison.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Parisienne made a decent attempt to bring
off a surprise in the Caulfield Guineas, hut Cook’s mare
was “smothered” by Wallace as soon as Gough asked
him for an effort. Tims far Wallace appears the champion
of his year, and only the fact that Carbine’s lazy son is to
be raffled next week keeps punters from backing him at
even money for the V.R.C. Derby. Ail the same, there
are plenty of South Australians who swear by Auraiia as
firmly as ever.
With Hopscotch in the field, the Caulfield
Stakes might have been a fairly prophetic event. If Hova
can beat Hopscotch he will, with a fair run in his favor,
not lose the Caulfield Cup by much, if he doesn’t win the
race outright. Judging from appearances after their
bumping finish for the Stakes last Saturday, Atlas bad
travelled quite far enough, whilst Hova was fit to go
another half-mile without turning a hair. He is
in great form just now’. Of the horses that
ran nowhere in the Stakes, the writer takes Devon
and Trenchant to have chances for the Cup—
Devon because he is a real good, game animal, capable of
some improvement during this week, and Trenchant
because he is the very sort of little dandy to do well at
Caulfield, though lie looks somewhat stale and spiritless.
Size in the competitor seems to go for a good deal in this
race. Hova is rather tail and leggy for the small course,
W’ith its awkw’ard turns, when there are twenty or thirty
jockeys all trying to best one another. That’s the only
objection the writer can raise against Hova, who has, on
paper, an excellent chance to beat Hopscotch.
* ♦ » ♦
The Admiral has strong pretensions to the Caul-
field Cup, and if he runs for Cook’s stable he will not
start at longer odds than 8 to 1. The Heroine, a beautiful
mare, was talked of as being likely to beat the old Derby
winner at the weights, but she is seemingly short of
work and may not he ripe until Flemington meeting.
The Admiral is a handy horse, favorably handicapped on
his latest winning form. They can’t make any serious
mistake in a trid gallop, and so, taking one consideration
with another. Tub Bulletin will pick The Admiral to
beat Hova, Hopscotch, and Devon, and win the big
stake. But the state of the going next Saturday may
spoil the chances of these four heavy-weights.

The feature of last Saturday’s Sydney cricket
was little Syd. Gregory’s score of 223 (not out) for South
Sydney against East Sydney (Turner, Shea, Richardson,
and co.) Turner was “quilled” to the tune of one for
78, and Shea (who has been recording bowling feats lately)
got pasted with one for 104. Gregory, beginning at 2.30
p.m., made more runs up to 6 o’clock than any ol her team
even, for Central Cumberland scored but 155, Waverley
six wickets for 196, and University seven for 233 in the
\\ bole afternoon.

mile championship.
South Sydney had two wickets down for 13
when Gregory joined Donnan, and they raised the score
to 186 before Donnan was caught with his score at 72,
after a faultless innings.

It’s a fair thing that A. Bannerman should stand
down for the next Australian eleven. His inclusion will
make the Vic.’s simply sick—and they’re already sick
enough of the arrangements of Portus, Sheridan
and Co. Every attempt to put an extinct, dead,
lame or blind batsman into the next Australian team
should be promptly squelched. And a co. management
should be squelched also.
* * • ♦
Donnan, who has an average of 25 in interpro-
vincial matches, has scored successively in matches this
season : 72 not out, 49 retired, 46, 31, 47, S 5, 72.

Against a strong batting side like Central
Cumberland, M'Kibbin’s eight for 64, last Saturday, was
a most noteworthy performance. He got Iredale l.b.w.
for 21.
* * * *
Gregory’s 223 not out, Donnan’s 72, S. Austin’s
76 not out, and 8. Walford’s 54, were the scores over 50in
last Saturday’s Sydney senior club cricket.

“ Joe Goddard,” says a S. African paper, “ had
little difficulty in disposing of Sullivan ” (a local pugilist),
and “the contest throughout was conducted with rare
friendliness and good temper, the combatants inter-
changing various little pleasantries.” “And, as I was
saying, Joe”—(whoof) —“when we signed articles”—
(thud)—“ if I lost ’’—(smash)—'“ damn it, don’t inter-
rupt’’—(bang, bash, plunk). Time! We fancy we see it
all. Just think of Joj Goddard, boxing in earnest, being
friendly! Anyone who has ever seen J. Goddard with
his hair short, his eyeballs glaring, and blood dripping
from his face, cycloning round a ring, will appreciate the
humor of the situation.

Texas, U.S., has refused to allow Gorbett and
Fitzsimmons to fight within its boundaries. Texas is the
home of the wild-eyed cowboy of American literature, and
is the place where every year one half of the population
uses up the other half at revolver p actice, and yet they
won’t allow two mild'and peaceable men like Corbett and
Fitzsimmons to burr each other’s edges up a hit for pure
sport. We are deceived in Texas, and have no faith left
in New York comic papers.

Placke, knocked out by Barker in the recent
giants’ fight, continues to improve in Sydney Hospital,
and will, it is imped, be out within a month. At the
fight, one horse-trainer ejaculated in regard to Barker:
“ Aly oath ! ain’t lie long in Lire cannons 1” That’s what
tie is. There’s about a foot of hare bone and sinew up from
the ankle before the calf begins. He’s altogether a queer
shaped ’un and w ill never learn to fight.
But Foley said of Placke after the fight : “He’s
the finest man I ever saw’, and if I had him I’d make him
champion of rhe world. He’s never had a lesson, and yet
look how straight he drove that left most limes, and he’s
tire gamest man ever stepped into a ring."
Placke should get a big benefit. The poor
fellow sadly needs one.

Piles Cured. —Owing to the fact that numbers
of people think piles are incurable, the proprietor
of the new “Cannalin” remedies has given in-
structions that free samples and descriptive
pamphlets are to be sent to all applicants in the
colonies. Those who have obtained no relief,
even after years of treatment or from operation,
are specially invited to write to the depdt for
Australasia, 257 George-st., Sydney, N.S.W.*
W. E. Smith, the well-known Sydney and
Newcastle printer, has issued for the benefit of
his customers the most complete book of type-
faces ever brought out in Australasia. Many a
type-founder cannot show the variety of types
and ornaments which W. B. Smith stocks for the
purposes of his general printing-trade. The book
is a credit to Australian printing enterprise.
It has been decided to have St. Alban’s
lottery drawn on 24th inst. Numerous representa-
tions have been made to Mr. W. R. Wilson with
a view to having the drawing postponed until
after Cup-week, in the interests of ticket-holders
in distant parts ; and these received careful con-
sideration before the decision was made. Mr.
Wilson returned from Westralia on Friday and
was met in Melb. by Geo. Tattersall Adams.
After a brief conference it was concluded that
strict adherence to the announced date was the
course most likely to meet with the approval of
the majority of the subscribers, and this was
agreed to accordingly. The tickets are being
taken very rapidly.*
Every citizen who finds his hair fading
gently away like the beautiful consumptive child
in the Sunday-school book, and is oppressed by
the knowledge that the flies of next summer will
rink gaily on his shining scalp, should seize oppor-
tunity with both hands and try Parker’s Aus-
tralian Hair Preserver. This is a local invention,
constructed to suit the climate of Australia, where
the hair falls out mostly from causes unknown in
England, and which the English hair-restorer can-
not grapple with. It is endorsed by testimonials
from a number of well-known Sydney citizens
whose hair it has rescued from the brink of des-
truction, and snatched as a brand from the burn-
ing, so to speak.*

Steel’s PAST experiences go to PROVE that the above
Moonee Valley “Cup” meeting (and the MELBOURNE

Parsons (Vic.) rode in great form in Adelaida
last Saturday—winning the half-mile and ten miles inter-
provincial cycle-races, and twice healing Megson, the
N.S.VV. champion. Parsons, when he began racing, was a
terribly nervous rider ; the first time he rode in tlie Aus-
tral lie oame to the post “dead” from a night of in-
somnia.
• * • •
Megson downed D. Walker, of Victoria, in the
Adelaide half-mile. Walker is 20 years old, and in train-
ing appears to be the fastest rider in Australia. His per-
formances are sensational except in the races. He is dis-
cussed more than any other Victorian cyclist for his time-
trials and racing "bundle.” His only big win was the
one-mile scratch-race at St. Kilda two years ago. Some-
how lie forgot he was racing—came at the finish with a
splendid spurt and won upon the post. Walker s trainer
is Billy Williams, the Melbourne boxer, who thinks to
make his man a champion.
♦ • * •
Parsons is a splendidly-built 20-year-older who
first took to racing three years ago. It is Parsons whose 10-
mile championship at last Austral meeting, wherein he put
up a world’s grass-record, will he remembered long by all
who witnessed it, and it was he who, a month later,
knocked out Wally Kerr’s previous times and put up
Australian records for all distances from J to 10 miles on
the Exhibition, a 6-lap track.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
The eyes of the cycling world will be upon
Sydney track at the forthcoming Nov. meeting, when
Zimmerman (America), Megson, Lewis, O Brien, Simpson
(N.S.VV.), Parsons, Walker, KuMe (Vic.), Middleton (Q.),
Tom Busst, Davis (S. Aus.), and Boyd (M.L.), will bump
against the’ dark horse who has been waiting for those
two £lOO cash prizes.
Zimmerman races in Adelaide, 26th Oct., in
Brisbane, 9th and 11th Nov.; in Sydney, 16th and 23rd
Nov.; afterwards in Melbourne, Maorilaudand Westralia.
• • * *
Parsons’ time (Imin. 19|sec;) in the half-mile
Adelaide cycling.competition, shows that it was a waiting
race, and that, therefore, Megson hasn’t the finishing
sprint that Parsons and Lewis have. Megson was
“ pocketed,” but then it’s a very bad general who gets
pocketed in a time like that.
Megson’s mile in 2.11 3-5 was a great perform-
ance, more especially as the race was unpaced. It was
over six seconds better than any previous Australian
cycling competition mile.
The ten-mile race proves what has often been
contended—viz., that Megson cannot stay long at a hot
pace. Megson drew off after eight laps, although ins con-
dition was good. Previously, when Parsons met Megson
in a ten-mile contest, Megson had to draw off because he
raced himself nearly blind. Pither (M.L.) and Lewis
(N.S.W.) were also badly spread-eagled by Parsons; he
lapped Pither once, and Lewis twice.
• * * •
Zimmerman is going to hold a carnival “on his
own” in Melbourne first or second Saturday in Nov.
Afterwards he will compete at the Nov. meeting of the
N.S.W. League, which has increased its total prize-money
to £5OO.
* • • *
In Zimmerman’s Adelaide interview, some pos-
sible explanation is cast upon ’Murkan records. Says
Zim.: “Some of the American tracks have straight
quarters, halves, and even miles, and when you get on
one of these, with a fair wind behind you, you can bet
you travel.”
* • * *
Another version. Zimmerman, writes a Bul-
letin correspondent, is a delicate, effeminate-looking
young fellow, and is the last person one would take for a
cyclist. He is tall and thin as a match, and, like Parkes
and Mark Twain, sadly needs a hair-cut. In his ordinary
clothes “ Zimmy ” could easily be mistaken for an at tenu-
ated Robert Spalding visiting the kawlinies in search of
health. As a matter of fact, the champion did lose over
101 b. on the voyage, and looked far from well on reaching
Largs Bay.
In racing-togs, Zim. shows to better advantage.
He has good shoulders, and is surprisingly muscular for
a man of his build, but his legs—ah, there we have it.
They are long and sinewy. From hip to knee Zim.'s legs
are extraordinarily long, whereas, from knee to ankle,
they are peculiarly short—in fact, his knees almost touch
the handles when he is going easy. Were Zimmerman a
new rider—say an amateur taking a turn on the track for
the first time—he would not be treated seriously. He
looks ridiculous on his machine-resemhles a giraffe on
wheels—and when he is going steady the spectator
momentarily expects to see him fall off from sheer weak-
ness. But when he spurts—the long knees bob quicker,
the Parkesian hair floats in the breeze, and Zim. is half-
round the track in a few seconds.
Zimmerman, according to some people, is con-
sumptive, and was quietly ordered to Australia for his
health. The narration of the rumor amused him greatly.
“I am out here for my health, yes. lam also studying
the health of the Nimrod Cycle Co„ in which I am
interested.” _ < •
“Zim” is a great advocate of banking cycle
tracks. He was shown the track at Adelaide Jubilee
grounds, which is banked higher than any other track in
Australia, and has been pronounced dangerous by many.
The American was not surprised. “ You ought to have
it banked several feet higher still,” he said. “You will
never lower world’s records till you do.”
Zimmerman weighed himself on leaving the
steamer and scaled list. 71b., He decided not to
race in Adelaide on October 12 or 19, but said he
might do a half-mile sprint on the 26th, and a meeting
has been arranged for that date.
* ♦ * *
The bicycle problem of to-day is to find an un-
pniictnrable pneumatic tyre. One patented has strips of
whalebone inserted between the air tube and the outer
casing. Another suggestion is the preventer, consisting
of a hand of steel with a serrated edge fastened between
tlie bicycle forks so as to skim the tyre as it revolves and
thus scrape off all foreign bodies.
Melb. cycling academies are rushed, at present,
by foolish virgins and dilatory matrons, who have post-
poned their initiation into wheel craft until the eleventh
hour. Private teachers with Dikes of their own are adver-
tised for daily, for “sassiety” means to pedal its way into
Lady Brassey’s affections or perish in the attempt. The
two “leading ladies” of Melbourne are pushed through
their paces daily in company with a host of inferior lights,
who follow tlie road regardless of age or weight.

Comparing the times of Australian interpro-
vincial eight-oar contests with those of (he English
University races, one would prima-facie conclude that
the pick of Vic. and N.S.W. oarsmen were laughably
inferior to the Oxford and Cambridge crews. But Aus-
tralian interprovincial races are rowed at a fixed hour on
a given date without reference to the state of the tide,
whereas in England the ’varsity crews await tlie full flow
when the Thames is running at ahnut 12 miles an hour

It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s

bottles the swelling disappeared, and 1 have
not been troubled with it since.”

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
"It is with heartfelt gratt-, 1
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took hex to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger S
Food ’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of
Its value no other would be
used.''
Recent statistics show that double parental
alcoholism invariably leads to drunkenness in the
olfspring, and frequently to fatal epilepsy ; also,
ep leptic drinking parents invariably have epileptic
children. Alcoholism in the parents also conduces
to phthisis in both parents and children. Further,
the drunken son of a drunken father is invariably
madly violent in his cups.

“Scientific temperance” is now part of
the official curriculum of Tasmanian State
schools. What is “ scientific temperance?”
The writer remembers an Australian parson
who, at a mission feast of young folk,
alter a tea-fight, gave the audience some
“scientific temperance.” Holding an egg up
in one hand and a phial in another, the shep-
herd spake like this: “This is an egg. This is
alcohol. Now, the white of egg is albumen.”
With this he cracked the egg, dropping the con-
tents into a glass, and removing the yolk. Every-
body was interested, especially a reporter, sadly
and most obtrusively drunk. “This, then, is
albumen. Now, the brain of man is almost
entirely composed of albumen. I intend to show
you what effect alcohol has on albumen, and,
therefore, on the human brain.” “ Ho, ho,”
hiccoughed the inebriated reporter from just under
the platform. “ Will our friend there keep quiet,
please?” (Pours some alcohol on the white-
of-egg, which gets muddy, of course.) “ There,
that’s the state of a man’s brain when he
has taken one glass of spirits and is feeling
what he calls ‘merry.’” Applause. “Bosh!”
from the illuminated scribe. “ Will our friend
bear with me?” (Pours some more spirit on the
albumen, which thickens.) “ That’s the condition
of a man’s brain when he wants to lend everybody
money.” “Good man!” ejaculated the excited
reporter. “ ‘ Good man !’ says our friend. Well ”
—(pours on some more spirit, and albumen gets
more turbid) —“ that’s the condition of the
drinker’s brain after three glasses, when he wants
to quarrel with his best friend. „ “Rot!” from
the now infuriated press representative. “I’m
sorry if my illustration annoys our friend; he
evidently knows something about these things.”
“Yah!” from the reporter. (Parson pours on
more spirit, and explains, with interruptions,
until he gets to the sixth driblet, when the
albumen is all found coagulated.) “ And
that’s the condition of a man’s brain,” screams
the parson, triumphantly, “ when he’s drunk
six glasses and goes home and kicks his
wife and jumps on his children !” Sensation
and cheering. The wild reporter is on his legs,
howling—“l don’t mind fair argumensh, hie!
But shish ish dam humbug, an’ you—hie—know it.
You know it —know it —know it I you do (hie) !”
Parson (sarcastically) : “Perhaps our friend would
like to come up on the platform and debate the
subject? If so, if lie will keep quiet till I’ve con-
cluded my remarks, we shall, I’m sure, all be
pleased to give him a hearing.” “Will yer ?”
says the reporter, eagerly. “Oh, yes.” “ Itsher
wazsher!” And he actually kept still till the end
of the lecture. Then he staggered up the side
steps of the platform. There was tolerable silence,
only broken by laughter, as he made a drunken
bow, and then went to a platform back-door
where the “washing-up” of the tea-fight was
going on. “ You’d better shing a hymn—
hie—insher meantime ; I’ll be back dreckly,”
said he, and disappeared. “We will sing a
hymn,” said the chairman. “ I think our
friend has gone to wash himself.” (Loud laughter
at the humorous idea.) But the reporter, evi-
dently screwed up for the occasion, reappeared
with a kettle in his hand, and another egg. And
this was his lecture : “My de-ah bruzzers an*
shishters. Shiah ish hot water —hie. Shish is an
egg.” (Breaks it into a tumbler, and, after some
trouble, manages to scoop out the yolk). “ You’ve
heard all about —hie —sher human brain; also—hie
—’bout alcoll ! Well, shish ish sher shtate of sher
human brain after —hie—one doshe of—hie—hot
water !” (Fours in a few drops of hot water, and
the white of egg goes turbid.) Then, right on to
the bitter end of coagulation of albumen by heat,
mimicking the parson, till : “ And shat’s sher
shtate —hie—of the teetotallersh brain after shix
glasshes of hot water—hie—when he goesh home
to kick his poor wife !” Only he had to scream the
last part, because the leaders of the meeting had
got the girl at the harmonium to start that instru-
ment a-going.

mony carries special weight, writes thus :To Herr RASSMUSSEN.-Dear Sir,-I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfalme Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,

wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit

I do most, heartily wish you. T

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
T am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies-
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recomtnem
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you foryout
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
I years ago. I can with great confidence^ recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated -
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and

Tho old Melb. firm of W. H. Glen and
Co., music-sellers, died of “effluxion of time,”
the other week, and another W. H. Glen and Co.
reigns in its stead. This firm, built in accordance
with the will of the original Mr. Glen, consists of
his old partner, Mr. John Kemp, a new William
Glen, and three others. The new firm, in accord-
ance with ancient business custom, has swallowed
the entire stock, fixtures and book-debts of the old
firm. Also, it is fulfilling an ancient law of com-
mercial nature by selling things at a somewhat
alarming sacrifice for the next month or so. A
new firm, like a new monarch, loves to inaugurate
its career in a blaze of generosity. Even the book-
debts are granted a free pardon when there’s no
perceptible chance of turning them into cash.
Dear Bulletin, — A recent par. refers to
“the Edward Irving who did philosopher ihomas
Carlyle out of his best girl.” Now, Carlyle gob
that girl (Miss Jane Welsh); and Irving, there-
fore, instead of doing, was done. —J.R.I.
At the opening Dean-agitation meeting at
North Sydney, Parson Bennett-Anderson said :
“ I looked into George Dean’s eyes and I saw
that he was innocent.” The poor, deluded parson
went on to say that he had addressed many thou-
sands in England on behalf of Mrs. Maybrick. If
lie looked into her eyes he would certainly have
seen that she was innocent, too. Mrs. May brick s
eyes would convince almost anybody.
Subscribers to the Echo Farm (Sydney)
Home for Inebriates should obtain and study
■barrister Field’s report as arbitrator in the recent
dispute between Mr. Robert Hobson, late manager
of the home, and Mr. Courtenay Smith, the
“honorary director.” The Bulletin hopes yet
to see in Sydney an inebriates’ home, under intel-
ligent medical management and supervised by
Government. Pious laymen and laywomen of the
unscientific and unimaginative teetotal-faddist
type must inevitably botch such an enterprise.
Psalms aren’t an in variable antidote to the whisky-
habit, and many dipsomaniacs are far too high in
the scale of intelligence to find comfort in the com-
pany of the average parson and his hopelessly stupid
surroundings.
The Sydney papers all have the same cable
service now, but they do their best to throw a
little variety into the news by different interpro*
tations. For instance i— „ _ . _
LONDON, Sept. 23.
Mr. H. Morris, of Wanganui, New Zealand, has passed
first in the examination for admission to the Indian Civil
Service. Mr. Morris was 1000 marks ahead of the next
candidate.
Then the reptile contemporary came out with
ttUS ‘ London, September 23.
In the examination of candidates to fill vacancies in the
Indian Civil Service 16 Maoris from Wanganui, New
Zealand, have passed with first place honors.
The Maoris were 1000 marks ahead of the other candi-
dates.
Australian authors are lively. Rolf
Boldrewood has just published “ A Crooked
Stick,” Mary Gaunt (Mrs, Lindsay Miller) ‘‘A
Pointing Finger,” “Jim” Hogan “The Sister
Dominions,” and Ethel Turner “The Family of
Misrule.” Miss Turner also leads off Ward,
Lock, and Bowden’s new “Nautilus Series ” with
“ The Story of a Baby.” Louis Beoke has brought
out “His Native Wife,” and promises another
about Christmas. Also Henry Lawson, and
“ Jacky ” O’Hara are about to issue volumes of
verse 5 and “ Banjo” Paterson’s 1 Man from
Snowy River ”is published to-day. The greater
part of the edition (1000 copies) has been sold in

Michael Davifct thinks that the prospects
of Home Rule for Ireland were not seriously
dimmed by the result of the recent British elec-
tions. They couldn’t well be less bright than
when Rosebery ruled on sufferance.
Cornelius Herz, a French savant, claims
to have discovered a method of cabling upwards
of 100,000 words per minute, instead of 20, as at
present ; and declares that when his invention is
applied it will be possible to send 50 words from
London to Australia for so that letters will
be practically done away with.

A recent cheque-trouble shows how readily
Australians will accept a man as a “lord” if he
only has the front to assume a title. After all,
one can hardly blame the public for the plentiful-
ness of temporarily-successful impostors with
bogus titles. Titled people are now so common in
England that even if a man has regularly read the
English papers for 20 years he can never take up a
print without seeing the names of two or three
“noblemen ” of whom he had never heard before.
If G. Republican Dibbs never did another
useful thing, he would still deserve the gratitude
of humanity for the lift he has given Townsville.
Before Dibbs’s recent visit the inhabitants of that
township used to sit in a melancholy row on their
dfi4oo,ooo breakwater, and beckon “Dilly, dilly,
come and be killed ” to the ships which cautiously
kept three miles away in the bay, out of moat of
the danger from rocks and shallows. Before
Dibbs’s visit Townsville people hung down their
heads whenever Ross Creek was mentioned, and
hastily changed the unsavory topic. But now !
Dibbs has said the breakwater is better than that
of Colombo. Dibbs says continual dredging is a
trifle —“ why, we dredge Sydney harbor.” Dibbs
has planned plazas, and sea walls, and oriental
gardens. And now, if you whisper “Ross Creek”
to a Townsville man, he knocks you down. While
the rival port of Bowen howls disgustedly. Why
doesn’t Bowen invite Parkes up to boom Port
Denison ?

Councillor Fleming is the Ishmael of
Brunswick (Vic.) corporation. The other day, a peti-
tion, signed by 32 ratepayers, was presented, ask-
ing the Mayor to convene a public meeting re the
sweating question, whereupon Fleming “ ventured
to assert that many of those who signed the peti-
tion had never ‘sweated ’ in their lives—they were
too lazy.” Eggs for Fleming at next election.

JT Razor a trial. This brand of razor is something superior to any others offered to the public.
It is specially-tempered, perfectly hollow ground, rings like a bell and never requires grinding. We
can highly recommend it to the general public. Being practical tradesmen ourselves, we
know the exact kind of edge that is required to ensure an easy shave, and, having had them in use for
a number of years, can testify to their merits. We guarantee each Razor for Two Years.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Click, click, the hammer rings
On the drill with measured sway;
“ Quick, quick,” the miner sings
Till to-day is yesterday;
All the woodland whispers “ Hope,”
The rugged hills hurl back “Despair.”
A tell-tale shot—a length’ning rope—
A misty candle—“ Nothing there.”
“ Ha, ha, ha ! ” the jackass cries,
Watching from a withered bough,
“Gold’s a god in those things' eyes,
I must see a lizard now.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Come out, O Miss, of yonder ’ornestead proud :
Wot I can’t get inside (the shearer sang)—
Inside the shoulder cold they’d give your Bill!
So cease to live within the ’ornestead, cease
Thy sunbeam-soapy smiles to waste on pa,
To stand the stare of Jackeroo Esquire ;
And come and mash me in the mallee, come
And mash me in the mallee, roll thou up
And join me on the snug selection, me,
Whose ’ands and land a “ bit ” will always raise,
Who never blues his cheque amid the vats,
But, ant-like, saveth all; so ne’er need walk
Like snails, and swaggies on their uppers borne.
Lor ! the fust time your ravin’ locks I seen
Down dropped my ’art, as dropped the fleece of
snow
That all about me ringer-cloven fell,
The tally-torrent from my dusky paws :
D’ye fuller? Come, O come, a peg come down,
Live with me in the mallee, let the wild
Bald-headed boss be wild (my troubles !) —leave
The crawling jackeroo to mop and swill,
And watch the smoke-wreaths from his cigarette
Fade, like ’is last remittance, from ’is sight:
So fade thou, too, and come where my love-tales
Await thee; feather pillers, my sweet-art,
I buys for thee ; thy shearer calls thee, I,
I and my pipe (and sweet as it’s bin found
Unto my lips, sweeter thy lips would be),
Come —or, hard-hurrying like a sheep just shorn,
Will issue droves from my tonsorial gums
Of really quite innumerable B’s.
PIERRE CASSEE.
AN EXTINCT VOLCANO.
(A Tale of a Public House Bar.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was tall, his skin was hard and brown and
rough;
His nose was large and red—the reason why
I think you’ll guess; his voice was coarse and
gruff,
His endless aim to “ wet the other eye.”
He spoke of cheques that he had earned and
smashed,
Of pounds as many men would speak of pence;
Of “boxing blokes” whom he had “licked ” and
“ lashed,”
Of scores whom he had killed in self-defence.
He’d seen the time when he had “ wiped the
floor ”
With two stout “ bobbies ” and a “ tracker
bloke.”
Then coolly asked if “ there were any more
Who’d like to have their blanky noses broke?”
Brave deeds of daring, too, he could recount
Of rough horse-riding on the wild Barcoo,
Where tearing outlaws by the score he’d mount
And stick to every one like patent glue.
At shearing, too, his “centuries ” he’d clipped ;
At fencing sunk his fifty holes in clay;
His twenty yards of muck he’d moved and
“shipped ”
Quite frequently within the eight-hours’ day.
He’d like to see the bloomy, crimson blank
Who’d dare to hint as he’d been spoutin’ lies—
He was so tall, and broad, and lean, and lank,
That no one cared upon the point to rise.
Just then a small and weazened-looking youth
Of twenty summers—maybe, somewhat more,
With manners quiet, nor at all uncouth,
Stepped to the bar from out the bar-room door.
He called for ale, and laid his sixpence down,
Was just about to quaff the sparkling beer,
When Rednose cried out, with an angry frown :
“Young man, we want no ‘Jimmy Woodsers’
here.”
The fire flashed fiercely from the youngster’s eyes,
When Rednose answered with a wry grimace,
Then both to his and our intense surprise
The beer was dashed full in his ugly face.
A lion seeking whom he may devour,
A tiger loosed from out his prison cage,
Wild knights of old entombed within the tower,
But scarce portray the angry “Long ’un’s ”
rage.
A living earthquake now whose mission dire
Is death ; he strides towards his puny foe—
An active, fierce, volcanic living tire,
Resolved to end the matter with one blow.
Alas ! that we should reck without our host
Or count our chicks before the eggs are hatched;
At least, when we aspire to “clear the coast,”
• We first should mind we are not over-matched.
As madly on the fiery meteor came
To “squelch” the youth with one almighty
blow ;
The latter, who had practised at the game,
Just stepped aside —then let his right hand go.
A gurgling noise, a groan, a “ sickening thud,”
A huge brown carcase laid upon the floor,
A red nose redder still with drops of blood,
A conquered drunken bully—nothing more.

“In Divorce!"
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They were three—and you might have
labelled them, in the jargon of the fortune-teller,
the fair man, the dark man, and the red woman.
But the combination had violated tradition. The
dark man was the traitor—not the fair; he was
the “ injured husband,” who, with one forgetful
hand still grasping the tail of the dead wallaby
slung over his shoulder, stood motionless in the
doorway and gazed at the other two.
For half-a-minute there was silence, more inten-
sified than broken by faint profundity of far-away
thunder that appropriately sounded—the thought
crossed Darkeuday swiftly—the sinister keynote
of the situation. Then, as he noted the direction
both of the woman’s eyes and of the man's, he
looked down in his turn at his own right hand,
and became conscious that his Winchester was in
it. “Ha!" he said —let the wallaby’s tail slide
gradually through his Angers, and slowly brought
the piece across his body.
Darn end ay had never been a man to be compre-
hended by the woman who had apparently now
been making “ other arrangements,” but instinct,
always acute in inverse ratio to intelligence,
warned her that in this frigid deliberateness of
action dwelt more danger than in any sign of
swiftly-moving passion.
“No, no!” she said. “For God’s sake, no
shooting ! That won’t mend matters.”
She was of the large and luscious type, with
bounteous curves, and the milky skin that mostly
goes with lush red hair. Handsome —more than
handsome!—in her way, but far less of Nature’s
mate for her husband than for the burly, curly,
black-eyed nincompoop at her elbow. As she had
apparently discovered.
Darkenday—he was a lean, brick-faced man
with a contemplative grey eye—laughed a little
under the hand which he took from the ride to
stroke his short, hay-colored beard. “ That’s
hard sense, anyhow—even if it does come from the
mouth of a—well, never mind !” he broke off,
drawing a stool across the hut-doorway and sitting
down upon it, with the ride across his knees and
a curious, placid inexorableness upon his face.
“ Calling names won’t mend matters, either—
that’s sense for sense ! And, now, the question
is—what do you mean to do—you and this—l said
I wouldn’t call names—this gay dog with the
nicely-pomaded hair. Scent on its handkerchief,
too, no doubt, amongst its other charms !”
The emphasis on the word “ dog ” went home.
Gotch—a bush-dandy of the drst water, with
parti-colored riding-trousers and a liberal native
impudence-recovered his grip of that quality.
Besides, he was three inches over and ten years
under this thin, dry man in the red shirt and
ancient cabbage-tree hat.
“Just you put your bloomin’ gun away, and
I’ll blanky well show you the kinder dog I am !
If you was the sorter bloke that was dt to have a
wife like Carrie here, you’d put your bloomin’
’ands up like a blanky man, instead of sittin’
there an’ talkin’ shoot.”
Darkenday, still stroking his beard, surveyed
him with an unmoved eye.
“ I said nothing about shooting. It was
‘ Carrie, here,’ who was so quick to understand
what she deserves —and you! According to the
common way of thinking, that is. But, fortu-
nately for the extremely precious pair of you, I’m
not of the common way of thinking.”
“ Put away your gun, then ! ” Gotch advanced
a step anxious, after his kind, to exhibit to the
female animal his brute superiority over a smaller
and weaker male.
“ And make another dog of myself ? ” Darken-
day said “ to contend for the favor of the —urn !
I said I wouldn’t call names, didn’t I ? ”
His eye, resting steadily upon the woman’s full-
davored charms, supplied well enough the “ miss-
ing word; ” but, too coarse-witted to feel the full
contemptuous weight of the undnished metaphor,
she merely forced herself to give look for look.
“ Harry Gotch is my man ! ” she said, dedantly.
“ That is what I was coming to ! ” Darkenday
answered, as a sudden blaze of lightning dlled the
doorway with a pale-blue background to his black
judicial dgure. “Ha ! ” and he turned his head,
“ it will be a suitable night for the new nuptials !”
“Nuptials?” echoed Mrs. Darkenday, not
assured of the meaning of the word.
“ Ay ! For your second wedding, you know !
with the man—or, is it the dog ? —of your choice ”
For the drst time Darkenday laughed outright,
with a sound dtly chorused by a sharp rattle of
close-at-hand thunder. “Harry Gotch is your
man, you say.” Here he sprang suddenly to his
feet. “ Then let Harry Gotch take you—and
go ! ”
“But”—from the woman. “Look here!”
from the one man. And then, with strident in-
sistance, from the other : “LetGotch take you, I
say ’’—another crash of thunder—“ and go ! ”
Silence, then, but for the big drops striking
sullenly upon the bark-sheets of the roof, till,
by the next eye-searching glare, the scarcely-
comprehending lovers saw that the owner of the
hut had crossed it with a rapid step. The door—
and the storm—were free to them.
“You have made a second choice, woman,”
Darkenday said, more slowly, “ as you had a per-
fect right to do. Therefore, /do not quarrel with
it —hut therefore, also, you must abide by it, as far
as lam concerned. Do you understand ? ”
Only the thunder answered, and after it came
Darkenday's voice again—level now and steady as
if he were reading an inscription.
“You have made, I say, a second choice. That
is your business! Mine is to take care that
Gotch's darling does not remain another night
under Darkenday’s roof! You shall have half-
an-hour ! ”
He took a wallaby-skin from the wall, deliber-
ately breeched the ride with it, and went forth
into the wildness of the night.
* * »
“ Harry! ”
“Well?”
“ Do you think he means it ?
“By God! doesn’t he? He means that
shootin’-iron to be in order when he comes back !”
“I,’ after a long pause, “I should know him
better than you do ! ”
You should ! ” with a ferocious blasphemy.
“You should!—but, by God, you didn’t!—else
you’d never have caught me in this ”
“Goon!” she said, and her voice had taken
the ring of contempt intolerable to a man whose
only criterion of manliness is a woman’s estimate
thereof. In which case there is always a screw
loose even in the animal courage with which it is
the pride of the brute-approaching human to
make, after all, an indifferent second to the bull-
terrier or the gamecock.
“ Look here, Carrie,” Gotch said presently,
with all the stiffening gone out of his voice, “if I
clear out now I reckon you’ll be able to patch it
up with him all right, won’t you V
Mrs. Darkenday’s laugh lashed him like a
whip.
“ Begone !” she cried, “ and save your cowardly
carcase ! That is what you are thinking of —not
of the woman who mistook you for a man !”
And Gotch slunk out into the rain.
• # •
“You are wet!”
“Pretty well —but the rifle isn’t! Where’s
your—friend ?”
Mrs. Darkenday, as she lighted the lamp, saw
something reassuring in her husband’s face.
“ He’s gone,” she said.
“For good?”
“ Faugh ! —yes ! Can you forgive me ?”
Darkenday stood his Winchester in a cornel
and began to pull off his wet boots before he said,
as quietly as if he were not quite sure what she
was talking about —“ Forgive you, Carrie ? What
for ?”
She came and put her hand upon his soaked
shoulder.
“ For not knowing a man from a mangy cur !’
“ Ah, well,” said Darkenday, fumbling forth
the pipe of peace, “ I daresay you thought he was
a lot more in your style than I am. But, if you’re
of a different opinion now, we’ll—well, we’ll go on
as before. ‘ Perfect accord shall never be ; but
less may oil the wheels of life ! ’ he muttered, as
he began to cut up tobacco.
Mrs. Darkenday heaved up her statuesque
shoulders in inarticulate protest against the
abstract. “ What did you mean,’ she said,
“ when you gave me half-an-hour to lie gone 1 ”
“ What I said ! It was a decree nisi, but we
won’t make it absolute.”
“But, look here, Tom,” she said, only half-
understanding. “ Tell me this. If you had found
us together when you came back, would you have
shot us ? ”
He looked up quickly at her over his shoulder.
“ Put yourself in my place !’ he said. “ Try to
be me for a moment. Would you ? ”
Her large red mouth flattened and paled.
“ Wouldn’t I! ’ she said, more to herself than to
him.
“Ah, well,” he said, “thats the gentler sex,
you see. I wouldn’t! ”

and has accepted a peerage.”— Cable.
This will not astonish the everyday folk
Who travel through life in the steerage,
They accept as a chestnut the cablegram joke
That Worms may be found in the peerage.
That flatulent monstrosity, the Imperial
Federation League (Melb.), has decided to start a
band. To be in keeping the band should be com-
posed wholly of wind instruments. The Bulle-
tin long believed that the League had suspected
itself to be a circus.
Bishop Goe eloquently praises the late
Anthony Thqrold, Bishop of Winchester, for
“the restoration of the princely residence at
Farnham, over which he spent many thousands,
that he might render it a more worthy abode for
the future occupants of the historic See of Win-
chester.” The princely residence at Farnham !

Editor Bulletin, The “ Pastoralists’
Union” and “ Govt. Labor Bureau ” are respon-
sible for much destitution amongst bona-tide
bushmen in this district during the present
season. The former sends men from Sydney,
armed with a P.U. ticket, on which is printed
“ Help those who help you ; ” and men presenting
these are taken on in preference to ordinary bush-
men every time. The latter gives free passes
to men who are prepared to work for whatever
wages offer. This being so, the ordinary bush-
hand, who hitherto was always sure of a job at
shearing-time, now walks about idle and almost
starving. The Sydney men, as soon as shearing**
over, return to the city to live on Govt, charity.—

The Sydney Sunday Times’ pen-lady dis-
courses on the congenial theme “ Are tights im-
moral ” :
I heard some clever people discussing the other night
the question of the immorality orotherwise of tights. Some
held that it is immodest and immoral for a handsome and
shapely young woman to display her charms in flesh-
colored apparel, and that those who go to the halls and
theatres where young ladies show their legs are equally
immoral and immodest. This almost unrestricted display
of lovely woman's attractiveness was said to corrupt the
minds of callow youths by its suggestiveness. We were a
party of ladies, and I must confess that I delicately intro-
duced the subject. The principal concern of most of iis
was for the men. I remarked that a girl had a perfect
right to wear tights if she thought fit.' That her lovely
legs were her own, a gift from the Creator, and that the
wearing of clothes was, after all, a mere conventionality.
Not that 1 believe in shattering conventionalities, but it
is well to remember their existence in considering sucG
questions. I don’t see anything in the wearing of tights
to corrupt men.
And then the lady goes on to discuss the necessity
for a large maternity home in Sydney.
Dear Bulletin, —“ H. J. M‘Cooey ” uses
his own experience as a standard of measuring the
possibilities of all created things, including the
vegetation of this continent. With a premature
war-whoop he attempted to scalp a poet for
locating bloodwood, myall, and pine trees in the
same region. Now, in Western Queensland, the
bloodwood (E. Oorymbosa), the myall (acacia pen-
dula), and the cypress pine (callitris robusta) are
friends and neighbours over a large area. With
a fine vein of self-deluded sarcasm, Mr. M‘Coney
anticipates that someone will now tell us that he
has seen the lyre-bird and the emu playing
together ! Let me whisper that I saw that impro-
bable scene on two occasions. The last was in the
drought of 1878. A lyre-bird (Menura Alberta)
had come down from the scrub on the range to a
small waterhole in a clump of gums (E. hcema-
stoma), and two emus were also there in search of
water. The menura was running round a gum-
tree and the astonished emus were following him
with heads down and necks stretched to the
extreme limit. I saw a similar scene on another,
occasion, but one is sufficient to knock out Mr,
M‘Gooey’s theory.—A. Mkston.
