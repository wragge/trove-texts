The Australian Theatre
Gerald Bring (K.P. 17/12/’25) certainly
makes out a case for purveyors of theatrical
fare in Australia; and until one looks
into it the case seems stronger than
it really is. The course of the entre-
preneur is full of hazards; but is not
the same thing true of every other busi-
ness enterprise? What helps to confuse
the issue is that commercial managers have
taken to posing as disinterested patrons of
art for art's sake and explaining their fail-
ures, due to various causes, by the lack of
artistic appreciation on the part of the pub-
lic. This lack of appreciation is largely
their own fault. Audiences nurtured for so
long on a diet of musical comedy mainly,
eked out with light comedies, farces and
detective thrillers, do not readily enjoy a
play which requires more mental digestion.
The people who might appreciate it have
formed the habit of staying away from the
theatre. And the profits tend to grow less
even in musical shows, because this kind
of entertainment is frequently so exiguous
that it lias to be very lavishly dressed and
mounted.
To turn to Mr. Pring’s own experiences,
one is inclined to agree that reproaches
about not using the local product are unfair.
Australian actors are certainly encouraged,
and there is still a vivid recollection of the
play put on by “the Firm” which was writ-
ten by a lady from Adelaide, with improve-
ments by Miss Polini. Its production was
an act of kindness to the authoress rather
than to the public. On the other hand, it
must be admitted that Haddon Chambers,
the best known Australian playwright, found
it better to go to London and stay there.
ilr. Pring’s difficulties over obtaining suit-
able plays for Mr. Guy Bates Post are of
the kind that beset the manager for a star.
This magnifying of the actor's importance
over that of the play is like putting the cart'
before the horse. It has had subversive
effects on drama, but it is frequently done.
The mention of Mr. Post, however, brings
up another point showing the unwisdom of
managements responsible for importing
actors into Australia. lie is himself an
actor of fair ability, but too often the much-
heralded importation has turned out third-
rate. It can easily be understood that the
expense of bringing out these people and
guaranteeing them practically a year’s en-
gagement is too great. Rut the alternative
arrangement of risk? and profit-sharing is
sometimes followed. In the case of the
Yanbrugh-Boucicault tour, the outstanding
success of recent years from the combined
financial and artistic standpoint, it was pre-
sumably satisfactory to both sides.
One wonders if Mr. Pring is as familiar
with the London and provincial stage as
with the American. lie says, for example,
that plays are “tried out” in the provinces
beforehand. That is often so, but hardly
“as a rule.” lie does not add that plays
which are successful in the provinces not
seldom are withdrawn from the London stage
after a few weeks or even days. Instead, he
rather suggests that a run of two or three
years in London is not uncommon. What
pieces since the war have had such a run
besides “The Beggar's Opera,” an artistic
triumph, and “The Farmer's Wife,” a divert-
ing study of the genre type that appeals to
a large section of Londoners? Only rarely
is a play produced on the commercial stage
in Australia tnat has not had a long and
successful run in London or New York.
Then the expense of production is far
greater in London than Australia, con-
trary to Mr. Pring’s suggestion, because of
the gambling in theatres that has gone on
since the war. Most West End theatres
have by now acquired a string of lessees of
whom all but the last are just taking their
cut out of what amounts filially to an extor-
tionate rent. This recent development in
theatre property ownership is calamitous.
Except for a few courageous experimenters?
like Barry Jackson at the Kingsway, and
some of the outlying theatres such as the
Lyric at Hammersmith, the Everyman at
Hampstead and the old Vic. on the Surrey
side, managers spend their time looking for
l>lays that will be sure of a run of some
months at least. Otherwise they are heavily
mulcted. The prices of admission quoted
qlso do not give a fair impression of London
theatres. For a very popular musical comedy
stall-seats may cost 16s. Gd., otherwise they
average 12s. Gd.—except, of course, for grand
opera. In Sydney there are many occasions
when they rise above Bs. And it must be
borne in mind that many London theatres
have excellent accommodation in the gallery
and pit (averaging Is. Gd. and Bs. Gd.), anil
some have an upper-circle between gallery
and dress-circle. In practically all the West
End theatres, too. the floor-space is divided
equally between stalls and pit by a per-
manent barrier which does not recede when
the bookings are good. In consequence the
front row of the pit is as good a position
as any in the house.
A\ ith regard to theatrical critics, perhaps
Mr. Bring is not aware that St. John Ervine,
critic of the Observer, is one of our fore-
most playwrights. Basil Macdonald Hast-
ings. who has several excellent plays to his
credit, is critic of the Standard. James
Agate, of the Sunday Times, has also had
a West End production lately, but it was
not successful. Ashley Dukes, however, an-
other well-known critic, has a nlay running
in London at the moment and likely to run
for some time longer. And surely Mr. Pring
M® heard of "The Green Goddess.” which
'\ illiam Archer, after years of criticism,
wrote to show the playwright how to do it!
Maybe it is laboring the point to mention
that G.B.S. for several years as professional
critic endured other people's inferior plays
before he took to writing plays himself.
The fact is that Mr. Pring is rather abroad
on the subject of the press. He imagines
the Australian papers to be severe, whereas
the responsible dailies are most punctual with
their half-column of graduated praise for
the productions of “the Firm.” Furthermore,
an extraordinary amount of flattering pub-
licity, masquerading as bona fide comment,
from outside, such as would not be accepted
by papers of standing in London, finds in-
sertion. That attitude of “helpfulness” which
Mr. Pring feels the want of most bitterly
is hard to combine with “constructive'’ criti-
cism, which lie also misses badly; for con
striictlve criticism, such as one expects from
an Ervine or an Agate, would need often-
times to be searching as well as nice in its
discriminations.
Perhaps, after all. flic criticism Mr. Pring
desires is not so very constructive. Probably
what he wants is merely space, as much as
apparently the American press provides. The
plays he particularises are American. 80
also are the demigods of the theatre whom
he mentions with bated breath —David
Helasco, father of the notion that you must
have all your stage properties as far as pos-
sible the actual thing, exact to the minutest
expensive detail, or you will fail of the illu-
sion : and George M. Cohan, who is forced
to rewrite musical comedies submitted to
him because they do not come up to his liigli-
souled artistic ideals. For ourselves we are
very weary of these musical plays and crook
dramas, and everything else that comes out
of America. It would be small loss to Aus-
tralia if she would cut clear of the American
influence.
BEATRICE TILDESLEY.
Provincialism in Literature
In a recent article for tlie Red Page,
"L.V.H.” quoted Virginia Woolf as saying
that Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte were
hampered by provincial qualities, and that
they would have written better novels if they
had lived in London and frequented “literary
drawing-rooms.” It is hard to believe that
so_ shrewd and lively a critic as Virginia
Woolf could have said this in any spirit
other than one of irony. In any case it
shows a confusion of mind. Jane Austen
and the author of “Jane Eyre” inhabited
totally different worlds, and a prescription
for one could not hold good for the other.
It might have been that Jane Austen, with
her pleasant sense of satirical comedy play-
ing brightly over the surfaces of things,
would have found wider rangeV'or her talent
in ii fashionable milieu than in the “pro-
vincial” one of country houses. But Char-
lotte Bronte! She did not deal in surfaces.
It is as absurd to suggest that she was limited
by her environment as to say that Tennyson
would have written better poetry if he had
lived in Mayfair father than the Isle of
Wight.
There is a danger in using adjectives that
have at once a vague and an exact meaning.
“Provincial” has come to be a slightly con-
temptuous term, thrown about at random,
even though Matthew Arnold analysed it
with great care and used it as a fixed term
in criticism. What, in fact, does it mean?
In a semi-philosopliical way we can say that
a writer is provincial if he uses ideas with-
out any sense of their historical background.
Coming suddenly into the currents of modern
thought lie is bowled over by some theory
of Darwin's or Einstein’s, and can’t conceive
of a mediaeval world where schoolmen de-
bated liow many angels could dance on the
point of a needle as anything but a jungle
of intellectual barbarians. He is too recent
an arrival in the arena of civilised' thought
to grasp the proper proportions of things.
But in talking of creative fiction the
word “provincial” is only valid in connection
with the World of manners. Not a very
large world! Most important writers have
kept clear of it, except in the eighteenth cen-
tury. when it drew all the wit and talent
of England and France into its glittering
circle. That was an age when the springs
of poetry had become tepid, when “Town,”
a very limited area of the metropolis, was
the only centre of life, and outside was a
wilderness of tradesmen and rustics. Then
there was Nature—a trim, pastoral land-
scape without mystery or distance. We can
hardly think of the eighteenth century ex-
cept in terms of manners. People then' were
concerned with the outward forms of things,
even in their turns and twists of speech,
and liked their phrases to be as polished as
their gestures or the buckles of their shoes.
But the equivalent of this society to-day
(if there is an equivalent) has no particular
attraction for the writer. He is not
drawn to it by either the hope of
patronage or the expectation of wit.
What remains for him? Well, practi-
cally the whole fighting, working, adventur-
ing world on which the poets and dramatists
have always drawn. In this territory there
are no provinces. All values are absolute,
and it does not matter a brass farthing
whether the inhabitants are sophisticated or
simple. From Hardy hud Conrad down to
Lawrence and Joyce, modern novelists have
dealt with almost all kinds of people except
those belonging to fashionable society. Hardy,
for instance, devoted his entire attention for
40 years to the countryside of Wessex. Is
he therefore pinvincial? Not in the least ;
for his work doesn’t belong to the world of
manners—the only one in which the term
holds good. Almost the last great writer to
deal with that world was Henry James, and
he was always hovering on the edge of pro-
vincialism, for he took manners, fashions
and social conventions seriously, yet did not
quite belong to the centres where these things
originated. The manners and fashions of
polite society in Boston ! How could anyone
immerse himself in such second-rate subject-
matter without being provincial? And yet
there was probably plenty of material in
Boston that was native and dynamic, if he
had looked around ‘him.
We say that a society is provincial when
it looks to some other centre to set its stand-
ards of living. There was the old joke
about the Australian who turned up his
trousers when it rained in Piccadilly—he
was the born provincial. And he is typical
of many larger groups whose whole social
life is tuned to keys struck in London and
Paris. A writer who took the manners and
fashions of such groups seriously would
necessarily be provincial, too ; for in her re-
lations with her servants or some wealthy
woman of a social grade above her, Mrs.
Baumberg, of Vaucluse, the retired linen-
draper’s wife, is not important. Neither is
Madame Bovary. But there are other ways

of treating people, as Flaubert knew. Even
Mrs. Baumberg might be given literary im-
portance if taken off the social plane and
put upon a merely human one.
It is ultimately the point-of-view of the
writer, not his domicile, that makes his w T ork
provincial. If he is concerned with funda-
mental character, it doesn't matter very
much whether lie deals with the people of
Normandy or those of the Arran Islands, of
Mudgee or of London —providing he writes
about those he knows best. They have exactly
the same potential literary importance. But
if he is concerned with the world of manners,
he had better go to a society distinguished
for such things, not to a derivative one. .1 he
social triumphs of Mrs. Baumberg are not
splendid enough, and her gauchenes and
failures not sufficiently devastating. one
does not inhabit a real world of manners,
that exists by codes it has created itself.
The milieu of the Duchess of W rexe offers
more elaborate material.
So while Jane Austen, the novelist of man-
ners, might have gained by looking for bright
alluvial in “literary drawing-rooms, ( har-
lotte Bronte, with her wild poetic genius,
would have been a bad fossicker there. She
was much better at home, mining the deep,
dark veins on her own Yorkshire moors.
VANCE PALMER.
The Magic Metre
A marvellous medium of expression is the
conventional 10-syllable line that dominates
all serious English poetry. At first sight
nothing would seem to have fewer possi-
bilities; just a short-and-a-long, five times:
Te-tum, te-tum, te-tum, te-tum, te-tum.
Then the same thing over again ; and repeat
till exhaustion sets in.
However, the poets began at once to mould
it as they pleased. It was found to be cap-
able of a pause almost anywhere, giving
large variety. Thus:
A piece of bread dnd cheese, a glass of beer,
runs just as well if turned about:
A glass of beer, a piece of bread and cheese.
Or the pause may come in the middle:
A man from Melbourne, known in Ballarat.
Or as early as in Wordsworth’s
Dear God! The very houses seem asleep.
Or as late as in Max Beerbohm’s interrupted
soliloquy :
Bespangled with innumerable —No !
Or there may be a succession of jerks, as in
Emerson's awful line:
Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool and wood.
Or there may be no break at all, as in
Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer —
That “whether” is notable. It completely
fractures the original convention of a sliort-
and-a-long. „ „ ,
The plain fact is that of all languages
the least suited to the “te-tum” formula is
our own, which on the contrary makes a
point of emphatically beginning words and
hardly troubling to finish them at all
“station,” “bicycle,” “ordinary,” "Edin-
burgh,” “Mrs.” Far better suited to our
tongue is the long-and-a-short metre, as heard
in, say,
Saviour, breathe an evening blessing.
The poets soon felt the need of such a beat,
and they met it ingeniously. Consider this
line:
And steaming Darwin envies Hobart’s snows.
Any grammarian will scan that for you as
technically correct, though sounding like
Chinese: “ming Dar,” “vies IIo,” and so on.
But every reader pronounces it for what it
is, four words each a long-and-a-sliort. with
independent monosyllables to start and finish.
And still this did not meet the trouble
with the opening foot.
Our proper names, in particular, are built
the other way. Even with borrowed names
clearly accented on the second syllable,
we insist on stressing the fir'st instead —
“Quixote,” “Paris,” “Venice.” So the poets
found themselves blocked from calling on
practically any person or place of importance
by way of an effective start. A casual
“McGrath” or “O’Toole” or “St. John" was
little use to them, when deoarreu fro.a
“Moses” or “David,” “Alfred" or "Caesar,”'
“London” or “England” ; together also with
all the emphatic monosyllables “God,”
“Prince,” “Truth,” “Rome,” “France.” They
simply refused to face the privation. For
the first foot, only, they took the right of
changing “te-tum” to “tumty” whenever they
pleased. Thus what musicians call their
“attack” was immensely varied and strength-
ened.
The other main change has been the non-
insistence on a beat in the middle of the
line; this laxity has let in all the tailed-off
long words which will not .take a second
stress —“melodies,” “messenger,” and notably
“Australia” and “America.” A firm finish is
still the rule, but even that is not rigid.
Thus the form has become extraordinarily
fluid:
And the billowy blossom seen in the burgeoning spring
is a far cry from the basic formula “te-tum
five times.” So is the following, with only
three beats accented at all:
Mediterranean immensities.
Here the original short-and-long idea is lost
completely :
Italy, Malta, Egypt, Turkey, Greece.
Yet it is still within the fold, just as is
Tennyson’s staccato:
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by
prayer—
or the intentionally heavy beat of Pope’s
And ten slow words oft creep in one dull line.
Thus the iambic pentameter has grown
and spread till it dominates the language.
For over a century—the deadly eighteenth,
whose dreariness, as someone has said, always
reminds one of a wet Sunday—it got the
poets down and knelt on them. One has
to feel grateful to Coleridge and Longfellow
and Scott for showing that the epic or nar-
rative could be done otherwise.
The odd thing is that each great writer
has stamped the thing in his own mint.
Sliakspeare’s line is recognisably different
from Milton’s, Tennyson’s from Pope’s. In
spite of which—or should it be in conse-
quence of which? —young writers of to-day
might for practical purposes rely on this
form far more than they do. The thing
is not necessarily barred because it has ceased
to be supreme.
Australia’s poetic gift has. been lyrical,
mostly, and so this form has been little
used here; except in the sonnet, of course,
for the sonnet is as much tied dowm to it as
is the poetic drama. And in sonnets its
unaccountable virtue is raised to the nth
power. Just as the second-rate poets can
most easily make an appearance of being
first-rate by using the sonnet form —and
don’t they know it! —so can the fifth-rater
get nearest to the second by using the I.P. It
is the true gait for the pedestrian poet. It
is the one metre in which—contrary to all the
spirit of poetry —the thing said seems of as
much importance as the manner of saying
it. Note how Kipling, who scorns it as
a rule, relies on it as a matter of course
when laying dowm maxims. For one who has
no real poetic gift, yet has something worth
while to say, it is invaluable, as witness
Fitz Gerald’s case. There seems to be a sort
of magic about the thing. Suppose one is
writing cricket history:
Then little Tarkin,
With circus-like tricks,
Bowled to Macartney,
Who hit him tor six.
Sheer doggerel. But treat the same words
with the magic formula :
Then little Parkin, of the circus tricks,
Bowled to Macartney, and was hit for six.
It is somehow fortified by old, forgotten, far-
off things, echoes of Pope’s “Homer” and of
satirists innumerable, and so gains a specious
esteem altogether beyond its deserts.
Probably any well-educated man—always
allowing that he has something to say—
could by a persistent use of this form get
himself ranked among Australia’s leading
poets within two years. Take the ease of
Dennis, for instance. As the little girl said
in the story, “He had and he did and he is.”
We may know plenty of good work of his
besides the Bloke, but to the public at large
he began to count only when the slang of
the push burst upon an astonished world in
iambic pentameters.
The* I.P. is the tarred road of poetry.
You will find no lovers loitering on it, no
singing-birds, no bushmen, hardly any women
or children. For them the garden, the
meadow, the bush-track, the lane. But for
anyone wanting definitely to get somewhere
it is invaluable.
S. TALBOT SMITH.
The Abo. "Spiritual”
Musing on the art of Edna Thomas, the
lady of the negro “spirituals” who gave a
final show in Melbourne the other night be-
fore departing for Europe, I wondered why
an Australian Edna has not yet arisen to
do for our own Black Brother's vocal efforts
what this lady from Louisiana has done
with the coon-song and the plantation
hymnal. If the material does not exist in
the raw state in Australia it ought to.
Binghi is second to no primitive race in
his instinct for rude rhythms and his ability
to express his savage notions in poetio
fictions. According to Basedow, the great-
est expert on him, “lured by the glint of
an inspiration, his nearer vision is blinded,
his musculature quivers involuntarily, and
his only is to catch, to imitate and
to give expression to his eXalted feelings.”
His musical accompaniments are not of a
very complicated nature. He puts his thighs
together, stretches a piece of skin across
them and smacks this simple_tom-tom or the
buttocks of his neighbor. Nevertheless, his
sense of time would shame many city chor-
isters. “The magnetic charm about a tribal
dance lies in the rhythmical motion of the
performers, in the harmonious way their
naked bodies sway to the accompaniment of
crude but effective music, and in the clever
association of sound with motion and silence
with rest,” Basedow claims. Perhaps if Bax
and Holst, who were recently reported to be
on the verge of discovering the ultimate
mystery of rhythm, were to take a trip some
hundred miles back of Bourke to the stamp-
ing ground of the Arunta and the \V Tarra-
inunga, they might find the object of their
quest had been in the possession of those
naked virtuosi for the last 20.000 years.
Of course, the folklore of the uncivilised
aboriginal and the traditional emotional
equipment of the white man have no common
ground to meet on. The Nibelungen Hied is
a White Australian’s heritage, while the
Alclieringa myth of the Australian black is
an alien mystery, and a highly improper one
at that. Before Binghi can make any con-
tribution to Australian music, he must go
through the same process of evolution as
the negro, who was transported from his
native wilds, taught the" rudiments of Eng-
lish by his owners and given a rough draft
of Christianity. Out of these elements his
quick imagination made the quaint conceits
.and his experience provided the savage
rhythms for “Co Dowm, Moziz,” and the
rest of the curious repertoire out of which
Edna Thomas has made such good capital.
I yarned at Port Darwin not long ago with
the Rev. Watson, that militant man of God
w r ho spreads his net at the western horn of
Carpentaria for the tribes that drift annually
in quest of fish along the string of island
stepping-stones that penetrate the gulf. He
told me enough to satisfy me that in the
lonely mission stations scattered over the
northern end of this roomy continent, such
a blend of English and primitive culture as
produced the negro spiritual has long been
in existence. Why, then, have we no Edna
Thomas to rescue it from oblivion?
M. G. S.
Shelley
There came a cherub radiantly great;
He flew Love’s ensign in the front of
Wrong
To gleam with glory as he swapt along.
Steeped in life’s bitterness and wrought by
fate
He sounded all the depths of human hate;
He smote a dumb world and it gushed to
song
And Freedom, thrilled by lyric lips, grew
strong.
He passed, unquelled, unstained, compas-
sionate.
The world he dwells in with its bright pure-
bliss
Surely be yearns to leave and uplift this.
The pang of anguish in his piercing cry.
His strains of quivering white fire from the
spheres,
His songs of muffled sobs and trembling
tears—
These arc an angel’s and they cannot die !
TASMANIA.
ARTHUR ALBERT BAYLDON.
A Satchel of Books
Introducing London, by E. V. Lucas (Methuen).
This indefatigable literary wayfarer has published
at least two volumes of Wanderings in London, and
into the present concise epitome, a second edition,
he compresses their meat. It is charmingly illus-
trated by Ernest Coffin.
Where Strange Gods Call , by Harry Hervey
(Thornton Butterworth). A travelogue of Japan,
China, the Sandwich Islands, etc., by an American
novelist who describes himself as a romanticist and
aesthete. Guide-book stuff blown out with windy
rhetoric. Undistinguished illustrations by Chris-
topher Murphy.
NJS,WJsPartiai»entory Record, 182i-1025 (Govern-
ment Printer, Sydney). This invaluable little hand-
book is to the political student what Wisden's is to
the cricketing enthusiast. The eighth edition in-
cludes an alphabetical record of members of both
Houses from the first chin-waggers appointed prior
to responsible government down to the 27th Par-
liament elected last May. Old campaigners will
spend many enjoyable hours in its company.
Another Australian Abroad, by William J. Sowden
(Cole’s). Travel notes in Egypt and Palestine
1924-25 w'hich originally appeared serially in the
Register (S.A.). A close observer with a ready
pen and a keen appreciation of the genuinely beauti-
ful as well as the humorous, the writer has produced
another very readable book. It covers familiar
ground within the range of the guide and dragoman,
but for all its limitations is a brisk and entertaining
account of what the Australian may see when he
goes abroad with a well-filled pocket.
Psychology and the Church (Macmillan). A
number of papers on the subject matter of its title
contributed by distinguished churchmen and prefaced
by an introductory note from the Bishop of South-
wark. To the layman it is interesting as marking
the modern attitude of the Church to the body of
science, and knowledge generally, continually being
evolved outside the limits of orthodoxy. The atti-
tude of antagonism that marked the last century has
now almost wholly disappeared, at all events so
far as the Anglican Church community is concerned,
and has been superseded by strenuous efforts at
assimilation.
Portrait of a Man with Red Hair, by Hugh Wal-
pole (Macmillan). Mr. Walpole, as a rule, takes
his art seriously, and not. infrequently brings us into
the atmosphere of the cathedral, if not the cloister.
In his latest novel, seeking rest and refreshment
lie lets his imagination run riot in a conception
that, as he expresses it, “might invoke the great
names of Hoffman and Hawthorne for its god-
fathers.” The story turns upon the adventures of
one Harkness, an American, a inan “so shy that he
was thought to be conceited, so idealistic that he
was considered cynical, so chaste that he was con-
sidered a most immoral fellow with a secret double
life/’ He makes the acquaintance of Sir James
Maradic, and at his suggestion visits Treliss, in
North Cornwall, made familiar to readers in previous
works of this author. There he becomes involved
in the rescue of Hester Tobin from her father-in-
law, Crispin, the-man with the red hair; and round
this the unusual and 'compelling' story turns.
The Life of Benito Mussolini, by Margherita G.
Sarfatti (Thornton Butterworth). Mussolini became
Prime Minister of Italy at 39. His father was a
blacksmith who kept a wineshop as a side-line, and
his mother was a schoolmistress. Benito was
principally a journalist when at home, but when it
was expedient to go over the border into Switzerland,
as a result of too much youthful journalism, he learned
to be a stonemason and other things. He was
a full-blown and intensely patriotic editor when
Italy went into the war, and he served with dis-
tinction in that army which fought and froze and
burrowed in the snow through a dreadful winter a
mile and a half high in the Alps. His record in-
cluded 42 wounds. Mussolini spent too much of his
war time in hospital to rise very high in the
service, which was probably bad for the service, for
his subsequent doings gained him a place in the
long list of Italian soldiers and statesmen (or soldier-
statesmen) which includes Ca:sar and Bonaparte,
Cavour, Garibaldi and other luminaries past counting.
Ilis exact place on the list will be better known
when he is dead, but there is no visible reason why
it shouldn’t be a high one, bar possible enlargement
of the cranium—the disease of Cola di Rienzi and
Osesar Borgia.
Ettie Rout writes from London: —
This shows how one thing leads to another. Three
years ago my husband and I worked out a new
system of exercises based on native-dance movements.
Sir Arbuthnot Lane made many helpful suggestions,
his special interest lying in the possibility of prevent-
ing and curing stagnation in the lower bowel (con-
stipation) by means of these abdominal and pelvic
exercises. These were explained and illustrated in
“The Culture of the Abdomen” (by F. A. Horni-
brook) and “Sex and Exercise” (by myself), and
published by Heinemann. Out of the investigations
I made there arose many interesting ethnological
questions. I found that these abdominal dances were
developed as hygienic exercises by the brown nations
mainly. The reason seemed to be that these “dark
whites” specialised on cultivation —the cultivation
of the land and the cultivation of the body. But
who were these dark whites ? Starting from what
I already knew regarding the Maori, I began a re-
search which took me across the world. Native
dances, tattooing, decorative designs, terrace gar-
dens — a n four lines of research led to the same con-
clusions: that these dark whites had originated in
ancient Assyria, and from there radiated. Etymology
supports the theory. Why, for instance, should the
Maori call his head-band “tiara” and the old
Persians use the same term for the same article ?
Why should the ancient Thracians be called “Red” and
tattoo themselves, and the American Indians be called
“Red” and tattoo themselves? Just when my head was
whirling with these questions, the M.L. Government
decided to send back the Maori Sacred House from
Wembley to the Dunedin Exhibition. That released
the Maori chief in charge of the house (Mata-Atua),
and he was promptly captured to help me record
some of the Maori sacred legends, in the hope that
they might lead to some rational replies to these
questions. His evidence proved amazingly interest-
ing, so much so that I sat down for a solid 12
months to sort out these traditions. At last the
MS. was completed, and arrangements made with
ltoutledge and Kegan Paul to publish it. The illus-
trations are important. They are nearly all the
decorative designs used by the Stone-Age Man all
over the world, and all have an inner meaning: a
meaning intimately associated with the cultivation
of the body and the land.
“R.D.” About the dreariest public library in
the Commonwealth, in spite of its situation overlook-
ing the river, provides deadbeats with a dusty
sanctuary in Brisbane. Founded about 20 years
ago, it doesn't seem to have added to the miscel-
laneous assortment of books it started with, and
the ones it has are badly arranged. Most Melbourne
suburban municipalities have better libraries, yet
the one in Brisbane has to do duty for a large
State, and ought to have Queensland’s historical
records in its keeping. A few weeks ago it let the
journals of Landsborough, the explorer, go to a
private buyer. Some' people say that it isn’t the
duty of public libraries to buy and preserve such
records ; but whose is it then ? Obviously they have
a value to the whole community, and ought to be
published and kept. It is hardly worth while to
pay for the upkeep of a public library if its only
function is to provide tables where tired people can
go to sleep over the Beekeepers’ Gazette or the
journal of the local Rechabites.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Farewell.
The light of sunset sleeps
Upon yon still lagoon,
And in its rosy deeps
The she-oak shadows swoon.
With wreathed clouds round his head,
And red and violet fires
About his pathway spread,
The Lord of Day retires.
Where low, her day at noon,
She bides, remote and large,
He signals to the moon
To take the world in charge.
Right well and royally
Has he, from hour to hour,
Ruled subject land and sea,
Sea-flower and forest-flower.
Wave-ways and woodland-ways,
And all that blooms and blows,
Beneath his farewell rays
Salute him as he goes.
All voiceful things and dumb
By his descent are stirred.. ..
And in yon ancient gum
Hark to the butcher-bird!
Hark, hark, for it is he
Who lifts the sweetest notes
• In all the minstrelsy
That flows from feathered throats !
Upon the odorous air,
In farewell to his lord,
Like sparkling wine and rare,
His radiant song is poured.
Behold, the sun has gone,
And o’er the still lagoon,
Where floats one songless swan,
Upglides the pallid moon.

A Cherry Orchard.
A cherry orchard in the spring!.
I wonder if a lovelier thing
Was ever fashioned on these lonely hills,
When like still foam the blossoms lie
Stretched to the wide, white-clouded sky
And errant petals fleck the hurrying rills.
A cherry orchard summer-kist!
Out of morning’s fleeting mist
Rise the long slopes of pale and rippling
green ;
And every sunlit, swaying tree
Tosses a crimson panoply
Under the jealous leaflets’ quivering screen.
To autumn it is given to wield
The wand that leaves the wood and field
Besprent with gold; and reckless she will
light
The cherry groves that there may run
iwagues of red flame beneath the sun,
Unquenched save by the coming of the
night.
A cherry orchard bleak and bare!
Still a strange beauty lingers where
Stark trees to the white skies their
branches fling;
And even as the drear wind soughs
About the naked, rain-washed boughs
A blackbird calls that he has talked with
Spring.

A Jaunt with Memory.
Memory halts outside my floor
And calls aloud for me
To ride as oft I rode before.
“But first,” says Memory,
“We’ll drink a Yuletide stirrup-cup
To all the girls we knew
And laughed and danced and jested with,
And to old comrades true!”
My foot’s within the stirrup set,
The leather’s ’twixt my knees;
I'm rocking o’er the boundless plain,
Whipped by the boist’rous breeze;
And lo! old songs forgotten long,
Rise to my lips amain ;
My hair turns brown, my veins throb fire,
For I am young again !
And poor again ! But oh so rich
In friends and happiness!
There seems no height I may not scale
With splendid health to bless.
Now' down the brown and winding road
There rides my Rosalie;
The sunset glow is on her face,
Dust rises to her knee.
Her hair streams like a tawny mane,
Wind flutters tie and sleeve;
Nut-browni her cheek, faint-flushed with rose,
Her eyes as blue as eve.
How can I hope to paint for you
The picture that I see?
No language could describe a scene
So joyous, fair and free.
I only know that when she came
Dew turned to spangles bright;
With greener trees in crystal air,
The earth w r as clothed in light.
No fragile beauty Rosalie,
But strong, and lithe and brave,
Who like a centaur rode, and warm,
Frank friendship gladly gave.
I loved her firm, fine honesty,
Her straight and steadfast gaze,
Her carefree laughter, lilting song,
Her thousand winning ways.
Oh. all the paths I rode with her,
The greetings and good-byes,
Were glimpses of a pilgrim soul
Into his Paradise 1
Then rein the foaming steed, so I
May slip inside my door!
I’m old. and married, and content;
And ho.w can man wish more?.
And yet, at festive times like this,
Beyond home’s boundary
I steal, to drink to other days,
And jaunt with Memory!

NORTH AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES.
North Australia gets little attention from
southern politicians, and that little is mostly
of the wrong sort; nevertheless, the history
of its development during the past decade
contains one bright and encouraging chapter,
in spite of droughts, strikes and other han-
dicaps to progress, its most important in-
dustry has gone ahead steadily since 1915.
In that year the Queensland sugar-farmers
cultivated 153,027 acres, of ivhich 94,459
acres were harvested for a yield of 1,152,516
ioo4 canp 140,496 tons of sugar. In
o-e the cultivated area had increased to
acres, of which 167,649 acres were
treated for a yield of 3,171,341 tons of cane
and 409,136 tons of sugar; and the 1925
production of sugar is estimated at 484,630
tons. In 1920 there were 4000 canegrowers ;
this year there are upwards of 6000. It used
to take nearly 10 tons of cane to make a
ton of sugar. Last year the average was
l-7p tons, and the average for six years
had been 7.79. This result is largely attribut-
te tbs research work of the uhemiata
in charge of the Government Experiment
Stations, who are rendering valuable service
to Australia, as also are the officers engaged
in entomological and field operations. Inci-
dentally, three graduates of the Queensland
University have, been sent abroad, to study
different branches of the industry, and three
students now at the University are being
trained for the experiment stations. And
nowhere has the industry made greater
strides than in the tropical North. ~ Says
H. T. Easterly, Director of the Bureau of
Experiment Stations:—
The increase that has taken place in the yield of
sugar in those districts to the north of Townsville
since 1910 is exceedingly interesting. It has naturally
been recognised that such districts, with their high
rainfalls and humid atmospheres, are the trjie home
of the sugar-cane plant. The development in recent
years, however, has been rapid, and a far larger
increase in population has taken place during the
past few years than in any other part of Queensland.
If expectations are realised, the region
north of Townsville will yield more sugar
this season than the whole State produced
in 1910. In that year the output above
Townsville was 57,135 tons out of 210,756;
this season’s estimate is 215,550 tons above
Townsville and 269,050 in the rest of the
State.
* * *
The renewal, with modifications, of the
fixed-price arrangement under which the
sugar industry has been working since July,
1920, has removed the grower’s feai-s as to
the Australian market, for the. next three
years at all events. Nevertheless he is now
producing a lot more sugar than the Aus-
tralian market can absorb, and, except in
abnormal times, he cannot sell abroad at a
profit. When the strike madness abates the
British preference will help,* but it is not
nearly substantial enough to enable him to
compete with the foreigner, whose labor-cost
is only a fraction of his own. One of the
travelling students reports that the aver-
age wage paid to all classes of labor in
the Java sugar districts is a little over
a shilling a day, while unskilled laborers
get 94d. a day. So it looks as if the
industry will have to mark time until growth
of population warrants an increase in the
area under cane, or until a steady demand
sets in for by-products now going to waste.
Proposals for the utilisation of these by-
products are published every now and then.
A year or so ago some American capitalists
were going to buy up all the megasse they
could get and turn it into the material known
as celotex. Nothing lias been heard of this
scheme lately. There is a disposition in
certain quarters to go into transports of
enthusiasm over the xvonders which Ameri-
can capitalists are going to perform in Aus-
tralia, but it will be time enough for the
transports when tlie wonders have been per-
formed. There are also plans for the con-
version of molasses into power alcohol, in
particular, “it is proposed to erect a distil-
lery at the Plane Creek Central sugar-mill
for dealing with molasses and cassava, the
latter of which is to be grown.” A little has
been done in the power-alcoliol line already,
and a lot more needs to be done, especially
as vast quantities of molasses which might
be used for industrial purposes are wasted
every year—3,727,846 gallons were con-
signed to drains in 1924. But the Common-
wealth Government is *not nearly as en-
thusiastic as might be expected considering
the importance of the subject. When it was
asked to assist the cassava project it said
that it couldn’t afford more than £5OOO p.a.
for five years, and then the power alcohol
would have to be produced—-no power alcohol,
no bounty. It has given £14,582 in one year
to a wealthy southern jam-manufacturer who
cans fruit as a side-line.
* * * *
Very likely the cultivation of tobacco could
be profitably combined with that of cane-
sugar in North Queensland, as it is in Cuba.
Australia is a huge importer of tobacco
leaf, and its spasmodic efforts to produce
the article on its own account have
met with indifferent success, mainly, it is
suspected, because the experiments have
been made in the wrong region. They have
been restricted to comparatively cold south-
ern districts, whereas nearly all the imported
stuff comes from tropical and sub-tropical
countries, such as Brazil, Cuba, the Philip-
pines, the S’African Union, the Dutch East
Indies and (above all) the Southern States
of Coolipge’s Republic. It does not take
long to make a first-class industry of tobacco
cultivation where the conditions are favor-
able. In 1862 Dutch planters began grow-
ing the Indian weed on the east coast of
Sumatra, which can be reached in a few
hours by seaplane from Wyndham (W.A.),
and where it was unknown before. Within
a few years every cigar manufacturer in the
world was buying Sumatra tobacco for the
outside wrappers of cigars, and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture was planting
Sumatra seed. The British North Borneo
industry dates from 1883 and was firmly
established in a decade; and the Rhodesian
plantations, which export pipe tobacco to
this country in increasing quantities, have
a still more recent history. In many parts
of North Australia the soil and climate are
similar to those of Rhodesia, and also to
those of Virginia and North Carolina, where
the yellow cigarette tobacco of commerce is
grown in loose sand with a clay subsoil.
There is no reason to doubt that, with the
Protection already afforded (there are duties
ranging from Is. 6d. to 13s. per lb.) and
judicious prodding of the dominant cotnpany,
all the cigarette and pipe tobacco smoked in
this Commonwealth could be grown in North
Queensland. North Westralia and the North-
ern Territory. In that case there would be
a good living for 3000 or 4000 planters work-
ing full time, and several times tjiat num-
ber of cultivators would add materially to
their incomes if (as is most desirable)
tobacco were combined with sugar and other
crops, such as cassava and sorghum for the
power-alcohol distilleries. As the unsympa-
thetic Buchanan records, the Federal Pub-
lic Works Committee was told in 1921 by
W. S. Campbell, sometime N.S.W. Direc-
tor of Agriculture, that “a splendid type of
tobacco could be grown in the Northern
Territory.” The Superintendent of Agri-
culture in the Commonwealth’s neglected
possession has said the same thing on many
occasions; in his 1924 report he suggested
that a tobacco expert should be added to ! his
staff, inasmuch as “we have had abundance
of evidence in the past that tobacco will
grow in the Territory,” and “the production
of a well-graded article of good quality
would mean a certain sale at satisfactory
prices in the southern markets.” The un-
happy man’s representations have, of course,
been ignored. Pearce being Minister for the
Territory. Yet tobacco might do as much
for Pearce’s province as sugar has doiffi for
North Queensland. In the latest year for
which details, are available tobacco valued
at £3,213,264 (£2,854,897 worth was unmanu-
factured) was imported from 16 countries.
THE TEACHER THAT ISN’T.
In the business of world-civilisation and the
still more important business of handing on
the gains of that civilisation from one gen-
eration to another, the teacher should fill
the most important place. His task is
the widest of all; and his calling should stand
highest among the professions. In practice
it is far from doing so; and though once
or twice in an age the headmaster of some
secondary school may win a reputation which
places him among the great, the rank and
file of teachers of primary schools take their
places _ with second-grade stationmasters.
Even in the remote country village the
teacher is rarely regarded as the leading
person of intellect in the place; he has little
prestige, his word goes no farther than that
of the man at the motor-garage. Under such
circumstances—and remembering that his
salary is usually on a level with the local
regard for his mental qualities—it is hardly
surprising that there is a constant unsatis-
fied demand for young teachers. As a pro-
fession it does not attract the right people.
For years this lack of attractiveness was
little in evidence because the teacher’s job
could be made a stepping-stone to so many
other things. For a young man without
money or influence to become a teacher was
to find a path from the ranks of manual
labor to something which offered larger social
and intellectual opportunities; to-day a boy
of real ability by the aid of scholarships
may find an entrance into one profession as
readily as another. And when the relative
attractiveness of commerce, medicine or law
as compared with teaching is considered, the
wonder is, not that there is a shortage of
teachers, but that any take up the teaching
business at all. Yet the original proposition
must stand that the teacher’s job is the
most important to the State. All our gains
in every department of knowledge must be
heavily discounted if they cannot be carried
forward to the future; and to secure this
continuance we must have teachers of real
ability and enthusiasm.
The proposal to import teachers from
abroad has something almost tragic about
it. Nearly a school generation must pass
under alien influences before the imported
teacher can catch the spirit of the new land;
and meantime the children under his influ-
ence are either twisted away from a national
conception of things or acquire a contempt
for learning because of the medium through
which it is forced upon them. Nor does the
shortage of teachers work towards securing
the best even of those who might have a
special aptitude for handling the youngsters.
People are more likely to join the depleted
teachers’ ranks from motives that have little
to do with education ; and the effect of this
has already been seen in some districts in
the wmrk of the party-politician teacher. A
school is a splendid centre for the broad-
casting of propaganda or the preaching of
fads; and the people who are attracted to
the profession with that in mind are apt to
be both a nuisance and a danger. The time
teacher may hold what private views he likes,
but he should keep an even balance in all
things and make no attempt to limit the
free thinking of the future. Yet while the
State is forced into the position of taking
whatever it can get or leaving the children
untaught, the grossest sort of evils is readily-
overlooked. The position is bad, and shows
every tendency to become worse; yet it is
very much to be doubted whether it can
be improved by any method recently sug-
gested. To turn elder scholars into tem-
porary teachers after a short six months’
training, as proposed at a recent confer-
ence, could hardly do more than waste the
time of these young people by leading them
down a side-track which could open up no
real prospect for the future; to attempt to
fill the gaps by generally increasing salaries
and promises for the years to come is to
undertake enormous burdens which the first
retrenching Government may cast from its
shoulders, to the dismay and injury of the
whole profession. That salaries, particu-
larly in the higher grades, must in the end
be greatly increased goes without saying;
but long before that is done there should he
a review of the entire position. It is just
possible that if the question' of primary edu-
cation throughout Australia were thrown into
the melting-pot it might be discovered that
economies could be effected that would go
far towards lifting the status of the teacher.
The first step towards reform should be a
more definite "understanding of the tiring
aimed at. Primary teaching to-day presents
a confused and confusing picture; and it is
probable that, except in a few small corners,
full value for money spent is nowhere being
obtained. Looking back over the past, where
the picture is in better focus, it can be stated
that no teacher ever obtained such fine results
as the hedge schoolmaster—the man who for
sheer love of teaching gathered the children
of a village together and drove the rudiments
of learning into them with enthusiasm and
a stick. To reproduce under system and
order the teacher of such a type is not impos-
sible ; but it is impossible under existing edu-
cational restrictions. Men of splendid enthu-
siasm still exist; the trouble is that the en-
thusiasm is damped and often destroyed
through the perpetual interference of theor-
ists gathered into a headquarters staff. These
people do not ask for a teacher but for a
teaching machine —a man who will observe
useless forms without putting brain or heart
into the matter. In practice there are men
and women who contrive to teach well in
spite of this, in spite of so-called American
improvements and the abolition of the alpha-
bet ; but while we must be thankful for these
the fact remains that we do not allow them
to do their best. This is the very heart of the
matter, We have allowed the teacher’s work
to be narrowed, ordered him to do things in
wliich he has no faith, perpetually hampered
him with new fads, made him a servant of
tables rather than a free apostle of learning
and generally reduced his outlook to one of
emotionless routine. That he has done as
well as he has under the circumstances is one
of the modern miracles. But he does not like
it; and younger people looking at his job and
his prospects do not like it either. To restore
teaching to the high place it should fill we
must first of all restore the teacher’s self-
respect. He must have a great deal less
ordering about and a great deal more elbow*-
room ; he will be worth a bigger salary,
and he should get it. Then the new recruits
will come along briskly enough, eager to fill
places of usefulness and honor.
THE CITY OF DREADFUL FRIGHT.
The newspapers, municipal authorities and
citizens of some Australian cities have
lashed themselves into an unnecessary state
of panic over the traffic question. Even
little Perth occasionally fulminates about
the matter, and the possibilities of Dog s
Flat deciding that it has the busiest corner
in the world and that an expert should bo
sent to the U.S.A. to inquire about it are
possibilities of the not-distant future. Mel-
bourne, however, is the worst offender. A
recent ukase of its Council decreed that
no ’buses shall henceforth enter the precincts
of the city. Citizens in future must tramp
into the countryside to reach a vehicle. The
reason given for this precaution is that
the arteries are horribly congested, do
not function as they should, and are dan-
gerous to life, limb and the fragile Ford.
The real reason is compounded of vainglory
and lack of self-confidence. The vainglory
makes Melbourne think it has a traffic pro-
blem, and the absence of self-confidence makes
it think it is incapable of solving it.
As for the first trouble, anyone who has
seen the slowly-moving streams of Picca-
dilly and escaped from the rapids of the
Place de I’Opera, the Nevsky Prospect (be-
fore the Deluge), the Orchard-road of Singa-
pore and the Ta Ma Du of Shanghai can
survey the traffic conditions of Melbourne
without losing his head or having nightmares
about the future. The geniuses who laid
out the city can be thanked for that, and
it only requires that the inheritors of the
splendid plan should use ordinary common-
sense for all the imagined evils to be avoided.
The notion seems to be that a city of nearly
a million inhabitants shouldn’t have more
than two dogs and a commercial traveller’s
victoria in a single street at one and the
same time. The moving phalanxes of typists,
shop-assistants, parsons and pickpockets that
tramp cityward in the morning and pour
homeward in the evening, and the stream of
cars and ’buses that pours along between the
pavements at the evening “peak” hours, give
the various authorities a fresh attack of jim-
jams every day. In a well-regulated city,
say the alarmists, they oughtn’t to be there.
Up to a few weeks ago all that this wan-
derer knew of Melbourne was'gleaned while
he cooled or overheated his soles in Collins-
street in the interval between the arrival of
the express from Adelaide and its departure
for Sydney, or vice versa. He had also heard
and believed the calumnies circulated about
the place in Sydney. All the Melburnians
he had met suffered from a pronounced in-
feriority complex and believed those calum-
nies. Most of the Melburnians he has lately
talked with are apologetic about the glories
of their city. “Of course, you know,” they
murmur shamefacedly, “it isn’t Sydney.”
Observation has convinced him that it quite
certainly isn’t Sydney. Remove the harbor
that the good god Geography gave to Sydney,
and the shambling metropolis of Australia
is revealed as a gaudy slattern bedizened in
somewhat dubious taste. But Melbourne is
one of the comely cities of the world. It has
trees —too few of them, but more may come
—in its main thoroughfare, a feature un-
known in any other Australian capital. It
has wide streets that show off the importance
of its sometimes very living architecture,
and the wide streets are diversified with small
ones wherein the atmosphere of homeliness
and mystery has leisure to grow up. It
has charming antiquities called cable-cars
that murmur softly along the boulevards,
clatter down the inclines, take the bends
until a flourish while the gripman chants
“Mind the corner,” and which are rooted
so deeply in the affections of the men who
run them that a recent attempt to initiate
a regulation strike broke down through the
staff’s sheer inability to do the pretty things
an injury. It is to be regretted that these
gentle objects are to be replaced by noisy
electric juggernauts in imitation of tile, great
exemplar, Sydney;
But the famous Fiinders-street intersec-
tion, which is believed to be the city’s shame,
is Melbourne's chief crown and glory. Two
hundred and fifty thousand people, I am told,
are daily deposited there by that wizard, Mr.
Clapp. His fast, smooth, clean, plentiful
and punctual electric trains are waiting in
the evening on two sides of the city’s square
formation to evacuate this army, and they
do it. as I have seen with my own eyes,
without a hitch. Straight out from the
centre of the city goes the St. Kilda-road.
It is the only road I know on this continent
that provides peace of mind and aesthetic
satisfaction as well as dustless and speedy
transport. Down its middle gravely amble
the cable-cars full of babies and old ladies;
on each side of them goes the horse-borne
traffic, and on two trackways that shine
under the cool green canopy provided by
stately trees rush the more adventurous
petrol'eers.
The Fiinders-street intersection, as well
as being a busy corner, is a major revela-
tion of the Australian psyche. The multi-
tude that tramps across it, directed by a
courteous policeman wdio has evidently learnt
eurythmics in a ladies’ high school, doesn’t
resemble the same phenomenon in any other
part of the world. It hasn’t the note of in-
telligent, crushed docility of the Berlin
phalanxes or the cruel abandon of the Paris
mob. It isn't slow, hopeless, netted in the
enormity of its own numbers, like the London
crush, and it hasn’t the brutal features of
the Bombay or Shanghai scene, where white
men in motor-cars ride down the native-


born. Here the moving-picture magnate in
his Hispano-Suiza must wait with the same
patience as the gasman in his handcart. The
spectacle is one of a sober democracy going
about its business with a minimum of fric-
tion, a maximum of mutual tolerance, good
humoi; and individual confidence in the com-
monsense, decency and toleration of its com-
ponent parts, that the politicians would do
well to take to heart.
Standing on the corner of William and
Collins streets where the A.M.P., that all-
Australian institution, has built itself a
home, I read on a brass-plate that here
Batman 88 years years ago set up Mel-
bourne’s first white habitation. Melbourne
seems to have done pretty well in the in-
terim. It has solved with fair success what-
ever problems it has had to face. How
much has it had to depend on its own re-
source and how much on outside advice and
help, which, incidentally, have been avail-
able to Canton (China), Moscow, Brunei
(Borneo) and Swakopmund without achiev-
ing any notable success? Yet Melbourne
isn't satisfied. Being convinced firstly that
its traffic lias become unmanageable, and
secondly that it hasn’t itself got the nous
to manage it, it proposes to send a policeman
to get the advice of foreign experts on the
subject. Rather is it time some of the
foreign experts came to study Melbourne.

If the N.S.W. Upper House Won’t
Suicide.
A natural but unlooked-for complication
has arisen in N. S. Wales politics, and
threatens difficulties for a Government which
may have mistaken boorishness and incivility
for strength and a long-distance bellow for
long prevision. The Upper House is re-
ported to be considering whether it will turn
on its executioner and rend him for a holi-
day diversion. On appearances the pro-
gramme which it was to follow was cut and
dried, but the driest programme is liable to
spring a leak. It was planned that the
Council should vote its own abolition, and
die gratis as it had ostensibly lived. That
is to say, each member was to give up his
dignity and the social advantages attached,
his pleasant quarters, including library and
refreshment-room, and his chance of becom-
ing a salaried Minister, or President, or
Chairman of Committees, or one of the three
paid M’s.L.C. on the Public Works Com-
mittee. He was to do this out of a desire
to please the rudest Ministry that ever
roared hereabouts. And lie couldn't be
openly and adequately bribed to vote as re-
quired ; and, though he might be allowed as
a reward to retain his free rail and tram
pass for life, that would only be giving him
what he has already. Even if the* men who
made the foolish sacrifice were assured that
they would be provided with billets or Assem-
bly seats as soon as there were sufficient to
go round, it would be the poorest! kind of
satisfaction. The Ministry might not live
long enough to fulfil a tithe of ids* obliga-
tions. It might have to break its promises
to the dupes who had given up thieir “pull"
because individuals with a live “pujll” de-
manded consideration. In other words, the
trusting folk might find themselves in the
same forsaken hole as Con Wallace, who
made way for Ryan, and died amid poverty
and ingratitude. Even if some of them were
rewarded with jobs, a new Ministry might
cancel these in summary fashion. The Lang
Cabinet has set up so many precedents for
such a course that a job would be hardly
worth taking. One reason why the N. S.
Wales Leg. Council might take up a high
moral attitude and stand its ground is that
the Government is short of a manjdate for the
abolition of the Chamber. The matter was
not put definitely in the programme on
which the Ministry acquired its skimpy
majority. There is something in the general
Labor programme about the abolition of
Second Chambers, and the substitution of
the referendum, initiative and recall; but the
abolition of a Second Chamber and the sub-
stitution of nothing is different. The Min-
istry doesn’t propose to seek definite autho-
rity on the abolition issue by a general elec-
tion or by making the referendum part of
the political apparatus and ascertaining
popular opinion that way. It posisibly dis-
likes the referendum worse than the other
thing, and, lacking either test, the Upper
House can say it stands solidly for public
sentiment, and that the Lower one doesn’t.
An Upper House can say what it darned
Well pleases, and a Lower one alao. It was
assumed that the 25 fecently-appointed Coun-
cillors were put in expressly pledged to put
themselves out again, and put their col-
leagues out with them, but the Government
has attested proudly that they are ifree men,
in which case they may act as sucll. It has
been declared, not as an argument but as
a threat, that in the event of trouble Pre-
mier Lang will make another batch of
appointments, and that the new appointees,
at all events, will be reliable suicides. Against
this it is just possible to carry too far thfc idea
that the Premier makes appointments cfe his
own bat, and that Governor r»E Chatr? has
ceased to officiate. Ilis Ex. might say ithat
if the Premier selected the wrong crowdllast
time he must put up with the consequences.

This Undesirable Allotment For Safe
Dear.
The recent attempt of a Melbourne land
agency to bring down the horrors of the law
on a pair of employees led to no result so
far as the horrors were concerned, buff it
threw a ray of light on agency methods.
The tale drifted along like this: —
Mr. Drizzle, in opening, said Mizzle* the male
accused, had been employed by Fizzle and Co. as
a superintendent salesman, and was - entitled under
agreement to receive 50 per cent, on money paid
by a purchaser on any block of land sold by him,- and
also 25 per cent, of all instalments on sales as they
were paid.... As a superintendent salesman he em-
ployed a team of salesmen and paid the men him-
self, sending in weekly reports showing the amount
paid to the salesmen and the amount coming to
himself.
X. Y. Z. Whizzle, director of Fizzle and Co., pro-
duced receipts signed Ify Mizzle —£s4 for Septetnber
19, £64 for September 25, £64 for October 2, £34
for October 9, and £B4 for October 16.
Various statements about the alleged affec-
tionate relationship between the male
accused and a romantic fellow-employee,
Miss Grizzle, and re alleged complications
in the matter of love’s young dream and a
false passport, had no bearing on the public
aspect of the case, which concerned land
dealing in general. The salesman’s commis-
sion, huge as it looks, is a mere drop in the
bucket of expense. The handsome offices
cost something, also the staff of well-
appointed clerks and clerkesses. The adver-
tising is the kind of persuasive literature
which runs into money, and so do the illus-
trations by the leading green-and-blue artists
of the day. There are many other expenses,
including motor-cars to take Chizzled to
the scene of action, where he buys the allot-
ment. On top of all the boss of the firm
wants a trifle for himself. He may even
want a fortune for himself. Wherefore two
questions arise: (1) Suppose some hypo-
thetical animal, say a spider, bought an
outer suburban area at £2O per acre, would
he have to charge a fly £2O per foot in order
to pay all the sundries and all the spell-
binding middlemen and middlewomen and
middle girls, and finish up with a satisfac-
tory profit? Or won Id he need to charge
more? (2) If the trade is in any sense the
supplying of a genuine want, and not the
beguilement of silly people into parting w r ith
their poor savings in return for an exorbi-
tantly priced bit of frill which they don’t
want, why should the vast apparatus of per-
suasion and bluff be paid for at all? People
who furnish necessaries of life, such as meat,
certainly put up a brisk competition, but
not to the extent, of giving their bagman 50
per cent, commission on the order, and motor-
ing the customer to look at the steak in
advance —all ultimately at said customer’s
expense. It would be a striking innovation
if all the advertisements, sale contracts, etc.,
had to state, in clear and conspicuous type,
the official tax valuation, worked out to per
quarter-acre or per foot frontage, which the
desirable estate carried before the cutting
up process was entered upon. And it is
high time that Sunday trading in allotments
was suppressed. On some of the beauty-
tracks outside Sydney the spectacle of the
numerous agent, lurking in the shadow of
his open door that he may snare the deposit
of the Sunday picnicker, has become a jest,
and the 20,000 boards announcing that this
unique, unparalleled and coruscating pro-
perty is going in small lots under the aus-
pices of EArbiter and Co. hinder the view
of the landscape.

A Backward Infant.
The first aeroplane flight took place a little
over 22 years ago, and since that time quite
a lot of attention has been paid to aviation.
But although everything has been done that
the most sanguine of prophets predicted
might be done if men once attained mastery
of the air—indeed, performances have quite
outshone predictions—the fact remains that
the introduction of human flying lias made
very little difference to a vast majority of
the civilian population. It has been said
of aviation —it is said every time the flying
business has a birthday or an anniversary—
that it is the “infant of science,” advanced
to unnatural precocity by the Great War.
Certainly it has profoundly influenced the
art of war, but in other respect the
term infant is still applicable. To realise
this, it is only necessary to compare the pro-
gress of the aeroplane with that of the auto-
mobile. The motor-car had only a very few
years’ start of the aeroplane—both were pro-
ducts of Gottfried Daimler’s invention of
the internal combustion-engine—but whereas
humanity took to the motor-car as a duck
takes to water the aeroplane makes friends
but slowly. If the motor-car and its conse-
quences could be suddenly and magically
abstracted from the earth, civilisation itself
would reel under the loss. But the abstrac-
tion of the aeroplane would not worry even
the defence authorities very much, since their
loss would be shared by all prospective
enemies. It is notable that even those who
are most strongly impressed with the import-
ance of flying, and who most strongly believe
that it will eventually be the principal means
.of transport, speak apologetically of the pre-
sent condition of the science. Professor Low,
for instance, the highest English authority
on petrol-motors, prefaces a recent essay on
the future of flying by remarking that to-day
flying is uncomfortable, that it looks ex-
tremely unsafe for those who undertake it,
that both ’planes and aerodromes give an
impression of being temporary makeshifts,
and that the fearful noise of the engines
makes people sick. A very just indictment,
too. To these disabilities has to be added
•the fact that aerodromes are always in most
out-of-the-way places, emphasising the diffi-
culties of starting and landing. The effect
on the publi'c mind of these things is ob-
vious, and when to these disabilities is added
the inherent human terror of vast altitudes
and the fact that aviation is still an ex-
tremely costly business, it does not seem
to be necessary to look much further for
the reason why there are a hundred thousand
motor-cars to one aeroplane. Professor Low
proposes to wean mankind from its coward-
ices and prejudices by making aeroplanes
larger, more comfortable, quieter and much
cheaper. He prophesies that the aeroplane-
motor will go through the same stages as the
automobile-motor—horse-power will increase
for a while, but after that attention will be
paid to economising power and getting the
same results with very much smaller and
less petrol-thirsty motors. Eventually, he
thinks, the petrol-motor wall disappear, and
electric power, wirelessed through the ether,
wall be used for all purposes. These things
may come to pass, but before sky-riding be-
comes really popular it wall have to be
demonstrated, not that the aeroplane is as
safe as a motor-car, which wouldn’t be much
of a claim, but that it is “as safe as a
church.” Any doubts as to the safety of a
vehicle that suspends itself a mile high over
nothing are likely to prove fatal to its
general acceptance.

A Use for the Legislative Council.
Dear Bulletin, —Though the N. S. Wales
Leg. Council is now regarded as doomed, it
will be a p'it.v if it entirely disappears from
the political landscape. The Council has a
curious interest from the that it fills in
constitutional history. It represents the first
serious and voluntary recognition by Britain
of the right to self-governiftent of those who
had laid the foundations off a new State. The
revolt of the American colmies and the for-
mation of the United Stales did not estab-
lish any precedent for legislative freedom.
Its effect was rather the Reverse; and Eng-
lish statesmen were inclined to strengthen
their grip upon remote colonies with the idea
of preventing another catastrophe of the
same sort. The Legislative Council was the
first indication that the t*le of thought had
turned; and there is a r<sal sense in which
it is the mother of all frae Parlia-
ments in British lands. To ’permit it to re-
main as an advisory body—-iUnecessary with-
out legislative functions —mtigvit be to restore
some of its ancient honfoiv The recent
appointments have all been, made on a politi-
cal basis, but as an adviaory body it could
be filled with experts in various’ departments
whose votes would count for nothing, hut
whose voices, speaking without party heat,
would count for a good deal* Parties in
power might then have a reasonable fear of
the effect of the pronouncements! of the Coun-
cil on public opinion without lifting able to
denounce it for legislative obstruction. If
every best lawyer and medical: man, every
highest expert in the nortfpolitieal activities
of the State and every person vrtho rendered
highest service to the community in some
valuable public capacity or department of
thought, were from gen edition to generation
made a member of the Council, it might re-
port from time to time With great effect. It
could thus become a kind’of public auditor of
accounts other than financial —a judge slim-
ming up for the democratic jury, but leaving
verdict and sentence alilce in the hands of
the citizens. The present- advantage of such
an arrangement would he that it could en-
tirely eliminate the constitutional difficulty
of complete abolition, it bill, agreed to by
the chamber itself, whidh simply re-defined
the duties of the Council, might completely
cover the ground; and within 20 years
Lang’s best or only mei norial might be the
thing he did not utter, Iv destroy.—¥ ours,

Risking' a Gtodtl Thing.
“Copabella” : With tin* passion for sys-
tematising and things which char-
acterises the wiiole-spuled-socialist, the Gov-
ernment of Queensland is 1 looking enviously
towards its ambulance service with a view
to introducing bureaucratic system and order
into it. The Queensland ambulance service
is unique in Australia, a I*l probably in the
world. It is as well organised as a metro-
politan fire-fifghting service dte the post office.
Every town of any importance —and Queens-
land has more towns of importance to the
hundred square miles than akiy other State
of the Commonwealth —has its ambulance
depot, outfit, squad of full-tim* first-aid men
and company of volunteer su fciplementaries;
and every village has its honorary first-aid
man linked with the central organisation of
the district. The ambulance-c Hr is as fami-
liar and as recognisable as the fire-car. And
the wdiole thing is based on voluntary con-
tributions from districts, suppl rrnented by a
15s. in the £ subsidy from the Government.
The organisation is run autonomously. Sub-
scribers in each district —caUfid “centres”
officially—elect a committee of -management
which administers funds and Appoints its
ambulance superintendent; and (each of these
committees sends a delegate to a general
committee in the metropolis whid'i governs
the whole ambulance service. TSie Govern-
ment does not interfere beyond s 9 bimitting
an occasional “Please explain” to the ■ general
committee should the need arise. S o much
is the service part of the life of til e State
that it is unusual for any centre ft > be in
money difficulties. A typical provincial city
has, for instance, a two-storey brt ck-and-
stone quarters with casualty-room, bait lielors’
rooms, board-, and recreation-rooms,, super-
intendent’s house, gai-age and work shops,
three fitted cars, a paid staff of sewn i (in-
cluding superintendent), a volunteer staff
of 22 and nine sub-stations (first-aid! fman)
in the country round about the centre'. Its
revenue for the past year. was £3508, and
it finished with a credit balance of JS ’ 248
after undertaking a capital expenditure ' of
£684 for new car and new car-body. The
ambulances go everywhere, everywlkien i and
without charge to the succored, even th<n igh
the journey be one of a hundred mites. Tl icy
lay down no conditions as to cases, carried
sickness, accident or infections disease. . Ps
an organisation it is one of the most nea r-
perfect things Australia has. leaves tl le
systems of other States gappin* in the rea r.
Now efficient and speedy with motors, tele-
phones and all most modern, first-aid appli-
ances, the service is the successor i»f oitn
which made great demands T»n the self-denisfl
and enthusiasm of its men—“bearer**” is*
their accepted title. Onop its most itp-to*-
date equipment was a wlnjeted and
it is the pride of the service that, a 20 k mile
tramp over unmade and scarce-made country
tracks would not deter the bearers when I the
call was heard. Then came a step in the evo-
lution towards speed—a one-horse sulky, be-
hind which the hooded stretcher was dr awn
to the scene of accident. But the beaters
pushed the stretcher back afoot—it wc tild
have jolted the patient too much to trun Hie
it behind a vehicle. With the horse-aid h *lf-
way, 20 miles ceased to be the limit of s er-
vice-travel. Followed then the standa >d
horse-ambulance, with its careful easing o\ sr
rough tracks, and then—last stage before tl
hovering ’plane-—the up-to-the-minute liosp >
tal-car and the only limit of mileage tin A
orbit of the contiguous centre. Up to a few #
months ago Queensland hospitals were run ?
on this voluntary subscriptions-cim-State-sub- -
sidy plan ; but then the idea of the system and i
order which goes with a hospitals tax was t
introduced. This implied, and resulted in,
Government control of hospitals through a
Hospitals Board in each hospital centre, with
Government nominees as supervisors. These
it was intended should co-operate with and
assist existing hospital committees, which
would still function and still draw' in the
old voluntary offerings W’ith which hospitals
were run in the past. The plan did not
quite work, however. The well-to-do, now
directly taxed to help keep up hospitals,
demurred at paying both ways. The volun-
tary subscriptions wilted considerably; so
did the enthusiasm of honorary committees,
and even the little vanities of country town-
lets which express themselves in such useful
mixtures as social service and a passion for
“running things” lost glamor under the veto
of a Government nominee. The Government
now shows a tendency similarly to “govern”
the ambulance service, and its committees
and workers are very much afraid.

How Premier Allan Wasn’t Interviewed.
Allan, the- Country Party Premier of Vic-
toria, can be unsatisfactory in a great
niany ways at once, and Treasurer
Peacock, who wears a drooping tail
these days, isn’t improved by the com-
pany he keeps. The recent struggle
with the property-elected Leg. Council was an
illustrative fiasco. The Ministry wanted more
revenue, and on the figures it wanted a lot
more than it asked for. In the year to June,
1‘)24 (the belated figures end there) the
State which men like Geobge Turner once
made a sort of model spent more loan-money
than any of its neighbors, and spent it very
badly—about £2,800,000 for railways, tram-
ways and water-supply, and £5,000,000 for
sundries, oddments and damfoolishness. But
the Government didn’t propose raising money
so as to mitigate this intoxication. All it
asked for was an extra £287,500 of tax-
revenue with which to meet the extra interest
bill arising out of the intoxication, and as
Victoria pays less in taxes than any other
State (555. Id. per inhabitant per annum
against an average of 695. Bd.) there was no-
thing visibly rapacious about that. Still, the
property-elected Chamber got on the high
horse, from which it might have been
dragged down by the neck, but wasn’t. It
didn't object to the insane loan expenditure,
but it drew the line at providing for the
insane interest bill. It took up the attitude
that there might be a deficit or a debacle or
a deadlock, but that it wouldn’t pay. The Tax
Bill was kicked back and forward, from
one House to another, like an orphan foot-
ball, till in the end the Government agreed
to surrender half of what it said was neces-
sary, and the Upper House, having suffi-
ciently asserted itself, condescended to grant
the other half. The whole business would
have been no great feat of war if the retreat
had been done gracefully, but it was effected
rather after the style of a camel trying to
get through a needle’s eye backwards. One
eventful day the Melbourne press was prac-
tically unanimous in stating that the Pre-
mier, being interviewed, said that the
Government would stand to its guns. If
the Council didn’t leave off interfering with
its finance it would either give place to a
Labor Ministry or appeal to the country,
which latter course would be orthodox, even
if rather futile. Being invited in the House
to confirm the good tidings, the Premier
did the astonishing act of repudiating the
statements of the unanimous press, denying
that there had been any interview, and even
describing one reporter as a person to whom
fact was an unknown quantity. Further
pressed, he admitted that he might have been
waylaid by a herd of pressmen in a corridor
on a Friday, and might have thrown back
a remark over the shoulder-seam of his coat
that it might be “the country or Labor.” But
he claimed that an interview wasn’t an inter-
view unless “a man went into a newspaper
office and had a talk there and answered any
questions,” and, therefore, he hadn’t really
said. anything or seen anybody, or been seen
by anybody. The House went into ribald
laughter at the idea of the agile news-
hunters waiting till a Minister went to one
exclusive newspaper and gave it exclusive
information, and the incident led to a demand
from the Australian Journalists’ Association
for the Premier’s head on a soup-plate.
Allan had plenty of time to decide on his
line of action. Even if he couldn’t remember
what he said, the obvious line was to say
that he said it, and add that he meant it.
being just that kind of hero. Then lie could
have taken off his coat, leaped on his hat
and wadec 1 into the inevitable fray with
credit, dragging Treasurer Peacock with
him if that dejected bird wouldn’t come
voluntarily. Instead, the pair confusedly
dispersed, and don’t propose to face Par-
liament again till next June.

The Petrol Tax.
The experience of Maorilaml may be cited as
a warning to any class of the Australian
community that asks to be specially taxed
or even admits that it won’t be harmed if
it is specially taxed. In the Shivery Isles,
where they have a car to every two families,
the condition of the roads has been a sore
point with motorists for years and years,
and the motoring organisations at last went
to the Government and offered to submit to
special taxation in order to get the roads
improved. The result was an ingenious piece
of legislation providing that the proceeds of a
special customs duty on tyres and those of
a special national schedule of registration
fees, plus £35,000 a year from the public
purse, should be devoted to road-mainten-
ance, and that loan moneys borrowed on
the security of the tyre duty, together with
£200,000 a year from the public purse, should
be applied to road-construction and recon-
struction. It looked as if the motorists were
going to have their contribution pretty
heavily subsidised. But in practice the
Government has always had to face a fairly
heavy annual expenditure on reading, though
theoretically the job is in the hands of local
authorities, and it probably saves something
under the new scheme. Also it has been
found that the Act, though impartially
enough administered by the Main Highways
Board, is so drawn as to ensure that prac-
tically all the money goes to the North
Island, where huge sums are needed for new
, construction, and practically none to the
"VSouth Island, where the main roads, which
sneed no construction expenditure, have actu-
|aVy fallen into greater disrepair than ever.
rSdUtliern opinion, of course, is that this is
yet another trick to fatten the North at
the expense of the South, and accusations of
(favoritism are bandied, adding rancor to a
long-standing political antagonism between
the islands. The experience indicates not
; only the difficulty of administering ear-
i marked taxes to the satisfaction of the tax-
payers, but the unwisdom of inviting taxa-
tion. From the standpoint of political
expediency, as well as that of national wel-
fare, it is preferable that such works should
be financed or subsidised out of general re-

Up before a Melbourne suburban court the
other day and charged with assaulting his
wife, an elderly baker was spoken to
severely by a stern Bench and let off on a
bond, although the evidence showed that he
had come home very drunk and dragged his
wife around the room by the hair, savagely
mauling her until she managed to escape
from the house. There was an excuse for
the beak’s leniency, however, as the unfor-
tunate wife declared that if the husband were
sent to gaol he would lose his job, with con-
sequent hardship to herself and her five
children, while if he were fined she would
have to disgorge the cash, so that she stood to
lose whichever way it went. The case is by
no means an isolated one. A large number
of Melbourne husbands indulge, in the playful
habit of wife-beating, and, as the families
are in 99 cases out of 100 in poor circum-
stances, fine or imprisonment always means
that the hapless wife and children come off
worse than the male animal. Altogether,
therefore, the wife might well wonder whether
it wouldn't pay her better in the long run
to take her beatings and keep quiet about
them.. There seems to be only one way in
which this rotten state of affairs can be reme-
died. Let the beak sentence the wife-beater
to, say, six week-ends in gaol—let it be
provided that as soon as Friday’s or Satur-
day’s work is finished the husband must
report to the nearest clink and spend his
week-end in the cells, being released on
Monday morning in time to start work again.
Such an arrangement would keep him his
job, ensure regular money for his family, and
deprive him of his days of leisure and beer,
while the prospect of an increased sentence
could reasonably be expected to persuade him
to curb his drunken ruffianism towards those
unfortunate enough to have to live with him.

“Huffin-Guffin” : The newly-arrived immi-
grant should get more help at this end. I
saw a new-comer “fra' Glasgae” the other-
day at a Vic. provincial railway-station where
he stood forlornly guarding a couple of
trunks covered with shipping labels. I asked
him if he was waiting for anybody, and
elicited that he was expecting to be met at
the station by his new T employer, to whom he
had a letter from the authorities in Mel-
bourne. As half an hour had passed since
the arrival of the train, and there was no
sign of anyone to meet the youngster—he
was scarcely more—l suggested that he put
his luggage in the station office and get a
room for the night at a hotel. He caught
at the idea; it didn’t seem to have occurred
to him previously that he could do anything
except wait for “the boss,” even if he stayed
there all night. Of course he and his kind
will soon learn to know better than to wait
indefinitely for a careless or forgetful em-
ployer, but meanwhile they should have some
brotherly attention shown them, for first im-
pressions count for a lot.

“Bill o' Costs” : Local governing authori-
ties (and legislatures too, if they weren’t
above the law) might take notice of what
may happen (in Britain, at any rate) if
they recklessly exceed their powers in the
effort to hurry up the Millennium. The
Borough Council of Poplar decided in lordly
fashion to pay a minimum weekly wage of
£4 to all its employees, regardless of sex,
age, duty or capacity, and continued the good
work for three years or more, despite the fall
in cost of living and wages generally. Under
the relative Act of Parliament, however, an
auditor is authorised to “disallow expendi-
ture contrary to law and to surcharge the
same on the persons making or authorising
the illegal payment,” and the Poplar borough
auditor promptly got to work. He took into
account the ruling wages awards and also the
pre-war rates, added to the latter the in-
creased cost of living and another 20s. a
week as a generous margin, and, finding the
total still below the £4 per week being paid
for the lowest class of labor, disallowed the
excess. Further, he proceeded to certify that
the excess expenditure, a matter of £5OOO,
must be made up by the councillors person-
ally. They appealed to the High Court to
reverse the auditor’s certificate, maintaining
that they had a right to pay whatever wages
they pleased. Subsequent appeals carried
the case to the House of Lords, which con-
firmed the auditor’s decision, holding that,
although the borough’s right to fix wages was
unrestricted, still it must be exercised rea-
sonably—a point nearly always overlooked
by people who like to act arbitrarily. Lord
Sumner, who has a turn for satirical humor,
sniffed at the reasons put forward by the
council for its action. It had intimated,
rather loftily, that it paid no regard to the
cost of living, but desired to be “a model
employer.” “A model to whom?” asked
Sumner. “If to other public authorities, the
resolution was rn.v clamontis in deserto, for
other authorities were deaf to it. If to other
private employers, the example was neces-
sarily thrown ft way on concerns which have
to make both ends meet and have not the
ratepayers’ purse to draw on.” One won-
ders casually, supposing the Sydney Council
possessed an auditor of this sort, armed
with like powers and disposed to exercise
them, how long it would be before he was
sacked, bullied, terrorised or swindled out
of his job.

“ Jesmond” : “Ernest Osborne.” writing
on the British seaman’s job (B. 10/12/’25) ,
says that even in sailing-ship days it had
“become largely an outlet for the deadbeat”
and “an unskilled trade.” The conditions
which he cites doubtless prevailed in one or
two English ports, but they were not typical
of all ports. In north-east ports at any rate
a man had to serve as O.D. or deckhand for
two years before signing on as A.B. Further,
skippers did not mark all discharges V.G.;
rarely was a ship paid off without the skip-
per “declining to report” in at least one or
two cases—as a
rule not because of
inefficiency, but be-
cause of drunken-
ness or insubordi-
nation. In regard
to inefficiency, my
own experience has
been that on the
rare occasions when
an inefficient man
was signed on, he
was given such a
bad time by the
other men that he
was glad to clear
out at the fiist
opportunity. Afad
rightly so, for Okie
useless man among
the absolute mini-
mum carried «n
tramps meant the
disorganisation of
the routine of the
whole ship and
extra work for all

There are flies in the ointment of almost
every potentate, and it looks as if there were
going to be some entomological specimens
m the unguent of the gentlemen who shovel
coal in stokeholds and decide when and where
ships are to sail, and whom and what they
are to carry. For years it lias been the
pledsant privilege of these persons to tarry
in taverns for long hours after their ships
have been supposed to sail, secure in the
knowledge that the law r and the union both
prohibit the sailing of ships until the stok-
ers have finished getting drunk. But the
Levuka, scheduled to be in Sydney on Christ-
mas Day, on her wuiy from Melbourne to
Brisbane, put a crimp in the usual pro-
gramme by sailing from Melbourne a day
late, setting her Sydney passengers ashore
by a ferryboat and then proceeding north
without giving any member of the crew an
opportunity to go ashore. Considered as an
attempt to circumvent the stoker, the law
and the union, it was not very impressive,
since the passengers were put to a good deal
of inconvenience. Also, there does not seem
to have been much point in avoiding a land-
ing at Sydney on a bar-tenders’ holiday.
But the spirit of the thing is entirely com-
mendable. Neither the law nor the union
claims for the stoker a right to get drunk
and overstay his leave at a port at which,
for any reason appealing to the owners or
master, the ship does not tie up at a wharf.
The habit of not tying up at the wharf, if
cultivated, might result in some sort of moral
suasion being exercised on stokers and their
organisation by the unions that cater for
less alcoholic members of ships’ companies.

“Xamilc" : “Trefex” (B. 26/11/'2o) errs
when he says that, given identical climate
and conditions, the wool of sheep run on
saltbush country is coarser than that of
those pastured elsewhere. Exactly the re-
verse is the fact. Saltbush grows mainly on
light-carrying country, back from the main
water-courses, in districts of medium to small
rainfall. Through the action of its vegetable
salts and lack of fat-producing constituents,
it is probably one of the most even wool-
growing plants in the country. On the
frontages where land is heavier and richer
and grass and herbage preponderate, there
is little saltbush. The effect of the two
pastures is reflected in the condition of the
sheep, and, as a natural consequence, in the
wool. That grown on saltbush will be bright,

shafty and light to medium in condition,
while that grown on the frontage usually
shows traces of discoloration, carries a lot
of grease and is more robustly grown all
round, with the fibre a shade coarser than
the other. Far-western N.S.W. wools spin
well, as “Trefex” says, but any comparison
between them and (say) our best New Eng-
land wools is absurd. The difference of 12d.
to 18d. per lb. in favor of the Northern wool
when the types are sold side by side repre-
sents about the difference in their yield.

“Centurion” : The other day a Ballarat
Quaker, a dentist by trade, protested in the
local police court against the registration of
his son for military service. The parent
even objected to the offspring being regis-
tered for non-combatant auxiliary service,
such as camp sanitation, or even the dental
corps. Everyone knew, he said, “the rotten-
ness of military camp life and its evil effects
on the morals of youth.” One may respect
the religious scruples of a pacifist, but they
give him no right to resurrect exploded false-
hoods. This particular lie was once a favor-
ite with shirkers and their supporters, but
has been so consistently refuted by military
chaplains and church workers in the training
camps that it has been practically abandoned.
Yet its revival has not attracted the slightest
notice from an apathetic Defence Department.

Mildura packers have tackled the Tariff
Board on the subject of 4000 tons of dates
lately dumped into Australia in two ship-
loads from Asia Minor. The “fruit,” packed
under the conditions described so luridly in
the press some months ago, is being sold re-
tail at 4d. a pound, with all its invisible live
stock thrown in, while Australian iexias,
which can be substituted for dates, must
bring 6fd, per lb. at lowest. The dates,
apart from the filthy methods of the Asiatic
packers, arrive in bad condition, a consider-
able proportion of cases being condemned on
landing, or else fumigated. Packers are ask-
ing that the duty be raised from Id. per lb.
to 4d., and it wouldn't do much harm if the
Board made it 4s. The old superstition that
dates won't fruit in Australia was born of
ignorance; there are huge areas where they
could be grown profitably, for they are not
costly to plant, maintain or harvest.

A last word about Surafeud from
“Xamilc” . .
Allenby’s oration to the Anzac Mounted Division
was a magnificent piece of roaring up, as “Light
House” (B. 24/12/’25) says. But what spoilt the
effect of it was his neglect to salute the Divisional
Commander —whom all revered and respected prior
to his galloping departure from the parade, and his
subsequent action in cancelling decorations to
all ranks of the Division. He certainly rescinded
this order later in consequence of a strong protest
from General Chauvel, but the honors did not
reach most of the recipients until they were back
and demobilised in Australia. Most of them would
have liked to wear the ribbon home ; the decorations
had been won on the battlefield, and the withholding
of them as a part of the “discipline” meted out for
the first serious lapse in the whole of the Division’s
service seemed to most of us unfair if not spiteful.
The Surafeud affair was no doubt deplorable, but a
complete knowledge of all the small incidents in
connection with the behavior of a treacherous native
population rendered bold and bolder by repeated
acts of propitiation on the part of the Egyptian
command goes-far to explain—l do not say condone
—it. The rifling of the dead, firing upon lone
patrols, outposts and rearguards from safe vantage
points, petty thieving from troop lines, etc., cul-
minated in the murder of a M.L. sergeant near
Surafeud by a native, just when the campaign
appeared about over. The Division had been back
but 1 a week or so from a six months’ sojourn in the
.Jordan Valley and beyond, where physical and
mental endurance had been consistently taxed almost
to breaking point and the men were in the mood to
regard this outrage as the last straw. Their exas-
peration led them —or a few of them, it would be
fairer to say—to the Surafeud raid, about which the
less said the better.

“Oxmead” : Before the Federal Parliament
takes up its quarters at Canberra somebody
might give an authoritative ruling on the
correct pronunciation of the word. Canberra
is the more popular, but Canberra has plenty
of advocates; if the latter is wrong the
second “r” ought to be cut out as mislead-
ing. There are several aboriginal place-
names in Westralia which end in “arra” on
the map, and in “ara” off the tongue. One
of them is “Dongarra,” which has always
been pronounced “Dongara" ; of recent years
there has been some attempt to spell it in
the way it is pronounced. Similarly with
the examples of Illaicarra and Bremarrina in
front of them, N. S. Wales people certainly
won’t call it Canberra so long as the second
“r” is left in.

“Harold Hardtjfp” : A check should be put
upon the evasion of industrial awards by
the granting of permits to employees to work
at lower rates than those provided; in Vic-
toria these special exemptions _ are a. great
deal too common. A new award increasing the
wages of liftmen was recently made; but
there’s many a driver who will never benefit
by it. Scores of elderly men and war-
damaged ex-soldiers are employed at the job,
and, although they may be perfectly com-
petent to do the work required of them,
their disabilities are made an excuse for cut-
ting down their pay through this channel
of “permits.” The basic principle of wage
regulation is that the good employer shall
not suffer in competition with the bad one.
This introduction of preference to the mean
boss violates that principle and deserves the
boot.

Sydney Jepiicott from the Upper Murray:
As probably the last person living who remembers
anything about the matter, I would like to place
on record an opinion of the late Baron von Mueller
upon one of Australia’s unutilised products. Thirty-
five years or more ago I was having a yarn with
the great and lovable old scientist, when his 11
o’clock cup of tea was brought in. As I was a
tea-hater he suggested a glass of milk and Vichy-
water; and while we drank our talk turned to the
subject of medicinal waters. The Baron, after
admitting that the European waters were each good
enough in its kind, added: “Howeffer, the best
mineral water —laxative mineral Water —in the world
is that produced by the well in the back yard of
Dvring’s Hotel in Tallangatta. I have drunk if
Whenever I could secure a supply; I have analysed
it minutely and I. knoiv 1 If that well were in
Europe a cSty of 30 or 50 thousand inhabitants
would have come into existence by the mere virtue
of its waters. But here” —and he waved his teacup
sadly-—“dey are asleep!” As I understand this
back yard, with many others, will be flooded out by
the great Hume Weir, it seems onh r right that this
opinion of a great scientist should be placed on
record, even if it is only in the nature of an epitaph.

In a pamphlet circulated by the Anti-
Gambling League. Ramsay Macdonald writes
that “it is folly to hope that a Labor party
can be built up in a population quivering
from indulgence in games of hazard” ; also
that “every Labor leader I know recognises
that the gambling spirit is a menace to the
Labor party.” There must be many Labor
leaders whom Rammac doesn’t know. In
N. S. Wales, for instance, 27 members of
the Parliamentary Labor Caucus wanted a
Randwick bookmaker appointed a State
M.L.C. Moreover, with the coming into
force of a Labor Government’s 44-hour-week
law, efforts are being made to dispense witn

preciation fund. Clapp avers that there
should be at least £350,000 p.a. more than
the £250,000 p.a. now set aside for rolling-
stock replacement. Again, the railways are

The Westralian Labor Government has
just nlaced a big order for steel rails in
Britain. Its excuse is that the British
quotation for TO miles of 601 b. rails landed
at Fremantle, was £27,000 less than the
Broken Hill Prop.’s price; and 160 miles ot
rails are required. The loss of this business
is the first-fruit of the N.S.W. Lang Gov-
ernment’s work-reduction policy, and there
is a lot more of the harvest to come.^
The biggest loan expenditure on N.S.W.’s
record so far was in the first year of Dooley
and Lang (£14,701,028), and the second
biggest was in their second year

for £11,255,190, the same lot ought soon to

That remarkable burrowing animal, the
N.S.W. Ministry, digs itself in apace. The
abolition of the Upper House was made
easy: as Solomon’s literary ghost remarked,
“Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a
child,” and the remark applies when he is
an unsuspecting child of Nature. There is
to be a reversion to single electorates and
the “first-past-the-post” system; it offers
advantages to a, well-organised party against
a disordered Opposition in which a I H uller
is Tweedledum and a Bruxner is Tweedle-
dec. This opens the way for a fresh shuffle
of electorates. The advantages of a good
shuffle are obvious in Queensland, where the
State, nicely divided up into electorates,
gives Communist Labor a continuous majo-
rity in the local House, while, voting as a
solid block for Federal Senate purposes, it
puts Communist Labor unanimously into the
discard. The municipal councils are to be
dissolved. In fact, there is activity, all
along the line, and if the ballot-box with the
sliding panel is kept in good condition there
should be busy times ahead.
Dalton, of the British Overseas Trade De-
partment, has made a report: —
He places in the foreground of bis picture two

the effects of high tariffs and the development of
manufactures on the drift to the city.
Naturally Dalton would perform on the old

cover that all Australia’s troubles, from big
cities to small rabbits, are due to the fact
that we don’t abandon our most reliable

by the Labor Government. Peacock, Eggle-
ston, Argyle and Goudie know that the pre-
sent hand-to-mouth system cannot go on, but
other members of the Ministry fear the politi-
cal effect of the inevitable, i.e., higher fares
and goods-rates.
Encouragement of the large family is a
prominent part of the new railway policy of
Priminister Coates of the Shaky Islands.
The family-ticket schedule is so framed that
every additional member of the family re-
duces the average charge per head, and in
the case of very large families the reduction
is so substantial that mum and dad and 11
kids can travel for exactly the same money
as mum and dad and one kid. But there
is always something objectionable about these
backstairs subsidies. It is far better to pay
straight out; then when you look at the
accounts you know exactly what everything
is costing you.
After complaining bitterly about the fail-
ures of non-Labor legislatures to pass mea-
sures wbicli Labor considers will bring in
the Millennium, although no conspicuous
amount of Millennium lias been perceived
in the five States where Labor rules, Mel-
bourne Trades Hall secretary Holloway
brightened his review’ of the dying year w T ith
one ray of sunshine. The Melbourne Trades
Hallers, who already own the largest Labor
temple in the world, are adding a new wing
of 25 rooms, costing £12,000. Some of those
bonds of oppression we hear of seem to pay
pretty good dividends.
A proposal will come before the next
A.W.U. conference that, candidates for Union

The policy 7 of the Maoriland Reform party
under Priminister Coates seems to be to
quietly knock the props from underneath the
now very wobbly 7 though once puissant
Liberal party. After a proposal to make
John Findlay, one of the most influential of
the old-time Liberals, leader of the Uppah
Chambah, knighthoods have been produced
for Henry Brett and Henry Wigram. Brett
is the kingpin of the Auckland Star, and
Wigram has been chairman of directors of
the Lyttelton Times for donkey's years, and
those two journals, by a strange coincidence,
are the only remaining metropolitan organs
under the Liberal banner.
S.A. Premier Gunn has announced one
more proposal for dealing w 7 ith the railway
problem of Adelaide’s chief seaside resort.
In early days two rival companies got the
right to run to Glenglg, and each took the
train down a principal street to the jetty
as terminus. They soon combined, and both
lines have long since been State property;
but the settlers along each railway naturally
won’t hear of the scrapping of either. The
new scheme of Railways Commissioner
Webb is ingenious. It is to (1) join the
lines at the Glenelg end and run circular
trains; (2) handle the service by rail-motors;
(3) join one line on to the main (or Mel-
bourne) line at Goodwood, thus doing away
with an awful level-crossing, and run both
into the North-terrace station ; and (4) grub
up the line from Goodwood to South-
terrace. But there is no suggestion to take
the trains out of Glenelg’s narrow’ main
street.
During the Federal election campaign it
w r as reported in Tasmania that the Primin-
ister was walling to amend the Navigation
Act so as to allow overseas steamers to trade
between the island and the mainland as in
other days. When he heard ot this, S(oft)
M (annered) Bruce was shocked, and denied
the imputation with silken firmness. Though
all the promises of the Seamen s Union about
the abandonment of job control had 8-one by
the board, and vessels were being illegally
held up and declared “black without even
the formality of an explanation, he declined to
retaliate. What he had said was that “every
effort would be made to maintain communica-
tion during the tourist season,'' except, etc.,
etc. Whatever, in short, was possible in the
way of prayer and the burning of incense
would be attended to. Westralia has been
supplied with 1052 miles of Federal railway
to cure its "isolation," and the other States,
including Tasmania, help to bear the loss. It
has been supplied with the biggest air service
in the Commonwealth, the Federal subsidy
being £30,000. a year. And it has been
granted a long-winded inquiry into its
“grievances." Tasmania has got nothing. Is
anything the matter, with it except that it
hasn’t got the same pull?
John Allan. Vic. Premier, has been get-
ting more kicks than ha pence lately, but
State employees will cherish a warm corner
in their hearts for him. For 40 years agi-
tation has been going on for the establish-
ment of a contributory superannuation sys-
tem, and for a decade or more teachers have
been calling out for more opportunities for
promotion—chances that would mitigate the
heart-breaking, hope-killing, semi-sweating
system in existence. Allan has provided both
the pensions and the promotions. True, the
preparation and piloting of the legislation
was done by his offsider, Peacock, but Allan
was game to adopt the reforms and give
them precedence in Parliament over other
measures, and to incur strong criticism for
doing so.
The Queensland Senate results show not
only a large anti-Labor majority for the whole
State, but a majority in nine of the ten elec-
torates —even Capricornia, where Forde was
given another chance, for personal reasons.
On the figures, if a State election were held
now the Labor Government would be swept
out of existence, notwithstanding that it
returned from the last election with 43 of the
72 Assembly seats. At the Greater Brisbane
election, heid on the State electoral roll, four
Labor seats regarded as safe went to the
Nationalists. Th~ coastal districts from Mary-
borough to Cairns (nearly all represented by
Labor members) felt the full force of the
shipping and waterside strikes, so the name
of Labor does not smell sweet there. By
staving the State election off till the middle
of next year, Labor may be able to save
enough from the wreck to form an Opposi-
tion. . . .
It will be difficult to restrain Queensland
versifiers from dropping into poetry over tne
by-elections to fill the seats of ox-Premiers
Gillies and Theodore, for the Opposition can-
didates are I-leale (Eacham) and Leal (Chil-
iagoe), a ready-made rhyme. The Labor
nominees are Ryan (Eacham) and O Keefe
(Chillagoe). Polling-day is January lb,
and the full force of the Government has
descended on the electorates to support the
victims of Saxon oppression. It has been
discovered that a great amount of public
work is urgently required in the two dis-
tricts. and in doubtful Eacham 1400 names
have been added to the rolls. A Labor defeat
in either division will be interpreted as a
vote of want of confidence in the McCor-
mack Ministry. McCormack and his friends
are working very hard to avert this, while
the Opposition’s efforts seem languid.
Disregarding suggestions by political and
personal friends, Alec Peacock. Vic. Trea-
surer, won’t go overseas for a trip, as Law-
son did in 1923. He has nous enough to
see that he would be criticised < isticaily
if he left his post during a period when, as
he himself avers, the finances will require
most careful handling. It looks as if he
will have to advise the Governor-m-Council
to put a small percentage on railway freights
and fares to pay the increase of 4s. 6d. a
week given by the Federal Arbitration Court
to railway employees, and he will have to
skimp somebody to avoid a deficit, as the
Dreary House saw to it that he got only
£143,500 of the £237,000 extra income-tax
he asked for.
Maoriland is purring over the Samoan
situation, having been stroked and patten
by both natives and whites for its adminis-
tration of the islands. After the war-com-
motion had subsided slightly there came the
unfortunate epidemic, and as the introduction
of the plague into Samoa was considered
due to carelessness on the part of Maori-
land health officials the Dominions popu-
larity in the mandated territory slumped to
zero. An unpopular Administration did not
improve matters, and it was not until Gen-
eral Richardson took things in hand that
the tangle began to be smoothed out. Maon-
land flatters itself that it knows how to
handle a native race, and the recent remarks
from the Samoan chiefs and the _ British
Government have confirmed it in that
opinion.
A BALLADE OF CHAIRS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are stacks of chairs that the dealers stock,
Not built for elegance, all, or grace.
A railway chair is an iron block,
I’m told, for keeping the rails in place.
But that hardly seems to fit your case,
Sir Dudley, smiling and debonair,
For Labor took but a little space
To show that you were an easy Chair.
Some chairs are proof against any shock
They give no' sign and they show no trace,
Mrs. Macquarie’s is steady as rock,
Firm as the rock that makes its base.
And one there is, ’twixt Speaker and mace,
That stands, in a manner o’ speech, four-square
To the hottest winds and the angriest face.
But, Sir Dudley, you were an easy Chair.
There are high-backed chairs that at yielding mock ;
There’s the office chair that revolves apace ;
There’s the long deck chair that a man may knock
To the angle he wants in the briefest brace
Of shakes; there are rockers, too, that chase
From many a brow the daytime s care.
And, albeit -with many a wry grimace.
You ranked for a while as a rocking Chair.
Envoy.
There’s an Upper House they will soon efface;
The fiat’s issued; the men are there.
And you may be last of your satrap race.
Well, well! But you were an easy Chair.

crashed. Registered in 1921, the latest co.
had taken over the assets of the old Stan-
more Preserving, which rash speculation in
tin-plates had forced into liquidation. The
new co/s net profits were so inconsiderable
that divs. were impossible. The co. has now
been transformed into the .Oakleaf Preserv-
ing Co., Ltd., nominal capital £150,000, all
held, presumably, by Henry Jones Co-op. or its
nominees. The last available accounts—
November, 1923 —showed total liabilities of
£88.500. Freehold and plant were in the
books at £102,053, stocks £73,309, book debts,
etc., £51,381. The co.’s position at the date
of purchase by Henry Jones Co-op. was prob-
ably less favorable than that. The terms of
the sale were not published. From the fact
that the paid capital of the _parent co. in-
creased during the term by £55,908, of which
£38,429 came from calls, it looks as if the
money from the American sale and more was
absorbed in the S’African and Sydney pur-
chases.
Shareholders in Henry Jones Co-op., how-
ever, are given very little information about
their investment. Still, holding cos. consider
that they are privileged to be reticent, which
means that the market is content to back,
more or less blindly, the men in control. In
this case the guiding hands are Henry Jones
and A. W. Palfreymen, who, having con-
quered the Speck, cast calculating, keen eyes
on other spots until the eo.’s interests were
spread to the mainland and to England,
S’Africa arid America. Last year's events
delete the U.S.A., but the rest of the field
was sufficiently profitable to pay shareholders
their 13J and send a wad to reserves. Inci-
dentally, the fact that £17,084 was won in
premiums indicates that the few new shares
were burdened with a fairly heavy loading.
One possible source of trouble for the co.
lies in legislative regulation, but that is
remote; the fact that 24 p.c. of the 13J p.c.
div. is from overseas profits takes the sting
out of what might otherwise be regarded as
an excessive div. It is this enterprise in
launching out in other lands which has won
praise for Henry Jones Co-op. and a few
other Australian cos., and this, above what
it has done to organise and stabilise the in-
dustry in the Commonwealth, is worthy of
generous recognition. The co. is also largely
dependent upon the price at which it can
buy sugar ; and thus far it has been able to
make satisfactory arrangements. Whether it
will always be able to get concessions is
another of the risks of the business.
As usual, the balance-sheet is uninforma-
tive. The chief entry, “Investments —at
cost. Shares and interests in jam-manufac-
turing and fruit cos. and timber-mills in
Australia, S’Africa and England, £1,201,871,”
compared with £1,109,756 at October 31,
1924 ; £42,500 of Commonwealth stock dis-
appeared during the year, amounts due by
subsidiary cos. rising by £39,730. Outside
debt was a nominal £252. All very comfort-
able. How the subsidiaries are positioned is
known only to those inside. They probably
have their own accumulations. But that is
assumption. The 13f p.c. divs. seem secure
enough—another assumption, of course: but
fairly safe, in view of the co.’s record. Since
its formation in 1910 it has disclosed
£1.390,688 of profits, of which it has distri-
buted £1.140,986. Capital and reserves at
October 31 totalled £1.170.570. the whole of
which is bound up in the subsidiaries by way
of shares and interests and amounts due.

Ordinary shares are chiefly in the hands of
Robert Reid and Co. They have had a rich
time, with good divs. and two gift issues,
and with it all the backing for prefs. has
been steadily improved. As at July 25 the
£150,000 prefs. were backed by net tangibles
valued at £538,860, equal to £3 11s. 10d.

The changes in balance-sheet groups were
influenced chiefly by the extensive rebuilding
operations at the co.’s splendidly situated
city premises. The directors blamed the dis-
organisation resulting from the construction
activity for part of the decrease in the year’s
net income. However, that is offset by their
anticipations of what will result from the in-
creased space and the improvement in shop-
ping facilities. Exes, showed further in-
crease during the year; this may be gathered
from the directors’ report. But that tendency
should now be checked, because, generally
speaking, wages are stationary and taxation
has, on the whole, moved favorably of late.
Considering the water in the scrip ords. did
very well at 121 p.c., and the prefs., as
already shown, are well secured in every way.

Sales were not quite un to those of the pre-
vious year, but the difference was without
significance. Still further additions are to
be made to the already extensive premises.
An adjoining property has been purchased
at Central-square, Sydney, and a new build-
ing is to shoot skywards. Trading profit fell
from £88,146 to £86,612, but the manage-
ment cut exes, by almost £2OOO. Interest
charges, too, were lighter, although the posi-
tion at the close of the accounts was less
favorable: mortgages, for instance, were
£16,000 greater, and floating debt (which in-
cludes an unspecified overdraft) £lOl,lOO
heavier at £311,662. First and second prefs.
nevertheless got their 6 p.c. and 74 p.c.
respectively and ordinaries 10 p.c., while
the amount added to reserves was sufficient
to have paid a further 6 p.c. on ords. Re-
serves, by the way, are comfortably propor-
tioned at £186,349; but, in view of the large
sum at risk in one way and another —nearly
a million and a quarter—no Harm will be
done if the Board adds to them still further.
Some of the softgoods retailers found in the
1921 slump that £100 ; 000 can vanish with
remarkable ease. Certainly Marcus Clark
was not of* these; it emerged without a
noticeable falter, and there are good grounds
for the suspicion that the office pessimist is
allowed off the chain when stock is taken
at each balance. Despite an expansion of
departments stocks moved but little last
year:—

Book debts increased substantially, and at
over half a million excite comment: they
represent the co.’s huge t.-p. business. They
have increased by more than £200,000 since
1920, and last year’s total was £65,222
greater than the previous year. That class
of business brings in fat profits, and Marcus
Clark’s have specialised in it so long that the
risks are doubtless fully provided against.
Of paid capital of £025,000, £200,000 is in
6 p.c. first prefs. and £175,000 in 7£ p.c.
second prefs. At August 1 they were secured
by net tangible assets that ran to £811,349,
including share holdings in Bon March 6,
Sydney, and Marcus Clark, Melbourne,
£149,354. Allowing cover for the prefs., that
was equal to £1 14s. lid. for each £1 ordin-
ary. And something very serious would have
to menace the house before profits would fall
below an amount sufficient to pay prefs.

Sky prices for most and high prices for the
rest of the wool plus the keenness of compe-
tition fi’om Australia and Europe made Mos-
giel’s path thorny last year, but the Dunedin
Board considered that there was nothing in
the outlook that warranted a cut in the
10 p.c. div. And £4OOO was written off for
depreciation and £1250 off “shares in other
cos.” In the 1924 accounts £3OO stood for
N.Z. and South Seas Exhibition, and £750
in British Dyestuffs Corporation. These
were the only visible items. Both have dis-
appeared from the latest balance-sheet; to-
gether they total only £lO5O, so apparently
other purchases were made during the year—
probably the Board opened its pocket wider
in the interests of the Exhibition. During
the term very little new machinery was
added—£773 compared with £7019 for 1924.
At no time, as far as this Column has dis-
covered, has the plant been carried in the
books at other than a conservative value.
That insistence on facing obsolescence —more
noticeable in, the textile than perhaps any
other industry—has placed Mosgiel share-
holders in tiie comfortable position they
occupy to-day. This comparison is illustra-
tive :

In 1910 the mill was in at £61,644. On
October 6 the book value of “land, buildings
and machinery” was £44,743, and over
£67.000 has been spent on plant in that
period. This means that the whole of the
plant put in during the past 15 years has
been paid for out of current profits and
£16,671 put by for future replacements. It
is very reassuring—if reassurance was neces-
sary.

That reduction in exes, meant a cut of 28
p.c. in 1924 figures—a decided achievement.
Yet even more was done in the preceding
term. A point to consider is whether it is
possible to reduce still further should compe-
tition press harder. It seems improbable that
much more can be done. Prospects for Aus-
tralasian woollen manufacturers are not
over-bright, but efficient management has
kept a number of cos. in a position to main-
tain diys., and Mosgiel, with its well-known
fine products, is not the least of these.

Stockton Borehole has been working since
1910. And in that long period shareholders
have received one div. —the 21 p.c. of 1924.
Last year’s troubles are thus summarised :
Frequent interruptions of work (colliery at pre-
sent—December 9 —on strike) ; increased cost of
production caused by advances in wages ; and antici-
pated further increase in production costs.
What the anticipated further advance con-
sists of isn’t .stated. However, shareholders
must be a . patient lot, or a unique band of
philanthropists, for round about one million’s
worth of coal has been taken out for a re-
turn to shareholders of £2845 —in 15 years!
None of the changes made last year in
balance-sheet figures were important. Deben-
tures were reduced by £975 to £21,840. As
a pay was due to the miners at the balancing
date total liabilities were heavier at £7095.
Against that were cash, book debts, stocks
and stores amounting to £21,643. Shares
in other cos. and deposits figured in the 1924
balance-sheet at £24,269 and the mine pro-
perty and plant at £120,653. The two items
are now amalgamated at £136,117 —£8805
less —but whether due to realisation or to
writing off is not indicated. The quality of
the coal worked is good and the equipment
up to date. The real trouble isn’t visible,
and the introductory table would promote
the belief that so far as shareholders are
concerned they are not very much troubled
about the matter, anyway.

Australia’s most progressive building society
maintained its pace last year. There were
increases in all figures. For this it owed
most to its relationship with the National
Mutual. The big Life office finds it profit-
able to entrust advances to a concern in
which it is chief shareholder and on whose
board are its general manager and one of
its directors. And the building society pro-
fits because it knows that its deposits are
stable, wherefore it can seek business with
confidence. Of course, as the ’nineties showed,
there are risks in building-society loans; but,
given a fair margin to begin with, it is good,
sound business, since each quarter’s pay-
ment removes the related advance further
into the safety zone. Not only is the
Fourth Victoria advantaged by the con-
nection, but the National Mutual even
more so, for its deposits (doubtless most
of the £890,430 held at October 31) were
secured by assets valued at £1,489,600. The
next table shows how the society has backed

Pessimism finds no place in that oufit. But
there is something as valuable as a guaran-
tee in the connection between the society and
the National Mutual which must be very
gratifying to those of the public who are
fortunate enough to hold shares. The mar-
gin between profits and divs. has always
been substantial, and the 12 p.c. seems as
sure as anything 12 p.c. can be. At least
the fact that funds (capital plus reserves)
have to earn only just over 6 p.c. to permit
of 12 p.c. divs. invites optimism. During
the year temporary capital was issued to the
amount of £44,400, on which a premium of
£5604 was collected.

informed operators on the Stock Exchange
during the past year; and thousands who
have not merely bought and sold, but have
sought safe investments, have been able to
get into sound companies at prices that are

however, great danger in risking money in
some of the cos. on the market, inasmuch

The general utility of Pioneer Wood Pipe in
irrigation schemes brings much praise from users.
The proprietor of a big market garden at Wagga
writes: “The wood pipe purchased from you seven
or eight years ago for conveying water has given me
good service, and is as sound as when put down
and appears to be a lifetime job. It is clean and
smooth inside; no incrustation to cause friction.
A leading feature in the wood piping is its quick
and easy connection.” Australian Wood Pipe Co.,

to begin with, was almost wholly a reprint
of the “Wild Cat Column’s” reviews of com-

tity of matter to help people with money to

Woods-Gilbert Bail Bemodelling Co., the
English co. which absorbed the Australian
interests in the same process, had its annual
meetiug in London on October 29, and re-
ported poor progress. The profits which
should have been made weren’t made, and
the business which should have been got
wasn’t got, and that’s about all there is to
say—except, of course, that things are going
to be better in future. Included with the re-
venue is £1286 from Australian royalties.
A small Australian co. was formed to work
under license from the English co., but
trouble has arisen between the two, and “we
have sent full particulars to our attorney in
Melbourne and instructions for him to take
whatever action is necessary to establish this
co.’s rights.” After allowing £l9OO for depre-
ciation there was a profit of £576; the 10
p.c. cum. prefs. take £lOl5, reducing the
p. and 1. balance to £354. The co. has been
paying good money away to hold its patents
in Europe, and has got nothing back; but
an effort is now being made to do something
in France, where an agent has been
appointed ; and there are vague hopes that
something may be done in Italy and Spain
on a royalty basis.
The rather extraordinary variations in the
price of lead during last year don’t suggest
that there are enough stocks in hand to keep
the market fed. The highest average quota-
tion for a month was the £4O 10s. 2d. of
January; the lowest £32 3s. 7d. for May.
The December average hasn’t been fixed yet,
but for November the figure was £36 10s.
lOd. Above £4O p.t. the Broken Hill work-
man’s pay envelope is weighted with a bonus
of 2s. 6d. per day: he got this for December
(’24) and January (one month’s average
fixes the following month’s bonus). Above
£37 he gets Is. 9d.; that came in four
months; in the other six months his bonus
was Is. 6d. In. Broken Hill the metal quota-
tions make almost as interesting reading now
as the bookmakers’ prices.
Mutooroo has added Sand Queen-Gladsome
(W.A.) to its list of refusals. It has turned
down many shows both in the East and West
during the past year or two. Some the
Board considered too dear; on others the
cash deposits were regarded as excessive;
others again were rejected after sampling.
But neither the deposit nor price asked for
the Sand Queen-Gladsome could be considered
unreasonable; and as the sampling was sup-
posed to be satisfactory, Westerners can’t
understand why it was not taken.

Whim Well Copper (W.A.) shut down
some time ago, and has since been idle
pending the raisins: of more capital for de-
velopment and the advent of the Perth Cop-
per Separation Co., with its “simple, cheap
and high-recovery” process. It is a toss-up,
however, whether the capital needed will be
found by either shareholders or outsiders, or
whether the Copper Separation Co. will ever
be able to finance the erection of a plant. In
other words, the outlook is not bright.
* * * *
The newly-formed Wiluna Gold Corpora-
tion (W.A.) is anxious that the proposed rail-
way should go from Leonora and across large
tracts of gold-bearing country which needs
only a lihe to induce London capital to come
in. The co. intends to turn Wiluna into a
model township and build homes for its sur-
face and underground workers, and see to
their comfort and welfare—a thing never
before done in the West. At the start of
Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie and other W.A. min-
ing centres “squatters” were allowed to erect
humpies on leases and encroach on areas
required for mining and machinery purposes,
but the Wiluna Co. proposes to block this.
McCahons Co., which holds an option on
portions of the old Edna May and Deep
Levels mines at Westonia (W.A.), has in-
duced three leading Kalgoorlie mine-man-
agers to take blocks of its shares, and with
their help talks of floating a bigger co. in
London to re-open and work the whole of
the Westonia group. Years ago about a
million sterling was won from this group by
Adelaide cos., and had they sunk their differ-
ences, combined their interests and worked
their holdings to the best advantage they
would have won a lot more. Considerable
known ore reserves were left behind, and
there are almost certain prospects of much
additional pay stuff at deeper levels.
Jim Beckett and A. H. Stewart have found
difficulties in trailing a 10-head battery and
accessories across from Derby (W.A.) to
Tanami (N.T.). The tropical rains have
not improved the track for heavily-laden
motor-trucks, and the job of assembling the
plant will take all the time allowed by the
schedule.

F. Lowe, of the Old Bradlaugh mine, Her-
berton (N.Q.), is said to have purchased
the Great Western mine at Watsonville. The
Great Western, Vulcan and Great Northern
were in days gone by the richest producers
of tin on the Ilerberton field ; they yielded
about 4000, 23,000 and 8000 tons of tin
respectively. The Great Northern is to-day
the best producer, and the lode continues to
look promising.
Old Gympie (Q.) still shows the color.
Scottish Gympie cyanided 2550 tons tailings
for 32140 z. worth £BB3 10s. Southern
Gympie Syndicate got 1240 z. from 109 tons.
No. 4 North Phoenix, where the closure was
applied some months ago because it couldn't
drain the whole field, found enough in the till
to disburse a 6d. div.
* * * #
The rare-metal industry, which during one
period of the war allowed Queensland figures
to surpass those of all other States and
countries in the world, has passed hence. It
sleeps till the next war, or till some other
influence sends the market sky-rocketing.
* * * *
Gold-mining in Queensland declined during
1925, due to decreases chiefly from Mt. Mor-
gan and Gympie. In 1924 the State total
was 95,7030 z. fine, valued at £406,518; for
the year just passed the figures fall short of
oO.OOOoz. fine. The year 1926 opens without
any special hope of a change for the better.
Production must be small at Mt. Morgan
until the new scheme of working is in opera-
tion. Gympie recently sang its requiem over
the last gold-producer of note—No. 4 North
Phoenix. Charters Towers is somnolent. No-
thing has arisen elsewhere to replace these
deposits. The old-time gold-prospector has
almost disappeared, and chances of discoveries
in new fields are lean. Ravenswood has
come on best during the past year, and looks
capable of putting out 5000 to 10,000 on.
during 1926, according to the energy and
direction devoted to the quest. Small figures,
certainly, but better than nothing, and this
from abandoned ground. Mt. Coolon re-
mains the enigma. Exceptionally high
figures were asked last year for purchase of
these properties, and, as anticipated, the
proposals were rejected. If the ore valua-
tions were justified it is surprising that more
cash is not spent in development by the pre-
sent holders. It looks as if the field will not
this year get out of the rut of low produc-
tion which has characterised it up to the
present. The other fields of any interest
are the Oaks and Nonnanby. The former
is reduced to working gougers’ veins, and the
latter has several patchy reefs with occa-
sional high values. Neither look like giving
the industry a rise during 1926.
* * * *
If gold looks rather hopeless in Queens-
land tin-mining is on the bounce, and
silver-lead not very far behind. The two best
tin discoveries of recent months were in the
Great Northern, Ilerberton, and in the Sar-
dine, at Kangaroo Hills. The' former
promises to be a healthy producer right
through 1926. The Sardine may or may not.
Prospects of dredging new ground along the
Severn in the Stantliorpe district may re-
vivify this field, and this year’s work
should prove or disprove the new
Stanliills field, which has been lan-
guishing since given a friendly hand by the
Minister for Mines. Mt. Isa should take
Mt. Morgan’s place as the big mine of the
North. Construction on the railway to the
field should start in a few months, and
the merging of the two principal cos.
has removed difficulties regarding work-
ing operations on the big Black Star lode and
brought appreciably nearer the start of
dividend-producing operations. The gross
value of payable ore. in the ground of the
amalgamated properties to a depth of 300 ft.
is certainly over £20,000,000. And one bore
has proved the main lode to carry payable
values to a depth of 600 ft.
The Arbouin, Stannary Hills, which has
been the big producer of low-grade tin ore
in North Queensland for years past, is in a
precarious state at present. Practically all
development work has ceased. Unless fur-
ther shoots are soon located the mine can
have only one fate. Geologist St. Smith ran
the tape over it lately, and is not without
hope for further payable shoots, but con-
siders the working of the highly faulted sec-
tions below the main tunnel level is too
costly and that the main breccia is of para-
mount importance in further prospecting.
* * * *
The Queen Sally cobalt-mine, Cloncurry
IN.Q.), has struck water level in both
shafts in the vicinity of 60ft. Further sink-
ing is therefore held up until they can handle
the surplus water. The lode looks promis-
ing ; the formation, averaging 3ft. to 4ft., is
carrying the cobalt in lenses and irregular
veins, so the ore is being handpicked. The
two shafts have turned out about 10 tons of
high-grade shipping ore, which may carry 20
to 25 per cent, metallic values, and also
some 60 tons of 6 per cent. Most of the ore
is black oxide and the sulphide is just be-
ginning to show up below water level. It
is not an easy lode to sample, but it should
average 4 p.c. or 5 p.c. metal for a width
of 3ft. right through the shafts, on a rough
estimate, and as the shafts are 40 yards
apart there are distinct possibilities. The
lode is on a dyke contact and will probably
be bulgy, so that a bit of driving will eluci-
date prospects considerably.
# * * *
New White Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
found the shilling call unpaid on 18,375
shares, but a well organised sale got from
Is. to Is. 3d. for them. The plant has been
given a test on one shift, and three shifts
are promised early.
* * * *
Sutherland Lode, Iviandra (N.S.W.), has
got the main shaft down to 115 ft. The lode
underfoot continues stroug, sinking being on
“high values.” This estimate is confirmed
by an assay made in Sydney last week, when
samples from the shaft-bottom gave 13oz. gold
and 51oz. silver. Shareholders will be able
to sustain their interest in operations if
another 50ft. maintains similar characteris-
tics.
Bux Syndicate, of Melbourne, which has
concessions in Dutch Borneo, reports the
failure of A. O. Capell to place his options
(Nos. 2 and 5 concessions). The circular
adds that the representative of a strong party
of London financiers has approached the
syndicate direct for an option over No. 5,
stating that the price asked under Capell’s
option was .excessive. Further information
is that success with Nos. 6 and 7 conces-
sions is anticipated by the option-holder, and
that the co. expects to obtain final titles
—-another co. has been successful recently.
This is what A. O. Capell has to say to
The Bulletin about the Bux circular: —-
The papers we carried were at first well received in
London by the leading brokers. But after they had
been investigated and sent to the Hague for inspec-
tion, no further progress could be made, owing to the
lack of a proper final title and the fact that pros-
pecting rights were 300 miles inland in Dutch West
Borneo on the opposite coast to where payable oil
is found and worked. After spending £5OO of my
own money ( none of the syndicate’s or Boyd’s), and
three months’ continuous work in London, 1 re-
luctantly came to the conclusion that it is a hope-
less task for any Australian or American or even
British co. to try tc obtain a satisfactory oil lease
of any value in Dutch Borneo or even Dutch East
Indies. In my opinion this lease will only be
granted to the Royal Dutch Co., and then only
when the Royal Dutch thinks fit to apply for it,
which will not be within 50 years, if then, as it can
have plenty of blocks in the known oil areas for
prospecting purposes at its own price. Payable oil
has never been found on the west coast of Borneo.
I consulted Dr. Kropveld, the Dutch barrister who is
an authority on East Indian mining laws, and also
had assistance from high officials and from leading
London brokers and bankers. When all other efforts
at flotation failed I offered £2500 of my own money
if the London brokers or oil people would find a
similar amount to get the final title, but so little
did they think of the chance that they refused.
After my London experience I consider it waste of
time and money to try to get a satisfactory final
title for oil in Dutch, Borneo or Dutch East Indies—
or most other foreign territories.
* * * *
The usual delays are reported by the Shot-
over, which intends to exploit one of the
streams near the Kawarau (M.L.). The
delivery of the suction-cutter dredge was
postponed that the contractors might make
improvements, and then the weather took a
hand. Latest anticipation is that the dredge
will be working by mid-January. Accounts
at Sept. 30 showed £15,180 spent on plant
and £2333 still owing. There was a cash
balance of £1426.
* * * *
“Red Pat”: What may prove to be an
important find has been made 11 miles from
Seddonville, West Coast, M.L. It consists
of a lode up to 90ft. wide carrying silver
and gold. Assay results are reported of
about £3 15s. a ton over a length of seven
chains, the only part of the lode yet exposed.
I am engaged four miles away from the find,
and am exposing some promising-looking
stone. It may be the same lode. As water
is obtainable and the whole country is
clothed with timber the outlook is promis-
ing. At the southern end the lode occurs
at 400 ft. above sea-level, and at the northern
end it is at about 1000 ft., the intervening
hills rising to 2200 ft. It can be opened
up in several places simultaneously, the
lode outcropping through the faces of the
hills.

A development is reported in the Dubuna
mine (New Guinea Copper Mines, Ltd.).
General-manager Huntley said in a recent
message: “In cutting an approach to an
open cut 20 feet under the surface about co-
ordinate 140 feet south and 165 feet east,
the cap of an ore body, apparently striking
s.-e. and pitching s.-w., was encountered.
The ore at present exposed is about 10 feet
wide, 25 feet long and 10 feet high. Samples
to date have given an average of 8 p.e.
copper.” Huntley considers this an entirely
new ore body, and while it is too early to
estimate its probable size, it is apparently
widening both in face and underfoot.
* * * *
Mandated Development Co. expresses its
continued confidence that “larger quantities
of oil occur at greater depths.” Annual
stocktaking at October 81 shows subscribed
capital at £25,948, share premiums £9284,
and sundry creditors £220. With £6607 added
this term, prospecting expenditure has
reached £12,719. If they are worth anything
at all “locality maps, reports, samples ot
oil, etc.,” are surely not undervalued at
£17,104; and £1862 lias been spent in con-
nection with Matapau Oil Corp. Cash
£1603 and stores £1639 are bright spots in
the balance-sheet.

“Tatana”: Papua is on the map at last,
discovered by the Tourist Magnates of the
U.S.A.! On December 14 the invaders, in
modern shingles and plus-fours, poured into
Moresby from the 20,000-ton Cunard liner
Carinthia and decorated the landscape from
early morn until midday. The guileless abo-
riginal Papuan was suitably impressed—and

promptly urged his grass skirts, model
canoes and other notions on the unsophisti-
cated travellers at 10 times their usual price.
Dollar bills obscured the scenery for hours;
the fruity voices of rotund, diamonded
matrons from the Middle States mingled
with the shrill tones of trouserless Brown
Brethren; and over all glared a cloudless
sky, blue as azurite and as hot as Tophet.
Ladies and gentlemen in Harold Lloyd spec-
tacles wandered about the grilling streets
bemoaning the absence of ice-cream and sun-
daes ; every motor in the sun-baked island
metropolis was filled with perspiring plea-
sure-seekers. It was a great day. for the
residents, white, brown and otherwise. Out
in the peacock-blue harbor the huge bulk of
the Carinthia loomed large against the jade-
green hills; the waters were creased by the
movements of a fleet of needle-prowed canoes ;
cameras clicked merrily, and the air was
heavy with blistering heat and animated
voices. The natives were not interested in
the huge steamer; she was too big for their
primitive intelligence. What they did en-
joy was the various fat tourists in plus-fours.
Said my old, betelnut-chewing cobber from
Hanuabada: “Why are these large-stomached
old men dressed in those funny trousers?
Is it that they have them on because they
have come here from their own country to
run races on our sand beaches?” Truly
the mind of the Stone-Age man is not yet
advanced very much by contact with the
heirs of all the ages.

“Skipper” : In 1918 I was staying in the
north of Ireland at the house of Sir Patrick
Blank, who extended hospitality to overseas
convalescents. One morning Lady Blank
came into breakfast with an open telegram
in her hand and made the startling announce-
ment that a lady officer would arrive that
afternoon. “Who is she?” I asked, with
visions of a sprightly sister in my mind’s
eye. “She’s a Rose McPherson,” was the
reply, “but I don’t know if she’s a nurse, a
W.A.A.C. or a Wren. You’re going to ’Derry
this afternoon; do look out for her at the
Junction.” The news spread rapidly. “Whin
does the leddy officer arroive, sor?” asked
the police-sergeant in the High-street, and
the stationmaster was just as curious. How-
ever there was no sign of Rose at the Junc-
tion, to the evident disappointment of the
villagers who thronged the station yard
where my host’s motor waited. When 1
emerged alone the rector hurried over. “And
where’s the leddy officer?” he inquired
blankly. Just then a burly Aussie subaltern
came up to us. “Can you direct me to
Blankton Manor?” he asked. “Jump right
in, sor,” said the chauffeur; “but who are
ye?” “I’m Ross McPherson,” he replied;
“didn’t Lady Blank get my wire?”

“Petrie”: Chief Justice Blair (Q.) con-

Verandah of the Pacific Hotel, Southport,
during the Christmas holidays to oblige a
couple of petitioners who had been granted
decrees nisi in Brisbane, but would other-
wise have had to wait until after the long
vacation for the decrees to be made absolute.
The Judge’s associate was also at South-
port, so was in order, and the
mixed foursome were set free to turn the
holidays into another honeymoon if they
felt like it.

“Eggs Are Frizzled”: One night I was in
charge of a section behind Messines. We
were digging a
small communica-
tion trench to com-
pany h.q. when one
of the men came
hurrying up to me.
“Corp.,” he an-
nounced wfith a
shudder, “we’ve dug
up the body of a
woman, and all her
hair is hanging in
the trench.” I fol-
lowed him to have
a look. Sure enough
the long hair was
there, and a mass
of flesh far gone in
decay. I thought
sorrowfully of some
poor woman done
to death at the old
farmhouse through
whose ruins we
were digging, and
ordered somebody
to get an electric
torch so that we
might give the body
decent burial. When
it was brought in-
vestigation d i s-
closed the remains
of an old horse;
the excavators had
struck the hind-
quarters and the
tail hung down
into the trench.
We abandoned the
idea of a funeral and dug right through him.

“W J. Digger”: Jepson -was convalescing
in Malta from a wound received on Gallipoli,
when, without warning, he found himself
whisked up to Italy for a month as the guest
of the beautiful Princess Francesca. Jepson
was a versatile subaltern; he opened a Bed
Cross fair in a manner worthy of a State
Governor, and the way in which he inspected

Sometimes lie would tell her of Australia,
of Adelaide with its glorious hills, and the
waters of the Gulf at sunset, of the marvels
of Melbourne, of all the loveliness of Sydney

tentness that lie found flattering. At last
the real secret of her interest came out. “I

abruptly at last. “Can you keep a secret?”
Jepson intimated that he could. “My maiden
name was Smith,” pursued the Princess,
“and I was born in Surry Hills.”

“Baro”: A Domain orator who has
elbowed his way into Parliament was holding
forth on the subject of self-help. “Look at
me,” he boomed; “17 years ago I was a
laundryman, and when the American Fleet
came to Australia I went on board the flag-
ship to get the Admiral’s laundry. Now I
am a member of Parliament. The American
Fleet was here again the other day, and this
time I was invited on board the flagship by
the Admiral.” He paused dramatically. “To
give him back his laundry?” came an inquir-
ing voice from the outskirts of the crowd.
“Avon”: The big international exhibition
at Dunedin is the fifth of the kind in the
Shivery Isles. They have all been in
the South Island, and three in Dunedin. The
first was held in the southernmost city in
1865 after only 17 years of settlement; the
second in Christchurch in 1880 (it was or-
ganised by Joubert and Twopenny, both well
known in Australia) ; the third in Dunedin
in 1889, organised by a local company; the
fourth in Christchurch in 1907, under the
aegis of Dick Seddon. Christchurch retained
as a memento of that blaze of glory an elabo-
rate electric organ, but it was destroyed by
fire years ago, and as the city has not yet
any place to put an organ—Christchurch
ratepayers have for 40 years been too mean
to erect a Town Hall —the insurance money
is still earning interest. The big show at
Dunedin, though supported and subsidised by
the Government, is, like the three preceding
ventures in the same city, controlled and or-
ganised by a company of citizens.

“Topee”: The ancient Chinese custom of
paying substitutes to take punishment (B.
81/12/’25) must have been introduced into
Australia by Ah Sin many years ago. In
the ’eighties the late Julian Thomas took
various temporary billets in order to obtain
material for his “Vagabond Papers.” One
of these jobs was at Pentridge, and I re-
member him telling me how lie was struck
with the look of despair on the face of a
Chinese prisoner, and even more surprised
to learn that the man was to be discharged
the following day. Gaining the prisoner’s
confidence (Julian was a born interviewer)
he elicited the gloomy story. For a con-
sideration of 7s. 6d. per diem the heathen
had covenanted to plead guilty for a com-
patriot whose crime was assessed as being
worth three years. He had received only
two, which cut off one-tliird of his antici-
pated honorarium, and this compelled him to
relinquish all hope of returning to China
and opening a gambling-house in his native
district. However, he had consoled himself
VERSATILE.
“Do you love me like you loved Betty?”
“Oh, no! I have to handle you quite differ-
ently.”
by contemplating the substantial market-
garden interest still in his power to
acquire. What had broken the poor
devil up was the information, conveyed
to him a week before, that his pros-
pective capital had been reduced by another
sixth; he had received a four months’ re-
mission for good conduct. Sorrowfully the
Chow explained to Julian that nothing was
left to him now but a junior partnership in
a suburban laundry.

LEGS AND THE WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Owing to the indignant outcry of women over
the police order which ordained that all skirts should
come within 12 inches of the ground, the authorities
have revised their decision, and the height allowed
is now 14 inches.” —Athens Cable.
They were daughters true of the warriors whe
All Xerxes’ might defied,
Chips of the blocks that at Marathon
And Salamis wrought in the years agone
Or on Thermopyl* died.
Is the spirit fled that the heroes bred
For the plains of Troy? Not half!
With courage high and - with hearts agiow,
As when there were tyrants to overthrow,
The women fought for the right to show
Two more inches of calf.
Though Hellas’ sons be no more the ones
Their teeth to grimly set
For freedom’s cause or in martial strife,
Though they’ve swapped the sword for the oyster-knife
And the shield for the serviette,
Does the grandeur cease that of old was Greece?
Has the fame waxed dim and dank ?
Is the nation down-and-outed? Nay,
For the maids and matrons still display—
Nor care how the moralists inveigh—
Fourteen inches of shank.
Though their Asian lands be in Turkish hands,
Though the ultimatum curt
Of Mussolini was swallowed straight,
At least they’ll have no cops dictate
On the length of a lady’s skirt.
There’s a sacred right for which they’ll fight
Against any despot grim;
Attic virgin and Doric dame,
They met the ukase with cries of “Shame!”
They marched to combat and carried their claim
To two more inches of limb.

“Nat Lew”: I can endorse the statement
(B. 3/12/’25) that the strike-bug crawls
into queer places. There was a bone of
contention probably unique in the annals
of industrial wrangle on a Hawkes Bay
(M.L.) station a few years ago. The place
was noted for its large flocks of turkeys
(imp. bronzewing) ; these were mustered
periodically for the fats to be run off, the
balance being returned to “pasture.” At a
stop-work meeting the station-hands unani-
mously declared they would not eat turkey
more than once a week. And they carried
their point, too.
* * * *
“Riwaka”: Most Bulletin paragraphs
make the bush the scene of unusual court-
ships ; here is one that happened in the
city. A man from U.S.A. came to Mel-
bourne and started a business in one of the
suburbs, He was a hustler who complained
that this country was slow, and announced
his intention of “jazzing things up.” At
the local telephone exchange lie soon became
noted for the force of his language when
the service was not quick enough to please
him; he was so abusive to one operator that
she reported him to the supervisor. That
official rang up and remonstrated. The
offender expressed regret for losing his
temper, and volunteered to call at the ex-
change and apologise to the young lady. He
hustled in a day or two later, a confident
and self-assertive young man, but it was a
very subdued and embarrassed-looking youth
who presently emerged. He must have
thought a telephone exchange was no place
to make a proper apology, for later he called
at the girl’s home to repeat it. They have
been married some time now.

“Nor’-West”: Some years ago an anti-
Labor candidate for a seat in the W.A. Par-
liament travelled the 1300 miles from Perth
to Marble Bar, and set out by motor-car
for the out-back camps. His was the first
car to arrive in Bamboo Creek, where some
25 dryblowers were chasing the ’weight. A
meeting was arranged outside the store for
the cool of the evening. The oldest inhabi-
tant stood on a case of gelignite and an-

liament. What docs M.L.C. stand for?”

nounced that he thought Mr. Blank was
wasting his time, as the crowd held strong
Labor views, but he had taken a lot of trouble
to get there, and they wrnuld hear what he had
to say, like good sports. Everybody ap-
plauded, and the noise excited the fighting
instincts of the storekeeper’s dog, which
leapt at the animal alongside. In a second
every dog at the meeting—and all Bamboo
had a dog—joined in. There was a hubbub
of yelping and cursing, and the audience
scattered to save it's legs. Presently, after
each dog had singled out its fighting partner,
the owners started to bet. The candidate
and bis policies were forgotten. A hot-
headed couple charged each other with inter-

ference, and were in holts before tlie_ dogs
had knocked off. When Bamboo wearied of
the sport it picked up its hurricane-lamps
and wandered home to its tent, leaving the
forgotten candidate to fix his own stretcher-
bed outside the store. The only sign of
remembrance came from the storekeeper. He
handed out a kerosene-tin. “If the mos-
quitoes are worrying you,” he said, “rub
some o’ this in. It’ll keep ’em off for an
hour or two.”
“Slackhauler”: “Black Tracker’s” drunk
who retrieved a wad of notes
from his condemned swag
after a day or two in the
cells reminds me of a W.A.
navvy who would lash up a
decent cheque with splendid
insouciance and relapse into
an appalling condition of
personal uncleanliness. On
one of these occasions, when
his appearance suggested an
insanitary scarecrow, Mr.
Publican urged on his cus-
tomer that a wash and a
new rigout from over the
way would render him more
fitted to mix with his fellow
men. The navvy gave a
grudging assent, and pre-
sently liis discarded clothes
were in the dustbin. Imagine
Bung’s surprise when his
patron returned two days
later and peremptorily de-
manded the return of a pair
of utterly abominable socks.
Bung directed the inquirer
to the rear of the establish-
ment, where the pick-and-
shovel man eventually re-
covered this portion of his
mad rags. The attraction
was a 10-pound note stowed in the toe of
one of them.

“Merris”: Returning home Ha Canada
after the Armistice we ran into a queer
old fish in the shipping office in Vancouver.
He was decrepit and very dirty; his grey
felt hat was stiff with the grease of years,
and his ancient coat green and shiny, but
when the clerk quoted steerage rates in
answer to his inquiry for a berth to Hono-
lulu, he waxed angry. “No, young feller,”
he wheezed, “I ain’t travellin’ steerage, not
this trip ; first serloon fer me if you please.”
The clerk looked doubtful. “Oh, it’s money
yer want,” lie snarled, “I guess I ken fix
you,” and from a torp pocket he brought
forth a huge roll of hundred-dollar bills. I
struck up an acquaintance with the old chap
on board; he told me of his long, hard life
in the frozen North and asked me to picture
his feelings when the Government had unex-
pectedly bought up his spruce forest for
aeroplane construction and made him a dollar
millionaire. “I’m goin’ down to Honolulu,”
he cried, “to be warm fer the rest of me
days,” and he rubbed his gnarled hands to-
gether in pleasurable anticipation. Smithers,
who shared his cabin, swore that the old
chap’s luggage consisted of one spare shirt
and an extra pair of socks, and that his
daily ablutions consisted in rubbing his
rugged features with the corner of a damp
towel.

“Darnley”: Torres Strait mothers are
loading their infants with novelette names,
though sometimes it is the Government
official who suggests something classy like
Algernon or Marmaduke. One name beat
me recently. “Glass! Glass!” I said to the
mother. “Where you find that one? All
same bottle, eh?” “No!” replied the parent
scornfully; “he no all same bottle—he proper
white-man name; teacher he put that one.”
And she. hauled out a piece of paper on
which had been written —“Clarice.”
* * * *
“Uramao” : Some years ago a painter was
smartening up the face of a stone lion atop
of one of the public buildings in Welling-
ton (M.L.). Seated on a plank, suspended
from the top by two ropes, with another
rope hanging down to the footpath below,
the artist was titivating the whiskers of
Leo when all of a sudden the massive head
hauled off, so to speak, and then made a
dash at him. The scared painter dropped
his paint-pot and brush, slid down the rope
to the footpath and made for a pub. After
a couple of whiskies he recovered sufficiently
to tell how the stone lion had made a bite
at him. He refused to believe that an earth-
quake accounted for the phenomenon till
somebody pointed out a couple of chimneys
that had been thrown down.
“Gouger”: Our mob’s first experience of
aeroplane efficiency was when the sth Light
Horse, camped at Bir-el-Duidar, had been
hurried out on an all-night desert stunt on
the chance of capturing a herd of camels be-
lieved to be not far away. At dawn we were
at the rendezvous, but there were no signs
of our quarry. Suddenly a ’plane came dron-
ing above the sandhills, skimming the tops,
nosing into the still-black valleys, buzzing
over sun-tipped ridges. Then it swooped, and
with a flash of metal came straight at us.
The head of every man and horse was turned
aloft; the message it dropped was: “The
camels are in a valley two miles to the east;
Bedouins are hurrying them off.” The whole
regiment leapt to saddle, and the metal falcon
hummed away. Without the ’plane we
should never have got near those camels, for
the beasts were fresh, unloaded, and in
charge of men born to the desert, whereas
our horses had already gone 36 hours with-
out water. Presently in the hazy valleys
ahead we heard the excited stuttering of a
machine-gun, and when the leading horsemen
ploughed down the last sand-ridges there
was a mob of some hundreds of camels
noisily “ringing,” while viciously circling
just above was the ’plane. Never did sheep-
dog guard his mob more vigilantly pending
the shepherd’s arrival.
“Coppertop”: Oxford bags have their
special uses, too. When a steamer tied up
the other day at an Adelaide wharf it dis-
gorged among other passengers a gent, in
the new garment, with his wife. A piece
of colored silk hanging about his ankles gave
him away, and when Customs officials in-
vestigated they found half a dozen Burmese
shawls wrapped round his legs. Mrs. Oxford
Bags had a similar number around her waist.
But she had sacrificed her figure to get the
goods ashore ; he hadn’t.
* * * *
“Nikko”: “The Jumper” (B. 17/12/’25)
is quite right; cows have to be milked, what-
ever happens. Down on the dairying East
Coast of M.L. a dairy-farmer whose wife
was ostensibly calling on a neighbor was
busy in the milking-shed when a small boy
appeared and said: “Mr. Brown, mother
says to tell you that Mrs. Brown’s gorn
drivin’ down the coast with Sammy Jones”
- —Sammy Jones being a near-by station-
manager whose attentions to Mrs. Brown
had long been resented by her husband. But
Mr. Brown did not become unduly excited.
“Well,” he said, “you tell yer mother thanks,
aii’ as soon as I’ve finished the cows I’ll be
after them !” He was, too, and Mrs. Brown’s
elopement was cut short; her return home,
meekly seated behind her husband on his
white horse, was the chief topic of the couu-
trysido for many a month.

“Pakeha” : The fact that there are doubles
in life as well as in fiction was brought
home to Auckland recently. The corpse of
an elderly man was fished out of the harbor
and identified by as many as 20 people, in-
cluding his own son, as that of John Gal-
lagher, better known as “Hobart Town Jac.k,”
who had acquired much notoriety in the min-
ing days. An inquest was held, the body
was buried Gallagher’s sons dutifully
attending the funeral —and the local news-
papers printed lengthy reminiscences of Gal-
lagher’s variegated past. The next thing
that happened was a protest from an amused
Gallagher, who maintained that he had never
been in better health in his life. The theory
that Gallagher was dead being thus upset,
the police had to find some other hypothesis
FORCE OF HABIT.
“Been on the carpet, I hear, for starting
late! How did it happen ?”
“Well, you sec, I bought a little car from a■
civil servant, and the thing wouldn’t
start till 10.”
to fit the facts, and they found it. They
discovered that the dead man was one Hugh
Murray, and produced several witnesses to
swear that in life they were unable to tell
Murray from Gallagher. A new inquest was
held and a tombstone altered.
A SONG IN SEASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A long farewell to 1925!
Bury him softly under sighs and laughter.
The skies are blue and we are still alive ;
There will be better, fairer years hereafter.
The little moments run with eager breath,
Shouting the glories of the near to-morrow.
Join in the happy race. What’s one year’s death
That we should waste a single word on sorrow ?
And maybe ’twenty-five was glad to go
Down to the quiet place where memory moulders ;
’Twas less than fair that men should load him so
And place so great a weight upon his shoulders.
Earth asks for bread. The statesmen give her bricks,
And men have little appetite for dinner;
But give a cheer for 1926
At least she’s young and looks a likely winner!

The undergrads at the Sydney Uni. are
speculating whether they shall in future
address the Vice-Chancellor as “Sir Mungo
or “Sir William.” “Mungo” is not a name
bandied about like Clarence or Rupert.
Somewhere down the ages before Livingstone
padded the forests of Central Africa there
was a Mungo park avlio did a lifitlc mis-
sionary work there, but, so far as Australia,
is concerned there is but one Mungo, and
lie is the genial little professor who has
taught English literature Avitli the suggestion
of a Glaskie accent at Sydney ’Varsity. The
bright-eyed, pepper-and-salt, squat-figured
and square-headed little man for whom all
have a kindly word and none a harsh one
will shortly complete 40 years of loyal ser-
vice. It is very rarely that a man at the
age of 72 retains so bright a memory of all
the reading in the past—and in Professor
MacCallum’s case it has been prodigious.
“Old Parliament Hand” :
A few of the admirers of the: Great Higinbotham—
pillar of Parliament, champion of responsible gov-
ernment against Downing-stieet officialdom, and Chief
Justice of Tic.—made, a pilgrimage to his grave in
Brighton Cemetery on the 33rd anniversary of his
death, on the last day of the year. Premier William
Shiels’s panegyric on Higinbotham, delivered in the
Assembly just after his death, was one of that orator’s
finest efforts and a precious memory to all of us
who heard it. AVe particularly remember the
passage in which he said: “Take him for all and
all, 1 believe he never had a peer in the public
life of this country in rectitude of aim and puurpose,
in daring courage, in resolute determination to walk
what he deemed to be the path of duty.” And
Melbourne still awaits a monument or even a bust of
him.

A blind student of Groperland’s Univer-

School for the Blind, young Ackland refused

as his life’s work, and matriculated in 1921.
His University expenses were paid by the

his studies. He intends to go in for law.

Chief Justice Murray having returned
from England, Angas Parsons, another
member of the S. Aus. Supreme Court Bench,
is packing his trunks for a visit to his
father’s native land —Scotland. Rumor has
it that before leaving Adelaide Parsons will
resign from the judiciary. Crown-Solicitor
Richards, who has been acting-judge during
Murray’s absence and has made a success of
the job, is mentioned as a probable successor,
but an extra Judge is to be appointed any-
way, and, even if Richards is appointed and
Parsons resigns, there will still be a vacancy
to fill, and it will be difficult to fill it. Of
the “silks” only four are in active practice—
Piper. Cleland, Smith and O’Halloran —and
only from a stern sense of public duty would
any one of them accept the position. Of the
junior members of the Bar the most outstand-
ing is A. J. McLaclilan, but he Avould be loath
to lay down his newly-donned senatorial
toga, not to mention his company director-

E. E. GLELAND,

Charles Eley, general manager of the Sil-

His co. has railed all the ore that lias ever
been carried from the Broken Hill mines
to the S. Aus. terminus at Cockburn; and
it has been the most profitable 30-odd miles
of desert railway in the world—all through
its life it has averaged not far short of 100
p.c. p.a. on its cost. In a district which has
seethed at various times with industrial
trouble, Charles Eley has kept his wheels
running smoothly almost always; he knew
his men and they knew him, and it was no
use anybody telling them. that he was a
tyrant and a bloodsucker. His offsider
Berry follows on as superintendent.
Closed his field notebook for ever, Alfred
Ernest Pratt, surveyor and explorer of
Papua. Pratt did much professional work
in N. S. Wales before going to Papua with
the McKay expedition, which explored the
upper waters of the great Purari River.
Later, as a staff surveyor of the Papua
administration, he pitched his tent in the
most inaccessible parts of the great island,
concluding 16 years’ strenuous service as
Acting-Commissioner for Lands and Acting-
Director of the Agriculture, Mines and Sur-
vey Departments. Side-lines were his
brilliant presidency of the Public Service
Association of Papua and the laying-out of a
rubber plantation in the hills behind Mores-
by. He took part in the Staniforth Smith
expedition, spending months ,in the jungle
living on what he could pick up. A man of
many parts was Pratt, a sound scholar, a
brave explorer and a successful administra-
tor. He won the friendship of every pioneer
in the island.
“Mamba” : Mat Crowe, whose death The
Bulletin lately reported, w’as co-discoverer
with the late Archibald Walker of the Yodda
goldfield on the Upper Mambare River
(Papua.) a quarter of a century ago. Crowe
led the party, Walker (a son of the ex-
Sen ator) being his second in command of
the sturdy Australians who cheerfully risked
their lives for what, after all, was a very
meagre toward. Poor Walker shortly after-
wards entered the Papuan service, and died
within a few months while Resident Magis-
trate at Tamata. Crowe knocked about for
years among the peaks of Central Papua,
and helped to put the goldfields of the Lake-
kamu, Musa and other rivers on the map.
In his latter days he returned to the Yodda
and won a precarious living from the old
workings, but he was always itching to go
across the border into the country where
the Bialolo field has been located. Almost
his last trip into the wilderness was in
search of osmiridium in the broken coun-
try of the Goodenough Bay hinterland, but
failing health forced the old battler to give
up the venture. In the historic rush of ’9B
to the Klondyke, he was one of the first men
to carry his swag over the Chilcoot Pass,
and it was from the glaciers of the North
that he went to delve in the steaming allu-
vium of Papua, where, like so many of his
contemporaries, he found instead of fortune
only hardship and ill-health.
Leo Salmon, who met his death at the
Maroubra (N.S.W.) Speedway, was a much-
travelled man, despite his comparative youth.
He saw Australia first while travelling
through the Commonwealth in the entour-
age of boxer Noah Brusso (otherwise Tommy
Burns), and then paid nine separate visits
to the United States and three to Europe.
He first came in' contact with the petrol-
waggon business as a lad of 16, when he
helped to distribute Lizzies in the Ma State,
and four years ago he was appointed special
Australian representative of General Motors
Corporation’s tractor business. Latterly the
firm of which he was managing director has
been selling Citroeps on the “time-payment-
without-deposit” system. A busy life ended
at 36.
Henry Francis Wigrarn, one of Maori-
land’s new knights, made a lot of money
out of bricks and beer, but is not of the
“self-made man” type. He was educated at
Harrow, and got a financial training in
Throgmorton-street, London, before he went
to Christchurch to bake bricks and make
malt. His little bit in the Great War was
the establishment of an aerodrome that
trained nearly 200 pilots. An attempt to
carry the thing on as a commercial venture
cost him £lO,OOO, after which the Govern-
ment acquired the aerodrome and fleet. Per-
sonally and through the Lyttelton Times,
of which he is chairman, Wigrarn has never
ceased to impress upon M.L. his belief that
aircraft ought to play a very important part
in the defence of the country, and during the
latter part of a 20 years’ sojourn in the
Uppah Chambah, ended by a resignation
through ill-health, he frequently spoke on
the subject.
D. M. Smith, M.A.. one of Lang’s Leg.
Council nominees, is a teacher at the Goul-
buru High School and President, of the local
branch of the A.L.P. But Ills chief claim
to distinction is that lie can say “I was
with Grant.” He took the chair at Donald’s
memorable street-corner meeting in Goulburn
during the recent elections.
F. J. Rae, who gets the job of director
of Melbourne Botanic Gardens, is a B.Sc.,
a B.Ag.Sc. and a B.A. of Melbourne Uni.,
and did his bit in the Big Scrap, first in
the Field Artillery and then as. an aviator.
Like several others now holding important
posts in Vic., he began as a teacher, and
latterly has been principal of Burnley Gar-
dens. E. E. Pescott, who was acting-
director for nine months while the late J.
Cronin was ill, was well in the running.
He had a similar training to Rae (without
the ’Varsity degrees), but he is 53, 11 years
older than Rae.
Hughie Langwell, just re-appointed chair-
ipan of Ma State’s Western Land Board,
once knocked out a crust as a shearer in
the division over which he now presides. He
then set up at Bourke as a barber, and later
on got himself elected as Labor member for
the district. Besides enjoying a legacy from
the late Sam McCaughey, Hughie has had
the luck to draw a first and a second horse
in Tatt.’s.
Sydney has had 14 mayors since they were
first lorded in 1902, and five of them were
knighted. Allen Taylor was in the chair
six and Thomas Hughes four times. Dicky
Richards was also elected four times, but
two of his terms were short-distance sprints.
Both Meagher and David Gilpin bossed the
S.M.C. twice and Paddy Stokes was given
his second chance last month. Eight of the
city’s chief Bumbles have gone in for politics.
Taylor, Hughes and Joyuton Smith are mem-
bers of the doomed N.S.W. Upper House;
Meagher, Lees and Cocks once drew salaries
in the Assembly, auctioneer Stokes is M.L.A.
for Goulburn, and surly Bill Lambert is West
Sydney’s speechless member in the House of
Reps. Clarke, Richards, English, McElhone,
Gilpin and W. P. Fitzgerald (whom McTier-
nan, fellow-Laborite and Attorney-General,
refused to prosecute for selling kerosene
above the fixed price) have kept out of the
murky game.
“R.H.”: That T. M. Burke helped to lose
money for the civil servants of Victoria in
their Co-operative Store (B. 24/12/’25) is
short of being even a half-truth. Burke
stocked the store with the best of every-
thing, and as manager grafted with energy
and thoroughness; failure came because the
enterprise was not adequately backed up
by the civil servants themselves. Even the
persuasive Burke could not instil into enough
railway minds the sense of part-ownership
and the need for the spirit of co-operation.
Incidentally, Burke has another hobby be-
side horses and boosting Australia. It is
helping institutions connected with his
church and contributing to the welfare of
inmates of hospitals, orphanages and child-
ren’s charities generally.
Frederick Westcott Beedham, who has
died in Tasmania, was connected by mar-
riage with the Kipling family. His eldest
daughter, one of the first batch of M.A.’s to
Senator NEEDHAM, of W.A., who is ex-
pected to take “Jupp” Gardiner's place
as Labor's leader in the Senate.
be turned out of the Tas. ’Varsity, married
Tom Dunbabin, a Speck’s early Rhodes
scholar, now of Sydney Sun. A son, Rud-
yard Noel Kipling Beedham, LL.B., carried
off first-class honors in his finals, and is
solicitor to the Public Trustee. The baby
of the family, Bruce, has already a book
of verse to his credit.
Died at Keswick (Eng.) recently, aged
83, Mrs. Reginald Dykes-Marshall, a
grand-daughter of Governor Fitzroy, who
reigned in the Ma State from 1846 to
1855. Fitzroy’s daughter, Mrs. Keith
Stewart, who turned the first sod of the
N. S. Wales railways at Redfern on July
3, ISSO, was mother of Mrs. Dykes-Marshall,
and kept house for his Ex. after the death of
her mother. Lady Mary Fitzroy, who was
killed while driving in the Parramatta
Domain in December, 1847.
A white-headed old gentleman recently
arrived in the North Island (M.L.), and
went poking about in such places as
Gate Pa, Rangiaohia and Orakau. He was
revisiting scenes that he knew 6U years be-
fore, when as a young officer he helped to
impress upon the Maoris that they no longer
owned their country. Nowadays he is
General Clarke, and in the intervening years
he has acquired also a baronetcy and has
occupied such posts as Commander-in-Chief
at the Cape and at Madras and the Gov-
ernorship of Malta. At 86 he felt impelled
to renew his acquaintance with the land in
which the foundations of an exceptionally
successful military career were laid.
Assistant-Warden of Mines A. C. Alex-
ander is the romantic figure of the Adams
River osmiridium diggings (Tas.), where the
recent rush was. In his youth he studied
medicine in Edinburgh, but ran away and
served before the mast in all the Seven Seas.
Tiring of salt water, he tried cow-punching
in Texas and gold-mining on the Klondike.
Then he joined the famous N.-W. Mounted
Police, as a member of which he captured
a half-breed murderer after months of patient
tracking. He then drifted to West Africa,
where he was assistant manager for a mining
co. When the Great War broke out he
joined a Tommy regiment and saw service
in India and other mucky parts of Asia.
Now they call him the sheriff of Adams
River.
J. W. Middlebrook, affectionately known
as “Middy,” recently re-elected Mayor of
Goulburn (N.S.W.) for the third year in suc-
cession, is an old naval man and in his way
a despot. He has a way of emitting seem-
ingly audacious proposals which on examina-
tion are found to be quite sensible and
acceptable, and the quiet old highland city is
being reformed and improved almost with-
out realising it. Thirty years ago in one
of the South American States “Middy” gave
some President or other a hand in a revolu-
tion, was plugged in the leg with a bullet,
and received the thanks of the victor and
nothing else, though a pound a day was pro-
mised. Middlebrook’s proudest achievement
is the completion of the Goulburn War
Memorial, which had been hanging fire for
years when he took hold of the fund and
bullocked the project through. ,
RABBITS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The death is announced of Mr. John R. Collison,
aged 85 years. Mr. Collison, who lived near Maid-
stone, claimed to have been the first person to
introduce rabbits into Australia.” — Cable.
Our pride we hold 'in this and that;
No man so dull but he will proudly
Keep some conceit beneath his hat
To set liis loose tongue talking loudly
Of what he is, or what he’s done,
Or some distinction in his habits.
Small Avonder that we bear of one
AVho claims he gave Australia rabbits!
Far-living from Australian shores,
Oblivious of this country’s curses,
The old man ’twixt his drowsy snores
Pride in his One Great Life-work nurses.
His bragging wearies all his friends,
Yet they, impressed by his old habit,
Carve on. his tombstone when he ends:
“He gave Australia the rabbit.”
AVhy laugh at him? Have we not heard
“I was in Parliament. .. ~” “I voted. ..-
Insane pride dwelling in the word
About a city growing bloated?
How many, foolishly well-meant,
Make boasts of futile deeds their habits?
They start their work with good intent,
But only give Australia rabbits!

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Q. Cliff”: The amputation of the top
joint of a finger as a sign of mourning, practised
by the married women in some parts of New
Guinea, is also common to some of the islands of
the Pacific and other parts of the world. In New
Guinea the mutilation is always self-inflicted, the
finger being placed on a log and severed by a
sharp blow with a stone adze. For some reason best
known to themselves, the women prefer the crude
native-made tool to the trade tomahawk, though
the steel would make a very much neater job of it.
For a child, the mother, as a rule, lops off the first
joint of her finger—generally the index finger. For
a husband—if she escapes being planted alive with
him—she trims off two finger joints. I’ve tried to
get some satisfactory explanation as to the why of
it, but have never been able to drag more out of
them than that it has always been done, because
‘ that proper-feller way show you too much sorry.”
“Wingella”: Some of the N.T. niggers
may poison their spears purposely, but my knowledge
of the niggers leads me to believe that the poison-
ing is merely incidental. Most of the spearheads in
the N.T. are made of red mangrove wood, or else
of iron or of glass. Glass spears splinter in the
wounds, and thus fester for weeks. The iron spears,
never cleaned, hold decomposing fragments of flesh
in their interstices, and red mangrove wood has
poisonous qualities, the slightest scratch being suffi-
cient to cause an agonising ulcer that takes weeks
to heal. There are cases where the merest scratch
has festered painfully. All the blacks whom 1
have ever questioned indignantly deny that they
deliberately poison their spears; and I think we can
believe them. With all his imperfections, the N.T.
nigger is a gentleman, with a /-ode of honor.
* * * *
“Jimsey”: What is Ahe biggest hen family
on record ? Recently , i town leghorn belonging to
a Hawkesbury River viV.S.W.) orchardist was re-
ported missing and her owner came to the conclusion
that she had fallen a victim to some marauding cat.
About four weeks after her disappearance she proudly
returned with a family numbering 29.
* * * »
“Tamoruie”: Here are three fluke hits. A
shot was to be fired as a signal to the rest of our
party in the bush, so
the shooter took aim
at a white object in
a tree on the other
side of a valley about
800 yards wide, and
fired. To his surprise
and the astonishment
of the natives, the
object fell, and later
in the day was found
to be a white cockatoo.
The second was when a
careless shot was fired
into the head of a tree
at 500 yards distance
where jays were rais-
ing a commotion. One
fell to the ground, and
was found to have the
top of its head neatly
cut off. The third
was made by a sergeant
of police in the N.T.
He had jokingly asked
a visitor from the
South whether he
would like a white
cockatoo or a corella
out of the thousands
which were circling
around a small lagoon
on Brunette Downs.
A white cockatoo be-
ing nominated, the
sergeant drew his re-
volver and let fly. A
white cockatoo fell.
Roistering hi s gun
unconcernedly, he ' be-
gan talking of some
other matter. Thus is
reputation made.
From my own observa-
tions on previous oc-
casions, it was almost
as dangerous to be
standing behind the
sergeant as in front
when he was shooting.
“Banyena”: To state, as “Xamilc” does
(B. 3/12/’25), that crows cannot be poisoned with
strychnine is incorrect. I accepted that fallacy for
40 years and paid dearly for it. Las* spring stray
dogs worried my fat lambs. Some were dead and
others, having been badly bitten, we killed. I
injected strychnine into six of the latter whilst their
bodies were warm. Next morning I went round
expecting to find dead dogs, but instead found dozens
of dead crows. At the end of a week I counted
209. Thus another hoary theory was shattered.
“Nitric”: Apropos “Coppertop’s” query
CH. 3/12/’25) why rats, mice, lizards and men took
the ifnll count with chlorine gas whilst a frog with-
stood tit. It was due probably to the fact that the
lungs.! are not the only respiratory organs of the
frog,, since it also obtains a supply of oxygen by
of its epidermal pores. Hence, even though
its l#ngs, which are of exactly the same physiological
structure as our own, may have been affected, it
IN BUSINESS.
PARSON: “ What does your father do for a living?”
GINGER: “lias gotta a laundry.”
PARSON: “ What's the name of it?”
GINGER: “ ’E calls it th’ ole woman.”
cctpld still keep alive by this secondary method of
respiration. The frog to which “Coppertop” gave
a Spoonful of chlorine liquid must have been a
particularly hardy amphibian, as chlorine water is
a mixture »of hydrochloric and hypoclilorous acids
and vguld be a stiff cocktail for any animal. Inci-
dentally, ong of the most curious respiratory systems
is ow ned tjy the bird, which not only ,has lungs
but also possesses a system of large air sacs inside
its body. Also, its bones are exceptionally light,
having specialised air cavities. This, of course, in-
creases the* buoyancy of the bird in both air and
water.
*/* * *
“Boutfagi”: The persistent attempts of
to detect Egyptian influences in every
aspect off Pacific Island social culture gets tiresome.
“Moe” 3/12/’25) is confident now that the
Maori legend of the spectre canoemen with dogs’
heads paints to a connection of some sort with old
Egypt, -which held similar beliefs and told like
legends. But Egypt was not the only civilisation
that made the dog a symbol of the other world. The
Greeks, {for instance, and our ancestors of the Middle
Ages, wljio had dogs carved on their tombs; so also
the Parsfces of to-day cannot achieve Paradise without
final encouragement from a dog. It is only natural
that the most universally known animal on earth
should "be the subject of universal legend; why,
then, specially drag in the Egyptian?
* * *
“Micfcael Earle* (Vancouver, 8.C.) :
Strange ;equipment is being carried by the pygmy-
searching exploration of Dutch New Guinea, led by
Professor Stirling, of Berkeley University, which left
lately fgr Singapore and Batavia in the first in-
stance. They have tear-gas guns and bombs to ward
off savafee attacks, refrigerators to preserve the
motion-picture film, a rubber rowing-boat and no
fewer than 10 cameras. The American papers, boost-
ing the project, have a little gibe of their own at
the Britisher—a chance they rarely miss nowadays.
The Associated Press report has this sentence in it:
“The all-metal airplane is expected to provide speed
and safety for the expedition in the little-known and
savage country, which cost the British explorer Wol-
liston six months of time and 40 men to cut his way
only 40 miles.”
“C. Coral”: An islander walking round
the beach fthe other day thought his fortune made
when he discerned a mass of floating yellowish-white
stuff coming in on the tide. “Ah, I know that one,
he belong-to whale,” said he, and hurried off to
report his .find of ambergris. It turned out to be
a much less! valuable product, a lump of spermacetti,
and the drepm of affluence was blown to the skies.
Amongst reoent flotsam in the same- vicinity was a
bottle containing a .tide report, thrown from the
Ventura abc|ut 100 miles north of Pago-Pago. It
had been in the sea 474 days, and in a straight line
from where it had come the distance was 2875 sea
miles, Apia Observatory received it ultimately.
Emel : Australian abos. believed that
teeth extracted at initiation ceremonies remained
thereafter in sympathetic relation with the boy from
whose jaw they were taken. Some of the Darling
Kiver tribes used to place teeth thus extracted under
the bark of a tree near water. If the teeth fell into
the water, or were grown over by bark, all would
be well, but if they were exposed, and ants ran over
them, the boy would suffer from some mouth disease.
In other N. S. Wales tribes the teeth were given to
an old man first, then passed carefully from headman
to headman, until they came back to the lad’s father
and so to the lad himself. Care was taken during
this time not to expose the boy to danger by placing
his teeth near any magical substance. An abo. once
travelled 250 miles to get from Dr. Howitt some
teeth that had been entrusted to his care after an
initiation. That the fate of cast teeth will affect the
growth of the, new set is believed by South African
natives and by Pacific Islanders, while various traces
of this superstition linger among European peoples.
* * * *
“Carisbrook Junk" : The beating of the
heart after it has been removed from the body (B.
3/12/’2o) is no uncommon phenomenon in sea mam-
mals. At Darwin in 1918 some meatworkers from
Vesty’s succeeded in landing a shark, which was
thereupon dissected to obtain another hook, swallowed
the previous day. The heart was removed and
remained beating on the hot sand, and when the
body, without entrails, was thrown back into the sea,
it swam frantically around on the surface, endeavoring
to dive below. The heart -was still going when I
left a couple of hours later and the body still
thrashing the water. The. same persistence of life
is common in turtles. We, as we believed, killed
one recently, hamstringing it and leaving it over-
night. Next morning when we went to cut off a
steak it was still alive, and the heart continued to
beat after it had been cut out.
* * * *
“AdeL.”: There is a rare and very shy
bird sometimes seen in eucalypt forests back from
the North Australian coast, and without doubt a
member of the parrot family, which I cannot trace
in any of the bird lists. ‘lts plumage is vivid green,
except a red patch under the abdomen; in length
it is about 12in., and it feeds on flowering eucalypts.
There is also a handsome little fellow seen only
during the winter months in the Northern scrubs,
evidently one of the smaller wrens. It is of a
lustrous jet black with a small, round, scarlet
patch on the-back, and measures tin. from tip of the
tail to tip of the bill. Does the Council know
anything of these two?
* * * *
“Petrie”: “Pearl King” James Clark can
remember when pearls were plentiful in Moreton
Kay (Q-) ", they were found in the shells known as
“quampi.” He struck one rich bed near Dunwich
which yielded a pearl for every shell opened. They
were small and not of much value, but were the
genuine thing. Trying the same place years later,
he found the bed had been ruined by fish. On one
occasion, walking with a friend along the shore of
Moreton Bay, Clark kicked up a quampi shell.
“Pick it up and open it,” he said to his friend.
“Oh, what’s the use?” was the reply. “I’ve opened
hundreds and have never found anything yet.” “You
never know your luck,” said Clark. His friend
opened the shell and found in it a pearl worth £lO.

“YOU CAN’T GO WRONG.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Within the decorous bounds of verse
I’d like to lay my special curse
On folk whose willing, careless lips
Exude advice, directions, tips,
And end with the instruction strong:
‘‘Do this (or that) ; you can’t go wrong.”
All through my life—at every stage—
I’ve had their help or patronage,
With pats upon my infant head
And talk of where my duty led.
Said each unsought, well-meaning pest:
“Take my advice” —you know the rest.
In those bad haunts where bookies lurk,
The racecourse tout gets in his work:
“Mean to back Windbag? Oh, absurd!
Sluggard’s the horse, I’ve had the word.
He’ll make the pace a real ding-dong.
Put your shirt on; you can’t go wrong.”
Another says: “What!—Cov’ment stocks?
The flaming country’s on the rocks!
Cut out that patriotic dope;
Buy all you can of Blasted Hope.
I’ll call and bring the scrip along.
Give me your cheque; you can’t go wrong.”
But most of all I’d like to slay
The coot who helps one on his way.
With confidence his voice will ring,
Forgetting the essential thing.
Says he: “Tarook’s where I belong.
Keep to this track ; you can’t go wrong.
“You cross the creek a bit aslew,
Then Thomson’s boundary gate’s in view’.
His fence runs somewhere to the right.
You’ll strike Tarook 'bout dark to-night.”
Then, with his final “Well, so long!”:
“You’re headed light. Y"ou can’t go wrong.”
ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE HIM—TO-MORROW.
“I suppose your job of rent-collector makes you rather unpopular
around these parts.”
“Oh no—they nearly all ask me to call again.”
A half-mile further on I strike
Four branch roads, every one alike.
No signs or other sort of clues,
No soul in sight. At chance I choose
And, two hours later, ask once more
A swaggie rich in bush-road lore.
“Tarook?” says he. “Tarook? Why, mate,
This road leads up to Bogan Gate.
You’re twelve mile off your proper track.
There’s only one thing—go straight back
The way you came, it may seem long—
Then keep straight on; you can’t go wrong.”
I dream that mid the shining band
At Peter’s right some day I’ll stand,
When one who put me wrong applies
And Pete will say; “Clear! Dash your eyes!
ou’re off the track, you’ve no right here;
Your road’s downhill, the way is clear.
Just keep your back on harp and song
And follow’ the fall. You can't go wrong.”

ROOFING.
THE PARAFFINE COMPANIES INC., D. S. EVANS, Australasian Manager, CIIALLIS HOUSE, SYDNEY,
“Tik”: Tell “D. Ennis” (B. 10/12/’25)
r.hat I have built more stacks than he could
down in a year or more, and they have been water-
proof, too. It is easy. Build your stack high in
the middle, from the floor up, with the butts *f
the sheaves on the outside, all with a downward
slant. When you come to the roof of the stack,
build with a good pitch, and put sheaves on each
side of an imaginary ridge-pole, butt to butt, then
finish off by interlacing the straw in the butts as
much as possible and jambing them close together.
Finally, comb down each side of your roof with the
pitchfork to get the straw running downhill. T
guarantee that if >ou do this you will have a
waterproof stack that will be good and sweet as
long as the rats and mice are kept out of it.
“Rick”: The method to follow in making hay-
stacks waterproof is comparatively simple. The stack
should not be more than five yards in width, but
its length doesn’t matter.’ In building the body
the middle should be kept full. This will cause the
stack to settle well, and when the eave course of
sheaves is reached, the outside ones will have -a
dip outwards so as to divert the rain. With regard
to topping—the main point —the middle of the stack
having been made full and rounding down to the
eaves, the stacker should commence to stack from
the middle outwards, laying a double row of sheaves
STILL DOUBTFUL.
THE DOCTOR (reporting death of wife): “Of course
she's dead—her heart stopped 10 minutes ago."
THE WIDOWER: “ Yairs. But wot erbout her tongue?
Tell me THAT'S stopped and I’ll believe yer.”
lengthwise up the middle, and then working round
the stack backwards, laying the sheaves head up on
the middle ones, and continuing this till the outside
course is reached. The next course should be put
on in the same way, drawing in the outside sheaves
six or eight inches, and so on until the ridge is
reached, it being finished in the usual way. Care
must be taken not to leave holes in the roof, and
it is advisable to use clean-butted sheaves, as water
does not run freely off those which contain a lot
of clover, watergrass or tares. A final touch may be
given by going over the roof with a garden rake,
which will straighten the straws and remove grass,
that might otherwise act as a sponge. Built care-
fully on these lines, a stack can’t get wet.
“Tom Pepper”: A couple of drovers were
bringing a small mob of fat bullocks to Cue (W.A.),
and when within a few miles of the town one of
the men rode in and got a supply of delicacies —
the food supply on the journey had been both rough
and limited. At the evening meal they threw a
travel-stained lump of salt junk and a granitic piece
of damper to Billy their blackboy, ar.d, knocking
off the head of a bottle of lager, proceeded to
enjoy a feast of bakers’ bread, fresh butter and a
tin of pineapple. Presently one of them noticed
that Billy, wearing an aggrieved look, was no’t eating.
“What’s wrong, Billy he asked. “You not bin
hungry? You bin mendik [sick]?” “Mine not bin
hungry longa damper and dry beef,” replied Billy.
“But, by cripes, mine bin plenty hungry longa
bread and butter and bineapple.” Billy got his
share.

“Parama”: The island chef is an expert

lowered into a hole in the earth some three to four
feet deep, the bottom of which has been paved with
red-hot stones. These stones are lightly covered
With sand, which in turn is covered with fresh
banana-leaves, on whi eh the pig is placed. More
banana-leaves are wrapped round it, sand lightly
spread over them, and the whole covered with more
red-hot stones. Then the hole is filled in with
earth or sand, and left for a couple of hours. Served
whole and piping-hot at the feast, as the islanders
serve it, the dish is worth going far to sample. The
recipe, it is said, originally came from Hawaii.

“Topee” : Native arithmetic in New Guinea
is rudimentary (B. 3/12/’25). During the Occupa-
tion I saw an ancient chief grapple with a problem
that took him nearly an afternoon to solve. The
loc'al mission, being short of food for its native
labor, bought from him three bags of kau-kau, a
species of sweet potato, at 3s. a bag. As only 6s. was
returned in payment, the old gentleman felt there
was something wrong, and started to find out. what
it was. Squatting on the ground, he put down three
pebbles to represent the bags of potatoes and dealt
out one and then another shilling to each; there
was no third dividend. Grunting, he prepared a
betel-nut and tried another method. This time he
placed three twigs against each pebble and then a
coin against each twig. The third pebble being then
barren of cash, he knew that he had solved his
problem, but, in order to avoid error, after a short
recess he substituted cocoanuts for the pebbles and
trochus-shells for the twigs. Finding the same
result, he sent liis tul-tul to the mission for the
balance.
“Sarcophilus”: Re place names (P>.
10/12/’25). Tasmania has its Nowhere Else. There
is a signboard on the Avoca-Fingal-road: “To No-
where Else.” But the Speck could always be original
in the matter of names; it has a Brighton without
a beach —four miles inland.
* * # *
“Canar”: Amongst tlie natives of north-
eastern New Guinea and the neighboring islands there
seems to prevail a sort of color-
blindness, characterised by com-
plete inability to distinguish one
primary color from another. When
shown three pieces of paper, one
red, another green and the third
blue, and asked what tint they
were, several “ bush ” natives
picked out the green one easily
enough, but declared that the
others were “no color,” by which,
probably, they meant that they
had not set up any “color stimu-
lus” in their minds, and that
the sheets appeared to be simply
colorless or of some neutral hue.
Similarly, when shown the gaudy
cover of an American magazine,
some natives asserted that it
looked all one color; yet, when
the same cover was exhibited to
a number of police boys from
elsewhere who had been more or
less in touch with civilisation for
years, it provoked the customary
childish gasps of admiration.
Perhaps the explanation is that
ability to distinguish between
different colors is not possessed
by the most primitive types of
man, but is capable of being de-
veloped in them. This would seem
to be borne out by the fact that
in many native dialects there are
no words at all for the colors; in
others there are very few.
“X2X” : The bush has made a good many
powerful beverages, but the most powerful of the lot
was potato spirit. The moonlighter cut up the spuds,
skins and all, into small pieces and steamed them
in order to soften them. Then water and yeast were
added; the mass was allowed to ferment, and the
resultant foul-smelling liquor put through the still.
The spirit obtained was largely amyl alcohol, which
is reckoned to have a kick several times as strong
as ordinary ethyl alcohol, the basis of whisky, gin
and brandy; which probably explains why d.t.’s
were so frequent in the days when potato-whisky was
a popular tipple. It would require very little
amyl alcohol to put a man in possession of an
enthrallingly interesting private zoo. Sometimes,
when a still was not obtainable, the “mash,” after
fermentation, was concentrated by gently warming
and allowing the fumes which rose from it to con-
dense in a blanket covering the vessel. The blanket
was periodically wrung out, and the liquor thus
procured was strong enough to burn the hide off a
cow.

“L.S.”: The other day in a sideshow at
Alurwillumbah (N.S.W.) an Australian lassie per-
forming in a calico enclosure and surrounded by
snakes, death-adders and lizards, was pluckily hand-
ling the creatures. Picking up a big lump of a
goanna, she said: “This is an iguana.” Now, our
court of appeal, the Sydney Museum, says the goanna
is not an iguana. Also it declares that our ’possum
THE GOOD OLD AUSTRALIAN SPIRIT—LENDING A HAND.
is not an opossum and our triantelope not a taran-
tula ; further, that peewees and tea-trees are cor-
rectly so spelt. There, are no peewits or ti-
trees in N. S. Wales. The N.S.W. Survey Depart-
ment also directs that “tea-tree” should be so written
on the departmental plans, and not “ti-tree.” The
Mr.seum authorities further say that goanna, possum,
triantelope, peewee and tea-tree are good Australian
names. Teachers, please copy.
“Centurion”: The queerest little immi-
grant Australia has seen for many a long day arrived
recently at Melbourne Zoo, when Mr. and Mrs. Hippo
became the parents of a ridiculous figurine of them-
selves. The little chap was. horn in the pond
provided for his parents, and was swimming like a
duck before he was two minutes old. It was a
couple of days before he tried to walk. Mother
Fes on the bottom of the pond, and sonny dives for
his dinner. Occasionally he conies up for a breath
and then ducks under again for a second course.
*.* * *
“Pakehalm”: Auckland (M.L.) bathers
are thinking hard these days. Shark tragedies have
recently occurred in widely-separated places which
had hitherto not known them. One was at Oottesloe,
near Fremantle, where a man was the victim; two
years ago a schoolboy 'perished in the Swan River,
the first human being to be taken by a shark in the
memory of white Westralia. Only a few months before
a white girl was taken at Singapore, and the good re-
cord of the open bathing-place of the Singapore Swim-
ming Club was suddenly shattered. The big shark is
a mighty ranger, and it may be that these two
marauders acquired their taste for human flesh at
Manly, Bondi or Coogee. Anyhow, Auckland is feel-
ing justifiably tremulous about a horde of large
sharks which have put in an appearance in the
spacious harbor.
* * * *
“Slam”: One has only to watch the affec-
tionate habits of the Queensland dugong to make a
good guess at the origin of the old mermaid stories.
The female sits up in shallow water, at a deceptive
distance, and holds the young one to her breast with
a flipper, in a most human-like way, in order to
suckle it. These curious air-breathing sea animals
used to be seen feeding in great herds upon the
marine vegetation of the mud flats a generation ago,
but the steak is good eating, and as an Bft. dugong
will yield about two gallons of valuable oil, they
have long been hunted and are now almost extermi-
nated. The nearly hairless hides are often en-
crusted with barnacles, which the dugongs try to
get rid of by rubbing themselves roughly against
oyster-covered rocks, often, in the process, cutting
themselves severely.
“Black Tracker” : In almost every instance
where sensational attacks are recorded by animal or
bird either maternal instinct or hunger is responsible.
Oases of the former are common, but the latter are
somewhat rare. A case reported from Broken Hill,
where a hungry eaglehawk was struggling to carry
off a well-grown lamb, is an example of the latter.
The boundary-rider rode at the bird, and attacked it
with his stockwhip. The bird immediately released
its hold and attacked the man. In making a savage
dive it struck the horse’s head with its wing. This
so scared the animal that it became unmanageable,
and the lamb had to be left to its fate. Another case
witnessed was even more remarkable. A hungry-
looking native cat with several poorly nourished kit-
tens at her heels sprang- on to the back of a well-
grown fox, and with teeth and claws hung on until
Reynard’s throat -was torn to pieces, the kittens lap-
ping up the warm blood before the fight was over. A
’roo-shooter once had a unique experience. A well-
grown animal was shot when coming straight at him.
As it fell a big spotted cat that had been hanging to
its throat disputed possession. The second barrel
settled matters.
“Gouger”; The actors were two wedge-tailed eagles
and a half-grown wallaby. The stage was a rocky
knoll. The chief villain swooped, and the wallaby
hopping unconcernedly from rock to rock, abruptly
swerved and dashed down the slope. The bird vol-
planed, and her body swished above the wallaby’s
head. TJje animal side-stepped and dashed off. He
was met by buffeting wings, and, knocked over the
rocks, dashed under a shelf of granite. The eagle
landed beside the shelf, and her beak jabbed
underneath it. She could not reach the animal
until her lord bounced under the further side of
the rock and reached out savagely. The wallaby
then broke cover, and both birds rose above him,
thumping down in turns. The wallaby twisted, and
made frantic leaps that became more and more
erratic. Finally he was knocked down on the
grass in a heap. I saw the shrinking of his body
as the talons bit into the flesh. The pirate of the
air rose with his booty as easily as a man pulls a
fish from the sea.
* * * *
“H.,T.K.”: A life-long friendship between
two settlers near Bungendore (N.S.W.) has terminated
through the anxiety" of one of the two to rid his
property of the rabbit pest. Part of his land is on
a stony rise, and having lost his ferrets, owing to
the impossibility of digging them out, he had re-
course to a device that had unneighborly results.
Catching three vigorous bucks, he coated them with
luminous paint, and released them in a large
warren near his neighbor’s boundary. After scaring
out the inmates, the spectral invaders appear to
have visited other burrows, the result being that in
a few days hardly a cotton-tail was visible on the
land. But the neighbor was puzzled by the badly
infested state of his paddocks. Then it all leaked
out and relations are now strained.
* * * *
“G.S.M.”: “Sigs” points out (B.
17/12/’25) that the judging of hacks at shows is
wrong. No man can judge a hack from the ground,
and why is it that ambling, the most comfortable pace
for rider and horse over long distances, is not judged
as a legitimate pace? Points are now subtracted
from any horse with this habit.
RETIRED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He hears the people passing down the street,
Low voices speaking softly through the gloom.
The scent of blowing roses, red and sweet,
Breathes through the quiet room.
In city lights agleam against the skies
He finds no beauty, nor in lofty spire,
Nor ruddy roof. He sees with fading eyes
The land of his desire—
Wide plains and, dark along the river’s brim,'
The tall old timber; spaces bare and brown;
Blue distances where freedom calls to him
To leave the crowded town.
Of wealth aweary, in his silken bed
He lies unrested. Gladly once again
He’d ride, the open sky above his head,
Across the parching plain,
One with the sun-scorched country, blurred with haze,
One with the rainy dawn, the sunset bright,
One with the winding golden waterways,
One with the night.
Soft hands caress; hushed voices fill his ears.
Without farewell his heedless spirit flies
From city comfort. Joyously he hears
The call of wind and skies.
From all that bound and stifled, far and fast
To that dear lonely place where he would be,
The bushman, stripped of riches, ease, at last
Goes glad and free.
VICTORIA.

STOCKINGS
The flutter of last w 7 eek w 7 as the arrival in
Port Jackson of the Carinthia; of the fleet
that issues yearly from the States on w 7 orld
tours she is the first to take in Australia.
She didn’t exactly bring the Golden Fleece
to our door, but she carried ten millionaires,
and the luxury suites on board looked like it.
The plum-pudding lethargy w 7 as dispelled
by the afternoon gathering on the floating-
hotel. The passengers were out scouring the
harbor and the beaches in comfortable horn-
rimmed glasses and beauteous veils and
rather uncomfortable (the day w 7 as a
blazer) fur-collared travelling-coats (one
girl wore riding-kit, topped by an Indian
blanket), so the visitors made a Sherlock-
Holmes inspection from top to stern, even
moodily gazing into the china-cabinets where,
to prevent argument, the specimens were
labelled Wedgwood, Ming or Doulton. The
party was for the benefit of the Sydney
Hospital, and that pillar of the Macquarie-
street pile, Mrs. Norman Murray, in black
georgettes, a pearl choker and a picturesque
black hat, had the affair under her wing.
Shipping magnates came by the dozen,
among them the Commonwealth line Kneen
couple and Cunard-manager Coggins and his
wife. Came also Knight Vicars and his lady,
she wearing an ostrich outfit on her black
hat; the MacCormiek dame and daughter
Morna; the U.S.A. Consular Lawtons; Mrs.
Denyer (Mione Stewart who was), flying
grey pleated georgettes; Mrs. Jenner, a bird
of paradise perched on her hat; and Captain
Hollis w 7 ith his wife and Mrs. Floyd, the
latter combining a pearl necklace and an
Irish smile w 7 ith devastating effect. Rose-
pink georgettes and a small w 7 hite hat finely
braided in a Chinese design riveted the eye
at the passing of surgeon Dan Kelly’s slim
wife. And mention must be made of the
band which, although on a dry ship, changed
gaily from bar to bar through an afternoon
of syncopation.
_ Among the Carinthia’s passengers is a
titled lady w 7 ith variegated national connec-
tions w 7 lio talks every Sunday evening to
her deceased husband. The Baroness Kath-
erine Evans von Ivlenner came of Welsh
parentage, and after a career as a profes-
sional singer under the name of Evani she
married _ the Baron, presumably of German
nationality, though he occupied a position
in the Italian diplomatic service. She is a
confirmed believer in the possibility of com-
municating w 7 itli the dead, and has written
a book, “The Greater Revelation,” on the
subject. Like Conan Doyle she-is convinced
that fairies can be photographed, though she
admits that much of Doyle’s psychic evidence
is puerile.
Though the Carinthia was only a day and
a half in Sydney, Hilda James, the English
swimming girl wdio governs the pool-room of
the big liner, plucked tw 7 o parties. One w r as
a dinner followed by a dance given in her
honor by the F. C. Lanes of Cremorne—lie
w r as Australia’s first Olympic champion. The
other was a reception at the Australia given
by N. S. Wales amateur mermaids. This
w 7 as held in the Winter Garden, and Mrs.
Chambers, secretary of the Swimming Asso-
ciation, and Mary Durack did the honors,
and the guest was half-smothered in roses.
What every Scotsman knows is that a
Scot, be he of the Highlands or the Low-
lands, is a better make of man than any
other country can produce. So there were
no bickerings between the clans on New
Year’s Day when they rallied at the Show
Ground to keep such national sports as wear-
ing the kilt, skirling the pipes and tossing
the caber green in the minds of new genera-
tions. It was a day, as Mr. Hughes might
say, of fitful blazes, more fit for sombreros
than glengarries. But did your real heather-
mixture lass mind that? Not a bit! Tartan-
wrapped, plaidie-draped and embellished with
half a ton or so of precious medals, sonsy
little girls danced' the Highland fling
meticulously. Small kilted and cairngormed
laddies by the hundred felt the blood of long-
dead-and-gone Camerons and Campbells and
Douglases pulse through their veins as the
skirl of the pipes cut through the sun-
drenched air. Fathers reflecting the spirit
of Roderick Dhu beamed in beatific fashion
on all other fathers who sported the same
thistle, button or tartan, and soft-cheeked
young women just arrived from Glasgow,
from Inverness, from Cromarty and even
from far-flung Skye glowed rosily at the
sight of the sprays of real white heather.
Two days’ racing cheered up Randwick
over the New 7 Y"ear; although the first day
brought out coats by the dozen they were
of satin and marocain and gaily embroidered
materials. Mrs. Pitt Rivers made rather a
Lit with her threequarter-length coat of
nut-brown satin worn over nut-brown maro-
cains. She was furthermore noteworthy by
reason of a green hat. Mrs. Malcolm Mac-
kellar’s coat was sable of hue, but ran to
gold headlines about the collar and cuffs. In
contrast to these tw r o tall Hebes, tiny Rita
Buckland displayed a coat of ivory lace.
Barbara Knox wore a penny-browm wrap-
oyer ; and, briefly, every second woman was
similarly guarded against the weather. Eliza-
beth Macarthur Onslow 7 was a colorful ex-
ception, in almond-greens • and a fiower-
wreathed hat; and a small pull-on of bottle-
green was Kathleen Osborne’s head-covering.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh cheered one day
W’ith her brown and red checks; and Mrs.
A. C. Godhard’s sapphire georgettes w 7 ere
closely tucked, while a wide black hat added
the brigand touch that is desired by many
in their millinery but is only obtainable by
the few 7 . To Friday’s meeting came two
brides : Mrs. Lawson, who w 7 as Evelyn Brun-
ten ; and Mrs. H. Douglas, who was Cynthia
Blair —the latter in w 7 hite, her coat collared
deeply in fur. Every head almost wore a
Bangkok hat; and Clara Butt brought her
pianist, w 7 ho is now 7 a princess by marriage.
On New 7 Year’s Eve, by the time the eleventh
hundred had slipped past the story of Cinder-
ella and her glass slipper at the entrance and
dashed down the stairs, the Ambassadors
uttered the groan of repletion, and refused to
swallow 7 another one. Eleven hundred sets of
teeth, home-grow 7 n and shop-made, engaged
in a relentless attack on foods rich and
varied which seven chefs and 150 waiters
fed to them with the cunning of a veteran
serial-writer. Every scrap of the Palm
Court and the balconies was used as dancing
space, and at the right hour, from a gav
litter of roses borne by the balled, little New
Year greeted the crow 7 d with a rosy smile
and a golden arrow. Betty Furlong, a win-
some three years of babyhood, made her first
public appearance as the understudy for
1926, and in the struggle to get a look at
her one young woman in the background
mounted a table. “Come down!” urged her
friend. “What will people think of you?”
“Think I’m jolly lucky at 12 o’clock to be
able to stand at all, let alone mount a table,”
replied the intrepid damsel.
The Wentworth, too, was packed from
balcony to Palm Court, and a pretty idea
was hatched just before midnight—-a flight
of butterflies fluttered dow 7 n impartially on
the bald and the shingled, the waved and
the lank. A figure symbolising Dawn emerg-
ing triumphant from the shadow-s of night
was the special New 7 Year pageant at the
Church Hill inn, whose souvenir programmes
also were a work of art.
This is a May Moore picture of actress
Therese Desmond, whose real name is Molly
Long. This
clever Austra-
1i a n started
out to be a
concert singer,
an d studied
with William
Asprey. After
a successful
debut on the
platform, Molly
became a favo-
rite broad-
caster from
Farmer’s. But
to Dunca n
Macdougall be-
longs the credit
of discovering
in her a fine
talent for the
dra m a. He
trained h e r
steadily for
12 months, and after a preliminary
warming up as a super, in “The Adding-
Machine” she burst on Playbox audiences
as Therese ILighrange (a follower of the
oldest profession in the w T orld) in Thomas’s
“Morality.” After a few more appearances
with the Playbox, she played Angelica, a
courtesan, in Helen Simpson’s “Man of His
Time,” and across that Sahara of inaction
she flashed a vivid and exotic plumage. Since
August she has been with the Brandon
Cremer stock company, formerly of Tas-
mania and now playing the country towms
of N. S. Wales. The lady of the picture is
tall, slight and Titian-locked, and in some
make-up not unlike Bernhardt.
J. C. Bendrodt has taken over the Glaci-
arium and turned it into an effective ball-
room. Columns of ruby lights at the en-
trance spray the ingoer, and, within, a good
band, Chinese lanterns and a crescendo of
color effects carry on the good work. Over
200 greeted the New Year from the George-
street jazz stronghold.
This Letter struck a new idea in Christmas
parties last v 7 eek. It was styled an Egyp-
tian evening; and the star event was a
mummy-race. Entrants, men and women
alike, were swathed in Tut-like cerements,
and the race was “shuffled” the length of
a lantern-lit verandah, while a phonograph
inside droned and whined through a pro-
gramme of “Eastern” music. There were
fines for talking, coughing, sneezing and even
squeaking. In the finals only two remained
in the ghostly struggle.
Recently passed his 83rd milestone, but
not looking like it, as this picture testifies,
Q. L. de Loitte
is Sydney’s
g.o.m. of row-
ing. Born on
Balmain,
w’here he still
lives, on De-
cember 3,1843,
he opened his
career as an
oarsman in
1859 by win-
ning the double-
sculls race for
youths under
17 at the Bal-
main regatta.
His comrade
in victory that
great day was
the late
Charlie Mans-
field. For over
half a century
Mr. de Loitte
was with the C.S.R. Co., and when he first
found a nail for his cap behind its door
there were only one clerk and two boys on
its staff. This year his family will com-
plete a century on Australian soil, his father
having arrived here in 1826. In addition
to aquatic sport the veteran has one other
diversion—a periodical jaunt abroad in quest
of rare orchids.
St. James’s experienced a crowded hour
last week when Jessie Dale, of Strathfield,
changed into Mrs. I). G. Mclntyre, of
Pymble, Padre S. M. Jdhnstofle. being respon-
sible for the metamorphosis. Ivory satin
gleaming with silver embroideries en-
wrapped the bride, and a train of
silver tissue under a vapory cloud of
ninon was sleuthed by Jessie Lyell,
who ’maided in softest blues over which
gold lace glimmered; her hat was a thistle-
down affair of pink, mauve and blue tulle,
and she carried a cuddlesome posy of del-
phiniums and pink roses. The ’groom was
supported by his chum Bill Fleming. Bride’s
mother and father staged an outsize recep-
tion at Dungowan, and the honeymoon rises
over Tasmania.
How many hundreds of interested little
girls and boys with their equally interested
mothers saw Farmer’s Christmas play, “When
Dreams Come True”? Fay Hornby, the lady
who made the wheels go round in that
charming production, packed her vanity-case
in a hurry after the last curtain and rushed
off to Melbourne and matrimony. She is
now Mrs. F. W. Evans ; her husband hails
from the North Island of Maoriland.
The round-faced pianist with Clara Butt
comes back to Sydney a married woman and
a princess. Though still figuring on the bill
as Marie Antoinette Aussenac, she is now 7
the v 7 ife of Prince de Broglie. The Prince,
whose business interests are entwined with
electric clocks, is mainly interesting because
he believes he has discovered q mire for t.b.,
and is anxious to tell about it. The cure has
to do with iodine and alcohol compresses.
A week-end wedding, presided over by
Padre O’Connor at St. Mary’s, w 7 as that of
Milbali Shorthand, of Turramurra, to Stanis-
laus Riley, of Newcastle. A froth of white
satin and georgette enfolded the bride, w 7 ho
was squired by father and ’maided by Wini-
fred Dodds in a blue and cherry georgette
outfit. Ewart Stone best-manned.
St. Canice’s, at Darlinghurst, w r as roused
from its morning quiet on Monday by the
flutter of georgettes and orange buds that
marked the passing of Sheila O’Gorman
Hughes. The young man who was waiting,
not meekly, but jubilant, for Monsignor
O’Gorman to slip on the matrimonial
noose was Paymaster-Lieutenant-Commander
Hehir. of the Flinders Naval Depot, Victoria.
White georgettes and silver Limerick lace
and white roses were assembled beauties in
the bride’s attire; three maids in mauve geor-
gette frocks and crinoline hats added pomp
and circumstance; and the ’groom’s naval kit
added to the glitter. The wedding lunch w r as
served at Quiraing, the Woollahra home of
the bride’s father, Dr. O’Gorman Hughes.
As this Letter is struggling into a new
print outfit Mona Houston, of Roslyn Gar-
dens, is being arrayed in slinky white satins
and georgette heavy w 7 ith crystal embroideries
for her date at St. Mark’s, Darling Point,
with Lieutenant T. Taylor, now of H.M.S.
Herald, formerly of Bridlington, Yorkshire.
'Two more ring entries are registered —by
Joan Bullmore and Nell Joske. Joan,
daughter of the medical Bullmores of Ocean-
street, is engaged to Douglas Henty, and
Nell has promised to link up in March with
Howard Ellis, of Fiji and Maoriland.
Singing-girl Shelagh Nunn Pattrick, who
went to London some time ago to study,
has become engaged in England to Eric
Alexander Johnstone, of Scotland. Besides
matrimony, Shelagh is looking forward to
grand opera.
Also in Sydney, Mabel F'orrest, Australia's
best-known woman verse-writer. Mrs. For-
rest has just had the joy of seeing her novel,
“The Moth of Moonbi,” on the movies; she
has brought down from Brisbane her daugh-
ter and a pair of beautiful amber ear-rings
that would make Elinor Glyn’s eyes hang
out. When last seen she was opening a regu-
lar mountain of New Year greetings—one
of them a very symbolic Chinese affair from
ex-Governor Nathan, of Queensland.
In Sydney arranging with Australasian
Films about the production of “The
Pioneers” —the novel that won her a £5OO
prize—is Katherine Prichard (Mrs. Hugo
Throssell). Katherine, by the way,_ is some-
thing of a socialist, and has a special desire
to better the lot of tearoom girls. No doubt
she will devote the profits from her film pro-
duction to their welfare.
Mrs. D. J. Monk, who helps to mother
the old soldiers in the Veterans’ Home, La
Perouse, poured out tea in the snug dug-out
—designed to strike terror into the enemy
during a Russian scare in 1885—the other
afternoon. General Brand and his lady
were paying a good-bye visit to the pictur-
esque rockery appropriately called Bare
Island. There was a glitter like shining
rows of brass and silver saucers as the
veterans’ medals gleamed on well-brushed
ancient uniforms. The oldest member of
the tea-party owned up to 87; the lad of
the group, an ex-Grenadier Guardsman, was
a mere 65.
Among the good resolutions of the Public
Hospitals for 1926 should be: “No cadging
from strangers visiting Australia.” The
American Fleet was held up with collection-
boxes for our kiddies’ hospital, and most of
us felt like worms over that. But the action
of the Sydney Hospital in sending a suppli-
cation to the Carinthia at Auckland was a
slur on surely the most generous city in
the world. The hand of Sydney is in a state
of perpetual motion between its pocket and
a collection-box. Thousands are contributed
yearly to the public hospitals, and every
patient pays what he or she can afford. If
the authorities cannot manage on the funds
thus provided within the country, it is
time the Government took over these insti-
tutions and taxed us for their upkeep.
No N. S. Wales politician has had more
help from his wife than Loughlin, Minister
for Lands and deputy-leader for Premier
Lang. She is not a political woman in
the partisan sense; but she is so tactful that
in the big, Cootamundra electorate all doors
lie open to her. She first met her Peter in
the Cowra district, whither he had gone, a
stripling, to hold his first job in the Edu-
cation Department teaching aboriginals.
That was 20 years ago.
Brisbane winds up the year:—
The Boxing Day races were held at Ascot adjacent
to green lawns and a brocade of flowers. Mrs.
Howes entertained pals in the new tearooms in the
members’ stand in a pleated frock of golden georgette,
Mrs. Whittingham, who has recovered from her
motor accident, looked it in amethyst and mauve.
Mrs. Cecil Palmer was in red and gold; ivory maro-
cain sheathed Mrs. Julia Creek Lipscombe; and grey
and white was worn by Mrs. Coldham. Amongst the
girls, Cecily Cadell Garrick was in white and rose;
Paula Fitzgerald in rose; and Jean Graham in ivory.
The Footts say with obvious sincerity that they
rejoice at being back in Bananaland. Mary Hannay
Foott’s son is a Queenslander, and although his
wife was born in Victoria, her grandfather was the
late G. T. McDonald of Toowoomba, and she knew
Brisbane as a girl, though it is six years since she
shook the dust of our crowded burg from her shoes.
She declares she means to have a prize garden in
Brisbane, where “everything grows.” Son Allan,
who won the King’s Medal, the Sword of Honor
and the Oswald Watt Prize, is doing an engineering
course at Sydney Uni. Colonel and Mrs. Ridley are
entertaining the new 7 Commandant till January 6,
when he moves into Victoria Barracks.
The Druids’ Hall blossomed into shasta-daisies
and roses for the Basket Ball Club’s part} 7 , at which
the wee Fordham baby presented bouquets in pale
blue flowers’ to Miss Bedford and Mrs. McGregor
Lowndes. Ex-Judge Jamieson, whom our wretched
climate has spared into the hale eighties, presented
the trophies won during 1925. The lire Kinless
maiden carried off the gold medal given by Dinning
for the best all-round player, and the Lilian Cooper
Cup w 7 as captured by the Shamrock team. Miss
Bedford w 7 as handed a gift of stationery from the
playground girls; and the director, Tress Hunter, got
a silver tea-and-coffee service from the Shamrocks.
Dancing and music wound up the party.
Simla Convalescent Home had a very fine Christmas
decoration scheme with boughs of fir and ribbon
canopies, in red, white and blue, Japanese bamboo
and pink gladioli; and at the Brodribb Home there
were holly and sunflowers cheek-by-jowl, and a
ceiling of ribbon streamers.

SERVICE
He receives the greatest reward who most successfully adapts his service io
the general need. Every man who enters into trade proclaims, voluntarily or
involuntarily, that he was not sent into this world to wait upon himself; but to
find his own welfare in working for his neighbor.
A man does not learn to make shoes because he has a fancy to wear a new
pair every day, but because he know's that all people need shoes. A Bank does
not gather money together just for the sake of hoarding it in safes. It gathers
money together in order that it mgy be more profitably employed—in other words
it makes your money work so that it shall earn rather more than its keep—and
passes the profit thus made to you in the form of interest.
There is service to your every need in your own Bank, the

Wonderful weather, hot, but with a tem-
pering breeze, was the New Year’s gift to
this garden city. From early morn holiday-
makers were astir, and dozens of jaunting-
cars set out for Fern tree Gully, Nathania
Springs (where the tame trout feed from
the visitor’s hand) and other favorite hill
and seaside picnic spots.
At Flemington gowns of painted chiffon
and embroidered georgette and shady, hats
and parasols of rainbow hues tried conclu-
sions with flowei’beds of yellow and purple
pansies. Suggesting the last echo of the last
word in fashion was a frock of fawn georgette
punctuated with lace, dangling a full-length
cape of the filmy material and allied to a
headpiece of golden-brown crinoline straw.
Mrs. 11. H. Smith appeared in white voile
and Irish crochet, with pink roses nodding
on a black hat. Triple flounces of loops
of ribbon were featured upon Mrs. H. Mc-
Roberts’s grey crepe-de-Chine gown. Marie
la Varre saw the vice-regal Trice’s win
in a black satin suit with a small
hat splashed with gold. Mrs.
Driver brightened a brown hat with
sealing-wax red, and her nigger geor-
gette frock was fur-bordered. Mrs. Fred
Payne was in up-to-date dressing of putty
silk crepe, with encroachments of cherry and
gold embroidery. Mrs. W. M. Robins, in
floral patterned black and old gold, was
accompanied by her daughter, Mrs. Widge
Gray, from Donald, whose frock was of
chiffon in submerged tones of green and blue.
Mrs. James Purves included in her party
her daughter Valerie and Bea and Jane
Evans, of the harbor city, who are to join
their parents for a jaunt to the Great Smoke.
Mrs. A. V. Kewney, wife of the V.R.C.
secretary, gave the social representatives of
the local press the midday repast and a 4
o’clock pick-me-up ; Mrs. T. A. Tarbart, who
wore black raiment with variegated foliage
on her millinery, and Mrs. Rogers Thomson,
who enlivened a black ensemble suit and hat
with touches of green, being also entertained.
The hostess wore wide-leafed, rust-hued mil-
linery above black georgette patterned with
pastel-liued roses and a cliantilly lace scarf.
A visit to the Carinthia revealed that the
passengers carry Amurrican efficiency and
thoroughness even into the business of losing
things. Judging by the testimony of the
notice-board they are capable of losing any-
thing. It was intriguing to discover also
that even millionaires and near-millionaires
are not allowed to spill ink in the ladies’
writing-room, with its lapis lazuli-hued car-
pets and pillars and blue and silver brocade
upholstered furniture. In harmony with
the furnishings of this room were Wedgwood
cameo ornaments in show cabinets, plaques
of this ware exhibiting the features of
Edward P. and the Duke and Duchess of
York. The tourists evidently didn’t bring
aboard any picture of the White House,
Hank Coolidge. Abraham Lincoln or the
Father of his country, or if they did they
didn’t leave these apports where a journal-
istic eye could discover ’em.
Sunday found some of the Carinthia’s
tourists speeding all over the city in cars,
while others bustled along the pavements
pulling up suddenly to gaze upon posters
outside the flicker theatres depicting Amui - -
rican movie actors —a touching reminder of
home. The thermometer stated that it was
95 in the shade, so that a good deal of curi-
ous attention was paid to a group of spec-
tacled males with cameras slung like field-
glasses over heavy winter suits —one was in
plus fours and a tweed cap. At 10 o’clock
on Sunday night the anchor was weighed
and the restless nation’s rush round the
world resumed.
An almost entire cessation of social events
reflects that after-Christmas feeling. Even
the golf links and clubs are deserted. The
diurnal and eternal question, “Who’s deal?”
too, is for the moment unheard. Speaking
of bridge recalls a little story. Two smart
flappers blessed with wealthy papas, a man
about'town and an average girl made a four.
Stakes of half a crown were proposed by
the affluent damsels; but a mirror disclosed
to the male member of the quartette the
startled expression of the other maiden.
“Girls, I won’t play for more than three-
pence a hundred ; I never do,” he gallantly
lied; and the Recording Angel chalked up his
day’s good deed.
Swanston-street has looked these last few
days as if it were suffering a recovery from
an earthquake. The toy-like cable-tram no
longer trundles and tinkles along the street,
and the motor-’buses, too, have been banished,
for the uprooting of blocks for the coming
of the electric tram began on the Sabbatb
afternoon after Christmas. Two hundred and
fifty men working round the clock in three
shafts then proceeded to make a record. Along
St. Ivilda-road the last cable-car was run on
Saturday night. Immediately it had passed
gangs of men flung themselves on to the
track. The oxyacetylene blowlamps cut
down like kiiives into cheese, and the cables
which have hummed under the roadway for
so many years were wound on to gigantic
drums at the power-house. By Sunday
afternoon electric-trams were running. The
last cable-car arriving at the depot was
given an ovation, and cantered into the
building jauntily carrying a memorial wreath
some mourner had hung on it.
Treasurer Alec Peacock and his wife cele-
brated their silver wedding on New Year’s
Day. She was Millie Holden, daughter of
the owner of broad acres at Port Fairy, and
the match was the outcome of the A.N.A.
Conference at Popt Fairy in March, 1889.
He was Chief Secretary in Turner’s second
Ministry when he was married, and six weeks
afterwards became Premier for the
time. Three months later the country mouse
had to take precedence next after the Mad-
den dame (John Madden, C.J., was Acting-
Governor) during the visit of George and
Mary, then Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.
By just being herself she acquitted herself
wonderfully and made a host of friends right
away. Their home is at Creswick, in the
centre of Alec’s Allandale constituency, and
probably she is the only one who could beat
him for the pocket borough.
Gladys Moncrieff these days is doing her
best to show the Firm what it is losing in
letting her go. She is singing magnifi-
cently, and it was only the happy face of
the Merry Widow that was visible above
baskets of gladioli and sheaves of watsonia
and carnations when the band played the
final "God Save” at the Theatre Royal on
Saturday night. The return of Andrew Hig-
ginson, who has played varied roles since
he was Danilo to Carrie Moore’s fascinating
bereaved and was the idol of our feminine
society, caused wild enthusiasm. After the
show he confessed that he. liked his new
Merry Widow very much —imprinting at this
stage'a kiss of approval upon Gladys’s un-
protesting lips.
But the glories of Lehar’s most popular
achievement are faded, and it isn’t as wicked
as it used to seem. Lord, how dull and
decorous Maxim’s is compared with mod-
ern hotel-cabaret, or even local dance-palais!
To brighten things up a bit, instead of the
customary solemn black the Widow wore
at the Paris rendezvous an evening
gown that faded from Canterbury-bell
hue to nearly white, the lighter tunic
glistening in crystal and silver upon the
darker skirt, self-beaded, wedded to a dinky
little hat of net with coronet surround,
purple and shimmering. For her first entry
she sported georgette in cosmos hue with
rivulets of diamente and bordering of pansies.
Byrl Walkley as Natalie had a pretty frock
of apricot lace and taffeta with quillings of
jade and gold ribbon. The picturesque Mar
sovian costumes made color for the second
act and its famous waltz. The revival was
to a crowded house.
Carrie Haase, Melbourne’s leading teacher
of the “Art of Speaking Verse” (it isn’t
called “elocu-
tion” any
longer), is
home again
after a sojourn
in London and
excursions to
Paris, Rome
and Florence.
She pleased
the critics with
the recital she
gave at the
Beaux Arts
when the can-
vases of Hilda
Rix Nicholas
decorated the
gallery’s walls.
The Victorian
painter de-
signed special
apparel of gold
brocade
fashioned in
old Florentine mode for the speaker, and
Mrs. George Fairbairn prefaced the proceed-
ings. In the photo alongside she is pic-
tured as a character in the play “Favitri,”
an Indian love story, arranged by the Union
of East and West, in which she took part
in the Great Smoke. She hopes to follow
an English precedent by giving regular read-
ings of modern verse. Southampton boasts
of a room above a quaint bookshop where
poets and playwrights congregate and read
their own outpourings on specified after-
noons, Masefield and John Drinkwater being
of a company who thus entertain an audi-
ence, making a charge of sixpence for admis-
sion. Harold Munro, a rising rhyme-maker,
keeps the emporium below, and finds the
connection helps sales.
Melbourne made but little fuss over the
coming of 1926. A big crowd watched the
hands of the post-office clock in Bourke-
street arrive at the end of 1925, and then
went demurely off to bed. Early in the
evening small boys in weird garb wandered
round the streets emitting strange noises with
their mouths and gleaning largesse from the
burgesses. Floral presentations at the
theatres ran to outsizes, ranging from what
looked like waste-paper baskets of gladioli
to botanical horseshoes so huge as to need
the support of a backbone of piping.
Richards, of Ballarat, made this little pic-
ture of Amalie Feild, who has won a fresh
success with
a series of
d e c o ra t ive
illustrations
for use in
primary
schools and
kindergartens.
Recognising
her unusual
ability, our
Education De-
partment sent
Miss Feild to
Sydney to
study stained-
glass and pot-
tery designing,
and she re-
turned to in-
struct classes
in these sub-
jects. The
illustrations
are quite a
new venture —the first of the kind _ designed
and lithographed in Australia. Their charm-
ing simplicity proclaims a talent for ex-
pressing facts with few means. Jack and
the Beanstalk, Tom Thumb, the Babes in
the Wood, Little Red Riding Hood —about
each picture there is the real touch. A
truly Machiavellian wolf it is that lures
Riding Hood on to her destruction. The
homely suroundings of Tom Thumb, seated
on the edge of the dish, assure us that the
picture is genuine. The delight in every
line of Jack at the success of his efforts at
chopping the beanstalk is most realistic.
The sweetness in expression of childhood in
the Babes could only be achieved through
studying with great sympathy the lines of
childhood. All the pictures are artistic in
their coloring, too.
Matron E. Simons and nurses of the
Queen Victoria Hospital jazzed the old year
out in the outpatients’ hall, beautified for the
event with lights twinkling under shades
of orange, gold and tender green. Toy trum-
pets and other dreadful instruments handed
out by a Mother (or was it Sister?) Christ-
mas whose hiding-place was a giant plum-
duff enabled the staff to give 1926 a
noisy glad welcome. Superintendent Dr. F.
Rarer, Dr. Constance Ellis, secretary Miss
Colville and other officials condoned the pro-
ceedings by their presence.
The Bridge Club, which lives in Mc-
Ewan’s Buildings, entertained members at
cards and a hop on New Year’s Eve. The
Oriental Hotel and Bibron’s also each
afforded a roof to special doings connected
with the speeding and welcoming of the
years.
Sheltered beneath gay silk and paper,
many enthusiasts applauded the players in
the finals of the South Yarra Tennis Club’s
tournament. Many pretty frocks were worn
by spectators; the players favored fine pleat-
ings. Vera de Bavay appeared in a sports
suit of white satin, topped by a headpiece
of almond-green straw decked with pink
roses; Joan McArthur wore a linen frock
of china blue, with attachments and hat of
white; and Esna Boyd had a white voile
gown traced with blue and a golden-toned
hat.
Congratulations to Mayor Brunton on tfie
acquisition of his handle are pretty genuine,
for S’Bill and his lady have always shown
themselves ready to do folks a good turn.
She has her fair share of looks, commendable
taste in dress and too much sense to put
over-much importance upon the new trapping.
Mrs. Ashton, wife of his Grace of Grafton,
has taken a house at Hawksburn for the
school vacation, while the Bishop divides
a short holiday between Melbourne and Adel-
aide. Three members of the family reside
here. Dr. Margaret Ashton is house sur-
geon at the Children’s Hospital; Dr. Gerard
Ashton has a similar job at Melbourne Hos-
pital ; and a son, Marcus, has just com-
pleted his second-year arts at the ’Var-
sity. The student son is something of a
genius in classics, and has walked off with
numerous prizes. Academic success runs in
the family, since prior to wedding the church
(so to speak) Mrs. Ashton was one of the
first women in Bananaland’s capital to take
a University course, graduating in arts.
Eileen, eldest daughter of R. de Courcy
Shaw, of the Bank of Australasia, Ballarat,
accepted the gift of a plain gold ring from
Frank Gooch, son of the late G. F. Gooch,
of Sale, at the Ballarat Cathedral the other
day. She wore ivory georgette with embel-
lishment of gold lace, a bouquet of water-
lilies and a coiffure adornment of pearls
and orange blossom, with floatings of silk
tulle. Her one attendant maid was softly
arrayed in pleatings of apple-green geor-
gette and ecru lace.
The Hennessy dame has now added the
nurture and care of a horse to her respon-
sibilities, having become deputy-custodian of
the colt Muratti, given by Ben Cliaffey to
be raffled for St. Vincent’s Hospital. The
demand for tickets threatens to break all
previous records, for the youngster is well
pedigreed.
The Alfred Hospital is the proud possessor
of a piano given by the hospital’s auxiliary
and paid for entirely out of the proceeds of
raffles. A handy contribution to the fund
was made at the Christmas party for the
little patients when a huge Christmas stock-
ing, the bright idea of Mrs. Barry Thom-
son and Mrs. Maurice Patkin, brought in a
profit of over £2O.
The news that the musical societies of
Melbourne have got tired of paying rent and
mean to have a hall of their very own was
broken gently to patrons at the Philhar
monic’s performance of “The Creation”; a
full-page illustration of the palace of their
dreams embellished the programme. Tlxe
plan is all there is of the scheme just at
present: but there is energy behind it. Re-
presentatives of the Albert-street Con. and
the societies, including Alberto Zelman,
Frizt Hart and Jimmy Dyer, approached
the Government, asking for a bit of the
Domain to build their temple upon, Acting
Prime Minister Watt having promised dur
iug his holding of the reins to aid musical
societies in this way. The law-makers are
sympathetically considering the request, and
it is possible that at long last Melbourne
will have a real concert-hall, properly
equipped for big choral and orchestral per-
formances.
This week’s overseas mail brings news of
a very successful season in Bombay of
Alfred Hill’s “Maid of the Mountains,” Jay
Madeleine Rossiter’s musical comedy co.
Nona Wilkins, of Sydney, played Teresa, with
Connie Milne in the role of Vittoria.
Performing members of the Melbourne
Philharmonic Society have handed conductor
Alberto Zelman a pair of sleeve-links
as a memento of the society’s performance
of “Lohengrin” lately, when he stepped into
the breach created by the sudden indisposi-
tion of the tenor soloist and sang the part in
addition to waving the baton. The incident
recalls an occasion in Sydney when the
Royal Philharmonic presented “The Golden
Legend” and two, if not three, of the leads
were so shaky regarding time and melody
that Joseph Bradley had to save the situation
by filling in the vocal gaps as well as keep-
ing choristers and orchestra together.
Old Mrs. Pendergast. of Benambra, claims
the sock-knitting record for this State. She
has just sent in her 1095th pair to the Red
Cross.
Miss Adelaide discourses :
With the holiday exodus Victor Harbor and tlr
Hills have become the hubs of our social universe,
and, life in town is chiefly devoted to thanking
Heaven for cool weather.
Two days’ racing at Port Adelaide drew record
crowds and brought his Victorian Ex. over to watch
Night Patrol’s easy wins and hand the Cup to Mr.
Gardiner; but Court mourning kept Lady Bridges
away and robbed the gathering of some of its
social frill. The mayoral Bruces and their daughter
were there—they promise to be as keen racegoers
as their predecessors. Black (of which we’ve had
more than enough) made way for blue as the color
note of the dressing; there were sunshades of every
material, from shimmering tissue to vivid cretonne;
and there were some comfortably fat dividends.
At Glenelg were the usual pioneers’ lunches, with
one notable absentee: Miss Marianne Fisher, who
begins her hundredth year next month and is the last
of the Buffalo survivors, sent her regrets that she
could not be there. She is now making her home at
Cummins, the old Morphett home near Glenelg
(built in 1840), where her great-nephew, George
Morphett, is her host. Thirteen years ago, at 85,
she went voyaging to England, motored all through
Wales, and went on to Maoriland soon after she
got back. She writes her own letters and does up
her own Christmas parcels; plays cards, reads for
herself, and scouts the idea that she needs any
special diet. The Bridges looked in to see her
on their way to Glenelg.
Voyaging South Australians include the A. E. V.
Richardsons and their daughter and St. Peter’s
College headmaster Bickersteth. The latter plans
to include Palestine, Egypt and Italy in his journey-
ings. Professor Richardson is in search of the
latest things in scientific agriculture. Meanwhile
one wanderer has returned to us—Miss Winifred Scott,
best known as “Magpie,” of the Register.
The engagement is announced of Helen, daughter
of Dr. and Mrs. Yeatman, of Brighton, to one of
the Simpsons of Mosman, Sydney.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
It was a lucky day for Pat Osborne when
he bought Valieare for 1700 guineas. Three starts,
three wins is the Valais—Courante filly’s record to
date, and she looks to have a mortgage on the
rich Adrian Knox Stakes at the end of the month,
while she is certain to figure prominently in the
Newmarket betting if the V.R.C. handicapper gives
her a reasonable weight. Favorite at 2 to 1 for
the Carrington Stakes at Randwick, the brilliant
bay trailed Lilah and Tinv’s Court to the home
turn and came away as soon as Hunter let her
have her head. Valais Queen (20’s) was second,
two lengths behind the three-year-old, and Valiard
(10’s) \yas a fair third, with Leslie Wallace, Lilah,
Irish Prince and Anambah close up. It was Leslie
Wallace’s first race for about 15 months, and inas-
much as he sweated profusely before going out
and finished fast (as also did Irish Prince), he may
be expected to improve. The time for the six-
furlongs was lmin. lllsec., and Valicare’s price on
the grandstand tote, which declared three dividends,
was a trifle more than 6 to 4.
Dainty Davie was served up warm for the Tatter-
sail’s Club Cup, 12 furlongs. Although there were
15 starters, McShortodds cried “Evens the field,”
and many mugs took the ridiculous price. But
hoi-ses don’t win distance races at Randwick in
the Dainty Davie fashion without taking a lot out
of themselves. As in the Holiday Handicap and the
Summer Cup, the son of Don Reynaldo—The Knot
tried to got a break on the field over the last half-
mile, but this time Moisha took some shaking off, and
when Player (20’s) and Luddenham (25’s) tackled
him at the entrance to the straight, the favorite
could not come on. Momentarily Luddenham looked
like winning, but he shifted towards the outer fence,
as is his cranky habit, and Player, who was piloted
by little Hasler, beat him home by a length and
a half in 2min. 31fsec. Hemisphere, who carried
a 101 b. penalty for his Villiers Stakes success, was
a creditable third, and The Wild Goose, Dainty
Davie and Pigeon Pie were next. Player, a son
of Comedy King—Palena, is another of those four-
year-olds. who this season have won the Epsom.
Metropolitan and Toorak Handicaps, the Villiers
Stakes and the Melbourne, Summer and. Tatt.’s Club
Cups, besides a heap of minor handicaps and w.f.a.
races. He is owned by E. J. Watt and trained at
Randwick by Pat Nailon, who had a notion that
Highlander would prove the better of his pair.
Highlander’s day will come.
On the strength of his decent race in
the Carrington Stakes, Irish Prince was backed
down to 3 to 1 for the £5OO Hurstville Stakes at
Moorefield (N.S.W.), and Dick Wootton’s horse won
comfortably from Red Gauntlet and Egerton. He
has the same weight—Bst. 31b. —in the A.J.C. Chal-
lenge Stakes, to be run at Randwick on January 23,
and will have a decided hance if he can be kept
right. So, with the sam. proviso, will Leslie Wal-
lace, Bst. 91b.
* * * *
Holt started three in the Standish Handi-
cap at. Flemihgton on New Year’s Day—Metellus
(9st. 91b.), Sailing Home (9st. 41b.),'and Trice
(ist. 121 b.). Lady Stfadbroke’s mare was the out-
sider of the trio, but proved the best bet. Metellus
was favorite at 4’s, with Adrift at 7’s, Poetaster,
Cadorus andAmanteel at B’s, Coogee Bay at 12’s and
luce at 25 s. The last-named, who drew No. 8
marble, was in front soon after the start, and,
gradually working towards the stand side, she lasted
long enough to win by a long head from Adrift
(9st. 71b.) and Perspective (7st. 101 b.), who appeared
to be unlucky in running. Poetaster was fourth, and
Tarquin (Phalaris —Perfect Peach), an imported
horse belonging to A. P. Wade, ran a good race,
but Metellus was never sighted. “Tich” Wilson rode
Trice, -who gaUoped the straight six in lmin. 12£sec.
A feature of the betting on the Bagot Handicap, 12
furlongs, wa3 the solid backing of Master Vibrator
(Bst. 131 b.), who started second favorite with Spear-
age at s’s. Suomi, who was thought to have been
unlucky in the Hopetoun Cup, was always favorite—
-9 to 4 when operations ceased —and The Tyrant was
well supported at 6’s, but there was little money for
anything else. Sandringham (20’s) led most of the
time, but once in the straight Master Vibrator ran
to the front, and at the judge’s box he was half
a length in front of the unlucky Spearage, with The
Tyrant the same distance away third. The Comedy King
—Vibrate gelding had run indifferently in the Hope-
toun Cup, and his success (the first since June, 1924)
was not popular. He completed a nice double for
Holt, who trains him for C. B. Kellow; Duncan rode
him, and the time was 2min. 353 sec. Greensborough
(B’s), who had taken a two-year-old race at Williams-
town on Cup Day, scored brilliantly in the Criterion
Handicap for youngsters, and is a good advertisement
for his sire, Greenstead. Lastly, Sol Green’s imported
horse Robespierre (2’s) won the January Handicap
handily from Ouragan and Lorna B. He was the
only favorite to do it during the day.
* * * *
Outsiders were conspicuous in the prin-
cipal events of the W.A.T.C.’s Cup meeting. Eupator
(25’s), Pitch (50’s) and Leopos (12’s) filled the
places in the £lOOO Railway Stakes, for Which
Easingwold was a hot favorite, and Great Applause
SHE WOULDN’T KNOW.
“Do you play golf?”
“No! I’m afraid I wouldn’t even know how to hold the
caddie.”
(10’s), Prince Macdonald (20’s) and Eracre (4’s)
in the £2OOO Perth Cup. Eupator, who used to
race at Randwick, returned his backers £l6 14s.
on the 10s. s.o. tote. Great Applause, an aged
Fremantle-trained mare by Great Sport —Laudatory,
made hacks of the Cup field, which included imported
Egyptian Idol and Murky Night and the former
Sydney horses Tremolo and Tranquil.
The Port Adelaide R.C. hung up some fine
prizes at its annual meeting— £ 3500 for the Port
Adelaide Cup, £lOOO for the Christmas Handicap,
a six-furlongs affair, and £950 for a couple of
w.f.a. races, which induced Gov. Stradbroke to send
The Night Patrol from Melbourne. The club boasts
a progressive committee, and its totalisators are so
ponular that £68,422 2s. 6d. was staked the first
day, a total which is not often beaten at Randwick.
The Night Patrol was not extended in the W.f.a.
events, and Some Opera, a St. Anton —-Royal Opera
mare, owned and trained by J. Tait, won the
Christmas Handicap, with Cashbox and Stage Queen
in the places; the £1 machine returned £9 12s. on
Some Opera and £3 16s. on Cashbox. Despite her
9st. 41b., Lemina, last year’s winner, -was favorite
for the Cup, and the little St. Spasa—-Guinevere
mare never gave her backers cause for uneasiness,
being second to the pacemaker, Parvista, half a mile
from home, and first, with the race in hand, as
they entered the straight. Her grandstand dividend
was exactlv 3 to 1, whereas Parvista, who finished
second (Our Saint was third), paid at the rate of
6J to 1. The small chestnut, who ran the 1 mile
6 furlongs and 74 yards in 3mifi. 3Lsec., is trained
by T. Matson for C\ L. Gardiner, and was ridden by
B. Matson, who had the mount last year. Among
the other starters was Mirthmaker, well and un-
favorably known to Randwick punters. The old
rogue, who is now trained by H. W. Torr (he is
owned by a veteran journalist who races under the
name of “Will Bennetts”), paid the expenses of
his S. Aus. trip by winning the New Year’s Gift at
Morphettville and” returning £7 4s. on the £1
tote. Pistol Grip, the runner-up, paid £6 3s.
“Moreton”: A few months ago Q.T.O.
committeeman E. L. Ramsay, who has a big string
of horses, sold the then disappointing Leverner
mare Levento for £lOO. Since then Levento has
had seven starts for five firsts and a second. She
has won £BlO in stakes for her bookmaker-owner,
and onlv that) worthy knows how much in bets. At
Ascot oh Boxing Day the cast-off scampered home in
front of the pride of the Ramsay stable, the imported
colt The Black Joke; and she completed the sprint-
ing double of the meeting on New Year’s Day.
“Ascot”: * Ascot, one of Brisbnno’s two
registered racecourses, is of the spacious Randwick
tvpe Almost a perfect oval in shape, it has a wide,
well-grassed track, H mile in circumference,
with long, sweeping curves at the turns and a two-
furlong straight. On the other hand, Wren’s course
at Breakfast Creek (known as Albion Park) is a
narrow, little merry-go-round rink, only six furlongs
in circumference, with an artificial sand track, sharp
turns and a straight only a furlong long. When a
horse runs a bye at “the Creek” and wins at “the
Farm,” or vice versa, the owner, if carpeted, ex-
plains that his nag could not handle the sand track
(or the grass, as the case may be), or that the
turns were too sharp or too wide, or the straight
too short or too leng. At his next outing the
quadruped perhaps calls his owner a liar by winning
oh the course he could not handle, but it is too
late for the stewards to say anything then. It is
a fact that a few good “Creekers” never run well
at Ascot, but the generality of Brisbane prads is just
as much at home on one course as the other. At
the Christmas meeting of the Q.T.C., the first three
races were won by horses which had succeeded the
previous Saturday at Albion Park.

Billy Grime grievously disappointed that
large portion of the Sydney Stadium crowd which
packed the benches on Saturday night in the hope of
seeing him licked. He flatly refused to be licked;
on the contrary, he beat Ignacio Fernandez well
on points, though referee Wallis called it a draw at
the. end of 20 rounds. Having carefully studied the
methods of the little bronze model from the Philip-
pines, Grime had no fear of Ferdv’s lightning right
or weighty left. He knew exactly what to do to
avoid those weapons and land his own. Fernandez
hit with his usual force, but he mostly hit only
the smoke-laden atmosphere, while nearly every punch
that' Grime sent over got there. The portion of
the crowd aforesaid hooted William’s amazing head-
work and footwork. The rest hooted the decision, so
a big e»owd had its simple pleasure, anyway.
Weights: Fernandez, Bst. B£lb. ; Grime, Bst. 1231 b.
In the glad, confident morning of speedway
racing it was not uncommon to see a car or a cycle
win by half a mile. Nowadays, as the New Year
meeting at Maroubra (N.S.W.) illustrated, there is
more economy of effort. A wheel ahead is as good
as a mile, earns the same prize-money, has very
little effect on the handicap, and gets the public
On its tip-toes in excitement. There is no falling
off in the speeds attained while
the backmarkers are overhauling
their field, but the tendency is
lor race times to be slower. It
was evident in many cases on
Saturday that the driver had the
handicapper in his mind’s eye at
all stages of the game. Also,
spectators who had been wonder-
ing why the management erected
stout steel torpedo nets round the
bend leading to the finishing
straight found out when Allan
Cooper’s Ballot car, which had
edged too far up the bank in an
effort to pass two other cars racing
abreast, skidded slightly and struck
the fence. Bits of the Ballot
flew in all directions, Cooper and
his mechanic, McCormack, accom-
panying them in their flight. The
back axle, to which one wheel
adhered, shot straight into the air
as if impelled by a geyser, to
fall with a thud quite an appreci-
able time later. The stout nets
adequately protected the public,
but poor McCormack had both
legs broken; while Allan Cooper,
whose plucky driving has been
an especially bright feature of the
sport at Maroubra, had to con-
template the ruins of a car in
which he had previously won a
five-miles scratch race in 3min.
26 3-ssee., attaining in one lap 96 m.p.h.
George Dempsey and Ken Ross collected
the big money in the six-days’ bike race on the
Sydney Sports Ground; Fitzgerald and Marshall
were second, and Opperman and Gibaud next. The
distance covered was 1751 miles 1320 yards, whereas
2086 miles 1680 yards were recorded by Alf Goullet
and P. Hehir at Sydney Cricket Ground in 1912.
The world’s best figures (Oscar Egg and F. Verri
registered them at Chicago) are 2804 miles.
* * * *
H. L. Collins, .Tack Ryder and Clem Hill
have chosen 12 of the 15 cricketers who are to
leave for England in March. The dozen, with their
ages and States, are: Collins (37), Bardsley (41),
Macartney (40 in June), Mailey (38), Andrews
(35), Taylor (30), Gregory (30), and Oldfield (29),
from N. S. Wales; Ryder (36), Hendry (30) and
Ponsford (25), from Victoria; and Grimmett (34),
from South Aus. Collins will captain the team,
and although he. doesn’t handle his bowlers as skil-
fully as Noble and the late Harry Trott did, there
is not a better skipper in sight. Gregory, Macart-
ney, Taylor, Oldfield, Grimmett and Ponsford have
also earned their places. But in Bardsley, who is
to be vice-captain, the. selectors have picked a
Reputation. Never a bowler, he is no longer, first-
class in the country,, and for years past his batting
figures have been inferior to those of younger men
who are smarter and safer fieldsmen. Last season,
for instance, he played 10 innings v. England, Vic.
and S.A. for an average of 38.6, whereas Kippax
(12 inpings) averaged 73.80; Woodfull (10 inn-
ings), 61.75; Rymill (5 innings), 70.20; and Vic.
Richardson (17 innings), 45.88. Warren’s Test-
match average was 14.66, his highest score in six
attempts' being 24, and he has done nothing out
of the way this year. In selecting him in prefer-
ence to Kippax, Vic Richardson and Woodfull,
Collins and his associates were evidently swayed
by a reverence for the past, whereas they ought to
have been thinking of the future. Mailey is another
doubtful quantity. He was very expensive last
season, his bowling average in the Test matches
being 41.7. In 1921 he took 146 English wickets
for 2889, averaging 19.78, but many of his victims
were rabbits in the county matches, and he was
dropped in one of the Tests. One slow bowler is a
necessity, and Grimmett is the obvious man; but
the experiment of taking two is not warranted by
the English team’s experience with Freeman and
Tyldesley last year. Arthur Richardson, who had
a bowling and batting average of 31 in the Tests,
should have gone in before Mailey.
But the most astonishing feature of the selection
is the exclusion of Kelleway. Ninety-nine per cent,
of the cricketing public esteem Kelleway a better
man than Ryder, Hendry or Andrews, although these
three players should doubtless be included in the
final 15 (or 16). Unlike Bard»sley, Andrewsi,
Ryder and Hendry, he played in all the Tests last
season, making 252 runs and taking 14 wickets
for 413. He beat Bardsley’s batting average by
13.34 and Hailey’s bowling average by 10.78. In
the fifth Test at Sydney he scored 9 and 73 (the
latter at a critical stage) and took 3 wickets for
54. His record this season is 99 n. 0., 34, and 1 for
58, The Rest v. Australia; 50, and 3 for 53, N.S.W.
v. S.A. ; 145, 1 for 74 and 3 for 12, N.S.W. v.
Vic. There is still time for the selectors to repair
their omission, but if they persist in excluding our
greatest all-rounder, next to Gregory, their action
will leave a nasty taste in the mouth. And the
excuse that “Kelleway is a hard man to_ get on
with” will not suffice. The team needs Kelleway,
another good-length bowler (preferably Arthur
Richardson), a second wicket-keeper, of course
(and the claims of O’Connor and Rateliffe should be
considered as .well as those of Ellis and Love),
and more young blood. This page would like to
see Kippax, V. Richardson and Woodfull or Rymill
included, even if it means letting 18 share in the
profits instead of 15. Apart from the consideration
that some of the old stagers may break down, the
future of Australian cricket shoidd be taken into
account.
Cricket records are becoming an infliction
and a weariness; otherwise one might ask if ever a
team that scored over 400 in its first knock left the
field beaten by an innings and a whole lot. of runs
before that fate overtook Vic. at the hands of N.S.W
last week. The visitors replied to 413 with 705 and
supplemented the feat by rattling out Mayne’s men
for a paltry 130. The Ma State’s batsmen maintained
a high and remarkably level standard of run-getting;
everyone scored double figures except Hailey (n. 0.)
and no-one had made less than 29 or more than 81
till Kelleway and Oldfield came together late in
the innings. The pair spoiled the symmetry of
the score sheet with 145 and 129. Vic.’s second
innings was a doleful procession; nobody except
Baring (30) and Ponsford (26 n. 0.) made much
attempt to stay or stem the rout or rot. Kelleway
supplemented his batting success by taking 3 wickets
for 12 —Gregory, Macartney and Mailey accounted
for the rest —which makes his failure to catch the
eye of the selectors among the first 12 booked for
England as quite beyond explanation, if skill and
success in the field are the only things to be con-
sidered.
It soon-became evident that Victoria would have
to fight desperately hard to avoid a second defeat
this year at the hands of South Aus. Still, the
refusal of Ponsford to take the field for his State
after being picked to represent Australia overseas —
a refusal viewed very unamiably by the V.C.A. —
may have made all the difference to the home side’s
chances. Victoria batted first, and put together
232 laboriously. The bright star was Woodfull, who
got within three of his century; nobody else elevated
himself out of the twenties. Arthur Richardson had
the best bowling analysis with 3 for 40; Whitty
took 2 for 46 and Scott 2 for 51. South Aus-
tralia opened soberly enough; the opposition’s score
was not passed till more than half the side were
out, and nobody had done much at that stage except
V. Richardson (56) and A. Richardson (41). Then
the youthful and hard-hitting Rymill and the still
more youthful and equally aggressive Alexander —
he is only 18, and this was his first Sheffield Shield
match —came together, pasted the bowling all over
the field, and placed their side on velvet. Rymill
had made 124 when he was taken behind the sticks,
and Alexander knocked up 133 before he was run
out—another argument, if any were needed, on the
unwisdom of the selectors in giving robust youth
such a poor spin in their choice so far of the inter-
nationals for England. The innings closed for 462 ;
of the eight bowlers tried Hendry and Blackie took
3 wickets apiece for 74 and 132 respectively. Vic-
toria, 230 behind on first hands, made a good start
with Woodfull and Lansdown, though each had a
life before stumps were drawn on Monday.
Australia is badly off for bowlers, but it
was never so well supplied -with stumpers who are
useful batsmen. While Love and Oldfield were mak-
ing their centuries at Melbourne, Rateliffe and
O’Connor were scoring 106 and 74 in the N.S.W. v.
Queensland match at Sydney. Ratcliffe’s partner-
ships with that coming international Scanes (67)
and Punch (58) helped to give his side a lead of
238 on the first innings, and presently Queensland
was 184 behind with only seven wickets to fall.
But Tlfompson (150 n. 0.), L. Oxenham (119) and'
WARREN BARDSLEY, who has been
chosen to go to England again. He has
turned 41.
Huteheon (71) rose to the occasion, and Queensland
had none the worse of the draw. Thompson, whose
work is sound if not brilliant, got 114 for an
Australian XI v. England last season. Rateliffe like-
wise showed fine form with the bat for N.S.W. v.
Maoriland; the left-hander’s contribution to a total
of 531 was 128, while W. G. F. Brown’s was 168
and Mick Bardsley’s 87. The Maorilanders managed
to make a draw of it, as they did of their matches
against Vic. and South Aus. They have a brilliant
batsman in Blunt, whose leg shots are as good as
Vic Richardson’s, a capital medium-pace bowler in
Cunningham, and a serviceable all-rounder in All-
cott, who bats and bowls left-hand. On the wh'ole,
they are not quite up to the Sheffield Shield standard,
but they have done enough to show that M.L. cricket
is capable of reaching that standard with more
frequent opportunities of playing against first-class
men.
THE BURNING QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He wore an air of mingled care ,
And gloom, as one who’s quite
Convinced the woild is out of joint
And ponders wearily the point
Of how to set it right.
“Heart up!” I cried. He only sighed;
His corrugated brow
Betrayed the stress that racked his frame;
He muttered something was “a shame”
And somebody “a cow.”
“You feel distress”—l tried a guess—■
“Because the Judges set
Walsh and the other fellow free?
No need to groan .so dolefully,
The Law will flip them yet.”
He shook his head and tartly said
He didn't care a hang.
“I have it then,” I told him straight,
“It makes you sick to contemplate
The knavish tricks of Lang.
“To bounce De Chair was hardly fair
And force his Ex. to yield.
Withal it’s early to assume,
Like you, the Upper House’s doom
Is practically sealed.
“Take heart again, for threatened men
Live long. Whate’er may hap,
In Bavin they’ve a champion stout
Who never takes the knock without
A devil of a scrap.”
Impatiently he turned on me,
“Ring off!” he rudely bid,
“A man would be a chump or worse
To care a continental curse
What politicians did.”
“Then tell me who,” I said, “on you
Such misery can inflict.
What is it gnaws your soul?” He scowled.
“There’s blinking cause enough,” he growled.
“Why wasn’t Kelleway picked?”

THE INKY WAY.
“W.M.S.”: The commonest mis-spelling (B.
10/12/’25) ? My 35 years’ experience as a proof-
reader has convinced me that the word most fre-
quently distorted by letter-transposition is “grievous.”
“Nakhoda”: Australia is getting a little back on
Uncle. A writer to the American Mercury reports
the importation into the great American slanguage
of the Australian word “wowser,” and asks its
derivation. The handy epithet should find plenty
of employment over there.
“Roycha”: Will Farrow, whose book, “Practical
Cartooning for Profit,” has just come off the London
presses, is an Australian who learned his lines on
The Bulletin. He went across to London at the
end of the war, and since then has been placing his
black-and-white work with numerous periodicals.
George Coekerill, the new editor of Sydney Tele-
graph, was one of the Age’s white-haired boys for
28 years, as reporter, chief of staff and leader-writer;
and the news of his impending departure was a
shock to the Syme family. There is talk of a
re-shuffle of Age executive positions, and the paper
itself is to have considerable remodelling—badly
needed.
“Balala”: The proprietor of a paper at Auburn
(N.S.W.) has dodged the difficulty, known to editors
of most country papers, of dealing with the sub-
scriber who does not want his appearance at the
local police court chronicled. Each applicant has
to contribute a sum to the local hospitals in return
for his lapses going unrecorded. A drunk’s fee is
10s. 6d., late-trading a similar amount, a watered-
milk conviction brings £2 25., and so on. Last year
the local hospitals divided over £lOO from the
fund.
“Paree”: Another worry will be added to editors’
lives if the new Paris precedent finds favor else-
where. French law allows anybody considering
himself wronged by a newspaper statement to insert
a reply of the same length in an equally prominent
place. A literary countess has just pushed this
a step farther. An illustrated paper published a
caricature of her, and she insisted on—and ob-
tained—-publication on the' same page of a subse-
quent issue of a photograph showing that she is
really quite attractive.
“Avon”: It is becoming rather a habit of M.L.
metropolitan journals to hand over the reins of
management to journalists. Fred Earle, managing
director of the Wellington Dominion, Alex. Henderson,
manager of the Lyttelton Times, Alex. Burns, man-
ager of the Press, and Ted Huie, managing director
of the Sun, the last three all in the Flat City, are
cases in point. Now C. A. Marris has become
managing director of the Wellington Times. George
Fenwick, chairman of directors of the Otago Daily
Times, can be included ; but he was a printer before
he sat in the editorial chair of the “0.D.T.,” a
fact of which, to do him justice, the knight is proud.
“P.R.T.”: “Topee’s” statement (B. 17/12/’25)
that John Norton imported the word “wowser”
from the English Midlands is hard to swallow. John’s
own account of the origin of the word, given on
oath in the Hoare v. Norton libel case, was that
it was a happy inspiration. As an alderman of the
Sydney Council he fell foul of another alderman
and denounced him in his usual alliterative style as
“the weary, watery, wirewhiskered wowser from
Waverier.” Asked afterwards what he meant by
“wowser,” John said he didn’t know; “but he
looks like one, anyway.” Norton made many attempts
at inventing new words (“Parlipest,” “pulpest,” etc.),
but they all fell flat.
Willie Corlett, who has just relinquished the
job of chief of Vic. Hansard staff, having completed
his 65th year, got his training as a Parliamentary
reporter on the Argus in the days when that journal
used to devote the better part of a page to a night’s
sitting of each House. He was the “western”
roundsman in the days when Speight ruled at the
railways. After Speight and his two colleagues
had been suspended Corlett clashed with W. M.
Kibble, who was the middleman of the new trium-
virate and the pot of the Age. Kibble whined to
the Wilson-Mackinnon proprietary, but got no satis-
faction. Members of both State Houses bestowed
gifts on Corlett as souvenirs of his 25 years’ work
on Hansard.
“Sap”: An inky-wayfarer whose devotion to duty
and dislike of change are mixed in about equal
parts is Fred Johns, chief of Hansard staff in the
crow-eating State. Forty years ago he stepped on
to the wharf at Adelaide off a ship from the Cold
Land, and made his way to the Advertiser office,
where they gave him a job. Within a year he changed
over to the Register, and stayed with that journal
until Hansard claimed him for its own 12 years
ago. He has never missed a sitting of Parliament
since, and his absences from the House while it
has been sitting have not aggregated half an hour
a year—this despite a rather bad breakdown of
health a couple of years ago. For many years Free-
masonry was his hobby; but he seceded from the
craft a few months ago. He is most widely known
as author of that indispensable work “Johns’ Who's
Who in Australia.”
Just-dead A. R. Outtrim (Vie.) was well liked by
inky-wayfarers, and he reciprocated the feeling. It
pained him to send a reporter away empty-handed
when he was keen on a policy or departmental item
that was not quite hatched. Nobody could fly a
kite more skilfully. He was mildly resentful for a
day or two when his pet Sharebrokers’ Registration
Bill was obtained somewhere by “Curly” Norman
and published in the Argus from “Be it enacted” to
the last word in the final clause. Publication blighted
the bill (as was intended), but he forgave Norman,
and provided him with another scoop or two. The
Evening Standard junior who scored in 1892 with
the first news of the suspension of Speight, Ford
and Greene, Railway Commissioners, was indebted
to “A.R.” for the hint. On.more than one occasion
he butted in to prevent capable but non-pushing
inkslingers being passed over when office promotions
were being talked about. That the men he cham-
pioned invariably made good in the higher jobs
was testimony to his shrewdness.
“Fedup”: For some time past readers of the
venerable Argus have harbored a suspicion that the
dear old lady has reached the irresponsible stage
of seeqnd childhood, and on a recent Saturday, when
everyone expected an editorial deliverance on the
High Court decision on deportation, the matter was
put beyond doubt by a long, laborious atten.pt at
gaiety nailed clumsily upon the text of Mrs. Bruce's
attendance on her spouse during his election tour.
It was suggested that the wives, sisters, daughters
or aunts accompanying candidates should be given
a “living wage,” and paid 10s. per speech of two
hours’ length, 10 minutes being counted for interval,
It was laid down that such female relatives should
“act as a handicap—in the credit, not the debit
sense of the word,” and a column of this tripe
ended with the startling observation that “a woman
is like a democracy. Anything is possible when
she is present.” There was a time when the Argus
in a serious way could be very, very good; now it
is jocose it is very, very trying.’
A popular conception of a publisher is that of an
ogre in a den who withers by contemptuous blasts
of rejection. Reginald Watkin S. Wynn, manager
of the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., whom the blue pencil
of death recently deleted, was the antithesis of this.
He was as mild a mannered gentleman as ever
rejected MSS. In chat with friends he often ex-
pressed a wonder that he whose forebears had all
been sea-going men should come to labor in the
inky galley. That fact was largely due to A. C.
Rowlandson, the founder of the firm whose tentacles
stretch over the railway and ferry bookstalls of
Sydney and suburbs. He had a faculty for drawing
into his staff the right type of man, and in Wynn
found one in whom he placed such trust that at
his own decease it was provided that his understudy
should carry on the management. Wynn’s death
at 60, when apparently fit for many more years ot
good service, both to the public and to the authors
for whom the Bookstall novelettes offer one of
the best of the few avenues to print in Australia,
is a distinct loss —and something more than that
to the circle of friends attached to him.

Electrical development received its biggest impulse
when Westinghouse conceived the idea of harnessing
the tremendous reserves of power in Niagara Falls.
This was the starting point of modern electrical endeavor, and the
experience gained by over fifty years of electrical achievement has been put
into the development of the WESTINGHOUSE FARM ELECTRIC PLANT.

This is an age of progress. Men and women are no longer content to
“just manage” with makeshifts. Everyone wants the convenience of
Electric Light, and rightly so. In the country areas, electric light alone
means a wonderfully improved standard of living. * But when you
consider the multiplicity of odd jobs that can be done in the home and
on the farm with the aid of electric power, a Westinghouse' becomes
more than desirable—it becomes a necessity. It will provide power for
pumping, milking, separating, grinding, sweeping, washing, ironing,
and the sewing-machine, as well as many other tasks. It will provide power to operate a water-
pressure system and the means of fighting fire. It will run electric fans and the Kelvinator. In
short, it will make life easier, better and brighter, and it is so economical too.
The wonderful Westinghouse guarantees, too, are worth looking into, they protect you so fully.
You tell us what sort of work a plant could do for you, and we will tell you the type, size and
price of the plant you need, as well as how you can pay for it while you use it. Write for the
Westinghouse booklet, it is really interesting and will not obligate you in any way.

The visiting troupe of American million-
aires, etc., was Melbourne s best show on
Saturday and hundreds made their way to
the Carintliia to view the entertainment.
Similarly the 300-odd passengers—not all of
them as odd as they have been painted—
went to look at us, some of them selecting
the scenery, some the races and some the
soap-factories and iron foundries as our most
romantic aspects. Down in the bowels of
the ship Victoria’s champion swimmers gave
an exhibition in a bath more luxurious than
the one Hadrian built on sry land outside
Rome, while other visitors tried to gallop
over imaginary meadows on the electi-ic
hoi-ses or submitted their livers to the auto-
matic masseuse in the gymnasium. Two
spacious lifts convey the millionaires and
near-millionaires from their goi’geous suites
to the dining-room, which seats 300 people,
and there are palm-courts full of the music
of 150 singing-birds—live canaries, not
electrically controlled ones. There is a
lounge as solid as any set on English
earth, and out. of it one passes through
a stone-flagged corridor into a smoke-
room of white stucco, with a groined
ceiling and lead-lighted windows guarded
with iron grilles through which the light

falls on the figure of an armed knight stand-
ing at attention in the open fireplace. A
xnonk in steward’s livery mixes cocktails be-
hind an iron-studded oaken door, and passes
them out through a little wicket to the pro-
hibitionists, who gracefully lift the elbow
to a depraved old English custom. The
general ensemble is one of such tremendous
solidity and weight that even a bad sailor
like this commentator is apt to forget that
the lounge, the dining-i-oom and the armed
knight go up and down in a head-sea just
like the faded smoke-room of the old Bom-
bala. While all the limelight has been flooded
on the hustling sons and daughters of Colum-
bia, it is British officers and sailors and
. English steel plates that are hurrying them
round the globe.

“The Merry Widow” at Melbourne Theatre
Royal on Saturday, designed as a farewell
to Gladys Moncrieff, developed into a paean
of thanksgiving over the resurrection of
Andrew Higginson. The deliriously handsome
ancient, supposed to have been defunct these
many years, galumphed about the stage as
if 18 winters and the greatest war in history
hadn’t intervened since his appearance as
Prince Danilo in the original production ; and
even if the voice that issued from the sup-
posed corpse could best be described as a
rheumatic baritone, no cerements hung
around the form of the dissolute young man
who gaily wastes the substance of Marsovia on
the gay life of Maxim’s. Roused by a particu-
larly fine orchestration of the familiar music,
the hearts of staid married ladies warmed to
memories of how they threw their bangles
on the stage at that first performance. Gladys
Moncrieff’s Widow was not as merry as it
might have been, but her dramatic singing
lett nothing to be desired in a world where
most things end in melancholy imperfection.
Stigant as Baron Popoff kept the population
floating on the broad stream of his fantastic
fancy, which, however far it wanders along
the backwaters of irrelevancy, never forgets
to get back to the main current of the theme.
Nisch was in the capable hands, face and
feet of Herbert Walton, whose ensemble re-
called Alice’s carpenter, and anon her wal-
rus. Herbert Browne had tight-laced him-
self into the uniform pf the Vicomte de Joli-
don without stopping the passage for his voice,
which appears to be a developing instrument.
James Stephens was a stout and rather
hollow-sounding Ivhadja and Byrl Walkcly
made Popoff’s errant spouse a nifty bit of
naughtiness. A portion of the picture worth
honorable mention was Mabel Gibson, a West-
ralian girl with 12 months experience, who
as Fi-fi provided sufficient justification for
Prince Danilo’s neglect of the affairs of
state.

To-morrow night Merry-Widow Gladys
bears her laurels from the scene, and on
Saturday it will be “Lilac Time” at the
Royal, with Harriet Bennet, a new importa-
tion of the Firm, to give the Schubert melo-
dies a pair of wings.

To-morrow Melbourne Athenaeum will bid
adieu to “Give and Take,” and on Saturday
Tal Odell, who gave Dennis's Ginger Mick
a local habitation and a fame, will face the
first-night critics in the dual role of principal
performer and playwright of “Kangaroo
Flat,” a dinkum Australian comedy-drama.

Nightly at Melbourne King’s, where Renee
Kelly, as Polly with a Past,” presides over
a _ bachelor’s kitohenette, the delicate aroma
of a well-grilled steak steals over the audi-
torium. While the audience in the interval
is discussing the realistic atmosphere of the
play, the stage staff is discussing the steak,
which is the genuine gastronomic article.

A second helping of “The Music-box
Revue,” at Melbourne Palace, disclosed odd
defects. Some of the hangings would profit
by the attention of the seamstress, and the
otherwise bright show would be improved if
the act in which Madge White, arrayed in
a soiled bath-wrap, makes her knees black
and blue thi'ough chasing a cake of soap
were excised altogether.

At Melbourne Tivoli this week Ella
Shields, disguised in masculine glad rags,
sings “Aussie,” a locally-composed ditty for
which this Page, with all the goodwill in
the world, cannot prophesy immortality. Ye
Olde Nigger Minstrels remain the chief
.attraction after Ella. The Flemings turn
themselves successfully into ancient statues,
and Dox-othy Brown and her “mello piano”
provide a turn in the right vaudeville tradi-
tion, which demands that a musician shall
do everything with an instrument but play
on it.

At Melbourne Majestic this week punters
are losing their races over again in “The
Dixie Handicap,” a striking sporting picture
in which even the bookie is transmogrified
into a human being. The supporting feature
is “On the Stroke of Three,” a whirling
drama of N’York. At Hoyt’s De Luxe
Louise Fazenda is giving “Grounds for
Divorce,” and George O’Brien and Madge
Bellamy are crying “Havoc.” The war
scenes in the latter will only satisfy those
who have not seen the real thing, but the
studies of London during Armageddon are
good.
Another Butt-Rumford concert which, if
it was not all Butt, was all but, was staged
on Saturday night at Sydney Town Hall. As
usual clamorous hundreds burst into the

sion of the contralto’s “He Shall Wipe Away
All Tears.” Prices being “popular,” the
programme was made to match: it included
“She Wore a Wreath of Roses” and “The

In acquiring Lily Morris Sydney Tivoli
has made a splendid start for the New
Year; the robust English lady has a per-
sonality which belongs to an almost extinct
class of music-hall artist. Veteran variety
patrons, coaxed to Harry Rickards’ old house,
are enthusiastic over her artistry, and unani-
mously vote her a place among the great
character comediennes of the years. Rjie
Seven Hollanders are clever acrobats and
shrewd showmen into the bargain; except
for his height, Donald Stuart is a very ordi-
nary shuffler of cards and silk-handkerchief
conjurer; and Katrina and Joan still offer
their charming classic dances.

The chief of the husband’s “Grounds for
Divorce” at Sydney Hoyt’s this week is a
well-directed inkpot. Released from her
human target, the tempestuous dame takes
on a Count in his dotage, who soon neglects
her for his wireless experiments. Then the
lady hastens back to her old original and
is reinstated in his heart and will. It is one
of the week’s successes. The intriguing
theme of “The Crimson Runner” at the
Lyceum is the decline of Austria from pre-
war opulence to present-day poverty. “Scara-
mouche” still fills the Prince Edward, and
Charlie Chaplin is shortly to replace “The
Storming of Zeebrugge’ r at the Crystal
Palace.
** * *
The Nellie Bramley co. has been frivolous
at Adelaide Royal. “Fair and Warmer”
gave the lady and Arthur Cornell a chance
for some clever low comedy. “Charley’s
Aunt” was a triumph for little Irvine, who
gives it a light touch. The old play draws
as well as ever, in spite of its soliloquies and
asides, and its unmectable demand for three
heroes looking 21 and three girls looking 18.
Also the lawyer (Cornell again) and the
college “scout” were made quite human in-
stead of the burlesques they sometimes have
been in the past. Iredale and Adele and
Crane sing well at the Garden Theatre,
where also the six Peaches continue to
economise in costumes, and the two Georges
(Gee and Welch) to draw the frequent
laugh. “Peter Pan,” Betty Bronson in the
name-part, is a steady draw at the York;
Wondergraph has a remai-kable dog as a
kind of ( Crown Prosecutor or “Silent
Accuser,” and West’s stages also some real
animals. The Prince of Wales’ has an
Australian gum-nuts panto.—for the very
young.
“Cagos”: An actress's marriage to a youth
whom a profession not distinguished for
modesty regards as a conceited fop was a
surprise to the lady’s colleagues; but there
was one approving remark. “They ought to
be happy,” an actor said, “seeing that they
have tastes in common. They are both iii
love with the same man.”
“Tops”: Young (N.S.W.), once Lambing
Flat, is suffering from the same complaint
as Zeno, the strong man, and wants to
change to Burragong—its present name it
derived from an old-time Governor. When
the circus with which Zeno travelled
stranded at Mud Hollow, it was found that
there were sufficient funds to pay fares to
Sydney for all but one member of the com-
pany, and, the tickets being handed out to
members in alphabetical order, poor Zeno
’suffered. When, footsore, he arrived in Syd-
ney, he found the manager, with coffers re-
plenished, preparing to make another ven-
ture. After some persuasion Zeno intimated
that he might accept another engagement.
“All right, then,” said the manager. “I’ll
add ‘Zeno’ to the bills.” “No blanky fear!”
roared the strong man. “I’m going to be
Ajax this time.”
“Coppertop”: The only occasion during the
war when a considerable number of Diggers
appeared on the stage in uniform was at
the New York Hippodrome in April, 1918.
A benefit having been arranged for wounded
Canadian soldiers, 200 Aussies paraded at.

“Anzac.” By way of encore we were brought
back to give an exhibition of what the
announcer referred to as “Australia’s national
call.” Then was it borne in on my mind
how few Australians really know how to
coo-ee.
“F.N.W.”: There is a theatrical order of
precedence almost as strict as that in the
diplomatic service. On a ship in the London
docks I attended a party given by the officers
to the feminine portion of a West End
revue. The ladies were announced something

lady”; “Miss Fairy Fieuclos, our third

fourth lady” were classified as “of our
company.” But the strict order of seniority
was shattered when a wealthy girl from the
back row of the chorus had to be appealed
to to give some stragglers a lift home in her
car. “Our” second and third ladies departed
at a .late hour by a fruit-van bound for

THE proteins of food are directly responsible for the growth of wool-fibre. Green grass contains between
2 and 3 per cent, digestible protein and dry grass approximately 1 per cent. Maize and oats contain
7.5 per cent, and 9.7 per cent, respectively, while MEGGITT’S PURE LINSEED SHEEP NUTS contain no
less than 30 per cent, digestible protein!
The yolk of wool is mainly “oil” and mineral matter. The Sheep Nuts are rich in both oil
and mineral salts.
Yolk is exuded by the sebaceous glands underlying the skin. Digestive troubles interfere with the
functioning of these glands—hence the harsh, dry wool of sheep suffering from balling up and impaction due
to dry grass or scrub.
The oil content of Meggitt’s Sheep Nuts overcomes all such derangements and ensures bloom and
condition in wool.
The aggregate results on wool-growth from feeding

It is natural that the P. & C. should stand behind the man on the land; the company is controlled

It is also natural that the hroducer should have implicit confidence in this, his own, company.

“C. 8.”: Arthur Styan was a sound, ex-
perienced mummer w r hen Harry Rickards
brought him from London to play in "The
Squire of Dames,” and he added to his
accomplishments in Australia, where he
learned to dance a bit. An element of pathos
attached to one of his last appearances; as
the old General in “The Pelican” in Mel-
bourne w'ith Muriel Starr last year he had
to simulate paralysis at a time w r hen real
paralysis wms creeping on him.
“Amity”: When “The Ten Command-
ments” film struck a Maoriland towrn a
venerable gentleman got up as Moses went
careering through the place in a golden
chariot, in company w'ith two impressive-
looking tablets of stone. The local showT-
man reckoned it a first-class ad., but
changed his mind when he saw the patriarch
exhibit the usual signs of excessive hospitality.
Driving his chariot at a reckless speed and
shouting hilariously, Moses crashed into a
lamp-post, and it was a dazed and chastened
prophet who was picked out of the mix-up
of chariot, horses, tablets and scarlet robes.
A matter-of-fact magistrate made it £2 and
costs, explaining that since Mo’s day it had
been found necessary to add a few com-
mandments concerning motor-traffic and
malt liquor to the original ten.
“Caul-boy”: The stage-notes obligingly
furnished by Melbourne theatrical firms
sometimes contain, amidst the artless little
stories about footlight favorites, bits of un-
conscious humor. A recent broadside relates
that the unusual hobby of a pan So.-lady is
“bird-collecting” !
“St. John’s” (Lond.) : There is no better
actress in England than Edith Evans. In
the West End theatres she can always com-
mand star parts with corresponding financial
reward. But for some time past she lias
been a voluntary and delighted exile from
that paradise of the stage celebrity, and has
been “learning Shakspeare” at the Old Vic.,
where the prices of admission range from
ss. maximum to sd. minimum. Not only
that, but in the November production of
“Measure for Measure” she elected to play
the very small part of Mariana. Yet the
critic of the Daily News said: “It is worth
a visit to the old Vic., if only to watch Edith
Evans’s acting in the silent scene with Isa-
bella in the garden.”
“S.W.H.”: In the past decade many Aus-
tralian music-hall people have been crowded
out of their owm theatres by importations from
the U-S.A.. but a counter-movement is now 7
in progress. Con Coleano, called “the Wizard
on the Wire,” has recently made a genuine
hit at the New York Hippodrome. The
Three Aussies (otherwise Ross, Barker and
McLennan) are doing extremely well on the
Keith circuit. They are jazz musicians who
were discovered in a Melbourne dance-hall
and graduated thence to the Tivoli. The
Eclair Twins have also made good in New 7
York with a dancing act. They have their
own jazz band, and are approaching the
Rolls-Royce stage of vaudeville affluence.
“Hamfat”: A lady who has returned to
the boards after half a lifetime’s absence
has a better excuse, than the young woman
<»f whom it is said, “She can’t act, of course,
but she is so good to her mother.” In her
youth she was fairly popular in ingenue
parts, and, quitting the stage on marriage,
she returned 35 years later to play old
women in bushwhacking companies. Her
husband and her only daughter ai-e dead, and
her salary, supplemented by a small income
from her husband’s estate, enables her to
keep four grandchildren at good Schools. Not
much of an actress, perhaps, but a mighty
good heroine—how good can only be appre-
ciated by those who know the hardships of
bushwhacking.
“A.G.M. (Lond.) : At the Blayliouse on
the evening of Queen Alexandra’s death
Madge Titheradge was billed to appear in
“A Doll’s House.” She had never seen any
Ibsen plays performed, so the conditions
were not favorable to an artist notoriously
nervous about her w’ork. The unexpected
news of the Queen's death, which was only
published just as the public was on its
way to the theatres, seemed to have plunged
the audience into a state of listlessness, and
Miss Titheradge has confessed that the earlier
scenes were the most trying ordeal of her
career. She was on the point of collapse
when the amusing dialogue ip the middle of
the first act pierced the apathy of the audi-
ence, and its ready laughter relieved the ten-
sion. But the trial had been severe, and later
on, after the big emotional scene, the over-
wrought actress fainted in her dressing-room.
And now r London is talking about her Nora.
James Agate, in paying Miss' Titheradge a
splendid tribute, recalled another Nora wdiom
Australians were privileged to see. “Up to
Friday night the best Nora of my recollec-
tion had been Janet Achurch. But that
was only because Janet was a great woman
who would have shaken the spheres by merely
reciting Little Bo Peep.” Madge Tith-
oradge’s performance was simple and sure,
and she charged her work with a strength
and significance that electrified the house.
Australia may well be proud of Madge
Titheradge!
“St. John’s” (Lond.) : The theatrical
thrill of the year has been the first produc-
tion in London of Sean O’Casey’s Irish
drama “Juno and the Paycock.” It was
given at the Royalty, and if unbounded ap-
plause and wonderful criticisms can make a
great success of a great play, then Sean
O’Casey’s fame and fortune should be secure.
He is still a young man. His first essay
at wage-earning w r as as a shop-boy. Since
then he has been navvy. transport-worker
and latterly bricklayer. When he sent his
first play to the Abbey Theatre, it was so
crudely written that Lady Gregory. W. B.
Yeats and Lennox Robinson could hardly
read it. but they quickly discerned its mer
rits. Now’ London has endorsed their ver-
dict. and there is great curiosity as to
O’Casey’s new work, which the Abbey tri-
umvirate declare to be superior to his pre-
vious efforts. The title is an excellent one
-—“The Plough and the Stars.” His first
play w r as “The Shadow 7 of a Gunman.” In
all three he has introduced his own friends
—in several instances without even altering
their names.
“Kaminyah”: Dorothy Seacombe had an
unusual experience while playing in “Just
Married.” In one act Dorothy had to leap
out of bed suddenly, and by some mischance
her pyjama trousers did not quite leap with
her. The audience voted the innovation a
great success, but it was not repeated.
“Goldilocks”: Poor Arthur Styan had
tragedy hanging over his head for many
months before the end. The illness which
came upon him jangled his nerves so badly
that at his last appearance at the Melbourne
King’s he “fluffed" his lines —a happening
amazing in so competent an actor. He
broke down completely while rehearsing for
the next piece. Be-
fore “natural” act-
ing had become as
much an affecta-
tion as (and more
insipid than) the
posturings of old-
time mummers,
Styan put natural-
ness into every-
thing he did. The
Australian theatre
will miss the easy-
going, life-loving,
fine-iooking fellow
whose purse was
always at the dis-
posal of fellow-
players down on
their luck.
The late ARTHUR
STYAN, as the
stricken General
Sir John Heriot,
Bart., in “The
Pelican —the last
part he played.
"Royelia” : “The Farmer’s Wife,” now at
the Sydney Palace, travelled around man-
agers’ offices for 12 years before the London
production. After it had peregrinated
through the post for a year, Edmund Gwenn
accepted it for the Vaudeville, but his direc-
tors decided against it. Four years later
Albert Drinkwater produced it for Barry
Jackson at the Birmingham Repertory
Theatre, the date being November 11, 1916.
There the play had a successful run, but
somehow London’s interest was not aroused.
Then 11. B. Irving agreed to put it on at
his theatre, the Savoy, but rejected it jifter
much pondering because he considered him-
self incapable, honest man, of playing the
role of Farmer Sweetland. The next offer
came from the Kingsway. Brit the terms
were unsatisfactory to Pliillpotts. and the
play w r as once again in the air. It remained
for Barry Jackson to remove it from his
Repertory house to the London Court
Theatre on March 11, 1924. immediately fol-
lowing his production of Shaw’s “Back to
Methuselah.” Although the critics praised
it heartily, the public was shy. Still, Jack-
son kept going, and after the thing had run
for a year London definitely decided that it
was worth looking at.
“Blum”: The final proof of the divorce
of Hollywood from any sense of artistic fit-
ness is the casting of a young woman for the
part of Peter Pan. As a rule I have no
objection to the leading lady wearing trou-
sers or displaying her charms any old way
she chooses. The wearing of male duds by
a female has been a well-known artifice for
emphasising sex ever since the days of Shaks-
peare and his low associates, and nearly all
plays, film or otherwise, depend upon sex for
A MATTER OF COMPARISONS.
DOLLY : “I don't know where you got the idea that young Softleigk
is rich.”
MADGE : "I never had it. What I said was that he had more money

their point. An exception, however, should
have been made in the case of Barrie’s deli-
cate conception, the appeal of which is to
memories of a childhood in which, as in
Heaven, there is no thought of marrying
or giving in marriage. The defence, of
course, will be that no boy could be found
intelligent enough and at the same time look
the age, whereas by stage and film conven-
tion a woman of 25 —or 55 —can represent
a boy of 10. But for quite a long while in
the history of the English stage female parts
Were played by boys and men, and that is
the custom in Japan to this day, so the ques-
tion of intelligence need not be raised. To
raise it in connection with Hollywood would
be futile, anyhow.
“Wallaby”: “Seen you at the pitchers th'
other evenin’,” our washerwoman began, in
that confidential tone of hers. “Y’ought t’ go
again t’-morra night—l’m takin’ Gladys.
They’ve got that pitcher feaclierin’ Victor
’Ugo—‘The ’Unchback of the Motor
Drome’!”
“Quero”: I can tell about another ele-
phant that went on strike while the circus
was moving (B. 1.7/12/’25). It was when
Wirths' arrived in a M.L. tow r n on one of its
periodic visits. The huge pachyderm was
being taken back to the w'harf for another
load, W'hen he suddenly seated himself across
a double set of tramlines in a busy thorough-
fare with the air of one who intends to have
a restful afternoon. Ignoring the threats
and cajoleries of his keeper, the noisy atten-
tions of the crowd and the gentle bumps of
the held-up trams, he continued to occupy the
middle of the road apparently wrapped in
profound meditation. Small boys regaled
him with buns and bananas, and camera
fiends snapped him at close quarters while
he continued his stop-work tactics. Trams
were announced as running “as far as the
elephant,” where passengers alighted and
walked round him as they would round a
landslide, catching another car on the other
side. Just as the police w r erc considering
gelignite as a remover, the lions’ cage went
past in the tow of a lorry. This galvanised
the striker into action; he rose, shook him-
self, declared the circus and all its connec-
tions wdiite again, and thudded off for his
next load.
“Woorook”: The late John Cosgrove took
an, aesthetic delight in raising loans-in-
perpetuity. It was not so much impecuni-
osity sts a hobby, the pride of achievement,
and his methods of approach "were disarming.
On first meeting him I said conventionally:
“Delighted to meet you, Mr. Cosgrove.”
“Not Mr. Cosgrove to you.” he protested.
‘Call me ‘Skeeter.’” I looked at his gene-
rous rotundity, and replied that I did not
see the point. “No," he rejoined with an
ingratiating smile, “but you will when I
sting you.” And I did.
“Ta Liu Shie”: A little thing may spoil
a show. Some years back, at the time
of the Christchurch (M.L.) Exhibition,
a troupe of Fijians were doing the “fire
walking” stunt. When the stones were all
in readiness for the show to begin a bare-
footed urchin of about 10 darted out of the
audience, and before the natives had time
to get over their astonishment had completed
the course of “red-hot” stones, and was leg-
ging it for sanctuary, with a stream of
Brown Brother plus a cloud of language on
his track. The takings thereafter were
simply horrible.
“Philm Up": The Lang Government’s 25
p.c. tax on the N.S.W. profits of American
film proprietors raised howls of protest from
iho Australian end of the “industry” as a
matter of course. The "industry,” it was
alleged, w r ould be
“crippled,” “stifled”
and otherwise done
to death. “It is a
mistake to think
that huge profits
are being made,”
one gentleman com-
plained ; “the ‘in-
dustry’ is not in
the solid position
it is stated to be.”
Unhappily this
wrnil w r as printed
alongside an inter-
view with Dan
Carroll, who had
just returned from
a trip to the U.S.A.
on picture business,
and who reported
that money was
being “poured into
American cinema
enterprises the
film industry is the
pet child of Ameri-
can financiers.” Do
American finan-
ciers, 60 per cent,
of whom are of
Jewish' extraction,
pour their money ■
into concerns that
are not in a solid
position ? Wei 1,
not so’s you’d notice it.
“Hamfat” : My old t lies pi an friend Augus-
tus Borrows dropped into Melbourne the
other day, looking as tour-battered as ever;
and his enthusiasm about a motor-cycle and
side-car as an adjunct to the touring show
led me to probe till I got the story of Cow
Plat from him. The season had gone badly;
but Borrows cheerfully announced an extra
night, and issued free invitations to all
creditors who seemed anxious about their
money—they could see the show first and
get their money afterwards. Act 111 en-
gaged only three characters, one of wdiom
finished early, leaving two to hold the fort.
After the curtain descended on the third act
there was a long, long wait until the audi-
ence, tired of merely making a noise, started
to make inquiries, and found it had been
sitting in a hall deserted by the actors. The
main body of the co. had caught a “mixed”
train passing through; the two Horatios
had inade their escape on the motor-cycle
and side-car, and joined the train at the next
stopping-place. I remarked upon what the
feelings of the audience must have been at
the desertion. “Serves them right!” said
Borrows; “they were nearly all creditors—•
curse them!”
“Pond”: An entirely new kind of “pub-
licity” is being w'orked for Mercia Gregori,
lately doing dramatic recitations at the Coli-
seum and Lyceum. The story is that Mer-
cia’s histrionic talent was first shown in a
convent entertainment when she was a nun
in S’Africa, and that on her representing
that she had mistaken her calling a Papal
dispensation was granted for her to go on
the stage. The R.C. Universe declares that
her withdrawal before the final vows was a
“perfectly regular action”; in fact, “such a
case, in which a mistake is found out after
profession and is rectified, knocks the bottom
out of a whole class of vulgar libels”—of
the Joseph Hocking romance kind, presum-
ably.
“Caesar's Ghost”: “The Black Flag,” good
old standby of former travelling shows, feeds
the juvenile with a number of good, meaty
lines; but a stiff thespian (he now stamps
the boards in the cause of villainy) found
one of them his undoing. He had been bear-
ing the reproaches of an annoyed parent
who had compared his behavior with that
of his brother, and, with chest expanded,
he blared liis great speech : “No! Give me
the blue heavens with the sun streaming
down upon my head ! Let Jack be the gentle-
man ; the honest dignity of labor is good
enough for me!” Before the applause could
come, a rough citizen hurled this from the
front chairs: “Well, who's stoppin’ you? Go
and get work!”

Dear Sirs, —
I have been driving my “Crossley” Car, 15/30 H.P.,
for 12 months, and have covered 10,000 miles on all
classes of l-oads.
During that time I have travelled through South
Australia, New South Wales and Victoria on private
and official business, and up till now I have not had
occasion to take a tool out of the case nor been held
up through engine or tyre trouble.
It will interest you to know that on the South
Australian trip I covered 1500 miles, carefully check-
ing and measuring the petrol, and I averaged for the
total distance 29 miles to the gallon; on one section,
from Melbourne to Hamilton, 200 miles, I averaged
32 miles per gallon.
I have only just arrived from Melbourne, and I feel
sure you will be pleased to know we had no trouble of
any sort, and the engine is still running beautifully.
Yours faithfully,
H. W. .TAMES,
President of the National Roads Association,
Melbourne.

Dear Sirs, —
It gives me pleasure to subscribe to the general
efficiency and all-round dependability of the 15/80
11. P. “Crosslcy.”
As you know, it is 15 months since this firm first
purchased a “Crossley” Car, and it was not until this
car had been on, the road continuously for 12 months
that we had it overhauled.
There wore no mechanical defects, and it was the
condition of this car that decided us to standardise
on Crossleys throughout.
The new model appears to be even superior to last
year’s, and if we get the same service from the new
cars that we obtained from the old one w T e shall be
very satisfied.
Yours faithfully,
ARTHUR RICKARD & CO., LTD.,

Dear Sirs,— . „
1 have pleasure in giving you my experience ot our
15/30 lI.P. Model “Crosslfcy” Car. .
I fiixl after two years' d kily use, during which penoil
I have covered a distance <>f slightly over o(),000 miles,
that the car is just as gc od as when first purchased.
During the period mentio. led repairs have been prac-
tically nil.

consider it remarkab* for h <*ir ot its size. A test
of this kind is. in my mi|id, the only one ot any
benefit to the ordinary user.* ...
Anyone needing a reliablefand comfortable car. with
plenty of speed, economical [as to petrol and tyres and
repairs, will find vour 15/110 much cheaper, in spite
of the slightly greater first obst, than most of the much-
boosted cheaper cars on tlie Australian market; at
any rate, such is my expei pence—-in short, I consider
the car worthy of the rep fetation of the world-famed
Crosslev Firm". Yours* faithfully,

Electric Transportation
PEOPLES and nations develop and expand as their
transportation facilities improve, hecause it is upon
these facilities that trade and commerce depend. Africa
is no longer the “Dark Continent”; transportation has
checkered her wilds and jungles with the paths of progress
and human intercourse.
In this development and growth of nations, electricity has
played a conspicuous part Through its various applica-
tions, a tremendous stride has been taken in advancing
the whole world’s civilization
Today, everywhere, throughout the world, the electric
motors of the International General Electric Company
transport life, trade and service from one point to another.
Whether it be the electric locomotive pulling trains over
towering mountain ranges, the electric “mule” dragging
ore cars up from the depths of busy mines, or the electric
truck carrying urgent loads about industrial plants, the
electric motor is the propelling heart of modern trans-
portation.
Such is the service that the local rep-
resentatives of the International Gen -
eral Electric Company can render you «

Kildare: The Henry Lawson Fund is still
open. The total in the hands of the committee is
between £2300 and £2400 Jessie U.: See if you
can’t strengthen the ending of it M.E.8.: The last
figures available (1923) show that it cost £B6 18s. 6d.
p.a. per patient at the Greenvale (Vic.) sanatorium
for consumptives. The average cost of a patient in
the Melbourne General Hospitals for the same year
"as £l5O 12s. lid. But the latter figure includes
the cost of treating outpatients—cost of inpatients
and outpatients is rot kept separate... .Relata: The
story was told by Jerome 30 years ago. He prob-
ably invented it Baro: Room for only one re-
joinder; and that is in print G. 0.5.: Same here.
. ...Velia E. : Didn’t quite persuade us that it might
be true Typoff: First rate V.S.C.Alreadv
reviewed at great length Ripponlea: There is
something very human about the refrain:
Comes from mine larnyx an agonised mutt’r
As 1 manipulate ovei a, gutt’r;
Appearing to walk as though hamper’d by hobble'-,
Horne ward 1 tread over kerbstones and cobbles,
it isn t so bad with your sox or your shirt •
But when shoes don’t fit very often they hurt.
M hen th W orld sleeps and the moon shines, my face
Suffused with a smile as I undo the laces;
then in an heaven of heartsease and footsease
I take oft my shoes and 1 wriggle my tootsies,
its a different thing with your undies or skirts.
But when shoes don’t fit they bally well hurt.
.. ..C.W.P.; There may be “nothing like the light
at night to stir the halting bard,” but in spite of the
stirring the lines continue to halt... .H.J.H • Thev
don't say enough.... I.D. (East Melb.): Some of it
still limps; and the lines and ideas are not strong
enough to carry technical faults. .. .A.M. (Vaucluse) :
They say the old things in a familiar way....
T.McC.: Not up by some distance... .Precocious
Percy; Not. much good in that form H.C.S.: The
Double about it is that all those nicely arranged
rhymes fail to say anything Milou: A bit too
rugged... .A.J.8.: Moves very heavily. .. .T.O’R,: The
verse is weak and full of bumps Gladys B.: That
story has been told too often with minor variations.
....P. O. Mat.: Not very convincing and still less
exciting... .G.L.: The picture is tall and striking:—
Be he Jew or Gentile or man from Spain,
He treats them all with a fine disdain •
His brawny arm and mighty chest
Gave account of them all, when at his best.
But now forsooth he’s seventy-two
And time’s a vixen and a shrew;
Still kindly breaks the news to him
Of shortening years and glories dim.
Much strength as of yore his frame retains,
His intellect is not in chains.
Is kindly, just and generous;
In fact, just like a one of us.
Long may he live till the great come-hither
Finds him straight and true, without any blither,
As a man who did his level best
Steadfast and upright to the final test.
.... Trevdee: The verse is lame and the matter not
exciting... .Edie: The last line is good; try to
improve the rest Plodder: Both too weak
8.R.R.: No use sending us blank verse built up of
commonplaces E.G.U.: You must get a better idea
of what verse is, and that can only come from
study.... H,D. (Norman Park): The intentions are
good but the lines are bad....E.L. (Croydon): A
confused sort of lament or paean or whatever it may'
be... .N.0.T.: Doesn’t get near... .D.P.M.: The
yarn does not make good Old C.: The verse is
very ragged and all it tries to say has been written
to death. ...E.J.0.: The pictures are too confused....
J.R.L.: Shocking... .I.W. (Jolimont) : The last stanza
spoils “The Subconscious”... .F.K.8.: Lame and
awkward.... Fly Low: The matter is hardly a subject
for verse; but that is no reason why the verse
should skip and jump like that....M.F. (North
Sydney): Stuff without a pulse of life in it....
....Alice J.: The story doesn’t appeal to u 5....
E.T.S.: If you made a careful comparison over a
period of years you would find that your criticism
is wrong. The complaint of gloom was the usual
one 25 years ago; the brightening has been
recent... .M.H.H.: Joan is not much in our line....
The Flat: The most remarkable piece of verse we
have met this mellow Christmastide:—
Mary Gray rode in a handicap one day
On a grey mare called Dollie Gray,
By a grey moke called Father Gray
From a station grey mare Granny Gray,
Owned by old skinny Jimmy Gray,
But no relation to Mary Gray.
Dollie Gray was trained by John Gray,
Out on the Graystone Station track;
Mary Gray won on Dollie Gray.
“By a head” the judge did say—
He was old James Danny Gray,
Twin brother to old Johnny Gray.
.... Desist: An appropriate pen-name for humor of
that sort... .D.J.M.H.: Some of the matter is good;
but it is too diffuse for The B. A paper that has to
cover a whole continent once a week must make its
points by the direct route.... V.D.A.: You’re wrong.
“Temsee” isn’t that sort of man at a 11... .James: There
is no clear line between the dark-blooded peoples and
the others; at the worst, those you mention are
only on the fence.... Clerk: The break-of-gauge
problem has been stated often enough. What we
want to hear is a practicable solution.... J.K.R.: It’s
all a question of space. The best we can do is
to print the most interesting things that offer....
W.L.8.; There’s more that is true than untrue in
Phillips’s Daily Mail article; and with the sugges-
tion that he shouldn’t have written it because he
was a “guest” this paper has no sympathy at a 11....
Kelder: Too loosely thrown together E.B.
(Katoomba); Yes, all as clear as daylight. But
what do you propose to do about it?... .L.V.H.:
Not much interest in it A.A.K.: Well enough
written; but they weren’t quite as casual as all
that in those days E.J.0.: The vein has been
worked out M.W.; You try to cover too much
ground, and so hardly scratch the surface anywhere.
.... Dogsfoot: Your rhymes are very terrible
T.H.S.; Nothing fresh there Manch: We’ve got a
plough in that field ourselves.

Only two Manufacturers
offer “One-Profit”
Unit-Built Values
ONLY two manufacturers actually build their cars
complete make all their own bodies, engines,
clutches, springs, gear boxes, differentials, steering gears,
axles, gray iron castings and drop forgings.
One is Ford, The other is Studebaker.
To make this possible, Studebaker has for many years
invested more than half of its earnings in new and finer
factory building and in the most modern, most efficient
machinery and equipment. Because of its policy, re-
sources amounting to more than £20,000,000 have been
built up and devoted exclusively to the production of
Studebakers,
This One-Profit principle of manufacture makes
possible four great advantages:
1. It eliminates the extra pro-
fits and overhead that many
other manufacturers have to
pay and include in the purchase
price to you. This keeps Stude-
baker prices low.
2. Because of the One-Profit
savings, Studebaker is able to
offer you a sturdier, more sub-
stantially built automobile. We
pay a premium for the finest
steels. We use hard wood in
body construction. Throughout
the entire car —in hundreds of
hidden places you find the
same high quality of materials
and workmanship that you see
out in the open.
3. It makes possible finer
quality because Studebaker, be-
ing an independent manufac-
turer, with no subsidiary or allied
companies to favor, is free to
buy on the open market, de-
manding the finest materials at
the lowest possible price. Stude-
baker purchasing agents are un-
restricted in their search for
quality and value.
4. And, finally, it enables us
to build a better car because the
vital parts are designed, engi-
neered and manufactured com-
plete by one organization. Be-
ing built as v a unit—Studebaker
cars function as a unit, with all
of the advantages of unit over
assembled construction.
Studebaker Standard Six Duplex-Phaeton (illustrated)
is a splendid example of One-Profit values. It has the
most powerful engine of any car in the world of its
weight and size; Duplex body, an exclusive Studebaker
feature; full size balloon tyres, genuine Spanish grained
leather upholstery; instruments, including an 8-day
clock grouped in an oval panel under glass; light con-
trol on the steering wheel and many other desirable
features.

“Petrie”: Brisbane City Council is not
opposed to cremation provided it is not asked
for any money. It has informed the Sydney
Cremation Society that it is willing to
devote a small area of public land near one
of the cemeteries for the purpose of a cre-
matorium, provided the society will erect the
building and finance the proposition. It is
not likely that this offer will be accepted, so
Brisbane will have to wait until private
donations or bequests provide funds for in-
troducing this cleanly method of disposing of
the dead.

“A. 11.” : The box of matches before me
looks Australian enough; five-sixths of the
cover is occupied by a brace of kookaburras
sitting on a bough. Certainly the birds re-
flect no great credit on the artist, but still
they are recognisable; and as an added pre-
caution their aboriginal and English name
appears above their presentments. Stowed
away at the bottom is a line mentioning that.,
the matches were “made in Sweden.” Is
there no territorial property in trade-marks
like these?
* * * #
“Iveppel”: A distillery is being erected at
Sarina, near Mackay (Q.), where power
alcohol will be manufactured principally from
cassava, arrowroot, sweet potatoes and waste
molasses. Five hundred tons of machinery
recently arrived from France. Cassava will
be the main source, and 300 acres have been
planted with cuttings obtained from Java.
The cuttings planted were specially selected
varieties secured from the Government breed-
ing station at Buitenzorg, and a strike of
99 per cent, seems proof positive of the
fitness of the soil. Cassava is a splendid
drought resister.
* *• * «
“Sandhurst” : The Beehive Exchange, the
hub of Bendigo, has been sold by the trustees
of the late James Buick for £56,000. It
covers nearly an acre and faces two streets.
James Buick, a draper, was a partner of the
late Andrew Lyell in 1870 when the Beehive
was brought from Francis Brothers, store-
keepers. Other well-known Victorians asso-
ciated with Buick were the late L. G.
Christie, J. Langlands, Thos. Henderson and
J. R. Goodisson. The original Beehive was
burnt down in 1871. The Stock Exchange
always had its habitat there, and in the boom
of 18J1-73 it was nearly impossible to get
into the vestibule when the gold yields were
posted on Saturday nights. There were
then 200 mines open and 100 producing
gold.
* * * «
“Currabeena” : The “Old Barn” at Mosman
(N.S.YV.), once used as a store by Archibald
Mossman and now likely to be brought by
subscription and given to the Boy Scouts, is
almost invariably described as a relic of the
early days of whaling—which it isn’t. Aus-
tralian whaling was well iuto its middle
stage when Mossman began operations
about IS3O on the north side of Port Jack-
son. Whaling out of Sydney (as distinct
from whaling on the Australian coast by
British vessels which merely made Sydney
a port of call) goes back to ISOS ; whaling
off the coast of N. S. Wales was first tried
in 1791. The business developed very rapidly,
and by 1830 it had almost if not quite
attained its maximum. In the late ’thirties
it began to decline, and by 1850 it was a
back number as far as Sydney was concerned,
though Hobart Town hung on for a while
longer.
* * * *
“Avon”: The Union Steamship Co. of
N.Z. completed its half-century this year.
It was formed in Dunedin in 1575, and took
over the fleet of the Otago Harbor S. N. Co.,
which had been founded by one Johnny Jones.
The trustee for the Jones estate at the time
of the absorption was James Mills, and he
became manager of the new venture, which
had a paid-up capital of £119.170. The com-
pany’s first passenger-ships were the Hawea
and Taupo, built in Britain. In 1878 the
concern took over part of the shipping busi-
ness of McMeckan, Blackwood and Co., of
Melbourne, another part going to the Adel-
aide S.S. Co. One of the Union Co.’s star
ships was the old Rotomaliana, built in
Peter Denny's shipyard at Dumbarton, the
first steel steamer launched. The Union Co.
is nowadays a joint in the P. and O.’s back-
bone.
* * * •
“Adamascus”: Present-day title-deeds to
real property are inscribed on a paper com-
position which only remotely resembles
parchment; the cost of real sheepskin grew
too high a fcW years ago and the substitute
displaced it. The genuine article, though
more enduring, had its disadvantages. At
the time of the big Clermont (Q.) flood in
1918 all the local banks were submerged and
most of their documents ruined. The sheep-
skin deeds stood the water well, but their
smell after being soaked was indescribable.
For months after the flood deeds from Cler-
mont came pouring into the Title Office at
Rockhampton until it smelt like a hide-and-
skin store. The staff was thinking of getting
up a petition about it when the supply
ceased. A stray one still turns up, to meet
with universal disapprobation.
* * * «
“Loco”: A re-numbering of the engines is
in progress in the Vic. railways. The idea
is to have all the classes in consecutive
order. O iginally passenger engines carried
even numbers and goods engines odd ones;
now odd and even numbers are used indis-
criminately—as also, generally, are the
engines. It is somewhat disconcerting to go
off your pet “531Dd” one trip and come on
next day to find it labelled “557.” Some
years ago. when it was decided to call the
State schools by their town names in prefer-
ence to numbers, it was urged that there was
no sentiment in mere figures. But I am not
so sure of that. A loco, with any other
number will pull as well, no doubt; but older
enginemen will always associate their fellows
with certain engine numbers. By the way,
the old English custom of mounting early
types of locomotives on prominent sites at
central stations might well be followed in
Australia. It would be interesting for
travellers to see and compare the locos, of
former days with the present giants.

Like Bailey of the A.W.U., lus predecessor
in the representation of GouJburn, Sydney
Lord Mayor Stokes has become the N.S.W.
Assembly’s silent member. He made his first
speech on the bill to amalgamate municipal
Sydney and Waterloo, and then he had to be
baited into it by the acrid Bavin. His few
remarks were to the effect that the Oppo-
sition were cows.
“H. 8.” : Religious differences work out all
right sometimes. In the Bordertown district
of S.A. two small cockies co-operated to buy
a binder. One of them is a Seventh Day
Adventist and the other a plain Presby-
terian ; so the machine works seven days
a week —the Presbyterian has the free run
of it on Saturdays and the Seventh Day
Adventist on Sundays.
Acting-Justice Weigall, who has already
served two years on Vic.’s Supreme Court
bench, while Irvine and Scliutt successively
were abroad, will continue there for another
year. This time he will relieve Justice Cus-
sen, who is to consolidate the Statutes, as
he did 10 years Weigall was offered a
permanent bench job some time ago, but de-
clined ; that was when Macfarlan, J., was
selected.
D. Brims, of Cundle Flat, near Wingham,
on the N.S.W. North Coast, is a hardy
pioneer. Born on the Barnard River. Upper
Manning, 72 years ago, he still seldom misses
a dance held within ten miles of his home.
His wife is 77 years young, can jump on a
good horse and yard stock with the best.
Fifty-two years ago these old hands were
married in Taree, and they have fought life’s
battle on the one property ever since.
“Hamer”: Christ Church, Geelong, cele-
brated its 82nd anniversary on a recent Sun-
day with a deal of spirit; but the distinction
of being Vic.’s most ancient tabernacle be-
longs to St. James’s Old Cathedral, West
Melbourne. Here it was that a small wooden
building first provided the religious and
those who were forced to go to church with
a place of worship as long ago as November,
1838 —right at the beginning of things. The
next year the foundation-stone of the present
sanctuary was laid; and the church was
opened on October 4, 1842. Bishop Brough-
ton confirmed SO persons there the following
year. The tower was not added until a few
years later, and the bells were installed in
1852.
An old acquaintance, H. H. Sir Ibrahim,
G.C.M.G., K.8.E., D.K., S.P.M.J., Sultan of
Johorc, celebrated his 52nd birthday and
the 30th year of his reign with pomp the
other day. He was the handsome buck-
Malay who came to Australia in the glow
of his youth with diamonds in his teeth,
charmed the race-going public by his love
of sport, and returned to his jungle-covered
State with a bevy of Australian girls who
were listed as stenographers to the imperial
astana. The Singapore Government did not
concur in the Sultan’s estimate of hia busi-
ness needs, and turned the ladies back. At
one time a familiar but far from welcome
figure in the clubs of Singapore, the pic-
turesque potentate, whose main revenue be-
fore the rubber boom was derived from
Chinese gambling-farms, later settled down
to the humdrum job of managing his large
estate. His sultanate is now one of the
most prosperous and well-developed in the
archipelago.
“Kerys”: The recently-retired permanent
head of a Government agricultural depart-
ment was an expert in his calling, and suf-
fered fools wratlifully; so when a Labor
M.P. appeared one day and asked what the
prospects were of his aged father-in-law,
who knew nothing of horticulture, obtain-
ing a job as a gardener, the reply was not
encouraging. The M.P. became insistent and
even threatened the expert; but as the latter
discovered that the ancient job-seeker had
left a mental hospital to look for light and
lucrative employment, he stood firm. Matters
had reached the deadlock stage when the old
gentleman, apparently upset by the pros-
pect of work, again qualified for admission
to the asylum. Ilis hasty removal simplified
things somewhat, but the expert breathed
relievedly when he saw the last of the Labor
chief.
“Clerk”: With 43 years’ service to his
credit, stationmaster Stanistreet, who has
lately been roaring up the porters at Dande-
nong (Vic.), calls it a fair thing and begins
keeping the wolf from the door with his
pension. A typical railwayman of the old
pre-Clapp school, he has been in charge of
all the larger stations in Victoria and was
for some time district superintendent.
Rumor declares him the original of the time-
honored yarn concerning the short-tempered
traveller who, after stamping wildly up and
down a country platform waiting for a train
already half an hour late, finally strode up
to the booking window and banged the wire
ferociously with his walking-stick. “Why the
blanky blazes don’t your something trains
run to time?” he stormed as soon as a face
appeared at the other side of the window.
“What the blanky blazes would be the good
of having waiting-rooms if they did?” asked
the face.
A recent volume of reminiscences by an
ex-Speaker of the Commons tells a quaint
story of a man who afterwards figured in
Westralia. He was a barrister, known in
the ’eighties as “Blocker” Warton— he
blocked all blockable bills on principle.
Aching for a seat in the Commons, lie went
down to Bridport in Dorset, where his
chances seemed hardly worth considering.
After making a speech or two he was taken
ill, or professed to be so taken. He regarded
himself as being so bad that he not only
summoned all the local doctors, but requisi-
tioned the services of a local lawyer to make
his will. And by the latter document most
of the candidate’s property was left to
Bridport charities. The attorney was gar-
rulous, the story got out, and the candidate,
invalided but slowly mending, found himseif
the most popular man in the constituency
before polling-day. He was returned trium-
phantly and never set foot in Bridport
again. Australia’s interest in Warton carnet
later; probably to get rid of him, the Glad-
stone Ministry offered him the Attorney-
Generalship of W.A., then a Crown colony,
and he held the job till Groperland secured
responsible government in 1800, when he
retired on a pension, like all other Imperial
officers. He wasn’t much more popular in
Perth than in Bridport—after Bridport had
discovered how it had been tricked.

“Rexona
for Health
and
Beauty”
Miss GWEN HARM-
STON, a beautiful
Rexona Girl, writes:
“I have used Rexona
Soap all my life and
have recommended it
to all my girl friends
Why Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion ?
You cannot it you do not care for he delicate skin of the face. When you wash your
face, do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the dirt,, but that, your skin
needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from blemish ?
Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as you are
well aware. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy
its delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the skin, but
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap Is not only an absolutely pure soap, but is medicated on the
same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment, which is famous throughout all of Australasia
as the Rapid Heeler. That is why Rexona Soap really does for the skin and face what cos-
metics are supposed to do, by ensuring not only a clean face but a pure and healthy skin, and
thus gives you a clear complexion.

Unrest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rri HE salt, is ill my blood, alas, the salt
is in my blood;
JL I cannot live a settled life, I would not
if I could.
Around the Cape, around the Horn, around
the Leeuwiu cry
The Voices of the Seven Seas that I must
heed —or die.
With oxygen and hydrogen, with salt and
seeds of life
God made a man by slow degrees, and gave
the man a wife;
To air and water, salt and soul let homage
due be done,
But pack once more a rover’s kit and let
him venture on!
The Bush is burdened with its wealth of
golden wattle-bloom;
Clematis from the forest falls like linen from
a loom;
And Spring is weaving colored cloths in
floral patterns fair,
While roses from our gardens throw their
immemorial snare.
The hills of Nadgee—ne’er more blue than
they appear to-day—
Will ever wall our northern view; nor will
the sunlight lay
A brighter hand upon the lakes of Mallcoota,
where
My heart might linger were it not my soul
is otherwhere.
At dawn of day I wakened, and the magpies’
carol heard;
Then from the brushes answered back the
artful lyre-bird ;
The mating swallows chirruped low; a blue-
cap’s tuneful tongue
Proclaimed the ecstasy of life, and clownish
laughter flung
A kookaburra from a limb among the roofing
trees—
And still I heard, above it all, the droning
Tasman Seas,
The calling seas that eastward spread unto
the skyline far;
The highway of my soul’s unrest I fear in
sooth they are.
For flashing pictures straightway fell upon
white screens of thought—
The limelit films of other lands, that to
my vision brought
Green islands where, absolved from care,
brown natives idly hold
In little value all we prize of mastery or
gold.
Old lands that to the northward lie beyond
the Indies; there
The eyes of Asia from the Past unto the
Future stare—
Towards what conclusion who shall say
whose occidental minid
But view T s the present, and, last born, has left
not far behind
Its swaddling-clothes. From Asia, yes, what
glowing pictures rise
Of earven temples, narrow’ streets, dark faces,
almond-eyes,
Strange habits rooted deep in time; the old
eternal strife
Of human masses driven by the primal needs
of life!
“In nearer view you should behold,” the
tempting seas proclaimed,
“These ancient lands ere yet you die in
ignorance ashamed;
Dost know that now, aye, even now, as in
your bed you lie,
The cherries drop their autumn leaves ’neatb
Fujiama high?
“Dost know the godwits which have turned
on weary wings anon
Round Gabo left their feeding haunts a
fortnight but agone
Among the distant Kurile Isles ? O'h, laggard,
dozing so, •
’Twas but last week they saw the coasts of
mystic Borneo!”
A cock’rel in the fpwlyard crowed; in the
deep gully near
I heard a cooing wonga call unto his
feathered dear. ,
Your sleepy arm, my heart’s desire, in pre-
monition found
My restless neck, and like a vine, detaining,
softly wound!
With oxygen and hydrogen, wnth salt and
seeds of life
God made the man by slow degrees and gave
the man a wife,
But round the Cape and round the Horn and
round the Lceuwin cry
The Voices of the Seven Seas that I must
hear —or die !
Through Suez to the Isles of Gi'eece ’tis such
a little way;
From Joppa to Jerusalem, by motor-car, a
day;
From Athens round to Venice, then along
the Latin coast,
To Rome would be, the guide-books show, a
wonder-w T eek at most.
Oh, Satan Sea, behind me now, or else
(God’s help ! I I fall
And throw discretion to the winds and
maybe wreck it all!
I know, deal heart, ’twould spoil our plans
.... but plans of mice and men -
Oh, yes, I’ve been a rover and I’m gro,wing
old; but, then,
From Roma full around the Gib-el-Tariek
any man .
With, cash or courage in account has gone
and always can....
All right, and kiss .me, dear. Now rest your
laboring lie«rt at< ease,
I’ll stay at home another year and damn the
Seven Seas!
“We’re calling you, we're calling you, a rover
asking case!
We’re calling you, we're calling you (d’ you
hear?) the Seven Seas!
We’re calling you, icc’re calling you, oh,
pilgrim seeking rest,
Our love is greater than her love, we Maidens
of Unrest.”
Of oxygen and hydrogen, on His synoptic
scale,
With certain stable elements that never
change or fail,
God made the chemic Universe; the Universe
at least
Exists despite the startling tale the chemist
told the priest.
So pack again the kit, my love, and let your
man be gone.
Australia is the fairest land that e’er the
sun shone on;
But other lands might give us yet our faith-
ful hearts’ desire;
Yes, we may sit, in ripened age, before
another fire
And hear the Erse or English rain upon our
rooftree fall,
And laugh because, like those of mice, our
plans were nought at all.
Oh, Satan Sea, your subtle voice can make
my tongue to lie;
You know that l must out and go again or
I must die!
Well, count my collars! As you say, I need
some dress-shirts, dear,
And I’ll be back —with gifts, of course —
about the good New Year!
With oxygen and hydrogen, and with the salt
of life,
By slow degrees God made a man and gave
the man a wife.

The Bath of Venus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ERTIE,” said Lady Bannerman, the
Wy medieval chatelaine of Auchness-
brauchie station, modulating her
imperious voice almost to a whisper, “she
positively must be off by now. Listen!”
And Lady Bannerman and Miss Bertram,
her lienchwoman of the body and lady-in-
waiting, listened intently. Suddenly from
across the back of the courtyard where the
kitchen (the hostile territory and fiercely
impregnable fortress of Berenice the cook)
formed one of the separate station buildings,
there travelled through the sunlight and the
air a volley of little explosions which burst
as graciously as small snowballs against rlio
ears of the baronette and her faithful gentle-
woman. There could be no doubt about it,
she was off at last! That meant she was
safe for two hours at least; Berenice was
snoring! The ladies had determinedly
cleared the stage—the tense theatre of their
enterprise—for themselves.
The station-hands and their good dogs had
dispersed since the sunrise. The groom, who
was also the chauffeur and harrier-in-chief
of the stable-yard, had departed hours earlier
on Isabella, Lady Bannerman’s stout old
dowager of a hunter, to spend a whole day’s
furlough, like an officer from the Indian
Army, in Culverden. The buttons, divested
of his livery and clad in an orphaned suit
of Master Buckingham’s, had been packed off
in the mail-car to Christchurch on a sudden
visit to his maternal parent. This, of course,
was rather a wanton blow to his mother, but
then a woman who, after having brought
what Saint John calls a man-child into the
world, will in cold blood let him turn into
a buttons, clearly deserves no mercy from
Heaven.
“Bertie,” said Lady Bannerman, when
through the deserted passages the two ladies
had reached the bedroom, “you had better
undress me now, and I will massage quietly
while you mix the mud in the bath.”
“Very well, dearest Lady Ban.,” said the
peerless Bertram, already with her expert
hands drawing Lady B.’s skirt over her
head and manoeuvring it delicately around
tne dangerous regions of the Banner-
man toupee. Then bracing herself as brave
men take hold of the rope in a tug-of-war,
and finding a leverage for one foot against
the bedpost, she assaulted the top clasp of
her ladyship’s corsets. The gallant iron-
clads shivered, shook, but stood their ground.
“Wait, Bertie, while I stop breathing for
a minute, and do you yourself, my dear soul,
try to stop puffing.”
This time Miss Bertram, with Lady Ban-
nerman bringing hydraulic pressure to bear
in the basement, captured the citadel with
a violent rush—-in fact, she spun across the
room and fell against a distant window-
seat with the trophies of war clanking in
her hand. Then unconsciously disobeying
her dear lady, she started once again to
puff. But what could you expect? The
fight was on, the whips were out, the saw-
dust was down, and Miss Bertram’s hat was
in the ring! Lady Bannerman, debauched
by literature from the United States of
America, was undergoing a Beauty Cure.
She was gamely marching—a good way back,
but full of fight—in the penitential proces-
sion of the elderly and determined daughters
of Aphrodite: the superb Bertram nobly
rallying round her mistress against the de-
vastating and nonchalant Old Man with
the Scythe.
Lady Bannerman had now for several
years held in rigorous (though, of course,
platonic) thrall Mr. Wyndliam Winstanley,
the lord of the manor of the adjoining estate
of Winstanley Downs. Indeed, what the
district would have done without the inter-
esting friendship of Mr. Wyn. and Lady
Ban. to distract it in the somewhat languor-
ous interval between harvesting and muster-
ing is a matter for forlorn conjecture. On the
slightest evidence in Mr. Wyn. of what the
French call “capriciousness” and the Eng-
lish “trying to buck off his pack.” Lady
Bannerman simply tightened the girths on
him. In other words, she shut herself up with
Miss Bertram, and had a hot-pack, a long
massage and —like offr beautiful little Town
Hall (next door to the Pound) —a new coat
of paint.
The present high conspiracy between Lady
Bannerman and her acolyte was the prepara-
tion and undergoing of the latest ukase from
New 'Vork, as issued by that high priestess
of Venus, Madame Celestia O’Hara (Incor-
porated) in her inspired volume, "How I
Bounded Off My Corners.” Madame was
recommending nay, commanding Mud
Baths!
The occasion was clearly more serious than
the last crisis with Mr. Winstanley, who had
then only declared that Buck (Lady Ban-
nerman’s younger son, and Mr. Wyn.’s nephew
by courtesy), at present an ornament of
Oxford University, was “dashed well exceed-

AID THE KIDNEYS.
Do Not Endanger Life when there
is a Way to Avoid It.
Why will people continue to suffer the agonies of
kidney complaint, backache, urinary disorders, lameness,
headaches, languor? Why allow themselves to become
chronic invalids when a tested remedy is offered them?
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have been used in Kidney
trouble for years, and have been tested in thousands of
cases. If you have any, even one, of the symptoms of
kidney disease, act now. Serious kidney disease may
set in and make neglect dangerous. Sydney testimony is
given here:—

A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago. and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that I had
to lie Up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and I knew
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. I
was really far from well, and having seen Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to
me to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a blessing,
giving quick relief, and gradually effected a perfect cure. J feel
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble having
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.”

in’ his oats.” After this observation, Lady
Bannerman had merely despatched Miss Ber-
tram to Christchurch in the car for a chin-
strap, in which she looked remarkably like
a diver accoutred for the vasty deep. But
after yesterday, when Mr. Winstanley., with
positive querulousness, had actually gone on
to describe himself (Mr. Wyn.) as a Regular
Cistern, and Buck as a Something-or-other
Sieve, Lady Bannerman had decided, with
the sensible Celestia O'Hara, that there was
nothing else for it but Mud.
The little Bertram, without interrupting
her massaging and kneading and soft pinches,
had been glancing incessantly at her wristlet-
watch. Suddenly she fluttered out through
the French-window and skimmed towards the
wash-house like the arch-conspirator she was.
The water was due to be boiling in the
copper! She had not dared to arouse the
ravening curiosity of Berenice by setting up
a line of communication, as it were, froih
the bathroom to the empty stone-basin at
the foot of the terrace, for (need I tell you"?)
Madame O’Hara, citing as her example the
goddesses of Ancient Greece, had decreed that
these immersions must take place in the
open air. And, indeed, who could picture
a goddess locking the door on herself, and
splashing about in camera?
Miss Bertram, filling and refilling her kero-
sene-tin from tlie witches’ cauldron in the
copper, performed several staggering jour-
neys to the terrace basin, smiled upon ironi-
cally the while by seven terribly still and
silent little boys. These little boys, happily
fashioned out of concrete, although chubby
and good-tempered, and, no doubt, excellent
little boys, wore not a particle of attire—
not even a pair of rompers—although all had
large upturned hats. The biggest little boy,
the heir-apparent, so to speak, of all these
portly princelings, was promoted above his
little brothers to a place on the rim of the
basin itself, where Miss Bertram was mixing
the mud with the copper-stick. He was an
especial pet of Miss Bertram’s, and. appa-
rently, the jolliest of a light-hearted family,
for not only w r as his hat pushed rakishly back
on his congealed-looking curls, but he actu-
ally had his hands on his hips. When Miss
Bertram had at last finished, after the minute
directions of Madame O’Hara, what looked
like a very large mud-pie, she exclaimed in
her gentle way. “Why, Tommy, my dear!”
and putting her arms around his waist gave
him a kiss.
“Bertie,” said Lady Bannerman’s voice
with awfxil suddenness from behind the
rhododendrons which screened the terrace
from the drive, “I’m coming out,” and her
Ladyship appeared in a boudoir-cap and her
opossum driving-coat, holding her gold-
stoppered smelling-salts in her hand. She was
emphatically not the bathing-costume type.
Miss Bertram having with strained
anxiety tested the fluid with her elbow and
pronounced the bath ready, Lady Bannerman
flung her coat on the rhododendrons; then,
ignoring Tommy and not in the least bashful
in front of him, she mounted the basin with
the avidity of the real searcher after light
and sat down in the mud. Miss Bertram,
springing at once to her task, laid a long
swathe of warm dough along the noble line
of her lady’s backbone and opulent white
shoulders. Then witli the careful, loving
strokes of the master-craftsman she plastered
those plenteous sides and heaped an extra
helping on those arms, solid, if you will, but
determinedly seductive. Lady Bannerman
had, for the moment, by the simple process of
sitting down, eliminated necessity for the
treatment of those regions designated by the
Marquess of Queensberry as Below the Belt.
Still, little Bertram had uphill work in front
of her.
“Bertie,” instructed Lady Bannerman
briskly, "come around to this side, and you
will get at the front of me better,” and Miss
Bertram, crossing the floor of the House,
attacked with adoring assiduity that aspect
of the Question. Like Agag, she went deli-
cately, With loving and expert pats and
strokes she kneaded a scaffolding up and
down and around her dear dame’s throat;
then, arrived at that paradisaical country
wherein even Mr. Browning forgot his cus-
tomary decorum and his duty to his wife,
and, flinging all decency to the winds, after the
fashion of the poets, chanted with deep joy:
Oh, the breasts’ superb abundance,
Where a inan might base his head,
Miss Bertram, exhausted, enthusiastic, ex-
cited, dived down like a swallow for fresh
ammunition. If Tommy had not been firmly
cemented to the side of the basin she would
have sent him flying head over heels.
“Bertie,” said Lady Bannerman, blandly
grateful and encased in mud like a cross-
country sprinter, “I declare you are going as
well as the cliaffcutter to-day. Give me
both your hands, and I will get up.”
The admirable Bertram, brushing back her
hair, which was hanging all around her face
in wisps and leaving a streak of mud across
her mild brow, stooped and tugged. Lady
Bannerman heaved slightly, but subsided on
her keel like a battleship that won’t leave
the dock. Miss Bertram tugged again. No
response from that plastered and upholstered
goddess!
“Bertie!” gasped Lady Bannerman, her
face under the lace of her boudoir cap
changing from anxiety to anger and from
anger to agony, “I can’t move! That awful
stuff is caking all over me.” Indeed, Lady
Bannerman, in the glorious afternoon sun-
light, aided by laughing outbursts from the
wind, was momentarily congealing where she
sat.
"Oh, yes; I'm stuck,” she moaned.
The heroine, Bertram, her teeth clenched,
continued to tug. Hamming back her hair
behind her ears, and of course leaving fran-
tic flecks of mud behind, she went on tug-
ging. Bracing herself against Tommy, she
bent like Grace Darling herself against the
swell, and as heroically did she tug. Then
she pushed; then she shoved; then she
prayed. Finally, ceasing to invoke Heaven,
she did a little war-dance, a fqrrn of dis-
tracted hop-scotch around the basin and her
infuriated and paralysed idol.
“Bertie,” snapped Lady Bannerman, “give
me my coat and my smelling-salts, and
please stop capering, and do, for Heaven’s
sake, go and get someone, you little fool,
you !” She paused Auehnessbrauchie xvas,
by pre-arrangement, deserted. “Better take
the car and brmg little Walkingshaw if he’s
at home; and, Bertie, you must stop snivel-
ling at once, or I shall die!”
Very wisely Lady Bannerman had passed
over the Brannigans at the hotel and selected
Mr. Walkingshaw. Michael Brannigail and
Patsy, his son, chivalrous, muscular and
game, would certainly have leaped like
stags to pull a lady alive out ot a pool,
but they would also, with equal certainty,
give a dramatic (and grossly untruthful)
reproduction of the whole affair to an en-
raptured audience in the bar. Mr. Walking-
shaw, on the other hand, as became a
churchwarden, an indefatigable begetter of
offspring and an abysmally deep Sliaks-
pearean scholar, could be relied upon, lie
could be put upon his oath to hold his
tongue!
Mr. Walkingshaw’s cottage, nestling in
the elbow of the main road, was a pleasant
and coquettish little edifice. The veran-
dah-posts were’ all hung with mauteldrapes
of creepers, the little front path glistening
with shells was determinedly erratic, and
the front gate bore a framed and glassed
name-plate upon which Mrs. Walkingshaw
had printed with her own scholastic hand
a chaste legend of welcome. Mr. Walking-
shaw, doing gander-like sentry-duty before
the nest, was startled to see the Auchness-
brauchie limousine disgorge Miss Bertram
right at his feet in the midst of the bright
shells and all the elegant apparatus of
creepers and culture.
“Oh, dear Mr. Walkingshaw,” gasped Miss
Bertram, seizing his arm and trying to
speak in a whisper in order not to alarm his
wife. (All the ladies of the district knew
that it was practically always disastrous to
give the chatelaine of Elsinore a shock.)
"Dear Mr. Walkingshaw, you must come
with me at once. Her ladyship”—sobs
choked her sweet voice.
“What, is she dead?” whispered back Mr.
Walkingshaw, speaking like one of his own
best interpretations of the ghost in “Hamlet.”
lie was beginning to enjoy himself intensely.
“No,” wept the lady-in-waiting, “but she
is stuck in the bath, and I can’t get her out."
“Dearest Miss Bertram,” cried Mr. Walk-
ingshaw, secretly delighted beyond all bounds
but with the demeanor of a soldier deter-
mined to go forward or die, "get straight
back to the car, and I will be with you
in a jiffy.” He bounded stealthily into the
front bedroom and unshrouded his best velour
hat from its swaddling-clothes of tissue-
paper. Candor compels me to add that lie
also draped his gold albert in a glittering
curve across the front of his person, and that
he noiselessly pulled open a drawer and ex-
tracted his most delectable scarf-pin (a
greenstone greyhound) therefrom. The
Pasha in Mr. Walkingshaw was aroused.
But, then, Madame Celestia O’Hara, her own
self, roundly asserts that Men Are All
Alike.
“Those porcelain things,” qpoth he with
deep sympathy as the car ripped furiously
into the white ribbon of the road, “are
reg’lar skating-rinks.” And he added with
emphasis and a reminiscent rub, “Just!” He
himself at fashionable hotels, during his
triumphant and devastating tours to dif-
ferent centres of literary competitions, had
performed surprising feats in these, sanitary
contrivances, worthy almost i of one of Mr.
Wirth’s trapeze artists.
Poor Miss Bertram, hammered to the
ropes, stammered an outline of the, agonising
affair as they swung through the station
gates, and Mr. Walkingshaw, now at the
very height of his bliss, decided, as he raced
belaud her along the terrace, that Lady
Bannerman must have contracted erysipelas,
or perhaps leprosy from the Maoris.
"Oh, Bertie!” wailed poor Lady Banner-
man. “I thought the car had gone over the
gully with you. Oh.” she went on, staring
at Mr. Walkingshaw in her best lorgnon
manner and with bitter disfavor, "it's you.
is it!” She had passed beyond the con
gealment stage into what appeared an
amateur stonemason’s effort to inert!*-
up alive in her own tomb. The effect of
living statuary was, however, somewhat im-
paired by the opossum coat, the boudoir cap
and the gold-stoppered bottle.
Mr. Walkingshaw, with the air of calling
all hands to the pumps, and very sensibly
wasting no time in conversation but hus-
banding his breath, hurtled himself, after a
preliminary canter of half the length of the
terrace, with powerful impact and deep re-
spect against Lady Bannerman’s back. The
coated, capped and vinaigretted statue did
not budge. Mr. Walkingshaw, abjectly
coughing, suggested that her Ladyship should
take off her coat, so that he could “get a
better grip like”; her Ladyship told him
tartly to try to lift her up underneath it.
So Mr. Walkingshaw, blushing richly under
the brim of his velour, adventured one arm
beneath the opulent drapery of the opossum.
“Might that be your Ladyship’s laig,
now?” he faltered winningly, and his hat
rolled off with excitement.
“No, it is not!” snapped her Ladyship in
a voice like the crack of a stockwhip. “Go
away at once. You are a pair of useless
fools, the two of you.”
Here the invaluable Bertram, by this time
a perfect Niobe of tears, was visited by an
inspiration from Heaven. “Dearest Mr.
Walkingshaw.” she sobbed through her sighs,
“if I got the shovel?” The discomfited
Mr. Walkingshaw, smoothing his plumes and
hauling in slack from his gold albert, an-
swered with relief: “Bring it by all means,
dearest Miss Bertram. Only.” he added,
with the superior foresight of the male, “let
it be a spade.”
* * * *
You will, I know, be pleased to hear that,
after all, Lady Bannerman’s martyrdom was
in a good cause. After Miss Bertram had
steamed off all traces of the turgid torrent
of youth from her person she arose literally
like Venus from the sea. Indeed, Mr. Gus
Drippenham, the Sentinel's star reporter,
who is sometimes hounded by his chief into
“doing” the society notes, wrote the next
week that at the races Lady Bannerman
looked “radiant and girlish in a ravishing,”
etc. (Gus is a peculiarly sound and bounc-
ing liar, and will certainly be an editor some
day.) And as a final vindication of the
treatment of the superb Celestia O’Hara I
can tell you for a fact that dear Lady Ban-
nerman sent off to Mr. Winstanley, with
calm confidence, by one of the stockmen, her
darling Buckingham’s latest letter from Ox-
ford, with its postscript running a good deal
like- this: “Love to Fnele Wyn., and all that
sort of stuff, and tell him to send along the
rhino, anyhow.”
