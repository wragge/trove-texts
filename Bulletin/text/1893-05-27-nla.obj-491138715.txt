Many persons have wasted large amounts in vain
endeavours to rid themselves of irritability and

“ELECTRIC GIRDLE”
with eminently satisfactory results. As a proof
of my confidence in the power of my Electric
Appliances, I am prepared to allow any honest
person to
TEST THEM FREE,
or wear them one month before payment, and
should they not do exactly what I claim, they
may be returned. The “Electric Girdle” has
been so widely lauded by the Medical Profession,
Press, and
Cured Patients,
that I feel no hesitancy in advertising it as a
Certain Cure for Debility.

Legally Qualified and Registered by the Governing
Medical Board of New South Wales.
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe,
lie has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
DO YOU SUFFER

round the eyes, giddiness, irregularity of the
bowels, specks before the eyes, bashfulness, dis-
contentedness, weakness or pain in the back, liver

about to happen, weak stomach, yellow or blood-
shot eyes, constipation, impure blood, hasty,
uncontrollable temper, hacking cough, nervous-

to health, even though his case has been previously
pronounced incurable.
One Pound is Sufficient to Send

plaint. Should you require medical treatment, as
procrastination is sometimes dangerous, it would
be advisable for you to sit down quietly in your
chamber and write to the Doctor detailing all
experienced symptoms. He will, on receipt of
such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but Gd. ; enclosed in the volume

THE
NAMBROK ESTATE,
situated on the Latrobe River, Gippsland,
comprises 15,000 acres of very rich land,
which can scarcely be surpassed for agri-
cultural, fattening and dairy purposes. The
land is specially adapted for the growth of
maize, bops, root crops and cereals, and is
practically ready for the plough. The
Nambrok sheep and cattle have been for
many years noted for the excellence and
high prices obtained. The rainfall is abun-
dant, averaging about 30 inches per annum,
and the climate salubrious, being free from
extreme heat and cold. An unlimited
supply of water can be obtained at a mode-
rate depth, under 30 feet, in any portion of
the Estate.
The Thompson River, which is close to
the northern boundary of the property, can
be easily and cheaply utilised for irrigation
purposes. The Rosedale Railway Station,
111 miles from Melbourne, is within
miles of the property, and the railway line
runs directly through the property, and
the Heyfield station on the Maffra line is
about 5 miles distant.
THE
MELTON PARK ESTATE
comprises 7146 acres, close to Bacchus
Marsh, in the Parish of Yancardook,
County of Bourke, and is well known in l
Victoria for its great fertility and resi-
dential attractions. It is about a couple of
miles from the Melton Railway Station;
20 miles distant from'Melbourne, where an'
ever ready market exists for everything

Orange Blossoms or Weeds.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They had been engaged for three years;
The end for which the universe had striven ever
I since the Deluge—namely, the union of their two
iexistences,- was not yet accomplished. _ It still
needed all 1 the ingenuity of which his bank-
cler'kish' mind was capable, and all the persuasive-
ness of which she Was possessed to overcome the
i opposition of innumerable relations on both sides,
i The engagement was sanctioned That was
I very little. It was like stamping- a letter and for-
, getting to post it. „
He was in receipt of £l5O a year. Many are
'married and miserable on less than that. It now
' crossed his mind that they might as well follow
I their parents’ example and venture on clandestine
marriage. , , .
Bessie was the eldest daughter of a Mayor ot
on-e of Sydney’s suburbs, and she wanted a real
i wedding ’’—-slippers and rice, and cake and orange
blossoms—also, a few presents, and a newspaper-
paragraph. She was very firm. Lifting her
sweet brown eyes to his pleading face, she_ said
“ No, George, not even for you will I deceive my
father and mother. If you love me don t ask it
of IHG#**
“ Vou do not love me,” said Georgeif you
did, you would let the whole world go and cling to
me. Bessie, my darling— Bessie—look at me.
Tell me you will let them all go, and come tome.
But Bessie was as adamant. It was not tor
nothing that she had a Mayor for a father; some
of his blood was in her veins. When she saw how
duty’s finger pointed, she trampled even her anec-
t'ions under foot, and trod that way.
George was in’ despair. Unspeakable tear
tugged at his heart, while Bessie strained at a
came to the conclusion that he did not know
where he would be in another year or two. Also,
he did not know where Bessie would be. l hat
last thought was terrible ; it brought the perspira-
tion to his brow. ,
One by one, the days came and went; he could
not have endured more than one at a time ; once
he could have taken seven all together. I hat was
when he saw Bessie every evening ; now they met
but once a week. , , -
He was quite calm when next he sought ner,
but misery was written in every line of his race,
in every look of the eyes she had learned to love
“ Don’t touch me, Bessie !” he said, holding her
in his arms and kissing her, “ Help me to be
strong—to do what is right. I want your help,
She crept closer and laid one trembling hand on
his shoulder: “ You’rein some awful trouble, dear,
she said. , T .
George groaned. “ I love you soi and I mus
give you up,” he cried. „„
“ Give me up ! Give me up and you love me.
“God help me, yes. Bessie, little love, be
brave. You do love me, don fc you ?
Her look was more convincing than volumes oi
affirmatives. . -
“Bessie, I’m ill—very ill—con-confoundedly
ill.” That was breaking the news. As she was
only regarding him with dilating eyes, and still
breathing, he added, “ I’m worse than I can quite
grasp yet. Little love, for all our years of wait-
ing, it is no use —I’m a dying got
heart-disease, and nothing can save me.
Such an ending to their courtship they had
never conceived. Words failed the girl; she could
Only grasp him with both hands, as though a
pawning grave were around them. Suddenly he
caught het closet to him.
“ I’ve one year,” he whispered, one little year.
Ob, don’t refuse me. 1 came to give y Oll U P a .
cannot- 1 love you. Ilove.yod. Oh, my daring,
let my last year be spent with you. From all the
years of my life give me one—one year—one
twelve months. Think how I love you, think how
you love me. Think how true you are.
After all, Bessie was first a lover and then a
Mayor’s daughter. She forgot all her dreams, and
her parents, and the world. She remembered only
( ' Omfday she signed away the name the Mayor
nad given her, and took one from a bank-clerk,
with only an old woman and a deaf clergyman in
the church—and no orange blossoms at all.
The days continued to drop away one after the
other just as usual—perhaps they went a little
quicker. And every day fought George one day
nearer to the grave. Bessie would wake up in the
night with the thought gnawing at her heart, it
was there always ; it never left her. M
George and she went into lodgings. The Mayor
and Mayoress and several of their children cut
them. Poverty looked in at every pane of the
window as well as from the door. Three months
slipped away, and after those another three.
Damocles’ sword was suspended in monthly
notches. Only six more slips and the last notch
would be past, and it would be upon them.
The symptoms were developing. George grew
pale and thin. Bessie said it was worry. Helosfc
his appetite, and she blamed the bank. Then he
became irritable and acquired an extra pain m his
left side. To that she could say nothing—there
was nothing to say or do. Only watch and pray
—and endure.
And the sword slipped a few more notches.
Bessie needed all her strength now merely to hve.
George was irritable, overbearing, selfish, dog-
matic. She meekly bowed her head to it all. it
was a consequence of his disease, and what wife
would not endure martyrdom with widowhood
only a notch or two distant ? , .
And the sword slipped three more notches. Any
day it might fall now. Bessie grew irritable
under her great suspense. She contradicted
George twice, she stamped at him three times,
and once she slammed the door in lus face. I hen
repentance overtook her, and she wept.
The days grew into months, and the months
into years, and George yet lived. The sword,
like Bessie’s forbearance, was gone. They forgot
there was such a thing as death-except for
others
Bessie has lost her orange-blossoms—if one can
lose what one never had—and now she be #’ ns ,
fear she will lose what she will never have-her
weeds. George is still pale and irritable, and his
disease is now fully developed-indigestion.
Bessie is embittered. She can only hope her
reward may be in Heaven, but she has been taught
that weeds are not from there.

“No one wishes to be unjust to tee-
totallers and moralists,” says G, R. Sims; “but
it is a remarkable fact that most of the gigantic
commercial frauds of recent times have been asso-
ciated with the names of gentlemen belonging to
the ancient order of Pharisees. The cloak of the
Puritan too frequently hides the shirt of Lai tune,
and the swindling bank-director sits down to pre-
pare a bogus -balance-sheet after presenting a
thousand pounds of somebody else’s money to a
fund for the enlargement of the local chapel.
Yet Sims had his eye upon England and not on
Australia when he wrote that.

Wanted—A State Audit Department.
The amazing collapse, in less than fourteen
months, of fourteen banks out of the twenty-
two Avhich, at the beginning of last year, were
trading in Australia, is still another evidence
of the urgent necessity for a State Audit
Department in these provinces. The same
lesson Avas taught before in the fall of the
Van Dieman’s Land Bank, the Commercial
of South Australia, the Real Estate, Stan-
dard, Imperial, and Anglo-Australian, the
famous, or infamous, Premier Permanent
Society, and a hundred other like disasters,
but it was never so strongly impressed upon
the nation as by the universal smash of the
past few Aveeks, And, so far as the available
evidence goes, there is absolutely no
guarantee that the collapse of the next few
weeks may not furnish a still more definite
proof of the necessity of displacing Ananias,
the auditor, Avith some independent public
authority ; for whether this country is at the
end, or the middle, or only at the beginning
of its financial troubles no one can tell. The
one thing that can be told Avith certainty is
that all—or nearly all—directors are liars,
and that there is no faith in auditors, and
that no balance-sheet Avhich is compounded
by any son of man, except under absolutely
independent and even hostile supervision, is
of any account whatsoever.
# # •
The private auditing farce is played out.
The auditor, in the vast majority of cases, is
practically the appointee and the bond-slave
of the directors, and his livelihood depends
upon his readiness to swear, at all times and
seasons, that everything is right, whether it
is right or not. The business of an auditor
is to be blind in one eye, and to see nothing
that he is not desired to see Avith the other ;
and the man who does not fill these require-
ments falls into ill-odour and loses his
employment. The remedy which the share-
holders or other persons interested have
against either the directors or auditors is
practically nil. The average board is a
species of secret society or irremoveable
oligarchy. It can only be shifted by a
majority vote at a meeting of shareholders,
and by gathering up its friends and rela-
tions, and those members of the company
who can be influenced by overdrafts and
other devices, and scooping in proxies
from indifferent, ignorant, and helpless
people at a distance, it can almost always
vote down a recalcitrant faction if it is
worth its while to do so. Moreover,
even if it is possible to shift a board, or a
section thereof, Avhich is suspected of cor-
ruption or incapacity, it can only, in the case
of a large institution with a widespread pro-
prietary, be done by an agitation and public
scandal and general upheaval which adver-
tises the alleged rottenness of its finances to
the furthest ends of the earth. In the case
of a bank—Avhich depends so largely on the
estimation in which it is held by the public—
such a proceeding means probably the start-
ing of a panic which may end in ruin ; in the
case of a life-insurance office it means a
malodorous advertisement which may destroy
the progress of a decade. And even if the
change is accomplished, there is absolutely
no more effectual check on the new board
than there was on the old one. Therefore
the directors and the auditors generally
“ fake” their deceptive sheet without hind-
rance until the crash comes and proves, for
the hundredth time, that the accounts might
as profitably have been inspected by a
chimpanzee.
* • *
The necessity for a State Audit Depart-
ment is emphasised by the utter meaning-
lessness of the average balance-sheet. The
significance of every bank’s statement of
accounts lies in the item “ all other
advances,” which generally forms three-
fourths of the assets, and ranges anywhere
from tens of thousands to tens of millions,
according to the size of the institution.
Whether these advances are fully secured,
or Avhether the security has depreciated five
or 100 per cent., or Avhether a great part of
them never had any tangible security at all,
the average balance-sheet does not eA’en
pretend to say. The same criticism applies,
in a less degree, to the “mortgages”
in the annual statement of every life-assur-
ance office, “land-bank,” and building
society. It is impossible for those interested
to ascertain the value or valuelessness of the
alleged asset except by virtually deposing the
directors and auditors, and insisting on Avhat
is practically a hostile investigation, and it is
impossible to get such an investigation until
the suspicions of a large number of the share-
holders are seriously roused, and owing to
the board’s special facilities for concealment
and perversion of the truth such sus-
picions hardly ever are roused until the
■uin is past remedy, and seldom even
then. Moreover, such an investigation, as
already pointed out, is practically an an-
nouncement to the whole world of presum-
able insolvency. What is wanted is not the
spasmodic kind of independent audit which
never, by any chance, comes until it is too
late, but a continuous inspection by an abso-
lutely independent authority, Avhich will do
its work Avhether suspicion is aroused or not,
Avhich Avill be superior to bribes or extraneous
influences, which will regard managers and
auditors and boards of directors Avith the
same hostile eye that the policeman casts
on the seedy outcast in the park, and
which will deal out the same measure to the
biggest bank and the biggest insurance
society as it does to the humblest building
society in a back-blocks township. Such an
institution would form the ideal Audit
Department, and the ideal head of that de-
partment Avould be an icy mathematician of
the unbending suspicion and practicalness of
the experienced Hebrew usurer, a man
devoted Avholly to figures, an orphan, friend-
less, and a celibate, a deformed and boAV-
legged individual whose hideousness Avould
put him beyond the range of “society”
influence, a teetotaller and a misanthrope.
If such an individual could be found and
hired at £lO,OOO per annum to be the enemy
of the board of every financial institution
which takes in deposits or premiums or
otherwise deals with the money and con-
fidence of the public, the investment would
be the very best which the State has ever yet
made.
• • •
The scope for a public officer of this de-
scription is enormous. Scores and scores of
the benefit and friendly societies of Aus-
tralasia are insolvent from an actuary’s
standpoint, or else on the brink of insol-
vency. They nearly all offer benefits which
are more or less out of keeping with the pre-
miums levied on their members, and exist
mostly — as has just been slioavii by N.S. W.
State statistician Coghlan with respect to
some of their number—by trusting to Provi-
dence and passing on the responsibility to the
morrow. Somewhere over one-half of the
building societies in this country have re-
cently suspended, or “reconstructed,” or
gone utterly and hopelessly bankrupt with
next to nothing in the £, and over many
more hangs the sword. All these disastrous
institutions, from the Premier Permanent
downwards, were sworn to as solvent by
their directors and auditors to the bitter
end. Nine-tenths of the “land-banks”
have gone more or less horribly, and every
one of them also Avas audited and proved to
be in a state of glorious prosperity almost
to the last day of its miserable existence.
Two-thirds of the banks of issue have
collapsed, after declaring big dividends and
carrying large alleged sums to the reserve-
fund amid general enthusiasm. And as all
these banks, except the Federal and the
malodorous Mercantile, have been, or are
being, “ reconstructed ” by the same crowd
which SAvore to their solvency until they
hurst, and as the mysterious item, “ other
advances, £10,000,000,” or Avhatever the
amount may be, remains as inexplicable as
ever, the need for State audit is, in their
case, as great now as it was before. In most
instances the only inspection made has been
by the individuals whose incapacity, or per-
jury, or dishonesty, or whatever it might be,
was so fully demonstrated by the original
suspension, and therefore, for all the evi-
dence to the contrary, the re-organised in-
stitution is almost as legitimate an object of
suspicion as Davies’ famous speculation,
whose misfortune it was that it died before
re-organisation Avas invented.
# • »
Furthermore, the same suspicion extends
to at least some of the institutions which
have survived the panic—in fact, it ex-
tends everyAvbere. A sound institution
which rashly locks up too much of its
money in advances may succumb to a
sudden run ; a hopelessly rotten and fraudu-
lent one which turns everything into cash
and whose alleged “ advances” and “securi-
ties ” are absolutely non-existent, may out-
live the run, and keep going from bad to worse
and gathering in deposits for many years.
In some cases, indeed, the most insolvent
bank has the best chance at a crisis, for the
mere knowledge that suspension may mean
inspection, and inspection must mean penal
servitude, causes the board and Ananias,
the auditor, to prepare more diligently for
emergencies, and gather in fixed deposits
more ardently that they may pay immediate
liabilities out of the proceeds. And —though
in a less degree —the same necessity for
State supervision exists in the case of life-
insurance societies. The advantage of a dis-
honest life insurance society lies in the fact
that it cannot be rushed by its clients after
the manner of a bank, and so long as the
premiums come hi freely it can disguise its
condition almost indefinitely. The further
advantage of all insurance societies, honest
or otherwise, lies in the fact that—not being
subject to “ runs ” —they can “ nurse ” their
bad investments, if necessary, for genera-
tions, and a very large percentage of bad
investments turn out good if only the
investor can Avait till the boom returns, as it
always does return sooner or later. Never-
theless, the fall of one of the great life-
offices of Australia would mean almost as much
ultimate disaster to the poor as the collapse of
half-a-dozen banks, and the want of efficient
State supervision in their case is a horrible
example of the insincerity of Australian
legislation and legislators.
The “Private Enterprise” Boom.
Success has so far attended the efforts of
MTlvvraith, and those Avho stand behind
him, to straddle, possess, and devour
Queensland. From present appearances,
nothing short of a miracle can save the
province from strangulation. The best that
can be hoped for in the present Parliament
is the persistent barking of a few watch-dogs
at a gang of political looters Whom they can-
not bite. Even some of those may be
nobbled or muzzled by the great artist who
has engineered affairs to the present posi-
tion. But, anyhow, the prospect, Avith a
handful of Labour members, the remnant of
an Opposition tbut was no better than it
should be> and a few “independent” rail-
sitters, is a gloomy one for comparatively
honest government. The game lias been
dexterously played and the syndicates have
Avon. Before the electors can, in the ordinary
course of things, speak again, the partition
of the country’s remaining lands Avill pro-
bably have proceeded far. The ligatures that
are to stop the circulation of its life-blood
will be tied on and ready for tightening.
Such raA’enous and parasitical “ vested in-
terests ” Avill have been entrenched in a way
that hardly anything but melinite and
bayonets can shift them.
# # #
And, as we foresaw, the triumph of the
plotters against Queensland has emboldened
those Avho are hungering to raid New South
Wales. The vulturine claw now visibly
steals from out the monopolistic coat-sleeVe.
A feast for kites and vampires has been
spread in Queensland ; the cloth is being
laid in Sydney. The condition into which
public finances Avere alloAved to drift in
Queensland Avas made the excuse for re-
placing State initiative by “ private enter-
prise.” The credit of the province was
worked to death in raising loans, most
of which directly or indirectly enriched per-
sons and corporations, Avhile impoverishing
the people as a Avhole. Then, Avhen the
ordinary sources of revenue for constructing
public works had been destroyed, and a set-
tled frown brought upon the face of Lom-
bard-street, the advantages of doing by
“ private ’’-—mostly very private—“enter-
prise” Avhat could not be done by other
means were dwelt upon. Tloav to find
employment for a heavily-taxed and stone-
broke population was the problem. Public
Avorks were wanted ; public works would give
profitable employment to the nubile. Public
money could not be obtained ; avliv not then
let public-spiiited private persons undertake
these things 1 It Avas a plausible line of
argument. Once get the stomachs of yonr
listeners empty, and any argument that pro-
mises to fill them, even temporarily, sounds
plausible. In Queensland some voters wore
in the swim, and these had most power.
Others, a few, resolutely ojiposed the
whole infamous business. But the vote
Avhich has given Queensland over to
the spoilers was that of those Avhose
poverty, but not their will, consented. Of
the supporters of the land-grant railway aUcl
the Kanaka, probably a big majority hated
both. To secure present employment in the
feverish boom of railway-building, or in
supplying slaves, they have sold their Owh
children into slavery.
* # *
Practically, the same conditions prevail in
New South Wales. For long past the
Government has been unable to proceed
with large national works. For long to
come it will probably be unable to pay
current expenses, unless the Fat Man is
tapped, which contingency yet seems afar
off. The unemployed increase, wages are
cut down, retrenchment all round is adopted,
business falls off’, depression deepens. The
public ear inclines to any scheme that will
bring relief, and bring it quickly. That
is the time to pour into it stories of the
prosperity that will result if “ private enter-
prise ” is allowed a free hand in a large and
generous way. Within the last fortnight
there has been a remarkable unanimity of
opinion in the Sydney press that “ private
enterprise ’’ has been monstrously suppressed
in the past, and that if the province is to be
dragged'back from the edge of perdition, the
job must be entrusted to syndicates. The
slightest indication of any extension of
municipal functions is promptly, shamelessly,
and with absolute savagery, jumped upon.
The safety of the public is now clearly seen
to lie in this—that the rendering of services
of every kind to the public must be left to
“private enterprise.” The innate per-
niciousness of an attempt by a municipal
council to supply the rate-payers with gas or
electric-light, is proclaimed from the house-
tops and in the organs of the gang, and
the proposal that it shall run a ferry-boat
for public benefit is seen through at a glance,
and exposed as an attack on the sacred prin-
ciple of private enterprise, which must be
defeated at all cost
* * *
The Australian Star has hailed Minister
Lyjne's declaration that in future the New
South Wales Government is not to be looked
to for the construction of public works as a
message of deliverance. It is so in one
sense. It conveys an intimation that, if
possible, the people are to be delivered over
to the syndicates, gagged and bound as they
have been in Queensland. Nothing is
clearer than that all kinds of wires are being
pulled to establish in New South Wales such
a dynasty of privileged blackmailers as has
been inaugurated there. The beginning
will be much more modest, no doubt. If
possible, a private railway or two with sham
provisions to restrain the syndicates from
fleecing the public, then more of the Same
kind, electric-lighting rights, water-power
rights—all sorts of private rights involving
public wrongs. The Bulletin has Said
before that it would be worth a civil war to
prevent a mile of State railway-lines froin
passing into the control of private hands.
And it would be better to go without UeeA-
ful new works to the end of our days thah
have them built oh such terms as would be
asked by and conceded to private syndicated.
* h *
But there is no need to go without theffi.
There is a very simple way of getting them
built without imposing hew taxation on the
workers, and Avithout immolating the people
at the shrine of “ private enterprise.’*
There never was a public undertaking of ally
importance carried out which did not add a
value to the country’s lands equal to the cost of
its construction. What is the matter with a
betterment tax Avhich would take that value
to recoup the expenditure ? That is how the
London County Council is going to proceed.
The members of that body, and of the
Glasgow and Manchester County Councils,
do not propose abandoning public AvOfkS
because they have no funds. They propose
compelling those Avho Will be specially behe-
fitted to become responsible for their share
of the benefit. Instead of trusting to private
enterprise, they are extending the sphere of
municipal activities, and tendering public
service in many directions better and more
cheaply than it Avas ever rendered before.
And it is to such examples, and not to that
of Queensland, that Australia must look.
When the Panic is Over.
WHEN the financial panic is over, and all the
banks which have collapsed, or are going to
collapse, have successfully re-constructed, the
people of Australia may possibly find time to
consider what is likely to happen next. So far,
they apparently have not considered this point;
it seems to be generally taken for granted
that the country will be near the end of its
present troubles when the suspended institu-
tions are floated once more on a “ sound basis,
whereas all the signs are that the real disaster
will only then be beginning. The prominent
feature of the re-constructions is the frantic
desire to build up huge capitals—to start each
bank on a more bloated scale than its rivals ;
and when these unnaturally swollen and
dropsical enterprises get into working order
some surprising results must ensue. The in-
crease of what is euphoniously termed “bank-
ing facilities” will be very great, but Aus-
tralia, in its present condition, has no earthly
use for half, or anywhere near half, the said
facilities. And as the banks will have to earn
dividends on three or four times their former
capital they will necessarily be more merciless
usurers than they ever were before, and will
grope more industriously in order to scrape up
the necessary percentage. The Commercial of
Australia alone, when it gets into full blast,
must realise £(500,000 profit annually in order
to pay 10 per cent, to its shareholders. In one
way and another the banking capital of the
country, including “inscribed deposits” and


interminable debentures, which are simply
capital under another name, will probably be
raised from about seventeen millions to some-
thing approaching a hundred, (Hid this awful
xnonument of “ private enterprise ” will entail
a vast burden on the community which keeps
the dividends going.
# v #
Everything included, something approaching
three-fourths of the trading capital of the com-
munity has, during the past two mouths, been
violently seized upon and locked up —much of
it confiscated for ever in the shape of perpetual
deposits, preference-shares, and similar devices,
the rest for various terms, most of them from
seven to fifteen years. In Brisbane, Sydney
and Melbourne, nearly three-fourths of the
traders, shopkeepers, and employers of labour
generally, are thus deprived of their liquid
resources. For the present, the results of this
monetary upheaval have hardly begun to be
apparent. The great majority of small traders
are living for the present by staving off their
creditors, renewing their bills, and obtaining
extensions of credit in various ways ; and the
wholesale dealers who grant these extensions
are doing likewise with their creditors, and so
on all round the circle. Everybody is waiting
till his particular bank is “ re-constructed,” in
the hope that he may be able to sell his pre-
ference shares or debentures or deposit receipts
or other paper currency, and keep afloat with the
proceeds. But, for sufficiently obvious reasons,
bardlv anyone will be able to realise these miser-
able apologies for value received, and when
this fact is generally understood a widespread
insolvency must result. Every one who is
involved in the disaster will begin to sell tip his
debtors in order that he may avoid being him-
self sold up by his creditors, and while he is
doing it he will probably be also sold up by
other men who are actuated by the same
motives. The commercial panic has not yet
begun, but when it begins its end is past fore-
seeing.
# # *
The reason why nobody, or hardly anybody,
will be able to realise his alleged securities
hardly requires explanation. In the first place,
almost everybody will be selling, and as almost
everybody will possess a superfluity of this
kind of paper hardly anybody will be a buyer.
The prospect of a rush setting in for bank
paper is about as remote as the prospect of an
active demand for Argentine securities at
Buenos Ayres. The country will be choke-
full of undigested paper. It will be, in a
certain sense, a forced and irredeemable cur-
rency—shares, debentures, bonds, and deposit-
receipts all alike ; with one added disadvantage
—it will be irredeemable, but it will not be
currency. And buyers will be practically
non-existent for the further reason that the
banks have confiscated the coin with which
alone purchases can be made. Tim capitalist
who is willing to buy up bank paper will, in
many cases, have nothing but similar paper to
give in exchange, and money for speculative
purposes will be almost unobtainable. The
immediate result of the unscrupulous “ water-
ing ” which has taken place will be wholesale
depreciation, and if the process goes much
further the time may yet arrive when bank
shares will be sold by weight, and irredeemable
debentures be traded off by the barrow-load.
* # #
Another inevitable consequence is that the
banks will own Australia, body, soul, and
estate, for many years to come. They have, by
a bushranging process of finance, annexed most
of the trading capital of the country, and fixed
it in their bloated pawnbroking emporiums
either for ever or for a long term of years, and,
having done this, they now promise to alleviate
the disaster by granting overdrafts to the more
solvent of their plundered customers —at the cus-
tomary 8 or 9 per shent, and with such security
as they may think sufficient. Therefore, the
situation of the average trader will be some-
thing like this : He has, say, £lOOO on current
account in a reconstructed bank, which sum is
now transposed into one or other of the various
forms of unsaleable paper at, probably, per
cent, interest. The money being absolutely
necessary to keep his business afloat, he gets an
overdraft—if he is fortunate enough to obtain
one~at 8 per cent., and thus, instead of his
money bringing in a return, he pays £35 per
annum for the use of his own capital. His
debentures, or whatever the printed evidence
of the robbery perpetrated upon him may be
called, being at best worth, probably, only
somewhere about £5OO in the open market, he
has to give security over his property for the
use of his own money. His business goes to
wreck, because the purchasing power of the
community is reduced to zero through the con-
fiscation of capital by the banks, therefore the
hank ultimately sells him up for failure to repay
his own money, and the interest due to the
fellow who stole it, when called upon. And, to
complete his ruin, his property sells for less
than half its value, simply by reason of the fact
that the money of possible purchasers has
already been annexed by one or other of the
hanks, and there is practically no cash avail-
able for speculative purposes. Under such
conditions, the banks will presently have a lien
upon the whole continent of Australia. They
Required a temporary hold upon one-half of it
hy the old-time process, conceived when bank-
lug was still in its infancy, of lending out their
deposits upon mortgage and afterwards fore-
closing. Then, by repudiating their liabilities
ail( l thus making the borrowed money their
cwu, they secured a firm and permanent foot-
hold, and from this vantage-ground they now
reach out for the other half of the country, with
? better prospect than before of not over-
balancing and breaking their necks in the effort.
/ * * *
Taking all things into account, it would pro-
bably have been better for the country if every
jauk which collapsed had been peacefully
hquidated ai) d never again heard of. Australia,
even before the recent panic, had a greater
pressure of bank to the square inch than any
other country on this earth, and now the pres-
',| Ue l ias been trebled. When the “ re-con-
structions ’’are completed, about one-sixth of
he whole wealth of Australia, reckoning in
. 16 continent itself and everything that is upon
I '> will be represented by the paper of these
overgrown pawnshops in all its various shapes.
They will control all the moveable or conveni-
ently realisable wealth in the land. They already
practically own the Legislatures, and with their
increased power and influence they will pre-
sently own them altogether. And there is
absolutely no guarantee against the repetition
of the recent inflating process, with all its
ruinous consequences, whenever the opportunity
arrives. When Australia recovers from its
present difficulties, and partially digests the
great mass of I O U’s which now lie like a
mountain upon its soul, the flow of deposits
will probably begin afresh, and when they
mount up to one or two hundred millions it
will doubtless be found that they also, like the
last lot, can’t be found when wanted, and an
attempt will be made to “ reconstruct ” them
also. Or else, in place of receiving money pay-
able at fixed dates in the old fashion, the
banks will adopt the system of interminable
“ inscribed stock deposits,” which are never
payable at all until the Last Day—and not
even then. And thus the time may come when
Australia will consist entirely of banks—when
the banks will own everything from the Great
Australian Bight to Cape York, and every man
of property will have his w'orldly goods in the
shape of bank shares or debentures, and will
deposit them in the bank for safe keeping. A
very few more “ re-constructions ” like the
present, and the thing would be done. y
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sydney “Telegraph” on State
Banking.
The report of the committee appointed by the
New South Wales Assembly to consider the
advisability of establishing a State bank, has
roused the Sydney Telegraph to frenzy—a
frenzy of execration. In the course of a column
of print it blasts the committee and all its
works with all the contents of the office dic-
tionary. It curses because the committee
states that “confidence is the foundation of
sound banking ”; the Telegraph has been
saying the same thing for weeks past—at least,
it has been saying, with a horrible iteration, that
the want of confidence is the cause of unsound
banking, which is just about identical—so it
can’t and doesn’t contradict the assertion ; it
merely curses. It curses some more because the
committee remarks that the Government would
inspire more confidence than any private syndi-
cate ; it doesn’t deny this either, but again it
sin:ply curses. Then it professes that the coni-
mitteesuffers from an insane idea “that anational
bank could make stamped paper take the place
of money, and in that way provide all that was
wanted without troubling anybody.” As the
committee suggested the very opposite of this,
and proposed that the .State Bank should issue
its “ stamped paper ” on the same system as is
now adopted, or alleged to be adopted, by the
private banks, this is unscrupulous misrepre-
sentation pure and simple. Also, it badly wants
to know' where the State would get the neces-
sary capital to run the institution. Evidently
it regards this as an absolutely crushing
argument, and the obvious answer —that the
capital, if obtainable in no other way, could
always be got by seizing upon the deposits and
by wholesale repudiation of engagements, after
the fashion now affected by “private enter-
prise,” and that it would be quite as pleasant
for the depositor to be swindled by the State
as by a syndicate—is entirely overlooked.
After this the daily organ proceeds to point out
that the “ forced paper currency ” proposed to
be issued by the State Bank—no such thing is
proposed, but that is a mere side-issue—would
be far more nefarious than that which
now afflicts New South Wales, because the
latter is “issued against ample and obvious secu-
rities.” As it happens, however, the securities
in question, so far as the banks are concerned,
though they may or may not be ample, are
assuredly not obvious, as everybody, including
the Telegraph, is fully aware. Until the
banks are constantly audited by the State,
there will never be anything obvious about
them, and, in any case, an authorised issue of
£7,000,000 in paper against a coin-reserve of
about £2,500,000, which reserve is also the
security for £4,000,000 or more of deposits pay-
able at call, isn’t issuing against “ obvious
securities ” —it is simply a case of relying upon
credit—the same thing which the Telegraph
says the State Bank must not do under pain of
general ruin. But probably the brightest
feature of the article is the Telegraph’s shriek
on the subject of interest :
At present the rate of interest is determined by compe-
tition. Like everything else, the price of money obeys
the law of supply and demand. The banks are obliged,
by the rivalry amongst themselves, to pay the highest
market rate to depositors, and lend to borrowers at the
lowest. It is impossible to see where the cheap money
would come from. If the national bank borrowed it from
depositors they would require the market rate of interest
for it, which would either have to be paid by the customer
or by the taxpayer. According to the committee’s
scheme, the customer would get it below the market
rate, as fixed by unrestricted competition, consequently
the taxpayer would have to make good the difference.
Apart from the facts that the price of money
doesn’t obey the law of supply and demand at
present, but is fixed rather by bulldozing the
depositor, and that the banks have a species of
agreement which entirely prevents “unrestricted
competition,’’the question aboutwhere the cheap
money is to come from is easily answered. The
private banks borrow money at 4 per cent, and
lend it out again at 8 or 10, and pay dividends up
to 25 per cent, thereby. The State can also take
deposits at 4 per cent, and lend them out at 6,
and yet make a good profit on the transaction.
This a'nswers the Telegraph’s great conundrum
in one sentence.
—.—
Village Settlements for the Unemployed.
It is common to dismiss the sorrows of the un-
employed with the remark “ they could obtain
work if they really wanted it.” It pays many
people to relieve their pockets and their con-
sciences of a burden even at the expense of
falsehood. It is not likely that many men
would prefer the joys of an idleness obtained at
the cost of sleeping out in the cold winter
nights, the wearing of filthy rags, and the
racking of dirt-boxes for rejected scraps, to the
enjoyment of even the meanest comforts of un-
remitting toil. Probably one out of every hum
dred of the compulsorily-idle is disinclined to
toil, and it is more than likely that such dis-
inclination arises from some physical or mental
unfitness for which its owner is not personally
responsible. Human beings are not born
lazy. Full of the joy of life, the child’s
greatest pleasure lies in overtaxing its undeve-
loped muscle. Arrived at manhood or woman-
hood, and compelled to labour at uncongenial
tasks during over-lengthy hours, while badly
housed, clothed and fed, and without prospect
of betterment, the day’s work becomes a dis-
tasteful routine, and that physical exhilaration
which finds vent in love of useful exertion is
quickly smothered. Or, the prematurely-
wearied individual is dismissed with the more
diligent because of business depression. All
are deprived of honest opportunities to labour
during weary months, while the faculties
for labour are rusting from disuse. It is
better to wear out than to rust out, says
someone, and Society is lucky if the man
thus misused does not turn out a loafer;
luckier still if he does not become a thief.
Society is willing to accept the respon-
sibilities of its unemployed after they become
loafers or criminals; for them it builds asylums
and gaols, but acts with criminal stupidity
when it ignores their wants and rights prior to
that stage, and thus drives them to swell the
vast army of undesirables. Society, further-
more, acts with contemptible treachery when it
excuses its failure to provide the opportunities
for honest work by stating that they are not
desired. Just now the manufacture of loafer,
prostitute, and criminal is the most flourishing
native industry. Just now the existence of
loafer, prostitute, and criminal is admitted by
the State, while the existence of the disin-
herited, willing to work but unable to find an
opening, is ignored. They will be avenged in
time. Society is its own worst enemy.
The Day of Reckoning.
As the N.S.W. parliamentary session is nearly
over, it might be advisable for some member
to ask the Government —lest the opportunity
should not again present itself—what course it
proposes to adopt when the bank-proclamation
expires. When that event takes place the
Legislature will probably be in recess, and the
Dibbs Ministry will be able to go on its
erratic way without any supervision what-
ever. Under present conditions, the State
has guaranteed the notes of English
and two local banks up to about £7,000,000,
and at least one—almost certainly two—of these
institutions are availing themselves of this
opportunity to send their gold to satisfy certain
rampant creditors in other provinces where
their notes are not blessed with a State endorse-
ment. Only a few days ago about £250,000 (or
semethina like a couple of tons) of gold was
despatched in this manner to Brisbane, and
other shipments are going on at frequent inter-
vals. Therefore, New South Wales, by its
“ vigorous” policy, is supplying gold to all the
other provinces, and practically guaranteeing
the debts of a whole continent. But when the
half-year expires, and a great proportion of
the notes in forced circulation are presented
for payment —what is the outlook? The
limited stock of coin now on hand will have
vanished long before then to pay creditors in
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and
elsewhere. The prospect of realising securities
or calling up overdrafts is practically nil; no
securities would realise half their value under
present conditions, and no one can pay his over-
draft, least of all in gold which is the one
essential. Gold is even likely to be somewhat
scarce in the Treasury, for coin is fast vanish-
ing out of circulation, and Nemesis is coming
upon the State in the shape of its own guar-
anteed notes which it will have to present to
itself with a brazen demand for hard money
in exchange. The great expedient of the Dibbs
Cabinet has produced three separate results : it
has postponed the day of reckoning for six
months ; it has shifted the liabilities of the
other provinces on to New South Wales ; and
it has made the State finally responsible for the
lot. And the signs are that, in the end, the
State may have to find £2,000,000 or so to
settle up the liability. It will, without any
possible doubt, find the amount, or five times
as much if needful, but at what a cost ! the
whole business has been supreme foolishness
from first to last. The obvious way out of the
difficulty at the beginning was by an issue of
State notes, to be temporarily declared a legal
tender, which could be advanced to the banks
at a nominal interest on the security of their at
present unrealisable assets. In this way the
Treasury would have been fully protected, the
banks would have been able to obtain loans on
securities which, though intrinsically good, are
utterly useless in the present emergency, and
as the issue could be withdrawn by slow
degrees there would be no sudden and violent
day of reckoning. Bnt this idea might have
led in the end to the establishment of a State
Bank. At all events, it looked too much like
the thin edge of that abhorred possibility, and
for that reason the Dibbs “ private enterprise”
Ministry preferred to guarantee the banks with
no security whatever, and to take the chance of
a run on the emaciated Treasury just when it
will be least able to stand the strain. Ihe State
Bank must come.
-♦ —-
The one solid consolation of the “ great ’ daily
papers of Australia, amid the bang and clatter
of falling banks, is that these exploded institu-
tions have brought a lot of British capital into
Australia. Says the Sydney Telegraph on
this subject:—
All the banks which hold large British deposits have
suspended payment, and it is one distinct good out of
things evil that the money remains here.
The Bulletin regretfully confesses that it can’t
see where the “distinct good” comes in. When
a man living, say, at Newtown, goes into Red-
fern and pawns his coat for 205., and brings
the pound back to Newtown, he is bringing
money into his own district in exactly the
same way as the Australian banks have been
bringing it into Australia. And when he can t
get the'eoat out again, and lias to renew the
pawn-ticket for another six months, whereby
the pound remains in the district, lie gets
exactly the same “distinct good as Australia
is now getting nut of the bank suspensions.
And when he keeps on renewing the ticket
until he has paid twice the value of the coat, in
interest, and then gets it out at last and finds it
mostly eaten by moths, he is in precisely the
same blessed situation as this country will be
in when it finally settles up—as it must do
sooner or later. When a paper calls an im-
mense mortgage a “distinct good,” what would it
call a big earthquake or an outbreak of cholera \
Victoria, on the excellent authority of A.N.A.
Purves, is “ overwhelmed by a wave of mis-
fortune, caused by an individual band of
marauders who, in their sinister and evil minds,
conceived schemes of such gross dishonesty that
the fortunes of the people of the province are in
danger. Whether punishment will fall on the
heads of those people he knows not, but it ought
to, because Victoria’s financial credit must be
established in the world before they can step on
to federation.” Having cursed the marauders
in his frenzy of patriotism, Purves proposed to
“ save the country ” on the lines previously laid
down by one Pudney —viz., by a State lottery
distribution of the lands which the aforesaid
marauders are so anxious to get quit of. Pro-
bably the professional instinct of Purves, Q.C.,
came in here. He would prefer, maybe, to have
the marauders supplied with untold gold for
the purpose of briefing fifteen counsel apiece
before the Crown commenced to go for them in
earnest. It is indeed difficult to separate the
native patriot from the barrister in the case of
Purves. Only a few weeks ago, he was
defending, with fiery eloquence, the secretary
of a busted bank that had started with a paid-
up capital of three-and-sixpence, more or less.
Nob a word did Purves say concerning “ gross
dishonesty ” at that time. Certainly his par-
ticular client was bub a small and youthful
marauder, who didn’t know much better.
STevertheless, The Bulletin can’t forget that
the cruelty of the Crown prosecution reduced
poor Purves to absolute tears.
Who, in Victoria, could be safely trusted with
the control of a State Bank? The “ cronk ”
gang would soon have hold of the manager
and directorate (if the manager and direc-
torate didn’t belong to the gang in the first
instance) and they would suck “ temporary
assistance ” from the State Bank for their “ sol-
vent ” banks and building societies until the
country collapsed under its burden of Government
debentures issued to keep the game going. At
the expiration of 10 years of “ inadvisable
clamour” the Slate would make a hollow pre-
tence of prosecuting its own bank. A long
succession of Attorneys-General would carry on
the question of considering whether the evidence
warranted any further proceedings in the
matter, and when it came to the A.G. who was
fairly cornered into saying “Yes,” there would
have to be an adjournment of another 10 years
whilst Theodore Fink was preparing satisfac-
tory evidence for the defence. In the mean-
while Fink would call upon the newspapers to
suppress all ungentlemanly comment, and by the
time everybody concerned was cold and dead, all
necessity for a prosecution would have passed
away. Furthermore, the rats would have eaten
the books of the State Bank during the decades
when the institution was closed by Royal
Proclamation in consequence of the panic.
The suspension of the City of Melbourne Bank -
coming after the Brisbane and Sydney failures
and the “ home ” runs on the two Chartered
Banks, should finally convince anybody who
needed convincing that the combination of
political with financial scandal in Victoria has
brought Australia to its present pass. The
Parliament which allowed the Siiiels Govern-
ment to exist Just so long as it would do nothing
in the notorious Davies and Munro matters,
sowed seeds of panic in Great Britain as well as
on its own soil. And now the harvest is be-
ginning to be reaped. Englishmen and Scotch-
men do nob draw nice distinctions between the
different divisions of Australia. If is enough
for them that the name of the country has a
bad smell in the money-market, and when their
deposits in any Australian bank fall due they
will promptly run to catch them. They will
presently begin, also, to howl for the liquida-
tion of every bank or society which closes its
door for a minute on sixpen’orth of British
cash ; and Australia having acquired the vice
of making a constant convenience of the foreign
pawnbroker, will become as wretched for a
time as a Chinaman suddenly cut off from his
opium. All because Victorian public life has a
cancer on the soul.
New South Wales Railway Commissioners, in
carrying the Mary M ; Whannell case, in which
they were cast in £3OOO damages, to a court of
appeal, may have acted rightly while there was
a doubt as to contributory negligence, but now
that all counts of appeal are disallowed, save
that of “ excessive ” damages, the country
should have a voice in the matter. The child
M‘Whannell has had her leg amputated in
consequence of the collision, and the jury-given
sum of £3OOO is not “excessive” for such a
mutilation. The Commissioners have fee’d
Salomons, Q. 0., and other high-priced people
to argue for the cutting-down of the amount,
or, rather, the fees of these will come out of Hie
public purse; and the public, it appears, must
simply stand by. Mr. 'Eddy draws as much in
one year’s salary as the jury gave the girl for life!
The smellful case of a certain prosecuted shepherd
cropped up in the magisterial squabble re the
Matthew Davies case: “You are the J.P.
who went on the Bench for the first time at
South Melbourne, and there acquitted a clergy-
man,” said M'Donald, J.P., to one frenzied
Justice, “I can leave the public to judge of
your presence here.” Whew ! The Bulletin
offers no opinion as to the merits of this particu-
lar case, but as the honorary J.P. system is one
which fairly stinks with corruption it should
be at once and for ever abolished. Higin-
botham’s memorable opinion upon the matter
was explicit and incontrovertible. Let anyone
cast his memory back to the unspeakable scan-
dals which obtained in Sydney in the days
when the licensing system was administered by
“ unpaid ” beakdom. The hideously disgrace-
ful things w hich happened in Sydney then, are
happening every day at the shameless Melbourne
magisterial rolls-up.

84G Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
2 t’i May’ 1893.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The Sydney Fresh Air League ball is given up.
The Acting-Governorcss blocks the way. She
“could not conscientiously attend a hall during
this season of depression;” but one would think
that a charity ball was a horse of another colour.
And if these are acting-vice-regal sentiments, it
seems passing inconsistent for Chief Justice
Darley to patronise a race-meeting in the said
season of sack-cloth.
I am afraid, from what I read in the papers,
that “the lodger” kills a married woman more
often than her husband does. The “old man”
gets resigned to his fate. No, that isn’t it quite.
The husband will not live with the lady, and the
lodger can’t live without her. “Let us part,” she
says, and immediately the inane locum tenens
commits murder and suicide, where the lawful
possessor says, under the circumstances, “You
bet!” “ How like is woman to a bank deposit !”
said a man to me the other day. “If you can
claim her at any time, you don’t want her. She
would be a troublesome thing to have about the
house. But if she threatens to suspend payment,
you must have her, or shoot somebody.”
The interprOiVinciai tennis tournament (Victoria
v. N.S. W.) on the Association Ground last week
drew fair houses. The lawn-tennis girl has deve-
loped. She has shortened her skirts by a double
reef (I am taking a pretty girl in pink cotton for
a model), and even when in repose, with her feet
at the angle of an extended step-ladder, the
observant observer knows all about the clocks on
her hosiery. When under these abbreviated con-
ditions she lashes out viciously, the blushful youth
is advised to look the other way. And the
“serpentine” effect was a novelty this tourna-
ment. X leave it to those who observed the play
to say how it is produced.
In “Walker, London,” at Sydney Criterion, I
Xiked the natural way in which Emma Temple
smpked a, cigarette. The average actress smokes
(on the stage) as if the moral code were crumbling
to dust and the Ten Commandments staggering
in their stride with every whiff—but Miss T. sug-
gested none of these things. By the way, what
ail amount of hugger-mugger seasons “ Walker,”
which is a farce of the moment, and probably re-
flects modern English life on the Upper Thames !
Society at ’Ome must be very tenderly sympathe-
tic jupt now, especially to a pretty woman or a
man with a silky moustache.
In “The Late Lamented,” at Sydney Criterion,
Emma Temple, certainly the best-attired charac-
ter, dressed Mrs. Webb very Parisianjy. The
only fault I found with her was that she didn’t
change her foot - wear. Fawn slippers with
diamond studs are very charming, but when a
lady twinkles them for three acts, you are re-
minded of the doll of your infancy which took off
everything but her painted boots and socks. Miss
T. only sported two dresses : a yellow silk covered
with closely-spotted cream muslin, and made with
yellow door-knob belt and cream lace fixings,
black velvet hat trimmed with yellow silk and
black jet wings, long Su&de gloves ; and a dove-
colour silk trimmed with lines of green velvet on
the skirt, the bodice modishly glorified with
Maltese lace, and a butterfly bow of green velvet.
Mrs. Brough, as Mrs. Crosse, although personally
charming, was not so successful in her choice of
frocks.
The circle had one or two points of interest. A
well-known society belle sported a bright pink
opera-cloak, cut something like a full-blown rose ;
a young lady in blue with a “ titled ” chaperone
wore a very thrifty bodice. It looked like a hold
attempt to cut a jacket out of a postage-stamp,
and the result was most anatomical. By the way,
a well-known judicial official enjoyed the play in
an ogre-ish manner—leaning forward and working
his jaws as if gobbling the production on toast.
The only sartorial incongruity I saw in “ A
Million of Money,” at Sydney Lyceum, was the
saucily-worn, spiky-feathered hat in which Miss
Watson avers that she has “ vainly tried to live
down calumny.” No woman ever yet set out
successfully on the thorny path of moral recon-
struction with her hat hanging on her left ear, so
I don’t wonder at her failure one hit. Otherwise,
Mi ss Watson was a very consistently-dressed
adventuress—her most becoming frock being a
heliotrope and silver brocade ball-gown trimmed
with bows of pansy velvet. Pretty Mrs. Bland
Holt, in her usual character of stage sunbeam,
came out very strong in the Epsom scene in a bell
skirt of purple Bengaline, beautifully cut, and
Toreador bodice of violet velvet, trimmed with
gold galon and full front of fire-fly embroidery—
-1830 bonnet. Her last get-up, a black velvet tea-
gown, with front of gold and silver gauze ; the
frilled lizard-like sho ikler-flounces lined with
yellow silk, finished by novel shakes of gold lace-
work, was very modish. Miss Maud Williamson
looked best in the lively Epsom scene, when she
wore a white brocatelle, Frenchily trimmed with
brown fur.
Regarding the startled shriek of Sydney society
over the recent marriages of two well-known
youths with a couple of smart barmaids —I must
say I really don’t quite see the propriety of the
howl. Society holding up its fat, white hands in
a did-you-ever attitude over the marriage-certifi-
cate of Hebe looks to me like society defying its
grandmother or some other female progenitor.
The number of ex-barmaids who write their names
with a fine flourish in vice-regal visiting-books all
over the continent is legion, and the admission of
two more into the social ranks is really of small
moment when you come to think it over.
1 have received a novel, “ Mrs. Danby Kaufman
of Bays water,” by an Australian authoress, whom
I will not name till she gives a better account of
herself. “Mrs. D. K. of B. ” is a story which
alludes to “ the rank and fashion of Victoria” in
a reverent spirit; also, it is a book in which the
Melbourne Cup is run before lunch. Discrepancies
of this kind and other drawbacks make “Mrs.
Danby ” not exactly the novel of the season.
'The cruel reduction of General Jinks and staff
by an unfeeling retrenchment party drew an ap
prehensive crowd of elaborately-dressed women to
t he ladies’ gallery in N.S.W. Legislative Assembly.
The gloom on the beauteous faces as screws and
“allowances” were whittled down was simply
fog-like. The lion’s share of the gunpowder vote
must surely have gone into the undiscoverable
pockets of my interested sisters, for whom re-
trenchmenttneans sausages and bottled beer instead
of turkey and champagne.
Remorseless official people who go about asking
each other personal questions for statistical reasons,
get some amusing glimpses of feminine dodgery
when it comes to the age query. For instance, a
skittish mamma and a Puritanic daughter were
coping with the census fiend during the last
ordeal, and the crisis came, as usual. “Your
age, madam?” asked the inquisitor. “Thirty-
five,” simpered mamma. “ And yours, Miss ? ”
“ Oh, I am forty,” sniffed the damsel with blight-
ing emphasis.
I hear that the students at a large sectarian
college near Sydney-especially the had little
students who-want birching—have an ally in the
Principal’s wife, who cannot endure to have them
flogged. Four bad youths went up to- get their
reward, the other day, and when they emerged
she, almost sobbing, gave them each a buttonhole

I read in a Hobart paper’s news of the day (or
rather on a specially-printed advertising slip con-
taining a news-extract from the paper in question)
“ His Excellency the Administrator entertained
Mr. Walter Bentley and a select party to dinner
at his private residence. His Excellency the
Administrator has signified his intention of being
present at the theatre,” &c., &c. Now, tell me,
v hat does the nauseous advt. suggest to you, if not
this top*y-turvy paraphrase: “ His Excellency
has entertained at dinner a long-haired actor-man
and an otherwise select party.” Mind you, I don’t
make the paraphrase, which at once suggests
itself to everyone.

Another victim to the infallible Raven Hair
Restorer!
A cricket match between the Lyceum company
and the N.S.W. Artillery came off at the Barracks
last Thursday, the actors going out in “Million of
Money ” style on a four-horse coach. As usual, the
most correctly-attired cricketer on the stage side
—the one with the immaculate flannel pants and
the dazzling shirt—got bowled for a duck before
he had time to warm the wicket. ’Twas ever thus
—the infallible hall-mark of inefficiency is a rush
of clothing to the figure.
Talking about fog-horns (though I really don’t
think, I was), the first night Lady Carington spent
on Australian soil she was much surprised at the
screaming of a “ syren ” on the harbour. It was
Lady C.’s only little story, and a very mild one at
that. “Bob asked mein the morning whether I
had heard the kangaroos howling round the house,
and do you know ” (she would say innocently) “ I
really believed him ?” But if Bob, had only said
the racket was the baffled shriek of Potts Point
trying to force the front door, he would probably
have been an undiscovered wag to this very
moment. It would have been so hideously
probable.
While young feminine Australia is gazing ’Var-
sitywards in the silly notion that the short-cut to
a man’s affections is rid his understanding, and
not his stomach, advertisements like the appended
crop up in the Sydney papers :
TKIARD and RESIDENCE.—A Gentleman, tired
-*-* with seeking, is wandering about in search, of a,
HOME. Could be comfortable with a widow or single
lady who could serve other than overdone chops for
breakfast. Address, Homeless, Daily Telegraph
Office.
This poor man doesn’t want to argue on Darwinism,
or have to hold his own on the subject of bi-
metallic currency ; he only wants cookedi chops.
That ought to be the excelsior of the average
woman—cooked chops. If the noble standard of
cooked chops were flown in many a home stuffed
with single daughters, instead of the flag of piano-
thumping and fancy-work, the occupation of the
priestess of rechauffe would become extinct,
I hear that what promised to be a very interest-
ing breach-of-promise-case, between a septua-
genarian (ex-Civil servant) and a St. Kilda
lady connected with one of the leading R.C.
families of Victoria, has been privately settled in
favour of the lady for <£soo and costs.
It was when the relieved Jack-tars were getting
aboard the Orotava at Sydney on their way hack
to Rule Britannia that this pathetic scene hap-
pened. The wharf was filled with the lasses who
are left in every port, and one of them carried a
pledge of affection in her arms, “ Good-bye, me
darling!” said Jack to the lady carrying the
olive-branch. “Good-bye, Jack,” sobbed she;
“ but wotever am I to do with this dashed thing?”
N.B.—The attention of ladies who make a hobby
of Little Bethel is politely directed to this anec-
dote.

Brough and Boucicault’s new comedy,
“The Late Lamented,” is a piece with an old and
conspicuous moral, the burden whereof is that the
fat, sanctimonious man can’t be trusted, for there
is duplicity in his grease. The Lamented himself
is dead ere the comedy begins, therefore he does
not appear in the flesh. Bub ho has left two
widows to mourn ins loss, Both of them marry
again, but both continue to snuffle dismally over
the good man’s grave, and plant flowers thereon,
at which both their husbands feel rather bored ;
and both preserve the picture of the deceased,
which is hung up conspicuously in the drawing-
room. This, by the way, is a feminine peculiarity.
You don’t find men parading the portraits of their
dead wives before their new wives. When a
fellow’s wife dies he buries her and there is an
end of the matter. The Late Lamented is exceed-
ingly like Thomas MTlwraith with his face
covered with dough. The two ladies live
in adjacent flats, therefore it is obvious that they
must one day come in collision. The natural result
is that the Lamented’s reputation utterly goes to
pieces, and both his widows jump furiously at his
portrait, which becomes a discredited oil-horror,
and a thing to be sold by auction without reserve.
The comedy is of French origin ; the dialogue is
distinctly French—particularly in regard to a
certain item concerning a bedstead “full size;”
and Mr. Brough says “damn” on no less than
seven occasions, and denies once that he said
“dash.” It is a sparkling production, with
several powerful situations, and about the best
feminine comedy part The Bulletin remembers is
that in which Mrs. Brough revels. Titheradge has a
lamentably small character as a friend with spasms
and a jelly-mould on his head. Boucicanlt’s damp
and wretched butler, however, makes up for many
things—even for the waste of Miss Brenda Gibson
whom some Vandal has turned into a cook with
practically nothing to do except fail to find Mr.
Brough’s hat, and for the “damn,” and in some
degree for the bedstead. And possibly the “ Late
Lamented ” is one of those comedies which would
be stale and unprofitable if the “ damn ” were
omitted; and at the worst the audience can
always look blankly unconscious when it bears
about the bedstead.

& ‘ Slaves of Sydney ” came to an abrupt
but not premature end at the Royal, last Friday,
its death being an awful example to the dissipated
melodrama which goes wrong when it is young
and remains that way when it grows old. The
“ Green Lanes of England,” which arose in its
stead, is a good deal lessjrauddled than the late
lamented production, and does not look so much
like a pork-created nightmare or an opium-dream.
Mr. Dampier’s Gentleman George is a character
whom it is always pleasant to meet, despite the
said George’s constant desire to recite the “ Charge
of the Light Brigade”—an awful and Bullish
piece of verse which ought to get a long and well-
earned rest. Mr. J. H. Rainford’s red, corn-fed
parent k about as gratifying as that unavoidable
evil can be, though The Bulletin would very
much like an angular and bony father for a change;
and Mr. Plimraer, who is settling down to be the
chronic villain of the company, is a rather pleasant
kind of villain, inasmuch as he never laughs the
hollow, mocking laugh of the profession—that
dreadful cacophonous cackle which advertises the
bad man just as the yell of the Cochin-China hen
does the advent of a fresh egg. As for Miss Lily
Dampier, her old fate has overtaken her once
more, and she puts up with it with the grace that
is born of long practice. For the five hundredth
time or thereabouts she is thrown out and cursed
by her heavy parent,, and goes weeping into a cold
and horrid world.. Miss Dampier has been
thrown out in this manner by eighteen different
fathers, who have thrown her an aggregate dis-
tanee of seven miles, and, in common justice, The
Bulletin thinks she ought to throw out the
father now for a change. The spectacle of the
stern, bass parent being ejected in his top-boots
would be a refreshing variation.

Sydney Gaiety, once a steadily prosperous
little theatre, but nearly forgotten of late years,
was announced to re open last Wednesday—just
too late for notice in this issue—with “Rip Van
Winkle,” Mr. George Dean Doing boss and high-
priest of the show. Mr. Dean, like the Gaiety,
has been partially forgotten in Sydney through
long absence, nevertheless he used to have a repu-
tation which would float a much worse company
than the one he brings along with him, and a
much worse opera than “Rip Van Winkle.” His
last appearance at the Gaiety was when that
memorable but awful Arnurrikan lady, Miss Dora
Wiley, closed up her show abruptly and wont into
frantic hysterics on the back premises, and Mr.
Dean’s efforts to keep order in front, where the
audience wanted to wreck the house, and, at the
same time, to resuscitate the insensible lady
behind, are still favourably remembered by many
people who got their money back.

‘•‘East Lynne,” at Sydney Her Majesty’s,
if it has done nothing else, has at least demon-
strated that Miss Lilia Wilde may yet become a
great actress. A lady who can play Lady Isabel
without being in the least degree ridiculous, and
without ranting or sniffing dismally over her
fallen fortunes, and yet please the gallery which
came expressly to hear her rant and sniff, has lots
of possibilities before her. At the same time,
there is a certain holy joy in the knowledge that
“East Lynne” will he no more after this week,
and its place will be taken by Charles Reade’s
“ It’s Never too Late to Mend.” The gorgeously-
prssented “A Million of Money,” at the Lyceum,
is also doing its last nights.

Mr. Rickards, at Sydney Tivoli, made a
greater effort than usual last week in considera-
tion of Victoria’s birthday, and the audience
acknowledged his endeavours by consistently re-
calling him seven times each night, until the brim
of his shiny hat was worn to a state of excessive
flabbiness with much salaaming to his admiring
constituents. *

with cheering r.eft&Ugk Although the libretto is

however, and the composer also seems to hav«
reconstructed his score on sound principles. “Thu
Vicar of Bray ” is an opera of clerical and Sunday,
school interest, but its sentiment is worldly, and
its behaviour riotous—suggesting a Young Men’s
Christian Association on the razzle-dazzle. Bor
instance, the chorus to one song is an unctuous
parody on church music, the last word being
intoned with all the solemnity due to the
“Amen” of psalmody. The name-character
consents for a time to have his views
broadened by a corps de balfct, and becomes
the moving spirit in a church-and-leg
facially, he resembles the cherubic Dr. Bevan’
but, in other respects, he goes much further
than that excellent man. His dancing leans
towards levity, and his fatherly love for the ballet
is saddened by memories ot the dear old time when
they wore their skirts shorter. At tire outset the
Vicar so shocks his curate, Henry Sandford, that
the earnest young evangelist bids farewell to the
Sunday-school children, and drops a tear on the
lady-teachers, before going far away to convert
the heathen. Ultimately, Sandford returns to the
Village of Bray in a more secular frame of mind.
Having been himself converted by a well-meaning
cannibal, he has abandoned the pernicious prac-
tice of talking in rounded periods, Also
before he went abroad he had religious scruples
about; kissing the Vicar’s daughter ; but now
ho hugs her to their mutual satisfaction.
A bevy of other curates, demoralised by the sur-
roundings, offer their cold, flabby hands in
marriage to the ballet; but, being refused by the
leg-artistes, who evince a preference for some
pedestrian fox-hunters in scarlet coats, the curates
fulfil their destiny by taking the lady-teachers.
Then the vicar returns, like a lamb that has
strayed, to the elderly embrace of a certain
widow, and the entire opera subsides into the
sacred bonds of matrimony, with the exception of
the infant Bible-class.

The climax is ineffective, hut the show,
taken altogether, is lively, and contains many
droll bits of business. In a musical sense,
“The Vicar of Bray’’ is the antithesis of
“The Mountebanks.” Its melodies are simple
and pretty, rather than vague and “ graceful.”
The new tenor, Joseph Tapley, was a success,
vocally and otherwise, in the character of Sand-
ford. There is something of Percy Lyndall about
his curate impersonation, but his manner is more
sterile than Lyndall’s; he has a good quality of
voice, and, when he sings a descriptive song, not a
word is lost. As a stage-lover, Tapley promises
to take precedence of the beauteous Eyley— in
fact, the latter, who has had a long monopoly of
female affection, may be Said to have sat in the
dress-circle to witness his own funeral on Saturday
night. It is a world - wide, world - old rule
that when the handsome tenor comes in at
the door, the baritone has to fall out of the
window, as far as the female portion of the audi-
ence is concerned. George Lauri scores again as
the Vicar, particularly in the dancing department,
Clara Thompson comes well to the front as a giddy,
girly widow of advanced age; while Florence
Young sings well in the part which Effie Clements
did not stop to perform. Howard Vernon strug-
gles unsuccessfully with a stupid part; and Violet
Varley has little to do, except to dance, Violet,
however, is the one member of the ballet who can-
not dance; fortunately, the others supply the
deficiency, and the occasional tripping on of the
girls, after the style of the fairies in “lolanthe,”
gives the necessary touch to the ensemble. Goatcher
has painted two beautiful rural scenes.

Melbourne Opera House, otherwise the
Alhambra—and why Alhambra nobody knows—
still gets along as well as can be expected at the
price. A variety show that has any sort of in-
clination towards ballet must go to heavy expense
if “legs” are to be done properly, and a music-
hall tariff would barely stand the financial strain,
even if the house filled every night. The Alhambra
does not fill every night—with an accent on the
“ not.” Sometimes it presents the hopeless
appearance of one that has tired of struggling
against adversity, though on Saturdays the case
usually looks more hopeful, and the back benches
smile again. At present the first part is played
down to the waning craze for Football, the show
being advertised to kick off at 8 p.m.

At St. George’s Hall an intrepid crowd of
strangers, known as the Crook-Lyle Comedy Com-
pany, made a first attempt on Saturday in “ The
Strategist.” The avowed purpose of this affair is
to supply 1000 laughs in 150 minutes, and a notice
is cautiously withheld. The Gaiety has given
itself over to Professor Hoffman’s mind-reading
entertainment. Another professor is giving
“manifestations” at the Waxworks, each pro-
fessor being emphatic in his opinion that all other
professors are mere vanity and sounding bras>.
Promenade concerts at the Exhibition have been
reinforced by Snazelle, who sings to the accom-
paniment of the time-honoured dissolving views
and introduces the well-seasoned story of the anti-
quated liar who defeated Bonyparty with his cage
eye. Gladstone Wright Stockwell, Miss LalU
Miranda, and Clara Mongredien, all old favourites
at the Exhibition concerts, are still to the foie.
Newcomers are Miss Beatrice Allison, and may
Sainton, a musical name. The “Jerusalem
Cyclorama is doing extra well, for the reason t a
it is a beautiful picture which seems to fit in W 1 ,
the prevailing tendency to humiliation an
prayer.

the national standard as poseurs. The whole cere-
monial reminded us of an occasion when, standing
in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, we saw a pro-
cession of men coming along, all solemnly attired
in black, with draped hats and scarfs, and bearing
an enormous wreath. All their countenances wore
looks of doleful resignation and great solemnity.
They advanced towards the statue of Gambetta,
and then and there poured out a flood of rhetoric.
After everyone had spoken twice, the wreath was
placed on the corner of the pedestal of Gambetta’s
statue, and, solemnly bowing to each other
with raised hats, the processionists dispersed, evi-
dently quite satisfied with themselves.
At Poverty Point.
Effle Clements paid £5O, they say, to be released from
her engagement with VV. & M. Her ideas about singing-
out at rehearsal clashed with those of the stage manager,
and her nerves being already shaken by bad news from
home she didn’t wish to shake them any more. Exit
Btfie.’ When Joseph Tapley tailed to turn up at rehearsal
on die Monday following the departure of his fair travel-
ing companion, it was rumoured, but, as events proved,
untruly, that he had gone overland to Adelaide, and
would also return by the same boat.
By the way, stage-manager Bracy knew very little about
..gw people being imported for “ The Vicar of Bray.” A
short time before Tapley arrived, the unsuspecting Bracy
had been trying over the tenor music of the opera with
Caron the conductor, and discussing the places where he
ought’ to “ take breath.” Wherefore, it is presumed that
his* breath was taken entirely when handsome Joseph
burst upon the scene.
Sarah Bernhardt is engaged, for five years, at the Paris
Vaudeville, beginning Sept.
A concert programme, of 1870, shows A. S. Sullivan,
now Sir Arthur, as pianist. He dropped the S. because
the initials made A.S.S.
Two amusing Melbourne successes are Lake’s Exhibition
of Pictures and Snazelle’s Alhambraic Sundays. Snazzy
was got at by some of the “ piebalders,” and induced to
issue a ukase recommending pianissimo applause, but
then the whole-hoggers got at him, and he made a
speech, inviting the fortissimo.
The warmth of Appleton’s reception, at his Melb.
benefit, was extraordinary. He was an indispensable
Melbourne actor 20 years ago, though somewhat hard,
jerky and stilted, and never of Titheradge’s calibre. He
would have become a barrister, but for his growing
family. We believe he came from Heathcote, as an
amateur, and somewhere about his first Melb. appearance
was at Coppin’s wooden Pantheon, Cremorne Gardens, as
Rodomont Rollingstone, in an old farce.
“Mr. Bellew was admirable as the perplexed husband,”
says an American newspaper criticism. Not his ordinary
r6le, you know.
T. S. Bellair died at Wagga a few days ago. After some
English stage experience, he came to Melbourne about
1858, when he was engaged by Dick and Fred Younge, in
their management of Coppin’s Olympic. He was in the
firm of Lambert, Vincent, Harwood, Stewart, Bellair, and
Hennings, which took over the Royal, when Holt and
Hoskins gave it up, as successors to Barry Sullivan. His
proper name was Prout. For many years he kept the
Pastoral Hotel, Newmarket, nob far from Flemington
Racecourse. Bellair was as stately a man as ex-Thespian
Pollock, of Her Maj.’s.
The mysterious disappearance of Miss during
the past six months has been explained, says a London
correspondent, and she is expected to be about again
within the next few weeks. During her enforced retire-
ment she has been residing in the South of France.
Mr. Edward Terry, who appears in Sydney shortly, is
an excellent actor of the old - fashioned school, and
founded his style on that of J. L. Toole. He is principally
remembered as one of the famous quartette (Nellie
Barren, Kate Vaughan, E. W. Royce, and himself) in the
Gaiety burlesques of 15 years ago.
Pattie Browne, says a gushing Bulletin correspondent,
has fairly “knocked ’em” in Pinero’s new play, at the
Court, and a great deal of interest will be attached to the
next piece in which she is announced to appear. No
stranger has made such a hit on the London stage since
Florence St. John took the town by storm as Madame
Favart, in 1879.
Amongst the newly-elected members of the Green Room
Club are Haddon Chambers and Frank Thornton. Over
60 names are still down for election. The club was founded
in ’77, and at first limited to 100 members ; out of this
little band of originals some 30 only remain—among them
Arthur Garner. The club now numbers 300, and is one of
the most flourishing in London. Irving, Bancroft, Toole,
Pinero, James, Grossmith, Righton, &c., were amongst
the founders.
Johnny O’Neill, Irish comedian, has so much respect
for his Mother Church that, when playing “ Con, the
Shaughraun,” he won’t say, “ The priest give you abso-
lution for that,” but renders it—“ A blessing for that.”
Melbourne Theatre Royal was hired for one night only
(24th) to produce Tom Taylor’s “ Ticket of Leave Man ”
£7O. Could any ghost walk under that penalty these
hard times ?
A Melbourne actress, subpoenaed as a wdtness in the
recent theatrical assault case, said —“ This is a better
advertisement than a divorce-case.” Opinions differ.
A Clifton Hill (Vic.) 8.0. priest insists upon previously
reading and revising the plays which an amateur dramatic
society proposes to perform. He objected in toto to
Michael Feeney in “ Arrah Na Pogue ” ; cut out the
whole of the great wake scene, and some of the “dis-
graceful lines” put in the mouth of Harvey Duff, in
“The Shaughraun ” ; strongly objected to the character
of Danny Mann, and altogether abolished Father Tom, in
“The Colleen Bawn” ; and wouldn’t hear of “Not such
a fool as he looks” being played at all.
A pleasant item is that Alf. Boothman and his wife
have become reconciled.
Thomas P. Hudson (Mr. May Habgood) announces that
he has dropped minstrelsy for ever, and will please be
known in future as a “ theatrical entrepreneur ” having
inaugurated the “Australian Bureau OoncertCo.” Madame
Antoinette Sterling is trump-card No. 1, but already
negotiations are proceeding with other celebrities.
The clever Tommy, in a word, has been gilded with
refined gold by his accomplished wife.
Simonsen, when travelling with the Italians, told the
Dunedinites that it was a nigger-show they wanted.
They did not like it, and when he tried them with the
colour they would not turn up. The co. only played four
nights with but a few pounds in the house at last.
Portraits of Snazelle and Miss Snazelle hang in the
vestibule at Melbourne Opera House as advts. for his
“Rational Sunday Evening ” entertainment. A few days
ago Snazzy' was seized by a horrible dread that these
portraits might seem to implicate his family in Frank
Clark’s variety show. He hired a fire-engine to rush him
down to the Opera House at full gallop and slapped slips
of paper across G.H.S. and daughter—“ Sunday Nights
Only.” The result is a growing impression that Bill
Adams has turned evangelist.
Melba, it is cabled, has been engaged for 22 nights in
South America in 1891. She is to receive 12,000 f (about
£480) per night. She has also been re-engaged to appear
ln London in 1894.
On the same morning that Effle Clements sailed for
England it was stated in Melbourne Argus that she would
a Ppear at the Princess’ on the following Saturday.
The localising of one song in “ The Vicar of Bray ” was
performed by the Princess’ resident poet, a chorus lady.
This fair bard established her reputation by winning a
prize for a Burial Poem in Melbourne Standard, and her
style is regarded as light and bright by the stage-manager.
They should now get her to compose a Hospital ballad,
with a skull-and-thighbone chorus.
Herman Mendelstam, of W.A., is in Melbourne, and
threatening to produce his original drama, “Dreaming.”
Julie Knight, the handsome Auckland contralto, who
scored so well at the Dunedin Exhibition concerts, is now
Mrs. Duncan T. Lawes, of Adelaide, S.A.
Sims said that Ibsen’s play, “ The Master Builder,” got
hold of him and “held him as in a vyce.” His colleague,
Carados, dramatic critic for the Referee, scornfully ob-

All over the play.
Prom Players of the Period: “With the advent of
Irving, culture killed conventionality and claptrap;
intellectual distinction triumphed over commonplace
dulness;and brain proved its superiority alike to the
banality of burlesque, the soulless splendour of spectacle,
and the mania and mouthings of melodrama.” It reads
like a hunk from that fine old literary democrat, E. W.
O'Sullivan, of the bell-topper and yellow boots. But the
advent of Irving evidently did not assassinate artfully and
artistically alliterative asininity.
Virginia Earl, when in Sydney, hurt one hand badly
through the explosion of a soda-water bottle. News now
comes from America that amputation has unhappily been
found necessary.
In Wellington (M.L.) has just been exhibited an auto-
matic electric piano.” The inventor lived for several
years in Christchurch (M.L.) under the specious guise of
a kindly-mannered man. He ought to be demanded deli-
very of by a frenzied populace, and solemnly boiled alive.
Fillis’ circus took £3250 in Dunedin in six days.
A London paper prints the once-famous Isidore Wer-
theimer’s epitaph ; “ The late Duke of Manchester prac-
tically died of music - hall mania, and now Isidore
Wertheimer, at the age of only 29, has succumbed to it.
Poor Isidore’s claim to fame (apart from the Dunlo
divorce-suit) lay in the fact that he was the most music-
hally ‘dude’ in London. He wasn’t a ‘chappie’—he
couldn’t live up to being a ‘chappie.’ His friends
called him a ‘ doode ’ or ‘ good ole Izzy.” His
enemies called him—unmentionable things. Isidore
Wertheimer lived in the music-halls and spent his money
on the ‘artistes.’ When he wasn’t at the ‘Pav.’he was
at the ‘Troc.’ or the ‘Tiv.’ Where the pale young
Polish Jew spent his days no one knew. Most folks
opined in bed. About a year ago Wertheimer was de-
clared bankrupt, and announced his intention of quit-
ting the *Pav.’ and the ‘Troc.’ for the Antipodes.
Before, however, this dread threat could be carried into
execution his grandfather, old Daddy Wertheimer, the
renowned bric-a-brac merchant of Bond-street, died, and
left the scapegrace £60,000. Upon this sum Isidore,
for a time, blossomed forth in longer frock coats,
shinier hats and huger camellias than ever. But his
constitution couldn’t stand it any longer, and he died—of
no visible disease except music-hall.”
Had the money been voted by N.S.W.
Parliament to Premier Dibbs for his trip to Eng-
land, the official assignee would have claimed it.
At all events, the Auditor-General and official
assignee would have spent it in law in ascertaining
where it should go.
The Austrian Grand Duke attended ser-
vice at St. Mary’s Cathedral (Sydney) last Sunday
and was given a chair all to himself. But he
didn’t look half as distinguished as Toohey, the
brewer. That gentleman, embossed with Papal
and other decorations, was taken by numbers for
the Imperial foreigner, and when some of these
enjoyed a near view of him they remarked to one
another: “He looks every inch a king ; ain’t he?”
At the Bank of Victoria's first reconstruc
tion meeting, the indignant Enabling, M.L.C., ex-
plained how the trouble had arisen. The bank
“held .£1,200,000 in current accounts, and when
Saturday morning came, and the miserable hounds
who wanted to save their paltry pence ”
Embling’s oration here terminated, amid “great
uproar,” and all Enabling could get in afterwards
was a highly injudicious admission that the “ gold
reserve” had succumbed to a run on current
accounts. An account current, seemingly, must
only flow one way—into the bank. If the tide
turns, over goes the show.
From a sermon on the Commercial Bank
of Australia failure in London Referee ;
“ The Devil did a fine stroke of business when he first
sent money into the world, and by money I do not mean
wealth in kind, or even gold and silver, but that vague
thing which 1 will call bank money, or the money of the
money market. This sort of money consists of neither
coin nor notes—it would need a political economist to say
what it consisted of ; it is something too impalpable to be
defined by the ordinary observer. Anyhow, this is the
sort of money which I regard as the curse of society,
because without it the accumulation of great fortunes
would be impossible. Perhaps I should make my mean-
ing clearer if I defined my pet aversion to be not money,
but finance. ... It is not money I inveigh against,
taking the word in its simple sense, but the practice of
storing values upon paper—in other words, finance, or
banking.”
The paper-made city man can snort at these
untechnioal remarks, but Australia ought to paste
the paragraph upon its soul, as an antidote to
those erudite lectures which “ experts,” like Gyles
Turner, have been wont to deliver upon the “ Art
of Banking,” or the “Secret of Finance.”
The Presbyterians wanted Palmerston to
order a day of humiliation for cholera, but he
said : “See to your drains.”
Redfern (N.S.W.) Council clerk writes
correctively, saying that Redfern’s recent muni-
cipal retrenchments included the reduction of a
■£4oo salary by 10 per cent, and of a .£l3O salary
by 5 per cent., and not vice versa.
When the Tongau Parliament opened it
was announced that 20 damsels would be picked as
waitresses; but the first 20 that offered were taken,
because the word went round that the rest of the
shoal of applicants would otherwise suicide.
The voluminous letters in -the daily press
signed by Vancouver Huddart, of Hud dart,
Parker, possess the rare quality of distinctive
style. Mr. Huddart was a constant reader and
profound admirer of the Daily Telegkaph during
the regency of F, W. Ward.
The Victorian section of the London Mis-
sionary Society jubilates over the fact that “it
has been calculated that China might be converted
to Christianity in 400 years.’’ It has also been
calculated that in that time the Confucian will
have scooped Europe, and have converted the
Caucasian into manure for cabbagee.
The publisher’s preliminary notice of
Francis Adams’ new book on Australia is that it
is “interesting and exhaustive,” and that Adams
believes “Australia’s future consists in alliance
with the mother country.”
Hopetoun has telegraphed “ humble com-
pliments to Majesty Queen upon engagement
Duke York.” He sent it on behalf of the Govern-
ment, and presumably charged it to the Exchequer.
Now, fancy the “country” being debited with
the cost of “ humble compliments.”
In ’BB, M‘llwraith, then attitudinising as
the chief of a “ National Party ” in Queensland,
swept the polls against Griffith with 45 members
to 27. Now, the undisguised syndicator MTI-
- commands a similar following, with the
difference that some of his real supporters affect to
be “independents.”
“Sir Galahad himself would have no
chance with a jury now,” writes a Melb. paper, in
justification of Grand Juryman O’Loghlen. This
is the genuine Melbourne newspaper logic. All
your juryman wants to do is to stick and stab a
banker—to get innocent, lamb-like Mat Davies
seven years. Wherefore the ordinary process of
jaw must be suspended.
Some half-dozen Hebraic accommodation-
gentlemen of Melbourne, on comparing notes last
week, were painfully surprised to find that they
had each been landed with a “family heirloom,”
in the shape of “ruby” necklets of precisely
similar pattern. The lady raised from £3O to £5O
apiece on them three months ago (under pledges
of the strictest secrecy), to enable her to hurry
“ home” and claim a fat inheritance. The fact of
the stones being only ruby-garnets, and practically
valueless, w-as only discovered on one of the lenders
asking £2O advance on his security from a Mel-
bourne pawnbroker. There is at present a great
glut in the Southern ruby market.
“George Manton, recently arrested-for
the murder of Flora M‘Donald, at Marlborough
Station, admitted that he killed the girl because
she refused to marry him. He killed her with an
axe as she lay in bed. Manton then attempted to
burn the body as it lay upon the bed. The body
was considerably charred and the bed nearly all
burnt.” Such is love. The man who doesn’t chop
un the girl who has refused to marry him, so
as to prevent her marrying anybody else, simply
doesn’t love her. He may imagine he does, but
he doesn’t all the same. The man who unsuccess-
fully loves a woman and yet lets her go off alive,
is a failure as a lover—from a newspaper point of
view, anyhow.
If the Employers’ Liability Act embraced
the bantam officers of “ our ” Auxiliary Squadron,
someone would have to answer for the terrible
deaths of H.B.M.S. Lizard’s firemen, resulting
from an accident on the 9th May. As it is there
is an evident desire to get over the disagreeable
matter, and have it done with. The story, as
first told, was too blindly ridiculous to stand a
day: “It appears from the statement of the
officers that, after leaving Jervois Bay, the wind
suddenly veered round and drove the flames up
the furnace doors, thereby terribly burning
Brenchly, Gale, and Dawson.” With the Mildura
disclosures fresh in mind, and some idea of little
hells arranged for the firemen on the vessels of the
squadron by the forced-draught system, the
people are not likely to be satisfied without a full
and free investigation. Which means that they
are not likely to be satisfied, anyhow.
Victoria, by the grace of God, had a birth-
day this week, and in consequence the mails were
stopped (The Bulletin thus has to publish a day
earlier), almost every place of business was shut
up, the banks were closed, the railway service was
dislocated, and many thousands of people lost a
day’s work and a day’s pay which they could ill
afford, and consequently cursed Queen Victoria
from the bottom of their hearts. There is alto-
gether too much Queen’s Birthday and Albert
Edward’s Birthday in Australia. In Britain the
occasion passes almost unnoticed, and instead of
stopping all business, things go on just as
usual, and the inhabitants even shift the holiday
about to prevent it clashing with the local pig-
market, or any similar festivity. Probably it is
because Victoria is so far off that Australia suffers
from such a grovelling rfeverence for her birth-
day. The thing that is far off is always beautiful,
whether it is Victoria, or Heaven, or Paraguay,
or anything else. Someone has even been writing
of late about “Happiness in Hell,” which is
a case exactly in point.
Bibliographers everywhere, and a wide
circle of personal friends, will regret to hear of
the early retirement of Mr. R. 0. Walker,
Public Librarian of Sydney. The proceed-
ing will not be in consequence of the
retrenchment policy of the Dibbs Government,
but will result from the fact that the longer Mr.
Walker remains in the Public Service the less will
be his pension. It will be a severe blow to the
interests of Australian bibliography and history—
and the political and material interests of these
provinces are more closely affected by a wide
diffusion of knowledge respecting our past than
most people imagine—if Mr. Walker is permitted
to retire before his many years’ special research
and intermittent work are brought to a
conclusion by the publication of the great cata-
logue of the Free Public Library. The preparation
of the Melbourne Public Library catalogue has
been the work of a special staff, but in Sydney the
undertaking has had to be performed by Mr.
Walker, with the aid of his assistants, who are
chiefly occupied with the routine work of the
institution, and the Principal Librarian’s own
time has thus been trenched upon to an enormous
extent. The section of tne catalogue relating to
Australasia will pr;>ve of paramount importance,
and its issue is being anticipated with interest by
the librarians of the world.
A definite proposal has been made to th<
N.S.W. Colonial Secretary for the foundation oJ
a labour settlement, the average cost to the pro-

Bradley, the caricaturist, leaves Melbourne
for America. Mere accident took him into this
line, and it will readily be admitted that he is s
man of ideas. In Melbourne he has had little
opportunity of hitting out in accord with his
radical American sentiments.
Smith, temperance-lecturer, bald on top

A number of his satellites, who can only
hope for their own advancement by his resuscita-
tion politically, are going to give Parkes a dinner
at the Hotel Australia, Sydney, on Saturday
next. Theme suggested—the Raising of Lazarus.
P.S. —How long did Lazarus live after he was
raised ?
A sensational stock-broking divorce is now
on in Brisbane, one sporting stockbroker asking
that another share-man shall pay him .£lO,OOO for
being a serpent-in-Eden, while the alleged serpent
and the Eve both separately and collectively re-
pudiate the charge, and accuse petitioner of having
been up to his neck in illegal amours.
The publication by Francis Adams of
Griffith’s ’BB election manifesto, with its denuncia-
tion of land-grab railways and black-labour as an
appendix to “the Australians” by way of illus-
trating Australian Liberalism, is what the French
call “a bleeding irony” in the light of recent
events. But it was dme seriously and only shows
that Adams has already lost touch with Australia.
An American court has decided that if a
meteor falls on a piece of rented property, that
natural and sometimes valuable curiosity belongs
to the landlord, and not to the tenant. But it
hasn’t decided that if the aerolite hits the tenant
in its descent he can sue the landlord for damages
received from the landlord’s meteor, the same
being at large and wandering around without
proper control.
After years of fooling with infernal
machines for closing carriage doors, including
handles worked by the engine and bolts manipu-
lated from the guard’s van, the Vic. railways have
practically surrendered to a patent lock invented
by one Busby, a local engineer. The Busby lock
is a imple, economical affair, the door-handles
being the key, a double-catch and a single move-
ment admitting of no misgivings as regards the
boy who leans against the door with his head out
of window. It is intended to abolish the porter
who walks along the platform turning handles after
they are ostensibly all right. In this case the door
can t close without being securely fastened.
The attempt to drive female compositors
out of Maoriland newspaper offices, though under-
standable under all the existing circumstances,
cannot succeed, and would afford no advantage to
the trade if it did succeed. The open alternative
is to admit women to the typographical unions.
So far, the competition of women among the.
printers in Maoriland has so reduced wages that,
just now, a husband and wife, both compositors,
working in the same office, only manage to earn as
much together as a male compositor can earn
solus in Sydney. The fear of those who wool 1
exclude females from typist-unions is that so
many women would qualify for membership that
they would exert a majority vote and lower the
union rate of wages all round. Even with this
danger ahead, their admission is preferable to
their exclusion, under which they are now exert-
ing an outside vote (so to speak) and airing a
grievance which evokes public sympathy.
The cablegrams relating the peculiarly
Gallic welcome accorded in France to the returned
African warrior, Dodds, reek with a sour odour of
inverted manhood. “ The populace scattered
flowers in his path !” Why not blood-bedraggled
bullocks’ livers? Popular applause seems to be
the veritable breath of life to a large proportion of
humanity, though, in the abstract, it might be
imagined that a stern warrior, moulded after the
canons of Spartan simplicity, would just as soon
be hit across the mouth with a dead cat as
showered with rose-leaves. The scene must have
been anidealistical enlargement of a disgusting in-
cident witnessed in Sydney the other day, when a
fat, bald-headed old fellow, bidding farewell to an
adult male passenger by one of the Messageries
Maritimes boats, publicly and theatrically kissed
his friend fairly under the moustache.
The big libel case of Speight v. Syme is
looming amongst next month’s possibilities upon
the Melb. legal horizon. Mitchell, reckoned,
perhaps, the soundest common-lawman at the Vic.
Bar, was to have been Speight’s senior counsel;
but he has had to give up work and go on a health-
tour. Duffy, who takes his brief, with Coldham
as junior, will have an opportunity of renewing
the warfare carried on in the Clara Parker case
against Purves, Q.C., who holds a general retainer
for the Age. The mantle of Madden, who was
associated with him, and conducted the prelimi-
naries of the defence till his elevation to the 0.J.-
ship, will probably fall upon Deakin, who has
torn himself away from irrigation and Imperial
federation for the more lucrative practice of the
law, at which he is now flourishing.
Dear Bulletin, —I cheerfully plead guilty
to the charge of supporting the “ Australasian
Rights Purchase Bill” now before Parliament,
and only wish that all our “ natural opportunities ”
in the shape of city lots, coal-lands, harbour and
river frontages, &c., had, in time past, been
“ grabbed ” in similar fashion. The company
in question proposed to lease a “natural oppor-
tunity” in the shape of the water-power of the
Grose and Colo Rivers, leaving to the community
the right to re-assess the rental at fixed periods,
or to take over the whole of the electric power
plant which the company proposes to erect, after
the expiration of 15 years, at its actual cost. All
“unearned increment” in either case reverts to
the State. As this method of dealing with
“ natural opportunities ”• is precisely that which I
have consistently advocated for many years, I
offer no apology for the course I have taken. —I
am, yours truly, Fhank Cotton. P.S. By the
way,'it was “Jim Mooney,” not myself, who
headed the famous strike-procession in shearer’s
costume. —F.O.
THOSE MISERABLE HOUNDS.
We sing about the animals
Who, having scant belief
In balance-sheets and capitals,
Come slinking like a thief,
To steal away on Saturday
Their dirty pence and pounds,
As though a decent bank would pay
Those miserable hounds 1
Why do they want their money out—
Why don't they let it stand?
Why should they entertain a doubt
Concerning “ cash in hand ?”
Why can’t they close their canine ears
When Panic’s trumpet sounds,
Instead of giving way to fears ?
Those miserable hounds 1
If no one needed rhino “ for
To meet ” his weekly bills,
A bank would never shut its doors,
However bare its tills.
11 Suspension ” is a word unknown
Where confidence abounds,
But hear them barking for their bone !
Those miserable hounds 1
When broken banks begin again
To reconstruct their wrecks.
They ought to fix an iron chain
Round all their clients’ necks ;
And if the hungry, yelping pack
Grow troublesome —then, zounds 1
The masher clerks must hold ’em back,
Those miserable hounds 1

record for speech-making in S.A. Parliament, with
a little effort which lasted about 12 hours.
A Melbourne paper describes Clara Parker
as a “frowsy Circe ” who got at “Joe ” Clarke by
“pot-house incantations.” Yet to judge by
appearances “Joe” is a good deal the more frowsy

Two minutes after “Jack” Haynes had

weeps when he contemplates what sort of a clerical
failure he would have been.
Of the new S.A. Assembly, only 16 are

A Sydney solicitor, once a noted toper,
was converted to sobriety over a year and a half
ago, but, troublesome as lie was when a drunkard,
he is voted at his club still more troublesome and
disgusting on account of his insatiable gluttony.
The Maoriland Governor invited Premier
Seddon to lunch, and he went. “Rissoles” was
on the bill. “What are those?” asked Dick.
“ Eish-balls,” the waiter whispered. But you
must go to Maoriland to hear the rest of the
story.
The nonagenarian ex-Chief Justice Stephen,
of N.S.W., has been called to the British Privy
Council. That distinction appears to be reserved
for people who, upon the whole, have been toler-
ably clean ; whereas experience shows that any
dirty thief may be knighted or C.M.G’d.
The operation which proved fatal to
Pr emier Ballance is one which lias never yet
been successful in Maoriland. Every patient
on whom it was performed has gone under. Mr.
Ballance, for a few hours, promised to be the first
successful case* but he went the same way as the
rest.
Anderson Dawson* senior member for
Charters Towers (N.Q.), is 30, a native of Rock-

their “ Bush v. Town” controversy in The Bul l
LETIN columns.
J. H. Brooke, 30 years ago Land Minister
in Heales’ (Vic.) Ministry is now, and has been for
years, proprietor and editor of the Japan Herald,
a daily paper published at Yokohama. Brooke
was the author of the occupation-licenses under
the Land Act, and reserved Melbourne Royal

His Excellency Lord Hopetoun has
“graciously permitted” his name to be given to
a new rose raised by a Heidelberg (Vic.) nursery
gardener. The flower is described as of “deep
crimson maroon colour, with thick velvet on the

the bald-faced Governor with whiskers on.
Captain Jorgensen, the ingenious and
adventurous Scandinavian who invented a life-

G. D. Carter, the Victorian Treasurer, was
once lunching at the Austral m Club with John
Gavan Duffy and grumbled at what the waiter
brought him. “ Oh,”said Duffy, “you’d grumble
if you were in Heaven.” “I would!” promptly
replied Carter. “And what would the grievance
in Heaven be ?” asked Duffy. “ That you weren’t
there.”
Mr. Henry Halloran, once wejl-known as
N.S.W. Principal Under-Secretary and as a writer
of more or less graceful verses, died last week,
aged 82. Born in Cape Colony, he came to
N.S.W. in 1827, and was for 51 years in the
local civil service. A year or two ago, he
married, en seronde noccs, a young lady graduate
of Melbourne University.
‘The conferment of a Privy- Councillorship
on ex-Ohief Justice Alfred Stephen must be gall
and wormwood to Parkes. Every man called to
the Privy Council must be sworn in before that
body ere he is a P.C., and it is scarcely likely that
ex-Judge_Stephen will, in his 91st year, go to Eng-
land to kiss the book. As Dailey was not sworn
in, there is at least one unjudicial statement
engraven upon his tombstone.

broken heart. They say that the set who “ had him
in tow ” and plundered him right and left in his
palmy days, have now turned tail and left him in
the lurch. Morehead once said, in the Assembly,
that Pattison had a heart as big as a bullock, and
anyone who knows the crowd who professed to be
his friends can well believe the story.
The celebrated saying of Nick Fitzgerald,
M.L.C. (Vic.) about Money Miller is prigged from
Heine’s “Letters from Berlin”; “The merchant
has the same religion all the world over. His
counting-house is his church, his ledger his Bible,
his gold his God, his credit his faith.” These
purple literary patches are always cribbed from
somewhere. They shine out, like the big diamond
on the dirty finger of the old clo’ man.
A quarter of a century ago Ministers of
Education in Victoria said that Joe Geary was
the best inspector of schools (on paper) in the
service, Once Joseph was called to account for
not having been at a certain place at a particular
time. He replied that there were appalling floods
at Boggy Greek and he remained there a fortnight
to assist in saving the lives of Her Majesty’s
subjects. The explanation was “deemed satis-
factory.”
A FEW
OF THE BENEFITS CONFERRED
by the use of Wolfe’s Schnapps Ability to eat
with appetite, to digest thoroughly, and to under-
go moderate exertion without excessive fatigue.
The Bulletin perceives with much regret
that the open-handed Duke of Edinburgh has
been hard hit by the suspension of the Commercial
Bank of Sydney and by the failure of a London
firm. Could not a “Week of Self-Denial” be
proclaimed throughout Australia to help in re-
plenishing his coffers? The memory of his truly
princely generosity, when on this side of the
world, is still so green that the response would be
most hearty, especially as it is quite certain that
the Duke only invested money in the local bank in
order to encourage a deserving Australian insti-
tution and with no idea of drawing big interest
for his money.
Henry Scott Harden, solicitor, of Sydney,
broke the rules of the law-protected legal trade-
organisation by being interested in a trade-pro-
tection office, of which ostensibly he was only the
solicitor. The Supreme Court, acting ostensibly
in the interests of the public, but, from a public
point of view, merely in those of the lawyers’
union, which Harden had contravened by working
cheaply for his clients, ordered an “enquiry,”
the costs of which, <£94o, Harden, suspended from
practice for a year, was condemned to pay. He
has not paid them, and is now called on to shew
cause why he should not be sent to gaoh
Rupert Cariugton
is displeased at his
brother’s liberal parti-
tion of the family
property among the
tenantry, and implies
that Chamberlain
Chatles would be more
acquisitive had he a
son to follow on.
A large document
arrived in Sydney
lately by the Yankee
mail, addressed to
Parkes as Colonial
Secretary. It was
believed that it was
President Cleveland’s
tardy answer to the
Freetrade felicita-
tions of many months
back. When the pac-
ket reached “ home,”
however, it was found
to be a sheaf of poems
in MS , on which a
budding trans-Pacifio
bard solicited judg-
ment.
That lost prea-
cher, the Rev. B.
Smith, who left his
broken stick and
empty pocket-book in
Sydney Domain one
dark night some
months ago, and was
understood to have
been brutally mur-
dered, has turned up
inYictoria. Somehow
the vanished shepherd
whois believed to have
perished in the vine-
yard nearly always
does turn up thus.
The one absolutely
bewildering thing
about Parson Smith,
however, is that he
doesn’t seem to have
eloped with anybody.
The opportune re-payment “by some
patriotic gentleman” (in gold or notes?) of the
£lOOO unconstitutionally advanced by N.S.W.
Treasury to enable Premier Dibbs to_ take_ a
trip to England, may have some connection with
the fact that, just before leaving Sydney for
Europe, Mr. Dibbs refused to reeei ve <£looo
or so subscribed by friends who, knowing his
lack of means, desired him to accept it as an
expression of friendship.
Poor old murdered litigant Slack, who for
30 years bothered Victorian Judges by appearing
in person in “Slack agin Windher, yer Honor,”
and “ Slack agin Dounton, number wan, two, six,
five,” was succeeded by one J. J. Main. Main is
now in Sydney, and may be heard of soon by the
Full Court. He has been in most of the Victorian
courts, and his last (abortive) venture was to try
to establish a title to a big slice of Queen-street,
Melbourne, worth about half-a-million of money.
Respecting a recent Bulletin par. about
the discovery of Mt. Morgan (Q.), a correspondent
writes: “ Morgan does not disguise the fact that
he acted treacherously to his mate Gordon. The
Rockhampton men to whom Morgan’s brother
took the stone to be tested also acted deceitfully,
until Gordon was induced to part with his land at
the nominal price of ill per acre. Gordon’s
widow was left unprovided for, and she is now (or
was very lately) earning her livelihood at the
washtub. It would not be a very great stretch of
generosity if one or other of the Mt. Morgan
potentates allowed the poor woman a small
annuity. Will the Jimmy-Woodser millionaire of
that crowd take a hint ? ”
John Gale, teetotal potentate, ex-parson,
and ex-M.L.A. for the Mumnnbidgee, once more
thinks of wooing an electorate. Gale is probably
the oldest of N.S.W. country pressmen, having
made a competence-out Queanbeyan way long
before the advent of the railway. He is addicted
to poetry, and in his youth published a small
volume in England. Among the debris of the
awful Dunbar wreck washed ashore at South
Head was a copy of this little book, draggled,
salt, and stained, belonging to some ill-fated
passenger unknown, The author afterwards re-
recovered it, and possibly has it still.
In N.S.W. Legislative Council, the other
night, Mr. Jacob, M.L.C., wanted certain business
adjourned because his mind was “unhinged,” as
is unhappily the case with many other citizens, by
bank failures. Talking of unhinged minds there
is one old member of the same Council whose in-
tellect has been wandering for years, during
which he has still voted consistently against
everything in the shape of progress. He generally
dodders in sometime in the early part of the even-
ing, sits awhile with his rheumy, lack-lustre eye
fixed fishily upon the President, then feebly
gathers himself up like a man who collects a
skeleton, bows, and roams out in dead silence. He
doesn’t seem to know anybody, or to have any
idea as to where he is or what ho came for—he
simply gravitates there from force of habit, as
Wilkie Collins’ giantess used to gravitate to the
corner of the room with her cookery-book and
turn an imaginary omelette with a massive hand
in her dreams. A melancholy sight is this oil
member, and truly representative of an Assembly
afflicted with locomotor ataxy of the mind.
Pall Mall Gazette describes the defuu c t
Duke of Bedford :

He married at 21, and retired into ins shell? He hmi

and reckoning how much he had saved. After his succp
si on to the dukedom and the enormous wealth acconmanv
ing it, the passion increased as the means of gratifying it
had increased. His one absorbing thought was to save t

better perhaps than any other, described it, “like a wolf ’*
He was reputed to he the largest and heaviest feeder in
England. Those who have seen him eating say it was a
sight never to be forgotten. The duke Was very cornu

he was, would say, “A local preacher. Baptist or
Wesleyan.”

D. D. Wheeler, leader of Victorian Han-
sard staff, is to be retrenched as a sexagenarian,
and will be succeeded by E. B. Loughran, who
shines as a poet as well as a shorthand writer.
A letter-carrier in an Upper Darling town
costs N.S.W. Government something like £2OO to
prosecute for stealing a letter containing a 7s. 6d.
sewing-machine instalment. Yet none of the
daily papers howled about the “cost of the prose-
cution ” as they have done about the cost of pro-
secuting Matthew Davies.
Reconstruction.
The prompt acceptance of various schemes of
banking reconstruction is a cheering proof of the
restoration of public confidence in the solvency,
stability and future prospects of the monetary
institutions of New South Wales, and demon-
strates the fact that depositors have recovered
control of their reasoning faculties. The turmoil,
anxiety and worry, inseparable from the panic,
carry their own hygienic penalties—-nerves are un-
strung, strength is diminishing., and the various
organs of the body are thrown into chaotic con-
fusion. To reconstruct the nervous and muscular
systems, and rebuild afresh shaken constitutions,
recourse should be had to that wonderfully effica-
cious and widely-known remedy, Marshalls
Tonic Nervine—a proved “perfect panacea for
all disorders springing from lack of nervous
vitality. Mr. A. A. Blackwood, one of the oldest
and best-known travellers on the Western road,
writes from Dubbo, under date 7th May
Some time ago I used a botlle of Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine, and several since. Just bought another a
G raham’s. I never used anything so effective in renewing
vitality and appetite. I have recommended it to dozen ,
who are using it and state the same, although chemis
laugh at the idea as fancy; but their own quinine a
iron mixtures, which they substitute for it, nearly aiway
affect the head, whilst Marshall’s Tonic Nervine d
not. Unless the article was as I describe it, I would
lend my name to it.

Queen Victoria, seated on a golden throne*
presented her by some toadying Oriental nigger
with pipe-stem legs, opened the Imperial Institute,
the buildings whereof have now been “dedicated ’
by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Dedicated to
what? To a system of complex tyranny that
usurps many of the prerogatives of the Almighty !
To a thieving hierarchy that footpads the mean
savings of dissenting religionists! To the incubus of
royalty that bestra Idles all the smaller tyrannies,
and arrogantly sanctities its own and their plun-
derings with the double seal of snuffledom and
blasphemy,. and this while the gaunt millions of
London and Hull and all Englan 1 offer their
starving bodies to the bayonets of a hireling
soldiery in despair of earning the price of other
carrion. Can Heaven and Hell make a stronger
contrast of rampant magnificence and desiccated
squalour?

POLITICAL
POINTS
Positive, Duff; comparative, Patterson.
Premier Downer (0.A.) was much cha-
grined when Playford refused to join his Ministry.
Three of the new-elected Queensland
Labour members are high up in the 1.0.G.T,
order.
G. H. Reid says ho will accept the JN.b. U ,
Premiership if lie gets it without fear, favour, or
intrigue. L o fear,
Ulysses Dickson, M.L. A., will probably be
M‘ll wraith’s next Speaker, and ex-Minister for
Lands Cowley, Chairman of Committees.
The S. A. Labour members will vote solidly
against the Downer M nistry. The nomonfidence
motion will probably be tabled by Langston.
There is said to be wholesale plagiarism in
N.S.W. Parliament of speeches made in the
Parliaments of South Australia and Maordand,
A sure sign of the early downfall of
Downer’s National Ass Ministry is the fact that
S.A. Register is already preparing to desert
it,
Parkos, at Bingera (N.S.W.) “X have
always consistently opposed payment of members,
and if it were in my power I would repeal ttie
Hact to-morrow.”
Parkes is trying to persuade N.S.W. that
it regrets him, and that he only fell two years ago
through accidentally slipping on the political ice.
The old man’s political outlook is most mournful.
“THAT HATED NAME.”
Poor stilted soul cut off from light,
With Shoddy's base ideals content.
He glories o’er a pinchbeck knight
And scorns a nation’s President 1
In publishing the portraits of M’llwraith s
Cabinet, editor Fitohett, of the Review oe
Reviews, mixed up Nelson and Barlow, by
labelling one as t’other. Barlow feels flattered,
but Nelson contemplates libel % _
Let us encourage private enterprise !’
yells the daily Press, seeing the State in a finan-
cial agony. “ Private enterprise ” —it is the caw
.of the crow roosting on the branch whence it will
descend to pick out the sick man’s eyes.
The cable announces that the Primrose
League now has a membership of one million.
Possibly m another thousand years the Hebrew
lord with the plush pants and the oiled corkscrew
curls may be quite a respectable deity.
Dalrymple, M.L.A. (Q-), declined a seat
in the present Queensland Cabinet. He is a
ihungry-looking black-labour champion with brains
.and prescience enough to hear the death-kueu Qi
ATllwraithism, which is ringing even now.
A dozen candidates are on the eve of com-
peting ifor the North Melbourne seat, rendered
vacant by the death of Labour-member Wylhe—
three-fourths of them on the labour racket. Labour
cannot rely upon men who scramble for its
patronage.
In his pronouncement re the Mercantile
case, thus melodramatically Attorney-General
O’Loghlen; “I am prepared to accept the conse-
quences, even if they tear me to pieces.” Nauseous
rant! No need for any tearing. O’Loghlen, can
be picked to pieces.
Lewis Thomas, M.P. for Bundamba (Q-),
.coal-mine-owner, is a Welshman, and boasts that
when he arrived in Brisbane, years ago, could
only speak two words of English—“yes’ and
“no.” He can’t say very much more now. His
<,goal is the Legislative Council.
The S.A. National Aas toils hard to get
the workers’ names off the Legislative Council
rolls, and the Labour executive works just as hard
to get names on. The voting strength of the two
parties is remarkably even in the Central District,
which will be the scene of a big fight next year.
According to Premier Dibbs’ statement in
N.S.W. Assembly, the item of ,£lOOO for his trip
to England was withdrawn because some kindly-
disposed citizens had, unknown to him, paid the
amount into the Treasury. And _ nobody even
thought of asking whether they paid it in gold or
in notes.
A member of Parliament who is so often
at law over transactions prima facie shady, and
who is eternally escaping the direct effects of
smellful political jobs by the skin of his teeth,
must get into gaol at last. And when he does,
everyone will say, “ How like he is to the boy
murderer in the Waxworks !”
Premier Patterson announces that his
Government cannot join in any more schemes for
the benefit of Melbourne banks. The Govern-
ment, he finds, is an impotent friend for any
kind of institution to have at its back. As a
restorer of confidence it is not much superior to an
earthquake, he might have added.
The passages of abstruse philosophy on
the “ meejum of exchange” so eloquently marking
the N.S.W. State Bank Parliamentary Com-
mittee’s Report are mainly the workmanship of
Rose and O’Sullivan. The member who knew
most about money contributed least to the
elegance of the document from an oratorical point
of view.
From S.A. Register, June 17, 1890 :
Our own views on taxation are pretty well known, and
we need not repeat them here. The land-monopoly is the
only monopoly that need be feared, and the surest way of
combating it is by the fair and simple expedient of taxing
the land at a uniform rate according to its value.
And now what does the Register say ?
Cheers for Salisbury, loud hoots for Glad-
stone, and “Dr.” £ £ Smith, of Melbourne,
licentiate of the Apothecaries’ Society, London,
grovelling round with white satiu-and-gold cata-
logues for presentation to royalty. Such were the
disgusting concomitants of the official visit of
Prince Baccarat to the Imperial Institute.
“Private enterprise ! private enterprise !”
—that is now the cry in Australia during the
financial embarrassment of the State. “ Hand over
to syndicates great slices of the public estate, and
work will be given to the starving population.
The politicians, mostly up to their necks in the
swindles, put their tongues in their cheeks and
grin.
A certain Australian Treasurer is a spec-
tacle for gods and men when he appears in the
city streets among a group of bank directors, who
pat him on the back, smile at him, laugh at his
inane jokes, and, finally, hustle him into the bank;
while the Treasurer himself simpers like a young
maiden who has just received her first declaration
of love,
The Age, in condemnation of war !
The great army of Labour is organising in its might,
and is the sworn foe of the great array of War. It should
be cited as one of the world’s hopes, instead of one of its
terrors. ..
This probably is why Syme gives the Labour-
party in Australia such cordial and honest
support.
The Q.N, Bank, as already remarked,
smashed on the first available day after a
critical batch of elections. It gives MTlwraith a
chance to show that “ heaven-born financial
genius ”of which so much has been heard. His
worst enemy couldn’t wish him a deeper slough
than that in which he ia at present. How Lilley
and Griffith should congratulate each other !
When the Prince of Wales _ last week
visited the Imperial Institute (whose insolent gang
is being subsidised with Australian public money)
“ the assembled company ” cheered the Marquis
THRIFT.
THE BOSS: “Ah! as you stayed away all day, I thought you were ill."
DE JOBKINS : “Well, yaas, I’m nob quite up to the mark, but I can’t afford to lose my four-
to-six ovalitime, don’tcherknow."
of Salisbury and vigorously hissed Gladstone.
Hepoeforth, when any Imperial Institute vote,
however small, is proposed in any Australian Par-
liament, let the Democratic-party erect a stone-
The military estimates , .excited a lively
debate in N.S.W. Assembly ; but iqembers vainly
groped in the dark among the mysteries of pay
and “allowances.” Will it be believed that
officers are drawing £lOO and upwards as compen-
sation for quarters in barracks —two rooms tor
majors and officers above that rank, and one room
for captains and subalterns ?
“Members of the Royal Family should
accept office as Governors of the colonies,” says
St. James’ Gazette.—
Though heavy is the load we bear.
This notion will elate
The fools who think we ought to share
Those “burdens of the State.”
When. Fox moved in the Commons, nearly
a century ago, that “The influence of the Crown
has increased, is increasing, and ought to be
diminished,” lie did not think that the transfer ot
that influence from the sovereign to the Ministry
mffiht in time result in a practically irresponsible
despotism. Yet, that is the actual state of affairs
to-day in every Australian province. A Ministry
with a majority at its back can defy the law.
Why should nob the allotment that votes
be credited with its vote on the electoral-roll,
instead of the man ? Nothing would simp ify the
good work of roll (s)puritication better. Allotment
2 of section 3, parisli of Bmjey, could therefore be
nominated for Parliament by its fellow-allotments,
and receive its title in the ’Ouse as the Honourable
Allotment for the other allotments of Bmjey.
The Bulletin recommends the idea to MTlwraith.
Britain, according to latest advices, has
its eye on Beloochiatan, which it is considered
necessary to swallow because the Khan is alleged
to be a bad and cruel character who needs to be
suppressed. This is another step towards the
inevitable. Presently Britain, Russia, and China
will own Asia among them, with possibly a side-
show for France in the extreme South-west, and
then the three big empires will concuss against
each other somewhere on the Roof of the World
or thereabouts, with the greatest concussion that
has been heard since the Crusades.
The Pinaroo lands, which the Downer
(S. A.) Govt., with a great flourish of trumpets,
announced in its election policy were to be
opened for settlement, are located somewhere near
the Ninety-mile Desert. The Labour-members
assert that unless they can see this alleged Para-
dise they will vote against the waste of money
involved, and because they propose a personal
inspection by a Parliamentary party, the Govern-
ment, backed by the Ass members, shriek that
“ this is a pretty way to preach economy a
Parliamentary picnic.” The S.A, Labour-mem-
bers arc asking how long it is since this fit of
virtue came over a Government which recently
had to foot a bill for Jc 1500 for a useless Murray
picnic I
N.S. Wales Premier Dibbs’ recantation of
his political opinions did not take his Cabinet
colleagues by surprise. None of them ever believed
him a Republican, and the words uttered by him
giving colour to what they call the “ imputation
they regarded as a mere lapsus lingua. Before
Dibbs set out for England, Minister Slattery
offered to provide him with an opportunity of
defining his relation to the Throne, but the offer
was not accepted. Taken as a whole, no Cabinet
in Australia prides itself more on its grovel-
ling loyalty to Queen Victoria and the Empire
than the present one of N. S. W, Copeland is only
verbally eccentric, like Dibbs, on the topic, while
the rest bow solemnly down iq jfche Awful
Presence.
The law of the North-west Territory
(Canada) provides that the following things shall
be exempt from seizure for debt, except when the
judgment is for the price of the article itself.
Food, furniture and bedding, however, up to the
specified value, are free from seizure under all
circumstances whatever; —
1. Clothing of defendant and family. 2. Furniture and
household furnishings of defendant and family to value of
500dois. 3. Necessary food for defendant’s family for six
months, which may include grain and flour, or vegetables,
aiid meat either prepared for use or oq foot 4. Two
cows, two oxen and one horse, or three horses or mules ;
six sheep and two pigs, besides the animals kept for
food purposes, and food for salne during the six
months beginning' ill November. 5. Harness for
three animals, one waggon or two carts, one mower
or scythe, one breaking plough, one cross plough, one
set harrows, one horse-fake, one sewing-machine, one
reaper and binder. 6. Books of a professional man. 7.
Tools and necessaries used by defendant in trade or pro-
fession. .8. Seed grain sufficient to seed all land under
cultivation hot BO acred (2 bushels to alcre and
14 bushels of potatoes). 9. Homestead up to 80 acres.
10. House and buildings and lot or lots upon which same
are situated, up to the sum of 1500dol. in value'.
We need some such statute in Australia, if only to
prevent the country being swallowed whole by
the reconstructed banks. Let it be said again—
no credit should be given because of the lender’s
or vendor’s power to turn the debtor and bis
family out into the rain.

An ex-patient says (can it possibly be
true?) that as soon as the female convalescents of
a certain Sydney hospital are able to sit up easily
they are set to the pleasing and mirth-provoking
amusement of making shrouds. The woman who
makes most of those cool and cheerful-looking gar-
ments receives an “extra” of some sort —tea,
sugar or butter. But, after all, what employment
is more suitable and natural to a woman than
dressmaking of some sort, especially when the
article can’t get nasty and send it back as a mis-
fit ?

“ Captain Dodds, of the N.S. Wales
cavalry, is,” says the cable, “to dine with the
Marquis of Ripon.” Dodds is such a swell that
one would hardly expect him to dine with anyone
of lower rank, though it is rather rough on a
potentate of his principles to have to foregather
with a Gladstonian. But a Gladstonian Marquis
is better than none, and Dodds was not so lucky
as Dibbs, He did not find a Conservative Govern-
ment in power.

Queen Victoria admires the uniform of
the N.S.W. cavalry. It is not generally known
that this uniform was suggested by Capt. J.
Reid, late R. A., of Sydney. The Sydney authori-
ties let the suggestion rest for two or three years,
and then adopted it as their own.

State and Church conspire to bow down
before His Imperial and Royal Highness Franz
Ferdinand D'Este, heir presumptive to the Aus-
trian throne, now visiting Australia. The N.S.W.
Railway Commissioners have placed a special train
at his disposal gratis, and he appears to have
ordered at St. Mary’s Cathedral an “ Imperial
High Mass ” just as one might order liver-and-
bacon for breakfast. The plea, in at least the
former case, is that the Prince is “ a distinguished
visitor.” To say exactly what he is distinguished
for would be somewhat inhospitable.

Some of the daily papers have been talk-
ing for some time past of “the Archduke of
Austria ” —as if there were but one Archduke of
Austria, whereas their name is legion. Every
scion of the House of Hapsburg is an Archduke of
Austria, even to the fiftieth cousin fifty times
removed.
A case of “ spoons ”
Inuch in evidence on a coast-
ing steamer in Spencer’s
Gulf (S.A.). A waggish
passenger discovered that
they were going to get mar-
ried at the first port of call,
and he laid the skipper on.
The captain, in sheer awe of
Mother Grundy, offered to
marry the pair there and
then, . . . Done in one
act. . . . Then the wag
seriously informed the skip-
per that he had committed
an illegal act that rendered
him liable to heavy penal,
ties, but offered to see him
through at the first port by
persuading the “bride” to
get “the blessing of a church”
on her union. The scared
skipper, accordingly, at his
own expense, hired a parson
and had the pair married a
second time. . . But the
wag came again and advised
him to consult a lawyer as
to how he had best act to
escape theconsequencesof his
illegal conduct. And then the
child of Neptune paid a son
of Nicholas a fee in order to
learn with assurance that his
own performance of the mar-
riage-ceremony had been as
binding and legal as a
“ bodcomb fence ” —“ horse-
high and pig-tight.”

The inscription, “ All
meals, threepence,’’ grows
more and more common out-
side Melbourne restaurants.
The man who wants to make
a new departure in the city
of re-construction will have
to start a cook-shop where
all meals are twopence, with
a special halfpenny depart-
ment for the customer who is
willing to pick a bone on the
door-mat.
The following, from a Mildura (Vic.) cor-
respondent to The Bulletin, points several
morals :
Three pumpkins, a dish of tomatoes and a frilled knuckle
of ham, displayed in a window in the prohibitionist “ irri-
gation ” settlement of Mildura, are the outward and
visible signs of an inward and spirituous grace in the
back-parlour cupboard—whisky, 6d. a nobbier; “colonial ”
bottled Leer. Is. Cd. to 2s. a bot tle ; the margin of profit
being considered equal to the risk run of a big fine, with,
perhaps, three moons in quod. There isn’t a pub. or
barmaid in Mildura, but there are about 25 frilled-ham-
bone shops. Their business is considered off the regular
police “bate,” but the excise-officers contract periodical
spasms of zeal. A few months ago, 26 hamhoners were
fined £25 apiece, and some were sent to gaol as well, but,
within a week, the vacancies were filled, and the pumpkin
signals were out as usual. Then, after a nap, the excise
authorities s; nt up a dummy carpenter, who, in the guise
of a beery artisan, collected evidence against 19 more.
The prosecuted persons joined purses, and offered t'6o to a
Bendigo counsel to come and defend them. He came, but
preferred to stay at Gol-gol, on the N.S.VV. side of the
river, where there was a pub. His host made Gol-gol
so attractive that he stayed there while his clients were
being fined and suit off to prison. Those of his
clients who were ordered to Bendigo for change of
diet had to put in a night at the local lock-up, the ladies
among them being accommodated in the troopers’ saddle-
room* whereby hangs a tale. All this happened only a
month ago, but the tomato-shops are once more in full
swing, just as if there had never been any yesterday.
Mildura is one huge farce. It grows grapes, it makes
Wine, and it is proposing to distil brandy. Yet the local
winemaker mustn’t sell less than two gallons in any one
act, and brandy-shops are forbidden. Nevertheless, in
less than three months a local “agent” imported 450
Cases of whisky and beer. Mildura bibbers get all the
drink they want, but pay 50 per cent, more for it than
they ought to. If anyone talks about the need for a
decent hotel he is silenced as a reprobate. That is “ pro-
hibition ” in Mildura.
The Bulletin’s old question to the prohibitionists

The eccentricities of some Sydney charity
organisations. A hard-up woman came lately
before a board of philanthropists. Hard-up was
represented as being not alone hungry, but almost
naked. One lady undertook to satisfy require-
ments under the latter head, and sent
along a tailor - made dress of her own,
without any other garment whatever. Let it be
added that the Lady Bountiful is 4ft. Bin , and
slim in proportion, and that the poor, but honest
Hardup was sfb. 7in., and somewhat fuller tha 1

After exhausting deliberation, Kidman decided to
give fid. in cash, and 4s. fid. worth in kind. Still
again, a member of a board volunteered to be a
whole Samaritan in himself, and asked that an
unemployed whose case was under discussion
should be sent to his warehouse. The unem-

A perusal of Cast Away and Other
Poems, by Charles G. Bond .(published by
Turner and Henderson, Sydney) in poor-rhymed
■efforts and poorer blank spasms, carries the ver-
dict that, when the events which moved the lyre
are stale, even the best topical poetry reads like
the cooey of a lost bogie-man. Here is Mr.. Bond a
preliminary keen on the death of the Duke of
Clarence :
Bow low the head ! the glory
Of our land is darkened, the rippling streams
And woodland lights and cliffs and restless waves
Are darkened with the shadows of Azrael’s
Dreaded wings—even Nature dons her
Sorrowing mantle.
There is no more poetry in this, now that George
is going to marry the disconsolate May, than
there would be in a maintenance affidavit.

Divorce item, from our own co-respondent.
At Dunedin (M.L.) Mr. Gillfeld has been seeking
a divorce from his late wife —so-called, not because
the lady is deceased, but on account of her staying
out so late at night with another man. Accord-
ing to the evidence, the culminating point in the
troubles of this harassed pair arrived when Gill-
feld found another man in his garden at 1,1 p.m.,
and using huggy-huggy language to his wife
through the kitchen window. I hen the other
man, instead of wisely taking express and
flying from the scene, got into the witness-
box and tried to explain away this awkward cir-
cumstance. The following is the explanation
slightly condensed :
I was there watching Mrs. Gillfeld and the servant girl
There wasn’t any servant girl, hut I expected there would
be one that night. I knew the Gillfelds were about to
engage a servant girl, who, I supposed, would arrive on
the Friday or Saturday night. Mrs. Gillfeld had been
in the office that week, and 1 heard her tell Mr. Gillfeld
that she was going to engage a servant girl. I did not
know that she was going to arrive that night, but 1
thought I would go and see if she was there. I had no-
thing exactly to do with the servant girl, but I went
there to see if anything would happen to her. I oouldn t
see what was going on inside, hut then I didu t know
beforehand whether I would be able to see anything or
not. 1 was outside the window as a friend of the family.
If I hadn’t been there, there wouldn’t have been anyone
there. If Mr. Gillfeld had done anything to the servant
girl I should have interfered that very night.
The co-respondent who explains things too much
is generally lost.

The conduct of a Palmerston (M.L.) meet-
ing of creditors towards a local insolvent marks a
new departure in bankruptcy procedure. In this
ARITHMETICAL WRATH.
“Why don’t you hit him back?”
“Well, I promised mother that I’d always count a hundred when I’m
angry. But wait till I’ve finished counting—then you’ll see
things move around.”
c ase the whitewashee laid down .£3 on the table,
which amount he declared to be his sole assets.
But somehow the meeting viewed the statement
with suspicion, and proceeded to undress him and
go through his clothes, whereupon he panned out
for an additional sum of £G Bs. Then, while in a
nude state, he offered an unsatisfactory explana-
tion that the money was his wife’s private pro-
perty, and thereupon someone suggested that
the lady might also crush for a satisfactory
yield per ton if she could be examined before her
husband arrived home to give her warning. This
idea was accepted with acclamation, and the in-
solvent was detained while an official was des-
patched to interview his wife. The local paper
draws a veil over the horrors which ensued, but
presumably the wife was examined by two brawny
females and her clothes ripped up in search of
hidden wealth, while the male 'official looked for
buried treasure in the back-yard. The moral
is that the insolvent nowadays had better put
all his plunder into one big bank-note, and hide
the note inside the porous-plaster on his back.
And even then there is just a chance that the
official assignee may soak the bankrupt in hot
water till the plaster comes off.

Pastor George Lewis, who, in connection
with the Sussex-street Mission Church, Sydney,
gives the unemployed daily penny meals and free
Sunday breakfasts, and bns an idea of furnishing
them with penny winter “dosses,” crystallises a
fin-de-siticle, practical idea thus :
My ideal of a modern church is to have the basement
floor fitted up for such work as this (the feeding business),
the next floor for Sunday-school purposes, then the
church proper, and, above all, on the top floor, a sort of
hospital for the poor.
This is dreadfully heterodox. A “Church,” with
“society,” means bishops, silk-stockings, silver
buckles, broughams, deaconesses, vinegar-faced,
gimlet-eyed scandal-mongers, and the “respect-
ful ” hypocrisy of “ the lower orders.” What with
a belly-heaven beneath and a hospital-paradise
above, this “Church ” between won’t recognise its
identity.

Should threaten to open their innocent eyes ;
He sits well in front, to prevent an exposure.
And cheers to the echo a parcel of lies.
All things are right, though the case looks suspicious;
There’s nothing corrupt, and no person to blame ;
In a nice state of things the most truly delicious
Is wicked old fat man’s imperative “ Shame ! ”
Sinful old fat man !
Who will kill that man
With poll-axe or poison ; or put him to flame?
O, Fawkner and Batman,

Were natives like him when to Melbourne you came?
“ Shame I ” cries the fat man when pals are arrested.
And Justice appears to be flashing her sword.
He must have their innocence loudly protested,
Or else precious confidence can’t be restored.

Has won him a cheap daily-newspaper “ tame ; ”
He shines like a coal-box rubbed up with a duster—
That black-hearted fat man whose gag-word is
“ Shame! ”
Sinful old fat man 1
Who will, &c., &c.
“ Snarae ! ” cries the fat man ; and, whilst he’s permitted
To come to the fore in his armour of brass,
The land where he screams is a land to be pitied,
The Law is a rogue—aye, instead of an ass.
A cute, honest man, playing poker or euchre.
Is skinned by the party who cheats at the game;
And Melbourne is bossed by the fraudulent joker
Who hushes a swindle by crying out “ Shame I "
Sinful old fat man !
Who will kill that man
With poll-axe or poison ; or put him to flame?
O, Fawkner and Batman
Look down on the fat man !

200,000,000 Dollars Lost.
Seventy-five years ago Thomas L. Walker, then
r mere buy, planted four walnuts by the roadside
opposite Ids father’s house in the eleventh civil
district, near Cedar Bluff, and some ten miles
west of Knoxville. He died ten years ago, and
yet he lived to see four walnut trees grow up to a
measure of four feet in diameter, worth, if cut and
properly seasoned, at least 400 dollars each. Had
he planted 300 walnuts on an adjoining acre of
ground, his heirs, when he died, would have been
120,000 dollars better off. To-day they would
have been 200,000 better off. Had he planted ten
acres they would be worth 200,000,000 dollars.
Had he planted 100 acres, and all the trees had
reached an average size of three feet in diameter,
and there is no reason why they shouldn’t, as the
land is fertile and impregnated with lime, his
heirs, and there are only three living, would be
worth 200,000,000 dollars. If, like old Johnny
Appleseed, who planted thousands of apple trees
in the north-west, he had planted all the worn-out
fields in Tennessee in walnuts, it would be the
richest State in the Union by far. Thousands of
people lose their lives by similiar oversights, they
neglect the important warnings of nature, who
always gives timely warning of the approaching
physical disease. Sometimes it is a* headache,
sometimes neuralgia, toothache, indigestion,
constipation, or what not. Severally and
collectively they indicate that something
is wrong, and wise is he who takes time
by the forelock and has a course of Clements
Tonic, for that is a reliable remedy, as proved by
Mr. B. Simms, hotelkeeper, Charlestown Hotel,
Charlestown, N.S.W., who writes on February
13th, 1893 About two years ago I was a great
sufferer from derangement of the liver. 1 had shoot-
ing pains right through me, also racking head-
aches, a bitter taste, especially in the morning.
Having heard so much about Clements Tonic, I
resolved to give it a trial, and I am only too
happy to say with the most beneficial results.
Before I had finished the third bottle I was re-
lieved of all disagreeable symptoms, and gained
health and strength rapidly. I take it now as a
preventive, and recommend it to all my ac-
quaintances, hoping that they may derive the
same benefit that I have done.—Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Campbell Praed, in her new story,

this alleged Australian stuff: —
“ The mopokes all are laughing, and the cockatoos are
screamiiir,
And bright among the stringy-barks the parrakeets are
gleaming.’*
The gifted authoress says “ Lord Horace ” sang
with the manner of. one who knew what he was
about. But he evidently didn’t know what the
“mopokes ” were about, for mopokes never laugh,
and either they were out, contrary to custom, in
the daytime, or the naughty cockatoos were
screaming and the vicious parrakeets were gleam-
ing in the otherwise dark Australian night.

A strange tale of two undertakers and
only one corpse comes from Western Australia.
Some few weeks ago a man was lying in an almost
hopeless state in Perth Hospital, and a local un-
dertaker, hearing of this, hurried to the patient’s
solicitor and asked for the job of conducting the
burial. The solicitor suggested that the proposal
was premature, and shunted the hireling mourner
out of his office. Late that night, however, the
corpse-planter returned in a cab to announce that
the man had just died and that he was going to
bury him. He was referred to the executor, and
the "executor, who probably didn’t care for being
rushed by undertakers in the dead of night,
flatly declined, and stated that he had given the job
to another practitioner. Thereupon the original
coffin-maker announced that he was going to con-
duct the funeral anyhow, and an unseemly struggle
began for possession of the remains. Both under-
takers rushed round to the hospital and measured
the unresponsive clay. Both came round with
coffins ; but the unauthorised man arrived first,
and thus got the bulge on his enemy. The official
undertaker advertised that he would bury the
deceased at 3 p m., and the unofficial one, to get
ahead of him, advertised, in the same paper, that
he would bury him at 10 in the forenoon. Then
the solicitor interfered. The authorised hearse
and the mourners got to the hospital at 9 a.m.,
and when the other tradesman and his hearse
arrived an hour later the corpse was gone. Also,
his valuable brass-mounted coffin had gone with
it, and he can’t recover it by any means short of
body-snatching and sacrilege.
Why is it, asks a correspondent, that a
parrot picks up swear-words more quickly than
any other forms of speech ? Is it an argument in
favour of original sin, or only a proof that the
human vocabulary consists chiefly of curses?

secrets which it is absolutely impossible for him to

A Melbourne firm has just informed its
town travellers, in a fatherly way, that it will be
obliged if they dispense with the company of their
young lady friends whilst doing the rounds in
future. The average drummer won’t linger in a
shop pushing trade whilst there is pressing busi-
ness to be done in the buggy.
The Millers are not so largely concerned
in the Bank of Victoria as was thought.

The Katoomba (N.S.W.) Times vain-
gloriously publishes the fact that a burglar suc-
cessfully rifled its cash-box of 355. This is probably
a mean attempt to create a burglar-rush on country
pressmen, and thus make naked their appalling
destitution.
Visiting-magistrate Icely officially looked
in at Lord Howe Island, N.S.W., the other day,
and found the only occupants of the local lock-up
to be some bags of onions. The Lord Howe Island
people didn’t want a lock-up; but the good old
N.S.W. Government forced them to take delivery
of one, which was sent down in sections. Happy
Islet!
WOO NERVOUS VIGOUR

involves no danger and where the recompense
comes in the form of permanent benefit.
Oscar de Satge, a pioneer squatter once
well-known in Queensland Parliament, figures
on an English list of contributors to the Flood
Fund. Oscar’s attempts to adapt himself to bush
life were never more than a half success, because,
while doing as he saw others do, he never relin-
quished his claims to the personal reverence which,
as an employer and a man of titled family, he
conceived to be his due. He forfeited his
chance of election on one occasion by the lan-
guage he addressed to a leading publican who,
in a burst of enthusiasm, slapped him on the
back. De Satge’s repudiation of the familiar
relationship was manifested with such con-
temptuous hauteur that the publican at once
changed sides, and worked day and night for the
enemy. De Satge was the first to take up land
on the Georgina River, and, though a squatter
himself, was an earnest political advocate for the
settlement of the people on the lands of the
interior. He went to England and married there,
long after he had passed middle life, and brought
his bride with him to the wild Di’amantina home,
but they soon returned to England. Oscar will
be Count Oscar when an old man, now beyond 80,
departs.

A stocking-batted turnkey stealthily sur-
prised (by instructions), one night lately, a number
of Pentridge (Vic.) prisoners smoking in their

that’s not as bad as I thought. Only three

God Bless the Little Cablegram!

God bless the little cablegram !
That comes across the sea ;
It cheers the boozer o’er his beer,
The beldame o’er her tea ;
It tells how princes, pugs and prigs
Their precious hours employ,
Of Emp’ror Frederick’s stomach-ache,
And Beaty’s baby-boy.
We read : “ The Kaiser Bill is mad.’*
And then there comes the news —
“ ’Tis false that William’s lost his wits
He had no wits to lose.”
Again—“ The Queen fell down the steps
While bent on household cares ;
Her ankle’s sprained—’tis rumoured that
- The Fenians greased the stairs.”
It telleth of the last divorce
In circles high and gay,
And how the old nobilitee
Doth while its time away \ _
It telleth how the Duchess fair
Deceives her darling hub —
What time that haughty nobleman
Is loafing round the pub.
It tells us how the princes live,
And how the poets die,
And how the people cringe and crawl,
And how the statesmen lie ;
It daily serves a dainty dish
Of vice and villainy—
The accursed little cablegram
That comes across the sea.
It tells of Madame Patti’s throat,
And Lottie Collins’ legs,
And how My Lady’s poodle fares,
And how he barks and begs ;
Such sweet tit-bits ! They make one think
How sad the world would be
Without the little cablegram
That comes across the sea.

Fitzgerald Brothers’ Gigantic Austra-
lian Circus and Menagerie,
The above stupendous institution—the biggest of
the kind ever grown on the soil where the eucalyp-
tus bloometh and the wattle inspireth the local
spring bard —opened on Monday night at Redfern
(Sydney). The audience was tremendous, and
bulged out the huge tent till it was in a dangerous
state of inflation ; also hundreds were turned away
at the gates, and many of them, despite the most
strenuous efforts every night, have never been able
to get in since. The notes of all the banks in New
South Wales were taken at the pay box, and it
was only when the public began to offer preference
shares and eternal fixed deposits in exchange for
seats that the management began to object. They
also declined one old Confederate bond, a large
batch of scrip in the Last Call gold mine, and a
debenture alleged to have been issued by Jorgen
Jorgensen when he ran the Republic of Iceland,
and before he was exiled to Australia. They are
not more particular than the average, but they
felt it was necessary to draw the line somewhere.
In the case of a great many people who are around
at present, the line ought to be drawn around
the neck, and the other end of it fastened to a
tree. But this is a mere side issue, and has no
direct connection with the matter under dis-
cussion.
* • »
One elderly lady who appealed to the generosity
of the firm on the ground that her husband had
been killed in the Golden Treasure mine (Reefton*
M. L.) 18 years ago, was passed in free. So was
another who said that her house had lately been
destroyed by fire, and she thought a sight of the
biggest lion might make her feel better. But
when a tall, gaunt man carrying an angular, blue
umbrella with a sort of pale-green mould upon it,
like a fungus growing in a cellar, wanted to be
put on the free-list because his son was studying
elocution, the brothers again felt it necessary to
draw the line somewhere. Also a firm but cour-
teous negative was given to a person who tried to
get admittance for two in exchange for a ss.
grocery-order by a local benevolent society. They
considered that the spectacle of an enterprising
firm like the Fitzgeralds’ going into Kidman’s to
get ss. worth of groceries in order to realise a
relief ticket might arouse unjustifiable suspicions
as to the solvency of the show. An elderly clergy-
man, however, got in “on the nod” after 25
minutes’ hard argument, in the course of which
he gave a brief history of everything from the
year One to the present day.
* * #
Fitzgerald’s Circus is a huge institution which
employs fully 100 men and furnishes work for
over 120 horses. Among
its attractions the
Nubian lions occupy a
high place. In its wild
or natural state the lion
doesn’t amount to much.
It isn’t the animal it is
cracked up to be. It has
very little hair on the top
of its head ; in fact, its
mane is decidedly scraggy,
and it gets bald at a very
early age. It ought to
use Mrs. S. A. Allen’s
world - famed hair - res-
torer. It is of a yellowish
colour, and generally
drags its head and its tail
along dejectedly in the
dust, leaving two big
furrows wherever it goes,
so that after it has
passed by the natives
come and sow oats in
its track. It is always
ip a savage and dejected
state owing to want of
provisions. But when
it gets into a mena-
gerie and has a square
meal regularly, its
hair begins to grow,
and it takes to hold-
ing up its head and
assuming an aspect
of m a g n i fic ence,
and it shakes the
dirt out of the tuft at the end of its tail
and becomes an altogether new lion. It is
an animal of stupendous activity when roused.
Almost everybody who has ever joined with
a lion in forming a procession of two, the lion
being a little way behind and the object of the
procession being to get somewhere in the shortest
possible space of time, has afterwards spoken in
the kindest manner about the rapidity of its
movements, and the business-like manner in which
it didn’t stop on any account to look at the
scenery. Some people have met the lion in a wild
state and seized it by the tail. It is perfectly
easy for an active man to take it by the tail, but
it requires great acumen to let go again success-
fully. The public is invited to inspect the tail of
Fitzgerald Brothers’ big lion, and to consider
itself grasping the animal by that member out on a
great hot plain, with no place of refuge within 10
miles either way, except a solitary palm-tree on
the far horizon, and then think out the above
problem for itself. Anybody who can discover a
reliable way of reaching the palm-tree alive is
hereby invited to write out his scheme in full and
forward it to the principal Railway Commissioner
some day when all his critics have been struck by
lightning on the third Friday in the month.
# « «
But a greater attraction even than the Nubian
lions is the wonderful black-and-white performing
pony, Commodore, a really beautiful animal,
whose brain has developed to such an extent that
fears are sometimes entertained lest lie should
snlit down the back with internal pressure of c<m-
sealed intellect. In the very early days of the
world’s history, about two hundred million years
ago, the horse used to be only an eohippus. That
was before he became a hipparion, and when he
had not even dreamt of being a hippogrif. He
was a small personage about as large as a fox, with
°saws instead of hoofs, was that primitive un-
developed horse . and he travelled with great
velocity over the eocene rocks in order to get
away from the icthyosaurus and the labyrinthodon
pachynathus—which latter animal was a damp
about the size of a cow. That he did get
away successfully, the existence of Commodore
sufficiently proves. In these early days the fastest
men caught the most animals, and the fastest
animals got away from the most men, whereby
the slow men were eaten and the slow animals
starved to death. Commodore’s ancestor, being
the fastest of the lot, kept well ahead of the pro-
cession, and his descendants have done the same
ever since.
# # •
One horse in his time plays many parts, which
statement was originally written by Shakespeare,
who has since been proved not to be Shakespeare
but Bacon, and there are even doubts as to
whether he was either of them. And Commodore
has played more parts than ten average horses put
together. In earlier days, when the firm of Fitz-
gerald Brothers was a small and struggling con-
cern, appealing in a diffident fashion to the back-
blocks intellect, he used to act as almost every-
thing. When the firm deposited its coat and hat
on the grass while it pegged away at getting up
the tent, Oommodore used to sit down beside these
ff arm ents and make sure that they weren’t stolen,
He did this regularly till one day, when Mr. Dan
Fitzgerald laid down an unusually ancient and
ill-fitting hat, and Commodore viewed it with
OSH "TO V\///
""PmUETIN
surprise. Then he deliberately turned it over,
looked at the name of the maker inside, and
promptly resigned his position. His expression
stated distinctly that though he was willing to
make himself useful, still there were some kinds of
hat which a gentlemanly horse could not watch
without injury to his self-respect. Since then he
has positively declined to look after anything
except a bell-topper, and even then it has to be a
new one and carefully brushed.
* # •
Despite this difference of opinion, however,
Commodore continued to act as financial adviser
to the firm, and went round regularly at night to
see that everything was safe. He was always a
sympathetic horse, and many a time in these early
days, when the firm was harassed by a sea of
troubles, he has come and laid his copious silken
ear against the bosom of Mr. Dan Fitzgerald, and
looked up at him with a consoling expression in
his large, bright eye. When Commodore dies —
may that event be many years distant —the
inscription above his last resting-place will be :
“ This is the horse which never went back on a
friend.” And when the caravan passes that way,
it will stop to shed a tear and plant a little simple
flower over his remains. Meanwhile, however,
Commodore doesn’t look at all like dying, and
everybody who has seen his nightly performance
has decided unanimously that it alone is worth
more than the admission money.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus, like every other great enter-'
prise, had a very small beginning. In its very
earliest stage, when the proprietors were not more
than five years of age, it consisted of a goat which
was led about at the end of a bootlace. There
were no particular points about that goat more
than about any other goat, and he failed to draw,
But his proprietors grew up and persevered. It
was their ambition to create the first great
Australian circus, owned and entirely conducted
by Australians, and after starting with a very
small affair indeed, th6y have at last reached
the gaol of their ambition. Fitzgeralds’ Circus,
though constantly expanding with no visible limit
to its prospective vastness, is already a great con-
cern. Its greatness can only be fully appreciated
when it moves in all the pdmp of the eighteen
waggons, one hundred horses, eighty performers,
and the miscellaneous army of attendants, rouse-
abouts, grooms, cooks, and general assistants, to
say nothing of the proprietors themselves, of Com-
modore and Fanny, who travel as separate insti-'
tutions, the agents who go ahead and gently
approach the depressed and lugubrious local editor,
the literary character who writes the advertise-
ments, the armour-bearers, muleteers, clowns,
heralds, pursuivants, and other functionaries ; also
all the small boys, dogs, and goats for five miles
round who run behind. Then the march of the
circus is like the coming of an army, and Solomon
in all his glory was not a circumstance by com-
parison. Where the circus goes there is a great
cloud of dust rolling in front, and the herbage is
eaten bare behind. Its popularity is great in the
cities of Australia ; but in the barren and lonesome
West it is several degrees more important than a
decent-sized god or an Austrian archduke. It is
the one and only joy which comes to the parched,
sun-baked, silent back-blocks town. Its solitary
rival is hardly worth mentioning in this
connection—is the occasional forlorn dramatic com-
pany which arrives at long intervals with a swag
of faded yellow scenery, and plays a forlorn drama
concerning a persecuted female who was ruined by
the machinations of the person in evening dress
until the unexpected discovery of the tattered will
in the roof of the deserted mansion proves that
the person who is in gaol on a charge of murder is
really half-brother to the dishonest lawyer, where-
upon the principal villain reveals the corpse that
was hidden in the secret passage and falls down
dead leaving three wives to mourn his loss. The
big circus bears up pretty well so far against this
opposition, and hopes to continue doing so,
especially as the clown has got several jokes
freshly upholstered for use during the winter.
Anybody else using the same will be prosecuted.
* « «
The country population having come to regard
the Fitzgerald Brothers’ show as a national
institution which every true and genuine patriot
ought to support, they support it accordingly
with the utmost unanimity. This encouragement
not only appears in the shape of overflowing
houses and eulogistic press notices, but takes
quite a number of diverse forms. When the
itinerant colony is on the march, with somewhere
about (iO or 80 horses trotting contentedly behind,
any loose horse which happens to be grazing in
the vicinity generally joins the procession on his
own account. This sort of thing lays the firm
open to unjust suspicions of having stolen one
bony steed aged 18 years, with a bad spavin and a
partially-defaced brand somewhere near his frayed
mane—that being the general description of the
horse which thus installs himself as the adopted son
of the show. Then the owner’s son, who always
professes to believe that his horse is an animal
that somebody would want to steal, comes in
pursuit, and his beast is disentangled from the
procession, and the firm feels inwardly glad—as
glad as if a near relative had just fallen over a
precipice. Dogs—principally yellow dogs-—testify
to their admiration by attaching themselves to the
company in the same fashion. The Fitzgeralds
calculate that if this evil wasn’t suppressed with a
strong hand they would now—allowing for natural
increase—be the owners of 14,372 dogs, most of
them a cross between the bull-spaniel and that
mysterious kind of depressed terrier which is
always so muddy that no one can tell whether it
is a poodle or a skye - mastiff. Cows also
chip in occasionally, and wander behind
the crowd of animals till it is irnpos-
sible for them to get home in time for milk-
ing. All over the country there is a constant pro-
cession of beasts plodding homewards—rejected
candidates for the circus. Mr. Dan Fitzgerald is
an especial lover of all kinds of animals, and,
recognising this fact, all these waifs and strays
want to lick him softly and lovingly with a great
profusion of red, wet tongue. But for strenuous
outside interference, that gentleman’s clothes
would presently be licked right off him.
* * *
Also, the Fitzgeralds receive occasional en-
couragement in the shape of correspondence. The
following is a sample :
Der surr I ment to go an see your cirkus when you
kame heer but I wasant able to koine as times is very bad
heer just now i w<wd lik if you wood lend me a pound till
g ett hhn a bffleVin gladd.
pleas let me know as soon as posble about the billet also

ther was a man name Smith left heer to yeers bak he od
me 1 pound 5 if you meet him anywher pleas left me kno
his name was Smith an he had black hare ihat was lame in
the left legg.
The firm has been thinking hard over this letter
for several years, and hasn’t quite decided even
yet whether it was meant to be complimentary or
otherwise. But if it comes across any man whose
hair is lame in the left leg, it intends to collect
that 255. and send it along.
Meanwhile, the big circus hangs out in George-
street, Sydney, opposite the railway-station, and
conveniently adjacent to the Benevolent Asylum,
where it will remain for some time to come.
Judging from the enthusiastic support it is re-
ceiving it might remain there for ever if it felt
that way inclined. It hasn’t suspended, and it
has no desire to reconstruct. Also, if the Govern-
ment desires to publish a proclamation permitting
it to issue notes, the Government will have
to climb over the Fitzgeralds’ bodies to do it. In
spite of a tremendous run, and a panic at the
front gate among the people who are afraid they
won’t get in in time to see Commodore’s great
performance, it continues to meet all claims
promptly. Its clown is the only genuine humorist
at present in Australia, and he intends to continue
so. The other artists are unique in their
respective lines, including the man who swallows
himself, and afterwards spits himself out, the
jugglers, trick riders, gymnasts, the individual
who walks on his ear, and a multitude of others.
The tent is calculated to hold most of the city,
and it is seldom large enough for the business
done. Even the “depression’’ makes no differ-
ence to the Fitzgeralds, and their show goeth on
for ever, and the coin is removed every night in a
truck as usual. Owing to the great increase in
the takings, tenders have lately been called for a
larger truck. Mr. Tom Fitzgerald attends to the
business end of the show as usual, while Mr. Dan
looks after the interior arrangements. Also, Air.
Lyons is Press representative as heretofore. *

THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS.
Mr. J. B. Warbrick, or “Joe Warbrick,” as he
is familiarly known, was captain of the New
Zealand Native Football Team (better known as
“The Maoris”), which visited the Old Country
and gave such a good account of itself during the
season there of 1888-89. This team firmly believed
that St. Jacobs Oil is one of the secrets of success
in football, and kept itself in prime condition by a
free use of it. The team was so unanimous in its
verdict that the matter is worthy of special men-
tion. Mr. Warbrick, in conversation with one of
the representatives of the Chas. A. Vogeler Co.,
in Sydney, after their return, stated: “I have
much pleasure, in testifying to the efficacy of St.
Jacobs Oil. I have used it constantly since my
first visit to New South Wales in 1884, having
then injured my knee in our first match ; and dur-
ing our tour in Great Britain we have used noth-
ing else, and the New Zealand Native Football
Team all speak in the highest terms of its
qualities. In fact, so much did we think of it
that we hardly ever travelled without a case

Mr. J. R. Scott, the successful proprietor of the
leading hotel in Gisborne, N.Z.—the Masonic
Hotel —and the able manager of the above-men-
tioned New Zealand football team on their tour
through Great Britain, endorses the above by
letter, in which he states ; “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the wonderful properties of St.
Jacobs Oil. While there (Great Britain) I got for
the team’s use nearly a dozen different embroca-
tions, but none seemed to do the men the same
amount of good as St. Jacobs Oil. In fact, we
never considered our baggage complete without a
case of it.”

“Billy” Murdoch rages at his exclusion from
the Australian Eleven. Public opinion is with Victor
Cohen, as Murdoch, who now wears tan boots and tucks
his trousers up, can scarcely be looked upon as a repre-
sentative Australian.

At a recent Sunday camp down Middle
Harbour, Sydney, where chops were scarce and newly-
anived Britishers plentiful, a hungry young Australian
Collected a few dozen wood-grubs*, with which the chops
were garnished when served. The Britishers declined
with thanks, and picknicked bn bread and jam. Yet
wood-grubs are not bad eating. Roasted pop-corn and
toasted wood-grubs are hardly to be distinguished by
taste.

Lacrosse, the Canadian game, is growing in
favour in S.A. There are already seven metropolitan
clubs, and several in the country; The game is supported
by the men who are driven from football, with its

Baird, deceasedj paid his retaining-fee of £5OOO
to jockey Watts in advance. The Duke of Portland was
to give tIOOO a year for second call on the artist, but now
that Baird has gone, the Duke, so the English Jockey
Club decides, is entitled to step into the dead man’s shoes
and be “ first master ” for the season without paying any-
thing at all! The question that arises is-supposing Baird
hadn’t paid in advance, would the Duke of Portland have
taken the vacant place on payment of £lOOO, or would
Watts be free to put himself up to auction again ? How-
ever, Baird unintentionally bequeathed his investment to
Portland, and his death leaves Watts with more spare
mounts to dispose of. Happy jockey !

Billy M'Carthy defeated La Blanche (“ The
Marine ”) in the 16th round at New Orleans, U.S., on
Thursday last, aftef a savage fight. La Blanche, the
erstwhile conqueror of the famous “ Nonpariel ” Demp-

that M‘Carthy has “ come on ” to any great extent.

Griffo, the champion Australian featherweight,
duly departed for America by the Alameda. He may be
a different man away from the noxious gang by whom he
has been shepherded in Sydney, but it is only fair to let
the Yankees know that Griffo is scarcely a fair represent-
ation of the Australian boxer-outside the ring. The
writer cannot sum up the departing pug better for the
Americans than by remarking that Griffo “ on the burst
—his chronic state-is a miniature edition of Jonnel
Sullivan, without any of the redeeming qualities said to
be possessed by the Yankee in his sober moments.

A London paper tells this yarn re John
Roberts, the billiardist: —“J. R was playing a client
giving him long points in fifty. The amateur reached 49
to John Roberts's love. Red was on the spot. Roberts s
ball down. The other gave a miss in baulk. Young
John—he was young then—went to the spot end of the
table and took down the clock, and, playing from baulk,
forced his own ball and the red off. In those days you
were not penalised for sending a ball off the table, as you
are now. His opponent gave another miss in baulk,
Roberts repeated his stroke, and so they went on till the
game was 49 all. The other was obliged to play at the
red and left a score on which gave Roberts game.”

One day last week, “The Council of Churches ”
had the cheek to petition the Victorian Cabinet to pro-
claim a public half-holiday, “ to he observed as a time of
humiliation and prayer." The committee of a certain
pony-racing club, in anticipation of the petition being
granted, and to cater for the non-humiliating crowd,
promptly framed a scratch race meeting for the same
afternoon. The events comprising the proposed pro-
gramme were the Supplication Stakes, the Humiliation
Handicap, the Prayerful Plate, the Sinners Selling Race,
the Saints’ Steeple and the Collection Plate. No enter-
prise in Victoria, did you say ?

Tommy Corrigan, the steeplechase-rider, one
day last summer occupied the same railway-compartment
as a tough-looking countryman. The yokel, without
warning, proceeded to take off his boot, much to Tommy s
disgust. “Mv foot’s asleep,” explained the traveller on
observing Tommy’s horrified expression. “‘Asleep, did
ye sa3 r ? ” remarked Thomas. “Egad, I’d have sworn it

The Australian Eleven’s Bristol match aerainst
Gloucestershire was a spoilt walk-over, the Australians
holding up the wickets for over a day and a-half, and
only consenting to retire after knocking up 503—G.
Giffen, 180: Trott, 68 ; Graham, 59; Lyons, 48 ; Comng-
ham, 43; Bannerman, 39: M‘Leod, 36. G'ff en and
Graham were both “stumped.” The Gloucester-
Shire men only managed to put together 41 runs in
their first innings, and were enabled by rainy weather
to cry a go. George Giffen took seven wickets
for 11 runs ; Trumhle, 2 for 14 ; Coningham 1 for 12. In
the match at Lord’s, between the Australians and the
M.C.C. and Ground, the Englishmen took first innings
and rattled up 424 runs at the rate of about 100 per hour
—Flowers, 130; Marchant. 103; Stoddart, 51; Wilson
and Attewell, 31 apiece ; Gunn, 28 ; VV. G. Grace, 13.
The Australians duly made 243 in their first innings, but
saved their bacon with 347 in the second innings, the
match being drawn (unconcluded) with the Englishmen
having 14 runs to make and two wickets to fall—Stoddart,
45 ; VV. G. Grace, 33 ; Attewell, 26. Australian scorers :
Lyons, 0 and 137 ; Bannerman, 10 and 75 ; Gregory, 41
and 31; Graham, 29 and 24; Coningham, 40 and 0;
Bruce, 37 ; Trott, 29. The Australians, on Monday, were
matched against Yorkshire, at Sheffield ; other immediate

published shortly under the nominal editorship of
Mr, F. W. Bladen, Clerk of Records in the Govt.

At the recent type-setting contest at Mel-
bourne Rotunda, the “copy” given out was por-
tion of an essay on “ the Advantages of Christian
Unity, and the Evils of Sectarianism.” The con-
test was won by a Standard “ whip.” This sort
of copy would be little short of sudden death to
the average compositor, but a man accustomed to
the matter usually contained in the daily papers,
can set anything, without growing dispirited;

Everyone is retrenching all round just
now, but there is still plenty of cash in circulation
for a judicious investment, so comes to meet the
times “The Columbian Land Distribution,” a
scheme whereby a speculator to a small amount

competency. The management is in the hands of
men of standing, who court enquiry as to
the hona-fides of the undertaking. Further par-
ticulars will be found in our advertising columns.
“ The Advertiser’s ABO” for 1893, pub-
lished by T. B. Browne, 161 and 163 Queen
Victoria-street, London, E.C., and 353 and 355
Canal-street, New York, is a complete and
extremely useful compilation, showing the world’s
newspapers and their official scales of advertising
charges. An intelligible classification of papers
into their various class and trade divisions
occupies some preliminary space in the work,
and is followed by “A Chronological Survey of
the History of the Newspaper Press,” which
shows that, as early as 1526, news-sheets were
published in certain German and Austrian towns.
The first English newspaper was the Mercurie,
in 1588, “published by authoritie for the preven-
tion of false reports.” A “Journalistic Obituary
for ’92” is succeeded by an article on “The
Year’s Changes.” The section devoted to Aus-
tralasia is made concisely valuable to the ad-
vertising business-man in that portion set
apart for literary description. A few slight
indications of, a twisted idea of the relative im-
portance of Australasian newspapers are insepar-
able inaccuracies from a distant viewpoint, and
on all the more solid and important business
details, the “Advertiser’s A B C”isa valuable
and reliable compendium, and can safely be
recommended to advertisers as an authority upon
“circulating mediums.”

Jack Keyes’ Wife: A Tale of Equatorial
Polynesia.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Years ago, in the days when the “ highly
irregular proceedings ” of the brig Carl and
Other Britisli ships engaged in the trade
which The Times has labelled “absolutely
above reproach,” attracted some attention from
the Britisli Government towards the doings of the
gentlemanly scoundrels engaged therein, the
people of Sydney used to talk proudly of the fleet
6f gunboats whifch, constructed by the late Mr.
Cuthbert, of Miller’s Point, wete going to “ patrol
the various recruiting grounds of the Fijian and
Queensland planters and place the labour-traffic
under the most rigid supervision.” The remark
quoted above was then, as it is now, quite a hack-
neyed one, much Used by the gallant officers who
donlmanded the one-gun-one-rocket-tube craft
afore-mentioned. Likewise, the “ highly irregular
proceedings ” wete a rtaval synonym fot some of
the bloodiest slaving outrages ever done by man,
but h'oweVer,- neVer came to light beyond
being alluded to’ as' “unreliable and unauthenti-
fcated statements by discharged and drunken sea-
meri'” # * #
The Australian slave-suppressing vessels
Were not a success. Irt the first place, they couldn’t
sail any faster than a mud-dredge; Poor Bob
Randolph, of the Gilbert and Kingsmill Groups,
employed as pilot and interpreter on board, once
remarked to the officer commanding one of these
wonderful tubs that for four days had been
thrashing her way against the S.E. trades in a
heroic endeaVour to get inside Tarawa lagoon,
distant ten miles (and couldn’t do it), that “these
here schooners ought to be rigged as fore-and-
afters and called 4 four-and-halfters for, I’ll be
hanged if this thing can do more than knots,
even in half a gale of wind, all sail set and a
smooth sea;” But if the“fodr-and-ha]fters,”as they
Were thenceforth designated in the Western Pacific,
were useless in regard to the villainies and
slaughter of the labour trade, there was one
instance in which one of the schooners and her
captain did some good by avenging as cruel a
murder as was ever perpetrated in equatorial
Oceania.
# « #
Old Jack Keyes was a trader on the island
of Apiang, one of the group recently annexed by
the Royalist. He was very old, very quiet in his
manner, and about the last kind of man one would
expect to see located as a trader among the excit-
able, intractable native race that peoples the Line
Islands. His tellow-trader, Bob Randolph, a
man of tremendous nerve and resolution, only
maintained his prestige among the Apiang natives
by the wonderful control he had learnt to exercise
over a naturally fiery temper and by taking care,
when knocking down any especially insulting
native 44 buck,” never to draw blood, and always
to laugh. And the people of Apiang thought
much Of Te Matan Bob, as much as the inhabi-
tants of the w’hole group —from Arorai in the
south to Makin in the north—do to this day of
quiet, spectacled Bob Corrie, of wild Maiana, who
can twist them round his little finger without an
angry word. Perhaps poor Keyes, being a
notoriously inoffensive man, might have died a
natural death in due time, but for one fatal
mistake he made ; and that was in bringing a
young white wife to the island.
* * •
A white woman was a rarity in the Line
Islands. Certainly, the Boston mission ship,
Morning Star, in trying to establish the 44 Gospel
according to Bosting—no lie or dollars, no mis-
sn’ry,” as Jim Garstang, of Drummond’s Island,
used to observe, had carried a lady soul-saver of
somewhat matured charms, but her advent into
the Apiang moniap or town hall, carrying an
abnormally large white umbrella, had had the
effect of scaring the assembled councillors away
across to the weather-side of the narrow island,
whence none returned Until the terrifying
apparition had gone back to the ship. But this
white Woman was different, and the Apiang
native, like all the rest of the world, is susceptible
to female charms $ and her appearance at the
doorway of the old trader’s house was ever hailed
with an excited chorus of 14 Te boom te matan! Te
boom te inat&n ! ” (The whiteman’s wife.) But
none were rude or offensive to her, although the
young men especially were by no means chary of
insulting the old man.
* # *
One of these young men was unnecessarily
intrusive. He would enter the trader’s houseon any
available pretext, and the old fellow then noticed
that he would let his savage eyes rest upon his
wife’s figure in a way there was no mistaking.
Not daring to tackle the brawny savage, whose
chest, arms, and back were one mass of corruga-
tions resulting from wounds inflicted by sharks’
teeth, spears, and swords in many encounters, old
Jack verbally intimated to his visitor to 44 get.”
The savage, with sullen hate gleaming from his
cruel eyes, that looked out from the mat of coarse,
black hair, which, cut away in a fringe over his
forehead, fell upon his shoulders, rose slowly and
went out.

Early next morning old Keyes was going
over to Randolph’s house, probably to speak of
the occurrence of the previous day, when his wife
called him and said that someone was at the door
waiting to buy tobacco. 44 What have you to
sell?” called out the old man. 44 Te moe motu”
(young drinking-cocoanuts) was the answer, and
the old man, not recognising the voice as that of
his visitor of the day before, went unsuspectingly
to take them from the native’s hand, when the
latter, placing a horse-pistol to the trader’s heart,
shot him dead, with the savage exclamation:
44 Now your wife is mine !”
# # *
The poor woman fled to Bob Randolph for
safety, and, dreading to remain on the island,
went away in a schooner to her home in Maori-
land. Nearly a year passed, and then a man-of-
war came and endeavoured to capture the
murderer, but in vain, for the captain would not
use force, and 44 talk ” the natives only laughed at.
So the ship steamed away ; and then the natives
began to threaten Randolph, and talk meaningly
to each other about the store being full of tc pakca
and te rom (tobacco and gin). A long, uneasy six
months passed, and then the little “four-and-
halfter” Reward, Commander Pugh, ran into
Apiang lagoon, and the naval officer told Randolph
he had come to get the man and try him for the
murder.
# # •
He first warped his vessel in as near as
possible to the crowded village, and moored her
with due regard to the effectiveness of his big gun.
Then, with Randolph as interpreter, negotiations
commenced.
The old men were saucy; the young men wanted
a fight and demanded one. Randolph did his
part well. He pointed out to the old men that
unless they gave the man up the long gun on the
ship Would destroy every house and canoe on the
island, even if no one were killed. That meant
much to them, whereas one man’s life was but
little. But, first, the natives tried canning. One
and then another wretched slave Was caught and
bound and taken off to the naval officer as the'
murderer,- only to be scornfully rejected by Ran-*
dolph and the captain. Then the officer’s patience
was exhausted. If the man who murdered KeyeS
was not Surrendered in an hour he would open
fire; and also hang some of the chiefs then de-
tained on board as hostages.
Randolph’s gloomy face quickened their fears,
This Captain could hot either be frightened or
fooled. In half-an-hour, the, slayer of the trader
was on board. The old men admitted their attempt
at deception, but pleaded that the murderer
was a man of influence, and they would rather the
two others were hanged than this one. The trial
was just and fair, but short, and then Randolph
urged the captain to have the man executed on
shore by being shot. It would impress them mote
than hanging him on board. And hanging they
regarded as a silly way of killing a man.
* 4 •
The captain had no relish for work of this
nature, and when Randolph told him that the
natives had consented to execute the prisoner in
his (Randolph’s) presence and the captain’s pre-
sence also if necessary, he, no doubt, felt glad.
Bob Randolph then became M.C. and gave his
instructions to the Old men. The whole village
assembled ifi front of Randolph’s to see the show,
An old carronade lying in the corner of the copra
house was dragged Out, cleaned,- and loaded with
a heavy blank charge. Then the prisoner, sullen
and defiant to the last, but wondering at the car-
ronade, was lashed with his back to the muzzle,
and, at a signal from one of the old men, a fire-
stick was applied to the gun. A roar, a rush of
fragments through the air, and all was finished.
Bob Randolph’s fox-ter-rier was the only one that
seemed to trouble about making any search for
the remnants of the body. Half-an-hour after-
wards he came in ahd deposited a gory lump of
horror sit Bob’s feet.
# * *
This act of retribution raised a howl of
indignation in England. Pugh was vilified and
his dismissal from the navy demanded in Parlia-
ment. However, he was made a post-captain long
ago, and is always spoken of in the Line Islands
as “the best naval officer we ever knew.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Spirit of night and day enwrapped in a mystio
mist,
Light of the lights that rise telling cf darkness
nigh,
Take from the earth its earth —the sin by the
serpent hiss’t,
Withering life to death, dooming the born to
die,
Blot from the book of Time the wrath of the
years gone by.
Sorrows of land and sea, sadding the sea and land,
Vanish in sighs and find rest in the bourn of
care;
Shadows of fears unshaped shall scatter at joy’s
command,
Like rustling red-brown leaves on the breath of
a cold despair,
And the rhyme of the rhymester gleams through
a glamour of sense not there.
Night bringeth dawn of day, for day is the end of
night;
Writ in the book of Time is the wrath of the
bygone years;
The sin of the Serpent lives in the bosom of vain
delight,
All the hope of the world lies crushed by a
burden of secret tears,
And the rhyme of the rhymester rings in a won-
dering reader’s ears.
Earth that is merely earth, sea that is more than
salt,
Signs of a worldly world, fashioned from air and
cloud, .
Ye are as bones decayed to dust in a goblins
vault,
Echoing cries unheard of the sleeper who sleeps
aloud.
Life is a pang of pain, and the end of it all—a
shroud.
Song of the writhing worm sung to a mortal
host—
Strain of the stricken soul passioned with grief
sublime!
Naught is the dimplei babe but the germ of a
grizzly ghost,
The taint" of the time that was attainting the
end of time.
And the rot of mankind must bo as the rot of
the rhymester’s rhyme.

A Pair of Runaways.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lady Whitaker was a comely young
woman. As is sometimes the case, she was
married to an old man. It is an open question
how far the husband has a right to be selfish iff
these instances. The pair were botn aver-’e, and
Nature should have prevented the union; but that
goddess didnlt. i
True, despite her love fbr atidther, she had
snapped at title ahd Wealth; Biit, theh, She knew
what poVerty was—it had driveil her own sistei
into the street. Tq-day, riorte dare deny the
wisdom o! her choice. So do our ideas progress.
The noble lord suffered tetribly from gout,
trout, like death, helps to balance things a little;
It seldom attacks those vVhd sweat fteely, and
those who starve liberally.
However, the malady contributed greatly td
Lady W.’s comfort. She was unmolested in her
frequent sallies. She was a superb horsewoman.
To see her in the saddle, that was indeed unison.
On a certain Tuesday, his lordship swore at her.
She gave a port twist of defiance as she left the
room. Securing the phaeton, she was soon hying
along the high-road, when she quite unexpectedly
met the head-groom. Humour said that he
resembled her burst-up early lover. The horses

The careering animals knocked down a
man and broke his accursed leg. I say accursed,
because the accident was the pivot of the ex-
posure. It is curious how sin is so often dis*
covered, while virtue remains intact. The latter
makes a fine overcoat for spies.
Some presents were burned, and a young fellow
made for Australia.

POLYPE.


The Wild-Cat Column.
The City of Melbourne Bank, which collapsed
last Wednesday, is an institution which ought not to be
allowed to reconstruct; it should rather he abolished by
Act of Parliament. Its whole biography consists of one
sentence ; it had four-and-a-lialf millions in deposits, of
which three-and-a-quarter millions were British capital.
The City of Melbourne Bank was a mere rat-trap for
British money, and a pawnbroking institution tor lending
out the same in Australia at massive interest. And, as
Australia is already cursed with far too much foreign
capital, a bank which devotes itself entirely to this kind
of business is a disease—and a pretty bad one at that.
The City of Melbourne did so little Australian business
that, in its local capacity, it was hardly worth calling a
bank. It had only five branches in Australia, and it had
five agencies in Britain for the purpose of gathering in
deposits ; therefore, like a shark, it was pretty nearly all
mouth. Also; as the result showed, it was a mouth with
a spiked tongue, the spikes all pointing inwards, so that
it only worked one way.
* * *
The constant cry of the daily press that the
Australian banks issue notes only on the security of a
gold reserve, and are, therefore, far more sound than a
State Bank which, it is falsely assumed, would issue notes
with no gold reserve, is getting wearisome. Also, as it is
about time to point out, there is nothing in it. The
banks don’t issue notes on any gold-reserve; they
only do it On the security of their own unmiti-
gated gall. According to latest returns, the New
South Wales banks had £1,400,000 worth of notes
in circulation, and nearly £10,000,000 of deposits at
call, and their total coin reserve against both these
liabilities was less than £6,000,000. When a rush comes,
it is always a rush of depositors, and when they have got
out their money, or even half of it, the alleged note
Reserve has vanished into thin air. The reserve, in fact,
is a deficiency of about £3,000,000, and if there were no
call deposits and no gold leserve at all the noteholders
would be just £3,000,000 more secure than they are at
present.
* * *
The new issue of notes by the Bank of New
South Wales is a fearsome production—from a police-
man’s point of view. When N.S.W. Premier Dibbs’
famous Bank Issue Bill was made law the B.N.S.W. had
a fresh consignment of paper money to arrive from
England, but being unable to wait for it the management
instructed a firm of Sydney printers to grind out a lot of
currency on the instant. The firm had to do the work in
red-hot haste, and consequently the new note is a
feeble affair with a splodge of yellow on it—a thing
which looks as if it had been lithographed at a gallop.
The Bulletin knows several talented French gentle-
men who arrived in Australia viii New Caledonia, who
could turn out, inside of a week, a note altogether undis-
tinguishable from the new promise-to-pay, and as one at
least of this crowd looks unusually affluent just now* it
seems quite possible that he is already on the job. There
are, we fear, very happy times ahead for the bogus-note
gentlemen. Since paper has been declared legal tender it
keeps in circulation much longer than it used to do, and
many of the bogus notes will never he suspected until
the bank gives up its gold, and by that time the artist will
be far, far away. If the Treasury has to pay up under its
guarantee, it will probably be a very much surprised
department when the paper begins to roll in, and as it
has no special knowledge of bank notes it will, as likely as
not, pay the bogus ones quite cheerfully until their un-
natural abundance begins to arouse its suspicions and
make its well-oiled hair stand on end. Meanwhile, the
issue of some new kind of Treasury bill to relieve de-
positors on current account is under consideration, so that
N»S. Wales will have all kinds of money soon—except
coin—and the man who takes a threepenny omnibus-ride
will pay his fare with an inscribed deposit certificate, and
get back as change one preference share, an inconvertible
bank-note, a Treasury bill, and the ’bus co.’s tickets for
the small change, said tickets being convertible into
groceries at Kidman’s by special arrangement.
* # #
Speaking of paper money, The Bulletin is
reminded that a certain bankruptcy assignee has a room
wherein are hung framed specimens of the many elaborate
notes formerly issued by Thomas Smith Richardson,
banker, of Sydney, the said Thomas Smith R. being now
in gaol. Underneath them are pasted eulogistic notices
from nearly all the daily papers in Sydney, setting forth
by innuendo the respectability of the same blastiferous
swindle, and the reliability of the paper in question. None
of these papers had the slightest evidence of Thomas Smith
Richardson’s solidity except his own bald assertion ; but he
was a good advertiser, and that apparently was enough.
Richardson, among his other achievements, succeeded in
trading £3OOO worth of his waste-paper on a Cumberland
fruit-grower, and the old man, with a profound and child-
like faith in bank-notes of any kind, kept them carefully
in a bag. But, at last, his son got into dreadful
trouble, and the kindly patriarch gave him the bag
of Smith Richardson’s money to save him from destruc-
tion. For days after that a distracted young man humped
the whole lot around the city trying in vain to get a bid
atOOpercent. discount, and at last betook somewhere
about £6O for the lot. This sort of thing inspires an
awful lot of faith in N.S.W. paper currency, yet there is
no definite law against it, and nobody seems inclined to
make one. The only thing that is being made is more
paper. This ceaseless grinding out of more paper-money
is about the only industry established in N.S.W. up to
date by Dibbs’ half-hearted revenue tariff.
* # •
Looking back from the standpoint of to-day,
the public feels a certain dull admiration at the “ front ”
of the Commercial Bank of Australia. Its magnates
evidently realised that a general collapse was coming,
and, therefore, they collapsed first, and got their recon-
struction through before the panic began, and the
yearning to kill every banker in the land took possession
of the popular intelligence. The terms they imposed on
their creditors were about the grandest example of gall
and wormwood on record, and the board which pro-
posed such terms now would have to run for
its life. And they got their institution re-
opened in time to gather up the ruins of their
(alien competitors, and to put on airs of superiority as
they did it. When the Commercial of Australia suspended.
Manager Dibbs of that superior institution, the Commer-
cial of Sydney, loudly expressed a hope that when they
did start again it would be under another title, as the
similarity of names was very—haw!—inconvenient. This
was the pride that goeth before a big smash. Now the
Commercial of Sydney is shut up, and making slow
progress with its reconstruction, and Manager Turner of
the other Commercial no doubt -ays that he hopes Dibbs’
bank will begin again under a new design ition, so as to—
haw [—prevent mistakes. They ail feel like that. Every
time a weak bank shuts up the manager of the alleged
strong bank across the road would come and dance a war-
dance on his fallen rival’s doorstep only his dignity stands
in the way.
• • •
According to published statements, it would
appear that the Queensland National Bank has been more
or less on the down grade since 1880. In that year it
reached the summit of its glory and the net profits were
announced to lie £133,000. In 1890, they were £lOl,OOO ;
in 1891, they got down to £77,916 ; and in 1892 they stood
at £78,373. The capital was £BOO,OOO, and as a 10 per
cent, dividend, by any known proci ss of arithmetic, takes
£BO,OOO, it would seem as if the Q.N. had, for the last two
years, been paying away more than it earned.
# * *
After the preliminary newspaper paragraphs
which announced that Pliant O’Loghlen had carefully
abstained from reading the press leports of the Mer-
cantile case, and similar bluff, the susceptible Irishman’s
decision was a foregone conclusion.
« • •
The Melb. “City Newspaper C 0.,” which some-
how sprang from the ashes of Matthew Davies and Bal-
four’s wretched Daily Telegraph and which at present
is running the local ’Eralb, gave itself away recklessly
when the Mercantile case was “abindoned.” “The
commercial reputation of the city is surely purged of a
great scandal by this finding,” piped the ’Eralb, previous
to piping a little more about “ the cost to the country of
a criminal prosecution.” But next morning the Age even
said—" The misfortune is that the mischief does not end
with this kind of a discharge of the alleged culprits. It
has gone abroad to the public that hanking methods
which are shocking to common sense are quite permissible
under our law.” And everybody swore at large, with the
exception of the 'Eralb, which considered the city had
been “purged.”
# # #
It is more than a year since The Bulletin
observed that “confidence” would never “ be restored ”
until a gaol-wall was erected around Melbourne city.
Picture the wives and daughters from Toorak and St.
Kilda casting plugs of tobacco into the spacious exercise-
yard I Imagine the tone of the letters attached to the
plugs—“ Dearest James, —Yesterday morning I had to
discharge one of the female menials for insolence. She
said that her ‘ chap ’ would be ‘ out ’ two years before
‘mine.’—Yours, in tears and luxury, Maubie Paubib.”
* « «
Matthew Davies “preferred not to say any-
thing ” about the O’Loghlen nolle prosequi. Why didn’t
he say “Hallelujah!” and let the admiring 'Eralb
reporter chip in with “ Amen ?”
* * *
The unsatisfactory Ainslie, who couldn’t be
induced by the Crown Prosecutors to say anything about
the Mercantile Bank, and was kept in the background
along with Graham Berry, did say something concerning
O’Loghlen’s refusal to prosecute. He said: “Further
proceedings would have been very unfair. All they could
have resulted in would have been more expense for Mr.
Millidge and less receipts for Sir Matthew’s creditors.”
How long, O Lord ! are “ opinions ” of this kind to be
set up in large type by the man who prints for a syndicate

Most of the re-constructing banks propose to
pay all their creditors with shares or long-dated paper,
except note-holders, the Government (which has a prior
claim), and “ other preference creditors.” Who are the
“ other preference creditors ? ”

Some of the Sydney newspapers, even after the

Item of batik news : “ The banks of Melbourne,
prior to the recent troubles, held about £13,000,000 in
coin, gold, and consols. It is estimated that they now
hold £10,500,000.” So that a pull of £2,500,000 on the
alleged coin overturned the show.

One of the causes given for the big insolvency of
Mr. Yencken, of Melbourne, is “ depreciation in the
value Of hU freehold residence.” It is difficult to see how
a gentleman can get into debt through a reduction in the
rent; which he, as tenant, pays to himself, as landlord.
At this rate a sudden fall in the price of diamonds might
bankrupt the husband of a lady who wore a £lO,OOO neck*
lace day and night.

“ Does having been convicted of a felony dis-
qualify for a seat on a bank directorate ?” was a question
asked at a recent Sydney reconstruction meeting. The
voice was a gentle one, and its owner a mild, non-mili-
tant-looking greyheaded person in black, but it made
one of the nominated reconstructionists as red in the face
as if he had been asked to publicly exhibit the securi-
ties for his overdraft.

The Colonial Bank of Australasia “re-con-
structed ” even its own dividend. The 8 per cent, alleged
profit was payable to shareholders on and after a certain
momentous Friday, but though a few of the city share-
holders turned up promptly and got their cash, very few
of the country ones were on the spot. From Monday to
Friday inclusive were holidays, and the institution kept
closed. On Saturday it suspended, atid the disappointed
stockholder who arrived in a frenzy at the big front door
was “left,” like the public in general. The bank that
falls down dead in the very act of paying a dividend is
obviously an institution with heart-disease.

A bank’s “ reserve fund ’* is one of those things
Which religiously disappear when called for, and the
“contingency account” seems to have no existence in
fact when contingencies require to be met. Melbourne
has had recent experience of banks professing to hold
large reserve funds until they closed their doors, where-
upon the liquidators Came in and hunted for these
mythical resources in Vain.

The “confidence” doctrine is like a letter full
of the deepest sympathy for a good cause, but containing
no cash. Men with abundance of money have no confi-

“Tame Cat” writes complaining that the Bank
of New Zealand, which declined to have its notes made
legal tender, has now stopped gold payments, and issues
Bank of N.S.W. paper instead. The reason is sufficiently
simple. For several days the Bank of N.Z. was the only
recognised gold-paying institution in Sydney. Therefore
people burdened with great quantities of “ legal tender ”
notes deposited them there on current account, and
blandly drew cheques which they demanded should be
paid in gold. The Act authorises the issue of £7,000,000
in paper, and as things were going the B.N.Z. would have
had to cash the lot and then wait indefinitely for its
money. Therefore, there not being void enough in the
province for such a contract, it began to pay local new
depositors who wanted gold in their own “ legal tender.”

Tribute follows boom at Hillgrove. The share-
holders’ money once absorbed in management, machinery
and wages, the miners, settled in the district, can do
nought but take what is left of the mines on tribute.
• * #
Mining by tribute-system is largely increasing
in N.S.W. With hard work, cheap crushing, and, above
all, most of the dear work done by defunct companies,
trihutors are averaging fair wages. About the best tribute
in the province is that of the New Bushman’s, Parkes,
held by ten men on a 10 per cent, royalty. Last crushing,
3620z5. from 168 tons. Reef about a foot and well
opened-up.
• * *
A large contractor paid into one of the recently-
suspended N.S.W. banks some thousands of pounds,
chiefly to be spent in wages, within a few hours of the
notice of suspension. It is only one of many cases
differing only in degree. But, can one instance be given
of a bank director, or manager, doing likewise?
# * *
Is this a conundrum ? How will the Australian
banking-collapse be set down in Australian history? Will
it be believed that the banks were the innocent victims of
stupid public panic, or that the public were victims of the
greatest bank-robbery of the century ?
# * *
Now that the depositors who got their money out
of the banks are cursed all round for their want of con-
fidence, it would be well (in the interests of public confi-
dence) if bank managers and directors would give some
proof of their own. It would be very interesting to know
the number and amount of cheques, if any, drawn by
directors and their confidential friends, say within a week
before putting up the shutters. To hold a bank-director-
ship at pre-reconstruction time must, indeed, he a trying
ordeal. You meet in th ■ street your grey-headed lifelong
friend, already apoplectic and shaky in the knees. The
loss of his fortune will be for him sentence of death. A
word from you, and he will withdraw in gold. But no;
perfectlv aware that even now the reconstruction scheme
is in the hands of the printer, you tell old Billy Hardcash,
who went to school witti you, to have confidence, and that
all is going swimmingly.

Mr. Wilson, the Victorian dairy expert, has
visited Lord Hopefoun’s farms in Scotland, and says that
the latest Scotch milking-machine is a failure. The latest

They aren’t milking failures, anyhow.

In these “ pending-reconstruction ’’ days, the
memory of the confidence formerly displayed by company
officials is as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
One Melbourne co. had a genial manager and several
equally genial directors. One of these last dropped in
one day, and the manager asked him to sign a cheque.
“ Oh, all right, and while I’m at it I might as well sign
the lot.” he attached his sign-manual to a
couple of hunarea- blank cheques. The same afternoon
another director came along, and to him said the
manager,’ '* woft- nilght sign these cheques after Mr.
Smith; save a lot of trouble.” He hadn’t time lust then,
so took the book home with him, and returned it in the
morning fully signed up. This ought to have led to
something in the Mat. Larkin or G. N. Taylor line, but
it didn’t. • Unfortunately for the evening papers that
manager was an honest man.

The last balance-sheet of the National Mutual
Life Office shows that the accumulated funds now amount
to £1,259,573, and the annual income to about £290,000.
The claims paid during the year amounted to £85,000, of
which over £70,000 was covered by interest received from
investments. The National Mutual is second only to the
A.M.P. in the liberality of its bonuses, and is doing a
large and steadily increasing business.
* * *
In reference to a recent Bulletin paragraph,
we are informed that the Mutual Life Co. of Austra-
lasia has also abolished the objectionable “ suicide
clause ” in its policies, and, like tiie Colonial Mutual,
issues what may be fairly termed an ideal policy with no
conditions whatever as to residence, occupation, habits
of life, or cause of death. This is the example which
every insurance society ought to follow. It may take as
many precautions as it likes before accepting a risk, but
when once accepted it ought to be absolutely indefeasible.
Even if the assured falsely asserted that his father was not
alcoholic, and that his mother was not consumptive, and
concealed the fact that he himself had had a skull-frac-
ture and suffered from fits—still when once the office
takes the insurance it should take all chances—even if it
has to make a Small increase in premiums all round to
cover the risk. The old-fashioned restrictions are so
many loop-holes by which an institution may crawl out
of its liabilities, and in some offices they are so many and
so stringent that not more than 50 pet cent, of the policies
are absolutely safe and reliable;

At the meeting of shareholders in the Bank of
Victoria in Melbourne, Edward Miller; chairman of direc-
tors, tried in a mild way the Frank-Qrey-Snoith-feeling-a-
humiliated-man dodge, but it wouldn’t work. After all,
the Miller family comes out on top. It was popularly
supposed that they were as deeply in With the Victoria as
“ Big ” Clarke, junior, with the Colonial, and now it turns
out that the entire tribe of Millers have only some thou-
sand shares among thein.

Even the mining men on the Randt are asking
particulars of the existence of diorite near to any paying
gold mine. A big mining man of American experience
asked the writer recently if he could tell him where gold
lived in diorite country ? These queries sound strange in
Australia. The many tons of gold turned out of Lucknow
were got between belts of diorite and serpentine rock.
Mitchell’s Creek freehold, one of the most consistent
mines of Australia, is in diorite ; Baker’s Creek itself is of
dioritio character ; Mt. M’Donald largely consists of
diorite—in fact, although there are not a great number of
good mines in N.S.W., most of them are in diorite.
* * *
What is believed to be the contact of the
Serpentine and diorite belt of country, from which many
tons of gold have been won at Lucknow, has been found
in one of Dalton’s paddocks at Orange, over six miles
from the Lucknow mines. Encouraging prospects of gold
have also been discovered.

Two rushes have broken out within the last few
days—a tinfield in the vicinity of Condoblin, N.S.W., and
a goldfield at Burra Burra in the Parkes district.
Hundreds of men are at each field and hundreds on the
road there. Prospects on both fields appear to be
encouraging, but the writer has as yet no news on which
he can implicitly rely.
The Worker alleges that the commercial editor
Of a “ great ” Australian daily got down to his bank the
day before it burst, just five minutes too late to get out
his money. He had probably been detained writing a fiery
article on the folly and criminality of the people who in-
sisted on withdrawing their coin at the present juncture.
That was why he was late.

The fates have played it low down on the poet
FitzGihbon. That great literary authority went to Eng-

Bank, and Commercial of Australia, and they all closed
up and left the Board of Works to scramble round for an

A wealthy Hebrew, well known as a mining
speculator, was recently nominated for membership in the

an unwritten law fixing the minimum recognised value at

Editor Bulletin, —Be your recent paragraph on
the Otis ore crusher. I have been working that mill for
six months. It will take quartz as big as half-brieks and
grind it to flour at the rate of J to 1J ton per hour,
according to mesh. We provide screens 30, 40, 50, 60,
and 70 per lineal inch, or 900, 1600, 2500, 3600, and 4990
per square inch. I would not take the gift of a stone-
breaker in connection with this mill, because the quartz-
hunks become boulders, and assist in the crushing as
well as the 120 steel balls, which weight 13 cwt. In
comparing the Otis ore crusher with a 20-head battery,
the following is fair: Output, about equal; first cost,
much less ; cost of carriage to mine, one-fourth ; cost of
erection at mine, one-fourth ; cost of driving, one-half ;
cost of fuel, one-half ; cost of maintenance, one-fourth ;
cost of attendance, one-fourth ; cost of gratings, one-
twentieth. Crushes wet or dry. No dust when dry
crushing. No waste of power in re-crushing ore already
crushed to required grade. Constant work as against
time and power lost while stampers are rising and falling.
Area of gratings 50 square feet, exposing 1250 square feet
per minute as against 12 square feet in a battery. The
Otis ore crusher is the coming mill for reducing quartz,
sandstones, slates, dykes, tailings, headings—all ores
containing gold, silver, copper, antimony, &0., either wet
or dry, and to any grade required, to the fineness of fine
fl our . Ay ours faithfully, Robert Brown, Otis Ore Crushing
Works, South Melbourne, May 6th, 1893.

The sequel to the action of the Orange miners
in carting their gold to Harry Newman’s house, and the
deposit of the coin pro tern, in Mrs. Newman’s name in
the Union Bank, is herewith told. Mrs. N. was found
camping on the door-mat of the Union on the Tuesday
morning, and upon the bank doors being opened, she
handed in documents and notes for four figures, request-
i.ng_£old, gold, gold ! This was just five minutes before
a wire was received that notes were proclaimed a legal
tender. Mrs. N. carted her cash out to Lucknow, armed
with a neat little six-chambered repeater, with which, it
is boasted, she can pink a fly at 12 paces. Upon Harry’s
telegraphic communication, later, the gold was taken
back to Orange and deposited as a trust account in the
suspended Commercial, where it now lies in the name of
Kitty Newman, whose ponies are reported, at latest
despatches, as being kept harnessed, while the repeating
popgun is in good going order.

What a horrid change has come o’er the spirit
of the re-construction dream all at orlce !
* # *
Manager Lane, of the Broken Hill Block 14
Co., alleges, in his latest half-yearly report, that, prior to
the strike, each workman in the mine raised and handled
but a little over 11 tons of ore per month, whereas, since
the introduction of the sloping by contract system, he
has been able to bring the figure to over 21 tons. lie
estimates this to represent a saving of 47.2 per cent. On
the working expenses of the mine.
* # *
The Junction Co. closed its last half-year
(during two months of which the mine was idle owing to
the strike) with a profit of £451 Bs. sd. The satisfaction
expressed at this result is based on the fact that the Co.
is treating at its Port Adelaide smelting works a fair per-
centage of its sulphides ; also, as there is but sixpence to
call upon the shares, the company has long been perilously
near to reconstruction.

Dibbs’ bank-crisis Act limits the circulatioh of

The dividend-paying mines of the Randt, taken
in the aggregate, have a market-value of 107 per cent,
greater than the capital stock issued, while the value of

The tin lodes of N.S.W. are condemned as too
poor to pay, and many have been worked and abandoned
because the yield was not more than five per cent. A
man with a five per cent. lode tin-mine would be “fired
out "of most Sydney mining offices. Yet, the average of
Dalcoath, the great tin-mine o! the World, is only three
per cent, of block tin, and there are many paying tin-
mines in Cornwall whose return is from 50 to 701bs. bf tin
per ton of ore.

men live thete is an unfathomable mystery. But how
that men are settling down to hard steady work the

up the old Mountain Maid shoots in the deeper grohnd.

during 20 months ending 31st December last, turned out

first refusal.

An Age mining “ expert," on the recent find at
Baldhead, near the Haunted Stream, Gippsland, says the
discoverers “struck a well-defined reef carrying splendid

Not only do numerous Sydney solicitors nowa-
days engross their own deeds and registration copies, but
several firms, making large incomes, have made a stalk-
ing-horse of the hard times to discharge clerks wholesale,
under the pretence of necessary retrenchment. Then
these “ sweating ” lawyers get their articled clerks, who
pay large premiums—some as high as £3oo—and receive
only nominal salaries, to do the required engross-
ing gratis , while the discharged clerks, who are
generally married and familied men, join the unem-
ployed and live on whatever stored-up fat they
may chance to have. One Sydney lawyer, with a
large criminal practice, worth, say, £l5OO a year, runs his
office solely with articled clerks at a weekly cost of £2,
his “ managing clerk ” receiving the gorgeous stipend of
£1 per week. This noble employer, of his own motion,
allows his clerks two weeks’ holiday every Christmastide,
without pay. For absence through sickness pay is
stopped as per period. Another N.S.W. attorney, whose
practice brings in £3OOO a year, and who is a shining pillar
in so-called religious circles, employs as clerk a married
man with three children, paying him the heart-bleeding
sum of 30s. a week. And of such is the regiment of
Slieol.

According to Alfred Deakin, in his speech on
behalf of Director Bell, of the lamented Mercantile Bank,
that institution collapsed simply because of the “ stupid

Amalgam robberies from Randt batteries are so
numerous that a law is proposed enabling houses to be

“Stragglers”: A Sketch Out Back.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BmAIL, oblong hub* Walled with blue-grey hartl-
Wood slabs, adzed at the ends and set horizontally
between the round sapling ” Studs } high toot of
the eternal galvanised iron. A big rubbish-heap
lies about a yard to the right of the door, which
Opens ftoni the middle of One of the side Walls ; it
blight be the front ot the back Wall — thebe’s no-
thiiig to fix it. Two tows of rOugh blinks, Of
berths; tun found thteb sides of the ititefcibr ; and
$ fireplace occupies one end -the kitchen end.
Sleeping, eating, gambling, and cooking accom-
modation for 30 men ini about 18 x 40 feet.
■The roiiseabouts and shearers use the hut in
common during shearing. Down the centre of the
place runs a table made of stakes driven into the
ground, with cross-pieces supporting a top of half
round slabs set with the flat sides up,: and affording
a few level places for soup-plates ; on each side
are-crooked, unbarked poles la'd in short forks, to
serve as seats. Item—the poles are worn smoothest
opposite the level places on the table. The floor
is littered with rubbish —old wool-bales, news-
papers, boots, worn-out shearing pants, rough
bedding, &0., raked out of thebunks in impatient
search for missing articles, signs of a glad and
eager departure, with cheques, when the shed last
ettt out. ,
To the west is a dam, holding back a broad,
shallow sheet of grey water, with dead trees
Standiiig irt it. . , ,
i,,Fih-thet hp aldiig this Water Is ,a brush sheaf-
ing : shed, i. a rough sframework of poles with a
brush roof. This kind, of shed has the adr
vantage of being cooler than iron. It is not
rain-proof, but shearers don’t' work in rainy
weather; shearing even slightly damp sheep is
considered the surest and quickest way to get the
worst kind of rheumatism. The floor is covered
with rubbish from the roof, and here and there
lies a rusty pair of shears. A couple of dry, tar-
pots hang by nails in the posts. , The “ board is
very uneven and must be bad for “sweeping up.
The pens are formed by round, crooked stakes
driven into the ground in irregular lines ; and the
whole business reminds one of the “ cubby-house
style of architecture of one’s childhood.
Opposite stands the wool-shed, built entirely or
galvanised-iron ; a blinding object to start out of
the scrub on a burning hot day. God forgive the
man who invented galvanised-iron, and the giecd
which introduced it into Australia; for you
couldn’t get worse roofing material for a hot
country. , ... , ,
The wool-washing, soap-boiling, and wool-press-
ing arrangements are further up the dam. Go-
vernment House ” is a nqle away, and is nothing
better,than a bush hut,, for this station belongs to
ac company. And .the eompanybelongs to a bank.
And the bank belongs to England mostly.
Mulga scrub all round,,and, in between, patches
of reddish sand where the grass ought to be.
It is New Year’s Eve. Half-a-dozen “ travel-
lers ” are camping in the hut, having a spell.
They want it, for there are 20 miles of dry lignum
plain between here and the Government bore to
the East; and about 18 miles of heavy, sandy
“cleared road ” North West to the next water in
that direction. With one exception, the men do
not seem “ hard-up ; ” at least, not as that condi-
tion is understood by the swagmen of these times.
The least lucky one of the lot had three weeks
work in a shed last season, and there might pro-
bably be five iponnds amongst the whole crowd.
They are all shearers, or, at least, they say they
are. Some might be “only rousers.”
These men have a kind of stock hopeof getting
a few stragglers to shear somewhere; but their
main object is to live till next shearing. In order
to do this they must tramp for tucker, and trust
to the regulation—and partly mythical—pint o
flour, and bit o’ meat, or tea and sugar, and to the
goodness of cooks and storekeepers and bound ry-
riders. You cart only depend on getting tucker
once at One jilace j then you must tramp on to the
fiext; If han’t get it once yort must go short,
but there’s a lot df fenergjf, in art etajJtjjr stomach.
If you get an extra supply, you may camp for a
day and have a spell. To live you must walk.
To stop walking, is to die. ,
The Exception is an outcast amongst bush out-
casts, and looks better fitted for Sydney Domain.
He lies on the bottom of a galvanised iron
ease, with a piece of blue-blanket, for a pillow.
He is dressed in a blue cotton jumper, a,
pair of very old and ragged tweed trousers,
and one boot and one slipper. He found the
slipper in the last', shed, and the boot in the rub-
bish-heap here. When his own boots gave out he
walked 150 miles with his feet roughly sewn up in
pieces of sacking from an old. wool-bale. No sign
of a patch, or an attempt at mending; anywhere
about his clothes, and that’s a bad sign; for, when
a swagraan leaves off mending or patching his
garments, his case is about hopeless. The Excep-
tion’s swag consists of the aforesaid piece of blanket
rolled up and tied with pieces of rag. He has no
tvatet bag j carries his Water in a billy ; and how
fie manages without ft bag is a mystery known
only to himself. Hp has read every scrap bf P r ' r }* ;
within reach, and now lies on, his side, with Ins
face to the wall and one arm thrown up oyer his
head ; the jumper is twisted back, and leaves his
skin bare from hip to arm-pit. His, lower
face is brutal, his eyes small and shifty, and ugly
straight lines run across his low forehead. He
says very little, but scowls most of the time—poor
devil. lie might be, or, at least seem, a totally
different man under more favourable conditions.
Heds probably a—well, a free labourer.
A very sick jackeroo lies in one of the bunks*
A sandy, sawney-looking Bonrke native takes
great interest in this wreck; watches bis every
movement as though he never saw a sick man
before. The men lie about in the bunks, or trte
shade of the hut, and rest, and read all the soiled
and mutilated scraps of literature they can rake
out of the rubbish, and sleep, and wake up
swimming in perspiration, and growl about the
heat. , ~, j
It is hot, and two shearers cats —a black and a
white one- sit in one 'of the upper bunks with
their little red tongues out, panting like dogs.
These cats live, well during shearing, and take
their chances tlfe test of the year—same as shed
rouseabouts have to do. , They seem glad tp see
the “ traveller come ; lie makes things mors
homelike. They curl and sidle affectionately round
the table-logs, and the legs of tbs men, and purr,
and carry their masts up, and regard the cooking
with feline interest and approval, and look as
cheerful as cats can—and contented. God knows
how many tired, dusty, and sockless ankles they
rub against in their time.
Now and then a man takes his tucker-bags and
goes down to the station for a bit of flour, or meat,
or tea, or sugat, choosing the time when the
manager is likely to bp out on the run. Tfm cook
here is a li good cook*” from £t traveller’s point of
view ; too good to keep Iris placp long, ( , , ,
Occasionally someone gets soipo water in an old
kerosene-tin, and washes a shirt or pair of trousers,
and a pair or .two of socles —or foot-rags, .1 hat is,
he soaks some of the stiffness opt of these articles.
Three times a day the black billies and cloudy
nose-bags are placed on the table. ihe men eat
in a casual kind of way, as though it were only a
Custom of theirs, a matter of form—a habit which
could be left off if it were worth while.
The Exception is heard to Remark to no one m
particular, that he’ll give all he has for a square
meal. , , ,
“An’ ye’d get it cheap, bigod! says a lug
Irish shearer. “ Come and have dinner with us ;
there’s plenty there.” .
,fiut the Exception only eats a few roouthfalls,
afid his appetite is gone | his stomach has become
contracted, perhaps. .1 j .
~ The Wreck cannot eat at All, and , seems inter-
nally disturbed by the sight of others eating. ,
One of the men is a cook, and this morning he
volunteered good-naturedly to bake bread for the
rest. His mates amuse themselves by check-
ing” him. , .
“ I’ve heard he’s a dirty and slow cook, says
one. ■ ‘ ' '
. “Ah ! ” says the cook, “you’ll bp, glad to come
to me for a pint of flour when I’m cooking and
you’re on the track, some day.’’
Sunset. Some of the men sit at the end of the
hut to get the fulhbenefit of a breeze which comes
from the West. A great bank of “ rain clouds
is rising in that direction, but no one says he
thinks it’ll rain; neither does anybody think
we’re going to have, some rain. None_ but the
greenest jackeroo would venture that risky and
foolish observation. Out here, it can look more
like rain without raining, and continue to do so
for aLlonger time than in mpst other places,
Tfle Wreck went down to,the station this after-
noon to get some medicine and bush medical
advice. The Bourke savvney helped him to do up
his swag; he did it with an awed look and
as though lie thought it a great distinction to be
allowed to touch the belongings of such a curiosity.
It was afterwards generally agreed that it was a
good idea for the Wreck to go to the station ; he d
get some physic and a bit o’ tucker to take him on.,
“For they’ll give tucker to a sick man sooner than
to a chap what’s all right.” , . j.
The Exception is rooting about in the rubbish
for the other blucher boot. ~
The men get a little more sociable, and feel
each other to find out who’s “ union,” and talk
about water, and exchange hints as to good
“ tucker-tracks,” and discuss the strike, and curse
the squatter (which is all they have got to curse),
and growl about union leaders, and tell lies against
each other sociably. There are tally lies ; and lies
about getting tucker by trickery ; and long-tramp-
with-heavy-pwag and-no-water lies; and lies about
getting the jb'esfc of sqiiatters and bosses-over-the-
board ; ; and droving, fighting, racing, gambling
and drinking lies. Lips ad and every
true Australian bushman must try his best to tell
a bigger out-back lie than the last bush-liar.
Pat is not quite easy in his mind. He found an
old pair of pants in the scrub this morning, and
can’t decide whether they are better than his own,
or, rather, whether his own are worse —if that’s
possible. He doesn’t want to increase the weight
of his swag unnecessarily by taking both pairs.
He reckons that the pants were thrown away when
the shed cut-out last, but then they might have
been lying out exposed to the weather for a longer
period. *Tls rather an important question, for it’s
vert annoying, after you’ve mended and patched
tin old pa it Of pants, to find, when a day or two
further on the track, that they ate worse than the
ones you left behind. y
There is some growling about the water here,
and one of the men makes a billy Of tea, Ihe
water is better cooked. Pint-pots and _sngar-bagg
are groped out and brought to the kitchen hut,
and each man fills his pannikin, the Irishman
keeping a thumb on the edge of his, so as to knoW
when the pot’s full, for it’s very dark and there’s
no more firewood. You, soon know way,,
especially if you’re in the habit of pressing lighted
tobacco down into your pipe with the top of your
thumb. The old slush-lamps are all burnt out.
Each man feels for the mouth of his sugar-bag
with one hand while he keeps the bearings of his
pot with the other.
The Irishman has lost his match-box, and feels
for it all over the table without success. He
stotips dOwtt With his hands on his knees, gets the
table-top on a level With the flicker of firelight,
and “moons ” the object, sts it Were.
Time to turn ip. It is very dark inside kiit
bright moonlight without; and every crack SeemS
like a ghost.peering in, . -f , . ,t
, Some of the men will roll up their sw,ags on the
morrow and depart; and some, will take another
day’s spell. It’s all according tp. the tucker. -

The Land of Light.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
If I could fly, on wing so fleet,
Beyond the pulse of passing time,
And future moments strangely greet
While fret the world',, with step sublime,
Pressed on mfr track—behind, so far—
No pause I’d make in the swift flight
Thro’ vaster space to phantom star
Till I beheld the Land of Light.
For who cquld bear the soulless day
Which slowly waits the doom of man,'
And binds him down to dull dqcay —
The sentence since the world began—
If magic wing were given him
To break the chain which bound him tight
To present time, that he might swim
Far out unto the Land of Light ?
The wider view—for which we yearn,
That we might know the things to come,
And, by far flight, the truth discern—
Be mine, to seek the mighty sum
Of human care and equal hope,
The light of day, the dark of night,
And all that rests within the scope <
Of that fair sphefe—the Land of Light.
In spirit, then, let fancy dart ,■,, ,
From earthly .bound to farthest thought,
And there survey,i with lighter heart,
The perfect home the soul had sought.
Who rests content with ebb and flow
Of passing time knows no delight;
For him the mind shuts out its glow —
The vision bright—the Land of Light.

A Victim to Gratitude.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I was nearly being married against my will !
Don’t be frightened—l am not going to inflict on
you the old story of a scheming mother and
daughter and a compromising situation. Nothing
of the sort. My would-be wife simply worships
me still, and I am quite sure was actuated by
motives of the purest affection. At the present
moment, living as I am, a self-constituted exile on
a station in Central Australia, I am confident
that if I but hinted that her demise would be a
convenience she would, although a really religious
woman, consider it her duty to at once perform
“ the happy dispatch.”
I was in business in Sydney—that is to say, two
ot us ran a stock-and-station agency. We both
had money, and embarked in the venture more for
occupatii n than for any other reason, and also
because it would bring us into contact with a con-
genial class of men. As we were not keen after
profit, we did very well, whereas if we had been
struggling to live we could not have made office-
expenses.
My partner was married, and I was engaged.
His wife was a charming little woman, and my
fiancee was a fast friend of hers, so that every-
thing ahead looked smooth sailing. Of course, I
was not fool enough to imagine that any man can
get through life without a certain amount of
trouble, but I certainly did not anticipate the
series of extraordinary complications which would
eventually banish me to this lonely land of salt-
bush and mulga.
I lived in a quiet boarding-house, not one of the
veneered kind where you are expected to lunch off
two sardines because there are flowers on the
table, but one presided over by a sensible woman,
who both “knew her position” and also what
housekeeping meant. I was respected as a steady,
regular-paying boarder, and made thoroughly
comfortable in consequence.
Mrs. Thomas, my landlady, was a very kind-
hearted woman, and often, when not able to do
by herself the good she wished to do, had
appealed to me for assistance—seldom in vain.
I was not, therefore, surprised when one morning
she beckoned me into her little sitting-room, and
after some preliminary skirmishing asked me if I
had noticed a tall young lady at the table during
the last few meals/ I replied that I had, but had
not paid much attention to her.
“Ah! poor girl,” said Mrs. Thomas, “I do
wish, Mr. Petrie, you could help her. She is so
anxious to get something to do.”
Naturally I remarked that finding employment
for ocoupationless young ladies scarcely came
within the scope of a stock-and-station agency
business. “ Some elderly clergyman,” I hinted.
“Oyes,” said Mrs. Thomas, indignantly, “I
know all about them. Get her a situation as lady-
help at ss. a week. No, Mr. Petrie, she is a
clever girl and ought to be worth a fair salary.
Now, lady clerks are quite the rage—cannot you
assist her in that way ?” v
Here let me remark parenthetically that 75 per
cent, of women are as loyal as possible to each
other ; the other 25 per cent, consists of the
shoddy aristocrats and the fussy philanthropists.
Good, womanly women stick to one another.
Mrs. Thomas, for instance, spoke of this young
lady as “a girl” when she was anything but a
girl, and vouched for her being “clever” when
she was almost stupid. She did not speak con-
descendingly of her as a C.M.G.’s wife would have
done, or a committee-woman of some society for
the proper snubbing of all poor women. But to
return.
I said that, of course, 1 would do my beat, and
jokingly intimated that lady-clerks had nut yet
invaded the stock-and-station business. Mrs.
Thomas insisted on my being introduced to the
damsel. The latter was one of those aggravating
women who might bo anything. It would have
been flattery to call her good looking, it would
have been untrue to call her plain. She was lady-
like in manner, shy, and evidently without a spark
of the devil in her. She was simply neat and
neutral.
Now, I like a spark of the devil, as most men
do, so long as it is only a spark and not a blaze,
and as I descended the steps I mentally compared
her with the saucy, dashing girl who was soon to
be my wife. Meanwhile, Sirs, Thomas—good, but
wildly mistaken woman—was sounding my praises
in the willing ears of M:ss Aldine, for such was
her prim and proper name.
I did my best, and succeeded within a month. I
found Miss Aid ine a situation at a, fair salary in
the office of an elderly gentleman who compiled
Australian church statistics for the English reli-
gious papers. The work was not severe nor men-
tally trying, and I told Mrs. Thomas about it that
evening with some satisfaction. I went out to
dinner and stayed at a friend’s that night, so I
escaped Miss Aldine and her gratitude. For I
felt she was-one of that sort. Gratitude is a
hideous thing.
My partner, Johnson, and I were in the office
alone next day shortly after noon, when Mrs.
Johnson and Miss Sergison (my fiancee) swooped
down upon us to carry us off to lunch. Of course,
there was much chatter, for Mrs. Johnson was a
bit of a whirlwind, and I did not at first notice
that thewretched office-boy had, immediately after-
wards, ushered in another lady—Miss Aldine —
who had come to thank me for procuring her
the billet. I guessed, as I said before, she was one
of the grateful sort, but I never expected her to
make such a fuss about a trifle. The worst of it
was that as soon as her presence became known all
the talk and laughter ceased and silence reigned.
This confounded the poor woman, and she coloured
up and stammered through her little set speech,
until I felt inclined to tell her to shut up. How-
ever, I mastered the inclination and escorted her
out of the office.
I expected, of course, that Lucy would have
asked me all about it, and praised me for my good
nature, but she did nothing of the sort. In fact,
she maintained a stiff silence on the subject,
and somehow our little luncheon-party was not so
merry as usual. I was rather annoyed, too, for I
thought that both Mrs. Johnson and Lucy had
stared rather hard at Miss Aldine and discon-
certed her. Of course, the best of women have
these little ways.
Things smoothed themselves, as they generally
will in time. Miss Aldine plodded on in her
situation, and my wedding-day drew nigh. One
morning Mrs. Thomas again beckoned me to a
conference,, and, being in a mighty good humour,
I went, prepared for a call on my purse.
“That poor girl is in great trouble,” she said.
“ What girl ? Which girl?” I said, purposely
misunderstanding her.
“Miss Aldine. Her little brother, ten years
old, has nowhere to stay for his holidays. They
are orphans, you know, and his schooling in Mel-
bourne is being paid for by some distant relations,
who, however, don’t want to be bothered with the
boy. Now, I could manage to put him up here
and welcome, but there’s his passage-money?”
and she looked very hard at me.
“ O, well!” I answered, “I suppose I must
manage that—find out how much it will .be?”
Then, feeling slightly sarcastic, I enquired, “Now
we are on the subject, Mrs. Thomas, let’s finish
it. Isn’t there a clean, but widowed mother, or a
paralysed, but virtuous father knocking around?”
“I am surprised at you, Mr. Petrie,” returned
Mrs. Thomas, reproachfully. “This is not at all
like you. Uid I not tell you they were orphans?”
I was snubbed, of course, and departed at once,
feeling I was a brute.
That afternoon I returned early and was pre-
paring to go out when my partner and his wife
drove up. Mrs. Johnson had some message from
Miss Sergison, and after ten minutes’ chat they
departed, 1 accompanying them to the door. I
was about closing it after them, when the sitting-
room door opened and Miss Aldine, who had been
lying in ambush to thank me, came out suddenly
and seized my hand in both hers. I was so
startled that I forgot to close the front-door, and
Mrs. Johnson came tripping back to tell me some-
thing she had forgotten. She gave one glance at
the tableau, murmured something about her
parasol and left quickly, but in the look she gave
me I saw that 1 had lost a friend. I felt there
was but one escape for me, and after a troubled
walk I went back, gave Mrs. Thomas notice that
I was going to stay with some friends until my
marriage, strapped my portmanteaux, and silently
stole away.
A week passed. I was not so comfortable in
my new quarters, but I was safe. One morning,
Johnson and I were chatting and smoking when
who should be ushered into the office but Miss
Aldine and a small, weedy-looking lad. Evidently
the youngster had been taught his lesson, for he
solemnly advanced, caught my hand and reverently
kissed it, mumbling something which might have
been, “Thank you, my benefactor” (which it was
meant to be), or, “ How are you, dear papa? ” or
anything else. I steadied my voice sufficiently to
congratulate Miss Aldine on having her brother (I
emphasised that) with her again, and under plea
of business got rid of them.
Johnson was shaking with laughter, and
guessed at once the interpretation his somewhat
loose-principled nature would put on the scene?
so was not surprised when he began vulgarly,
for he could be vulgar at times, “ Nice boy, awfully
like you.”
Perhaps if it had not been that the boy in
question was such a snivel-nosed little rat, I might
not have lost my temper ; as it was I did. John-
son and I parted coolly, and I knew what he
would tell his wife.
Still Lucy was true to me; despite adverse in-
fluence I feared no coldness from her, but Johnson
and I agreed to separate and were winding up the
business. One morning he came in and putting
down a letter and a small packet said, with an air
of ill-concealed triumph, “For you, I think.”
I opened the letter with a cold chill at my
heart. It was my dismissal. I opened the
packet No ! I could not blame Lucy.
It had originally been addressed to Miss
Sergison, and contained a small handkerchief with
a huge S embroidered in one corner. A note was
enclosed —“From Rachel Aldine. One who envies
you your coming happiness with the best of men.
Having experienced his goodness.”
I tried hard to explain, but the case was
obviously hopeless. Johnson and his wife were
too much for me; and Lucy sternly refused an
interview. I spent a miserable month and then,
thinking I might as well be comfortable at any
rate, I took my old rooms with Mrs. Thomas. I
had been there about a week when I heard that
Miss Sergison was engaged to a man I detested.
This “camped ” me. lam a sober man, but that
evening I was not sober on returning to my lodg-
ings. I believe that I was very abusive. 1 called
Mrs. Thomas “an old cat,” and spoke my mind
generally. Later in the evening Mrs. Thomas
intercepted me on my way out :
“ I forgive you for what you called me, Mr.
Petrie, but O ! that poor girl !’’
“ Hang the poor girl!” I said, “she’s been the
ruin of me.”
“Hush !” she replied, “ would you believe it? I
looked in her room just now and there she was
kneeling at her bedside, with her little brother,
praying. Praying for you, Mr. Petrie.”
1 laughed the mocking laugh of a fiend.
“Thanks to both of you—l am past praying for,”
and I went off to the club, ordered a bedroom, and
finished the night there.
I returned to my lodgings about noon, meaning
to take a long holiday somewhere. I jocosely
asked Mrs. Thomas if Miss Aldine had been pray-
ing for me all night, and she replied that she
believed she had. “And,” she concluded, “after
what you said last night there is really only one
reparation you can offer the poor girl.”
In an instant all the valour of last night’s
carouse died out of me. Flight! For the second
and last time I shook from my feet the dust of that
accursed house. In a few days I had concluded the
purchase of a half-share in the station whereon
I am now residing.
Although I read all the papers I have not yet
seen a notice of Miss Sergison’s marriage ; but I
have heard that Johnson has been hard hit, specu-
lating, and is likely to become bankrupt. If I
could only hear that the grateful Miss Aldine had
been run over by a tram, or drowned at a Sunday-
school picnic, I might venture back and then—-
who knows ?
DELCOMYN
The Coming Dawn.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The night drags wearily—in yonder arch
Yet unillumined by the star of day.
The constellations wheel their stately inarch,
And vainly send to earth their feeble ray
To fright the deep’ning shadows as they creep
In sombre silence over Labour’s sleep.
Hark ! ’mid the gloom the marshalled army grand
Of Labour’s host—forerunners of the free—
Ascends the steep—their murmur shakes the land
And echoes harsh of Hope and Liberty.
Anon a meteor flashes through the air
And lights the heavens with deceiving glare.
A few are watchful, and in fear and doubt
Await the coming of the morn’s first beam,
Hearing the loud and ominous shouts without,
The flood of sweat that rolls down Labour’s
stream.
The ramparts burst and must be borne away,
Like morning mist before the dawn of day.
A million voices cleave the midnight sky,
Upon the bosom of the darkness borne
Goes forth the ■ i!d and half-despairing cry
Of gathering nope—“ Arise, ye tardy morn,
And dissipate in peace this Night of Fraud
When Wealth usurps and Hunger stalks abroad.”

A PROPHECY.
DON’T BE DISTRESSED. Depression will soon give place to prosperity by thoughtful economy
and eood laws. The lands of the colony should be its source of wealth, but this can only be
practicable by a profitable market being provided for the products of the land. The railway# rates
should be adapted, somewhat upon the Zone system, to the wants of the inland districts. By carrying
rates to the sea-board, so that the tillers of the soil may have a profitable market provided {America
owes her great prosperity mainly to this), emigration would then flow into the country, population
increase, and a natural boom the result.

CLOSES JUNE 3, 1808.
In “The Benevolent.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I’m off on the wallaby 1 ” cries Old Ben,
And his pipe is lit, and his swag is rolled ;
“ There is nothing here for us old-time ipen,
But up north, I hear, they are on the gold.”
And he shuffles off with a feeble stride,
With his ragged swag and his billy black.
Ho is making tracks for the other side.
O’er the river deep or the Great Divide,
But at night, dead beat, he travels back.
Then at morn next day he is off again,
With an eager light in his agdd eyes,
Tramping away on his journey vain
For the land of promise beyond the rise.
Over the range there is work to do,
There is roaring life at the shanty bars.
He will tramp the plains whilst the skies are blue,
And will wander the great wide bushland through,
And be soothed to sleep by the blinking stars.
In the garden gay where the old man roams
Pied poppies sway on their supple stalks,
And the fair white rose on the soft breeze foams,
And the pansies peep by the gravelled walks ;
But his brow by the breeze of the hills is fanned,
And the clink of bells to his quick ear comes.
When he shades his eyes with his withered hand,
He sees silent rivers and ranges grand,
Or a still lagoon under silver gums.
“Are you bound out back, Dan?” the children
cry,
And they peer at him through the fence, and
shout:
“ Well, it’s so long, Dan,” as he hobbles by,
With his “ Aye, aye, sonny lad—tramping
out!”
On his back he’s bearing his house and bed, ,
As he bore them both in his manhood’s pride,
Pressing on each day till his strength has fled
By the force of his dauntless spirit led —
There’s a shed for him on the Sydney side.
Though his sight may fail and his limbs give way,
Yet no weakness touches his brave old heart,
And he cries each night : “ At the break of day
I must strap up bluey and make a start!”
And they humour him for the time is near
When he’ll tramp no more under changeful
skies,
But will leave his travels and troubles here,
Take the track God blazed with his stars, and
steer
To the Never Land just across the rise.
EDWARD DYSON.
“ Those trumpery things termed titles !”
Billy Maloney.
The new picture for N.S.W. National
Gallery, “ The Cavalry Charge,” by Detaille, cost
<£2900. It was purchased in Paris by the brother
of Mr. E. L. Montefiore, the National Gallery
director. This splendid picture absorbs all the
year’s vote.
A Sydney youth who had been put on
board a recently-departed mail-boat by his indul-
gent ma for an improving trip ’Ome, did not get
further on his way than Hobart. He was there
“ taken down ” by the old, familiar confidence-
trick men (two fellow-passengers), cleaned out
of all his pocket-money—some £lloo—and had to
telegraph for cash to carry him back to the
nursery.
“ Circumstantial evidence ” again. A new-
chura in Queensland is now finishing off 18 months
sentence for burglary in Rockhampton. A police-
man found him walking about that town early one
morning, in stocking’d feet. “ Where are your
boots?” asked the officer. “I got drunk last
night and lay down against a fence. When I
awoke, my boots were gone, and my pockets were
turned inside-out.” He was hauled to the gaol
and shown a pair of “elastic-sides.” “Mine,”
said heat once. “Well, then, you’re charged with
breaking into and stealing from a dwelling-house;
those boots were found in a private house which
has been robbed.” The victim was duly found
guilty. . . Quite lately, a burglar, detected
“ jemmy’’-handed “in the act,” confessed to
having also been the artist of the burglary for
which the new-chum is still suffering. Just before
committing it he had come across the drunken
fool, asleep, had taken off his boots, and appro-
Eriated his loose cash. Then, while robbing a
ouse, he was disturbed, and, in his hurry, had
left the stranger’s boots on a table.
The recent mortality among Marchionesses
of Ailesbury—four of whom were in existence a
year ago—has extended to venerable Maria of that
ilk. Three of them were old women, the widows
of forgotten holders of the title, and Maria was
the oldest and oddest of the lot. Up to her
eightieth year, or later, Maria was the “Mrs.
Skewton ”of fashionable race-meetings. The old
girl flirted around the “ royal enclosures ” and
members’ reserves and so forth, in a false front of
white, artificial curls and a chronic state of youth-
ful excitement, the excitement being little less
false than the hair. She affected a large and
expensively-bound betting-book, and would tap
the Heir Apparent with a gold pencil-case in quite
a Mrs. Skewton manner and call him “naughty ”
for advising her to back a loser. Also she would
shake her festive forefinger at the distant book-
makers and complain that those dreadful crea-
tures, those insufferable monsters, were winning
all her money. A remarkable creature was old
Maria, Marchioness of Ailesbury. It is supposed
that the British aristocracy regarded her as some-
thing to be proud of, inasmuch as she managed to
remain “ so dev’lish lively ” for long after the
time when she ought to have begun to repent.
Dear Bulletin, —Don’t you think it is a
little unjust to say that Higinbotham “abandoned
his post.” Was he not rather forced from it by
the faintheartedness of his colleagues, and—to put
it mildly—the apathy of the people? Democracy
deserted Higinbotham—Higinbotham never de-
serted Democracy. He fought for it to the last,
and if he did, as you say, “seek refuge in the
retirement of the Bench when his work was little
more than begun ” he did not cease working, he
only worked differently, and in his opinion—
formed after an experience in which his heart was
well nigh crushed out of him, and at the end of
which he found himself absolutely alone—with
better chance of profit to the people. Surely you
do not forget the Codification of the Laws, the
Ah Toy judgment, the attack on the churches in
his lecture on “Science and Religion,” and his
strike subscription ! These were after he “sought
refuge, etc.” No, George Higinbotham ceased to
be a democrat militant because he foresaw that
the people of Victoria were not ripe to follow
where he would lead. And was he not right?
The roll-call of Victorian idols is sufficient answer.
—Paul Mkll.

“THE BULLETIN.
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Australla’s Nonparell

h. e JR ti lleti n,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and din
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
tlie World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap

cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monunoly.
The d irect election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instuad of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
slop of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
sr.J has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
Tim Bulletin is the beacon-fire of nationa
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afllicts British humanity.
Against the ola’ins of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against thedark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, Tur
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
Th* Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maori land
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, iKicause its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
