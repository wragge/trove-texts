AUSTRALIAN POETRY
Anybody who edits an annual
anthology such as Angus and Robert-
son’s “Australian Poetry” has to have,
as well as judgment, luck. If the
poetry produced during the year is not
of the highest quality or lacks the
elements of surprise and force that can
do so much to distinguish one year’s
verse from another, there is not much,
whatever stratagems he may resort to,
that the editor can do about it.
I was looking through “Australian
Poetry, 1944” again the other day—
R. G. Howarth’s year—and was
astonished, though I had known it
before, to see how extremely lucky
Howarth had been. Certainly he had
the good taste to accept the best when
it was offered him; but it was excep-
tional good fortune that threw up to
him, in one year, such a galaxy of out-
standing and memorable poems as both
“The Face of the Waters” and
“Heemskerck Shoals,” by Robert
D. Fitz Gerald; Judith Wright’s
“Bullocky”; William Hart-Smith’s
“Columbus Goes West”; Hugh Me-'
Crae’s “Fragment”; James McAuley’s
“Terra Australis”; A. D. Hope’s
“Australia” and “Standardisation” and
Kenneth Slessor’s “Beach Burial”;
with, too, a pretty good surrounding
company for them.
For Australian Poetry, 1958 Vincent
Buckley has tried an interesting experi-
ment. Feeling, I presume, that the
quality of the anthology had dropped
a bit in recent years, he has tried to
re-establish it by cutting down the
number of contributors and, at the
same time, allowing the writers who
are represented much more space
than usual: three or four poems each,
instead of the customary one or two.
In theory, provided the omissions
were not unjust, it was a good idea;
worth trying out, anyhow, for one
issue, seeing that writers who had been
omitted would have their chance the
following year under some other editor.
It could have corrected that impres-
sion which anthologies so often make,
of everybody writing on one level; of
a book of impeccable, even little
poems, pleasant enough in themselves
but without distinction. Poems of con-
siderable length could have been
included; and the contributors, whether
they were represented by long poems
or groups of short pieces, could have
established something of their indi-
vidual “worlds” presenting them-
selves as Poets instead of merely as
the authors of a poem.
The questions to be decided in assess-
ing how this experiment has worked
out are: first, what poets have been
omitted; and, next, how effective has
it been in restoring the stature of the
anthology?
Buckley has only 26 writers repre-
sented, as against 43 in 1956 and 49
in 1957; and, if the experiment justifies
some of the omissions, others —Fitz-
Gerald and Judith Wright, for instance
—at first glance seem startling. But
Judith Wright was not publishing her
poems when Buckley was collecting for
the anthology, and Fitz Gerald, so he
told me, did not feel he had anything
worth contributing—a hiatus he has
since filled by writing, for the next lucky
editor, “The Wind at Your Door”—
and so I would imagine that, on the
whole, Buckley has been more unlucky
than inexplicable. Perhaps it is merely
bad luck, too, that explains why such
writers as David Campbell and John
Blight are each represented by only a
single poem. But the absence, in par-
ticular, of Ray Mathew, Max Harris,
Nan McDonald and John Thompson
remains puzzling.
It is largely because of the lack of
substantial contributions from out-
standing writers that Buckley’s experi-
ment has not, on the whole, succeeded.
He has been lucky in getting four
poems from Francis Webb (one of
which, “Five Days Old,” is an
exquisitely-tender and beautiful lyric);
lucky in a good representation from
Randolph Stow; but, though their con-
tributions all make pleasant reading, I
don’t think the other writers with
groups of three or four poems add
much force or stature to the anthology
or display the writers as poets—at their
best —in the way Buckley must have
hoped for. The nearest any of these
comes to establishing a distinctive,
individual statement is in the three
poems by Evan Jones; but, charming
though “Noah’s Song” is, the long
Yeats-like meditation, “Winter Poem,”
would probably have been an adequate
representation for this writer.
Failing to achieve the special mass
and force that better luck might have
given it, the anthology seems to me to
turn into much the same anthology as
is published every year. Like all other
editors, Buckley has shown some
natural preference to the writers who
share his own tastes and interests—it
is obviously Melbourne’s year—and
like all other editors, he has included
one or two failures, many good poems
and a few outstanding ones.
Among the best of them are “Five
Days Old,” Hart-Smith’s inimitable
kangaroos that hop about the paddock
“like deliberate great fleas,” Bruce
Dawe’s “Dial WX4500,” Gwen Har-
wood’s well-written “Postcard,” J. R.
Rowland’s thoughtful travel-notes on
South-east Asia, A. D. Hope’s “Persons
From Porlock,” Roland Robinson’s
deeply-felt lament for the aborigines,
Jones’s “Winter Poem,” Chris Wallace-
Crabbe’s eloquent “Monologue Among
Colonial Houses” and Randolph
Stow’s “The Ghost at Anlaby.” And
also there are Thomas Shapcott, full
of rivery light and music in the open-
ing of “River Scene”; and the girl like
a koala perched on the back of Colin
Thiele’s motorbike; and a new thought
about the wind in Alexander Craig’s
“Lovers in Winter”; and Noel
Macainsh changing Streeton’s land-
scape into Blake’s:—
And the nimble cherubs softly piping
Their bird-sweet hosannahs over an
axeman
Bending his way, held in a nimb of
glory.
Chiefly meditative in tone, but
varied and liberal enough, with its
Australian atmosphere coming in
naturally, it is a readable and credit-
able anthology; but it was the wrong
year for Buckley’s experiment, and he
would have got a livelier, richer book
by cutting down the groups of poems
and letting in half a dozen more
writers.

Burns
The Bums Encyclopaedia, by
Maurice Lindsay (Hutchinson), is so
up to date as to take in references to
Cyril Pearl’s recent “Bawdy Burns,
The Christian Rebel,” though there is
a notable omission of any reference to
James Barke’s series of hotcha novels,
so lushly celebratory of Burns’s
prowess as a stud bull.
And this is reasonable enough:
Burns himself left little to the imagina-
tion; and if he could have imagined
Barke’s imagination he might have left
less. However, take Barke’s widely-
read novels, and Catharine Carswell’s
warm and sincere book about Burns
and add them to his easily-available
poems, and how come Cyril Pearl
can complain of a conspiracy to ignore
the erotic in Bums or to pretty him up
as the “Cottar” of his own “Saturday
night”? Well, it enables Pearl to
reproduce the facts to the contrary;
and especially to print as much as he
can of suppressed Bums, or poems
that have been printed in extremely
limited editions.
And in this Pearl is quite a help, and
more so than Lindsay, who prints only
one or two choice examples (notably
a squib on the Reverend William
Peebles). Pearl prints enough, and
himself suppresses enough (the com-
plete version of “Green Grow the
Rashes O,” for instance), to make it
clear that a complete book of Burns’s

BETRAYAL AND BERLIN
A PLAYBOY Western world seems
little to appreciate the ominous
and immediate dangers that hang over
it in consequence of the new encroach-
ments of Communism.
The crushing of Tibet and its trans-
formation into a Communist State by
force, and the threats to India accom-
panied by the massing of troops in
its vicinity, seem to have no more
impact on the Western public mind
than the arrogant deportation of a
Russian officer in Rangoon, where the
Soviet Embassy officials did what they
would have tried to do in Australia —
if they had dared —during the attempt
to deport Mrs.-Petrov.
Any attempt to awaken public
opinion is apt to be brushed aside
rather impatiently against a back-
ground of murmurs of “Macarthyism.”
emanating from vague sources, and
Communist - inspired demands for
more freedom—for the Communists.
Australia is not immune from this
paralysis. If the Liberal party had had
two men thrown out of employment
because they refused to subscribe to
party funds when ordered by the
Employers’ Federation. Governments,
press and unions would combine to
beat the Liberal party into the
ground. If the Liberal party were to
organise a demonstration against a
Labor Prime Minister in Martin
Place, shout menacingly at him.
create disorder in his presence and
send a coarse caricature of himself,
with insults at the wharf in the
presence of his wife at their departure
for overseas, indignation would be
whopped-up to fever-heat.
Yet when these things were done to
Mr. Menzies under the aegis of agents
of a foreign Power, which officially
refers to the country as its enemy in
official documents, they were palmed-
off as a manifestation of desirable
freedom.
And it has become a sine qua non
that it is a decent and dignified thing
for Australians and others to travel
abroad at the expense of hostile
countries (which have the blood of
millions of their own citizens and of
the Hungarians and Tibetans on their
hands) on “missions of inquiry” or
“goodwill.” These people appear to
come back almost invariable brain-
washed by skilful propagandists, with
nothing to say for 'their wily hosts
but good.
Even members from the Federal
Government side are about to traipse-
off to Warsaw on one of these expedi-
tions. and it is odds-on that they will
feel bound to be polite and compli-
mentary when they come home.
At the same time. Comrade Healy,
of the Watersiders, has gone to
Tokyo to a transport conference
organised by bodies which are Com-
munist-controlled. As some Commu-
nist organs have been barking round
the world, it has been called together
for the purpose of gingering-up the
Japanese Communist movement
against the West and paving the way
for world-wide transport strikes to
tighten control of the world’s ports
and shipping.
CTRIKES, according to Engels, one of
the masters of Communist strategy
philosophy is taught as "a
“must” in the Communist training-
colleges, are preliminaries to war, the
training-ground of the worker in war.
With the Communist a strike is not
merely a demonstration by workers
against injustice, but a exercise”
for the final violences which “destroy
the capitalist system.”
Behind this lies the persistent and
now resurgent fight going on among
the unions for the destruction of the
arbitration courts and the abolition
of penalty provisions for illegal strikes.
That the Cahill Government appears
to be weakening on this issue is only
another sign of the manner in which
the Communist party in Australia—
as in Britain, where the great A.E.U.
and the National Coalminers have
chosen Communists for their new
heads —is regaining the insolent power
for mischief which it wielded in the
last days of the war. It is all in line
with the fact that in Victoria candi-
dates in a great public-utility union
like the A.R.U. feel that they have
no chance of re-election unless they
campaign on a unity-ticket with the
Communist party —this is flat defiance
of A.L.P. policy.
Also, that the great A.L.P., which
professes to have rules to expel any
member who associates himself with
Communists, has allowed its leaders
and constituent unions to consort with
them up to the highest level, has cam-
paigned furtively in conjunction with
them at election campaigns, and taken
no steps to stop the drift towards the
extreme Left which has become the
cardinal feature of Labor Federal
policy over the past few years.
European situation is in keep-
ing with the arrogance with which
Communists everywhere break the
laws and urge on the citizens of other
countries to lawlessness and treason.
All the talk of negotiation and con-
ferences which floods the press and
radio masks the deadly reality, em-
phasised during the past few days,
that Khrushchev regards conferences
merely as meetings at which the other
Powers will agree to submit to his
plans.
There is no real suggestion that
he has dropped his plan to hand over
Berlin and the whole of Eastern Ger-
many on May 27, in terms of his
ultimatum last November, to the Com-
munist Government of the Russian-
controlled German zone and put the
force of Russian tanks behind its
efforts to crush resistance to its new
“Government.”
He has within the past week re-
peated his statement that when a
separate peace between Russia and
East Germany is signed—of course
in flagrant dereliction of his agree-
ments with the Western Allies —“the
functions of the Western Powers there
will have ended ... By the same
token, their right to station troops in
West Berlin will have comL to an
end.”
And so will the freedom of move-
ment of the West Berlin majority of
the people of that city whose zone
holds about 80 per cent, of its wealth
and productivity and provides a
striking demonstration for the Com-
munised East to see of the Western
way of life. It is made plain that if
they resist being dragged behind the
Iron Curtain, or if they and the West
stand upon their legal rights of egress
and access. Soviet tanks will roll in
the name of “freedom.”
/"\NLY a few days are left in which to
determine how much of this is bluff.
The fact that conferences are being
held with the West means nothing. The
world has a short memory and seems
already to have forgotten the betrayals
and treachery of Russia which im-
mediately preceded World War II in
1939.
Then, as now, conferences pro-
ceeded. Then the shocking betrayal to
the Nazis under the Ribbontrop agree-
ments was suddenly revealed. The
betrayal was followed by the immola-
tion of the little Baltic countries and
the bandit division of the spoils of
Poland between the Kremlin and
Hitler and Goebbels, whom Moscow
had just previously been denouncing
as gangsters and tyrants.


OYER THE FENCE!


PLAIN ENGLISH
Weathercock, Not Leader
Oddly, no gale of hilarity greeted the
performance of Dr. Evatt at the meet-
ing of the A.L.P. Federal Executive
last week.
The Doctor abandoned the High
Court Bench to enter Labor politics at
the behest of the N.S.W. Labor Execu-
tive at a time when it was under the
control of Communists of the Hughes-
Evans Group, which had just then
piloted the “Hands-off-Russia” resolu-
tion through the State conference,
Hughes being one of the best-known
Communists in the Commonwealth, and
yet openly part of the coalition in con-
trol of the N.S.W. A.L.P.
Once in office as Attorney-General
and Minister for External Affairs, Dr.
Evatt showed that at least he had no
allergy towards Communists.
He hastened to open a Moscow
Embassy and freed them from the ban
placed on them early in the war when
they turned themselves into allies of
Berlin and plotted to do their best to
disrupt war industries and enlistment in
accordance with Moscow policy before
the Germans' betrayed their Red allies
in June, 1941.
Such facilities were given them, even
before the bans were taken off and
they began to receive “favored-nation”
treatment, that seven out of 13 mem-
bers of the trade-union industrial panel
assembled to advise Dr. Evatt’s leader
and Prime Minister, John Curtin, were
leading Communists, most of them on
the Central Committee of the party.
After the war, with the foundation
of U.N., Dr. Evatt attracted inter-
national criticism by following the main
Communist lines of policy. The occupa-
tion of Japan saw him on the side of
the Russian representative in Tokyo and
against General Macarthur, and he fol-
lowed, and is still following, the pur-
poseful Moscow line of no forgiveness
for Japan at any price, a line which
Moscow hoped would assure that Japan
would be brought behind the Iron
Curtain.
The Petrov Commission saw him
siding with Communist counsel before
the commission. He became so emo-
tional over the whole matter that he
was prepared to allege that the Govern-
ment or Security had been guilty of
wholesale forgery and invention in order
to convict innocent Communists.
When his behavior had brought about
the withdrawal by the judges of his
right to appear before the commission,
he turned on the principal opponents
of the Communist party in the A.L.P.,
sought to drive them nut of the party,
and was prepared to take the word of
Molotov, to whom he wrote, on the
question of Soviet' espionage in Aus-
tralia rather than the solemn findings of
three Australian judges.
Since then he has had the full sup-
port of the Communist party. The pages
of the Communist press testify the
esteem in which he has been held and
the loyalty with which the C.P. has sup-
ported him.
But now, suddenly, Laving made no
protest against the fact that every Com-
munist in the country was backing him
during the election campaign, he last
week, according to the admiring Sydney
“Herald,” “in one of the most out-
spoken speeches he has yet made to a
Labor body,” bitterly condemned the
Victorian branch for not carrying out
the decisions of the A.L.P. over unity-
tickets ; quoted the rules and policy of
the party; said that the Labor party
was pledged against unity-tickets and
those pledges must be carried out; and
denounced association of A.L.P. men
with Communists.
The Communists are not likely to be
much disconcerted by his antics.
Having been brought up on the Leninist
axiom that “tactics change according to
the flow and ebb,” a temporary change
of line will not worry them. ->
They will remember that the Evatt
who, as Minister for Security, denounced
them for their machinations against the
Rocket Range in 1946 was the same
Evatt who fought so hard to defeat
the Menzies referendum aimed at ban-
ning the Communist party, and who
alleged that the Petrov Commission
was a Menzies’ conspiracy.
The A.L.P. must be desperately hard-
up for leaders, or somehow desperately
implicated with the Left, when it clings
to such a weathercock.
A Good Day’s Disruption
Compared with other Government
employees, Victorian railwaymen are not
well paid ; according to A.R.U. estimates,
the average railwayman takes home £l2
a week after paying tax and superannua-
tion, and first-class tradesmen net less
than £ls a week. Other Government
employees get a service grant of 10s. a
week after a year’s service and £1 after
two years.
Instead of applying in the normal way
to the accepted channel, the arbitration
court, the militant bosses of the A.R.U.
last week staged a midday stoppage from
which the effects spread to the evening
peak-hour ostensibly to gain public
support for their claim.
The stoppage could have only one
effect —to antagonise public opinion, but
the opportunity to disrupt a major
service was too good for the militants to
miss.
The result was that most trains did not
run for three hours and some for much
longer ; country trains were held-up for
two hours ; thousands of passengers, in-
cluding women with young babies, were
locked out from the stations behind grilles,
and the strikers marched around the inner
city to the Treasury Gardens where they
were harangued by the ex-priest, J. J.
Brown.
It all seemed a little familiar, reminis-
cent of the railway strikes of a decade
ago, which Jacky Brown also led so
disastrously.
In the meantime Brown has at times
suffered eclipses in union-leadership, and
profited to some extent in his approaches
to the public. At the height of his power,
his attitude to the suffering train-public
was pugnacious ; but last week a hypo-
critical statement “by the chief executive-
officers of the A.R.U.” was issued after
the march “regretting the stoppage.”
Brown was silent.
It has, in fact, been an open secret for
some time in the railway industry that
the railways commissioners would not
oppose the more reasonable claims of
the A.R.U. at an arbitration-court hear-
ing, and Sir Arthur Warner, the Minister,
has always been prepared to hear the
union and give a characteristically blunt
and forthright answer.
The march, therefore, was a stoppage
for a stoppage’s sake.
National Superannuation
It is to be hoped that Mr. L. E. Bury’s
remarks in the House of Representatives
on the need for a contributory and
universally applied pension scheme, free
of the means-test, will bear early fruit.
Any such scheme should have the
support of all parties, since Dr. Evatt
has already clearly committed himself
to the abolition of the means-test,
and it is understood the Commonwealth
Government has before it a workable
plan under which it would be possible to
carry such a measure.
At present the old-age pensions scheme
is entirely inequitable. Everybody pays,
but the more a taxpayer contributes the
less he is likely to get. It is particularly
inequitable in the case of old people
who have been well-to-do in middle-age,
lose their means after having paid hun-
dreds or thousands to support the social-
welfare funds, and find themselves at
the pensionable age with just enough
assets to prevent them benefiting from
their contributions.
In an age of full employment and high
wages it should be possible for every
person to provide for old-age through a
national scheme. It would be even pos-
sible to have a flexible scheme —such a
plan is under discussion in the U.K. —
under which a contributor could select
the scale on which he is prepared to both
pay and benefit.
With the development of large-scale
business, such as banks and heavy-
industry concerns, more and more groups
of employees are being provided for, some
on a very generous scale. And if a
company with a few thousand employees
can carry-out such plans, there seems to
be no reason why the national Treasury
can’t organise the arrangement.
The medical-benefits plan is a pilot-
plant which has been eminently success-
ful, and it costs the Commonwealth a
little over £8 million a year. Old-age
pensions now account for nearly
half the outlay of the National Welfare
Fund under the Social Services Act,
1947-57. They showed an advance this
year on the Estimates of £10.5 million
over the previous year, or roughly 8 per
cent., and consume £132 million, apart
from funeral benefits, medical and
pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners


which tot-up to another £7 million.
As Leslie Bury remarked, the means-
test encourages people to be extravagant
so that they can get a pension, but
though the £l2O million which Bury
says the abolition of it would cost may
be a “formidable amount,” it represents
a cheap insurance-rate for super-
annuation.
If the abolition of the means-test were
found impracticable, at least there should
be some relaxation of the rule which
makes it mandatory for perfectly hale and
capable workers at 65 to become loafers
and struggle along on the present sop to
existence. What there is against their
doubling their pension-earnings only a
politician or a soulless manipulator of
the labor market in the interest of the
union secretary’s tyranny could deduce.
Tasmanian Deadlock
Tasmania’s first election under the rules
devised to avoid deadlocks has resulted
in a deadlock after all. Distribution of
preferences went according to first pre-
dictions in four electorates, but in Frank-
lin, where Labor had been counting on
a four-three result, the D.L.P. and Inde-
pendent preferences reversed this, giving
the Liberals four seats to three.
The overall position is that in Braddon
and Wilmot Labor won the odd seat; in
Franklin it went to the Liberals, and in
Bass and Denison each party won three
seats, with Independents Turnbull and
Wedd getting the seventh. Distribution
of seats in the new assembly will now
be: Labor 17, Liberals 16, Indepen-
dents two.
Amendments made to the Electoral Act
last year provided that when the two
major parties each won 17 seats, or if
one of them won 18 and the other 17,
the party with the smallest aggregate of
primary votes should provide the Speaker
and Chairman of Committees, thus avoid-
ing a deadlock. The present contingency
—l7 to 16, with two Independents—
wasn’t provided for.
On Friday Liberal leader Jackson said
that he had a proposal to make which
would enable the Government of the
State to be carried on. It was at first
assumed that he was going to offer to
supply a Speaker and Chairman of Com-
mittees, but it now appears that what
he has in mind is a coalition Government.
The Labor party has always opposed
the idea of coalitions, but Tasmanian
Labor has often shown an island inde-
pendence of mainland doctrine, so appa-
rently Jackson thinks it worth while
making the offer. In effect there wouldn’t
be much difference between a Labor-
Liberal coalition and the type of hand-
cuffed Labor Government of recent years.
An alternative Premier Reece will no
doubt consider is to offer the Speakership
to Independent Wedd.
The Australian Idyll
In most recent years the Americans have
sent to Melbourne as guests of the
Commonwealth and the Australian-
American Association for the Coral Sea
celebrations such celebrities as General
I. D. White, Admiral Felix B. Stump,
Lieut.-Gen. James Doolittle and Lieut.-
Gen. Bruce C. Clarke, all better-known
names to Australians than General
Laurence S. Kuter, C.-in-C. of the U.S.
Air Forces in the Pacific.
None of these distinguished servicemen,
however, was as stimulating or compelling
as the tall, earnest, quietly-spoken airman,
the official guest at last week’s services,
who is deeply concerned at the build-up
of the Red China Air Force, which he
regards as a major threat to South-East
Asia and the free world.
Kuter’s information is that the Red
China Air Force is now one of the biggest
in the world, and in recent years has
begun to concentrate on quality rather
than the quantity sought in earlier years,
although it is still equipped with second-
hand Russian weapons and is still inferior
in the quality of its pilots to Nationalist
China’s and America’s.
The General wants more U.S. planes
and units on Australian bases and
R.A.A.F. units on U.S. bases in the North
Pacific ; and, of course, the anniversary
of the Coral Sea battle which commem-
orates not only the battle itself but the
common effort made by Americans and
Australians in the Pacific, is the appro-
priate time to emphasise the continuing
importance of the two nations’ co-opera-
tion and goodwill. •
The U.S. Air Force in the Pacific is
spending a' million dollars a day, and the
U.S. Navy expenditure in the same area
is higher. It was also the appropriate time
for General Kuter to mention this to
some touchy friends sunning themselves
comfortably behind this screen.
Aircraft Policy
Two United States aqcraft-manufac-
turers have missions in the Common-
wealth pressurising the Government to
buy their fighters on the ground that
the Sabres now in service are obsolete.
They are, of course, by present stan-
dards, though whether those standards
are practical standards for Australia or
any other country only the test of actual
warfare can tell.
The abolition of Coastal Command
in the R.A.F. and the gradual diminution
of fighter-squadrons and their replace-
ment by bomb-carriers and guided-
missiles seem to point to an age in which
the conception of the fighter is in itself
obsolescent, if not obsolete.
Machines like the Voodoo, recently in
Australia with the American squadron
which came for Coral Sea celebrations,
appear to offer the most limited possi-
bilities for a country with small defence
resources and manpower.
Most existing Australian aerodromes
could not accommodate them. Their speed
is said to be of a maximum order of
1400 m.p.h. and their ceilings round
60,000 feet. Their stalling-speed is not
far short of 200 m.p.h.
To fly and fight this kind of aerial
monster needs a special kind of man
with a special kind of training.
In time of combat men and aircraft
must be expendable at a tremendous and
expensive rate.
It is doubtful whether it is worth
while for Australia to have more than
a few of this kind of novelty, and
whether it would not be much wiser
policy to concentrate on anti-submarine
reconnaissance-bombers and on ground-
missiles of range well beyond the coast,
plus adequate land and civil-defence
forces.
The whole defence policy, so far as
the public knows, is immature in respect
of the new age of warfare. Behind the
scenes there may be concrete and consoli-
dated ideas ; but it is necessary if defence
schemes are to have the full support of
the country that they should not only
be effective but that those who pay for
them should be able to see that they have
a chance of being effective.
Vanishing Fauna
According to C. J. Lauer, who is chair-
man of the Fauna Protection Council,
Australian fauna is rapidly diminishing
because the trapping and trade in Aus-
tralian birds and animals has become
big business, and commercial organisa-
tions in a number of States are trading
in fauna which is protected under State
laws but loses protection when sent or
sold to another under Section 92 of the
Constitution.
While they do not go the whole length
of Mr. Lauer’s claims, a body of weighty,
official opinion in Victoria agrees with
much of what he asserts. Moreover,
there is some evidence that the State from
which most of the exporting is made is
Victoria, although the Victorian fauna
laws, which generally prohibit both trap-
ping and mere possession, are at least
among the strictest in Australia.
South Australia is one of the easiest
States in which to get a permit to take
birds ; very few, if any, permits to take
parrots and cockatoos are refused,
according to Victorian authorities, and
there are more frequent open-seasons in
South Australia than in other States.
Since the relevant Constitutional sec-
tion lays down that trade between the
States must be free, it is not possible
for Victorian authorities to prosecute —
or, if possible, to do so with any real
prospect of success —when the trader
claims his birds have been bought in
South Australia; and what is more
galling is the difficulty of proving a
suspicion that a cage of cockatoos has
not been trapped in S.A. but actually in
Victoria.
There is no doubt there is illegal trap-
ping in Victoria. A proportion of this
is by New Australians who also are
responsible partly for the rapid develop-
ment in the State which is depriving
some breeds of their natural habitats.
Official opinion is that Australian fauna
is diminishing by illegal trapping, but
not to the same great extent that the
open-season on finches in Queensland
and the Northern Territory produced.

YI/hen my 13-year-old son arrived

wheedled the proprietor. “Chicken’s only
half-price, and the pork ...” I shook my
head, and added that business looked
far too good for such reductions to be in
order. “Good! ” He snorted fiercely about
the crowded tables. “Look again
and tell me if you see anyone eating,” he
demanded. “Just tell me!” I looked, but
found no exceptions to allay his suspic-
ions. “Every day they come and pack up
my place and order coffee. Just coffee.
And they sit and sip and stare and never
eat. Never eat. And if I switch it off
they just get up and go along to watch
it in the window of the corner shop, and
still they do not eat.” 1 left reflecting that

“Warihi”: Further to “Piketrailer’s”
par. (B. 1/4/’59) about the derivation of
“gringo”: About 40 years ago, returning
from a war, I passed through the U.S.
and heard an ex-military man recite how
in the Mexican War, 1845-46, the U.S.
had recruited two or more companies,
exclusively Irish (just as the 69th Divi-
sion, based on New York is wholly Irish).
One of these companies used “Green
Grow the Rushes-O” as a marching-song.
You couldn’t get a better time-keeper ;
and in the days of footslogging the
officers were more than keen on march-
ing-songs. The Brazilian War of 1848 is
impossible as a source of the term
“gringo”; they were English regiments in
those days, and the singing of Irish songs
was just not done.

beaten hands-down by a dress Lady Jay

these appeared in the places they did,
suggests that it was “designed” in more
ways than one. Two large round ones
appeared over the beauty-resorts
popularised by Sabrina, whilst the stern

ing touch was just below the waist and
announced to all that it was “Not wanted

all these to my lady ... the kitchen is

I am correct about 2GB’s call-sign origin.

radio-engineer George Beard, but, as I
stated, those of the Italian philosopher
Giordano Bruno. 2GB was started by the
Theosophical Society, an organisation
which teaches Eastern philosophy and
which includes that most ancient doctrine
or reincarnation. Long before engineers
were sought to build the station, it was
decided to use a call-sign which would
honor the foremost Theosophist of the
day who, it was believed, in a previous
incarnation was Bruno. Millions
of folk who subscribe to the tenets of
Hinduism and Buddhism would find
nothing queer in the belief.

One parish clerk even used the spelling,
Peers. Though regarded as Cornish, this
clan came from Flanders in the time of
Henry VIII and anglicised their name
during Stuart times for safety’s sake. Only
one was immortalised: Tom Pearse,
whose old grey mare failed to return from

and spoke of putting them on. “You’d

moment they were handcuffed, face to

they thought it very funny ; then they
suggested I take the cuffs off. “I told

“They’re Government property. If you

“and have the key here on the midday

lady to put you in a double room, and

“They’ll Tell You About Me”
By ALEC CHISHOLM
Editor-in-chief “The Australian Encyclopaedia”
I borrow this title from a
set of jaunty verses con-
tributed by lan Mudie to
The Bulletin in 1952, and
which (so I gather) will appear
shortly in his new book, The
Blue Crane.
Those lines, an engaging
summary of Australian legend
and folklore, appealed to me
at the time, and they’ve been
recalled by portions of H. P.
(“Duke”) Tritton’s Bulletin
reminiscences and by certain
comments that were published
recently in the London “Daily
Telegraph.”
The English writer, when
reviewing the new 10-vol.
A ustralian Encyclopaedia,
acclaimed the “unusual” reada-
bility of the work, approved
the fact that “the racier and
more picturesque sides of Aus-
tralian life, no less than the
more solemn aspects, receive
full treatment,” and then came
up with the discovery that the
entry on Wild White Men is
longer than the article on
Wheat Q and that Bushranging
occupies more space than
Banking.
Bless that London scribe’s
heart! He has told us some-
thing that we ourselves, the
compilers of the A.E., did not
know —it did not occur to our
pure minds to compare Bush-
ranging with Banking —and he
has justified the belief that it
would be worth while to
include references, however
brief in some instances, to
colorful sidelights of Australia’s
story.
"IVTor is he alone in that. From
Canada, for another
example, there has come a
letter indicating that the writer
was reading the more formal
entries in the A.E. as a kind of
obligation, but was attracted
to a greater extent by what he
termed “the odd bits.”
Personally, I’ve had some-
thing of a weakness for Austral-
oddities ever since (quite a
while ago) I was a youngster
in the bush of Victoria ; and,
of course, a taste of the kind
is apt to strengthen as the
subjects become- more-or-less
traditional.
Anyway, it seemed to me
that a national encyclopaedia,
if it was to be done thoroughly,
should include a fair sprink-
ling of “odd bits,” partly as
foils to the more prosaic
articles, but mainly because of
their essential Australianism —
and because some of them
are often the subject of argu-
ment.
The first edition of the A.E.
(1925) contained only a few
entries of the kind. True, it
carried discussions on Wild
White Men and Two-up (which
I had a hand in writing), but
it neglected lots of other
“national institutions,” among
them the Swagman, the
Wowser, the Larrikin, and even
The Man from Snowy River.
So, then, in assembling a list
of such subjects we had to start
virtually from scratch, relying
on our own recollections and
on a couple of informative
reference - books, Edward
Mor r i s’s A ustral English
(1898) and, more importantly,
Sidney J. Baker’s The Austra-
lian Language (1945).
lan Mudie’s assessment of
’52, “They’ll tell you about
me,” may not have extended
our list —though its coverage
ranged from Fisher’s Ghost to
the Tantanoola Tiger—but, at
least, it provided a useful
check, at the same time con-
firming our idea that all such
picturesque subjects needed
seemly attention in an encyclo-
paedia. For, as may be
remembered, Mudie’s “Me”
was a composite of national
fragments:
Me—yesterday I was rumor,
today I am legend,
tomorrow, history....
For anyone to kill me he'd have
to kill
every single Australian,
every single one of them,
every single one.
'T'he compiling of a list of
potential entries of the
kind did not of itself present
many difficulties. Mainly, it
entailed little more than the
exercise of judgment in decid-
ing which among a small host
of subjects merited notices, and
whether, in particular cases, a
topic should be made part of
a general article or be run
under its own heading.
Should the Bombora, the
Bullocky, and the Brumby be
given attention? What of old-
timers such as the Currency
Lads and the Sydney Ducks?
And what of various oddments
such as the Jimmy Woodser,
the Guyra Ghost, and the Min-
Min Light?
Each of these subjects, along
with dozens of others, was
“valued” on whatever merit it
possessed—as an Austral-oddity
and a source of argument.
Also, since we were not pro-
ducing a dictionary, and since
Sidney Baker was contributing
an article on Australian Eng-
lish, our choice was restricted
to terms having certain social
or geographical significance,
or, maybe, having something
in the nature of “stories” to
support them.
We ran an article on Shout-
ing, for example, because of
the goldfields origin of the
word and because there was
once an Anti-shouting Society
in Sydney ; and we gave, too,
a paragraph to its antithesis,
the Jimmy Woodser, because
the term is still current and
because it figures in the verse
of both Barcroft Boake and
Henry Lawson.
Similarly, the term Wowser
demanded notice for several
“I thought I Was the one supposed to say ‘Ah,’ Doctor !”
reasons, including its place in
Australian social history and
the confusion surrounding its
origins ; and, if one may say
so, the article we produced on
this subject goes well beyond
the usual bald statement that
the word was capriciously
coined by John Norton.
The Swagman and the Sun-
downer got by as a matter of
course: they were once a very
distinctive feature of bush life.
Clancy of the Overflow and
The Man from Snowy River
gained notices for a similar
reason, or, rather, because they
are part of the Australian
tradition.
Much the same idea moved
us to give attention —brief but
not lacking reverence! —to
Fisher’s Ghost, the Guyra
Ghost, the Bunyip, and
the Tantanoola Tiger. And, of
course, we were obliged to
chatter at rather more length
about such renowned curiosi-
ties as Two-up, Larrikins, and
the story of “Waltzing
Matilda.”
As for geographical oddities,
the Kindur River had to
be awarded a note to itself
because, although once a sub-
ject of keen interest, it never
existed ; but certain other terms
were incorporated in general
articles—the Never-Never, for
instance, in the article on the
Bush (along with Back o’
Bourke, West o’ Sunset, the
Overland, and sundry other
trifles in kind), and the popu-

“Granny” Herald campaigned with
valiant fury against M.P.s’ pay-rises, but
to suggest to the A.L.P. conference —as

insignificance” is rather like flogging a

Although the appointment of Austra-
lian National Airlines Commission
chairman Warren McDonald as first
chairman of the new Commonwealth
Banking Corporation was a surprise, no
one who knows him will dispute its
soundness. A man of wide business
experience, McDonald has been a mem-
ber of the Airlines Commission for
seven years and its chairman for two.
Earlier the Chifley Government
appointed him as adviser on building
costs to the Federal Prices Com-
missioner.
There was an element of surprise, too,
in the choice of E. B. Richardson for
managing - director. At present he’s
deputy-governor of the Commonwealth
Bank. A. N. Armstrong, general-
manager of the Commonwealth Trading
Bank, will be deputy managing-director
of the Banking Corporation.
Announcing these appointments,
Acting Prime Minister McEwen said
the corporation would not come into
operation until late this year, but it
was necessary to go ahead with the
planning of staff and accommodation ;
the setting-up of the Commonwealth
Development Bank and the integration
of the Trading Bank, Savings Bank and
Development Bank into the framework
of the corporation.

Siberia is no longer the dread place
of exile it used to be. Dr. A. Bordadin,
a Russian official visiting Britain, told
a gathering at Margate that it was now
a comfortable place, attractive to the

manpower shortage and of the difficulty
of getting workers for remote areas,
especially for a new diamond-field re-
cently discovered in one of the coldest
parts of the U.S.S.R. How did they
persuade workers to go to such places?
Quite easily. “We are overcoming this
particular problem of recruitment by
drafting men to these areas.” He should
know. He’s Deputy Minister for Labor

An optimistic note on the housing-
problem is struck in the quarterly journal
of the N. S. Wales Rural Bank, which
claims that if the present building-rate
is maintained Australia’s housing-scarcity
will disappear by 1961. The number of
flats completed last year was
nearly 80,000; the number begun was
77,000 and the number under construc-
last figure is low in comparison with
previous years, but there has been a very
big improvement in the rate of construc-
tion ; last year the average home took
just over six months to finish, compared
with nearly 11 months five years ago.
The bank warns that although the
current shortage will be ended by 1961,
a steep increase in the number of people
reaching marriageable age may be
expected between 1965 and 1970. This
will create a renewed demand for homes.

Australians drink far more wine than
they did in prewar days. Twenty years

Quoting these figures at the 100th meet-

“Wusslean”: The suggestion made by
the National Capital Development Com-
mission that “Australians should be
encouraged to regard a visit to Canberra
as in the nature of a national pilgrimage”
is an excellent one, calculated to elevate
a trip to Canberra to something far
above mere tourism. But a pilgrimage,
as my dictionary puts it, is essentially a
journey to a place that is held sacred —
and there lies a difficulty. Canberra today
—particularly since the debate on Parlia-
mentary salaries—can scarcely be said
to be held in veneration by the Australian
people. Perhaps it needs someone to do
for the place what Thomas a’Becket did
for Canterbury. Who of our Senators

“Lumee” : The three-hour stoppage of

as to the fate of returning peak-hour

home with little more delay than normal,
(my husband had a seat all the way for the
first time in four years), the dailies high-
lighted the plight of pram-pushers queue-
ing in “thousands” for the 3 p.m. reopen-

mums trundle their toddlers to the city
in ignorance or from urgent necessity?
Or are keen shoppers undeterred by such

While fisheries-research work has been

with the exception of one group, there

will soon find it. It seems we’re neglect-
ing some of our best natural resources.

duced by coal-fuelled plants. Costs were
being progressively reduced and the
station at present under construction at
Hinkley Point would probably be the
first to break-even in costs with con-

Forty - two - year - old Senator Branson
from W.A. aims to dispel the belief that
Senators are elderly men. He takes par-
ticular exception to references to “the
old men of the Senate,” and he wants
Senator Spooner, as Leader of the
Government in the Senate, to compile a
statement showing the average age of
senators compared with the average age
of M.H.R.s ; the average age of Govern-
ment Senators compared with Opposition
Senators ; the average age of Senators
in the new Senate (after July 1).
Although it is unfair to equate Senate
and senility and it is probably true that
the average age of Senators has dropped
in recent years, Senator Spooner is going
to have a hard tussle getting the informa-
tion asked for. Once they pass the 60

“Ex-ACT” unearths a scrap of
Hughesiana:
In 1940, when it appeared that John Curtin
had been defeated in Fremantle, Billy Hughes,
then Attorney-General in the Menzies Govern-
ment, was moved to express some pubjic regret.
This brought him an acid telegram from the
National Party Council in Perth, expressing
“strong resentment of remarks credited to
you in the press in connection with the defeat
of Mr. Curtin ... You are reported as deplor-
ing his defeat/’
The council went on to say it “not only
resents your intervention in this vein, but wishes
you to know it is intensely proud of Mi'. Lee’s
victory, which has proved a tonic for the whole
Nationalist movement in this State and, the
people of Australia generally.”
A few days later Hughes was able to con-
gratulate Curtin on holding the seat after all.
In doing so, he mentioned the National Party
telegram, and apparently Curtin asked him for
a copy.
Hughes sent it to him, with a handwritten
note: “My dear Curtin, I enclose telegram
about which 1 spoke. Please return to the
miserable worm to whom it is directed.
Yours, W. M. Hughes.”

familiar to Diggers of War 1 on Gallip.

“Collins Street”: The head of Scot-

Patrick, one of those clergymen capable
of articulating forthright views on the
current scene, whom England seems to
nurture and we don’t, has arrived in
Melbourne to take-on the formidable task
of rector of St. Silas’ Church, North
Balwyn.
The suburb (which looks well-heeled,
but is also known as Mortgage Hill)
under his ministry is fondly expected by
the Church of England to produce a new
£35,000 church, among other things, in
the next seven years.
Before his appointment to St. Silas’ by
Dr. Woods, the Archbishop of Mel-
bourne, (an old acquaintance), he put in
more than two years in Wongan Hills
(W.A.), but before that he had had a
long association with the Woods church-
men. The archbishop’s father, Bishop
Woods, offered him a post in 1946, and
he also succeeded a Woods as com-
mandant of the chaplains’ centre, Central
Mediterranean—the Ven. R. W. Woods,
the archbishop's brother.
The archbishop, the venerable and the
rector became lieutenant-colonels almost
simultaneously.
His ministry will be lively. His ancestry,
incidentally goes back to Queen Jane
Beaufort. He likes Australians, but he
is critical of our pubs—and he hasn’t yet
had an eyeful of the Melbourne six-
o’clock swill—our politicians, our bureau
crats and our snobs. A prescient feliow,
it won’t be long before he discovers we

Boorooloola, through what was then
wild and dangerous country round the
Gulf. In 1915 he took-up Helen Springs
(1200 square-miles; about 100 miles
north of Tennant Creek). In 1929 he
was the first to transport cattle south by
train from The Alice after the railway
opened from Oodnadatta. Five years


later he took the first consignment of
gold-ore from the diggings at Tennant
Creek to Petersburg (S.A.), where the
nearest battery was working. A cartage
of 300 miles by road and 800 by rail,
this was the longest trip of that kind

A thought that kept recurring in an
interview with Sydney’s St. Andrew’s
Cathedral organist and master of the
choristers Mervyn J. Byers was what a
rare amount of wide experience, generally
unheard of, backs-up some men in their
jobs. In his case it came out under a sort of
third-degree treatment, and went (packing it
tightly) something on these lines:
Born in Sydney, 1924; studied piano and
organ with G. Faunce Allman; put in five years
in the Army; was then recommended by
Goossens to go to England for advanced
studies. Left Australia, 1951; studied organ
with Dr. Pritchard, and, while doing the three-
year B.Mus. course at London University,
completed his Associateship of the Royal College
of Organists and an R.C.O. diploma-course on
church-music. In 1953 was approved and
admitted to a panel of 8.8. C. recitalists; was
organist and master of the choristers at Brid-
lington Priory for five years, simultaneously
holding the post of music-master at three
schools; was recommended to the Sydney job
(when it fell vacant in 1957) by Gerald Knight
and Sir William McKie; took-over in November
that year . . .
And, well, the cathedral music-repertoire has
more than doubled since his appointment. As
well as training 30-odd choristers and 12 choir-
men he conducts the St. Andrew’s Choral
Society; and he’s also diocesan and provincial
representative of the Royal School of Church
Music. And maybe it should be added that
at the start of this interview he satisfied himself
with the hard-backed chair, saying, “You take
the corpfortable one.”
One particular record—among many
others —that E. W. (“Slip”) Carr has
reason to be proud of is that he and his
son Edmund (now a doctor practising at
Blacktown, N.S.W.) are the only succes-
“SLIP"
sion of father and son to have represented
any country in the Olympic Games.
“Slip" captained the Australian team at
Paris in 1924, and Edmund, Empire
quarter-mile record-holder, ran at Hel-
sinki in 1952. The family-records don't
stop there, either. “Slip’s” father and
“Slip's” eldest brother and himself were
the only combination of a father and
two sons to have represented Australia
at Rugby Union against New Zealand.
Sketched herewith, “Slip” Carr was
Australasian sprint - champion (100yds.
and 220yds.) and world-record holder
for the 60 metres, at Prague. At the
height of his fame in the 1920’s he ran
56 races in Europe, including England,
Norway and Sweden, and won 55 of
them, capping the performance by win-
ning the King’s Shield and the King’s
Cup at Wembley (Eng.). He went from
Sydney Grammar to War I at 17, joining
the 2nd Brigade Mounted Machine Gun
Squadron, and in War 11, as superinten-
dent of P. and R.T. in Southern Com-
mand, he put Don Bradman up for his
commission. Now he is an executive with
John Dynon and Sons, hotel-suppliers in
Sydney—a firm that has gathered a lot
of sporting talent on its staff. Among
others in the co. are Neil Harvey, Keith
Holman and “Tiger” Black.

Queen Ann mansion on the banks of

across the bridge at Glasbury, from
Wales into England and back again, from
England into Wales (the border there
follows the course of the river). He held
me spellbound, telling me his own story
of the events leading to the charge of
the Light Brigade, taken from his book,
then recently published, The Campaign
of 1854-55, and adding provocative obiter
dicta, some of which appeared in his
autobiography, Calico Pie, and some of
which could never be published for many

When Sydney and its surroundings
develop a real summer thirst and water-
consumption sneaks up towards 327-
million gallons a day, it is the thankless
responsibility of Arthur Rudd i c k
Stafford, as secretary of Sydney Water
Board, to sign his name to notices of water-
restrictions. It’s rather an unfair distinction
for a man whose larger, if lesser-known, respon-
sibility is the smooth and economic administra-
tion of a £l4O-million public utility employing
over 9000 people ranging from engineers,
solicitors and doctors to divers, ditch-diggers
and dust-counters.
Apart from administrative ability, the job
would seem to call for other talents, and
Stafford has a reputation for reducing an
argument to its essentials more quickly and
thoroughly than most people. In fact, it is
a murmured warning among the ranks to
addicts of departmental jargon that “You’ve
never been stood-up until Staff.'s had a piece
of you,” and then the hopeful addendum, “but
he’s a very fair bloke.”
A very fair sort of bloke, too: at 13 he
was dux of his school, at 16 he topped the
SEC. WITH £140-MILLION
public-service entrance-exam., at 18 he joined
the A.I.F. on August 13, 1914, at 19 he landed
on Gallipoli on April 25, copped the lot on
the same day and was discharged eight months
later. He returned to the Public Works Depart-
ment, was paymaster on Avon Dam for 5|
years, and then an inspector of accounts all
over N.S.W. until 1928, when he was picked
as an ‘‘outstanding administrative officer” to
join the Water Board. He was the board’s
chief accountant for 16 years and took-over
as secretary in 1956.

ABORIGINALITIES
HPhe American birdologist E. T. Gilliard,
author of a large and handsome book
entitled Living Birds of the World, has
got himself woefully mixed regarding
certain activities of Australia's yellow-
tailed thornbill—the familiar “tomtit:”
The nest of this little bird, Gilliard
announces, contains “several chambers,
the uppermost of which is used for the
rearing of the young,’’ while “the lower
chambers take the form of more or less
complete nests and are thought to be
sleeping-quarters for the male.” Actually,
each nest of this thornbill contains only
two compartments, and it’s the lower one
(with side-entrance) that serves as the
egg-chamber, whereas the top one is
merely a cup-shaped depression that
doesn’t appear to serve any practical pur-
pose at all. The only case in which I’ve
heard of the balcony-room being defi-
nitely used was one recorded recently
by a Queensland bird-observer. He re-
lated that he found a tomtit’s nest with
four eggs in the lower chamber and five
eggs upstairs. But the top batch didn’t

belong to the thornbill—it was the pro-

anguish—when I do a bit of branding—
the “moo” becomes “oo!” It only needs
a couple of half-broken voices in the
class during singing-lesson to reproduce
sounds reminiscent of a stockyard on
sale-day. Moo, murr, burr —I’ve had
’em all!

“Santa Gertrudis”: The importance
that buffaloes are assuming in the beef-
world may be gauged by the opening of
a buffalo-station, Point Stuart, about 120
miles east of Darwin, where there are
about 40,000 buffaloes grazing on 700
square-miles of swampy plains. Here the
buffs will be tamed before being mustered
for shipment to Hong Kong. Horses are
now being broken-in to round ’em up.

“Baggo”: The sugar-bag, so valuable
to North Queenslanders for hand-trans-
port, has ended its 75 years of service
to the sugar-industry. The last consign-
ment of bagged sugar has left Towns-
ville on its way to the refinery ; in future
sugar will be bulk-handled, transported
from the mills in covered rail - wagons
to the 150,000-ton shed now being built
at Townsville wharf. Conveyors will
transfer the sugar from wagons to shed,
and a travelling-belt will channel it into
ships.

“A.M.R.”: While living on Tanna, in
the New Hebrides, I used to handle small
quantities of sandalwood brought in for
trade. The few trees that had been
found appeared to have come from the
north of the island. labwat, chief of
Loanbakel, a sparsely-populated, heavily-
timbered northern district, was a pal of
mine, and he explained matters this way:
“That fella nickibis [local dialect name]
him all-same one debil. You go look-
cut him, him he hide! You gammon
you no look-out. You walk-about no
more. Him he come out, you look! My
word! Me no gammon, masita!” One
good season, when I was chasing pigeon
in thick jungle in my friend's district,
with him along as guide, a pigeon
fluttered to a branch straight above my
head, and I fired. As the bird fell, the
chief, dramatically pointing to the bole of
the tree, exclaimed: “You see, masita?
He true! This nickibis him he no hide.
Him he savvy you-me no look-out him!”
I stared, speechless, at the trunk of the
largest sandalwood-tree it has ever been
my luck to see, before or since!

“Tabba”: At one end of River Street
in Mackay (Q.) the roadway skirts a
tidal creek for 200yds. or so. In.that
distance there are three notices declaring
that it is an offence to deposit refuse.
Everybody knows it as Dump Creek.

“Wommadoo”: Perhaps because
aborigines are scarce in these parts, it’s
a long time since I’ve heard of “th’
blackfella,” once the bush equivalent of
the music-hall comic Irishman. A couple
of examples of his much-quoted doings:
After breakfast he’d build himself a large
cut-lunch, then sit down and eat it so
he wouldn’t have to carry it all morning.
In winter he’d build a tiny fire and sit
right over it, saying a big fire was too
hot —you couldn’t get near it to-get warm.
Some of his sayings became proverbial—•
“As th’ blackfella said when his only
horse died, ‘lf you have stock you must
expect losses’.” And, of course, his wife
gave us “belly-leggin’s” for corsets. Any-
one heard of the old bloke lately?
* * * *
“Bass”: Eighty years ago the sandhills
at Geraldton (W.A.), cleared by the
inexperienced settlers of their natural
cover, flowed under the strong winds
down into the town, filling the streets
and covering houses. Then farmers from
the Greenough Flats gathered seed from
native plants, sowed the sandhills with
it, and saved the town ; but now the
sand is moving again, and this time
they’ve come south to gather marram-
grass from a Perth beach. Marram’s
an importation from the west coast of
Europe, where also it’s planted to halt


w

soil-erosion, and it’s been found better
than any of the native plants to stop
sand-drift along the Westralian coast.
But it poses a knotty problem for the
amateur botanist. Shoots planted in rows
thrive even in moving sand, where prac-
tically nothing else could gain a foothold ;
and it keeps growing upwards as the
windswept sand builds-up around it.
You’d say a plant like that is tough
enough to stand up to competition ; but
once a stand of marram is strong enough
to hold and stabilise the sand, the native
plants take over. Where previously they
couldn’t take root they now thrive ; their
presence causes changes in soil-condition,
producing a situation more suitable to
them than to the marram ; and under
the combination of changed environment
and competition the marram dies-out. If
the marram succeeds at Geraldton there
may not be a tussock of it left there in
30 years' time.

“Archie Macsporran”: After about
half-an-hour one of the speakers at a
western N.S.W. cockey’s convention was
still droning drearily on without saying
anything when a long-suffering member
turned to his neighbor and audibly com-
mented : “He’s the sort of bloke if he
wanted to get to Melbourne from here
he’d go by way of Perth!”

“An Chuidh”: The practice of ringing
a bell, clashing cymbals or banging a tin
while chasing a swarm of bees goes much
further back than the time of early
England quoted by “Bogaduck” (B.
22/4/’59). The earliest authority is
Virgil:
So when you see them streaming forth, a
swarm,
And swimming up through summer’s liquid blue
To starland; when before your charmed gaze
Their dark host lengthens out updn the wind.
Watch them: they always make for leafy bowers
And running waters. Hither follow them
And sprinkle perfumes that 1 show you here.
The waxflower's humble stalk and pounded
balm ;
Clash cymbals, too, and make your kettles
ring:
Behold, all uncompelled they occupy
Their scented chamber, of their own sweet will
They dive, for ever, deep into their nest.
IT"new a boundary-rider who, when he
worked on St. Anne’s, an out-station
of Yarramunda (Q.), didn’t let the lack
of a churn stop him from making his
own butter. He’d put the skimmed cream
in a jar and take it with him on a horse
that had a pronounced jig-jogging gait.
I’ve known him to walk his horse back
so as not to overdo the “churning.”—

“Bicky”: A sister of Rudyard Kipling
has managed to have the Sinatranized
treatment of “The Road to Mandalay”
banned in all British Commonwealth
countries, and the relatives of “Banjo”
Paterson would do well to take similar
action with American Jimmy Rodgers’s
hepped-up version of “Waltzing Matilda,”
now in the hit-parades. What he does to
“billabong” is just not nice at all.
* * * *
“Lindo”: The compatibility of black
swans and white is seen at its best in
Tassie. At Bridgewater, on the Derwent,
a pair of whites forage happily among
hundreds of black swans without any
apparent antagonism, and on Lake Leah
flocks of blacks and whites mingle quite
freely while feeding on the water, sailing
through each other’s lines without
hindrance. They separate when they take
to the air, however, although I have never
been able to detect the signal that sends
all the blacks, or all the whites, aloft
together.

“Orion”: The sun cannot be eclipsed
on any day at or near the time of full
moon. Therefore, the answer to
“Norque's” question (B. 15/4/’59) is
either that the Crucifixion was not at the
full-moon period of the month, or it was
not a solar eclipse that caused darkness
over the face of the earth. Subsequent
errors in calculations of the date may
explain the former possibility. As the
darkness was reported to extend over
three hours, the second possibility has
to be set against the fact that, although
the partial phase may extend over several
hours, a total solar-eclipse cannot last
more than seven minutes.
“Sevenelms”: John Batman decided
on the Yarra bank as the place for a
village, and now —depending on view-
point—the river smells or sparkles. Be-
low Dight’s Falls the tidal-reach flanked
by a tannery and papermill is reasonably
murky, but not, as Merv Skipper states
(B. 11/3/’59), devoid of shipping. It
bore during 1958 four-million tons of
merchandise, which, at the risk of being
comparatively odious, can be assessed
as slightly exceeding the total handled
in Sydney Harbor for the same period.
So much for its last 10 miles. Above
that it embroiders curvaceously the
artists’ havens of Warrandyte and
Launching Place and the pastures of
Lilydale, Healesville and Warburton,
where its catchment-hills sustain the
world’s noblest hardwood, Eucalyptus
regnans. Above Reefton its embankment
stores for Melbourne’s water-supply a
bigger gallonage than Port Jackson hdlds.

“Old Crab”: “Lousy” Mac was, par-
ticularly in regard to straying stock eating
his grass. When old Mick, very much
the worse for wear and ill-equipped to
navigate further at night, camped inside
his fence Mac was there at sun-up to
investigate. “Oh, it’s you Mick?
That’s all right. Stay where you
are.” “I suppose,” said Mick,
“Oi'm welcome—as long as I
don’t bloody well graze!'’

A unique experience, helping
Ted to select half-a-dozen
beer-glasses. By the time I got
to his place he’d narrowed it
down to 15 by a scientific pro-
cess which still has me wonder-
ing.
To select a glass he chills it thoroughly,
then rinses it ; it’s O.K. if it turns uni-
formly frosty. If it doesn’t it’s discarded.
That's the preliminary. The final judging
consists of filling the glass with freshly
opened beer and leaving it stand for an
hour: the test is whether the head stays
on the beer. Ted broke seven because
the head disappeared too soon, and to
prove his point he brought out two of
the biggest and finest glasses I’ve seen.
Shaped like the old pewter-pots, they held
well over a bottle between them and re-
tained the head until the test finished
three hours later. Leisurely? Of course,
befitting the solemnity of the occasion.
Of the eight finalists, two were discarded
becadse they didn’t make the ultimate
grade— set by the pewters—of permitting
the head to follow down the glass as the
contents were imbibed.
Ted reckons he’s now got six near-
perfect beer-glasses. They’ll be kept in
the fridge, and the roof will lift if aught
but beer should ever sully them. He
claims that glass has microscopic pores
and that foreign substances, such as
milk, fill those pores with fats which
reduce the head and flatten the beer. Can’t
vouch for his theory, but I can support
his claim that there can be a terrific
difference in beer drunk from two glasses
which seem to be identical.

Meeting the Mokolkols
By D. M. FIENBERG
IN a report to the United Nations the Administration of the Trust Territory of New Guinea
included the following note:— . .
“The Mokolkol people were visited by Mr. D. M. Fienberg, Assistant District Officer, and
Mr. C. Normoyle, Cadet Fatrol Officer. . . . For more than a quarter of a century the Mokolkols
have been known to the Administration as a small band of primitive nomads, apparently of
Gainings origin, living in the country at the foot of the Gazelle Peninsula. Administratively
they have enjoyed a notoriety disproportionate to their slight numerical importance, through
their long-standing habit of raiding outlying hamlets, wantonly butchering men, women and
children, and disapjiearing without trace. Before the war several patrols endeavored to get into
friendly contact with these people, but they were always met with hostility.”
The patrol-party is about to liead-off into the wild Mokolkol country.
o Continued)
The continuing ability of
a tiny band, adjacent to
civilisation, to harass
the countryside with
impunity—as the wild Mokol-
kols had done for years —
constituted an old and frus-
trating thorn in the profes-
sional pride of the Depart-
ment of District Services and
Native Affairs. While tens of
thousands of savage tribesmen
were being brought under con-
trol each year on the New
Guinea mainland, the Mokol-
kols, right under the noses of
headquarters, continued mer-
rily on their predatory course.
In the early days of Aus-
tralian civil administration
bitter native complaints about
these wildmen had resulted in
attempted applications of the
usual pacification techniques.
At first special patrols were
assigned to make contact and
establish friendly relations.
One such expedition -was Pen-
hallurick’s patrol, in 1931.
After weeks of careful and
arduous work in the inhospit-
able ranges, Penhallurick
located a village on the edge
of a steep ridge. He was
experienced in ordinary
“uncontrolled area” work, and
proceeded accordingly. With
his constabulary he crept up
to the village just before dawn,
laid out gifts of knives, axes,
salt, mirrors and cloth, retired
a little distance, and, as the
sun came up, yodelled in New
Guinea mountain - fashion.
The Mokolkols rushed out,
snatched at the axes, jabbered
excitedly, and fled into the
bush. .
“New” people sometimes
react that way, so Penhallurick
made-camp in the village,
posted guards, and patiently
waited for human curiosity to
overcome primitive timidity.
That is a common method
of extending Government
influence. It nearly always
works, provided you have the
time and the rations, and can
prevent your bored police and
porters from getting into mis-
chief. Once contact is made
with one or two venturesome
souls, others drift in; the
patrol commences trading
razorblades and salt for vege-
tables, dressing sores and
injuries, and generally estab-
lishing friendly relations.
It is a hopeful sign when the
women and children appear —
and the jungle housewife is
quick to appreciate the advan-
tages of commercial salt over
the crude potash substitutes
laboriously prepared from
burning wild-sago roots.
Occasionally there is trickery.
In 1937, in the wild Saruwaket
ranges behind the Rai coast,
the warriors laid down their
bows, and the women and chil-
dren crowded around Assistant
District Officer Nerton in the
friendliest way. He recipro-
cated by sending most of his
police off on jobs, and began
compiling a census. Suddenly
some of the ladies pulled heavy
bush-knives from beneath their
grass-skirts arid chopped at
him. He survived, but lost a
leg.
Penhallurick waited four
days without making any con-
tacts. It was cold and wet
in the mountains, and prob-
ably everyone became a little
bored and careless. I can still
recall the opening words of
Penhallurick\’s patrol - report
diary covering the fifth day:
Drizzling: rain and mist. At
10.20 a.m., as I was sitting in my
tent playing patience, a number of
Mokolkols climbed the vertical side
of the ridge unobserved and raced
through the camp, swinging long-
handled axes.
In that one rush the patrol-
party had two men killed out-
right, and four badly wounded
porters were painfully carried
back to the coast.
Headquarters asked ques-
tions about playing patience in
mid-morning. Obviously, the
Mokolkols were not quite like
ordinary “new” people.
A nd now the District Com-
missioner agreed to my
suggestion that I should join
the venerable ranks of Mokol-
kollers. After McCarthy him-
self—whose duties, plus a war-
souvenir in the form of an un-
predictable knee, precluded
“Well, Jones, did you sell 'em the idea of Wearing silk
shirts and sac-suits ?”
lengthy mountaineering expedi-
tions —I was the most experi-
enced field - officer locally
available.
From a comfortable chair
on the lawn the idea of return-
ing temporarily to the old bush-
walking routine had a certain
nostalgic charm and the
Mokolkols had intrigued me
for years.
Ernie Britten, the stipendiary
magistrate, flouted the law by
wagering a bottle of Scotch
that the mysterious villagers
would prove to be either
Timoips or Japs.
McCarthy agreed to my
claim that four Mokolkols
equalled one month's use of
the precious district trawler.
As the village was definitely
located on the northern side
of the central range-system, it
was decided to go m trom the
north-coast side. We waited a
month before setting-out, partly
in case the unknown villagers
had been disturbed by the air-
craft’s circlings, and partly to
arrive just before the onset of
the north-west monsoon wet-
season, when all good shifting
cultivators should be at home
clearing new garden-sites.
The patrol included 12 native
constabulary, mostly strangers
to me, and two other white
officers. Cadet Patrol Officer
Chris Normoyle, tall and lean
as an areca-palm, was acquir-
ing experience ; Bili Heather,
forestry-officer and first-class
survey-man, wanted to check
the area’s timber-resources.
Two good men, although I’d
have preferred a smaller party.
Extra officers necessitate a
longer carrier-line. At halts
they tend to talk together, and
the simple tribesman with sig-
nificant scraps of local infor-
mation is often too shy to
butt-in on the whiteman’s con-
versation. As we learnt during
the war, that can be dangerous.
In the rain-forest, even' an
experienced field-officer is rela-
tively a blundering ignoramus,
heavily dependent on the
better-educated senses of his
indigenous scouts. On ticklish
jobs most officers prefer to
work alone, with a small hand-
picked team of police.
C'ea-transport was scarce,
but ultimately we loaded
onto the Morobe patrol-
trawler Huon, which had come
over from Lae for minor
repairs. Included in our party
were two morose little survivors
of the Kasalea raid, and two
Bainings tultuls we hoped to
use as interpreters.
We steamed around the
Gazelle and anchored over-
night at Massawa, where an

INVESTMENT IN A FERTILISER EMPIRE
Cuming Smith Analysed
T>ASTURE - IMPROVEMENT has
been a fast-developing
feature of the Australian rural
economy since World War 11,
and the effect on the activities
and finances of producers of
artificial fertilisers has been
marked. -
The main elements added
to the soil in . regular
chemical fertilisers are phos-
phorus (added as superphos-
phate), nitrogen (as ammonium
sulphate) and potash (as
potassium salts, which are im-
ported).
Superphosphate, the main
fertiliser,- is turned-out in Aus-
tralia at the rate of around two-
million tons a year. It is made
from imported phosphate rock
and locally-made sulphuric
acid. The acid (about a million
tons a year) is produced from
either imported sulphur or
from Australian materials that
are mostly by-products of the
mining industry, and which in-
clude pyrites. Mt. Morgan (Q.),
Wallaroo (S.A.) and Mt. Lyell
(Tas.) helped to establish the
Australian fertiliser industry.
“Super.” is one of the few
products which have fallen in
price in recent years. This is
partly because of the drop in
cost of imported brimstone,
and lower freight rates, but also
partly because of increased
efficiency by manufacturers.
Raw materials used represent
70 p.c. of the final cost of super-
phosphate. The cut in price
in some States has been very
substantial, especially in the
case of bulk lots, or quantities
bought during the “off-peak”
months (from July to the end
of the year). The reductions,
however, appear to have been
well within the financial capa-
city of the industry.
Because of drought in some
parts and economic stringency
in others, there was, recently
some levelling-off in the out-
put of superphosphate. But the
long-term outlook of the in-
dustry is one of steadily in-
creasing demand. On the
sulphuric-acid side, it can be
at once said that the monthly
production-figures for acid
represent the most reliable in-
dicator of general industrial
activity that exists, so wide
are the uses of the acid
throughout ou'r economy.
The Cuming Smith Set-up
Cuming Smith and Company,
Ltd., with its office in Mel-
bourne, is the centre of a wide-
spread superphosphate empire
ihat nowadays spreads through
Victoria, W.A., N.S.W. and
Queensland (not in S.A.).
Cuming and Smith came to-
gether in 1872 with the acquisi-
tion of a small sulphuric-acid
business in Melbourne. Other
acids were added to their lines,
and in 1880 the first shipments
of superphosphate were made
to Mauritius in exchange for
sugar. Felton, Grimwade’s
acid-works were taken over in
1897, and in 1900 phosphates
were imported from Nauru for
the first time.
Various other chemicals
were produced as the years
went by. In 1929 the fertiliser
interests of Cuming Smith, Mt.
Lyell Mining, Wischer and Co.,
and Nobel’s (A/asia), Pty., Ltd.,
were merged into one company,
Commonwealth Fertilisers and
Chemicals, Ltd., in which to-
day Cuming Smith is the major
shareholder.
Cuming Smith became a
large shareholder (one-third
interest) also in Cuming Smith
Mt. Lyell Farmers’ Fertilisers,
Ltd. (W.A.), upon the merger
of its W.A. interests with those
of Mt. Lvell and Westralian
Farmers in 1928.
A 19 p.c interest is also held
in Australian Fertilisers, Ltd.,
which has a large works of its
own at Port Kembla and else-
where in N.S.W., as well as a
half-interest in A.C.F. and
Shiileys Fertilisers, Ltd., in
Queensland.
. Cuming Smith, too, as a
vey titbit, owns 200,000 £1
oras. on its own account in
Imperial Chemical Industries
of Australia and N.Z.,
and Commonwealth Fertilisers
owns 1,155,950 ICIANZ £1
ords., acquired by means of
financial cross-stitching in the
course of development. An
indication of the faith of the
group-management in the
fertiliser industry may be
gathered from the fact that in
1957-58 some ICIANZ shares
were sold in order to finance
the purchase of new plant.
Cuming Smith was a family
concern until 1956, when
100,000 £1 ords. were offered to
the public at par, carrying paid
capital up to £1,600,000. Prior
to that —in 1955 —there had
been a one-for-two bonus-issue
of 500,000 ords. financed from
capital reserves.
As an Investment ,
Cuming Smith and Co., Ltd.,
is today purely a holding con-
cern. It receives divs. from its
associated companies after they
have estimated their profits with
obvious conservatism, and then
only after carrying a substantial
part of disclosed earnings to
reserves.
Backing 725. a Share
Last term (to December
31, 1958) its net income
from its investments, after pro-
viding for expenses and taxes,
was £174,027, equal to 10.9 p.c.
on capital, and an 8 p.c. dis-
tribution was paid.
But its equity in the undistri-
buted earnings of its associ-
ated cos. would have raised its
earning-ratio to p.c., in-
cluding the undistributed sur-
plus applicable to its holding
in ICIANZ ; and if the earn-
ings of its chief associate,
Commonwealth Fertilisers, are
calculated in accordance with
its provision for income-tax,
Cuming Smith's overall dis-
closed “equity” profits amount
to over 24 p.c. on its capital.
Taking the two group-hold-
ings of ICIANZ ord. shares
into account at 60s. a share, the
net tangible backing for
Cuming Smith scrip, as revealed
from the accounts of the cos.
in which it holds shares, is 725.
a share.
The holding in ICIANZ
alone (at 60s. a share) is equal
to 28s. 6d. per Cuming Smith
share, leaving the vast fertiliser
interests at a very low valuation.
The price of Cuming Smith
shares has lately been around
395., to give an immediate yield
of 4.1 p.c. The longish-term
prospects seem to be most im-
pressive, especially when con-
sidered in relation to the

Commonwealth Fertilisers
Commonwealth Fertilisers and
Chemicals, Ltd., is the princi-
pal interest of Cuming Smith
and Co., Ltd. Its paid capital
comprises 896,904 7 p.c. £1
prefs. and 2,177,856 £1 ords.,
of which Cuming Smith holds
476,518 prefs. and 1,071,352
ords. (49 p.c. of the total).
It produces superphosphate,
mixed fertilisers, agricultural
chemicals (sheep-dips, etc.), in-
dustrial chemicals and acids
(including sulphuric acid),
made from Australian pyrites,
processed sulphur, etc. The
works are at Yarraville (Vic.).
C.F. and C. also owns
the already - mentioned
1,155,950 fully-paid shares in
Imperial Chemical Industries
(ICIANZ).
Trading profit of C.F. and C.
for the year to June 30 last was
£201,165 (after tax of £195,750),
plus £82,341 net from dividends
and interest. The total of
£283,506 was equal to 10.1 p.c.
on ord. capital, after allowing
for the prefs.
Including undistributed dis-
closed profits of ICIANZ the
rate was 15 p.c. ; and if the
profit of C.F. and C. be
worked-out on the basis of its
provision for taxation, the rate
rises to 20.7 p.c. on ord.
capital.
It paid an ordinary dividend
of 6 p.c. in its last term, which
was well covered on any basis
of profit-computation.
Net tangible backing for the
£1 ords. in C.F. and C. is
£2 10s. a share on its own
book-values, but taking its
holding in 1.C.1. into reckoning
at 60s. a share (current market
is 635.).
Australian Fertilisers
Australian Fertilisers, Ltd.,
had its foundations back in
1886 under the wing of
Colonial Sugar. In 1899 the
project was taken-over by
Elliott Bros., and the product
was marketed by George
Shirley as “Shirleys.”
In 1920 the business was
acquired by Australian Ferti-
lisers, Ltd., which was estab-
lished by Mt. Morgan G.M.
and Electrolytic Refining and

Sydney Slipway
the liquidation of the

there has been concern among
owners of small ships in Syd-
ney who previously used
Mort’s as to how they would
get their ships serviced in
future.
Tug - owners like Adelaide
Steam (Waratah Tug and Sal-

particularly concerned, as
Cockatoo Dock is having
difficulty in looking after new
customers.
To solve their problem,
Adelaide Steam and Fenwick
Holdings, Ltd., have joined
forces to buy Chapman’s Slip
from the liquidators of Mort’s
Dock, and will form a separate
co. (Sydney Slipway and

which Adelaide Steam will be
the larger shareholder, to
operate it.
Price paid for the slip is un-

Minster and Gamma
T3ather surprisingly, the first
authoritative public an-
ouncement of the real purpose
behind the registration of
Gamma Sterilisation Pty., Ltd.,
as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Minster, Ltd. (B* 4/3/’59),
came from Sir John Cock-
croft, of the Harwell (U.K.)
atomic - energy research estab-
lishment, now visiting Aus-
tralia.
Sir John said his organisa-
tion had been working for
some years with Westminster
Carpets Pty. (Minsters’ chief
operating subsidiary) to steri-
lise goat-hair against anthrax
through the medium of radia-
tion. The experiments - have
beeen successful, and a high-
power radio cobalt source was
to be supplied for this purpose.
It would be the first large-
scale industrial application of
radiation.
At present imported goat-
hair has to be fumigated under
quarantine regulations in order
to prevent the entry of anthrax
into Australia, and fumigation
is slow, costly, and necessitates
the carrying of .larger stocks
because of delays in fumiga-
tion.
Experiments are being
carried out to determine the
practicability of preserving
foodstuffs by radiation in
order to ship them long dis-
tances without chilling or
freezing.
Oil Search in Queensland
the last few weeks
there has been an in-
creased activity in the search
for oil in Queensland. Inter-

the drilling of a stratigraphic
well has begun on Wreck
Island, off Gladstone.
The well is being drilled by
Mines Administration Pty.,
Ltd., on behalf of Humber
Barrier Reef Oils Pty., Ltd.,
in which Interstate Oil has
a 5 p.c. interest. Humber
Barrier Reef Oils has a large
prospecting-area off the coast
between Gladstone and
Cairns, and also between
Princess Charlotte Bay and
Thursday Island.
A seismic team from the
Bureau of Mineral Resources
is expected to start work this

Cockburn Cement (W.A.)
A t the annual meeting of
Rugby Portland Cement,
Ltd., to be held in London on
May 29, chairman Sir Halford
Reddish proposes to tell share-
holders the following concern-
ing their investment in
W.A.:— \
In Western Australia our sub-
sidiary company, Cockburn Cement
Pty., Ltd., has had an interesting
year. I told you last year of the
agreement between the Cockburn
company and its competitor in
Western Australia which, primarily
in the interests, of the State, was
designed first to avoid an increase
in the price of cement, and secondly
to keep the other company alive in
order to obviate the necessity of
costly imports. This agreement was
attacked under subsequent legisla-
tion on the grounds that it con-
stituted a monopoly; but was fully
upheld by the court, whose judgment
amounted to complete approval of
its intention and effect.
One very interesting feature of
the case was this: although our
subsidiary controls the distribution
of all the cement made in Western
Australia, the court held that it
was not a monopoly in the usually
accepted sense of the term—that it
could not impose an artifically high
price on the consumer. The court
accepted the fact that although
cement as such has no direct com-
petitor, it is nevertheless subject
to substantial price-competition
from many quarters. This is so
because cement is never used alone
but only in conjunction with other
materials to form concrete, and
concrete is in active competition
with a variety of other materials for
a variety of uses.

Industrial development in Western
Australia has been understandably
retarded for some years by the
policies of the State’s Labor Govern-
ment. In the State election of
March, 1959, this Government was
defeated. There is thus every
hope that Western Australia will
now enjoy a more soundly based
economy and a more competent
administration and will once more
attract the capital which it needs.
1 retain my confidence that it is a
State with a most promising future.
H.-p. Forum and' Aginum
CHnce it was simply a forum,
it was not to be expected
that the Economic Society dis-
cussion in Melbourne on hire-
purchase would produce any
more than enlightening facts
and opinions, but one overall
significant fact did emerge.
There were three chief
speakers: Vernon H. Stanley-
Low, managing-director of
General Credits, to put the
business view; Dr. Cairns,
M.H.R., to put the critics’;
Professor Peter Karmel, the
Melburnian who is now Pro-
fessor of Law in Adelaide ; and
about 33 others.
It was obvious there was
unanimity that hire-purchase
was generally a good influence
in the community, that it was
permanent, and that it would
expand. None of the speakers
condemned it- roundly or
expected it to subside. (The
day after the economists had
packed their satchels and
departed, hire-purchase shares
rose and continued to rise for
some days.)
Stanley-Low’s address was
so heavily documented, so per-
suasively expressed and so
comprehensive in its range over
the Australian economy—it
was entitled “The Philosophy
of Hire-purchase,” and ran to
more than 55 quarto sheets—it
seemed likely that a team of
public - relations boys had
moved in to assist the busy
managing-director, and, if so,
to have turned out between
them an expert and pretty con-
vincing job.
Dr. Cairns’s contribution
was stately, didactic and quite
hopeless, leaning frequently on
quotations from Dr. Coombs,
and in contrast with the slap-
up job done by Stanley-Low,
contained such shattering
phrases as: “Hire-purchase is
a legal device by which a user
of goods obtains physical
possessions before he pays or
obtains a legal title,” “Hire-
purchase is much more than
an aspect of the response be-
tween subjective desire and
objective income and dispro-
portions between them,” and
similar stuff.
Professor Karmel suggested
that the central bank should
control hire-purchase so that
its expansion would be
orderly, but he was not able
to expand this suggestion into
any tentative plan for putting
it into practice, rather nettling
the members. It made his con-
tribution ideal rather than real.
The members themselves, how-
ever, couldn’t take the sugges-
tion any further.
The professor may be under-
estimating the head of the
central bank, Dr. Coombs. Dr.
Cairns, in his address, asserted
the banking - system could
create new money, and quoted
Dr. Coombs in The Develop-
“This one, Lil ?”
merit of Monetary Policy in
Australia: “. . . When money
is lent by a bank it passes
into the hands of the person
who borrows it without any-
body having less.”
As at January 3.1, 1959, the
balance outsatnding in the
Commonwealth on hire-pur-
chase was / £340 million. Can
Dr. Coombs create that, with-
out any body else having less?
Problems of the Wool
Industry
[From F. Eric Hitchens,
Cranbrook, W.A.J
The problems of the wool
industry (B. 11/3/ ’59) will
not be solved by anything con-
tained in the report submitted
by the Australian Wool-
growers’ Council and now
being circulated in booklet
form.
The report is notable in two
respects. Firstly in the atten-
tion focused on the marketing
processes which occur after the
growers have sold their wool,
and which are consequently
completely beyond their
control. Secondly in the
summary rejection, in a few
brief sentences, of any sug-
gestion that improved selling
conditions should be arranged
whilst the wool is still the
grower’s property.
The Woolgrowers’ Council
has previously conducted at
least two exhaustive inquiries
into marketing, which were
presented as the last word on
the subject at that time.
The basic problem has not
changed. The weaknesses of
the auction system, fairly
obvious then, have merely
become more apparent, but the
conclusions resulting from
those investigations are now
being ignored.
The inquiry of 1942 occu-
pied a committee for twelve
months, and the result of its
deliberations were “that it
would be impracticable and
undesirable to return to the
pre-war auction method for
a period when hostilities
ceased.”
Events proved that conclu-
sion entirely wrong. Auctions
were resumed, and by means of
a reserve-price to support the
auction system, the industry
enjoyed five years of price-
stability and prosperity.
A similar committee was
appointed in 1947, which spent
eighteen months considering
what should be done when
Joint Organisation ended. Six
months later the committee’s
recommendations were en-
dorsed, it was stated, “by an
overwhelming majority of the
Australian Woolgrowers’
Council, and the Graziers’
Federal Council membership.”
That was their Post- J. O. Plan
—identical in policy and sub-
stance with the final plan
agreed to by the four partner-
countries, .and submitted to the
Australian growers by ballot in
1951.
However, the council had by
that time surrendered to the
strong tide of trade opposition,
and, by a neat feat of acro-
batics, were actively persuad-
ing their deluded followers that
the plan was designed to bring
about Government control.
The majority were so per-
suaded. They were also
assured (on the authority of
trade experts ) that in the brave
new world now at hand re-
current wool slumps would
have no place.
Those afflicted with short
memories would do well to
recall these circumstances, and
particularly in relation to the
fact that the Post-J. O. report,
which devoted 42 paragraphs
recommending the adoption of
a reserve price, was com-
pletely ignored as a basis of
present consideration. This
despite the fact that it was
for some time the council’s
accepted policy; that its
membership had subscribed the
capital necessary to finance
Post-J.0.; and that the plan
which Australia rejected is
operating in both New Zea-
land and South Africa, and
■only needs the participation of
Australia to make it fully
effective.
In contrast to this practical
solution, the various bodies are
to engage in an aimless inquiry
into a variety of nebulous
problems which those directly
concerned are much better
qualified to solve.
It is quite understandable
that the section of the Wool-
grower’s Council responsible
for the Post-J.O. defeat would
wish to dispose of any similar
proposal as quickly as possible.
It needs high moral courage
to admit mistakes, and the
responsibility for the mistake
of 1951 is indeed heavy.

“The Bastard Country”
Now in its premiere season
at Sydney Elizabethan, J.
Anthony Coburn’s first play
rocks you with its bursts of
violence, strings you up on its
skilfully drawn line of sus-
pense, and warms you with
some of its contrasting scenes
of domestic comedy; but
hardly any of it goes home
with you.
In other words, it is fine
theatre but not fine drama. In
other words again, though
most of its people and many
of its scenes are real enough,
the central conflict as pro-
jected has little bearing on any
problem in the living world.
The trouble seems to be that
the author’s theatrical exuber-
ance has caused him to strain
one's credibility too often.
The Greek protagonist
arrives at a lonely Victorian
farm determined to revenge the
death of his wife, whom the
farmer raped and murdered in
Greece during the war. But
for some vague reason he
neither kills nor denounces
the farmer, but forces him
to hand-over his daughter
in marriage, together with a
share in the property.
The farmer has been taking
his guilt out on his family for
years. His two sons have
turned into very angry young
men who would rather kill the
Greek than see him marry their
sister ; but after a very effec-
tive scene is made out of their
murderous temper they sud-
denly snap out of it, the only
apparent reason being that the
author has now decided to
show how the Greek can bring,
instead of death, a deep
humanity into this tortured
family.
The farmer has so far re-
frained from killing the Greek
because the Greek has a
cousin in Melbourne who will
“worry” if he doesn’t get a
weekly letter; but after the
'wedding, now that the Greek
“has something to live for,”
the farmer suddenly changes
his mind—or, rather, loses it.
Here the author seems sud-
denly to have tired of the con-
ventional suspense play he was
doing and decided to pump it
up into a violent morality. The
farmer, hotly pursued by his
sins, kicks one of his son’s
ribs in, tries to burn his
daughter to death, lays a trap
to shoot the Greek and
threatens to destroy the whole
“ He's ashamed because they
didn't renew his TV-contract.”
family. By the time he is
tricked and stabbed to death
by the Greek he has flown out
of range of one’s sympathy,
taking the play with him.
His • insane malevolence
might carry one along if
through it something striking
were said about its underlying
evil. As it is, it seems to be
used merely for a forceful end-
ing.
Frank Waters, as the farmer,
had the unenviable task of
sustaining this mood of savage
madness through one whole
act, and he did it creditably. He
appears, however, to rely more
and more on his stock of
sneers, grimaces, barks of
mirthless laughter and tense
starings at walls, which, though
fair enough most of the time,
are too mechanical to help this
role into full credibility. He be-
comes too predictable: when-
ever he goes into that half-
crouch, like the start of a
Rugby tackle, you know he’s
going to start yelling.
Patricia Conolly, as the
daughter fighting for love
against the blasts of her
father’s guilty hatred, acted
with beautiful balance and
timing—a performance that
carried a warm and pulsing life
through all the play’s cross-
currents.
Grant Taylor, too, brought
much humanity into his play-
ing of the Greek. If the motives
of the part had been better
stated this might have been a
memorable effort.
There was an earthy, raddled
appeal about Neva Carr Glyn’s
version of the farmer’s ex-bar-
maid mistress; and Rodney
Milgate and Neil Fitzpatrick
made the sons into convincing
portraits of careless affection
and offhand cruelty.
Frank Hinder’s set-designs—
notably that of the farm living-
room —strikingly mixed realism
and impressionism into stark
suggestions of the whole farm
atmosphere.
❖ ♦> ♦>
Pekarek and Souzay
Rudolf Pekarek had a nicely
balanced programme for a Bris-
bane concert that also intro-
duced the French baritone
Gerard Souzay. The bright
“Donna Diana” Overture by
Reznicek, full of intricate
twists and turns of rhythm, was
well under control as an opener.
Then, as a novelty, came some
Hungarian Sketches by Bartok.
These were having their first
public performance in Aus-
tralia, and turned out to be
Bartok’s own orchestration of
some early piano-music. They
were written long before the
severer Bartok music of the
’twenties and ’thirties, and their
earthy melodiousness points to
other little gems worth digging
out of the same ground.
This programme had two
symphonies, ages apart in
style but linked by an exuberant
youthfulness of spirit. Chaus-
son’s only symphony gives the
conductor some tricky
moments making solo instru-
ments heard through the thick
orchestral sound to be found
in some parts of the score. It
began a little tentatively, as
though the players were getting
the measure of the hall they
played in. They warmed to it
quickly, and lavishly produced
the atmospheric freshness of
sound that marks this fine
music.
Pekarek also played Beet-
hoven’s Second Symphony,
another piece with moments of
calm, this time shot through
with the impatience of the new
and vital composer Beethoven
was when he wrote it. It has
some technical snags, especially
for horns, but most of these
were negotiated without any
loss of liveliness.
After the French Symphony,
it was a bit disconcerting to
find that the leading French
baritone of the day had been
imported to sing solely in
Italian! Gerard Souzay sang
most movingly {he two great
arias of Orpheus from Gluck’s
opera. Then he sang two
Mozart arias. First he was a
puckish Leporello, ticking-off
the list of his master’s love-
affairs in the Catalogue Aria
from “Don Giovanni”; then
he switched to the part of the
Don himself. The Champagne
Aria was highly aristocratic,
but the swagger was not ; n
his voice because the part did
not really suit him.
Souzay is too rare a singer to
waste on the rather scrappy

Silvestri and Kennedy
Constantin Silvestri, the
visiting Rumanian conductor,
opened his first Sydney concert
with Beethoven’s giant
“Eroica” Symphony. Right
from the two crashing chords
which announced it he drove
the first movement along with
great exuberance. His stepped-
up tempo, however, prouuced
no traces of obscurity or dis-
tortion.
In the great Funeral March
he made no attempt to replace
the horse-drawn hearse with a
motor-powered one, and the
movement emerged as a
threnody of power and dignity.
The mysterious opening of
the scherzo was well conveyed ;
but in the fugato, and in the
tossing of the theme from one
section to another, one missed
some of the cosmic laughter
that should infuse this move-
ment. The final allegro, taken
at a pace to match the opening,
gained from the snap and tang
of the rhythmic treatment. In
all, a highly attractive reading
by a conductor who can mix
strength with sensitivity.
John Kennedy was soloist in
Bloch’s Hebrew rhapsody,
“Schelomo.” His ’cello was
at its best in passages calling
for deep emotion in the lower
registers ; but as often as not
the major role in this work is
taken by the orchestra, in
music which is at times almost
savagely passionate and always
suffused with Oriental tone-
colors as gorgeous as anything
by Rimsky-Korsakov or Boro-
din. Blend and balance
between strings and woodwinds
were as fine here as in any-
thing heard this season.
The other purely orchestral
work, Britten’s “Variations and
Fugue on a Theme by Purcell,”
was the least satisfying item.
As with so much other music
of its kind (its sub-title is
“Young Person’s Guide to the
Orchestra”), when the coloring
of novelty is washed out of it
the fabric is revealed as rather
thin. True, Britten is a clever
orchestrator, and in the final
phases his fugal treatment is
ingenious; but the variations
are too uneven in quality.
Except for the staccato mar-
tiality of the brass and the
mellowness of the clarinets and
oboes, the orchestra generally
seemed to suffer a let-down
after its fine showing in the
Bloch.
“The Heiress”

R. and A. Goetz the Pocket
Playhouse company (Sydney)

whole successful journey
through the urbane pathos of
Washington Square, Henry
James’s novel about a young
heiress of 19th-century New

an idealised memory of her
dead mother and unwittingly
causes her to be jilted by a
charming wastrel who, though
courting her only for her
inheritance, could have given
her a needed illusion of love.
Producer Robert Findlay
had obviously looked hard into
every corner of the play and
prepared his actors with
studious care. Beverley Harte,
as the heiress, acted with
exceptional insight and con-
tainment, moving the character
convincingly from agonised
shyness through flowering pas-
sion to final bitterness. Per-
haps, though, her resolution in
the last scene would seem
more deadly if made a little
quieter and tighter-lipped.
Donald Smith might have
done better to show an occa-
sional glint of steeliness
through the conventionally
ingratiating surface he gave to
the young wastrel.
John Cooper and Ellen
Bland worked with poise and
understanding as, respectively,
the father and the match-
making aunt.

“Dead Centre”
The opening number in
“Dead Centre,” the 1959
Sydney Uni. revue, was a
bottler. Everyone was sitting
there in the Union Hall won-
dering when the show would
begin. Suddenly, from the
audience, a quartet (two girls,
two boys) moved down to the
stage singing, in wonderful
four-part harmony, “It’s Five
Past Eight.” One doesn’t like
to split hairs, but it was ten-
past on this particular night.
Richard Leßoy’s music, how-
ever —a sort of unacknow-
ledged tribute to Morley—
easily made-up for that.
Good revue is topical revue,
and the students revelled in
jibes at radio - personalities,
evangelists and a big - name
daily - paper detective. Less
topical, but just as acidly
spicy, was the number where
the North Shore boy gets
sick of yachting - jackets and
fast cars, breaks all his golf-
clubs—and then sees the error
of his ways.
Unlike some previous re-
vues, where the accent has
been almost exclusively on
sex, this was a funny and well-
organised show, with none of
those unfortunate breaks be-
tween acts.

The Students Again
Continuing the high stan-
dard of play-selection set this
year by Sydney University’s
drama - groups, the St.
Andrew’s College Drama
Society last week put on “The
Insect World,” Karel and Josef
Capek’s wise and funny satire
in which the folly, cruelty,
bravery and beauty of man-
kind are seen in the social
behavior of butterflies, beetles,
crickets, ants and moths.
The play is as fresh today
as when it was written (1921).
Indeed, parts of it —the ant-
satire on totalitarianism, for
example, and the beetle-satire
on blind acquisitiveness—
seem actually to have gained
in meaning.
Kenneth Horler’s produc-
tion, though intellectually
keen and showing a clever
use of small resources, drove
the play along too hard. It
needs a dreamier touch and
a more careful measuring of
contrasts between scenes.
Similar faults and qualities
could be found in Horler’s

Sydney Art
New Sydney shows for the
week are a loan-collection at
the Museum of Modern Art
(217 a George Street); Roger
Hallett —a young English
artist—at the Macquarie ; and,
opening today (Wednesday) at
Farmer’s, Bob Dickerson.
Loaned by Mr. and Mrs. G.
E. Rodan, the Museum of
Modern Art collection is of
modish, rather slight pieces by
Cedric Flower, Nolan, Feur-
ring, Kmit and others. A
Harbor landscape in soft
browns by Lloyd Rees, look-
ing more like the first lay-in
for an oil than his finished
pieces, is a more substantial
piece of work, as are the draw-
ings and oils by Donald Friend
and one of Gleeson’s ingenious
triptychs that look at you with
so many eyes.
Roger Hallett is a painter of
buildings and rooftops which
he has pursued all over the
world from King’s Cross to
Switzerland and which he ob-
serves .at odd angles to make
chunks of deep and pleasing
color. They are attractive
patterns; sometimes, as in
“Hastings,” with surprising
depth and luminosity ; but the
artist may have more to say
when he gets down from the
rooftops and a bit closer to life.

Social Realists
Peter Miller and Raymond
Jones, showing at the Tas-
manian Tourist Bureau galleries
in Melbourne, apparently be-
long to the social-realist school
of painters. A social-realist is,
by current definition, one
whose chosen subject-matter is
the socially' oppressed and
injured ; but, as Shaw pointed
out, the rich man is just as
tyrannised over by his pleni-
tude as the poor man is by his
dearth: if he has no spiritual
use for his money he might just
as well not have it.
However, if social-realists
are those who paint the op-
pressed and injured, Rem-
brandt would have to come
under the definition, inasmuch
as he painted poor Jews and
beggars as often as he painted
fat bourgeois Dutchmen and
their girl-friends; he painted
the one class no better and no
worse than he did the other,
and he brought the same ob-
jective stare to bear even on
his self-portraits. He didn’t
allow any sympathy he may
have felt for his subjects to
stand between him and his
artistic judgment.
Aesthetically, we can only
judge Miller and Jones in the
same way. Their suburbanites,
down-and-outs and workers
struggling in and out of rail-
way-stations or marching in
processions and being hustled
by policemen are painted with
an illustrative gusto which does
their authors’ feelings credit,
but artistically don’t stand as
high as their landscapes.

Obehme Group
The most interesting exhibit
in the show of the Obehme
Group at the Athenaeum Gal-
lery, Melbourne, is the por-
trait of Jack O’Hagan, by
Stanley Ballard. It is not
superbly painted, but it is a
good souvenir of Australia’s
leading syncopater who has
syncopated more melodies of
the great composers—some of
them more than once—than
all the rest of our musicians
put together.
“Windsor, N.S.W.” is a
gentle souvenir of that cele-
brated town by the same
artist. In “Scudding Clouds
and Shadows, Pt. Leo” and
“Calm Waters, Stony Point,”
Laurence Kermond has caught
beauty by the tail and pulled
out a few feathers.

“Stage-Struck”
A backstage drama which
has the rare merit of both cap-
turing the spirit of the theatre
and presenting its people
directors, producers and actors
—in living terms. The slight
plot—about a triangular love-
contest between a cynical pro-
ducer, a playwright-director
young enough still to have
some illusions, and a stage-
struck girl who climbs to suc-
cess —is more than offset by
the work of such gifted actors
as Henry Fonda, Herbert
Marshall, Christopher Plum-
mer, and an attractive and
talented newcomer, Susan
Strasberg.

“The Sheriff of Fractured
Jaw”
Plentiful fun sometimes boils
over into uproariousness when
Kenneth More, as the blase
son of an English gunsmith
family, tries his luck as a sales-
man in the Wild West, becomes
a hero by an act of crass
idiocy, gets a wholly un-
warranted reputation as a
gunslinger, and ends-up as the
town’s sheriff when by every
rule of the game he should be
inhabiting a six-by-two plot
in the bone-orchard. More is
at his best; and even Jayne
Mansfield, as a blowsy, Mae
Westish saloon-proprietor, has
a certain appeal.

“These Thousand Hills”
Likeable Don Murray gives
a first-rate performance in this
superior western about a young
ranch-hand who becomes a

live with the memory of how f

color-shots of great cattle-
movements, lashings of action
—including the most realistic
boots-an’-all bar-fight since
“Shane” —and characterisation
well above average.

Industrial Acceptance Holdings, Ltd.
A slip in the amount of finance pro-
vided by hire-purchase cos. in the
first two months of this year was, to a
large extent, an expected seasonal decline,
the total amount financed in January and
February exceeding by about £630,000
the figure for the same two months in
1958.
Nevertheless, it seems at this stage that
when March and April figures are
available they will confirm a flattening-
out, at a quite healthy level, in the
demand for h.-p. accommodation and a
narrowing of the margin between repay-
ments and lendings (when compared with
that of a year ago), a trend which could
continue until TV-sales gather
momentum in Brisbane and Adelaide.
Although the major h.-p. financiers
still have plenty of scope for profit-
making, reductions in hiring-charges,
higher operating-expenses, repossession-
losses and the imposition of stamp-duties
in N.S.W:, Victoria and Tasmania have
all helped to whittle-down profit-margins
over the past couple of years and, with
keen competition for new business, have
prompted several cos. to extend their
financing activities beyond the h.-p. field.
Even so, it was something of a surprise
to see Industrial Acceptance Holdings
claim a virtually unchanged net profit
last term after the wholly-owned
Industrial Acceptance Corp. had bumped-
up the volume of business handled by
approximately £lO million, to over £7O
million, and added close to £l2 million
to its h.-p. outstandings.
Biggest of the Australian vendors of
consumer-credit, I.A.H. operates in all
States, financing the hire-purchase of
motor-vehicles, farm-equipment, machin-
ery, furniture, domestic-appliances, etc.
Two insurance-offshoots, Ajax Insurance
Co. and Surrey Insurance Co., serve the
organisation and its h.-p. clients as well
as writing a substantial amount of fire-,
accident- and general-insurance business
with outside customers.
In search of new outlets, the parent
co. recently made a successful bid for the
£150,000 share-capital of the Union
Building Society, the third-largest build-
ing-society in Victoria. I.A.H. offered four
ss. ords. for every three 10s. ords. in
U. 8.5., plus a cash payment of 2s. a share.
I.A.H. has the A.N.Z. Bank as its
trading-bank partner, the bank coming in
with a relatively small share-interest
(14 p.c., compared with the more common
40 p.c.) in 1957.
Originally controlled by an American
concern, Industrial Acceptance Corp. nad
been in business on its own account for
almost 25 years when I.A.H. took-over as
a holding-co. in 1954, through what was
in effect, a three-for-two bonus-issue.
Since then share-issues in 1955 (one-for-
five) and 1958 (one-for-seven), both at a
50 p.c. premium, together with the issue
to the A.N.Z. (at an 80 p.c. premium)
have pushed ord. capital to £8,100,000
and share-premium reserve to £2,525,000,
a futher £1,000,000 of pref. capital carry-
ing a cumulative 6 p.c. Completion of the
U.B.S. deal will add another £lOO,OOO
to ord. capital and £200,000 to share-
premiums.
Outstandings, etc., rose by £ll.B million
to £59.6 million over the year to Decem-
ber 31 last, gross profit from trading
including £3,525,000 (up £269,000) of
earned insurance-premiums, growing at a
somewhat slower rate to reach £10.6
million (up £1.5 million). Investment
income slipped by £30,841 to £75,152.
Operating expenses (up £1.4 million at
£7.1 million) increased with the greater
volume of business and, further swollen
by stamp-duties, repossession-losses, etc.,
made-off with most of the added gross
profit. Higher provisions for depeciation
(£44,450, up £13,385) and tax (£1,358,437,
up £14,687) cleaned-up the remainder to
leave net profit £9089 lighter at
£2,195,429, of which £484,667 (up £86,323)
came from the insurance cos. The profit
was claimed after reckoning unearned
incqme at £7,357,382, or an adequate
12.3 p.c. of total outstandings, etc., stamp-
duties, as a first charge against h.-p. earn-
ings, reducing the ratio below the 12.9
p.c. provided in 1957:

Outstandings continued to increase in the
first quarter of the current term although
the volume of new h.-p. business is
reported to have been below that handled
in the corresponding period in 1958, the
reduction occuring in agreements relat-
ing to appliance and TV-sales.
The increase from 1 p.c. to 2 p.c. in
Victorian stamp-duty on h.-p. agreements,
effective from last December, will also be
felt in the current year and, despite the
rapid expansion of outstandings over the
last couple of terms, the board considers
a slip in h.-p. earnings “probable.”
Insurance profits, too, are expected to be
down, the insurance offshoots, which
balance in June, meeting heavier claims
out of a little-changed premium income
over the nine months to March 31 last.
Still, it would take a lot to jeopardise
the 16f p.c. div.-rate or the group’s over-
all prosperity and the sharemarket, with
one eye on the mounting pile of share-
premiums, is anything but apprehensive,
pricing the ss. ords. at 16s. 3d. (14s. 9d.
a year ago) to yield £5 2s. 7d. p.c. from
a 16y p.c. div.
Consolidated accounts at December 31
last show a net tangible backing of Bs. lOd.
for each ss. ord. issued at that date.
Buckingham’s, Ltd.
Zooming events cast their shadows before
them, and in the case of Bucking-
ham’s the shadow took the form of an
extra-heavy provision for instalment-
collections in the 1958 term ; the event,
a shock passing of the interim for 1959.
This was in sharp contrast to a reason-
ably satisfactory trend in profits over
the previous three years, following a
unique blaze of glory in 1955.
The trouble, while merely adumbrated
in chairman W. Buckingham’s half-yearly
report, was largely bound-up with TV-
sales and, most likely, with TV-
inventories. Reading between the lines,
it seems that in this field both credit-
and purchase-control have been too
optimistically administered, and that
losses attendant upon repossessions and
write-downs will most likely put some
gaps in next July’s profit-figure.
Sales overall had diminished only
slightly in relation to the corresponding
period of the previous year, states the
report.
This being the case, there is no reason
why Buckingham’s scrip should remain
sterile for very long ; but, of course, only
the final accounts will give a clear pointer
to the future. Jn the meantime, there
hasn’t been any panic selling, and the
ss. shares are discounted only moderately
at ss. 9d.
The year to June 30 last had shown
some favorable trends, which were, how-
ever, not without attendant dangers.
Total sales had increased by £775,613 to
£5,703,703, and sundry debtors by
£597,272 to £1,967,279, but most of the
increase related to credit-sales of house-
hold appliances under hire-purchase
agreements. Buckingham’s still carries on
the cash-order business which it pioneered
so many years ago, and, over and above
retail-sales, turnover from this quarter
amounted to £1,098,897.
Newly created was a £81,163 provision
for unearned income, the proportion of
rent-profit contained in the outstanding
h.-p. debt which is attributable to future
terms, and a special provision for collec-
tions was strengthened by £51,902 to
£159,074, the two items together totalling
£240,237 and representing a percentage
of 12.2 p.c. against total book-debts. In
the balance-sheet the provision for collec-
tions is treated as part of shareholders’
funds.
Net profit as disclosed by Buckingham’s
was £119,008 (up £7006) —but no figure
is given for taxation provision, and the
addition to the provision for collections
hasn’t been treated as an appropriation
of earnings in the published accounts,
although the Commissioner of Taxa-
tion would almost certainly have taken
a different view. Depreciation charged
was £56,002 as against £42,702 for the
previous year. Altogether, the general
picture is rather confusing, but it is
difficult to see Buckingham’s turning in
an actual loss for the current accounting
period.
The ordinary div.-rate, cut from 124 p.c.
to 111 p.c. in 1956, then to 10 p.c. in 1957,
was maintained unchanged at the latter
rate, which would be a little higher than
the average for the past 10 years. A
pref. dividend of £5938 left £113,070 for
the ords., but the return on a higher
average equity capital fell to 12.7 p.c.,
compared with 15.1 p.c. for the previous
year and 13.1, 20.8, 15.6, 10.5 p.c. back
to 1953:

There were two ordinary share-issues
during the year in part payment for the
recently acquired Hub, a Sydney retailer,
and the Wollongong premises, adding
£347,917 to share-capital which now
stands at £1,049,917. This was the first
capital movement for quite a few years ;
ord. shareholders received their last and
rather dubious benefits in the two years
1950 and 1951 when successive one-for-
four and two-for-seven issues carried
respective premiums of 50 p.c. and 40 p.c.
Buckingham's trades through 17 stores
of varying dimensions located in and
around Sydney, and in the two next-
largest N.S.W. centres, Newcastle and
Wollongong. The main store is, unfor-
tunately, located in Sydney’s once-busy
Oxford Street, which now tends to be
a backwater. Queensland interests, con-
sisting of Curzons of Brisbane and
Surfers’ Paradise, were sold during the
year to Weedmans, Ltd., a newly-floated
public company.

is that Buckingham’s has been
left undersupplied with work-
ing capital at a time when its
funds are flowing into more
rigid channels, and this also
will have been a prime factor
in the decision to pass the
interim. Outside borrowing
seems to be approaching its
limit and little in the way of
new funds can be expected
from this source.
To sum-up, Buckingham’s
has troubles, but there is no
reason why these should be un-
duly protracted, although it
should be borne in mind that
there are options to £351,000
of ord. capital floating about,
exercisable in 12 months’ time.
Even so, the ord. shares, each
backed by 9s. 9d. of net tan-
gibles, still have prospects and
could in addition be takeover
bait.
Moffat-Virtue, Ltd.
TTnable to regain the sales-
volume necessary for pro-
fitable operations, the Sydney-
registered Moffat-Virtue, Ltd.,
has cut its selling and admini-
strative expenses by over 58
p.c. since 1951. However, this
drastic reduction has, so far,
failed to bring overheads into
line with a dwindling turnover
—and, incidently, could even
raise queries as to the ade-
quacy of sales-promotion
another heavy fall in sales last
term leaving the co. with its
fifth, and biggest, loss in six
years.
A manufacturer and mer-
chant, catering, primarily for
needs of the primary-producer,
Moffat-Virtue turns-out milk-
ing machines, power-generat-
ing plant, shearing-gear, pump-
ing- and irrigation-equipment,
etc., in addition to handling a
variety of agency lines. The
co. can obviously blame the
vagaries of commodity markets
and the weather for many of
its troubles ; although the suc-
cession of losses suggests that
other factors beside these two
unpredictables' could share
responsibility for the poor
results of recent years.
Negotiations regarding a
“major project,” which would
make use of currently idle
plant-capacity, have been in
progress for some time and
efforts have also been made to
develop additional lines, to
overcome what the board
regards as “an over-investment
in real-estate and plant, under
today’s conditions.”
Brightest spot in an other-
wise sombre picture is the asso-
ciated J. A. Prestwich-Virtue
Pty., in which Moffat-Virtue
joined with J. A. Prestwich
Industries (U.K,) in 1957 to
manufacture the highly re-
garded J.A.P. range of air-
cooled engines. Moffat-Virtue
holds £67,500 of the younger
co.’s share-capital and last term
collected a maiden div. of
£3250.
Amounting to £276,799 and
including £25,000 in 8 p. c.
prefs., Moffat-Virtue’s own
share-capital carries the scars
of earlier difficulties, a £23,610
write-down in 1936 leaving the
ords. with a par value of
12s. 6d. The ord. div. was
passed on only one occasion
between 1936 and 1952, but
since then ord. shareholders
have had nothing more than a
meagre 2j p.c., in 1954. There
are no arrears of pref. divs.
On consolidating the figures
of the parent co. and its
Queensland subsidiary, which
last term converted a £1862
loss into a net profit of £53, the
group loss for the year to
December 31 last shows up at
£24,320, or £17,869 greater
than the 1957 deficit:

Sales in N.S.W., where the co.
has its own merchandising
organisation, fell by 19 p.c.
over the year, with a startling
50 p.c. drop being reported in
sales by inter-State agents. In
an attempt to stop the rot
expenses were cut by £16,778
(to £140,299) but, although
actual gross-profit margins
were said to be satisfactory,
the smaller sales brought in
only £112,729 of gross profit
as against £150,626 in 1957.
Unprofitable trading, in-
volving a steep decline in book-
debts (down £22,220 last
term), hasn't, as yet, done any
great damage to the financial
structure and while stocks, at
£411,258 (“cost or under”),
appear the weakest link,
accounting for 52 p.c. of all
assets, production limits have
prevented any stock build-
up:—

Improved wool prices could
help sales in the current term,
although it seems unlikely that
conditions will be any more
favorable than they were a few
years ago, and unless the board
is successful in current negoti-
ations concerning the manufac-
ture of various products for
overseas principals, the im-
mediate prospects appear
pretty bleak.
At December 31 last net
tangible cover for the 12s. 6d.
ords. was 20s. 9d. and while
bids for the scrip have risen
from the 3s. Id. paid last month
to 4s. 3d., the lure of cheap
assets could still attract a take-
over bid and provide material
for the keen speculator.

to be well within the group’s
earning-capacity, and although
last term’s profit, affected by
building-alterations as well as
by tighter trading conditions,
was the lowest since 1953, it
still represented a satisfactory
18.1 p.c. on ord. capital, after
allowing for pref. divs.
Trading through two sub-
sidiary cos., Kornblums distri-
butes imported and locally-
manufactured carpets, lino-
leums, soft-furnishing materials,
etc., from freehold warehouses
in Melbourne, Sydney and
Adelaide. Import-restrictions
have limited sales of some
popular lines, but the group's
dependence on overseas sup-
pliers has been greatly reduced
in recent years by the expan-
sion of the local carpet-
manufacturing industry and by
the activities of a third sub-
sidiary, Furnishing Textiles
Pty., which weaves furnishing-
fabrics at Melbourne.
To finance the purchase of a
five-story freehold in Mel-
bourne in the 1957-58 term,
the co. raised £IOO,OOO on
8 p.c., 10-year notes (giving
holders the right to participate
in share-issues) and borrowed
a further £IOO,OOO on mortgage.
Expenses relating to the
renovation and occupation of
these premises, together with
losses arising from a six-month
delay in filling the space avail-
able to tenants, trimmed-back
eanings last term and, coming
on top of a small decline in
turnover, helped to cut group

Written after providing £35,152
(down £7376) for tax and
£19,578 (up £6399) for depre-
ciation and plant-replacement,
the profit was £8979 short of
the previous term’s effort, but,
at £51,618, it was still sufficient
to cover a steady 10 p.c. on
the ords. and 7 p.c. on the
£40,000 pref. capital with
£21,818 to spare.
The smaller turnover,
described as “lower, although
not appreciably so,” was
accompanied by a sharp drop
in book-debts (down £34,539)
and creditors (down £41,208),
a big jump in book-debts and
a somewhat smaller increase in
creditors occurring in the
preceding term.
Expenditure on freeholds

ties, etc., falling by £96,372
to a comfortable-enough

The furnishing-trade can be
a tricky one, even without the
uncertainties of import-restric-
tions, but, in the case of the
70 - year - old Kornblums
organisation, the sharemarket
appears to have made adequate
allowance for this fact in
pricing the 10s. ords. at 13s.

being given now to determine
the extent of a rather promising
alluvial-tin area at Ruxton

few miles off the Burdekin
River, where another small
prospecting concession-area is
held. Between times, its parties
are scouring over wide areas of
the field.

From Herbert Holman
'T'HE National Savings move-
ment has had a wonderful
year, new savings accounting
for a net surplus of £270
million (against a deficit for
1957-8 of nearly £l6 million).
At the close of the financial
year the total of “small”
savings remaining invested was
a record, £6580 million (sterl-
ing).
Since this figure is confined
to savings-certificates, defence
bonds, premium bonds and
deposits with the post-office
and trustee banks, the grand
total of money put by when
contractual savings and private
investments are included must
be of great comfort to the
Chancellor and may well have
encouraged him in his risk-
taking. In fact, last year's
higher national savings mean
a gain to him of as much as
£3OO million, after adjusting
for interest and redemptions
and after allowing for a drain
of £123 million the previous
year.
Because, no doubt, of the
Government’s ability to make
its own terms, the best results
came from the saving-certificate
and the defence bond. In the
one instance, much to the con-
cern of the building-societies,
the yield is unnaturally high
and in the other, envied by
the unit-trusts, interest is paid
gross. That genteel com-
prormse between thrift and
gambling, the premium bond,
fared less well ; sales were
down by 9 per cent, and re-
payments up by 140 per cent.,
but nevertheless attracted £66
million of new money.
It is clear that, so long as
prices and money-values don’t
race in opposite directions,
very ’many people, financially
unsophisticated but living well
within their incomes, are keen
to invest their money. This is
true of the whole of western
Europe and is evidenced by the
growth of unit-trusts. At least
half-a-dozen have been
formed on the Continent this
year.
in Britain, two have made
block offers after the Budget,
with security ■ prices at their
peak. In one instance the offer
is the fifth since the trust was
formed in October, 1957. This
method has provoked some
criticism on the grounds that,
as units can be freely bought
and sold on the market, the
block offer is a gimmick. But
with some exceptions, includ-
ing the doyen of the movement,
the trusts are inclined to look
upon this orthodoxy as
academic. They find that the
concentrated campaign, by
advertisement and - circular,
usually is oversubscribed.
Here’s a How-de-do
The faithful half-million who
have signed a petition implor-
ing Parliament to extend the
copyright for W. S. Gilbert's
words are surely fighting a lost
cause. Since Sullivan’s music
is copyright-free, they can’t
prevent the Cha-Cha being
danced to his tunes, if Tin Pan
Alley chooses to borrow them.
They forget that, during the
pair's lifetime, people every-
where danced the Lancers to
these same tunes. This didn't
in any way affect attendances
at the operas.
And look what they’ve done
to Shakspeare with “Kiss Me
Kate’’ and “West Side Story”
(look, too, at what some pro-
ducers do to him!) Tschaikow-
sky survives “None But The
Lonely Heart,” and Borodin
“Kismet.”
On another plane, it can well
be argued that rigidity spells
death to art. The same work
with the same performers can,
and does, vary night by night ;
and the gramophone reveals
how dissimilar, yet irreproach-
able different interpretations of
“ You've had fifty hours dual-instruction, Misilworth,
and it's time you operated solo."
symphonies can be. Nor are
the reputed emendations of
Mozart or Beethoven neces-
sarily sacrosanct, for the copy-
ist may have been careless.
Let’s face it. Sullivan’s music
is often routine and was
grudgingly, if brilliantly, com-
posed. And Gilbert’s clever,
arch and grotesque type of
comedy has an appeal which
is less than universal,
The Gilsullivan tradition
has enough worth and gathered
impetus to last for many
decades, perhaps for ever, but
it is not inviolable. Posterity
will be the final arbiter. To
tidy-up the libretti, to re-
orchestrate some of the music
(especially those passages which
Sullivan farmed out) and to
produce with more flexibility
might even be doing the operas
a good turn.


In The Park
By
JUDITH WRIGHT
Vivi’s mother was taking
her to the park to see
the flowers and the
birds in cages. Vivi
had been to the park before ;
but it was a long way, right
to the other side of town in
the bus, and it was a long time
ago. She remembered the bus
but not the birds ; she remem-
bered the lake and that she
mustn’t get her feet wet.
Her mother put Vivi’s new
white sandals on for her and
tied a blue bow in her hair.
Outside the summer was shrill-
ing like the noise in the saw-
mill down the road ; the day
was so hot that Gran lay in
her cane long-chair and fanned
herself.
“Why you should want to
take the poor child to the
park on a day like this I can’t
see. That long hot ride in the
bus! But you get these
notions in your head and I
know very well it wouldn’t
matter what I said, 1 can’t talk
you out of it.”
“There’ll be a cool breeze
out there ; and she needs a
bit of a change now and then.
Our room isn’t all that nice
for a kiddy on a day like this,
with the sun coming straight
in like it does ; and you don’t
like her messing-up the rest
of the house. I’d rather not
see her playing in the street
with those little Gardners all
the time.”
Her mother called Gran
sometimes Gran and some-
times Mrs. Coleman. Today
she had been calling her Mrs.
Coleman; it was something
about the breakfast washing-
up. Those days their voices
made Vivi wince when they
spoke to one another, as
though she had eaten one of
the little green mangoes that
plumped on the grass in the
garden.
Gran closed up her mouth,
the little brown hairs around
it bright with tiny drops from
the heat; then she looked at
Vivi and smiled and tapped
her leg with the fan. “Any-
way, Vivi, you look nice in
those new shoes. Here’s three-
pence for lollies.”
Vivi sat on the bus seat,
her legs uncomfortable. She
couldn’t lean back unless her
legs stuck straight out in front
of her, and if she sat on the
edge of the seat she fell off
when the bus turned a corner.
She tried it, and slid sideways
and clutched at her mother.
Her mother brushed her hand
away with an annoyed sound.
“Stop it, can’t you? You’ll
crush my dress.”
Vivi looked humbly at the
dress; it was new with red
flowers. She looked at her
mother’s red hat that made
her face look like a stranger’s,
like a powdered flower in the
red light that shone through
the hat and seemed to make a
separate, colored world in
which her mother lived. Her
mother’s face was special like
that and strange, because of
the park, Vivi thought; be-
cause she hardly ever went to
the park and now she was
going. But the bus bounced
so much that Vivi had to hold
on with both hands to the
seat in front. She began to
think about her threepence,
lying in her mother’s handbag
across her knees.
Now there were trees, a
whole avenue of trees with
leaves like green feathers.
“This is the road to the park,”
her mother said; and she
took a mirror from her hand-
bag and powdered her face
again. Vivi craned to look
too, but her mother snapped
the mirror back into the case.
There was a turnstile ; there
was a little kiosk that sold
chewing-gum and soft drinks.
“Gran give me threepence,”
said Vivi, hanging back on
her mother’s hand.
“Oh, come on, Vivi.”
“Gran give me threepence
tb buy lollies.” Vivi’s voice
went high, the way it did when
she was ready to cry. Her
mother took her back to the
kiosk, walking quickly, and
Vivi bought some toffees.
“Now, will you come on?”
Her mother set off down a
long path with flowers on each
side, and Vivi followed, taking
the paper off a toffee.
There was a terrible cry, a
dry wooden shriek. Vivi stood
still with shock. A huge white
bird clung to the wires of a
cage beside the path ; he
lifted his yellow hair at her
and leaned against the wire
with one claw out.
“Mum, Mum!” cried Vivi.
“What is it?”
“Come back I’m
frightened.”
“Oh, don’t be silly, Vivi.
It’s only a cockatoo.”
T - nowing the bird’s name
made it sound quite dif-
ferent. “It’s only a cockatoo,”
Vivi repeated aloud, and the
bird shrank at once and be-
came nothing but a cockatoo.
She threw the toffee-paper
at it.
“Come on, Vivi.” Her
mother was far down the path.
Vivi ran and caught her
mother’s hand. It was cold ;
it swung hers to and fro,
jerkily. Vivi looked up sur-
prised.
There was a man walking


down the path towards them ;
Vivi had seen him before,
walking in town with her
mother, and they had stopped
to talk. He was Mr. Malley ;
but this time her mother’s
hand said he was important.
“Well, Vera. You did
come.”
“Thought the park might
be cool today. You came too.”
“I didn’t know I’d invited
both of you. Can’t we have
a talk by ourselves, for once?”
“What makes you think I
came to meet you, anyway?
I’m giving the kid an outing.
She’s my kid, isn’t she?”
And she shook Vivi’s arm.
“Say hullo to Mr. Malley.”
“Hullo,” said Vivi. But she
had remembered something
else about the park. “You’re
not my Da,” she said.
The man laughed, but it
sounded angry. “Not your
Da? Of course I’m not.
What’s the idea?”
Her mother shook her arm
again. “We came here once
before with Don. I s’pose she
remembered. That was the
last time he was here.”
“How long’s that?”
“Eighteen months.”
“It’s a wonder she remem-
bers him at all. You haven’t
heard of him?”
“He don’t write to his
mother, either. He’ll be back,
though.”
“This year, next year, eh?”
Mr. Malley bent down to
Vivi. “Here’s threepence. You
run off and get yourself some-
thing at the shop.”
But Vivi drew back. She
knew about taking money
from strange men. “My Gran
give me threepence. I’ve got
some lollies.”
And her mother swung her
hand again. “Vivi can stick
around. I want to keep an
eye on her. If you don’t like
having her about, there’s no
need to stay, see? I told you,
it wasn’t to meet you I came.”
“Okay, okay.” Mr. Malley
had a sideways smile. “You
came all off your own bat
and I never said a word.
Come on, now, be your age.
Let’s all sit down on a seat
somewhere and have a nice
family chat.”
“Well.” Her mother still
held her hand. “I s’pose we
can do that for a little while.
I promised her I’d show her
the birds.”
“Afterwards, afterwards.”
Mr. Malley moved them down
the path. There was a seat
under a palm-tree, and her
mother pulled Vivi down to
sit between the two of them.
The lake was down there,
but Vivi wanted to see the
birds. There was an emu,
Gran had said, and something
else. She peeled herself
another toffee and waited.
But they took no notice of
her, and her legs hanging
down from the seat grew rest-
less. She drummed her feet
against the bar under the
bench. Her mother shook her
shoulder again. “Don’t do
that, Vivi.”
She began to wriggle in dis-
comfort. No one looked at
her. She took out another
toffee and after awhile put it
on the man’s knee. He went
on talking.
“Look, mister,” she said.
“Look what I gave you.”
Mr. Malley picked it up,
still talking, and dropped it
into hrs pocket. He didn’t say,
“Thank you,” and she began
to regret the toffee. She sighed
and wriggled again.
A girl ran by with a hoop.
“Can I get down, Mum?
Mum, can I get down?”
“Oh, stop whining, Vivi.
Go and play, then.”
She slid down and spilt the
toffees out of the bag. There
were ants running about on
the bare ground in front of
the seat. She crouched down
to pick up the toffees.
“Mum! An ant bit me!”
“Oh, Vivienne! Give us a
bit of peace, can’t you? Here,
take the bag and run away.”
The ant-bite, which had not
really hurt her, began to sting.
Vivi put her finger in her
mouth to stop the tears. Red
in the face, she stamped her
foot once and moved away.
She stopped to look back after
a minute, but her mother
didn’t turn.
CJome grey birds flew over-
head and circled round
with a whirring noise before
they settled on the grass.
Were they the birds she had
come to see? Vivi stamped
at them, and they lifted into
the air and fell again.
She began to walk after
them, stalking them. Their
feathers shone in the sun with
changing colors as they
walked about, cooing. Their
round red eyes peered at her,
staring and remote, their
necks thrust to and fro like
Gran’s when she was in a
temper. Vivi would have liked
to catch one and pull out its
feathers; but they kept
moving farther away, and
when she stretched out her
hand they rose out of her
reach into the air.
Now a beetle scrambled
past her through the grass.
She followed it slowly and
dared at last to put out a
finger and touch it as it
climbed a grass-stem. It put
out four whizzing arms and
flew away.
She stood and listened.
There were strange noises up
the path—twitterings and cries
and squeaking sounds. She
could see more cages there,
like the one with the cockatoo.
She began to walk towards
them, stopping and stamping
down any stems of grass that
stood higher than the rest,
until they lay flat.
A little boy stood watching
her ; he had a white shirt and
a pink icecream-cone. He took
a lick from the cone and
stared over it.
Vivi began to sing loudly.
“Who's afraid of the big bad
wolf?” she sang; the little
Gardners had a gramophone
that sang that tune, and Vivi
had learned it. She swaggered,
stamping down the grass.
“That grass belongs to my
Daddy,” said the little boy;
“everything here belongs to
my Daddy. He's a policeman.”
“You go away,” said Vivi.
“Go away yourself,” said
.the boy.
Vivi kicked at the grass
again, and ran away. The
cages were quite near, and
people walked up and down
and stared into them ; but
to reach them she had to pass
a whole family of people who
had spread a rug beside the
path and were drinking colored
drinks from bottles and eating
potato-flakes from bags. There
were two girls bigger than
Helen Gardner, and a girl
smaller than Vivi, and two
grown-ups. A brown puppy
played round them.
Vivi stood still, not sure
whether to go on. She felt
as though she had come a
long way, and when she looked
back she couldn’t see the seat
where her mother was.
The puppy came running. It
pranced and crouched in front
of her and panted with its
tongue out. Vivi took a step
backwards, and the puppy fol-
lowed and licked her knee.
Vivi knew its name ; she had
heard one of the girls calling
it. 1
“Mickey,” she said, asserting
power over it with the name ;
but she backed further as the
puppy followed. Her heel
caught in the grass, and she
sat down. The puppy
scrambled over her legs and
licked her face; it seemed
warm and friendly. She patted
its ear and put her arm round
it; they rolled together in the
grass.
“Mickey!” one of the girls
called. “Mickey, come here.”
The puppy ran away, and the
three girls seized him and
rolled him about on the rung,
and fed him with potato-
flakes. Vivi stood watching
for awhile, her finger in her
mouth, but he didn’t come
back.
CTowly she went on towards
the bird-cages, making a
wide circle round the rug
where the puppy played. The
girls didn’t look at her.
The first cage was bright
with movement and gave out
a thin shrieking noise. Closer,
PRAYERS
O death be god to those that., live.
And life be good to those that died;
let them be unremembered,
let them go.
Jf it were free of flesh, the touch of love,
there’d be some truth the mind could know !
O death be kind,
and let the dead ones die within the mind
and all the living move as though untied.
But death’s a god beyond your love.
And life’s a good beyond your pain ;
let all be unremembered.
You must know
a faith beyond the fact by which you live,
This is the truth : it goes, they go.
O life be kind,
and let the living live outside the mind,
and all the dead remembered die again.

she saw a crowd of small birds
that darted up and down,
swung on swings, or clung to
the wires of the cage with feet
as thin as string. Vivi clung
to the wires too, opening and
shutting her mouth, licking the
iron cross-bars that tasted
cold and strange. The birds
made a criss-cross of colors
in the air, and she stayed there
for a long time.
At last she uncurled her
fingers and stepped back.
“Cockatoos,” she said, and
dragging her hand against the
wires she went on.
There were grey stones,
there was water running, a
pink-and-white bird shrieked
at her and she stamped at it.
People kept passing. She had
forgotten to look back for her
mother.
Now she was at the last cage
of all. Something stood there
quite close to the wires, tall
and grey on long thin legs.
Vivi drew back.
It was taller than she was.
Was it a bird, was it a person?
She spoke to it, but it didn’t
answer. “Cockatoo,” she said ;
but she knew it was not the
right word.
The bird or person made a
step towards her ; its face was
red, its eyes were large and
round. Vivi put her finger in
her mouth and looked back
at it.
It walked towards her and
stretched out a great grey arm.
Vivi jumped back, sucking her
finger. Then she took out
another toffee and held it
towards the red face.
A long black beak came
towards the wires and Vivi
dropped the toffee just inside
the cage. The beak picked it
up and dropped it and came
back toward the wires again.
Vivi had no word to master it.
Now the creature spread
out both arms with a frighten-
ing. sudden rush of feathers,
sending Vivi backwards again,
and curved its neck and lifted
its feet high, one after the
other. It stalked backwards
and forwards, it raised its thin
legs high in the air with those
great grey arms spread wide,
it peered at Vivi and stretched
its long neck towards her.
She watched it, breathing fast.
What was it doing? What
did it want? It stared and
bowed and beckoned, danced
and waved its arms. It wanted
something.
Vivi began obediently to
move her feet as it did, to
spread out her arms and bend
her head. The bird took a
little bobbing run to one side ;
so did Vivi. It turned its
back and ran to the other side
of the cage, turned again and
ran back, and Vivi met it at
the wires, balancing with both
her arms outstretched. She
had forgotten about words;
she was intent. She thought of
nothing except the movements.
When the bird bent, scraped
with its foot, jumped in the
air, so did she. Her arms were
grey and wide, her neck was
long, her head bobbed.
It shocked her suddenly to
hear, as she met the bird again
with outstretched arms, a
shout of laughter behind her.
The bird ran away and Vivi
turned. People were watching
and laughing. She put her
finger in her mouth and for
some reason began to cry.
Someone came pushing
through the crowd and caught
her hand. It was her mother.
“Oh, you bad girl! Run-
ning away like that! I thought
you were in the lake.” Her
mother wiped her eyes clean
with a handkerchief. “And
here you are making a show
of yourself. Look at that;
sticky toffee all over your face
and hands.” She dragged
Vivi down the path, and
scrubbed her with a wet
handkerchief at the drinking
fountain.
IVow they were going back
again up the path, toward
the waiting bus. Her mother’s
fingers hurt her hand ; and
something else was wrong too.
She had lost her bag ; there
was still a toffee in it.
“I had a toffee left,” she
sobbed. “I lost my bag.”
“Just as well, too. You’ve
had more than enough.”
“I give that man a toffee
and he never said thank you.
He took it and he didn’t
eat it.”
Her mother didn’t answer.
“You ask him to give it
back.”
Her mother halted and
pulled Vivi round to face her.
“You get this straight right
now, Vivi. We’re going home.
No more toffees, do you
hear?”
Vivi dropped her head. She
didn’t cry loudly, but her
breath came in gasps and half-
sobs. She scrambled up behind
her mother into the empty
bus.
Her mother went right to
the back, to the very last seat,
and put Vivi next to the
window and sat beside her.
Vivi was still sobbing silently.
She ached emptily ; she would
have liked to lie down on her
mother’s lap, but her mother
was angry with her.
The bus stood still and
empty for a time ; then her
mother moved and took hold
of her hand again. “Tired?
You can put your head down
if you want to.”
Vivi slipped down mutely
and gave a long sigh. The
tears began to dry on her face
in a stiff crust. Her mother
took off her bonnet. “You can
go to sleep if you like. I don’t
know what you wanted to run
away for.”
“I never,” Vivi said. Crying
had quietened her, her voice
nearly asleep. “Where’s the
man?” she said, half-rousing.
“Gone away,” her mother
answered. She spoke in the
same quiet voice, as though
it were bedtime, as though she
were tired.
“What for?”
“I told him to. I had to
look for you, see?”
“He never said thank you
and he took my toffee.”
“You forget about him.
He’s gone now.”
“Will he be here if we come
back again? Will he have my
toffee?”
“I told you, he’s gone. Now
shut up about him, see?”
“I’ll tell Gran he never said
thank you.”
“Don’t you tell Gran any-
thing about it, Vivi. You
just forget him. Gran don’t
want to know about him.”
Vivi slid further down into
her mother’s lap. “That big
thing,” she said. “Why did
it run about? What did it
want?”
“That was a bird. That was
the brolga. He was just
dancing. I reckon he thought
you were another brolga.”
“Brolga,” said Vivi. “I’ll
tell Gran I want that big
brolga.”
Her mother said nothing.
The bus was full, and now it
began to move off. She held
Vivi on her lap and put the
bonnet over her eyes to keep
the sun from her. Vivi went
to sleep.

It has to be confessed that
Lake Cadibarrawirracanna,
together with its formidable
companions, Lake Mirran-
pongapongunna and Warra-
lillialillialillia Spring, was
given a hearing not as a
matter of geographical value,
but for the benefit of those
readers who like to ponder
over nomenclatural fantasies.
That, too, was the chief
reason for the inclusion (to
cite a couple of milder
examples) of Croajingalong and
Come-by-Chance, though in
each of these instances the
names had additional interest
through having figured in popu-
lar verses.
I pause here to remark that
the discussion of Place
Names, being somewhat exten-
sive, involved us in consider-
able delving ; and so, too, did
the article on Bush Searches
(relating mainly to lost chil-
dren) and the detailed entry
entitled Trees, Historic. As to
this last, the original idea was
that only about a score of trees,
mainly those inscribed by
explorers, would need atten-
tion, but, after probing into
the general subject during inter-
vals of a couple of years, we
astonished ourselves by the
size (and interest) of the col-
lection made —it extends over
10 pages of print.
Yet another indigenous sub-
ject that got a bit out of hand,
-or at least revealed more
worth-while material than had
been anticipated, was Axeman-
ship. I had at the outset an
impression that this topic,
viewed mainly as a sport, could
be covered somewhat briefly,
but, as research proceeded,
much spirited material devel-
oped in regard to early con-
tests, and also concerning the
operations of Australian axe-
men in Britain during both
World Wars, and so the dis-
cussion expanded very con-
siderably.
In point of fact, quite a
deal of delving was also
occasioned by some of the
shorter items, and even then
certain queries had to be left
more-or-less unresolved. You
can, for example, decide for
yourself, on the evidence pre-
sented, whether Clancy and the
Snowy River bloke represent
actual persons, and, if so, who
they were —there’s no lack of
candidates in each case.
IVTOR was it easy to discover
the precise origins of such
terms as Never-Never, Jimmy
Woodser, Jackeroo, and
Pommy. “Duke” Tritton, I
notice, says that “Pommy”
was “yet to be coined” when
he was outback (about 1906),
but I have an impression that
it was slightly current before
then ; and I think, too, that it
was created casually, a mere
product of rhyming slang.
Reference to Tritton recalls
that in one of his chapters (B.
21/1/ ’59) he produced a vivid
description of the Darling
Shower. This term, although
somewhat local in application,
was another of the Australian-
isms on our list, but as it had
at least three opposite numbers
—the Cobar Shower, the Wil-
cannia Shower, and the
Bedourie Shower—the best
procedure seemed to be to run
the lot together under the head-
ing of Dust Showers.
Incidentally, one rarely sees
reference to the N. S. Wales
“showers” in contemporary
print, but the Queenslander
still gets a hearing, as, for
instance, when, following a
recent hot spell, the Hughen-
den correspondent * of the
“North Queensland Register”
wrote: “Tuesday broke with
our old friend the Bedourie,
and a haze of dust enveloped
the town and district.”
By and large, a good deal
of interest attached to the
assembling of all these frag-
ments of Australiana, and, now
that they’re reposing in print,
it’s refreshing to learn that
readers of the A.E. (while not,
one hopes, neglecting the more
“educative” entries) are also
enjoying themselves among the
“odd bits.”
Footnote: lan Mudie wrote
me recently to say that, in his
view, The Australian Encyclo-
pcedia should be placed on the

that it lures him into reading

have assured lan that we are
appreciative of his aid in

Faith in the
Future
The changing of poor land into good pasture
country by the addition of trace elements has
brought Australia higher hopes for its rise as a
populous nation.
The story is too well known for repetition, but
it is recalled now by an official announcement that
the ten-year plan for transforming 250.000 acres of
the Ninety Mile Desert in South Australia "has
been a complete success. Other conversion is
being undertaken.
So a new factor operates in our estimates of
ultimate population. How many that number
will be v only time will tell. But we should be
associating it strongly in our minds with the rise in
world population.
Last year it was my interesting experience to
visit Israel. As a modern entity, Israel is just over
ten years old. It is attracting population, as we
are. It has tracts of arid country in an area totally
small, but is doing an impressive job agriculturally,
largely through irrigation.
This is the relating point: If Queensland, New
South Wales and Victoria were populated at the
same density rate as Israel is today, they alone
would be supporting between them no fewer than
two hundred and sixty five million people!
The qualification is obvious. Such a consideration
is not governed solely by size. Population is
influenced by rainfall and water resources, and a
great part of this continent may always be sparse
in settlement.
But, discounting it as we may—keeping it
down to the well-watered regions of Australia if
we wish —we still get a very sizeable idea of what
soil means to us, and to an ever-increasing
population in the world.
And that brings us back to the importance of
turning every acre of good land to production;
of raising every poor acre into fertile condition.
In what they have done with trace elements,
our scientists and those who have backed them
have underlined the living truth for us: An
enormous area of Australia still awaits the touch
of inspired hands.
H. Hastings Deening


The Treasurer Gives an Interim Report
Moderately Fair
In budgeting last August for an overall
cash deficiency of £llO million, the
then Federal Treasurer, Sir Arthur
Fadden, said that although trade
conditions inside Australia were favor-
able, “externally they are much less so
and, for the present, show little sign of
improvement.”
Conditions in America, in Britain and
on the Continent gave no justification for
“counting upon any major rise in the
prices of our chief exports,” and, accord-
ingly, “we have to envisage another year
of comparatively low income.” Further,
although there had been a reasonably
good season, “it is not thought that the
wool-clip this year will be as large as
last year.”
That was a justifiably cautious
approach, particularly as the Treasurer
said that the reduced incomes of primary
producers, brought about by the fall in
prices in the previous year —wool and
grain exports in 1957-58 earned only
£453 million, compared with £6OB million
in 1956-57 —must have repercussions on
the internal economy because of the
reduced spending power of the men on the
land, unless it could be offset in other
directions. In view of this, said the
Treasurer, and of the growing needs of a
rising population, Government policy
would be to encourage a steady expansion
in order to promote a growth in spend-
ing, but not to such a degree as would
give rise to “excessive demands for goods
and resources, and, in particular, for
imported goods.”
VI/fTH less than two months left of the
* financial year, it seems certain that
the national books will show a much
better result than the Treasurer antici-
pated. The Treasury Information
Bulletin No. 14, which covers the nine
months July-March, showed a deficit on
Consolidated Revenue Account of £lll
million, and the combined transactions of
Consolidated Revenue Account and Loan
Account showed an overall cash deficit of
£117.7 million. As revenue for the last
quarter of the financial year is always
substantially higher than expenditure,
owing to the large volume of income-tax
money gathered-in during May and June,
the final result cannot fail to be better
than the £llO-million deficit forecast in
the Budget, after allowing for the expected
drop in income-tax revenue.
At the end of March, 1958, the overall
cash deficiency was £106.8 million, yet
the final result for the year was a surplus
of £10.3 million.
The Consolidated Revenue Fund figures
for the month of April, released last week,
showed further improvement. April
revenue was £lB6 million (with all items
•
keeping well up to Budget estimates) and
expenditure just over £lOO million. Apart
from income-tax, almost every form of
revenue for the first 10 months of this
financial year was higher than for the
corresponding period of the previous
year, but the main explanation for the
improved outlook is the recovery of the
loan-market.
T ast year the total loan-raisings were
- L ' £ll5 million, and a similar figure was
assumed to be the most that could be
expected this year. At the end of April
actual raisings had already outstripped
that figure by nearly £45 million. New
loan-money raised by that date totalled
£159.9 million, of which £128.9 million
had been raised locally and £3l million
overseas. “Unusually large subscriptions

and dealers associated with the new short-
term money-market” were a part-
explanation of the improved climate of
the loan-market. To the April figure
must be added the amount subscribed
to the £35-million loan launched last
week.
A final indicator of the healthy state
of the national till was that the Treasury-
bills balance was reduced by £76 million
during April to a balance of £163 million,
which was actually £5 million lower than
the amount outstanding at the end of
April, 1958.
Since the Treasury Information Bulletin
was published there has been a remark-
able recovery in wool prices, and although
this will have little or no effect on the
accounts for this financial year, it should
put Treasurer Holt in a more optimistic
frame of mind at Budget-time than his
predecessor was able to summon last year.
Fadden’s forecast of the volume of the
wool-clip has been shown to be pessi-
mistic ; the clip is now expected to exceed
last year’s, and, in fact, all previous years
except the record 1956-57 clip.
TThe improved prospects for wool is only
one item encouraging a brighter out-
look for the coming financial year. The
Treasury Bulletin reveals several more.
Exports listed for the eight months July
to February show that although there
was a decline of £B7 million in the value
of wool and sheepskins exported, most
other items more than held their own.
Exports of sugar, lead and zinc were
lower; meat, barley, oats, petroleum-
products and iron and steel up; wheat,
dairy- ( products and motor - vehicles
stationary.
On the home front new money raised
from the investing public by companies
listed on the Stock Exchanges for the
six months July to September totalled
£106.4 million, compared with £57.8
million for the same period in 1957.
Listed companies borrowed against
debentures and registered notes £82.6 mil-
lion, more than twice the comparable
figure (£39.5 million) for 1957. Savings-
bank deposits rose by £52.6 million in the
nine months to March, 1959, an improve-
ment of £12.8 million on the correspond-
ing period for the previous year. Hire-
purchase spending continued at a high
level, the balances outstanding at the
end of January, 1959, being £340 million,
which was £7O million higher than a
year earlier. Of this figure £154 million
represented new agreements contracted
during the first seven months of the year
—an increase of £22.1 million on the
same period in 1957-58. As a corollary
to this, the production of most
“consumer-durables” was higher than in
the previous year —refrigerators by 16.2
per cent.; washing-machines by 10.3 per
cent.; vacuum-cleaners 1.9 per cent.;
radios 18.9 per cent., and TV-sets 25.5
per cent. Registrations of motor - cars
increased by nine per cent.
'T'he population of Australia is estimated
to have passed the 10-million mark
some time in March. During the six
months to December 31, 1958, the esti-
mated increase was 105,478, of which
natural increase accounted for 67,724 and
net migration 37,754. The percentage
increase was 2.1. Civilian employment
rose by 31,800 in the 12 months to
February, 1959, the biggest increases
occurring in education (7800), health
(4900), property and finance (4700), and
building (4000). Mining and quarrying
was the only industry to record a decline
in employment, reflecting the effects of
mechanisation on the N. S. Wales coal-
fields.
Directly tied to the increased work-
force in the building industry was a rise
in the number of houses and flats com-
pleted—42,9l6 in the last six months of
1958; 35,873 in the last six months of
1957. There were corresponding improve-
ments in the production of bricks,
cement, roofing-tiles and most building
materials and prime-cost items.
This rise in production fulfilled Sir
Arthur Fadden’s expressed hope of a
moderate expansion, “but not to such a
degree as would give rise to excessive
demands for goods and resources, and,
in particular, for imported goods.” In
the nine months July to March the retail-
price-index rose by only 1.7 per cent., and
imports were slightly lower than in the
previous year.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Horses
This page last week, com
menting on the Warwick Farm
Welter Handicap, said that New
Zealander Comte De Paris was
“the best thing beaten,” and
added that he could quickly
make amends. The colt did
so at Randwick on Saturday,
when, backed from 3 to 1 to
9 to 4 favoritism, he brilliantly
won Tattersall’s James Barnes
Plate (H mile). The three-year-
old, trained by H. N. Wiggins,
had not previously raced at the
distance, though he had won
at a mile at Randwick last
October. Apprentice Keith
Smith (reducing the colt’s
weight by 31b.-allowance to
7.5) kept him close to,the lead
all the way, and in a tight
finish scored by half-a-neek
from Hurry By, with Flash
Gem a close third. Turkestan,
who had finished second at his
three previous starts, faded-out
after being with the lead until
the closing stages ; maybe the
handicappers have rather more
than the measure of the last
Epsom winner.
Though Gold Nib (imp.) won
in England at 1| mile, few of
his progeny—and he has sired
many winners—have been suc-
cessful over a bit of distance.
The Unicorn won the New
Zealand Derby and Sir William
was twice successful at 11
mile in Melbourne and also
finished third in the Melbourne
Cup, but most of the Gold
Nibs have been sprinters.
Comte De Paris is another of
the exceptions. His dam,
Sunny’s Last, is by Orelio from
Sunny Song by Hunting Song
(imp.). Sunny’s Last is a half-
sister to Duvach, dam of Mel-
bourne Cup winner Hiraji.
Apart from smart trackwork
at Randwick, Prince Verdi had
nothing to recommend him for
the Two-year-old Handicap for
colts and geldings, but he won
impressively from hot favorite
Morning Star, who evidently
found the dead going against
him with 8.12. Sands, third,
could win in Maiden company.
Prince Verdi had competed
three times previously, hadn’t
been closer than sixth, and
hadn’t started at less than 200
to 1. However, he must have
shown connections something
special: after opening at 7to 1
he firmed to second-favoritism
at 7 to 2. Jack Haigh, trainer
of the gelding, is racing him
in partnership with S. and F.
Cutrupi. Prince Verdi is by
Rigoletto (imp.) from Marrak
by Marconigram (imp.) from
Otrak by Woorak from Otford
by Tressady (imp.). Marrak
has thrown a number of
winners. Otrak was a half-
sister to Manfred.
Sea King’s three-year-old
brother, Caybros, won his
second race in four starts when
he narrowly defeated the
favorite, Native Land, in Tat-
“Throw it back, Col, it's too big for a savory-biscuit ."
tersall’s 10-furlongs Novice.
Caybros has the background of
a stayer, being by Ruthless
(imp.), a Hyperion sire, and
from Balgowlah by Buland-
shar (imp.), sire of High Caste.
Owner F. H. Edmonds
started Ardent Gene and
Johnno at Randwick, both
ridden by Mel Schumacher and
trained by Jack Green. Ardent
Gene narrowly defeated Per-
sian Cloud in the Three-and-
four-year-old Handicap, but
Johnno, solidly backed by the
stable, was slowly away in the
Welter Mile and did well to
finish fast in fourth place to
Torrid. It seemed he was
unlucky to have lost the race.
Ardent Gene is a four-year-old
mare, and intentions are to
retire her to the stud at the
end of the present season.
In four of his last five starts
New Zealander Torrid has
earned prizemoney—two wins
and twice third. Prior to the
Welter, Torrid had been
eligible for minor races, but
connections believe he will
prote a formidable rival for
middle-distance horses in the
new season, and ambitious
plans for the son of Mid-
day Sun (imp.) include a shot
at the Metropolitan, the Caul-
field Cup and the Melbourne
Cup. Meantime The four-year-
old will be spelled, most likely
in New Zealand. In his favor
is light racing. Mighty Missel
was backed from 13 to 2 to
3 to 1 favoritism, but he
couldn’t run out the mile,
though he made a brave show-
ing till the closing stages. It
was his third successive failure
at a mile, and maybe seven
furlongs would be more in his
line. Nearco Lad covered a
lot of extra ground, being
forced to race wide most of
the way. He could be jotted-
down for an early win. His
best distance is one mile.
• • * •
Within six weeks New Zea-
land two-year-old filly My
Melodee has won two races
at Randwick and one at War-
wick Farm. A daughter of
Gabador (imp.) and Rhythmi-
cal by Timanvoa (imp.), she
simply toyed with the opposi-
tion in Tattersall’s Juvenile
Stakes for fillies. She is one
of the best of her age, and is
now to be given a rest before
starting a spring preparation.
Luna Park (second to her at
Randwick) wasn’t lucky in
running and could soon win.
Owner Les Gibson and
trainer Jack Green have given
the mount on sprinter Wool-
sack to apprentice C. Hunt in
three Randwick races, and the
youngster has won them all. In
the Flying on Saturday Hunt’s
allowance reduced the gelding’s-
weight by 71b. to 7.7, only 31b.
above the limit. The favorite,
Second Earl, a top performer
in New Zealand, found his
8.9 too much in the heavy
going.
Though Inquisitive, winner
of the Canterbury Park mid-
week Two-year-old Maiden
Handicap for fillies, had shown
a lot of speed when, at Rand-
wick on Anzac Day, she
finished third to Polo Prince,
four others were preferred to
her —punters are odd fish with
poor memories, and also in
this case they were possibly
influenced by her barrier-
position. Anyway, trainer
C. B. Hasler turned her out in
splendid order ; she won by a
street, and could repeat the
dose. She’s by Bob Cherry
(imp.) from Curiosity by
Whirlaway (imp.).
Having his second race-start,
Martello Towers, a grey colt
by Gaekwar’s Pride (imp.) from
Nidhauli by Nizami (Fr.) from
Fort Denison by Midstream
(imp.), also easily won the
Canterbury Two - year - old
Maiden for colts and geldings,
in race-record time. He’s
another worth watching.
Carl Powell, owner of the
Brooklyn Lodge Stud, Aber-
deen (N.S.W.), bred Regins,
winner at his last five starts,
yet still eligible for restricted
events —this due to shrewd
placing by trainer Les
O’Rourke, to whom owner
H. H. Heaydon leaves the
arranging of engagements.
Regins looked in grand order
at Canterbury, his first city
start. A three-year-old geld-
ing, he’s by Regos (imp.) from
David’s Daughter, a sister of
Fossil, the dam of De La
Salle, whose 16 wins included
an Epsom.

At Moonee Valley
At Moonee Valley last
Saturday punters found to their
cost once again that racing at
the “little track” presents its
own special problems; form
shown at other courses, how-
ever convincing, has to be
assessed with caution. In the
Gippsland Steeple they sent
out Tranquil Glow a short-
priced favorite on the strength
of his last-start wins at Caul-
field and Flemington. She
gave a dashing display out in
front, and seemed to have the
race safely won until she
clipped the third-last fence and
came down. Roadbourne went
on to win the race very easily
in a course-record time of
3.42 7/10, well inside Paro-
xena’s previous record of
3.441

With the Nationals in mind,
Goonawindi’s Fiscom Hurdle


Between
Ourselves
—Have You Ever Tried
This?
One easy way to keep
a wife contented and
quietly-occupied by her
own fireside is to see that
she always reads the
bright, happy, typically-
Australian stories in
The Australian
WOMAN'S MIRROR
Price NINEPENCE ONLY
each week.
win at the Valley was interest-
ing. A five-year-old gelding
by Waterinbury from Queen
Helios, Goonawindi could not
keep himself warm on the flat.
He was a maiden when he had
his first start over the jumps
last August in the Flemington
Sandhurst Hurdle, and showed
immediate promise by making-
up ground to run third. He
injured a tendon in that race,
and it has taken Jack Jury a
long time to get the gelding
right. Saturday’s successful
lun was his first start since.
He showed jumping ability and
stamina to score easily, after
looking beaten half-a-mile
from home. He is one to keep
an eye on, especially with Jack
Jury in charge. Not many men
in Australia know more about
training jumpers.
In the Melbourne ring it
takes a lot of money to
shorten a horse’s price from
33 to 1 to 5 to 1, as happened
with Insiyane in the La Trobe
Stakes (two-year-old fillies).
Out of Lewisham by Wiggle’s
sire Rego, Insiyane is raced by
Mrs. K. D. Godby, wife of
Wiggle’s owner. The filly was
beaten into third place, but did
not enjoy a good run in a very
rough race, and should com-
pensate for her defeat. The
La Trobe was won by Royal
Rest.
* * *
After the very tight finish in
the 13-furlongs Heroic Handi-
cap the judge had to study the
print closely before deciding
that Solgleam had won by an
inch or two from Tauri, with
Auteuil half-a-head further
back. High Peal was just be-
hind the placegetters, while
Prince Dahomey (fifth) would
almost certainly have won but
for two bad checks in the short
straight.
• • • •
There were not many
better milers in Australia in the
post-war period than Attley,
but as a sire he has not been
the success his Turf record
promised. One of the most use-
ful of his progeny is the four-
year-old gelding Foxley, out
of Ingoda Fox. In the weak
Lonsdale Stakes’ field Foxley
wasn’t troubled to win by two
or three lengths.
Earlier in her career, great
hopes were held for the now
six-year-old Bright Hour mare
Just Marguerite, who won races
in Brisbane, Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, but prior
to her win in the first heat of
the Monash Welter at the
Valley she had been out of the
winners’ list for 12 months.
Two of the best young horse-
men in Victoria had a riding
duel in the Monash ; Higgins
tried to steal the race on Special
Prince, but young Lake, on the
winner, kept his mount near
enough to win the sprint home.
It was Lake's 10th Metropoli-
tan success (all scored this year)
and cost him 21b. of his allow-
ance.
There are not many better-
looking horses than Good
Summer in Melbourne, and as
a two-year-old the big chest-
nut raced as well as he looked.
He lost all form for a long
time, but has come good again,
to win twice in a row, including
the second Monash Welter.
Now a four-year-old, Good
Summer was ridden a typical
race by Jack Purtell, who got
the most out of him to win a
close finish from Malarno. It
was Malarno’s best run for
some time, and as that gelding
improves a stone in heavy going
he should be worth following
over the winter months.

One of the most important
—and enjoyable Victorian
race-carnivals outside the Mel-
bourne metropolitan area is
the three-day Warrnambool
Grand Annual Steeplechase
and Warrnambool Cup meet-
ing, which was held last week.
The Steeple is the longest race
in Australia, and the runners
have to clear 32 obstacles —
more than in any other ’chase
in the world. Worth £l5OO
this year, it was won for the
second time in succession by
McKenna —the first horse to
win twice in a row for 30
years. The £lOOO Cup was
won by Paratone.
In Adelaide
It was mentioned here last
week, following his second at
Flemington to Scenic Star,
that Webster would pay his
way in Adelaide. On Goodwood
Day last Saturday, Webster
showed the measure of his
class by winning the w.-f.-a.
Elder Stakes in a common
canter, and clipping 3/10sec.
from the State nine-furlongs
rqcord. On the same pro-
gramme, Royal Artist, trained
by Peter Muschelli, beat the
local star, Goglio, in the
Sires’ Produce Stakes. Vic-
torian horses failed in the
£2500 Goodwood, which went
to Bofresher, to give that
galloper a hat-trick. Today
(Wednesday) is Adelaide Cup
day. Australian Cup winner
Gaybao should score, with
local galloper Trellios and
Victorian Mac his dangers.

The Trots
Three - year - old pacer
Yonkers cleared-out to a six-
lengths’ win in the Derby
Consolation at Flarold Park
on Friday night, downing
Bexiey Hall and Our Cygnet.
In a race to qualify for the
Derby, Yonkers had been
taken to the front early, and
failed to run-on in the straight.
With Jim Caffyn in the seat
this time he was restrained
till two furlongs from home,
when Caffyn raced him to
the front to set-up a com-
manding lead. It was Caffyn’s
39th win at Harold Park this
season, and, with four meet-
ings to go, he looks like beat-
ing Alf Phyllis’s record of
41 wins during a Harold Park
night-season.
Para Rip, who broke-down
in the middle stages of the
Trotters’ Handicap, was the
greatest square-trotter to race
at night-meetings at the Park.
He won four Trotters’ Cups in
Sydney and one in Melbourne,
and holds the Harold Park
131-furlongs record at a mile-
rate of 2.1 lj, and the 151-
furlongs record in the out-
standing time of 2.101. Friday
night’s race was won by
Amazing Numba, who beat
favorite Jenny by a couple of
lengths, with Single Raider
third.
The 111-furlongs Carlton
Handicap was one of the best
races seen at the Park for a
long time. With the excep-
tion of Snow Star, the other
10 pacers were bunched for
the whole journey, several run-
ning four-wide all the way.
Peerless Winn hit the front
with 100yds. to go, but
Crowness wore him down
with a brilliant burst to get
his head in front at the post.
From last at the “bell” Reck-
less Raider finished fast to
gain third-money.

City v. Country
At North Sydney Oval, in
a hard-fought but open game
of Rugby Union, City I beat
Country 1, 26-11. City was the
better team all through and never
looked likely to be beaten, though
Country was not disgraced. it
scored a converted try only a
minute or so after starting, and,
with winger Anderson lanaing a
penalty a few minutes laier, led
8-0 inside that many minutes. City
rallied, and put on tnree tries in
the first half, two converted by
winger Roberts, to Lad 13-8 at
half-time.
Country, playing in the second
half with two men who had played
through the earlier game, then held
City for 25min. before a weak kick
by Country centre hilwood, when
his team was on the attach, allowed
Roberts to break away into the
open and send centre Simpson in
for a try. Ellwood did well on
the tour of N.Z. last year, but
played poorly in this game—perhaps
through not being tuny nt.
Stars of the game were City five-
eighth Summons and Country full-
back Lenehan. Summons, playing
his first game for over a month,
scored a tiy and kicKed a neat
field-goal, and often had ihe Country
defence worried. Lenenan, never
flurried, got Country out of bother
many times, particularly with his
long, well-placed line-tucks. City
full-back Ken 1 hoi nett played
intelligently, but Leneiian seems
likely to till the bouiS vacated by
Terry Curley’s decision to enter the
priesthood.
Rival captains, locks Outterside
(City) and benwicke (country), both
played well. City second-row for-
wards Miller and Carron stood out
among two fairly even pacKS. Fen-
wicke was later selected to lead
N.S.W. against Queensland, with
Outterside also in the team.
City II overwhelmed Country II
52-16. City full-bacK Smee had
a field-day, with a try, eight goals
-and a penalty. Cemre Potts, with
tw'o tries, was the best player on
the field. All Country’s pomts were
scored by winger Butcher (two tries,
two goals and two penalties).
. Country teams this year did not,
as in past years, include any New-
castle players, as Newcastle has with-
drawn from Country affiliation and
become a separate Rugby entity.
However, to provide two annual
games which Country would not
enter as “underdogs” and which
they would have a real chance of
winning, it would seem necessary to
include Newcastle players in future
Country sides.

Carlton, South and North
remain the three unbeaten sides
after the V.F.L.’s third round
on Saturday. Carlton is going
along famously this year, with
two of its three wins on “enemy
territory”; one of them the
usually stiff hurdle of Colling-
wood at Collingwood. But the
Magpies, who have had their
share of injuries this year, were
no match for the Blues, who

played great football all
through, 14.10-9.8. South
stopped Essendon 9.11-7.10 in a
fairly fiery game, while North
had just the edge on St. Kilda
9.9-
In a surprise result Fitzroy,
though also somewhat injury-
ridden, toppled Melbourne
13.9- The Lions, taking
control early, raced away to a
12.8-4.6 lead at threequarter-
time ; Melbourne’s last-minute
recovery didn’t quite get there.
At home Fitzroy has now had
three successive wins over Mel-
bourne. Hawthorn over-
whelmed disappointing Foots-
cray 15.12-8.10, after leading
14.10- at threequarter-time;
while, in the Tigers’ own lair,
Geelong put its first match-
point on the board at Rich-
mond’s expense, 14.12-10.11.
’Wood, Richmond and Foots-
cray have yet to win.
* * *
St. George, Sydney Rugby
League premiers for the past
three years, is now the only
unbeaten side after crushing
North 33-12. North held the
Saints to an 8-7 lead at half-
time, but afterwards St.
George’s experienced forwards
and speedy young backline
took full charge. North captain
Honeysett was a “passenger”
most of the game, but the
Saints would undoubtedly still
have won regardless. In a
team with no weak links,
young centre Gasnier, now
labelled the “find of the
season,” and Test second-row
forward Provan stood out. In
the other games Manly com-
fortably defeated South 20-12,
Newtown did ditto (25-10) to
a Balmain minus three of its
stars, Canterbury held-off
Parramatta 17-10, and, on
Sunday, West only narrowly
beat East 22-19.

At Sydney Sports Ground on
Saturday, Scottish Soccer-team
Heart of Midlothian thrashed
the heart out of a scratch Aus-
tralian team 7-1 ; it led 4-0 at
half-time. On Sunday, at
Wallsend, Hearts again licked
almost the same side 6-1.
Hearts thus became one more
in a succession of overseas
Soccer clubs in recent years to
give Australian teams a Soccer
lesson in combination and
control. It is clear that if these
games are to become more
than just exhibitions, with the
overseas team at half-steam
most of the way, an Australian
squad of the best players from
all States will have to be
selected early in the season to
play together as often as
possible. In the case of Satur-
day’s game the players had not
had one run together; and
several Federation stars had
been withdrawn, to be reserved
against Deportivo Saprissa next
Saturday. All the bickering
and feuding among officials is
not helping mattefs. Indeed,
it’s giving Soccer a very bad
odor altogether.

“Corio”: Now celebrating
its centenary year, the Geelong
football-club is the second-
oldest in Victoria, only Mel-
bourne having a longer history.
“ Wouldn't it be better to rub the liniment into your
joints AFTER you take-off the armor?”
.Geelong played in the Mel-
bourne Association for many
years, at one period winning
seven premierships in nine
years. A foundation-member
of the V.F.L. in 1897, the club
won its first pennant in 1925,
the year after its champion
centreman, “Cargi” G reeves,
had . won the first Brownlow
Medal. Geelong has won five
premierships (1925-31-37-51-
52) and for seven years in
1950-56 finished in “the four”
—a League record. A second
“Cat,” back-pocket star Bernie
Smith, won the Brownlow in
1951.
* * *
“Wilkie”: Keen to win the
first game on their new ground,
Lathlain Park, the Westralian
League football-team Perth
(the Demons) were nearly
short-circuited. They led their
opponents, Swan Districts, by
five points as the timekeepers
pressed the siren-switch, but
the feeble siren note didn’t
reach the central umpire, and
he awarded a Swan Districts
forward a free-kick fully 15
seconds after the switch was
pressed. Back went the forward
for his kick, close to the goal,
but at an acute angle. Then,
a great shout —the ball went
over the goal-post for a
behind, and the Demons had
won by four points.
* * *
“Solly”: In an act of
homage unprecedented in
Westralian League football,
West Perth has withdrawn No.
4 guernsey, the one worn for
16 years by Ray (“Homer”)
Schofield, from the club list.
Homer, who retired this year
from League football, played
277 games with Wests, a
League record, and was noted
for his club-spirit. In future
No. 4 guernsey will be only
used to mark a special honor
for a player, such as his 100th
or 200th game, or a Sand-
over Medal win a brief
appearance for the guernsey
and away it will go again.
Recently Homer joined Hel-
lenics in the Sunday league,
the 33-year-old champion
kicking six goals from centre-
half-forward in his first game.
Before the game he was
accorded the old Greek.custom
of “salute to a champion,”
which goes back to the ancient
Olympics. An 11-year-old
Greek boy presented Homer
with a bouquet of flowers
while the Hellenics stood to
attention. The boy then ended
the ceremony by bowing to
Homer.
* * *
“Oiroc”: One for the record-
books. A Victorian country
club has beaten three Mel-
bourne League teams in a bid
to secure the services of a
highly-rated country forward!
Successful country club is
Warrnambool, which signed
Stan Noakes from Merbein by
offering him a dairy-share-
farming proposition. Noakes
kicked 122 goals for Merbein
in the Mildura League last
season.
* * *
“Bicky”: Winning margin of
Box Hill seconds against Cam-
berwell seconds in the opening
round of V.F.A. football would
be near a record. Scores: Box
Hill, 33.24 (222); Camberwell,
0.4 (4) —218 points diff.

“M.O’H.”: The U.S. might
promote a junior Davis Cup.
Something of the sort has been
developing at Miami in the
tennis-matches on an inter-

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
SOVIET AIMS AND GERMAN UNITY
"yORrriNG in the U.S. quarterly
** “Foreign Affairs,” Franz-
Josef Strauss, West German
Defence Minister, warns
against two cardinal errors in
considering world politics. One
is to lose sight of the larger
context in which selected facts
and events are set ; the other
is to confuse wishful thinking
with what is possible or real.
“There is no doubt that
Germany has occupied a key
position in the eyes of all the
Bolshevik rulers since Lenin’s
day. That was true for the
Weimar Republic and the
Hitler regime, and it was well
demonstrated by the Russo-
German Pact of August, 1939.
For Hitler, that pact opened
the way to aggression against
London "Daily Express .”
“If I bend President Inflexible-
hower to my point of view ...
And Dr. Inflexiblenauer as
well. ..
Plus General de Inflexi-
gaulle...
Surely I’ll have had enough
practice to deal with Mr. K.”
Poland and consequently to the
Second World War, but the
price of Soviet neutrality
demanded of Hitler was a con-
siderable part of Poland, all
the Baltic States, a free hand
against Finland, a large sphere
of influence in the Balkans
and other concessions. Indeed,
Stalin hoped to be the real
victor in a war which he felt
was bound to lead to the ex-
haustion of Germany and the
other Western Powers. Ac-
cording to Soviet ideology, it
was a war of imperialists—the
last manifestation of the
struggle of capitalist against
capitalist—and thus a decisive
stage on the way to capitalist
suicide and Communist victory
throughout the world.
“Lenin wrote in 1920 that if
war does not come of itself it
must be provoked and abetted.
‘lf we are obliged to tolerate
such scoundrels as the capitalist
thieves, each of whom is pre-
paring to plunge a knife into
us, it is our direct duty to make
them turn their knives against
each other.’ Stalin was a
prominent exponent of this
thesis, holding that the Soviet
Union could not ignore a war
between non - Communist
nations, but that it would
interfere only at the finish, in
order to throw decisive weight
into the scales and so shift the
balance of power. In Lenin’s
case, such an attitude was per-
haps understandable in view of
the circumstances prevailing at
the time, but it is an attitude
that is central to the Bolshevik
doctrine of world revolution.
“After the Battle of Stalin-
grad the Soviet Union was the
greatest land Power in Europe,
and could be certain of vic-
tory. It is extremely interesting
to see how Stalin, unlike the
Western statesmen, saw his
actual goal not merely in a
military victory over Germany
but in the acquisition of
strategic positions which would
reinforce post-war Soviet policy.
As the Red Army advanced, it
conducted its operations in
such a manner that military
objectives became political
springboards to greater
power....
“The Western Powers had
no uniform conception of
what should be done with
Germany after its defeat. Dis-
memberment or a unified
administration—that was the
question. Initially, Stalin
agreed to dismemberment,
which would have given the
Soviet Union about 40 per
cent, of the 1937 Reich terri-
tory, in accordance with the
plans drafted by the European
Advisory Commission in
January, 1944, for the demar-
cation of the zones of occupa-
tion. At that time the German
armies were still deep in Russia.
At both the Tehran and Yalta
Conferences, the predominant
idea was to split-up Germany
and create several German
States, although the final solu-
tion was deferred to a post-war
conference. But when the
Soviet armies stood at the
Elbe in May, 1945, Stalin’s
interest in carving-up Germany
had dwindled considerably. He
held not only all the eastern
and south-eastern countries,
with the exception of Greece
and Turkey, but also most of
that part of Germany that was
to fall to him. From that time
on he turned his attention
more to gaining influence over
all of Germany, including, for
instance, the Ruhr, which was
economically and strategically
so important to him. German
unity was suddenly an import-
ant political weapon to be
used towards his own ends.
“Thus it is that we find three
Soviet demands included in all
post-war conferences intended
to find a common solution to
the German problem: repara-
tions in the sum of $lO billion,
partly out of current produc-
tion ; Soviet participation in
the control of the Ruhr;
and the ‘democratisation’ of
Germany in the Western Zone
in the same manner as in the
Russian Zone. These demands
clearly reflect the aims of
Soviet policy in Germany,
especially as set forth at the
Paris, Moscow and London
Conferences of Foreign Mini-
sters in 1946 and 1947. Their
objective was Soviet control
of the whole of Germany and
increased influence in all of
Western Europe.
“In February, 1946, Mr.
James Byrnes, then Secretary
of State, laid before the other
Foreign Ministers the draft of
a Four-Power treaty provid-
ing for 25-year-control and
disarmament of Germany.
That plan envisaged the re-
habilitation of one German
State, without arms and mili-
tarily neutral. Mr. Byrnes said
that a disarmed Germany
would never run the risk of
refusing to obey an order from
Allied headquarters, knowing
such disobedience would bring
the air-forces of one or more
of the four Powers over its
territory in a few hours.
Molotov called for an extension
of the control-period to 40
years. ,Mr. Byrnes agreed. It
was only when Molotov de-
manded the reparations cited
above and Soviet participation
in the control of the Ruhr that
he refused.
“The Moscow Conference of
Foreign Ministers saw a re-
play of the same scene between
Mr. George Marshall and
Molotov. Obviously the
neutralisation and disarma-
ment of Germany were not the
paramount Soviet aims at the
time. What they wanted was
something else —an open door
to the West. Herein lay the
decisive conflict of interests,
the reason that none of the
post-war conferences succeed-
ed in reaching agreement.
“Even as late as May, 1949,
Mr. Dean Acheson, -then Sec-
retary of State, made one last
endeavor. On May 23 there
was published what was later
to become the Basic Law of the
Federal Republic of Germany
—the statute for the fusion of
the three Western zones of
occupation into one State. On
the very same day, the four
Foreign Ministers met in Paris.
Mr. Acheson proposed that the
Basic Law be made valid
throughout Germany and in-
vited the Soviet Union to join

N 2318
the Allied High Commission.
He declared that the powers
reserved in the Occupation
Statute should not be exercised
in such a manner that the
German Government was pre-
vented from enjoying growing
liberty. The German Govern-
ment must be accorded the
opportunity of allying itself
peacefully with other nations
politically and economically,
but not militarily.
“Vyshinsky, who represented
the Soviet Union at the time,
emphatically declined to
accept this proposal. On the
other hand, the Western Powers
were no longer willing to wait.
They put all their energies into
founding the State known to-
day as the Federal Republic of
Germany.
“Quite naturally, the Soviet
refusal to agree to a unified
Germany on reasonable terms
led to increasing economic
distress and human misery as
a result of the conflicting
measures introduced by the
occupying Powers and the fact
that the four zones of occupa-
tion had been hermetically
sealed-off from one another.
Economic paralysis and the
necessity of accommodating
millions of German refugees
and expellees the Federal
Republic, with an original
population of 40 million, ab-
sorbed about 10 million —were
bound to create a dangerous
state of affairs. Radicalism was
bred by despair. Throughout
the world the Soviet Union has
made a good thing out of
radicalism growing from bad
social and economic condi-
tions ; it cherished the same
hope in Germany.
“The failure of the Foreign
Ministers Conferences at Paris
and Moscow resolved the
Americans and the British to
fuse at least their two zones
of occupation. Mr. Byrnes
called this step the ‘last way
out.’ The effect on the Soviet
Union was unmistakable. At
the London Conference, Molo-
tov ascribed to the Anglo-
American plan ‘the tendency to
build up the Western part of
Germany as a base for the ex-
pansion in Europe of American
imperialistic influence’ and ‘as
a strategic stronghold for the
adventurous and aggressive
plans of American imperialism.’
“Soviet policy towards Ger-
many has not changed in sub-
stance in the ensuing period.
All the Russian proposals and
Notes reiterated the same aim
again and again: not only to
prevent any political alliance
between Germany and the West

Minor Wool Boom
A nticipating higher prices at
the London wool-sales than
those recorded in mid-March,
the “Financial Times” said on
April 13 that it was now quite
clear that wool prices and
wool-textile activity were defi-
nitely on the mend:
“The wool-trade has seen
nothing half as encouraging as
the past month’s developments
since the slump in the wool
industry began in May, 1957.
The increase in prices would
have been smaller but for
reports of prospective wool-
buying by Russia—these may
in fact have triggered the whole
movement off—-but that does
not alter the basic picture,
which has been improving for
some time.
“The excessive stocks of wool
in one form or another, which
have been the main cause of
wool’s troubles over the past
two years and which were to be
found in all consuming coun-
tries, have now been worked
off, even in Belgium and
France, where the position was
worst. This has brought with
it an almost automatic re-
covery in wool-textile activity,
especially as retail business in
wool-products continues to be
well maintained. The trade
everywhere has also received
a tremendous stimulus from
the U.S., for the wool-textile
industry there has gone ahead
at a rapid rate and has stepped-
up its demand for raw-wool
supplies considerably.
“With the end of the wool-
selling season close at hand,
and then a break of several
weeks before supplies again
become available, there seems
little doubt that wool prices
will go on rising. Certainly the
upward trend now appears to
be well established, even
though the pace may not con-
tinue to be so fast as recently
and the occasional setback is
not inconceivable. As always,
of course, it is important to
get the position in perspective.
The recent upswing only repre-
sents a minor boom. Both
wool prices and textile-activity
are still comparatively low.
But, as the past month has
shown, movements in wool are
liable to gather momentum
quickly, and there is every
reason to suppose that the in-
dustry is now all set for further
expansion.”
Some Settled
Accounts
A pril 4 was the anniversary
of Hungary’s “liberation”
from the Nazis. The celebra-
tions, with their attendant
Washington “Post.”
“PROSPECTS FOR A SUMMIT MEETING APPEAR
BRIGHTER.”
statements by officials that the
party “had settled accounts
with revisionism” and “isolated
and crushed the forces of
counter-revolution,” set Lon-
don “Economist” thinking
about the news that “in the
Budapest working-class suburb
of Ujpest about 35 young
people have recently been
secretly tried, apparently for
their part in the October
rising; 10 of them have been
sentenced to death, and none
of the rest has received less
than five years’ imprisonment”:
“The trial was glaringly
unfair. Thus there was a pro-
cession of more than 180 wit-
nesses for the prosecution, but
none for the defendants, whose
lawyers were not allowed to
take notes and only saw the
charges once. Local Com-
munists who wanted to testify
that the defendants had not
taken up arms were not
allowed to do so.
“Five Hungarian writers and
intellectuals, said to be
‘adherents’ of Imre Nagy and
to have been working to over-
throw the present regime, have
also just been sent to prison
for terms ranging from two
to 10 years. The charges
against them seem to concern
their activities since the
October rising ; one is that they
collected money for the bene-
fit of accomplices who had
been put in prison already.
“These trials suggest that the
Kadar regime still does not
feel sufficiently secure to dis-
pense with the apparatus of
oppression. Certainly, although
the active discontent should
not be exaggerated, there are
frequent rumblings. Many
peasants are actively opposed
to the present collectivisation
drive. There has also been
serious trouble in Budapest’s
Roman Catholic seminary,
where the spiritual director has
just been dismissed after
almost all the students had
been expelled for refusing to
obey orders—among others, to
associate with ‘peace priests.’
« If Mr Kadar hopes that
of time will make
hj s re gi me more acceptable at
home and abroad, his present
policies—and particularly the
proposed judicial murder of 10
young men—will not facilitate
t h e process.”
New Cunorders
Tn general, press comment has
approved the approach by
the Cunard Line to the U.K.
Government for assistance in
replacing the Queen Mary and
Queen Elizabeth. The “York-
shire Post,” contrasting the
long life of the average factory
with th& comparatively short
career of a seagoing ship,
comments on the high cost of
replacing tonnage:
“The Government has done
much to help shipping-lines
through the 40 per cent, in-
vestment-allowance for ship-
ping. In 1958 the Peninsular
and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company, for example,
retained £4,367,000 in the busi-
ness, in contrast to only
£2,200,000 that would have
been kept if there had been no
investment-allowance. Never-
theless, there are all those
former years in which the
owners saw their fleets deteri-
orating, building-prices rising,
and cargoes and passengers
going to foreign flags.
“Nothing could have brought
this statS of affairs more force-
fully before the nation than the
need to provide'for replacement
of the two Queens in the next
few years, and the Government
has done well to announce that
help will again be given, as
it was given, and fully repaid,
towards building the ships.
Whether Government help by
subsidising the actual running
of new ships would be a good
policy is more debatable, but
one thing is beyond debate, and
that is that the British Mer-
cantile Marine must continue
to operate at the strength
which the world situation of
the British peoples demands.
“We cannot afford to allow
our essential sea-borne supplies
and exports, or the ships that
carry them, to pass into foreign
hands, however friendly they
may seem at any given moment.

* * *
The Edinburgh “Scotsman”
is enthusiastic:
“Public reaction to the pro-
ject of the Cunard company to
build new liners to replace the
Queen Mary and the Queen
Elizabeth has clearly been
favorable. The initiative dis-
played by the company is to be
welcomed, particularly in view
of the action being taken by
other countries. The U.S.
Government is heavily sub-
sidising the construction of a
sister-ship to the United States,
and the French Government
is giving similar assistance to
the French Line. These new
liners will be operating on the
North Atlantic route before
many years have elapsed, and
will seriously affect the com-
petitive position of the two
Queens.
“It is common knowledge
that considerable research -s
being conducted in this and
other countries into the appli-
cation of nuclear power to
shipping. That consideration
alone probably accounts for
the reluctance at the moment
to place orders for expensive
replacements on conventional
lines. But the action being
taken by the United States and
France cannot be ignored. It
is right that the Cunard com-
pany should seek to open
negotations with the Govern-
ment and that reservations
should be placed with the ship-
builders with the least possible
delay. It is widely believed that
the designs for the two ships,
which are already on the draw-
ing-board, provide for them
to be propelled at the outset
by conventional machinery,
but that their lay-out will
permit the introduction of
nuclear propulsion without
major structural alterations.
That belief may turn out to be
correct.
“The building of the two
ships, each of which it is
estimated will cost at least £25
million, will mean much to
Clydeside, and will have a
favorable impact on employ-
ment over a period of several
years. In England as well as
in Scotland there seems to be
a consensus of opinion that it
is in the national interest that
we should retain our place
among the leading shipping
nations in the world. In some
quarters, however, the prospect
of a public subsidy going
north of the Border is evidently
not being regarded with
favor.
“In view, however, of the sub-
stantial assistance being given
by other Governments to their
shipping-lines, it is unrealistic
to expect the Cunard company
to meet the cost themselves.
John Brown’s, who have a long
association with the Cunard
company, built the two Queens,
and it is right that they
should build the replacements.
The new ships could give this
country as great a lead on the
sea as the Comet gave us in
the air.”
* * *
“Manchester Guardian”
doesn’t want to see sentiment
outweigh commonsense:
London “Daily Mail."
OW MUCH?"
“If we are to have new ships
built at the nation's expense
we do not want showpieces ;
the aim should be to have effi-
cient, economical passenger-
carriers which will embody the
best in British engineering. The
notion that mere size counts
has in any event now given
way to a different trend in
passenger-ship design. The
best combination of qualities
for a liner is likely to be found
in a vessel of about 35,000
tons. The Queens are monu-
ments of shipbuilding skill;
but they are also the end of a
line. Smaller ships, no less
fast, will replace them.”
Should Generals
Speak?
TTave U.S. generals been
having too much to say?
“Manchester Guardian”
wonders whether they really
deserve the abuse they have
lately been getting:
“American generals have
been getting a bad press in
Britain lately—just as, no
doubt, Field-Marshal Mont-
gomery’s one-man mission to
Moscow may get a rather
dubious press on the Continent
and in the United States. The
outcry against General Nor-
stad, General Twining, General
White, and Admiral Burke is
not due to anything they have
done but to things they have
said. The implication is that
they are trying to dictate
policy. But when an admiral
or general gives evidence
before a Congressional com-
mittee he is bound to answer
questions to the best of his
ability. If it is his estimate
that, in the event of war,
Russia’s back can be broken,
then he ought to say so. And
if he is asked about the Thor
missiles on bases in East
Anglia he can hardly be
blamed when he says that they
are supposed to be ready for
firing.
“It may be a little embarras-
sing to British Ministers when
they have not given quite the
same impression to the House
of Commons, but that is
another matter. The blame, if
any, ought to go to the Con-
gressional committees for
holding so many hearings in
public (for which Russian
military intelligence must regu-
larly feel thankful to them),
for thereby encouraging the
generals and admirals to say
similar things in other public
statements afterwards, and for
sometimes taking too much
notice of what is said to them.
“Senior officers are entitled
to their views that, for ex-
ample, some forms of disen-
gagement may be disastrous
and that it is possible in war
to break Russia’s back ; neither
Congress nor anyone else is
obliged to believe them. It is
up to people on both sides of
the Atlantic to weigh one lot
of evidence against another.”

TICKETS, PLEASE!
[By “G.H.”]
TTe had been thinking for
months of holidays and
freedom —freedom and holi-
days—but now, on the eve of
departure, Mr. Brown felt quite
flustered.
“Excuse me,” he said hesi-
tantly, “but do I understand you
to say that to reserve my
accommodation at Bount
Muffalo Chalet I must pay for
the whole fortnight in ad-
vance?”
“Yes,” replied the Tourist
Bureau briskly; “Government
Railways, you know!”
“Well, I never,” said Mr.
Brown, groping slowly for his
cheque-book. “I hope it’s all
right.” The ink spluttered, the
blotter smudged, and Mr
Brown, feeling timid and
strangely resentful, squeezed
the receipt into his trousers-
pocket with a gesture of gruff
finality.
On arrival at the Chalet, his
composure restored, he
(wisely, as it turned out)
ignored the bright, painted
signs demanding “NO PARK-
ING BEYOND THIS POINT”
“TURN HERE” “DO
NOT PARK ON RIGHT
SIDE:—“PARK IN HERE”
—and proceeded to drive right
to the entrance-veranda.
Finding the office, he remark-
ed cheerfully, “The name is
Brown. I have a reservation.”
“Your receipt, please?” was
the reply.
“I beg your pardon?” from
Mr. Brown.
“Your receipt. How do you
expect me to check you in
without your receipt.”
“Oh, I beg your pardon.
My receipt. Oh, yes. Now I
wonder what I did with it.”
“Well, you must have it to
be booked-in.”
“Oh, dear. What was I wear-
ing? I say, what do you want
my receipt for? Dash it all,
my dear young lady, after all,
it is my receipt y’know.”
“Well, you’re booked into
room thirty-eight, so please un-
pack and find it, and bring it
to me at once. This is Govern-
ment Railways, you know.”
Mr. Brown moved away to
find Room 38. Holidays and
freedom freedom and holi-
days! The Victorian Govern-
ment Railways public-address
system coming vigorously to
life, croaked noisily—“ Will Mr.
JCoffmeyer please come to the
telephone, Box Number One?”
“Yes, I must find it. I do
hope it’s here,” thought Mr.
Brown, unpacking earnestly.
Interruptions by the loud-
speakers jarred him constantly,
but he bravely battled on until
the dinner-bell reminded him
that he’d be better after a rest
and a little food. It had been
a long, tiring day, and perhaps
he was being a little unfair.
After all, it was a Government
Railways place ; you must ex-
pect a little red-tape.
Be sensible ; be patient ; after
all, one mustn't expect help or
freedom from a Government-
run place! Or—or—well, why
shouldn’t one? After all, dash it
all, it’s my holiday—my chance
for peace and freedom my
right to expect service—l give
it all the year, and for this fort-
night I want to receive it.
Mr. Brown muttered, won-
dered, and suddenly remember-
ed the dinner-bell. Quickly
finding the dining-room and his
table, his composure was re-
stored at the contemplation of
the fine service and cuisine he
had promised himself for his
holiday, for his moment, his
fortnight’s freedom.
The Railways waitress ad-
dressed him.
“Sir, you are ten minutes
late. The soup is off, the entree
is off, but you may have a
main course and sweets. But
please, in future, be punctual
for meals. You’re ten minutes
late.”
“I’m frightfully sorry,”
replied Brown. “I thought for
the moment I was on holiday.”
“Well, holiday or not, I
don’t know anything about
that. But what do you want to
eat? And please be quick.”
At this moment the croak of
the loudspeaker again silenced
conversation, and Brown be-
came conscious that his name
was dominating the air. “Will
Mr. Brown please come to the
office? Mr. Brown. Mr.
Brown.”
“Heavens,” said he, “that
must be me.”
Like a man falling through
space, his brain flashed visions
of all his past sins—his in-
discretions the time he
smoked behind the lavatory-
wall—the time he nearly kissed
the lassie at the dancing-class.
It all flashed before him in a
moment. Or—was there illness
at home?
“Mr. Brown.”
“Mr. Brown is wanted at the
office.”
“Mr. Brown.”
Fearing the worst, he
dropped his napkin to the
floor, and, stumbling from the
room, got to the office.
“Mr. Brown—wherever have
you been? Didn't I tell you to
bring me that receipt?”
With a buoyancy that was
a credit to his Cornish
ancestors, Mr. Brown still con-
templated a holiday of freedom
and simple joy.
He continually said to him-
self, “I’m here, I’m here. I’ve
paid for it. I must accept it
and enjoy it if it kills me. Why
should I worry if they issue a
railway-ticket for everything?
I like railway-tickets. Of
course I do! I like railway-
tickets for this, railway-tickets
for that. Of course I should be
able to complete my dinner in
30 minutes.”
Bells ringing, time for this.
Bells ringing, time for that.
Raucous speakers calling
people to the phone. “I love
it! I love it!” insisted Mr.
Brown.
He found himself at night
dreaming of tickets to ride,
tickets to play, tickets to eat,
and even tickets to sleep.
Always he must walk on time,
play on time, eat on time, sleep
on time. Or else.
In spite of everything, Mr.
Brown struggled on grimly.
His jaw set, his determination
was of a quality to be mar-
velled at. Nothing—no, noth-
ing—no, nothing—would stop
him.
He’d enjoy this. He’d have
the time of his life.
He would, he would!
Yes, let's play billiards —I'll
get the ticket. Or putting, or
croquet —I’ll get the ticket.
Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!
Let’s pretend it’s free! Let’s
make-believe!
Loudspeaker croaks loudly.
No matter! No matter! We
didn’t want to rest, anyway!
“Mr. Brown, to the office,
Mr. Brown.” Steady now,
steady now!
“I am Mr. Brown—did you
want me?”
“Yes. Have you a ticket for
your garage? Why didn’t you
book your garage in Mel-
bourne? You can't book a
garage here.”
Mr. Brown, having survived
his holiday, returned home to
the bosom of his family.
“Oh, my dear, I'm so glad
you’re home,” said his wife.
“I've got tickets for . .
Mr. Brown suddenly
stiffened “Tickets! Tickets! ”
he screamed. “If you mention
tickets to me I’ll —I’ll—I’ll ”
Trying to explain to the
doctor, Mrs. Brown was be-
wildered.
“I really haven’t any idea,”
she said. “I just told him we’d
been lucky enough to have
been given tickets to see ‘My
Fair Lady,’ when it all hap-
pened, like a runaway railway-
train.”

All Classes of Ordinary Life Assurance,
Superannuation and Annuity Policies Issued
HEAD OFFICE: 15 O’Connell Street, Sydney
Telephone BL 5601 K. J. Hedley, General Manager
old German missionary, resi-
dent in the Bainings, regaled
us with villainous red wine and
wildly improbable tales of past
Mokolkol exploits. Thence to
Baia inlet, on the sparsely-
populated east Nakanai beach,
our jumping-off place.
Bill Heather continued down
the coast to hire carriers for
the trip from Übili and Sule,
wheue he was well known, and
Chris and I set about preparing
stores and sorting-out our
police-detachment.
In routine foot-patrolling in
the New Guinea bush you
travel from village to village,
hiring carriers at each, camp-
ing in little thatched rest-
houses, and subsisting largely
on garden-produce sold or
bartered by the villagers.
Along the trails between vil-
lages you shoot pigeons and
hornbilts for the pot, and
occasionally bag a cassowary,
possum, python or tree-
kangaroo, which gladdens the
light hearts and strong
stomachs of the constabulary.
The elusive wild-pig, while
plentiful, is rarely encountered
on the march. In localities
where game is scare you eke
out your canned meat with
athletic village chickens and an
occasional domestic pig. The
highly-prized indigenous hog
is usually a crafty razorbacked
misanthrope, long of snout and
smouldering of eye—unless
blinded by his owner to pre-
vent straying. He is apt to
be an indiscriminate feeder,
with a fondness for uprooting
corpses from village cemeteries,
and his flesh is more like
mutton than pork. Not an
engaging animal —but never-
theless, fresh meat.
Tf you’re sound in legs, lungs
and digestion, are tropic-
proofed against prickly-heat,
safeguard your greased boots
from starving village dogs,
keep your basic stores dry,
bring plenty of tobacco and an
erudite tome you won’t finish
quickly, cherish a folding
camp-chair with back and
arms, an efficient pressure-
lamp, and a henchman able to
bake bread without an oven,
then touring tribal areas can
be reasonably carefree and
comfortable.
But a jaunt like our assign-
ment, into virtually uninhabited
country, searching for humans
much wilder than the local
game, is a more exacting job,
entailing careful preparation.
Because of the need for secrecy
of movement, you can’t estab-
lish advance-bases or be sup-
plied by air ; you can’t shoot
for the pot; and you can’t
expect to augment supplies by
barter. It calls for night-
watches, no strong lights, and
care regarding smoke and
noise.
The patrol must be entirely
self-sufficient, and its duration
is limited by the rations that
can be carried. Fancy foods
must be discarded: rice, bully-
beef, Navy biscuits, sugar, tea,
vegeniite and onions form the
staple diet for all hands.
A permanent carrier-line is
necessary, and this involves
various little logistical calcula-
tions. The maximum load for
a porter is 401 b., and he’ll eat
about l|lb. of rations a day.
With strict supervision of meal-
issues, this means that in 23
days he will consume a weight
of food equal to his original
load and he can’t be sent
home when his load is used.
On long-range intelligence-
patrols during the war we
learnt that, even with camping-
gear reduced to minimum
essentials, and irrespective of
the number of porters, a com-
pletely self-contained one-
officer patrol can’t operate
efficiently for much beyond 16
days.
Expeditions of this sort are
rare. Administration patrols
are primarily concerned with
people, and in most populated
areas of New Guinea root-
crop foods are plentiful.
Except in times of seasonal
shortage or local political crisis,
a patrol can expect to live off
the country, without touching
the rice-reserve for days on
end. In such areas Native
Affairs patrols of up to four
months’ duration are not un-
common. You camp in or near
villages ; and, in the best
imperial tradition, trading
literally follows the flag-
hoisting.
In the back-range country
the supernatural origin still
frequently ascribed to the
whit e m a n’s manufactured
goods-is no bar: to men who
have felled trees with stone-
axes the virtues of steel require
no extolling. Granted a modi-
cum of political adroitness and
some knowledge of local
suppiy-and-demand peculiari-
ties, a patrol’s continuing sub-
sistence then becomes a simple
economic equation—the con-
vertibility of compact trade-
items such as salt, razorblades,
knives, fish-hooks and cloth
into bulky, stomach-filling
yams, sweet-potato, taro, corn,
bananas, sago and pork.
Mokolkolling was a different
proposition, and on this par-
ticular trip there would be
three officers, 10 constabu-
lary and two cooks. We
studied the map, and estimated
for a comfortably rationed 12-
days’ wander, with 36 porters.
This included provision for
young Chris’s fruit-juice and
my bottle of rum.
T'Vuring the next day a tricklb
of porters arrived, includ-
ing a dozen rather scruffy little
Kaulons from Kol, on the
slopes of volcanic Mount
Ulawun (the Father), New
Britain's highest point (7546 ft.).
This was a pleasant surprise,
not only because mountaineers
are best for mountain-patrols
but also because the Kaulons
(the word is a mildly derisive
coastal Nakanai term, roughly
equivalent to “hillbillies”) lived
under a constant threat of
Mokolkol raids, and feared
them intensely.
They were eager to accom-
pany us, they said —as long as
they weren’t expected to hgnt.
They had no recent informa-
tion of their predatory neigh-
bors’ movements, and had
never ventured into enemy
territory. The two survivors
of the Kasalea raid flatly
refused to move from Baia:
they said they preferred to wait
and see what happened to us.
1 spent the afternoon giving
firing-practice to the police,
explaining to them the nature
of the job, allotting positions
in the column-of-route (a bush-
patrol necessarily moves in
single-file, and rearguard duty
is particularly important), and
rehearsing the tactics to be
adopted in the improbable
event of our being attacked
whilst on the march. Apart
from the corporal and my old
friend Bosi, the detachment
comprised youngsters not long
out of the training-depot.
Meantime Chris had made-
up the stores into man-loads,
packing rice into the few
rubberised-bags we had man-
aged to cadge, and using
leathery bark sheaths of the
limbom-palm to waterproof the
remainder. He had borrowed
a couple of new sanitary-pans
from the Rabaul sanitation-
depot—galvanised drums with
rubber-lined, clip-on lids —and
they proved ideal containers
for sugar, salt and tea.
.At sundown Bill Heather
arrived back in the Ulamona
Mission launch, piloted by
Father Stemper, lately of
Columbus, Ohio. They
brought 20 more carriers, two
fine Spanish mackerel picked-
up along the reef, and my
garrulous old friend Moite, the
lu'luai of Übili, who had served
on several Mokolkol expedi-
tions in his youth. We ate the
mackerel and listened to
Moite’s tall stories.
The Father left at moonrise,
after staking a claim to salvage-
rights over all Mokolkol souls.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Septic Systems
About two years ago the
N.S.W. Department of Public
Health approved the installa-
tion of septic-closets in this
State, as a compromise between
the pan-system and the costly
septic-tank. The department
had before it reports on the
South Australian system of
septic-closets and the Victorian
system of single-tank septic-
tanks, and for some reason it
decided to adopt the South
Australian system, although
there was strong unofficial
advice from plumbers and
drainers outside the depart-
ment that the Victorian system
was the better one.
In a matter of months
hundreds of septic-closets were
installed in local-governing
areas around Sydney, particu-
larly in the Warringah Shire,
where sewerage is practically
non-existent. Septic - closets
were also installed in large
numbers in the non-sewered
areas around Newcastle. Re-
ports on their working were at
first enthusiastic ; but after a
time complaints began to flow
in of offensive odors being
given off, particularly in the
late afternoon. “Expert” advice
was that these odors could be
prevented by a weekly applica-
tion of lime, but this well-
meant advice proved, in some
cases at least, to be highly mis-
leading.
Late last year, after an accu-
mulation of evidence that the
septic-closet wasn’t the success
that had been hoped, the De-
partment of Public Health
approved the installation of the
single-tank septic - system
which had been recommended
previously. This is identical
with the system operating
in non-sewered areas in Vic-
toria. It is much cheaper
to install than the double-tank
system and costs only about
£3O more than a septic-closet.
People who earlier accepted
the department’s approval of
the septic-closet as an indica-
tion that it was completely
satisfactory, now face the alter-
native of carrying on with it,
despite its objectionable fea-
tures, or of incurring the cost
of installing the single-tank
system, without any real assur-
ance that it, too, after a time,
will not prove unsatisfactory.
People who now apply to the
Department of Public Health
for advice about installing
a septic-system are given litera-
ture which makes no mention
at all of the septic-closet—a
pretty clear indication that it
has been dumped. Small
wonder that many house-
holders who installed septic-
closets are now feeling pretty
sore about it. — Peter Simple
(N.S.W.).
Rockets or Tucker
While the U.S. and Russia
are fiercely competing in the
production of space-rockets,
“It might be all right in Paris or Rome, Mike—but the Dry West ...."
and while announcements are
being made about the launch-
ing of manned missiles into
space in the fairly near future,
an American investigating
committee has reported that 85
per cent, of the world's popu-
lation are underfed, and that
the food-position is likely to
deteriorate. Meanwhile, there
is a surplus of more than 2000-
million bushels of wheat in the
principal wheat - producing
countries.
Thus it is that, while millions
are starving, Governments are
spending on scientific fireworks
colossal sums of money
which, incidentally, are gener-
ally obtained by fiscal measures
that discourage production and
restrict exchange of com-
modities.
Since this situation is to a
large extent due to the ideo-
logical clash between Com-
munism and democracy, and
since Communism thrives on
poverty and destitution, it
would seem more rational to
spend less on rockets and
armies, and more on economic
aid to underdeveloped coun-
tries. It would certainly be
more humanitarian.
This is not to advocate
straight-out disarmament or
anything so extreme. But when
it is realised, for example, that
Australia spends something
like 20 times as much on de-
fence as on economic aid to
underdeveloped countries, even
a relatively slight shift in the
ratio doesn't seem either im-
practicable or unwise.
Isn’t the conquest of the
maldistribution of wealth in
this age of progress a more
urgent challenge than the con-
quest of outer space and the
building of bigger and better
rockets? —Fragmos (Vic.).
Traffic-fees in W.A.
One of the problems facing
W.A.’s new Liberal-Country-
party Government is to sort-
out the local-government bill
which dragged through the last
session of Parliament before
being abandoned in despair;
and one point that should be
considered is the use to which
licence-fees are put.
These fees are a direct
tax on motorists, and
justified only to the extent
that they're used to police
the traffic Acts, to pro-
vide aids to the flow of traffic
and to build and maintain
roads. When used for any ex-
traneous purpose they become
an unjust imposition on one
section of the community.
At present they’re used very
largely for other purposes, as
the present Act permits them
to be lumped together with,
general rates, loans and any
other income a board or muni-
cipality may have. (It’s
different with the petrol-tax,
which is allocated only to those
authorities which are helping
to maintain main-roads, and
this money must be used only
for roads.)

THE MUTUAL LIFE AND CITIZENS’ ASSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED ( incorporated in n s.w.)
MLC.46.HP.
In my Perth suburban dis-
trict, for the financial year end-
ing last June the road-board re-
ceived £B4OO in traffic licence-
fees. Its total expenditure on
roads, construction and main-
tenance was £5700. That means
that not one penny of general
rates was spent on roads, while
£2700 of traffic-fees went for
items other than roads. As
£4500 was taken for mainten-
ance of recreation-grounds, and
nearly £6OOO was required to
maintain drains and culverts —
not natural creeks, but drains
built solely for the benefit of
householders whose blocks
were in danger of flooding—-
motorists are contributing
pretty extensively, as a class,
to the general maintenance and
sporting activities of the
district. (Sport in Australia is
a grossly pampered institution,
and many branches of it don’t
make any serious attempt to
maintain themselves.)
My board doesn’t rate highly,
for which I suppose I should
be grateful ; but an additional
£3 or £4 a year on my rates,
and on those of every other
ratepayer, would produce a
revenue far in excess of what
is now yielded in traffic-fee
rises. It would provide far
more than does the recent £7-
a-year increase in my traffic-
fees —an increase which, in my
district at least, is being used
to maintain recreation-grounds.
The ratepayers of a district,
whether they’re motorists or
not, derive considerable benefit
from their roads, and they
should be required to con-
tribute towards them. Roads
should not be the sole respon-
sibility of the motorist, who is
already building the main
roads of the State. But if, by
some obscure reasoning, it's
considered fair that motorists
shall wholly provide the roads,
then it should be enacted that
his contribution must be de-
voted solely to that purpose.
The new W.A. Government
has' the opportunity to rectify
this grave injustice.— Pieter
Nuyts (W.A.).
Hides and Hamburgers
Here, in Queensland's largest
provincial city, the price of
shoe-repairs has lately risen by
10 per cent. The explanation
is that the current shortage of
hides on the American market
has created a greater and more
profitable demand there for
Australian hides, thus leaving
Australia in shorter supply.
Yet the fact is that about
95 per cent, of Queensland's
cattle-station owners throw
away their hides because it
doesn't pay them, unless they
are right on the railway, to
send hides to Brisbane —after
treating the hides they would
get only ss. to 10s. each for
them on the Brisbane market.
Of course the price of cattle
has advanced considerably in
the last six months because of
the hamburger demand at the
U.S. end ; but, all the same,
the above-mentioned hides still
don’t leave this country.—
Raw Material (Q.).
Pity the Publicans
Not long ago I detested our
publicans—and 1 knew a great
many of them from travelling
in all States. With a few
honorable exceptions, I re-
called vividly their arrogance
and avarice during the days of
beer and spirits shortages ; their
almost blatant black-marketeer-
ing ; their grudging bestowal
of a bottle or two on “regular
customers.”
Their lot today is very
different, and it is human-
nature for the worm who was
their reluctant patron in the
past to delight now in their
sufferings. The only trouble is
that most of those who socked
the cash away in strongboxes
under the bed (to trick the tax-
boys) during the war and im-
mediately afterwards sold-out
at high prices before the bubble
burst and the breweries finally
got round to providing ade-
quate supplies. Many of the
new men who paid for ingoing
on the basis of past trade had
their fingers burnt as business
settled down and competition
increased.
In some States, notably
N.S.W., they are also suffering
seriously from the sudden ex-
pansion of licensed clubs, which
can trade for longer hours
and also offer their members the
“privilege” of gambling legally
on poker-machines. The publi-
cans pay special liquor-licence
fees in addition to all forms of
taxes, whereas many clubs are
either exempt from, or can
legally avoid, some kinds of tax.
Some hotels also lose trade
where cafes secure limited
licences to serve liquor with
meals.
The Associated Chambers of
Commerce have noted these
things and are now suggesting
that the problems of hotel-
accommodation and the build-


ing of first-class pubs to attractis
tourists will be solved only if
some heed is paid to the plight
of present-day Bungs. They
have suggested more liberal
liquor-laws to permit hotels to
supply drinks with meals at
least to midnight, and the lift-
ing or easing of other restric-
tions.
All this seems to make sense.
It will be a pity if the wowsers
are vocal enough to block it,
and to hold the country back
at a time when it is beginning
to attract some worth-while
world notice as offering tourist
attractions coupled with a
reasonable freedom from wars,
revolutions and diseases.
One suggestion is that the
spate of club-licences should be
checked, and new ones issued
sparingly and for good reasons
only. Another (a political hot-
potato) is that the clubs should
lose . the gambling-machines
after due warning has been
given to allow them to adjust
their financial commitments.
After all, good hotels, supply-
ing accommodation of satis-
factory standard as well as
meals and drinks, are essential.
We need a lot more of them
in city and country, and it's
time we got them. — Charles
Meeking (N.S.W.).
Honorary Degrees
Might one inquire from
“Archaen” (B. 29/4/’59) what
the precise value of an
honorary degree?
Take the case of a writer. If
he is looking for recognition he
can find it best of all in the
sale of his books. If, however,
he is writing to create literature
only, then he must wait for the
judgment of posterity—which
is in itself a sort of post-
“ Strange—he said he Was a rock-'n'-roll fan”
humous degree (if the writer is
looking for degrees).
Australian universities, like
universities elsewhere, are con-
ducted under a charter, with
rules and regulations. Under-
graduates are admitted on
certain conditions. In the case
cited by “Archaen” the D.Sc.
had not complied with such
conditions in respect of his
original science course at that
university ; so, when conferring
the honorary degree, the
authorities had to treat him as
a non-member of their univer-
sity. Far from ‘'-swallowing'’
any pride, they actually went
out of their way to meet him.
There are plenty of organised
bodies already in existence to
recognise talent in literature
without that becoming part of
the duty of universities, whose
main function is in regard to
their own members and alumni;
the fact that a writer’s book is
required reading in any course
implies nothing more than that
such a book is regarded as
representative of a certain
branch of literature. It certainly
establishes no standard.
Honorary Reader (Q.).
In his criticism of the hide-
bound attitude of Australian
universities towards granting
honorary degrees to individuals
who have done outstanding
work in their chosen field
but who aren't graduates,
“Archaen" directs attention to
one of the many ways in which
Australian institutions lag
behind their counterparts else-
where in encouraging and re-
warding men of merit.
He might have added that
our universities aren’t even
reasonably consistent in pro-
fessing to believe that anyone
who isn't a graduate is be-
neath their notice. For, on
one hand, Australian univer-
sities have fallen over each
other in conferring honorary
doctorates upon distinguished
visitors from overseas, some of
whom have never matriculated,
let alone graduated ; and, on
the other hand, some, if not
all, have been ready enough
to engage the services of
brilliant non-graduates to
lecture to and examine students.

courtesy distinctions.
But few would deny that
there should be some means by

More on Bodgies
Not long ago a friend of
mine was bludgeoned from his
bicycle by three late-teenage
hoodlums (or bodgies) around
midnight near Fairfield (Syd-
ney) and robbed of 15s.
Luckily, he had taken his sub-
stantial pay home the pre-
vious night.
Two nights later I saw three
late-teenage bodgies skylarking
disgracefully on a train from
Bankstown (Sydney). One of

old man who lawfully rebuked
them. The old chap bravely
hopped up, prepared to defend
himself, but a couple of young
men indicated quick interven-
tion had the bodgies not
promptly retreated into an-
other carriage.
Surely it’s nonsense for wel-
fare groups and police to pre-
tend that the bodgie-widgie
cult isn’t a serious menace to
(to twist a phrase) “good
order and civilian discipline”?
Bodgieism is simply child-
delinquency in its worst and
most blatant form, and it's
difficult to believe that the
police, under existing laws,
can’t deal more firmly with it
than they do.
Admittedly, the growth of
child-delinquency is rooted in
laxity of parental control —
together with the official
tendency to abolish corporal-
punishment in schools but
sharp reprisal should be ac-
corded unseemly conduct in
public, whether committed by
callow youths or adults. Con-
centrated effort for, say, six
months by the appropriate
authorities against bodgieism
might go a long way towards
curbing its spread.
In one or two of the larger
Sydney districts a vigilante
system has actually been dis-
cussed by citizens. That in
itself represents a vote of no-
confidence in the authorities
handling- of the situation. —

Developing Australia
Unlike “Plain Australian”
(B. 22/4/’59), I see many
advantages in the single-State
approach to national industrial
development, and some disad-
vantages in a national approach.
Victorian Premier Bolte,
who went overseas four years
ago to interest British and
American industrialists in his
State and has just left on a
second mission, must be given
some of the credit for the fact
that nearly 40 per cent, of
migrants coming to Australia
settle in Victoria because of
the great industrial expansion
there since the war.
Bolte was the first Premier to
realise the need to go abroad
and “sell hard”; and the fact
that other Premiers have
followed his lead shows the
value of his policy. A little
competition in this field, as well
as in others, certainly does no
h arm -
After all, who is better fitted
than a Premier to talk with
overseas industrialists on be-
half of his State? He carries
his State’s prestige with him ;
of necessity he knows his own
territory better than he knows
the continent as a whole ; and
he has experts at his elbow to
give all the answers.
If he gets results his State
benefits directly and almost
immediately, while the other
States derive indirect advan-
tages by way of increased pro-
ductivity, employment and
Government revenue.
“Plain Australian” is right
when he says it would be
nationally advantageous to
develop the areas he mentions;
but we can’t compel capitalists
to invest in localities unaccepl-
able to them. Naturally they
want to establish their indus-
tries in areas already well-
developed, close to transport
and, if possible, to ancillary in-
dustries and with access to
adequate supplies of power
and manpower,
i feel that a national corn-
mission charged with the job
G f selling Australia as a whole,
or even certain country areas,
would be hamstrung from the
outset. Being a Commonwealth
instrumentality it could not
recommend companies to start
in this or that State, and it
would be subject to other dis-
abibtes.
It is obvious that big indus-
trialists, before they invest
millions of pounds in a State,
will want to know something
of that State’s political history;
and in most cases—other things
being equal—they will plump
for the States whose politics
appear satisfactory from their
point of view. That is one
reason why Bolte and Playford,
in their overseas missions, have
achieved considerable success,
A national commission
wouldn’t dare touch this all-
important subject of politics.—

MASTITIS AND MACHINE-MILKING
[By W. G. WHITTLESTONE]
Tt is widely believed that there
wasn’t any mastitis-problem
until we started to use milking-
machines. This isn’t really true.
In fact, certain ways of hand-
milking are more harmful than
the machine.
For instance, use of the
thumb to squeeze the teat is
specially bad. In India, where
hand-milking is usual, there is
possibly more mastitis than we
have here, and all surveys I
have studied show no signi-
ficant increase in mastitis with
the introduction of machines.
So we can conclude that
mastitis is a problem with
cows no matter how we milk
them.
What is mastitis, then, and
how can it be controlled?
Mastitis isn’t really a single
disease ; it is any disease of the
udder, generally caused by two
groups of organisms or “bugs”
—streptococci and staphylo-
cocci.
The commonest form of
mastitis has tended to be that
caused by streptococci (strep.,
for short) and this kind can be
cured by using antibiotics,
such as penicillin. But with
the wide use of penicillin two
things are happening which are
not too good. It has been
known for some time that if
an udder is infected with
“I'll siOap you two packets of thallium for one of
myxomatosis."
streps, the staphs don’t get
much chance of setting-up
house, because of the antago-
nism between the two kinds of
bugs. Now, if we mop-up the
streps with penicillin we make
it easier for the staphs to gain
a hold.
But there is even worse to
follow! So far, the streps
causing mastitis have not be-
come resistant to antibiotic
treatments. But unfortunately
many staphs have. So what
we are doing is building-up in
our herds a reservoir of
resistant staphs which not oniy
cause mastitis but can cause
all sorts of other things as well.
In the last 10 years strepto-
coccal mastitis has tended to
become less important, so, of
course, there is less response
to penicillin as a result. This
means that we have to take a
good look at~how bugs get into
the teat and. what can be done
to stop them. In other words,
it is truer than ever that pre-
vention is better than cure.
We may regard mastitis as
war between the udder and the
bugs. The healthy udder has a
natural protective mechanism
which enables it to stop bugs
doing any harm even if they
are inside. The teat is closed
by a special springy muscle-
mechanism, called a sphincter,
which helps to' stop bugs get-
ting in from outside. The
tighter this sphincter the better
the protection, but the tougher
the cow is to milk.
The water-buffalo illustrates
that point rather well. She
normally lives in dirty water,
and so is liable to become in-
fected more easily than a cow
living on dry land. So the
buffalo has evolved a tight
teat, which needs about a 20in.-
vacuum before any milk comes
out of it. She is naturally a
tough milker.
Over the past few years we
have become very conscious of
the need for fast milking as
a means of cutting costs and
possibly improving production.
Hence we cull “slow milkers.”
This means that we are tending
to build-up herds which have
less ability to stop bugs getting
into the udders. By aiming at
fast milking we could breed
cows with slack teats which
become infected easily.
If the number of bugs trying
to get into the teat is reduced,
the chances of disease breaking-
out are also reduced, so good
hygiene plays its part in
reducing niastitis. I have dis-
-cussed this earlier, and won’t
take time over more detail
now. There is, however,
another aspect of the problem
which should be discussed in
more detail: the role of the
machine as an infective agent.
The milking-machine can in-
fluence the incidence of mastitis
either by causing damage to the
udder and teats and reducing
their natural resistance or by
spreading organisms. The first
of these influences has been
studied over a long period, and
important results are still
coming in. I will summarise
some of the recent findings.
It used to be thought that the
vacuum in the machine
was a serious factor in
causing mastitis. If a
machine is worked properly,
vacuum is not very important.
High vacuums may increase
the chances of trouble, but
disease only breaks-out if some
other factor is also present.
However, as there are no
advantages in using a high
vacuum, 15in. is suggested as
the normal level for working
the machine.
Air-admission seems im-
portant ; always make sure
that there is a clear l/32in. air-
admission hole in every claw.
There is a suspicion that
snappy pulsation may cause
trouble. For stimulation,
snappy pulsation may be
helpful, but it may also
be bad as regards risk of
mastitis. In any case, as I have
said before, cows should be
properly stimulated before the
machine is applied, so that
machine-stimulation is not
really important.
I would recommend the use
of a pulsator-action giving a
gentle squeeze and a rapid
release. It should also have a
short squeeze so that milking
is as fast as possible, though
too short a squeeze should be
avoided. I have used a 20/80
pulsator without trouble, but
this was under really good
shed-management: 25/75 is a
good figure to aim at.
The teat-cup of the machine
has a great effect on health
of the udder. The heavy
moulded type of inflation, with
a metal mouthpiece, which
was used years ago, is particu-
larly unsatisfactory. Field-
studies in New Zealand showed
that this type of cup causes
more mastitis than other kinds.
The ordinary soft inflation is
not too bad from this point
of view, though it’s hard
to keep clean because of the
crevices round the mouthpiece-
ring and the nipple at the
bottom. The best type of in-
flation is the soft, moulded

type with the walls and tail
all in one piece, preferably
made of synthetic rubber to
resist the action of butter- and
skin-fat. Such inflations should
have a soft mouthpiece and
walls.
There is no need for tighten-
ing this type of inflation, and
one very good cup on the
market here is so designed that
you just pull the inflation into
place and leave it until it
packs-up. It has a good life
and, having no adjustments for
tension to worry about, .is as
simple and hygienic as it is
possible to be.
Another important aspect of
the machine in controlling
mastitis is rate of milking—
the average output-a-minute
figure. Such factors as cup-
design, pulsation, etc., mainly,
affect the way the machine acts
on the cow, and so the amount
of damage it may do. Rate of
milking has two effects ; it in-
fluences the time the machine
may act on the udder, and also
the way in which it spreads
bugs.
If the cow has let her milk
down when the cups are put
on there is an immediate rapid
flow of milk, giving no chances
of bugs getting into the teat.
As <.the milk-flow slows-up,
things start to change. The'
udder becomes slack and the
cups crawl up the teat. Finally,
in many cows, the narrow
channel inside the top of the
teat closes-off because of the
crawling of the cups, and the
vacuum can reach the inside of
the teaf. The delicate tissues
lining the walls of the teat are
damaged by the vacuum
making the blood vessels swell
and stopping circulation.
Another undesirable effect
shows-up: towards the end of
milking or at the beginning, if
let-down is slow, the milk is
made to surge to and fro
between the four cups. When
only one teat is still milking,
it is possible, by means of sight-
bowls on the cups, to watch
the milk from this one teat
moving in and out of the other
cups.
Milk also surges back into the
cups from the milk-rubber. If
this one teat is infected, clearly
the bugs will have a go at the
others, with their chances of
getting in improved by the
crawling action and develop-
ment of a vacuum inside the
teat, which makes poss.ible a
small flow back up the teat. If
the action has gone on long
enough to damage the protec-
tive linings of the teats, the
bugs have a chance of gain-
ing a hold, and so of starting-
off another “crook quarter.”
There’s only one way to
avoid this kind of damage—
keep-up the milking-rate and
cut-down the time the cups are
on the cow. This means good
stimulation to make sure the
milk is down before the cups
are put on ; and the use of a
sight-glass or milk-flow indi-
cator which clearly shows when
the flow is falling.
The machine should be
adjusted to give fast milking ;
a short-squeeze pulsa t o r,
steady 15in. vacuum, adequate
air-admission, fin. droppers
with good-sized taps, etc. But
the most important thing is the
good indicator.
Recent studies in England
have shown the benefits of
using a flow-sensitive indicator,
which makes it possible for
the farmer to know what sort
of let-down the cows are giving
and to get the cups off as soon
as flow has slowed-down. The
recommended end-point, based
on many studies in New Zea-
land and overseas, is 0.31 b. to
0.51 b. milk a minute. The
figure of 0.51 b. milk a minute
is perhaps the best one to use,
and the indicator should be
calibrated to show this clearly.
There are two indicators on the
market here which do that.
One shows a graduated range
of flow from about 21b. down
to 0.251 b. a minute ; the other
shows a sharp end-point at
0.51 b. a minute. There • are
arguments in favor of both
systems ; in my opinion both
are valuable, and it’s a ques-
tion of getting used to one
system or the other.
Once a farmer has got used
to the positive end-point type
of indicator which shows the
flow-rate clearly he will not go
back to the old jelly-jar, which
is only a very rough indicator.
I have seen cases in which the
cups have been left on two
minutes of even more too long
as a result of using a jelly-jar
sight-glass.
In additon to good milking-
methods, good cleaning is
essential. Now that we know
more about transfer of bugs
within the machine, I am scep-
tical about dipping the cups in
disinfectant. We are now
working on another means of
getting rid of bugs from the
cups. In the meantime, keep
your machine in good order,
change inflations regularly, use
a good method of cleaning, a
good indicator, and have plenty
of running water to wash the
udders with, and an udder-cloth
with a good disinfectant handy.
Record Oaf-yields
“Pastoral”: As was reported
in The Bulletin, at the
Esperance (W.A.) Research
Station the Westralian-bred
variety Avon, grown in an oat-
variety trial, gave a yield of
89.8 bushels per acre. If (as
claimed) that was a record, it
has been smashed by crops
entered for competition by
members of the Woogenel-
lup Pasture and Stock Im-
provement Group and judged
by A. F. Smith, agricultural
adviser for the W.A. Depart-
ment of Agriculture.
Estimates were made by
taking samples in squares
throughout the 20-acre crops,
oats from the squares being
threshed and weighed and yield
being calculated from the
samples.
Of the nine entries, esti-
mated yields were 106, 96, 93,
91, 90, 90, 85, 64 and 63 bushels
an acre. All but one of
these, a crop of Kent oats, were
of the Avon variety. All crops
had lodged to some extent, but
the winning entry had stood-
up well, only a small patch or
two having lodged.
Grown by A. J. Hunt, the
winning entry obtained 95
points out of a possible 100
with its estimated yield of 106
bushels an acre ; C. C. Adams
was second with 90 points (96
bushels) ; F. Ford third with
87 points (93 bushels).
Brood Sows
“Windy”: A brood sow has
to eat enough for herself and
her unborn pigs. If food is
scarce she will lose condition,
and when the piglets are born
there will not be enough milk
for them, and they will be
undersize and subject to
disease.
Usually there’s grain avail-
able for the pigs, but this isn’t
the best food for the expectant
sow; it is too concentrated and
lacks the minerals necessary
for bone-formation in the
coming litter. These minerals

—principally calcium and
phosphorus—can be supplied
by skim-milk, one of the
cheapest and most nourishing
of foods. Dried skim-milk or
buttermilk-powder, with graz-
ing on lucerne or green grass,
will supply all the vitamins
and minerals a sow needs.
In the early stages, skim-
milk, grass or lucerne and
plenty of water are all the sow
will need (the ration of skim-
milk, by itself, is not enough
to supply her liquid needs).
Later, grain and protein-meal
should be fed. The amount of
grain need be only about lib.
to 21b., and if skim-milk is
available there’s no need to buy
protein-meal.
During the later stages of
pregnancy the sow should have
exercise ; she can get all she
needs running on lucerne or
pasture. Warmth in winter is
essential, otherwise she may
lose the pigs.
Watch-out for lice, which
breed on the sow when she is
resting. Sump-oil and kero-
sene, mixed in the proportions
of one to six, should be brushed
on her back with an old-paint-
brush cleaned of paint.
Preserving
Fence-posts
“Big Billy”: The C.S.I.R.O.,
helped by the N.S.W. Forestry
Commission, has developed a
sap-replacement process for
treating fence-posts which can
be used on freshly cut and
barked sapling-timber. Briefly,
the theory is that, when a
round sapling is stood in water,
sap evaporating from the
exposed length of the post is
replaced by water drawn-up
through the sapwood.
The C.5.1.R.0. Division of
Forest Products has had en-
couraging results from the use
of leach-resistant preservatives
of the copper-chrome-arsenic
type on various eucalypts.
Generally speaking, any green
eucalypt can be treated, pro-
vided it has at least yin. of
sapwood, though timbers that
split badly while drying should
be avoided, and not much is
yet known about tea-tree,
wattle-scrubwoods and the
pines.
For economy, posts should
be as small as possible—
diameter of 3in. to sin. under
bark for ordinary posts and
of 6in. to Bin. for gate- and
corner-posts, provided these are
sunk at least 3ft. in the ground.
They should be cut only when
the bark can be removed easily,
because even small areas of
inner bark will slow-down the
process. Use a spade or the
back of an axe when barking,
and avoid cutting the sapwood,
since this will interrupt the up-
ward flow of preservative.
Keep knots above the ground-
line, to prevent decay or
termites reaching the untreated
heartwood.
If posts are to be sharpened
for driving, the points should
be blunt, because extra solu-
tion must be used to keep the
cut sapwood submerged until
treatment is finished. Don’t
pre-bore the posts for wire,
and, apart from boring, don’t
cut them in any way once
treatment has been given.
The preservative salts are
available in powder-form or as
a wet mix readily soluble in
water. All the preservatives,
including the arsenic, are safe
to handle if the usual precau-
tions are taken.
Cold, wet weather will slow-
down the treatment ; but, while
treatment in hot weather is
much quicker, posts will then
be more difficult to bark. If
there is danger of rain, treat
the posts under cover.
For most eucalypts a solu-
tion of about 3| per cent,
strength is required to obtain
the desired loading, lib. dry
salt to 1 cu.-ft. sapwood. Leave
posts in the solution until there
has been good absorption,
and then turn them on end.
The whole process may last
from a few days to a fortnight,
depending on the timber and
the weather.
To test the efficacy of ab-
sorption, allow one or two
posts from the first treatment
to dry for a day or so, then
cross-cut them 6in. above the
groundline. The sapwood
should show a uniform greenish
color.
Posts can be used im-
mediately after treatment
or stacked to dry thoroughly.
If top-splitting occurs during
drying, stop it going further
by means of a wire-tie. Tops
of important posts, such as
gate- or corner-posts should be
protected by using a gal-
vanised-iron cap to keep water
out of the heartwood.
Round posts treated by this
method should last up to 30
years under normal conditions.
As well as being resistant to
termites and decay, they are
less likely to catch fire than un-
treated posts.
Early Weaning
“Billjim”: Experiments at
the Rutherglen (Vic.) Research
Farm show that early weaning
doesn’t benefit fast-growing
fat-lambs grazing on good
pasture. However, slow-grow-
ing fat-lambs grazing on
limited pasture can be weaned
with advantage if moved to a
good pasture-paddock. Slow-
growing lambs from wool-
breeds grew faster when
weaned. With ample feed avail-
able from good sub.-clover
pasture, normally mothered
lambs grew faster and pro-
duced heavier and better car-
casses than lambs weaned at
nine-weeks or over.
Where there isn’t feed and its
quality is doubtful, slow-
growing lambs would benefit
from weaning to really good,
spelled pasture at 12 to 14
weeks of age — particularly
when ewes are infested with
worms and pastures contami-
nated with worm-eggs.
Harvesting Seed
“Sundowner”: Harvesting of
pasture-seeds is always trouble-
some, and all methods used
hitherto have been slow or
have needed expensive and
elaborate equipment. Trials
now going on at Roseworthy
(S.A.) Agricultural College
show the value of the flail-type
forage-harvester in picking-up
barrel-medic and sub.-clover.
Results so far indicate that
other seeds could also be har-
vested by this method.
Early-summer trials in
a paddock of barrel-medic and
burr-medic began by raking the
dry growth with a side-delivery
rake, the windrow being rolled
by the tractor-wheels to
release additional pods, and
then re-raked. Seedpods on

HADDON RIG RAMS
at the Sydney Sales
First thing in June, you will have your oppor-
tunity when 121 Haddon Rig Rams will go under
the hammer. Some will be exhibited at the
Sydney Sheep Show, where the Stud is competing
for only the third time; the previous occasions
were in 1922 and 1923.
Recent visitors to Haddon Rig are greatly
impressed by the team selected for the Sydney
Sales. They regard it as most outstanding, and
agree with local judges that these rams are easily
the finest to be offered for many years. The five
Haddon Rig Special Stud Rams are of such
remarkably even quality that the job of
cataloguing them took much longer than usual;
the problem was to determine the order in which
they should be listed.
Together with 38 Stud Rams and 22 Selected
Flock Rams, the five “Specials” will be offered
by Dalgety & Company. Thirty Selected Rams
will be offered by Elder Smith & Company, and
26 more by Goldsbrough Mort & Company.
This year, the demand for Haddon Rig Blood is
particularly brisk. Five hundred more Flock
Rams were available in March—and all were
sold. Stud sales on the property include Stud
Rams at 3000 and 2000 guineas to a major
pastoral company, and one at 1500 guineas to
another pastoral firm. Improved seasonal condi-
tions and the continued rise in wool prices are
other pointers to a successful Sydney Sale.

the ground were picked-up
with a forage-harvester and
collected in a covered trailer.
This method was successful
but dusty, as a lot of dirt
collected in the trailer.
E.-T. Mann, who supervised
the trials, said the most efficient
method is to do away with
preliminary raking. He
pointed out that, with the flails
adjusted to miss the ground
by yin., practically all the
trash and pods can be picked-
up with the minimum of earth.
Also, by adjusting the height,
some seed can be left for re-
establishment of the pasture.
In all the work so far done
the harvesters have travelled at
under 2 m.p.h. Material was
forked or tipped from the
trailer on to the ground, then
put in front of a header, with
sieves and speeds as for wheat.
Mann emphasised that this
isn’t an ideal arrangement, but
it shows how a farmer with a
forage-harvester, a trailer and
a header can harvest this type
of seed fairly efficiently and
cheaply.
Shorter tests on beaten-down
and tangled wheat and barley
have shown there could be a
future for this method in har-
vesting crops which could not
be taken-oif by conventional
yp,e t h o d s. The trials also
showed that fair results can
be obtained and labor-costs
decreased by windrowing from
a forage-harvester and using a
pick-up - front on a header,
though some blockages may be
expected and recovery is likely
to be slower.

ant to the pest. Sown in
spring, said C. M. Blick, of
the N.Z. Agricultural Depart-
ment, in a survey of the prob-
lem, they will prevent attacks
during the subsequent summer
and autumn.
As far as chemicals go, both
D.D.T. and B.H.C. can be used
as dusts at 601b. an acre,
though baits are easier to apply,
and so are generally more
popular. Baits usually consist
of 241b. bran and 41b. molasses
to the acre, with the chemicals
added at 1 / 101b. of 100 per
cent, active ingredient. Costs
may be reduced by substituting
sawdust for half the bran ; if
bran isn't available, poultry-
mash may be used instead.
Dieldrin is effective as a
spray, and large areas can be
covered when it is used in
conjunction with a tractor and
boom or from an aircraft. It
gives good results, too, when
used as a dust at 4oz. an acre
of 100 per cent, material. Baits
can be applied through a top-
dressing-machine, or by using
a dieldrin-lime mixture (the
chemical is sprayed into the
lime), applied by spinner-top-
dressing.
Time of application is
important, though difficult to
decide, because crickets are
often present in large num-
bers before they, can be
detected. The only sure way
is to check pastures carefully
during December and January,
trying to anticipate the build-
up by applying insecticide
before any damage is done.
Blick said he considered that
damage to pasture could be
further reduced by avoiding
close and continuous grazing
and by draining wet soils
thoroughly.
New Strawberry-
growing
“Big Billy”: During trials at
the Levin (N.Z.) Horticultural
Station weedkillers were used
to destroy vegetation on an
area which had been lawn,
and strawberries were planted
without any further soil-pre-
paration. Subsequent weed-
growth was controlled by
means of black-polythene
sheeting or sawdust used as a
mulch. Plants have made good
growth and the use of poly-
thene seems to have enhanced
their vigor.
Amitrol (50 per cent.) and
Dalapon (85 per cent.) were
applied together at 51b. to
32gal. water an acre, with a
second application a fortnight
later to finish-off resistant
clover and other plants. After
planting, a balanced fertiliser
containing nitrogen phosphorus
and potash was applied as a
side-dressing at 40cwt. an acre,
just before the plastic mulch
was put in position.
The black polythene was in
a sheet 0.002in. thick and 6ft.
wide, with slits midway be-
tween the rows and at 45in.
intervals to allow water to
enter, while sawdust-mulch was
applied to other rows to a
depth of l|in. Weed-growth
was completely destroyed under
the plastic cover. There was
some growth through the saw-
dust-mulch, though less than
on cultivated areas mulched in
the same way. Varieties used
were Auchincruive Climax,
Lassen, Merton Princess and
Talisman.

Information on John W. Keely
and his “perpetual-motion” motor ?
Born in Philadelphia (U.S.A.) in
1837, and died there in 1898. He
was a good mechanic and a clever
talker, though not highly educated.
In 1872 he induced some engineers
and capitalists to organise a com-
pany and subscribe $10,000 to
produce a machine which was called
a “hydro-pneumatic-pulsatory-vacu-
engine.” This appeared to work
wonders on water-fuel. A pint of
water poured into a cylinder caused
iron bars to be broken and stout
ropes torn apart. Keely declared
that with a pint of water he could
send a train from New York to
Philadelphia, or, with a gallon, a
steamship from New York to Liver-
pool. The fraudulent character of
his “invention” was not revealed
until after his death, when it was
discovered that his model was driven
from a source of power located in
a cellar. The means used was not
identified, but the pipes and con-
nections indicated compressed-air.

Who discovered Cooper Creek ?
Why is it sometimes called Barcoo
River ?
This irregularly flowing stream,
running from south-western Queens-
land into the north-east of S.A.,
was discovered by Charles Sturt.
In August, 1845, he found the
Strzelecki Creek, an overflow of
the Cooper, and in the same month,
on his journey to the edge of the
Simpson Desert, he first crossed the
multiple dry channels of the mam
stream. During the return from his
second expedition north from Fort
Grey, in Octob'er-November, he
explored upstream until forced to
turn back at a point where the creek
divided into many channels. On
November 9 he wrote: “I gave the
name Cooper’s Creek to the water-
course we had so anxiously traced,
as a proof of my respect for Mr.
Cooper.” Mr. (later Sir Charles)
Cooper was the first Chief Justice
of S.A.
Subsequently there was much
controversy about the naming of
the creek, details of which are given
by F. L. Parker and J. D. Somer-
ville ( Historical Studies, vol. 2,
No. 8, 1943). The controversy fol-
lowed A. C. Gregory’s revelation
(in 1858) that the stream which Sir
Thomas Mitchell had named the
Victoria, and which E. B. Kennedy
had declared was called Barcoo by
the aborigines, was in fact the
upper course of the Cooper. In
1860 the Secretary of State for the
Colonies authorised the name
Barcoo for the entire course.
Thereafter the stream was shown
on maps with Barcoo River and
Cooper’s Creek as alternative names,
and it was about 80 years before
the use of Barcoo only for that
part which lies above the junction
with the Thomson was generally
adopted. It is now the usual
practice to omit the possessive “s”
from the name Cooper’s Creek.

Hoyv to etch letters on glass ?
Clean surface of glass thoroughly
and heat evenly until it can hardly
be held. Apply a thin coat of
etching-ground, making it smooth
by dabbing with a small ball of
silk filled with cotton. When dry,
trace the lettering with a sharp
steel point, cutting clean through the
varnish to the glass. The varnish
must be removed from each letter,
otherwise the etching will be in-
complete. When ready, apply
enough fluoric-acid with a feather
to fill each letter and allow it to
remain until it etches to the required
depth. When this takes place,
wash-otf with water and remove the
varnish.

Biographical details of conductor
Bruno Walter, mentioned in B.
25131’59 ?
Born in Berlin on September 15,
1876, ne began his career when,
at 17, he was engaged as
conductor at the Cologne Opera
House. For the next two years he
was at the Hamburg Opera House,
first as chorus-master, then as con-
ductor. In 1901 Gustav Mahler
invited him to the Vienna Opera.
Walter stayed there for 11 years,
developing his own career and
increasing the artistic reputation of
the opera-house. His next post
was in Munich, and after a decade
there he conducted at Berlin and
Leipzig and took part in the found-
ing of the Salzburg Music Festival.
Walter’s American career began
in 1923, as guest-conductor of the
New York Symphony Orchestra.
He returned the following two
seasons, also appearing as guest-
leader of the Boston, Detroit and
Minneapolis orchestras. Each
summer he went back to Europe to
fulfil engagements at the principal
music-centres. From 1935 to 1938
he was principal conductor and
artistic adviser of the Vienna State
Opera and Vienna Philharmonic.
At the end of this term he went
to France, and at the outbreak of
war crossed to America as guest-
conductor of the New York Phil-
harmonic Symphony Orchestra and
other leading orchestras. He was
musical-adviser of the Philharmonic
Symphony Orchestra from 1947 to
1949, and since 1946 he has returned
to Europe each year to conduct
at international festivals. In
1950 he conducted a Beethoven
Cycle with the Philharmonic Sym-
phony Orchestra; in 1951, a
Brahms Cycle. He has written two
books: a work on Gustav Mahler
and an autobiography, Theme and
Variations.

(1) Main features of the Constitu-
tion imposed by Napoleon on
Switzerland in 1803 ? (2) Main
features of the 1848 Constitution ?
(1) Napoleon was the author of
the first Swiss Constitution of prac-
tical value —the Act of Mediation
(1802-03), which he worked out
with the help of. delegates from the
various Swiss parties. The Con-
stitution recognised the sovereignty
of the cantons and revived the
former Diet. The president of the
Diet was formally to represent the
Central Government, but had no
executive power. Napoleon realised
that by giving back to Switzerland
its Federal Government he diverted
the country from taking an active
part in the war against France.
(2) The authors of the 1848 Federal
(Swiss) Constitution —Kern of
Thurgau, Druey of Vand, and
Fazy of Geneva —drew their inspira-
tion largely from the American
Constitution. Executive power was
placed in the hands of a Federal
council of seven members elected


by Parliament for three years, and
in practice almost always re-
elected. The legislative authority
lay in two Chambers, one represent-
ing the nation as a whole and the
other the cantons. A feature of the
Constitution was the ample pro-
vision made for its amendment.

Length of the railway-tunnel
under the Severn River between
England and Wales, and some
information on the tunnel ?
According to The Railways of
Britain, by W. H. Boulton, the
tunnel under the Severn is the
“outstanding” tunnel in the-British
Isles. In 1872 an Act was passed
for the construction of the tunnel,
which was to have a “roof” of not
less than 36ft. between arch and
river-bed, and work began in 1873.
As the Severn estuary is very deep
and fast-moving in parts, the tunnel
had to be taken down a long way.
It took 13 years to build; in 1879
work was interrupted when water
broke in with tremendous force, the
workers getting out just in time. The
tunnel, which was opened for regular
traffic in 1886, is 4 1/3 miles long,
though its overall length, including
approaches, is seven miles. It has
a, gradient of 1 in 100 towards
England and 1 in 90 towards Wales.

How to preserve or pickle olives ?
The fruit should be almost fully-
grown, but not allowed to ripen or
harden; it should b'e picked while
still green. Wipe well, drop into
water containing one level dessert-
spoon of salt to every quart and
stand for 24hrs. in a cool place.
Make a pickling-mixture of fine
white or brown vinegar containing
to every quart one teaspoon salt,
half-teaspoon pepper, two tea-
spoons sugar, a pinch of allspice
and six cloves; heat to dissolve all
the ingredients. There are two
methods which may be chosen to
taste: (1) Allow the pickle-stand
to cool, pack the olives out of the
salted water into jars and pour the
strained mixture over them; seal
when cold. (2) Drain the olives out
of the salted water, drop them into
the pickle liquid and simmer gently
until the fruit can be pierced by a
knitting-needle. Gather the olives
in a strainer from the pan in which
they have been cooking, pack into
jars and pour over them the strained
liquor in which they were cooked.
Allow to cool, then seal. Store in
a cool, dry place.

Women's Letters
SYDNEY
It was quite a bright week for the city,
with a good deal of social activity and an
atmosphere of light-heartedness on
Commem. Day, when University students
decorated the crowds with Arabs, angels,
20-year-old babies in prams, seedy, top-
hatted toffs, male Margot Fonteyns and
the like. They cheered things up con-
siderably, didn't do any harm, and col-
lected £4OOO for Red Cross. So all was
well, except that the procession was kept
moving rather too quickly and the copy of
“Honi Soit” that was sold was a bit too
heavy-handed.
☆ ☆ ☆
Of course, the trouble with Sydney
is that there are always so many odd,
interesting and amusing characters to be
seen in the streets, that one was sometimes
caught-out in smiling at what one thought
was a very funny undergraduate, but who
turned out to be a very fashionably-
dressed lady, or a genuine health-crank,
or a true-blue eccentric like the wild-
eyed gentleman who muttered continually
as he strode along Martin Place, “So
Billy Graham was going to fix the weather
for us, was he? Ha, ha, ha!” No one
'would have taken any notice of him ordi-
narily, but he got a laugh on Commem.
Day.

This Letter here puts in a whole-
hearted vote for Lord Mayor Jensen’s
plan for making a park with trees and a
fountain where the Queen Victoria build-
ing now stands. How it would open up
the city, give it freshness and life as well
as beauty! There would be a car-park
underneath the garden-square (a fine idea
and one that the Opera House designers
should have thought of). As a matter of
fact, this Letter was discussing with one
of Sydney’s loquacious taxi-drivers only
a couple of weeks ago how wonderful it
would be to have a park in just that
position, and the taxi-driver approved,
except that he wanted the car-park in the
basement and the garden on the roof of
a multi-story hotel!

World Red Cross Day, which com-
memorates the birth of the idea of Red
Cross on the birthday of Henri Dunant,
its founder, was celebrated in Sydney
by a reception and in the evening by
a Centenary Ball organised by the
Young Twenties committee. Committee-
president Margaret Barrett looked
charming in a bouffant dress of blue
tulle decorated with little bows and
covered by a matching cape of blue
taffeta. Escorted by her fiance, Lieuten-
ant Kerry Bell, she welcomed the official
party, which included the Dean of the
Consular Corps, Mr. Henning Hergel,
and Mrs. Hergel. Radio-personality
Harry Dearth, as compere, proposed the
toast of Red Cross at midnight, and
this was drunk in champagne by all
present, and the red-and-white three-
tier cake was cut by Sheila Bradley,
star of “Grab Me A Gondola,” who
with Guido Lorraine, Johnny Ladd and
Bill French came along after the show.
Joan Winchester, who plays the part
of Calpurnia in the Genesians’ new pro-
duction, “Julius Caesar, 1959,” has
worked with the East Sydney Technical
College Group, appearing in “The
Trojan Women” and “A Midsummer
Night's Dream,” and also with the
Metropolitan Theatre. This production
opens on a racecourse, interprets Ccesar
as a dictator of ’ modern times and Mark
Antony as the “gentleman-jockey” type.
Besides giving a new fillip to the study
of Julius Caesar by fifth-year students,
it emphasises the timelessness of Shaks-
peare’s plays.
The opening night of the Phillip
Street Theatre’s “Birthday Show” took
on something of the atmosphere of an
ex-students’ reunion, because it cele-
brated the theatre’s fifth birthday, and
many of those who had taken part in
its gay, topical revues in the past were
in the audience. June Salter, Margot
Lee, Bettina Welch were among those
who added to the glamor, and director
William Orr made a warm curtain-
speech. He came here from Glasgow
seven years ago, and has certainly
added a distinctive and individual com-
mentary to the life in this city.

Anthony Coburn’s play, “The Bastard
Country,” had its world-premiere at the
Elizabethan Theatre during the week
and was greeted with a fair degree of
enthusiasm. The author, who with his
wife and five children (who range in
age from five weeks to five years) live
in England, could not be present, but
official guests included the Premier and
Mrs. J. J. Cahill and Education Minister
R. J. Heffron and Mrs. Heffron.

Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Williams held a
reception at the U.N. Information
Centre in Martin Place during the week
for Mr. Alexander Mclver, representa-
tive of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, and Mrs. Mclver. The object
of Mr. Mclver’s appointment to Sydney
is to arouse Australian interest and
sympathy in the plight of the 30,000
refugees still in camps in Europe. It is
not proposed to bring the refugees to
Australia, but to provide funds for them
to establish themselves in the countries
in which they are now living. This is
a task which, if world support is given,
could be accomplished within a year,
and Mr. Mclver is hopeful that Aus-
tralians will live-up to their reputation
for generosity.

There was a good deal of interpreting
at the reception held by the Sydney
Symphony Orchestral Committee for the
Rumanian conductor Constantin Sil-
vestri, who does not speak English, but
who can rattle away in French at the
rate of about 250 words a minute. Mr.
H. Cannon, the A.B.C.’s of
Music, translated his cheery words with
ease and composure, and M. Silvestri’s
humorous, nature came across well to
communicate itself to his listeners. He
said he was pleased with the friendly
atmosphere he found in Australia, and
his one concern was that we should still
be friends with him after his concerts!
M. Silvestri has, by the way, generously
consented to conduct for the Musician’s

A gasp of delight went up from the
committee of the Black and White ball
at their meeting during the week when
they were shown the design John Amory
has submitted for the decoration of the
Trocadero at the ball this year on Octo-
ber 6. The dance-floor is to be trans-
formed by the addition of a French
pavilionj on each side of the bandstand,
which itself will be decorated as a


pavilion. These will have striped,
pointed roofs, but will be open and
will have special elevated floors for
dancing. Tables will run fan-wise
towards the centre of the dance-floor,
and tall trees covered with illuminated
roses will rise towards the ceiling.
Though warned that the scheme would
be expensive, the committee voted
unanimously and enthusiastically for this
exciting decor.
MELBOURNE
After a week of such warm hospi-
tality that many expressed some doubts
of their survival, personnel of visiting
U.S. ships of Destroyer Squadron II left
Melbourne on Saturday, after the Coral
Sea dinner-ball had kept many dancing
until dawn at St. Kilda Palais. It was
one of the gayest functions of the week,
with a strong emphasis on youth (and
gallantry) and a tropical-island decor to
add to the romantic mood. This was
supplied by flowers (bougainvillea and
hibiscus being flown specially from
Queensland), exotic shells and plants, and
table-decorations that featured sarong-
clad damsels standing by palm-trees and
lagoons.
Younger dancers had no monopoly of
the floor, however. Mrs. Graham Hall,
in the official party with her U.S. Consul-
General husband, had specially chosen a
full-skirted gown because she loves to
dance, while guests-of-honor General C.
Kuter and Mrs. Kuter were also among
those who enjoyed waltzes in dreamy,
old-style rhythm as well as the more-
energetic numbers. Mrs. Hall wore a
cashmere wrap, sequin-embroidered to
match the design worked in sequins on
her sea-blue taffeta dress, and Mrs. Kuter
was eye-catching in brilliant-red satin,
made with a full-length skirt and tight-
fitting, sleeveless bodice, over which she
wore a matching jacket. Mrs. R. G.
Casey, as president of the Australian-
American Association, received guests,
assisted by her husband, the Minister
for External Affairs.
In the official party with the com-
mander of the visiting squadron, Captain
J. G. Franklin, and the captains of the
four U.S. ships, were Sir John Latham
and Lady Latham, Sir Edmund and Lady
Herring, Cr. and Mrs. John Buchan, Air-
Vice-Marshal and Mrs. I. D. McLachlan,
Sir Arthur Warner and his wife, Sir
George and Lady Coles and Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Killough.

A large number of Australian service-
men, councillors and their wives were
among the guests of the Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress, Cr. and Mrs. F. W.
Thomas, after they had watched the
Coral Sea march from the balcony and
dais of the Town Hall. Sir Dallas and
Lady Brooks were present (her smoke-
blue suit was trimmed with matching
fur). Mrs. Thomas chose lichen-green
for her suit and a deeper green for her
small cloche. Unusual ear-rings with
pearls at back as well as front made
quite a conversation-piece for Mrs. J. M.
Saunders (American vice-president of
the Australian-American Association),
whose lime-green dress was matched with
a small feather-trimmed hat. Also attrac-
tive in green was Mrs. E. A. Doyle, who
was accompanied by her husband and
her niece, Miss Theresa Doyle. Others
at the reception were Mr. and Mrs. J. M.
Saunders, Cr. and Mrs. Leo Curtis and
their daughter Anne, Mr. and Mrs. L. J.
Dooling, Captain and Mrs. George Fowle,
and Mr. and Mrs. Wesley Ince.
Miss Margaret Dewey, who is settling-
in at Melbourne University as principal of
Janet Clarke Hall, is the first American
woman to fill this post. She met quite a
number of Australian students when-
handling vocational-guidance with the
Women’s Employment Federation in
England, where she also spent three years
as Warden of St. Anne’s, in Gloucester-
shire. Although she lists music as her
chief hobby—she was assistant-Pro-

Western College, Ohio, after spending two
years as a Fellow in Music at Harvard-
walking and cycling provide a recreation
that Miss Dewey hopes will enable her to
cover quite a lot of ground in Australia.
The young-looking principal is also an
animal-lover. When a schoolgirl at her
parent’s home at Lake Placid, in up-State
New York, she trained Siberian huskies
as a sled-team. She admits, however, that
their discipline must have lacked strictness,
as they were too friendly to be trained as
patrol-dogs during the war, though some
of them went to Labrador as messenger-
dogs. Miss Dewey is looking forward to
seeing Australian sheep-dogs at work.
The Alfred Hospital Development
appeal is still putting variety into the
weekly round, and was responsible for
taking some hundreds of visitors as far as
Nagambie (the town with the lake in its
main street) when Mr. Eric Purbrick
threw open his historic vineyard, Chateau
Tahbilk, for a barbecue and garden-
party on Sunday. The vineyard—loo
years old next year—looked very lovely
in its autumn colors, and conducted tours
of the cellars and grounds gave visitors
some interesting sidelights on wine-pro-
duction, while their children enjoyed pony-
rides and helped demolish huge quantities
•of food. The outing was arranged by the
junior committee of the appeal, with Mrs.
John Officer, Mrs. William McDonald
and Mrs. Ronald Sawers as convenors.
“Pyramid” parties for the same fund
(which in a week has already raised
more than £56,700) entertained six of the
couples who were at the launching-party
organised by Mrs. James Buchanan the
week before. Hostesses during the week-
end were Mrs. Frank Wilson, Mrs.
Dennis Mirams, Mrs. Ross Hayes, Mrs.
E. G. Cordner and Mrs. Stuart Hancock.
Each would expect six couples among
their guests to entertain five couples
next week, and so on until the final
party leaves only one couple to play
hosts.

There has been quite a run on
souvenir-spoons traditional farewell-
gifts—as each week more members of the
American women’s auxiliary of the Royal
Children’s Hospital leave for Canberra
with their husbands and families. Recent
farewells included those given to Mrs. H.
Cary, Mrs. C. White and Mrs. J. Marsh.
After a brief flying-trip to Alice Springs,
the U.S. Air Attache and Mrs. J. J.
Hussey are getting ready to move from
their Melbourne home with their four
sons, Timothy, Jonathan, Peter and
Daniel. They expect to sail next month
for the U.S. ; Colonel Hussey has been
posted to Washington.

unpublished verse is unlikely to be
done; but his examples and his argu-
ments are hardly likely to shake the
judgment of Matthew Arnold, that
Burns was at his greatest not in “The
Cottar’s Saturday Night” but in “The
Jolly Beggars,” and a few little songs
like “Jamie Come Try Me” and “O
Whistle and I’ll Come to You, My
Lad” —he was hardly a rock-and-roll
fan, was Matthew Arnold, but he didn’t
make the mistake of putting gentility
above sincerity and truth.
But Arnold wouldn’t go all the way
with Pearl, and their names may stand
for two points of view. Pearl values
Burns as the voice of the company-
gathered-here-tonight, half the man
himself, half the bravado he assimi-
lated from his companions. Arnold
valued him as the individual voice, no
less a genius himself for his penetration
into the genius of Scottish song. And
it is here that neither Pearl nor Lind-
say is very helpful to the studious, and
where Burns is most mysterious: how
much of Burns’s greatest songs did he
find, and how much did he bring to
them? In the present “Encyclopaedia”
there is a tantalising little essay on
“Auld Lang Syne”; but a book the
size of Pearl’s on this subject might
solve a lot more real problems than
his present one.
Still, the “Encyclopaedia” is a fas-
cinating enough book to turn through.
It prints all sorts of sidelights on
Burns, including early reviews, notes
on musicians who met him and on
places where he lived, and short
biographies of the vast number of
people who knew him, from lords and
ladies to beggars and prostitutes.
There is old Mrs. Dunlop, for
instance, the fine old lady with whom
he corresponded until his death; and
Captain Robert Riddell, who ordered
Burns out of the house for “too
energetically” embracing his wife at a
drunken party —there is a Lawrence
portrait of her sister-in-law, Maria
Riddell, which would prove that Burns
got around with some pretty grouse
sorts if the silhouette of Mrs. Agnes
"McLehose (“Clarinda”) on the other
side of the plate didn’t render that
unnecessary. For it doesn’t need Barke
to tell Lindsay that Burns and Mrs.
McLehose were lovers; it is nice to
look at that (at any rate in silhouette)
lovely little face and to think that for
a short while it was not denied to him,
and that when it was it broke his heart,
and that this produced one of his
greatest poems (though these are senti-
mental thoughts, involving the love of
a farmer for a patrician of elegance, of
which Cyril Pearl might not approve).
Good as are the “Encyclopaedia”
illustrations, they omit one scene about
which the present reviewer has always
been curious: the “cutty stool,” in
which Burns and other malefactors sat
with the girls they had betrayed, while
the parson lectured them before the
congregation. This omission is, of
course, corrected in Cyril Pearl’s book,
with a full-page plate of the “Stool of
Repentance,” by David Allan. The
criminal is shown standing alone by
the stool in this picture, however, while
the betrayed maiden, with her baby
and, presumably, her mother, are
accommodated below it on the floor of
the church. This is the exact opposite
of what happened at Burns’s first
appearance as a seducer. According to
Lindsay’s entry under “Auld, Reverend
William (1709-91),” Auld for some
reason would not let Burns stand with
Jean in “the place of repentance” but
made him stand in his own pew; maybe
this helped to preserve the certain
amount of respect Burns retained for
Auld. He visited upon poor William
Fisher, as “Holy Willie,” “the greatest
satire ever written in the Scots or
English tongues,” although Auld seems
to have been more responsible for the
arraignment of Burns’s friend Gavin
Hamilton that produced “Holy Willie’s
Prayer” than was Fisher. Fisher
became a tippler and froze to death
in a ditch . . .
The “Encyclopaedia” throws no light
on a line that always intrigued the
reviewer, the peak of that brilliant
progression of farcical horrors in “Tam
’o Shanter” —“Where Murdo’s mither
hanged hersel’ ”... There are only
two references to that poem in the
whole book, and both purely incidental.
Nevertheless, what is there provides
plenty of interest, either as bedside-
or reference-book.

News from the South
The two questions to be asked about
any Antarctic book now that the terri-
tory has been so much written about
are, has it anything new to say, and
has it anything on the latest develop-
ment of mechanised exploration which,
if it is the end of the heroic age down
South, is still a thing we must know.
Jack Bursey’s Antarctic Night
(Longmans) has nothing sensationally
new to offer, but there are bits and
pieces. A Newfoundlander who
served under Byrd, Bursey has spent
three winters on the ice. He says that
he has been chased in the night by
boxes and tractors which seemed to
be coming towards him, and that is
certainly something fresh: —
The milky refraction of the day’s
last dim light blinds the eyes as it
filters through the gathering dark-
ness. The ridges of snow all look
alike. Objects stand out like black
monsters. A tractor, or a box not
yet covered with drifting snow,
looms out like a thing moving
towards you. Not able to identify
it, a feeling of dread sweeps over
you and you suddenly shiver with
fright.... A momentary sense-
less panic adds speed to your feet.
You run for dear life, not looking
back in fear of seeing the Thing that
is following... .Oh, yes, it is like
this. It has happened to me, and
I have seen it happen to others.
There are some other odd things he
has seen happen when the long night
really set in. He felt “the vast desola-
tion all around” squeezing in upon him
to meet “the isolation within,” “the
one causing pain and the other a sense
of depression verging on panics In
the hut he took a bucket to the coalbin
to stoke the fire, but when he tried to
fill it he found the bucket was a chair.
He saw two men at the one meal turn
their plates wrong-side-up to put their
steak and gravy on, so that the gravy
ran straight off again. One of his com-
panions (like Oates, only with no good
reason for it) walked off into a night
of blizzard and turned up again next
day, a most ghastly apparition:—
We saw the door slowly opening,
and a man stood there with only his
eyes showing through the parka that
was drawn closely around his face.
For a full minute no one moved.
And no one uttered a sound as this
ghostly figure slowly made his way
towards the now empty bunk.
Everyone seemed afraid to touch
him.... When he could speak he
told us that he had kept walking as
long as he could and then he had dug
a hole in the snow to sleep.
Bursey has, too, a few revealing
notes on how cold it could be: a husky
got firmly frozen-in by its tail; their
flashlights would freeze; and so,
putting out the lights, would the kero-
sene in their lanterns. And on the
lighter side —it is by no means a grim
book there are such simple
pleasantries as the time the night-
watchman told them, for a joke, that

the piece of the Barrier on which they
were camping had broken off and was
heading out to sea; and the time they
poured snow over the man who was
taking a hot bath.
Bursey has been primarily a dog-
man, driver of a team of huskies, and
his own greatest feat was a long march
in 1940 to plant the U.S. flag in the
Hal Flood mountains —the longest
Antarctic journey ever made with dogs,
except for Amundsen’s dash to the
Pole. He notes with a somewhat dis-
approving eye, on his last journey
South with Operation Deep Freeze in
1955-57, the arrival of mechanisation
and comparative comfort: the lurching
Sno-cats and Weasels; the track-rations
of steak, eggs, hams, oatmeal, bacon,
beans, bread, fruit-juices and fruit that
replaced the old abominable pemmi-
can; the hot baths, the two electric
washing machines, the stacks of mail
coming in by plane—one man got, in
one heap after eight months, 500 letters
from his wife ... it’s a wonder he didn’t
decide to stay down there for ever. But
at the same time he makes it clear that
the Antarctic is still no picnic: two men
were killed when their tractors plunged
into crevasses; the pilot and three
others were killed when a plane coming
in from New Zealand tried to land in
McMurdo Bay.

Dancing Is My Life: Victor Silvester
(Heinemann). Autobiography of the
ballroom-dancer and band-leader, the
sales of whose records are said to
exceed those of any other orchestra in
the world. After serving in World War
I he was a cadet at Sandhurst when,
with natural concern as to how his
father, the vicar, would react, he
decided to switch to a career of dancing
and music. It makes a lively show-
business story, leading to the estab-
lishment of a world-wide chain of
dance-studios in co-operation with the
Rank Organisation—“Ultimately over
200 studios were invisaged, and the
Ranks were prepared to invest a
million pounds in the venture.”

episode when, in 1877, the Turks held
the “sleepy, smelly, utterly dull little
