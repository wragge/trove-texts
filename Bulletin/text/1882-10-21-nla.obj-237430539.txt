SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1882.
Jack and his Selecting Offspring.
If Frankenstein's Monster, on coming of age,
had waited upon his creator to pay his respects,
and had been welcomed with a fire-stick, the
situation would have been something like what
happened at the “ Lands ” on the afternoon of
Thursday week. Sir John’s political progeny
had just reached legal majority. It was exactly
twenty-one years since the Assembly gave birth to
that portentous measure which calls him Sire;
that law, which, it is said, might have been
cradled in Bedlam, and nursed by the Furies. As
the ominous child approached maturity, a growing
agrarian tribulation vexed the land. Discord,
perjury, debt, drought, and muddle had scored
deep lines in the fair face of Australia s eldest
daughter. It needed the fumes of all the bad
champagne drunk at Ministerial banquets to make
people believe in the gorgeous phantasmagoria of
wealth conjured up by Watson's finance, or in
our immense pastoral and mineral resources, as
lucidly disclosed by the matured experience of
Eenwick. With the vernal equinox, there came
a critical point in the progress of the universe
Sir Henry’s inside felt much better ; the comet
was blazing in the morning sky; Arabi was safe
in the “logs;” and Mort’s men were yet on
strike; while the first and last light that ever
was shed on the Department of Mines illuminated
the Occupation Branch by the burning of the
Records. Then it came to pass that some advo-
cates of Land-Reform, representing various
bodies, met in Sydney to see what could be done.
* m m
These delegates were from all parts of the
colony, though chiefly from the South. One was
a squatter. Moat of the remainder represented
freo-seleotora’ associations. It was evident that a
considerable diversity of view existed among them
from the! first. Some few, perhaps one-third of
the whole, were conscious that the interests of
humanity were not absolutely bound up in free-
selection. The remainder, so far as they could
formulate their opinions, believed that there was
no God but “ the poor man,” and that
Jack was his prophet. To smite the
monopolist and the swell to slay and
spare not —was their shibboleth, for they had
sucked in with their mothers’ milk the first princi-
ple of Australian agriculture, “ Down with the
■ ■ ■ — squatter!” Though the proceedings of the
Conference were wonderfully harmonious at first,
yet opinion swayed to and fro. The chairman
aimed at guiding the delegates along the path of
reason, and he kept them in good humour. At
length, on the Wednesday, a resolution was
carried in condemnation of the principle of indis-
criminate selection, while a motion denouncing
“ fixity of tenure” was vetoed. The minority had
at length succeeded in inducing the majority to
admit that peace and security were better things
than war and chaos. But, this victory of common-
sense was short-lived. That great agricultural
authority, Mr. Heydon, who, it is said, does know
the difference between a ram and a heifer, heard
that the vested interests of litigation and discord
were in peril, and he came down upon them like
another Sennacherib. When the majority
heard again the war-whoop of 1861 in those well-
known tones, they recovered their habitual temper.
No one could withstand the time-honoured cry
when lips so eloquent hounded them on their
“ enemies,” and they forthwith determined to
knock down everything three inches high outside
the sacred pale of tree-selection. Their loader,
with fervid oratory, showed them the true path to
the poor man’s paradise, where the reign of the
agricultural saint was to endure for ages, and no
squatter should ever enter.
• • •
With the majority in this blessed spirit, the
delegates took their manifesto to the Department,
and there they were talked to “ straight.” They
had shaken from their souls the heresy that
prompted them to make peace with the squatter ;
they had returned with fresh zest to the good old
gospel according to Sir John, of “cnt-throat”
selection; and surely they deserved the kiss of
fatherly welcome. But, he must be wary who
enters into the lion’s den. When the Minister
saw them, he raised his arm with eldritch gesture,
and pointed at them the finger of menace and
rebuke ; then he treated them to the rough side of
his tongue, and no mistake. In vain, their chosen
spokesman turned his cheek to the smiter. The
father of free-seleotion roared him down, and
snubbed him smart.
* • •
The poor Monster was abashed. He wanted
nothing but to fulfil the duty for which he was
brought into life, and now his Parent was rating
and vilifying him as if there was any harm in
strangling squatters and jumping on the general
public! s’o, his tail went between his legs ; his
ears drooped. He thanked the Minister humbly,
took his kicking meekly, and went his way back
to spread the sad news of the Paternal Apoatacy
over the muddy waterholes and grasslesa plains of
Seleotordom.
• « •
There is no mistake about Sir John's pluck,
but how about his consistency ? Did he not him-
self establish the principle tUat “ the settlement
of the lands ” was to be conducted by setting one
faction at the throat of another; and if it was a
good deed to hound out or black-mail a squatter
in 1861, wherein lay the guilt of proposing to
trample down that obnoxious class in 1832? The
answer of the Minister to this question is that he
has never acted in a hostile spirit to any class ;
that he has always acted fairly to both parties, to
the squatters as well as the selectors ; that he has
ever held the balance of justice between the two
[ factions. It is difficult to see, at once, how such
terms as fair-dealing and justice can have any
connection with a policy that has always prompted
encroachment and eneouraged internecine strife
that maintains throughout the country two-thirds
of the conditions of a civil war. These terms, in
their common-sense meaning, might bo properly
applied to a law which provided a peaceful field
for both interests to carry on their work, but such
a policy is directly opposed to the spirit of
the existing Act, and it was this very suggestion
that sent Mr. Heydon flying to the rescue, es if
his craft were in danger, or as if “ the Volsoians
were over the wall.” So, Sir John’s meaning of
“ fair play ” and “ holding the scales even ” can-
not be interpreted in any ordinary judicial or
legislative sense. But, if we step into the
prize-ring, we find at once the key to the
Minister's mind. He finds himself in the posi-
ti°n of a bottle-holder, or rather of an umpire
at a fair fight. The squatter has ths Und—the
selector, if he ia man enough, is to take it from
“? m - The squatter is to show fight and protect
mmaelf if he can, and there are plenty of weapons
to be got if ho likes to buy them. The tomahawk-
slash of conditional purchase can be requitsd by
the rapier-thrust of the volunteer land-order. An
advance on a frontage or a dam may be changed
to a retreat by a volley of Improvement Purchases
or a big Reserve. For the hundreds of mutual
wrongs not provided for, though prompted by the
Act, which the combatants may inflict on each
other, there is the Supreme Court with the peace-
ful chambers of .Equity in the rear. So, according
to the Minister, what would you have more?
Everything is provided for a fair fight, and the
best man, or perhaps the longest purse at times,
wins. There is little doubt that this is the line of
thought followed, perhaos unconsciously by Sir
John Robertson. His perfect indifference to
the consequences of his law as affecting either
the industries of the colony or the social welfare
of the people, has been proved times without
number. The disregard with which he meets all
remarks as to the effects of his law on squatting
farming or the growing wants of the population’
show that he is perfectly unconscious of ali
economic principles. When the strange phono-
menon presented by the late Census, disclosing
the fact that only some 18 per cent, of the decen-
( nial increase was to be found outside of our towns
and villages, was pointed out to him, all he
remarked was—“Caa’t people live where they
like? A statement of such moment would have
riveted the attention of any man who had the
slightest inkling of economic science ; but to the
Minister for Lands it appears to have as little
meaning or import as a Choral Service or the
Spring Handicap.
* * *
The experience of the last twenty years has
shown plainly—so that he who runs may read—
tkat the territory ®f New South Wales is not a
trust to be administered on the same principle
that a fair fight ” would be conducted. There
is no wonder that, under a policy based on this
principle, class hatred has deepened; confusion
has become worse confounded; both social and
businres rectitude have been tarnished ; all indus-
tries have been dead locked ; two-thirds of the
country remains waste; and four-fifths of the
people are turning their backs on up-country life,
the real work of colonisation, —and, from abso-
lute necessity, are seeking taeir livelihod in
towns.
In spite of the rather eccentric wind-np of the
Conference, the work of the delegates has not
been wasted. The element of good sense and
moderation which it contained, though outvoted,
will meet with much friendly recognition through
the colony. It will elicit a good deal of sympathetic
reeling among townspeople and others, not con-
nected directly with either of the two landed
interests, but who are painfully conscious of the
agrarian incubus under which the colony suffers •
and it may not unlikely lead to an exchange of
views between the outposts of the two Armies.
Ine right settlement ©f the land question ia of
supreme consequence to every man in New South
Wales besides squatters and selectors. To all
who have earnings to lay out and children to
settle in life, and equally to those who have the
worid before them with nothing but their heads
and hands, the great problem is in like measure
important. A general scramble, aggravated hv
every circumstance that can be generated from
taction, fraud, intimidation, and revenge, has
been instituted by legislation, and has yielded
an appropriate crop of failure and abuse. Perhaps
those who may take up the question now will see
that peace, order, and harmony are the best
principles to encourage honest industry, and to
mnff\ Pe ° together \ and that every interest ia
most benefited by that law which will provide
the greatest security for all.
* • »
A very mischievous feature in the law which we
hope soon to speak of as the past, ia that, techni-
cal‘y. Provisions have invariably been ill-framed
and badly expressed. The ambiguities contained
m it from first to last have invelved endless
matters in doubt. Litigation on points where no
collision of interests should have arisen, and
constant references for Ministerial decision, have
marked its course. In reality, in many essential
sections, the law is too vague to be considered
iaw. It is liable to be interpreted and misinter-
preted in a dozen different ways, in accordance at
one time with political prejudices, and following
on other occasions, merp Ministerial caprice. This
however, is pist what might be expected as part
of a policy framed to keep no a “fair fight,” and
it is unquestionably profitable to politicians and
many more.
• • •
Sir John, we think, may now retire on his
laurels. His meeting with, and dispersion of, the
Conference may appropriately inaugurate the
fitting apotheosis to succeed a heroic life. Under
the pines of his Tusculum at Watson’s Bay. we
hope he will foe many a day fight his battles over
again, and recount, for the good of the rising
generation how he faced the delegates and talked
to tnem straight.’ *
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Goulburn Lynching and the Rich-
mond River Insurrection!
The other day The Field printed an article about “the
Australian land system." in which, by dealing with the
land affairs of Victoria aleue, it gave its readers the
impression that Victoria was Australia. Such gross
ignorance on the part of so influential a paper is utterly
unaccountable and inexcusable; but, placed beside our
own dear Sydney Daily Twaddlegraph, The Field is
deserving of absolute admiration. In the D.T. of the
other day appeared a telegram from Goulburn relative
to the case of Mrs. Vosper, whom her husband had
tomahawked. “It is believed," says the King-street
classic, “that if he (Vosper) falls (sic) into the hands
of the citizens he will be lynched without ceremony »
Sheer bunkum this, of course; for no man ever was
lynched in Australia—though there have been and still
are many people whom lynching would considerably
improve. We Australians either possess less self,
reliance than the stern chieftains of the famed
Californian Vigilance Committee, or else we have
more confidence in the just and sufficient opera-
tion of the laws of our country. Immediately below
the hysterical telegram from which we have just
quoted, the D.T. prints another most wonderful wire
labelled. “ Alarm of Starvation in the Eichmond Eiver
district," which, after stating that “fears are enter-
tamed that unless a dredge is (sic) sent the population
numbering 17,000 souls, will be in a state of starvation’
as there IS only a fortnight’s supply t f rations in the
district," goes on to ray that “ the residents are very
indignant at the neglect of their claims, and threats of
Boycotting the Government until something is done
by refusing to pay any more money on land, Ac are
freely mentioned.” Thus, dear public, while we have
a lynching riot on down South, the Northern districts
are in open revolt. The Goulburn lynching and the
Richmond Eiver insurrection, in fact. Yet, who ever
heard about such things except in the columns of the
D.T. ? We are an order-loving and by no means blood-
thirsty community. Yet, should a copy of the King,
street rag ever reach England, those who may be so
unhappy as to read it when it comes from the butcher

Sir —I have the honour to convey to you by direction
of this Council its warmest thanks.for the gratuitous
and successful treatment of several cases of deafness
recommended to you by them, and especially for the
remarkable cure of George Hunt, of Eveleigh-street,
recently treated by you on their recommendation, after
being assured by other medical men that his case was
hopeless, as the malady was chronic. This the Council
thinks is especially noteworthy; as Hunt states in his
letter, that he was relieved by your first operation in
10 minutes, and he bad been suffering for three years
previously. The poor fellow expresses his deep grati-
tude to yon.
Alderman Smith, who introduced him, hears willing
testimony to the efficacy of his cure.
Be pleaded to use this as you think fit, as the council’s
estimate of your worth.
P. Hogan, Mayor.
I have had several attacks of sore throat for some
time but the last one was of such a serious nature
that I consulted Dr. Stanich some twelve months ago.
I am happy to say that Dr. Stanich effected a perfect
cure, and I have never since experienced the slightest
inconvenience.

The Benevolent Asylum-and its Board.
The queer disclosures lately made, through. Mr. Pen-
fold’s action, as to the financing of the Directors of
the Benevolent Asylum, are just sufficient to make us
ask for more light upon the same subject. We find that
this body, already having on deposit a very large sum,
the proceeds of a careful saving for years, is yet too
niggardly to give an adequate help to those persons
whom, as commonly happens, the neglect of their
natural guardians leaves destitute. What can be the
object of the Board in keeping this large sum at their
disposal, in collecting fresh subscriptions, and taking
the Government endowment, and, instead of applying
the money to the relief of the necessitous, carefully
increasing their bank balance ? The example of the
Sydney Infirmary, and of the Missenden-road Hospital,
tells us why this is done. The Board of Directors of
the Asylum have resolved to build a palace for the hous-
ing of beggars and fallen women mostly. The modus
operandi, as the Police Court reporters would put it, is
thus: You get a few thousands in cash or promises;
you go to the Government for the pound-for-pound
assistance, and get it; you either inveigle the Govern-
ment into giving you a piece of land, or you get it by
begging or purchase; invite the Governor to lay the
foundation, build, and there you arel Your
scheme is a charge upon the revenue of the colony.
This is the way the present Sydney Hospital has been
secured ; thus, too, the Missenden-road Hospital; thus
the Captain Cook Statue ; thus the late Garden Palace;
thus every truly national project ends taken up with
enthusiasm, dropped slowly into the arms of a rich and
gracious Government. Is it felt through the colony
that this process comes just to the same thing in the
end, except that when the public carry a thing to a
conclusion by their own efforts, the expense falls upon
a more limited class than in the other case ? If it is
not, it should be. It means that the people out of their
earnings, out of the profits of their labours, bear the
expense of clothing, educating, and upbringing the
children of those wretches who fail in the most sacred
human duty ; and, further, that they devote a moiety
of the same earnings to the building of palaces to feed
the inordinate vanity of a parcel of shopkeepers, tuft
hunters, and nobodies.
The Writer and the Player.
In his occasional notes, Mr. Archibald Forbes thus
xites concerning his stay in Launceston, Tasmania
Now, I had not provided myself with any letters of
itroduction. In Australia, I had found these super-
nous. Courteous tenders of hospitalities, honorary
dmissions to clubs, kindly offers, embarrassing in
heir variety audjbreadth.had everywhere either awaited
ay arrival or been forwarded in anticipation. Mr.
roRBES proceeds to tell his sufferings, and ends with an
dmission of better treatment. Now, to anyone reading
>etween the lines wherein the writer feigns to make
>port of his dulness, the meaning comes out. Mr.
6’obbes is piqued 1 Rem ecu tetigit, according to his
>wn Horatian phrase. Now, it happened that, some
ive years ago, another distinguished man came from
Britain to these Southern shores. This man was an
ictor, William Creswick his name. He had not con-
sorted with Generals, Sovereigns, and what-nots; he
bad no stars or orders pinned to his dress coat; he was,
as we say, a play-actor. He played in the legitimate
drama. He was received in the most frigid manner.
Dr. Moorhousb disgusted his flock by inviting Mr.
Creswick to his palace to read Shakespeare. But Mr.
Creswick won his way to a better appreciation. On
the eve of quitting these lands for his Northern home,
at a banquet given in Sydney, Mr. Creswick, in the
most faultlesslyldelicate and suggestive way, thanked
us for our broad and generous i eception of him. And
yet we had only gone to hear and see this gentleman at
the theatre. Well, as far as money goes, Mr. Forbes
will have the better lined purse, but, who will set Mr
Ceeswick’s lago, his Lear, his Jew, his incomparable
Sir John Falstaff, against “ Warriors I Have Met,"
and the “ Inner Life of a War Correspondent ?” More
things in this world than kissing go by favour, and it is
sometimes better to have known a somebody than to be
a somebody. But, if what we have done with Mr.
Forbes be fitting, what should we do for the men who
did what he has talked about, if they made us a visit?
But here is a motto from Mr. Forbes’ favourite,
slightly altered to suit;
“ Nil desperandum, auro dues.”
The C.D. Bill.
The Eev, J. C. Kirby wants to throttle harlotry in his
own style. Being a clergyman, he is presumed by the
Herald to have a sort of Divine inspiration upon this
indelicate topic, though most individuals would think
that clergymen knew less about men and women than
any other class—except, perhaps, men who have all
their lives been schoolmasters, Mr, Kirby s inner
light on the subject has shown him that all “ State
intervention actually aggravates venereal diseases,"
and that a Contagious Diseases Act is somehow or
other a hideous mistake. Mr. Kirby would attack the
avil in quite a different way. His plan, besides aiming
at some modifications respecting the age of consent,
teems with a few clergymanic novelties. The end in
view is to “ lift the immediately future generations to
a loftier plane of life.” To achieve this, “ fathers of
illegitimate children are to be made to bear the full
duties and responsibilities of parents, in the same way
and degree that husbands are ” —or, in other words (let
us use the argument of which he avails himself when
it suits him), the sanctity of the institution of marriage
is to be profaned. In reviewing the Kirby pamphlet,
the S.M. Herald smugly observes: “The idea which
Mr. Kirby deems of vital importance—it being his
own (I) —is the establishment of a sort of Moral Board,
composed partly of ladies ( Oh!), to be appointed by
the Governor, whose honorary duties should be to act
as guardians of all orphans under 21, to prosecute
seducers, keep the police up to the mark (! I),
and direct the treatment of infected persons in proper
hospitals.” (1!!) This Moral Board of clergymen and
ladies will have a nice variety of occupations. Besides
being foster-parents of all orphans under 21, they will
poke their noses into every stink-pot, hunt down the
“ masher,” ventilate every scandal that rumour bruits
about the country, egg on the police to “ wholesome
fun,” and pronounce upon the latest recipes for the
treatment of syphilis. Could a queerer farrago than
this have bean compounded? Yet the Herald looks
upon this nauseous dish with a smile of sweet approval,
and says that Mr. Kirby “ has summarised the result
of his experience, research, and reflection in an able
and judicious manner,” The rest of Mr. Kiebt s
scheme is to be carried out by the extension of female
refuges, “ and the dissemination of social-purity prin-
ciples by means of meetings and pledges. These
Social Parity Societies will, it is to be presumed, have
their total and partial abstainers. A repentant haybag
will swear off for a month, a quarter or a year, accord-
ing to the strength of her sorrow, the virulence of her
disease, and the activity of the ladies and clergymen of
the Moral Board. “ Meetings and pledges” wall pro-
bably include “lodges” and “ choir-practice,” and the
community will become thoroughly moral. Prostitution
is a world-old evil, and was ancient enough even when
the old patriarch Jacob parted with his signet ring and
other trifles. Experience has shown that it cannot be
suppressed. The object of the Contagious Disease
Bill is to minimise its evil results—to quench its fata
fires. Yet these benevolent clergymen won’t have any-
thing to do with that Bill, but want to rule society by
ladies’ committees and moral boards. A partisan of the
Social Parity movement, signing himself “ Citizen,
has also written to the Herald, and quotes a report
about the Hongkong social evil and the result of a Con-
tagious Diseases Act there. Because a Hongkong bobby
“disguised himself by means of false whiskers, took
some marked dollars, and went out to entrap a Chinese
woman into wrong doing,” the whole law is unreser-
vedly condemned. It would be just as reasonable to
sweepingly wipe out all our Licensing laws, because a
police nan had entrapped an unwary publican into
breaking the Sunday clause. The Medical Association
of N.S. Wales is in favour of the Contagious Diseases
BiU, 'and, in such a matter as this, we prefer the judg-
ment of scientists and men of the world to that of

Resurrection Difficulties at Wollongong.
On page 8, we illustrate the state of things
which exists at Wollongong cemetery. We
see in the foreground of the picture t e
remains of Michael O’Doolan. lying for-
ninst those of Bridget O’Lafherty-a per;

his life, except—and the Board be betune us and

noble bust of Billy M‘Grath, is to seenjhe
scan-mag anatomy of lying p h ll tne
rascal who ooorted the aforesaid Billy s sister
until he got a friendly tap on the head. Al l
among the beautiful bones are the remains of
dead cattle—most of them owned by
The two skulls to be seen winking at what remains

a mystery to us. At the first blast, M‘Cool if
true to his instincts, will be up at dawn.making

Baptist Minister will, no doubt be hurried away
to Purgatory with the shank bone of Billy
M'Grath, for the whole of whose remains ten
masses have been said—and paid for. Whj iua

his anatomy is enjoying potheen is more than we
can explain. A greater injustice stall

sponsible for all this.

mix on the Last Day?-we must say we do not
It is very improbable that Wollongong will hear
the trumpet. It is too near Kiama. Besides, the
Archangel will have quite enough to do to watch
the religious crowd in the Sydney graveyards. An
organized attempt, we are credibly informed, will
be made to pass in on the “Ten Tribes of Israel
Ticket.”
Dr, Williamson, who resigned the surgeoncy of
H.M.S. Emerald two years ago with the intention of
settling in the colony, and who hasi since held.the
appointment of resident physician and to the
Sydney Infirmary, and more lately that of acting-
medical superintendent of Qladesville is.now about to
practise at North Shore,
Now that the bottom has fallen out of the
Arahl trouble, the chief item of interest during the
week has been the press shooting match, it was a
magnificent display of skill, and the winimr, Mr. r. U.
Trebeck, a distinguished “ journalist, who, it seems
is editor ef a humorous publication dealing exclusively
with hides and tallow, is to be sincerely congratulated
upon his success. We see that a protest has been en-
tered against him. They want to make out that Mr. P.
C. T. is not eligible. This is mean. Mr. Trebeck has,
evidently sufficient money to run a paper—if not to
write one. Therefore, he is a pressman. Wo have seen
the Pastoral Circular. It is full of poetry; but then
it is not so full of poetry as the Evening News. Still
we consider that Mr. T.’s melting descriptions of
“washed" and greasy; bis ryhthmic perorations upen
store cattle and fat; his glowing apotheoses of stud
thoep. not only constitute him eligible for the member-
ship of the press, but for a niche in the mausoleum of
our most cherished poets. The sport was splendid.
The scribes had seven shots each, with Caswells
musket, and 25 (!) points was the boss score [mij A
slight hitch occurred, we believe, in the proceedings
prior to the match, because a man who lived near, came
up and asked the journalists not to devastate his family
(who lived in the South Head Road), or to bring his
goat to an untimely end. Hardly was the matter satis-
factorily settled than it was discovered that no one knew
how to load Caswell’s weapon, and matters became more
complicated when the fact became patent that some-
body had abstracted the flint. Jim Hogue, the News
sub-editor, however, was equal to the occasion. Smiling
a sardonic smile, he went behind a fruit-barrow, and
loaded the old “ Brown Bess ” by first ramming down
the ball, and afterwards fixing in a quarter of a pound of
powder. Then priming the pan with a perfect Cuy
Fawkes train of gunpowder, it was arranged that the
competitor should take aim, while the person he selected
should fire off the gun with a match at a given signal.
A, O. Jackson came first; and when his weapon had
been heated red-hot with a torch, it went oil, and the
ball lodged with great accuracy in the roof of a cow-shed
at Randwiok —tho concussion landing Mr. Jackson on a
heap of cordials, much to the discomfiture of caterers.
Davies came next; but this time it would not go ofi at
all At length, Jack Conway built a fire under it; and,
after half an hour or so, it again exploded—this time
without apparent effect. The owner of the gun put,in
a protest. The varnish, he said, was all frizzling on the
stock, and tho man who had taken the flint was no
gentleman. It was then discovered that Mr. J. had
rammed a cartridge bullet end down Caswell s musket,
and that when the thing went ofi it had sent the shot
right through the fly of the refreshment tent at tlie back
of him. Jim Hogue was the next knight of the trigger
to come forward ; and. having tor safety’s sake, rammed
down half a Town and Country Journal by way of
wadding, he drew a bream-line sinker from his pocket,
and inserted that also He was then about to fire, when
the spectators objected. They wished, they said, time
to say their prayers before they died. 80, complying
with the general demand for safety, James poured a
glasd of beer down the barrel of the maskefc, ana the
rest of the match was shot off with a horse-pistol
borrowed from a blacksmith, with the brilliant result
we have recorded.

ONE OP THE WOBLD’S GEEATEST
OARSMEN.
TN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
** I have found St. JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by over-ex-
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.**
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB'S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

The immediate effect of Moore’s Electric Bath is
more wonderful than Moore’s Household Remedy Oint-
ment, which removes all pain from a bum or scald in
three to 15 minutes. It is the enly ointment that has
certificates of merit from the managers of all the
foundries in Sydney. It acts magically in wounds,
braises, sores, snn-bnrns, corns, bunions, and has a
curative effect on lung complaints, when rubbed into
the chest. Every Householder should keep a pot.
There should be a po » kept in every house, even if
the house is empty, it willdo for the next tenant.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Hanley Bennett, we read, “has resigned his
position as alderman ” —of Tam worth.
Mr. Alexander Farthing, the well-known min-
ing man, is now in our old quarters—the debtors’ ward
of Darlinghurst Gaol, for “ contempt of court ’’-because
he can’t pay ££ooo. Just think of a farthing with
£5OOO liability on it 1 Why, it’s actually worse than our
farthing and costs.
At a city theatre, on the occasion of a recent
benefit, a well-known financier excited the admiration
of the house by gravely and solemnly kissing all the
ladies in his box, and then taking an affecting leave of
the gentlemen of the party, who were seemingly much
moved by the lugubriousness of the departing one. All
this in full view of the house, and during the rendition
of a solo.
Miss Southon, the Melbourne barmaid who
caused the recent small-pox scare, has now completely
recovered. If sh# really has had variola, which very
few believe, the attack must have been but a mild one.
It is true she is slightly pitted, but the marks, which
are almost undiscernable, are vanishing day by day.
Her family have taken the Junction Hotel, bt. Kilda,
where she is at present—on view.
Prince Albert Victor has deserted the Navy, and
will see glory fiercely fighting side by side with his in-
trepid uncle. Arthur, in the Army. George is to remain
a sailor. S>, therefore, any anxiety which one may
have had about the future of England, as a maritime
power, is dispelled. The Princes played a cricket-
match, “ Bacchante” against the Eoyal Yacht, the other
day, and while fielding at cover-point, George much
amused those about him by bewailing the absence of E.
B. Smith’s umbrella.
Several persons will hear with regret that Lotti
Wilmott has not yet gone to Heaven. She has pub-
lished another “ work ” (this time about her experience
of New Zealand Beds), in whioh the villain seems to
pursue her more vindictively than ever. The NZ.
papers advise the persecuted heroine to write another
book and die, but we wouldn’t be so rude as that.
What we would advise, however, is not worth while
setting down, for it is millions to one she wouldn’t
follow it.
W. C. O’Farrell, son of the gentleman who
attempted the life of Archbishop Goold, and nephew of
the would-be assassin of Prince Alfred, has been arrested
at Sale, Victoria, as a dangerous lunatic, and committed
to Kow asylum. A bloedy mania seems te run through
the family. This sprig of the tree wanted to cut his
throat. Will Sir 'Enry Parkes, the man who does not
believe in capital punishment, cut this out, and stick it
in his hat or on the door of the cell at Darlinghurst
behind which he “ planted ” his stenographic satellite ?
At Parramatta, on Friday week, the Mayor, in
presence of a large assemblage, presented to the
daughter of Dr. Taylorl a medal (of the National Ship-
wreck Belief Society of N.S.W., for her conduct in
saving Elsie Tuckwell from drowning on the 11th May.
When the medal was placed on Miss Taylor's breast,
her father spoke her thanks. This is only the second
medal given to a lady. The first was earned by the
wife of the master of the schooner JMoorburg, who
navigated that vessel to port when her nusband and his
crew were all prostrate with disease.
The eldest daughter of the Hon. W. J. Clarke,
the Victorian millionaire, is to marry Lord Dupplin,
eldest son of the Earl of Kinnonl, who sits as Baron
Hay in the House of Lords, and whose title dates from
the year 1633. This auspicious event is creating the
liveliest excitement in fashionable circles in Victoria,
where the best wishes are expressed for the future hap-
piness of the fair fiancee, whose family are so deservedly
popular with all classes of the community. Let ns see.
Lord Dupplin dates back to 1633. The Clarke’s are of
more recent origin ; but W. J. has already £3,000,000,
and owns more than half the Colonial Bank.
Mr. James Carroll, solicitor, is dead—or, rather,
“ Old Carroll, the lawyer," is gone. Everyone knew
his rugged, kindly face ; and as nearly everyone has at
some time or other been ‘‘up’’ at the Central Police
Court, where he chiefly practised, and had to an extent
become intimate with him, nobody ever thought of
calling him “ Mr.” Carroll. He was more convivial in
his manner of dealing with reporters than most prao-
titioners, and so he more frequently got paragraphs
than any other solicitor. Mr. Carroll appeared to be
always happy, and was at all times on the best of terms
with prosecuting policemen. He worked the old-time
Benches admirably, bat his opinion of the great unpaid
generally was hardly fit for publication. Old Jem
has gone—and has left many a duffing attorney behind
him.
Mr. Latham, of the late firm of Latham and
Watson, Sandhurst, has just died in “reduced circum-
stances.” What that means we all know. Mr. J. B.
Watson, his former partner, is the richest mining man
in Australasia. And, by the way, at a recent meet-
ing of the Bendigo Benevolent Asylum, a letter was
read from a Mr. Addy, of Melbourne, who desired to
obtain some information regarding Thomas Hustler, a
man with one arm, who was supposed to be an inmate
of the asylum. The superintendent stated that he was
never an inmate of the asylum, but had died in the
Bendigo Hospital. The Mr. Hustler referred to was
the man who, over a quarter of a century ago, opened
up the Hustler’s line ot reef whioh afterwards became
so famous throughout the world. Fortune deserted
him, and he died in a charitable institution.
Poor Judge Blake is dead at last. He was
once well-known in N.S. W. as a barrister, and a clever
one, and for a time held a District Court Judgeship, In
his later years he was an eccentric old gentleman, who
was chiefly remarkable for his love of butter, and his
ability to eat a pound of it at a meal, —which ability he
constantly exercised on circuit, to the great amazement
of hotelkeepers. It is related of Judge Blake that one
morning, while he was on circuit in the far North, where
water was scarce, the man of all work at the pub. where
he was staying arose early and saw the Judge’s head
atiokingout of the water-butt, which was the sole source
of supply. “Oh 1 yer Honor!” shrieked Tom, who was a
countryman of the Judge’s—“ d’ye know that you’re
washing yerself in the water that we bhoil the kettle
out of ?’’ “Me dear man,” replied the Judge, com-
placently squeezing the water out of his ears—“ it's all
light, I’m using no soap."
Walter Montgomery’s name was really Tomlin-
son, and he was a draper before he became an actor, in
which profession, however, once entered, he mounted
▼ery quickly. He first made a name in London as
Borneo, playing to the Juliet of Madame Stella Colas.
It was in Melbourne he achieved his groat success as
Hamlet, and no performance there, perhaps, caused
more exoitement or notice. He was very intimate with
the Duke of Edinburgh when the Prince was here; he
was very conceited, decidedly plain, a ludicrous horse-
man, but a kindly-hearted man. When be went up-
stairs in the Age office with his valet, to horsewhip the
dramatic critic, he was met by a bigger man than he ex-
pected, so Walter prudently came downstairs again
without doing anything rash. After leaving Melbourne,
he married the divorced wife of a wealthy New York
resident (Miss Moutagne, who was very beautiful), and
s hot himself forty-eight hours afterwards.
The deaths of Mr. James Curtis, the under-
taker, and Mr. E. J. Hollingdale, the equally well-
known King-street jeweller, took place within a few
days of each other, recently. The deceased were the
staunch and indefatigable financial managers of St.
Mary’s Cathedral, took a leading part in the move-
ments following on the two huge conflagrations some
years ago, and saw the great undertaking of a new
edifice through to completion. As already stated, they
died almost simultaneously—strangely enough, imme-
diately after the opening ceremonial of the Cathedral.
It is one of the most remarkable coincidences within
our experience, and a strange satire on what ecclesias-
tics call “ the goodness of Providence,” that two men
who had the respect of the community should have
been joint treasurers of a cathedral fund; that they
should have toiled on at their work for years, and
should have lived only just long enough to see it
accomplished,—that, in raot, their obsequies should
be the very first performed in the edifice they helped to
r«ar.
We can equal Britain now in cricket and rowing,
and may distance her altogether in tho finer issues of
civilization by-and-by; but some of our young wealthy
colonials are already supreme as purse-proud snobs.
Take the instance, as one out of many, where a eon of
a merchant and squatter, who had made all his money
in South Australia, honoured a bank in Old Broad-
street, London, with his presence, in order to change a
cheque. The teller took the cheque, and, as is the wont
of his tribe, pushed the notes across the counter
towards his customer. One of these notes went beyond
the edge and fell on the floor. “ Come round, sir, and
pick up that note—you threw it past me on to the
floor.” “ I shall not do anything of the kind," re-
sponded the teller. “What do you mean? Ton have
not cashed that cheque. I am not going to pick up
notes from the floor." •* Then you shouldn’t let ’em
go there," calmly returned the teller Then the snob
drew himself up to his full height, and bawled : “ Look
here, sir, do you know who I am P Do you know I’ve
got a credit of £30,000 ? Come round instantly, and
pick up that note I ” "I don’t care who you are, or
what you are worth. Ton can just pick up that note
yourself. It you don’t, it will go to tellers’ surplus,
that's all." The notion of probable loss of a whole
pound sterling was too much for the big man. He
stooped and picked the note from the floor, carefully
placed it in his pocket-book, and retired ungracefully
swearing.
Arthur Wellesley Eogers, “ Government clerk,”
of Adelaide, has been astonishing the natives of Smith-
opotis by his insolvency. Wellesley was a young swell
of the first water. His attire was regarded as the model
upon which aspiring young bankrupts should build ; his
cosmetiqued moustache was always faultlessly toned
and trimmed; and his face was ever “ sicklied o’er with
the pale cast of —— " well, yes, “ thought.” How-
ever, Wellesley appears not to have taken any “thought"
for the morrow, for he has just gone bung thuswise —
“ Liabilities, £B9B 5s ; assets, £23 13s. 8i " He counts
back to January, 1881, when he says that he “ owed
about £7O. and had no property,”—a position which
naturally fitted him for the sphere he chose for himself,
viz., share-dealing. Ho bought a house somehow, and
sold it similarly. Then he took a trip to Sydney at a
cost of £5O, and invested in a cargo of emu-eggs at a
ruinous loss. Ha attributes his insolvency to these and
share losses, but the accountant’s verdict was the
straight grifHu: “ Speculating, without having means
to pay losses.” The Commissioner of Insolvency hinted
that had the opposing creditors made a penal charge,
Wellesley would probably now be dealing in the blue
diamond line, or concentrating his faculties on the
oakum business. As it is, he is to be allowed to retain
£2OO eut of his next year’s salary—the S. A. Government
isn’t squeamish as to its civil service—and the odd £6O
is to go to the creditors, when the lawyers have suffi-
ciently worried the intestines out of the estate. Shades
of Vaughan’s mansion 1 |By the way, Fred. Harvie Link-
later, a special friend of Sogers, has busted too.
Major Fahey, of the N.S. W. Volunteer Artillery,
died rather unexpectedly on Friday, and was buried on
Sunday. He was an unsoldierlike, genial, liberal little
fellow—a military money-lender, with gentlemanly in-
stincts. Which is another way of saying that he never
looked for interest, and seldom had the principal re-
turned to him. He could handle field artillery at
least as well as most men in our Volunteer service,
though on parade days he used to trill the “r"
with a little too much of the national ring. By
the way, now that the gallant little captain is
gone, what is to become of the two hundred armed
Fenians he was charged twelve years ago with drilling
behind the Victoria Barracks ? Where is the heap of
official evidence given by dogs who sought to strip him
of his uniform, and without the shadow of reason— as
was subsequently proved—convict him of being a
military traitor ? Where is the gallant officer whom
Fahey indignantly struck across the chest with his
sword and challenged to a duel ? Fahey’s private con.
versations re this most disgraceful “enquiry” con-
veyed the impression that he was intended to be the
victim of a villainous conspiracv. All this oecurred at
the time of the Kiama Ghost affair, when the mob was
duped by a designing political schemer. Fahey sur-
vived the charges, and his remains were, last Sunday,
seen into the grave by some of the best men in the ser-
vice. It may be an unpleasant fact—but still it is a
fact—that Fahey thought that meanness was the soul
of loeal military etiquette. A standing joke with him
was : “ His charger followed him to the grave I Why,
darn it, I lent him ten bob, the|other day, to hire the
horse from Who’s-this.” The deceased Major was
thoroughly well-liked, loft a good deal of honourably,
acquired money, and was buried a Protestant.

Sir Richard Emmanuel Moore, tenth baronet of
Boss Carbery, Cork, has just died in poverty at the ago
of 71. At one period of his life he held the post of
third-class turnkey at Spike Island; at another he was
selling, from door to door, copies of a book written by
his wife ; lastly he tried to sell coal, but failed to make
it pay. Poor devil I Mr. W. Carson, of the San
Francisco Bulletin, arrived here by the last mail-boat.

It isn’t polite to take home your old tooth-
stump after the dentist has jerked it out. Extracted
teeth are, properly, the dentist’s perks. They bring
several pounds a ton, the dust from tooth-bone being
superior to that of other bones. It is used for ferti-
lizing And how nice it is to have your wife’s
teeth turned into fragrance of roses I Even a man’s
mother-in-law can be utilized through the dentist, and
be made to gladden the life of her son with her bloom.
Sonny, whose ideas are rudimentary, but who
gives everything a name, was having his usual romp
with mamma just before bed-time. Mamma, in the happy
unpoliteness of the moment, put her tongue out at full

The Contagious Diseases’ Aot is to be brought
into operation in Auckland, All the goody-goody sec-
tion are up in arms. The clergy deputationised the
Mayor, who snubbed them.
Jerilderie, a few months since, had ten public-
houses ; now, it has but two. Curses, not loud, but
deep, are directed against Parkes and the Licensing
Act. Wallbundry township, which recently had seven
pubs., has now only one.
Robert Powell hanged himself at Plymouth,
N.Z. The brutal old English coronial law is still in force
in N.Z., and the jury returned a verdict of fdo de se. The
Coroner ordered the body to be interred between the
hours of nine and twelve at night.
Christina Jansen, a brazen-faced girl of 16, was
recently brought before the Wellington (N.Z.) Court
on the charge of killing an infant. The circumstances
of the case were of a shocking nature. The father of
of the child was own brother to the mother.
The Chinese tobacco-growers of Tumut are
bolding out for bigger prices. Some buyers recently
offered 6d., but the celestials, who have about 200 tons
on hand, require from 7d. to Bd. per lb. Last year the
plantations about Tumut turned out about 180 tons.
The cultivation of the weed is, therefore, progressing.
A remarkable song is sung in the Kelly country.
It contains about fifty verses, detailing the daring deeds
of the Kelly gang, the burden being a sort of lament
for the defunct Ned. It marvellously resembles the
Dublin street-ballads in '9B, being an amusing grotes-
querie in rhyme, rhythm, and metaphor—the latter
being essentially Hibernian.
The Izetts of (N.Z.) have been fgetting them-
selves disliked. For trying to horsewhip Izett, editor
of Christchurch Society, a Mr. Crocker was fined £5
and costs ; and the other night, a Bev. Mr. Izett, who
has been advocating the strict enforcement of the Sun-
day Licensing Law, had a bottle of powder placed
under his buggy. but did only nominal
damage.
Thus the Cooktown Herald ;—“Men who
desire to farm and live a comfortable pastoral life
should take a trip to the Annan, where there are thou-
sands of acres available on each bank of a broad river.
The soil is rich black loam, and the slight timber is
easily felled. We have in the Cook five million acres of
land open now, or shortly to be opened, for selection,
and surely we ought to attract the starved-out Wim-
mera farmers.” By the way, many selectors are putting
in rice and maize on the Endeavour.
Near Inverell, on 10th May, 1880, an old man
named Thomas Smith, reputed to have been a miser,
was murdered in his hut. The assassin stove in Smith’s
skull with a hammer, and then out his victim's throat
from ear to ear. Suspicion fell on one John M'Guan,
who, after being placed on his trial three different
times, has at last been convicted and sentenced to
death. When sentence was passed he cursed the
judge, jury, and witnesses in demoniacal style.
While we are humping around the banners and
flags of the Eight Honrs' Association which has lifted
the worrukicg man up another flight of stairs, so to
speak, we might give a thought to the drapers' assist-
ants and other slaves of the shop. One correspondent
tells us that he has “ worked behind the counter for
fourteen hours a day for six years,” and his case is
probably similar to that of many. There are some
thousands of intelligent, well-educated young men and
women in the colony, bound for twelve or fourteen
hours every day to close shops. The eight hours’
movement should not end with the horny-banded.
To the Editor. — Sir, When Parliament pro-
vided for the formation of a Torpedo and Signalling
Corps, the question was asked whether such a corps, the
majority of the members of whiah would necessarily
belong to the Electric Telegraph office, would interfere
with the working of that Department. The question
was answered in the negative. 1 believe the formation
of the corps has not interfered to any serious extent
with the departmental business, but some of the
Government electricians have on occasions. to work
several hours extra without additional pay, in order
that such of their colleagues as are members of the
corps may go away to drill. This is exceedingly unjust.
Yours truly, Morse.
Milbra Nott, a girl of 18, who deliberately
stabbed to death a man who, it is alleged, promised to
marry her but failed to do so, was presented, at Armi.
dale assizes on a charge of murder. The coroner's jury
had returned a verdict of manslaughter only. After
the reading of the indictment, the Crown Prosecutor
asked that the ease be postponed till next sittings.
Mr. Buchanan, for the prisoner (who was dressed in
black), stigmatised the application as cruel and unjusti-
fiable. His client, this interesting young girl, would,
until her trial, six months hence, remain with a dark
cloud on her character which had been brought about
by this dead man. The prisoner was remanded to next
assizes—bail being refused.

Goold, gets two years, while the Maryborough pious
shoplifter Lowry, gets a similar sentence— ergo, it is
not more reprehensible to attempt the commission of a
capital offence, than to fill a bag or two with a few
“ unconsidered trifles.” The inequalities of the law
in inflicting penalties is a disgrace to the English code.
A man in N.S. W. knocks in tnree of his wife's ribs and
cripples her for life, which he atones for with a month.
An inhuman monster rams an axe-handle down his
child’s throat, and gets six weeks; while a little girl of
seven years of age, in one of our English counties, gets
sentenced by a revd. Magistrate to three years for
stealing a flower out of his garden.
The other day, on the Burdekin River, a con-
stable, accompanied by two men named Bobb and
Aldridge, endeavoured to capture a blackfellow called
*■ Willie,” a desperate character, and the ringleader of
the murderers of Fred Boss. It was understood that a
meeting was to take place between him and his gin on
the bank of the Burdekin Biver. By some means the
gin was persuaded not to go, and Mrs. Bobb, remarks
the local George Washington, “ pluokily volunteered to
aot as decoy." The camp was a small island in the bed
of the river. After some parley the blackfellow was in-
duced to cross, and when conversing with Mrs. Bobb,
constable Lowth sprang from behind a shrub, and a
desperate struggle ensued. ** Willie” was greased from
head to too, and being in a perfect state of nudity, it
was a matter of impossibility to hold him till aid came.
He wriggled out of the constable’s grasp, and made
towards the river, the constable in hot pursuit. Both
plunged into the water and gained the opposite bank,
when the constable fired and wounded him in the arm,
but he again made for the river, and disappeared.
At Mudgee Assizes, John Lett, a youth of 16,
was charged with having capitally assaulted one Eliza
M'Nab, aged 19 (who had had aa illegitimate child by
the brother of prisoner). The evidence strongly pointed
to the conclusion that the case was a trumped-up one.
The Judge’s summing up was in favour of prisoner,
who was acquitted. James M'Qrath, a lad of 14, charged
with committing a horrible and unnatural offence, was
also acquitted. One Gardoll, a farmer of Merrendee,
who swore to having witnessed the perpetration of the
offence, deposed that he watched the boy for half-an-
hour, and that, though he knew M'Grath, and was on
intimate terms with his family, he made no attempt to
stop him. Gardoll admitted that he had on previous oc-
casions accused persons of similar unnatural offences,
but denied that be had cried to induce Alderman Thomas
Wilton to *• lag" his (witness’s) own father. For the
defence, Messrs. Bartley, Squires, and Greeusilver gave
evidence to the effect that Gardoll's general repute was
so bad that they would not believe him on his oath,
and that he was in the habit of concocting the like
accusations. M'Grath was acquitted by the jury after
a few moments’ deliberation. That two obviously oon-
oeoted charges of such a nature should be heard at one
sittings, points to a frightfully low standard of local
morality.
Her mouth is a honey-blossom.
No doubt, as the poet sings;
But within her lips, the petals.
Lurks a cruel bee that stings.
An irreverent alooholiat, who lately got up to
address a teetotal meeting, said that so far as Scriptural
authority for teetotalism was concerned, he h*d
searched the Bible from cover to cover, and found—(i)
That at the wedding-feant of Cana the water was turned
into wine; and (2) that the only man in the Book who
was represented as crying for water was in bell, and it
served him right.

Lovely Levy, our old friend, of tootle-tootle
renown, is now in New York, and divides his attention
by alternately blowing into his cornet, and blowing
over his innumerable conquests of the too susceptible
hearts of the Western ladies. Being recently asked to
explain his success as a “ masher ” he replied, “ Yell,
bless my sboul, hif I know ow it is, but the girls all
seem to fasten on me. They will pursue me, don’t you
know, and then there's the ’usbands, they gets jealous.
Blest if hi can 'elp hit, ole feller; but y* see when I looks
at a voman vonce, hi puts hall my soul Inn my heyes,
an* that cooks their goose immejitley.” The trumpeter
was taken down a peg or two, however, not long ago, by
a New York reporter, who, meeting Levy a little
before he was to play a solo at a Brighton Beach matinee,
plainly told him he (Levy) was even a better liar than
n cornet blower, whereap-n the latter yelled “ Vy ble-s
my Weedin’ heyes, but you’re a paraljzer. Why, ’ow’s
this. The very stockings I’ve got on hare silk, and
they’re worked with my monogram by the lady who
‘presented me a dozen of them.” This led to a bet of
■drinks all round that Adonis couldn’t show the rnono-
jgratn, bat he did, and it wasn’t until the party were
starting off to interview the barkeeper that the har-
imonious Hisraelite found some one had planted his
Boots. Just then the Call Boy was heard shrieking for
Mister Levy, but the great oornetist swore he vish he
may die if he’d play in his socks for any one j and so
the management regretted to have to announce that
Mr. Levy was so indisposed that his medical man
ordered his (return to the city immediately. He’s
Letter now, however, and continues to throw “ hall his
{Soul into his heyes ” as usual.

An inquisitive correspondent writes to ask us
how Ot’d Miss Maggie and Misa Nellie Stewart are, re-
spective V- Well, we believe that Nellie is 17 and
Maggie 2o' is true that they both played in panto-
mine 14 yea TS ago, an( t were said at that time by cynical
people to be quite young ladies, but this is a libel.
Nellie was an accomplished burlesque artiste at four,
and Maggie was horn at 40 and is getting younger every
6&7 ' * * * *
The “ Peonle’s S aturday Night Concerts” at the
‘Temperance Hall are said to be really amusing. We
haven’t been there, or ve should probably find that our
ideas of what is “amusing.” and those of the per-
formers were scarcely in same we Wl^
: go round one night and give them a lift, as soon as we
■ can save up money enough to hire a derrick.

The Clara Stephenson Company are playing at
Rockhampton to good business. Our old friends, the
Vivians, are with them. The Rockhampton critics
■ speak at length of the performances of the Company,
i but what they say is written in such astonishing Eng-
lish that we hardly know whether they mean to speak
1 favourably or o therwise. Where do the Roc khampton
j papers get their dramatic critics ? From the Solomon
J Islands ? * * * *
The Montague-Turner Company leave us this
whet We shall be sorry for this, because we were just
btsciLnaing to like them. One of the hardest things
abo«t life in this vale of tears is that when one has met
with tim; which becomes a delight and a desire, and is
so subtly interwoven with the threads of existence that
the ideal ntaiecules of which our minds are made up, are
■when this vision leaves us shaken to shreds, and the
<very centre of cosmos seems to quiver with the con-
cussion, then we just lay around and dam. We may
mot have made our meaning clear in the foregoing sen-
tence Perhaps it would he as well to read it backward.
When the Montague-Turaer Company coma back to
Sydney, we shall of course receive them with open
arms “Mignon” and a number of other operas were
played last week. Let us take “ Mignon " first. Miss
Annin Montague, if not quite the “ ideal Mignon of
Goethe," as the advertisements say, was, nevertheless,
as far as singing was concerned, good enough to have
been The “Swallow song,” a most diflicult piece of
vocalization, was delightfully sung. But one swallow
doesn't make a summer, aud the other performers were
mot swallows. Mr. Turner looked better as Wilhelm
jMeister than as any other character be has yet played
when we have been present. And his singing, though
not equal throughout, was very fine here and there.
As Filina, Miss Josephine Deakin had a good opportu-
nity to distinguish herself. W 3 dan’t think that, can-
didly, her fame will travel further than Lapland, or
that her name will be a household word in the districts
around the North Pole, on the strength of the way in
which she availed hersalf of this chance. As we have
said before, her manner is too icy to rouse an audience
into enthusiasm. She lacks dlan. Not so Signora
Venosta, who sang in capital style and with much
spirit, and looked exceedingly droll, as Frederic, the
boy-lover of Filina.
• • •
Briefly. The striking things about the rest of
the entertainment were Mr. Benham’s appearance and
; Mr. Barrington’s voice. The former looked like a
retired undertaker ; the latter seemed to have a crow’s-
nest in his throat—aud the crows had the croup. Mr.
England (Giirno) and Mr. Perin (Zafflr) did their best;
But when they brought in a Corporation steam-roller,
: and tried to pass it off as a gipsy cart, we felt that we
■ .could never hold them in esteem again.

Oar charming cantatrice, Catherine Lewis, who
’ used to gladden our hearts with the frisky frolics of
“Girofld Girofla,” and “Aagot,” is now one of the
most popular actresses in her line on the American
stage. “ Olivette ” is her tramp card at present, and
witn that gush peculiar to Western critics, the scrice
• of a leading sporting paper observes that “ Catherine
Lewis sings and acts to plea ; e the multitude; the
.imultitude accept the compliment, and whatever of
coarseness and want of finish there may in her per-
formance, the moment she prances upon the stage she
throws her audience into a delirium of delight by the
merry ring of her voice, her winning smiles, and the
■vision she gives of har shapely limbs.” Hoop Lah I

Thus our Adelaide correspondent-Mr. Wybert
•Reeve is playing here to good business. Mr. Reeve’s
company is spectrally thin. The leading lady is
Marian Melrose ; the leading men, Herbert Fleming,
and Harry Emmett, We have had wretched melodrama
and wretched opera here of late. It is a pitv we can’t
have adequate representations of comedy. It is quite
a mistake to fancy in this year of grace that “ any-
thing will do for Adelaide.” Adelaide is beginning to
draw the line. Mr. Eeeve should stage his pieces liber-
ally, and employ a company of capable actors and
actresses to support. He, himself, is not a perennial
fountain of attraction. Like Eignold, Dampier, and
other dramatic comets who haunt ns for better or
worse—chiefly worse—Mr. Eaeve must “star” his
pieces also There is nothing of theatrical moment
over here, except that Lynch's Bellringers were about
to open in the Academy of Music, Madame Thayer
is giving concerts in the Town Hall, and a man with a
three-legged calf is showing in Eundle-street.

The Academy of Music is becoming one of the
most rekerky places of amusement in town. The ancient
clientele of skittle-alley sharps, dancing-hall dandies,
and billiard-room bluffers, have departed like a night-
mare. The change of name seems t® have been con-
current with a change of patronage. Whether the old
frequenters of the whilom Victoria Hall have died of
grief, or are too busily engaged in the gudgeon-fishery
to come round, is a hideous mystery, which we shall not
attempt to solve We are too thankful to be able to
pass into the hall without having to wade knee-deep
through tobacco-spittle to ask any questions.

The Mastodons really deserve good houses, and
they have had them. Their show is a creditable one,
and now that they have arrayed themselves in new
clothes and purchased sixpenny fans, partakes some-
thing of the nature of the sumptuous. These clothes,
by the way, are blue. We should be sorry to think
that this colour is symbolical of the future prospects of
the wearers. The Mastodons are genuinely funny,
without straining too much to be so. Billy Wilson
smiling behind his fan is a sight to see once and die.
Billy’s mouth is like eternity, ora geebung’s generosity
—without beginning or end.

“ The Pirates of Pensunkles,” an opera buffer
by this same Billy Wilson (Esquire), will be produced
some time or other —probably on Saturday week. It is
said to be from first to last one colossal cachinnation,
one gigantic grin. This is the first appearance of Billy
as a “ star " on the literary horizon ef this hemisphere.
What a world of deceptive eidola this is, after all 1
This remark will sound familiar to Billy: Pluto once
said something similar Who would have suspected
that under that guileless exterior, and hidden in the
dimples beneath those dainty lips, there lay a depth of
scholarship, a profundity of passion, that put to shame
the poor and patchy philosophy of a Shakespeare or a
Goethe ? We give this conundrum to the corner-meu
free of charge. Billy Wilsou is a great author.

No other man but Billy Wilson could swallow
this statement.

On Monday night we crawled round to the
Gaiety with gloom in our souls, and a pair of crutches
under our arm, to seethe Pomeroy in Hamlet. We
didn't expect to be able to walk home, so we fortified
ourselves for the occasion. It is with feelings of un-
mixed satisfaction that wo own up to being agreeably
disappointed. We throw Louise a metaphorical bouquet
—there is no brick in the middle of it this time—for her
performance. She did almost as well as we can imagine
any woman doing with such a part. This doesn't pre-
vent ns from saying that we don’t think a woman has
any business to attempt to play Hamlet at all. The
bitter irony and cruel cynicism of some of the speeches
do not fall with grace from the lips of one whom we
know to be a woman. Yet, Louise made a pretty
Prince. Her action was dignified, and her poses per-
fect. But, if we may make such a suggestion to a
lady, she should not wear such high-heeled boots. They
tilt her forward so that when she starts to walk across
the stage to give utterance to some burst of passionate
scorn, one imagines she has borrowed her expression
from the Euminides, and her carriage from an ice-cream
man or a kangaroo. Of course she falls far short of the
ideal Hamlet, but she has come far nearer to it than—
s iy, Defries. Por what she has done we are willing to
give her every credit. She can have a copy of this issue
with our compliments, by sending round a boy with
threepence to the office for it.

Miss Essie Jenyns’ Ophelia was another staggerer
to us. It was a performance full of promise, when we
recollect that the performer is a mere child. Graceful-
ness, and girlish purity of speech and gesture, we ex-
pected, but any real strength of passion we were not
prepared for. Yet it was there We shall watch this
young| lady’s career with interest—and an opera-glass,
because she is really nice enough to be looked at a
second time.

The other ladies we can say no more about, save
that Miss Kate Arden played Queen Gertrude ; Miss
Blanche Lewis, Osric; and Miss Florence Lewis, the
Player Queen. The reason of our laconism is not want
of space this time. It is want of cause for criticism at
length.

Mr, Arthur Elliott (Laertes) will make a good
actor one of these days, if he will take advice, eschew
mannerisms, and forget his personality. He speaks
English, and that is a great point in his favour. We
have been accustomed so long to hear Tierra del
Puegaas and Thugs mouthing onr mother-tongue on
the stage, that we are almost ready to fall down and
worship a man who can pronounce it even tolerably.

Mr. W. J. Holloway (Hamlet’s Father’s Ghost)
was a huge success, because he had to |take the part
of a dead man, and say nothing until he was asked. But
his silence was singularly impressive. 'X here was a
fearful hnsh in the first scene, in the midst of which
“the majesty of bariedDenmark” stalked slowly in,
stood for a moment, as if uncertain whether to scratch
his left foot with his right or his right foot with his
left, and then, after an awful pause, during which the
hearts of the audience stood still, stalked slowly out
again without doing either. This was a masterpiece of
acting.
• • *
Mr. Lachlan M’Gowan made a first-class Polo-
nius, and Mr. W. H. Medcalfe a last-class Horatio.
Mr. G. P. Carey was an excellent First Gravedigger.
There is a rumour afloat that when he has concluded
his engagement at the Gaiety, he will be offered the
editorship of a certain new city paper. We don’t
believe this—not because we don’t think it probable,
bat because we have heard that the position was pre-
viously promised to a mute. Mr. Eobert A. Vernon
makes a good enough King, but we think he would
make a far better subject.
• • #
Now wa come to the real stars of the show— the
genuine comets of the company—Mr. W. E. Bernard
(Eosencrantz), and Mr. S. D. M’Gown (Guildenstern).
There was a serene uncertainty of utterance, a tragic
solemnity of snuffle about tbe performance of these
gentlemen that fairly touched us to tears. And yet
they were as unassuming in demeanour as if they
didn’t know that they had pulled the piece through.
This is always the way with true genius.

How did two apparently second-hand boarding-
house ohaias get into the palace of the Danish King
nine centuries ago ? This is a conundrum for Mr.
Bayliss.

Taking it altogether, we enjoyed this perform-
ance. The only disappointment we had was to find
that Mr. Holloway did not play Ophelia after all.
William, you have gone back on us 1

Miss Annis Montague benefits on Friday night
in “ Faust” When she loves ns—but why be gloomy ?

Pollard’s Liliputians have returned to Sydney,
after doing well up North. They sail for New Zealand
ia a week, opening in Christchurch in the “ Princess of
Trebizond.” From thence they go to Dunedin to play
in the pantomime, “ Robinson Crusoe,” at Christmas.

Signor Yittorini made his first splash in opera
with the Montagne-Turner Company in the “ Bohemian
Girl,” on Friday night. The Signor, who is a Ballarat
Italian, and used to be known as plain 41 Jack Victor,”
when he played tip-cat in Sturt-street, is likely to be a
success. We are glad of this, as we are beginning to
get slightly unwell of the fandango fellows with fine
names, who come out here to us with reputations
achieved in some remote village in Finland, and are
offended if we don’t receive them as world-renowned
artistes. But Jack Victor—no Vittorini for us, an' it
please you; we only know one man of the name, and he
used to travel about with performing guinea-pigs —has
had a good training and sings correctly. His acting is
appropriate, and he bears himself bravely. We wish to
hear more of him.

Bright charming Emelie Melville and what
should prove an excellent company, make their bows
at the Opera House on Saturday night in “ The Royal
Middy." This is Miss Melville’s debut in management
here. The public will give her a fair hearing.
Tho Social Evening of the Sydney Liedertafel,
on the 12th October, was very enjoyable. The
part-singing, to which, this time, the club con-
fined themselves, was done well, and, what with
good music and tho “ cakes and ale ” provided by
the President, Sir Patrick Jennings, the concert
may be said to be the most successful yet given by
the society. The hall was inconveniently crowded,
and tables were strewn promiscuously around to
hold the good things provided. The programme
consisted of the German Glee choruses, not
one English composition being on the programme,
with the exception of Hatton’s transcription of
the “ Happiest Land,” which ia German enough
already. With the golden store of English glees
and madrigals to work upon, it would be wise
for the Sydney Liedertafel to give up the
“pom-pom” and “ hy-del-dee ” of the German
glees for the steady practice of the trea-
sures of harmony and counterpoint which
our English masters have bequeathed to us. Cer-
tainly they require male alto voices, a great
desideratum in English glee-singing, and male
alto voices in the colonies are rare; but there are
many “she-basses” who are silent on the lower
G, whose falsetto notes would be useful in the
English glee singing. The society was assisted
by an instrumental quartette, ably led by Herr
Kreitschman. A tenor sang Hobbs’ “Nina”
fairly; and a baritone, with a good voice, sang
Molloy’s “Polly” a little bit out of tune. Mr.
Frederic M’Quade excelled himself in Chopin’s
yalse In E minor, and the Prayer from “Moses
in Egypt,” transcribed by Thalberg. Mr. Sweet-
man’s rendering of the “Whirlwind” Polka on
the cornet is well-known, and he was most en-
thusiastically encored. The Liedertafel sang
better than at any of their previous concerts.
“ The Chapel,” “Old Bacchus” (which ia short
but meritorious), and“Becher’s March” (which
was substituted for “Hie, thee, Shallop,” one of
the principal tenors being absent), were the most
acceptable. The Melbourne Liedertafel sent some
pieces to be performed, from which was selected
an arrangement of “ Nancy Lea,” wherein the
tenors did the melody, and the rest “ pom-
pomed.” Mr. S. A. Joseph and Sir Patrick made
very happy speeches, and the society may be con-
gratulated upon the success of the whole affair.

A capital invention for the utilisation of sun-
light lor scientific investigation and surgical operations
may be seen at, the studio of Professor Stanioh,
Wynyard-square. It is a simple appliance, but wonder-
fully practical, and once seen will probably be repro-
duced at numerous studios in the city. Professor
Stanioh has sunlight all day in his studio, and can
divert it with the greatest facility to any given point.
For the examination of diseases of the ear and other
similar complaints, the invention is of great value.
The Professor will gladly exhibit the invention to any-
one visiting his studio, and will furnish information for
the reproduction of the contrivance.
There have been in N.S.W. during the last de-
cade, 1996 cases of twin births, and 20 cases of triplets.
N S W. marriage rate for last year is 8'23 per 1000, the
average for the decade being 7'71. Out of the 12,568
persona married during the year there were 5710 bache-
lors, 5683 spinsters, 573 widowers, 500 widows, 1 divorced
man, and 5 divorced women. There were 134 minors
married who were unable to sign their names in the
marriage registers Of this number 6 were males, and
128 females. The percentage of male to female births
stands as 51 36 to 48 64 respectively. The number of
illegitimate children whose births were recorded during
the year 1881 was 1263, which gives a percentage of 4'35
to total nnmber of births registered. The percentage
of illegitimates to the total nnmber of births registered
in Sydney, suburbs, and country districts is 11 36, 3 - 23,
and 334 respectively. The illegitimate rate for the
year is 165 per 1000 of estimated population at the
middle of the year. The population of the colony, as
shown by the census taken on the 3rd April. 1881,
amounted to 751,458 persona. Males numbered 411,149,
and females 340,319. The small-pox outbreak cost 37
lives.
The Hon. S. C. Brown, M.L.C., late Post-
master-General, died suddenly on Monday from
effusion of blood on the brain. Early in the
afternoon Mr. Brown was stricken down while
examining a witness in the Insolvency Court. He
was immediately removed to the Oxford Hotel,
and the assistance of Dr. Harman Tarrant and
other medical gentlemen at once obtained, but
doctors could not save him, and he expired at
about half-past 4. The news of the sad occur-
rence created surprise and general regret in the
city. Mr. Brown was 53 years of age. He was
one of the leading solicitors of Sydney, and earned
the reputation of having studied the law to avert
rather than provoke litigation. He was a repre-
sentative of Nowtown for about twenty years,
but was never a “local” man. His political
career is free from even a shadow of the suspicion
of corruption. He was rather a political critic
than an office-seeker, and was no less awkward
as an opponent than as a supporter. At one
time he was requested to form a Ministry, hut as
he was no more successful than Diogenes, he re-
signed the task. Some time back Mr. Brown,
yielding to personal pressure, accepted office in
the present Government as Postmaster-General,
but disagreeing with his colleagues he maintained
his political integrity and resigned. On Tuesday
the Legislative Assembly adjoirned out of respeot
to his memory.

Readers, if you could but see us,
As we sit and slowly squirm
Line by line and verse by verse out.
Sickly wheeze and gag infirm—
While our brows are csld and clammy.
And our eyes in frenzy roll,
And our mouth with scornful smiling
Seems to stretch from pole to pole—
You would think that we were writing—
Such the desperation set
In our stare —for the new weekly,
Mackay’s Geavediogees’ Gazette.

Strangely the web of Destiny is ordered s

The loftiest wit with depths of madness bordered.
Judge not! The taper’s light

This, constant, feebly bright—
That, sudden, with wild flame, all barriers spurning.
Judge not! Beyond the grave
We shall know better tne immense, great trial;
This man submits, a slave;
The other fights and dies, in fierce denial.

Calm from without, more wise than those within it.
Counts the long “ Yea " of life.
Not the “No,” the single faithless minute.


PEPPER AND SALT.
We are evidently becomings, great country, and
we are especially getting civilized. We have frozen
moat, the electric-light, pneumatic lift*, Lewis Scott,
and galvanic hair-brushes, and last, but by no means
least, we have Daniel Allen. For a very long time this
genial gentleman and brilliant scholar has had a reprj
tation for holiness which few people have cared to
challenge ; but it was not until last Saturday’s Herald
came crashing upon a startled universe, that it .dawned
on creation he was a poet. la the advertising columns
of that journal appears a copy of verse headed •' How
It was Burnt Dawn: An ode to the Garden Palace, by
Pastor D. Allen ’’—the signature of the author, plea-
santly varied to “Daniel Allen, Pastor,” appearing
beneath the production. The first line is typical in
grandeur of expression, and delicacy of diction,of the rest
of the poem. It runs :
“ Our city’s beauty and her pride is (sic) gone.”
Having wept over this piece of brilliant imagery, we go
farther down, and find a jtouchinglpicture of the once-
beautiful building, in which—
“ Friend met his friend, with pleasure and with joy—
All was there to please,—nothing to annoy.”
Then, passionately, cries the bard—
“ Has all this beauty, art and pleasure gene ?
Great God I show us by whom the deed was done.”
The worthy Pastor is much exercised as to “ how it was
done,’' and sings—
“ How many deeds, like these, are often done
In darkness, and before the rising sun ?
Where children soon to celebrate the day (sic).
When aid to Homan schools should pass away. [lll]
Another Popish plot is evidently hinted at. This is the
tenth the gifted divine has discovered. The last was i
when a juvenile Jesuit (indirect communication with
Pome) drew on Dan’s door panels a representation of the
entrance to an enormous cavern, and labelled it “Ture
mouth.” The, bard builds up his case against the poor
Pope with much skill—
“ Did the Italian Liberator’s fame—
Proclaimed within her courts, create the flame P
No match, nor pipe, nor gas, nor rag, nor cane,
Could so quickly spread that awful flame.”
Then, mark this —the equal of which has not been seen
since Gubbins wrote his last stanza to a “Bashful
Mule
“ No, no I our sense revolts at such a thought,
And seeks seme better reason to be brought.
The flames came up, as if from hell;
Came they from schools, or creeds—can any tell ?’’
This poem, as will be seen by the extracts we have
made from it, is of a most remarkable description, and >
if it does not throw an astonishing amount of light upon
the origin of the fire, it is of value to the nation, if only
jn establishing the identity of the gifted creature who
used to write so poetically in the papers verses on veal
and stankas on sausages.

Once upon a time, in the good old days, long
before people were base enough to suspect John Davief
of giving away sailors’ hats, there lived a Victorian
Judge—a bachelor—who employed two female servants
And his name was P . One of these handmaidf
—which her name was Bridget—was a plain—a ver?
plain cook, while the other was fair to look upon, and
it came to pass that his Honor looked upon her a good
deal, to the discomfiture of the cook, who mumbled
over her potato-peeling and concocted plans for “ bowl-
ing out the young hussy,” in the washus. Now, the
Judge’s house was so organized that his domestic!
occupied separate sleeping-apartments, (and the cool
—who was not an entire believer (to her shame, be it
said) in the immaoulatenesa of her sex—used to burst
n to the pretty maid’s room both at night-time and in
the early morning, in an honest endeavour to catch her
•* tripping.” Not after many months, discovering any-
thing of a Terpsichorean nature in her fellow-servantV
conduct, she had almost given the idea of an esclandre
up in despair, when darting in to the girl’s apartment
in the cold grey of dawn for a final try, she perceived
that the room was untenanted. Bushing down to the
Judge’s bedchamber, she knocked and entered. “ Please
sir, I’ve come to tell you that that hussy, Maria, hasn’t
been home all night.” Then the curtains were drawn
aside, and after his Honor had tersely explained that
“that hussy, Maria,” was now Mrs, Judge P ,
a soft gentle voice exclaimed: “ Bridget, please get
breakfast immediately.” And Mrs. P is not

In the Manning Eiver Page we read that
vi s[ r . Cameron has received instructions to proceed to
Southgate, Clarence Eiver. He will take away with him
the respect and esteem of a large circle of friends and
acquaintances.” Is that all? What! No biscuit-box,
no egg-stand, nor address in round text. No parting
drunk—no valedictory pencil-case! Mt. Cameron, we
respect you. # # #
The Newcastle Herald says that it has upon
its staff “ several useful reporters of groat intellectual
calibre.” We know this to be true as regards their
youth; but if they write “ Dry Tonics," we don’t care
about endorsing the second part of the quotation. We
have frequently encountered some such juvenile scribes.
They are demons at tip-oat, and at road-metal-and-
palihg-polo have few equals. And this reminds us of an
Adelaide yarn. The Register of that city brings up
all its staff as apprentices. They commence their in-
dentures in the coal-hole, and are gradually elevated to
the par. manufactory. Well, Gus St. Leon’s Circfls was
in full swing, with Johnny Cameron—a born humourist
—on the door. Shortly after nine a placid young hope-
ful trips up, and with a haughty glance at Johnny,
pushes in. “Hi!” cried Jolnny, "where are you
going, my child?" “The Register,” was the proud
reply. “No, no, little one," said Cameron, sadly;
“ this must not be allowed." Then, taking the reporter
by the hand, he led him round to the back, and whis-
pering a few words to one of the ladies—a muscular
trapesist who had finished her “ turn ”—ho left them
together. A little later, that boy was whisked into a
cab, and first taken to the Police Station as a lost child,
and then escorted round to his office, and tearfully de-
livered up to the editor, with a request that his mother
would look after him better in future. When the paper
appeared next day, •’ a slight falling off " was noticeable
in the performance.
The S. M. Herald is moatoertainly getting giddy.
Under the heading of “ A Neapolitan Custom," it tells
us that at Naples, when you marry, you are expected
next day to pay a visit to your mother-in-law, and for
not doing this a bridegroom was recently murlerod by
the son of the woman whom he had slighted. The
writer quoted by the Herald says“ I do not enter
into other details of the custom, the omission of which
was so fatal. They may be easily surmised. Even
clerical influence cannot suppress it. The honour of a
family is supposed to be connected with it.”—

Ingletre (not Ingestre, dear journalistic brothers)
Hall has been burnt down. This is the second bit of
bad luck which has befallen the Premier Earl of
England lately. And altogether, Mrs. Mundy seems to
have been a bad investment. First she broke up
Mundy’s home, and now she seems to have burned
down. We suppose it occurred through
lighting up celebration bonfires inside the house, or
getting up displays of fireworks in the larder. The
adventures of this little family are beginning to be
interesting—especially to us. ForJ we know precious
well what the next cable will say. —"Pending the re-
building of Ingletre Hall, the Earl and Countess of
Shrewsbury will make a tour of the Australian

There is a row at home about John Brown.
The Queen has made him such a big favourite that he
has now three fine bouses, valets and footmen to wait
upon him, and all ho has to do is to lounge about the
Eoyal apartments, administer the Imperial “ medicine ”
when required, and chaff the people who are waiting for
audiencas. With the junior members of the Eoyal
Family, he is flippant, though affable, but the “guiver”
he dispenses to Dukes and Marquises is stated to be of
an outrageous description. "At what time will Her
Majesty bo at leisure for my audience?” asked the
Duke of Westminster of him, tho other day. ” What!
you come bothering here again 1” cried the body-servant:
"this won’t do. Tour little matter will have to stand
over. It’s only about the Governor- Generalship of India,
and this is our jam day. Come any time that we’re not
busy. Let’s see. To morrow’s flannel-petticoat morn-
ing j next day, I submit the pig-liat; there!—come on
Tuesday week." He has grim humour, too. One day
when M. Van de Weyer called to see Prince Leopold
before his marriage, John said " Certainly,” and took
him into a room in which there was a large surgeon’s
chair. On a tray beside the fauteuil was a leg-frame,
a glass eye, two foot-bolts, and a spine-snap. “ There's

Perhaps one of the funniest things we have read
for some time is the article in The Herald on the
“Artisans' Working College and Technical Training
School.” From what the Old Lady’s reporter tells us,
this institution would seem to possess a good many of
the features of a scholastic establishment kept by Mr.
Wackford Squeers, “ at the delightful village of Dothe-
boys, near Greta Bridge, Yorkshire.” The article, which
is far too long to be perused by the general reader, is
one of the most delightful pieces of ingenuous journalism
it has ever been our lot to peruse. The writer, innocently
eneugh, has unconsciously paraphrased several portions
of “Nicholas Nickleby." He makes out that very
little is put into the boys at the Middle Harbour College,
and a great deal taken out of them ; and also that they
are hammered by the male and female superintendents of
the institution on frequent occasions—even when at their
prayers; for we read in the statement of one boy that
“ One night, at a time when there were only three boys
in the place, we were going to bed, and we forgot to say
•Good night’ to her. While we were kneeling down
saying our prayers, she came in with the cane and
flogged the lot of us.” The picture, indeed, drawn of
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson—whether a true one or not—
reminds us forcibly of this passage relating to the
Squeerses;—“Now, the fact was, that both Mr. and Mrs.
Squeers viewed the boys in the light of their proper
and natural enemies; or, in other words, they held and
considered that their business and profession was to
get as mu ah from every boy as could by possibility be
screwed out of him. On this point they were both
agreed, and behaved in unison accordingly.” Then,
again, none of the Middle Harbour students seem to be
quite clear a* to their fathers and mothers. One, like
Graymarsh, had only a maternal aunt, and the family
relations of the others were of a very vague and misty
nature. The pupils at the Working College occupied
themselves in making sofas and helping Mrs. Anderson
with the washing, which reminds us of the duties of
Mr. Squeers’ first class in English spelling and philo-
sophy. Let’s condense the immortal description of
Mr. Squeers’ academy“ * Now, then, where’s the
first boy ?’ * Please, sir, he’s cleaning the back parlour
window,’ said the temporary head of the philosophical
class. ‘So he is, to be sure,’ rejoined Squeers. ‘We
go upon the practical mode of teaching, Nickleby; the
regular education system. C-l-e-a-n, clean, verb active,
to make bright, to scour. W-i-n, win, d-e r, winder, a
casement. When the boy knows this out of book, he
goes and does it. It’s just the same principle as the
use of the globes. Where’s the second boy ?’ • Please,
sir, he’s weeding the garden,’ replied a small voice,
‘ To be sure,’ said Squeers, by no means disconcerted.
‘So ho is. B o-t, hot, tin, bottin, n-e-y, ney, bottinney,
noun substantive, a knowledge of plants. When
he has learned that bottiney means a know-
ledge of plants, he goes and knows ’em. ....
‘Third boy, what’s a horse P’ ‘A beast, sir,’ replied
the boy. ‘So it is,* said Squeers. . . . ‘As you're
perfect in that,’ resumed Squeers, turning to the boy,
‘ go and look after my horse, and rub him down well, or
I’ll rub you down. The rest of the class go and draw
water up, till somebody tells you to leave off, for it’s
washing-day to-morrow, and they want the coppers
filled.’ ” When a letter came for a boy to the “ Tech-
nical Training School,” if the scholars are to be
believed, he did not always get it, and when one boy
came with a stock of slothes, he had to divide it
amongst his fellow collegians—a state of affairs quite
as humorous, if not more so, than the mode adopted by
Mrs. Squeers of disposing of new boys* wardrobes at
“ Dotheboys Hall.” If Mr. and Mrs. Anderson keep a
boy farm, as it is broadly hinted in the Herald, there
cm be no question about one thing, and that is they
are indebted to that journal for one of the most splen-
did advertisements that it has given to anything since
Pastor Chiniquy last appeared amongst us.

It is satisfactory to learn from such a reliable
source as the Hon. W. H. Sattor that the Goat Island
explosives are “ perfectly harmless before they are
formed into a compound, ’’ and that there is, therefore,
little or no dagger of our being lifted as high as Jupiter
or the price of roasting eef at present; but it mars tb e
festivity just a little to find from the official reports
that on the Ist inotant the Land of Goats actually con-
tained no less than “97,165 lbs. cf canister powder.
772,527 lb. of blasting powder, and 230,061 lb. of other
explosives.” Possibly, Mr. Suttor may desire to
straddle across the comet’s tail, but it is anything but
pleasant for the average citizen to reflect that the
simple matter of “ forming a compound ” by mems of
900,000 lb. of powder and a hot poker, might: at any
moment plunge him into with all his imper-
fections upon his head, and perhaps not a shilling in
his pockets to get a bed with.
A few moons ago a back-block King in
Bananaluid found himself in a tight place, but his
guileless daughter, his only cbee-ild, pulled him through
for a time by buying the whole of his stations, cattle,
horses, and stock-in-trade. This little token of filial
sfiEsctien took so well that Augns’a went two points
more, by engiging Daddy as etookmai at £25 a year,
with rations, and promoting Mamma to the kitchen as
a domestic servant on a similar screw, with the usual
perks. Unfortunately, however, some of the old man's
creditor* hauled the matter before the Court of White-
wash, and Mr. Justice Pring hurst up the whole concern.

There is a very inhospitable squatter down
South. Late one evening, not long ago, a young clergy,
man, who was travelling, arrived at old Wirefenoe's
mansion and asked for tucker and a t>ed. The old man
looked at him and grunted out: “Sleep in the men’s
hut and ask the storeman for your pannikin of flour.”
The parson, having no other nuans of getting grub and
a bed, had to comply. He passed a surveyor’s camp
next morning and told the hands that the “ live stock"
in the men’s hut were simply awful. When Bushranger
Hall was down about those parts, he paid Wire-
fence a visit, and made him peel oil his olothea and
dance a hornpipe on top of a cask, where he forced
him to remain for two hoars.

gallery, and a jug of Toobey’s elixir, is marked by an
air distingue ; every lady who smiles oq an Echo editor,
and asks him how he is HI for hair-oil, or shows him
any other thoughtful little attention at a fancy ball, is
described as Icing dressed d merveille ; while the belie
who shows him her back is spjken of as 1 emg an grande
toilette, but, entre nous, looked rather rfdee when the
gaslight beamed upon her. And when Signora Squalliui
makes her first bow, and lets ©if her opening yells, wo
are told next day that the debutante had un ion parti and
vocalised delicieusement, but her nez is rathor retrousse

be very nice for the Darling Point plutocracy, and some
of the quotations may be heavy enough to pelt at mid-
night cats, or frighten burglars with, but most of us
would understand the old lady better if she spoke her
native tongue, and described a dinner as being “ bully,”
instead of rechercM; a muffin-worry as having “took
well,” instead of passed off with great 6cldt; an amorous
elder, who had a weakness for chasing Susannas, as being
a “ hoary-headed old scamp," not an ancient rouS; and
when an elopement happens, the old lady should say
“ we learn from our Bogan correspondent that a Sydney

Tlie Adelaide Hunt Club haa struck a new
Gordouesque noet, who, it seems, is a near relation of
Alfred’s last Parnassian prodigy. Here is a ha’p’orth
of him as he appeared in the Adelaida Journal —an
evening paper, by the way, which is published at
11 a.m :
11 We love the sound of splintering rails, the thuiding
of hoofs on the turf;
Whether wet or dry, if it hails or pours, to weather we
are not serfs.
Alas ! those hours too quickly flown, with Bickford on
Barney leading,
With Bob on Eory, now full blown into a Hunt Cup
victor; ring—”
There is an excuse for this bard, however. He never
got near enough the field to get a good look at the hunt.
His Pagasus never would go unless lit heard the jingle
of the ice-cream cart behind it.
From Dunedin comes the tale of a man who, by
drinking a decoction made from blue-gum leaves, cured
a cold but eomplete'v spoilt his “ har," which at once

• ic carelesr slinging about of truth. Why cannot
journalists confl ia them#e ves *o facts ? They are just
as easy to write as flcli ni For example, there is the
stcry told of a party wbo was once known as Brcwi,
but, alas! he is brown no longer. He has been yellow,
blue, black, pink, mauve, Assyrian purple, Macgregor
tartan, amber, and Spanish olive within the last three
days, and it happened thuswise: —Brown has a mouth
which has frequently been taken for the Newtown rail-
way tunnel, and it is said Billy Wilson has lost the
rosy flush of health which once mantled on his
capioious cheeks, and has dropped into a steady decline
since he first caught sight of Brown's 2to-acro orifice.
Brown is rather proud of this hotel cellar of his, and he
carries it round to frighten horses, and shows it oil
whenever an opportunity offers. A favourite trick o(
his is to swallow a pair of boots, or put a Family Bible
or a small cradle into his coal-pit, and then shut down
the door. One day last week he was at Boyd’s, the
photographer’s, and a bet was made that ha couldn’t
put a 15s. box of water-colour paints in his mouth and
wrap his jaws around them. He bad ju?t succeeded in
doing the trick, hcwaver, when Boyd’s assistant fell
over a pile of oleographs, and in the excitement Brown
swallowed the whole box of paints.—the result being
that he cannot take a drink of any fluid whatever now
without dissolving a paint ; and, most extraordinary 1 <
relate, the hue works through his system, and he has
never since been two days the same colour. On Monday
he was a rich indigo, but after breakfast on Tuesday
morning he changed his shade, and came out in a gor-
geous piebald covering. After dinner he was a lovely
azure blue, and by tea-time the crimson paint got a t-how,
and Brown turned as red as a winter petticoat; and going
out in that condition for a walk on Wednesday he was
chased two miles by an exasperated bull and shot over a
three-rail fence at Darlington. The worst of it is he
never can regulate his colours. If he is asked to a
wedding to-day. he may probably go with a blacking-
bottle complexion; and if he toddles off to a funeral
to-morrow, he will doubtless show up tattooed like a
barber’s sign-post. He says he doesn’t mind the
stomachic disturbance a bit, but it’s the jammed un >
certainty of the thing that kills him. f.
Bathurst boasts of a brass band,— at least part
of the inhabitants do, and the re st go about calling on
the rocks and the gaol to fall down and squelch them.
About fonrt< en nights a week are devoted to practice by
these musical pirates, and the sounds which emanate
frrm the band room would give even a deaf man an idea
that 25,G00 donkeys, calves, crows, and elephants were
being roasted alive, and loudly protesting against the
business. A few nights ago the bandists blasted out a
waltz from 7 o’clock till midnight. Next morning the
two clarionet players were found dead in a blind creek,
both having been stabbed in the back with their own
instrumental weapons by a number of outraged citizens,
and the euphonium player only saved his bacon by
crawling up the bell end of his instrument. and pitching
the lot over a Chinaman’s fence in Ho wick-street.
Nevertheless, some of the players arc of the first water.
There is the second cornet player, for instance, a man
who is fully two-thirds music, and the rest beef sane-
wiches, and the party who lets out his soul into the kl
flat bass, is beyond all doubt the best friend the under
takers have in the Western district The gentleman
who lips the piccolo is a host in himself, and the first
blast from the alt horns causes every dint o within a
radian of ten miles to sit down on his tail and howl
until his eyeballs start down his cheeks, and look into
his mouth just to see what ha ale for dinner that dis-
agreed with him. A diabolical plot wasrecantlv hatched
to invite the whole of the bandsmen to a moonlight tx-
cursion in Jimmy the butcher's p iddock, where they
were to be made dead drunk on “snake juice," and
then either hoisted into the Macquarie Elver orti;d
across the track of the Sydney goons train ; but, unf »r-
---------tunately for the peace of the city, the grog gave out
before the band gave in, and so|tbeir funerals have been
for a time postponed.

There is Warawaram, for instance.
He is king in one of the islamls
where missionaries alternately
rule the roast and are then roasted
themselves. Well, Warawaram
had 47 wives. One of these was
Neokabil, whom he loved aboa<
46 times better than the other -36
put together. And, of course,
Neckabil died. Warawaram was
inconsolable. He forgot to tattoo
himself, and it is on record teat
his spine was not rubbed down
with hog's lard for a week. Neck-
abil’s corpse was planted in a
canoe, which was confined in the
king’s humpy, and Warawaram
sat over it for five days, drinking
arrack and chewing betel. Then
its condition, aromatically speak,
ing, became so bad that the
natives of another island wexo
getting rebellious. So one of the
missionaries remonstrated. But
Warawaram was firm and devoted.
He replied loftily : “It yen want
'im Necky’s body buried, you pay
’im funeral expenses.” And the
missionary was only too glad to
shell out for Neckabil’s shell, be.
cause seven of his half-caste illegi-
timates had already died of
cholera. You see that a savage
has feelings.

The efforts of splendid genius will never fail to
conjure up imitators. A short while since, Alfred char'
tered a great creature who went round the clock several
times, and who is now, we presume—since his delightful
sketches no longer appear in the News—either dead cr
fencing. Well, we see that as he took his inspiration
from the London Sala (poor Sala 1) another gifted writer
has taken his inspiration from the Sydney Sala, and
pours out his soul in the Queensland Sugar Planter.
He travels from Maryborough to Rockhampton, and
remarks: —“Without imitating the author of ‘Twice
Round the Clock,’ I hope to interest yet instruct my
readers,”—a passage in which he embodied rather a
doubtful compliment to Alfred's “ Juains." The
steamer he found to be “suppressively screaming*' ( )
at the wharf, and the cold was of a “ most mnmpful (!)
description." Later, “the steward’s prototypes (I)
alarmed (I!) the passengers to dinner.” The ladies*
tones are •* saccharine,’' and we are told of a gentlemen
that, “ like bis late partner, he is not tired of the battle
of life, but with a rejuvensceuoe (sic) of spirit and
speculative enterprise he seeks," &o.; and be concludes
as follows: “A day in Bundaberg is full of interest,
and a drive through the Woongarra Scrub most in-
structive and reflective” (sic). We should think the
(fleet of all this wilt be to make the Bnndabergians (as
he calls them) “ reflective," and we shouldn’t wonder if
when next he visits the town he has immortalized, the
reflections of the citizens took the form ot pine-battens

A pleasant incident occurred at a recent Rock-

its great length was pointed out to him. “Give me a
grip of the hammer,” said his reverence. He took the
metal, and cast it with infinite ease a clear yard beyond
that of the winner’s throw. It a splendid physique

Two R.C. 'vorts, Messrs. Ellis and Drayton,

that this beneficial institution is now open, we beg to

recommend the usual denominational bludgeon as an

advice they will first send Pastor Allen the well-known
work, “ HcW to Cheat the Devil," or “ Fifty Yeara in

The Christadelphiana have summed up the
future of the world, and laid out all prophecy There
is no mystery with them. Though they hold the Bible
as the only source of becoming “wise unto salvation,”
they have banished from their tenets the orthodox
heaven and hell, the jasper streets and the Are and
brimstone, and believe mainly in a solid earthy mil-
lennium. This is mapped out to start at a period about
40 years to come. Although they have no hell, it
appears that the devil is still alive, and the millennium
won’t happen till the old gentleman is wiped out. Tnen
** the King ” will reign for a thousand years as the only
potentate upon the earth, and it is the ambition of the
Christadelphiana to share in this reign. Churches will
crush out art galleries and theatres ; itinerant preach-
ing mountebanks. Cooks, Dawiea, and C.M.G.’s will
become as extinct as the old moa for ever and ever,
amen. The secretary of the Christadelphian Society in
Sydney says that the sect doesn’t believe in the Trinity,
and explains its ideas upon this point. It claims to be
a revival brought about by a Dr. Thomas, in America,
of the religious body referred to in Acts xxviii. 22
Joe Cook, the Apostle from America —a place
which we believe was never designed for salvation
—thus answers in his Question-Box, the poser:
” What is yeur definition of the word * Free-thinker ?’
A man with one eye shat. The truth is, I have received
too many questions from free-thinkers, and seven out of
every ten of them show theological and philosophical
inoompetenoy. Very bad spelling, too, eomas from
these sceptics. In Adelaide, where we hnd to exclude
a large number of their questions, I was asked who was
Cain’s wife, Cain’s name being spelt with a K. Free-
thought is usually crooked thought, and a free-thinker
in seven cases out of ten, is simply a crooked, unbal-
anced thinker. Free-thought, strongly defined, would
be exemplified in a man who takes reason for his
authority, and nothing else. That is what it pretends
to do, but it is one of the last things it usually does in
reality.” Thus is Christianity defended avainst the
shafts of unbelief ? The unorthodox, Dr. Tyndall or
Huxley though he may be,-must, never lift his head
aftfr this. Another question asked of Joseph was:
” Does Mr. Cook believe in tno never-ending punish-
ment of the wicked ?’’ and his answer was: “ If you
mean the finally incorrigible, I answer in the affima-
tive ” This, then, gives ua no hope even for Joseph
himself.
We don’t know what we’d do without the re-
ligious prints Here's the latest from the threepenny
John Knox: —‘‘Five hundred subscribers —We are
very desirous to get, before the end of the year, 500 new
subscribers This number is necessary to make The
Presbyterian financially successful. To got them we
look to our friends. There are many Presbyterian
families where the paper is unknown. A little personal
canvassing is all that is necessary. It each charge will
only sand us seven new names, the object will be at-
tained. Where will a beginning be first made ? We shall
be glad to send specimen copies to anyone wishing to
help in this movement.” The line has the
true holy journalistic ring about it. Wit the last idea
is a fatal one. We don’t believe the cßtor will get his
500 new readers by the now year. Ho ’must alter the
tone of hia paper. And this brings as to the most
liberal offer we have yet made. We offer to run The
Presbyterian for three months from The Bulletin
office, and we undertake to add 5000 subscribers to its
list in the time. We’ll do it for the Presbytery for
£IOO, but that body must not hold us responsible for
any c'erical libels published during the period Onr
“ Pulpit Gossip,” we believe, would fetch 1000 sub-
scribers straight off. provided we inserted whatever one
clergyman sent ua about another. The offer remains
open for one month. Within two wseks we expect a
call from the Presbytery.

Hold hard here a minute. If you imagine, ro ider, that
wo are going to abuse him for doing this, or make any
unkind reference to the flogging of the money-changers
episode, your fancy is too frisky for your spiritual wel-
fare. We don’t blame him. We would like to see every
minister in this city do the same thing, and see what
the pews would fetch. We would then know, practi-
cally, what there is in religion—from the lay side, and
from the ostentatious facet of that, perhaps, but still
something. If a man can sell you so much grace
for so much coin, why shouldn’t he be allowed
to trade? If you believe him, buy. You may get the
better of him in the bargain. We have even known
people who have done well out of Holy Joe. It is
superfluous to say that these were not the people who
boarded him. We think that in this progressive age a
man is entitled to sell any gift he possesses, which is of
benefit to the public, or—what amounts to the same
thing—whioh they think is of benefit to them. One
may even sell his soul if h« can find a purchaser. But
the devil has grown fastidious of late.

POLITICAL POINTS.
England’s policy is to detach Egypt from the
Sultan, with the view to diminish his authority, and at
the same time to establish a firm Government under
European guarantee.
One reason why Sir Henry saw no urgency in the
matter of erecting new Parliament Houses was, “The
necessity to go on with the legislation so much needed
by the country.” The country comes first as a matter of
course—then comes—“ his attachment to the old build-
ing, which was the seat where the best men of the
Legislature had sat." “Ah I the dear old building,—
scone of so many triumphs. Ah ! the dear old scene—
where so often the necessities of this bosem have given
way to the necessities of the people.”—The old man
here broke down. It beats Laurence Sterne’s descrip-
tion of Le Eevra's lamentation over his dead ass —only
this time the ass has been skinned for the hide 1
If the deprivation of the senses is a preliminary
to destruction—and there is a musty Latin quotation
which says that it is—Sir Henry Parkes must be in the
clutches of the destroying power. His piteous drivelling
on the question of opening the Art Gallery on Sunday ;
his sickly sanctimoniousness «n the Oaths Question j
his action in waiting in the House for several hours to
oppose Mr. Parnell’s preliminary motion for the intro-
duction of the Contagious Diseases Bill, when he was
so weak, physically, that he could barely stand; and,
lastly, faii ahiurd proposal to establish the Library on
the Benevolo it Asylum site—all indicate a “falling elf ’*
The (wo or three nasty knocks which the “ great old
man " has had lately may have the tile it of bringing him
to his senses somewhat. What with Sir Henry’s
fanaticism and Sir John’s buffoonery, things have come
to a pretty pass, and it remains to be seen whether the
people will not at the next election relegate these
used-up knights to well-earned otsouiity.
The papers in the case of Day, junior, were laid
upon the table of the House last week ; but, contrary to
the usual practice, the Government did net move that
they be printed. Mr. Day, senior, moved foe the pro-
duction of the papers, but he is not likely to move that
they be printed. Now, Mr. Day, senior, what are you
giving ns ? and how did you manage to get round the
Government ? All through this business, it has been
apparent that the Ministry wished to shield Mr. Day,
and the non-printing of the papers is another part of
the little game which was commenced when Mr. Day
moved that they be produced. Thousands of pounds
are wasted annually on the printing of documents at
whloh no one emr looks, except the butcher who uses
them for sausage-wraps ; but in this ease common
honesty demands the printing of the papers. It is
necessary in the interests of the Parliament —which,
above all bodies, ought to be pure—that these papers
should be published. Mr. Eyrie ought to move that
this be done; and if Mr. Eyrie doesn’t move—well,
then, Jack M Elhone should attend to the matter.
“ In a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.”
We might alter this, and say Among a multitude of
deceivers there is a Wisdom but no wisdom.’’ Mr.
Lackey has always had the reputation of being a plain,
out-spoken man, but, last week, acting, no doubt, on
instructions from his silver-haired chiefs, who are
practical hands at the business, he assumed the role of
a deceiver. He was speaking in opposition to Mr
Pigott’s motion in reference to the extension of the
railway to Circular Quay, aad wound up by producing a
plan of a railway to go round Darling Harbour and on
to Circular Quay. He introduced the plan unexpectedly
end in such a way as to lead the belief that it was quite
anew idea which had seined the Government, and that
they wished to propose that the work be carried out,
but he carefully avoided saying so in distinct words.
The whole thing was a carefully designed plan to deceive
the House, but, unfortunately for the inventors of the
plan, Mr. Wisdom was too communicative. In a weak
moment ho let out the secret that the pilau was not a
new one, but that it had bean in existence for several
months. Up to this point Mr. Pigott was jubilant,
and two or three members had congratulated him on
the prospect of success attending his efforts to have
the extension of the railway made—about which he,
probably cares, or would care very little, if it were not
that his seat in the House depended upon it—but im-
madiately the admission was made, a “ change came
o’er the spirit of his dream." Severe looks were
observable, and bard words were audible.

THIS Company i« formed to purchase and work the
rich Gold Mining Leases belonging to Mr. George
Slater, at Opliir, containing about 41 acres of Gold-
bearing Reef Lands, at the well-known “ Bluff,” near the
junction of the Lewis Ponds and Summerhill Creeks, and
adjoining the celebrated “ Belmore ” Mining Property.
Ophir is situated about 15 miles from Orange, and is
the locality where gold was first discovered in Australia,
and, in the immediate vicinity of the “Bluff,” the first
alluvial gold mining was successfully carried out in 1851.
The gold in its oharaeter was generally nuggetty, and
pieces were found weighing up to 120 ounces each ; many
of the smallest of these pieces were attached to quartz,
and were sold under the name of “ specimens.”
The “Bluff” itself has evidently been formed by the
Summerhill Creek impinging against the lull side, and
cutting away a large portion of rock and earth —thus
forming an almost perpendicular cliff, and exposing an
enormous quartz reef. The “ Bluff ” Reef is, in the
opinion of all miners, the main reef of the Opldr Gold
Field, and there can be no doubt that the alluvial gold in
immediate contiguity came from tliis reef, the mechanical
action of the water having played the pait of a quartz
mill, disintegrating the reef stone, thus setting free
the gold, which, after untold centuries, the diggers
collected in their cradles and tin dishes. But if any
further proof were wanting, it is furnished by the
fact that, about 15 years ago, Driscoll and Party made
a great discovery of “ specimens ” immediately under a
huge mass of slate rock, which had evidently fallen
from the “Bluff.” These “specimens” of quartz and
gold had been imprisoned in a crevice, at the slaty bottom
of the stream, by this heavy covering, and contained—
after being crushed by hammers—an immense quantity of
gold. It is towards this reef that all the leaders which
have been and still continue, so rich in the immediate
vicinity are apparently, directing their course. Of these
may be mentioned the one on the top of the “ Bluff,” in
Mr. Slater’s ground, frtmx which 200 ounces of gold were
obtained in a few hour*,, ; »ud those in the celebrated “Bel-
more ” claim, which are now so rich, and from which a
large pared of stone, recently treated at the Mint, yielded
at tho rate of 4,300 ounces of gold to the ton. The report
to tho Minister for Mines from the Warden of the Orange
Gold Field, John T. Lane, Esq., dated July 17th, 1882,
mentions tliis discovery. His report is given with the
prospectuses in citoulation.
In the prineipal Gold Fields of Australia, notably at
Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Olunes, early attention was paid
to quartz deposits. Mines have been working for many
years, and hundreds of thousands of tons of quartz raised
to the surface from depths of from 1,000 to 1,600 feet. This
shows the permanency of quartz mining, and proves that
when quartz eaa be obtained in quantity, a few dwts. of
gold to the ton of quartz will pay handsome dividends, as
for instance, the “ Criterion ” ground, at Clunes, yielded
for 30,120 tons of stone, 6,457 ounces 4 dwts. of gold, or
at the rate of 4 dwts. llj grains to the ton, and paid
regular dividends; while, during the last twenty-five
years, the “ Black Hill ” lode, at Ballarat, has been made
to pay well for an average of about 3 dwts. Numerous
cases of large dividends being paid from poor n et's could
be quoted.
At no place in Australia does quartz appear in larger
quantities than at Ophir, and gold can be obtained from
the stone along the entire face of the exposed reef, which
is over 40 feet in width. This quartz could be followed
from the surface at the bottom of the “ Bluff ” into the
hill, thus affording at once hundreds of thousands of tons
of quartz for back stoping, and permitting its being
obtained at a minimum price, therefore it is contemplated
to work these huge reefs by means ©f modem appliances
and labour-saving machinery. Rock Drills, driven either
with steam or compressed air, when used to bench off the
quartz, will lessen the ordinary cost of mining fully one-
half, and the admirable position for crushing machinery,
immediately contiguous to an inexhaustible and pure
water supply, guarantees the most efficient means of
saving the gold and auriferous pyrites, as well as the
cheapest means of crushing.
By reference to plans supplied, it will be seen that the
leases and machine site adjoin one another, except where
Damper Street appears. The sole right to mine under the
street has been secured by Mr. Slater, so that the area
available for the Company is actually more than 44 acres.
The machine site is embraced in the offer of the property to
the Company, but the area is not included above. Mr
Surveyor Blacket’s report follows with others. The actual
distances of the workings on the enormously rich veins in
the Belmore Company’s ground from Mr. Slater’s boundary
are there set out. J
A thorough examination of the property has been made
by Mr. Norman Taylor, the well known and talented
Victorian geologist, whose report also aecimpan.es the
prospectus.
Machinery to crush 500 tons weekly, with patent percus-
sion tables for saving pyrites, stonebreakers, and the
most improved and complete stamping gear, can be
erected and set to work for £7,000.
It has been calculated that the cost of working will be as
follows for one week, viz.:—
To wages of 30 men employed in the mine
raising quartz, &c., at 50s £75 0 0
Do. 3 engineers driving mill 13 o 0
Do. 4 men employed at mill at 40s. ... ." 8 0 0
30 cords firewood at 20s 30 o 0
~W ear and tear of plant and general expenses 20 0 0
Management 10 o 0
Returns. £156 o 0
500 tons of quartz will, at 6 dwts. gold per ton,
yield 150 ozs. This, at the average value
of Ophir gold, say £3 10s. 6d. per oz.,
amounts to 596 5 0
Leaving a profit of ... £440 6 (
or. at the rate of £22,893 per annum; and this profit if
irrespective of large sums obtainable from rich patches
which are certain to be met with occasionally, if not fie-
quently.
It will be seen that this handsome profit is estimated
to be made on the low return of 6 dwts. per ton of quartz,
and that low average is purposely given because Mr
Norman Taylor saw prospects crushed and panned off
indicating an average of 6 to 7 dwts. per ton, but there is
reason to believe that a much higher return mav be con-
fidently expected; and this fact must not be overlooked - a
larger number of stampers than are required to crush 500
tons of quartz per week, when employed, would give even
more than the same proportion of profit on the outlay, as
some expenses would not he at all increased. Mr. Taylor
went so far as to report that the whole hill would probably
pay for crushing.
The terms under which Mr. Slater offers this magnifi-
cent property to the Company are—£2,soo cash and 7,500
shares fully paid up, out of the total number of 25,000
shares, and the only other charges upon the Company’s
funds will be for usual brokerage, printing, &c.
Early application should be made for shares, as a large
number has been applied for privately.
The quartz being simply ready for quarrying at a
moment’s notice, and no dead work to be done, the right
is reserved to declare the Company formed when 12,000
contributing shares are allotted, as it is very desirable to
give the order for crashing machinery without any delay.
In the event of the Company not being formed, deposits
will be repaid in full, to applicants.

tranches of industry, and the daily increasing travel-
ling popnlation, necessarily rendering By<ah)ey one of the
great badness centres of this part of 1 h.e world, suffi-
ciently justifies the fullest confidence in tho project.
San Francisco, a city in no great degree larger than
Sydney, possesses upwards of twenty fir it-clasa hotels,
six of them being much more extensive than that now
proposed; and the superior accommodation and general
arrangements to be found in these es tablisbments,
cause them to be most extensively patronised, and a
source of large profit to proprietors.
SITE.
The valuable corner of Charlotte Place and Jamieson
Street, possessing extensive frontages to both streets,
together with some adjoining property, has been secured
by the Provisional Director#, This Bite is in close
proximity to the leading thoroughfares of ohe city, the
tranerd Post Office, Public Buildings and the principal
wharves. It has the farther advantage of ocoupyicg
an elevated position, and being adjacent to the Sydney
approaches to the proposed North Shore Bridge.
The proprietors have pnt the above properties nnder
offer to this Company for the sum of £13,000.
DESIGNS
for the Hotel will be obtained as soon as the Company
is declared to be formed.
It is estimated that the cost of the building will
amount to £45,000, and the cost of furnish ng to about
£15,000. In the selection of a design, the greatest care
will be taken by the Directors to secure the latest im-
provements in Hotel accommodation.
BUILDING.
It is proposed to erect a building to contain about 253
rooms of different kinds, including the following :
Large Office and Vestibule
Visitors’ Dining Boom
~ Drawing Boom
Public Dining Hall, and smaller Dining Rooms
Correspondence and Reading Room
Billiard and Smoking Boom
Private Sitting Booms
Suites of apartments for families
Hairdressing Booms.
„ D is proposed that a Post, Telegraph, and Telephone
Offices, shall be opened in the building, as also an office
for the sale of Railway, Tramway, Omnibus. Theatre,
and other tickets.
It is anticipated that the Hotel will contain 200 bed-
rooms or thereabouts, hot and cold water being laid on
to each room, and the house will be furnished through-
out with every regard to oomfort.
The most modern Cooking and Kitchen appliance
Passenger Lift lauding at every floor, and a Lues
hoist, will also ba provided.
It will ba seen from the above figures that the csti-
mate of total cost, to include freehold site iu close
proximity to the principal thoroughfare of the city
building and furniture, will not exceed £73 030, and it
is not therefore expected that more than thirty shil-
lings per share (or £75,000) will be required.
An estimate of the probable receipts and expenditure
carefully compiled from data furnished by managers of
hotels, may ba seen at the offices ot the Solicitors and
Brokers to the Company, showing an estimated profit
of nineteen per cent, on the capital contemplated to ba
called up. It may therefore be confidently assumed
that with proper management, and after providing for
all possible contingencies, the shareholders may
reasonably expect a dividend of from twelve to fifteen
per cent, per annum, on their investments.
The Provisional Directors are aware that the man
agement of the Hotel is one of the most important
matters they have to consider. Looking, however to
the fact that the success and rapid multiplication of
high-class hotels in America and Europe, conducted bv
Joint Stock Companies, have educated - a largo number
of persons as Mana«ers cipable of conducting such es-
tablishments, the Directors feel confident that either
m America or elsewhere, they will be able to secure a
first-class Manager, with competent Assistants, whose
knowledge will enable him to conduct tho Hotel on the
most efficient and economical principle.
Upon 35 003 shares being applied for, the Compa
will bs considered formed, and will be registered und
the Companies' Act, when a General Meeting of Shai
holders will be called for the adoption of Articles
Association and the election of Directors.
Investors attention is directed to the fact that there
are no Promoters’ Shares, and that no charges are in-
ourred except those necessary in the formation of the
Company.

Sydney, the great and glorious metropolis of
this hemisphere—that is the straight way to speak—
wants a big hotel, one that will cover a couple of acres,
and which will give accommodation to royal foreigners,
who want to see our harbour and The Bulletin.
Sydney has a chance now, of getting such a hotel.

Victoria sends seven competitors to take part in
the Six Days’ Bicycle Contest at tno Exhibition Build-
ing, Prince Alfred Park, commencing on Saturday. We
hear there is a big disagreement over the affair, the
Sydney clubs having declined to eater professional
contests. On the other baud, it is alleged that some of
the Sydney men do not caro to risk defeat. Any way,
the public will have a look at the affair.
Major Anderson, of the 50th regiment, tells a
Masonic yarn about the Transvaal war. Ho says that
an English officer, terribly wounded, was just about to
have his soul wafted over to the other shore, through
the agency of a Boer bullet, when in despair he gave
fhe'Masonic sign of distress. The Boer was a Mason,
understood the sign, and instead of finishing off the
Englishman, carried him off (to a place of safety under
a galling fire.
Almost every steamer that arrives from America
brings some novelty for which the Yankee is now
famous. One of the latest introductions to the colony
is the “ Harwood Fibre Chair Beat," with which article
any person, even a child, can, with a few ordinary tacks,
re-seat any old furniture, and which, when once pro-
perly in position, will outwear two of the very best
cane-seated chairs. Messrs. Nioholls and Co., Clarence-
street, are the agents for this useful and economical
article.
Mrs. Florence Anderson, the enterprising person
who, with her husband, runs, at Middle Harbour, the
•‘Home for Destitute Boj s," so dexterously described
by the S.M. Herald of Tuesday (and so handsomely
eulogised by that journalistic mule, the Sydney D.T.),
is a stout, and by no means unkind-looking
lady with a very fresh face, a rather harsh
voice, and a very broad pair of shoulders. She has,
during the last few days, been constant in her attend-
ance at the various city newspaper offices, and has
manifested an anxiety for the presence of reporters at
the "institution,” wbieh can only be accounted for on
the supposition that somebody having announced his
intention of impugning her bona-fldes, she wished to
secure, as far as possible, the ear of the Press. The
D.T. people, having long ears, she had no difficulty in
grasping them for a start. She came to this office, the
other day, and told us that she was Mrs. Anderson, of
the Destitute Boys’ College, that she was inviting the
newspapers to inspect her institution, and that she
wanted someone there who’d write the truth—which,
of course, we at once interpreted as a compliment to
ourselves. She proceeded to state that the show was
run on strictly philanthropic principles: and, though
it had been insinuated that she and George (Mr. Ander-
son) "did well out of it," financially speaking, the fact
was quite the reverse. "You see," she said, "I have
some money of my own. The other day I sold some
Melbourne property for £BOOO, so I’m quite independent
in the matter." On oar enquiring how the "home"
was maintained, she gave us to understand that the
bleeding public didn’t find all the money, but that she
canvassed for subscriptions occasionally and had
bean more than tolerably successful. "I know I
am a good business woman. Pve sold over £90.000
worth of laud daring the last eighteen months or
so, and I can deal with any man in
Pict-streot.” Mrs. Anderson is a most deter-
mined looking woman. When she speaks on behalf of
the concern, she says “ I." Mr. Anderson we have
never seen, bat when he acts as the mouthpiece of the
institution, he probably says " we." Mrs. Anderson
dresses well and speaks the Queen’s English indiffe-
rently—which facts, oonpled with her statements as to
her business transactions, led us to suppose that she
might possibly be rich. Her account of the circum-
stances leading up to the institution of the Home is,
in the light of the Herald article, somewhat enter-
taining. Her husband, she says, came to grief at
Bulmain, through good-naturedly backing a bill. She
bought at auction some books belonging to a defunct
old gentleman, which books were almost entirely on
philanthropic questions. These books interested her
deeply—they enthralled her. " When I started to read
one of them I couldn’t jstoo till I got to the very end
At last I said one day, * Gaorge, don’t yon think we
ought to start something philanthropic ?’ ” And they
started something accordingly. Mrs, Anderson told us
on Monday, after she had been maligned by The
Herald, that “ the hoarding out officer put
all those things in the boys’ mouths. The
Herald article ia all one sided—there’s not a bit of
fair play in it. We’ve spent £3600 on the place, and no
one can say we’va ever used for our own purposes a
penny of the money collected. It will break Mr.
Anderson’s heart —he had no business to go near the
Herald The boys who did all this were turned away
f;om our place for committing an unnatural offence on
a calf, but you musn’t say anything about this in the
napee. W e didn't profess to stuff the boys with Bibles.
Tfle reporter who wrote the artio’e is a sactimonions
fellow. We don’t interfere with the religions belief
of any of our boys. People who go round with the
Bible are always in the Insolvent Court,” &o. &e.

sufficient inducement is offered them the way of
numerous entries, liberal prizes will be offered. Another
meeting will Be held in July, 18$3.
The athletic clubs held a meeting l last week, to
present the prizes won at the late sports’ meetings.
Mr. Eaper, the captain of the N.S.W. football team,
was present, and was enthusiastically received. A pro-
posal was entertained to lease eleven acres of land at
Waterloo, for a term not less than 21 years, for sports
meetings.
N.Z. cricketers are puzzled to make out 'the
meaning of a Ranter’s cable from Australia published
in their papers, announcing that the visit of a team
from Maorilftlld would not be entertained in Australia
this season. No one had authority to make any such
proposal, and the cable announcement was the first
heard of it.
The Carlton and Corio Clubs, the latter with
Vo men,met on the Domain on Saturday. The Corio went
to the wickets and scored 180, M. Hoare playing a fine
innings for 52; J. Smith 20, W. Burton 14, W. Smith
13, C. Melly 12, and S. Dnnoan 11. being the otherdouble
figure scorers. When time was called, Carlton had lost
one wicket for 37, the scores being— V. Nunn (not out)
17, J. Callachor 11, C. Bush (not out) 9, The match is
therefore a draw.
The beating Auckland gave N.S.W. in the
return football match proved conclusively that the
result of the first tussle in that town was
no fluke. Our team were completely out-
matched, and badly beaten, the score at the finish
being:—Auckland, three goals and two tries (18);
Sydney, one goal (4). Baper handled his men well. In
the evening, the team was eatertained at a social re-
union by the Mayor and bon-ton.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team play in Sydney on
December 1,2, 3, and 5. The Australian Eleven will
not be here in time to allow the N.S.W. contingent to
take part. The return intercolonial match is fixed for
the second week in February. The Australian Eleven
and the English team are to play in Sydney on 26th
January and following dare. When the English team
return from New Zealand in March, they are to play a
N.S.W. eleven, instead of the combined team.
The Croydon and Victoria Clubs commenced a
match on Saturday for the Furness Junior Cup. The
Victoria made 62 in the first innings—Crisp, 20 being
the only double figure scorer. The Croydoos made 57
M. Carroll 14, and Evers 13, being highest scorers. In
the second innings, the Victorias lost five wickets for
95—the scorers being Crisp (not out) 39. Leggo 17, and
Pitt 11. The match will be continue 1 on Saturday,
and if concluded early, the Rugby an ii. id wick clubs
will enter upon their game for the Cup.
The Warwick Club, which is supposed to be
the weakest of the senior clubs, taokleu fifteen of the
Surrey United Club, the winner of the Junior Cup last
year, on their own matting, and got rather easily de-
feated. The Warwicks, who had a bad team, made 71
A. Gregory 35, A. Newcombs 26, being the highest
scorers. The junior club, despite the attacks of
Ogilvy, got 79 for the loss of seven wickets—J. Searle
22, Newcombe 22, Watkins (not out) 22, doing most of
the business. The Warwicks had better go in for the
Junior Cup after this match.
At the Tamworth Spring meeting. Gladiator
won the Plying Handicap. The Prince of Wales Stakes
was appropriated by Reform. Hopeful carried off the
Race Club Handicap, Spina wav won the Hack Race,
and The Wit eh the Borough Handicap. A dead heat
took place for the Major’s Cup, between Hopeful and
Hesitation; in the run-off,Hopetul won by half-a-length.
Reform pulled off the Novel Race. Little Nell, Old
Gold, and Idea ran a dead heat ia the Forced Handicap;
in the run-off. Old Gold triumphed.
In the return football match at Wellington, the
N. team only arrived, after a rough passage, at
1.40 p.m. the day the match was fixed tor, and com-
menced play at 3.30. “ Our boys” played a plucky game
all through, and on one or two occasions, although they
could have touched dewu in self-defence, refrained from
doing so, and contested every inch of the ground. The
Wellington men played well, but were overmatched.
The N.S.W. team owe their success to the splendid play
of Baper, Flynn, Richmond, Fligg, and Walker, the
latter especially eliciting cheer after cheer for his excel-
lent defence of the goal. The score was:—N.S.W.,
eight points; Wellington, nil.
The University and Albert Clubs continued their
match for the Holdsworth Cup on Saturday, on the
Association Ground The Alberta increased their score
to 222 —M’Nell 63, Moses 49, D. Gregory 31, Q. Mur-
doch (not out) 31, Bailey 19, being the principal scorers.
The University team was disposed of in the second
innings for 151 run*—Coates 34, Powell 24. Pope 21,
Lord 14, Thomas 14, Barif 12, Wright 10. The Alberts
have but 45 runs in the second innings to make to win,
and the match is a certainty for them. This will necss-
sitate the round of matches for last season to be played
out to ascertain whether the Albert or University
teams are entitled to pre-eminence for the first season.
Tha history of the old rac ihorse, Guy Fawkes,
now doing duty at the stud of Mr. Sbndholme, Canter,
bury (N.Z.), is a bit romantic. When Guy Fawkes
was bom he was sold to Inspector Emerson, of West-
land, for £3O That gentleman leased him for racing
purposes to Mr. Redwood, and in one year he won £2500
in stakes alone. Eventually work told on him, and he
broke down, notwithstanding which Mr. Emerson sold
him for £7OO to Keith and Lyford, for stud purposes,
and Mr. Studhoime, a runholder of South Canterbury,
subsequently became and is now his possessor, but
keeps him fer his own mares only. It is said that the
veteran has thoroughly recovered, and that it is not
improbable he will face the starter once more. His
present owner has been lately olfered £IOOO for the
despised foal of former days.
The attendance at the Paddington Eifle Butts
during the N.S.W. Eifle Association matches last week
was larger than at any previous meeting. The Inter-
national Match was won by the Australian team, the
scores being Aus'ralia, 634; Scotland, 619; England,
614; and Ireland, 614. Captain Linsley was top score
in the Queen’s Match, with 175 points, entitling him to
a £ls prize. The Grand Aggregate Match for twelve
highest scorers in the Queen s, Ladies', and Members’,
Matches, was won by Sergeant Furness, with a total
of 293. He also wen the Members’ Match with a total
of 67. The Press Match was won by Mr. P. C. Trebeck,
of that humorous and sparkling publication “ Trebeck’s
Pastoral Circular.’’ Mr. W. H. Sutter won tha Parlia-
mentary Match, with a total of 39. Mr. Roseby got
22. Mr. Snttor is not a teetotaller.
About 18,000 people attended the Victoria
Amateur Turf Club meeting at Caulfield on Saturday.
Sportsman was made the favourite for the Hurdle
Race, which was won by Lord of Clyde, Merry Maid
being second. Delusion won the Nursery Handicap
after a splendid race with Duenna. Thirty-two horses
started for the Caulfield Cup. Assyrian was made a
hot favourite, bat did not show up in any part of tha
race. Verdure held the lead till near the finish, when
.Little Jack, the St. Alban’s pony, came through and
won by a length. The Findon Harriers was appro-
priated by Blackthorn, Clansman, the favourite, being
nowhere. Napoleon was made a big favourite for the
Steeplechase, but, refusing at the first fence, he lost
all chance. Sailor, Erin, and Collingwood made a
great race, resulting in favour of Sailor by two lengths.
The Windsor Handicap resulted in a win for Prome-
theus by about a length.
The following gentlemen have been appointed a
selection committee until the end of tne year
Messrs. H. M. Faithful], J. W. Fletcher, and T. Nunn.
Selection committees have never been popular, and this
is about the most unacceptable yet appointed. In the
first place, Mr. Faithfull does not know the players,
and is never seen on the practice ground; consequently,
he can have no discretion in the selection of blood
if required. Mr. Fletcher being a likely candidate for
selection (and deservedly so), ia placed in an invidious
position, because he may have, eventually, to vote for
or against himself. Mr. Nunn knows the players and
their capabilities, but he is one in three. We have
always aavo3it,d the selection being placed at one man's
discretion. 'Jhey do it in Victoria, and it answers.
There is one man here who coaid, and would, pica the
best team without prejudice. That man is Dave
Gregory.
The N.S.W. team had much good luck ia the
football match against Canterbury, woa by a goal and
i try by Sydney. The Sydney men never had a show in
dribbling or scrimmaging with them after the first ten
minutes, but it was jnat this tea minutes or so that
spoiled Canterbury’s cnanoes of winning. Playing well
together from the start the Australians rushed their
opponents, and backing up beautifully, had scored a
goal before the game had well begun; soon after
they had got anotner try through the disjoiated play
of the backs ; bat ever after that they had, altogether
the worst o( it. The Sydney men ware loud in praise
of the dribbling of their opponents, but their own back
play and smartness at collaring were admirable. Their
forwards were overmatched, bat, l*ing active to a
degree, they gave few chances of getting through them,
and the Canterbury backs scarcely played up to concert
pitch Which is their great weakness.
A well-known colonist and thorough sportsman,
jast returned from a trip to the old country, says that
he never felt ashamed of being an Englishman until he
attended the late match on the Oval between the
Australians and the Gentlemen of England. The
applause from the spectators, who numbered about
20,000, was confined wholly to the English players,
laud and discouraging remarks being freely uttered to
• 0 Australians while in the field; and, at the conclusion
of the game, which ended in a decisive victory for the
Cornstalks, the small band of Australian colonists
got together and gave their representatives a hearty
cheer—the English fair play-loving crowd maintaining
a dignified silence. _ It is about time that this absurd
old term of “ English love of fair play” should be ex-
posed in its true colours. It is a well-known fact that,
throughout all the tours of the Australian teams, the
best man they have had to play against was the
English umpire. That’s the straight way to put the
matter.
. s .o ( George Perkins, the Young Englishman, isjto
row M’Donald. George, who is under the care of the
redoubtable Harry Divis, of the Harbour View Hotel,
Dawes Point, says he is going to row a straight race,
a fact which certain cynics affect to regird as a
remarkable occurrence auong professional scullers.
A .paragraph in our last issue, gave the reasons
of Perkins's retirement from the Punch Trophy
contest, and he has stated his intention through the
medium of_ the columns of the Echo —an evening journal
published in Sydney—to “show the public what he can
do. Well, we have seen Perkins sonll, and we believe
he can do a lot. But we are not sure of it. There seems,
“O we lT* r » to be an opinion amongst the knowing ones
that George will give his adversary a “doingand the
race, which is to come off in three weeks, will be inter-
esting, it only for the extraordinary rumour we have
mentioned at the commencement of this par. Both men
are in full training for the match ”np the river.” The
*?®tchisfor £75 aside, with the option of making it
£IOO, and is fixed for 4th Nov.
The play in the football match, N.S.W. v.
Otago, was undoubtedly in favour of the latter, who
kept the ball at Sydney’s end during the whole of the
game. The Otago forwards completely carried the
packed and loose scrimmages, taking the ball in the
held time after time. The Sydney backs, whose passing
has been so highly spoken of, lost ground almost
always when they had recourse to it, as the opposing
forwards were on them at once. For Sydney, Mann
and Esper played perhaps the most dashing game,
while Flynn, Graham, andßayliss were also prominent.
The wind spoilt the play greatly. Very little kicking
could be indulged in by either side, and it was ex-
tremely difficult, almost impossible, to keep the ball in
a line with the goal posts. Tee score at the finish
stood : —Otago 11 points, Sydney nil. One of the two
disputed touchdowns was awarded to Otago, but in
accordance with the New South Wales rules ao try for
fu g 0 ? 1 ,T as a^o wed, because two Otago men had touched
the ball down. Otago therefore won by one goal and
two trios and one touch-down to nothing. In the
evening the visiting team was entertained at dimner.
Mr. Eaper expressed a strong desire to see a New Zea-
land team in New South Wales next season, and a hope
that in such case, a more satisfactory match might
result. 8
The third annual regatta of the N.S.W. Bowing
Association was held over the champion Course, Parra-
matta Elver, on Saturday last. The attendance was
very poor, and proves the little interest now taken in
amateur aquatics. The Prince of Wales, steamer, was
filled by members and their friends, and
the Pacific carried the umpire. The weather was most
suitable for rowing, the light N.E. breeze not interfer-
ing with the pullers. The first race, for maiden four-
oared gigs, was advertised to start 3 o'clock, but, with
the delay characteristic of the oarsmen of the pre-
sent day, it was fully 3.39 before the five boats faced
the starter. True, the North Shore representatives,
were at the post to time, and the starter would have
been justified in despatching them alone on their
jouniey However, at 3 30, the five hoats-Glebe,
North Shore, 2 crews from the M.E.C , and the Eoy.ton
College four—drew up to Blaxland’s Point; but, as
both the two former were determined not to obey the
orders of the starter, that official promptly and
properly disqualified them. When the flag fell, the
Glebe and North Shore were lengths ahead of the
Otherajand although the stroke of the G.E.C. broke
the blade of his oar aoon after the jump, they led from
*0 fl msh; N.S.E.C., 2nd; M R C , private crew,
3rd; M.E.C., representative crew, 4th; Eoyston Col-
lego last. The two first having been disqualified,
the prize is taken by the M.E.C. private crew!
Ar e x> nex £ raoe (Schools) was a row over for
tne Eoyston College boys, who won the race
last year. The third race, Sydket Mail prize,
for seniors in outriggers, brought out Messrs. Brett,
Arthur, Thompson, and Qaden. The course was from
Chanty Point to the Brothers. Brett had the south
shore, and for the first 300 yards his left scull was
bp the mud, and he was aim >st aground.
After passing Uhr’s Point, he caught Arthur, and they
crossed over to tho EyCe side. At the mile point Brett
was in the wrong water, but by Arthur giving way. a
foul was saved. Arthur led past Putney, where Brett
went over to the southern shore, and all interest in the
race was over, the men being so wide apart. The pace
was very slow all the way, Arthur eventually passing
tbs Brothers ten lengths ahead of Brett Gaden and
Ihompson, although they finished the course, wore
never in the race from the start.. The race for juniors,
in four-oared outriggers, produced about the worst
rowing ever witnessed on the river. Three crews
started-the SEC., 6.EC, and M.E C. The latter
rowed ene of their best senior oarsmen, and some
notica of this should be taken by the committee. The
course was from OieMm Wharf to Blaxland’s. The
nag fall to a level start, and then ensned a scramble of
two!ye oars, the steering being equally at fault. The
H. o _ w Ob by a ° ou P le of lengths, M.E.C. just beating
tne S.K.C. by a few feet for second. There being no
entry against the S.E.C. for the Challenge Eight, they
rowed over for the Cup, which, having been won three
times, is now their property. Mr. Thompson set his
men a pretty stroke rowed well out, and thosa who
remained to see the “E. 0." were well repaid. The
arrangements made by the committee and offiaora were
well carried out.

CHEAPEST DEAPEES IN AUSTBAIU.
SOCIAL.
The Hospital Ball at Coonamble was a financial
success. Some of the drosses were costly, some sensibly
simple. “ Cherry Eipo,” was an exact representation
of that pretty picture, and was charming. "Fortune
Teller" was conspicuous, and 11 La Folie" and a “ Lap-
land Peasant’' suited their characters well. Many who
might hare done an act of grace by attending, were
con ipiouous by their absence; while the chariness of
the assistants at the table, when asked for anything,
was not a pleasing feature. If fancy-dress is preferable
at one time more than another, it is when a cheap, yet
neat dre s. is made for a charity ball, and many might
copy the example of the lady who, as a “ Housemaid,"
looked in her pretty plain print as only a lady can.
* * *
Adelong Quadrille Assembly met in Hodson’s
rooms on the 6th, and about three-score of visitors ex-
hausted a good programme of dances. Mr. Simeon's
mnsic was gwod. A brunette in cream and cardinal,
with short sleeves, was attractive; so were two sisters.
A dark lady in black and cardinal danced well, and a
tall fair lady in pale blue added a charm to the room.
« • *
Some of the Bnndaberg ladies are spirited. At
a private party in the Victoria Hall, the other night, a
certain clique of the " haw-haw “ stamp selected a few
partners for the whole evening, and ignored the exist-
ence of everyone else. The neglected walked out of the
hall in a body, and the “ cream ’’ were left so much
unset by this unexpected retaliation that they didn’t
finish the programme. The extreme solectviess they
craved tor came too muchly.

Next week the great annual show of dress and
fashion commences at Melbourne. The Flemington
lawu ou Cup Day is the gayest scene in the southern
hemisphere; and on the last of this month, if the
weather bo lino, the display of gorgeous robes and glow-
ing colours is expected to bo the grandest yet seen. All
the leading costumiers have large orders to execute, and
among the variegated costumes, the new ficelle hue will
probably be more prominent than any other. There
will be the usual gaieties inseparable from the season
—among other events, a ball at ;Government House,
where Commodore Erskine and the Governor of Tas-
mania ace to be guests.

Mrs. H. E. Way’s dance at “ Lymerston,”
Cook’s Elver, ou Friday last, was enjoyed by nearly 150
guests Excellent n-maio was supplied by Do Qroen,
assisted occasionally by others, and the large room was,
both as regards Qoor and ventilation, admirable, albeit
rathur full; but the cool shades of a long avenue served
as a safety valve and found great favour in the intervals.
The hostess looked charming in white satin; two petite
young ladies from Surry Hills were as nice as possible,
or nicer—one wearing cream satin and lace (the belle
of the evening), the other in pale pink and ivy leaves.
Their graceful dancing contrasted well with the
laboured efforts of some others. A plump little maiden
from Woollahra looked dainty in white cashmere
trimmed with blue; two sisters from Eandwick pleas-
ing in black satin and white llama, respectively; and
the wife of a young lawyer prettily clad in white satin.
Programmes provided 20 dances till 3.30 a. m ; supper
and rest at midnight; and appreciation of the hospital-
ity of Mr. and Mrs. Way was warmly expressed.
* • *
As is usually the case at Parramatta, the
Bowing Club Bali held there on Friday was largely
oompo.-ed of people from Sydney. The special car was
soon filled with saiin-olad sirens, and many ladies, with
their attendant cavaliers, conspicuous for very eloan
obins and vast areas of shirt front, stormed the ordinary
carriages and packed away where they could. A good
number of guests also came from both up and down the
line At the Hall, about 2500 of the leading residents
of Parramatta had assembled, and the guests had a
jnpst gratifying reception. As they walked up the
long path (thoroughly laid with matting), many free
and original comments on their appearance were made
by the influential members of society through whom
they processed, and the remarks were edifying, even if
not pleasing. It was only by shear hard work that
the Masonic Hall, in its unfinished state, was ren-
dered fit for use; time had scarcely permitted of
decoration beyond a few flags—singularly shabby ones,
too ; but the floor was clean and smooth, and the
gentlemen's room was comfortably situated on the side
of a hill, with a canvas roof and a tarpaulin carpet. The
hall itself is lofty and large, with another large com-
partment Joined on to it by an open arch, which was
used for rest and refreshments, and most convenient it
proved. At 0 o’clock dancing commenced, and at 4
o’clock next morning, twenty-six dances had been
accomplished. Now wa will turn the handle and start
the procession. A married lady from Bent-street has
one of the choicest dresses, rich ruby velvet bodice
skirt of pale straw satin and lace, all beautifully made,
and worn with a white wreath. Miss Shepherd is an
Archer in green and white, and her beaux are all in a
quiver, for she dances well. A picture of prettinoss
comes from Aberorombie.street in amber satin, and
from Cambridge Terrace two finished dancers, who are
allowed no rest. Mrs. J. J. Nicholson is a blonde in
her bridal robe of chaste white satin, and long veil.
A pair of little brunettes from Erskine street ate
among the prettiest—one in black and gold, at Li
Pepita, and the other, a very round young lady, in pink
<sfttij» and sunflowers. Miss Davies was charming in
yellow satin and blaok laoe, with Elizabethan ruff, her
black hair decked with marigolds and buttercups ;
while Mii-s Eva wore Mr. Forrester’s colours as a
jockey. Mischief was impersonated by Miss Oakes,
who was ever so pretty in blue satin dress and bonnet.
Mr Harris was All-Pours, covered with cards; and
W J- Crew was supposed to be a Venetian Gmcle-
Hean, fbough one might look till he was Venetian
blinu without ever discovering how a red flannel
• aaC and blue stockings made the character.
Mr. Harry Hamilton was a picturesque Glen-
earthy; and Mr. W. Sohwartzkoff, as a Mid-
shipman; K. 0. Willis, a Knight Templar; and
Mr. Moss was Kyrle Daly. Trump Card was the ohar-
t>Mar of a young gentleman from Brush Farm. We
never «nw anything like it before. We don’t believe
ttuyoias else ever did. Only a soul-inspired gouias of
the most original kind could have conceived the idea of
sticking a pack of cards, with spangles glued on them,
on to pink calico, putting a sword between his legs, a
girl’s croquet-party hat on his head, and calling him-
self Trump Card. Miss Little was a sailor; Mias Fer-
guson, the Maiden all Forlorn, her title worked on her
pkirt; and Miss Ashby was Bomp, her title on her hat.
(}rg(ie Darling was a slender lady, who carried a life-
buoy One side, and did her best to keep another boy
ou the ot,n*>r tide. Handsome dresses of delicate brown
pUJc and lust*# were worn by two sisters from Black-
tf.own. And Peprffch was represented by two more.

The management of the dances during the
evening w. w vested in Mr. Ernest Needs, who filled his
position with politeness and tact. The comet was an
at traction in the early morning, and many couples went
cut to v i-w it. In almost every case, the lady showed

The second annual pionlo of tho Mercantile
Marina at Botany was even better than the first. Over
400 people were present, and not a circumstance oa- I
curred to tinge the proceedings with unpleasantness.
Special trams were put on both out and home, and I
many persons used private vehicles. The programme
consisted of an oyster snack on arrival, dancing, games,
luncheon at 2.30 with speeches, coffee and ices at 5,
home at dusk. Dancing started at once, to the Young
Australian Band, who rattled merrily through twenty-
four numbers, and the floor was supervised by Mr. G.
Hunt as M.G., who understood the art of being brisk
without being brusque, and was a favourite accordingly.
Out in the air contented spectators watched the sports,
where purple-visaged captains chased the football at
imminent risk to their sea-legs ; city merchants of
weight played themselves into a high state of perspira-
tion and colour over the gentle bowls ; and mates and
agents ran foot races at a reckless speed they had
never ventured on, probably, for a quarter of a century
past. It was rumoured that one portly pedestrian
accomplished 100 yards in the almost incredible time of
2osec., but the record cannot be considered authentic
The marine element was strong, there being, as a wall-
known little character, who braves the storms of Port
Jackson, said, at least, “twenty-five ships present.”
Here, on a level patch of sward, was the burly skipper
of the Gettysburg, commanding a crew of croquet
players, and insisting on the posts being rigged
“ straight fore-an’-aftwhile a bit to loo’ard his com-
pters of the Escort and Majestic assist fair ladies by
surreptitious kicks, when he is not looking, to steer
through impossible hoops. The shipping clerk of a
large firm, and a lady in green sateen, walk round with
that demure dignity which especially characterises
newly-married pairs. A commission agent cavaliers
the two pretty daughters of a land auctioneer, in pretty
sateens and big summer hats. A handsome brunette,
under a Patience hat, is temporarily in possession of
the gallant captain of the Cimba; while “ Captain"
Dan “takes tops" in a sot with the commission
agent’s wife, who is good-looking and deliciously
dainty in her garden dress. A light maiden
in sage green flits round like a feather; and
a contrast of white polonaise and vivid scarlet
underskirt seta off one of the brightest young faces.
When luncheon came, exercise had sharpened appetites
so much that, amid the clash of cutlery and babel of
tongues, not a single parson recollected to “ say grace.”
Frank Smith was observed to be saying something to a
waiter who dropped a dish of “spuds,” but it wasn’t
“ grace.” When Q. A. Lloyd suddenly remembered
the omission, he turned alabaster pale, and earnestly
begged Playfair not to say anything to Jefferis about it.
The Chairman, Oaotain Finister, insisted that speeches
should be cut down to the briefest; and so they were.
Even Sir John said scarcely anything, at least, not any-
thing that meant anything; for when a veteran politi-
cian talks ai out “ ladies’ bright eyes,” it may be safely
inferred he has no intention of torshadowing Govern-
ment policy. Thanks to the pruning process the
speeches were subjected to, the audience were spared
the usual unsufferable bosh about a “ Parliament which
will compare favourably,” and so on—you know the
rest. Mr. Lloyd gave a sentence or two of trite truisms;
and Mr. Eethel, in his one-minute speech on Municipal
Institutions, conveyed the novel information that they
*• keep all our streets in good order." Being conscien-
tious, we hesitated at this toast, more especially as we
regularly read the Council reports; but, after all,
perhaps it was better to dissemble (people do some-
times, at dinner) so we swallowed the toast, together
with something the waiter put in our glass, and shouted
“’ooray I” witn the rest. The statement of Captain
Peter, of the Duchess cf Edinburgh, that the “wharfage
accommodation of Sydney is simply abominable,” was
a piece of straight talk that drew a round of applause
from the long-suffering mariners. And it was scarcely
good taste of a gentleman who did not like it to inter-
rupt the speaker, and fussily leave the table On rising,
sports were resumed till nearly dark, and then the
National Anthem was the signal for an exodus home.

annual meeting, held on Tuesday night, accounts were
submitted and officers were appointed tor the ensuing
year. A motion was carried to the effect that a branch
swimming club, consisting of pupils of Bt. Phillip's
Grammar School, who are desirous of being affiliated
to the PJ. Club, should be recognised. Mr. Pern (an
eminent English swimmer, who was, on one occasion, in
the water with Captain Webb for 60 hours) was elected
an honorary member. By the way, Walter J. M'lndoe,
of Melbourne, who recently beat our representative
swimmer, Mr. Corbett, in a 1000 yards’ race (swum in
