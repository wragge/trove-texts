Ever said “boo” to an irate goose? Someone at
Ballantine’s once did, and lost the argument. As a
result, the famous Dumbarton Distillery installed
a unique burglar alarm—7o white geese. All dedi-
cated to help protect Ballantine’s against intruders.
Disturb even one of them and a harsh cackling en-
sues, summoning the entire bodyguard. Their shrill
cacophony is guaranteed to stop any trespasser
in his tracks and quickly alert the authorities.
A clock-round watch by the Ballantine’s geese
ensures that the forty-two whiskies, mostly from
the Highlands, that lie in oak casks in the vast
warehouses, can mature in peace; can mellow in
the moist Scottish atmosphere undisturbed.
Expertly blended, these whiskies will one day
become Ballantine’s —the Superb Scotch.
Is it worth taking all this trouble to protect
Ballantine’s? Try it, see what you think!

Model of Cultural Centre
At St. Kilda Road, Melbourne, seven acres of concrete foundations have been laid for the
National Cultural Centre. Between concrete sections are waterstops manufactured for the
contractors by Dunlop to stop water seepage and ensure the safe future of the foundations.
At the Sydney Opera House site Dunlop flexible cement chutes, known as ‘elephant trunks’,
speed the concrete into place.
Across the Derwent, in Hobart, and across to Bribie Island in Queensland, builders are using
Dunlop bridge pads between spans to absorb vibrations over the entire length of the bridges.
Dunlop Technical Service representatives too, assist the building industry on similar projects
throughout Australia. When you contract with Dunlop you get an on-the-spot working
partner right from the planning stage.
Wherever the building industry is in action—so is Dunlop.

National Notebook
C ensorship
e learn from Germany that
~ " museums have, for the Queen’s visit
there this week, been asked to conceal
first editions of Schiller’s “Maria Stuart”.
GGS’s PR
Tt is fascinating to note how the modern
school goes into action. Geelong
Grammar has waged a vigorous cam-
paign to raise £350.000. Now the cam-
paign committee has sent out a 45 rpm
record to all “old boys, parents and
friends”. Melbourne Grammar did this
once before, but not with the same polish
and style.
The record is a talk by the headmaster,
Mr T. R. Garnett. There are no requests
for money. On one side he thanks all
for their work and help with the appeal.
On the other he talks very convincingly
about the aims and future of his boarding
school. And he’s good. As someone put
it, very Richard Burton in style.
Altogether 4400 records went out.
Cost: £BOO. Expensive, but as a public
relations venture it should pay off.
First and Last
TTFithout much fanfare or any
v " financial assistance from the
Federal Government, the local version
of the Peace Corps—Australian Volun-
teers Abroad —was still able to attract
700 applicants last year, of whom 29
were chosen. When we spoke to the
scheme’s director, Jim Webb, he told us
about a young Arts graduate from Sydney
University, Tim Chapman, the volunteer
secretary of the Port Moresby Workers’
Association headed by leading indigenous
politician, Oala Oala Rarua. Mr Chap-
man is helping to organise meetings,
prepare agendas, keep records, attend to
membership enquiries and guide the
organisation’s administration. One of the
largest voluntary associations in the Ter-
ritory, the PMWA, is the basis for the
trade union movement of the future.
“The important thing is that Tim
Chapman is taking his orders from
indigenous bosses, he is living in a wholly
non-European suburb at Hohola in Port
Moresby and he is becoming deeply
involved in the needs of a key organisa-
tion,” said Mr Webb. This kind of help
will also be extended to other voluntary
associations, local government councils
and co-operatives, giving indigenous
officials the opportunity to prepare for
independence.
There are other volunteers —l7 in
Papua and New Guinea all of whom
work for “break-even” wages at local
rates, getting a small allowance and
their fares paid by the Overseas Service
Bureau, the organisation which directs
the volunteer scheme. Until 1963 the
Warden of Melbourne University’s
Union, Mr Webb is now the bureau’s
full-time director. Growing out of the
original Volunteer Graduate Scheme for
Indonesia which started in 1951, the
bureau currently has 37 volunteers work-
ing as teachers, tradesmen, scientists and
office workers in Asia, Africa and the
Pacific, and is kept going by the con-
tributions of individuals and trusts.
There is a touch of irony in Mr Webb’s
comment.
“We’re still a long way behind
countries like the USA with 10,000 in
the Peace Corps or Britain with 1000
graduates abroad, or the Canadians with
200 and all receiving some form of
government assistance. Our scheme
started earlier than any of the others
and we were in a real sense the first
Peace Corps. But we’re also the only
ones not to have been granted some form
of government assistance, apart from the
fares of graduates who used to go to
Indonesia.”
Partners in Defence
Tt was just like old times when the
Americans arrived in Melbourne for
the Coral Sea celebrations. General Dean
C. Strother, Commander of NORAD, the
North American Defence Command, had
his covey of uniformed PR men. They
handed out Press kits, photographs, in-
teresting topics for discussion with the
General. There were even tapes of music
by the NORAD band for the radio
stations with numbers like “Waltzing
Matilda” and “Partners in Defence”.
Learning From Mistakes
T>erth theatre enthusiasts are excited
at the WA University’s plan to
build a £124,000 theatre early next year.
Profiting from mistakes made with the
New Fortune Theatre, modelled on those
of Shakespeare’s day the University has
invited Sir Tyrone Guthrie, the Irish-
born authority on the Bard, to advise
on the new theatre.
Sir Tyrone, probably the greatest
living producer of Shakespeare’s works,
will arrive in Perth next month from the
Minnesota Theatre Company at Minne-
apolis, where he is artistic director. He
has been associated with the planning of
many new theatres and was administrator
of the Old Vic and Sadler’s Wells from
1939-45 and director of the Old Vic
from 1951-52.
Professor C. J. B. Clews, the univer-
sity’s deputy vice-chancellor and a mem-
ber of the Festival of Perth committee,
sees further profit in Sir Tyrone’s visit.
“We will seek his advice on how to de-
velop future festivals, particularly in re-
lation to Shakespearean production and
drama,” he said.
"Lionel, just to be on the safe side, I think you'd better unload minerals
and oil exploration and get into fixed trusts or Government bonds."

Long Thirst
npHE six o'clock swill in New Zealand
pubs is on the way out, but at the
present rate it will take even longer there
than it is taking in Victoria. The present
Government’s policy is not to extend
drinking hours without a referendum.
Indications are, however, that a fear of
losing some votes will prevent it being
made an issue before the next general
election in 1966.
Both this Government and Labor
might be prepared to decide the issue
without reference to the people. It is
unlikely that the word referendum will
be contained in the policy of either
party at the next election.
There have been slight but significant
recent changes to the licensing laws.
Licences have been granted to some
restaurants, and hotels can serve liquor
with late meals.
The latest approach to the Government
is from golf and bowling clubs which
want to serve liquor up to 7 p.m. inclu-
ding Sundays. Should these applications
be successful, the door will be open for
other sections of the community—
farmers and shift workers particularly—-
to present their case.
A recent front-page article in the
weekly tabloid “Truth” underlined how
one group already enjoys the special pri-
vilege of bar drinking after six o’clock.
The police have a canteen operating at
which liquor is sold from 7 p.m. to 10
p.m. on Friday and Saturday. This has
been instituted under a little-known
clause in the Sale of Liquor Act, 1962.
Brisbane Invasion
VXThen the students of the University
* ’ of Queensland move out of St
Lucia for their August vacation, 750
women will move in for the first world
conference of women graduates to be
held in Australia.
Dr Dorothea Sandars, the Brisbane
parasitologist, has been the chief hustler
in getting the 15th triennial conference of
the International Federation of Univer-
sity Women staged in Brisbane. In 1961,
Dr Sandars had the conference awarded
to Australia over Israel and Greece. In
her submission she was able to point out
that the Queensland Government was
willing to back an international confer-
ence to the extent of £5OOO.
Since her appointment as international
convenor of the conference in 1962, Dr
Sandars has worked at it non-stop. She
has: obtained 8500 dollars from the
Rockefeller Foundation to bring seven
top international speakers to Brisbane;
arranged with the Queensland Tourist
Bureau for 35 exclusions to be available
to visitors before and after the confer-
ence; appointed 12 conference conven-
ors to arrange hospitality, accommoda-
tion, amenities, publicity, etc.; and in-
vited and received an acceptance from
Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, to
be conference patron.
The theme of the conference will be
the population explosion, on the face of
it an unlikely one for university women,
who don’t have a notably high reproduc-
tion rate. However, the theme is offici-
ally given as “The Impact of Population
Changes: Social and Educational Impli-
cations”.
Apart from the main lectures,
women graduates will be able to indulge
in what Dr Sandars describes as “aca-
demic tourism” with a choice of six
“special interest circles” dealing with
Australian art and architecture, Austra-
lian literature, our primary industries,
our outback, Australian Aborigines, and
our medical and biological sciences.
These “tourists” will actually see their
special interests. For instance, those in-
terested in architecture will be taken to
see old and new style homes.
Brisbane graduates are being asked to
invite visitors to spend a “typical Austra-
lian day” in their homes. A typical out-
door da}' will be spent (inevitably) on
the Gold Coast to show visitors our
beaches, porpoises and birds. There will
be more formal wine and dine entertain-
ment and outside groups are co-opera-
ting by presenting Australian plays and
special concerts.
Conference dates are August 19-26
with an inaugural public meeting on
August 20 in Brisbane's City Hall.
Inspiration \
Sydney woman Nuri Mass was so in-
spired by the introduction, of a new
religious syllabus for NSW primary
schools last August that she set about
writing a book for children, outlining the
world’s major religions. However, as a
result of pressure by some of the Chris-
tian Churches, the syllabus was quickly
withdrawn, but has now been reintro-
duced in a modified form.
Miss Mass kept on at her task through
all the controversy and her book, “Many
Paths —One Heaven”, has just been pub-
lished. The book sets out the main
principles and history of Hinduism,
Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Juda-
ism, Islam, Sikhism and Christianity.
Miss Mass said she had also tried to
make some comparisons and point out
similarities, on a level which children
could understand.
“Many Paths —One Heaven” is pub-
lished by the Writers’ Press which Miss
Mass founded some years ago. In the
early days Miss Mass did her own print-
ing, but has now handed that over to
a commercial firm. The Writers’ Press’
last publication, “The Wonderland of
Nature”, a book on natural science for
Australian science, has gone through
three reprints since it first appeared a
year ago.
THE FUNERAL OF MARCUS CLARKE
ffij&ulietCa
80 Years Ago: May 23, 1885
lyfAßCus Clarke has been much
talked of recently, since his
widow’s reappearance on the Sydney
stage. It rather exasperates one who
knew the gifted writer, to find all this
fuss made about him, when it is of
no value. We can afford to think
very little of the gushing sympathy
over “poor Marcus”, when we find
that the Memorial volume—an awful
piece of literary work, but with the
merits of which the public are quite
unacquainted—hasn't sold worth a
cent, and lies in Cameron, Laing and
Co.’s cellars. It is so cheap to whine
over the dead, because they can’t ask
us for the loan of a pound, or trouble
us for that billet we are working to
get for our bullet-headed, red-haired
nephew, and for which our vote is to
be bartered. The story of Marcus
Clarke's life—and the writer knows
many of its ins and outs —cannot yet
be truly written: it would be too
terrible for those still living. Can-
dor makes us say he was nearly as
much to blame as his enemies. A
man who had less idea of the value of
money never lived. Once he went to
the Melbourne journal with which he
was connected and represented that
the bailiffs were in his house, and
that a £lo-note alone would exorcise
them. It was forthcoming. Marcus
at once forgot all about bailiffs, who
were real enough, and went to the
Governor's ball that night, where, of
course, he shone. Unfortunately for
himself, he turned upon the men who
had befriended him, and who were
still ready to back him up, and used
his matchless power of satire to bring
them into ridicule, which was never
forgotten or forgiven; even in the
cemetery grave. When he was buried
in the Melbourne cemetery—what a
dismal, dreary, rainy day it was! and
what a condition some of the princi-
pal mourners were in! Hardly one
of those with whom he had been first
associated on the Australian Press
attended!

"A fallout shelter? What are you trying to do to our image in Asia?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Grand Gesture
HThe proposal for an Australian-New
Zealand coi.'mon market, put to
the Federal Parliament last week by
Mr H. B. Turner, deserves a better
fate than to be pigeonholed in the
aftermath of benign bi-partisan agree-
ment. The proposal is obviously in
the best interests of both countries.
As Mr W. C. Wentworth pointed out
in The Bulletin as long ago as 1962,
the New Zealand economy is a very
vulnerable one: her internal market is
limited and any sudden blockage of
export outlets could create a desperate
situation. It is only her rich natural
resources and her export outlets which
have given her a high living standard,
and when Britain, her main market,
joins the European Common Market
which is only a matter of time
New Zealand’s way of life will be
undermined. She will need Australia
badly.
But we also need New Zealand.
With our more diversified economy,
a larger population and less depen-
dence on export outlets to pay for
our imports, we may be in a stronger
position to withstand the same pres-
sures, but we, too, have much to gain
if our domestic market were merged
with New Zealand's. It would repre-
sent an increase, as Mr Wentworth has
pointed out, equivalent to 20 years of
our immigration programme.
This justifies the “grand gesture”
that Mr Turner has called for. The key
factor is that officials in the Industries
and Commerce Department of the New
Zealand Government have indicated
that establishing a common market (or
even, as Mr J. McEwen prefers, a
limited free trade area) would mean
one-sided concession a curb on
New Zealand’s industrial develop-
ment in exchange for a doubtful future
gain from Australia. Combined with
a general sensitivity and understand-
able fear of being swallowed up by
Australia, they have been no more
diplomatically pleasant about the pros-
pects of any genuine breakdown of
barriers in trade. Certainly Mr
McEwen’s announcement that, under
the envisaged limited free trade area,
the. duties on dairy products will be
maintained to protect the Australian
dairy industry cannot give the New
Zealanders very much confidence that
we take the idea of closer relations
very seriously.
Yet we need the “grand gesture”, we
need it now, and it ought not be restric-
ted to the dairy industry. For example,
there is immediate sense in Mr Gough
Whitlam’s suggestion that we use New
Zealand’s cheap electricity and they
use Australia’s bauxite deposits for the
development of a joint aluminium in-
dustry.
Nor should proposals be restricted
to trade. Both Australia and New
Zealand need more than “great and
powerful friends” for our joint security.
Until recently there was little which
tied us together other than historical
nostalgia and the increasingly vague
links of the Commonwealth, but the
last few years have presented both
countries with the necessity to come to
terms with regional realities and the
waning of economic and defence ties
with Britain.
If Australia does not make the
“grand gesture” which recognises
these realities now, we may well find
that we are again too late. New
Zealand almost federated with Aus-
tralia 65 years ago; it is still possible
to make up for the missed opportunity.
But the initiative must come from us.
Mr Wentworth was thinking along the
right lines when he recommended that
the next Governor-General be a New
Zealander.
The Eight Per Cent
11/Ir Arthur Calwell’s call for a
national enquiry into poverty in
Australia is nonetheless deserving of
public support because he exaggerated
the problem by referring to the “two
million poor”. In fact, as Dr George
Zubrzycki pointed out last week, Aus-
tralia compares quite favorably with
countries like the United States or the
United Kingdom as far as poverty is
concerned. According to the definition
of minimum basic needs developed
by the British sociologist Professor
Peter Townsend and applied to
Australian figures by the Professor
of Social Administration at Ade-
laide University, Professor R. G.
Brown, eight per cent of Austra-
lian households are in severe need
compared with 14 per cent in Britain
and at least 20 per cent in the United
States. But whatever may be the case
abroad, eight per cent is far too high
for us. Eight per cent means 600,000
Australians, from about 230,000
households, have a standard of living
below what we consider to be the
minimum for human beings.
Dr R. T. Appleyard, in an article on
page 26 of this issue (based on his St
Mark’s lecture in Canberra), refers to
three of the main groups involved:
families whose needs are not met by the
basic wage, pensioners and civilian
widows, and town Aborigines and
this leaves out the handicapped and
chronically ill. These make up a
far graver problem than is implied
by the standard expression “pockets
of poverty”, and Mr Calwell put it
well when he said: “The modern
poor are to a very large extent the in-
visible poor. Because we do not see
bread-lines, because beggars appear
only infrequently and furtively on our
streets, the suggestion that there is
serious or widespread poverty in our
community, accompanied by deep and
genuine hardship, humiliation and suf-
fering both mental and physical, is
shrugged off with a smirk of positive
disbelief.”
It is not as if there is not plenty of
material available about the Australian
poor, but it occurs in little-known
studies or unpublished theses. A
national inquiry would bring all the
evidence together, dramatise the prob-
lem and prepare public opinion for
the necessary community and govern-
ment action.
L.B.J.
President Johnson’s handling of
Vietnam and the Dominican crisis
has allayed any fears that this expert in
domestic politics may be inadequate
in foreign affairs. He has obviously
learned from the mistakes of the past.

Checkmate for the Kingmaker
Senator Kennelly’s other moves for DLP pact
G. WHTLAM
P. KENNELLY
J. KANE
By BRIAN JOHNS
CANBERRA Labor men have
been intrigued by recent, almost weekly'
visits to Sydney by the Victorian Labor
veteran, Senator Pat Kennedy. The visits
commenced soon after Senator Kennedy’s
maverick cad for an ALP rapprochement
with the Democratic Labor Party at the
declaration of the Senate poll in Mel-
bourne early this year. Labor men who
speculated that the visits were to rally
support were right. In the months since
his cad, Senator Kennedy has made a
round-robin of Right-wing Sydney unions,
to little effect. But his most ambitious
project has been to enlist the active sup-
port of the DLP.
Having been rebuffed on his move
within his own Party, Senator Kennedy
once nicknamed the “kingmaker” be-
cause of his power in the ALP want-
ed an uncontestable testament to the
necessity of healing the DLP rift. He
decided to enlist DLP backing in a
desperate move to save the NSW Labor
Government.
At first, he entertained asking the DLP
for the dramatic gesture of giving pre-
ferences to the NSW Labor Party in the
last election. After a series of talks with
DLP officials, Senator Kennedy came
forward with an alternative proposal
that the DLP should not contest vital
marginal seats where the Party’s prefe-
rences would ensure Opposition victo-
ries. This would have ended Opposition
hopes of winning Government, as the
election result proved the crucial nature
©f DLP preferences in at least six seats.
Senator Kennedy received an unequi-
vocal answer from the DLP in the Party’s
State policy on April 12. The policy made
clear the DLP’s determination to bring
Labor to its knees . . . “The Government
of this great State must not be allowed
to remain in the hands of men who have
shown so little courage and principle.
In fact the DLP believes that a return of
the Renshaw Government on May 1
will not only increase its present sub-
servience to Left-wing policy and pres-
sure, but will indicate that the people of
this State are prepared to underwrite its
cowardice.”
However, the major point at issue
between Senator Kennedy and the DLP
was how the ground should be prepared
for the ALP and DLP to come to the
conference table. Both Senator Kennedy
and the DLP agree that the extreme Left-
wing of the Labor Party must be isolated
probably to the extent of yet another
split—before a successful rapprochement.
Senator Kennedy believed that he could
achieve this by rescuing the Right-wing
NSW Government. But the DLP, with
bitter memories of the unrewarded sal-
vation of the Cahill Government in the
mid-'fifties when the bulk of the “Grou-
pers” stayed in and “fought”, were
convinced that the State ALP would
have to be purged by electoral defeat be-
fore there was a real chance of isolating
the Left at both State and Federal
levels.
Senator Kennedy’s failure with the
DLP was his second major setback in
recent months. Earlier, he had canvassed
members of the Parliamentary Party to
see if he could secure the numbers for a
successful move against the Leader of
the Opposition, Mr Calwell, who, at the
news of Senator Kennedy’s cad in Feb-
ruary for a rapprochement had repudiat-
ed his long-time Victorian colleague in
one of the strongest denunciations in me-
mory. Senator Kennedy’s Caucus canvass
fell well short of the numbers required to
remove Mr Calwell from leadership.
Surprisingly, Senator Kennedy was not
supporting the Deputy Leader of the Op-
position, Mr Whitlam, whom he had
helped to the ALP leadership ranks, but
the NSW front-bencher, Mr Fred Daly.
In the Kennedy plan, Mr Whitlam would
remain at his present post.
Senator Kennedy’s anti-Calwell move
was only part of a continuing general
unease with the leadership echelon of
the Federal Parliamentary Party. Labor
men cannot recall their leadership being
so bedraggled. In Senator Kennedy’s own
House the leadership has been rebuffed
and is under challenge. The Leader
of the Opposition in the Senate,
Senator McKenna, at the recent Hobart
Conference was unable even to secure
election from his home State as one of
six delegates to the ALP’s coming Fede-
ral Conference in Sydney. At the same
conference Senator Kennedy, as Deputy
Senate Leader, was unable to address Tas-
manian delegates. And at the recent
Brisbane ALP Convention, significantly
dominated by the Left. Mr Calwell re-
ceived two thrusts. The Leader of the
Queensland Labor Opposition, Mr J.
Duggan successfully moved a motion
setting a 70-year retiring age for all Par-
liamentarians, which would affect Mr
Calwell, and Mr Duggan was among
57 delegates who voted against a motion
supporting Mr Calwelds opposition to
Australian troops in Vietnam.
In this -atmosphere of discontent over
Parliamentary leadership among Left and
Right, a small group of Federal mem-
bers are planning for a spill of Senate
leaders in the first week of the Budget
session in mid-August. Their flashpoint
will be the admission of the group of
newly-elected Senators. The dissidents
claim that an August election would be
justified by the entry of the new mem-
bers, but they well realise that any move
against Senator McKenna and Senator
Kennedy would inevitably bring about a
spill of all Parliamentary offices, includ-
ing Mr Calwell’s position as Leader.
The meit planning the August move
come from Right and Left. The ALP
Federal Executive meeting in Canberra
on Monday, and the Federal Conference
immediately before the first meeting
of Caucus in August, could well bring
further support to the group’s initiative.
Three of the four Parliamentary Leaders
will be involved in skirmishes before the
Federal Executive. Mr Calwell is being
held to his rash call for an inquiry by the
Federal Secretary, Mr Cyril Wypdham,
into controversial statements allegedly
made by Mr Whitlam in March, and the
executive will call Senator Kennedy
along with WA Labor Opposition Leader,
Mr Hawke —to account on his DLP issue.


At present, informed sources believe,
perhaps optimistically, that Mr Calwell
might find himself with the full support
of only one Executive membei, the West-
ern Australian, Mr F. E. Chamberlain.
It is not believed at this stage that the
Executive will direct any concrete move
against Mr Calwell, but he could well
take away from the meeting the real im-
pression that he is no longer wanted as
parliamentary Leader. So both the Exe-
cutive and Conference meetings could be
set-pieces to the August move in Caucus
to overthrow the leadership,
Apparently, Mr Calwell is well aware
of the dangers of the coming weeks. With
the help of an old Victorian Parliamen-
tary colleague, he set the canard of an
early Federal election a canard credu-
lously seized by some political journalists
in an attempt to forestall any un-
rninent moves to threaten his leadership.
KNOPFELMACHER
“Alarming and Revolting”
A Nobel Prizewinner's judgment on Sydney University
By SAM LIPSKI
SYDNEY After last week’s public
meeting protested in the most moderate
terms against Dr Knopfelmacher's rejec-
tion at Sydney University, one of his
supporters remarked that the meeting
had been called not so much for Dr
Knopfelmacher's sake—there being little
left to do on his behalf—but for the sake
of those who, like Melbourne poet and
academic, Vincent Buckley, were “ap-
palled” at Sydney’s action and felt that
they had to publicly voice their feelings.
Yet even those among the audience
and speakers who had come to praise
Dr Knopfelmacher—certainly not to
bury him or the cause of academic
freedom—found themselves uncertain at
the end of the meeting whether they had
attended a requiem mass or whether this
was the beginning of a continuing, pro-
testing, if probably one-sided dialogue
with Sydney University.
This may have been partly due to the
mildness of the resolution passed at the
end of the meeting (with 4 votes against
in an audience of about 100) which ex-
pressed concern at the limited and inade-
quate procedures the board adopted in
considering the appointment and sug-
gested that the board might have decided
differently if it had considered the appli-
cation more carefully.
It may also have been due to the way
SIR JOHN ECCLES
in which the meeting broke up with
many feeling, "Well, what happens
now?”
What happens now depends partly on
how Sydney University reacts if Dr
Knopfelmacher applies again for the
same job which will be readvertised.
It may be that the final position on
the board—4B professors against 7 for
rescinding the original rejection will
remain. The “final seven” were Profes-
sors D. Armstrong (Philosophy), R. N.
Spann (Government), S. Goldberg
(English), A. P. Martin (Dentistry),
H. R. Edwards, A. R. Davis (Oriental
Studies), and A. J. Dunston (Latin).
But since most of his supporters be-
lieve that any reapplication is already a
lost cause what happens now is much
more a matter of what steps those who
think an injustice has been committed
will take to prevent a repetition of the
affair.
In different ways all the speakers
agreed with Mr E. St John, QC, when
he said that the Professorial Board had
raised the central cause for disquiet by
not referring the appointment back to
the selection committee for further con-
sideration.
Professor Sibnorayan Ray, Head of
the Department of Indian Studies at
Melbourne University, felt that acade-
mic ethics had been violated in a way
quite unparalleled during his 15 years
of academic life in Britain, India, the US,
and Australia.
The board s "hardly credible” behavior
had challenged his notions of the Aus-
tralian sense of fair play and he felt it
would have a deterrent effect on the
international academic community. If the
recommendations of an expert selection
committee were to be rejected out of
hand by a professorial board in an at-
mosphere which raised doubts about pro-
cedure he thought the reputation of Aus-
tralian universities would suffer.
Associate Professor Henry Mayer from
DR F. KNOPFELMACHER
Sydney University's Department of
Government agreed that the board's pro-
cedures had been unfair, ill-considered
and indefensible. While the university's
staff selection procedures had to remain
pretty informal", one way to guard
against a future injustice would be to
insist that in the event of any dispute the
board should be required to examine
every publication submitted with an
application. If in extreme and extraordi-
nary circumstances the board did not
refer back an appointment to the selec-
tion committee then it should have a
special majority, say two-thirds, before it
could reject an appointment outright.
Vincent Buckley pointed out that not
only had the board acted in an unpre-
cedented way, but it had not given the
selection committee any reasons. It could
have said that the selection committee
was incompetent, or corrupt, or guilty of
nepotism or deficient in some other way.
But it had not given any of these reasons.
Professor D. McCallum, Professor of
Political Science at the University of
NSW, opened the meeting by reading a
strongly worded condemnation of the
board's procedure from Nobel Prize
winner and Professor of Physiology at
the Australian National University, Sir
John Eccles. In a message to the meeting,
he had described the situation as “alarm-
ing and revolting”. "I am unable to
understand how the academic body was
persuaded into adopting a line of action
contrary to the well established proce-
dure in cases where there is disagreement
with a recommendation, namely, to refer
the matter back to the selection commit-
tee with appropriate criticism. Instead
they rejected the recommendation, so
violating normal canons of procedure
and demonstrating the personal antipathy
that motivated the instigators of the
action.”
The Economics Editor of the “Can-
berra Times”, Mr Peter Samuel outlined
the reasons for the “personal antipathy”
towards Dr Knopfelmacher. Much of it.


he said, was based on ignorance and
hearsay; some of it, simply because he
was a genuine original fitting into no
easily classifiable category, showing no
known syndrome.
And there was of course his political
effectiveness which had so antagonised
his opponents that they had gone to very
great lengths to keep him out of Sydney
University. The result was that outside
the university there was a widespread
feeling that Dr Knopfelmacher had been
“done in” and the university had emerged
with a “stinking reputation”. Defending
the right of the Press to report and to
comment on the affair he said that any
suggestion that it had no right to do so
was “dangerously authoritarian”.
The same night the matter was raised
in Parliament. Mr K. Cairns (Lib., Qld)
said that the professorial board had run
the political measure over Dr Knopfel-
macher. The issue was one of academic
freedom and could not be droppejL
Mr W. Wentworth (Lib., NSW) said that
the rejection was organised by a small
political clique and was done on politi-
cal and not academic grounds.
Dr M. G. Mackay (Lib., NSW) un-
expectedly emerged as spokesman for the
“fuddy-duddy” element on the Profes-
sorial Board when he defended its action.
He referred to an occasion two years ago
when Dr Knopfelmacher’s appearance
on a television programme (which he
chaired) had “antagonised” him.
Besides, the appointment of an anti-
Communist like Dr Knopfelmacher
could be a two-edged sword which would
open the way for Communists- to seek
appointments in universities. With this
example of logic, Mr G. Bryant (Lab.,
Vic.) found himself in warm agreement.
UNIONS
The Odd Cog
AWU Stand In Victoria?
MELBOURNE The danger of the
State President of the ALP, Mr Holt, not
being able to attend the Victorian party’s
annual conference has once again focus-
ed attention on the odd and sometimes
creaking machinery which the 1965 ALP
is forced to use. Delegates to the annual
conference must come from either a
State electoral council, of which there are
66, or from an affiliated trade union.
The influence of the iarger Left-wing
unions is strong because a membership of
up to 500 entitles a union to one delegate,
500 to 1000 allows two delegates, and for
each extra 1000 they are allowed addi-
tional delegates. The Communist-control-
led Australian Railways Union is thus
able to send nearly 20 men. The only
officials who may attend apart from
union and electoral council delegates are
the State Secretary and Assistant Secre-
tary. Many parliamentarians and influen-
tial branch members are able to attend
because union delegates do n.ot have to
be members of the union they represent.
Some unions elect delegates from their
own numbers by a full ballot, others
allow the union executive to make the
decision. Union executives frequently
choose those who are best able to pro-
mote or defend the executives’ ideological
positions men who are big names or
effective public speakers. Thus the situa-
tion has arisen that president Bob Holt
has attended his own State conference
not by virtue of his office but because he
has represented the AWU.
The AWU decision to boycott this
year’s conference has caused Holt the em-
barrassment of having to chase around
the Trades Hall for a vacancy on dele-
gation. However, despite his brushes with
unity ticket promoters in recent months,
he still has enough support in the less
extremist Leftist unions to be certain of
gaining accreditation.
The decision by the Victorian branch'
of the AWU to withdraw its 11 delegates
has been taken by some as a sign that
the years of its passivity are over. In fact
it is most unlikely that the leaders of the
Victorian AWU will go much further in
assisting their northern comrades in the
battle with the Chamberlain-Cairns axis
in the ALP. They have shown neither
the mind nor the heart for this fight
before. It is safest to interpret their deci-
sion to avoid the ALP Conference as a
lukewarm gesture of unity with the Fede-
ral AWU than as a declaration of firm
and long-range intentions. It also has the
advantage of keeping the AWU out of
any tactical battle at the conference be-
tween the present executive of the ALP
and its enemies.
ALP
A Fissure Becomes a Chasm
The Queensland Convention
TOWNSVILLE —When the Labor in
Politics Convention ended last week the
■'‘fissure between the AWU and the Trades
Hall group created during the Mount Isa
dispute had become a chasm. Shocked
ALP politicians admitted openly that the
convention had been a bitter disappoint-
ment. They said that many useful agenda
items had been discussed and that sev-
eral fine speeches had been heard. How-
ever, as one politician said: “How can
we go out and win an election when the
public realises there is disunity in the
Party? We are beaten before we start.”
Although the Federal Opposition
Leader, Mr Calwell, and his deputy. Mr
Whitlam, spoke at the convention, the
three dominating figures were the leader
of the militant Trades Hall group of
unions in Jack Egerton, the Federal
President and State Secretary of the
more moderate AWU, Mr Edgar Wil-
liams, and the Federal Secretary of the
ALP, Mr Cyril Wyndham. There were
early clashes at the conference between
the AWU and the Trades Hall group,
but the pressure seemed to ease off after
the Trades Hall, because of its great
voting strength, emphasised clearly that
it was in firm control of all ballots.
Then on the Thursday, Mr Egerton and
Mr Williams clashed in an incident that
seemed at times likely to come to blows.
It came after the convention chair-
man, Mr Bert Milliner, State ALP
President, said in a surprise address that
he wanted to reprimand the “delegate
who handed out a certain circular”. In
angry scenes that followed Mr Egerton
was accused of being behind the pamph-
lets which were described as being bit-
terly anti-AWU. One prominent AWU
official said: “They already have the
victory on the ballots. Why put the boot
in?”
Mr Egerton at first denied that he had
anything to do with the pamphlets but
then said that they had been printed by
the Queensland Trades and Labor Coun-
cil. Mr Egerton is president of the
Left-wing council. After saying this,
Mr Egerton strode to the rear of the
convention hall and returned with an
armful of green-colored circulars. He
started to hand out some of them to
delegates sitting nrar him but was
ordered to sit down by Mr Milliner when
howls of protest were hurled across the
hall by AWU officials. Mr Williams
jumped to his feet and stood gripping
the table at which he had been sitting.
He glared angrily across :he room at
Mr Egerton, then he suddenly walked
to the back of the hall. Moments later
he returned with some of the green-
colored pamphlets, ripping them up as
he walked. Before he sat down he threw
the torn pieces of paper out of a side
door. Mr Milliner was able to restore
order only by yelling repeatedly over a
public address system. The clash be-
tween Mr Williams and Mr Egerton
ruined any chance of unity at the con-
vention.
Mr Wyndham, the young Federal
Secretary of the ALP, gave a fluent
address to the 137 delegates. He said
that he planned to make certain pro-
posals to the next meeting of the ALP
Federal Executive aimed at party re-
organisation. It is believed that Mr
Wyndham, a former member of the
British Labor Party, aims at allowing
wider representation at the ALP Fed]


eral convention in August and, as in
Townsville, even to open the Federal
convention to the Press. He is ex-
pected to face strong Left-wing opposi-
tion when he makes his move in about
two weeks. Generally, Queensland ALP
delegates to the Townsville convention
favored Mr Wyndham’s move.
The sensation of the whole convention
was a remark by Mr C. T. Vickers,
Queensland Colliery Employees’ dele-
gate, that his union, the Full Council
of Miners’ Federation, and other mili-
tant unions would give “full support” to
stoppages by the Waterside Workers’
LORD ROY THOMSON
Federation aimed at forcing the with-
drawal of Australian troops from South
Vietnam. “I do not see why the Ameri-
cans should not be humiliated and forced
to withdraw from Vietnam,” he said.
The following day, Mr Phil Healy, the
Waterside Workers’ delegate, said that
his federation had no plans to call
stoppages aimed at forcing the with-
drawal of Australian troops from Viet-
nam. Mr Healy said the ACTU had
vetoed this move, but he added that
watersiders would hold stoppages of
short duration until the Australian
soldiers were in the field.
R. MURDOCH
PRESS
Breaking the Sabbath
Thomson , Murdoch and the NZ Govt
AUCKLAND —Sunday newspapers
this year are a foregone conclusion for
New Zealand, but just as certain is the
tight hand of Government control against
overseas interests entering the field.
Largely under pressure from New Zea-
land newspaper proprietors, Keith Holy-
oake’s National Government has com-
mitted itself to legislation this coming
session which will permit a newspaper to
be printed and delivered to homes on
Sundays. (Present legislation allows
newspaper sales on Sundays from shops
only, and prohibits printing after 7 p.m.
on Saturdays, as well as door-to-door
deliveries.) It was these same newspaper
proprietors who pressured the Govern-
ment last year into preventing the take-
over of the Wellington morning daily,
“The Dominion”, by Canadian news-
paper magnate Lord Roy Thomson.
Takeover bids were made by Thom-
son, Mr Rupert Murdoch, of the “Mir-
ror” group, as well as by New Zealand
Newspapers Ltd (publishers of the
“Auckland Star”) and Wilson and Hor-
ton Ltd (proprietors of the country’s
largest circulation daily, the morning
“New Zealand Herald”.) The Govern-
ment made it clear to both Mr Mur-
doch’s and Lord Thomson’s representa-
tives that it would not allow overseas
ownership. The justification put forward
for this was that a foreign proprietor of
a major organ of public opinion and in-
formation in the capital city would be
harmful to the best interests of the
country. Mr Murdoch’s representative
proceeded to buy up a substantial num-
ber of shares in “The Dominion”, and
Lord Thomson late last year acquired
an Auckland publishing firm, Breckell
and Nicholls.
Although a Sunday paper has no clear
legal right to exist in New Zealand, an
Auckland firm, A. D. Organ Ltd, began
publishing a tabloid, the “'Sunday News”,
last year. However, last week Truth NZ
I.td, in Wellington, announced a takeover
of the “Sunday News” publishers, and
according to the managing director of
Truth, Mr J. N. Dunn, the “Sunday
News” would continue to be published in
Auckland and Truth would publish a
Sunday paper in Wellington. This is the
first step in the Sunday newspaper war,
and Truth’s move is obviously aimed at
a semi-national paper, with two editions,
making provision for late news pages in
both cities. No other firm announce-
ments have been made for the establish-
ment of a national Sunday newspaper,
but Mr Murdoch through “The
Dominion” will initiate publication of
a Sunday newspaper for North Island
distribution. Moves are being made to
obtain the necessary staff, and the first
issue is planned for early July—as close
as possible to the first anniversary on
July 15 of Mr Murdoch's “The Austra-
lian”.
Both Auckland newspapers have pub-
licly “expressed interest”, but no more. It
is known, however, that a joint Sunday
newspaper is being considered by these
two major firms, and through NZ News-
papers Ltd’s South Island daily, the
“Christchurch Star”, such a paper would
be made national in character. Smaller
NZ proprietors are also making plans to
publish Sunday editions.
Lord Thomson has said in London a
Thomson Sunday paper would be “a
great asset to New Zealand”. It would be
similar to London's “Sunday Times”. At
this stage, it looks as though Lord
Thomson’s entry into New Zealand will
be frustrated by the majority feeling in
Government that Sunday papers should
be largely controlled by New Zealanders.
And there is another factor involved in
this besides pressure from NZ pro-
prietors. It is a very real desire by Gov-
ernment to avoid the harsh glare of a
really aggressive and critical newspaper.
Mr Murdoch, however, has been
playing a waiting game. He has wisely
not shown his hand and his influence has
not yet shown itself to a great degree in
the pages of the staid "The Dominion”.
While the Government can limit overseas
participation in Sunday newspapers, it
can hardly suggest to Mr Murdoch that
he dispose of his substantial sharehold-
ing, or even some of the shares. Once the
necessary legislation is passed, the next
move would seem to be up to Mr Mur-
doch.

University versus Press row (8., April
10), dismisses the idea of either passing
or failing an examination as “unsound
in the knowledge of the way human I
ability is distributed”. Instead Dr
Petch urges a grading system for each
subject, as well as what he calls a
“student profile” the scholar would
carry a record not only of his grading
in the public examinations but of his
school’s assessment of his application to
work and his general ability in the
subject.
Two of his schemes that will have a
harder time being accepted are the
scheme for increasing examination entry ■
fees to meet the increased administra-
tion costs involved, and for extending
research by the Public Examinations
Board. This study, he says, should in-
clude analysis of candidates’ ages, the
type of school they came from, and so
on. In the past some schools have
closely guarded their percentage pass rate
in public examinations, and not even
parents have been told.
The first step in implementing the
Petch report was the appointment of
Mr Norman Collins, former Wesley
headmaster, as Director of Public Ex-
aminations. As the board’s chief execu-
tive officer he will start the long job of
listening to the opinions that have been
invited on the report. After the hubbub
of the released-then-suppressed report,
its final appearance has been an anti-
climax. But teachers particularly have
found the ideas sound.

Golden Silence?
Mr Holt in the US
MELBOURNE —The Federal Treasur-
er, Mr H. E. Holt, took about an hour
in Parliament last week to add next to
nothing to the disappointing statements
he made before coming home from his
single-handed economic mission to the
United States. Possibly more reassuring
than anything Mr Holt brought back
from Washington were the messages re-
ceived by the Treasury here from US-
owned local firms while its political boss
was away. Despite the fact that Wash-
ington messages indicate that overall the
US expects its balance of payments to
benefit by about 1.2 thousand million
dollars- a year as a result of the curbs
on private capital outflow to the listed
22 countries (of which Australia is one)
in the ban, US firms in Australia have
told our Treasury they do not expect
the effect on them to be “appreciable”.
We shall have to wait and see.
In the meantime the “mark time”
order on lending of Australian capital
to overseas firms has been partially re-
laxed; that is, to the extent of allowing
them to make share issues and place-

gested that all and sundry in this field
would be watched. This introduces a new
chapter in the Government’s attitude to-
wards foreign enterprises here. The new
note of discrimination seems at odds with
the object of encouraging capital
inflow, which, after all, was the whole
burden of the treasurer’s song in Wash-
ington.
When Mr Holt repeated to the House
that capital supply would be made
available for US participation he said
nothing about the terms for it. If capital
for the extensive mineral developments
under way here is assured, it would have
been very surprising if the US adminis-
tration had blocked the path for it.
For one thing, such capital is of the long-
term variety and will have very little in-
fluence on the US balance of payments
in the period Mr Johnson is most con-
cerned about. For another, most of the
Australian mineral projects the US is
interested in will gain for that country
a foothold in some of the richest raw
materials deposits still going begging in
politically stable countries.
As to Government loans, it seems to
be about time the Australian Government
took a closer look at the possibilities of
getting some international capital from
agencies such as the World Bank (which
has already poured a good deal of money
into the Snowy project) and the Export-
Import Bank. If Mr Holt explored these
avenues on his recent visit he has been
mighty quiet about it, though the possi-
bility cannot be dismissed.

OIL
The Drain
Finding Storage
MELBOURNE By turning its back
on the need to provide additional oil
storages in Australia as a defence
measure the Federal Government raised
a shoal of criticism in and around Parlia-
ment last week. The basis of the Govern-
ment’s claim that present storages,
equivalent to about 10 weeks’ supply
inclusive apparently of petrol in the
tanks of motor vehicles would be
adequate if coupled with petrol rationing
to see us through an emergency, was that
crude oil production from existing Aus-
tralian oil wells (only one field, Moonie,
is at present in production) could pro-
duce up to one-sixth of national require-
ments.
On the strength of this the Govern-

This may be the longest advertisement you’ve ever
read, but it’s worth it. Enthusiasts throughout
Australia have awaited this moment with a rare
eagerness. The Rover 2000, after 5 years in the
building and “rave" notices by eminent motoring
critics the world over, met with such instant suc-
cess that Australians have had to wait over 12
months for production to catch up with overseas
demand. To make the wait more agonizing, this
extraordinary new automobile added smashing
proof of its glowing reputation by a triumphant
touring car victory in the recent historic Monte
Carlo rally in which only 22 cars finished out of 237
starters. Now it's here and if ever there was a
car you must see and dri.ve to appreciate, this is it.
This is a sleek, lithe, whlppet-like Rover, unlike any
Rover you've ever seen before, yet a Rover through
and through in its impeccable finish and blissful
comfort. It's an extremely quiet motor car with quite
exhilarating acceleration and a top speed over the
"ton". It's designed to lope along all day at 90, so
you can imagine how safe it is at lower speeds.
It has phenomenal handling and cornering charac-
teristics. An entirely new, Rover-developed,
de Dion-type suspension gives it a grip on the road
which is quite unshakeable. English "Autocar" calls
it "a true driver's car that one would itch to take
out of the garage at the least excuse". There’s
probably never been a safer car built. You get disc
brakes, all round. Padding, padding and more
padding. And special 'fail-safe' construction right
through. (Too complicated to explain here but
tremendously important ask your Rover dealer
to elucidate.) It’s immensely strong. Rover sent
three 2000's around 7000 miles of Australia's worst
roads in a deliberate endeavour to break them

fantastic. You can wallow in dust for a hundred
miles and not one speck will filter into the interior.
Even in a dust-storm, streams of cool, clean air
refresh you, controlled by individually-adjustable
air vents in the fascia. The heating is the type used
by Rolls and it's just wonderful. Comfort is lavish.
You’ve seen bucket-type contoured seats in the
front before, but how about in back? The Rover
2000 concept is to compromise slightly with the
comfort of an occasional fifth passenger in order
to provide superlative comfort for four. Your
driving position is precisely your own because not
only is the rakd’ of your .seat adjustable but also
that of your steering wheel. Upholstery
naturally. Trim is African Walnut. If you drive with
the choke out or the hand-brake on or with a
dangerously low brake-fluid or fuel level, helpful
warning lights let you know it. This is an enthusiast’s
car, yes. But it's also a gentleman’s car. And a
lady’s, too indeed. Who can afford it? At £2285
(inc. tax), not everybody. But then many more than
think they can. Because the Rover 2000 is a car
you’ll want to keep for ten years and more. And
it's extremely inexpensive to maintain. Petrol
economy is a remarkable 30 m.p.g. The panel's are
applied to the body in such a way that it's a verit-

means you pay far less for maintenance than usual.

A
ment felt that the cost of £34 million
involved in raising storage capacity to
the level suggested by Sir Wilfred Kent
Hughes and Mr Wentworth' was not
justified. Equally, in the Government’s
mind there was no urgency either in
putting up more money for oil search
subsidies so that known reserves could
stand a better chance of being increased.
The latter is, of course, a national blunder
in itself. But more absurd, as The
Bulletin has pointed out from time to
time, is that we are at present consuming
oil from our present inadequate reserves
at a time when there is a world glut in
petroleum and when our reserves are
high enough to buy our needs.
If overseas reserves are now being
drained at a snowball rate partly as a
result of petroleum purchases, so the
urgency of finding more oil here is only
further emphasised. As Mr Wentworth
said in Canberra during the week, we
face the prospect of having to pay about
£3OO million a year for oil imports in
eight years’ time. As defence measures,
expanded oil storage as well as higher
subsidies also seem to be demanded on
the score of vulnerability of supply
sources and tanker routes which are at
present uncomfortably close to the areas
of most likely peril for Australia.
One suspects that what the Govern-
ment is mainly boggling at is not so
much the cost of the building of
additional oil storages but the imports
cost of the oil to put into them. This
could run into £lOO million, on Went-
worth demands for an additional storage
for 10 million tons of crude oil and
products, but, as he says the money
would not be wasted. It would be a vital
security insurance.
MIGRANTS
Paradise Lost
Surveying the UK settler
CANBERRA . the freer way
of life, open-air life, the climate, the fact
that everyone has an equal chance if
they’re willing to work. I just know
Jimmy and 1 will get on.” These were
the confident words of a 37-year-old
Edinburgh mother before she became
one of the 70,000 assisted migrants who
escape each year from the fog and gloom
of the UK to a new life in Australia.
Her optimism was typical of 900 assisted
migrants interviewed before they sailed
for this country..
The Senior Fellow in Demography at
the Australian National University, Dr
R- T. Appleyard, who carried out the
survey for the Department of Immigra-
tion and the University, is now writing
a book on the migrants’ first 18 months
in Australia. He found that the bulk
of them had looked forward to a Britain-
of - the - South - Seas: “more than one
emigrant believed that he was going to
paradise,” he reports. The biggest sur-
prise for them was the behavior of Aus-
tralians. “Nearly all the migrants were
amazed to find themselves regarded as
strangers or people from another
country,” Dr Appleyard said. “They
expected to find themselves in a country
with the same institutions, culture,
customs and habits as their own. Instead,
they found themselves floundering in a
novel type of society for which they
were completely unprepared.”
By far the biggest problem faced by
the migrants was housing. In 18 months
only 22 per cent had bought homes—
though 31 per cent were home owners
before they left Britain—and those who
could not afford steep rents on the open
market were forced to stay in hostels.
Some were resigned to spending four or
five years crammed in a few poky rooms
in a hostel until they became eligible for
State-built homes at low rental. But the
total income of all working members
of the migrant families exceeded £35 in
42 per cent of the cases, mainly because
49 per cent of wives were working. The
difference between UK and Australian
wage rates showed up clearly—only nine
per cent of husbands earned less money
in their jobs in Australia compared with
the UK, and 44 per cent had increased
their earnings by more than 46 per cent.
Although they brought little capital
to Australia, Dr Appleyard found the
British newcomers quickly tried to reach
the Australian norms of ownership of
consumer durables. Within 18 months
64 per cent of families owned a motor
car (against 43 per cent back home),
48 per cent had washing machines and
71 per cent refrigerators. Perhaps it is
a tribute to the BBC that UK ownership
was higher only for television sets at 58
per cent compared with 44 per cent.
Hire-purchase was quickly adopted.
Only six per cent of families did not
purchase at least one of their durables
on hire-purchase.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Bolte Plays Ring-a-rosy
Protect me from freeway misery
Tust lately in the US there has been
** a revulsion against the worship
of the automobile and the cult of the
freeway. Indeed, according to the
news reports a folk singer called
Malvina Reynolds revels in these
lines:
There’s a cement octopus sits in
Sacramento, l think,
Gets red tape to eat, gasoline to
drink.
And it grows by day and it grows
by night
And it rolls over everything in
sight.
Oh, stand by me and protect that
tree
From the freeway misery.
How fortunate that here in Mel-
bourne we have been able to keep
ourselves almost entirely free of the
misery of freeways. Why, there are
those who say that.for a city of our
size, population, and standard of
living we have fewer freeways than
any comparable place in the world.
Compare our record. Perth has the
Kwinana Freeway, 3.4 miles. Sydney,
including the Cahill Expressway, the
Bradfield Highway and the brand
new North-West Expressway, has 4.8
miles of expressway. You must
understand that New South Welshmen
are a tougher, more practical people.
Freeways cost considerably more
than £1 million a mile, so in Sydney
they tend to call them expressways.
So Sydney has 4.8 miles. What with
1.5-miles for the Warringah Express-
way and extensions to the N-W Ex-
pressway another 2.5 miles is ready
for immediate construction.
This minute, no freeway whatever
is being built in Melbourne, although
experts have pointed out that at this
stage we should have 200 miles of it.
It is suggested from time to time in
the newspapers that we have, actually,
2t miles of existent freeway. But,
honestly, you would have to deduct
Kingsway, which is crossed by too
many traffic lights and intersections.
This leaves just the South-Eastern
Freeway, which is supposed to go
out in a glorious concrete sweep 20
miles to Dandenong. However, for
the past three years it has ended just
It miles off in an incredible bottle-
neck at Grange Road Bridge. Nor is
this entirely free. Right near the
famous bottle-neck there is a push-
button set of traffic lights and a
pedestrian crossing. So if you really
want to gum up the works around
peak hour all you have to do is push
that little button.
Could one bore you with some of
the things that haven't happened here?
Back about 1954 a ring road skirting
the periphery of the golden miie went
into the city’s master plan. We had
some very definite ideas on this from
a Board of Works plan in 1961. Then
it savaged part of the gardens in
Lansdowne Street. There was such a
howl another plan came out in 1963.
This savaged the edge of the Fitzroy
Gardens in Clarendon Street. But it
seemed to have the blessing of the
Government and the Board went
ahead acquiring property.
Suddenly, around April 1 this year,
Mr Bolte, under strong pressure from
park - lovers, scrapped the Clarendon
Street route and told the Board of
Works to find some other plan. The
architectural convention was on at the
time—there’s a story going around
that Mr Bolte had a chance meeting
with Arthur Odell Jnr, president of
the American Institute of Architects.
Mr Odell is one of Malvina Reynolds’
mob. Immediately afterwards, Mr
Bolte scrapped the plan and now the
ring road is only a remote possibility.
One can only imagine the reaction
at the Board of Works. They had
spent nigh on £lOO,OOO locating the
most suitable route and they had
actually spent another £150,000 in
acquiring property.
Suddenly, these past few weeks, it
looked as if we could get some action.
Mr Bolte came to Parliament with a
plan for spending £4O million on
freeways over 10 years. There were
various priorities, an extension to the
south-eastern freeway, a £2l million
redevelopment plan for St Kilda Junc-
tion and a freeway to the Tullama-
rine airport. Of course, he didn’t have
any money, but there was a plan to
cover this. Seeing that he was getting
no help from the Commonwealth he
would jack up motor vehicle regis-
tration fees by as much as 78 per
cent to provide three million a year.
Even before the Bill got to Parlia-
ment the word went around that it
would never be passed. It did not have
the blessing of the Country Party. As
you know, the Country Party has the
balance of power in the Legislative
Council. Jf you were a cartoonist no
doubt you would depict Mr Bolte as
a young, innocent city girl being
menaced by the Country Party leader,
farmer Mr Moss. Henry has submit-
ted so often now his reputation is
ruined.
As we went to press, Henry was
trading hard for those freeways. He
offered to allocate the motor registra-
tion money on the basis of every £2
spent in the city £1 would go to the
country. He offered special conces-
sions, too, for registration of farm
vehicles used only on a seasonal basis.
But Mr Moss continued to play
terribly hard to get. Already Victoria
has the best country roads in Austra-
lia. That is 12,000 miles, or 82 per
cent, of highways and main roads are
sealed with bitumen and concrete. The
Country Roads Board already gets all
the State and Commonwealth road
funds and the Metropolitan Board of
Works, which is supposed to build
the freeways, gets none.
It will be most interesting to see
what will happen. When that 1953
master plan came out the planners
looked ahead for 25 years and they
drew up a beautiful pattern of free-
ways and ring roads, all for 2-million
people and 540,000 motor vehicles.
It took us only 10 years to beat those
figures. In less than five years we will
have 750,000 cars, something we were
not supposed to have until the year
2000.
If nothing is done by then the only
solution will be to ban the motor
car, which will please Malvina, please
the Tramways Board and make
another fascinating chapter for the
book “Melbourne, Big, Rich, Beauti-
ful”, put out by the Victorian Pro-
motions Committee.

Vote Early and Often
By BRIAN JOHNS
ballot box is like the coffin —it
holds all secrets,” a politician re-
marked sardonically last week in the
midst of rumors and charges of voting
malpractice which have followed the
New South Wales election. The elector-
ate most likely to have an inquest to see
if secrets can indeed be tapped is Syd-
ney’s metropolitan seat of Bligh, where
there has been a rash of claims surround-
ing the closely contested struggle between
the Liberal's Mr Mort Cohen and
Labor's old-style politico, Mr Tom
Morey. The inquest on Bligh, which
includes the new Paddington of the
women’s page terrace house, will result
if there is an appeal to the Court of Dis-
puted Returns over allegations running
the full gamut of the lore of electoral
corruption.
If politicians, party officials and elec-
toral officers are the arbitrators, the mas-
sive use of the “cemetery vote”—voting
on behalf of the dead—and the habit of
“voting early and often” belongs to the
past. And where it is happening now,
naturally, for the party official or politi-
cian, it is happening in the opposite
camp. All have heard of voting mal-
practices, but apparently only the few
participants have first-hand knowledge.
But at polling time the parties seem
realistic. A Labor man said last week:
“A good scrutineer is worth anything up
to 20 votes by challenging or pushing
through doubtful papers.” It acted on
this, too, in the last election by appoint-
ing its top scrutineers to key electorates,
as no doubt did the other parties.
If voting malpractices are hard to
establish, they are even harder to upset.
The 1950 State election result rested on
13 vqtes in the Darlinghurst electorate.
The Liberals conducted a door-to-door
inquiry after the election and discovered
more than 1000 cases of what it con-
sidered challengeable cases, but on its
appeal to the Court of Disputed Returns
it could not prove that these improperly
went to Labor and influenced the result.
The case established again that once the
electoral roll is issued, it is for legal
purposes a “proper roll’’ whatever ano-
malies are later established.
In a close election, such as the NSW
poll, whether there is “massive” voting
malpractice is academic in electorates
like Bligh where each vote > really
counted and even minor malpractice may
be decisive. In Bligh there appears to
have been cases of “voting often and
late”, and scrutineers claim that for one
dead man at least there were four votes
cast.
One of the difficulties is the anonymity
of the metropolitan voter. In Bligh, for
example, there are four polling booths
in the subdivision of Double Bay, so the
multiple voter can go to four booths
and cast his vote. Of course, when elec-
toral officials check their rolls, multiple
voting like this can be picked up, but
then it remains to be proved that the one
person cast the votes; establishing this
depends on the unlikely chance of his
being identified by officials. Some party
officials recall the story of a City Council
candidate employing 50 men to spend the
day casting votes in its less rigidly super-
vised booths for an election. Certainly in
Bligh there have been reports of several
instances of people sending in their absen-
tee vote from country areas being chal-
lenged because someone has already
voted in their name.
The Commonwealth Electoral Office
maintains the rolls for the NSW elections
SCRUTINEERS CHECKING VOTES.
but apparently there was some delay in
processing the information on deceased
voters and other relevant details. In a
number of key electorates including
Bligh the Liberal Party spent months
organising helpers to assist in “cleansing”
the roll finding out just who was
eligible to vote. The party did this by
organising door-knock campaigns. It has
been claimed that this resulted in 900
names being removed from the Bligh
roll, although officials report “the figure
was a good deal less”. This process of
“cleansing the roll'’, like petition-taking,
is open to abuse: a party, once having
gathered the information, can use it for
its own purpose instead of informing
electoral officials.
Solutions to minimise opportunities for
abuses are varied. Electoral officials are
adamant that the malpractices are in fact
few and far between. They claim that
most instances, such as alleged dual
voting, are the result of human error—*
a polling clerk marking off the wrong
name on the roll, or a man voting twice
through drunkenness. The penalties,
rarely invoked, are heavy. The Electoral
Act provides for up to six months’ gaol
for giving false information to electoral
authorities, impersonating or plural
voting. Still, admitting the relative in-
frequency of malpractice, some party offi-
cials are convinced that further steps
should be taken to minimise the risk.
The Liberal Party believes that as well
as offsetting the disadvantage the absence
of postal voting brings to the party—■
they estimate that they would have gained
an additional 30,000 postal votes in the
last election the restoration of the right
to vote by post would be valuable in
keeping the roll up to date. This would
be done by people who are outside their
electorate applying for a postal vote and
having the acceptance of their application
noted on the roll, as happens in Federal
elections. Another suggestion is that
voters should be required to vote at a
particular polling booth instead of by sub-
division, which would lessen the chance
of a person touring the polling booths in
his sub-division. Electoral officials and
party officers are less enthusiastic about
going back to the pre-compulsory voting
days of an ‘‘elector's right"—an identity
card issued to each voter. They say that
this, too, is open to abuse and, apart from
the administrative difficulties, would not
be popular with voters.
Commonwealth officials for some time
have been examining the possibility of
installing voting machines as has long
been the practice in the United States.
But they say that at this stage it is no-
where near probability. They estimate
that there are 10,000 polling booths
throughout Australia —3400 of these in
New South Wales. In most polling places
not one but several machines would be
needed, making the cost prohibitive at
this stage.


POVERTY
The Other Australia
600,000 Australians in 230,000 households make up “The Other
Australia ” - the Australia of poverty and demoralisation. A
smaller percentage of the whole than the British or American
poor, they still justify the call for a national inquiry.
By R. T. APPLEYARD
(Senior Fellow in Demography, Australian National University)
Poverty is measurable, and there are
three groups of Australians whose
poverty can be readily established
many of the 181,920 families whose
basic needs are not met by the basic
wage; pensioners and civilian widows;
and town Aborigines.
The first group is not a “special”
group; its members do not have com-
mon ethnic or other characteristics.
They may well be scattered all over
Australia, especially in the cities. Their
common problem is housing; in particu-
lar rent. The most important study,
indeed the only recent study, of this
group was a survey of 83 families in
Melbourne by Elaine Martin who re-
ported her findings in “High Rents
and Low Incomes —Housing Prob-
lems of Low-Income Families”. Miss
Martin contends that families earning
less than £2O a week are obviously vul-
nerable to poverty if they have not
secured low-cost housing. And in 1960-
61 there were 181,920 taxpayers in Aus-
tralia earning less than £lOOO, 68,000 of
whom had dependent spouse and one
dependent child, 55,000 had a dependent
spouse and two dependent children and
58,000 had a dependent spouse and three
or more dependent children. Not all of
these 181,920 families are suffering eco-
nomic hardship. Those who had secured
government-rented housing or, because
of a legacy had been able to make a
deposit on a house, are probably living at
a standard just above "basic need”. But
large families who were paying a large
proportion of their income for market-
rented housing were, according to Miss
Martin's survey in Melbourne, suffering
considerable economic hardship.
The unpardonable fact is that the
problems have been known for many
years but our housing policy remains
quite inadequate to solve them. Without
at least £l5OO either in cash or equity
(say, a block of land), finance institutions
are just not interested in doing reasonable
business with a potential home owner.
Miss Martin visited many estate agents
in Melbourne and discovered that a
house-hunter with three children could
consider himself very lucky if he secured
a 3-bedroomed house for less than 10
guineas a week, or 50 per cent of the
husband's earnings. In fact, nearly all
the low-income families seen by Miss
Martin were living in sub-standard dwell-
ings for which they paid about £9 per
week. As a result, many of them had
less than £9 per week to meet other
living costs (food, clothing, transport,
light and fuel, etc.).
Miss Martin described their conditions:
A number of families visited did not
have proper bathrooms or even baths,
and so had to make various makeshift
arrangements for bathing. Children
were washed in tubs or in laundry
troughs. >
Another mother counted sixteen
people sharing one bathroom and one
outside toilet in an unsewered area;
which stank so revoltingly that site told
her children to use the school toilets
nearby.
There were also more immediate prob-
lems of malnutrition. Families living
in sub-standard dwellings and paying
50 per cent of their earnings as rent
were forced to go without many items
which we would accept, indeed demand,
as part of a proper standard of living.
Miss Martin revealed that many of
the families were spending less on food
than the amounts indicated by diet
studies as a minimum for healthy diet.
Miss Martin concludes that those most
harmed in their outlook by the difficulty
of making adequate accommodation
arrangements were the parents, who ap-
peared overwhelmed and apathetic, who
could not look ahead and plan ahead
with any optimism, and so ceased to look
ahead at all.
In my own research amongst immi-
grants I have discovered many large
families who were similarly overwhelmed
by the housing situation.
f'F'HE second group of Australians who
seem to be vulnerable to poverty are
some age and widow pensioners. In
1964 just over one-half of the 1,156,000

aged persons in Australia were receiving
pensions, having qualified by the means
test. While it is not clear how many of
these pensioners are unable to afford
“basic needs”, a recent small survey
amongst old people in Marrickville, NSW,
demonstrated that non-married tenant
pensioners who live away from relatives,
and are therefore obliged to pay the full
market rent of their house or room, are
enduring considerable hardship. It is
not at all difficult to see how a pen-
sioner could reach this condition. As a
single person he had little incentive
during his working life to purchase a
house and may now be paying £3 or
more of his weekly pension of £6 ss.
for a room. Under these conditions he
finds it extremely difficult to maintain
an adequate diet on £3 per week and
invariably relies on handouts of food
and clothing. Last week I visited the
St Vincent de Paul hostel for men at
Woolloomooloo. The sight of 250 men
queued up for showers, meals and
accommodation was not a pleasant one.
In 1963 this one hostel, one of probably
a dozen in Sydney, served 201,490 free
meals! A large number of these meals
were served to men whom we rather
cavalierly call the “derelicts of society”
but a large number were also served to
pensioners who just could not afford to
buy enough food for an adequate diet.
They relied on the hostel for up to three
or four wholesome meals each week.
Despite social services, many of which
are subject to a rigid means test, the
survey showed many single tenant
pensioners suffering considerable hard-
ship. If poor health limits their shop-
ping and housework and, in addition,
raises their expenses, they may live in
acute need and, finally, in squalor. The
writers get to the core of the problem
when they conclude:
Their present incomes, £6 ss. week-
ly, were not calculated and have never
been defended by citing a cost-of-
living index. The community acqui-
esces in their getting this income, not
because some sage has reasoned that
£6 ss. weekly is the right income for
tenant pensioners, but because, 30
years ago, a pension of this size, even
when adjusted to the lower level of
prices, would have been acceptable,
and because it is hoped that, in future,
every pensioner would own his or her
home. Admirable though the hope
may be, it is no excuse for failure to
help those old people who do not
own their own homes and never will.
The gap between the position of the
tenant pensioner and that of almost
all members of the next generation is
tragically sharp—and needlessly so.
Another group of pensioners who
qualify as “needy” is civilian widows.
In 1960 Jean Aitken-Swan conducted a
survey amongst a fairly random sample
of widows in Sydney and two New
South Wales towns and concluded that
those experiencing considerable hardship
were civilian widows (with dependent
children) who did not work. The
median weekly income of working
widows in her sample was £l4 45., but
for non-working widows it was only
£8 6s. One-third of the ones in Miss
Swan’s survey had incomes so low that,
after paying for rent and a low-cost diet,
they had less than 10s. per head for
every other item of expenditure (elec-
tricity, hospital benefits, etc.). Nearly
all these widows had three or more child-
ren and paid a very high rent in rela-
tion to their income. Those experiencing
special hardship were the widows with
pre-school children.
Just reflect for a moment on the
prospect of raising three or more young
children on £8 6s. per week. One widow
pensioner with two high-school children,
who tried to make ends meet on £7 ss.
a week, said: “If they don’t get the
proper school outfit they lost points
for their house”. What an indictment of
our society! An education system so
dominated by conformity that it penalises
the class which, unfortunately, contains
the children of low-income widows.
third group which appears to
A suffer economic hardship today is
part-Aborigines, especially those living
on the outskirts of country towns.
Fay Gale, who did her Ph.D. thesis on
part-Aborigines in South Australia,
seems to describe every shanty town I
have ever seen when she writes:
Not only is the camp frequently
situated near the rubbish dump, but
they have no toilets and water is
scarce. The humpies are usually be-
tween one-quarter to three miles from
other housing and hidden from the
main road by mallee scrub. The
structure of the humpy varies accord-
ing to the material available but the
usual source of supply is the town
rubbish dump. The bushes provide
toilet facilities and rarely is the excreta
buried, so that in some cases gastro-
enteritis may quickly ravage a camp.
Perhaps the most disturbing conse-
quence of shanty-town life is on the
education of the children. They rarely
saw their parents reading; only a few
of them had learnt to sit at a table and
draw with a pencil. I have heard of
Aboriginal children doing their home-
work under a street lamp.
In recent years many part-Aborigines
have moved from their shanty towns in
New South Wales to Sydney. One
anthropologist in Sydney estimates that
there are now probably 6000 to 8000
Aborigines in the metropolitan area but
they are concentrated in the inner
suburbs of Redfern, Surry Hills, etc.
Take a walk down Caroline Street, Red-
fern, where you will find a dozen or more
Aborigines squeezed into each small
terraced house that opens right on to the
footpath. For these sub-standard hovels
they pay £9 or £lO per week. Perhaps
the most damning feature of this situa-
tion is that, although these enterprising
Aborigines are in sub-standard hovels,
which,none of us would consider inhabi-
ting, they have bettered their living con-
ditions enormously. Evictions are not
uncommon.

The Man Who Loved
Christina Stead
From R. J. SCHOLFIELD in London
IF there are novelists in the world who
crave solace for non-recognition,
they need not look beyond Christina
Stead. This 63-year-old Australian
author has just received for her work
the sort of second chance that usually
comes only posthumously. Twenty-five
years after the British publication of her
book, “The Man Who Loved Children”,
drew a few drips of comment and was
written off as a flop, a reprinting made
recently in the United States has struck
a gusher of praise. Reviewers have
reached heights of eulogy from which
one feels they will never again be quite
able tq descend.
“Better than most of the novels people
call great,” they write. “There are few
novels in English that are so large and
beautifully written”; “somehow it changes
the meaning of Washington and even of
America, as if it were an historical hap-
pening"; “a work of absolute originality”;
“although not written by an American, it
must be listed among the best American
novels of this century”; “one of the few
novels ever written that seems a com-
pletely satisfying work of art”; “the pain
of reading this book is better than the
non-pain of not reading it”; “they just
don’t write them like this any more”;
“a big black diamond of a book, an
exotic and virulent attar of hatred”. And
so it comes in torrents from the country
that has resuscitated her work.
Christina Stead's reaction to the furore
is less spectacular. She admits to being
surprised and delighted at the success
of the reprinting, but not thrilled—•
meaning drawn as finely as the shades in
her book, which tells, from deep inside,
the story of a family blighted by the
hate between a wife who descends from
spoilt girlhood through child-bearing and
poverty to distraction and death and a
husband who retreats from life through
self-pity and pious delusion into a
dream-world to which he tries to take
the only people he can impress, his
children.
Christina Stead is less choosy when it
comes to finding words for her avenging
angel—Randall Jarrell. For him, almost
any superlative will do. Jarrell, Profes-
sor of English at the'University of North
Carolina, enjoys the esteem of American
academics, and “The Man Who Loved
Children” enjoys his. He was one of
the few people in the world who did not
forget the book after it first came out.
For years he has been promoting it in
a one-man campaign on the campus and
railway stations, in bars and drawing
rooms. In 1963 he named it as his
favorite book, and used the occasion to
remind the world again that it had over-
looked a masterpiece.
The third side of a triangle that has
produced what Christina Stead is pre-
pared to accept as a miracle is her friend-
ship with a poet named Stanley Burn-
shaw, who is also vice-president of a
publishing firm that specialises in college
text books—a field from which, except
for one volume of poems, “The Man
Who Loved Children” was the first
departure.
Jarrell the evangelist and Burnshaw
the poet prevailed on Burnshaw the pub-
lisher to reprint the novel, which was
long off the shelves. The acclaim that
has followed delights the author not as
homage to her talent but as vindication
of the businessman’s faith in the artist.
Christina Stead is a purist who had
never hoped to make money from
writing, but she is as tolerant of money
for those who deal in it as she is of
television writing for others than she,
and she was acutely anxious that her
work should not embarrass those who
had backed its literary merit to force it
through the pound barrier.
So, although not thrilled for herself—-
it was written so long ago that it seems
like the work of someone else —she is
pleased that the salvage is paying off for
those who attempted it. What gratifica-
tion she feels as an artist is confined to
the benefit “The Man Who Loved
Children” may shed on her current work.
The book's resurrection has thus pro-
duced the paradox of commercial con-
cern and literary detachment in a writer
who has said she would rather sweep
streets than write for money.
Although he has been her devotee
for a quarter of a century, Christina
Stead has never met Randall Jarrell, nor
does she hope to. “The magic might be
broken if I had tea with him,” she
said recently. She has exchanged letters
with Jarrell’s wife, and once, after much
prodding, replied to one from him. It
took all day to write the letter, not be-
cause it was long but because it was the
most self-conscious and painful piece of
writing she has ever done. When she
read his 35-page introduction to the
latest edition of “The Man Who Loved
Children”, she wept.
As Eleanor Perry said in a front-page
review of the book in the “New York
Sunday Tribune's” “Book Week” last
month, “The' Man Who Loved Children”
was in 1940 a critical and popular
failure. Many reasons have been ad-
vanced for this: the preoccupations of
war, timidity engendered in publishers by
the book’s denigration of family life,
lack of a paperback tie-up, which today
has become almost a standard pre-
requisite for a hardback printing, and
so on.
While the critics acknowledged the
book’s virtues, they called it excessive
and repetitious. Its characters were dis-
missed as exaggerated, unbelievable, as
caricatures. Several said that since Miss
Stead was an Australian, she did not
seem to catch the true flavor of the
American family.

With the suggestion of having failed
to turn an Australian experience into
an American reality, Christina Stead
herself had already dealt. She chose
Washington as the setting for the first
part of the book to accommodate the
Government official who is the father,
nearby Baltimore to succeed it in the
latter part of the story because, with its
faded English origins and somewhat
seedy apartness from the mainstream of
American bustle, it corresponded with
the mood and character of the Austra-
lian setting that produced the story.
To legitimise the transition. Christina
and her American husband, himself an
author, spent six months intimately sur-
veying the scene. They paced streets,
chose houses, learned the local archi-
tecture and folklore, studied the area's
flora and fauna and even analysed the
salinity of water in Chesapeake Bay in
a painstaking demonstration of the aca-
demic's refusal to deny the inter-
dependence of the material and the ab-
stract. “The way a towel hangs on a
rack shows something of the person who
put it there.” she says.
The girlhood that recorded the im-
pressions for this book began at Rock-
dale. Sydney, in 1902. Miss Stead w'ent
to Teachers’ College, disliked teaching
and took a business course at night. In
1928 she left Australia to travel. She
took a job with a grain firm in the city
of London, an interlude on which she
looks back in favor, not least, perhaps,
because while there she met and married
William Blake, former Wall Street finan-
cial journalist who was running a section
of a small bank that the grain firm had
established.
After some months in London they
moved to Paris, where Blake pursued his
association with banking, and stayed for
about eight years. Then followed a
sojourn in London on the way to
America, where New York became their
home for 10 years that included the war
and “The Man Who Loved Children”.
Since then they have roamed Europe in
a pattern that is a compromise between
her husband's preference for travelling
fast and hers for dallying. “Bill picks up
things quickly and likes to move on," she
says, “whereas I would rather pause and
do a place in depth—although, of course,
1 am at home anywhere.”
This Australian's work has had its
obstacles from the start. During her
time at Teachers' College, when she was
already rebelling against that career,
she wrote a series of short stories and
took them with her to Europe. While
absent from her Paris hotel, two valises
containing them vanished from her room.
She has always suspected that the pro-
prietor —a Swiss! —appropriated them in
the belief that she did not intend to pay
the bill. She remembered three of the

stories well enough to write them again,
and they formed the nucleus of her first
published volume, “The Salzburg Tales”,
a collection that charmed the literary
world in the early ’thirties.
In 1935 came “Seven Poor Men of
Sydney”, 1936 “The Beauties and the
Furies”, 1938 the best-selling “House of
All Nations” (about Paris banking),
1940 “The Man Who Loved Children”,
1944 “For Love Alone”, 1946 “Letty
Fox, Her Luck”, 1948 “A Little Tea,
A Little Chat”, and 1952 “The People
with the Dogs”.
The success of “The Man Who Loved
Children” has touched off a spate of re-
printings for her, mostly in America but
also in Australia, where Angus and
Robertson are bringing out “Seven Poor
Men of Sydney” and “For Love Alone”.
Her agents have said the British are
dickering about reprinting, which will
probably happen eventually. There have
been film proposals, but so far no one
has managed to tie up the many threads
involved in such a project. The biggest
snag, of course, would be to find the
large child cast.
Christina Stead describes her method
of thinking and writing as symphonic,
each work defining and suiting its own
subject and following no pattern or for-
mula. She begins a book by getting the
idea for a central character and “playing
with it”, perhaps for years, while it forms.
When she has completed this mental
sculpture she embarks on a succession
of “schemes”, or outlines of values and
relationships, which are discarded and
modified one after the other, like outer
layers of conception being peeled off
until the kernel stands revealed.
“The Man Who Loved Children” took
about a year to write. When writing,
she likes to be alone. “At this time —
but only then, mind you—l wish I were
not married.” She has tried working
regular hours but found the system
worthless.
Christina Stead has no children,
although her husband has some by a
previous marriage. For the last few years
they have been moving here and there
in Surrey and other parts not far from
London, looking for something they like
but rather enjoying the search and not
especially caring whether they find it.
They don’t lead a literary life with cock-
tails and gossip. Christina, a well-built
woman with a strong craggy face, likes
greeting people in a black track-suit and
offering a martini, and Bill, a sprightly
72, will charmingly and wittily entertain
them while she retires to peel the pota-
toes or show a favored visitor a silver-
grey pheasant in the grass outside. This
month they moved to a flat in the South
London suburb of Surbiton, and are
busy with their annual influx of Ameri-
can friends.
Miracle that it may be, the second
chance Randall Jarrell’s championing has
given her may not fully redress the over-
sight. “When the world rejects, and then
forgets, a writer’s most profound and
imaginative book,” he writes, “he may
unconsciously work in a more limited
way in the books that follow it; this has
happened, I believe, to Christina Stead.
The world's incomprehension has robbed
it, for 25 years, of The Man Who Loved
Children’; has robbed it, forever, of what
could have come after ‘The Man Who
Loved Children’.”
One hopes that her two latest manu-
scripts—one, “The Dianas’’, dealing with
the love life of American girls, the other
about life in an English working-class
family—will prove him wrong. Or,
should that not be, perhaps she may be
allowed to recapture for a future work
the magic of that earlier one from the
same source.
A Piece of Carpentry
By CHARLES HIGHAM
a~M critics are—and you can
quote me on this—a bunch of
bastards.” Nicholas Monsarrat
—as handsomely grizzled as the Sue-
cessful Novelist in a whisky advertise-
ment settled back in his chair and
sipped a king-size refreshment. “They
think there is something vulgar about a
man who has published lots of books.
If a lot of people like your work you
can't be any good. They are a most
vicious lot. ‘The New Statesman’, for
instance. If they can say something
nasty or snide, by God they'll say it.
That’s why I don’t like living in England.
The whole place is like that. It’s the
consciousness, I suppose, of political and
financial decline. ‘The Spectator' and
‘The Observer’—they print perfectly
horrible reviews. They're all trying to
outdo each other writing for effect.
There’s Bernard Levin, for instance. A
horrible man with a great deal of power,
“In America there's less of this
viciousness but even so you find it in
certain magazines. ‘The New Yorker',
for instance, likes to score off writers.
“Part of the trouble is that when you
become a big success with one book,
people want to pull you down. And they
want you to go on writing the same
book. My ‘The Cruel Sea’ appeared in
1951, after several others out of which
I’ve never made more than £2OO, and
people expected me to go on writing
‘sea’ stories forever.

ON THE MARGIN
Cliche with Feet of Clay
¥S/e in Australia suffer from a humili-
ating disability. The only other people
with a comparable problem are those of
East Africa. It is this: we are over-
shadowed by our fauna.
Tourists do not visit Kenya to make
the acquaintance of its citizens, worthy
as these may be. They go there to see,
and in many cases to shoot, the local
lions, antelopes, and elephants. Similarly,
foreign visitors to this country are not
interested in meeting, much less in shoot-
ing. a genuine Sydney estate agent or an
Adelaide accountant. They want to see
our kangaroos, hear our kookaburras
laugh, and eat our oysters.
Noel Coward is a distinguished ex-
ample of the attitude. His parting words
after a stay here were: “I like Australia,
and I love those wonderful oysters.”
We, the human inhabitants, are re-
garded by the rest of the
world simply as curators of
wild life. Pre-eminent in
interest for strangers are what
they call our cute, cuddly
koalas. As a result there has
developed, 1 believe, a re-
pressed resentment of the
koala among people here. It
is provoked whenever an actress goes
through her koala-cuddling routine for
photographers at the zoo.
The thought must come to many: are
koalas as lovable as they are made out to
be? They are nocturnal animals, and when
one sees them at the zoo are usually
asleep. A koala’s character, like a human
being’s, is hard to assess while it is sleep-
ing. Only exceptional koalas with in-
somnia are available for daytime cud-
dling by visiting celebrities.
At last a man in a position to know
has done* some plain speaking about the
species. He is Mr Fred Pickersgill, who
looks after a community of koalas at
Phillip Island. The frank portrait he
draws of them is very different from
the benevolent cliche of the travel
posters.
When they are annoyed, he says, they
bite savagely and slash out with razor-
sharp claws. The males fight over the
females. They sometimes roll on the
ground, as Mr Pickersgill put it, “in a
real good donnybrook.”
Though male koalas are highly sexed,
they treat the object of their love with
no consideration. The female has a soli-
tary existence while carrying young; her
mate goes off with someone else. The
male koala, as depicted by Mr Pickersgill,
is a marsupial Andy Capp.
The more one learns about the species,
the more human its members appear. Mr
Pickersgill says koalas “spend the night
prowling, eating, and mating.” The only
significant difference between a koala
sanctuary and King's Cross is that koalas
do not drink. (They get enough moisture
from gumleaves.)
By taking the creature down from its
pedestal, this expert has made it more
attractive to some people. An example is
Les B—, a youth of 19 in our district.
Previously Les had despised koalas. But
when he read Mr Pickersgill’s disclosures
of the animal’s habits—its pugnacity, its
promiscuity, and its nocturnal prowling
—he was favorably impressed.
Last week Les was in
trouble at home. He had gone
off with a friend in a car, met
a couple of girls, and stayed
out till 4 a.m. When he showed
up at breakfast, his father
demanded to know what he
had been doing.
The lad replied that he had
been prowling, eating, and mating, “like
koalas do”. Clearly he thought the
example of the famous marsupial excused
his conduct.
I do not suggest that everyone should
imitate the koala’s loose, brawling way
of life. But there is need for a new note
of realism in our thinking about them.
It could be shown by fresh idioms: “fight-
ing like koalas,” “lustful as a koala”, and
so on. We should make visitors realise
that koalas are morally no better than
ourselves if as good.
What matters is that Australians should
creep out from behind the shadow of
their fauna. For this purpose we should
draw attention to our own good points,
without being unduly boastful. True, we
do not carry our young in pouches; but
we invented the totalisator.
The Federal Government has made
a sound beginning by spicing its immi-
gration propaganda with pictures of good-
looking girls. The protests against this in
Parliament were, I believe, very short-
sighted. We shall score an important
point if we can convince the world that
we have some cute, cuddly people.

Portrait of a Terrorist
HO CHI MINH
By ANTHONY BROWN
President Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam who is 76
this week has been likened to the fireflies his revolution-
aries carry in small wicker cages on their backs- to guide
each other on night marches down the long trail which bears
his name and is the supply route for the Communist armies in
South Vietnam. He has flitted across tbie scenarios of Asian
revolutions since • early manhood, yet were it not for the
obscure interests of a few intelligence agents and journalists
httle would be known about this former primary school-teacher,
galley hand, and kitchen help who is now confounding the
power of the United States in Indo-China just as he confounded
and defeated the armies of the French Union. The para-
dox is that he was, in 1945, an American protagonist.
He is a stooped, frail wisp of a man who, for the first
28 years of his life, was a nonentity lacking almost everything
expected of a revolutionary—education, appearance and
physique. Yet the noted American journalist Robert Shaplen
wrote of him: “His fabled endurance of body and soul are
almost visible aspects of his being, in contrast to the submerged
shrewdness and guile that have also
marked his long career as one of the
most adroit performers on the stage of
world revolution.” This is the man
who betvVeen 1946 and 1954 cost the
lives of 94,000 French and French
Union soldiers —a man who has had
a score of aliases: whose revolutionary
passions became inflamed as he rolled
pastry under the eye of the Great
Escoffier in London while Mao Tse-
tung was finding his in the library of the Peking University.
Kim Lung is a village in Northern Tonkin, lying on the
edge of heavy rain-forest. It was near here that, in the Second
World War, Ho Chi Minh had his headquarters of four atap
huts in a small valley between sugarloaf mountains. Each
hut an American secret agent records was 12 feet square,
set four feet off the ground on bamboo stakes, and Ho’s was
as bare as the others. He lived on such primitive foods as
stewed tiger liver. In May, 1945, Ho’s mood was one of
unrestrained affection for all Americans. And it was from
this revolutionary cradle that Ho employed the Communist
revolutionary theories secure the mountains and then the
plains and then isolate the cities against the Japanese. An
agent of the American Office of Strategic Services used his
portable radio to put Ho in touch with the French negotiators
at Kunming who would soon be debating Indo-China’s post-
war futurq with Ho.
The agent recalls that Ho, while framing a declaration of
independence for Indo-China, repeatedly asked for the
language of the American Declaration and reported: “He was
an awfully sweet guy. If I had to pick out one quality about
that little old man sitting on his hill in the jungle, it was
his gentleness”. Ho stated persistently and the American
accepted somewhat naively that he was not a Communist
and that he was sincere in wanting to work with the West
after the collapse of Japan, especially with France and the
United States.
The agent has in his possession two letters in English, one
of which was written soon after the Japanese surrender when
the Vietminh was about to seize temporary control of Indo-
China before the long wars began. It states:
Dear Lt
1 feel weaker since you left. Maybe I’d have to follow
your advice moving to some other place where food is
easy to get , to improve my health . . . I’m sending you a
bottle of wine, hope you like it. Be so kind as to give me
foreign news you got. Please be good enuf to send your
HQ the following wire:
“National Liberation Committee of VML begs USA
authorities inform United Nations the following. We were
fighting Japs on the side of the United Nations. Now Japs
surrendered. We beg United Nations to realise their solemn
promise that all nationalities will be given democracy and
independence. If United Nations forget their solemn
promise and don’t grant Indo-China full independence, we
will keep on fighting until we get it.
Signed National Liberation Committee of VML”.
Thank you for all the troubles l give you . . . Best
greetings! Yours sincerely, Hoo (sic).
Since this unsophisticated jungle note, Ho considers he has
had cause to give the Democracies great trouble indeed—this
year the Americans are said to be planning to increase their
forces in South Vietnam to 100,000 men and to spend about
800 million dollars on economic and military assistance to this
nation of 14 millions. What has caused this avuncular one-
time friend of the US (he likes to be known as “Uncle Ho”
and the sincerity of his former regard for the US has never
been doubted) to prosecute one of history’s most internecine
civil wars? What changed Ho from a man cutting off pieces
of a tiger's liver for an American special agent to the bitter
tea of such statements as “We must be vigilant and be on
guard against the plans of the imperialistic Americans who
are seeking to intervene in Indo-China, to incite their lackeys
to sabotage the armistice and thus cause war”? This was the
essence of Ho’s statement at the birth of the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam made against the background of an
immense five-hour anti-American demonstration.
There are few chronicles of Ho extant and so the con-
temporary reporter is constantly thrown back for reference
to but a handful of written non-Communist sources. Writes
Shaplen: “There are as many, or more, sophisticated, tough-
fibred and hard-headed Frenchmen and Americans as there
are naive ones who still insist that we should have reacted
to Ho’s wooing and taken a calculated risk by trying to win
him to our side in the immediate post-war period and perhaps
even later. They maintain this even though Ho has never
wavered from a straight Marxist.”
Who, then, more than anti-colonial Americans were in a
position to help Ho win liberty from France and simultaneously
ward off Chinese penetration? For Moscow was a long way
off, and had done little to help Ho through the difficult years
of the Second World War, and China was not yet Communist.
The US had been both positive and vague about Indo-China.
Roosevelt had been in favor of a trusteeship for the country
when the war was over. Glibly, perhaps, both Stalin and
Chiang Kai-shek expressed themselves as favoring ultimate
independence for the Vietnamese. But the Americans were
opposed to assisting underground groups in Indo-China and,
indeed, no one had ever heard of Ho Chi-minh in the White
House. Ho had been a man of mystery and of many names.

Foil caps millions of milk bottles each
week. Since it’s a metal, foil is moisture-
proof and impervious to liquids and
grease. Being malleable, it forms a tight-
fitting and hygienic cap and so protects
product purity.
Foil has insulated acres of roofing. Being
highly reflective, aluminium keeps build-
ings warmer in winter, cooler in summer.
That’s why foil is used so extensively in
insulating modern homes and offices.
Foil has protected millions of pharma-
ceutical tablets. An effective barrier
against moisture and sunlight, foil main-
tains the quality and composition of
capsules and tablets. “Strip” packaging
means that tablets are exposed only as
they are used.
Foil has held millions of pies and TV
dinners. Foil is invaluable in packaging
foodstuffs because it seals in flavour and
freshness. It is ideal for disposable con-
tainers. And products that come in foil
always stand out, because foil is a real
eye-catcher.
Foil has sheathed hundreds of miles of
cables. Electrical screening is one of
foil’s many applications. It’s also an
excellent electrical conductor, and is
widely used in industry for this purpose.
Foil has wrapped tons of confectionery.
Another excellent example of foil’s many
protective properties: in this case, it seals
in flavour and ensures factoiy-freshness.
Australuco, with its well-established
and specialised facilities, produces a full
range of basic foil products for use in
converting and packaging. Australuco’s
engineers and technicians are backed by
the world-wide experience and knowledge
of the Alcan Group, and are able to sup-
ply the latest information about the many
applications of aluminium foil in all
phases of Australian industry.

When he did emerge from the jungle
after seven years it seemed inconceivable
to the French that this man with the
broad, flat feet of a coolie and an iron
grip (in the mountains, it is said, he
would sit all day throwing stones to
strengthen his hands) could rule. Who
was this man Ho? A few men knew him,
members of the French intelligence ser-
vice, Force 136 (the elite British com-
mando and intelligence unit), and the
OSS, and British and French journalists,
including the Australian Communist Wil-
fred Burchett. He came, also, to the
attention of Louis Arnoux, chief of the
Vietnamese section of the French
Deuxieme Bureau’s political intelligence
branch, and a man who later headed all
French security services in Indo-China.
It is typical of the mystery with which
this latter-day mandarin surrounds him-
self that not even his exact date of birth
is certain, and his real name is part of
the myth. Communist sources cite 1890,
1891, 1892, in the village of Kim Lien,
in central Vietnam, not far from the
Tonkinese border. Western Communists
state his name is actually Nguyen Ai-
Quoc, which translates roughly as “Ngu-
yen the Patriot”. French Communists
translate this name as “Jean le Patriote”,
while early Comintern agents state his
name is Nguyen That Thanh (Nguyen
Who Will be Victorious). A Western in-
telligence report states he was the son of
a poor native prefect. This prefect is
variously dismissed as a bully who lost
his job through drunkenness, as imperial
official versed in the art of Chinese ideo-
graphy, a member of the village aristo-
cracy, a man who was barely richer than
the rice peasants around him but who by
dint of intellectual moonlighting passed
mandarinal examinations which entitled
him to a post in the imperial administra-
tion, head of the anti-French conspira-
tors (with little Ho running secret mes-
sages at the age of nine), and, finally,
practitioner of "Oriental medicine” the
healing based on Chinese or Vietnamese
traditional precepts.
reported there is no evi-
dence that Ho married, although it is
possible that while escaping from British
intelligence agents in Hong Kong in 1931
(Ho had been on the run for 20 years
from one intelligence agency or another
before his emergence from the Tonkin
jungles) that he “acquired” a family to
give credence to his disguise as a Chinese
merchant. But what is more certain is
that when Arnoux and Ho met at the Ver-
sailles conference, where Ho presented
himself in a hired morning dress to lobby
delegates on Viet colonial questions,
Arnoux, with the unerring instinct of a
policeman, recognised a potential enemy
of France in the firebrand nationalist
with whom he talked—and the two were
to tangle for 20 years. Arnoux began a
dossier which, in hindsight, shows that
Ho was probably greatly influenced by
his attendance at the Lycee Quoc Hoc
at Hue. Quoc Hoc was founded with
the express purpose of perpetuating in
Vietnam education untainted by French
views, and a list of its pupils reads like a
“Who’s Who” of the Vietnamese Revolu-
tion —Ho, Communist Defence Minister
Giap, and the assassinated Southern
President Diem.
Ho, it is believed, was dismissed by
Quoc Hoc at 14 for anti-French activities,
drifted south to the small fishing town of
Phan-Tiet where, 20 years later, an
enemy, Diem, was to establish a reputa-

tion as administrator which was to take
him to the Saigon palace from which he
was to hurry to meet his assassins’
machine pistols. Ho, however, failed to
establish himself in Phan-Tiet (had he
done so history would be different and
men would not be dying by the droves
each night as they are today), either as
a master or a man of letters in the true
Viet tradition. One prediction, one fact
can safely be assumed of Ho: his writings
will not influence Marxist-Leninism. The
American student of Vietnam, Bernard
Fall, has written that “the sum total of
his writings amounts to little more than
a collection of speeches, a slim volume
of verse, and one play, “Le dragon de
bambou”, which was received by the
sharp wit of Paris like old yeast. His only
work of any importance was “Le proces
de colonisation Franchise”, published in
Paris in 1926 and dismissed by Fall as
a “slapdash, naive pamphlet” indicating
French colonialism.
Ho is thought to have left Phan-Tiet
in 1911 for France after entering a trade
school for a “quickie” course as a pastry-
cook's apprentice and to this day Ho has
a reputation for being the world's most
food-conscious revolutionary: he is both
gourmet and occasional chef. Ho signed
on board the Latouche-Treville as a kit-
chen boy and because it is believed he
did not want to sully the family’s good
name by being known to have undertaken
such menial employment he took his
first pseudonym: Ba. He also worked on
other vessels of the global shipping line
Messageries Maritime and his contact
with the tough, ill-tutored, brawling sea-
men of the Frisian Islands, Brittany and
Cornwall men as suspicious and illit-
erate as the poorest Vietnamese rice far-
mer began to erode any beliefs of
the superiority of Vietnam’s “white”
colonisers. Ho—according to Fall —still
likes to tell the story of the arrival of
his ship in an African port where, he
claims, natives were compelled to jump
into shark waters to secure moorings. Ho
Arnoux has stated also began to
learn something of his own dignity: when
while ashore in France he was, for the
first time in his life, addressed as “mon-
sieur” instead of “tu”, used in France for
addressing children and in Vietnam for
natives.
The start of the First World War found
him in London, by day a snow cleaner,
by night cook's help at the Carlton Hotel
under the great Escoffier. Escoffier liked
this quiet, French-speaking Asian and he
was promoted to an enviable department
the pastry shop. He joined the Lao-
Dong Hai-Ngoa, the Chinese-led Over-
seas Workers’ Association. The associa-
tion supported Ireland’s fight for in-
dependence, and so he received his first
lesson in anti-colonial agitation. As the
war intensified, the need for pastrycooks
diminished and Ho went to sea again
where, according to his Communist bio-
grapher, he visited the US and “found the
barbarities and ugliness of American
capitalism, the KKK mobs, the lynchings
of Negroes” while he lived in Harlem.
Ho returned to Paris in early 1918 and
became a photo retoucher. The text of
this advertisement used to appear in a
Socialist newspaper: “You who wish a
living remembrance of your parents, have

Compoint Paris XVIIth District.” With
the collapse of Germany, Ho rented a
black suit and bowler and began to haunt
the corridors of Versailles seeking to pre-
sent Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemen-
ceau with an eight-point programme
which did not demand independence but
equality between the French rulers and
the Viet ruled, and basic freedoms. It is
doubtful whether his request for an audi-
ence went further than a minor clerk and
that this odd little man—he looked like
an Oriental Charles Chaplin—caught the
attention of anyone but Mr Arnoux. They
met in a cafe near the Opera to discuss
politics and Arnoux tried to persuade
Albert Sarraut, Minister of Colonies, to
meet Ho. Sarraut refused but agreed to
allow his Chef du Cabinet to receive Ho.
Nothing came of the encounter —. except
for the first photograph of Ho in his
police dossier, taken by a secreted photo-
grapher as he left the Deuxieme Bureau
meeting.
Then followed a series of strange
meetings between the policeman and the
revolutionary which led to accusations
that Ho may have acted as a French
agent provocateur an allegation which
may have some substance because it is
almost certain that Stalin worked as a
similar agent for the Czar’s secret service.
By now Ho was a sallow-faced Asian
aged 28. And at the French Socialist
Party national congress in 1920, Ho’s
contribution to the debate was “I don't
understand a thing about strategy, tactics,
and all the other big words you use but
I understand very well one single thing:
The Third International concerns itself a
great deal with the colonial question. Its
delegates promise to help the oppressed
colonial peoples to regain their liberty
and independence. The adherents of the
Second International have not said a
word about the fate of the colonial
areas.” With this simple criteria, Ho
voted with the Communist wing of the
Party and so became a founding member
of the French CP.
From then on he became a Communist
agent, working successively for the
French, Russian and Chinese Communist
Parties, the Comintern in Europe, China
and South-East Asia. But Ho was for
long considered to be a Viet nationalist
first and a Communist second, in the
same vein as Tito is a Yugoslav Com-
munist, Gomulka a Polish Communist,
Khrushchev a Russian Communist a
dedicated Communist with Vietnamese
nationalistic bias. This definition of him
would indicate—Ho's students believe—
that he has a fear of China, which all
Viets have through Indo-China’s long
domination by China. This fear of China
nationally (not ideologically) accounts,
perhaps, for Ho’s apparent reluctance to
seek direct Chinese protection against
the systematic US raids which are wreck-
ing the lifelines of his nation.
At the University of the Toilers of the
East in Moscow, Ho received his training
in theoretical Marxism. He climbed fast
up the ladder of the Comintern hierarchy,
avoided the purges of the '3os when
Stalin executed most of his Comintern
associates and began to exhibit a doctrin-
aire hatred of the French. He signed
articles Nguyen-O-Phap—“Nguyen-Who-
Hates-the-French”. And in 1924 the
Agitprop -specialists in Moscow decided
to send Ho to Canton to organise the
revolution in South-East Asia. He went
to China that year to begin stoking the
furnaces of revolt which still burn today.
He became a hunted man in China, too
well known to the Surete in Indo-China,
and so he made his headquarters in East-
ern Thailand. Disguised as a Buddhist
monk, with shaven head and saffron
robes, Ho walked from one village to
another setting up revolutionary societies
and creating clandestine newspapers to
smuggle back into Vietnam. There fol-
lowed an intensive period of revolution-
ary activity, rebellions and police counter-
intelligence operations which Ho watched
from Hong Kong where he was in hiding
under the alias Tong Van So, organising
the integration of the Cambodian and
Laotian Communists into the Vietnamese
Communist Party.
When Ho returned to Russia he left

behind a carefully constructed network
of 250 Annamite Communists under the
name Thanh Nien (Association of Revo-
lutionary Annamite Youth). Early in
1930 he returned to Asia the pere-
grinations of Ho in the ’3os are as mys-
terious as one would expect of a Comin-
tern agent and it is known that he
visited Hanoi secretly, escaping from
Arnoux's secret police by stripping to
the waist, grabbing a ricksha, and pulling
an old lady with vegetables in her lap be-
yond the security cordon. Ho was ar-
rested in mid-1931 in Hong Kong by the
British at Arnoux’s instigation, and held
prisoner for 18 months. While in gaol
he almost died of tuberculosis. After his
release, London revoked an “agreement”
with Paris whereby he should have been
turned over to the French —which would
have meant life imprisonment or death—
and ordered that he be kept in British
jurisdiction.
And now comes the most obscure
period in Ho's life from 1933 until he
emerged in China in 1941. During this
time he was rumored to have married or
taken on a regular concubine, by whom
he had a daughter who later worked
anonymously for the Vietminh and then
disappeared. So. after a long, enigmatic
career in the Communist vineyards. Ho
was in his atap hut headquarters with the
OSS agent. The message cranked out
over the hand radio reached Leon
Pignon. a French political careerist, who
was to be High Commissioner of Indo-
China in 1948, and Major Jean Sainteny,
who was to become France's chief rep-
resentative in North Vietnam. They read
Ho's demand for a guarantee of in-
dependence from France in five to ten-
years. The Frenchmen who were said
by OSS Chief Helliwell “to be infinitely
more concerned with keeping out the
Americans from Indo-China than they
were in defeating the Japanese” agreed
to discuss terms but no date was set. In
the South the British arrived in Saigon to
act as caretakers after Japan's collapse
until the'Vrench military return, while in
the North Ho emerged from the jungles
and was accepted as leader.
So began the 20-year war by Ho.
Today he is closer to his dream of a
united, independent Vietnam. He has
lived for more than 60 years in political
and actual jungles. And, I suppose, as in
love, friendship and all politics, yester-
day's friend is today's enemy.
So it is that Ho's men burst into US
army messes in Vietnam and machine-
gun American soldiers while his agents
attempt to blow the US embassy. “I
have,” says Ho, “been betrayed by the
one country I thought would help us
America.” Arnoux, his other great
enemy, sits in Normandy and remembers
his old adversary with affection.

the clash of arms between Pakistan and
India for possession of this dismal waste-
land—had ground to a halt. Even the
static groups in their battle trenches were
remote from us and nothing advanced
our way except a mirage of trees along
the level horizon, like a line of monstrous
mediaeval knights. The battles we
talked about were over, but far from
satisfactorily decided. We had been
taken to the Rann to hear from Indian
witnesses what had happened, especially
in the fighting for Biar Bet. The
Pakistanis had flown foreign newspaper
reporters to the front straight after this
engagement. They heard from soldiers
still benzedrined by notions of success
and the joy of their own survival that
the Indians had been put to disorderly
flight.
We had gone round putting this
version to the Indian troops and inviting
their comments.
What one said was straightforward and
didn’t sound like a lame excuse. He
said that when the Indians looked out
of their foxholes at Biar Bet and saw
the Pakistani infantry advancing out of
Sind with tanks, they were not unduly
frightened but astonished and shocked
in their notions of fair play.
In this small struggle,” said a major
primly, “we didn't expect that tanks
would be used.” The major says his
soldiers stayed and fought as long as
they could. A .map the area com-
mander had shown J us back at base
didn’t suggest that when they withdrew
they had gone as far as panic would
have driven them. The soldiers we
talked to showed no sign of that shame
which a humiliating defeat is apt to
make as visible as wounds.
Once, the armies of Sind and Kutch
with their princely commanders would
have fought for the Rann until total
victory and utter defeat had put the
right to possession beyond argument. It
is the modern ideal, so largely the
creation of Nehru’s India, which re-
quires such quarrels to be settled by
what are called peaceful means but which
replace the simplicity of war with
acrimonious, confusing and endless dis-
sension.
But otherwise a battle here would be
a slaughter as unsubtle as at Fontenoy.
There is often much to be said for the
boring alternative, (ofns.)

FORUM
Screening the Screens
TV censors with the schoolmasterly touch?
By HARRY WHITMORE
Unlike the Press, Australian tele-
vision and radio are very tightly
controlled by the combined efforts
of the Postmaster-General and the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Control Board.
The extent to which this power may
be pressed is well demonstrated by the
Bidault affair in 1963. M. Bidault, a
former French Premier, and leader of
the Council of National Resistance to
General de Gaulle, gave a television
interview which was broadcast by the
BBC in Britain. Believing that the ABC
owned sole rights to the film in Aus-
tralia, the Postmaster-General issued an
order prohibiting the ABC from tele-
vising the film. The Postmaster-General
commented that the interview was an
“affront to France, a friendly nation”.
Telegrams were later sent to all com-
mercial stations prohibiting their tele-
vising of the film. Unfortunately for the
Government, this proved to be the classic
case of bolting the stable door after the
horse had fled. Station TCN-9 in Sydney
had already televised the interview before
the telegram was received. A political
storm developed over the issue, and it
transpired that the ban had been imposed
by the Postmaster-General only after full
consultation with the Prime Minister.
Finally the prohibitions were withdrawn.
It is claimed by the Government that
the purpose of the powers conferred on
the Minister by the Broadcasting and
Television Act is to permit control
of genuinely objectionable material, and
that the political usage was exceptional.
Other powers which under the Act are
enjoyed by the board are surely sufficient
more than sufficient —to permit con-
trol of objectionable matter. There is no
possible excuse for retention of the Minis-
ter's powers. The Bidault affair shows that
prohibitions on the broadcasting or tele-
vising of programmes may be imposed
for purely political reasons. The one
abuse of the power demonstrates that it
should not exist at all.
The board gets its powers under the
Broadcasting and Television Act, which
authorises it to impose censorship when-
ever it has reason to believe that there is
a proposal to broadcast or televise matter
of an objectionable nature. The most
This article is condensed from
Harry Whitmore’s forthcoming
hook on civil liberties..
significant part of the Act is Section 99.
By this it is required that the holder of a
licence to operate a broadcasting or tele-
vision station shall supervise the broad-
casting or televising of programmes from
his station so as to ensure as far as prac-
ticable that programmes are in accor-
dance with standards determined by the
board. Licensees may be directed by the
board to conform to the standards,
and records, films, and other materials
must be submitted to the hoard on
request. The same section permits the
Minister to prohibit a station from broad-
casting or televising any matters. As is
sc often the case in Commonwealth
legislation of this type, the Parliament
has placed no limitations on the standards
which may be imposed, or on the
Minister's powers to prohibit programme
matter. They can prohibit anything.
The board’s 1964 report to Parlia-
ment demonstrates the attitude likely to
be adopted by a body exercising near-
dictatorial powers. The schoolmasterly
touch is very evident. The board noted
that it did not receive any complaints
during the year concerning the broad-
casting of blasphemous, indecent or
obscene matter. Observations by the
board's officers and investigation of com-
plaints from listeners showed that radio
“announcers made remarks which were
in bad taste or broadcast jokes in which
there were vulgar or suggestive elements”.
In one case, the board requested that
the manager of a station take strong
disciplinary action against the announcer
concerned. The board stated that it
“will not accept as an excuse for
vulgarity, suggestiveness, or any undesir-
able aspect of patter the claim that a
licensee or his representative was un-
aware that the practice existed”. Some
vulgarity in the comedy routines of tele-
vision stations was to the board “evidence
of irresponsibility on the part of regular
participants in a variety programme”.
The station concerned was warned that
if there was any repetition, advance re-
cording would be required. Complaints
that participants in discussions on social
issues and moral problems were not
qualified to discuss the subject matter
produced a warning that stations should
ensure the competence of those partici-
pating in such programmes. It is a pecu-
liar brand of censorship which insists
that only the expert may discuss social
and moral problems.
A. S. HUME
The Act itself places severe limitations
on the broadcasting or televising of
political material. No dramatisation is
permitted of any political matter which
is current, or was current, at any time
during the preceding five years.
The only possible object of such a
provision is to protect politicians from
satire and ridicule. Since in most other
countries both satire and ridicule are
regarded as legitimate methods of
political criticism, the result is yet an-
other limitation of freedom of expression.
Numbers of political advertisements
have been rejected because they con-
tained a dramatisation of political matter
and the restriction may account for the
lack of political satire in TV shows.
All broadcasting and television stations
are also subject to an absolute prohibition
against the dissemination of blasphemous,
indecent or obscene material. Persons
who render or pass or select an item
which falls within this category may,
with the consent of the Minister, be
prosecuted. The board is well equipped
to impose censorship. It may, where a
person has been convicted of an offence
involving obscenity, or where it has
reason to believe that a person has
rendered, passed or selected material
which has caused, or may cause, offence
to a section of the public, call upon that
person to show cause why a prohibitive
order should not be made.
In 1956 the Board arranged for impor-
ted television films to be censored by
the Film Censorship Board; the arrange-
ment was approved by the Postmaster-
General and the Minister for Customs.
Television films are vigorously censored
in accordance with television programme
standards. The censor’s opinion that Aus-
tralian audiences are more prone to cor-
ruption than their British counterparts is
demonstrated by the ban currently im-

Seven more uses
of Marviplate
to add to the
thousand others
Lysaght Marviplate combines the massive
strength of steel with the warm beauty of a
vinyl fabric surface.
Marviplate consists of a decorative vinyl film
bonded permanently to a steel sheet. It
can be sheared, punched and formed just like
ordinary sheet steel. It requires no painting
for finishing, yet it adds new beauty to
luggage, television and radio cabinets, furniture,
in fact anything that needs the strength
of steel and the permanent beauty of vinyl.
Marviplate is permanent, washable, won’t
scratch, won’t scuff, keeps its glamorous good
looks year after year.
It’s available in a wide range of colours and
textures from delicate pastels and warm
feature colours to textile finishes and simulated
woodgrains.
Make it with strength . . . make it with looks
. . . make it with Marviplate!

posed on the showing of three films
dealing in serious fashion with the prob-
lems of male homosexuality, lesbianism
and abortion. The Censorship Board re-
jected all three. No reasons were given
for rejection in 2 cases; in the third some
of the reasons were given. Television sta-
tion ATN-7 is now seeking approval to
reconstruction.
Section 103 of the Act provides
that broadcasting and television stations
shall broadcast or televise divine wor-
ship or other matters of a religious nature
during such periods as the board deter-
mines. The board may also direct that
this be done without charge.
The Commonwealth Constitution pro-
vides as follows: The Commonwealth
shall not make any law for establishing
any religion, or for imposing any
religious observance, or for prohibiting
the free exercise of any religion . . .
Both the Act and the. board's activities
come very close indeed to violating this
prohibition. There is an actual im-
position of religious observance. If there
is no legal breach, there can be no
doubt that the board's requirements are
a gross interference with freedom of ex-
pression. It is one thing for the stations
to meet a public demand. It is quite
another to direct them to allocate pro-
gramme time to religion.
The present board does not apparently
shrink from interfering in the dissemina-
tion of news. It commented last year
that radio stations had reported inter-
national and local events with prompt-
ness and accuracy. The board had few
grounds for criticism”; but was con-
cerned that “news items should be of
sufficient importance to merit broad-
casting”. The board has often objected
to presentation of news in “a sensational
manner”.
The Broadcasting Control Board has
almost frightening powers to control and
censor the most important communica-
tion media in this country. It is almost
completely beyond any sort of check
control by the courts. Parliamentary
control is made feasible by. the require-
ment of annual reports to Parliament.
The reports issued to date contain a mass
of material dealing with licensing and
general programme content; they con-
tain no detailed discussion of actual cases
dealt with. Fears of excessive censor-
ship could be allayed and parliamentary
review made a reality by more thorough
reporting. The board could also, with
advantage, do much more than it is
doing to keep the public informed of its
activities. Inevitably this will attract
more criticism but it is indeed time
that Commonwealth public servants paid
more than lip service to the idea that
criticism is the life of democracy.
[Charles Higham discusses film censor-
ship on page 56.]
Is He Really Suitable?
The Professorial Board deliberates.. .
Tn this extract from a recent article
by Lionel Trilling in the British
magazine “Encounter”, a Professorial
Board is considering recommendations
that it appoint to university positions
James Joyce, Andre Gide, Beethoven
and others . . .
The members are reassured by Mr
James Joyce’s academic attainments—
he commands several romance langu-
ages, has a working knowledge of the
Scandinavian tongues, and a strong
interest in linguistics; he is adept in
Scholastic Philosophy, gives signs of
being a powerful theorist of aesthetics.
He might well turn out to be useful
in interdisciplinary seminars. But there
ore certain personal circumstances
which raise questions. One circum-
stance is that Mr Joyce is not married
to Mrs Joyce. Then there is the pro-
bability that Mrs Joyce will not be
happy in an academic community
she is a lady (but not actually a lady)
of very simple education; so
far from being of use to her
husband in his work; like a
proper academic wife she
never reads what he writes.
Mr Joyce makes inordinate
demands on everyone
around him, is never grate-
ful for what people do for
him, believes that he is the object of
treachery, even of conspiracy. He
drinks too much. It is an aspect of his
pure creative effort that he portrays
actual people, including his literary
colleagues, usually satirically, and
using their actual names. The chances
are that he will make no exception of
his academic colleagues. Is this good
for faculty morale? The new book he
is writing, the one that is to be called
“Ulysses”, is said to be a work of
genius. But it is full of indecent
words and scatological and sexual
details. Does the university want to
accommodate the decades of scandal
it will cause?
Disappointed but hopeful, the Com-
mittee turns to Andre Gide, an even-
tual Nobel Prize winner. There can be
no doubt about it: Monsieur Gide is
married to Madame Gide. And yet
alas! ... It is not that the Committee
wishes to exclude sexual deviants from
academic life; they have been there
before. But Monsieur Gide insists on
making a point of it, he defends it, he
urges it. The parents of our students
cannot be wholly left out of account.
But these adverse considerations are
in a sense irrelevant. For it turns
out that Monsieur Gide would not ac-
cept the appointment even if it were
offered him. For he conceives it to be
of the essence of his existence as a
writer that he startle and shock and
dismay his readers; Jf his writings
were to issue from the university, they
would seem certified as virtuous, they
would lose much perhaps all —of
their shocking force.
If not Gide, then certainly not
Genet. Anyway, with his prison record
he would have difficulty with the
immigration authorities. What of Jean-
Paul Sartre, not only eminent as a
creative but as a speculative mind? We
are large-minded enough to overlook
his sometimes rather odd political
positions and also his antagonism to
respectable life. But Monsieur Sartre
does not want to come. He likes to
do his writings at a table in a cafe.
Very well, this is one of the ways the
university can accommodate creative
effort —we will have a cafe;
we need one anyway. Mon-
sieur Sartre is touched, but
still says no thank you. It
is all those political quarrels
how is a man to write
without them?
William Butler Yeats,
when approached, returns
something of the same answer. Ireland
is wearing him out, tries his temper,
frays his nerves. The Irish nation dis-
gusts and infuriates him. How can
he leave it?. Rather to the relief of
the Department of History, which was
apprehensive that Mr Yeats might
wish to give a course on his theory of
history as set forth in “A Vision”, a
work which had been dictated to his
wife by certain spirits whose academic
background is quite vague, Mr Yeats
declines the offer.
Dostoevsky? A genius, but his
political views are not easily accom-
modated by a liberal university.
Count Leo Tolstoy? Without doubt
he is married to the Countess, but he
is just on the point of his religious
conversion and there is trouble in the
offing. Charles Dickens? Doesn’t
want to leave London and young
Ellen Ternan. Cezanne stares when
the Committee approaches him. Beet-
hoven (a most deficient and mal-
adjusted person—another impossible
person) replies with a titanic stare,
growl, and shrug.
Sometimes, it appears, genius is
touched with paranoia. Alas!

Letters to the Editor
Dr K. and the Board
SIR. You suggest that Dr Knopfel-
macher was “lynched” by “a combination
of Leftists and fuddy-duddies” on the
Professorial Board of the University of
Sydney. If 48 out of 55 members were
thus politically and personally pre-dis-
posed against the doctor, it seems very
likely indeed that the remaining seven
were politically and personally pre-
disposed in his favor. May I suggest
for this group, since you are so deter-
mined to play the labels game, the title
of “Right-wing revitalists”? I can see, a
priori, no reason why anyone should
feel morally compelled to go along with
Right-wing revitalists rather than their
opponents. Personally I am for Dr
Knopfelmacher as a teacher and a
dedicated intellectual. I can only deplore
the way in which he ruined his final
chance of appointment by slapping on
the Professorial Board of our largest
university the label of “Kangaroo Court”
and your own action, as his largest public
supporter, in following his example.

Film Cutters
SlR.—Film censorship certainly needs an
overhaul in this country; there are many
anomalies and inconsistencies in the
current attitude of the board, and Mr
Whitmore's article (8., May 8) is wel-
come even though it leaves much un-
touched. (I have never quite forgiven
the board the banning in this country
of Laughton’s “Night of the Hunter”,
this great actor’s only essay into film
direction, and highly praised overseas.)
In Australia, however, there is cutting
of another and, often far more disturb-
ing, kind by the exhibitors themselves.
Films are often mutilated (that is the
only word and not too strong a word),
for the basest of all reasons—commercial
return. In the past few months, Mel-
bourne has had the chance to see Sidney
Lumet's “A View from the Bridge”
cut to 71 minutes from over two hours—
Elia Kazan’s “America America”'—with
nearly 30 minutes gone —even “Bye, Bye,
Birdie” with the whole final musical
sequence literally ripped from the picture.
I. J. HUTCHINSON
Fairfield (Vic.).
SIR. Harry Whitmore's article was
most welcome. People consciously choose
the films they go to see. This is parti-
cularly true of the so-called “art” cinema.
In some cases, therefore, it seems more
reasonable to initiate some form of con-
trol over the advertising of a film rather
than to cut the film itself. Of course, this
may not suit distributors who find they
can exploit a film on sequences the audi-
ence will not see.
If the silence of distributors is stony,
the silence of the film society movement
and such organisations as the Film Festi-
vals is ominous. A reprehensible manifes-
tation of “The gutless society” is “the
gutless film society”. The Film Festivals
(Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and now
Perth), which should be completely free
from censorship, are quite happy to
screen mutilated works to their sub-
scribers without protest.

Homosexuals
SIR. The article on homosexuality
(8., May 8) quotes a statement by
NSW Police Commissioner Allan:
“Nothing is done by our plainclothes
police that cbuld remotely resemble an
inducement to a person to commit an of-
fence". This is sheer twaddle; in almost
every instance of homosexual arrests the
police officer concerned is young and
good-looking a fact which speaks for
itself. Mr Allan appears uncommonly
ignorant of the homosexual make-up 'as
very few such people betray themselves
to a seemingly prospective partner with-
out inducement. Your article also quotes
more official twaddle in a statement by
former NSW Police Commissioner Dela-
ney: “Homosexuality is the greatest
menace facing Australia.” For all the
notice taken of it the law might as well
not exist. Besides, the homosexual is
too beset by personal torments such as
emotional immaturity and loneliness to
be particularly concerned over the fact
that he is an outlaw. The very few who
are deeply disturbed by their illegality
usually solve the problem by moving to
another country. In fact this disregard
for the law (and it is a singularly mali-
cious and unjust one) makes the homo-
sexual not so much a menace as an asset,
for. if all homosexuals were driven to
seek refuge abroad, the various trades
and professions would be depleted of
many of their most skilful members.
From a national point of view this could
be detrimental, if not disastrous.

The UAR Replies
SIR. We wish to refer to the article
entitled “The Lone Arab”, by Emery
Bares (8., May 1), and while having
no intention to go in lengthy con-
troversy about what was written in this
article, we wish to comment on the last
two paragraphs concerning the Arab-
Israeli conflict on the Arab refugees.
1. The departure of the lews from
the Arab countries was by their own
will and without any pressure or discri-
mination or persecution from the Arab
people. These Jews went to Israel misled
by the Zionist propaganda. This can be
clearly proved by the obvious fact that
many Jews are still living in the Arab
countries in peace without discrimination
or persecution as did their fathers and
ancestors who were never persecuted by
the Arabs or the Islamic countries. On
the other hand many of those immigrants
have on many occasions crossed the
boundary to adjacent Arab countries.
2. The Arabs of Palestine who are
now considered refugees fled from their
country, homes and properties as the
result of the atrocities committed by the
Zionist gangs. It was obvious that the
Zionist gangs were keen to chase the
Palestinian Arabs out of their country—
where they lived for thousands of years
in order to achieve their goal which
was the creation of Israel. The exact
number of the Arab refugees is H mil-
lion as stated by UNRWA which is, as
you know, a UN Committee.
3. The idea of absorption of the
Arab refugees by the Arab countries is
a Zionist plot and policy carried out with
perseverance in order to change the true
aspect of the real problem which is the
tragedy of a nation chased from its
country and deprived of its properties,
homes and land. International Zionism
aims at distorting the true issue by trying
to make it appear as a simple refugee
question which can be solved by ab-
sorption.
4. —Since the Palestine tragedy in
1948 and for 17 years, the Arab refu-
gees in spite of their miserable life
as recorded by UNRWA are still de-
termined to return to their homeland. The
Palestinian Arabs are the only masters
of their own destiny and the last say in
this issue will be theirs.

The Poles
SIR. —My congratulations to you on
what certainly must be one of the best
up-to-date articles about Australian Poles.
S. GRABOWSKI
Meadowbank (Tas.).
SIR. —I find that Mr E. Bajkowski (8.,
May 8) described quite well the general
political and social set-up among the
Poles in Australia, and his definition of
their “reasonably comfortable . . . vege-
tation” is particularly true. For in-
stance, the percentage of university
graduates in Adelaide. The 1964 lists of
university graduates contains four Polish
names —an extremely small number—for
a population of several thousands of local
Poles. Also Polish influence in Aus-
tralian painting, music, literature and
other creative arts would deserve some
study to find out the degree of cultural
assimilation. The author also exag-
gerated while describing those “great
societies with a dozen members”. There
is a very vocal central society in Adelaide
with four members, not enough to form
a decent executive.

in the last couple of years. In point of
fact, he has brought his characteristically
snappish style to only five, all under the
banner of the Elizabethan Trust-Old
Tote. But with his appearance in “The
Country Wife” (his third consecutive
play there this year) he nearly qualifies
as Sydney’s most übiquitous actor since
Alan White disappeared from com-
mercial radio. “The Country Wife”
opened on May 19.
Mr Hay is one of a scattered colony
of British actors who have emigrated to
Australia since the end of the war.
Gordon Chater was among the first:
Kenneth Laird one of the most recent.
Their combined value to the Australian
theatre only could be estimated if they
all suddenly packed up and went back
home. We’d lose a directory of accom-
plished professionals ranging alpha-
betically from Alexander Archdale
through Ellis Irving to Raymond West-
well.
Alexander Hay has no thought of re-
turning to his native England. He came
here in 1955 to relax from the pressures
of a strenuously active, if not prestigious,
career in Britain, and he has found both
enough rest and work to anchor him
contentedly. We talked in an Elizabeth
Street espresso shop. Mr Hay lowered
himselt into one of the angular and un-
comfortable wrought iron chairs and
stared at himself in a facing mirror. He
studied his image during much of our
conversation.
“I find it mildly amusing to" hear
people ask, ‘Who is this Alexander
Hay?’ ” he said, and laughed sparely as
if he found it-cynically amusing.
“You see, I’ve been in this business
rather a long time and it is rather dis-
concerting to keep being ‘re-discovered’.”
Sydney audiences first “discovered” Hay
as a dominant actor when he confronted
them as George in the Old Tote’s pro-
duction of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” last year.
He stalked and snapped his way
around the stage in a performance of
considerable power and effect and
virtually has been stalking and snapping
ever since. He was the homosexual spiv
Ed in John Clark’s production of “Enter-
taining Mr Sloane”. and gave a satanic
characterisation of lago in Tom Brown’s
version of “Othello”. In “The Country
Wife”, the Old Tote’s first essay at
Restoration comedy, he’ll play a giggling,
mincing fop.
To all of his performances observed
in Svdnev. Hav has brought a mannered
attitude of aestheticism. His dialogue
has been snapped out with the preciseness
of someone who cherishes the English
language and who is careful not to ring
a “g” a solit-second longer than is neces-
sary.
“I have had classical training,” he
explains, speaking with exactly the same
elocutorv preciseness off-stage as he does
on. Hay’s father was a Scot who dis-
approved of a theatrical career for his
son. but this didn’t deter young Hay
from ioining London’s Royal Academy
of Dramatic Art where he studied with
Irene Vanbrugh, Claude Rains and
Stephen Haggard.
He later joined the Old Vic Company,
where he worked with Tyrone Guthrie,
and was, for a time, a member of Donald
Wolfit’s classical repertory company.
For a time he also directed his own
theatre in St Andrew’s. Scotland. When
he first attracted mention in Sydney,
there were publicity-style suggestions
that Hay had come from a recluse-like
life in the hills outside Adelaide, and
that he intended haring back there after
the run of “Virginia Woolf”.
“Well, that’s not exactly true,” he
says. “I lived alone in the country near
Mt Barker, but I wasn’t in retreat or
anything like that. I just wanted peace
and quiet and time to do a little paint-
ing. I am quite happy with my own
company, but I’m not and never have
been a hermit.
His run of appearances in the last two
years (“Oh, yes. I was in ‘Henry V’ and
‘A Man For All Seasons’, too”) have given
him a relative fame, but have not made
him greatly richer. No one gets rich
acting at the Old Tote. But he has added
sufficiently to his capital to invest in a
terraced house in Balmain, which ne
intends converting, a la Gordon Chater.
“I am not intensely ambitious,” he says.
“Like most actors, I want a continuity
of work, but in the future I am probably
going to be more interested in producing
plays than appearing in them.” Until
which time he is, übiquitously, on stage.
Last Straw for
John Reed
By PATRICK TENNISON
Art connoisseur John Reed has
always had the canny knack of
being able to gauge quickly the
potential in unknown young artists.
Fortunately, too, both he and his wife
Sunday (nee Baillieu) have always had
enough money to be able to back their
judgment materially.
Reed’s resignation last week from the
directorship of the Melbourne-based
Museum of Modern Art and Design of
Australia places him, it and £IOO,OOO
worth of top-line modern Australian art,
all in a funny position.
Though he’s more discreetly diplo-
matic than to say so in as many words,
he quit the museum which is funda-
mentally his own 140 paintings and 20
sculptures because he was fed up with
the way the whole operation in Flinders
Street, Melbourne, was not being per-
formed. Basis for his startling action
was the lack of about £15,000 a year
that he estimated was needed to run the
museum properly. But the real root of
all the troubles has been lack of pro-
motion for the museum and clashes of
personalities and ideologies for which
Australian art circles —like those of any
country, 1 suppose really—are notorious.
To the vast credit of everyone concerned,
the pre- and post-resignation statements
from the principals have all been
judiciously worded affairs prepared care-
fully in advance.
“I’ve been forced into a position that
makes it quite impossible for me to con-
tinue,” Mr Reed said quietly, though
with fervour enough. Mrs Simon War-
render (nee Myer), chairman of the 12-


man museum council that accepted the
resignation responded hopefully: “We
have plans for reorganisation and I hope
they will give us a new lease of life.”
Everyone keeps affirming that the
museum will not close. The Reeds have
said their collection can stay as long as
the museum operates. His resignation
seems to have provided the unfortunately
placed museum with the best publicity
it has been able to engender for a long
time.
When it began in 1958 with Mr Reed
as its first director, it was in a drab but
picturesque enough old building down
towards the waterfront end of Flinders
Street, over the premises of the sports
trousers king, Fletcher H. Jones. More
recently it moved to a better site further
up Flinders Street but still rather
obscurely tucked away on the fourth
floor of Ball and Welch's retail store, a
floor it shares with the B and W staff
cafeteria.
As well as being Australia’s most
auspicious showplace for such historic
pieces as Sydney Nolan’s Kellys and
the early works of painters such as
Tucker, Perceval, Arthur Boyd, Black-
man and Dickerson, it runs exhibitions of
newer and lesser known names, all in
the cause of contemporary Australian
art. But the Reed collection is supposed
to be its main draw. These, naturally,
are not for sale so the museum, unlike
private galleries, cannot collect com-
missions on them.
Short, gently spoken, mildly tweedy in
the manner of. say, an expert and well-
to-do London dealer in rare books, John
Reed’s origins were in fact in Tasmania,
where he was born in 1901. He is a law
graduate of Cambridge and Melbourne,
but his wealth allowed him to indulge
his passion for art ever since he settled
in Melbourne in 1925. He and his wife
and many say that it is she who is
the more knowledgeable on the subject—
have encouraged scads of struggling,
young artists. Much of their collection
came about from early buys at what
seem now-vridiculously low prices that
were, just the same, manna at the time
for the painters.
No Place
Else To Go
By CLAIRE CHAPMAN
“T’m just a nice quiet girl,” said singer
A Miss Sarah Vaughan. Miss Vaughan,
a womanly 30-plus, had just denied that
she was getting £lO,OOO a week for her
four-week engagement and w'as proceed-
ing to demolish the Sassy Sarah legend.
“The sassy bit refers strictly to my
musical arrangements, from the days
when I sang with Billy Eckstine,” said the
girl whose fans call her The Divine
Sarah.
Miss Vaughan had just finished her
first show for the evening, using her rich
molasses voice in a selection of innocu-
ous songs for an equally innocuous audi-
ence. But behind her satisfaction with the
lovely audience there was a certain
truculence.
Part of Miss Vaughan’s truculence had
come from an unfortunate arrangement
whereby her act was preceded not by
comedian Don Lane but by a local act,
which, in addition to “Click Go The
Shears” in Japanese, had included her
own song, “Bill Bailey”.
But like a hardened trouper, or some-
one just plain resigned to the irritations
of earning big money, Miss Vaughan had
gone on cheerfully, finishing up with a
cute little singing commercial about how
happy she was to be here.
Where was the slow, sad, honest-to-
goodness jazz of Billie Holiday? “What’s
jazz, anyway,” said Miss Vaughan defen-
sively. “You can’t define jazz. In this
business people don’t want to hear jazz.
Not unless they’re in Basin Street.”
In Vegas, Los Angeles, Sweden, any
place you could name, she always sang
this type of song. She knew nothing of
old reports that she had once sung the
Lord’s Prayer in Latin. You could never
believe anything people wrote about her
anyway.
The image of the good little girl who
sang what she was told began to crack as
we left the subject of music. “I’m not the
person to turn the other cheek,” Miss
Vaughan said, speaking of civil rights.
“I give benefit concerts up North for
Civil Rights but the Reverend King don't
need girls like me down there.”
But she had no kind words for our
own freedom riders. “There's too many
people trying to change things they don't
understand,” she said.
Miss Vaughan continued to talk
through the list of embargoed subjects.
“Td like to get rid of my husband but
I’m waiting until I fix up the tax people,”
she said pleasantly. "Otherwise I might
become liable for the money they say I
owe them.”
The alleged debts, being only the
equivalent of a week's salary, seem a
lesser problem than Mr Clyde Atkins,
Miss Vaughan’s second husband, who left
cab-driving to become her manager.
If she does not wake every morning to
the personal agonies of Billie Holiday,
the future brings its share of problems.
We asked Miss Vaughan where she was
going next, after her holiday in Japan.
“When you get to the top,” she said,
“there’s no place else to go. You just keep
on singing.”
Meaningful Plays
r | "'he most interesting project so far
in self help for Sydney actors
will get under way this week with the
launching of the Kuring-gai Com-
munity Theatre. The theatre seems a
logical step forward from the endea-
vors of the Q Group, which has been
presenting professional lunch - time
theatre for more than a year, and the
Australian Theatre for Young People,
which is working at full pace but with
what are often captive audiences
Prime mover in the Kuring-gai
Community Theatre is experienced
actor and producer, Alexander Arch-
dale, who will be the company's artis-
tic director. The company’s directors
are Mr Archdale, actress Ruth Crack-
nell, novelist and playwright Patrick
White, the headmistress of Abbots-
leigh girls’ school, Betty Archdale,
Alderman David Griffin, who is the
Civic Reform Party’s candidate for
Lord Mayor of Sydney, and barrister
John Kerr, who has been over some
of the ground before with Phillip
Street Theatre.
The theatre plans to do nine pro-
ductions a year of what Mr Archdale,
borrowing the phrase of American
critic, Howard Taubman, calls “mean-
ingful” plays. Strong attempts will be
made to snare those elusive good Aus-
tralian plays. Each play will run for
four weeks.
This week the directors set about
getting £5 each from 5000 people.
They are hoping for strong local sup-
port but don’t expect all interest to
come from the North Shore. The
first £15,000 should enable the com-
pany to buy an existing building, close
to a railway-station, which they have
their eye on. The company plans to
convert this to a theatre seating about
450 people.
Mr Archdale believes that a small
professional company can keep its
head above water, if only by going
out of the city. On the proposed site,
repayment of mortgage might come
out at something like £lOO a week,
whereas city rentals would be at least
£5OO, or perhaps more like £lOOO a
week.
It is intended to pay Equity rates
and to have professional backstage
and management people. Even so, Mr
Archdale and his fellow-directors be-
lieve that they can just get by on no
more than one-third capacity houses.


FILMS
Angel on a Parachute
Mary Poppins. Director, Robert Stevenson.
Metro Theatre, Kings Cross, Sydney.
This Disney musical fantasy takes us
back to that delightfully safe, cosy time
before the First World War —1910 is
mentioned in one of the songs. Living
probably seemed precarious enough to
the peop'e engaged in it at the time,
but after the lapse of a half century it
can look calm and solid.
Into a reasonably prosperous London
household of the period—father pre-
occupied with his job in a bank, mother
a suffragette, two nice children, two
comical resident servants —comes Mary
Poppins, parachuting in from the clouds
on her own umbrella. Mary's semi-
supernatural function is to bring a mix-
ture of joy and discipline to such respect-
able but disorganised families. She’s
aided (mainly in the joy department) by
her amiable Cockney friend Bert, who
turns up as one-man-band, pavement
artist, song-and-dance-man or chimney-
sweep, just as occasion demands.
As Mary, Julie Andrews is certainly
bright, pretty and versatile, though I
don't think I'd have chosen this as the
performance of the year. 1 preferred
Dick Van Dyke, who, despite a weird
accent, makes Bert the most important
character in the film, in which the most
impressive scene involves him and a team
of chimney-sweeps in a rooftop ballet.
Here the film’s color photography glows;
but in many sequences —this is unusual
in a Disney production —it is harsh and
variable.
Like most Disney productions, the film
has an unexceptionable but not too un-
comfortably elevated moral attitude.
Money isn’t everything, it seems to be
saying, but it's certainly something; and
though Daddy should sometimes take
time "off from his job to fly kites with the
children, he’s got to have a job to go
back to. The children, incidentally, are
presented with a merciful avoidance of
cuteness, and the solemn Karen Dotrice
has considerable charm.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
THEATRE
England or a Madhouse?
Heartbreak House. Bernard Shaw. St
Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
“Is this England, or is it a Madhouse?”
a character in this, one of the most Sha-
vian of all Shaw’s plays, asks. The answer,
that England, and not only England, is
a madhouse has not altered in 47 years
since it was first produced. We have be-
come sadly unfamiliar with real eloqu-
ence in the theatre, and to many modern
playgoers the effort involved in follow-
ing the argument may be almost too
great, but the work itself has not dated.
In fact it is as topical as ever. Here Shaw’s
deep pessimism is starkly stated, redeem-
ed by a strong current of poetry. Captain
Shotover, the octogenarian Jeremiah who
tells us that “happiness is no good,”
wears Shaw’s own f ace. GBS was
still in his fifties when he wrote “Heart-
break House”, but the man who died in
Nancy Astor’s arms must have been very
much like this.
It is a comedy only in Dante’s sense,
of course. It teaches us many things later
dramatists have tried to teach us too, but
how much better! The theme of the two
cultures is already present, though with
an older and perhaps more relevant
twist. The cultures are those of the
civilised and thoughtful, and of the men
of affairs who sneer at ideas and ideals.
Who is the more practical? The former,
but their failure is as great because they
do not know how to act. Shaw, master
of the paradox, traps them like puppets
in self-made contradictions from which
they cannot escape. They become Eng-
lishmen in a British Cherry Orchard.
The play also anticipates the game of
spiritual strip-tease. In the end there is
only one person left who could be called
nice—the most ineffectual of the lot. But,
unlike his epigones, Shaw leaves his
people something to cover their nudity,
and this something is dignity. It is only
spun of words, but it gives them a time-
lessness which today’s anti-heroes will
never possess. He shocks sensibility; he
does not have to rape sensitivity as well.
The result remains a thousand times
more telling.
In Shaw, emotion is sublimated to the
nth degree. There is a sort of love
story in which three women play a part.
They are the captain's daughters, and
Elbe Dunn whose maiden heart is broken
by Hector Hushabye, husband of one of
the two. She has also to decide
whether or not to marry Boss Mangan.
an elderly twit of a businessman who
ruined her unworldly father. Finally
she platonically weds herself to Captain
Shotover. Step by step, as Mangan’s
stupidity is revealed and Hushabye’s
bouncy masculinity is shown to cover a
pleasant void, her own sweetness falls
away, and out comes the toughness
which no man can match. The other
females flirt, flyte and flounder in similar
style until our heads spin: The spectator
is perennially in danger of being left
behind as parables interlock with each
other. Love is simply one item in a
complex social process that has no room
for romantic illusions. Empress and
emperor have no clothes, but Shaw was
no Andersen. They get away with it
because we are all naked.
“Heartbreak House” contains enough
ideas not all still equally interesting
for three plays. It has two redundant
characters (a clownish burglar and a
make-weight public schoolboy type) but it
stages beautifully. The First World War
and its intellectual futility casts a shadow
over the action, with a quasi-symbolic
Zeppelin raid as the last climax. The burg-
lar and the capitalist, twins beneath the
skin, do the wise thing and take shelter.
They are killed, leaving the rest to carry
on their talk, an amalgam of fantasy and
revelation. We know that their names
are already on a bomb that will drop
sooner or later. “Culture” is good, but
it is not good enough. Only a Shaw could
have made this funny. When will we get
another to face our latter day lunacy
with something better than a rude noise?
The company at St. Martin’s, given
the right play, now reaches a standard
unsurpassed in Australia. This produc-
tion would hold its own anywhere in
the world. The cast works as a team, no
detail is neglected, large groupings flow
and combine with ease and each actor
seems to mean what he says, undaunted
by what a four-letter age regards as
Shaw’s verbosity. It is a pity, and an
indication of the problems we face in
this country, that they never go on tour
together: this hermetic separation makes
for one form of provincialism that could
be overcome. The Trust, instead of sub-
sidising the importation of stale musicals,
might consider helping to finance an
exchange between, say, St Martin’s,
Sydney’s Independent and Adelaide’s
Theatre ’62.

TELEVISION
Tube Transport
At present it is easier to see the upper
reaches of the human colon on tele-
vision than any part of the Amazon.
The inside of Hammersmith Hospital’s
artificial kidney and similar wonders are
visible on our screens, but if one’s taste
runs to the plains of Spain and other
habitats of the human race, television
offers them only as vague backgrounds
in film studies of the African mute
warbler or the Scotch grouse. In fewer
words, there are too many medical
documentaries and nature study items on
television, and not enough about man-
kind, sometime said to be the proper
study of man.
Most of the film we do see in that line
is news based, cut to a few shots of mob
violence in Selma, for instance, and even
then too little too late to convey the
current temper of the world. The “news
magazines” of the several channels focus
mostly on the quaint and innocuous,
often more banal than the items in a
BP newsreel. In weeks when similar
things occur in different countries, when
riots have reasons, ministries fall, new
products appear, or men bite dogs, rarely
does anyone think of gathering these
films into a half-hour splice.

f A Keith Courtenay keeps its crisp new look longer than any other suit
However, this is a side issue. We are
told that international tolerance and
understanding are necessary modern
ideals, for a variety of reasons. Little
on television furthers these ideals. Our
news teams visit neighboring countries
and rush to interview the leaders, men
who may be their nation’s head or hands
but are not necessarily its spirit. We
are still left without ordinary knowledge
of the people, although two minutes of
edited shots could give it to us. I think
we are convinced by now that Malayans
depend largely on rubber-gathering for
their money, but what they eat and how
is not considered.
If this seems irrelevant I suggest we
can learn as much about the world at
its dinner tables as in the fields and
factories. Too many of the local and
overseas films about places and people
are centred on an event or fact of no
lasting importance, easily gotten, soon
forgotten.
These films are the work of television
journalists, and too much exposure to
them makes me long for a few Flahertys,
with camera eyes and time to see it all,
in detail and in depth. One David Atten-
borough manages to show us more about
the Aborigines, while shooting primarily
nature study film, than 20 journalists
have managed. More recently Therese
Denny produced a fine, tightly-edited
film which ABC Television ran in the
grab-bag series, “Impact”. But in the
week her “World of Father Silvio” was
televised in Sydney, four channels gave
us mere glances at Moscow, Warsaw,
Australia, Japan and Sweden. The only
other human documentaries were about
an Italian girl and a Greenland Eskimo
family. Four hours in the week’s 300
hours, a very small blessing.
Time will come when all the old
movies will have been shown three or
four times, and the channels will have
to find material to fill the 30 hours or
so the movies occupy now. Are we to
be more of such piffle as
the ABC's “The Magic Boomerang”?
The development of teams which could
make entertaining documentaries should
not be beyond the resources of inter-
national television. I expected such
things to happen eight years ago, and
am still waiting, sometimes impatiently.
The often-mooted, ever receding Aus-
tralian film industry has to begin some-
where. Television is, and should be,
mostly entertainment, but it is possible to
be visually entertaining without a word
being spoken. The camera alone can
speak volumes, but is seldom allowed to.
In a country which can produce marvel-
lous amateur still photographs, can we
believe that imaginative short movies are
impossible?

The Man Who Came to Dinner
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Ambassador. Morris West. Heine-
mann. 30s.
Morris West, it is clear, enjoys the pro-
tection of a guardian angel whose special
duty it is to guarantee his topicality.
Thanks to her expert guidance, the publi-
cation of “The Shoes of the Fisherman”
coincided exactly with the last Papal
elections. Now, at the precise moment
when Australia has accepted military
commitments in South Vietnam, “The
Ambassador” has appeared, as though
to insist that whatever other virtues we
may find in its author we can always
depend upon his news value.
In “The Ambassador”, under the
guise of fiction, Mr West presents an
account of the political and military
struggles of the Vietnamese people, and
of American policy in South Vietnam.
We see a country torn by civil war, and
threatened from without. Religious in-
tolerance and persecution keep the
Buddhists at war with the Catholic
administration: an army and its leaders
are divided against themselves and their
President. A heterogeneous peasant
population, illiterate, bewildered and
poverty-stricken, is swayed this way and
that by forces it hardly begins to under-
stand. French agents recall the colonial
past and exacerbate the present evils by
playing political hide-and-seek in order
to preserve their own commercial in-
terests. America, in its role as banker
and supplier of troops and arms, plays
a callous game of diplomatic chess.
Continual warfare is waged against the
Vietcong invaders from the north; while
further north still swarm Vietnam’s one-
time rulers and enemies, 700 million
Chinese. That is South Vietnam as Mr
West saw years ago.
He has chosen to tell his story in the
words of Maxwell Amberley, American
ambassador in Saigon. He is a man with
a successful diplomatic career behind
him, with a hard, dictatorial manner, and
a conviction that he is in great need of
illumination. So we first meet him in
a Zen shrine in Japan, meditating upon
his own infirmities, and seeking the way
of enlightenment. The novel, then,
seeks to combine in the person of Am-
berley two themes —those of private and
public morality. How can a man who
is himself inadequate as a person decide
the destinies of millions of other men?
Is political and diplomatic bargaining
compatible with an untroubled con-
science? Can political action be taken
without the destruction of personal
principles? These questions lead to the
problem with which E. M. Forster has
so long been preoccupied—the problem
of how to transfer private decencies into
public life.
No one would surely deny that these
questions need to be asked, even though
they probably cannot satisfactorily be
answered. If they are to be explored by
the novelist, however, they can be ex-
plored only by a very thorough examina-
tion of character. And here, at this vital
point, Mr West is betrayed—like Am-
berley—by his own ambitions. He wants
to pass on to his readers a great deal of
information about South Vietnam; he
wants to examine American policy; and
he wants to examine the state of Am-
berley’s soul and the progressive de-
terioration of his character. Something,
one feels, must give under the strain of
this triple task. That it happens to be
the examination of Amberley’s charac-
ter kills him and the book’s impact as
fiction at the one blow.
For the unfortunate truth is that Mr
Amberley has not even a semblance of
life as a character; nor can one justify
his unreality by saying that he is meant
to be unreal/ He exists in the novel as
a stereotype of the ugly American; and
while this is perhaps sufficient for the
political message of the book, it is quite
insufficient for the theme of private
morality. Amberley is more than once
described as “an unresolved man", but
he is shown, except in the most superficial
ways, primarily as a bluntly effective
diplomat. His diplomatic techniques
are crude, he is thoughtless to his sub-
ordinates, he works desperately hard,
and he lies to himself and others about
his motives. Through him Mr West
seems to be making an oblique criti-
cism not only of American policy but
of American diplomacy and its repre-
sentatives. But he cannot at the same
time expect his stereotype to step out
of his mould and become persuasively
human, or even interesting. Amberley
is asked to be both stereotype and anti-
stereotype, and his success in the first
role disqualifies him for the second alto-
gether. He has as much individuality as
an official communique or a Press re-
lease.
By far the greater part of “The Am-
bassador” is undisguised information.
There are long passages of “conversa-
tion” which are in fact arguments set
up in a dialectical form. The minor
characters are little more than sets of
inverted commas. In fact, with the ex-
ception of the last fifty pages, where Mr
West describes the American-inspired
military coup, and where there is some
action and color, the book reads more
like the script of a television documentary
than a novel. One feels the need of a
map—l had to look one up—but one
also feels rather like a listener at an
illustrated lecture when the projector
breaks down.
One episode struck me as odd, and
revealing. Unless I am much mistaken,
Mr West has signed this book in the
manner of Alfred Hitchcock, by intro-
ducing himself in a small, but crucial
scene. He appears, an Australian, at an
embassy dinner. He is “a peripatetic
novelist of considerable reputation”,
“intelligent”, “canny”, “well-informed”
and “shrewd”. He is studying the rela-
tions between Christian and non-Christ-
ian religions. He is to see the South
Vietnamese President the next day, and
he is asked to gather a vital piece of in-
formation for the American ambassador.
He does so, thereby virtually determin-
ing American policy on the proposed
coup. He is asked whether he intends
to use the information he is gathering,
to which he replies that he is a novelist
and not a journalist. Yet in “The Am-
bassador” Mr West the novelist runs a
bad second to Mr West the journalist.
No amount of Oriental dialogue, none of
the rather ponderous references to iden-
tity and “alienation from the natural
order of the universe” can confer upon
this book the special qualities of a self-
contained world of fiction. It is a poli-
tical guide-book to South Vietnam; it
will be invoked in conversations about
Australian policy and arguments about
intervention or non-intervention. Its
strength is its topicality, though even that
does not by any means always rescue it
from tedium. Mr West hopes that “the
work is truthful to its own terms of re-
ference”. How can it be, when those
very terms commit it to inconsistency?

cf t!se Censor
Censorship: Films. No, 2. Spring, 1965
The Congress for Cultural Freedom in
London is issuing a series of publications
on aspects of censorship, a subject one
would think rather easily exhausted; but
the intention is to run the reports as
quarterly magazines. There is an intro-
duction (which rather too peremptorily
defines the whole commercial cinema as
a product for the Philistines) and contri-
butions bv Neville Hunnings (Great Bri-
tain), Peter Graham (France), Donald
Richie (Japan), Arne Svensson (Sweden)
and others. Mr Hunnings’ article is
factual, dry, and extremely tedious, a
recitation of solid data, without any illu-
minating comments, on the banning of
specific films there (e.g., “Green Pas-
tures”, in which Negroes appeared as
God and the angels) or on the extraordi-
nary leniency towards films of cruelty,
ugliness and violence (most of the Bri-
tish horror film output, despite its pre-
tensions, is largely sadistic and disgust-
ing, aesthetically if not commercially
indefensible). Jerker Eriksson on Fin-
land is far better: the country, he reveals,
is “sex-shy”; Bergman's “The Virgin
Spring” was so heavily cut there that the
director refused to allow' it to be shown.
Political films—Wilder's preposterous
“One. Two, Three” and Frankenheimer’s
“The Manchurian Candidate” —were
altogether banned, and so were a host
of films featuring violence, from Karel
Reisz's inane “Night Must Fall” to Lang's
brilliant “The Big Heat”. The censor’s
main purpose in Finland seems to be to
turn the country into a massive kinder-
garten, its public screen wiped clean of
a hint of the wicked world.
Those who uphold France as an
example of freedom and decency in cen-
sorship proceedings will be rudely
awakened by Mr Graham’s article. Here,
idiocy is rampant: his story about the
banning of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses”,
Vadim's updating of the Laclos novel and
a brilliantly accomplished black comedy,
is in itself a bizarre example of comedie
noil■ (no cause for smiles here: the film
was prohibited outright by our own
custodians). Leslie Stevens’ “Private
Property" (also banned here) was allowed,
subtitled, into the art theatres in Paris,
but not, dubbed, into the popular houses.
The most disgraceful episode Mr Graham
describes is the police action on “Octobre
a Paris”, a documentary of the Algerian
riots in Paris.
In other countries absurdities abound:
in Germany, “Leon Morin, Pretre”, lost a
confessional scene because the penitent
showed no sign of repentance, in India
movements called, officially, “jerkings of
bust” are scissored out, in Italy “L’Avven-
tura" was cut as “immoral”, while in
Japan “L’Eclisse” was scratched by the
censor on the frame to remove the
appearance of a vulva on a pencil in the
shape of a naked girl.
There is, unfortunately, no chapter on
Australia, perhaps on the ground that
we do not have a native feature film in-
dustry. Here, as in most of the other
countries discussed by the contributors,
there is a degree of censorial ineptitude,
not very effectively covered up by the
deliberately misleading recent showing
to a group of Sydney columnists of a
selection of banned pornography which
would have been stopped in most coun-
tries of the world. Nobody, as the Board
well knew, had ever complained about
the banning of pornography; only about
the banning of films, or parts of
films, of quality; and a showing of smut
to the Press was clearly intended to de-
lude the uninitiated into thinking that
pornography is the main target of cen-
sorship here, that despite all the fuss we
have lost nothing of significance to the
official scissors, only muck we are well
rid of. It would have been more honest
to have disclosed that films of the im-
portance of Charles Laughton’s “The
Night of the Hunter”, William Keighley’s
“Green Pastures”, Vadim’s “Les Liaisons
Dangereuses”, Godard’s “A Bout de
Souffle”, and many worthwhile tele-
vision items have been prohibited.
The very impressive “Island of Lost
Souls’", from a Wells novel, was released
in the theatres here in 1932 and banned
on re-submission years later (and for
television). Had a print been kept in
the country it could have been shown
publicly, but, because it had to be re-
imported, it was banned! Mamoulian’s
celebrated “Applause”—perhaps one of
the 10 greatest films I have ever seen,
and a masterpiece praised in many film
histories —was banned in 1930 and was
not brought in for TV because the com-
pany was understandably nervous of the
reaction it would get from the censors;
recently the opening and closing credits
of a film were banned for television be-
cause they depicted the moving silhou-
ette of a strangler. And an episode of
“The Defenders” a series devoted to
social issues was banned because it
dealt with drugs and suicide!
The anomalies are many and absurd.
Against them one can balance the fact
that in recent years a few horror films
have managed to slip through. Never-
theless, film censorship remains a scan-
dal here; the mistake, as this book makes
clear, is to regard it as a purely Aus-
tralian scandal: it is, perennially, an
international one.

Dark Odyssey
The Truce. Primo Levi. The Bodley Head.
265. 6d.
Primo Levi is not related to his more
famous namesake, Carlo, but he deserves
to be mentioned in the same breath. Two
of his books have been translated. The
first, “If This is a Man”, was an account
of his life in a German concentration
camp, and one of the best of this sad
sub-branch of contemporary literature.
“The Truce” tells of his journey back to
life, of the months he passed travelling
from Auschwitz to his home in Turin.
Others before have described this odys-
sey, but none with greater force. It is
fitting that Chagall should have designed
the jacket for this memoir , for it has the
quality of a sorrowful but robust dream.
There is no straining, neither towards
forgiveness nor towards its opposite; only
a very simple telling of what befell an
honest man who, to his never-ending
surprise, found himself among the sur-
vivors when four Russian soldiers rode
up to the wire fence behind which the
living dead were waiting. The period
that followed he calls “the truce" because
it was a twilight time. “We felt that now
nothing could ever happen good and
pure enough to rub out the past.”
Levi was a young man of twenty-five
on that strange and memorable morning.
Before the war brought him service in
the ranks of the Italian partisans he had
been a chemist. Perhaps he would never
have become a writer, but for his appal-
ling sufferings under the Nazis. But he
is a writer, one with an enormous talent.
He avoids anything smacking of the sen-
sational and he never goes in for descrip-
tive atmosphere, but he speaks of man's
bestiality and the regenerative power
of his spirit with the unaffected sincerity
of Dostoyevsky in his writings from
Siberia. Except that, unlike Dostoyevsky,
he also has a sense of humor, surely the
most extraordinary piece of salvage from
the vicinity of the gas ovens.
When, in Cracow, he meets a curate
and has to asj< him where the soup-
kitchen is, not knowing Polish he falls
back on Latin. (“Pater optime, übi est
mensa pauperorum?") The priest shows
him the way, after advising him not to
let on that he speaks German or Yiddish.
Levi is a little bewildered by this. Later,
in Munich, he is still more bewildered
by what he fails to find in the Bavarian
faces. The guilty, too, have suffered too
much: the look of hunger hides their
degradation.
His first travelling companion is a Jew
from Salonica who pits the brutal self-
discipline of trade at all costs against a
whole world of cruelty. Levi fears, dis-
likes and admires him, as one admires the
courage of Shylock. He himself lacks
the life-saving ability to scrounge and
contrive which distinguishes some of the
home-comers. Sick, a bag of bones, Ke
attaches himself to a group of com-
patriots, and what a motley collection
they are! He mixes with soldiers stranded
during the retreat, slave workers, thieves,
prostitutes and uprooted doctors, as rich
a gallery of individuals as only Italy
can provide. We get to know them all
as their track winds not in the direction
of the Alps but away from them, through
Poland into the Ukraine and, for a long
stay, into the depth of the Pripet
Marshes. It is like Schweik’s anabasis on
a larger scale.
They are under the protection of the
Red Army. Levi's understanding of the
Russians is magnificent. He hates their
Gargantuan passion for prevarication,
their unpredictability and their apparent
indifference. They shunt the trainload of
the miserable and lost from nowhere to
nowhere, but always cheerfully. At last
he comes to love them as well, for their
vitality, their patience and their good-
ness, which nothing can master. He
works for them as a medical orderly,
forms friendships and is touched by the
warmth of their women. So, after a
series of adventures with peasants, black-
marketeers and actors, native and
foreign, he ends up at Starve Dorogi,
where camp is made in a vast forest until
summer becomes winter.. They have
enough to eat, but the rest of the uni-
verse seems to have forsaken them. Then,
at long last, there is another train, and
the harsh voyage through Rumania and
Hungary and on to the Brenner begins.
At the end you have nearly forgotten
that it started at Auschwitz. But it is
impossible to forget those who stayed
behind—the three-year-old child who
died a few weeks after liberation, having
learned but one word of human speech,
the Frenchman whose limbs had to be
untwisted under the shower, the orphan
boy who, having had no other model,
insanely and obscenely imitated the
death-head guards, their strutting and
their curses.
It is good that books like this one
continue to be written, and that there are
men like Primo Levi to write them.

I looked from my window
and saw the stains of Catherine wheels
on the dark wood
and fences shuttered split in tinned-in

Lost in a soft, grey sun
the brown still-life world
rushed down and hushed the turning

until they slept.
The lily stalked green
and grew upright
and knew the circle wrought the change
that burnt the leaves around the garden.

Literature and Morals
The Dungeon of the Heart. Edwin T. Bow-
den. Macmillan, New York. 20s.
“The Dungeon of the Heart” is subtitled
“human isolation and the American
novel”, but Dr Bowden intended his
study (first published in 1961 and only
now, apparently, available here) to have
relevance to more than to just literature.
It was to deal, too, “with the American
mind and its history in the past”. There
are indications, though, that the associa-
tions of the American novel and the
American mind are of more than histori-
cal or sociological interest; for Dr Bow-
den the Great American Novel exists
very much as propaganda for the great
American Way of Life, and good Ameri-
can literature is good American morals.
“It is apparent from these novels too
that one element of that final integrity
may be a moral truth, a validity of moral
values springing from the experience of
life itself. Whether the final effect is
then to be called esthetic or moral does
not seem very important.”
But a distinction between esthetic and
moral does seem to be important. Cer-
tainly it would be convenient if good-
ness in literature were identifiable with
goodness in morals, as many simple
minded critics and censors here and in
America believe. But literary and moral
standards and tastes change. Dr Bow-
den talks of “the experience of life
itself” —but there is surely, even for the
American, more than one experience of
life possible.
Dr Bowden’s beliefs seem to interpose
themselves between him and the novels.
He maintains “that religious principles
themselves are never mocked in ‘Huckle-
berry Finn’ ” —yet surely the way in
'which Huck talks about God and Heaven
and Hell show the incongruity, unbelieva-
bility and unnecessity of them? His dis-
cussion of “Huckleberry Finn” suffers,
too, from the necessity of making it
illustrate the theme of isolation—-which
for Dr Bowden is the novel’s central
concern. But though Huck himself may
be seeking isolation, this is not to say
that this is what the novel is about. It is

important, surely, that Huck never
achieves it, that all the way down the
river he encounters the brutal slave own-
ing society of the South. This would
make the novel more like “The Catcher
in the Rye”—which Dr Bowden sees as
an adolescent’s “angry criticism of our
civilization”. Perhaps Dr Bowden is
naif in his approach—certainly Huck
passes no criticisms, but this should not
blind us to the possibility of criticisms
as angry as those made explicitly by
Holden Caulfield. Dr Bowden, who
comes from Texas, does not make much
of the theme of slavery—which seems
a major one. He does refer to the
friendship between the adult Negro slave
Jim and the boy Huck, making a point
about their ages. “The age perhaps
makes little difference, for in many ways
Huck has never really been young, and
Jim, by the standards of civilization, has
never really grown up.” The standards
of whose civilization? Of Texas? Of
Alabama?
But whatever we might think of the
American novel or the American mind,
they are at least complex. Dr Bowden
traces through the theme of isolation
from its initial appearance as the frontier
isolation to the development of “its
question and its answer for the American
anywhere and at any time”. But isola-
tion is a very inclusive category, and
there's the disturbing thought that it is
so big as to be meaningless for a unify-
ing thematic analysis of different novels
—a blanket to stifle their differences.
It’s hard to see any real connection
between the isolation of Joe Christmas
of “Light in August” (from his Negro
blood) and that of Isabel Archer in “The
Portrait of a Lady” (from her disastrous
marriage). Worse, so much of the
“Portrait” is ignored in Dr Bowden's
treatment; the subtleties are trampled
over so that Ralph is “certainly” in love
with Isabel; the novel is “firmly set in the
American experience”—a limiting claim
that was made and disputed many years
ago. Worst of all is Dr Bowden’s inter-
pretation of the ending, an interpretation
that seems definitely wrong and that
could not have been made so baldly had
Dr Bowden compared the first edition
of the novel with the text of the Collected
edition; but nowhere does Dr Bowden
show any awareness of James’s textual
revisions.
There is much more to these novels
than and much more than Dr
Bowden ever indicates. A thematic run
through would not have been weakened
by some admission of other recurrent
themes, or by taking into account of
other possible interpretations, especially
in a book aimed not at professional
students of literature but at the “ideal
general reader”. The general reader
should be assured that there is more to
American literature than this, and that
Dr Bowden’s distasteful manner—a com-
posite of jingoism, Billy Graham and
MRA—is his manner and not the novel-
ists’. American literature is not as
crudely simple minded and restrictedlv
nationalistic as he says it is—“satisfying
.. .to real Americans who must live on
their own real frontiers”.

Reflections
Adam at Evening. David Wright. Hodder
and Stoughton. 16s.
Elsie Carew. Australian Primitive Poet
Nancy Keesing. The Wentworth Press.
10s. 6d.
Balcony: The Sydney Review. Department
of English University of Sydney. 4s.
“Adam at Evening” is an extremely
pleasant collection of occasional poems,
covering a variety of themes from
Edward Lear (“He was illiberal and un-
serious/In pointless limericks expressed
rage/ At mass society, the machine age”)
to reflections on love and approaching
middle age, and set in a variety of differ-
ent places—Johannesburg, Oxford, Cor-
fu, Fiesole, Rome and Sagres: places inti-
mately associated with Mr Wright’s own
life and not just post-card pieces.
Mr Wright is striking neither for his
music nor his imagery, but for his in-
formal prose-like directness of attack, so
that the funniest poems seem to me the
most successful —especially the group “A
Fish out of Water” with its hilarious
pieces “Highlife, Highgate” and its sec-
tion on a poetry reading at an embassy.
But the poem which celebrates a visit by
the poet (who is deaf) to the effigy of
St Cecilia strikes a note of rare and
moving intensity as does the title piece.
A selection of the verse and prose of
Elsie Carew has been gathered together
and sympathetically commented on by
Nancy Keesing in a monograph pub-
lished by The Wentworth Press. Miss
Keesing rightly calls Elsie Carew a primi-
tive poet —though many are likely to find
her prose of greater interest than her
verse and her personality as it emerges
from Miss Keesing’s account perhaps
more striking than either. This is an item
for collectors of Australiana and unusual
publications.
“Balcony”, a recent quarterly sponsored
by the Sydney University Arts Seminar
Society, started well with, among others,
articles on “Macbeth”, two pieces on
Henry James, a story and some good
poems. Anyone interested in poetry will
want this number for Christopher Ricks’
brilliant article “Atomology”, subtitled
“Alliteration, anagrams and arbitrari-
ness”. Mr Ricks is one of the finest cri-
tics writing in English at present—and he
says more of value in five pages than
many have said in several books.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Drought Hits Trade
TT'ffects of Australia’s drought are
going to be felt for quite some
time in the next year, even if adequate
rainfall occurs immediately in the
stricken areas.
Unfortunately many districts still re-
main in the grip of dry weather, so it
is disheartening to see export opportu-
nities lost at a time when the balance
of payments is taking a hiding.
The remarkable export markets for
wheat have proved a windfall for
Australia in the past, but today there
is not enough wheat to meet overseas
demands. At the same time, beef is
coming up against restrictive legisla-
tion in the US, where restraints have
been placed on imported meat sales in
14 States and are pending in another
10 States.
This is a reminder of the fuss which
arose over Australia’s beef sales to the
US last year, when quotas were impos-
ed. Instead of causing chaos, however,
Australia’s meat sales to the US have
not reached the quota imposed by the
US Government and the 100,000 tons
shipped for nine months to March are
less than two thirds of the 167,000
tons shipped in the corresponding nine
months to March, 1964.
The independent action of the
various States to introduce individual
legislation aimed to curb the sale of im-
ported meats evidently has embarras-
sed the US Government, because it has
been impelled to express concern at
the discrimination against foreign trade.
Some prodding on this subject was
done by Mr C. F. Adermann, Minister
for Primary Industry, while Australia’s
Department of Trade also made repre-
sentations to Washington.
It may signify no more than a pin-
prick to Washington, since there must
be dozens of nations frantically be-
laboring Uncle Sam at the moment on
the effect of dollar restrictions, which
inevitably must reduce exports to the
US. Coming on top of Treasurer Holt’s
plea on dollar restrictions, however,
the publicity on beef restrictions must
have been irritating.
When Uncle Sam releases the dollar
purse strings again, everyone will sigh
with relief. Yet looking at it with a
strictly fiscal eye, there is no denying
that the US Administration must have
received a severe jolt when it discover-
ed it had lost 975 million dollars in the
first four months of 1965. This is
almost eight times the total loss for
1964, when the net reduction was 125
million dollars.
Europeans, France leading, have
been converting dollars into gold as
they took precautions against a deva-
luation of sterling. If America solves
the balance of payments problem
C. F. ADERMANN
within the promised six or nine months
and if the UK makes progress in bol-
stering sterling, liquidity could flow
again, possibly boosted by the pro-
posed extension of international cre-
dits, including European agitation for
lower ratios of gold in international
reserves.
Stimulate Exports!
At a time when most nations are
looking anxiously at ways and
means to boost exports, the subject of
export restrictions by overseas com-
panies on their Australian subsidiaries
or associates becomes a touchy issue.
The Department of Trade and Industry
is investigating these restraints, parti-
cularly where the local company is
hindered by franchise arrangements.
It stands to reason that a parent
company in London is not anxious for
an Australian subsidiary to ship goods
to, say, the USA when the parent can
handle that market nicely, thank you,
and pay less freight. But there could
be instances where the parent company
might not compete so well in areas
closer to Australia, yet nevertheless
wants to maintain its own export
market.
Some sympathy can be generated
on both sides, especially if the capital
investment in building up an overseas
offshoot to a stage where it becomes
competitive with the parent is con-
sidered. Nonetheless, governments the
world over are anxious to bring money
into the export coffers, which means
that inter-company franchise arrange-
ments can be detrimental.
One way of overcoming the problem
without treading too heavily on any-
one’s toes is to provide such export
incentives that would make it imprac-
tical for the parent to place embargoes
on the local company’s exports.
The Federal Government has main-
tained a liberal attitude towards im-
ports, though there are now some
pressures arising to put a clamp on
imports as an offset to the drain on
overseas reserves. A few more incen-
tives to export might be part of the
answer, because imports have a definite
dampening effect on inflation.
US Profits Boom
An important development from
America’s increased involvement
in Vietnam and the Dominican Re-
public is the patriotic appeal to union
representatives to postpone threatened
strikes in the national interest.
Some cynics may conclude that a
renewed urgency for defence produc-
tion might give the unionists stronger
bargaining power. If so, it is not
reflected in the stock market. Labor
representatives agreed to postpone the
steel strike from May 1 to September
1, as a result of which . Wall Street’s
Dow Jones index climbed jubilantly
to a new record of 932.
Another bullish factor for Wall Street
was the continued good results flowing

through from important industrial '

much as a 16 p.c. improvement over
the correspond ins first quarter of
1964.
The benefits of several forms of tax
concessions are showing up with a
vengeance and investors are riding the
boom gleefully for all its worth.
The barometer of 19 times price-
earnings ratio still applies. This theory
is based on maintaining the market
price at around 19 times the per-share
earnings of the 30 key industrial stocks
in the Dow Jones averages. Followers
of the system point to the profit rises
of key stocks and say that the market
really hasn’t advanced because the
price-earnings ratio today is still the
same as it was a year ago. In other
words, the market price ratio to profits
has remained steady,
Adherents claim that if profits keep
rising, and they are confident they will,
the Dow Jones averages could hit the
magic 1000 this year, barring war
calamities, devaluation of sterling or
an unexpected dip in profits.
Bureaucracy Marches
Victorian Egg Board is to be
highly commended for hauling
two poultry farmers into court. It has
thus tipped its hand and has revealed
precisely why so many poultry farmers
have had Egg Boards up to the neck.
Each farmer was fined £lO for “fail-
ing to answer questions”. No more
than that.
The Egg Board believed that one
man was sending eggs interstate and
that the other was selling them to a
nearby store. It did not have to prove
anything, though. The men were fined
because they did not answer questions
put to them by an Egg Board inspector.
One had costs of £4OO awarded against
him. It has cost him £4lO for having
the temerity to think he is living in a
free country.
One of the farmers is a Mr Bacon.
No attempt at a cheap pun here—it is
far too serious a matter of principle.
But when the House of Representa-
tives debated the controversial Council
of Egg Marketing Authorities plan (the
brainchild of the Egg Boards) the
worthy representatives of the people
turned it into a circus. “Eggstraordin-
ary,” “a foul tax”, “something smells
here”, and so on, were some of the
interjections bandied about.
Two members, Mr Bate (Liberal,
NSW) and Mr Wilson (Liberal, SA),
did make an attempt to discuss the plan
in its true perspective—the one of
principle. Mr Bate said the Govern-
ment was going against its own clearly
stated policy in bringing down legisla-
tion without first having a poll of pro-
ducers. Mr Wilson said the bills flouted
every principle of responsible govern-
ment. But Mr Bate's amendment
lapsed for want of a seconder.
That’s the trouble with this egg busi-
ness. Too few people take it seriously
enough. It’s not an important enough
industry and somehow it seems unreal
to be getting steamed up about a mar-
keting scheme for eggs.
Perhaps people will take it seriously
when the CEMA plan becomes law
(which seems likely) and the courts be-
come filled with people who commit
the crime of not answering questions.
This CEMA plan is like no other in
existence or mooted in any primary
industry. It is a classic example worthy
of study, of how bureaucracy un-
checked insatiably attempts to con-
solidate itself.

What Cheer for Investors?
Eyes still on the balance of payments
Tn its descent since January the share
market’s main underlying fear has
been for the balance of payments pros-
pect. As we said in that month, con-
sidering various ill winds blowing up
from abroad, caution about this was
entirely realistic. Some of these winds
have reached us and made their presence
felt. Witness the big cut in capital in-
flow in the March quarter and reduc-
tions in some export prices. The toll
has been taken in a drop in overseas
reserves to little more than £7OO million,
some £l5O million lower than in June,
1964. Other ill winds such as President
Johnson’s capital export curbs and
Britain’s Budget have also blown in to
make our present prosperity seem less
comfortable. But with Mr Holt's latest
reassurances, lighter moods are pre-
sently prevailing.
In this period the buoyancy of the
economy has virtually counted for
nothing with investors, at least as a bull
point. As a bearish influence on their
calculations the burgeoning of economic
activity has been seen as holding two
sorts of threats. One is that the authori-
ties would step in with repressive mea-
sures to stop boom conditions develop-
ing. Dr Coomb's release of £29 million
special deposits, if not the Treasurer's
further rise in bond rate to get his loan
money, has helped to dispel this fear. It
has been in the market's mind for a long
time. The second threat is of more
recent origin. It is that, even if the
authorities are perhaps less anxious than
they were about the possibility of the
economy running too hot, strong fiscal
and monetary restraints might in any case
become inevitable unless the drift in the
balance of payments is arrested.
Shareholders shouldn't jump straight
to the conclusion that the local reflection
of the worsening balance of payments
will necessarily bear more heavily on
share prices than it has up to this stage.
Indeed the trend of markets might well
work out very differently, say in the not
unlikely event of the Government pro-
ceeding on lines that, faut de mieux, full
employment must be maintained. It
nearly had a nasty accident in 1961 try-
ing to cut the country's economic coat to
the reduced availability of overseas re-
sources. Its tailoring now could be
inhibited by that experience. In any
case the authorities no longer see the
possible courses of economic direction
in such stark black and white terms but
more as a spectrum of fine sophisti-
cated shades.
Unless the situation becomes much
more drastic than at present, one cannot
see the Government taking extreme
courses to correct the balance of pay-
ments. It is more likely to work behind
the scenes to sustain capital inflow and,
if necessary, as in 1961, draw on the
International Monetary Fund rather
than, say, re-impose import controls, de-
value or let the pound float, or put a
surcharge on imports in the British
manner. l
The first two of these possible courses
would not in themselves have much
patent effect on the local economic cli-
mate or stock exchange prices, except
perhaps to bolster confidence. On the
other hand, import restrictions and de-
DR H. C. COOMBS
valuation both certainly would and in-
vestors would not be complaining. As
for a surcharge on imports, Britain is
now using it successfully and appears to
have got away with a practice abhorrent
to the IMF. On the other hand this
measure would not work as rapidly in
reducing our imports as it has for Bri-
tain and it would bear more directly on
industrial costs in our case because our
imports are predominantly of producers’
goods.
The most feasible course politically
would possibly be to re-impose import
restrictions. This would re-create the
hot-house condition local industry
thrived on during the 19505. Sharemar-
kets would naturally take lively en-
couragement. However, import controls
should not be regarded as imminent, nor
perhaps on the cards at all, with such
keen supporters of the open-door policy
like Mr McEwen in the highest economic
policy-making places and other Ministers
seeing virtue in every shape and form
of competition for Australian industry.
On the other hand, as we pointed out
recently (The Bulletin, May 1, page
59), it would be logical to restrict im-
ports of non-defence goods if sufficient
overseas funds were not available to
finance our increased defence require-
ments from the US and Britain.
Further, while one can see the force
of arguments that import restrictions
would cramp development, remove some
of the valuable incentive to competition
and weaken an important buffer to in-
flation, a policy of wait and see based
on the present substantial margin of
overseas reserves over a possible danger
level could prove dangerous. The
authorities should take a hard, realistic
look at the prospects for reserves before
continuing on this tack. Admittedly im-
ports in April were lower than in March,
but there is no evidence of any slacken-
ing in the pace of fixed investment,
which has a very high import com-
ponent. Also, judging by the further
reductions in unemployment (if not on
the ANZ Bank's production figures), in-
dustrial output is rising and, equally,
retail sales jumped substantially in
March, both pointing to a continued
high demand for imports.
Against this and their own overseas
spending commitments, the authorities
have to make a realistic assessment of
the prospective levels of exports and
capital inflow to evaluate the risk in a
wait-and-see policy. Outsiders are not
in a sufficiently knowledgeable position
to forecast the possible drain on over-
seas funds from the complex of influ-
ences. Only last week we saw that these
included the redemption of a big London
loan.
In default of a direct onslaught like
import restrictions on the balance of
payments situation, the authorities would
have to rely on fiscal and monetary mea-
sures to influence the position. In this
context, the choices of what action to
take to prevent a boom developing and
those to cut the internal economic cloth
to fit the lessened availability of overseas
resources would have much in common.
Indeed, to the extent to which official
policy has been trying, not without suc-
cess, this last year or more to contain
extremely buoyant economic activity, it
might be argued that no change in direc-


tion but only a strengthening of measures
would be necessary to effect a better
balance in overseas payments. This
would not be to say that interest rate
policy and credit curbs alone could
bring about the required correction in
the balance of payments in all circum-
stances, nor, for that matter, even if this
w'as a closed economy, could it be
guaranteed that such measures would en-
sure a stable level of prices.
One of the most important elements
in the relative success of recent applica-
tions of monetary policy is that the
authorities have had the benefit of fairly
stable prices. The money rate of inter-
est has been virtually an effective rate.
If prices had been rising more rapidly
than they have been, one w'ould have
doubted very strongly whether the higher
interest rates imposed this year would
have worked as w'ell as they have in con-
taining the economic pace, because the
effective or real interest rate could con-
ceivably have been falling despite the
rise in money rates.
Also, the rises in money rates have
been reinforced by quantitative credit
restraint and a forceful approach by the
Central Bank to the trading banks to
curb new lending. Indeed, judging by
the present liquidity constriction, the
quantitative controls w'ould seem to be
doing the lion’s share of the job. Even
so, if it is intended to rely on monetary
policy to right the balance of payments
before the reserves run down to uncom-
fortably low levels, the danger ahead is
that price increases could accelerate and
greatly reduce the effectiveness of mone-
tary policy.
Turning to the role of fiscal policies,
one must confess to a degree of scepti-
cism for the simple reason that, although
it can be claimed that the last Budget is
now exerting a dampening influence on
the economy, one cannot envisage this
Government (or any other, for that mat-
ter) curbing its own spending sufficiently
to exert a moderating influence on
prices, despite what its White Papers may
claim. In the light of its expanded
spending commitments for defence and
education, this seems less likely to hap-
pen than ever in the approaching fiscal
year.
It will be said, of course, that the
increased taxation rates which are uni-
versally accepted as being in strong
prospect in the next Federal Budget, will
be the main Government instrument for
reducing the level of effective demand
and by that route exert a corrective in-
fluence on the balance of payments. But
after last year's taxation increases and
the rise in consumer prices this year and
last, the Government would do well to
consider the possibility that any further
increases in taxation will generate price
increases on a much wider scale than
the last ones.
Apropos of this, the Government
would do well to study very closely the
evi-dence pointing to a weakening in the
propensity to save mentioned here last
week. One presumes the Treasury has
had its experts closely following the por-
tents in this direction for a long time. If,
in fact, a weakening is in process, the
possibilities of making higher taxation an
effective instrument in stopping the drift
in the balance of payments w'ill have
been substantially reduced. Further it
must be presumed that this change in
saving habits makes the chances for
price increases so much greater and thus
poses difficulties for the future imple-
mentation of monetary policy. In these
circumstances, the resort to more direct
methods ,to right the balance of pay-
ments come more into the range of
possibilities. Remembering the halcyon
days of the 19505, the prospect of a little
inflation and possibly import controls
should cheer investors up.
CROESUS
Mr Snedden’s Sledgehammer
NZ’s example on restrictive trade
/Cabinet has made a great and clumsy
blunder in adopting the principle of
registration in the Restrictive Trade Prac-
tices Bill, w'hich is expected to make its
appearance any day, after the longest
period of law-making procrastination in
years. The business world will forgive
Mr Snedden for a lot of things in the
bill, but never for that. The pity is that
the Attorney-General had only to look
at the experience of the short-lived adop-
tion of registration in New Zealand, and
its subsequent replacement by the com-
plaint system, to realise that Sir Garfield
Barwick’s original proposals put forward
in 1962 were faulty, at least in this
respect.
Canada and New Zealand have found
that proceeding against practices on pub-
lic interest grounds by the more simple
avenue of complaint works very well.
After three years of registration, New
Zealand gave it away in 1961 in favor
of the complaint approach. Canada has
proceeded by the complaint method from
the beginning.
Registration requires a much more
cumbersome and inquisitive apparatus, in
fact a sledgehammer to crack what in
my view' is only a nut at any rate
in the field of bilateral practices which,
against the better judgment of the busi-
ness world, the Attorney-General is de-
termined to keep in the bill. Multilateral
practices, such as collusive tendering and
price cutting at a loss, can be made
proscribed practices and so do not re-
quire a registration procedure. It is worth
emphasising that both in Canada and NZ
inquiries can originate from the Com-
mission itself as well as public complaint
and that appeals against the Commis-
sion’s decisions can be made.
Thanks to inquiries made in New Zea-
land recently by Mr G. H. Underwood, a
Melbourne authority on trade practices,
at the Wellington offices of the Examiner
of Trade Practices and Prices, I am in
a position to illustrate just how well the
complaint approach has worked there in
the last three years, when 22 separate
enquiries have been made by the Com-
mission. This may also assist the public
here to see what sort of practices are
likely to attract the attention of the Re-
strictive Trade Practices Tribunal when
it is eventually set up here (this may not
be for a year at least, because apparent-
ly the bill is going to be left lying around
for some time for both Parliament and
public to have a good poke at).
To start on a morbid note, if only to
point the übiquity of restrictive trade
practices from cradle to grave, the NZ
Trade and Prices Commission w'as asked
to look into a complaint about excessive
funeral charges. As a result it made an
order requiring the NZ Federation of
Funeral Directors and five other associa-
tions of funeral directors to discontinue
their agreements relating to charges for
various classes of funerals ‘Tor the armed
forces, the police, mental hospitals, men-
tal boards and private people" (which
seems to embrace everybody).
Funeral charges in Australia might be
worth looking into also. Again, most
people would agree that hairdressing
charges might come high on the list for
an inquiry here, as they did in NZ.
There, after the NZ Council of Regis-
tered Hairdressers had recommended a
scale of higher charges for men’s and
boys’ haircuts, a complaint resulted in
the Commission ordering the agreement
to be discontinued and not revived. On
appeal the Commission’s decision was
upheld.
It can be imagined that quite a few
retail price and margin agreements would
not bear the public interest test in this
country. The NZ Commission has been
particularly busy in the field of groceries,
toys, weed-killers, books and so on.
Significantly though, following its investi-
gation into complaints about the agree-
ments of five major associations in one
trade, groceries, the Commission's deci-
sion that all price and margin fixing
agreements be terminated was reversed
on appeal in the case of two associations
(Wellington and Christchurch) and only
upheld in the other three cases.
This at least shows there can be room

for disagreement as to whether a trade
arrangement is against the public interest
and points to the need for an appeals
authority with practical businessmen on
it (Mr Snedden has apparently found
that businessmen are not anxious to be
represented on the tribunal he proposes
to set up but it would be most desirable
to have them on any appeal body).
Mr Underwood also tells me that the
NZ Commission has commenced an in-
quiry touching more obliquely than the
groceries case on the question of retail
pricing. This is into allegations that ar-
rangements or agreements are in opera-
tion which prevent retailers from com-
peting freely with each other and that
retailers are adopting a common mar-
gin of gross profit in setting their retail
prices of TV and radio sets and a wide
range of electrical household appliances.
Mr Snedden can expect a goodly total of
registration of restrictive trade practices
operating in this area of Australian busi-
ness.
Possibly after the trade war of the last
few years, when discounts, trade-ins and
suchlike selling devices have figured
prominently, the number has doubtless
withered considerably. But if the exposure
of anti-public interest agreements in
these trades were to be left to the ex-
pression of complaint, I doubt whether
many would be made in the current high-
ly competitive conditions of these trades.
In some instances, after the NZ Com-
mission disqualified a trade arrangement
as being against the public interest, the
guilty party has revised its agreement
and gained the Commission's approval
for it in the new form. This happened in
the case of electric lamps, in which after
inquiry the Commission ordered that
certain aspects of an agreement between
distributors of electric lamps be discon-
tinued in some respects and modified in
others. The manufacturers produced a
new agreement which did not contravene
the public interest and the Commission
decided not to make an order.
Not all complaints against trade asso-
ciations refusing membership to parti-
cular applicants from the trade were sub-
sfantiated. For instance, the Commission
decided not to make an order against the
NZ Plumbers Merchants’ Guild requiring
it to admit the Taupo Topara Timber
Company to membership. A similai deci-
sion was given by the Commission up-
holding the refusal of the Auckland
ectncal Wholesalers Association to
admit to membership the Appliance Deal-
ers Association Ltd, although in this
case the Commission laid down some
pretty tight rules for ensuring a minimum
of restriction in dealings for all New
Zealand electrical wholesalers’ associa-
t; ons>
t • •
In another case the Commission or-
v , , f ,
dered members of the NZ Committee of
, v,., r, „
the Australian and NZ Passenger Con-
ference to revoke an agreement with
their travel agents restraining the agents
from accepting bookings from non-Con-
ference lines. However, an appeal ruled
in favor of the Conference after it had
made some modifications to its agree-
ment.
In a complaint against the Quarry
Owners’ Association it was alleged that
prices and cartage rates for metal were
being fixed by the association but before
the Commission held its inquiry the as-
sociation decided to dissolve. This made
little difference to the finding, in which
the Commission made an order against
the individual members of the association
prohibiting the practices.
Forestalling action was also taken in
a case of collusive tendering when agree-
ment among glazing contractors as to
the prices to be tendered for glazing work
was terminated before the Commission
began hearing the complaint. An order
was made prohibiting the parties from re-
viving the agreement or repeating the
practice of submitting tenders on a pre-
arranged basis, but not prohibiting them
from tendering jointly.
The general impression given of the
working of the NZ legislation is that by
precept rather than weight and nume-
rous convictions the message is getting
through to the commercial world that
anti-social restrictive trade practices will
not stand up to the light of the Com-
mission’s day.
There, without doubt, some have
been driven underground by the ever-
present threat of a complaint being made.
Numerous others have been terminated
lest they be brought to the notice of the
Commission.
The same processes will occur here
when Mr Snedden's legislation becomes
a reality. His hope, of course, is that
the obligation to register will bring more
out into the open than in NZ and he may
well be right. Yet few of these are likely
to be against the public interest, so why
put the whole business community to
the trouble to register bilateral agree-
ments? It will be waste of time and paper.
When registration was necessary in
NZ between 1958 and 1961 the Minister
said only a handful of the public paid
the ss. fee to examine the register. Such
was the level of public interest. Is it any
greater here?

The Seeds of Research
Work to improve fodder crops
Australia is on the verge of exciting
agricultural developments, with both
Governments, governmental bodies and
private enterprise unlocking the secrets
of continued and greater pasture im-
provement and producing better yielding
and better quality crop seeds.
Wide areas of land once thought to be
unproductive, either because of econo-
mic or climatic conditions, now look like
being opened up and developed to be-
come an important unit in the Austra-
lian agricultural whole. Areas such as
the brigalow country in Queensland are
now the subject of intensive research,
financed at Government level. Huge
sums of money are being poured into
development—money, which on present
indications, certainly does not look like
being wasted.
The use of tropical and sub-tropical
fodder crops in the brigalow area pro-
mises to make economically available
millions of acres of cattle grazing land.
Research into what types of fodder
crops are most suited to the area has
been done mainly by governments, :
though private enterprise has been able
to assist in a relatively small way.
Work being carried out in Australia
on tropical and sub-tropical crops has:
placed us, say experts, in the forefront
of world research in this field. What
happens in Australia is being watched
and. used overseas. As a result of the
research being carried out in Australia
there is a strong possibility that we could
become a leading producer of tropical
and sub-tropical seeds. Already South
America is being examined as a potential
big buyer. Other countries in areas
where the seeds could be of commercial
value are being closely watched. Two
important companies engaged in develop-
ment and production of seed for these
fodder crops are Andersons Seeds Ltd
and Arthur Yates and Co. Pty Ltd.
Andersons at Duranbah, an ex-dairy
farm in a small valley on the NSW east
coast near the Queensland border, is
conducting an extensive programme of
development of tropical and sub-tropical
legumes. Yates, on the other hand, is
carrying out its developmental work, and
producing seeds, by contract growing—
farming the sowing and harvesting work
out to contract farmers.
Mr Philip Yates, chairman of Arthur
Yates and Co., said all research in Aus-
tralia into tropica] and sub-tropical
varieties of seed had been carried out by
the CSIRO. He said his company had
recently undertaken a market survey of
areas in which these types of seed would
be grown. “The survey suggests a very
great increase in the use of sub-tropical
and tropical seeds," he said. “However,
the, main increase in the use of these
seeds appears to be in the brigalow
country, with lesser use in other areas.”
Mr E. Gattenby, sales manager of
Andersons Seeds, said that despite dry
conditions in NSW and Queensland there
had been an excellent demand for new
tropical and sub-tropical seed species.
“Very dry conditions which prevailed
through spring, summer and autumn in
NSW and Queensland had a considerable
effect on the market for pasture seeds,;
but sales of the new varieties have been
excellent.
“Recent rains in NSW and good rains
in Queensland have caused a quite dra-
matic increase in demand for all types of
seeds. There has been a ready market for
things which will grow quickly to pro-
duce feed for the winter and spring.”
Mr Gattenby said tropical and sub-

tropical seeds were suited to better rain-
fall areas of the world situated between
30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees
north. “This means they are ideal for
the area north of Taree, NSW, to Cook-
town in Queensland and west to Dar-
win.” Andersons markets its sub-tropical
and tropical seeds under the name Terra-
nova. They first came on the market
under that name in 1963 and since then
“sales have been most encouraging. The
demand for the seed has consistently ex-
ceeded supply despite a many-fold in-
crease in production. We anticipate that
a similar- situation will exist this year,
when we will have a continuation of
demand as these new species have shown
up to great advantage during the dry
weather. The dry weather has meant
that our all-over seed production this
year, while much larger than last year,
will not be as big as we had planned.”
But research into seeds and seed pro-
duction is not only confined to the agri-
cultural applications. There is constant
work on vegetables and flowers. Yates,
for instance, has a 25-acre research farm
at Castle Hill, on the northern outskirts
of metropolitan Sydney. There the
company is continuously testing seeds
and developing new ones.
A problem facing our seed producers
is the lack of breeding rights in Australia.
In Western Europe, the UK, the US
and Africa, some protection is afforded
breeders who develop new types of plants
and seeds. In Australia a seed producer
can spend years of painstaking research
to develop flower, vegetable or crop
seeds before placing them on the marker.
Once they are on the market they are
anybody’s game and can be copied (or
produced) by anyone. For this reason
there is probably less money spent, per
capita, by private enterprise in Australia
on seed breeding and research than in
most other countries. Given breeders’
rights, the seed producer can licence
other seed growers to produce his “inven-
tion” and receive royalties from the sales.
As there are no breeders’ rights in
Australia, companies like Andersons and
Yates can spend a lot of time and money
to place new varieties of seed on the
market only to find in a short space of
time that other seed producers are doing
the same.
Mr Philip Yates feels breeders’ rights
are necessary in Australia to allow more
money to be spent by private enterprise
on research. Another benefit of the
introduction of rights would be the
greater number of higher quality seeds
which would be offered for sale. “This
in turn would mean cheaper production
because of the higher yields which would
become available,” he said.
As long as breeders’ right are not
granted in Australia, seed - producing
companies could tend to become like
their American counterparts. In Amer-
ica, breeders’ rights are not available on
seeds but are granted on plants like roses
grown from cuttings. Lack of protec-
tion afforded the seed producer in the US
has meant that he has turned to hybrids
—seeds which are produced from the
most desirable “parents” because of
particular high yielding qualities, resist-
ance to disease, and so on. While the
producer markets his seed, he retains
the “parents” so other producers cannot
grow exactly the same strain of hybrid
seed as the owner of the “parents” can.
Mr Yates said that although Australian
seed breeders did not place as much
commercial emphasis on hybrids as did
the Americans it was possible that more
hybrid breeding would be undertaken if
breeders’ rights were not granted.
“Breeders’ rights will become in-
creasingly important in Australia,” he
said.

Exporting to Turkey
Foreign exchange crisis hits sales
From RONALD ANDERSON
A ustralia’s exports to Turkey are ex-
pected to be down by about 30 p.c.
when the final figures for 1964 are avail-
able. This will be the first time in years
that our sales to Turkey have failed to
show a substantial rise. In fact, over
the last five years or so, the “sick man
of Europe” has been Australia’s best
customer in the Middle East-Eastern
Mediterranean region.
The trouble, of course, is Turkey's
chronic foreign exchange crisis, which
caused the Turkish Government to im-
pose tight import quotas last year and
further reduce allocations in 1965. Aus-
tralia is thus not alone in seeing her
sales reduced. In fact, although total
sales may be down steeply again in 1965,
we could well slightly increase our share
of the overall Turkish market in both
years.
The seriousness of the continuing
Turkish crisis is shown by the Govern-
ment's decision to cut the wool import
quota by a further 25 p.c. for 1965.
Wool, which dominates Australia’s sales
tc Turkey (£8 million out of £8.3 million
in 1962-63), is virtually an essential
import.
The Turks, who are struggling to raise
the national income by 7 p.c. between
1963 and 1967, are also growing restive
about the marked imbalance of trade
between Turkey and countries such as
Australia. In our case we sell Turkey
more than sixty times as much as we
buy from her.
Apart from wool she buys hides,
oleostearine (used in soap and rubber
industries), machinery, iron and steel
products, fertilisers, sports-goods, re-
fractory-bricks, fish-nets and a score of
other minor items. In return we buy
less than £70,000 worth of hazel-nuts,
dried figs, fig puree, mercury, tobacco,
walnut logs and carpets.
One Turkish firm has just sold several
small shipments of handknitted pull-
overs in Australia the ironic touch
being that they were knitted of Aus-
tralian wool.
Unless Australia makes an effort to
buy more from Turkey, the trade im-
balance will almost certainly grow, with
possible repercussions. Apart from the
present foreign exchange crisis a growth
in Turkish demand for Australian
merino wool is inevitable.
In spite of a 60 p.c. illiteracy rate and
low per capita income Turkish living
standards are rising slowly. With them
is rising the demand for better quality
Western-style clothing, which cannot be
made from coarse, short-fibre Turkish
wool. Turkey has already banned the
import of scoured wool —she prefers to
scour it herself, making use of cheap
local labor. Now that Australia has
shown herself willing to offer short-term
credit on wool purchases, Turkey is buy-
ing more and more of her merino wool
direct from Australia, instead of through
Continental and British intermediaries.
Shipping difficulties hinder the growth
of Australian trade with Turkey in fields
other than wool. Because they must be
transhipped at Suez, Genoa or Trieste,
Australian orders take up to three
months to reach Istanbul and cannot
compete with the three to five-week
delivery times of Italy and Britain.
Nor are Australian exporters very
interested in Turkey. Only about half
a dozen visited Turkey in 1964. Most
of them were undoubtedly discouraged
by the freight rates which would price
their products out of the competitive
Turkish market. For the present, it
seems, Turkey must be added to that
long list of nations which buy our wool
but which must otherwise be regarded
in terms of future potential.

Some Pleasing Behavior
Generosity from United Uranium
PT'he Is. a share dividend declared at
A the annual meeting of United
Uranium was certainly a pleasant sur-
prise for shareholders. In mid-April,
when directors announced that profit in
the year to December 31 had toppled
from £373,000 to £170,000, they said
that every effort was being made to con-
serve funds until the future of the group
was known. The contract to supply
uranium oxide to the UK Atomic Energy
Authority has expired. Mining cannot
be resumed unless commercial demand
stages a rise to a level which will make
a return to production economic.
It is a happy change to see the con-
servation of funds being executed
through some other means than the with-
holding of dividends. At the annual
meeting it was announced that the num-
ber of directors would be reduced from
seven to five, and board fees had been
cut by 25 p.c. since January 1. The
move is even more generous when one
considers that shareholders have already
collected a steady 2s. dividend for the
1964 year, despite the lower profits.
The company’s mines are now on a
care - and - maintenance basis. Directors
believe that operations may be economic-
ally resumed by 1970 if commercial
demand rises to the extent expected. In
the meantime they will not be just sitting
about. The milling plant has been con-
verted to extract gold from the mill
residues. Means of employing technical
and financial resources until 1970 are
being actively sought. A subsidiary,
United Exploration, continues to test
various mineral deposits.
At present, certain companies in
Arnhem Land are being investigated.
The group will never lack powerful
partners in developing deposits, share-
holders were told at the meeting. Direc-
tors will consider any call on the com-
pany, whether it is to take part in mining
bauxite in the Territory or to provide
some knowhow on Gove. The group has
a very wide experience of mining and
local conditions in the north of Aus-
tralia.
Rewarding Issue
PThe news of a one-for-four par (10s.)
-*■ issue to the shareholders of Danks
Holdings brings to a peak the period of
improving prosperity which they have
enjoyed over the past three years. The
company operates from Melbourne as a
hardware merchant, wholesaler and steel
merchant. In 1962-63 the group return-
ed to the dividend list for the first time
since 1956 with a distribution of 31- p.c.
This followed a more than 60 p.c. jump
in profit to £85,000 which equalled 14.5
p.c. on capital. The profits for this and
the previous year contrasted strongly
with the loss of £152,000 incurred in
1960-61.
Last year the profit rose again to
£98,000 and the dividend was more than
doubled to 74 p.c. Earning rate on capital
came out at 16.8 p.c. The dividend was
the highest paid since 1951-52. The re-

suit was after tax of £60,000, no tax
being necessary in the previous year be-
cause of unrecouped losses. Directors
said at the time that the benefits of these
losses would continue to some extent in
the current year.
In the latest December half-year, esti-
mated profit was £69,000 well more
than half of the £98,000 earned in 1963-
64. The result was entirely due to a 21
p.c. increase in sales over the period. Full
dividend for the current year is to be
lifted again to 8 p.c. The interim was
raised to 4 p.c. and directors said last
week that 8 p.c. dividends would be
maintained on capital after the issue.
However, one should not suffer under
the impression that growth has stopped
and the issue just icing on top of the
cake. In fact, it seems that the rate of
growth may very well increase over the
next few years, subject to economic con-
ditions, of course. The £146,000 to be
raised is needed to increase the group’s
working capital, thus indicating that
business is still on the up and up.
Actually around £300,000 of extra
cash is required. The rest of this will be
raised through an issue of 8 p.c. unsecur-
ed notes. Although earnings this year will
cover the higher dividend requirement at
least twice, directors have established a
wise balance between loan and equity
capital. They could have easily raised it
all from shareholders. This would have
left too much capital to be serviced and
dividends may have suffered in the event
of a setback, temporary or otherwise.
Record from Beer
rPooTH and Co. Ltd’s increase in divi-
dend from 14i p.c to 153 p.c.
seems' to have settled any sharemarket
hopes of a bonus issue for another year.
When the company announced the
higher payout and a 13 p.c. increase in
profit for the year to March 31, the 20s.
shares were cut back 2s. 6d. to 995. 6d.
In their first-ever preliminary report
(previously directors announced the final
dividend and results w'hen the annual
accounts were released), directors say
profit rose £284,348 to £2,363,340 after
tax of £2,169,555 (1963-64, £2,060,445)
and depreciation of £1,083,374
(£993,577). Earning rate goes from
p.c. to 21.8 p.c. on the paid capital of
£10,819,650.
This is the third year in succession
Tooth has raised its dividend. It was cut
from 16 p.c. to 111 p.c. in 1955-56,
following a one-for-two bonus issue, but
since then has risen almost every year.
The only exception was in 1961-62 when
it was held at 13i p.c. following a one-
for-six issue at par.

Business is good but it could be a lot better for
him if he could install new machinery. But he doesn’t

His answer is to lease new machinery through
General Credits. They lay out the ready cash,
he pays a fixed monthly rental and deducts the
payments in full from his income tax.

an additional £110,445 tax required by
the higher company tax rates. Directors
say the actual accounts will be available
on May 29.
Union Charges
Qeeing that Victorian trustee groups
increased their scale of charges in
August last year, last week’s result from
Union-Fidelity for the year to February
28 can hardly be considered inspiring.
Profit rose from £32,000 to £34,000 in
round figures, equalling 19.2 p.c. on paid
capital as against 18.4 p.c. in 1963-64.
Even though the increased charges
applied for only seven months, a slightly
better result was expected.
Perhaps increased costs, higher tax
liability or the necessity for extra
depreciation offset any increase in
income. If such was the case, it was not
pointed out in the brief report from the
directors. In fact, no figures were given
at all for tax and depreciation, which
took £12,962 and £6887 .respectively last
year.
It seems that one or more of these
items must have increased over the latest
year. Despite the increase expected in
income, the rise scored in profits is
smaller than it has been for several years.
Since 1961 profits have risen from
£22,000 to £25,000 to £30,000 to
£32,000 in 1963-64. The tapering-off
which was evident last year has continued
despite the higher scale of charges.
Strangely enough, these charges are
still below the limits provided by Section
17 of the Trustee Companies Act. How-
ever, last year’s rise brought them into
line with charges in NSW.
Shareholders Bypassed
away in the buoyant March-
quarter report from Walter Wright
Industries last week was a rather dis-
appointing titbit of news for the share-
holders. Directors of the heavy haulage
and movement engineer said that a
private long-term loan of £60,000 has
been taken at an undisclosed rate of
interest. It was borrowed to improve
liquidity and to provide finance for the
move to new premises in West Mel-
bourne.
This seems to indicate that a share-
holders’ issue will not be made in the
near future. After an extremely success-
ful 1963-64, the continued strain on
existing capital and assets, and the move
to new premises, an issue was expected
in many quarters. Performance in the
current year had enhanced these hopes.
Pre-tax profits in the December half
were up 25 p.c., and for the nine months

to the end of March results were “sub-
stantially” ahead of those for the cor-
responding period of last year.
The group has paid steady 10 p.c.
dividends but has not issued to share-
holders since listing in 1960. Earning
rates have risen from 13.9 p.c. in 1961
to 16.3 p.c. in 1963 and to a record 21.3
p.c. last year. The rate will be higher this
year and dividends could have easily
been maintained after an issue. A number
of companies operating in the currently
booming transport business have already
shared their prosperity with shareholders
through an issue or just a higher divid-
end.
High rates of .turnover have put such
a strain on Walter Wright’s liquidity that
even a mere increase in dividend may be
too much to hope for in the current
year. Substantial sales rises necessitated
additions to the vehicle fleet over the
latest three months. Labor is short and
costs are increasing. Continued expansion
has also stretched the capacity of the
present Flemington premises. In addi-
tion, extra liquid cash will be required
to pay the interest bill on the new loan.
Undoubtedly the directors are follow-
ing a policy which they consider best in
the long run. If and when the transport
boom stops and profits ease back to
lower levels, it will be a pity if the
shareholders have been denied a direct
share in the fruits of the current pros-
perity.
Engineer s Issue
VI/’illiam Adams and Co. Ltd, Sydney-
TT based steel merchant and engineer,
plans to raise additional' funds with an
issue of ordinary shares at a premium.
However, details of the issue have not
been finalised.
The group’s board will announce the
size of the issue and the ratio by the
time the accounts are released early in
July. The last issue, a one-for-five at par,
was made in 1961.

Profit for the half-year stands at

result of £537,927. Expected improve-
ments in sales and substantial orders
held by a subsidiary could mean a
higher profit for the whole of 1964-65.

higher than for the previous correspond-
ing period. The increase was achieved
even with the effects of the subsidiary
A. E. Goodwin’s transfer during the
period to the new headquarters at
Auburn. Sales of Healing were also
influenced by the disruption of supplies
from important sub-contractors to its
domestic appliance division.
Directors add that substantial orders
are held by A. E. Goodwin and other
engineering subsidiaries, while the re-
sumption of normal supplies to the Heal-
ing companies should improve sales.
Not So Sweet
A ustralia’s second largest raw sugar
producer Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd
suffered a severe setback in the year to
December 31 but is holding its dividend
at 18 p.c. the rate established in 1963
when earnings rose to a record
£1,177,572.
However, the latest profit is the second
highest earned by the company. It stands
at £605,337 and remains after greatly
reduced tax of £135,896 (previously
£760,271) and higher depreciation of
£305,068 (£233,262). Earning rate tum-
bles from 78.5 p.c. to 22.4 p.c. because
of the profit drop and capital increased
during the year by a one-for-five premium
issue which was closely followed by a
one-for-two bonus issue.
The issues lifted paid capital to
£2,700,000 compared with £1,500,000 at
the end of 1963.
The brief directors’ statement does not
explain the heavy profit fall. However, a
year ago directors explained that the
record 1963 profit (a threefold increase
on the previous year’s earnings) was due
to the high price of sugar and increased
production. Since then the world price
of sugar has fallen to around the
£28 7 10/- a ton level while the cost of
production has increased.
Pioneer Sugar’s 10s. shares, currently
selling for about 28s. 6d., return 6.3 p.c.
from the dividend.
Temporary Fall
Ty|Ei.BOURNE-BASED Brick and Pipe In-
dustries. formerly just Brick In-
dustries, will have done very well if pro-
fits have been maintained in the latest
year to March 31. But increases made to
capital over the period indicate that the
earning rate will be lower. In the recent
report to shareholders, directors an-
nounced that last year’s 123 p.c. dividend
would be maintained and profits were
expected to be on a par with last year’s
record result.
The figures are to be released as soon

as auditing is completed. The 1963-64
profit was £356,000, though the benefits
of investment allowances enabled this
result after tax of only £164,000. The
group's programme of extensive plant
development was tapered off in 1964-65,
so these benefits will no longer apply.
This development was one of the factors
which has almost trebled profits over
the past four years. Its success will be
further proved if profits are maintained
in the latest year, despite the higher tax
liability.
Last year's record profit equalled 18.2
p.c. on capital, down from 20 p.c. on
lower capital in the previous year. Capi-
tal will be higher this year because of
acquisitions which have taken place.
Last July, two-thirds of C. Butler Brick
Works was bought for 67,200 ss. shares
and around £38,000 in cash. And in
October, 600,000 shares were placed at a
premium of 7s. each.
The £360,000 raised was used to ex-
pand Commonwealth Pottery (a sub-
sidiary), acquire two-thirds of Standard
Brick Works (Box Hill) and pay off the
cash portion of the earlier Butler take-
over. The three projects w'ere not ex-
pected to reach their full value to the
group for a while.
As all this new capital will not rank
for the full year to March 31, the fall in
earning rate should be only minor and
the 12+ p.c. dividend should still be well
covered. Of course it will rank for 1965-
66, when the projects should each be
contributing to their full extent and pro-
fits will be boosted. So investors should
remember that the fall in earning rates
expected when the latest results are re-
leased is only temporary.
Trailing Clouds
"Tlespite “some clouds hanging over the
national economy”, Sydney-based
electrical engineer and merchant Jeffries
Industries Ltd is “optimistic about the
future as to both (the company's) manu-
factured and imported lines”, acting
chairman Mr G. H. Routley told share-
holders at the annual general meeting.
He said the company was experiencing
buoyant current trading, with group sales
for the first four months of this year
13 p.c. higher than for the comparable
period in 1964. Group turnover for the
period to November, 1964, exceeds sales
of the previous comparable period. “But,
of course, we were faced with rising
costs,” Mr Routley said.
The present full employment situation
seems to be affecting most industries.
Jeffries is no exception. Said Mr Routley:
“Currently and for many months we have
had a chronic labor shortage and, in com-
mon wdth most other manufacturers, we

Mr Routley names, as the “clouds
hanging over the economy”, a substantial
reduction in overseas reserves, the drying-
up of capital inflow, exchange control,
import restrictions, credit restrictions or
increased taxation. However, he says,
“presently we have a high volume of
forward orders and plans for further
expansion”.
Buying Up
puRTHER efforts by British Tobacco to
acquire a substantial majority hold-
ing in Dodge Consolidated Holdings Ltd
have been approved by Dodge’s direc-
tors. They say they intend to recom-
mend the offer to shareholders and
say they will accept for their own hold-
ings.
At present British Tobacco owns 43.2
p.c. of Dodge shares. Providing share-
holders accept the offer (275. cash for
one-third of each holding) British To-
bacco’s interest will rise to 62.1 p.c. The
bid is worth £898,348.
The offer is being made through Bri-
tish Tobacco’s printing and packaging
subsidiary Leigh Mardon Pty. British
Tobacco holds a 60 p.c. interest in Leigh
Mardon while the balance is held by the
UK packaging group Mardon Interna-
tional Ltd, which itself is jointly owned
by British American Tobacco and Im-

record £Fijian 191,795 £F28,766
higher than the previous year’s profit.
Enhanced prices for the island’s main
primary products, sugar and copra, were
reflected in greater spending power, say
directors. This in turn resulted in a more
buoyant economy and assisted in main-
taining a much improved turnover in mer-
chandise. Overall trading results proved
very satisfactory and ample provision
has been made against doubtful debts and
stock and plant depreciation.
1 he latest result remains after unstated
tax and £F101,495 depreciation. Div-
idend is steady at 10 p.c.
Patience Rewarded
"Deflecting a very prosperous little
wave which it has been riding, Mel-
bourne-based tool maker Patience and
Nicholson is to make a one-for-five issue
of ss. shares to shareholders at a 2s. 6d.
premium. The shares are bringing well
above 7s. 6d. on the market and, as the
group’s well-established 12 p.c. dividend
will undoubtedly continue, the issue will
provide handsome benefits all round.
An issue was made on the same basis
in 1962-63, but profits and the earning
rate have continued to climb. Earning
rate rose from 15.9 p.c. to 16.7 p.c. in
that year and, after a record profit of
£llB,OOO last year, it rose again to an
extremely healthy 18.8 p.c.
On present indications, this trend will
continue in spite of the increases which
are to be made to paid capital (in all,
the issue will raise about £188,000). For
the six months to December last, the
parent lifted sales by 21 p.c. over the
previous corresponding period. The in-
crease in profit was described as “satis-
factory”. The company distributes its
12 p.c. dividend in one lump at the end
of the year, so no interim payment was
declared.


The Chairman of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, Sir Maurice Mawby,
has reported to shareholders that the calendar year 1964 was one of record
profit, major developments, and further diversification of Group interests.
He forecast that 1965 should be another profitable and successful year.
INCREASED PROFIT: Consolidated profit rose from £3.5 millions
in 1963 to £5.6 millions in 1964, the equivalent of 24.5 pence
per share (15.4 pence in 1963) on capital increased by the three for
ten bonus issue in December last. The main reason for this improvement
was the increased earnings obtained from mining and smelting operations
in lead, silver and zinc, due chiefly to higher metal prices.
REVIEW OF
C.R.A. ACTIVITIES
INCREASED AUSTRALIAN EQUITY
The Australian equity interest in C.R.A. is being
increased from approximately 10% to 15%
through a renounceable rights issue of 5,555,174
ordinary shares, at an issue price of 34/-. This
issue will provide total funds of £9,443,796, which
will be used to help finance developments such as
the Hamersley iron ore and Comalco aluminium
projects.
AVERAGE METAL PRICES RISE
C.R.A.’s lead/silver/zinc interests at Broken Hill
—the wholly owned Zinc Corporation, and 32%
owned New Broken Hill Consolidated mines—
achieved higher profits in 1964. The average metal
prices realized by Zinc Corporation increased from
£75.4.5 to £113.5.10 per ton for lead, and from
£94.19.4 to £136.8.0 for zinc.
Smelting interests also had a better year. The divi-
dend from the 50% owned Broken Hill Associated
Smelters increased from 12% to 13%, and profits
from the Cockle Creek subsidiary. Sulphide Cor-
poration, were substantially greater than in 1963.
JAPAN’S COAL DEMAND GREATER
New South Wales coal interests showed improved
results because of greater demand from Japan,
while mineral sands and timber interests produced
satisfactory returns. Consumer acceptance of the
brick subsidiary’s product continues to be good.
COMALCO MAKES APPRECIABLE PROFIT
The Comalco Group (50% owned) made an ap-
preciable profit for 1964, a significant improve-
ment on its loss for 1963. Output from the Weipa
bauxite field is being expanded fivefold, and Weipa
is emerging as a major supplier to the world alu-
minium industry.
The Bell Bay smelter operated close to its in-
stalled capacity of 52.000 tons per year. Expansion
moves at Yennora, New South Wales, will make
the aluminium semi-fabrication facilities there the
most complete and up-to-date in the country.
HAMERSLEY IRON ORE CONTRACT SECURED
Hamersley Iron (60% owned) has obtained a con-
tract to supply 65.5 million tons of iron ore to
steel mills in Japan. Shipments of this ore, valued
at around £270 million, will commence in August,
1966, and be spread over approximately 16 years.
Development of mining, rail transport and ship-
ping facilities in Western Australia is well ad-
vanced.
AND IN ADDITION:
• A new subsidiary, Greenleaf Fertilizers Limited,
has been formed, through which Group fertilizer
output in New South Wales will be doubled to
1,000,000 tons per annum.
• Mineral sands output on North Stradbroke
Island, near Brisbane, is being doubled by the
end of 1965 to meet rising demand.
• An important copper project at Cobar, New
South Wales (23-1/3% owned), is due to com-
mence production next July.
• A £6 million treatment plant is being installed
by Broken Hill Associated Smelters (50% own-
ed) at Port Pirie to produce 30,000 tons of
electrolytic zinc per annum from accumulated
residues.
ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
The major part of pew capital required for C.R.A.
Group developments will come from outside bor-
rowings by subsidiary and associated companies.
The balance will come from the internal resources
of the C.R.A. Group, the current share issue and
partners.
FUTURE OUTLOOK - GOOD
C.R.A. has before it the firm prospect of streng-
thened earning power and continued growth, with
a much wider spread of interests than lead and
zinc, upon which past prosperity has largely de-
pended. Indications are that lead and zinc will
remain in strong demand throughout 1965, but
even if the present prices are not maintained,
C.R.A. should have another profitable and suc-
cessful year.
Hamersley Iron should show a satisfactory return
to C.R.A. beginning in 1967, and the Comalco
aluminium Group, which is now profitable, should
grow in importance as a substantial income earner.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Testing the Cult of “Growth” Stocks
Hunter Douglas comes out very well
who have been involved in the
A sharp decline in the general level
of ordinary share prices over the last
two months because they have continued
to hold the low yielding stocks must
now be wondering whether the cult of
the “growth” stock was a false one. This
cult is based on the belief that, providing
earnings per share continue to increase,
the price of the shares will increase at
an even greater rate and no one will
take any interest in the immediate or
prospective dividend yield.
The shares of Hunter Douglas Ltd
have sold during the 1965 year at prices
as high as 21s. and as low as 17s. 6d.
At these prices the dividend yield has
varied between 4.8 p.c. and 5.7 p.c. In
fact, since the beginning of 1962 (when
the name of Hunter Douglas first ap-
peared on the Sydney share list), the
price of the shares has ranged from
245. 7d. down to 155., which means that
the dividend yield has ranged from 4.1
p.c. up to 6.7 p.c. The earnings yield
has ranged between 6.8 p.c. and 10.7
p.c., which is only slightly narrower
than the dividend yield range. It is
interesting to note that at 21s. (the
highest price paid this year) the divi-
dend yield is 4.8 p.c. and the earnings
yield is 6.9 p.c. Dural Leeds, which
would seem to be the stock which can
be most logically compared with Hunter
Douglas, sold as high as 225. 3d. this
year and at that price the dividend yield
was 3.4 p.c. and the earnings yield 7.3
p.c.
However, the price of Dural Leeds’
shares has fallen by 321- p.c. from the
1965 peak, but the price of Hunter
Douglas shares has only fallen by 12 p.c.
It will be as well to look for the
reasons which have helped to maintain
the share price while the market generally
has been moving downward rapidly. The
first, and perhaps the most important
point, would seem to be that the bulk
of the shares are “well held”. In other
words, they are owned by people who are
unlikely to sell on the open market at
any time and certainly not when the
prices are down. When the original
merger with Mello-lite took place in
November, 1962, one million shares
were issued to the shareholders of
Hunter Douglas Australia Pty Ltd, thus
giving them 73 p.c. of the equity. While
this percentage may be reduced to 65
p.c. when the convertible notes become
shares at the end of this year, it still
represents a very substantial portion of
the total capital. In other words, there
is always the possibility that the price
of the shares includes an element of
“scarcity” value.
The company announced its interim
profit figures about six weeks ago, dis-
closing that for the first half of the
1964-65 year after-tax profit was up by
over 471 p.c. This would mean that,
even if the profits in the second half
were the same as those for the second
half of 1963-64, the earning rate for this
year will rise to nearly 19 p.c. the
highest rate in the company’s history.
This means that at current prices the
earnings yield is likely to be much closer
to 10 p.c. than it is to the 7 p.c. it would
be on the basis of last year’s figures. The
realisation that the earning rate could
reach this figure would in itself have
been sufficient in times of more buoyant
share markets to increase the price of
Hunter Douglas’ shares quite markedly
and has no doubt served to maintain it
during the present general decline.
factor which should be of im-
portance is that the company’s sales
are related to trends in home building.
In the last directors’ report it was stated:
“Many of the company’s products are
closely related to new building construc-
tion in their demand, but respond some-
what more slowly to the tempo of the
basic building industries. These products
are for the most part only now benefiting
from the increased building activity.” In
the interim report, after mentioning the
“good” demand for the Luxaflex, Shade-
master and Mello-lite products, the
following statement appeared: “Apart
from these products a very appreciable
contribution to the gains in sales and
profits were attributed to new products
pioneered over the last few years, which
are now well established.”
Clearly, it is not sufficient to rely on
a particular product or products in any
industry closely related to home furnish-
ing, because they can become out-dated
with changing tastes— particularly in
Australia today where taste is changing
rapidly and is influenced not only by
trends in Europe, because of the influx
of Europeans, but also by an increasing
interest in Asian styles, particularly
Japanese. Hunter Douglas, which has
a considerable degree of vertical integra-
tion, is in a strong position to maintain
and develop its leading position in this
industry. While many other companies
assemble blinds and awnings, Hunter
Douglas also produces the aluminium
strip that is used in these and other pro-
ducts.
Looking at the profit position since
the acquisition of Mello-lite, it would
appear to be unexciting by almost any
standards that the analyst may care to
employ. In fact, it is possible to demon-
strate that the earnings per share have
actually declined. If convertible notes
are treated as shares, adjustment is made
by adding back the depreciation on
buildings in 1961-62 and 1962-63, and
allowance is made for the apparently low
tax provision in 1961-62 and 1963-64,
per share earnings on the basis of a 10s.
share would have been as follows:
„ , (Shillings) Estimate
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
1.42 1.13 1.29 1.77
Even though the growth in earnings
<on the basis of an estimate only for
1964-63) seems to be of the order of
24 p.c., many would be quick to point
out that all the growth would have
occurred in the last year and, on the basis
of actual figures, earnings per share
declined by over 9 p.c. from 1961-62
to 1963-64. A rather more encouraging
picture appears when one looks at the
return on capital employed, which
presents this pattern:
v . I „„ (Percentages) Estimate
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
21.4 19.2 21.5 27.5
Personally, I believe that any stock
which has come through a difficult
period such as the 1961-1963 one with
its dividend well covered, which seems
to be managed with vigor and en-
thusiasm, and which now seems about
to show a marked increase in profits,
must be good buying at prices which
show a 5 p.c. yield from a dividend
covered at least li times.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
An “Interesting” Stock
High income from Webbing
Tl/f el bourne-based Elastic Webbing In-
dustries Ltd is Australia’s largest
producer of elastic and elastic fabrics. At
the company's annual meeting in Decem-
ber last year, the chairman, Mr H. Shee-
zel, told shareholders “it is not your
board’s practice to disclose actual sales
volume, but I can tell you that your
company ranks as a foremost producer
... on the world scene”.
The group was registered in Victoria
in June, 1948, and floated to the stock
exchange lists soon after. It is listed in
Melbourne and Perth. Today's activities
are conducted through four wholly-
owned subsidiaries. Three are based in
the home-State and the fourth in New
Zealand.
The two main offshoots are Elastic
Webbing (Aust.) Pty Ltd and Elastic
Webbing (NZ) Ltd. They make and
supply elastic and elasticised broadcloth
to the manufacturers of corsetry, under-
wear, general clothing, footwear and sur-
gical appliances. Rigid webbings are
turned out for use in motor bodies, slide
fasteners, the shoe trade and the manu-
facture of Venetian blinds.
The other offshoots are Plotex Yarns
(Aust.) Pty Ltd, distributor of covered
rubber thread for elasticised fabrics and
garments, and Amalgamated Fabrics Pty
Ltd.
In 1963-64 another product was added
to the already wide range. Permanently
moulded and shaped brassiere cups are
now made, mainly for use in women’s
swimsuits. The manufacturing plant has
been installed under a licence agreement
W'ith a US group. Its capacity is not
limited to the production of these subtle
items only. It can be utilised over a wide
field of fabric moulding.
The new product has proved a success
so far. With some amusement, we read
in the company's interim report for Dec-
ember half-year that the production of
the cups was being maintained at a high
level and directors felt that the new sec-
tion was now well established!
Another new development has been
the extension of EWl's interest in the
woven stretch fabric field. The move has
been made in the belief that a permanent
market is definitely being established for
these “comfort” stretch fabrics. Such is
already the case in the slacks and swim-
suit fields, and overseas trends show that
the product’s acceptance is extending to
a wide variety of woven materials
from car seat covers to men’s swimsuits
and shirts.
The recent interim report pointed out
that the group was generally improving
and increased profits can be expected for
the current year. Sales and profits were
both “higher” for the six months, al-
though the percentage increase in the
latter was not as great as that scored by
the former. The productivity of the NZ
subsidiary has been “increased consider-
ably”, but forward orders on hand alone
would ensure the selling of the extra
output. At home, narrow elastic had been
doing well and the forward order position
was “sound". However, there was still a
surplus production for certain items in
the wide woven and knitted elastics field,
due mainly to import competition.
The lack of tariff protection for these
has been a bone of contention with EWI
and the other companies in the industry
for some time. There appears to be a
very good case for protection. The Tariff
Board turned down an application last
year. As a result, Australian concerns are
taking steps to have the decision re-
viewed.
With profits now on the increase there
seems to be a chance of higher dividends
this year or in 1965-66, especially if the
Tariff Board decision is successfully re-
viewed. The current year’s interim was
steady at 3} p.c. Even without an in-
crease this year, the ss. shares still yield
very high, providing strong attraction to
the income-seeking investor. Current
prices are about 3s. 9d., which yields a
high 9 p. c. odd after brokerage and
stamp duty. The return would be a safe
one in the short-term at least, yet an eye
should be kept on economic trends, even
though a dividend was still paid after the
setback in 1961-62.
To be safe, capital gains should be
only considered as a side issue. But they
will definitely be made if the dividend
is restored. Even now there seems little
reason why the shares should not be
fetching at least par value. A rise from
3s. 9d. to ss. would represent a 33-} p.c.
capital gain. 22} p.c. after buying and
selling brokerage.
The accompanying table shows a fairly
healthy financial position, one of the best
for some time, in fact.. Current assets
show a steady growth while current lia-
bilities go down as often as they go up.
They were down last year, so working
capital was at a best ever level. Since
balance date, £lOO,OOO of it has been
used to repay an issue of unsecured notes.
These were part of the loan capital and
their elimination has subsequently re-
duced this item to a far happier level.
Fixed assets also show steady growth

after making allowance for the 1961-62
revaluation of buildings and plant and the
1963-64 devaluation of freehold. A fac-
tory was sold to pay off a mortgage
(hence the lower current liabilities) and
then leased back under what appears to
be a satisfactory arrangement so far.
Intangibles, representing goodwill on
consolidation, could do with writing down
when good times return. To give a more
accurate value of worth, directors deduct
these from shareholders’ funds in the
balance sheet rather than include them
on the asset side. The 1960-61 jump in
ordinary capital reflects the par issue and
the 1962-63 jump an option conversion.
Reserves are extraordinarily high, even
allowing for the year of revaluation and
last year's devaluation.
To sum up: high income returns in
the short term and the prospect of
capital gains plus high income return in
the long run. As the latter prospect is
somewhat indefinite, those who prefer
“interesting” stocks should be the only
buyers. A close eye must be kept on the
group each time it reports and on the
economic scene,- especially if no further
tariff protection is granted.

vendors retained slightly more than 50
p.c. of the £100,002 paid-up capital.
Within a few months of listing, the
company expanded its activities to
Queensland with the acquisition of Qurex
Pty Ltd, furniture manufacturer of
Rocklea. Purchase price was 42,000
ss. shares. Other takeovers followed in
quick succession, including 200,000
shares for Thompson and Wright Ltd,
sawmiller of Rabaul, and Brookvale
Plastics Pty Ltd, injection moulder of
light diffusers and plastic legs for furni-
ture and tool and die manufacturer.
Shareholders were not forgotten and
participated in a one-for-five bonus in
June, 1960, a one-for-two cash issue at
par a month later, and, in 1962, another
one-for-two at par all lifting paid-up
capital to the present £375,000.
The acquisition of the Rabaul saw-
milling business brought with it the need
to provide landing facilities in Sydney.
So the company bought a waterfront area
at Balmain from D. Hardy and Sons Ltd
containing timber handling equipment,
drying kilns and immunising plant. The
price was about £330,000.
From 1960 to 1962, profit showed a
gradual upward movement, although
earning rate was almost stationary on
rising capital. Profit in 1962 was
£36,437, equal to 14 p.c. on capital and
giving only a small coverage to the 12 V
p.c. dividend paid for the third successive
year.
However, the New Guinea timber
venture and the purchase of the land at
Balmain brought disaster in the follow-
ing year. Integration of the timber into
the group’s furniture factory at Botany
plus shipping and local handling dif-
ficulties resulted in a thumping loss of
£61,397. No dividend was paid. Much
of the loss was caused by the £40,000
interest charges on the Balmain property.
By the end of 1963. directors had
decided that conversion of this site to
furniture manufacture was too difficult.
They therefore resolved to sell it. At
the same time the plastics subsidiary,
acquired only 12 months previously, was
also closed.
The 1963-64 financial year saw an-
other, and larger, loss, £74,269, to which
the closing of the Brookvale plant con-
tributed £17,481. The Brisbane company
traded profitably (explaining the £664
tax provision). While the New Guinea
outlook was “favorable”, Sydney opera-
tions resulted in a heavy loss accentuated
by the drain of Balmain. Again no divi-
dend was paid.
In order to improve liquidity, a
majority interest in the New Guinea
timber venture was sold early this year,
reputedly to Japanese interests.
Business showed an improvement in
the first six months of the current year
and, in the period to December, the com-
pany showed a trading profit of £30,242.
Yet more than two-thirds of this was
absorbed by the continued drain of the
Balmain property, which in the six
months took £20,909.
Despite the improvement, the com-
pany still has a great distance to go to
get out of the mire. Directors are not
optimistic about the current half-year
being as profitable as the first half. At
last balance date accumulated losses
stood at £99,913.
The shares are currently selling around
25., having been as low as Is. 3d. earlier
this year. At this level they appear fuljy
priced until the Balmain property is
sold.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Cleaning Up a Register
The fate of five Coles' shares
QJome readers may remember my buy-
ing five G. J. Coles’ shares last year
before that company made its surprise
cash issue. The motive behind the pur-
chase was an expectation that directors
would take the opportunity of rounding
off all holdings to multiples of 10. Un-
fortunately, directors thought otherwise,
so I was left with a bare five shares.
These I disposed of in the clean-up last
year.
Now the company has written to all
holders of five shares with the alternative
offer of either selling their existing five
shares or buying five additional shares.
Close reading of the letter indicates a
certain anxiety on the part of directors
to completely tidy up the share register.
It seems to me that any shareholder
receiving such a letter might find that
in due course he will be the owner of
an additional five shares without cost,
if he simply takes no action now.
Doing nothing yet making a profit
would be very pleasant to take. Lor me,
however, it’s down to the grind of trying
to work out which shares should be
going up or down.
My first transaction this week was
based on the expectation of the latter
happening. Steamships Trading has just
announced a l-for-5 issue at 2s. 6d.
premium. Like so many other companies
wanting funds, Steamships is turning to
its shareholders.
The company has progressed very well
in the last few years, though in so doing
its capital has grown enormously. Only
a few months ago a large placement of
shares was 7 made. These days place-
ments often trigger off a fall in the share
price. Steamships Trading proved no
exception. To make a share issue now,
especially at a premium, must only
weaken the market further. On the day
after the announcement my broker
managed to sell 500 shares at an average
price of 11s. 4d.
More or less balancing this short trans-
action was the purchase of 400 Kathleen
Investments at 16s. 3d. The portfolio
seems to be swinging more and more
into the mining industry. This is not a
case of desperation, rather the realisa-
tion that many of the mining companies
have so much to offer.
Until 1963, Kathleen Investments had
received very substantial dividends from
its 35 p.c. share interest in Mary Kath-
leen Uranium and shareholders had
grown accustomed to getting a yearly
dividend of about ss. Those days are
over. The contract to supply uranium
to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority held by MKU ended in 1963.
Kathleen Investments has since turned
to other forms of mining, namely tin
and beach sands. Through a sub-
sidiary, Mineral Concentrates Pty Ltd,
a plan to mine 600 tons of tin at Mool-
yella in Western Australia is under way.
As for beach sands, a little less than a
50 p.c. interest is held in Rutile and
Zircon Mines (Newcastle) Ltd, the
remaining 50 p.c. being owned by Peko
Wallsend Investment Ltd. Rutile and
Zircon Mines holds a lucrative contract
to supply rutile to du Pont of America
for the next four years. Kathleen Invest-
ments is also a major producer of
ilmenite through its wholly-owned sub-
sidiary Cable Ltd.
In an effort to reduce the debit balance,
I sold off 500 Loloma Contributings at
12s. and so incurred a £26 loss. A few
pounds loss was also incurred on Trans-
oil, which was sold just before the call
was due. Making up for these losses
was the £36 profit on the A. V. Jennings.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN ON THE LAND
What is a “Simple Majority”?
More vagueness in wool reserve scheme
117'hat’s in a word?
** When Dr J. Melville, chairman of
the Australian Wool Industry Confer-
ence, announced that the referendum of
woolgrowers on reserve price marketing
would be decided by a “simple majority”,
what, exactly, did he mean? Most
people would assume that this would
mean that 51 per cent of votes would
decide the issue one way or the other.
Not so, say those woolgrowers who
have voiced opposition to the reserve
plan. This would be a “bare majority”,
they say, and a “bare majority” would
be unwarranted in such an important
referendum in the industry.
It will not pacify these opponents of
reserve price marketing, but Roget’s
Thesaurus does list the following as
synonyms mere, simple, sheer, stark,
bare. “Bare majority” is the phrase being
used and, regardless of what Roget’s says,
it means something different to “simple
majority” in the minds of the anti-re-
servists.
It might have been guessed that the
apparent air of complete co-operation at
the last Wool Industry Conference was
too good to be true. Indeed it’s very
difficult not to be cynical in assessing
the goings and comings of primary pro-
ducers.
At the annual conference of the
Queensland Graziers’ Association, soon
after the Wool Industry Conference, the
Minister for Trade, Mr McEwen, ap-
parently found himself on a spot over
this matter of “bare majority” or “simple
majority”. He had a bit each way, which
is understandable.
He gave tacit support for the idea of
a reserve price scheme, but when asked
about the “bare majority” interpretation
he said that what he did not want to see
was a repeat of the “1951 fiasco”.
Queensland Graziers’ is Sir William
Gunn territory and, unlike NSW Graz-
iers’, might be reasonably tipped to be
strongly in support of reserve price at
the ballot boxes. They were in 1951 and
were, in fact, the only State body of the
Graziers’ Association to vote in favor
of the 1951 equivalent of the current
reserve price proposal.
Mr McEwen, though, was not exag-
gerating—l9sl was a fiasco. In that year
the woolgrowers had to vote to decide
if the post Joint Organisation marketing
scheme (a carryover from the war-time
Joint Organisation acquisition scheme)
should continue. The woolgrowers of
Australia rejected it by a huge margin
- about 80 per cent were against it.
Back after the First World War there
was another referendum on another mar-
keting scheme (BAWRA) with important
similarities to the reserve price proposal.
There was no “bare majority” or “simple
majority” aspect of the BAWRA refer-
endum. To continue in operation it was
stipulated that 75 per cent of growers had
to be in favor. Seventy-four per cent
decided they were in favor. That was
not enough and BAWRA lapsed.
Presumably no one would dream these
days of seriously suggesting that a 75 per
cent majority should apply in any refer-
endum on anything. Yet this writer will
not be at all surprised if the hue and
cry for 60 or 65 per cent, or even 70,
is taken up strongly in the anti-reserve
price camp in the coming months.
After all, there is a precedent.
Those pro-reserve price woolgrowers
who have been clapping their hands in
glee because the Wool Industry Confer-
ence agreed in quick time to a ten-bale
minimum voting qualification may be
caught off guard. If “simple majority”
was cut and dried at 51 per cent, then
surely Mr McEwen would, not have
hedged at the Queensland Graziers’ con-
ference.
No one, and this includes the Wool
Board, the Federal Government, and the
Wool Industry Conference, has clearly


defined what “simple majority” means.
It is time they did.
Presumably it will be one of the mat-
ters discussed at the next sitting of the
Wool Industry Conference, which, as a
full body, has yet to determine its attitude
to the reserve price proposal even though
its executive has decided in favor. Per-
haps a body such as the Wool Industry
Conference must automatically endorse
an executive decision, though there can
be no guarantee about that
This is seen by F. Eric Hitchens, pro-
bably the only man alive who has taken
an active part in the BAWRA, Post JO,
and current reserve price campaigns, in
a rather sinister light. A plan which
should be simple has been “needlessly
complicated”, says Hitchins, and there
would be many who would agree with
him.
Already the “three per cent” clause
is proving another stumbling block to
the supporters of reserve price. The
Wool Board, the Wool Industry Con-
ference and the Government, who should
be able to provide exact figures on this,
are not doing so. It has been left to in-
dividual woolgrowers to try to work out
just how much reserve price will cost
them.
Including the amounts for promotion
and research, the total (and that is what
counts) comes, in most case?, to be-
tween 4k and 4J per cent. This is
getting dangerously close to the five per
cent which this writer believes is the
point of no return.
And this is not a guess, but is based
on a decision of the Australian Wool and
Meat Producers’ Federation (a strongly
pro-reserve price body) nearly two years
ago. At that time this body (which con-
stitutes 50 per cent of the Wool Industry
Conference) declared that its members
would be prepared to pay five per cent
of their wool returns to finance a reserve
price scheme alone. At that time the pro-
motion levy was a quarter of what it is
now and wool prices were higher.
Taking into account the huge increase
in the promotion levy, and the fall in
wool prices, five per cent seems to be the
figure to work on.
As might be expected, certain anti-
reserve price spokesmen are making
much of the “three per cent"" clause. So
they should. Money is always important.
Woolgrowers should be in no doubt
whatsoever about how much reserve price
might cost them when they go to the
ballot boxes. Nor should they be in any
doubt about the majority necessary to
implement the proposal.
The important thing to bear in mind
here is that the Government would have
the final say on the majority question.
If the Government would not be satis-
fied with 51 per cent then someone should
say so pretty quickly.
If the reserve price business drags on
much longer, with new traps being set
at every turn, then both the Wool Board
and the Government may be sure that
they will be accused of plausible roguery.
Not that that in itself would matter so
much except that it could just about
destroy some well-earned reputations.
Wheat Sales to Red China
Could Vietnam action halt the flow?
another “South Irian” type
1 quote (possibly) going the rounds.
Sir Raphael Cilento, tropical diseases
expert, graduate of law and medicine,
and booster for northern development,
reports that Mao Tse-tung says that Aus-
tralia is “that great south land the
heritage of the Asian people”.
He made this point (Sir Raphael, that
is) at a conference of dairy factory
managers in Victoria recently. He did
not say when Mao said what he is
supposed to have said.
But let us suppose Mao is itching to
send his hordes to take over the great
south land. It would follow, would it
not, that Australia’s decision to send
troops to Vietnam is a “hostile act”.
We may soon know more about that.
The Red Chinese, as everyone knows,
have bought Australian wheat in large
quantities for six or seven years and
have paid on the dot every time. This
has confounded and confused those
observers who believe that by trading
with Red China we are getting ourselves
into a devilish predicament.
From this year’s crop China has
ordered 45 million bushels, worth about
£3O million. This was negotiated in
Hong Kong months ago.
The interesting part of the deal, in
the light of Vietnam, is that none of it
has actually left Australia yet. Under
the agreement it is due to start going
in June —in a few weeks’ time. The
Chinese could, if they wanted to, back
out, just not take it, and not pay for it
either. It is on terms, remember (the
Russians pay cash).
Quite an interesting situation and, con-
sidering Vietnam, a dicey one.
Instead of looking on the dismal side
of things, however, it does appear that
in both wheat and meat we can’t really
go wrong. The Minister for Trade, Mr
McEwen, is very hopeful that the forth-
coming talks in Geneva on new world
trading arrangements for cereals will
result in an effective floor price for
wheat: “A satisfactory world wheat
agreement must ensure a better and
more sensible price situation and should
assure efficient producers a remunerative
return.”
The Commonwealth Economic Com-
mittee in London, reviewing the meat
situation, predicts that the world short-
age will continue through the remainder
of 1965. Beyond that, it sees no reason
for lessening demand for red meat. This
should provide exporting countries with
markets for a long way ahead.
They Were Musters They Were!
An old stockman reminisces
By TOM RONAN
fFms has nothing to do with stocks and
A shares. The matter under discus-
sion is stock and scares. Association
with the former can easily inspire the
latter, particularly, for example, if you
stand up out of the dust alongside a
broncho branding panel and find that
there is twelve hundred pounds live
weight of old scrub bull breathing down
the back of your neck.
Until recent years, scrub bulls caused
more broken limbs and hearts, and
killed more good horses and fond hopes,
than any other element in the Top End
cattle country. They were hard to
muster. I’d say that on places such as
Auvergne and Victoria River Downs not
one bull of every ten actually started
up by the stock camp ever reached
the branding yard. Those which got
that far smashed so many gate bars and
rails in the stock yards, or broke so
many ropes and overstrained so many
catching horses in the bronco yards,
that by the time they were eventually
branded, castrated and dehorned they
represented quite a considerable outlay
in time and money per head.
The usual value placed on these scrub-
bers was that of the character who
instructed me to shoot them wherever
I saw them. “Try to make one shot do
one bull,” was his final injunction. “This
high power ammunition costs money.”
Trap yards and paddocks simplified
the original mustering of bulls. The
first of these I had anything to do with
was a paddock which Reg Durack had

built at Ring Lagoon on the Baines. It
was a perfect set-up —a horseshoe-
shaped bend in the river with an over-
flow billabong almost full width across
its mouth. Only the extremity of panic
would make cattle take on the boggy,
slimy river bank leading down to the
salt water. By fencing from high bank
to high bank and enclosing the lagoon
there was feed and water for a fair num-
ber of stock so long as they were not
left there too long.
There were four hundred head of
bush cattle in the trap when we landed
there, with about three hundred reason-
ably steady coachers. We spent three
days mustering coachers and bush cattle,
which included about a hundred and
fifty bulls, along the fence of the trap
and then driving them round and round
the bends of the river. On the fourth
morning we gave them a good drink of
water and let them out. For two miles
they ambled along like milking cows.
Then they sighted ahead of them the belt
of ti-tree scrub in which they and their
progenitors for the previous forty years
had found freedom. There were twelve
men mounted and some of the Auvergne
blackfellows were first-class wild cattle
stockmen. Those old ragers, however,
went through us like a football crowd
through a broken picket fence. At the
finish we had lost all our fresh cattle
and even some of our supposedly quiet
coachers, which reverted to type and
went with the others.
These days there is a totally new look
on this aspect of the cattle game. Trap
yards and paddocks are being built
everywhere. Not even the rawest
jackeroo need incur the ignominy I
earned from my Ring Lagoon fiasco.
If the trap is strong enough and the
roads are passable, the modern method
is to flash a radio message to Katherine.
The road trains come along and the bulls
are loaded up a ramp into the trucks.
They are unshipped in the meatworks
yard and stay there until pushed up the
race on to the killing floor. Their first
taste of freedom is when they are con-
veyed out of the freezer in the form of
cartons of boneless beef destined for the
overseas market.

Omega Constellation. Requires no winding. Can be worn while swimming or golfing. The calendar feature is invaluable when dating letters and cheques.
As Illustrated. * In JBct. gold with IBct. gold bracelet, £.360.
Few men are destined to receive the new Constellation
-the finest Chronometer Omega has ever made
Gravity-powered rotor winds the Constellation as you wear it. Pre-tested for 360 hours, in 5 wrist-positions,
the Constellation Chronometer is Omega’s finest watch . . . built for a lifetime of proud possession.
They make it with love. Ask Omega
craftsmen about the Constellation and
they will talk like proud parents.
Because thev have an inborn love of
fine craftsmanship.
They gift it with accuracy. Skill and ex-
perience tell them that an error of no
more than one-ninth the diameter of a
hair can seriously affect accuracy and
durability. Therefore they work
and think in thousandths of mil-
limeters.
They endow it with long life. They know
that friction is the deadly enemy of
longevity. That high-speed metal-to-
metal contact can produce wear. That
one tiny particle of dust is dangerous
to a watch mechanism. Therefore they
polish the moving parts until they
gleam like mirrors. Furnish the watch
with jewelled bearings. “Scrub” the'
components ultrasonically and chem-
ically, 1215 times in all. Work in
spotless, hygienic surroundings.
They put it to the test. Each Constell-
ation must prove its accuracy during
360 hours in a Swiss Institute for
Official Chronometer Tests; it must
also receive a certificate endorsed
“Especially Good Results.” This is the
highest accuracy rating the Institute
can confer.
They place it in trustworthy hands. You
won’t find an Omega Constellation in
every jeweller’s shop. Its sale has been
entrusted only to jewellers who thor-
oughly understand and love watches.
The Omega jeweller is inspired by the
same pride and enthusiasm as the
Omega craftsman. That is why he
consistently recommends. — and sells
the Constellation.
They give it full after-care. There are
fully-equipped Omega Services Centres
in 156 countries. Wherever you go
they are within easy reach. Each
Centre is headed by a technician who is
Omega trained. The Omega one-vear
International Guarantee is honoured
everywhere.
They remember it forever. Your Con-
stellation is linked to Omega craftsmen
by the number engraved on the move-
ment. They have lavished care on your
watch. They know that its accurate
heart will beat stoutly and surely. On
and on and on . . .
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.
*For enhanced beauty and legibility , the
hour-markers are inlaid with onyx.
