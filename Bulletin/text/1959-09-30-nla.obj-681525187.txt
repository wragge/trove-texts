TRIBAL ANCESTORS
There seems to be a feeling among
publishers and collectors that when
Robert D. Fitz Gerald writes a sizeable
poem it had better be put into book-
form straight away instead of waiting
for the publication that is bound to
come later in a collection of his verse.
Thus the Mountainside Press in Vic-
toria a year or two ago published his
“Heemskerck Shoals” in an enormous
de luxe edition; and now, going to the
other extreme in an excessively plain
little paper-covered book, Walter
Stone’s Talkarra Press (Cremorne,
N. S. Wales) has published The Wind
at your Door just a few months after
it was first printed in “The Bulletin.”
Publication like this presumably
implies two things: that the poem will
stand re-reading, and that it is going
to last. And if that is what Walter
Stone had in mind about “The Wind
at your Door,” I think he was right
enough. In fact, I think that this is
the kind of poem Fitz Gerald does best;
and when he does it he writes with a
maturity of mind, a certitude of style
and a firmness of construction which no
other poet now writing in Australia
can rival.
Fitz Gerald has, in fact, only once
before rivalled this particular kind of
poem himself, and that is in “Fifth
Day.” His masterpiece, taking the total
of good writing and the magnitude of
conception, is probably the Tongan
epic, “Between Two Tides”; but, fine
achievement though it is, that poem
has some of the weaknesses hardly to
be avoided in a very long work.
“Heemskerck Shoals” is very nearly
of his highest quality, but lacks color,
and, in some of the thoughts attributed
to Tasman, is not entirely “in keep-
ing.”
But in “Fifth Day” and “The Wind
at your Door” not a word goes wrong,
not a line falters, nothing extraneous
mars the clear development of the
theme, the complex but straight-
forward movement. In both poems,
though the thought is deep, the mean-
ing is crystal-clear; in both poems the
richness of setting and the play of
human passions imbue the verse with
a color which his recent shorter poems
sometimes lack.
It seems to me likely enough that,
out of what he has so far written, “The
Wind at your Door” may well be
chosen as Fitz Gerald’s representative
poem; the piece that displays all his
qualities at their highest. The only
reason for preferring it to “Fifth Day”
(which I think makes slightly the more
pleasant reading, the action not being
so harsh) would be that the theme is
Australian; but that is a fact which,
however reprehensibly, will always
weigh with anthologists at least; and
also, no doubt, with readers . . . both
here and overseas. It is important here,
it is interesting overseas, to have a
poem telling us something about Aus-
tralia.
And “The Wind at your Door” is
not only representative of Fitz Gerald;
it is extraordinarily representative of
Australia. It deals, in fact, with the
fundamental Australian legend—the
convicts. And the attraction —I could
almost say the astuteness —of it is that
Fitz Gerald does not claim merely the
convicts as our tribal ancestors, as so
many shallower writers have done, but
also those who flogged them —or those
who attended or endorsed the flog-
gings; by implication, the whole
pioneer society. It is a view which
few would question; and it is obvi-
ously right.
Here, he says first, is Martin Mason,
one of his own ancestors, a doctor
who attended a flogging:—
Let him then be much of the middle
style
of height and coloring ; let his hair
be dark
and his eyes green ; and for that slit,
the smile
that seemed inhuman, have it cruel
and stark,
but grant it could be too the ironic
mark
of all caught in the system —who
the most,
the doctor or the flesh twined round
that post?
And next, here is one Maurice Fitz-
Gerald, a convict to be flogged for his
part in the Castle Hill rebellion, not
literally an ancestor but symbolically
claimed as one:—
could I announce
that Maurice as my kin I say aloud
I’d take his irons as heraldry, and
be proud.
The doctor stands for brutality, but
also for the pioneering spirit and, for
his work among the Hawkesbury
settlers, humanity. The convict stands
for his own brutality but also for
courage and independence. Both, as
a warning for the future, are caught in
“the system”; and the jailyard where
the flogging is done
widens and takes in
my country. Fifty paces of stamped
earth
stretch; and grey walls retreat and
grow so thin
that towns show through and clear-
ings—new raw birth
which burst from handcuffs —and
free hands go forth
to win tomorrow’s harvest from a
vast
ploughland—the fifty paces of that
past.
Whichever way you look at it—as
a piece of verse-craft and construction,
as a narrative, as an image of the
Australian tradition or as a humane
reflection on human nature—it seems
to me wholly admirable. The booklet
is printed in an edition of 275 copies,
each signed by the publisher and the
author.

A Novel of Fiji
Wreck on coral reef. Local canni-
bals mistake white crew for gods.
Love-affair between first-mate and
cannibal maiden. Captain goes queer.
Mutinous third-mate. Natives catch
dysentery from whites and turn nasty.
Slaughter. First-mate, cannibal maiden

Not many writers of adventure-
stories with any claim to literary adult-
hood would be game enough these
days to tell that one again. But in
Long Pig (Heinemann), Melbourne
author Russell Foreman has been game
enough—and he very entertainingly
gets away with it.
He is helped by having some histori-
cal rock to build on. The wreck he
writes of actually did happen to an
American ship in the Fiji islands at
the beginning of the 19th century, and,
according to the introductory note,
“her crew were the first white men to
remain for any length of time in these
lovely islands, and one of them dis-
covered sandalwood —an accident that
led to what was, perhaps, the bloodiest
decade in South Sea history.” Little
is known of what happened to these
whites; but since, as has been said
before, reality and romance are never
far apart in the South Seas, it is likely
enough that they, like so many others,
became the subjects of an old, old
story. At any rate, Foreman pretty
well convinces us that they did.
He convinces because he plainly
knows what —or, rather, where—he is
writing about. The dustjacket says that
“he has lived for some years in the
Fiji Islands” and “has done intensive
research on ancient Pacific religious
concepts and cultural patterns.” He
has thus been able to make his time-
eroded tale stand up by casing it thickly
with concrete detail; demonstrating
once again that a reader will go a
long way with a writer who keeps the
weather real, and all the sights, sounds
and smells actual, and blinds him now
and then with a blaze of authentic local
color.
Foreman’s local color is very effec-
tive indeed, perhaps because he is

SENATE REVIVAL
VI/HEN (and if ) the Federal Parlia-
™ ment and the States come to deal
with the report of the Joint Commit-
tee on Constitutional Review presented
at the end of the last Federal session
of 1958, the Senate almost certainly
will*come in for the lion’s share of
attention.
Its proceedings, however, are likely
to earn for it a different kind of con-
sideration from that which it would
have received three or four years ago,
or even at the end of the last Parlia-
ment. For the Senate has shown signs
of coming out of the wilderness of
banal mediocrity into which it had
fallen as a result of its subservience to
the will of caucuses whose majorities
are in the lower House.
The report of the Joint Committee
points-out that evolution of political
parties has upset the speculations of
many of the founders of the Constitu-
tion as to how the Senate would func-
tion. and puts emphasis on the fact
that “the Senate for many years has
been as susceptible to party-political
influences as the House of Representa-
tives” —which, of course, it was never
intended to be by the idealists who
devised it. Proceedings in the Senate,
the report said, usually find party
divisions corresponding to those in the
lower House: —
The history of deadlocks between the
two Houses is, for example, one of
conflicting policies of national parties.
The loyalty of Senators to their parties
has been largely responsible for the
sublimation of the original dual concep-
tion of the Senate as a States House and
a House of review.
In the earlier part of Federal Par-
liamentary history the tendency was
for men of ability with fine State
Parliamentary records and intensive
knowledge of State politics to enter
the Senate. But in the twilight stage
between the end of World War I and
the end of World War II this tendency
disappeared, and Senate seats seemed
to be largely reserved, on the one
hand for discarded union secretaries
seeking a pension and, on the other,
chairmen of political party-organisa-
tions without previous Parliamentary
experience or knowledge of State
government and tradition and rights
of the States whose interests, they were
intended to safeguard and represent.
There came a period in which it was
the custom to appoint from the Senate
those Ministers whose departments
'afforded—ostensibly—little scope for
ability or contention on major policy
—such as the Postmaster-General, or
the Attorney-General, or the Minister
for Repatriation.
In this period it would have been
unthinkable that men of the calibre of
Senator Massey Greene, or George
Foster Pearce, or orators like Edward
Davis Millen —one of the ablest of
the forgotten men of earlier Senate
history —would have been ready to
grace the Senate’s gloomy halls.
The Senate, in fact, became, or was
intended to become, an echo of the
House of Representatives and the
Government, but the differences be-
tween the method and time of elections
made it inevitable that its membership
should always be an anachronism and
that its majority should represent, as
often as not, the public opinion of three
years ago rather than the opinion of
today.
This circumstance made it a nuisance
to Governments, a source of deadlocks
and double-dissolutions and the
mother of a considerable makeshift
change in the Constitution to get over
the inconveniences resulting from its
delayed action. It also brought about
a growing unpopularity of the Senate
among ambitious men, which has not
been cured by proportional-representa-
tion.
TN any case, a Chamber, members of
■*- which have no hope on earth of
becoming Prime Minister, and very
little indeed of becoming External
Affairs Minister, or Treasurer, or
Minister for Trade, can have little
attraction for would-be political
giants in their early stages of growth.
There are, and have been. Ministers
of very high ability in the Senate
in recent years. Senator Spooner,
Minister for National Development, is
a case in point. Even Labor members
have paid tribute to his work in stabi-
lising the coal-industry, and he has
shown a constructive and forward-
looking capacity in dealing with the
vast projects such as the Snowy Moun-
tains scheme and in kinds of planning
which are possibly better done in the
upper House than in the lower. Senator
McKenna was equally a man of great
capacity who might easily now be
leader of the Labor party if he were
in the lower House, to which,
apparently, at one stage there was
some thought of trying to transfer him.
The Senate, however, till recently
has exhibited a rather pathetic
atmosphere of hopelessness, and the
only kind of reform which the Joint
Committee seems to have been able to
suggest is that which throws more
power into the hands of the House of
Representatives by speeding-up the
machinery for solving deadlocks
between the two Houses and making
it easier to avoid a double-dissolution
■—when agreement becomes impossible
—by convening joint sittings of the
two legislatures, in which, with the
proportional-representation system of
election of Senators still in vogue, the
lower House would have its way in
nine cases out of ten.
nrHE Senate, however, seems to be
finding its own solution for its
moribundity at the moment by an unex-
pected reversion to the principles on
which it was originally designed. The
series of committees such as that on
road-accidents now functioning can do
very useful work if they can be put
on a non-party basis, but the greatest
hope of its rejuvenation seems to lie
in the fact that it has somehow
acquired a new quota of ability in the
last two or three elections and a new
originality of outlook.
It has no Menzies to set its standards
of oratory, but its debates are far
superior to those of the House of
Representatives, which have been
reduced, in the main, to dreary Minis-
terial expositions followed by deplor-
able exhibitions of backbiting and
spleen.
The Senate debate, on the motion of
Senator Wright, launched on Septem-
ber 15, on the Tariff Board’s recom-
mendations about protection for the
oil-refining industry, was informative,
useful and marked by a give-and-take
on both sides of the House which was
as commendable as it was novel. It
would have been an admirable debate
in any legislature, with each side in
politics ready to see the view of the
other and the approach constructive
instead of heatedly party-political.
In winding it up Senator Henty,
Minister for Customs, remarked that
“the more the Senate devotes itself to
debates of this kind the more interest-
ing our work will become and the
better informed we will become on
every aspect of public life in Australia
with a better-balanced picture of
the growing industrial life of Aus-
tralia.”
In such debates, and in committee-
work, the Senate could undoubtedly
make for itself a role which would
induce men of special national qualifi-
cations to see a career for themselves
in Federal Parliament without aspiring
to suffer the rigors of Ministerial
office.


NO SAYVEE!
“Say, Mao, it was a real swell trip, but they sure near loused-up the programme when they wouldn’t let me
go see Donald Duck.”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Sunshine and Limelight
Publicity given last week to Federal
Parliamentarians who had been chasing
the sunshine at Surfers’ Paradise, Christ-
mas Island and Singapore but had caught
the limelight instead, recalled some of the
comments made by the Committee of
Inquiry into Parliamentary salaries in
their report early this year. Remarking
that Australian electors make exacting
demands upon their Parliamentary repre-
sentatives, the report said:
When a member is not in Canberra, it
is expected that he shall be available in
his electorate, by day, by night, and at
weekends, to receive and deal with requests
about housing, telephones, old-age and
invalid pensions, the maternity bonus,
repatriation, sales-tax, posts and telegraphs,
jobs, tariffs and import-licences, immigra-
tion, income-tax, the leave, pay and
conditions of servicemen, and innumerable
other matters.
Senator Aylett has been criticised for
his reported intention of taking-up per-
manent residence on the Gold Coast,
1500 miles away from his home-town,
Launceston, and the State which he
represents in the Senate. The Senator was
to have made a statement on this sub-
ject last Thursday, but after a chat with
his party-leaders, he stayed mum.
This was a pity. He could have
explained, for example, that as so many
Tasmanians were visiting the Gold Coast
it was almost imperative that one of
Tasmania’s 10 Senators should be avail-
able for consultation there, to deal with
housing, pensions and other problems.
(This would also explain the alleged
real-estate link.) He could also have
pointed-out that since so many of his
inquiries in Launceston came by phone,
he could take them just as effectively at
Surfers’ Paradise, and that the P.M.G.’s
trunk-line revenue would benefit from
the change.
It is a pity, too, that a more complete
statement has not been made on the
Christmas Island story. All that is known
is that some members were granted free
air-travel to Christmas Island via Singa-
pore (instead of the cheaper boat-trip
direct from Fremantle), but didn’t com-
plete the journey, simply making a round-
trip to Singapore out of it. On the face
of it, this looked like using the Parlia-
mentary privilege of a trip to “an Aus-
tralian territory” to score a buckshee
holiday in Singapore, which is not an
Australian territory.
However, it could well be, as in the
case of the Gold Coast report, that the
members concerned were really acting in
the interests of the taxpayers. The
Richardson report recommends that
members should travel extensively “within
Australia and to the Territories to
acquire a first-hand knowledge of
developmental and other problems.”
Distance adds enchantment to the
view, and a full investigation might show
that a shrewd observer (such as Mr. Dan
Curtin, who noticed that the Australian
office in Singapore was not flying a flag)
could find out more about Christmas
Island in Singapore than on the island
itself, where, perhaps, he would’t be able
to see the wood for the coconut-palms.
Khrushchev's White Elephant
The policy of “Leave it to Ike” seems
to actuate the United Nations in dealing
with Khrushchev’s visionary plan (or,
rather, plans) for the disarmament of
the world.
There was no rush or eagerness to
take him at his word before he repented.
Press reaction in the English-speaking
world is only less dubious than that of
the European Continental world which
feels the direct weight of Communist
pressure.
There seems little doubt from a
careful study of Khrushchev’s speeches
and statements before he went to the
United States that what he said in
Europe before leaving and what he pro-
posed in the U.N7 rostrum were two
parts of a whole.
First, in Europe, he laid down those
points on which Russia would not give
way, to be read as conditions precedent
to any agreement for world-disarma-
ment. Had these been uttered as pro-
posed covenants to be included in his
plan submitted in New York they
would have doomed any chance of
further discussion. So these were con-
veniently forgotten when he made his
statement with expansive generosity.
His offer sounds like a repetition of
the story of the kindly rajah who pre-
sented one of his sweepers with a large
and hungry white elephant without
advising him of the cost of keeping
large white elephants which do not
work.
It seems almost certain that when
the Western nations realise the cost of
keeping Khrushchev’s white and saintly-
looking pachyderm some of the optimism
and gratitude may disappear.
The essential conditions in the bargain
are likely to be the acceptance of the
status quo in Eastern Europe, with all
the captive nations and Berlin per-
manently within the Communist bloc
and with guarantees that there will be
no rebellion in them.
The idea may further be to render
France powerless to control Algeria and
with no guafantees about steady Com-
munist subversion of the countries round
the Iron Curtain border, v
It is unthinkable that all these arrange-
ments, and some more, will not be
insisted on, and it might be, in any case,
that China will not disarm—which would
present the West with a pretty problem.
At the same time, it is vital now that
the whole matter should be brought to
a discussion as early as possible and that
Khrushchev should be faced with a
clear-cut issue. Also, that the Western
nations should be able to state in a
way the man in the street can under-
stand exactly how much the West feels
it safe to yield, and how much it expects
Russia to yield, apart from necessary
guarantees, before disarmament can be
brought about.
In other words, delegates should go
to the Summit Conference in the same
attitude as Khrushchev himself will —■
prepared to talk turkey and able to talk
tough if necessary.
Adelaide Arts Festival
For the two weeks between March 12
and 26 next year Adelaide will put on
its brightest lights, flags and flowers;
draw to itself hundreds of Australian
singers, actors, musicians, writers and
painters; top the lot off with some
international celebrities in the arts and
see if it can produce a festival something
like the annual affair at Edinburgh, but
with an added, distinctly local, flavor.
As a glance at the already-projected
programme shows, it will be the first
festival of its kind and scope to be held
in Australia.
Visiting concert-artists include Italian
violinist Giaconda de Vito, Canadian
soprano Lois Marshall, youthful French
pianist Philippe Entremont and the
Janacek String Quartet from Prague.
Robert Speaight, English actor, producer
and author (his readings of T. S. Eliot
are well known to aficionados of
recorded verse), will play Thomas a
Becket in “Murder in the Cathedral” —
the play to be produced by homecoming
Robert Helpmann, who will also dance
the lead in Stravinsky’s ballet-mime “A
Soldier’s Tale.” Sir Donald Wolfit,
eminent English Shakspearian actor-
manager, will take part in “dramatic
recitals.”
A new Australian play, yet to be
chosen, will be given its first perform-
ance. The Hogarth Puppets from Eng-
land will entertain children of all ages
Adelaide’s symphony orchestra will be
joined by those of Sydney and Melbourne
for special concerts, and the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust’s opera-company will be
joined by Joan Hammond and Kenneth
Neate for performances of “Salome,”
“R.igoletto” and Puccini’s little-known
group of three one-act operas “The
Trittico.”
As well as long-hair recitals by well-
known local musicians, there are to be
some crew-cut efforts by visiting jazz-
men from England and the U.S., and a
-Strong leavening of art-exhibitions, dis-
cussion-groups, conferences, folk-dancing
displays and “a big Australian-type
carnival... . that will probably include
athletics, equestrian events, boomerang-
throwing and a spectacular corroboree by
tribal aborigines.”
The opening ceremony in Elder Park
on the night of March 12 is planned to
feature aquatic events, a symphony-
concert, an illuminated procession of
river-craft, water-skiing by searchlight,
fireworks and open-air dancing on the
banks of the Torrens.
The layers of these spectacular,
ambitious and wholly admirable plans
come, most of them, from the profes-
sions, the arts and business in Adelaide.
They have been strongly supported by
the A.8.C., the Australian Elizabethan
Theatre Trust, the S.A. Government and
the Adelaide City Council. Festival


president is Lord Mayor L. M. S. Har-
grave ; artistic-director Professor John
Bishop, of the Elder Conservatorium;

organiser of several Edinburgh Festivals.
Shrinkproof Wool
Another advance in the marketing of
wool, although hardly comparable with
the drip-dry process, has made the Mel-
bourne knitters, Crestknit Industries,
Ltd., cockahoop. They have developed
what is claimed to be a totally shrink-
proof process for woollen sweaters and
pullovers washed in washing-machines.
About two years ago Crestknit was
using, based on raw-wool weight, more
than a million pounds of wool a year,
but because of the demand by women
for synthetic garments which were more
machine-washable the company’s usage
of wool dropped by over 40 per cent.
Dr. J. A. Dixie, director of the Aus-
tralian Wool Testing Authority, has
pronounced the process totally shrink-
proof. It was developed in close co-
operation with Felt and Textiles of
Australia, Ltd., and a demonstration
was given for the trade, the Victorian
Minister for Development, A. J. Fraser,
and the chairman of the Australian Wool
Bureau.
Treated and untreated first-quality
garments were washed in a washing-
machine for 30 minutes at fast speed,
although the normal time recommended
for washing-machine manufacturers for
wool is four minutes at slow speed, and
at the end of the experiment the shrink-
proof garments were exactly the same
size and shape, and the untreated ones
had shrunk about six inches.
According to Crestknit’s researches,
the scales of wool-fibre adhere together
similarly to a ratchet when an untreated
woollen garment is washed, causing,
eventually felting, shrinking and hard-
ness.
Wine Festival
Australia’s first wine festival, for the
instruction and entertainment of up to
20,000 citizens, will be a new feature
of Wine Week, which is being held in
Victoria this year.
The festival will open at 11 a.m. on
the Monday of Wine Week —October
12—and will continue through four or
five sessions a day until the next Thurs-
day night; “sessions” is used in its Par-
liamentary sense to denote a space of
time and not in its undignified, un-
parliamentary sense.
The industry is turning it on, but not
using that common expression. There
will be a series of daily wine-tastings
between 10.30 a.m. and 9.30 p.m. at
the spacious Royale Ballroom, where
citizens will be admitted free on invita-
tions issued on their' application to
•wine-retailers, and the evenings will be
devoted to special groups such as wine-
and-food clubs, interested Government
departments, officers’ messes, the
C.5.1.R.0., diplomats, the University
staff and similar bodies not adequately
initiated in Australian wines.
The wine industry’s public-relations
endeavors have improved considerably
in recent years, but the protagonists
of Australian, wines are now aware that
while advertising and publicity are im-
portant in merchandising, giving the
new customer a taste of the product is
also vital.
The tastings will be given with the
guidance of experts who can describe
the wine, classify it and invite the tasters
to look for qualities which become more
appreciated upon longer acquaintance.
"AH Baba" Passes
[By “Ek Dum”]
To Sir Leslie Morshead, citizen soldier,
war was an unavoidable incidental in the
life of a citizen. He had all the virtues
of old-time knighthood, a simple and
dedicated sense of duty, courage and,
above all, a quiet modesty that left him
underrated with many a civilian associate
who had never seen him in action.
He was always insistent on what he
called his “amateur status” as a soldier,
but there were few of the regulars who
would not have been overwhelmingly
proud to have had his record.
Beginning life as a schoolmaster in
Victoria, he found himself at 26, with
Gallipoli behind him, commanding the
33rd Battalion in France. A captain at
the beginning of the war, he came out
at the end of it with a fine regimental
command record.
In World War 11, having kept up his
military connections meanwhile, one of
a little band who braved the almost
crushing discouragements of the inter-
vening period, he went, after com-
manding the Fifth Infantry Brigade, to
the command of the 18 th Infantry
Brigade, A.1.F., in Australia, England
and the Middle East, to that of the
newly-formed and quite raw Ninth
Division in February, 1941. Only a
few months later he and his command
were figuring in the chronicles of Lord
Haw Haw in Berlin (after proving to
be one of the toughest fighting-machines
Rommel had so far encountered in
North Africa) as “Ali Baba and His
20,000 Thieves,” the sole obstacle to the
advance of the Afrika Korps and its
accretions on Egypt.
There, aggressors rather than defenders,
he and his Rats held out for 242 days,
never giving the enveloping divisions' a
moment’s respite from the threat of
sallies out of the dilapidated and bomb-
struck rubbish-dump known as Tobruk.
And there they would have stayed till
the end of time, if they had not been
called out. /
That earned him a K.B.E. and both
he and the Division an honored place
in the battle of El Alamein.
From Tobruk via Alamein to the
Huon Peninsula and the New Guinea
campaign was a far cry; but these latter
battles, fought in the wildest of country
known, from the hills of Sattelberg and
beyond to the moss forests below
Salamaua, were enterprises unique in
large-scale war with modern weapons.
These were the battles of his 2nd
Australian Corps, which he took-
over after he had been rewarded
for Alamein with a K.C.B.—the Sixth,
Seventh and Ninth Divisions. No force
not as seasoned and as well-blooded
could have survived the ordeal of the
campaigns which really broke the
Japanese hold on the approaches to
Australia.
At the end of the war nobody returned
more quietly and unobtrusively to civil
affairs. Towards the end of his life,
beset by the physical aftermaths of four
years in one of the toughest and most
various commands, he made light
of his burdens and, always cheerful, was
a figure scarcely noticed in the Sydney
streets, so lightly did his fine record sit
upon him.
The present, in fact, is rather prone to
underestimate him. His true position will
be assessed only when (as he said to
the writer one day chatting quietly at
a street-corner about the late Sir William
Glasgow) “the historians get at him.” '
Budget Blues
[From Canberra]
If the Treasurer, Harold Holt, was
hoping that his first Budget would
strengthen his position in the Govern-
ment ranks in the leadership stakes he
must be sorely disappointed.
Not for many years has a Budget
had such a stormy passage through nor-
mally calm waters. It provoked an out-
cry over postal charges as fierce as any
except, perhaps, that occasioned by the
last Richardson report. Amendment of
some of the charges followed.
Last week the Government faced a
threat of rebellion from a number of
its own supporters, led by the Govern-
ment Members’ Social Services Com-
mittee.
This committee, with the support of
several back-bench members, sought a
liberalisation of the means-test to pro-
vide for a reduction of £1 a year in the
pension for every £2O of capital in
excess of £2OO, instead of the present
rate of £1 for every £lO in excess.
After a day of intense lobbying on
Thursday, Mr. Menzies promised a com-
plete review of the means-test before
the next Budget.
One of the leaders of the revolt, Bill
Wentworth, of Sydney, who spoke after
the P.M. in the debate in the Reps.,
said it was nonsense for Mr. Menzies
to talk about a vote for the Opposition
amendment endangering the Govern-
ment, and when the vote was taken he
crossed the floor of the House and voted
with the Opposition.
Chairman of the Social Services Com-
mittee Keith Wilson, of S.A., and Percy
Joske, of Victoria, both walked out of
the Chamber, refusing to record a vote
against the amendment.
The other half-dozen would-be
defecters, apparently satisfied by the
promise of a complete review of the
means-test, voted with the Government,
giving it a 56-39 win.

A delaide is the garden-city of
roses, olives, almonds, vines and
citrus, but except for the vines there is
little harvesting. Almonds and walnuts
ripen on the trees ungathered, apparently
grown for the blossom- or tree-value
only. Just now children are picking wild
olives; boys or girls climb the trees
and strip the branches into bags, or
thresh them off onto ground - sheets.
They select the red or black olives,
omitting the white or green, as this
variety yields less oil, but some are
bottled and sold in pubs cheaply. Pen-
sioners join in this easy-money activity,
and women appear to do most of the
climbing.—“Phin.”

THE AGE OF MARRIAGE
“The Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick,
has now made it clear that the Federal Govern-
ment’s new uniform laws of marriage will be
based on a ‘marriageable age.’ ”
Sir Garfield, sir, when you engage
To fix a marriageable age
For girls and boys
Don’t penalise them in their teens —•
Think of the other cruel means
The world employs;
Crooner, milk-bar, hot-rod car,
Have made them what, alas, they are;
I know Love’s blind,
But surely not enough to mate
Two teenagers in such a state;
It seems unkind. .
In fact, Sir Garfield, one surveys
Marriage in these enlightened days
With some astonishment
That such an ancient rite goes on
When other barbarisms are gone,
Like capital punishment.
So let’s end husbands; let’s end wives ;
Blot marriage from the people’s lives
Except, it’s understood, for them
Whose crimes are of such base design
As to provoke us to opine
Hanging’s too good for them !

BUNGOWANNAH
[From James Hackston]
So Princess Alexandra stayed a
night at Bungowannah
Well, my first meeting with Bun-
gowannah was when my father (“Father”
of my Bulletin stories) and I, after
a long trip, came to the heap of
tailings to be cyanided. We’d got
there just at star-dawn, and my sire
then and there cast himself down on
the ground and, shoving his head on
a log for a pillow, went to sleep for
the night.
I’ve always had a soft spot in the
heart of my memories for Bungowannah,
and it figures in a lot of my Bulletin
writing. My first Bulletin story “The
Lead Button” (with bushranger) hap-
pened at Bungowannah, and the first of
my batch of bush “Abo.”-verse, “The
Boundary Rider’s Hut,” was of Bun-
gowannah. The horse Chester in “The
Horse from Bungowannawinnie” re-
turned there to die. The dog in “Saint”
killed the sheep at Bungowannah, and
the road, tracks, ranges, wildflowers,
steers (“By the Compass” story), duck,
deer, kangaroos, wallabies, curlews, flies
and such, were mostly born there, so
to speak.
I used to walk there once a week with
my Father’s tucker (and so did the flies),
and during my trips (daylight and moon-
light) I had a wonderful time.
The boundary-rider’s hut! Lord, I’ll
never forget it. It made me proud to
stand and sit down in it. I still say
that once, on coming to a sea of blue-
bells there, I was really born to the
beauty of this world.
I’m sure that Walter, of Bath (of my
“Father” stories), could he have foreseen
that one day a Princess would stay the
night at Bungowannah would have run-
up a makeshift flag over our dud
cyanide-plant and made me join with
him in singing the National Anthem.
I’ve just read (now that the Princess
is with us) that Bungowannah means
“Parting of the Storm.” Looking back,
our storms didn’t seem to part with us
—but I know that Bungowannah did
its bit towards making a writer of me,
and —well, strike me pink! Princess,
prose and poetry . . . Bungowannah’s
done well.

Telegraphs has since explained that
faulty equipment in a new automatic
exchange was to blame, and wiped the
slate. A friend of mine on another auto-
matic exchange was very sour when his
telephone account showed him about
£l6 in the red, whereas previously he’d
used less than an eighth of that amount
on calls. Repeated demands for an
inquiry revealed that he was being
charged every time anyone put a call
through the office with which he was

“Lyrel”: For the information of
“Scotty” (B. 9/9/’59) the term “four-
wheelers” for nominal Christians doesn’t
apply in at least one very tough Vic-
torian parish, where a friend of mine
has a church. He calls them “8.P.0.5.”
They don’t bother to register their

“An Chuidh”: That McTavish of
“McMugga’s” acquaintance must surely
be a third-generation Australian Scot
whose great - grandfather came from
Ireland if he were shocked by the fact
that one firm is now making “indoor-
bagpipes” (B. 29/7/’59). Indoor or
miniature pipes have been on the market
for years. Indeed the proper name of
the Highland bagpipe is the piob mhor,
or great pipe, which would at least suggest
that a lesser pipe was known to the High-
lander. Whilst on the subject of indoor-
pipes, I must lament the fact that the
Northumberland pipes have fallen into
disuse. They are a small bagpipe de-
signed for indoor use, worked by a
bellows and played by a seated musician.
One of the sweetest and most melodious
of all wind-instruments, they have the
usual musical note-values and any tune
can be played on them. The Duke of
Norfolk has, as part of his court, two


Northumberland pipers, and to him we
are indebted for keeping alive this par-

they were short of a carpenter and he
was British he was given the option
of the job or prisoner-of-war. He
joined-up. Subsequently he settled in
Napier (N.Z.), where he acquired a wife
and a considerable family, and later
came to New South Wales, where he
spent the last 20 years of his life and
finally signed-off in the Sydney suburb
of Berala. He was a fine old sea-dog.
I knew him quite well; in fact, I
married one of his daughters.

“Bo”: The 'stamp-machines outside
our post-office are as unpredictable as
the one-armed bandits. The ha’penny
one is given to swallowing your coin—
fiendishly waiting till you’re down to
your last one —without disgorging either
paper or copper, or coyly shows a
tenuous edge that defies digital dex-
terity. But the tuppenny one is even
more exasperating. At first I put-up
with its cantankerous habit of commit-
ting petty larceny with my twin browns ;
then, goaded into irascibility, I gave if
a hearty wallop in the slats. As I lifted
the flap I saw with delight and surprise
that my admonition had been effective,
though that stamp, as it protruded,
seemed to be poking its tongue out at
me. Since then, corporal punishment
has been effective—until the other night,
when despite all my fisticuffs, the line
of stamps refused to budge. I was just
about to toss in the sponge when I let
fly with a terrific sneeze, despairingly
lifted the flap—and there was the damn’
stamp! Say, is' it possible to patent
sternutation?

“C.A.L.”: Ten minutes before a large

up a perpetual
chant of “Staff
only, staff only.”
Even then, a too-
early bird will stray
through the door-
way, like the young
man whose hesi-
tancy in the store
aroused the watch-
man’s suspicions:
“Excuse me, sir, at
first I thought you
were one of the
staff, but would
you please wait on
the footpath out-
side for another
five minutes ? ”
“Sure, by all
means,” the tres-
passer agreed good-

for thinking I was

“Sackfair”: The sign informed every-
one in the bus that the garment manu-

of his durability. Now, if it had been

“Sebak”: Paperboys, in the fiction
with which my Sunday-school annually
rewarded my regular, if reluctant,
appearance, were noble little creatures
who slaved and starved in order to take
food home to the garret in which little
crippled brothers languished and coughed
their lungs out. In far more recent years
Bing kept-up the tradition with a truly
tuneless dirge concerning “A Kid Named
Joe” who led a similarly dedicated life.
True to the Crosby example I, too, “buy
my daily papers from a kid named Joe,”
and, although his figure doesn’t
altogether suggest starvation in a noble
self-sacrifice, I didn’t' doubt that the
money he earned in the chill wintry
mornings was devoted to a very worthy
cause. It was. These days he enlivens
his morning’s business with a transistor
radio. Nothing very pretentious: “Only
cost seventeen-quid.”

“Terry”: A poor sailor, determined
to enjoy the launch-trip around the long-

not forgetting a couple of friendly
whales and miles of enchanting scenery.
She is still wondering whether it is fair
to show her friends the colored slides
she bought at the kiosk when the launch
tied-up.

P’raps he took the mental punch

But she’d laid
Her ears back and said “she’d love
Dinner at the ‘Velvet Glove’.”

That for the next week or two
He’d walk to work !
Had this soaked in his ear ?
“I had the car out, dear,
And overshot.

It’s only" just a touch
The mudguard’s got.”
Those tidings, he would know,
Would be understated so.
He’d bet his shirt
That this shooting-off her gob
Meant an insurance-job
Was just a cert.
Perhaps the words conveyed
The cake that she had made •
Turned out “a dream.”
Or she would now the sward,
Asking for no reward
But his esteem !

Of asking for a mink
Stole or a coat.”

LEASON
I knew Percy Leason: days when L.
Politzer (he published, or reprinted,
a copy of Dennis’s “Australaise,” illus-
trated by Virgil) ram a cafe in Collins
Street where the artists painted pictures
for their meals. Lucky artists —ever
heard of a restaurateur handing-out
meals for poems ? Good customers we
were: Virgil, Percy, Jimmy MacDonald,
myself and other geniuses ; Maud (Mrs.
Jimmy), Madge (later Mrs. C. J.
Dennis), Dorothy Blanchard (later
Mrs. Oscar Hammerstein), and other
charmers.
At this time Percy lived over a
tailor's shop opposite the Public Library,
and, up to this time, hadn’t started draw-
ing for The Bulletin, although I was
always at him to have a go. I remember
he’d painted pictures on all the tiles
above his fireplace—beautifully painted
fairy-story stuff, and maybe the fore-
runners of his Here is Faery illustra-
tions in color.
He could have been some mechanic,
I reckon, and I’ve always said that
although he drew things with his pen
he seemed to make things with the pen,
more than draw them. His drawings of
motor-cars, ploughs, railway-engines, and
so on, always seemed to me to have
been made with the pen more than
drawn. He knew his nuts-and-bolts and
the innards of mechanical things, just
like Kipling.
And he made models of things, too.
One Sunday morning during one of my
weekends with him he brought to light
,a perfect model of a motor-car. The
wheels were remarkable —looking at it
was like looking at a real car through
a diminisher. Then I discovered Percy’s
Sunday-morning sport: motor-car racing.
He took the model into Swanston
Street (at that time very few people
moped about the city on a Sunday morn-
ing), cranked it up and away the little
miniature car went speeding down
Swanston Street and to hell, with the
lights not there and the traffic-cops not
there. What propelled it I don’t know.
Mighter been Shell or Golden Fleece
or beer —not that Percy indulged at all;
he got drunk only on making and draw-
ing things. As yet he hadn’t come into
the Meldrum fold.
I can still see that early-1900’s model;
and what kept it plumb in the middle
of its course I don’t know —but that was
Percy Leason’s Sunday-morning sport.
HAL GYE.
“Caroline”: Alf had the good oil:
Picasso was a moral for the fourth at
Harold Park dogs. He rang the hospital
and, unable to talk to his brother, left
a message with a nurse. “It’s very im-
portant,” he said, “so listen carefully.
Tell him Mr. Picasso is coming-in tonight,
for sure’’ Picasso came-in all right,
and Alf picked up a nice little packet. But
next day his brother rang, demanding
to know the meaning of the message the
nurse had given him. “What did she
say?” asked Alf. “She told me my
brother phoned and said: ‘Your New
Australian friend is coming in to see you
tonight, for sure’.”

Brisbane tram with his right arm encased
in surgical plaster from knuckles to
elbow, in bold red letters running the
length of the cast: ‘Wo/ from fighting.”

“Cunedda”: It should pay some pub-
lisher, as a contribution to Queensland’s
Centenary Year, to reprint Thomas
Archer’s Recollections of a Rambling
Life. Archer was a member of the
Queensland pastoral family, the Archers
of Gracemere. Colin Archer, the hero
of R. S. Porteous’s short - story “The
Restless Urge” (B. 26/8/’59), was
another of the clan. Thomas Archer’s
autobiography was written on a voyage
to Japan, and was printed in that country.
A good job the Japs made of the printing,
too. Charles Barrett, in his book on
Queensland, says that only 25 copies
were printed—for distribution to mem-
bers of the family. Sydney’s Mitchell
Library has a copy. The book was
serialised in the “Sydney Mail” in the
early 1930’5. So far as the writer is
aware it has never been otherwise re-
published. Recollections of a Rambling
Life is breezily written, a vivid picture
of life in N.S.W. and Queensland in
the period from the 1820’s to the 1840’s,
and in California when the goldfields
were booming.
“A Country Race-meeting ” (including the also-ran), one of Percy Leason’s famous Bulletin series of hurnarous and
always thus gently satirical cartoons of bush life as he happily saw it.

POLITICAL POINTS
Ikhrushchower talks.

There seems to be no evidence of
swing as yet in the British elections,
but again Labor is living in the past.
Nye Bevan, who is telling the electors
that the poll may prove “the most
significant in the history of this nation
and in the history of the world,” is
asking electors to support Labor so as
to give a verdict on the Suez incident.
Generally speaking, the polling is likely
to be so close in so many electorates
that whoever wins may do so by sheer
organising.
• •
The killing of Bandaranaike, Prime
Minister of Ceylon, by a Buddhist priest
ends the regime of a leader who threw
British defences out of Ceylon, dis-
organised Ceylon’s overseas commercial
connections, and endeavored to operate
a Leftist “anti-colonial” policy which in-
volved trying to govern a mass of
quarrelling elements in an essentially
Buddhist country in which Communism,
Trotskyism and Tamil politics were
ugly foreign excrescences. The rich little
island has been in turmoil for over a
year as the Communists, who had looked
originally on Bandaranaike as their
avatar, sought to gain control by strike
and riot, with the Tamils violently
agitating in the background. The shadow
of Tibet seems to hang over the murder.
Son of a K.C.M.G., a graduate of
Christ Church, Oxford, and a member
of the Inner Temple, Bandaranaike was
a product of the Leftist and “anti-
colonial” parlor-pink influences of
English universities. But his Leftism
had rapidly eroded during the past year
or so under the influence of contact
with Moscow’s policies and subversion.

At the request* of W. R. Weiley,
Country-party M.L.A. for Clarence,
N.S.W. Minister for Agriculture Nott
will seek from England full information
about a reported new process for pre-
serving milk by ultrasonic means. The
process is said to be cheap and the milk
is preserved in perfect condition up to
18 months. Weiley hopes the process may
enable Australian dairymen to open-up
markets in Asian countries. Let’s hope
he’s right, but if they can’t deliver the
milk to Asia any more cheaply than
they can in Sydney they won’t sell much.

A conference between the A.C.T.U.
and representatives of equal-pay com-
mittees in the various States decided in
Melbourne to recommend the holding
of an equal-pay week next March, and
also to ask the Federal Government to
support equal-pay at the 1.L.0. con-
ference in Geneva at that time. As Can-
berra doesn’t practise equal-pay, that
request must be regarded as of token-
value only.
• •
In the process of amending their
Public Hospitals Act to. make provision
for training medical students from the
University of N.S.W. at Prince Henry
Hospital the Cahills have struck a snag.
For some reason they decided to seize
the opportunity to insert a clause re-
quiring the retirement of all hospital
chief executives and matrons at 65 and
of all hospital-board members at 70.
Now they’re beginning to fear that some-
one will suggest that what’s sauce for
the hospital goose is sauce for the
Cabinet gander. Cahill, Heffron and
Gus Kelly are within sight of 70 ; Billy
Sheahan is nudging 65.

Some sort of trophy should be
designed to reward the M.P.s who stoutly
set-out to prove that Singapore is a
whistle-stop on the way to Christmas
Island. A second reward should be
given them as the shyest M.P.s known
to history, something which makes it
difficult to identify them. When their
retiring modesty allows their fame to be
trumpeted publicly a model of a side-
ways-moving Indian Ocean land-crab
might fill the bill —or a brassbound
school geography-book.

local miners dominate the situation.
There were four candidates, including
Morgan Phillips, general-secretary of the
Labor party. The electorate is a Red-
ribbon one with a 17,000 Labor majority.
The miners’ vote threw Phillips out by
103 to 81 in favor of a working miner
with ten children. No high Labor official
has ever before suffered such an
indignity.

Dr. C. E. W. Bean, official historian
of World War I, who will be 80 in
November, has stipulated that the con-

What about a holiday at Senator’s
Paradise?


Sydney “Sun,” reporting the arrival
of Khrushchev in Des Moines, lowa,
mentioned a placard which proclaimed,
“We butcher dogs, not people.” It
seemed rather a strange thing to boast
about, and more likely to bring strong
protests from the Tailwaggers’ Club and
the Anti-Vivisection Society than a
blush of shame to the face of Mr. K.

Brisbane eyes popped last week at
the sight of nine gleaming Common-
wealth cars parked boot-to-bumper along
a city laneway. The cars were waiting
to ferry Immigration Advisory Council
members and Immigration Department
staff to their hotel three blocks away.
In Brisbane for a two-day council meet-
ing, the 20-odd delegates and staff were
flown to Brisbane from Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Canberra with all expenses
paid and were met by Commonwealth
cars at the airport. Most of them stayed
at Lennons. On the first of the two
days they conferred for three hours
before climbing into the waiting cars
to be wafted away to a cocktail-party.
Nice work if you can get it.

Sydney Anglican Synod, as a step

Nearly two-thirds of all overseas
capital entering Australia in the past
decade came from the United Kingdom,
Earl De La Warr told Sydney Rotary
last week. British investment amounted
to £456 million ; U.S. and Canada
£lB9 million.
Keith Funston, president of New
York Stock Exchange, discussing Aus-
tralian development at a State luncheon
in Sydney, also mentioned oversea-
investment. His figures for U.S. invest-
ment here covered only the past seven
years. He said that between 1952 and
1958 U.S. capital invested in Australia
increased from 310-million dollars to
673 - million dollars. The latest estimate
placed it at 750-million dollars.
Touching on another aspect of
capital-inflow, the Tariff Board in its
latest report warns that it “does not
seem prudent to rely on capital-inflow
continuing to increase at a sufficient rate
to permit further expansion of imports”
—which is another way of saying that
if we want to import more (as with
a growing population we must) we will
have to increase our exports.
Paul Hasluck, Minister for the Terri-
tories, has certainly made a good move
promoting underground-water surveys
and subsidising bores and dams in the
Northern Territory. But isn’t it time
there was an inquiry on the lines of
the Railway Break-of-gauge Committee
to examine the whole question of pro-
viding water to enable the fertile lands
of the interior to be used for other pur-
poses than sheep- and cattle-raising?

One of the liveliest domestic issues
in West Germany at present is the
planned denationalisation of the Volks-
wagen works, with the stock to be sold
in small shares to the public. Originally
the “people’s car” was to be built by
a State-owned concern set up by Hitler.
Immediately after War II the plant was
sequestrated by the British Military
Government and placed under trustee-
ship. In 1949 it was directed that v the
German Federal authorities should
decide its ownership and at present,
legally, the plant, with 40,000 employees
and a turnover of 2700-million marks
annually, has no owner. A law is pro-
jected to allow it to first become the
property of the West German Govern-
ment, and then for its disposal by the
sale of shares. Completion of the deals
is promised before mid-1961.

Recent attacks on the administration

Likely split of Queensland’s 78 new
State electorates between Liberal and
Country parties for next year’s election
seems to be 37 seats each, with four
contested by a joint candidate. Liberals
have earmarked Brisbane’s 28 metro-
politan seats, two in each of Ipswich,
Toowoomba and Rockhampton, plus
Mackay and Lockyer. A joint-party
candidate will contest two Townsville
seats and two adjoining that northern
city, with the C.P. fighting a certain
34 or 35 seats outside Brisbane. Seats
not definitely staked-out last week were
in the provincial cities of Cairns, Bunda-
berg and Maryborough.

Bolte told a Develop Victoria Coun-
cil gathering that present charges for
electricity would enable the Electricity
Commission to finance ultimately nearly
half of its development programme from
revenue. (He claims they were the
second-lowest in Australia and would
not rise for 10 to 20 years.) Financing
development from revenue is a post-war
invention in Canberra. Posterity in Vic-
toria should be well-to-do, assuming that
the consumer gets the benefit finally.

“Kandy”: Ceylon tea-growers have
contributed a large sum for the Tea
Centre to be opened by the Ceylon High
Commissioner in Melbourne in Novem-
ber. The centre will be the second in
the British Commonwealth, the first
being in Regent Street, London, and it
represents a shot in the war against
the growing popularity of coffee in
“espresso bars” and elsewhere. Tea-
consumption is falling in this country,
but there is a strong trend to
better - quality teas. The new centre
will serve good tea, provide curries for
luncheon and dinner, and have various
displays. Sydney may get a similar
centre if suitable premises can be found
at a reasonable price.

Lack of even one Commonwealth-

Personal
ITEMS
G. Keith Funston, president of the
New York Stock Exchange, on a visit
to Australia as the guest of Sydney and
Melbourne ’Changes, is a youthful-look-
ing, happy-mannered man of economics
who originated from lowa (the Dead-
wood Dick country) and who still has
an ease and freshness which one does
not usually associate with the denizen
of New York, either native or intro-
duced. In Sydney Mr. Funston has
shown himself to be an ideal public-
relations man not only for Wall Street
but for capitalism as a whole. It is his
aim to “multiply the capitalist’s numbers
and humanise his functions.” In an age
in which investment, partly through the
bogy of inflation, has reached down to
the middle-income classes in much the
same way as in an earlier generation
the automobile ceased to be the vehicle
of only the wealthy, a man of broader
economic outlook than the old-time
sharemarket operator is required in a
high financial place like the presidency
of the Wall Street Exchange, and
Funston seems to fill the bill admirably.

Dr. Hopkins, 62, has practised 34 years

McDonnel, of Brisbane, in the president
post.

“Collins Street”: Years ago, when
Joseph Greening, who has been ap-
pointed Chief Inspector of Primary
Schools in Victoria, was an inspector
in the Wimmera district, he gave three
young scholars (about 20 per cent, of
the total attendance) a lift home from
a school he had visited, and as he
deposited them at their gate an eight-
year-old said, “Thanks, Mr. Greening.
I’m so glad you came today. We’ve had
you now.” He never held it against the
young teacher.
He also recalls a Wimmera school
where he was examining a class of
infants in stories, and their favorite was
Cinderella. He got as far as the ball,
and asked whom she danced with. The
children agreed it was the king’s son,
but couldn’t name his title. They play
a lot of solo in the Wimmera, though,
and one little bloke came up brightly
with, “I know! The Jack.” The new
Chief has been 43 years in the depart-
ment, teaching at Carlton, Charlton,
Jeetho, Berriwillock, East Kew, Mace-
don, Glen Waverley, Upwey, Benalla,
and inspecting schools for the depart-
ment in the Horsham and Maryborough
areas ; and he has also been officer-in-
charge of English classes for adult
migrants.
The gentleman with the pipe is John
Stuart —generally known as “Stuart” —
Gardiner, private-secretary to the N.S.W.
Parliamentary Country Party for 26 years
and a backroomer who could tell a tale
or two about political ins and outs if
he had a mind to: he hasn’t and doesn’t,
discretion and loyalty being as essential
qualifications in the job as the ability
to get on with Parliamentarians and the
people who vote for them; so, while Prior
sketched him for The Bulletin, Stuart
Gardiner talked in his quiet way mainly
about the joys and perils of rural life.
He’s had experience of both, but at 65 admits
to a nostalgia for the bush, regarding himselt
as something of an exile in the city.
A son of the Manse, born in New Zealand
but coming young to Manly, the Sydney sea-
side suburb, he went to Fort Street and Sydney
PARLIAMENTARY SEC.
Grammar, then to Wagga Experiment Farm,
jackerooed around, and later managed a station
near Forbes. Back after four years with
the 12th Light Horse in Egypt and Palestine,
he tried his hand at orange-farming at Gosford
—a mistake, he says, because, apart from the
fact that it was a particularly lean time for
orange-growers, his heart wasn’t really in
orcharding, but in the wider, freer land-life he
knew. In fact, even now . . .
But that experience;, if unrewarding finan-
cially, was useful in other ways: he was a
pioneer of co-operative marketing of citrus
and has a sympathetic understanding of the
difficulties of the small man-on-the-land, not,
perhaps, altogether to be expected in a high
official of what political opponents occasionally
claim to be a “silvertail” outfit.
A stint of journalism—rather than sit down
and bemoan the times he went bush, more-or-
less making himself a job as roving corres-
pondent for a couple of papers—and experi-
ence as general-secretary of Earle Page’s
ambitious Northern New South Wales and
Southern Queensland Travel Promotion and
Development Association must have been
useful background, too. The depression killed
the venture, but it laid the foundations for
much of the tourist and other activity that has
emerged in those parts in a more favorable
climate. He made what he claimed was his
maiden speech at a function in his honor at
Parliament House last year, when another
well-known Light Horseman, Colonel Bruxner,
made the presentation.

John (“Starkey”) Starke, the Mel-
bourne Q.C., is yet another in the list of
counsel to bob-up for Stuart before the
royal commission in Adelaide, where,
bewilderingly, their Honors have been
preserving admirable judicial calm.
He has a large Melbourne practice.
His father was the late Sir Hayden
Starke, of the High Court, a name he did
not have to pioneer in the courts; but
he has won his way on his merits. He
appears frequently in the criminal courts,
and he is at least one of the cleverest
cross-examiners at the Bar, but, like
most Q.C., no doubt, his success is due
chiefly to long hours of hard work study-
ing briefs.
He served with the A.I.F. in the Middle
East and New Guinea, and is still, at
45, an active sportsman. He is an
enthusiastic punter, too, but he scares
the Melbourne bookies only physically.
He is just under 6ft. 4in.

The Uni.’s cyclotron was built with
£20,000 cash subscribed by the public
and hard labor by Dr. Caro himself,
five other physicists and six technicians.
It is reputed to be the world’s cheapest
cyclotron.
He was in his second year of physics
when he joined the R.A.A.F. during the
war and was a radar-officer for four-
and-a-half years, returning to his uni-
versity-course in 1946 and later studying
in England under Oliphant. JJe is a

He obtained his B.Ec. (first-class honors)
in government in 1956. He goes to the
London School of Economics, and
studies will include research into the early
organisation of the Liberal and Conserva-

officer in the genetics section of
C.5.1.R.0.’s division of plant industry
in 1952-53, has since been plant patholo-
gist at the Waite Agricultural Research
Institute. B.Ag. (genetics) in 1952, and

The appointment of Ernest Coates as
State Director of Finance in Victoria
from November was no surprise—

Like the current Treasury boss, Sir

to a top post; he is 43. He was
appointed Economics Research Officer
in 1954 and accompanied Premier Bolte

Dr. John Michael Berceanu, who’s
negotiating for an offer by German

Rumanian-born, Australian-naturalised,
he has worked as station-hand, migrant
liaison-officer, entomologist and clerk,
yet holds European university degrees
in statistics, veterinary science and agri-
cultural science, with doctorates in the
last two.
His father—once mayor of Bucharest
and Agricultural Minister in the
Rumanian Liberal Government —was a
martyr to Rumania’s Communist regime.
Dr. Berceanu himself was four times
jailed on charges trumped-up by the
Communists, before he broke-out of
Bucharest Military Prison in 1948 and
fled to Vienna. Through 1949 and part
of 1950 he was controller of German
agriculture with the Occupation Army
at Baden, then migrated to Australia.
Speaking six modern languages, as well
as Greek and Latin, Dr. Berceanu is at
present clerking in the State Titles Office,
Brisbane. Fantastic as his claims may
sound, he can support them with docu-
ments and photostats and had no trouble
standing-up to a searching investigation
by the Queensland Government.

“A.W.D.”: John Buchan, new leader
of the Victorian Liberals, learned his
quiet and studious approach to politics
from R. G. Casey. He helped Casey in
his Corio campaigns while still at Geelong
Grammar and when he first joined his
father’s firm of architects. Ever since
he’s been watching Casey’s innings from
the boundary, Casey trained himself for
handling foreign-affairs talking to
audiences at lunches and in clubs ;
Buchan, though sticking to housing,
traffic and municipal problems, while
keeping an eye on State and Federal
affairs from a niche in the South Yarra
branch of the Liberal party, has copied
his master in making world-tours —eight
in the last few years. Like Casey, too,
he keeps-up with the rising generation —
Casey does it through the Constitutional
Club, Buchan through Apex, of which
he was a co-founder 25 years ago. He
has American architectural connections
and is a councillor of the Australian-
American Association, but he hasn’t
neglected the European scene ; he came

useful job with the R.S.A. “Review,"’ turning
it from a free quarterly to a monthly with a

In Perth, at 98, John E. Edis, who came
to Kalgoorlie in 1896 and took a prominent

ABORIGINALITIES
a spur of the Australian Alps a
rain-laden gale was threatening to
transfer the 12-pupil school down into
the gully, while inside, competing with
the rain’s loud rhythm on the iron roof,
teacher, a mate of mine, was struggling
with a prescribed poem by Browning.
One wiry, mountain-bred lad gave away
the scented fields of England for the
drama outside the window. Teacher
finished the poem, but the boy gazed on
through the rain-swept glass. Then, still
unmoving, he commented: “How’d ya
like (o be a Tom Tit out in that!”
Teacher put Browning in the cupboard
and produced Australian Bush Ballads.
Kid in front, eyes brightening: “Read
us ‘The Man From Snowy River,’ sir.”
Teacher reminded him that he had
already read it the week before. “Mr.
King used to read it every week,” the-
boy said. So the brumbies got another
hiding.—“L. V. G.”

“Pisces”: Removing the hook from a
big blue-groper I noticed that one of
its long front teeth was broken in half ;
and, being a dentist, I also took note
that, although it was black and obviously
dead, there was no sign of decay. Then
it dawned on me that I had never seen
one fish with a decayed tooth in the
many years I'd been catching ’em. I’d
put that down to almost total absence
of carbohydrate in their food, plus the
probability of there being a very small
quantity of fluorine in sea-water. Any
other theories on the caries-free condi-
tion of fishes’ teeth?

“Jay”: It was curious to learn, per
The Bulletin, that biscuit-tins were
once used as tanks on Australian farms.
Here in Sarawak out-stations still use
them (approx. 4 cub.-ft.). They are from
the U.K., which is probably where those
used in Australia came from. The tanks
carry the legend: “Jacob’s Biscuits,”
and on one side a replica of a- wine-
glass provides, in a land of many
languages, a universal mode of saying,
“This side up.”

“G iff.”: One of the most unlikely
places you'd expect to find shellgrit in
large quantities would be Woomera,
h.-q. of the rocket-range in S.A., and
at least 150 miles from the coast. It is
feet-thick on the bed of a dry lake owning
the beautiful name of Whisky Swamp.
“He's a bachelor; he doesn't like females."
“J.F.”: In an age of newspaper
monopolies and combines, some of the
most forthright journalism is found in
the country press. As an example of a
local comment with a sting in it, I like
this piece in the “Gundagai Independent”
(September 3):
It is to be hoped that the North Gunda-
gai Commons Trust do not throw a
spanner in the works to hold the big
Legacy golf day at Gundagai, by refusing
the club permission to mow the fairways.
Forget the dealers’ vealers for a while
and think of the kids Legacy is helping.
In God's good time the rain will come

“Crow Eater”: A new “manna from
Heaven” operation will be seen in the
N.T. if plans of an Adelaide firm, North-
gate, Ltd., are successful. The idea is
to save the lives of millions of sheep and
cattle during outback droughts by drop-
ping fodder-concentrates from the air.
Tests already made indicate that an
ounce of this highly-vitaminised product
of lucerne-meal will sustain a sheep and
soz. a cow for a day. It is proposed to
send the concentrates to the Territory
and northern areas of S.A. by rail; a
chartered plane will then fly over stations,
dropping them round bores and water-
holes where sheep and cattle congregate.
All that the station people will have to
do is furnish the pilot with a guide to
the waterholes. It is hoped that by this
method drought-losses running into
millions wili be cut by at least 50 per cent.

“Curie”: One of the most useful things
to be found on mining-fields, or wherever
they use explosives, is the fracteur-box.
Four of them can be used as supports
for an innerspring-mattress base. In

with a top for low tables, and so on.

“Rehab.”: During the regular
babbler’s absence from the station the
carpenter’s young wife undertook to do
the cooking. Instead of the usual cold
beef and pickles, she delighted us with
a concoction of savory-mince—that is,
all except old Tom, the pumper. Declar-
ing that the station was “gettin’ too
civilised,” he loaded his few belongings
on to a packhorse and headed on a
lone journey from Tennant Creek to
the old-timers’ camping-ground at
Booraloola in the Gulf country. Tom’s
place on the bore was taken by an
18-year-old “Texas” type from the city.
About a fortnight after he started the
station-engineer returned from an
inspection-tour to report that the new

In the last resort when gold
Is gone the upright stones remain ;
Coverlets of bramble, mould,
Autumn leaves and clay enfold
These below the timeless rain.
Nature flooding like a wave
Closes in ; this darkening pine
Growing from an ancient grave
Breaks the rpouldering bones that crave
Death's impeccable design.

Were the arguments of greed
That these dead might supersede

“Kerba”: The owners of that deserter
dog (B. 9/9/’59) needn’t wave good-bye
to the £25 he cost them. A
happy-go-lucky mong once
adopted us and persistently
refused to stay-put when we
returned him to his mistress.
Then her husband, who had
been working away, came
home. He arrived at our place
with a length of greenhide;
but, to our relief, it wasn’t to
administer punishment. His
plan was simple. “The missus
has been working the wrong
way —she’s been tying him up
so he won’t go away. Well,
I want you to tie him up for
a bit. When you let him off
he’ll come home, where he'll
be free. If he comes back
again, keep on tying him and
he’ll stop coming.” He did.

“Septulm”: Snooping on
Victorian Psittacifonnes con-
vinces one that, be it gang-
gangs on hawthorn, lowries on
lowanberries or rosellas on
Cootamundra-seed, the pattern
of left-claw-roosting with
right-claw-feeding is curiously
rigid. But the first feathered
N.S.W. denizen we saw as we
crossed the Darling at Went-
worth was a galah molly-
dooking a cluster of gum-
blossom to his beak.

“J.H.”: While councils in
country towns, eager to show
how progressive they are, pull
out old hitching-posts, Meb
bourne has re-erected one in
front of the Richmond Town
Hall, and others are preserved
in the metropolitan area. Two
excellent examples in -front of
the Carlton and United
Brewery in Carlton have
finely - ornamented columns
surmounted by small barrels
of solid brass. A hitching-
post outside the Marine Hotel,
Brighton, is surrounded by a
protective railing, and its
brass-plate records that Adam
Lindsay Gordon tethered his
horse to the post during his
residence there in 1869-70. South Yarra
has the only surviving post which served
a private residence —a thick tree-bough
which still has its original ring and hook,
and is said to be 100 years old. Also,
outside an old saddler’s shop in Queen’s
Parade, Clifton Hill, there’s an iron
octagonal post with a ball at the top, and
fitted with three rings and hooks.
In his interesting Bulletin article
“They’ll Tell You About Me,” Alec
Chisholm said he thought the word
“Pommy” was current before 1906. It
could have been, but I hadn’t heard it
then. The first of the big waves of
British/ arrivals were immigrants ; when
Cockney rhyming-slang came in they
became' Jimmygrants. That would be
about 1908-10. A few years later, when
“Happy about the brakes? Now,
the next point. ...”
Australian girls were finding office-work
and factory-work better paid and more
congenial than domestic service, S.S.
Miltiades was chartered to bring to Aus-
tralia some hundreds of British girls to
fill the vacuum. These were mostly
country lasses, and their round faces
and rosy cheeks soon caused “Pome-
granates” to be applied to them—and
that was quickly shortened to “Pommy.”
That cargo of the Miltiades didn’t solve
the domestic-service problem. Within a
few months of their arrival most of the
girls were married. —“Duke” Tritton.

“Buffo”: You could be forgiven for
thinking Mount Isa’s main production
is the greatest thirst in Australia. A
house-party held here recently by
Naussies to celebrate a christening
managed to dispose of seven kegs (18’s)
in one night. It’s said the consumption
of grog is equal to that of petrol —no
mean feat when you consider that there
are more cars per head in the Isa than
in any other town in the State. Car-
pennants on sale here don’t depict any-
thing as common as the pithead, but a
foaming glass of lager. Bottles are con-
sidered too awkward to take along in
the car, and a wonderful crop of empty
cans can now be seen sprouting along-
side all the tracks. So if you happen to
break-down at night you need only stand
a few empty cans around your vehicle
and they shine like cats’ eyes in the
headlights of oncoming traffic.

“Kelms”: Writing in Perth’s first
paper, “The Inquirer,” on February 15,
1843, the botanist James Drummond
described a trip he made southwards
of Perth. He mentioned “a gallinaceous
bird, about the size of the common
domestic-hen, called nau by the natives
.... They eat the seeds of different
species of acacia and sometimes they
come' into the valley of the Avon with
the bronzewing-pigeon to feed on them.”
That was the mallee-fowl. I don’t know
what pronunciation Drummond ascribed
to “nau” or how it corresponds with
the modern spelling—“now” —but both
spellings seem to fall short of the genuine
native pronunciation. Odd that English,
probably the most advanced language the
world has known, hasn’t suitable counter-
parts for the stone-age words of our
aborigines.

Mention here of Murray Island
regattas reminds me of the
miniature-craft meets regularly held on
Coconut Island, Torres Straits. Binghi
is 3. superb modeller, and the craft he
devised were perfect small-scale replicas
of the luggers and cutters with which
he worked in the m.-0.-p. and trochus
game. The model-meets were held on
the lagoon. Much wagering in rope-
stick- and packet-tobacco took place on
all events. Officialdom viewed the meets
with a jaundiced eye, because enthusiasm
they generated was inclined to make the
islanders loath to resume their bread-
winning role of skin-diving from the
real craft communally owned by the
population of the various islands. But
then, Binghi always goes the whole hog
when he falls victim to a new craze.
When marbles was first introduced to the
Archipelago the whole population
downed tools to play big- and little-ring
in marathon tourneys commencing at
crack of dawn and extending into the
night by the light of coconut-leaf flares.
Finally harassed officialdom outlawed the
game.—“Shamuseen.”

CAPITALISM'S "NEW LOOK"
[Part of an address by G. Keith
i'unston, president of New York
Stock Exchange, to members and
guests of Sydney Stock Exchange
on September 24.]
A s in Australia, great changes
have shaped the American
economy since the end of
World War 11. Perhaps the
most significant of these has
been the explosive growth of
America’s middle-income mil-
lions. In recent years this
group, with its vast savings and
numerical superiority, has come
to hold the balance of our
economic power.
In a complex society, it’s
true that a man no longer
has at his personal disposal
the tools he needs to produce
life’s necessities and luxuries.
But he may certainly own
those tools nevertheless. And
in the U.S. he is doing just
that!
More and more, the Ameri-
can people have seized their
opportunity to invest directly
and indirectly in our publicly-
held companies. In increasing
numbers they have become the
voting owners of those busi-
nesses. As a result, what we
call a “People’s Capitalism”
has emerged. In its scope and
impact this ownership of the
means of production is with-
out precedent in economic
history.
This development must be
linked, of course, to America’s
over-all level of prosperity in
the past decade ; to high per-
sonal incomes which, could be
channelled into investments ; to
a generally rising stockmarket;
and to a growing understand-
ing of the investment process.
Also, we recognise that a vivid
fear of continued inflation
undoubtedly has prompted
many people in recent years to
invest in stocks in the hope
of protecting their purchasing-
power.
Whatever the separate
causes, however, I believe that
in the long view of history the
growth of mass-ownership—
of a democratically - based
“People’s Capitalism” will
take its place as a major
economic landmark. As we
once passed from a feudal
society to the industrial revo-
lution and a primitive form
of capitalism, so we are
emerging now with a new
brand of capitalism.
Marxist propaganda has
attempted to paint the capitalist
“You just missed them —they Went to th'
drive-in pictures .”
as unspeakably evil. But the
weight of evidence —particu-
larly the living-standards
enjoyed by a free people —
demonstrates that a democracy,
far from eliminating the
capitalist, can multiply his
numbers and humanise his
functions. Our businesses have
indeed become more demo-
cratic, more productive, and
more, responsive.
People who invest must tailor
their risks to what they
can afford. Further, the New
York Stock Exchange makes
it clear that people should
have a steady income, cash
savings and other protection
for their families before invest-
ing. They should get the facts
and seek sound advice from a
broker whose reputation they
can check ; and, finally, they
should stay away from the
rumor-mongers and the get-
rich-quick artists.
Apart from our informa-
tional activities, we have helped
develop investing techniques
that bring ownership within
the practical reach of millions
of people.
Our Monthly Investment
Plan, for example, is perhaps
the best known. No other
device has so dramatised the
idea that a man of average
means can invest in the stock
of his choice, out of income,
for as little as 45 cents a day.
About 100,000 people are
regularly utilising this invest-
ment medium and the number
is growing each month.
In addition, we have
encouraged the investment-
club movement through which
groups of 10 or 15 people pool
small sums —say, $lO a month
—to buy securities. Finally,
our community has had notable
success in persuading each of
America’s 50 States to pass
laws making it easy to make
stock gifts to youngsters.
f'iUR listed companies, also,
have done considerable
work to broaden the ownership
base. They have waged their
own education programmes
and encouraged the growth qf
employee stock-plans—some
of them calling for automatic
payroll deductions. Today,
over 1.3-million people are;
investing regularly through!
employee plans.
In 1952 only one in, 16 U.S.
adults—or 6.5-million indivi-
duals —owned shares. By 1956
the number had jumped to
8.6-million. Between 1956 and
1959 100,000 new investors a
month were added: almost
four-million since 1956.
The shareowner population,
in other words, stood at 12.5
million—up 45 per cent, in
three years, and almost double
the level of seven years ago.
One out of every eight adults
was counted among the share-
owning population. In addi-
tion, some 100-million people
are indirect owners through
their investments in insurance
companies, pension funds and
other institutions which own
shares.
Statistically, shareowners
come from every part of the
country and every walk of life.
Their average household
income is $7OOO annually.
About three-quarters of the
total earn under $lO,OOO.
Almost half are in the $5OOO-
- 10,000 income range.
Women shareowners out-
number men —and the largest
single group of owners is made
up of housewives.
There is no question in my
mind that the future financing
of our industries is tied to the
soundness and success with
which our Stock Exchange
educational efforts develop.
But, even more important, by
putting ownership within the
reach of millions of people, we
can exert an enormous
influence for good on the
growth of the free world.
For this reason, while we are
pleased with the results of our
own efforts to date, we by no
means feel that share-
ownership has gone as far as
it can and should.
The idea of mass stock-
ownership among millions of

one. But if the idea can be

Wendell Holmes observed, his

Interest in Mt. Lyell
tl/JTH the sudden, strong
’ * support for Cuming
Smith shares, which went up
in a few days from 465. to 525.
in Melbourne, investment
interest has also swung natur-
ally to Mt. Lyell Mining and
Railway Co.
Mt. Lyell has a smaller (com-
paratively) interest in nearly
everything of which Cuming
Smith has a piece, with the
addition of a large swag of
shares in Metal Manufactures,
Ltd.
That is forgetting (if one
can) the actual Mt. Lyell mine
on the Tasmanian west coast.
But it is only on rare occa-
sions that the Mt. Lyell mine
makes a loss, and one would
probably be quite safe in
regarding it as a neutral factor
in profit-earning. No doubt
the board has clearly defined
markers at which production
could be shut-down in the
event of mining threatening to
become a permanent drain on
the undertaking. This con-
tingency is discussed because
of the low grade of ore being
treated at Mt. Lyell and the
current comparatively low
world price of copper. The
Australian price is fixed con-
siderably above the world price,
and a copper-bounty is re-
ceived by producers in certain
circumstances. Even so, Lyell’s
profit from mining during the
term to June 30 last was a
nominal one only £15,944
after charging all administra-
tion expenses and interest to
revenue.
In the balance-sheet, outside
liabilities of all kinds were, at
£2,009,000, just about covered
bv liquid and semi-liquid
assets. Mine-property, other
freeholds, machinery, hydro-
electric plant, railways and
rolling-stock had a written-
down book-value of £2,601,157.
Throwing-in all these fixed
assets for good measure as an
offset against the outside debt
(though even in the event of
the mine becoming unpayable
there would be considerable
value attaching to some of the
property items), the investor
should be able to contemplate
with comparative equanimity
the co.’s investment portfolio
as representing unencumbered
shareholders’ funds.

equal to over 375. for each
Commonwealth Fertiliser share.
Cuming Smith Mt. Lyell, in
W.A., is strongly established,
and recently announced a
two-for-five bqnus-issue, which
will add to the mining co.’s
holding as at June 30 last.
Metal Manufactures is a
fabricator of copper and non-

and a 30 p.c. holding in British
Insulated Callender’s Cables
(Aust.), which acts as selling-
agents for the co.’s wire and

In the term to July 31, 1958,
Metal Manufactures, Ltd.,
showed a consolidated net
profit equal to 20 p.c. on capital,
and paid a 10 p.c. dividend. It
has reserves equal to 16s. 6d.

back of the investment port-
folio would be much higher
than that.
Mt. Lyell, with its small net
mining profit added, showed
total net earnings of £291,276
for 1958-59 (12.2 p.c. on
capital) and declared a
dividend of Is. 9d. (8| p.c.) a
share for the year. The divi-
dend is taxable, as it is not
derived from mining.
Yield at the current market
price of 365. for Mt. Lyell
shares would be 4.9 p.c.
Although the fertiliser
interests associated with the
Mt. Lyell mine originally grew
out of its necessity for dispos-
ing of sulphur output (super-
phosphate is made principally
from sulphuric acid and phos-
phate), and its associated
fertiliser-works are designed to
deal with sulphur made from
Australian pyrites, it hardly
seems true to say that fertiliser-
production depends on the con-
tinuance of mining at Mt. Lyell
and elsewhere. The plant could
no doubt be adapted to treat
imported brimstone in an
emergency. The Common-
wealth Government has de-
cided to continue paying a
bounty on sulphuric acid pro-
duced from local pyrites in
those cases where companies
adapted their plant for this
purpose when imported brim-
stone was either scarce or dear.
Purchase of Mt. Lyell shares
would provide a fairly broad
interest in Australian primary
and secondary industries.
A.F.T.’s Land-trust
/~\n October 1 Australian
Fixed Trusts Pty. will
launch its A.F.T. Property and
Buildings Trust. The funds of
the trust will be mainly inves-
ted in first-class real-estate
investments, and the opening
price of units will be ss. each.
Raine and Horne Pty., Ltd.,
and Richard Stanton and Sons
Pty., Ltd., are real-estate
advisers to the trust, and Per-
petual Trustee Co. (Canberra)
Ltd., a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Perpetual Trustee
Company (Ltd.), will act as
Trustee.
A.F.T.’s real-estate advisers
estimate that on a conservative
basis investors can expect an
average income return not less
than 7 p.c. p.a. over the life of
the trust, in addition to which
considerable tax-free capital
appreciation is expected.
The A.F.T. project follows
closely on the launching of the
L. J. Hooker-sponsored land-
trusts, which have received
public subscriptions of nearly
£2 million already.
Land-trusts, by their very
nature, must be more catholic
in their choice of particular
investments than shareholding
unit-trusts, and calculations of
probable returns are more
speculative. But prospects in
the real-estate business at the
moment are undoubtedly on
the rosy side. How long they
will remain so is anybody's
guess. Much will depend on
management in the success of
land-trusts.
Onkaparinga Woollen
CJouth Australian com-
panies have produced some
startlingly markeLstimulating
surprises from under the mat-
tress this year, and one result
has been a greater attention
to Adelaide stocks by investors
from other States as well as
from the local lads.
A tight-lipped but well-set-
up member of the South
Australian fraternity is Onka-
paringa Woollen Co., Ltd., the
rugs and blankets of which
are a household word through-
out Australia. It also produces
woollen dressing-gowns and
“blueys” (lumber-jackets).
Up to 1956-57 a series of
124 p.c. divs. was paid comfort-
ably out of profits shown at
much below what the tax-figure
would suggest. Then, during
the 1956-57 term, a two-for-
three bonus-issue was made
from revaluation of freehold
properties, and paid capital
jumped from £248,433 to
£414,055.
In the two years since
then the div. has been 8 p.c.
(1957-58) and 9 p.c. (1958-59)
cut of profits shown at 14.7 p.c.
and 17.5 p.c. respectively oh
average capital.
But in 1957-58 tax was
shown at £58,000 in respect of
profits disclosed at £61,262.
In 1958-59 tax was shown at
£65,000, profit at £72,473.
Working back from tax,
profit for 1957-58 would look
more like £96,665, and that
for 1958-59 at £108,330, equal
to 23 p.c. and 26 p.c. respec-
tively on capital.
A fine pile of visible reserves
made the net tangible backing
for each £1 ord. 50s. 7d. last
balance-day. But stocks at
£311,570 and plant at £247,043
seem very conservatively
valued, and would appear to
support ideas aroused by the
tax/profit relationship.
Liquidity is very comfort-
able, and there is no indica-
tion that the co. will be in
immediate need of any funds
from shareholders other than
those held-back in the form
of undistributed disclosed and
undisclosed earnings. But
shareholders get a very reason-
able run for their money in
the way of divs. notwithstand-
ing: the present 9 p.c. divi-
dend is equal to 15 p.c. on the
pre-bonus capital, and it looks
as though it could soon be up
to 10 p.c. (flat) again, with pros-
pects of increment still bright.
Onkaparinga £1 shares were
available at 365. before publi-
cation of the latest accounts.
Last sale was at 38s. and
buyers now offer that figure
without attracting sellers. On
the basis of expectations of a
10 p.c. div. the yield would
be 5 p.c. at 40s.
“Tax Sputniks’*
/~vne of the difficulties the
reviewer has in dealing
with Tax Sputniks, b y
J. A. L. Gunn and Giovanni
Merda di Toro Malachi, is in
deciding where the Gunn leaves-
off and the Malachi begins. But
it is by no means all Malachi
—or di Toro, for that matter —
and the legal judgments
quoted, exotic though some of
them may appear, no doubt
have a very sound application
to Australian taxation pro-
cedures.
The main purpose of the
book is to point-out some of
the methods by which tax is
avoided legitimately in Aus-
tralia. It is remarked that there
are two sorts of tax-escapers
—the avoider and the evader.
“The avoider is the aristocrat
—the buccaneer as opposed to
the pirate.” But it deals with
other facets of tax-incidence,
too.
“The Case of the Stipended
Salope,” discreetly studied
in an Egyptian decision,
is about a lady employed as
a dancer, but who had three
supporting gentlemen-friends.
It was held that two gentlemen-
friends might not have
deprived the taxpayer of her
amateur status, but that
with three contemporaneous
stipending friends the lady was
carrying-on a second vocation,
that the income so derived
was from personal exertion,
and that as such was taxable.
Tax Sputniks deals with the.
formation of “snakes” and
“chains” of private companies
to avoid payment of undistri-
buted-profits tax, the phony
“public” company, family
partnerships and livestock
valuations, the use of private
companies and superannuation
funds to avoid tax, other
deeply-thought-out schemes,
as well as many suggestions
and recommendations for the
clarification of the income-
tax laws of the Common-
wealth, and a special chapter
on “Tax Problems of the New
Australian.”
John Gunn is something of
a genius in taxation matters,
and, apart from his Common-

Testing at Puri
[From L. Owen]
A letter from New Zealand
asks:
I should be very grateful if you
would briefly explain to me in plain
English (that is, not technical
language) how Australasian Petro-
leum Co. could drill the Puri bore to
10,000 ft. and then, three months,
later, come back to about 7500 ft.
and discover oil.
In the earlier part of this
century, before the percussion
method of drilling oilwells had
been ousted by the now pre-
ponderant rotary technique, it
was rare (and sometimes
impossible) to' drill through a
gas-zone, such as that met at
7500 ft. in the Puri well, until
it had exhausted itself. The
rotary drill and modern mud-
doctoring, however, allows
such zones to be penetrated
and sealed-off by casing until
the bore has been sunk to the
desired depth and it is con-
venient to test the upper strata.
This is what occured at Puri,


and it is generally accepted as
good practice.
The original Puri bore passed
through a gas-bearing lime-
stone at the 7500 ft. horizon,
but drilling was not suspended
until 10,100 ft. was reached “in
a thick mudstone series of no
oil-potential interest”. Follow-
ing that, the bottom portion of
the well was plugged and the
gas-bearing zone was tested. It.
produced “wet” gas at the rate
of three-million cu. ft. per day
in addition to 70 barrels of
condensate.
Acidising induced a flow of
light crude-oil at a rate in
excess of a thousand barrels a
“ Back-scratchers ?”
day, but water appeared and
the oil-flow decreased during
a prolonged flow-test. The test
figures were interpreted (quite
logically) as indicating that “on
continuous production, this
particular hole would produce
comparatively small quantities
of oil.”
Furthermore, the tests
showed that the gas and oil
occurred in a porous lenticle of
relatively restricted extent. For
this, and other, reasons it was
decided (in my opinion, quite
correctly) that further tests of
the gas/oil-bearing zone should
be made at other points. Owing
to the very difficult nature of
the terrain around Puri, it was
found more economical to drill
deviated (inclined) holes with-
out shifting the rig. In this way,
two essentially independent
tests (1A and IB) were made.
Both of them penetrated the
limestone at points several
hundreds of feet (horizontally)
distant from the original hole.
Unfortunately, an unforesee-
able lack of porosity was
encountered at these points and
no production resulted.
It may be some consolation
to reiterate the opinion, often
expressed in these pages, that
the Puri location is at the
extreme eastern limit of a
potential oil-belt. This fact
should be borne in mind when
the results of the test of the
1980ft./1996ft. zone —announ-
ced in a press-release dated
September B—are8 —are known.
The well now drilling at
Bwata offers great interest and
promise. Expectations should
be tempered, however, by the
fact that the Puri oil had
obviously migrated from a con-
siderable depth and that —as m
most areas in Australia and
the adjacent islands —Cre-
taceous and younger structures
have little relationship,
normally, to those occurring at
depth.
Money Management
[From JL.on>ionJ
“The aura of magic and
mystery which harmfully and need-
lessly has surrounded monetary
matters in Britain should at least
be broken down”... .“The best
textbook on Britain’s financial
mechanism and probably the only
one comprehensible to the lay-
man.” — “Economist.”
“The quality of public debate
should be greatly improved by the
way the committee has raised and
argued almost every question of
financial management, but not
everyone will find it easy to
believe that we have by and large
the best financial system the
country could wish for.” —
“Guardian.”
“The value of this report lies
in its insistence on clear principles,
open minds, and adequate infor-
mation. Its influence will be much
greater than it would have been
if the committee had wasted its
strength on a hunt for panaceas.”
—“Financial Times.”
“The committee have produced
a first-rate study of their subject,
with many important positive
recommendations large and small.
Much of the Teport breaks ground
that will be new for many or even
most members of Parliament.” —
“Times.”
the Radcliffe Report on
the Working of the Mone-
tary System has been well
received is clear from the
above representative quota-
tions. The great importance
of the event is not so much
the committee’s findings as the
shaking-up the report has
given to our financial think-
ing.
It rejects 19th-century habits
of high-priesthood, financial
establishment and hush-hush
ritualism in favor of 20th-
century, on-the-toes awareness.
The keynote of the recommen-
dations is one of political
direction. “Political” is not,
perhaps, a well-chosen word
(although there is no satisfac-
tory alternative). The implica-
tion is that the broad decisions
in our monetary management
should not be allowed to rest
with a clique of experts but,
like other forms of govern-
ment, should be made objec-
tively at a higher level and
integrated with general policy.
Except for the discount-
market’s predilection for
restrictive practices, the City
institutions have come out
fairly well. Here the note is
realistic, for it is recognised
that there is little possibility
of change in their structure.
On the other hand, the com-
mittee (who experienced great
difficulty in getting informa-
tion) found much to criticise
in the working of the Bank
of England, complaining of its
failure to give information or
to publish proper returns and
of its quite inadequate research-
organisation.
This lack of information
and study generally is, with
the premise that economic
policy has to serve complex
and conflicting aims, the chief
substance of the report.
Monetary measures by them-
selves are not enough, it says.
The Government must apply a
mixture of monetary, fiscal and
physical controls.
Liquidity (i.e., the facility
with which assets are convert-
ible into money) is of greater
significance than interest-rates.
The operation described as
“management of the national
debt” is the most effective way
of influencing interest-rates.
Longer - term interest - rates
should be deliberately manipu-
lated and should stay high.
When rapid inflation threatens,
capital-issues, bank-advances,
consumer-credit and Govern-
ment expenditure should be
severely checked.
Britain needs a larger
reserve. The Commonwealth
countries should be encour-
aged to raise capital outside
the United Kingdom, and, “if
it is so important that the U.K.
should remain a major source
of capital for the Common-
wealth, and if it has itself so
much need of capital that it
cannot sustain sufficient invest-
ment overseas without injury
to its own economic develop-
ment, there is a case for
borrowing abroad.” (This
sentence follows' an acknow-
ledgment that Commonwealth
countries have, in fact,
borrowed more from abroad
than from Britain.)
Other points mentioned are:
Alterations in Bank-rate
should come direct from the
Chaacellor of the Exchequer,
and a standing-committee
under his chairmanship should
be set-up to advise on mone-
tary policy.
Local authorities should
borrow from the Government
and not in the open market.
Hire-purchase finance-houses
should be singled out for
special treatment only in
special circumstances.
The Post Office should con-
sider adopting the “giro”
system of simple transfers.
“Credit-squeezes” and simi-
lar restrictions should not be
applied to the banks alone.
Building - societies, industrial
bankers, insurance companies
and investment-trusts should
also be subjected to liquidity
controls and all of them should
supply information.
An Industrial Guarantee
Corporation should be created
to find risk capital for the
exploitation of new inventions.


SUNDRY
SHOWS
Artbursts
Matson Exhibition
It is always a pleasure to
see a minor masterpiece in the
course of a morning’s work,
and there is one at least in the
Matson Line Exhibition at
Farmer’s Blaxland Galleries,
Sydney: and that one is Hans
Heysen’s “The White Gums.”
This is a modest little water-
color. It would never dream
of shrieking for attention. It
says no more than that white-
gums, with a modulation of
delicate greys and greens of
foliage and grass, rhyme
prettily with a white cloud;
but it says this so charmingly,
so sensitively, with such finesse
both of observation and tech-
nique that anybody who knows
a Cotman or a Peter de Wint
would never hesitate to put it
in their company.
For the rest, because of
omissions and mistakes, it
seems to this commentator
rather a weak exhibition to
send to America. Nevertheless,
on the traditional side it gets
some strength from a very well-
painted nude by Norman
Lindsay; Howard Ashton’s
ragged earth and Will Ashton’s
sunlit snow, both capably done;
Robert Johnson and James R.
Jackson rather above their
average ; Dargie with more
feeling than usual in a portrait
of a woman ; G. K. Towns-
hend with a striking water-
color one has seen before, and
Lance Solomon sensitive as
ever in a minor landscape.
On the artistic left-wing—
what one chiefly misses here is
some of the lively Australiana-
painters from Melbourne —
there are Jean Appleton’s
nervously active “River Land-
scape” ; a very firm design by
Thomas Gleghorn in “Burn-
ing Leaves” ; Robert Grieve’s
decorative reinterpretation of
Monet; James Gleeson’s
curious researches in interior
anatomy; Frank Hodgkinson
forceful with an abstract “Time
in the Desert”; and Margo
Lewers vividly burning some
buildings.
Except for Namatjira’s con-
tribution (a print) the Arunta
tribesmen, represented by a
panel of six watercolors, are
getting very rococo.

The Murdoch Prize
Of the 44 entries for the £2OO
prize donated by Rupert
Murdoch as an annual award
and shown., at the Skinner
Galleries (Perth), 26 came from
other States.
Thomas Gleghorn took the
award eastward with a large
and impressive “Industrial
Harbor.” An abstract in the
truest sense, it suggested two
theatre-flats filled with
mysterious 'shadows, with a
window in one overlooking a
gaggle of gantries. Splendidly
painted, cold colors predomina-
ting, it was a distinguished and
challenging composition.
The additional £5O prize for
the best W.A. work went to
Guy Grey-Smith for a pinky-
yellow version of “Lake Grace”
seen as a pale matt-surface
behind stark tree-stems ; except
for its coloring, rather like a
pattern for a glass panel.
John Perceval sent a lively
and exciting bevy of black
swans battling with choppy
water. Louis Kahan’s “Portrait
of Sali” —beautifully finished
and subtle —added interest to
Sali Herman’s own houses at
“Victoria Street, Potts Pt.”;
Maximilian Feurring showed
a satisfying “Still Life.”
Kenneth Hood was more
specific with “Coastal Still Life”
in the muted colors of sand-
dune bits and pieces. Clifton
Pugh added a charming “Land-
scape,” but his portrait piece
was not so effective. Len
Annois’s “View of Heidelberg”
and “Semaphore Station, S.A.”
were both very pleasant,
painted with subdued yet clear
colors, and J. Carington Smith’s
conventional “North Wind on
the Derwent” successfully
solved a problem of sunlight
and waves.
F. Korwill’s watercolor of
“River Flats” was well painted
with a full rich brush, and
Jean Johnson sent a “Stormy
Evening” glimpsed on some
suburban street, the corner pub
invested with that extra-
ordinary elegance she imparts,
without romanticising, to the
most everyday objects. Indian
painter Gamini Warnesuriya
evinced a more polished and
stylised elegance in his
“Ceylonese Dancers.”

Cedric Flower
Cedric Flower’s watercolors
at Sydney’s Macquarie
Galleries fall neatly into two
classes: the spidery, humorous
scenes of Sydney Harbor, with
ferries chugging along like
rocking-chairs, or lifesavers
bouncing up and down beaches
brandishing colored flags ;
and the charming rows of
terrace-houses, painted in
Italian-icecream colors, with
exactly pencilled iron loops and
railings.
. The Harbor and lifesaver
stuff is deliberately childlike,
uncomplicated and light in
effect, and paintings like “Surf
Carnival” and “Ferry Boat”
would look very nice in a
nursery or in an overseas
travel-office. But his tenements
are charming in their delicacy
and clean color, and, particu-
larly in “Sydney Lace,” where
you get walls as well as build-
ings, Flower shows how attrac-
tive these tenements could look
in real life. “Victorian Town
Houses” and “Terrace With
Coral Tree” are equally attrac-
tive.

Stanislaus Rapotec
In his show of abstracts at
Sydney’s Clune Galleries,
Stanislaus Rapotec covers the
walls and invades the corridor
with, in general, large, uneasily
swirling masses of color.
Several show enough skill and
purpose to make amends for the
frankly experimental ones.
“Tension No. 36” is a huge,
striking oil, based on blue
tonings, with vivid blue zig-
zags (suggesting, maybe, light-
ning ; at any rate, energy of
some kind) and decorative
burnt-orange shapes in the
background. “Composition in
Green” is pleasant in an inky
sort of way, and “Disturbance,”
despite the title, is relatively
cool in its muted blacks and
blues, notwithstanding an
agitated bunch of lines jump-
ing all over the place. *
Stage and Music
“Sun” Aria Contest
Even those who like taking
pot-shots at adjudicators could
scarcely have failed to
welcome the decision of Dr.
Karl Rankl and Arnold
Matters in the finals of the
vocal section of Sydney’s big
eisteddfod at the Town Hall
last Saturday night.
In “The Jewel Song” from
“Faust” and “Und ob die
Wolke” from Weber’s “Der
Freischutz,” Sydney lyric-
soprano Elaine Blight piled-up
enough points in every depart-
ment to make her a clear
winner. Her voice is of rich
timbre, effortlessly produced
and always under tight control.
Her intelligence was apparent
in her refusal to attempt to
push her musicianship beyond
its present confines and in her
manner of extracting full
dramatic weight from each
aria.
The runner-up, Mary Hay-
man, has a big dramatic-
soprano which can reach down
without strain into quite a low
chest-register. “Strong in all
sections but one —a failure to
give her voice sufficient color-
range—she sang an aria from
Weber’s “Oberon” with telling
authority ; but in the extended
aria from “Turandot” her sing-
ing tended to monotony.
Third place went—rather
luckily, it seemed —to Gino
Zancanaro, whose lyric-tenor,
pleasant but not distinctive in
quality, was used with style
and discretion in arias from
“Ernani” and “Andre Chenier.”
❖ ❖
Franquin
Franquin, who has lost his
beard but none of his powers,
is back at Sydney Empire. You
can see the reason for his bil-
ling—“ The Inter-nation Sensa-
tion” —when you observe the
ease with which he sends his
subjects to different parts of
the world, and even on an
interplanetary trip.
He tells them to “mind the
slippery part of the floor,”
and they slip beautifully. He
gets them individually and
says: “Haven’t I seen you
before?” “No, I don’t think
so,” says the victim, where-
upon Franquin hypnotises him
(one is a little vague about
details, but the hypnotist seems
to brush his subject’s temple
with his hand) and suggests he
is a boxer and that he was last
seen at the Stadium. Away the
chap goes, dancing around and
sparring with shadows.
Franquin suggested to a
stovepipe hero with a tremen-
dous watch-chain that he was
a quick-drawing cowboy and
a chainsmoker as well; and
it was worth going just to see
this character smoking the
chain and every so often ashing
it delicately.

“Arms and the Man”
The new-look Union Theatre
Repertory Company (now
closely associated with the Aus-
tralian Elizabethan Trust
following last year’s financial
troubles) has chosen “Arms and
the Man” for its second pro-
duction of the current season.
Shaw couldn’t have written
a more innocuous comedy if
he had tried. As producer
John Sumner says in a fore-
word : “Shaw’s works are still
extremely popular. The
reasons for this are simple:
among them he provides a
good story and excitement for
the audience and good acting-
roles for the cast.” What more
could a producer want? But
one wonders how many times
Shaw would turn in his coffin
if he could read such a state-
ment.
Nonetheless, “Arms and the
Man,” despite the almost total
absence of argument and
instruction, is still a very enter-
tainingly-put-together comedy,
full of jokes, mild satire and
farcical situations, and on this
occasion handsomely turned-
out by Mr. Sumner, without a
weakness in the cast.
Dorothy Bradley succeeded
brilliantly as Raina, the daugh-
ter of the Petroff household
who eventually becomes
betrothed to the hero, Captain
Bluntschli, to which role
whimsical realist Frank Gatliff
brought a near-perfect balance
of warmth and scepticism.
However, it needed scene-
stealing Frank Thring, a
grotesquely pompous clown of
a figure as Major Sergius
Saranoff, to bring the house
properly down.

Alma Trio in Brisbane
Brisbane Musica Viva,
forced out of its usual hall by
a double booking, has by this
accident found an ideal home
in the rooftop restaurant of
the local David Jones’- shop.
In the setting that houses tea-
parties during the day the trio
from the U.S. played in what
must have been a musicians’
delight.
Only a few street-noises
floated-up from below to cut
through the Mozart, Ravel and
Brahms trios that formed the
main musical fare, and the
pannelled walls, leather chairs
and soft carpeting created a
delightful atmosphere for this
kind of music.
There is something rather
feminine about the name
“Alma” which made us totally
unprepared for the strong
masculine tone that emerged
from these three strongly
individual musicians. Every
successful piano - and - violin
recital is a triumph over the
none-too-compatible sounds of
these two instruments, but
when the' deeper note of the
"Too hot ?”
’cello strikes in, the strings
can easily balance the percus-
siveness of the piano.
These men obviously have
ensemble-playing in their, souls,
Violinist Maurice Wilk was in
Toscanini’s N.B.C. Orchestra,
and pianist Adolf Bailer and
’cellist Gabor Rejto are equally
experienced in the art of mak-
ing several men play as one.

Alma’s Sydney Farewell
Last Saturday night, at
Sydney Con., the Alma Trio
gave a special all-Beethoven
concert. The Kreutzer Sonata
for violin and piano (A Major,
Op. 47) was the big work of
the night; and it was done
with concentrated care and
musicianship. It was preceded
by the cheery Sonata in A for
’cello and piano; and in both
these works pianist Adolph
Bailer confirmed one’s pre-
vious opinion that he is an out-
standing chamber-music per-
former. Maurice Wilk’s solo
violin in the Kreutzer was
wonderfully supple, and if
none of the playing ever
reached the lonely heights of
virtuosity it had a great deal
of warmth and strength.
“The Crucible”
Arthur Miller is by tempera-
ment a profoundly pessimistic
man. Yet in the 1930’s he was
persuaded to accept the creed
of those who promise a great
future for mankind.
Arthur Miller is also a very
confused man. He finds human
persecution and cruelty out-
rageous, and yet is so puzzled
by it that in his plays he makes
shallow and embarrassing
attempts to explain it. What
he is supremely good at is
exa m i ning treachery and
failure. This helps to explain
both the strengths and the
weaknesses of “The Crucible.”
He is good at showing how
treacherous and cruel human-
beings are to each other; and
how no one helps the man
who is down. But, of course,
as a modern man he had to
weave-in something good about
man. So, just at the point
where he was uncovering the
full horror of the human situ-
ation, he wobbled and began
to talk like dehydrated Soviet
Man.
Canberra Repertory’s per-
formance of this play made the
most of what Miller had to
offer. Graeme Hughes, as the
clergyman who began as a
clerical pedant but ended as a
sort of Soviet Man in Holy
Orders, was excellent, and at
times deeply moving on the
human situation. So were
Jocelyn Juliffe as Goody
Proctor, and John Garran as
one of those judges whom
modern man sees as his tor-
mentor.
The hand of Ric Throssell
could be seen in the extremely
high quality of the production.
Indeed, actors and producer
had between them the sense of
mystery and the power to
move, but a pessimist such as
Miller cannot move people
when he trots-out that credo
from the men of the Enlighten-
ment.

“The Golden Door”
Produced by Owen Weingotf
at Sydney Independent, Sylvia
Regan’s “The Golden Door”
is described as “a Jewish
comedy-drama,” and, if its full
flavor were brought out, it
would have much the same
effect as Judah Waten’s early
short-stories of Jewish life in
Australia.
All the characters are
Russian Jews ; the whole thing
depends on their Russian-
Jewish mannerisms and inten-
sities ; but, since very few of
the players are Russian Jews
or are able convincingly to
simulate them, the production
misses a lot.
Nevertheless there is much
goodwill in it, and it is sus-
tained partly by the surprising
developments of the plot —•
since it is an episodic family-
saga anything can happen: a
factory on fire one moment, a
baby practically born on
stage the next, a world-war the
moment afterwards —and more
legitimately by the actors, who,
like Gustl Korner and others,
if they don’t look much like
Russian Jews, still portray
living characters ; and, chiefly,
by Olive Walter, who, in the
central role of the mother,
never falters either in feeling or
the feeling of foreignness.
Especially in his opening
scenes, George Kassianos was
another who .conveyed the
right flavor.

once again reported an increase (46 p.c.)
in its overseas sales, particularly in New
Zealand.
Simultaneously, the co. was busily
extending its contacts and know-how,
concluding three new important overseas
agreements entered into during the last
twelve months.
A contract was signed with the West
German firm of Fichtel and Sachs,
under which it will make clutches for
Volkswagens and other vehicles. The
other two agreements were with Bendix
Aviation Corp. of U.S. (brake-assemblies
and power-braking equipment) and with
Coventry Tool and Gauge Co., U.K., for
the acquisition of a 60 p.c. interest in
Coventry’s Australian subsidiary.
The co.’s numerous subsidiaries are
divided into seven main groups. There is
the manufacturing group (Russell Manu-
facturing Co. Pty.; Brico Manufacturing
Co. Pty.; Repco Bearing Co. Pty. and
A. T. Richardson and Sons Pty.); the
brake group [Patons Brake Replace-
ments Pty. and the co.’s East Bentleigh
(Vic.) factory, with its trade-service
division]; the transmission group [Repco
Universal Joints Pty.., Ltd.; Hardy Spicer
(Aust.) Pty.; Specialised Engineering Co.
Pty.] and the garage-equipment and
precision-tool group (Warren and Brown
Pty.; Repco Automotive Euipment Co.
Pty.; Replex Pty.).
The other three groups are merchan-
dising and automotive engineering
[Replacement Parts Pty.; Replacement
Parts (Tas.) Pty.; Auto Grinding Co.
Pty.]; industrial service (Brenco Pty.) and
research (Repco Research Pty.).
Associate cos., owned jointly by Repco
and its British partners, are Kirkstall-
Repco Pty.; Payen, Byrne and Blackford
Pty.; Super Seals Pty.; and Associated
Engineering (N.Z.), Ltd.
Repco is continuing its ambitious take-
over campaign, making aggressive bids
whenever a likely opportunity turns up.
In the first 10 weeks of the current
term the co. has swallowed-up Hipsleys,
Ltd. (one ss. Repco ord. for three ss.
Hipsleys ords. and 20s. cash for each
Hipsleys 20s. pref.); Motor Supplies,
Ltd. (seven Repcos for every one Motor
Supplies 20s. ord.); and W. T. Wood
(Holdings), Ltd. (five Repcos for six
W. T. Wood ss. ords., plus 3d. a share
cash, and 20s. 6d. cash for every 20s.
Pi-ff.)-
In addition, there was an offer of one
Repco share for every two ss. ords. in
Smith Sons and Rees, Ltd. (and 20s. cash
for each 20s. pref.), as well as an offer
(terms undisclosed) to the P. J. Taylor
group. The last two bids are not yet
finalised.
Brisk business conditions in the auto-
motive industry, together with an opti-
mistic appraisal of the future in spite of
the foundering of the widespread hopes
for sales-tax relief, are reflected in the
co.’s trading results and capital-structure.
The trading profit of Repco’s wholly-
owned subsidiaries (excluding the
holding-co. figures) for the year ended
June 30, 1959, was £1,097,574 before
tax. This was an increase of £116,641,
or about 12 p.c., compared with the
preceding term.
The total consolidated net profit for
the year was £673,286 (up £41,822),
equivalent to an earning-rate of 14.3 p.c.
on capital:

p.c. (1955) and 16.7 p.c. (1954), looking
backwards over the preceding five years.
The consolidated net profit includes
£20,933 earned from investments, and was
struck after providing a solid £300,000
(up £14,222) for depreciation on fixed
assets, paying £7043 interest on borrow-
ings, £4766 directors’ fees and £9241
auditors’ fees.
Taxation took £427,281 (up £49,750),
roughly corresponding to the current
rates. Dividend was steady at 10 p.c.,
absorbing £469,948.
The consolidated balance-sheet sug-
gests that the year under review was a
period of confident consolidation, aided
by the biggest profit earned yet, follow-
ing upon a phase of rapid expansion of
capital and business:

Paid capital remained unchanged at
£4,699,481, split into 18,797,922 ss.
ords., with a net tangible backing of
6s. Bd. each.
The major balance-sheet movements
were: a reduction in bank accommoda-
tion by £610,599 to £594,952 and a new
£500,000 private loan from a limited
number of lenders, for which 1\ p.c.
registered unsecured notes (with a 10-
years currency) were issued. Repco has
also entered into an agreement with
Colonial Mutual Life to borrow
£400,000 against mortgage of freehold
properties over three years. Of this,
£200,000 was received during • the last
year. The balance will come in two
£lOO,OOO instalments in January, 1960,
and 1961.
Total visible capital expenditure during
the year amounted to £531,350.
Repco’s ss. ords. are selling for 14s. 3d.
Following the one-for-two bonus hand-
out in 1958, an increase in the dividend-
rate beyond the current 10 p.c. is
unlikely in the near future unless the
co.’s policy of heavy profits-ploughback
and takeovers is modified. Earnings
have been increasing rapidly over the
last few years, but have been matched by
the mounting share-capital and a heavy
expansion expenditure.
The high premium paid for the shares
is an indication of the growing public
demand for dynamic-growth stocks with
a wide safety-margin. With the yield-
income of 3.5 p.c. on the basis of a
steady 10 p.c. div., it is also a tribute to

Perpetual Trustee Co., Ltd.
"jVTow the biggest trustee co. of its kind
in the Southern Hemisphere, Per-
petual was registered in Sydney in 1885,
originally as the Perpetual Trustee,
Executor and Agency Co. The name
was afterwards changed to the present
style by a special Act of Parliament.
Slowly but steadily growing, in spite
of the handicap of Australia’s creeping
inflation (which was galloping only 10
years ago), the Perpetual saw its trust
funds increase by £24,219,621 to
£97,823,395 in the seven years since
1952:

1959 . . 97,823,395 428,360 400,783 93.6
Results for the year ended June 30,
1959, show that receipts and expenses
increased in about the same proportion
to each other as in the preceding period.
Revenue was up by a healthy £19,365
at £428,360, but expenses had also in-
creased by £18,094 to £400,783. The
ratio of expenses to income was almost
steady at 93.6 p.c.
The earnings of trustee-cos. are
derived from two main sources: corpus
and other commissions (such as on the
collection of rents and other estate in-
comes), and returns from funds owned
by the co. itself. Distribution of Per-
petual’s investments is shown in the

The most important movement on the
liabilities side was a £18,156 rise in
creditors and provisions, now at £82,678.
The bulk of this increase was due to a
further increase in- the amount set aside
towards the cost of building-alterations,
as well as additional provision for tax-
ation, both undisclosed.
On the other hand, the book-value
of premises was £9912 higher at £339,693,
and mortgages and shares increased by
£18,278 to £203,940.
Accounts and profits are shown for
the parent only. However, the small but
active Canberra offshoot, Perpetual
Trustee Co. (Canberra) Ltd., was said to
be doing well, administering trust-funds
of almost million. Perpetual (Can-
berra) provides in A.C.T. the same
services which are available through the
parent in Sydney. In addition, it is
equipped to act for corporations desir-
ing registration in Canberra or wishing
to maintain a branch-register in the
Capital Territory. At present the co. is
acting as share-registrar, or registered
office, for 39 public and 133 private
cos., and these appointments are increas-
ing at a satisfactory rate.
Net earnings for the past year were
£27,493 (up £3287), and equal to 13.7
p.c. on the paid-up capital of £200,000:

The profit was struck after providing an
undisclosed amount for taxation and
paring-down the corpus-commission
reserve by £B4. Last year’s earning-rate
was the highest in eight years, favorably
comparing with 12.1 p.c., 9.5 p.c., 10.9
p.c., 12.1 p.c., 9.6 p.c., 5.2 p.c. and 0.3
p.c. back to 1952.
The div.-rate showed a small, but
encouraging, \ p.c. increase to p.c.,
absorbing an additional £lOOO at £21,000.
As in 1957-58, £2,000 was transferred to
the staff fund. Reserves benefited by
£6493, bringing the total up to £516,593
(a net rise of £4493).
Funds held as custodian trustee for
unit-trusts reached £17,828,827, equiva-
lent to 18.2 p.c. of the total trust funds
(£97,823,395) administered by the co.
Following its policy of investing a
substantial portion of the estates admini-
stered in company shares, whenever the
will or trust-deed permits, Perpetual
has placed 62.5 p.c. of its trust funds into
the sharemarket. Another 15.5 p.c. are
invested in Government paper and 11.9
p.c. in real-estate. The balance has been
placed in mortgages, bank deposits, etc.
A feature of Perpetual’s attractively
presented accounts and reports is the
co.’s own strength and solidity.
The sharemarket confidently sets 945.
as the current value of Perpetual’s £2-
paid shares. The £8 uncalled liability
includes £5 which is callable only in the
event of the co.’s liquidation.
Yield is almost 4.5 p.c. on the basis
of 10i p.c. dividend. Net tangible cover
works-out at 71s. 7d. for each 20s. of
paid-up capital.
The co.’s articles restrict maximum
holding by any one person to 2000
shares.
Ready Mixed Concrete, Ltd.
T>RODUction of ready-mixed concrete
A has increased phenomenally over
recent years. Total Australian output-
all sources —rose from 269,000 cubic
yards in 1948.-49 to 1,240,000 cubic
yards in 1956-57. Until 1939, when
Ready Mixed Concrete, Ltd., com-
menced operations in Sydney, the in-
dustry had been non-existent in Aus-
tralia. But ready-mixed concrete has
been a feature of construction in the
United States for over 30 years.
The new method of concreting has
now become an integral part of all
building-activity. The concrete, which is
mixed at central depots, is transported
to points of utilisation in road-vehicles
which incorporate agitating-machinery
to keep the mixture in proper condition.
Today the building-industry evidences a
marked revival, with prospects bright
for further expansion. Industrial and
commercial building has become an im-
portant factor, and home-building has
recovered from the decline, which it
suffered in 1956 and 1957. Everything
points to an increasing demand for
ready-mixed concrete, and R.M.C.’s
record, in the past vouchsafes its ability
to both contribute to and benefit there-
from.
Since its inception, R.M.C. has dis-
played a tenacity bristling with growth-
potential. Steady progress was main-
tained throughout the war years despite
the then very severe building recession,
and in the post-war period, although
handicapped by shortages of cement,
power, labor and equipment, the co.
did not fail once to make satisfactory
profits. With the subsequent recovery
of the Australian economy, R.M.C. can
look back now from its powerfully en-
trenched position on almost a decade of
prodigious growth.
In 1945, R.M.C. became a holding-co.
Its activities had by then spread through-
out the Commonwealth and subsidiary
operating cos. were formed in each of
the States. Operations were extended
to the U.K. in 1952 and performances
in that quarter have been extremely
creditable. It is confidently expected
that there will be improvement and that
scope for further profitable expansion
is wide. In addition, associations have
been developed in England with certain
large industrial groups where a com-
bination of interests is indicated to be
of mutual benefit. Soon after initiation
of the U.K. venture, a portable plant
was set-up at Dusseldorf, West Germany,
in. association with local German in-
terests, and last year installations were
effected at Wuppertal and Mannheim.
The German market possesses excellent
potential, and the industry is gaining

ground rapidly. Profits so far
have been good.
In 1954 the co. entered into
partnership with U.S. and
Brazilian interests, and opera-
tions were commenced in Rio
de Janeiro. Expansion has
'been considerable, and last
term saw Porto Alegre added
to the co.’s widening horizon.
The main problem in Brazil is
inflation, but such is the nature
•of the co.’s business that
selling-prices advance with the
declining purchasing-power of
fhoney, and there is no
restriction upon transfer of
funds.
The Singapore branch was
closed last year. It kicked-off
an 1955 with seemingly bright
prospects, but recent political
■events have been against it.
No loss was sustained.
■ Sales on home and overseas
markets continued to improve
last term, and group earnings
responded accordingly, the
consolidated pre - tax profit
rising by 35 p.c. to £746,060

£44,456) for depreciation. Pro-

Net profit was more than 25
p.c. higher than the previous
year’s £329,618, and nearly
double the figure for 1956
(£235,295). The earning-rate
on capital was 29.8 p.c., as
compared with 23.5 p.c., 22.9
p.c., 22.7 p.c. back to 1956
and 5.7 p.c. in 1949. The div.-
rate was raised from 10 p.c.
to 12£ p.c., and retained
earnings boosted reserves by
£217,341 to £1,005,017. Direc-
tors consider this figure ade-
quate, but necessary in view
of the co.’s direct association
with the building industry and
its consequent susceptibility to
fluctuations within that in-
dustry. Provision (£24,273)
has been made for U.K. taxa-
tion for depreciation-equalisa-
tion on account of high rates
of depreciation allowable by
the British Treasury in the first
year of purchase of certain
fixed assets.
The group’s activities in
Australia present a well-
integrated dynamism. Perman-
ent mixing-works are located
in all the mainland State capi-
tals as well as Canberra,
Geelong (Vic.) and the Queens-
land centres of Toowoomba
and Townsville. During the
past year seven new plants
were completed, and are now
operating. Good markets have
been found in less populated
areas, and portable units are
in course of construction in
order to serve these markets.
All the cos. comprising the
group have made substantial
profits and have contributed
handsomely to total income.
Last year the book-value of
fixed assets and investments in
other cos. (Australia and over-
seas, including Germany and
Brazil) rose by £567,268 to
£2,209,464 and £563,789 respec-
tively—previously the two
items had been shown collec-
tively under fixed assets.
R.M.C.’s balance-sheet is a
standing tribute to the
organisation’s growth and
strength, but indicates an inter-
esting tightness in liquidity:

The co. is light on working-
capital, suggesting the possi-
bility that shareholders may be
asked for more in due course.
If past methods of raising
funds are any indication,
shareholders can look forward
to a par-entitlement in the
future. In 1951 paid capital
was trebled by a par issue,
and this was followed by
similar issues in 1955 (one-for-
three) and 1956 (one-for-four).
Theoretical working - capital
fell by £349,929 last term
(previously £295,467). Book-
debts rose £504,976 to
£1,465,923, but cash declined
£262,098 to £39,074 and credi-
tors and tax provision were
both heavier at £1,055,801 (up
£425,522) and £54,983 (up
£138,010). There was little
movement in stock on hand.
Convertible loan stock,
£313,750 at 1\ p.c., was taken-
out by the U.K. subsidiary in
1958. The moneys-were used
to finance certain expansion
projects.

Carrier Air Conditioning
(Holdings), Ltd’.
"P stablished in 1932 to
manufacture and distri-
bute in Australia and New
Zealand air-conditioning and
other equipment under licence
from Carrier Corp. of U.S.A.,
the co., with its modern fac-
tories, is well situated to take
advantage of the accelerated
Australian demand for air-
conditioning apparatus.
The main production-centre
is at Seven Hills, near Sydney.
Branch-factories in Melbourne,
Adelaide and Brisbane assist in
serving growing markets
throughout Australia and in
New Guinea.
Carrier’s air - conditioning
equipment comprises a wide
range of refrigeration-com-
pressors, condensers, self-con-
tained space and room air-
conditioning units, cooling and
heating coils and fans. Its
products are used in railway-
cars, ships, hospitals, restau-
rants, retail and department
stores, office-blocks, hotels,
theatres, factories, mines and
homes. The co. contracts
for installation and provides
the maintenance service. Close
contact is kept with
Carrier Corporation of U.S.A.
and its research and develop-
ment facilities.
The holding-co. [Carrier Air
Conditioning (Holdings), Ltd.]
was incorporated on May 21,
1958. The shareholders in the
old co. received 20 f.-p. ss.
holding-co. ords. for every
three 20s. ords. held, with the
effect of a virtual two-for-three
bonus-issue.
Par issues in 1955 (one-for-
two) and 1956 (one-for-one)
had raised the operating-co.’s
equity capital from £175,000 to
£535,000 (the £50,000 of 54
p.c. prefs was converted into
7 p.c. notes in 1955). Follow-
ing the capital-reconstruction,
Carrier Air Conditioning
(Holdings), Ltd., started-off
with a paid-up capital of
£891,668.
From 1955 to 1957 inclusive
the co. had paid interim and
final dividends of 5 p.c. each,
plus a 24 p.c. bonus, making
124 p.c. for the year. In 1958
a steady interim of 5 p.c. was
paid on the old capital, plus a
final of 74 p.c. on npw capital
(equivalent to 174 p.c.' for the
year on pre-reconstruction paid-
up capital).
Over the last five years the
co. has shown a high earning-
power reflecting the rapidly
expanding demand for its pro-
ducts, connected with growth
in the building industry.
The earning-rates on paid
capital were 46 p.c. (1958), 29.2
p.c., 31 p.c., 31.9 p.c and
29.1 p.c. respectively back to
1954.
The spectacular earning-rate
in 1958 must be considered in
the light of the co.’s accounting
policy, under which no profit
is taken into account on any
contract before its completion.
As Carrier had finalised' a
number of large jobs in 1957-
58, profits from work actually
done in previous years fattened-
up the profit-figures.
Consolidated trading profit
for the year ended June 30,
1959, was £39,921 smaller at
£329 v ,264. Depreciation took
£46,815 (up £13,367, as com-
pared to 1958 parent provision),
employees’ bonuses £33,956,
and directors’ fees £3200.
Taxation provision was
shown at £131,898 (down
£58,898). (Tax-provision for the
preceding term seemed con-
siderably in excess of the ruling
rates). Net profit after tax was
disclosed at £197,366:

Last year’s accounts do not
show separate operating-co. s
figures, making balance-sheet
comparisons less effective. The
most significant movements
were the appearance of bank
overdraft at £59,869 and the
stock swelling-up by £379,562
to £588,156. This can be ex-
plained by a rise in the volume
of work-in-progress on un-
completed contracts. Debtors,
prepayments, cash and short-
term market investments
showed a decline.
Current ratio at June 30,
1959 was 1.8:1. The net
tangible assets backing works-
out at ss. 9d. a ss. ord.
Consistently good earning-
rates, capital-gains to share-
holders on the co.’s reconstruc-
tion, and a steady 124 p.c. div.-
rate, coupled with hopes for
further expansion based on
bright market prospects, have
pushed-up Carrier’s ss. scrip to
19s. 7|d. a unit. The yield is
3.2 p.c.
Lower Yields?
[From London]
T>rofessor of Economics at
-*■ Swansea, E. Victor
Morgan, writing in the “Three
Banks Review,” affirms that
gilt-edged yields (around 5 p.c.
for the past three years) may
have to fall if our economic
resources are to be fully used
during the 1960*5. There are,
he says, obvious advantages
in lower yields as a fillip to
recovery from the recent reces-
sion, in stimulating some
kinds of investment (e.g.,
housing) and as a healthy
psychological effect on business
and on equity markets.
Why, then, haven’t they
come down? Not only because
of inflation and funding, but
also as a result of great changes
in the size and function of the
national debt due to changes
in the structure of property-
ownership. Professor Morgan
explains, at some length, the
extent of these changes. The
essence of his argument is that
“in order to meet the growth
of the public debt relative to
other forms of property, it has
been necessary to get Govern-
ment securities into the hands
of persons and institutions
which would not have thought
of holding them fifty years
ago.”
Thus small-savings securities
on favorable terms and inten-
sively advertised directly
account for £3OOO-million of
the U.K. national debt, and a
similar sum is held by the
savings-banks. Other factors
keeping the rate high are the
very large sales by the banks,
the issue of short- and medium-
dated stock and the movement
into equities by insurance com-
panies and pension funds.
The dilemma, as Professor
Morgan sees it, is the difficulty
of reducing gilt-edge rates with-
out the consequent rise in
liquidity which encourages
spending and evades fiscal
control. He suggests that, in
order to keep the debt down,
the nationalised industries
should borrow in the market
(not on favorable terms) and
considers that, at a time like
the present, a reduction in
rates would be worth gaining
even at the cost of a moderate
increase in liquidity.

From Herbert Holman
'T'he Conservatives remain
A favorites in the election
stakes. Unofficial odds are
3:1 on their being returned,
and the Stock Exchange fore-
cast is a majority of 70 or
more. Prices of steel shares
have acted as barometer,
rising sensationally. (Steel
Company of Wales, which a
year or two ago fell 25 per
cent, below the issue price of
£l, have risen from 20s. 9d. to
355. this year.)
Broadly speaking, the expec-
tation of a third Tory victory
rests on three premises: the
nation’s exceptional prosperity,
the personal standing of the
Prime Minister and the
lamentably poor showing of
the Opposition.
The first is evidenced by the
many people who, attracted by
the extended summer, have
been able to afford second
holidays away from home, and
by the large number (double
that of 1951) of cars on the
roads.
As to the projection of
humility, plus eager good-
mixing, plus unflappability,
plus dignity which the Mac-
millan figure has come to evoke,
this represents a very real
achievement, for it is not his
natural personality as known
in other days. The aloof
clubmanship, the cynical de-
tachment and the ready, biting
wit are no more. A simple
instance, no doubt, of noblesse
oblige. But the press-confer-
ence which launched the Con-
servative manifesto was a
refreshing experience, follow-
ing so quickly after “The
Tory Swindle.” The courtesy,
politeness and freedom from
pettiness on the part of Mr.
Macmillan and his colleagues,
Mr. Butler and Lord Hail-
sham, was excessive and de-
liberate. “The Daily Worker”
representative, for example,
was given a hearing so
deferential that he might have
been a spokesman from the
Federated British Industries.
The Other Cheek
Knowing that underneath
this projection of a leader or
father-figure there is a very
shrewd and determined politi-
cal brain, commentators and
cartoonists have tended to be
rude —Super-Mac., Mr. Mac-
Wonder and so on—but at
least it is a positive gesture.
Now the gloves are off there
is certainly nothing positive
about Labor propaganda.
“The Tory Swindle” is the
depth of bad taste, virulently
besmirching the characters of
leading members of the
Cabinet. It even tries to make
a wicked Tory out of Mr.
Heathcoat Amory.
Many simple-minded voters
have long been puzzled at the
depths of cheapness and cal-
culated nastiness to which
otherwise respectable poli-
ticians can sink, and this ill-
mannered tendency has done
much to lower the regard of
the people for their legisla-
tors. At long last the Con-
servatives seem to have taken
note, although Lord Wool’ton
pointed out the inadvisability
of this approach several years
ago. Dr. Hill is said to be
under a cloud for his egregi-
ous telecast and the fight, as
far as vituperation is con-
cerned, promises to be one-
sided.
Marginal Contingencies
The outcome, nevertheless,
is indefinite, depending upon
'4O marginal constituencies,'
each with a 1955 majority of
less than 1000. If the Tories
uphold their present 54 per
cent, lead, as shown by the
Gallup poll, their majority
could be over 100 seats. The
Labor party needs to win an
extra 35 seats to gain a
majority—and this would be
too small to be comfortable —
but a three per cent, swing to
Labor would give them a
working majority of some 25
seats.
There is, of course, the
unaccountable Liberal vote,
but the tendency among voters
in a general election is to vote
for one or other of the two
main parties, even if they
happen to be Liberally-
inclined.
Another imponderable is the
young people’s vote. They
tend to consider all politicians
as phony, but it is understood
at first-hand from a marginal
constituency in West London
(1955 majority 125) that they
prefer “the devil they know.”
They dislike and distrust trade-
unionism, abhor nationalisa-
tion and are very conscious
of the fact that buying houses
and furniture is much easier
than a year ago.
The same constituency has
seen much slum-clearance and
the re-housing of 5000 people
during the 4} years of the pre-
sent Government. Since more
Socialist voters have left the
district than have come in,
this may well favor the Con-
servative candidate.
High Promise at the Vic.
The Old Vic Company,
assembled for a season of
English classics, includes only
two of last year’s regulars,
many of the newcomers
appearing in Shakspeare for
the first time.
This may have influenced
Wendy Toye (also a newcomer)
to devise a production of “As
You Like It,” which is at
once idiosyncratic, easy-on-
the-eye and untraditional. She
adds characters purely for
effect (e.g., a painted concu-
bine for Duke Frederick), dis-
plays a quite astonishing fer-
tility for “business” of the
slicker kind, sets the play in
a Harrison Ainsworth England
of riding-coats and voluminous
gowns, and altogether makes
of the evening an exercise in
improvisation.
The opening scene provokes
the worst fears. Orlando is
attendant to a very squalid pig-
sty in a very squalid farm-
yard. Adam is a comic yokel
with a Cyrano de Bergerac
nose. Oliver is more gro-
tesquely Transpontine than
any of Mrs. Henry Wood’s
villains. And Charles, the
wrestler, appears track-suited
in a St. Vitus’ Dance of
muscling-up.
Fortunately, the production
has a mental element which
is as delicate as the physical
element is brash. It is the
interpretation of Rosalind,
played with exquisite tender-
ness by Barbara Jefford, which
makes the play appealing and
memorable. No buskined
Prince Charming leading the
hapless Orlando about the
forest, she is a feminine Gany-
mede (more of a Viola than a
Rosalind) who is rather scared
of the whole business. The
mock-wedding scene and the
quartet, “And so am I for —”,
are really poignant and at a
great remove from the one
where Duke Frederick and his
household, in their nighties, are
frantically searching for
Celia.
Other departures are Maggie
Smith’s perky, tinny-voiced
Celia, Judi Dench’s amazingly
natural and youthful Phebe,
Donald Houston’s imprecatory
Jacques and Alec McCowen’s
richly - pointed, sophisticated
Touchstone. John Justin’s
Orlando, beautifully spoken
and truly Shakspearian, seems
rather the odd-man-out.
The same players, without
Miss Jefford but with Ursula
Jeans and Miles Malleson,
posture and flaunt ' uproari-
ously through Congreve’s “The
Double-Dealer.” Their timing
is uncertain, but, no doubt,
will improve with perform-
ance. It is a poor, shapeless
play, and neither producer,
Michael Benthall, nor actors
can make much of the
dialogue, the double-meanings
notwithstanding. But the verve
and the style of the acting
are exhilarating.
Donald Houston, in the
name-part, again “plays against
the line.” His extrovert trans-
parence as Maskwell is Little
Lord Fauntleroy grown up.
Theoretically, his approach is
correct since the other charac-
ters were so given to duplicity
that the only way to deceive
them was to speak the truth!
But this touch of satire was
more intended than realised.
Of the newcomers, two are
from other branches of the
theatre: Maggie Smith from
revue and Australian Moyra
Fraser from ballet and from
revue. Both have excellent
“doubles,” Miss Fraser switch-
ing from conventional gorm-
lessness (Aubrey) to coy and
stylised burlesque (Lady
Froth).
This company, which is
stronger at the beginning of
the season than many have
been at the end, will later be
seen in “The Importance of
Being Earnest,” “Richard II”
and “Saint Joan.”

By
HAL PORTER
We were leaning together on the piano-top with tears in our eyes
and gin-slings in our hands.
You may not remember,
for 1936 is years ago
now, how it was we left
Frau Roder’s, how we
arranged to desert those others,
how we were enabled to be
singing
Je suis vif, je suis charmant,
Co mine les ’tits oiseaux qui
chan tent
at 2.30 in the Melbourne
morning, alone together out-
side the secondhand bookshop
of the Eastern Market.
I remember meeting you in
Frau Roder’s polished parlor.
Whether you and your friends
arrived first or I and mine is
not important; how long we
had been there, unnoticed by
each other, drinking beer in
that stiff doll’s-house room, I
shall never know.
This, however, I recapture.
It was your first time there
and mine, and neither of us,
despite the warnings of beer-
mates and the implications of
a smell of Shinoleum, the
rigidity of antimacassars and
crocheted table-centres, real-
ised how inexcusable it was to
shower cigarette-ash on Frau
Roder’s glacier-green, glacier-
slippery linoleum.
It was startling to find the
Frau’s blinding white apron
with its broderie anglaise bib
suddenly crackling before us,
to be slapped by: “Ach sotch
guests . . . to dirt my floor
zo! You do zees in your
mamma’s ’ouse . . . ? You
are bad breed—you! —and
you!”
And, directing two jabs —
one at you, one at me —with
the top of a head repressed in
a basketry of pencil-thick
braids, the Frau further dis-
concerted us by going down
as though truncheoned between
your green-plush chair and
mine and, with a crumb-brush-
and - tray plucked
from nowhere in that
trinket - box of a
room, swishing -up
the desecrating ash.
I, blushed, began
to stammer “Oh, I
say, I’m dreadfully
sorry, I had no
idea . .
Your face, as I
saw it then for the
first time, wore
haughty astonish-
ment which very
slowly dissolved into
an expression at
once amused and sad
and understanding:
it was obvious to you
that Frau Roder was.
to be laughed at
kindly, to be pitied a
little, to be accepted
ultimately as a
character, an origi-
nal, a plump Switzer profitably
running a sly-groggery as she
would a kindergarten.
Next you looked at your
sin-companion and smiled—
smiled at me—and I wondered
how long you had been sitting
nearby talking to —to whom?
—while I had been listening
with the keenest boredom to
someone else, to Ina with her
artist's-model body in tight,
cheap cyclamen, her fretful
wet mouth pouting out cycla-
men scurrilities.
A fter that, after you smiled
at me, things were not the
same for a long time —it can
not have been only four weeks
—things no longer remained
reticent in their common wrap-
pings ; buildings and faces,
shards of conversations,
minutest movements acquired
significance.
Each day was a recklessly
revolving prism from which
some perpetual light drove
whirling sharpnesses of irides-
cence. I cannot recall sleeping
or relaxing, yet was never tired,
was always either prepared for
ecstatic flight or springing
from exaltation to exaltation.
It began instantly.
You and I, because of our
scolding a little gauche, des-
pite our aplomb, yet conscious
of each other far more than
of our crime and everyone’s
teasing, began so apologetically
making use of the Souvenir cle
Zurich ashtrays that the first
saucers of sliced radishes in
vinegar and oil were given to
us by the Frau herself with
such a magnanimous, “For my
dirt ones!”
We had the feeling of being
over-forgiven for more than
a peccadillo and said, in duet,
as though after many rehear-
sals, “Oh, you’re a sport, Frau
Roder. I adore . . .”
We did not reach “radishes”;
the laughter of the others was
100 much ; we ourselves were
too amazed. There was an
import which I cannot find
words to qualify lucidly.
Did you notice that no
matter how much more beer
was drunk, how many cigar-
ettes consumed, how great a
noise made, the air remained
undefiled, the lakes and peaks
in the oleographs unfogged,
the whole room crystalline . . .
as though no one were drunk
or drinking, no one jetting out
smoke . . .
There, then, was our meet-
ing—no one introduced us;
I do not know when I learned
your name ; even the first time
we used each other’s Christian
names eludes me. Does it you?
Mine are a man’s memories.
But I hope and think I forget
nothing you will not forget,


remember only what you
remember.
For instance, I forget com-
pletely—do you?—how we
contrived to be asked to
Jacobsen’s party at the Danish
Club, for Jacobsen abhorred
me and could not have par-
doned you for retorting, not
very cleverly, “Now, duckie,
remember there are men
present!” when he called you
a “sex-ridden thing.”
Yet there we were aspiring
arm-in-arm up the stairs while
the others ascended yodelling
in the lift; there we were
waltzing dizzily under the
lithograph of Hans Christian
Andersen and a laurel; there
we were leaning together on
the piano-top with tears in
our eyes, and gin-slings in our
hands while the false-blonde
pianist, tears crawling all over
her dinted face, said for the
nth time, “I wush belle of the
‘Katinka’ Ball in nine-neen—
nine-neen-twenny-four ... I
wush belle of the ball . . .”
while Jacobsen wept like a
madonna, eyes wide open, not
a hair of his plucked eyebrows
out of line, “Isn’t she superb !
Isn’t she the divainest hag, the
grimmest old toper . . . Belle
of the ball! And look at the
sodden old triss . . .”
“I wush belle of the ball
... at the Melbourne Town
Hall it wush—l wush a shnow
fairy . . .”
“A snow fairy! Isn’t it
weep-making! ”
You do remember —could
you ever forget?—hours later,
after the belle of the ball and
Jacobsen had their paroxysms
of self-pity and vomiting, how
you and I stood on the top
steps of the Treasury and re-
constructed to the final detail
the 1924 Snow Fairy —white
satin shoes, a tutu and hood of
swansdown, stage-whited arms
and legs, a circular face with
flat blue eyes, mean pink lips
breathlessly divided —saw her
twirling in a trance that noth-
ing could mar, down the
Treasury steps, airily down
Collins Street hill, to flicker
and flutter, exquisite and
shallow, at the Town Hall . . .
a little uncertainly . . . Did you
see the fluffy head twist aside
briefly there, a pinprick tear
spark for a second in those
mindless blue eyes?
And then on, up the other
slope of the valley of asphalt,
over Elizabeth Street, Queen
Street, flickering almost like a
real flake of snow, being
wafted now, not on spangle-
shot bliss but on a breeze
soured by alley dustbins and
gin, towards the wicked blue
planet and rococo towers of
the Hotel Federal, the dying
lifts and nineteenth-century
back-rooms of the Danish
Club.
Tt was easy then, together,
to be maudlin for others, to
spend tears on the bathetic;
but only for others, never for
ourselves, not once for our-
selves.
It is strange —it is strange —
that we gulped at our wine-
glass of time as though it
were to be repeatedly re-
brimmed by the same flawless
vintage. It is strange —do you
remember? —that we distilled
every last delicious meaning
from trivia and did not realise
anything of the ponderable.
It is strange that we made a
spoken—or was it unspoken?
—covenant about ourselves at
the beginning, almost at the
first glance, and then dis-
cussed or thought no more
about that covenant.
It is strange, when we talked
so much, so incessantly, telling
each other with stringency the
minutiae of our former separ-
ate lives, even the intangible
events in our brief absences
from each other, that I can
recall so meagrely what you
actually said, little of the play
of your voice, of arrange-
ments of words no more than
two or three.
And of those arrangements
one I shall never forget. I shall
have forgotten everything else
one day but never that —the
cry that was our unpremedi-
tated acknowledgment of the
world beyond ours, our horror
at its exaction, our compliance
to its extortion, our question
and answer to ourselves, to the
future. And even that cry, that
one sentence, was, in effect,
ripped from the mouth, of
fantasy and ecstasy . . .
We had had —you will recall
all of it—a day of innocent
delirium; we were responsible
as little to ourselves as to (he
city, the universe, the whole
booth and its fantoccini.
- Nothing in our lives, no know-
ledge or instinct we had, cer-
tainly no phase of our relation-
ship, could have forewarned
us that we would soar over
the invisible borderline, over,
that day, for ever.
Today, still, the reason
evades me ... I almost touch
it ... I brood toward it . . .
it is gone.
HThen, that day, first of all,
I called for you. I was
dressed in my brown Harris
tweed, my strap-glorified
brogues that I had not paid
for. I was so scoured from
hot bath and cold shower and
new razor-blade, so rich with
three pound-notes and a fistful
of florins, that I seemed to
myself newborn, as un-
blemished and untrammelled
as a newborn.
I wore half a pumpkin-
yellow scarf; the other half
was yours. I think we found
the scarf at Olinda —it seems
to me that we came on it
where there were chestnuts,
that we came to chestnuts
through a mountain mist after
visiting some artistic doctor’s
Scandinavian c h i 1 d r e n
Wagner godlings—and their
renaissance-colored blobs of
poster-paint . . . yes, it seems
that the scarf was softly
furred with mist when we
picked it up and had that smell
of tea-grouts that is the smell
of ferns.
I snatched up, no sensible
impulse behind the gesture, a
red cardboard fez and carried
it exultantly up MacKenzie
Street, past the Exhibition
Gardens where the cornicles of
two Sisters of Saint Ann moved
shakily like sick albatrosses
among the elms and, soon,
incredibly soon, to the door of
Kingsley Hall. I ran, was
compelled to run by some

urgency, through the depraved
hall with its secret doors and
their grotesque knockers of
brass, past the obscenely-
crayoned, moustached, squint-
ing little girl of Italian statuary
holding up her skirt.
After the narrow stairs, I
raced on to the glassed-in
balcony with its shattered floor
and came to your attic —and
you were at its door, without
pre-arrangement wearing your
brown Harris-tweed costume,
your demi-scarf of yellow, your
strapped brogues for which you
were never certain your earliest
sugar-daddy had paid.
And at the precise tick I
tapped the fez upon my head,
you finished pinning to your
lapel the dove of white china
that we had saved from star-
vation on the refuse-heap of
a cemetery. It grew plump on
hundreds - and - thousands, I
remember, and on something
else . . . pickled walnuts? . . .
marrons glaces ? Was that how
it happened?
Or did you call for me? Was
it you who precipitated your-
self through the bewitched and
bewitching streets ... the
pillar-boxes with red crowns,
the inexplicable gratings in
footpaths, the lichee-nuts and
back-scratchers in Chinese
shopwindows, the sad posters
of last year’s musical comedies
. . . and came to the delicensed
inn (1852) at 9 MacKenzie
Street where I had a cell next
a privy that clanked like a
senile milkman, to leap at me
in your Harris tweed and white
dove just as I topped my
Harris tweed with a cardboard
fez.
It does not matter, it did
not ever matter, who came to
whom. In a flash we were
far from either your attic or
my cell, flying like Mercuries
above the pavements, inspired
by each other: I by you with
your monstrous bauble from a
grave, you by me with my gilt-
rimmed ‘ favor from a lower-
middle-class party.
The wind soared in cul-de-
sacs and warehouse lanes as
cleanly as a holiday seaside
wind. It sparkled, bounded
like a joyous panther blue as
glass, floundered like a washed
white dog along the gutters,
butted us archly with a taut
scoured belly great as a main-
sail’s . . . wind . . . wind . . .
It must have been raining
before we met, the streets were
patterned in the manner of a
Friesian cow with scrubbed dry
patches, with quietly steaming
damp ones. Here and there
were pools, pure blue, that
cherubim might have washed
their wings in, sipped from.
People flirted by us, tipped us
like the pinions of swallows,
every face flashed at us,
smiled, was gone as we sped
on and on to ... to .. .
where were we going?
It seemed a straight journey,
a road streaming directly to-
wards a luminous crisis too
dazzling for anyone but the
dead. And yet, our feet
eternally on this path, we
appeared to deviate, to double-
back, to pause, sit, smoke, drink
at counters, while nevertheless
unrelievediy speeding on, look-
ing neither to left nor right nor
behind, with the pace of the
transparent wind our pace . . .

Australia’s First
Leading: Lady
By ELIZABETH R. EDWARDS
In the lusty, rollicking days
of Sydney Town in the
1830’s the patrons of an inn
in Pitt Street jostled and
pushed to buy their mugs of
ale and to catch the eye of the
young daughter of the inn-
keeper.
A dark-eyed beauty at 15,
Eliza Winstanley delighted the
thirsty settlers with her quick
wit and radiant smile. Her
mother, who had bolstered her
husband's meagre income in an
amazing variety of occupations,
from selling cigars to making
straw bonnets, was now hostess
of the popular Blue Lion
tavern. Eliza’s youthful im-
pressions and observations of
life from behind the bar were
later vividly recalled in her
many novels and short-stories.
She was born on September
1, 1818, but there is some con-
jecture as to her actual birth-
place. It is now believed that
she was born in England,
though her contemporaries
emphatically stated that she
was born in Kent Street, Syd-
ney.
Certainly, coming to Sydney
from Melbourne as a small
girl, during the latter years of
Governor Macquarie’s reign,
Eliza regarded herself as an
Australian, and the country
may justly take the credit for
the meteoric rise to fame of
this amazing young girl.
Her English mother came
from a well-to-do Lancashire
family boasting a couple of
titles. Her father, a sign-
painter, came from the South
of England. His only claim to
fame there was that an ancestor
of his built the first lighthouse
where the famous Eddystone
Lighthouse now stands guard
over the English Channel.
Prior to 1833 Barnett Levy,
the host of the Royal Hotel in
George Street, Sydney, had
been entertaining his patrons
with performances in his
saloon. He then decided it was
high time Sydney had a theatre
of its own.
The settlers in the then
colony had been preoccupied
with farming the virgin
countryside and the intricacies
of trade and commerce. The
newspapers had little cultural
content, but advertised auction-
sales of cows, working-bullocks
and horses; rewards were
offered for the return of stray-
ing livestock; jobs for shep-
herds and cooks were plentiful.
There was no time for the Arts.
Levy, determined to alter this
state of affairs, in 1833
completed the first Theatre
Royal on the site where
Dymock’s Book Arcade now
stands in George Street. To-
day’s Theatre Royal is Syd-
ney’s fourth, its predecessors
all having burnt to the ground.
Cunningly, Levy built his
theatre behind his hotel, and
sat back during the intervals
reaping the fruits of his labors,
the playgoers taking advantage
of the fact “that a cold colla-
tion and other refreshments
were constantly on the table for
their accommodation.”
The new theatre flourished.
The gentry arrived in their
carriages ; the ladies displayed
their laces and furs in the
boxes and gallery of the gaslit
auditorium. The less fortunate
crowded together on hard
benches in the pit. It is on
record that, often unwashed
and unshaven, they offended
the “nobility” by standing on
their seats in moments of
excitement. As the full-blooded
melodramas unfolded, Eliza
and her family were enthusi-
astic spectators.
Her father was happily
engaged painting scenery at the
theatre, and the stage-struck
child was a frequent visitor
backstage, and, when a benefit-
performance was held on
October 31, 1834, for Mr. Win-
stanley he insisted that Eliza
be included in the cast.
So Eliza made her first stage
appearance in the title-role of
“Clari, or the Maid of Milan,”
at the age of 16. The critics
were delighted.
“This young lady,” they
wrote, “appears to possess
from nature those first and
essential requisites in an
actress, a rich voice, a counten-
ance susceptible of strong ex-
pression and an agreeable
form.” s
Regular engagements fol-
lowed in quick succession.
Eliza played opposite the
“heart-throb” of the day, hand-
some Conrad Knowles. She
was Sydney’s most popular
actress.
T uckily she had the stamina
and good health necessary
both to an actress and the
audience of the day. Perform-
ances were billed to commence
at 7 p.m., rarely ending before
midnight. In a town starved
for entertainment, playgoers
weren’t satisfied with one play
a night. They demanded at
least three, wth songs and
dances to fill-in the intervals.
After the show the “aristo-
cracy” swept off in their
carriages; the lesser breed
clambered aboard an “omni-
bus”—-drawn by two or four
horses. The fare for those
living “on the Surry Hills” was
one-shilling.
Living close to the theatre,
Eliza and her sister Anne vvere
“What else can you do?"

escorted to their home in
fashionable Kent Street by
brother Robert. He later be-
came one of Sydney’s first
practising dentists.
Despite her undoubted popu-
larity, the critics’ pens could be
laced with vitriol. “Miss Win-
stanley is too affected and
making improper use of the
letter ‘h’,” they wrote. Or
sneered: “If she had not dis-
played such a wish to be in
heroics she would have suc-
ceeded better.”
But Eliza continued to be the
favorite of an adoring public.
Tn 1837 the Theatre Royal
closed-down shortly after
the death of Barnett Levy. His
widow gave-up the struggle of
managing the theatre on her
own.
Sydney, however, wasn’t
without a theatre for long. In
1838 the “Sydney Herald”
reported that the Royal Vic-
toria Theatre opened “with
great eclat.” Practically all the
Theatre Royal Company were
engaged by the new theatre,
Eliza among them. On the
thrilling occasion of its first
performance, she starred in
“Othello.”
She was already harboring
an ambition to go overseas. As
in the present day, London was
the Mecca of every Australian
actress. Her ambition was
fired by the visit to Australia
the year before of beautiful
Mrs. Chester, the first London
actress to come here.
The disused Theatre Royal,
and its hotel with it, burnt to
the ground in 1840. It was
thought that a drunken carter,
after the revels of St. Patrick’s
night, fell asleep on his straw
without extinguishing “his
farthing-dip.” Barnett Levy’s
dream was reduced to ashes.
Still, Eliza continued
triumphant. Many “firsts” are
in the records to her credit.
She was the first Anne Page
in “The Merry Wives of
Windsor” and the first Rosa-
lind of “As You like It” that
the colony had seen.
In the custom of the day,
several benefit - performances
were held for the young actress.
She starred in such melodramas
as “Madeline the Maniac” and
“The Whistler, or the Fate of
the Lily of St. Leonards.” The
proceeds were carefully saved
for the longed-for journey to
England.
At historic St. James’ Church
in King Street, in 1841,
Eliza made her only trip to
the altar. She married dashing
young Irish musician Henry
Charles O’Flaherty. He had
long admired her from the
orchestra-pit as she performed
there on the stage.
The outlook was rosy for
Eliza O’Flaherty. She happily
combined marriage with her
career for the next five years.
Yet another benefit was held
for her at the opening of the
Olympic Theatre in Pitt Street.
Her sister Anne, now an accom-
plished singer, was in the cast.
A rich singing voice was also
among Eliza’s advantages.
Felix Mendelssohn, later to
hear her in Birmingham, Eng-
land, complimented her warmly
on her singing. In Sydney she
took part in a “Grand Ora-
torio” at St. Mary’s Cathedral.
Sydneysiders crowded the
Cathedral to the doors. A seat
in the transcept of the
Cathedral cost 155., and the
western end, 10s. There was
no “half-price,” but two
children were admitted by one
ticket.
'T'hen, in March, 1846, the
barque Kinnear slipped
out through Sydney Heads
bound for London. The
O'Flahertys were aboard. Eliza
was now 28, and in England
engagements fell into her lap.
She played in Manchester,
Newcastle-on-Tyne, and then,
at last, London. She had be-
come the first Australian
actress to appear on the
London stage.
Crossing the Atlantic the
following year, she delighted
New York audiences in her
now favorite role of Mistress
Quickly. She had the distinc-
tion of playing opposite James
Hackett, America’s greatest
Shakspearian actor —and the
Australian girl received her
share of the applause.
She returned to a prosperous
England. It was the era of
progress after the turmoil of
the Industrial Revolution.
Queen Victoria reigned
benignly. Millions of spec-
tators were coming to gape and
wonder at the Great Exhibition
at the Crystal Palace. And the
London Theatre was at its
zenith.
There were no fewer than 19
theatres drawing the crowds in
London, exclusive of two
Italian opera-companies and a
theatre devoted to productions
of French Drama.
Tn 1850 Eliza joined the com-
pany of brilliant actor-pro-
ducer Charles Kean, who took-
over the management of the
Princess Theatre in London’s
Oxford Street. Archaelogically
correct in every detail,
his Shakspearian productions
were the most spectacular ever
staged. Extras were employed
in hundreds even horses
appeared in the cast.
Still, there was one feminine
problem Kean was unable to
overcome —his wife’s steadfast
refusal to shed her voluminous
Victorian petticoats for the
sake of authenticity!
For the next . nine years
Eliza remained in the company
led by Charles and his wife.
When the immense cost of his
productions forced Kean to
abandon the Princess and tour
the provinces, Eliza went with
him.
Queen Victoria was an avid
theatregoer. She had a perma-
nent box at the Princess, and
attended on numerous occa-
sions. At Windsor Castle,
Eliza gained yet another dis-
tinction. She was the first Aus-
tralian actress to appear, in a
command performance. She
delighted the Queen with her
lively portrayal of Mrs. Mala-
prop, and was a visitor many
times to the Castle with Kean’s
company.
Tncluded in Tallis’s Gallery
of Distinguished Actors
and Actresses of the ’Fifties,
Eliza is pictured as a plump
woman by modern standards.
Her dark hair is severely drawn
back under an' Elizabethan
head-dress, but without the
modern aids of make-up, her
clever, serious face and large
dark eyes have an ethereal
quality.
A later portrait, when 57,
richly gowned and bejewelled,-
shows her to be still remark-
ably handsome.
Poor Charles O’Flaherty
was somewhat overshadowed
by his talented wife. Being
ahead of the Hollywood idea,
no whiff of scandal was associ-
ated with their marriage.
Actually, little is known of
Mr. O’Flaherty, though he did
appear with his wife on one of
her benefit-nights. Even the
date of his death is uncertain.
He just slipped quietly away
somewhere around 1845.
Afterwards, Eliza went far
afield —to Russia, Germany,
France; appearing in . the
Shakspearian roles she had
made famous.
And then, in 1865, she
abruptly left the stage at the
height of her career —to de-
vote herself to writing.
Her education at Sydney
College, where Sydney
Grammar School now stands,
had included a sound ground-
ing in English language and
literature. Endowed with vivid
imagination and keen powers
of observation, she now be-
came a most successful
authoress.
She wrote no fewer than 33
novels, as well as innumerable
short-stories. Painting vivid
scenes of Australian life, she
enthralled her English readers.
Bushrangers and their roguish
companions galloped through
the pages of her books.
Johnny O’Donohoe and his
outlaw gang roamed the bush
round Kellyville on the Wind-
sor Road. The gentry lived in
their fine houses in respectable
Wynyard Street; the poor sold
clothesprops round the shanties
of the Waverley bushland;
convicts writhed in their
chains on Norfolk Island.
Sydney readers took a keen
delight in trying to discover
the identity of her characters,
many of whom, thinly dis-
guised, were drawn from life.
Fifteen years after taking
up her pen, Mrs. O’Flaherty
returned to Australia. For two
years she lived quietly with
her sister in Geelong, Victoria,
and she returned to Sydney, a
sick woman, in 1880.
December 2, 1882, a house
in Clarence Street saw the last
of the gallant actress. She
was 62.
She was buried beneath an
unpretentious red sandstone
tablet in Waverley Cemetery ;
her grave there is beside another
great Australian, Henry
Lawson.


Prelude to Camp David
The Two Faces of Hr. K.
When Nikita Khrushchev, reviving
memories of Greta Garbo, said
he thought he’d go home, there
was a tendency in this country
(and apparently in Britain) to be annoyed
with the Americans for having annoyed
him. This was a reflection of the high
hopes that had been built around the
meeting of the Russian Premier and
President Eisenhower rather than of
liking or admiration for Mr. K. Possibly
no more damning indictment of
Khrushchev could be found than this
widespread feeling that because he felt
himself personally insulted he would
give up all 'attempts at coming to an
agreement with the West, and condemn
the world to the ultimate certainty of
a nuclear war.
As a result of Khrushchev’s outbursts,
Americans have been variously scolded
for rudeness, brashness and discourtesy ;
there has even been the suggestion of
deliberate intent to sabotage the visit lor
fear it might lead to an easing of the
cold war.
On the eve of Khrushchev’s arrival
Americans were urged to be polite to
the visitors, but also to be outspoken
on controversial issues. This appeal was
made by Vice-President Nixon, himself
not long back from a trip to Russia,
during which he had several hot verbal
clashes with Khrushchev, both men
carrying outspokenness on controversial
issues to the limit.
Bad Taste
nr'HE crowds who saw the Khrushchev
party arrive in Washington apparently
responded to the appeal to be polite,
even if their politeness was rather
frigid. Most newspapers, too, observed
the conventions, though there were
exceptions, notably the New York
“Daily Mirror,” with its headline “Come
In, Murderer.” The paper might have
been kidding itself that it was striking
a blow for the Four Freedoms or the
American way of life, but at this
distance its action looked more like
posturing to a mass-circulation in
shockingly bad taste and with reckless
irresponsibility.
Mr. K. was not called upon to enter
into controversy over the “Daily
Mirror” headline; it was questions of
the “Have - you - stopped - beating - your-
wife” category that later moved him to
anger. These were fired at him at a
National Press Club reception; at a
businessmen’s dinner in New York ; at
a mayoral reception in Los Angeles and
a dinner given by trade-union leaders
in San Francisco. It was after the
mayoral reception that he spoke of
going home. It did seem at times that
Mr. K. was being prodded and goaded
into retaliation, though it must be
admitted that for a mail who boasts of
his tough upbringing he seemed sur-
prisingly touchy.
How much of this prodding was due
to the brashness of his questioners?
How much to news-hungry editors
eager for another sensation? How much
to a very human desire —by no means
peculiar to Americans —of wanting to
cock a snook at a giant, to experience
the momentary sense of power that
comes with putting-up a twisty one to
.the dictator of 200-million people?
American newsmen have never been
noted for being overpolite to visiting
notabilities, and most U.S. newspapers
put sales above diplomacy any day of
the week.
Hollywood Trash
nr'HE handling of news-stories about Mrs.
Khrushchev was particularly bad ;
the aim seemed to be to emphasise her
dowdiness in comparison with smartly-
dressed American women. Hollywood’s
deplorably bad taste in choosing a
legs-'n’-all show with which to demon-
strate U.S. supremacy in film-making
was, of course, just what could be ex-
pected of Hollywood, but it gave
Khrushchev the chance to refer, later,
to trash and pornography.
But in criticising all these people
several points should be borne in mind.
Firstly, this visit is of Khrushchev’s
own seeking. There can be no two ways
about that. Neither the President nor
the State Department had until recently
shown any desire for an exchange of
visits. If anything, their attitude was
dead against it. Secondly, Khrushchev
had said that he wanted to meet the
people and get to know them.
Meeting the people is one thing ; get-
ting to know them is another. The first
could have been achieved by merely
driving through the streets, by hand-
shakings at receptions. Getting to know
them must surely involve talking with
them and exchanging ideas. And if the
exchange of ideas was to be of any
value at all, it had to be a frank ex-
change. Platitudes and banalities would
not do.
“A Plain Blunt Man”
'lT'hrushchev makes quite a parade of
his own outspokenness. “We
Russians believe in plain talk,” “I am
a peasant and peasants speak bluntly,”
are remarks that spring easily to his
lips, and he demonstrates one -aspect
of their correctness with such homely
metaphors as having a dead rat in one’s
teeth or of not killing flies with one’s
nostrils. Khrushchev’s treatment of
visitors to Moscow isn’t always the
epitome of old-world courtesy. Nixon
was treated to a coarse tongue-lashing
until he showed he could give as good
as he got. Incidentally, the American
Vice-President, while on his tour of the
friendly countries of South America,
was subjected to far more indignities
and insuits than-Mr. K. has suffered in
the United States, and his ability to
stand-up to them raised his stocks
tremendously in his own country. ,No
American has yet spat on, or even at,
Khrushchev, and the only things thrown
at him have been words. Nixon copped
the lot.
Judging by his American season, Mr.
K. thinks the bluntness should come
from one side only—his side. He can
talk in terms of wholesale destruction,
of flames and ashes and burials. That’s
just clean fun. But no one else must
be blunt. Like the road to the Kolyma
goldfields, it’s a one-way track. The
trade-union leaders with whom he
clashed complained that as long as they
stuck to generalities all was well, but
when they attempted controversy they
got nowhere. At one stage Mr. K. was
calling his trade-union hosts (who repre-
sented 15-million workers) “capitalist
lackeys and stooges.”
A Takeover Bid
'T'he Russian leader’s expressed desire
to meet the people is, of course,
open to two interpretations—the straight-
out one that he really wanted to get
to know them, or the strongly-suspected
one that he wanted to get to the
American people over the heads of their
Government; to make a kind of take-
over bid for their sympathy. In either
case Nixon’s advice seems to have been
sound. Politeness is the right of every
guest, as it is the duty of every host.
As to outspokenness, assuming Mr. K.
genuinely wanted to get to know the
people, he could hardly hope to do so
without hearing their views on contro-
versial issues. It is not enough for him
to know what the American people eat,
how they dress, their tastes in films or
their favorite sport. What really matters
is their views on the issues that separate
the two Governments. In particular he
should be anxious to know whether and
to what extent their views coincide with
those of their Government. A sincere
inquirer would want to find that. out.
On the other hand, if he wasn’t sincere,
if his real purpose was to put on a
display of glad-handing, back-slapping
Sputnik charm; to convince the
American public that this tubby little
man with the boyish grin couldn’t
possibly be the nefarious schemer their
leaders would have them believe; if
that was the case, it was all the
important that the people he met should
speak their minds on controversial sub-
jects. It gave the public a chance to
see Mr. K. with the grin off—without
the mask —as Bulganin, Malenkov and
many of his former colleagues must have
seen him when their time of reckoning
arrived.

SELECTIONS
Derby: Martello Towers,
1 ; Fire Flair, 2 ; Travel Boy,
3.
Epsom: Noholme, 1 ; In
Love, 2 ; Grenoble, 3.
Breeders’ Plate: Gemini
Prince, 1 ; Beau Tirage, 2;
Sky High, 3.
Metropolitan: Bardshah, 1 ;
Royal Jester, 2 ; Foxmara, 3.
Gimcrack Stakes: Wenona
Girl, 1 ; Miss Gigi, 2 Miss
Enthrall, 3.
Several winners of the
Randwick two - year - old
barrier-trials repeated their
success at the Rosebery trials
last Friday, including Gemini
Prince, Sky High, Beau Tirage
and the filly Wenona Girl.
All four impressed at Rose-
bery, while other winners to
please were Good Fort, Miss
Gigi, Australian Star, Hydrell,
Delnita and Brisbane’s Miss
Enthrall. Last-named, trained
by Fred Best, is by Newtown
Wonder (imp.) from Enthrall,
arid will be raced by her
breeder, L. Quinn. The filly
came from the rear of the
field, and she should be suited
by the extra distance of the
Gimcrack Stakes. Alpenstock,
winner of the final trial, is a
colt by Alpenhorn (imp.) from
Nizam’s Belle. Joe Taylor’s
Good Fort again showed a
fine turn of speed, and hugged
the rails all the way. Fastest
time for the half-mile —
474 sec made by Sky
High in the first trial; he
galloped when conditions were
best, but he should go well in
the Breeders’ Plate, as should
Gemini Prince, who might be
the best of the colts. Wenona
Girl appears to stand out from
the other fillies.
The T. J. Smith stable had
mixed luck at Rosehill last
Saturday. After Irish Folly
had been defeated by Noholme
in the Hill Stakes and Bold
Pilot had shaped poorly in the
Cup, Exemption won the final
Welter. N. Sellwood, who had
the mount, also scored on No-
holme. It was Exemption’s
first success in Sydney, though
he had won in Brisbane in
mid-August and also earlier in
the year. His second to In
Love .at Randwick on Sep-
tember 12 assured him of
favoritism for the Rosehill
Welter, especially following In
Love’s success in the Theo
Marks Quality Handicap three
races earlier. N.Z. owner the
Hon. W. S. Goosman races
Exemption, a four-year-old
gelding by Ruthless (imp.)
from Rosina by Foxbridge
(imp.) or Nizami (Fr.) from
Eager Rose by Day Comet
(imp.). Exemption, however,
appeared a little lucky to beat
outsider Grecian Vale, who
was blocked when making a
final run in the straight.
.Brilliant galloper Aggressive
—winner of seven races from
nine starts since being taken
over by Rosebery trainer Sid
Nicholls, and having 9st. to
lump in restricted company in
most of them—cleared right
away in the Second Parra-
matta Stakes. Aggressive
figures in the Epsom on 7st.,
and the drop of 281 b. could
help him to run out the mile,
though he has yet to tackle
that distance. He has won at
1\ furlongs, and as he is by
Faux Tirage (imp.), sire of
stayers, from First Round by
Nightly from Knock Out by
Winning Hit, he should not
find it difficult to do a mile.
In the 10-furlongs Encour-
age Handicap—won in good
style, if narrowly, by Centre
Stream —the hot favorite Nyn-
gan was a great disappoint-
ment. Centre Stream raced
in the middle of the field to
the home-turn, where he moved
up sharply and soon took the
lead, to win from 100-to-l
Old Beau. Bred on staying
lines, Centre Stream is by
Midstream (imp.) from Lady
Forrest by Delville Wood
(imp.) from News Session by
Le Grand Due (Fr.) from
staying mare Session by Mar-
conigram (imp.). Session won
the V.R.C. Oaks, the Wakeful
Stakes and the AJ.C. Adrian
Knox Stakes.
Noholme’s win in the Hill
Stakes (8-y furlongs, run in
1.44.6) was most impressive.
The race-record—l.43^ —was
made last year by another
speedy three-year-old, Skyline,
who went on to win the
Derby. It was N. Sellwood’s
fourth Hill Stakes win, the,
others being on Prince Cor-
tauld, Hydrogen and Vagabond,
....
Grenoble finished last in the
Hill Stakes. It looked a case
of passing the substance for
the shadow , as Grenoble was
also an acceptor for the Quality
Handicap with 9.1 ; he might
have done better under handi-
aP. conditions. He carried
Hill Stakes, and the
dro P the Epsom
S ould help ’ but he sb °wed no
dash whatever in the Stakes.
* *
Irish Foll y’ runner-up in the
Hill Stakes to Noholme but
five len gths behind the run-
away winner—goes up 51b. to
8.5 in the Epsom. Woolsack,
who goes up 21b., missed a
place in the Hill Stakes, but
will be better-off in the
handicap.
....
Jn Love easily won the
Quality Handicap with 8.6, and
has 8.3 in the Epsom, while
runner-up Compass has 8.8 in
the mile, 21b. less than he
carried at Rosehill. His was


an impressive run from the
rear of the field.
For the Metropolitan the
Rosehill displays pointed
strongly to Bardshah, while
Royal Jester also did well.
Under adverse conditions
Bardshah won the Rosehill
Cup with 8.11, or 61b. above
his Metrop. impost. He got
into bother more than once
and had to be taken right round
the field at the entrance to
the straight—usually suicidal
tactics. However, he’s a game
finisher and never gives in.
Ray Selkrig, f6r his part, rode
the four-year-old with masterly
skill. Bardshah’s trainer, Bob
Stuart, thought Bold Pilot
would be his chief danger, but
the T. J. Smith four-year-old
ran much below form. Royal
Jester (third) drops 61b. in the
Metrop.
Balfast has the same weight
in the Metrop. as Bardshah
and Valerius. In the Hill
Stakes Balfast carried 9.4,
and in the Metrop. drops to
8.5. He came from last to
finish fifth —not a bad w.-f.-a.
run for a handicapper.
Valerius’s run at Randwick
next Saturday should give a
fair idea of his Metrop.
prospects.
Winner of the Dundas
Handicap at the Warwick
Farm midweek fixture, Polo
Bay, owned and trained in Mel-
bourne, is by Marco Polo II
(imp.) from Chatella by Chats-
worth (imp.) from Flying
Tresses by Romeo (imp.). He’s
in Sydney for the Derby, and,
though he carried only 7.5,
he had an impressive win.
Could help make it interesting.
All Rule, an easy Maiden
winner at Hawkesbury, could
be a fair sort of bargain. He
was one of the cheapest lots
at the Randwick yearling-sales
last year, going for a mere
70gns. He gave trainer Bob
Stuart a nice win with yet
another of the progeny of
Royal Empire (imp.). All
Rule is from an imported
mare, Purple Planet, who’s by
His Highness from Star of
Hope by Vesington Star. One
of All Rule’s relatives, Roistar,
ran third in the English Derby
three years ago and finished
second in the Irish Derby.

ings where mobile stalls are in

other types could catch in the

At the Valley
South Australian colt Mar-
dene last Saturday lived right
up to his reputation in the
£2600 Moonee Valley Stakes,
a semi-classic mile-event for
three-year-olds. Not well away,
the son of Helios and La
Taraise swept from second-
last when the field settled-
down to hit the front at the
“five.” He led from there to
the post, and although the
other good South Australian
youngster, Goglio, challenged
strongly in the run home, Mar-
“There's only one Way to appease a tiger—let him
have a square meal.”
dene was going the better on
the line. It was the fifth win
in a row for the Helios colt,
and his ninth from 14 starts.
He will tackle the Caulfield
Guineas, and that always-
sparkling mile should be worth
going a long way to see this
year. The local colts seem
outclassed, but Mardene and
Goglio look stiff opposition
for the Sydney cracks, Mar-
tello Towers and Travel Boy.

Last autumn the Landau
filly Chaise showed excellent
form in good company, but
because she had not run par-
ticularly well at her first start
after a spell the public let her
go out at long odds for the
first Chandos Handicap at the
Valley, a race restricted to
three-year-old fillies. Chaise
showed brilliant speed to lead
practically throughout, and in
the run home was able to
hold-off the fast-finishing
Rhexia. Bobby Ball, who is
riding very well since he made
a comeback to the game,
handled Chaise perfectly. The
filly does not look like getting
a distance much past the six
furlongs of the Chandos, but
she will win in better company
than she met at the Valley.
The winner of the second
Chandos, Sahibah, is obviously
a filly well above average. On
the previous Saturday she had
scored her first win when she
dashed right away from the
good filly Hyleena, and in the
Chandos she again won by a
great space. Sahibah —got by
Belvedere (who now stands in
New Zealand) from Milford
Haven by Midstream from
Lady Silvius —could easily win
one of the fillies’ classics.
In the Budgeree Trial, Idle
Mac, though he had won a
similar event with the same
weight against practically the
same field only a week before,
drifted from fours to eights
in the betting. He won well.
• • • •
Although he was only fifth
in the 10-furlongs Glenara
Handicap, Malarno need not
be written-off as a Caulfield
Cup hope. About six furlongs
from home he met a bad check,
which sent him to the rear
of the field, and MacDonald
had to sool the aged Captain
Fox gelding right around them
to be challenging for the lead
at the turn, very wide out.
Not surprisingly, Malarno
weakened a little over the last
few yards. He is no cham-
pion, but if he strikes a wet
track for the Caulfield Cup
(in which he has only 8.0) he
will run a great race.
• • • •
Well Spent, who also has the
Caulfield Cup in his sights,
won the Glenara. He’s a good,
consistent galloper, but he may
find the mile-and-a-half a bit
far. South Australian galloper
Moon Bridge, whose Adelaide
form has been very good,
pleased with a close second.
Third horse in the Glenara
was this year’s Australian Cup
winner Gaybao, whose spring
mission is the Melbourne Cup.
With a better run, Gaybao
may have won on Saturday.
“They never come back” is
usually even more true of
horses than sportsmen, but St.
Joel, who was foaled a decade
ago, came back from the pad-
dock to win his third Invita-
tion Stakes at Caulfield last
Thursday. The remarkable
old gelding first won the event
in 1953, ran second the next
year and scored again in 1956.
Against a pretty hot field in
this year’s race, his old legs
went nimbly enough to cover
the seven furlongs in time
which equalled the race-record
of 1.244. He won by inches
from Brocken, with the un-
lucky Gay Saba a half-head
further back. Ray Selkrig had
the winning mount —the first
time a Sydney rider has won
the race. Ballarat trainer
Arthur Smerdon deserves high
praise for producing St. Joel
fit to win. The old gelding
now goes back again to the
paddocks —this time for keeps.
Sir Blink raced his way back
to favor for-the Sydney Metro-
politan and the Caulfield Cup
with a good win in the mile-
and-a-half Caulfield Metropoli-
tan Handicap last Thursday.
It was his first success since
winning last year’s V.R.C.
Derby. It was said here
recently that Sir Blink would
have trouble winning a race
with more than 9.0, but at
Caulfield he was ridden by
stable apprentice Bobby Scar-
lett, whose 71b.-claim reduced
the “little bloke’s” impost to
8.12. It is still this writer’s
view that Sir Blink, good and
game as he is, will have
trouble in winning one of the
big spring handicaps with the
weights he must carry.
The few intrepid backers
who laid 4 to 1 on Lord to
win the w.-f.-a. Underwood
Stakes at the Thursday meet-
ing watched incredulously as
the big gelding raced at a
tangent along the straight to
finish under the judge’s box,
losing to South Australian
galloper Trellios. The winner
has proved a useful sort, but
prior to his Underwood had
no pretensions to w.-f.-a. class;


at his previous start he had
been badly beaten by the
moderate Vermont Star. Trel-
lios has 7.11 in the Caulfield
Cup, compared to the 9.4 he
carried in the Underwood.
Next Saturday at Fleming-
ton the new colts and fillies
step-out in public for the first
time, in heats of the Mari-
byrnong Trial Stakes. One
division is for colts and geld-
ings (8.9), the other for fillies
(8.4). With no form to guide
them, the public will follow
the market —usually a very
reliable pointer to these events.

The Trots
Apepa, a Victorian trotter
who has been barred from
some tracks for bad behavior,
scored effortlessly in the open-
ing event at Harold Park last
Saturday night. Starting
smartly, Opepa went to the
front early, increasing his lead
steadily to get there by eight
lengths from Gunrock and
Loreto Noel. General Scott
held-off Gorrelate in a desper-
ate finish to win the Harold
Park Handicap by a neck.
Although strongly fancied in
his last three runs Gorrelate
has failed to land the bacon.
A win for either horse next
Friday night will qualify him
for the rich Anniversary Cup
on October 24. Hot favorite
O’Dearo lost ground at barrier-
rise in the Stanmore Handicap
and finished a bad ninth to
Meadowlands and Royal
Guest. Favorite Sky Queen
won the Second Qualifying
impressively from Noble Step.

Other Sports
What other game in Aus-
tralia at all compares with
Aussie Rules, as played in Mel-
bourne, for getting them in?
Obviously there isn’t even a
second that gets within gun-
shot of it. In football, it
clearly leads all the other codes
put together as a crowd attrac-
tion. All that anyone needs to
do to be convinced of this,
and of the code’s quality as a
spectator-sport; is to go
through a single Melbourne
season, attending regularly, and
seeing the several great games'
that are certain to take place
on the way.
Last Saturday’s grand-final
between Melbourne and Essen-
don was a good, and typical,
case in point. It wasn’t merely
that the game drew a crowd
of 103,506 to the Melbourne
Cricket Ground (somewhere
about the limit imposed, for
safety, since the introduction
of ticket-booking). Comparing
against other games, that was
remarkable enough. And this
was not, of course, any much-
publicised “International” fix-
ture. Even though it was a
“grand-final,” it was still a club
game, and, moreover, one in
which the actual result had
looked a foregone thing!
Indeed, it was very easily thus
forecast in these pages last
week—in fact, of that crowd
of over 103,000, only the most
patriotic Essendon barrackers
expected anything but what
duly happened: a win for Mel-
bourne (17.13-11.12). What
they went along for wasn’t the
result at all, but the football
they would see played in
reaching it. And they got their
money’s worth.

Westralian Bob Marshall,
who won his 15th Australian
amateur billiard-championship
in Brisbane, was hefting a cue
before he touched double-
figures ; his dad ran a Kal-
goorlie billiard-saloon. Later,
a Perth sporting-club member,
Ted Thompson, gave Marshall
the cue he was still using in
Brisbane 30 years later. Walter
Lindrum’s brother Horace did
much to mould the Wes-
tralian’s top-of-the-table tech-
nique.

“Recorder”: The Australian
golf-team to play in South
Africa bears none of the “old
school tie” atmosphere about
it. Vic Bulgin (N.S.W.), 31,
is a policeman ; Bruce Devlin
(Victoria), 21, is a plumber;
Kevin Hartley (Victoria), 25, is
an engineer; Doug Bachli
(Victoria), 37, is a salesman ;
Peter Toogood (Tasmania), 29,
is a physical-education teacher;
and Jack Coogan (Queensland),
33, is a public servant. The
team, to be managed by Justin
Seward (Western Australia),
defends the Commonwealth
Trophy, won at St. Andrew’s in
1954. It should win again, as
Devlin, Bachli and Toogood
were in the Australian team
that won the 30-nation Eisen-
hower Cup competition at St.
Andrew’s last year.

“Mitron”: In its third
season of first-division Soccer,
Annerley has won two of the
major trophies in the Brisbane
and Ipswich (Q.) competition,
winning the premiership and
the Hilton Shield. The team
has also reached the semi-final
of the Tristram Shield, and the
only blot on its record in 1959
was a defeat by Oxley in the
Ampol Tournament final. The
team includes well-known inter-
nationals Mai Wild and
Graham McMillan.
* * *
“Spiked”: Olympian Alan
Lawrence, Barry Almond and
Pat Clohessy, N.S.W. athletes
studying in an American uni-
versity, accepted U.S. scholar-
ships for special study, as
several other Australian
athletes have done. The Aus-
tralian Amateur Athletic Asso-
ciation, holding that the
American universities were
draining the life-blood out of
the sport, took the matter to
the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, claiming
that the scholarships were given
for athletic prowess, and were,
therefore, not bona fide. The
International body put its head
in the sand, refused to take
action or suggest what could
be done. Now the Australian
body has had to accept the
inevitable, and it isn’t pleased
to hear that Clohessy, of
Tamworth (N.S.W.), won
5 A’s and a B for business-
administration studies, that
Lawrence took his A for TV-
examinations, and that Almond,
in his first year, obtained an A
pass. All three athletes say they
have never studied harder, and
that they must obtain high
marks to hold their position in
their U.S. university.
* * *
" Throwing" the Ball
“Insider”: So far as “throwing”
is concerned, what cricket umpires
need is a clear-cut definition to
help them and a simple test to
apply to a bowling-action. Maybe
it could be on the line that the
arm must be rigid when it passes
the shoulder or when it is parallel
to the ground. Although some
claim that a rigid ,arm means a
throw.
Certainly, until further and more
definite guidance is forthcoming,
there is likely to be some discrep-
ancy in interpretation. Umpires
are reluctant to “call” a bowler,
especially if he is a professional.
Consistent “calling” could jeopard-
ise hjs livelihood. While this
attitude prevails the case against
bowlers is weakened. Also, umpires
rightly assume that a bowler chosen
by experienced selectors must be
above suspicion.
There is nothing new in the
claim that some bowlers “throw.”
In 1883 Lord Harris proposed that
“the ball must be fairly bowled,
not thrown or jerked.” That is
how the law still puts it.
In 1897 Wisden wrote of G. H.
Trott’s 1896 Australian team to
England: “A fast-bowler with the
action of Jones, or a slow-bowler
so open to question as McKibbin,
would have found no place in
English teams.”
The 1934 Australians considered
English left-hand fast-bowler Clark
to be a “thrower,” but Bradman
handled him comfortably, so there
was no hue-and-cry about him.
So complaints have gone on for
years. At present they hinge about
Rorke and Meckiff. Perhaps the
fact that Rorke drags his foot over
the line caused some of the adverse
comment about his bowling-action.
When a bowler with the speed of
Rorke “drags” and his bowling-
action is suspect the batsman
suffers. Still, most fast-bowlers
drag to some extent.’ Photographs
have shown that Tyson, Lindwall
and Rorke drag, and Rorke has
been filmed with his back foot
past the popping-crease before he
has delivered the ball. (The
popping-crease, of course, is where
the batsman takes strike.)
Australia has suggested creation
of a dragging-crease behind the
bowling-crease. In England such
a line exists, although only in the
umpire’s imagination. Why not
make the bowlers deliver the ball
with the forward foot behind the
bowling-crease? Then they would
be bowling the full length of the
pitch.
Australia has been accused by
some English critics of permitting
“throwers” in the last Test series
in reprisal for the “dust-bowl”
spinners’ wickets in England in
1956. Whether or not that is
so, Australia should try to have
the “throwing” business straight-
ened out on an international basis,
for it will be no good for Australian
touring teams to have their fast-
bowlers no-balled repeatedly for
throwing.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
HOLE IN THE CURTAIN
Tn London “Daily Telegraph”
David Floyd notes that
programmes beamed into the
Iron Curtain countries by the
8.8. C., Radio Free Europe,
the Voice of America and
other, smaller stations in
Western Europe have now, in
spite of attempts at jamming
by Communist authorities,
become “an accepted fact of
life” for millions of people
■living under Communism.
Floyd gives various reasons
for this, chief among them the
costliness and unreliability of
jamming; mass-production of
portable transistor - radios,
which can be easily carried
outside the jamming-areas;
and “the changes that have
taken place since Stalin died.”
It is, he says, “something new
in international relations, and
something of first-class im-
portance for the maintenance
of contact between East and
West. It has not had the
attention it deserves”:
“Little of what is broadcast
to the Communist world today
is plain propaganda. The
European broadcasts of the
8.8. C., for example, have won
for themselves a high reputa-
tion behind the Iron Curtain
largely by their scrupulously
objective presentation of
world-news. For many highly
placed officials and journalists
the 8.8. C. is the most reliable
source of news.
“The function of Radio Free
Europe, which is based in
Munich, is different. Though
it is backed by American
money, it is staffed by exiles
from the Communist world.
Their aim, in which they have
largely succeeded, is to pro-
vide a complete alternative to
the State - controlled home
radio-stations. They are not
trying to ‘project America,’ as
is the case with the Voice of
America, but to replace the
opposition that Communism
has destroyed.”
Asking what good all this
broadcasting does, Floyd
answers that “it is easier to
say what it does not do”:
“It does not bring the end of
Communisnr in Eastern
Europe visibly nearer. How-
ever powerful a weapon the
radio-transmissions may be,
they are not associated with
any organisation inside or out-
side the Iron Curtain for bring-
ing about political ends. Nor
is their message a political
message, calling for revolt
against the established order.
“The effect of the broad-
casts in this sense is only on
the minds of people, and there-
fore it cannot be accurately
N.Y. “Herald Tribune.”
A LONG, SLOW THAW.
assessed. The most that can
be said is that they keep alive
an awareness of Western demo-
cratic ideals and that they are
a living witness to the interest
of the Western world in the
fate of the peoples living under
Communism.
“But there are some more
tangible effects. So long as the
Communists know that their
peoples have access to uncen-
sored news from the outside
world their own ability to
suppress unpalatable news is
restricted. In recent years the
news-service of radio and press
in Communist countries has
become much more full, be-
cause editors know that they
cannot suppress news abso-
lutely.
“The broadcasts also help
the people of Communist
countries to know more about
what is happening among their
Communist neighbors. It is
more difficult to dragoon the
peasants of Czechoslovakia into
collective farms if they know
that their fellows in Poland
are being left to farm privately.
“The fact that the authorities
cannot prevent radio from
breaching the Iron Curtain
causes the Communists much
pain. They make frequent com-
plaints about interference in
their domestic affairs, and
they have even succeeded in
winning some Western support
for their point of view. But so
long as the Kremlin shows no
signs of abandoning the use of
radio to stir-up trouble
throughout the world, and
especially in such areas as the
Middle East, Africa and
South-east Asia, it has no case
for demanding that Western
broadcasts be stopped. The
most it can do is to jam them.”
U.K. Election
Selections from editorials
on the announcement of
October 8 as the date for the
next U.K. general election:
London “Daily Telegraph” :
“All parties, of course, are
starting-off by declaring them-
selves favorites. Mrs. Castle
has just told the T.U.C. that
Labor can only be defeated by
itself —and there is a curious
degree both of truth and of
probability in that pronounce-
ment. The Liberals are, very
properly, more modest. They
do not claim that they will be
able to form a Government.
Probably their utmost hope is
to hold the balance of power;
and that means that the election
must be a very close-run thing
between Conservatives and
Labor.
“Claims coincide with
conviction only in the Con-
servative party. Its confidence
is based not only on the show-
ing of public-opinion polls but
on the contrast between its
own array and the disarray of
its opponents. Growing
numbers of people both at
home and abroad are con-
vinced that a Labor-party
victory would be disastrous, if
only because it would entail
the resumption of runaway
inflation and a renewal of
adherence by British policy to
dogmas instead of facts. That
is the answer to people who
think this is going to be a dull
election without dramatic
issues. Anybody who ques-
tions what are the differences
between parties, and if the
Socialists won, would soon
find out.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “If
it is not easy to see how Labor
can take up the running be-
tween now and October 8, only
sworn Tories will simply jump
for joy because of this. It is
not a good thing in a Parlia-
mentary democracy for the
same party to rule for a dozen
years or more ; it is bad for
winners and for losers —and,
in the end, for the country.
“What is more, the mood
which looks like sweeping the
Tories back to power yet
again is mixed with a deal of
illusion. It is just not true that
our Conservative rulers have
hit upon panaceas for either
prosperity or peace. Some very
good luck has played as large
a part as good management in
their several successes. And
no amount of the showmanship
which is nowadays the garb of
statesmanship, if not the sub-
stitute for it, can disguise a
longish list of unsolved
problems, and likely failures,
home and colonial and foreign.
The Tories have still a lot more
to learn about living in the
world of 1959 and after.”

speakers will need to remember
is that prosperity alone is not

\
Every year about this time we get a clearer
view of the Australian economy. It is the
“looking-glass” season that coincides with our
southern Spring.
With returns for the June year completed, we
are in a position to appreciate the past and
evaluate the future. Allowing for the lights and
shades that are in every reflection, I think it will
be agreed that a picture of real prosperity in
Australia has come into focus.
The new wool-selling season opened on higher
prices, adding much to the brightness. Wool is
still our chief export earner; and with the promise
that the 1959-60 wool-clip will be the highest ever,
it could earn us more than half of our export
income from merchandise this year.
A spectacular rise in beef shipments has taken
our meat exports up to an all-time record in both
volume and value.
A heavy wheat crop stands ripening. Our
main British market in sugar, another major
export, is assured. The year’s report is good of
other land industries that are important in both
exporting and import-saving directions.
The value of last year’s overall production
did not, of course, match the handsomely higher
output recorded; but on current trends —as, for
example, in wool and beef—l believe that 1959-60
will be more rewarding in the contribution it will
make to Australia’s prosperous advancement.
Manufacturing is more diversified and is
expanding. Mining enterprise is at the rim of
the most exciting mineral development this
country has known. Internal commerce is thriving,
and capital investment continues to flow in
from abroad.
In the midst of this cheerful scene, it is well
to remember that Australia’s stable progress,
stated in figured terms, must always be related to
rate at which we are bringing our national resources
out into fuller production.
The outlook, assuredly, is bright. And that
is just one more reason why we should quicken
the drive that has brought us up to the prospect we
are able to view now with freshened confidence.

enough as a political platform.
There is an American saying
that ‘You don’t shoot Santa
Claus’; it is a false saying. In
the history of elections Santa
Claus has been riddled with
bullets. In 1955 prosperity was
a stronger appeal than it is
today because then it stood
in such sharp contrast with
the austerity of the Labor
Government. That memory is
now dimmed ; this is not an
election in which the shrewder
Conservative candidates will
be found waving ration-
books.”

Edinburg h “Scotsman”:
“Perhaps the greatest impon-
derable of this election is the
effect on the Government’s
popularity of Hola Camp and
Nyasaland. The Government’s
colonial record has been
generally good, but issues of
national conscience were
several times raised in a way
that caused many people pain-
ful conflict.
“Nyasaland seems likely to
remain a live electoral
issue at least in Scotland, where
it will certainly influence the
result. High unemployment
and neglect of Scottish issues
also make Scotland a danger-
point for the Government,
though there may still be time
to repair some of the damage
if Scotland can be given con-
crete assurances before election-
day.”

London “Time and Tide” :
“There are many uncertain
factors. One is the growing
and dangerous contempt for
Parliamentary institutions, re-
sulting partly from two Parlia-
ments in which the independent
member has almost, though
not quite, been eliminated. Not
unconnected with this is the
question-mark posed by the
Liberal voters in some 200 con-
stituencies. As they have
recently been pointing out, in
the last eight by-elections they
have fought, the Liberals have
been first once, second three
times, and forfeited one
deposit. This may partly result
from a skilful choice of con-
stituencies, and it is as yet im-
possible to tell how wisely the
200 have been chosen.”
Aircraft Outlook
As seen by London “Finan-
cial Times,” the planes on
view at the British aircraft
industry’s annual exhibition at
Farnborough reflected “the
difficult phase of readjust-
ment” through which the
industry is still passing.
“Behind it lie the years of
high defence - production.
Ahead lie the .uncertainties of
the stiffest-ever battles in world
markets for new orders for civil
and military aircraft, engines,
and guided weapons.”
Many of the planes exhibited,
the same paper continues,
“result from contracts placed
some time ago and which are
now running down. When
these finally come to an end,
there will be little, and in
some cases nothing, to replace
them. The principal new
requirements for military air-
craft for the years ahead-
such as the Lightning fighter
and its associated trainer, the
TSR-2 Canberra bomber re-
placement, the NA-39 naval
fighter, the Victor bomber, the
Argosy and Britannic
freighters, and the principal
guided weapons—have already
been determined, and the con-
tracts either placed or pro-
mised.
“While there may still be
some as-yet-unfilled require-
ments —such as a vertical take-
off fighter for the R.A.F.—
these are few in number, and
probably also small in size.
Companies which have not
been fortunate in the fight for
new orders so far, therefore,
face a bleak future in the
military field.
“This has been recognised,
and an increasing proportion
of the industry is seeking to
insure its future by concentrat-
ing on civil types. But even
here the outlook is uncertain.
The Britannia and Viscount
lines are already coming to
an end, and while there are
several new types coming
forward—such as the Vickers
Vanguard and VC-10, the
Airco DH-121, the Armstrong
Whitworth Argosy and the
Fairey Rotodyne—which are
showing considerable promise,
the companies concerned are
going to have a hard fight to
translate that promise into
firm orders.
“It is clear that the industry
has not yet reached the
bottom of the decline in its
labor-force. It is equally
obvious that its reorganisation
into fewer units, concentrating
on fewer projects, still has
some way to go, no matter
whether this takes the form of
direct amalgamations, or loose
associations of companies
building specific aeroplanes.
“How long this process of
readjustment will continue is
uncertain. The rapid growth
of the guided-weapons pro-
gramme, and the slow emer-
gence of astronautics, are


already opening new fields of
activity and thereby easing a
little of the strain on the
industry. Futhermore, major
projects on which decisions
have yet to be taken by the
Government such as the
supersonic airliner—could do
much to revitalise the industry
almost overnight, and indefi-
nitely defer, if not preclude,
much of the redundancy and
rationalisation now in prospect.
In the meantime, the industry
is not only aware of its diffi-
culties but also of its oppor-
tunities.”
Soviet Economic Task
/Concluding a lengthy survey
of present Soviet living-
standards, London “Econo-
mist” notes that “broadly
speaking, Russia must achieve
three things to match Western
standards” :
“It must increase the pro-
ductivity of its farms and so
release manpower for other
employment. It must devote
still more resources to housing.
And it must shift a higher pro-
portion of investment to
durable goods, including cars.
“Mr. Khrushchev knows that
he can speed-up this process
by international agreement. A
deal on disarmament would
release resources, and increased
imports from the West would
help while Russia was build-
ing-up its own production of
consumers’ durables. He will
be under pressure to get all he
can, because Russia is aiming
at a moving target ana not (as
has here been assumed for the
sake of the argument) a
stationary one.
“But the Soviet Union has
advantages as well. As a late-
comer it can benefit from the
experience of other countries.
Its problems in satisfying the
wants of Russian consumers
are relatively new, but it con-
fronts them with a highly
skilled and diversified engineer-
ing industry. And it may draw
advantage from this new era
of technological change in
which, perhaps, aircraft or even
lockets will take the place of
coaches ; helicopters may sub-
stitute for cars; and atomic
energy and automation may
open-up new industrial vistas.
While the Soviet challenge can
rightly be cut down to size, all
experience suggests that it
should not simply be dismissed.
“It may be objected that
such economic changes in
Russia will have political con-
sequences, that as daily troubles
diminish and leisure and
culture increase, the Russians
will claim a greater say in the
political life of their country.
Why should Mr. Khrushchev
bother to keep up with the
Joneses, if this might spell the
doom of the present political
system ?
“It is quite probable that a
new deal for consumers will
ultimately mark the end of
Khrushchevism, just as the
earlier economic and social
development undermined the
bases of Stalinism. But that
will not stop it. The political
perspectives that might be
opened-up in the Soviet Union
are one of the most tantalising
possibilities of ‘peaceful com-
petition’ in living - standards.
For Washington, London,
Paris or Bonn to argue that
VICKY, IN LONDON “EVENING STANDARD.”
a race in armaments would be
preferable to competition in
living-standards w'ould be im-
plicitly to admit Mr. Khrush-
chev’s premise that Russia is
bound to catch-up. The West
is capable of finding the answer
to Mr. K.’s challenge for the
nineteen-seventies for itself.”
End of the Veto?
TX/hile welcoming the U.N
™ Security Council’s ap-
pointment -pf the sub-com-
mittee of four —from Japan,
Italy, Argentina and Tunisia —
to inquire into the situation in
Laos, the Manchester
“Guardian” notes that “by its
methods of achieving these
benefits, the Security Council
may have done to the United
Nations harm that will long
outlive the present troubles.
“In brief, the Western
members (with a Western
member in the chair) made a
procedural matter of the
policy they wanted, and so
withdrew it from reach of the
Soviet veto. Now that the way
has been shown, it seems likely
that with a little ingenuity
almost any resolution could be
worded as a procedural one ;
that would mean the virtual
end of the veto.
“ ‘We have just witnessed
the beginning of the revision
of the United Nations Charter,’
said the Soviet member after
the vote had been taken; in
fact there has been a gradual
attrition of Soviet power in
the Council over a number of
years. The Soviet Govern-
ment has sometimes misused its
veto infuriatingly, and the
United Nations was strength-
ened when, by evolving its
‘uniting for peace’ procedure,
it called the General Assembly
in to redress the balance. But
that is very different from
letting the veto die of inanition,
for the veto, being a recogni-
tion of the facts of power, is
essential to the proper work-
ing of the United Nations as
the organisation is at present
constituted.
“The over-clever tactics of
the Western members had the
additional disadvantage of
destroying any hope of help
from the Soviet member in
dealing with Laos;'Mr. Sobo-
lev was fighting not merely
against a resolution to appoint
a committee but also against a
procedure that would perman-
ently cripple him and his suc-
cessors. The hope may have
been dubious, and the sacrifice
worth while; whether it was
right to let go so lightly a
major piece of United Nations
machinery only time will
show.”
Recalling the recent com-
paratively fruitless fact-finding
visit to Laos of some British,
French and US. military
attaches, London “Spectator"
finds itself unable even to
work-up much hope about the
value of the sub-committee’s
inquiry:
“It would have been better
had we [the West] persuaded
the Laotian Government to
accede to the Soviet Union’s
quite sensible request, made at
Geneva (and to which we had
no strong objection), that the
International Control Commis-
sion, which has a wider back-
ground-knowledge of the area,
should be reconvened to look
into what is going on there.
(Or to galvanise Seato, whose
job it is to defend the terri-
torial integrity of Laos, to
find out whether that integrity
is being threatened.)
“Whatever the present sub-
committee’s findings, they will
be suspect to the Soviet bloc—
or open to its propaganda
charges of partisanship
whereas the International
Control Commission had a
Polish member (its other two
members were Indian and
Canadian). And there is
reason to believe that the
Soviet Union would be glad of
an opportunity, at this par-
ticular juncture in international
diplomacy, to have the Laos
affair either cleared-up or
proved to be no more than
the little local fuss that it is
still hoping it is.
“The Soviet delegate’s delay-
ing-action at the Security
Council was more in defence
of the veto than an attempt
to block action on Laos: it
would hardly suit Mr. Khrush-
chev’s book for the sub-com-
mittee to produce evidence of
Communist aggression when he
is in Washington, or enter-
taining Mr. Eisenhower to
Moscow. Indeed, he may well
be wishing now that he had


arranged to drop-in on Peking
before going to Washington,
instead of after —that is, if the
Chinese really are behind the
scrapping on the frontier;
though even if they are, and
they could be persuaded to
call it off, it is presumably
harder to stop illiterate jungle
dwellers having a bash at each
other for a time, assuring them
that it is in the interests of
the higher diplomacy that they
should, than it must have been
to set them off.”
Indonesia
/Commenting in London
“Time and Tide” on the
Indonesian troubles of the past
few months, Rex Malik notes
that “the fundamental Indo-
nesian problem, which every-
one does their best to ignore,
is the lack of a national
identity and character amongst
the Indonesian people. The
geographical problem alone:
over 3000 islands, set in much
more than a million square-
miles of water, would strain
the organising ability of the
technically most advanced, the
most disciplined and the most
homogeneous of peoples, which
Indonesians are not.
“Indonesia is not a nation in
the Western sense of the term,
for its people tend to think
much more in regional and
local terms than in national.
Neither the arbitrary imposi-
tion of a unitary State struc-
ture by a central Government
too weak to enforce it, nor the
federal ‘economically auto-
nomous States’ solution put
forward by the rebels shows
any signs of making it so.
“There was, of course, a
time when this was easily
possible, but, having spent four
years getting rid of the Dutch,
it was not to be expected that
anything left behind would
continue for long. It was
fundamental to Dutch Colonial
policy that Indonesia was not
one nation but a diverse collec-
tion of tribes. Though the
Dutch Administration was a
centralised one, it managed to
control ‘The Indies’ by the
usual colonial practice of
disturbing the social fabric as
little as possible.
“Ultimately again the
usual colonial form—Dutch
power rested on force. That
force was exerted from
Batavia, but Batavia was
really no more than the
instrument of The Hague.
As so often happens in ‘anti-
colonial struggles,’ the absence
of any effective Indonesian
centre to transfer loyalties or
power to was obscured by the
struggle itself.
“To this refusal to recognise
the diversity of Indonesia, one
can directly trace the resultant
chaos. Chaos which is not con-
trolled but aggravated by the
undertrained, swollen civil
service (from 150,000 to over a
million in less than 20 years)
and armed forces. (It’s ironic
to think that the Dutch kept
order with 30,000 men ; today
Djakarta can’t keep order with
over a quarter of a million.)
“As a result the second most
prosperous country in Asia is
nearly bankrupt, and is kept
alive by foreign loans. Pro-
duction is below pre-indepen-
dence level, much aid is mis-
used or often allocated to rela-
tively unimportant projects and
the 20th-century apparat
of Indonesia goes only by fits
and starts.
“Meanwhile, the majority of
people in the villages potter on,
certainly no better off than they
were before. Meanwhile also,
the few reins of Government
that are left come more and
more into Army hands, the
Communists dig-in and wait,
and the civilian governmental
machine grows more and more
isolated from its own people.
“For the major problem
facing Indonesia is no longer
colonialism but making inde-
pendence work. It won’t until
Indonesians can agree amongst
themselves what sort of
country it is they all want. The
rest of Asia has found this out,
there’s no reason to suppose
that Indonesia won’t, too.”
Dragnet Digest
London “Time and Tide”:
“In a radio-broadcast on
alcoholism Radio Moscow-
said : ‘While in capitalist
countries the spectre of de-
pression and unemployment
pushes the desperate into the
arms of alcohol, it is ebullient
lust for life that makes the
Soviet citizen reach for a
bottle.’ ”

Walter Lippmann, in N.Y.
“Herald Tribune” : “The rela-
tions between Red China and
the Soviet Union are not
healthy. It is a peril to the
peace of Asia and of the world
that the Chinese revolution,
which is in a highly expan-
sionist phase, should be repre-
sented in the international
order only by the Soviet
Union. It is evident that the
enormous revolutionary con-
vulsion will not be and
probably cannot be restrained
by the Soviet Union. Yet the
Soviet Union will not and
cannot stand aside and allow
the United States and its allies
to attempt to contain that revo-
lution.
“In the talks with Mr.
Khrushchev it is possible to
imagine how coexistence might
be stabilised in Europe. But it
is not possible to imagine, so
it seems to me, how r coexistence
can be stabilised on the peri-
phery of the Chinese revolu-
tion.”

Ronald Payne, in London
“Daily Telegraph”: “France
now feels confident of her
capability to become a nuclear
Power. Her leaders even boast
that it is better to have a com-
pletely French-made bomb and
not to feel beholden to
foreign helpers. In terms of
military power the bomb
cannot become effective for
years yet, but as a diplomatic
lever it is already a force in
being, which earns for France
the right to be consulted in
nuclear affairs.
“President de Gaulle believes
that the explosion in the
Sahara, when it comes, will
convince [U.S.] Congress that
‘substantial progress,’ the
price of a share in American
secrets, has been achieved. The
Americans and the British now
see there is no way of prevent-
ing France from having her
bomb, and the only policy now
possible is to encourage her
to go ahead and play a full
part in the alliance.”
* * *
London “Economist”: “Most
probably the North Vietnamese
are engaged in Laos in a sap-
ping and mining operation
which may last for many years,
and in which political opposi-
tion to the Laos Government
will be supported by subversion,
and the subversion helped-out
on occasion by military force,
until one day, as the Commu-
nists must hope, Laos will rot'
and fall off the tree ; and when
that is done, South Vietnam
will be more vulnerable than
it is now, and the union of
Vietnam under Communism
can take place.
“The West’s answer is to
help and encourage Laos, and
its non-Communist neighbors
in South-east Asia, to refuse
to rot. The situation is not one
that is likely to be soluble by
conventional military means.
Nor is there any reason to
suppose that its solution would
be made any easier if Com-
munist China were forced to
share the blame for what is
going on with the South Viet-
namese, or if Soviet Russia
were forced to share the blame
with China. It is always tempt-
ing to simplify such an issue
by generalising it into a world
crisis.”
* * ♦
London “Economist”: “As
with the leaders of Germany
and Japan in the last genera-
tion, the leaders of Russia
may feel dimly and resent-
fully aware that the only
rational alternative to bidding
for world domination will
eventually be to accept a status
as one middling nation-State
among a good many. On the
plane of individual sentiments,
too, these b rashly confident
and nationalistic Russian
leaders are almost a caricature
of the leaders of other coun-
tries when they reached the
prickly stage of technological
maturity. Mr. Khrushchev
has some clear and embarrass-
ing affinities with Teddy
Roosevelt and Britain’s mid-
Victorian believers in Re-
morseless Progress.”

London “Financial Times”:
“The rapid increase in world
populations is going to pro-
duce a considerable pressure
on potential food-supplies.
But the signs are that —at least
in the foreseeable future —it
is the distribution of available
food among those most in
need, rather than the absolute
quantity available, that will be
the real problem.
“But even this will not solve
the major worry, which many
of the poorer countries (who
at best have only made half-
hearted attempts to control
the birthrate) face. This is the
vicious circle in which a high
rate of population-growth pre-
vents individual prosperity
from rising, and at the same
time the failure to increase
individual prosperity prevents
a natural fall in the birthrate.”

lifted the canvas shroud on
the billiard-table and conceived
ourselves with noses to the
baize, rumps to the conserva-
tory ; accepted a handful of
cherries from George (his
name was George?); dipped
cherries in each other’s second
aperitif, remembered the rest
of our money and the rest
of the world to spend it in,
laughed ourselves out.
T ater, we sought somewhere

place after place ; made much

there was no need to decide

for the day itself had decided
from the earliest that Cafe Hoi-
San alone was ideal. Actually,
that is how I had decided . . .
from the earliest. Is that how
. . - right from the earliest . . .
you had decided? *
It was for the exhilaration
of seeing their mere fa?ades
that we allowed the wind to
scramble us from cafe to
cafe . . . The Oberon , wearing
its Buckingham Palace carpet
with a musty air; its two
tables in the window everlast-
ingly set with perished damask,
stagnant silver and Bishop’s
Mitre table-napkins. Diners?
Never a diner, never! . . .
The Unique, noisy with the
badinage of freckled waitress
and pasty taxi-drivers gobbling
stewed black meat and strong
tea ... The Oxford, whose
cubicles with the gravy-greasy
hangings of brown poplin
were never occupied, but whose
infinity of circular tables -were
at all hours surrounded by
gloomy men all over middle-
age, all silent except for the
frizzling of soup through their
old-fashioned moustaches, all
eating everything of their
shilling’sworth to the last
quadrel of damp bread, all
spilling Worcestershire
sauce . . .
The Wild Cherry, where
genteel breaths puffed the
pollen of Iceland poppies from
factory biscuits, and “No, I'll
pay today, dear—if you feel
like that, you can pay next
time,” came from lips that
opened and shut with the mean-
ness of purses of pennies . . .
La Tosca, reeking and hot,
where, under a molten oiliness
like the grease on minestrone,
Hebrew violinists displayed the
black wounds of their nostrils
to each other and the newest
art-students stuck their san-
dalled feet in the aisles and
inquietly wondered if that was
— were —was the way to pro-
nounce Utrillo . . .
Do you recall what all these
restaurants meant to us as
background for ourselves, how
once, to a waiter with a thread-
bare suavity and a long, tired
nose, we were, for pity’s sake,
with sham French accents, the
lone diners at The Oberon?
On that day, however, from
the earliest there was no doubt
anywhere, that we should eat
at Cafe Hoi-San.
The two plump Japanese
waitresses fascinated us: the
one with gold-rimmed spec-
tacles who would not be able
to quench her jolliness, even,
we imagined, in childbirth;
the other who yearned when
things were at a jingling, chat-
tering peak, yearned at all
times, for something we could
not visualise, just yearned.
The mauve walls, 20ft. high
and hung with flat china
flower-holders the shape of
carp and butterflies, the paper
napkins with chrysanthemums
dashed upon the corners, the
unreal spaghetti and roast sir-
loin and sago plum pudding,
the briny coffee in tumblers
embossed with fuchsias, did it
not always seem a game rather
than a restaurant and a busi-
ness, as though it had all been
taken that day, newly-painted
and odorous of the toymaker’s
factory, from a cardboard box
and a nest of paper hay?
At the end of the incredibly
clean coconut-matting that ran
from the door straight between
the avenue of tables was the
stairway. It was nearly per-
pendicular and the doll-heads
of children bobbed up and
down like rubber fruit over
the balustrade.
They giggled, and imme-
diately—you remember? —an
old woman, shrunken and
agile, and pallid as a marrow,
hair lacquered parsimoniously
on her knob of scalp, and a
twist of hair, a black golf-ball,
on her nape, would dart from
behind the foot of the stairs —
the kitchen! —and squeak at
them. Piff, the dolls were
gone and the little old woman.
We were determined —to this
day I am determined —-that she
squeaked, “Hoi-San!” Then,
after a scuffle like a puppy’s,
after a rustle like cellophane’s
. . . giggle, giggle . . . “Hoi-
San!” Were you able,
ultimately, to settle whether
the waitress and the dolls and
the squeaking one were Japan-
ese or Chinese, whether some
were perhaps the one and the
other or others the other? I
never was.
Before we left that place do
you remember how we dis-
covered that the rest of our
money had gone —lost, given
away, scattered away, spent —
heaven knows how, gone?
We laughed—was it realisti-
cally? I had to promise, with
charm flashed on as though it
were an electric-torch, to
return the next day with the
money for that day’s meal. I
clutched the fez almost self-
consciously ; the smile of the
tiny ancient man . . . Japan-
ese? . . . Chinese? ... at the
ornate cash - register was
smeared with a suggestion of
disbelief, of resignation. Poor
smile!
I have'never returned. The
dolls will be men or dead, the
waitresses, the old woman, the
china carp who knows
where? The misproportioned
room itself will be a shop
enmeshed in birdcages and
wire fern-baskets? A shop
with copies of The Decameron
and Alberto Moravia, with
physical - culture magazines
open at girls holding their
breasts . . .
Did the wind seem colder to
you outside, imperceptibly
colder, to glitter rather than
sparkle, to show porcelain
teeth and not ivory? Did you
feel that your cemetery bird

know that I, for the briefest
moment, felt the fez on my
scalp, realised that I had re-

abashments and wiles of
penury no less than to its
purities and exhilarations.
Indeed, we had never had just
enough money, there seemed
small possibility that we ever
should — we.
Did it bubble to the surface
of your mind that each of us,
two units irrevocably sun-
dered, would need to sell in
different directions? I s\year
that at that moment nothing
wavered to the surface of my
mind ; perhaps deep down in
the gas-filtering mud an
elusive stir . . . nothing fur-
ther. It was surely so with
you for, within a fraction after
fleeing from the resentful cash-
register, we were inches above
the footpath once more, were
on our way to nowhere else,
rhapsodic over the ruby rings
and lockets, the concertinas
and tan riding-boots in a
mont-de-piete.
The glory of the afternoon
waxed, whirled in expanding
circles, and then span inwards,
concentrated itself on a fluid
axis, became more, more, more
vivid and scalding. And then,
somehow, as though the road
straight as a ray had cascaded
without warning, we hurtled —
our hands fleeting and pulsing
in arabesques on each other’s
body—into a frenzy of radiance
that burst about us in a rage of
brilliant splinters.
And afterwards we lay,
hand touching hand tastelessly,
on my bed—or was it yours?
And I talked. I remember that
vividly because what I talked
of was vivid to me. It was all
to happen to us; it seemed to
happen as I told it . . .
came, late at night,
newly-married, to an inn
somewhere in a wine-warm
country, walked to the inn
through moonlight. We walked
quietly, weary with sun and
love, on a road of deep white
dust between waves of milky
barley. At the inn they led us
with somnolent volubility, with
soothing gestures (they had ex-
pected us, though they knew
nothing of us) through drowsy
arches.
We followed hand in hand.
There was a table, dark as
smoke, smoothed and silkened
by sun-soaked, wine-veined
hands. The table was set in a
room; there were pillars be-
tween rounded arches along
two sides where great bunches
of grapes black and cold
weighed down against the
moonlight from whence floated
moths of black velvet. There
were a little lamp and a
bubble of wine and a huge vase
of majolica blues and greens
and whites filled with lemons.
Arundo grew between the
cracks of the paved floor, and,
perched on a wardrobe carved
with amoretti was a peacock,
heavy with dreams and silence.
In the corners were faint
breathings, plum-dark shadows
or hounds sleep-sighing . . .
And, after a while, when we
had drunk wine, we walked
out, hand in hand still, carry-
ing a few lemons in a net of
string. And now we began to
hurry, down a slope, to hurry
between the depths of barley,
swiftly and silently in the white
dust. Oh, silently, swiftly, as
though we had received a
summons.
But the wind heard our
silence, by the olives the wind
heard —flung up his head from
the fields and the feathers of
trees and wrenched out his
bitter blue blade. Ah! The
moon hardened, grew small,
white as almond. Wind! He
struck his sword on the lake,
cut it, slashed it. The stones
rang with our footsteps. The
boatman, sleepy and ardent,
rose from his waiting and wel-
comed us with succulent eyes
under grassy brows. Where
would we travel on this night,
on this lake ; where would we
travel, we who were newly
married? Away—away with
the wind away over the
sword-sliced lake, the wind-
wounded waters —to islands —
to morning to white steps
where lizards jewelled and blue
as water sleep beside water
blue as jewels . . .
You will remember the
silence withering, the falling
apart of hands, the hesitation
on the unseen borderline, the
inhaling of breath, the cry we
both made, together without
thought, the sudden words
ejected up from within us:
“Who will pay the boat-
man?”
Over . . . over, for ever.
T\o you remember, when we
turned-on the brownish
electric light not long after this
vagitus, after we had untruth-
fully consoled each other, had
sworn facile this and glib that,
that you looked at me and I
looked at you as though we
had not seen each other before,
as though the first chapter had
been read and now the second
had to be.
I remember we both said, on
parting, “Tomorrow! ” and
meant tomorrow. But I
cannot be sure if I remained
listening to the death of your
footsteps, remained open-eyed
hour after hour in the dark
striving with something while
you walked up and down
streets despairingly in search
of something or if you were
left to wind your hands in your
hair while I stumbled round
corner after corner, always the
same corner, the same beggar
wind thrusting a filthy news-
paper at me, the same drunken
street-creature unlatching its
mouth at me . . .
I cannot think why it was
that I could not call on you
next day, for a few days. There
was something then “unavoid-
able,” something that then
magnified to importance, that
now strips of value. When I
could call you were gone. You
had left a message: you would
see me as soon as you were
settled, and found a new place.
You would see me in a few
days ...
Within a few days I was
driven from my cell, leaving
a note for you that, even then,
I knew would be mislaid before
I was out of vision . . .
It seemed so monetary, our
absence from each other . . .
in a week or two . . . perhaps,
the week after . . .
Is that how you felt?
I remember, after these years,
that you said, “Tomorrow!”
Do you remember, after
these years, that I also said,
“Tomorrow!” Do you? Do
you?

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The Never-Never Land
Noting the sale of Elsey
Station (N.T.), scene of Jeannie
Gunn's popular book We of
the Never Never , Sydney
“Sunday Telegraph” came up
with the statement that Mrs.
Gunn, when producing her
story in 1908, “invented a new
name, the Never Never, now
firmly established in the Aus-
tralian lexicon.”
That assertion is, of course,
unfair to “the Little Missus,”
and it’s well that she, now 89
and living quietly in her
cottage at Hawthorn (Vic.),
doesn’t have her peace dis-
turbed by the vagaries of the
Sydney press.
Mrs. Gunn would be the last
person to claim to have “in-
vented” the term Never-Never.
It was in print more than 20
years before she went to the
Elsey, and all she did was to
adopt it, add a personal touch,
and so produce one of the most
alluring titles ever placed on an
Australian book.
The Bulletin used the term
Never-Never, in relation to
portion of the N.T. and north-
western Queensland, at least
as early as the beginning of
1882, and a Queensland paper
(the St. George “Standard”)
tossed the term about, quite
casually, a few months before
that. What’s more, as a
Bulletin writer mentioned not
long ago, a visiting English-
man named A. W. Stirling pro-
duced in 1884 a book entitled
The Never Never Land.
The indications, therefore,
are- that “Never-Never” was
born sometime in the ’seventies.
What remains undetermined is,
firstly, the identity of the
genius who coined the term,
and secondly, whether he was
cordial or otherwise —whether
he had the idea that if you
once lived in the region you
never-never wanted to leave it,
or whether the suggestion was
that if you got out of the area
you took care never-never to
return.
It’s rather odd, by the way,
that although remarks on
Elsey Station bob-up fre-
quently, they never include
reference to the man from
whom the place took its name,
and who, in fact, was quite a
worthy young fellow.
Joseph Ravenscroft Elsey,
English-born, qualified as a
surgeon about 1850 and
appears to have migrated to
Australia soon afterwards. In
1855 he became attached, as
surgeon and naturalist, to A. C.
Gregory’s expedition from the
Northern Territory around the
coast to south-eastern Queens-
land. Early in that trek an un-
labelled tributary of the Roper
River was found, and Gregory,
already impressed by his youth-
ful assistant, “christened” it
Elsey Creek, a name that was
adopted many years later for
the station established in the
area.
Elsey didn’t stay much
longer in Australia. Getting
the idea that the West Indies
might improve his health, as
well as give him scope for fresh
work in natural history, he
“I insist on another salesman —I just know I Wear
size-three !”
went there after leaving
and there he died, of
a lung-complaint, in 1858. He
was then aged only 24.
During the northern expedi-
tion Elsey discovered several
new birds (including the beau-
tiful golden-shouldered parrot),
and the ornithologist John
Gould, when naming these
species, declared that if their
young discoverer had lived
longer “he would certainly have
distinguished himself greatly in
one or other branch of the
natural sciences.” Siosal
(N.S.W.).
Sobriety Tests
Professor Wright’s sugges-
tion of “a sound color-film
taken of the driver at the time
of an accident rather than
blood- dr breath-tests for
.sobriety” (B. 16/9/’59) sounds
both impracticable and useless.
Consider what would be
needed to make “an immediate
record of the driver’s physiologi-
cal behavior” in a color-film
with sound-track. A camera-
outfit, with skilled operators,
would have to be on the spot
within a few minutes of the
accident; this would necessitate
many outfits, with operators,
standing-by day and night at
strategic points within a given
metropolitan area. Camera-
men would have to accompany
police to all accidents in case
a “driving-under-the-influence”
charge arose: it would be
pointless having them arrive
half-an-hour or so later.
Even these arrangements
would cover only about half a
State’s accidents, many of
which happen in country areas,
where camera-outfits couldn’t
possibly be kept available.
Costs would be very heavy —
probably far more for each
outfit than to keep a police
road-patrol on the job ; which
would be far more effective in
reducing accidents anyhow.
Of course, cost of film could
be charged to convicted drivers;
but who would convict a driver
on the evidence of a hundred-
feet of blurry film takep—as
the prosecution would have to
concede —under conditions de-
cidedly adverse to good photo-
graphy or recording?
And if the evidence of eyes
and ears is to determine the
issue, is the secondhand im-
pression given by a film to be
preferred to first-hand observa-
tions by reputable members of
the police-force?
Blood- and breath-tests are
at least scientific, and give
quantitative results. Provided a
reasonable margin for error is
allowed, no one can claim that
their use would be unfair, or
that they could possibly indi-
cate consumption of alcohol
when none had been taken.
On the other hand, a sober
but highly - strung person,
emotionally upset by an acci-
dent, might well behave as if
he were under the influence,
and be convicted on the evi-
dence of a film. Ardoyne
(Vic.).

Singing, Bush Style
Your reviewer of the record
“Across the Western Plains,”
by A. L. Lloyd (B. 26/8/’59),
doesn’t seem to have had much
experience of bush singers.
Lloyd is a pleasant singer in
his own style, but to describe
him as “richly Australian” is
wide of the mark. To say his
style in any way resembles the
bush or traditional style is also
wrong. Lloyd may have learnt
the old style during his nine
years in Australia, but as he
was back in England for 15
years before the record was
made his memory must have
played a few tricks on him.
And I object to him being
held up as an authentic
example of how our bush songs
should be sung. There are
quite a few singers in Aus-
tralia today —mostly 'young
people who have learnt the
songs and the way of singing
them from the few' old-timers
who still remember them
who can give Clauson, Ives and
Lloyd lessons in the correct
way of traditional Australian
singing.
I wonder why it is thought
necessary to import English (or
American) singers to teach us
how to sing our own songs?
It seems like bringing shearers
from overseas to teach us how
to get the wool off. H. P.
(“Duke”) Tritton (N.S.W.).
Pharmacies
“Ceg’s” description of the
passing of the old chemist’s-
shop and the relegation of the
dispensary to a corner of it
(B. 16/9/’59) is accurate
enough.
One wonders if there is any-
thing professional about the
chemist’s craft these days.
Although Sydney University
has introduced a degree-course
in pharmacy this year, the
skill required for pharmacy
seems to be decreasing.
What is the use of the
chemist’s skill and knowledge
of the qualities of ingredients,
and of how to mix and
measure, if he is called upon to
do no more than take several


fluid-ounces of liquid from a
bottle or to count 50 tablets?
Over the past three years I
have presented about 30 pre-
scriptions to my chemist.
None of them required him to
mix anything. He was merely
directed to place a certain
quantity of a medicine or oint-
ment or a number of tablets —
all proprietary lines —in a con-
tainer and to label it with my
name and the directions ; the
latter being sometimes as un-
helpful as: “The tablets —take
as directed.”
I know he has to register
the prescription, but this and
the rest of the ritual requires
no more skill than that needed
by a hardware-salesman who
measures-out so much kero-
sene or so many pounds of
nails.
Perhaps the chemist still
shows some unusual knowledge
in his ability to read a medico's
scrawl and to translate the
abbreviated dog-Latin direc-
tions into English, but this
knowledge would be just as
redundant as his materia
medica if doctors used block-
capitals for names and Eng-
lish for their directions.
It seems to me that this
trend to proprietary lines will
mean the end of the pharmacist
as a member of a skilled pro-
fession.— M. P. S. (N.S.W.).
“Ceg’s” statement to the
effect that so far Australian
chemists have not come
round to the Yankee idea of
drug - store - cum - soda - foun-
tain reminded me.
In Australia I quaffed my
first soda-fountain drink when
at the Theatre Royal (Sydney)
“The Fortune Hunters” was
playing, with the eloquent Fred
Niblo in the lead as a soda-
jerk, and Enid Bennett gently
charming in a minor role. In
Australia at the century’s turn
only pharmacies had those
electric-illumined stained-glass
and porphyry gazebos to dis-
pense “sodas”—so yearningly
remembered as flavored with
real vanilla and strawberry, and
not with pale unrecognisable
mineral-derived copies.
As with flounder innocent of
deep-freeze, and milk unsullied
by pasteurising, we might not
taste their like again.— Old
Gippsland (Vic.).
The Wyndham Report
Might I direct the attention
of “A.J.W.” (B. 16/9/’59) to
the June, 1959, issue of “The
Sydneian” (Sydney Grammar
School’s magazine), wherein,
°n page 37, he will find an
editorial on the Wyndham
Report? This, so far as I am
aware, is the only semi-official
opinion which has so far found
its way into print. It shows
in part that others apparently
share the misgivings I have
expressed:
However excellent the recom-
mendations are, there are bound
to be difficulties and confusion
when the new system is first intro-
duced. Timetables and syllabuses
will have to be completely re-
arranged in order to meet the new
requirements. And even after this
initial confusion has subsided the
system will not succeed unless the
right attitude is adopted both by
the department and by the schools.
Education must be conceived as a
means of broadening the pupils’
minds and widening their know-
ledge, rather than as a means of
getting them through certain public
examinations. The new system, it
improperly handled, could
degenerate into a mere cramming for
“He's just mooning about."
examinations just as the present
one can. Syllabuses must be so
general as to allow schools to
arrange their courses to suit the
abilities of their own pupils. It
should be possible to give pupils
an understanding and appreciation
of subjects, rather than merely a
very temporary knowledge of
certain facts....
So we can gather that the
new system might succeed if
the department and the schools
will allow it to do so. But
what kind of people are in
charge of this department and
these schools? Are they not
themselves thoroughly indoc-
trinated products of what I
might call, without intended
offence, the public-examination
rat-race? How could such
folk have visions of magic
casements opening on to any
other seas than those of the
examination grind forlorn?
It would seem that “A.J.W.”
himself is such an indoctrin-
ated product that, apparently,
he can’t conceive any criteria
in regard to pupils’ aptitudes
other than the machinery pro-
vided by class-position, marks
and examinations.
As for his assertion that less
than half our secondary-school
pupils ever sit for a public
examination, I would remind
him that the present N.S.W.
secondary-school course lasts
five years. At the end of the
third year pupils sit for the
Intermediate, and at the end
of the fifth year for the Leav-
ing. At present the majority
of secondary-school pupils
leave after sitting, successfully
or unsuccessfully, for the
Intermediate; and it is because
the committee believes this to
be an inadequate education
that it now recommends aboli-
tion of the Intermediate and
Leaving Certificates, and re-
organisation of the secondary
course into a four-year course
with a School Certificate
(External) examination at its
end. — Sir (Q.).
Concert Rudeness
Are Sydney’s concert-goers
the rudest in the world?
Never having attended
symphony-concerts in other
States or other countries, I
can’t answer my own question.
But I do know that whenever
I use my white-series season-
ticket at Sydney Town Hall
the second half of the pro-
gramme is invariably spoiled
for me by the behavior of a
large number of other concert-
goers.
Those with trains to catch
think nothing of rising in the
middle of a movement and
thrusting their way out. Doors
in the upper galleries are per-
petually swinging to and fro.
Those who wish to stay to the
end and show their appreci-
ation with applause may, of
course, do so. Those who don’t
feel so inclined, or can’t be
bothered, turn their backs and
push their way out, talking
shrilly as they go.
The most extraordinarily
contradictory feature of this
social performance is that those
genuine music-lovers who,
through no fault of their own,
may have arrived a few minutes
late for the opening item, are
not allowed to go through to
their regular seats until the
item is over.
The last item played at a
symphony - concert is not
usually a major one, but it’s
often a favorite with some
members of the audience. My
own understanding of courtesy
is that it should be accorded
as much to the last as to the
first.— Pat (N.S.W.).
Commonwealth at Law
A curious anomaly of the
law, as it affects the rights of
persons against the Common-
wealth, cropped-up in the Vic-
torian Supreme Court the
other week when judgment was
given against the Common-
wealth on a claim for the
princely sum of £B.
The amount was alleged to
have been overpaid by the
plaintiff, a trading company,
for goods bought at a Supply
Department disposals-auction.
The company claimed it had
been charged for a particular
lot—“consisting mainly of oil-
cans” —for which it had not
bid and delivery of which it
had refused.
Commenting on the Com-
monwealth’s claim that it had
a right to be sued, even for
small amounts, only in the
State Supreme Court or the
High Court of Australia, the
judge (Mr. Justice Dean) said:
“It is scandalous that a per-
son with a claim for £5 or £lO
or £l5 is denied any relief
unless he is prepared to go
to these courts, in which, even
if successful, the costs he will
have to pay himself will not
be fully recouped.”
The lawsuit, he added, had
been “a shocking waste of the
Supreme Court’s time and of
hundreds of pounds in legal
costs,” and “something should
be done to end this unjust and
unfair position.”
The judge’s sentiments will


be echoed by many people who
feel that the old adage, “there
is one law for the rich and one
for the poor.” might well be
supplemented by the words
“and another for the Govern-
ment.”
While recourse to protection
of the law is theoretically
available to all, there can be no
question that present-day high
costs of litigation prevent, or
at least strongly discourage, all
but the wealthy from exercising
their legal rights in many
instances. In one way this is
good: it prevents the vast
majority of trivial disputes
from wasting the time of the
courts, most citizens preferring
to settle differences by the less
expensive expedient of com-
promise!
But where the Common-
wealth is concerned costs are
no deterrent; in the case
quoted—unfortunately by no
means isolated —the Common-
wealth insisted upon asserting
its legal right, regardless of
expense either to itself (which
means to the taxpayer) or to
the other party.
To the ordinary person it
must seem absurd that the
Commonwealth should insist
that legal action against it may
only be taken in a State
Supreme Court or the High
Court, though the amount in-
volved is trifling and no im-
portant question of principle
is involved.
Surely, in a matter of this
kind. the Commonwealth
should be satisfied with the
decision of an inferior court,
as would be the case where
two private persons were in-
volved.
But the principle that the
Commonwealth must defend
itself to the last ditch the
Privy Council, if necessary—
seems to have become accepted
policy. Only the Common-
wealth’s limitless purse makes
this practicable. Few people
can afford to contest, say, a
taxation decision to the limit
permissible under the law 7 .
Now that a Supreme Court
judge has drawn attention to
this anomalous situation, isn't
it up to the legal profession to
suggest a remedy? D. J. G.
(Vic.).
Strain On Pupils
Perhaps. as “Fossicker”
holds (B. 16/9/’59), Victorian
school-kids “have never been
under such a strain as they are
today,” but this certainly can-
not be said for their N.S.W.
cousins.
The primary pupil's day runs
from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. At
no stage is he bothered by any
exam, set or marked outside
“Pray join me in a pipe of peace, paleface—
it’s non-habit-forming. ”
the school, and there is very
little corporal punishment.
In secondary school his day
is half-an-hour longer, but
after deducting two hours for
weekly sport, lunch-break and
recess, his “lessons'* week
amounts to about 22 hours—
same as in the primary school
—and he spends only 42 weeks
a year at school.
After three years of second-
ary' school the pupil attempts
an Intermediate exam., set and
marked by his teachers, in six
to eight subjects. If he con-
tinues at school, he will attempt
the Leaving, taking five or six
subjects.
His father, when at school,
had the same hours and holi-
days, but much more work,
much more homework and was
under a greater strain mainly
because of the standard of the
external exams.
He had to prepare for a
“primary final*’ exam., and. if
he stayed at school, an ex-
ternal Intermediate, with a
much higher standard than the
present internal exam., in at
least eight subjects. And if he
stayed on for the Leaving he
took seven or eight subjects.
Obviously then, the strain on,
and work expected from, the
average pupil has progressively
decreased over the past 20
years. Standards have dropped
as a result, but perhaps some
of them were too high any-
how.— P. C. (N.S.W.).

daughter-in-law whose resent-
ments of each other are
enlarged and finally purged to
make way for a deep but frust-
rated family love when the war-
veteran husband gets “hooked”
for a spell by the morphine
habit and brings them all close
to ruin.
It is a fine play, loosely but
movingly argued, with deep
thrusts of emotional insight;
and Norman McVicker’s pro-
duction of it concentrates all
the qualities one has come to
expect of Pocket work: disci-
plined acting, utter sincerity of
approach, and admirable atten-
tion to detail. Perhaps the
temperaments and techniques
of the chief players—Donald
Smith, as the “junky” ; Valerie
Askew, as his pregnant wife ;
and Graham- Corry, as his
brother—lacked the strength to
carry them up into the wide
emotional atmosphere of some
of the bigger scenes, but their
work at lower altitudes was
often impressive.

“House of Lovers”
Marital infidelity is the
theme which director Julien
Duvivier handles with style and
drollery in this Zola-derived
story about a suave young man
from the provinces who comes
to a big apartment-house in
the Paris of gaslight-and-horse-
carriage days and immediately
becomes the joy of malleable
ladies and the despair of their
cuckolded husbands. The story
is crisply drafted, with urbanity
and cynicism fairly balanced ;

“The World, the Flesh and
the Devil”
This film presupposes that,
following a nuclear war, atom-
clouds have wiped-out all the
human race except three people
in New York ; but there isn’t
a trace of credibility in any
of the proceedings. Some
mysterious agency seems to
have spirited away the eight-
million New Yorkers who were
overwhelmed by the deadly
fallout, for there’s not a corpse
visible in the perfectly tidy
city. And the three survivors
are apparently immune from
rays which scientists claim
would keep on killing for years.
The whole fantasy is obviously
designed to give the old triangle
a new slant, the three being a
negro miner (Harry Belafonte),
a white girl (Inger Stevens) and
a white man (Mel Ferrer) who
comes single-handed, somehow,
from Peru in a yacht. The shots
of a completely deserted great
city are, however, impressive.

“The Two-headed Spy”
There is a full load of tension
and excitement in this English
film based on the true but
almost incredible story of
Colonel Alex Scotland, who
worked his way up through
field-command in the German
Army in World War I to
become a trusted member of
the General Staff, and who, as
Deputy-Director of Supply,
was in a powerful position to
help sabotage Runstedt’s final
offensive in the closing stages
of Hitler’s war, as well as feed
Vital information to the Allies.
The undercurrent of antago-

“Three in a Million”
In celebration of its 50th
anniversary, British Petroleum
has produced with taste and
warmth this very human story
of . three migrants, the parts
they are playing in the Aus-
tralian economy and, more
especially, how they are being
assimilated into our social
structure.
One is a Sicilian builder’s-
laborer who, battling against
expatriate loneliness in Sydney,
and eager to avoid confining
himself to a circle of com-
patriots who speak among
themselves only in their own
language, gets his feet set firmly
on the path to Australianism
with the aid of some under-
standing workmates and a girl
he meets.
The second is an English girl,
married to the ex-R.A.A.F.
manager of the A.M.P.’s land-
settlement scheme at Keith
(S.A.). The difficulties of one
used to the sheltered life of an
English city and put on her
own resources as a modern
pioneer of virgin bushland
miles from any neighbor are
traced soberly yet graphically.
The third is a German hydro-
grapher employed by the Snowy
Mountains Authority, and his
work with an international
team on Australia’s roof makes
an absorbing episode. The
commentary throughout is
excellent, and the background
score especially effective.

"Following a highly success-
ful orchid - show, floral
beauty of an entirely different
kind was concentrated at Syd-
ney Town Hall in the display of
a bewildering variety (to eastern
Staters’ eyes, anyway) of
native flowers from Westralia.
One got the impression that the
big State must be virtually stiff
with wildflowers that you
would be hard put not to tread
on ’em wherever you walked.
The varieties run into
hundreds: one enthusiast
(obviously a Groperlander)
claimed it ran into thousands.
We’ll settle for it that there
were quite a lot.
Some were doing a deep-
freeze in huge cones of ice—
varicolored loveliness im-
prisoned in glittering crystal.
But the majority were in vases,
and standing-up to being gazed
at, caressed, smelt, jostled and
even having bits pinched off.

—all with a stamina that could
be expected from flowers used
to battling against hard con-
ditions in the bush.
The red-stemmed, red-and-
green kangaroo-paws hogged
the limelight, along with
different shades of catspaws;
but no dogpaws, or even bun-
yip-paws, were visible any-
where. Brilliant heaths
flaunted their gaiety alongside
dainty, pure-white lambs’-tails
which amply justified their
monicker. There were acorn-
banksias, and these particularly
caught present viewer’s eye, not
so much by their masses of
acorns as by their elusive color.
Bachelor-buttons looked as
if they could be plucked from
their stems and parked straight
onto your rammies. There was
a one-sided red bottle-brush,
looking as if some practical-
joker had sneaked-up on it
when it was drunk on nectar,
and had shaved-off half its
beard. There were also half-
bald banksia-cones that really
should have been wearing hats.
And there were acorn-banksias
that... excuse mention of
them again, but it’s that elusive
color!
A winged-wattle had tiny
yellow flowers stuck between
slender spikes. The gorgeous
pink feather-flower was in pro-
fusion, like the Geraldton-wax
of a color-range to astonish a
New South Welshman. Drum-
sticks ; native-pomegranates;
the feathery yellow Morrison ;
the fragile, beautiful, delicate-
grey smoke-bush; white tea-
tree ; yellow grevilleas, with
their tops strikingly like a
turkey-gobbler’s wattle —they
were all there ; along with the
acorn-banksias, with their
elusive color, to which this
commentator drifted back in-
exorably, maddened at not
being able to pin-down the
hue. Then, meditating in front
of it, it all came clearly—a
lovely amber-brown, but of a
distinctive cast. A wave of
nostalgia swept him at that
point out of the hall and across
Druitt Street, straight up to the
bar of the Gresham. And there,
gazing at the stuff in a frosty
glass, he pondered sadly a
vital question: Why hasn’t

CATTLE AT MELBOURNE ROYAL
By “LOWANA”
A fter a year of rising meat-
prices from brisket to
buttock, beef-cattle had that
little extra pride of appearance
as they paraded before judges
and well-filled ringsides under
ideal conditions —a contrast to
last year when rain scattered
the crowds just before several
of the champions were chosen.
This time, Santa Gertrudis
joined the line-ups with six
worthy beasts which took the
eye for surprising meatiness—
a fact which made ringsiders
wonder whether the floppy-
eared breed would be worth
fostering for southern climes
as well as the more torrid' lati-
tudes.
However, despite the usual
glamor of yet another worthy
parade, there were one or two
disquieting thoughts. First of
all. numbers w ? ere down by

pions from a classy display had

honors were announced a few
years ago.
The consistent meritorious
victories of junior champions
over their seniors for top
honors in several breeds made
one wonder why the youngsters
do not go on to high honors in
later years. Many, of course,
go to the stud, and discard
the show-ring, but could the
success of juniors be partly
due to force-feeding on foster-
mothers whose benefits are not
maintained when the animal
graduates on to grass and con-
centrates?
The continued success of im-
ported animals and their pro
geny, especially among the
Aberdeen Angus and Dairy
Shorthorn entrants, emphasises
the value of overseas blood in
Victoria.
Many breeders believe the
need for more importations
will be felt.badly within a few
years if the import-ban is not
lifted, and as the U.K.
Minister for Agriculture
pointed out recently in Mel-
bourne, northern Spain is the
nearest country to England
which has blue-tongue disease
—the reason for the ban.
Among the dual-purpose
breeds it was a pity to see
only two studs fighting-out Red
Poll honors. This lack of great
competition suggested reduced
interest in the breed, but lead-
ing Red Poll owners claim the
breed itself is stronger than
ever. Any reduction has been
due to less use of the Red Poll
to remove the horns from other
breeds —a practice which often
did not show the breed in as
good a light as it might have,
in the crossbred progeny.
Aberdeen Angus, which led
the parade with 186 entries
from 30 breeders, maintained a
high standard, in which females
were better than the even, but
not spectacular, lot of males.
Herefords were classy ; Poll
Herefords very even. Short-
horns were very good, with a
tendency to shorter bodies; Poll
Shorthorns few in number and
slightly below previous stand-
ards. The tops from a small
entry of Devons were good,
although the breed as a whole
brought criticism for a poor
standard of parading which has
persisted for several years.
Aberdeen Angus
Females again dominated
Aberdeen Angus entries. Over-
all quality of the males was
quite good, but there were no
really outstanding top sires,
in the opinion of Mr. C. A. M.
Ross, of Glen Innes (N.S.W.),
who adjudicated.
There was very little tail in
the line-ups of either sex.
Possibly the greatest weakness
was the lack of strength from
hip to pinbone, and insufficient
let-down in the lower thigh.
This showed up more among
the males than the females.
Although not so outstanding
as last year, the most success-
ful team was exhibited by Est,
G. T. Reid, Yass (N.S.W.),
which paraded the senior and
junior female champions. As
usual, this team was excellently
prepared and paraded by an
outstanding groom.
The champion bull Pine
Grove Wallace, bred by John
Troup, of Coghills Creek, and
exhibited by S. J. Ross, of
Ellerslie, was a particularly
good sire and hard to fault.
It scored the grand-champion-
ship from Mrs. W. J. R. Wil-
son’s (Lancefield) junior-
champion Mt. William Gen-
eralissimo, mainly because of
its larger size. *
However, the younger bull
showed nice quality and could
develop into an outstanding
sire. Mrs. Wilson also entered
the senior reserve-champion,
Mt. William Todman —a half-
brother to the junior champion,
by the imported Enterprise of
Gloagburn.
Another imported sire, Jago
of Balfour, fathered Est. G. T.
Reid’s senior and junior
female champions, Narran-
gullen Roulette and N. Glimma
2, respectively. The former was
heifer champion last year-
one of the few to carry on to
senior honors. Both impressed
with their excellent heads and
quality, and claimed high
praise from the judge, who
said he doubted whether better
females could be found any-
- where.
John Jackson's (Romsey)
reserve-champion cow, Suther-
land Genista, came from the
same class as the winner, and
Hugh Middleton (Clematis)
paraded the junior reserve-
champion, Edzell Gwenda.
Both of these females were
by the imported Gwedor of
Addington.
Rupert Steele, of Dande-
nong, entered a small but
classy team which won blue
ribbons in both sexes. Other
successful breeders included
John Troup, T. H. Wood, of
Moolap, and L. J. and A. L*
Graves, of Mansfield.
Poll Herefords
Poll Herefords did not show
the usual remarkable annual
advance, but displayed excellent
uniformity and a really strong


middle-section which the
experienced judge, R. S. Wilson,
of Gladstone (Q.), said showed
excellent prospects for the
future. The preparation and
parading maintained the high
standard of the past.
Championships were shared
by seyeral studs. The top bull,
Bundilla Javelin, exhibited by
W. H. Mott, of Henty (N.S.W.),
was also grand-champion of
its sex. It showed specially
good quality of fleshing and
hindquarters, and stylish parad-
ing.
It scored senior honors from
Springfield Sergeant, entered
by S. T. and C. H. Hawkins,
of Finley (N.S.W). Strength of
meat on the backline contri-
buted to the junior-champion-
ship win of Brewarrana Dia-
mond, entered by W. J. Lene-
han, of Narrandera (N.S.W.).
This animal was also strong in
the loin, which supplies the
most expensive cuts of meat.
J. A. and D. J. Hanson’s
(Macarthur) The Braes Choice
Mixer won the junior reserve-
championship.
Although not numerically
strong, the Poll Hereford
females displayed extremely
good quality. Top cow, S. T.
and C. H. Hawkins’s Spring-
field Hyacinth 4, was a particu-
larly good matron, and proved
her quality by parading with
a calf at foot. She also had a
nice constitution and a pleasing
coat. Her superior depth
enabled her to score from the
reserve - champion, Messrs.
Hanson’s The Braes Ruby 18
—a well-fleshed entry.
K. G. Luke’s (Romsey)
junior-champion heifer, Deep-
fields Empress 5, was one of
the thickest and deepest
youngsters to appear for a long
time. Reserve junior - cham-
pion, Springfield Silver 4, was
entered by Messrs. Llawkins.
The judge had special praise
for entries in the sire’s-progeny-
group class, which, he said,
called for the closest decisions
of the day. The prize went to
the bull and two females by the
imported Beau Mixer 217,
entered by Messrs Hanson.
John H. Sleigh, of Nagambie,
and Wantabadgery station,
Wagga (N.S.W.), were among
other successful exhibitors.
Herefords
Although smaller numeri-
cally than previously, the Here-
fords were easily the best which
S. B. Reynolds, of Rosalie
Plains (Q.), has judged in Mel-
bourne. There were more top
bulls than ever before, and im-
provement was noticed in every
section.
Once again male awards
were a triumph for the South
Boorook Stud of Jim Allen,
who carried off the honor of
grand-champion for the ninth
time in eleven years, and the
fourth time in succession. South
Boorook Lawrence was the
junior-champion as well as
the grand-champion. His sire,
S. B. Brimful, won a similar
honor in Sydney in 1956, and
had two other class winners
in this year’s Melbourne Show.
He was also the father of last
year’s Melbourne junior-cham-
pion and reserve-champion.
South Boorook Lawrence
showed tremendous breed-
character, and would more
than hold its own in any Aus-
tralian show-ring. His level
topline was his chief asset in
defeating the senior champion,
South Caramut Brigadier, bred
by the famous Colly Creek
Stud and exhibited by J. E. de
Little, of Caramut. This owner
completed a good treble with
the senior-champion cow, S. C.
Corisande 12, by the imported
Billingsley Shooting Star, and
the reserve-champion heifer,
S C. Corisande 15, by South
Boorook Leominster.
Reserve-champion bulls were
exhibited by Fairymead Sugar
Co., Ltd., Mittagong (N.S.W.)
(senior) and Herbert Field
Pty., Ltd., A d j u n g b i 11 y
(N.S.W.), whose Red Hill Mel-
bourne was drawn from the
same class as S. B. Lawrence.
Fresh from success in
Adelaide, C. R. Malseed, of
Dartmoor, exhibited Ascot
Winifred 8 as the junior-
champion heifer, which went
on to take the female grand-
championship because of its
typiness and beautiful square
frame.
F. M. MacDiamid and Sons,
of Queanbeyan (N.S.W.),
showed the senior reserve-
champion cow Burra Minerva,
and F. A. Mclntyre, of Digby,
won the two-year-old heifer
class and the sire’s-progeny-
group prize.
Shorthorns
.T. Carter, of Young
(N.S.W.), was very pleased
with the slightly smaller. line-
up of Shorthorns. Quality was
very even, with fewer tail-
enders than for some time.
Most pleasing personal suc-
cess was the male grand-
championship which William-
son Bros., of Carisbrook, won
with the junior-champion
Lochinver Tarzan, which
forced its studmate L. Tartan,
a yearling, into reserve
position.
These breeders have ex-
hibited consistently for many
years without outstanding
success. Most of their entries
have received little specialised
preparation, and the acquisi-
tion of a groom to give indivi-
dual attention has probably
been a big factor in this year’s
well-merited victories.
L. Tarzan was beautifully
turned-out, and appealed
specially with his bone and
general fleshing. A superior
topline helped him to defeat
the senior-champion ICIANZ
Germanium, exhibited by
ICIANZ, Ltd., of Deer Park,
for the grand-championship.
A strong contender for the
senior-championship was the
reserve - champion Bolinda
Illinois, sired by the imported
Saltoun Nelson, and exhibted
by Sir Rupert Clarke, of
Bolinda Vale.
However, probably the out-
standing Shorthorn in the ring
was the beautifully-balanced
champion cow Dauntless
Pearly Queen, by the imported
Cruggleton Justinian, and
exhibited by W. R. Ross, of
Barnawartha.
G. Starrit and Son’s
(Mooroopna North) reserve-
champion cow Kelso Duchess
Royal was also by an imported
sire, Eri m u s Interloper.
Junior-champion heifer, Calare
Lady Glen, exhibited by O. E.
Ingrey (Henty), was bred by a
Kywanna bull. The reserve-
champion, Round Hill
Augusta Lyn, paraded by
Round Hill Pty., Ltd., of
Sydney (N.S.W.), came from
the same class. E. L. Bowen,
of Woodend, did well with his
two entries.
Bulls were better than the
heifers among the six lonely
Poll Shorthorns entered. R. G.
and D. I. Vallance, of Lake
Bolac, paraded the junior- and
grand-champion bull, Newbold
Blender’s Statesman 4, which
was bred by W. J. Dawkins
Newbold, Ltd., of Gawler
River (S.A.), from the imported
sire Lynwood Blender.
This youngster was a bit
better in the bone than its
competitors, lower to the
ground, better behind the
shoulders and a little deeper
in the flesh.
Better of the two females
was Weronee Queen, exhibited
by R. C. Forsyth, of Caven-
dish. She won because she
had a better color, was fuller
behind the shoulders, and
walked better than the other
heifer.
Devons
Devon classes were contested
by A. A. Laidlaw, of Ararat,
and Mrs. Janet Officer, of
Henty (N.S.W.). Adjudicator-
J. S. Anderson said that while
top animals were good the dis-
play suffered as a whole
because preparation and parad-
ing were not up to standard.
A. A. Laidlaw won most of
the major honors. His best
animal was the senior- and
grand-champion bull, the
imported in utero The Hill
Stockbreeder. This animal
had good fleshing and an
attractive head. It could have
been better in the legs and
have paraded better.
The reserve-champion was
a nice young animal with a
good future. It had a good
coat and a nice head, but was
slightly lacking show condi-
tion A. Laidlaw’s champion
cow was a little overcon-
ditioned, but displayed a nice
head and quarters. Mrs.

Santa Gertrudis
The six Santa Gertrudis
cattle exhibited without oppo-
sition by King Ranch (Aus-
tralia) Pty., Ltd., created a lot
of favorable interest, particu-
larly because of the fleshing
displayed. Both champions,
K. R. Edward (male) and K. R.
Duchess, were by the imported
bull Canelo and from King
Ranch (Texas) imported cows.
Dual-purpose Breeds
The appearance of only two
Red Poll breeders, Wilson
G. J. Beer and Sons, of Nan-
nella South, and T. E. N.
Payne, of Kilmore, was disap-
pointing, but the quality and
presentation were excellent.
W. K. Cowlingshaw, of Dubbo
(N.S.W.), who adjudicated, said
there was not a poor animal
in the entry.
Outstanding animal was
Messrs. Be e r’s Plymouth
Kodaklass, which won the
Adelaide championship a few
weeks ago as well as the pre-
vious two Melbourne cham-
pionships. Like the champion,
the reserve-champion, last
year's Adelaide champion, P.
Dorcas, was by a Burnwood
sire.
Messrs. Beer completed a
scoop among the females with
the junior-champion P. Fairy
by the 1959 champion bull
Glenoon Mambo, bred by
A. J. and J. R. Kendall, and
the reserve junior-champion,
P. Fruenza, by the same sire.
Sixth triumph for the stud was
the junior male-championship
with P. Prospect.
T. E. N. Payne’s major suc-
cesses were with Larkhill
Imperturbable, which now has
three Melbourne bull reserve-
championships to its credit, and
the reserve junior-champion
bull Woodburn Coronation, by
the imported Coronation
Monarch.
With the help of imported
blood to supplement their own
skill, local breeders have raised
Dairy Shorthorns to a very
high standard, which was
demonstrated by the increased
numbers which faced Gerald
Shanahan, of Myrniong
always a good stronghold of
the breed.
Mr. Shanahan commented
specially on the evenness of
the line-ups throughout. Once
again Atkinson Bros., Swan
Hill, entered the most out-
standing team, which included
the champion bull Theale
Emperor, bred by W. Cumber
and Sons in England; the
junior reserve-champion bull,
Willow Park Baron 53; the
champion cow, W. P. Moss
Rose 79, who repeated her
1958 success; and the reserve-
champion heifer, W. P. Moss
Rose 101.
In addition, Atkinson Bros,
bred W. P. Gay Lord 61, which
won the male reserve-
championship for J. Iskov and
Sons, of Strathlea. McCombe
Bros., of Horsham, were suc-
cessful with Glen Meadows
Rose 2 and G. M. Pansy,
reserve-champion cow and
champion heifer respectively.
Both are daughters of the
imported Parsenn Viscount
Wildeyes 2.
The junior-champion bull,
Riverslea Statesman 26,
exhibited by John Muir and
Sons, of Bacchus Marsh, was
also by an imported bull,
Riverslea Orma.
Individually, the champion
bull was an outstanding sire
with a nice topline, well
sprung ribs and good quarters.
The reserve-champion was a
fine specimen, but not quite as
well quartered.
The champion cow had a
little better conformation and
vessel than the reserve-cham-
pion, which, however, had an
excellent carriage. Mr. Shana-
han commented very favorably
on the line-up of 16 yearlings,
giving great promise for
the future. Most successful
exhibitors, apart from those
who won championships, were
S. T. Howe, Drouin; I. R.
McDonald, Castlemaine;
Philip Callahan, Barwon
Downs; and P. N. Hickey,
Katandra.
Dairy Cattle
In contrast to the beef-
breeds, dairy-cattle numbers
showed an increase from 1278
to 1376 in a parade where the
older cattle dominated the
major prizes. Nevertheless the
heifer-classes reintroduced by
the Royal Agricultural Society
were well supported and will
no doubt produce many future
champions.
L. C. Pollard, Wodonga,
made a sensational return to
the Melbourne show-ring by
capturing the bull-cow cham-
pionship double in a very good
showing of Australian
Illawarra Shorthorns. Mr.
Pollard has not had the time
to prepare a Melbourne Show
team since his last successful
appearance in 1937, although
he has exhibited locally.
Jerseys have rarely been
shown to better advantage —
and that’s saying something;
Friesians were good, but
showed a few too many types
for the New Zealand judge,
A. W. Montgomerie; top
Guernseys were better than
ever ; Ayrshires less numerous
but well up to standard,
especially in their vessels. The
A.I.S. entry was surprisingly
good.
Jerseys again led the field
easily, with an entry of 556
cattle, which judge Norman
Enders, of Stanhope, said was
the best show for many years.
Older classes were excellent
and most entries showed won-
derful bloom. All classes were
well presented by experienced
exhibitors. Younger cattle
showed a lot of promise.
G. and R. Cox’s (Murray-
dale) champion cow Bemer-
syde Buttercup 10 was by
Belgonia Noella 4th’s Jester.
This nice, even female was
specially strong in its attach-
ment and teat-placing, which
finally gave it a narrow victory
over the reserve-champion
King’s Vale Brunette 4,
exhibited by J. Anderson and
Son, Lyndhurst, from the same
class. The evenness of these
two entries can be gauged by
the fact that they tied for
second place in the interbreed
championship. Mr. Enders
described the reserve cow as
“very sweet.”
The champion bull, W. J.
Clark’s (Monomeith) Glen-
avon Eagle Chief, and reserve-
champion, Ballarat Orphan-
age’s Orphanage Andante’s
Goldfinder, were from the
same class. Both were good-
type animals showing good
Jersey qualities.
The winner had good shoul-
ders and middle-piece, and a
little better finish than the
reserve-champion. Mr. Enders
was very pleased with the
younger bulls. The two-year-
old class was one of the best
to have been seen in Mel-
bourne.
Other successful breeders
included C. S. Walker and
Son, Shepparton; R. C.
Broad, Sutton Grange;
Emmett Bros., Stanhope; F.
A. Burgman, Katandra West;
the well-known P. J. Maloney
and Son, Tongala ; and W. P.
Drechsler, Swan Hill, who has
just won the Victorian Herd
Championship for the second
successive year.
Guernseys were surprisingly
good—the best display of its
kind, according to the judge,
Sidney Bryant, of Boatharbor
(N.S.W.). High standards were
shown both in quality and
quantity. Tops displayed won-
derful Guernsey type, and the
cows had very good vessels.
There was a slight “tail” in
some of the younger classes.
One of the best classes was
for the aged cow in milk. This
group supplied the champion,
Vermont Pretty Polly, bred
and exhibited by the consistent
Dr. F. G. Stephens and Son,
of Vermont. This beautiful
cow showed wonderful consti-
tution and good Guernsey
type.
The reserve-champion, I. W.
and L. T. Bentley’s (Sheppar-
ton) Junction Miss Tess, by a
Yarraview sire, had a wonder-
ful head, but lacked some of
the champion’s constitution
Many cows were at a dis-
advantage because they were
dry.
Balkanyle Minstrel, bred by
Mrs. M. S. L. Wiltshire,
daughter of a well-known
Gippsland studmaster, and
exhibited by L. A. Moran, of
Narre Warren, was an out-
standing bull. It captured the
championship with a beauti-
ful topline, good depth and
good hindquarters. It was
paraded to advantage. F.
Harrison, Koo-Wee-Rup, won
the reserve-championship from
the same class with his only
entry, Shady Vale Sapper, bred
by F. L. Maslen.
Although the bulls in general
were surpassed by the females,
the two top sires were among
the best the judge has seen.
Among the other successful
exhibitors were R. G. Watson,
Frankston, whose several suc-
cesses included the best
Guernsey-type cow; Clare-
mont Stud, Rochester; Miss
E. J. McKenzie, Bunyip ; Miss
I. Hearn, Rochester; and
T. W. Slater, Poowong.
Chief criticism of the
Friesians' from the New Zea-
land judge, A. W. Mont-
gomerie, was the absence of a
standard type. Nevertheless,
the exhibits were very pleas-
ing, with the magnificent line-
up of aged bulls as a high-
light.
All cows were brought-out

really good specimen of the
breed. It scored from a class-
mate, Brundee Princess Rose-
bloom —a twin —exhibited by
the well-known V. J. Lamond,
of Nowra (N.S.W.). The
latter had the disadvantage of
being dry.
The many good features of

B. Pride Mercedes included a
lot of refinement, open dairy-

qualities which the judge
sought throughput the day.
This sire beat the imported
reserve-champion Glenstuart

D. M. and C. A. Negri, of

ring. Tops among the females
were outstanding, with the
junior cows in milk putting-up
an excellent performance.
Females generally showed as
being high producers. On the
whole, they were well pre-
sented and better than the
males. Colors were good.
L. C. Pollard’s champion
cow Dongawarra Rose 13,
sired by the champion bull
Tabbagong Imitator, was an
outstanding young female with
an excellent vessel. She could
hold her own anywhere.
The reserve-champion cow
from the same stud, D.
Blossom 21, was a very good
type.
For the first time in his
career the N.S.W. judge, R. E.
Playford, awarded the male-
championship ribbon to a
pure-white bull, T. Imitator,
bred by Richardson Bros, and
exhibited by L. C. Pollard.
Although its color was not
popular this bull could not
be discarded, because of its
many other good qualities,
including good length and
N. H. Newton’s (Whorouly)
reserve-champion Ovensdale

class, was a little too low-set,
high in the tail-setting and

generally.
Other leading breeders in-
eluded A. M. Chambers,
Warrnambool; Bott Bros.,
ingwall, Dark and Gibson,
Launching Place; and H.
Arffiiew, Numuikah.
The record entry of 84 fat
cattle on the hoof brought high
praise from Godfrey Wilson,
of Dromana-a leading buyer
—who said that the marked
improvement over previous
displays was due to better
breeding and an appreciation
of what the housewife wanted.
Leading exhibitors included
J. and A. C. Bott, of Yarra-
wonga, who have made a
special study of meatiness with
their Aberdeen Angus animals.
Their entries showed good
body qualities and a desirable
fat covering. Mrs. W. J. R.
Wilson, of Lancefield, also
entered some nice Aberdeen
Angus Cattle. G. Starrit and
Son, Mooroopna North ; John
H. Sleigh, Nagambie, and lan
Officer, Warrnambool, were
also among the prizewinners.
Even Laying-rate
“Sundowner”: The lean
period from April to July
upsets all poultry-producers.
So they’ll be encouraged by the
result of tests carried-out at
Parafield (S.A.) Research
Station.
Egg-to-layer over five
years have proved that an even
rate of laying can be achieved
when spring-hatched pullets
are housed in small, intensive
units. In groups of 10, pullets
averaged over 33 per cent, of
their annual production during
the winter, when egg-supplies
are short and prices high.
Birds-tested were of ordinary
strains and included all breeds.
They were hatched in Sep-
tember, reared under normal
range-conditions and fed a
standard ration. No lights
were used to obtain this high
rate of winter-lay.
Pens were built in groups,
and each unit is an intensive
shed Bft. deep and 6ft. wide.
Deep litter was used, and pens
were cleaned once a year. The
pens are equipped for auto-
matic watering and feeding,
with nests set just inside the
front and fitted with a slide so
that eggs can be collected
without entering.

Information on legal separation
in Australia ?
(a) Significance of legal separation
of husband and wife is that the
parties are not compelled to live
together or do anything for one
another except as contained in the
instrument or order separating
them. ( b ) Depends on what State
you live in. (c) Again, the State,
(d) There are two forms of separa-
tion. The most generally met with
is separation by agreement between
the parties, usually evidenced by a
deed. Where this is so the parties
are not compelled to maintain or
assist one another, but they are not
permitted to commit other matri-
monial offences, such as adultery.
The second type is judicial separa-
tion by an order of the court,
which is possible in most States
although rapidly becoming very
rare. There are no particular com-
plications except that, although
the parties are living apart, they
are not in any other respect com-
pletely free of one another and
are not free to behave as though
they were single. They must, of
course, always abide by the instru-
ment or order which separates
them.

Method o.f tanning a cord net ?
You need a tank big enough to
hold enough tannic solution to
cover the net. This tank should
have a false bottom or some such
provision inside to prevent the net
coming in contact with the bottom
of the tank —if it does, pot-burning
will result. Use enough good
tanning wattlebark (obtainable from
most net-suppliers) to make a strong,
dark - colored solution. Black
wattle from southern N.S.W., Vic.
and S.A. are best. Boil bark to
exhaustion, and steep net in boiling
solution for two or three hours.
Leave in solution to cool; later,
dry-off.

How to preserve raw prawns for
bait ?
The following method is good
for a quantity of about lib. of
prawns, which must be fresh:
Remove heads and rinse well in
fresh water. Put one dessert-
spoonful of formalin and two pints
of water into a container; place
the prawns in this mixture and
allow to soak for about two hours.
Remove the prawns and lay them
on a perforated tray or double
layer of absorbent cloth or hessian
to drain thoroughly. Get a screw-
top earthenware jar or glass con-
tainer and put a layer of prawns
on the bottom. On top of the
prawns put a layer of the following
mixture: 2oz. coarse butchers’ salt,
one level dessertspoonful boracic-
acid and loz. sugar. Put another
layer of prawns on top of this,
and then a layer of the mixture,
and so on alternately until jar is
full. Invert the jar occasionally,
as this keeps the prawns moist with
the liquid that forms.

How to estimate the weight of
cattle ?
For dressed-weight, take the
measurement (in feet) of the girth
of the beast close behind the
shoulders, then take the length (in
feet) of the back, from the fore-
part of the shoulderblade to the
bone at the junction of the tail.
Multiply the square of the girth by
five times the length of the back,
and then take two-thirds of the
product. Result is the dressed-
weight in pounds. For example, if
the girth of a bullock is 7ft. and
the length of the back is sft., the
dressed-weight can be found as
“ Wilson, here , will be happy to demonstrate our new all-weather suit.”
follows: Multiply the square of
seven (49) by five times five (25);
the product will be 1225. Divide
1225 by three and multiply by two.
This will give 816 2/31b. Very
fat cattle will weigh 5 per cenL
more; lean animals 5 per cent, less.'
The dressed-weight is not much
more than half of the live-weight.
Skin weighs about 1 / 18th and the
tallow 1 / 12th of the live-weight.

In fact, jazz such as this can
almost be regarded as a definite
form. Brubeck himself studied
with Darius Milhaud, the
exponent of polytonality ; and
nowhere in Brubeck’s approach
is there anything to suggest
that he doesn’t regard his
music-making as a serious
business. In the world of jazz
and jazzmen there is generally
little room for a feeling of
form, of shape and purpose
within a given framework. If
there was, we would have less
mere noise and more con-
trolled brightness, and Brubeck
might find rivals springing up.
Other fabulous things on the
first side are “Jump For Joy,”
a brilliant slice of beat-playing
punctuated by solo “breaks,”
and an extended track called
“Perdido,” in which Brubeck
demonstrates on the piano how
to get maximum effect from
broken rhythms and altered
repetition—halfway through
the track he has a “break”
which is one-hand stuff: a
series of chromatic leaps and
nifty little turns; there is a
cool ending, with the group
showing how to finish decisively
on a major unison-note stag-
gering beneath a totally un-
related chord.
The second side has some
good stuff on it—the elegant
swing of “The Duke,” for in-
stance, or “Flamingo,” in
which Brubeck pulls out all his
most brilliant improvisational
stops. “C . Jam Blues” (last
number) is, reducing it to a
simple description, terrific. If
this essay in virtuoso drum-
ming doesn’t have you at least
tapping a slippered foot it’s
doubtful whether jazz—even of
such a clean and clever variety
—is your cup of tea. Recording,

Derivations
In Reverie (Coronet KLP
774) the Norman Luboff
Choir, plus a shining array of
instruments, is in turn supple,
sincere and sonorous in pre-
senting derived numbers —
themes from various orchestral
and piano works, topdressed
with choral harmony and
words. This isn’t a revolu-
tionary idea ; just look at Tin
Pan Alley and Tschaikowsky.
It has both merits and short-
comings. In the hands of the
right people—musicians who
can dodge mere blatancy of
effect —derivations undoubtedly
give the non-classically-minded
a popular dose of good music.
The big snag is that, like
Disney’s “Fantasia,” listeners
tend to associate the music with
the words, so that at a con-
cert one may hear a bit of
Debussy and immediately think
of the appropriate sugary text.
But, in general, the music on
this record is quite well done,
and the Luboff Choir certainly
chop into Chopin, to say noth-
ing of Borodin, Grieg and
Brahms. Take “No Other
Love,” a choral transmutation
of Chopin’s E Major Etude for
piano: even if the words are
a bit thin you get plenty of
rippling piano. The most effec-
tive piece on the first side is
“The Garden of Love,” which,
in its lyrical smoothness and
bass tenor treatment, sounds
like an original and flower-
flavored composition, instead
of a theme from Rimsky-
Korsakov’s “Schererazade.”
On the second side the choir
investigates “Stars , and
Shadows,” from Debussy ; be-
cause the texture of the music
is comparatively ethereal this
number tends to leave you
with a better impression than
some of the more basically
harmonic derivations. Straight
from Borodin, “And This is
My Beloved” has an Indian-
esque introduction with oboes;
“Strange Music,” from Grieg,
which in its present form in-
cludes the touching couplet
“Summer winds are sighing,
The trees are lullabying,” is
nevertheless a reasonably satis-
fying “pinch,” helped by a
plonking bass beat and liberal
stretches of smooth singing
from the men of the choir —
this is the style of singing this
choir excels in.
“Your Kiss,” thanks to the
Brahms First Symphony, or
part thereof, is possibly the
best bit of singing-a/ra-deriving
on the record. Nostalgia and
sweetness flood it, yet it doesn’t
drag along; it’s light and
graceful, and the words aren’t
too bad at all: The last number,
titled “My Reverie,” comes
from Debussy’s “Reverie”;
and behind the soft singing of
the choir the background in-
struments play-around with
Claude’s impressionistic scor-
ing.


Women's Lette rs
SYDNEY
Springtime was the major theme of
the week, emphasised in charming
fashion at the Lady Mayoress’s Ball,
when the Town Hall was transformed
into a garden through which debutantes
were escorted by their Air-Cadet partners
and presented by Mrs. F. H. Campbell
to Chief Justice Sir Kenneth Street and
Lady Street. The 16 girls wore
individually-styled white frocks, mostly
with full skirts and portrait-necklines,
and made as pretty a picture as one
would see. The Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress sat with their guests at the
official table in an old-world setting of
shaded candles and early-Victorian
posies, daintily arranged for presentation
to woman-guests. The tulle ballgown
worn by Mrs. Jensen was royal-blue, its
full skirt embroidered with white, and
the bodice off-shoulder and swathed.
Lady Street was in black lace.
It was a gay and light-hearted crowd
that cha-cha’d and essayed a few
rock-’n'-roll twirls on the crowded floor,
in between dignified waltzes and gipsy-
taps (right back in' favor these nights).
Among the groups at the tables were Dr.
Tom Bateman and his wife (the latter,
who is an ardent worker on the ball-
committee, wore mauve satins appliqued
with velvet flowers and caught at one
side with a large bow). Of flamingo-pink
pure-silk taffeta was the panniered dress
worn by Mrs. H. M. Gunson ; Miss Tess
Scully, who trained the debs., was in
black lace over pink net. Although
handicapped for some time by ill-health,
Mrs. C. M- Guiney retains her enthusi-
astic and active interest as hon. secretary
of the committee. With her husband,
she was busy greeting friends, and said
it was a last appearance before return-
ing to hospital. She looked very charm-
ing in French brocade-satin in taupe,
embroidered in orchid-pink.

Many country people and legal
luminaries were guests at the wedding
at St. Brigid’s, Marrickville, on Saturday
of popular Canberra solicitor Alan
Dunn, and Noelene Houston, youngest
daughter of Mrs. M. Houston and the
late Mr. Ross Houston, of Stanmore.
The bride, who was given away by Mr.
R. O. Rost, of Turramurra, wore a lovely
gown of white peau-de-soie of Hartnell
design in the princess-line, on which
triple-pleats merged into a short train,
both being appliqued with guipure-lace.
Her veil was fingertip-length, caught
with a satin bow. Judy Cosgrove was
an attractive bridesmaid in her powder-
blue silk ballerina, with its sheath-skirt
and the handmade French-roses at the
panelled back. Little Ann Skenner,
niece of the bride, was a dainty flower-
girl in a short dress of blue nylon,
caught-up at the hemline to show a
flounced underskirt embossed with
sprays of forget-me-nots. The bride-
groom had Brian Matthews, of Rich-
mond, as best man. Many family
friends of his —Mrs. M. Dunn
and the late Robert Dunn, of St. John
Wood, Braidwood —were at the reception
held later at Amory. Guests also in-
cluded Mr. and Mrs. W. Hartigan (Can-
berra), Mr. and Mrs. Frank Allen
(Goulburn), Mrs. Fred Lambert
(Albury), Mrs. Isabel Hartigan (Faulcon-
bridge) and Mr. Robert Jones (Ivanhoe).
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. H. F.
Jensen, is president of the Welfare
Fund and the ball-committee which each
year give a substantial lift to the work of
seven leading welfare-organisations in
Sydney and two others selected in turn
from the list of applicants. The funds
come from the Lady Mayoress' Ball and
other functions. With the Lord Mayor,
Mrs. Jensen is active also in Red Cross,
and is vice-president of its N.S.W.
division. She is patron of the Big Sister
Movement, through which elderly people
are given comfortable accommodation
in homes at Burwood, Pennant Hills and
Cronulla. Despite the many calls of her
office, Mrs. Jensen plans her day'to
spend as much time as possible with
her husband and family at their Coogee
home. They have five children, the
eldest a son of 23 and the youngest a
daughter, two-year-old Kathy, who was
bom after the Lord Mayor was elected
to office.
The lure of Sydney is a powerful one,
according to several visitors from over-
seas. At the reception held by the Royal
Commonwealth Society when president
Ivan Black introduced the Earl and
Countess De La Warr to more than 150
fellow-members, one of the guests was
Miss Margo McKay, who came from
London three years ago for a brief visit
and has been here ever since. Another
visitor encountered recently at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey See, at Vau-
cluse, was Mrs. Cramer, a vivacious
American, who describes herself as the
“woman who came to dinner and stayed.”
She was in the middle of a round-the-
world trip when she fell for Sydney, and
now her favorite view of the Harbor from
the garden-terrace is something over
which she is prepared to dispute that
anything could be more beautiful.
In a witty speech, the Earl De La
Warr put his listeners at ease by telling
them of his experiences as a farmer, and
of the fatal results of putting music in
the cow-shed. He also gave full marks
to the beauty of Australia and the loyalty
and warm feeling that existed between
Commonwealth members. Mr. Black, in
his speech, contended that the Countess
“would charm a bird off its bough,” a
finding that must have been warmly
endorsed by the gathering. Among
guests were Admiral and Mrs. Farncomb
(her grey swathed-fchiffon dinner-dress
worn with turquoise necklace and
matching-earrings); Mr. and Mrs. Edward
Lloyd Jones ; Mrs. Norman Jenkyn (a
striking figure in a short satin coat of
vivid Chinese design in peacock-green);
the Pakistan Trade Commissioner and
Mrs. Choudry; Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
Beckingsale ; Miss Grace Hunter; Misses
Gloria and Jehanne Thompson ; and
representatives of Government and Con-
sular staffs. Helping entertain were Mr.
Rigby (Mrs. Rigby was in black chiffon).
Mr. and Mrs. Syd Daniell (she wore black
Chantilly-lace) and Miss Crook.

For the first time since she arrived m
Australia Princess Alexandra wore a
uniform—the occasion being her visit
to the Lady Dugan Red Cross Home,
in the navy rig and smart matching
beret of the British Red Cross. From
all over the State had come representa-
tives of Junior Red Cross to see their
new patroness. Over 400 very wel*
behaved girls (in red capes and white
caps) and boys (in their simple uniform
sat down to luncheon in the marquee
erected in the garden. Mrs. C. •
Scantlebury (vice-chairman of A-Rw
pinned on the lapel of the Royal visitor


uniform the patron’s badge of Junior
Red Cross. Made of white-gold and
rubies, it was presented on behalf of
all J.R.C. members throughout Australia
and Papua.
Peony roses, daffodils and tulips
decorated the official table, at which, with
her Royal Highness, were Mrs. Roger
Kimpton (chairman of the J.R.C. com-
mittee) and Miss Beryl Taylor (director
of J.R.C. in Victoria), both of whom
had welcomed the Princess on her
arrival, Mrs. Scantlebury, Miss Lois
Ditchburn (Matron of the Lady Dugan
Home), Miss Janet Harrison (country
organiser for V.R.C.), J.R.C. national
secretary, John Maher, and members of
the Royal staff.
Later, as the Princess went on a tour
of inspection of the Home, a polio out-
patient, five - year - old Janet Edwards,
dressed in a pink organdie frock,
brought-off a neat curtsey despite the
tiny calipers she wore —she had travelled
102 miles from her appropriately-named
country town of Alexandra that morning
to see the Princess. A special present
from Victorian Juniors was sent to
Government House for the Princess —it
was a painting of Australian wildflowers
by 13-year-old Avril Simmons, a pupil
at Prahran Technical School. Before
she left, Princess Alexandra planted a
pin-oak in the garden to commemorate
both her visit and the centenary of Red
Cross.
When Princess Alexandra attended
the Town Hall for the wonderful ball
given in her honor by the Lord Mayor
and councillors, she wore a white Arctic-
fox stole, which she thoughtfully dis-
carded as she stepped from her car so
that the waiting crowd could get a better
view of her gown. This was of crimson
satin mounted on crinoline-petticoats,
full-skirted ; the bodice v/as cut to a
decollete square neckline with small
bows of the material set at each shoulder.
With it she wore her family orders, a
small diamond tiara, a gold necklace set
with sapphires, rubies, emeralds and
diamonds, and diamond bracelets.
The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress
iCr. and Mrs. Bernard Evans) greeted
the Royal guest with the Governor and
Lady Brooks, with whom were their
son-in-law and daughter (Mr. and Mrs.
Robin Byrne). The off-shoulder bodice
°t Mrs. Evans’s mist-pink brocade gown
was embroidered with pearls and rhine-
stones; the skirt had fullness at the
uack, and she wore a pink fox-wrap.
Lady Brooks chose azure-blue satin, the
odice heavily encrusted with iridescent
sones. She wore a diamond-tiara,
•amond-necklace and earrings.

l7f fJ e Were over 2000 guests, of whom

frarn tl- w^te background in a black

blinds, behind which lights changed
slowly from white to blues, pinks and
greens. Surrounding the dais was a
garden-setting which was a blaze of
colorful cyclamens, cinerarias and
primulas, while on both sides were
trees and tropical-plants. Once again
the Princess showed how unconventional
she can be when she moved from the
centre of the spotlighted enclosure to
one end, where she pulled-up her own
chair and had two young guests pre-
sented to her.
The Premier and Mrs. Bolte, the Town
Clerk and Mrs. Rogan, and Sir John
and Lady Jungwirth were in the official
party with the Chief Justice, Sir Edmund
Herring, and Lady Herring. One of the
loveliest gowns at the ball was worn
by Mrs. Gordon Darling. Of white
organza, it was patterned with clusters
of lilac, and there were bunches of lilac
at the waist of the bodice. Members
of the family of the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress present were their son
and daughter-in-law (Mr. and Mrs.
Ronald Evans), their daughter and son-
in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Sallman, and
younger daughter Margot, whose full-
skirted gown was of yellow brocade
patterned with small tangerine roses.
Mrs. Arthur Wilks, of Toorak, is presi-
dent of the Babaneek auxiliary to the
Royal Women’s Hospital, which held a
successful hat-parade at the home of
Mrs. Graeme Orr. The auxiliary chose
Babaneek for its name, it meaning in
aboriginal-language “mother and child”
most appropriate for the work done by
the auxiliary. Mrs. Wilks, who although
an Australian was educated in Canada,
is the mother of two daughters and one
son, all of school-age. She’s busy now
as convenor of a fair to be held on
October 7 in the Nurses’ Memorial Hall,
St. Kilda Road, in aid of the University’s
building-appeal. Photo by John Wallow.
Mrs. James McGauran’s Toorak home,
with its colorful garden and lawns
sloping down to the river, was a perfect
setting for the luncheon- and afternoon-
party which she gave for 120 guests to
assist the funds of the Astra Chamber
Orchestral Society. During the afternoon
violinist Beryl Kimber, accompanied by
her brother William, gave a recital. The
hostess wore a suit of junior-navy light-
weight wool, the jacket lined with
Persian-lamb. Beryl chose a powder-
blue re-embroidered French-lace frock
and tiny matching jacket. Among those
present were Lady Herring, Lady Angliss,
Lady White, Lady Eager, Lady Kent
Hughes, Lady Selleck and Lady Smithers,
Mrs. Frank Woods, Mrs. P. W. Briggs,
Mrs. T. Kimber (mother of the two
artists) and Miss Gertrude Johnson. Mrs.
K. Nesbitt was hon. ticket-secretary.

Mrs. Tom Carlyon, wife of the chair-
man of the Melbourne Racing Club, was
a gracious hostess when, with her hus-
band, she welcomed the Premier and
Mrs. Bolte, the Lord Mayor and Mrs.
Bernard Evans, and other guests at a
buffet-luncheon in the men’s committee-
room at Caulfield. Mrs. Bolte chose a
suit of navy wool and a small matching
toque swathed with white jersey. A cap
of deep-green iridescent feathers was
worn by Mrs. Evans with her forest-
green suit. Mrs. Carlyon’s suit of wool-
and-nylon in deep cream flecked with
yellow was worn with a mushroom-hat
of pale-cream rough straw swathed with
organza in the same toning. At the
luncheon were Sir John and Lady Lien-
hop, Sir Rupert and Lady Clarke, Cr.
and Mrs. Maurice Nathan, Mr. and Mrs.
Jack Steele (Hastings), Dr. and Mrs.
Frank Foley, Mr. and Mrs. John Reilly,
V. chairman Sir Norman Robin-
son and Lady Robinson, and V.A.T.C.
deputy-chairman Dr. Kenneth McLean.
Another pleasant luncheon was that
given by the wife of the vice-chairman
of the Moonee Valley Racing Club, Mrs.
A. J. Moir. Among the guests were Lady
Rowell, Lady Robinson, Lady Lienhop,
Mrs. A. L. Walters (attractive in slim
black suit and tiny black velvet cap
finished with a spotted eye-veil), Mrs.
W. H. Stocks (wife of a committee-
member), Mrs. James Stewart, Mrs.
Murray Cox, Mrs. W. S. Cox, Mrs.
Ronald Irving and her daughter Mrs.
Harry Scott, Mrs. R. V. Moon, Miss
Kathleen Syme and Mrs. Pat Gorman.

current Little Theatre production,
“Shadow of Heroes,” were guests at a

always careful to show not only the
surface strangeness and splendor of the
old cannibal way of life but also its
underlying ignorance, fear and horror.
When the wave of dysentry sweeps
through the village
Much of the Fijian character
emerged to startle the white men....
Slater saw an old man spitting into
another’s food-bowl that he too
might become diseased. . . .He saw'
the sick driven from houses that
they might not, for the same reason,
mix their excreta with the food of
others; he saw the hairs of the
healthy done up in little bundles
with leaves and tied to trees in the
forest that the evil spirits might
strike at these who were we 11.....
the custom of nocaca, which pur-
ported to infect the end of the
waist-cloth of a man or the fringe
of a woman’s liku with a spell.
They saw men dying in ghastly
fear because they had not yet killed
another, and therefore their lot in
Bulu —the spirit-land—would be to
beat a pile of fasces for eternity.
Thus, men with strength enough
started up, staggered to a sick child
or an old woman and strangled or
clubbed the life out of the victim,
thereby escaping this ignominy.
At times —notably in his descrip-
tions of the organised abortions, sacri-
fices, mass-burials and, what every
reader waits for in a book about canni-
bals, the local cuisine—Foreman even
seems to be plugging the brutality for
its own sake; but he organises it so
skilfully as to make you feel that it
had to happen; and after all, this is
an adventure story.
With the possible exception of the
captain in his growing madness, the
characters are all out of stock, and
none of them really comes alive. So,
apart from a couple of deft little
touches of irony in the tale, the
journalistic casing is really all there is
to it. It leaves one wishing that Fore-
man would write, in his admirably
hard and plain style, a factual book
about the white invasion of the Fijis.
Such a book would, one feels, have
an even wider appeal than this one
undoubtedly will.
Marsh of the Georgians
Christopher Hassall’s huge 680-page
Edward Marsh, Patron of the Arts
(Longman’s) is hardly, what has been
claimed, a modern life of Johnson,
since Marsh was too couth to be
Johnson and Hassall too polite to be
Boswell; but it is good all the way, and
that is a great deal to say of 680 pages
about the sponsor of a literary move-
ment which became a billabong to the
main stream of literary development.
That, at any rate, is how Marsh is
best known to the public; as the editor
of the series of anthologies, “Georgian
Poetry,” and the subsidiser, from the
“murder money” voted by the British
Government to the descendants of the
murdered statesman, Spencer Perceval,
of Georgian poets, novelists and
artists.
From the appearance of the first
volume of “Georgian Poetry” at the
end of 1912 to the fifth and last at the
end of 1922, there is a growing dis-
quiet among its contributors. The
death of Brooke, who by himself
might have kept the British tradition
gloriously on the rails, and who was
the apple of Marsh’s eye, was dis-
quieting enough. Then there were the
older men of established reputation, like
Yeats and de la Mare, who might
reasonably object to being tagged
members of a school; and there were
the younger men who could not see
the war or post-war society from the
smooth, bucolic. “Georgian” point of
view, in even rhythms and nicely-
integrated forms.
Marsh’s own growing dismay became
defeat in the middle ’twenties, with
the emergence of T. S. Eliot as
poet and critic. Left for dead on that
field, his army of writers scattered.
Marsh took on himself the furtherance
of tradition in poetry by translating all
the fables of La Fontaine and all the
Odes of Horace, completing his trans-
lation of Horace early in World War
11, bombed out of his house, his pub-
lishers’ (Macmillan’s) windows blown-
in the day after he was to send them
his manuscript; his typing-agency
blown-up a few hours after they had
triplicated his scripts to be distributed
for safety among widely distributed
friends. All this was noble, but Marsh
was still moved beyond words when
Eliot attended his 80th birthday-party
in 1951, and said that “they both knew
the good [poetry] when they saw it,
each in his own aspect of poetry, so
that all along, above any controversy
there might have been, they had in
fact been colleagues in one cause.”
And. indeed, as poetry teeters more
and more on the metaphysical tight-
rope, it looks more and more like
falling back to Marsh’s banal but solid
earth; not so much the earth of the
Georgian anthologies, but of La Fon-
taine’s narrative, and Horace’s matter-
of-fact but polished lyric. There was
a good deal of Horace in Edward
Marsh; a brilliant scholar (Cambridge)
who entered the Civil Service (in the
Australian Department) and had the
good luck (and highly-placed friends)
to be chosen Churchill’s private secre-
tary in 1905 and to follow him from
Ministry to Ministry, helping with
election campaigns, facing with a pink
umbrella the charge of a wounded
rhinoceros, and inspecting battlefields
under shellfire during the first World
War. until his retirement just before
the second World War. which rang-in
his master’s finest hour.
For most of the time, it seems, and
certainly after his retirement. Marsh
acted as Churchill’s literary adviser on
matters of style and grammar—this
phase of his career might have been
almost a full-time occupation for a
lesser man. Among a certain group of
English writers the idea seems to have
been to have your proofs vetted by
Marsh. He was hardly ever without a
set of galley-proofs to make notes on.
and in the appendix a selection of
his notes on a book of Somerset
Maugham's shows how thorough his
readings were, and how dismaying his
comments must have been to some of
the best-known names in English.
In his early chapters Hassall shows
how carefully Marsh prepared himself
and was prepared by his friends, learn-
ing not merely the distinction between
“lunch” and “luncheon,” but also the
private language of Maurice Baring,
where “type-drawers” meant “lower
middle-class (official) in appearance,”
“pale ale” meant “sloppy,” “Heygate”
meant “obsequious” and “Brahms”
meant “condescending” —the language
of exclusion which represents, to us
non-U's, the best of the English at
their worst. And yet it is this fastidi-
ousness and cultivated superiority
which makes their private letters so
readable; the charm and raillery of
Marsh’s letters describing the London
season to friends overseas, the light-
ness and gaiety of all the letters quoted
here, are the fine seasoning of this
biography: —
Margot [Asquith] was very funny
—she and I and Basil Machwood
arrived together and were having
tea with Pauline, when suddenly the
Duke of Beaufort appeared at the
other end of the hall—Margot was
furious and began whispering,
SPIREA
Dark granite under sand, and there
Roots crouch and cling to hold to earth
The burning bush, the galaxy,
The still expanding universe.
Star upon star, in blinding flight
They stream upon the darkened air;
Where one is lost, a thousand spring
Like star-dust to the naked eye.
You’d say these stars were bees, a swarm
Drunk with the pollen from the sun,
You'd say these stars were flowers even,
A spinning bush held to the ground.
But they are stars. Do not dispute
This miracle, for I am right
Who say in truth with Henry Vaughan
l saw Eternity tonight.

almost spitting to Pauline, how
could Anne invite a man like that
to a little intimate party at such a
time? it was too bad and would
spoil everything. After dinner she
sat on his knee! I had never seen
him before, he is like a medieval
wooden figure, over life-size, carved
by someone who didn’t know

My other visit [s/c] was Belvoir
....This time the most interesting
guest was Melba. She refused to
sing, but I sang to her instead, and
had a great success with her, and she
told the girls I was very handsome.
This is the second time I have been
thought handsome this year, so I was
becoming vain, but this tendency was
corrected by a dear old lady on the
H.Q. stand at the procession who
mistook me for X .
The Duchess of Rutland is furious,
why do you think? Because
Cynthia isn’t going to marry John
Granby. She can’t bear anybody
getting married except her own
children.
These are extracts from one letter
taken where the book happened to
open; and this record of what you
might call Marsh’s public private life
alternates throughout the book with the
accounts and letters of his domestic
life, which from 1903 was centred in
a top flat of two storeys near Gray’s
Inn until it was blasted by bombs in
the second World War. There,
surrounded by his large collection of
pictures and attended by Mrs. Elgy,
he entertained his friends.
A great part of the book is the story
of Rupert Brooke’s life and death, and
the quite-as-harrowing story of the
battle with Brooke’s mother over
Marsh’s literary executorship, and the
protracted squabble over the memoir
Marsh was trying to prefix to the
collected poems.
Later comes the extraordinary story
of Ivor Novello’s (his real name was
David Davies) slow rise in England
and America, and his unexpected death,
which is thought to have hastened
Marsh’s; and with all this there is an
interminable list of authors and artists
Marsh knew and helped: Nash,
Spencer, Gertler, Gaudier-Brzeska . . .
His taste ia art seems to have been
more “modem” than in literature; he
admired painters whose literary
equivalents he just couldn’t take.
Some of his “murder-money” went
early in the piece to help James Joyce,
whom he didn’t know; one of his last
awards went to Dylan Thomas. And
apropos of his offer to help de la Mare,
who said he didn’t need it, there is
the wonderful story of de la Mare
receiving by mistake a circular asking
for contributions to help de la Mare,
reading it hurriedly, seeing it was a
request to aid a needy writer, folding
a pound-note in it and returning it to
the sender.
Hassall’s wide collection of facts,
his excellent selection from these, and
his limpid and patient narrative, are
a credit to his patron. It is about six
books in one, and one of the rare books
that one reading will not exhaust, but
can be read and read again for the
pleasure of re-living the innumerable
lives it recreates.

The Steel Cocoon: Bentz Plagemann
(Seeker and Warburg). A poorly
developed novel about personalities on
an American destroyer, chief among
whom is an enigmatic, blustering
petty-officer in charge of the sick-bay.
This man, Alexander Bullitt, is hated
by some of the crew, though at first
(and for most of the book) his noble
young assistant Tyler Williams sticks
up for him, helping him drink cock-
tails made from medical alcohol. Then
one of the crew gets his hand caught
in some machinery; due to Bullitt’s
neglect he doesn’t receive proper
treatment. Naturally, in the interests
of drama, this particular crewman is
later one of a party assigned to load-
ing explosives onto the ship and he
manages to drop a shell which explodes
with much greater force than a Bullitt.
The result is that Williams blames
Bullitt, who goes and gets drunk,
behaves like a maniac and is removed
in a straitjacket. A rather thin
branch on which to hang a plot. To
make matters worse, the captain is a
god, the men generally are sex-crazy
and the ship’s doctor is unutterably
ephemeral. Occasionally, though, in
his less exalted moments, Plagemann
gives you a few good glimpses of how
medical-orderlies in a destroyer go
about their job.

the movement of the charmer; to

Set in the pleasant country of South Queensland,
where the Pine River flows, and where a century
ago pioneer Tom Petrie grazed his fine cattle, one
of the giant mills of Australian Paper Manufacturers
Limited is now writing a new tale of progress into
the history of the State and the Nation. Thirteen
years ago, A.P.M. selected the rural site, and the
pattern of Petrie changed.
Today the great Petrie Mill produces paperboard
for the Australian packaging industry in the midst
of a thriving town with a fine Company housing
settlement, a modern hostel and recreation areas.
Inaugurated by the Prime Minister in 1957, Petrie
Mill has a particular place of pride in Queensland’s
Centenary Year. It has caught the spirit of the
pioneer and is now expressing the forward drive of
Queensland itself and the advance of the Australian
Commonwealth. Petrie teams with the six other mills
operated in Australia by A.P.M. — a Company
owned by 27,000 Australians, which is producing
more than 260,000 tons of paper and paperboard
and more than 90,000 tons of woodpulp a year.
