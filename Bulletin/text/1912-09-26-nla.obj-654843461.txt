The stars were silver above it,
A wizard’s ink-pool it lay.

To-night it is low and distant,

7he message that conies to blind me
To beauty here at my hand.
The cruel voice of the breakers
a fl' rec]ced uiy heart on the beach,

For that that I may not reach.

Ana sleep has fled from my eyelids.

DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
More Insect
The Life and Love of the Insect intro-
duced to English readers the life-work of the
most interesting of modern naturalists, the
nonagenarian ,T. H. Fabre; and at once it
was seen that here was a man who had
opened to us a new world : —the strange, in-
conceivable world of the insect. Unlike the
naturalists of the text-boobs, Fabre—this
patient, humble observer, whose life-long
obscurity is the prelude to an enduring fame
—took us down into that world and let us
see the insect almost as if through the many-
faceted insect’s eyes. It is announced that
the whole of Fabre’s entomological essays
are to be translated into English; they
would fill a library shelf. Meantime, here
is another large volume, entitled Social Life
m the Insect World (Unwin), crammed full
of original observation and informed with
the sympathetic spirit of the man who has
been called “The Insect’s Homer.”
Here, for instance, he demolishes the
ancient legend that the Cigale, the careless
singer of the summer, went destitute in
winter to the Ant, begging for food; and the
Ant coldly advised the beggar to go on
dancing. It is really the Ant that robs
the Cigale of her food, and on the Cigale’s
death he feasts on her body. Fabre goes on
to investigate the life-history of the Cigale,
and sums it up as: Four years of hard
labor underground, and a month of feasting
in the sun.
For four years, in the darkness, he has
worn a dirty parchment overall; for four
years he has mined the soil with his talons,
and now the mud-stained sapper is sud-
denly clad in the finest raiment, and pro-
vided with wings that rival the bird’s-
moreover, he is drunken with heat, and
Hooded with light, the supreme terrestrial
joy. His cymbals will never suffice to cele-
brate such felicity, so well earned although
so ephemeral.
Another popular belief shattered is that
which invests the Praying Mantis with the
sentiments of a Chapmalexander convert:—
, These attributes of prayer conceal' the
rfeost atrocious habits; these supplicating
arms are lethal weapons; these fingers tell
no rosaries, but help to exterminate the un-
foitunate passer-by.. . .The Mantis lives ex-
clusiveiy upon living prey. It is the tigef
ot the peaceful insect peoples; the ogre in
ambush which demands a tribute of livine
flesh. &
And, as usual, the female of the species is
the more dangerous. This particular female
eagerly devours her male lover immediately
after the honeymoon. The human female is
more leisurely. The Mantis husband pro-
vides the wedding breakfast. So does the
male Golden Scarabieus. The curious thing
is that the new-made bridegroom does not
try to escape.
Of the Philanthus aviporus, the insect that
hunts the, bee, the naturalist tells an
astounding tale. The Philanthus kills bees,
by stinging them at a precise spot in
the throat. By stabbing the cervical gang-
lions she gets a corpse, and not, as is the
custom of other insect murderers, a para-
lytic.
In what fencing-school did the slayer
learn that terrible upward thrust beneath
the chin? And as she has learned it, how is it
that her victim, so learned in matters of
architecture, so conversant with the politics
of Socialism, has so far learned nothing in
her own defence? As vigorous as the ag-
gressor, she also carries a rapier, which is
even more formidable and more painful in
its results —at all events, when my finger is
the victim! For centuries and centuries
Philanthus has stored her cellars with the
corpses of bees, yet the innocent victim sub-
mits, and the annual decimation of her race
has not - taught her how to deliver herself
from the scourge by a well-directed thrust.
I am afraid that I shall never succeed in
understanding how it is that, the assailant
has acquired her genius for sudden murder
while the assailed, better armed and no less
powerful, uses her dagger at random, and
so far without effect To this difficulty I
see only one reply: the one knows without
having learned and the other does not know,
being incapable of learning.
Then the victor squeezes the dead bee’s
abdomen and compresses the throat, with the
result that the honey in the stomach of the
bee ascends to its mouth. As it oozes forth
the bandit greedily licks it up. Why this
feast? Mere hunger? No. It is an example
of that most beautiful of feelings, the tender
maternal instinct. In emptying the stomach
of the bee, the mother is performing the
most praiseworthy of all duties; she is
guarding her future family against poison.
The naturalist found by experiment that
honey is poison to the Philanthus’s grubs.
The Philanthus mothdr, though she likes
honey, has found that out, too. How?
The bees must therefore be emptied of
honey before they are fed to the grubs. The
process .must be effected without wounding
the victim, for the larva must receive the
latter fresh and moist; and this would be
impracticable if the insect were paralysed.
The bee must therefore be killed outright,
otherwise the honey could not be removed.
Instantaneous death can be assured only by
a lesion of the primordial centre of life. The
sting must therefore pierce the cervical
ganglions.... Here the sting is inserted in a
breach of the armor no larger than a pin’s
head. Suppress a single link in this closely-
,mt„ch; lin ’,. and the Philanthus reared upon
the flesh of bees becomes an impossibility.
The fact that a female Great Peacock, or
Emperor, Moth emerged from her cocoon on
Fabre’s laboratory table, and was immedi-
ately caged in by a cover of wire gauze, led
to extraordinary happenings, and to a per-
sistent search by the naturalist for the ex-
planation. That night the house was full
of giant butterflies—lovers brought by some
mysterious instinct to the new-born female.
There was 40 of these would-be husbands.
Fabre, delighted, set to work to discover
what lure and what organ of sense could
have brought these great moths through
darkness and distance to the cage of the
butterfly woman. He removed antennae and
other likely sense organs, but found no solu-
tion of the miracle.
. With a view to mating, the sole end of
its life, the great moth is endowed with a
marvellous prerogative. It has the power to
discover the object of its desire in spite of
distance, in spite of obstacles. A few hours,
for two or three nights, are given to its
search, its nuptial flights. If it cannot pro-
nt by them, all is ended; the compass fails,
the lamp expires. The Great Peacock exists
as a butterfly only to perpetuate itself. It
knows nothing of food. While so many others,
joyous banqueters, fly from flower to flower,
unrolling their spiral trunks to plunge them
into _ honeyed blossoms, this incomparable
ascetic, completely freed from the servitude
ot the stomach, has no means of restoring
its strength. Not a sip of honey can ever
enter its stomach. The Great Peacock re-
nounces the joys of the palate; but with
them it surrenders long life. Two or three
nights—just long enough to allow the couple
to meet and mate —and all is over; the great
butterfly is dead.
So Fabre investigates the means by which
the female lures the male. Sound? Does
she emit vibrations of such delicacy or rapid-
ity that only the most sensitive microphone
could apppreciate them? But the warning
reaches the males at distances of some thou-
sands of yards. Smell? Does the female
emit effluvia analogous to odor, imperceptible
to us, yet capable of stimulating a far more
sensitive sense organ than ours? Fabre
saturated his room with a choice assortment
of vile odors, in the hope of masking the
odor presumably emitted by the moth. The
males penetrated those concerted odors
of a gasworks, a perfumery, a petroleum
well and a chemical factory, straight to the
female. Then he tried hermetically sealing
the female under glass. Not a male arrived.
He hid her in drawers and in cupboards.
The males beat with their wings at the
doors. And the visitors arrived against the
strong wind then blowing. Four years of
varying experiments left the problem un-
solved.
Then the naturalist turned to another
moth, and. discovered the love-philtre—an
invisible emanation with which the female
impregnated any surface on which she
rested. To this surface the male moths
went straight, disregarding the female whom
Fabre had removed to another easily accessi-
ble spot. So it was smell, an inconceivably
subtle sense of smell. But Fabre cannot
believe that it is an odor such as we per-
ceive and understand. For the odor emitted
by the female moth must saturate with its
molecules a hemisphere of air some miles
in diameter—and yet it is an odor that a
conglomeration of pungent odors cannot
swamp. Fabre hopelessly suggests that, like
light, odor has uts X-rays.
This is but one example among many in
Social Life in the Insect World of the great
naturalist’s inexhaustible patience and in-
genuity. What are our own naturalists
doing on these lines with the unique insect
life of Australia? Is there a mute, inglori-
ous !^ re hidden in the “Abo.” page? What
has Moorabinda” to say about the nuptials
of the bull-ant? And, anyway, what are
“A. William Cann” and his cobber, “Jimmie
Pannikin,” going to do about it?
Two Strange Plays
The first eugenics drama comes from Percy
Mack-aye, author of a number of interesting
plays, including Sappho and Phaon, The
Scarecrow, and Anti-Matrimony, a satire
on Nietzsche, Ibsen and Sudermann.
To-Morrow (Stokes, New York) is Mendel-
ism and biology on the stage, the cult of the
better breeding of humanity. The scene is
set in a garden where another Luther Bur-
bank is occupied in evolving the thornless
cactus and the blue poppy. His daughter,
Mana, he has educated on scientific prin-
ciples, with eugenics as her god, in order
that she might mate with his assistant, an
equally perfect physical being. But into
the garden blows the seed of a weed: the girl
falls in love with a man tainted with disease,
whose illegitimate child has been from that
cause born blind. The lover dares not con-
fess his paternity to the girl, nor, though
ordered by the girl’s father to explain to her
the taint that is in him, and that will in all
probability affect any other children he may
have, can he bring himself to obey. Mark,
the gardener’s assistant, determines for the
sake of the girl to “pull up this weed” that
threatens to ruin her life. He throws the
lover over a cliff, and discovers that his
motives were concerned less for the race
than for his desire for the girl. The final
scene is smoothed over by the averting of the
expected death of the lover, leaving Mark
and the girl to wed.
The drama is too obviously a piece of
special pleading, though the theme is de-
veloped with many charming allegories. The
garden atmosphere is delightfully preserved,
with Peter, the Burbank of the play, at
work, happy with his genial philosophy:—
Mana : Dear flowers !
Peter: There they are, toeing the line —
stubborn little upstarts, growing up smart,
all bowing “Hello!” to their step-dad, Peter
Dale.
Mana : They don’t look afraid of him.
Petee: Oh, at first, they all wanted to go
their own ways; but they had to mind their
pistils and quin tines, I tell you. When they
were babies, I’ve bottled ’ejn, and weaned
’em, and boxed ’em, and put ’em to
bed, and tucked up their tendrils.
And when they grew bigger and put
on their petals, I’ve picked out their
wardrobes and done their courting and wed-
ding for ’em. You might say, I’m kind of
nurse, priest and select-man combined.
MaNa : You’re their dear old Father
Nature—-that’s what you are.
Petee : No, I’m a plain gardener, learn-
ing how, and trying .to teach my family.
Only here I’ve raised millions of step-flowers,
but just one flower: that’s Mana.
Mana ( hissing him ) : Dear Dad!
Petee : Just so; just your old, useless Dad.
For you see, I can garden Mother Nature’s
childer, but not my own.
Mana : You’ve brought us all up together.
Have I turned out such a naughty flower-
girl?
Petee : Well, kind of a “sport,” I’m glad
to say. But ’tain’t what you are; it’s what
I can’t do for you, that bothers me—when I
think of them. Look here!
Mana : Why, it’s the blue poppy—blos-
somed.
Peter : Yes, it’s blue. I made it so, and
I can keep it so —for a hundred generations:
true blue... .To keep it true, I can give this
poppy environment and selection. But you
- —I can give you only the first.
Mana: You mean, with selection, it’s I
that
Peter: I mean that when my flower-girl
comes to the blossoming, she becomes a
woman; and worn'an is herself garden and
gardener, and the flowers of God are in her
keeping. . . .Poppies need a lot of reminding.
It’s in their sap to hark ’way back to the
old times: to dream —and forget to-morrow.
And as for girls—-There! I’m forgetting
my fruit trees!
The Terrible Meek, “a oue-act play for
three voices, to be played in darkness,” is
the last word in theatrical, as opposed to
dramatic, effectiveness. Charles Rann Ken-
nedy, author of The Servant in the House,
gets his thrill by conventional methods of
lighting, but it certainly is a legitimate
thrill. The curtain rises upon inky dark-
ness, and the voice of an unseen woman
weeping. Follows a conversation between
the educated voice of an army captain and
the Cockney tones of a soldier. From the
talk the audience gathers that a malefactor
has been executed that afternoon, before the
coming of the storm that had enveloped the
hill in this black fog.
Soldier: Well, we done for 'im good and
proper, any’ah.
Captain : My God, yes. We builders of
empire know how to do our business.
However, the soldier has got something
out of jthe execution. He “an’ the boys”
tossed for the criminal’s clothes, and the
soldier got the poor devil’s boots.
It turns out that neither the captain nor
the soldier know exactly for what crime he
had been condemned to death.
Soldier: It’s difficult to know wot’s wot
in these outlandish places. It’s not like at
’Ome, sir, where there’s Law an’ Order an’
Patriotism an’ Gawd’s Own True Religion.
These, blarsted ’eathens got no gratitude.
’Ere’s the Empire sweatin’ ’er guts aht,
tryin’ ter knock some sense inter their dam
silly ’eds; an’ wot do you get aht of it, orl
said an’ done? Nuthin’! Nuthin’ but a lot
of ingratitude, ’ard words, insurrections, an’
every nah an’ then a bloody example like
this ’ere to-day! Oh, these foreigners mek
me sick; they do reely!
The captain suggests that perhaps they
are not foreigners: they might be —brothers.
“Brothers!” exclaims the soldier. “Why,
that’s exactly wot ’e used ter say —’im up
there.” He goes on to wonder what it was
the criminal had “reely done.” “If you arsk
me, sir, it was them —well, them long-faced
old jossers dahn there as begun the ’ole
beastly business... .Like a lot of old washer-
women. Alius jawin’. They was alius
naggin’ the pore fellow. Couldn’t leave ’im
alone.”
It was for something that the executed
man had said : “A bit of langwidge, that’s
orl.” The long-faced gents handed him over
to the magistrate, only this time it was on a
charge of rioting and stirring people up
against the Government. The accusers did
their duty to the public in delivering him to
the magistrate, their witnesses did their
duty, the magistrate had to do his, and
handed him over to the captain, who did his
duty in ordering his soldiers to execute him.
As the soldier exclaims: “I on’y obeyed my
orders. When my superior orficer says:
‘Kill a man,’ why, I just kill ’im, that’s orl.
....Wot’s a soldier f0r?.... Blood an’ ’ell!
I’d kid ’im as soon as look at ’im, yes, I
would, if ’e was Gawd aht of ’Eaven ’lmself!
Not as I ’ave anythin’ personal agen this
pore devil. On’y I do know my duty.”
“So you think he is dead, do you?” the
captain earnestly asks.
“Well, wot do you think? A man don’t
live forever, ’ung up as ’igh as we got ’im
yonder. Besides, we did a bit of business
with ’is vital parts, after we’d got ’im up
there.”
The soldier departs, glad to get out of
this creepy place; and in the grey, misty
light are now seen the face and hands of the
wailing woman, her faintly limned features
“one pale agony.” In her grief she recalls
her son.
“He wasn’t particular, my son. He would
go with anybody. He loved them so. There
wasn’t a drunken bibber in the place, not a
lozel, not a thief, not a loose woman on the
streets, but called him brother. He would
eat with them, drink with them, go to their
parties. He would go with grand folk, too;
gentlemen. He wasn’t particular; he would
go with anybody.... And I tried to hinder
him..'. .1 was afraid of what the people
might think. Like I was blind I never
told him as I undei’stood. And now it’s too
late. He’s dead.” 1
And the captain tells the stricken woman
that her dead son has won the greatness pro-
mised for him. “The earth is his.... The
meek, the terrible meek, the fierce, agonising
meek, are about to enter into their inheri-
tance.” The captain refuses to obey his
general’s orders. He has sworn duty to
another general, and accepts the conse-
quences. The darkness melts away.
“An unearthly splendor fills the place. It
is_ seen_ to be the top of a bleak, stony hill
with little grass to it. The woman is
dressed in Eastern garments ; the captain is
a Roman centurion; the soldier, a Roman
legionary. Above them rise three gaunt
crosses bearing three dead men gibbeted like
thieves. At the foot of the crosses a flock
of sheep nibble peacefuly at the grass. The
air is filled with the sound of their little
bells.” , '
So —-a theatrical trick! But a very effec-
tive trick ; and the composition of the brief
drama is almost perfect in its naive and
telling simplicity. Without the darkness it
would have its appeal.
1 "■ ♦ ———-
A new profession is suggested by The
Bookman (New York). It is well known
that the literary critic —the sort of bloke,
for instance, who conducts this page—has
no say at all in determining the sale or
popularity of a novel. What makes a book
a best-seller is mere unliterary people talk-
ing about it at a dinner-table or in a tram.
Well, why should a publisher not engage
important-looking people to pervade dinner-
tables and trams, and casually mention the
books of that publisher? That is the way
that motor-cars are now sold. Why not
books?
For an excellent detective story—one of
the best in recent years, The Mystery of the
Boule Cabinet, by Burton E. Stevenson
(Dodd, Mead, per Sydney Book Club), can
be enthusiastically recommended. The author
has bettered his teacher, Conan Doyle.
In the collection of essays now published
under the title, Essays in Radical Empiri*
cism (Longmans, Green, per Lockley
Library), the late William James puts forth
his philosophy of that name. This doctrine,
we are told, James regarded as more im-
portant than his own Pragmatism, the estab-
lishment of which he held to be an important
step toward making radical empiricism pre-
vail. The volume has the vivacious style
that has done so much in making his other
works popular even outside the ranks of
scientific readers.

ANTHONY HORDERNS' for EVERYTHING
Anthony Horderns’
For RAZORS.
The MODERN SAFETY RAZOR is a LUXURY ;
it SIMPLIFIES SHAVING, makes it SO EASY
that the NOVICE is INDEPENDENT of the
BARBER, and, with the GEM JUNIOR, as well
as several OTHER STYLES OF SAFETY
RAZORS, there is a NEW BLADE for EACH
DAY of the week. In the LIST that follows we
quote a SELECTION, and offer them at
ANTHONY HORDERNS’
FAMOUS LOW PRICES.
GEM JUNIOITSAFETY RAZOR.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR solves the
problem for the man who cannot rely upon the
old-style Razor. It is unequalled for easy and
luxurious Shaving, and does not scrape nor pull.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR, with the
New Bar. adds still further to the EFFICIENCY
of this popular Safety Razor. THE GEM
JUNIOR provides a KEEN BLADE for EVERY
day in the week. Every Blade automatically ad-
justs itself, and as the BLADE does the shaving
it is the first consideration.
GEM JUNIOR BLADES are made from the
best Razor Steel, tempered by a process, patented
by the Gem Cutlery Co. (the oldest makers of
Safety Razors), that provides a keen, lasting
edge.
After using GEM JUNIOR BLADES several
times they may be stropped—the steel is superior,
the temper and edge so fine, that stropping
makes them as good as ever.
The New Bar smoothes out the creases of the
skin, raises the beard just ahead of the cutting
edge, and makes perfect shaving a simple matter.
The GEM JUNIOR SAFETY RAZOR is made
and finished in the BEST STYLE, of the BEST
materials, and by the best workmanship. It
comprises Nickel-plated Frame, extra handle for
Stropping Blades, and Seven KEEN-EDGED
BLADES, packed in neat case.
ANTHONY HORDERNS’ PRICE, 5/-;
BY POST, 5/3.

Price, 5/-; by Post, 5/4.
GILLETTE SAFETY RAZOR.
The advantage of the GILLETTE SAFETY
RAZOR is the ease and rapidity with which shav-
ing is accomplished.
The GILLETTE SAFETY RAZOR not only
makes shaving easy, but it ensures a clean, close
shave, no matter how tough the beard may be or
how tender the skin.
The simple means of adjusting the curve of the

A delicious wine tonic, restorative, blood maker and nerve food that

perhaps, your greatest asset, surely
you will appreciate the absolute
necessity of maintaining a definite
and safe standard of physical and
mental fitness.
Unless you do so, any extra
exertion, any extra
worry, will not only
cause that “run
down ” and “ out-of-sorts ”
feeling, but is liable to undermine
your constitution and sap your vitality.
If you will take “Wincarnis,” “the
wine'of life,” regularly, just for a
few days, you will be astonished
and delighted with the wonderful
improvement in your health, and
the increased vigor and vitality
“Wincarnis” will create.
“Wincarnis” will give you such
an abundance of renewed health
and strength that your whole
system will glow and pulsate
with new life.

“Montere”: The report of the Commission on the
cost of living in Maoriland goes to show that most
things you buy from a grocers shop are about where
they were 15 years ago—-some are, in fact, much
lower in price—but one item in the list has soared
like an aeroplane. Soap has almost doubled in price,
and in view of the fact that Europe doesn’t wash to
any extent, and prefers its bath dry during the
greater part of the year, the. breast of the Maori-
lander may well swell with cleanly patriotic pride
in studying the report. Some of the fatty product is,
of course, used for helping hot springs to turn them-
selves into geysers, and some goes to the cleansing of
the domestic dog, but these uses for the article Were
known more than 15 years ago. It may be that the
cause of the increase is the larger quantity of gold
in circulation, the growth of national extravagance,
the domestic waste, or any of the score Of probabili-
ties mentioned in the report; but the most simple,
plain, honest, faithful and straightforward reason
that could be given is that the demand is greater,
and that Maoriland is now washing itself in a fashion
utterly unknown to its old father, Who came Out
from England.

1 died in Melbourne, and, Mrs. Hordern returned to
Sydney to be with her/family. On her death, which
occurred,sop>e r tipie,in,the early ’7o’s, the Melbourne
properties ,were .'Sdrd for cash at a handsome profit.

Proem always lived in Melbourne. The first Mrs.
ordern (she died at the Darling Point house of
Anthony .No. 2), was 79 years of age at her passing
out. This would make her 29 on first landing in
Sydney. Ten years ago, there were in Sydney four
distinct firms of Horderns. First there were Edward
Hordern and Sons, who advertised that they were the
original firm of the name, established in 1823. (This
would be correct, hs Anthony and Lebbeus left the
parent .counter in King-street to open on the spot
.where Edward Hordern was in business in 1900.)
Then there was Anthony Hordern and Sons, Hay-
market, where Anthony No. 2 had set up his counter
on the dissolution of partnership with? his brother
Lebbeus. After that there was Percy Hordern,
draping busily on the corner of Swan-street, next to
Edward. The last was Cecil Hordern, who had been
in business in York-street, but, in 1900, was ill the
Strand, the arcade which tunned off George-street;
iust past King-street. There are but two firms of the
name now in business—the ‘Universal Providers’, and
Hordern Brothers, of Pitt-street. The genesis of the
last-named firm Was in the year. 1868, wilt* the lat'e
John L. Hbrderh Was, Conducting a small drapery
business in NeWtown, beyond the railway bridge ph
the Cook’s River-road, in 1879, he had a shop ih
pitt-street. Which establishment he extended until
the business reached its present large proportions.
Anthony Hordern No. 3 Was an active business blah.
Before the advent of Responsible Government in
Westralia. he made a bargain with the Administra-
tion of the day for the construction of a railway.
H-'s reward was to he a riven area of land on each
side of the line. This contract was being, carried out
by him, when he was stricken down bv illness while
making a coastal, trip. He never recovered, and his
remains were buried at,,Albany. Anthony No. 4 is 4

“Montalex”: A Sydney pharmacist has recently
been kicking against the custom Some doctors have
of giving nrescriptiong ih cipher, and thus compelling
the patient to, have bis poison made up. by a particu-
lar chemist who is, “in the know.” The ".dodge isn’t
a new one. A good, many years ago, in Melbourne, I
received a prescription couched in apparently mean-
ingless words and sign?. I obiected, on the" ground
that I aiwavs liked to know what I was putting into
mv stomach. “Pooh!” said the medico, “you evi-
dently don’t understand Latin.” This gratuitous as-
sumption moved me to sarcasm. “Oh. yes,’’ I said,
“1 understand even doctors’ Latin. But this isn’t
Latin, and these are not the recognised quantity-
signs, Kindly re-write the thing in the ordinarv
wav.” He did. I don’t know what he thought, hut
he looked hvdrocvanic acid.

Regarding the Aerogen Gas Plant you lately installed for us, we are very well
pleased with it, and can, with confidence, recommend it. The lighting is good and the
working of the machine easy to understand. -
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) RONALD BROS.
“Mt. Elephant,” Derrinallum,
Dear Sirs September 15, 1910.
I am in receipt of your letter of 15th inst., re Aerogen Safety Gas, and have waited
until I could give the plant a thorough test before giving my opinion of the machine as a
means of lighting country houses. .... , ,
I have no hesitation in saying that the installation has been an unqualified success, and
complies with every requirement one would look for in a plant of this kind.
The light is clear, steady and brilliant. . x .. . .
For cooking purposes the stove has been a great success, and equal to the best gas
stove. It will be of great value during the summer months. nrinmir
Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) 11. ALAN CURRIE.

SAVE 15 to 25% of FUEL
and reduce wear and tear on your Steam Plant
by installing a
WADHAM ECONOMISER
Contra-Flow Circulation System.
THE “WADHAM” works on the Contra-flow Cirenlation system,
increasing the efficiency 25 to 50 per cent, over the ordinary
parallel-flow type. It is the most up-to-date and successful
Economiser on the Market. Retains every valuable point of the ordin-
ary Standard Economiser, and in addition possesses a simple arrange-
ment of parts (patented) which give it the following important ad-
vantages :
1. —Largely increased efficiency over the ordinary Economiser in util-
ising heat from the Waste Gases.
2.—Fewer pipes required for the same output, and consequent reduced
first cost.
3.—A Perfect blowing-out arrangement for removing sludge, thus
maintaining a higher efficiency and saving cost of scaling and
upkeep. The “Wadham” is the only Economiser which works
efficiently with dirty water.
4.—Safety from explosions, owing to more perfect access of all sections
to the safety valve.
s.—Less sweating and deterioration —consequently longer life.
6.—Cheaper to erect and ship. Smaller space required.
CAN BE ADAPTED TO EXISTING INSTALLATIONS.

THIN WOMEN!
Would you like to
be Well and Fully
Developed ?
]
m
&
ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the
one essential that creates a perfect appearance. Lack ot pro-
per bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars quickly
take from a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy woman-
hood. . .Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural
development is concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your Jite,
if you suffer from no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully
developed atid your weight increased to normal.
There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat -
bosomed, hollow-cheeked and generally smggly in appearance, and, .suffering
the effects of anaemia and defective digestion, who are now, for the first time
in their lives, healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheeked, and enjoymg the full
vigor of robust womanhood, as a result of a few weeks under our wonderful
“FLESH-FOOD” TREATMENT.
Many women whose figures have been spoiled by maternal duties have
been entirely restored to splendid. form, and flat-chested young women who
suffered slow development have had the fault corrected by this treatment.
Flesh-Food is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond
question, and its use is no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases
gained up to six pounds a week, and an increase in bust measurement up v ;to
8 and 10 inches.

development, and will send same and a FREE SAMPLE TREATMENT*to you

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit' by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years,, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in
the week. It is now 12 months since I last used
tobacco, and, although I am continually in the. com-
pany of smokers, I do not have the least desire to
smoke, therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-

have every reason to believe , were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are

Spring Song
The winds of Spring are brisker
Where warm, and soft, and thin
They stir the wide green whisker
Upon the mountain’s chin ;
Through grass and fern they flutter
Where scented blossoms strew
The fields where cows make butter
And I make love to you.
Excuse my baldly stating
The patent fact in rhyme,
The little birds are mating
And it is loving-time. _
In words sincere and simple,
And with a tongue that trips,
I sinv the laughing dimple
One inch below your lips.
We walk in shining weather,
The glad sun goes to bed,
Nor stops to ask us whether
We like the West done red;
Before his light is hid, he
Flings roses down the way
Where oldest maids grow giddy,
And youngest girls are gay.
He knows that still he misses
The best part of the fun,
The warmest kind of kisses
From night’s first hour are won :
The yellow lustre lingers,
One star begins to blink,
And I have ten slim fingers
To hold, whose hue is pink.
The moon shall follow" after—
A heedless queen is she—
Tossing her yellow laughter
Around our kindest tree;
The planets gaily swinging
Their soft, white way, shall take,
Nor mark the fitful singing
Our happy pulses make
Then as the airs grow crisper
And hurry by with haste,
My circling arm shall whisper
Soft to your waist;
And where the lights are gleaming
We two on loving feet
Shall wander fact-ward dreaming
Of something good to eat.
Excuse my baldly stating
The simple truth in rhyme,
That e’en when birds are mating
There is a supper time:
Love hath her little fishes
With frizzled tails upcurled,
And Spring in pleasant dishes
Makes gladness through the world.
N.S.W.
PAT O’MAORI.
The Climbers.
“What a climber she is !” said a fat, heavy
dame,
Referring to smart Mrs. Gilder.
“The society papers are full of her name,
And her father, you know, was a builder.
Just look at her now, with those men hang-
ing round,
As though she were Someone —the ninnies!
Men mob her because she is prettily gowned,
And her furs cost at least fifty guineas.
“Gave a dinner last week, and the Sheep-
leighs were there,
But nobody else worth a mention.
They visit her often —they don’t seem to
care — i
And pay her a lot of attention ; I
Yet they mix with the best. It’s a wonder
to me
That any undoubted old-timers,
Whose people are all at the top of the tree,
Should patronise parvenu climbers.
“I suppose she’ll be marrying into our set,
And then we shall all have to know her.
She’s decent, I’m told, though a vulgar
coquette—
The sort that the men call a “goer.”
Ah! society changes in morals and ways:
With the stream, so to speak, we have
drifted.
No climbing was known in my poor mother s
days:
If we took people up they were lifted.
All sorts and conditions of people you meet,
Who seem much alike as you pass ’em;
And unless you belong to the social 61ite
You cannot be bothered to class ’em.
But some are nonentities stylishly drest,
Looking down on mere common lor-blimers,
And some, like the fat, heavy dame, are the
Best,
And the ones she dislikes are the climbers.
VICTORIA.

The Week-Ender.
A toy horse feeds on a distant hill, and a
far-off cow is lowing,
And sweet and cool through the rustling
grass a southerly breeze is blowing;
The blue hills wait, and a white cloud
broods, and the Autumn day commences
With cheery rattle of milking pails, and
low, clear chirps on the fences.
Hill and valley and hill again, ’neath a gar-
ment of autumn grasses;
Each far-flung fence is a regiment that over
the landscape passes;
And here and there is a chocolate square
where ploughs, in their work unending
Have cut a piece from the cloak and left some
work for a Springtime mending.
A grey crane stands by the brimming tank
where sheep are quietly grazing,
While dazed and awed by the country peace,
I say to myself “Amazing!”
But Monday morning sees me back —(and
glad to be there!)—on the station ;
For smoke’s, my diet, and noise my drink,
and hurry my sole vocation.

THE BRICK CONTUMELIOUS.
It is estimated that the holding of the Federal capital will increase the demand for bricks to the extent of 90 millions.
If the victim one day awakes to a full appreciation of the ludicrous insult it is doubtful if 999 million bricks will meet the sudden demand.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
tlie Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

SYDNEY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1912.
HIGH RENTS ON THE ROCKS.
The well-intentioned folk who lately re-
lated to Premier McGowen their tale of
overcrowding and high rents in the harbor-
side areas of Sydney propounded a very real
grievance, but made little progress at show-
ing a remedy. The tale has been told very
often, and has ended very regularly up
against the same old brick wall. In fact,
it has become like the ancient witticism
about the immovable obstruction which was
struck by an irresistible force, in conse-
quence of which something happened which
nobody has ever been able to explain to the
satisfaction of anybody. It is admitted on
all hands that Sydney is becoming, in places,
a congested city. That is to say, it hasn’t
begun to be congested as the term is under-
stood in the worst localities of England and
Scotland, but it is becoming more afflicted
in that direction tin a any really civilised
place ought to be. (The worst localities of
England and Scotland have never been
really civilised, so they don’t come into the
argument.) Stories are told of two or three
families living where one used to live. There
are also narratives about four families living
temporarily in four rooms and a kitchen,
which is an unspeakable business, and the
fact that, in the east end of Glasgow, two
families have been known to live perman-
ently in one room, which was bedroom,
kitchen and everything else, is no apology
for this sort of horror. Many of the houses in
Sydney are old, and out of date; and though
there are inhabited structures in England
and Scotland which are 200 years older and
400 years more out of date, that makes the
situation no better. For very many years
Sydney had an antiquated system of muni-
cipal government, and the purposeless mayor
and futile corporation had no power to con-
demn broken-down structures ; so these sort
of tenements accumulated. And the mean
tenements mostly open off mean streets, be-
cause Sydney was built on a haphazard plan
and mean streets are >numerous. The worst
of them are better than the mean streets
which are to be found in some British cities,
but that doesn’t make their meanness any
less unpleasant. Nobody has devised a com-
prehensive plan for the reconstruction of
Sydney, still a good deal of improvement is
being done in a fragmentary sort of way.
Every improvement involves the pulling
down of crowded buildings, and the ejection
of the inhabitants, who, while the rebuilding
is in progress, have to crowd into some other
slum and make it worse than it was before.
And when the rebuilding is finished, with
wider streets and better accommodation, the
improved area naturally holds fewer people
than the unimproved area. Therefore, it is
alleged with great bitterness that the im-
provements are steadily making things
worse.
Amid all this excitement rents are going
up. That is to say, the landlord takes what
he can get for his house, just as the farmer
takes all he can get for his wheat, and the
wharf-laborer takes as much as he can get
for his labor, and the trades union accepts
as much interest as comes its way on its in-
vestments, and the policy-holder in the
A.M.P. Society annexes whatever bonus is
offering. It is not absolutely certain that
rents are much higher even now than they
were before the great slump of 1892, 1898
and adjacent years, yet the rise in recent
times has been very conspicuous. Even the
Labor Government, which is a big landlord
on the Rocks area of Sydney, has been
accused of putting up some of its charges
about 100 per cent., and there are said to be
places where a Government tenant lets out
beds at Is. a night, and puts eight beds in
a room. Also, there are frenzied Govern-
paent tenants who are under notice to leave
because their dilapidated hovels are con-
demned, and who say they can’t find even a
dog-kennel which is close enough to the
scene of the house-father’s labors to suit
their case. So in that comparatively small
part of the city of Sydney which is used for
residential purposes—the part which isn’t
yet eaten up by shops and warehouses —life
is a strenuous business. And in the near
suburbs it isn’t much better.
The price of land is going up. That fact
is realised with satisfaction by the worker
who possesses his own cottage and allot-
ment, bought before the present boom set in,
and by the one who owns a few building
society shares. The cost of building is going
up because wages have increased all round.
Interest is going up bv reason of the cash
scarcity, and the cash scarcity is caused by
the ridiculously large export of gold which
goes out to pay for the ridiculously vast in-
flux of cheap labor goods which climb with
ridiculous ease over the ridiculously low
tariff wall. A very large proportion of
houses carry a mortgage, and as the rent
has to pay interest on the mortgage any
great increase of interest rates is a disturb-
ing influence. Then the policy of dragging
all the trade of N.S.W. to Sydney has
greatly increased the amount of space re-
quired in the city for shops, offices and
warehouses, and greatly reduced the area
available for residential purposes. And at
the same time the wonderful temporary ex-
pansion of commerce ; —caused partly by the
low tariff and partly by the policy of "drag-
ging everything to Sydney—has greatly in-
creased the number of persons—wharf
laborers, seafarers and the like —who want
either to dwell right alongside their jobs, or
to have very swift and cheap means of
reaching their jobs from outlying suburbs.
For these folk very little has been done. The
railway which might bring them in from the
southern suburbs still stops a mile or more
from Circular Quay, just as it has done
ever since N.S.W. began to have railways.
Places like Paddington, Waverley, Bondi,
Surry Hills. Balmain, Pyrmont, etc., are
just as well supplied with lines as they were
in the days of King Billy. The North
Shore bridge is where it was in the
time of Parkes or Exodus. The
tube railways are where they were in
the •timer of Abraham. The streets
are just about as wide as they were in the
time of that cheese-paring cavalier, Gov-
ernor Belmore, save that they are more
crowded, and it is more difficult to get along
them. And, in one sense at least, travelling
doesn’t grow cheaper. The engine-driver,
for instance, wants about twice the pay he
received 50 years ago, and no one can sho\v
that he shouldn’t get it. Thanks to all
these circumstances, the struggle for such
houses as are available in the business sec-
tion of Sydney has become intense,' and
rents have gone up—they have gone up to
exactly the figure that the person who wants
the house is willing to give rather than do
without the house. If rents are compul-
sorily reduced, as is proposed, then the
landlord will have less rent but more tenants
to choose from. And as he will doubtless
give the preference to the one who looks like
doing the premises least damage, and will
consider an elderly, childless philosopher as
more desirable at the price than a wharf
laborer with a large family—well, a com-
pulsory reduction of rents may not greatly
improve the situation for the present in-
habitants. In fact, it may lead to general
ejection of the present inhabitants.
* * * *
One method of dealing with the case is by
building tenement houses in narrow streets
—by putting families in one- and two-
roomed cells, and piling four or five fami-
lies on top of each other, and packing the
beehives close together. That is the Eng-
lish and Scotch method. It solves the diffi-
culty of the man who wants to live close to
his work by making him not so much a man
as one of the lower animals —except, of
course, when he is a cheap attic tenant, and
then he is one of the higher or sky-towering
animals. (In a geographical sense the lower
animal lives in the cellar.) By the east-
end-of-Glasgow methods fully 100,000 people
could be accommodated on the Rocks area of
Sydney. It is a simple device, but it isn’t
desirable. The other method is to make
transit so amazingly cheap and swift and
abundant that the worker could live twice
or three times as far from his job as at pre-
sent, without being ruined by loss of time
and railway fares. If railways could be
built at about half or one-third the present
cost, and coal was ss. a ton, and engine-
drivers could be hired at 4s. or ss. per day.
and other railway servants were paid in pro-
portion, this proposition would be worth
considering. As these things are impossible
as well as undesirable the proposition
doesn’t amount to much. To put the mat-
ter shortly, until man learns how to fly in a
rapid, reliable fashion at about one-eightb
of a penny per mile, there is no hope of
creating a big industrial and commercial
city in which the people can live under
cheap and healthy and civilised conditions.
A big city of the sort would cover so much
ground that the man on the fringe of things
would be outside the industrial hunt. The
struggle for room near the centre and along-
side the job is bound to produce unwhole-
some congestion and rack-renting under pre-
sent conditions. If the State takes over the
areas where the trouble is worst and decides
to prevent crowding and rack-renting, then
the coveted central position alongside the
Job will presumably go by favor instead of
by auction —perhaps by priestly favor, or
perhaps, by political favor, or possibly by
the accident of relationship to some Barn-
acle or Stiltstalking in office. That will
be little better for the person who is in and
quite as bad for the one who is out.
A proposition which has been mentioned
once or twice, and which might be alluded
to again, is that the State —-pending the
time when the ideal flying machine will
enable the worst-paid workman to reach his
job at. nominal cost from a distance of 10
miles inside a quarter of an hour —should
lay itself out to grow half a dozen or more
moderate sized commercial and industrial
cities instead of one bloated monster and a
wilderness. In six or a dozen cities of
-00,000 people apiece, it is possible for
every family to have a decent dwelling and
at least a scrap of garden, and yet the most
remote citizen can get to his place of toil in
reasonable time and without selling his fur-
niture to pay for travelling expenses. There-
fore, four families are not driven to dwell
in a five-roomed cottage in the middle of
the crush, nor does anybody offer an insane
rent for a mere kennel or shed or coal-
scuttle. But when there is only one city
and it contains 1,200,000 or 2,400,000
people things begin to happen—congestion,
rack-renting, disease and other troubles.
\\ hy the McGowen Government should
have such a boundless desire to drag all
commerce and industry to the private-land-
lord-owned city of Sydney, and thus create
over-crowding, dirt, ill-health, breathless-
ness, high rents and misery, when it could
relieve the pressure, and make a great
revenue, and do honor to its alleged prin-
ciples, by creating half a dozen State-owned
cities at other ports, no one has been able to
find out. Certainly no one can find out by
asking the McGowen Government. For ail
the answer that can be extracted from that
dreary conglomeration of Tory stodge one
might as well ask the dead.
THE CANONISATION OF THE
TRUST.
On Friday last, the High Court (consisting
of C. J. Griffith and Justice Barton, Jus-
tice O’Connor being away ill) delivered
judgment in the Vend Appeal. The deci-
sion amounts in effect, to a charter of lib-
erty of the fullest description to Trusts.
They may all come now, and do practically
what they please, and no one may say them
nay. The portentous judgment delivered
by Justice Isaacs was declared, last week,
to be bad from end to end, and from top to
bottom, and likewise sideways. The Coal
Vend and the Shipping Combine were pro-
nounced to be “laudable” institutions. The
High Court found that though these Trusts
had combined to raise prices as against the
public, though they had,, at times, supplied
inferior coal, and though they had brought
financial and every other sort of ruin on
those who would not join with them in their
scheme to keep up the cost of coal, yet there
was nothing “obviously unreasonable” in
their actions. Justice Isaacs, in inferring
that the prices fixed by the Vend were exces-
sive, was wrong. Who can decide, in a
trade mattter of this sort —containing, as it
does, thousands of ramifications and side-
lights and blind alleys and other strange
commercial mysteries—that any Vend is act-
ing unjustly because it elects to put its own
price on the goods it has to offer? Justice
Isaacs, in finding that would-be consumers
of coal had been so starved of the
commodity that the public suffered,
was in error. Nothing of the sort had
occurred in the opinion of the High Court.
In the words of the Sydney Telegraph
report:—•
There was no evidence that any actual detriment
to the public followed from a short delivery of coal
or non-supply of a particular kind of coal desired by
a customer.
Justice Isaacs’ strictures on boycotting
were unjust, not to say absurd. There was
no real harm in the boycott. On the con-
trary. The shipping combine did well from
practically every standpoint to drive Scott,
Fell and Co. into the Bankruptcy Court,
they (the insolvents) being fractious people
who insisted fatuously on standing alone in
a trade manner of speaking, and spurning
the virtuous Shipping Trust. Such persons
deserved to go undeT, and it was in the pub-
lic interest that they should be boycotted by
the Vend, since failing such treatment they
might be enabled to defy the Vend, which
would, consequently, languish, and so bring
more or less of a blight upon the land —
Vends being essentially “laudable” con-
cerns.
* V * * *
Of course, these amazing conclusions were
not stated in the bald terms that are used
above. They were toned down by a vast
and elaborate mass of argument and
rhetoric. Thus, as regards the exclu-
sion by the /end of outside competi-
tion (or, in’ plain terms, the boycotting and
subsequent destruction of such concerns as
defied the Combine), it was contended that,
after all, the public did not stand to be pre-
judiced by such practises. In fact, the pub-
lic could only be gainers. The exclusion of
outside competition meant, in reality, the
lowering of prices. And as for ruined
shipping cos. —well, they brought their down-
fall on their own heads, by their lack of en-
terprise, and so on. Perpend :
It was manifest that the only way in which they
(the vend) could exclude competition was by selling
at such prices that' 1 it would not pay anyone else to
sell at a lower rate. It was absurd to ask the Court
to believe that sufficient steam tonnage could not be
readily obtained in Australia to carry the coal of all
possible competitors.
In theory this is unassailable almost; in
practise every business man knows it
to be unadulterated flapdoodle and bosh.
Take the case of a trader who wanted 4000
or 5000 tons of coal, and ..didn’t feel dis-
posed to buy it from the Trust. In the first
place, he could only get it from a non-Vend
mine. There are very few mines of this
class in Australia, and they might be unable
to supply the sort of coal that was needed.
Assuming the coal was available, he could,
no doubt, “readily obtain steam tonnage” to
bear it to its destination. But it would
bring him face to face with two alternatives ;
viz. (1), he might charter a steamer ex-
pressly for the trip, and go bankrupt that
way; or (2), he might start in the shipping
business, on his own account, be mercilessly
undercut, as Scott, Fell and Co. were by
the affluent Vend, and so reach the Insol-
vency Court by a different route. Theoreti-
cally, anyone may compete successfully with
any Trust. The writer, for example, might
go over to America to-morrow, buy a few oil-
wells, purchase a strip of land, furrow it
with pipe lines and butt in against the
wealth and might of the Standard Oil,
people. The only thing that would hamper
him in such an enterprise would be the un-
willingness of th'e Standard Oil Co. to per-
mit him to survive. Prices might fall in the
neighborhood of his venture for a week, or a
month ; the public would benefit for a frac-
tional space of time ; and then he would go
under, and prices would leap to their old
mark, and possibly a bit over, and there
would be nought to the general good but a
financially exploded citizen.
There is no profit in considering
in detail the various arguments by
which the High Court seeks to estab-
lish its views that Vends, Trusts,
Monopolies (call them what you will),
far from being curses and social sores,
and extortionate Brigands, are benevolent, in
fact, almost sainted, affairs. The world
knows better. Let the Australian consumer
decide as to which of the two legal horses —-
Griffith or ISAACS—it is going to pay
him to back in this connection by an
examination of their form. The gist of the
Vend case was : Did the Combine do certain
things “with intent to restrain trade to the
detriment of the public”? Isaacs held —
and 999 normal common-sense Australians
out of every 1000 were with him at the time
—that where the public was mulcted of huge
sums by way of extravagantly-rinsed
coal charges; where the supplies of coal
were irregular ; where the public were habi-
tually unable to get the sort of coal they
wanted ; and where rival traders were cal-
lously ruined, it was a fair thing to infer
that trade had been restrained in a manner
detrimental to the public. And since those
disabilities were plainly the inevitable re-
sults of the agreement entered into by the
parties to the Vend, lie inferred further that
they were intended —just as the veriest
hedge-lawyer might deduce that the man who
loads a fowling-piece with No. 4 shot, and
stalks and aims at and slays a duck was in-
spired by a deliberate intent to compass the
death of the fowl. Griffith, C.J., speaking
for the High Court, scouts that view. He
admits the raising of prices by the Vend
(though he questions the “unreasonableness”
of the same, and inclines to the view,, any-
how, that no one is competent to say exactly
what is and is not reasonable in this
connection) ; he admits the remorseless wip-
ing-out of extra-Vend concerns; and he
admits that there were cases of (a) short
delivery of coal, and (b) non-delivery of the
particular kind of coal desired by customers.
But what of it, lie inquires blandly?' You
cannot infer an intent to injure the public
from any one or all of these happenings. The
intent of the parties was merely to make
money. So long as the dividends panned out
n ll right, the Vend, being, as aforementioned,
a most laudable institution, would not have
cared had the public gone completely un-
scathed. All they were concerned about was
to benefit themselves, and that being so, and
evil intent being absent, though various
lamentable results followed, they were all
irrelevant; and no one has anv cause to feel
annoyed about them.
Bv this latest decision Australia stands,
as has already been remarked, at the mercy
of every combine, local or foreign, which
cares to exploit it. As amended the other
day, the Australian Industries Preservation
Act laid the burden on a Vend of proving
that it did not intend to act to the detri-
ment of the public. As Griffiths now in-
terprets the Act, the defendants can dis-
charge that burden by the childishly simple
process of showing that what they were
doing was for their own benefit. Since the
U.S. Beef Trust, the Standard Oil,
the Sugar Trust, and every other old preda-
tory Combine that the world has ever
known, is palpablv out, first and foremost,
to earn money, the Commonwealth may
shortly expect the arrival of such a herd of
Trusts as the world has not seen hitherto.
The only possible way in which Parliament
can deal with an absolutely demented situa-
tion is for it to starkly declare that, what-
ever their intentions may be, all combina-
tions in restraint of trade are bad. A fatal
objection to that step lies in the fact that it
would make partnerships illegal, also sales
of goodwill, agreements not to compete, etc.
—all of which are forms of restraint of
trade. As a matter of fact, the scheme was
tried in the U.S. It worked so badly that
the Supreme Court reversed its decision and
declared that only “unreasonable” restraints
were bad. And who is going to agree as to
“unreasonableness” when experts like Grif-
fith and Isaacs differ?
There is but one way out. If the people
of Australia want Trusts, they can have
them, full measure and brimming over, by
merely sitting down and waiting a few
months. If, on the other hand, they decide
that there are no points about Trusts, and
that the Court which rises up and calls them


blessed, takes a distorted view of the situa-
tion, then they will be given a chance, pre-
sently, to act in accordance with their con-
victions. The Fisher Government’s Refer-
endum questions will contain a clause
authorising the Australian Parliament to
identify an injurious Trust on sight, and
compass its destruction. If there isn’t an
all but unanimous acquiescence in that
clause, at least, the people of this vast
land will be unworthy of the blessings of
free education and the franchise —in fact,
they will be unworthy of one flat, stale old
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gas Goose and the Real Estate
Gander.
A business-hike little deputation, which
waited recently on N.S.W. Premier
McGowen, must have left a somewhat sur-
prised politician behind it. It came to
propound the old grievance about advancing
rents and scarcity of dwellings, and though
it had no adequate remedy for the latter, it
had some ideas about the former. Possibly
it hardly realised how extensive its own
views were, or how logical they were, or
how r far they were likely to lead, or how
much interest they were calculated to
arouse. The scheme which the deputation
carried about with it was based apparently
on the McGowen Government’s gas mea-
sure. It proposed that a certain return
should be allowed on the capital originally
invested in buildings and land —possibly a
rather larger one than it was proposed
to allow the gas shareholders, but, like
it, calculated strictly on the original
investment. In ' other words, if land
sr gas shares had passed from hand
to hand, of from one speculator to
another, at an advance on the original cost,
no notice was to be taken of the advance in
either case, and the interest was to be
reckoned on the first investment only. The
deputation doubtless considered itself logical,
for a landowner is, within his limits, just as
much a monopolist as a gas co.—in fact, if
the gas co. is opposed by a municipal electric
lighting business, the landlord may fill the
bill better, in his small way, than the co.
does. But Premier McGowen, who is
certainly a landlord, and probably not a
gas shareholder, seemed a surprised man.
The analogy had probably not come to his
notice before. Of course, if the average
Sydney landlord is only permitted to collect,
say, 10 per cent, on the original capital, he
will, in most cases, collect on the value of
the building only. Most of Sydney land repre-
sents no original capital whatsoever, and
the rest represents hext to none. The early
rulers handed out abundant grants free of
charge—Redfern to one man, and Balmain
to another, and so on. The present values
are almost wholly—in many localities they
are wholly—the increased prices paid by
speculators, who thought they saw a good
thing ahead. Just as people have been
known to pay £lB for a share in a gas
monopoly which represented an original in-
vestment of £6, because they fancied tliev
would thereby make money, so other people
have been known to give £lO,OOO for a
scrap of land monopoly which represented
an original investment of perhaps 12/b m
fees and parchment, because of the same
reason. It was a staggering proposition,
and calculated to obliterate £20,000,000 or
£40,000,000 of Sydney land values in one act;
still it was based on a plausible par-
allel. But the rich Labor landlord-Premier
refused to see the point. He spoke the
deputation with fair, soft words, and sym-
pathised with its troubles, and assured
it that its case would receive all Pos-
sible consideration, and that the Gov-
ernment had its eye on the matter,
and had had its eye in that same
direction for a long time. The problem
passed away in a cloud of words, and the
parallel of the gas goose and the real estate
gander wasn’t argued out to the end.
A Seaport Where They Can’t Build
Ships.
The other day, one J. S. White, a rejected
politician of the Cabbage Garden, whom a
forgotten Government appointed as one ot
its representatives on the Melbourne Harbor
Trust, roused the ire of the city on the
Yarra by telling the officials of the IN.S.VV.
State Dockyard at Cockatoo Island that the
aforesaid Trust would presently be wanting
a tugboat, and, “as it can’t be built m Mel-
bourne, the Trust would be pleased it it
were built in Sydney or anywhere else, lhe
said Trust of which Stinking Fishite White
is a member, has all along persistently dis-
couraged Victorian shipbuilding of all
classes, by refraining, on various grounds,
from accepting local tenders. If it could
get a tug or a dredge built in Scotland or
Holland, or any old land, it would do so; if
it couldn’t, it would go to S’Africa to buy
one, or Maoriland, or Sydney—anywhere
rather than its own city. That is the policy
of which White has ever been an exponent.
Dredges, tugs, steamships, have all been con-
structed on the Yarra —the Platypus, by
Forman and Co., in ’7B; the Commissioner,
by Robison Bros., in ’7B; the Pelican,
Petrel and Penguin, by Johnson and Co., in
’BO, ’B4 and ’S9 respectively; the ij a Trobe,
by the Melbourne Steamship Co., in
’9l; the Lady Loch in ’B7; the
Nimmo, by Forman and Co., in ’S6, and the
Queenscliffe, Sprightly, Paynesville, Ad-
vance, Surprise. Vulcan. Sterling, etc., etc.
The boats have been built all right; and they
can still be built. And yet White, befoul-
ing his own nest, accidentally struck a great
truth. They aren’t built to-day by private
firms. The new State shipbuilding yards at
Williamstown are approaching completion,
and already the management is rushed with
orders —two hopper barges and two dredges
being contracted for, while inquiries are
being made for tugs and small steamers. But
the private firms are idle, and their Work-
shops rotting and their machinery rusting to
decay. All the above-mentioned vessels were
built prior to Federation, under the old Vic-
torian tariff. There was no duty on finished
vessels, but there were Protective duties on
many other items of manufactures of iron,
and the policy of the then province was Pro-
tective. The men trained to build the ves-
sels, and the plant and plans needed were all
at hand and in prime working order, and so
the articles could be turned out at less cost
than they can when the machinery has got
to be furbished up, the mechanics gathered
together, and the plans drawn up
Also, there were no Wages Boards in those
old days, and there wasn’t so vast a dittei-
ence between the labor cost here and tnat
in other countries as there is to-day, iNi< )W,
the plants and the staffs have gone to the
dogs—almost anything on earth will go to
ruin in 12 years, if nothing is done to it
and the sole reason for that is the complete
lack of protection afforded the engineering
and iron-manufacturing industries. H acl
the tariff that Charles Kingston wanted to
introduce been placed untouched on tne
Statute Book, the intervening years would
have seen, not one, but a dozen shipyards
on the Yarra, or at Westernport or 1 ort-
land ; and, instead of making a fuss over one
paltry tug, the shipbuilders would have
been turning out tugs and dredges before
breakfast, and building inter-State passenger
steamers during the day. The vessels /mue
been built right enough, but they aren t built
now. Nor are they likely. to be while the
manufacturer who is willing to risk his
money in expensive plant and the skilled
draughtsmen and mechanics are kept away
from the Commonwealth by a mongrel tariix.

and drawers of water.
The Reform which Gets There in Weeks,
and the One which Fails to Get
There in Years.
It is instructive to contrast the terrific
speed with which the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment rushes through the sort of measure
that really appeals to it, with the porten-
tous gradualness it invariably displays n?
regard to the other variety of measure, lo
cite a case in point, the Bill by which mem-
bers’ salaries have just been raised from
£3OO to £5OO per annum was hurried
through all its stages in a matter of weeks.
This paper has no brick to level at the
broad principle of that measure. Still, see-
ing that the hoisting of members remunera-
tion by some 70 per cent, is no part ot the
Labor platform; and seeing, also, that the
community has not been given any oppor-
tunity of saying whether or no it is yearn-
ing to pay the higher wage; and taking into
consideration the possibility of the electors
firmly turning down any such proposition,
in the event of its being submitted to them
in the form of a referendum —in view ot
these and other things it is safe to say that
it would have appeared more seemly had the
salary raising business been suffered to wait
upon various matters of a greater public
urgency. One of them was mentioned last
week in the Assembly when —
Cochrane, M.L.A., inquired of the Premier if it
was the Government’s intention to take steps for the
abolition of the office of State Governor.
Mr. McGowen replied that both the member for
Darling Harbor and himself knew the planks of the
platform unon which they were elected, and which the
Government would carry out when circumstances per-
mitted.
The desirability «of doing away with the
superfluous and absurdly costly figurehead
at Cranbrook is far more apparent than the
necessity of well-nigh doubling the salaries
of M’s.L.A. This reform is in the forefront
of the State Labor platform. It has the
warm support of practically every genuine
democrat outside Parliament and of a
goodly crowd of conservatives to boot. At a
bleak, cheerless time when cash is none too
plentiful and the State’s loan account has
just passed the One Hundred Million mark,
it would mean the saving of money in place
of the squandering of it. Meanwhile, the
best that the Government can do is to hint
guardedly that it will do something in the
way of abolishing the office of State Gover-
nor “when circumstances permit.” When,
in private life, a man owes another money,
and when he lets years go past without mak-
ing the slightest effort to discharge the
debt, and when, incidentally, he is discov-
ered to be paying other accounts in regard to
which his moral obligations are infinitely
less, the creditor has a tendency to grow
restive. It begins to dawn on him that the
debtor never intends to settle up, if the un-
pleasantness can possibly be avoided. There
is, a powerful analogy between that situation
and the position of the McGowen Govern-
ment as regards the State Governor. Had
the Ministry been really serious in this
matter it could have put it through as easily
and as swiftly as it did the Raised Salary
business. As a matter of fact,, its every
action indicates that it is not serious. The
ousting of Governor-General Denman from
Federal Government House has given keen
pleasure to those who understand the fine
points of the State Rights game (Geebung
incorrigibles of the Joseph Carruthers
stamp, for example) inasmuch as they know
that the next move will be the instalment
of the State Governor there. And when a
Labor Cabinet has perpetrated, or paved the
way for the perpetration of this infamy,
what is the ensuing Liberal Administration
likely to be that it should object? This scan-
dal of the seemingly imperishable office of
State Governor affords yet another solemn
warning to the taxpayers of N. S. Wales in
regard to the wild folly of returning mili-
tant State Righters to the Assembly.
The Crooked Question that Turneth
Away Truth.
Melbourne Age, discussing the ancient cry
for Scripture lessons in Victorian State
schools, remarks that the very men and
women who forever rail against the typical
Jesuit of sectarian agitation are themselves
trying to gain their end by “Jesuitical”
means. The latest proposal of the Bible-
class “pushers” is a Referendum vote on the
question—-
Are you in favor of unsectarian lessons being im-
parted to children whose parents do not object, by
teachers who have no conscientious objection to im-
parting the instruction?
The fraudulencv of which drag-net question
is almost frank in its artfulness. The
average parent who believes in the principle
of secular education at State schools, and
has even a profound disrespect for any re-
ligious teaching of the young in church
prayers, or “grace before meat,” or any other
set form, is not unfavorable to the idea of
other people’s children being taught any-
thing that their parents don’t object to, by
teachers who are willing to impart the vague,
unspecified instruction. Every thoughtlessly
liberal-minded voter would mark “Yes” to a
question which practically forbids “No” for
an answer, and the majority vote of Believ-
ers and Unbelievers would count as a tri-
umph for Bible-pushery, whereas a straight
question as to the maintenance or destruc-
tion of the present secular system of educa-
tion would result in a crushing defeat of
its enemies. The plan of attack on the sys-
tem is masked by the “Jesuitical” wording
of it. If it were to get Parliamentary
sanction Protestant dogmatic instruction,
followed, no doubt, by Catholic dogmatic in-
struction, would creep into State schools
disguised as a thing of no importance, and
the defenders of the neutral ground between
Church and State would be blown out be-
cause they did not know the gun was
loaded. This is what is hoped for by the
righteous regular church-goers who denounce
as abominable the Jesuitry of their Orange-
tinted imagination, whilst commending the
Jesuitry which is under their nose for its
fair, impartial reasoning. Seemingly the
Bible-pushers will fail in their attempt to
get a Referendum vote on account of their
persistent opposition to any non-Jesuitical
sort of voting paper. The policy of the
secular education system is plain enough to-
day (whatever the purpose of its authors
may have been), but a plain proposal to re-
verse it is not to the taste of the little
crowd that shrieks and snuffles for a Refer-
endum. A crooked design cannot be exe-
cuted on straight lines. Where a direct
negative is positively essential, no qualified
affirmative, or combination of qualified affir-
matives, will fill the bill, or vice versa. It
is as though the Government were to ask:
“Are you averse to the exclusion from Sun-
day school of unconcerned children if their
parents don’t wish them to be deeply in-
structed in the relations between Jonah and
the whale?”

A Superfluous Convention.
Dear Bulletin, —The Greater Sydney Con-
vention Bill aims, at the best, at achieving
an immediate need in the most leisurely
possible manner. With the examples of Glas-
gow, London, Berlin, etc., at its disposal, the
Legislative Ass. of N.S.W. had no neces-
sity whatever to fall back on the guidance
of a number of citizens at £lOO a time, some
of whom may have given the question of city
unification careful thought, but the majority
of whom will, almost certainly, be quite
ignorant of the matter in hand. The Con-
vention sittings will be used, doubtless, by
many of the members for the purpose, of
acquiring some smattering of civic lore, just
as George Reid learned the elements of his
Anti-Socialistic creed long after his plat-
form war against the low-comedy Menace
had started. And in the process much valu-
able time will be lost. It is even more
likely—since most of the Convention mem-
bers will, in the nature of things, be aider-
men, and suburban aldermen at that —that,
after months of blither and acres of flap-
doodle, every scheme for the institutmn of
a Greater Sydney that is broached will be
turned down. Now this is one of those
matters which simply cannot wait, unless the
biggest city in Australasia is prepared to
face plain chaos in the near future. The
congestion trouble is swelling in a
manner that is discernible with the
naked eye. Last week a deputation, which
claimed to represent many . thousands of
workers in the metropolis, waited on Premier
McGowen, and supplied him with harrow-
ing details on the subject of the housing pro-
blem. The latter mentioned feebly that—
The Government was as much in sympathy with
the movement as the members of the deputation.
The Government would welcome suggestions. But
they would recognise the difficulties of the Govern-
ment, and this problem of housing was not the least
of them.
A point which he omitted to comment on
was that the only feasible solution of the
housing trouble is bound up with the im-
mediate institution of a Greater Sydney. A
little good may be done by the provision of
cheap bricks: a few more workers may be
accommodated at Daceyville in time: and
there are other ways in which about a ha’-
porth of present benefit may be wrought at
the cost of some ss. worth of effort. But
these are mere sops. The problem is already
immeasurably too vast for them to affect it,
and it is growing daily. The needed reforms
are the, construction of a North Shore Bridge
which, with the aid of a railway, will open
up more or less cheap residential areas adja-
cent to Middle Harbor, and the building of
underground railways which will link the
city with the outlying suburbs. Various Gov-
ernments —Progressive, Liberal and Labor —
have been trying to summon up the nerve to
do one or other of these things for the past
30 years or more. They have all refrained
for no better reason- than that they feared
to enrage the proprietors of the country
vote, and thereby lose their jobs. A Greater
Sydney Council will be in no such predica-
ment. On the contrary. One of its first
moves will surely be to embark on the job
of bringing Sydney’s traffic system up to
date. Which is merely another way of say-
ing, amongst other things, that it will attack
the housing problem or curse in its most
vital spot. But it has to get born first. With
weird perversity, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment, by its Convention measure, is taking an
effective step to obviate, or at any rate
delay, the joyful event. —Yours in an atmo-
sphere of fury, Henri Singemoine.

A Wages Board for parsons would seem to
be one of the possibilities of the future. The
man who keeps on telling people that this
world is a passing flicker naturallv looks for
his payment in the golden paradise which
has been made out of the unclaimed salaries
of saints; but he needs enough dross here to
keep him alive and sufficiently well-dressed
to make rfternoon calls and attend funerals,
christenings, bazaars, sales of work, synods,
mothers’ meetings and the rest of the curious
medley of clerical dissipations. Too often
the meek soul-guide is the most miserably
paid worker in the parish. He does his up-
lifting and his Wowsing at sweating rates,
and begs desperately on behalf of remote,
happy heathen who mostly hate him, and
local" hard-ups who don’t thank him, while
he himself scuffles about and practises all
sorts of cramping private economies, know-
ing all the time that the supreme posts of
his holy profession are invariably given to
imported saints, and that his woeful flat hat
will always be in the rear ranks. The
lamentable narrow-mindedness and bitterness
which so often spoil the parson must be in
some measure attributable to the way he is
fleeced and snubbed by his employers. The
Sydney clergyman who was recently dis-
covered to be doing the Lord’s work for a
miserable £BO per year is a tragic instance
of religious serfdom. That sort of dole must
mean endless anxiety and cruel cheesepar-
ing ; and when cheeseparing and financial
worry are added to nervous strain, the re-
sult is hysteria and incredible stories about
35 drunken infants reeling out of a brightly-
lighted pub. A Wages Board for parsons
would do away with that sort of dangerous
blither and make haloes more popular than
they are.

Melbourne Argus, forgetting its allegiance
to Private Enterprise, has unconsciously
lapsed into Socialistic sentiment. The
schemes for exploiting the alleged brown coal
resources of Morwell and Altona Bay to
supply power for the electrification of the
Melbourne railway system has aroused the
Argus to a new sense of the State’s com-
mercial duties to its public shareholders: —
The natural expectation would be that the electric
current would be State-owned and controlled. .. .
The proposal, if carried out, will place the control
of an essential part of the system in outside hands —
which is certainly undesirable, and could only be
justified by absolute proof that thereby large
economies will be secured which the State could not
effect through its own agencies. .. .Under no cir-
cumstances should any exclusive right to such a con-
cession be made to any company, as it would create
a most improper monopoly.... Are all the brown
coal deposits in the hands of syndicates, and, if not,
why should not the State act independently of any
syndicate, and supply its own requirements?
This from the old organ ot Private Enter-
prise which snorted, not so long ago, at the
action of the Vic. Government in opening
its own coal mine at Wonthaggi to compete
with private producers of railway locomotive
force. The Argus forgets for the moment
that it has hitherto approved, without re-
servation, of an essential part of the railway
system being in outside hands. Having
turned Socialistic as regards brown coal, the
traitor to Private Enterprise may presently
extend its sympathies to the older mineral
that has become black.
“Curse o’ Moses” : The proposal to remove
the Maoriland capital from Wellington to
some inland position, where a model city
could be established on State lands, beyond
the range of an invader’s guns, has very
much to recommend it, and has gained so
largely in the matter of support that it is
now well within the range of practical poli-
tics. George Lauren son, in bringing the
suggestion forward, pointed out that the
cost of the undertaking would be paid from
the start through the rents to be derived from
the present public buildings in Wellington,
and those paid by civil servants, for their
State-owned homes in the new city. The
Maoriland capital problem is not on all fours
with that of Australia, but there. are definite
reasons for a removal from Wellington, and,
if the thing can really be achieved at no
initial cost, and with a decent prospect of
profit to the Dominion in the future, it
ought to be put in hand at once. Welling-
ton is a congested place, heavily handicapped
by the boots of Private Enterprise, and
full of a certain commercial . odor, or
emanation, or influence, or something, which
gets into the political nostrils and spoils
promising men. It has also an infernal cli-
mate, and must be approached through the
dangerous Cook Straits, while it is so ex-
posed that a few ships lying oft Island Bay
could batter the city to pieces without risk-
ing an encounter with the guns or mines
which are supposed to protect the harbor, but
probably don’t. Laurenson’s scheme looks
about the best means yet suggested for grap-
pling with the question of the national debt.
There is very little doubt that a city, State-
owned and controlled, would. be about the
best money-making venture into which a
Government could well go.. The city landlord
knows well enough the solid value of bricks
and mortar when the population is growing
and expanding. It is in the Maoriland
Government’s power not only to build the
city, but to practically make certain of its
holding a teeming population. The thing is,
of course, plain Socialism, but it is Socialism
in about as practicable a form, as it well
could be presented. Also, the thing could be
done without going to Cohen for a single
penny.
The last idea of sanguine Premier Watt,
of Victoria, concerning the Greater Mel-
bourne Council, is to push his Bill as far as
the second reading stage, and then hang it
up till next year. He reckons he cant get
it passed much before December, 1913, and
it will be the latter end of T 4 before Greater
Melbourne gets going. In the interim he
proposes to stall off the loud demands tor
new tram lines by creating a new and im-
proved Tramways Trust, which will attend
to immediate requirements, and will subse-
quently merge itself into the big Council.
That shows the weakness, of a rusher like
Watt. A seasoned politician would have
made these proposals last him a decade; in
fact, some veteran battlers would nave lived
on the Greater Melbourne Council idea for
a political lifetime—and then left it for
someone else. It is a pity Matt is so
sudden. There will be nothing left for him
to do presently.

The Victorian Government recently closed
down on Private Enterprise in the matter
of cutting piles and poles in the State forests
about Heathcote and Bendigo. The contract
timber-getters were chased off the reserves,
and men were employed by the Forestry De-
partment to cut piles and poles for both
Federal and State purposes. The persons
who had been hunted away then began to
make a row, and the noise has been increas-
ing ever since, until the tumult has become
like that of the Goths descending on Rome,
armed with bagpipes and kerosene tins., lhe
move on the part of Watt and Co. is sup-
posed to be driving trees and other capital
out of the country at a great rate, and before
long it may be bursting up the
marriage tie or doing any horrible
old thing. Still, the Government is
paving higher wages than Private. En-
terprise did, and .getting its timber
at a lower rate than it used to do. If the
clamor which is being raised doesn t frighten
the authorities into going back on their de-
cision (as it probably will), the State forests
mav yet be saved from utter destruction.
Under the new arrangement only the timber
actually authorised and marked by the
Department officials is allowed to be cut,
while P.E. had a way of rampaging through
the bush like a mob of drunken elephants,
and smashing down anything that came in.
its way.

Private Enterprise Gets a jLeg-rup.
As might have been expected, the Private
Enterprise of Victoria has communed with
the Watt Ministry, and, perceiving that
that conglomeration has a new milch cow
“coming in,” in a manner of speaking, has
arranged to skim off for itself the cream of
the beast’s yield. In this case the milch cow
is the supply of power for the about-to-be-
electrified suburban railway system. Watt
and Co. have just decided to build a power
station at Yarraville, capable of supplying
barely 25 per cent, of the electric force re-
quired, and to obtain the other 75 per cent,
from Private Enterprise—in this instance
the Victorian Minerals Development Co.,
which proposes to work the brown coal de-
posits at Morwell, and the Altona brown coal
collieries, at Altona Bay. Not only are
Watt and Co. thus —er —kind to their Pri-
vate Enterprise friends, but they propose to
take their regular daily supplies from them,
and to use the State’s power-house product
only at busy times of the day, and when an
abnormal rush of traffic occurs. As the
Age nicely puts it :
This arrangement ensures that for normal traffic
practically the whole of the power will be drawn
from the private stations ; the outside firms will thus
be enabled to sell power at an exceptionally cheap
rate, as with a steady output they are freed from the
usual expense of plant to meet fluctuating demand.
It is a charming piece of special pleading,
and the grocery firm director who abandoned
to his competitors his staple lines—tea,
coffee, sugar, etc.—and stuck solely to side
lines like biscuits, arrowroot and so forth,
might talk just as seductively to his share-
holders ; but the chances are they would
heave him out notwithstanding. As to the
price to be paid for the brown coal product,
Watt says nothing, but as, under the condi-
tions stated, the spasmodic State-produced
power cannot hope to be as cheap as that of
the regularly employed companies, the latter
can charge a comparatively high price, make
a good profit, and still strut around as. a
gaudy example of the superiority of Private
Enterprise over State undertakings. An-
other matter that Watt has carefully re-
frained from explaining is why he, though
acting under the Immediate guidance of ex-
pert Merz, yet rejected Mekz’s proposal for
generating all the power required at Yarra-
ville, and selected the necessarily costly plan
of obtaining the article from three different
sources. There is no earthly reason why
the State shouldn’t build a power-house at
Yarraville, large enough to supply, not only
the suburban railway requirements, but pri-
vate consumers as well. Merz recommended
that, and what was the use of paying Merz
for his advice, and then passing it into the
disused tank in the back lane?
“Bows” lodges a strenuous indictment: —
I see in the S. M. Herald (10/9/’l2) that Com-
mander Brewis, R.N.R., an imported lighthouse ex-
pert, and Captain Hacking, Superintendent of the
N.S.W. Navigation Department, have returned from
their inspection of the: lighthouses of N.S.W., and are
able to report that “everything is satisfactory.” 1
presume that verdict may be taken to include Port
Kembla < where the eastern breakwater (lacking so
much as one ordinary two-candle-power warning
lamp) was responsible the other night for the wreck
of the Camboyne. The experts who could find no-
thing to kick against in connection with the un-
lighted ■ eastern and northern breakwaters of Port
Kembla would naturally approve of the Wollongong
light, surely one of the most ridiculous burlesques
of a coastwise light by the side of all the great
waters. It may be, of course, that the glimmer is
intended only to indicate the end of the breakwater
to vessels entering Wollongong harbor. But in that
case a hurricane lamp hung on a clothes pole would
be equally serviceable. From Smith Head Light to
Perpendicular Head Light the distance is 78 miles,
and if we except the miserable pale-green fixed apol-
ogy that looks like the eye of a cat at Kiama, there
is not in all that vast expanse so much as a glow-
worm to keep a vessel off the rocks. Neither Per-
pendicular Head Light nor South Head Light show
an unbroken arc along the coast, both being parti-
ally obscured by headlands over a large area that is
constantly used for navigation. Do Commander
Brewis and his friend consider this satisfactory ?
What is badly wanted, in view of the increasing
Kembla trade, is an efficient group-flash light of not
less than 20 miles’ range, placed ch the outer of the
Five Islands off Red Point. For the rest, half our
coastwise lights are fixed lights of low power illumi-
nants which would be considered obsolete in anv
other part of the world.
Incidentally, Montague I-land Light is still uncon-
nected per telegraph with the mainland. South Head
Light, through the late change in power, has lost half
its efficiency as a long-range beacon. Crowdy Head
Light, as ever, throws a danger light over clear
water between Crowdy and Diamond Heads —a chan-
nel of the greatest value to coasters working north
and south in strong, westerly winds —instead of
merely marking a safe distance off the Mermaid
Shoal. And yet every tiring is satisfactory! If re-
assurance in this connection hadn’t come direct from
an imported expert, I should have said that there
was foolishness, not to say idiocy, behind that cheer-
fully optimistic report,
“J.D.H.” gives him a send-off: —
Died in Sydney (11/9/T2) “Billy” Whitten
(M.L.C., Papua), senior partner of AVhitten Bros.,
storekeepers, traders, recruiters, planters, etc., all
along the Papuan coast. He was a Cockney, and
came originally to New Guinea (no one spoke of
Papua then). in the train of the first Governor of the
“Possession,” Major-General Sir Peter Scratchlev.
R.E. “Billy” was steward or chef, or stipendiary
bottle-washer or something on the old Governor Black-
all, which was Scratehley’s royal vaclit or barge, or
gilded wheelbarrow of the sea, so to speak. The old
warrior presently died iof malaria, and Whitten’s
story of how they brought the remains to Cooktown
was one of the most realistic chapters of the unpub-
lishable: history of New Guinea. The deceased poten-
tate was laid reverentially in an improvised coffin on
the table of the after-cabin, and the sad rite being
performed, all hands hastened to get as far for’ard
as they could. There was a strong wind blowing
astern. Even then the old Governor B. couldn’t
kick out more than five knots, and it was many a
long, oppressive day before the signal hill at Cook-
town , hove up.
Whitten made liis first big rise on the Yodda and
Gira fields, in the Northern Division, as storekeeper,
etc., and gradually added other irons to the fire
At one time he practically recruited all the labor
for the northern fields, and mighty was the mana of

But, of course, the play at Sydney Palace
didn’t really run off the well-worn melo-
dramatic rails in that reckless fashion. It
trundled straight along the safe main line,
stopping only at wayside stations when some
superfluous character had to be murdered.
Miss Madge Hope, who Appears as Edith
Coventry, the Squire’s daughter, is entitled
to honorable mention. The rest of the cast
may be allowed to escape the hateful ordeal
of having their names paraded before the
public. The plot (its age protects it) will
not be torn to pieces by this irreverent pen.
which will stop here. As the curiously sedate
villain might have remarked to the wronged
and moaning gardener: “By Fenven. sir. if
you were a younger man, I would run for my
life!”

The bustling story of “Get-Rich-Quick
Wallingford” is now in its eighth week at
Sydney Criterion, and it is still necessary to
book early. With a lot of people "Walling-
ford” is developing into a habit. A bright,
natural show, full of finished characterisation
and movement, it deserves all it gets. And
it is getting full houses.
Miss Emma Litchfield pleads guilty to the
latest outbreak at the Adelphi—“The Queen
of the Redskins” ; and she is hereby advised
to give it up and get married, or, in default,
is bound over to keep the peace for 12
months. The new productioil is a compound
of the ordinary bellowdrama and Tivoli. The
customary melo. theme runs through it, with
this exception, that Indians (look at the pro-
gramme if you doubt it) are, for the most
part, substituted for the more common
whites. The Tivoli element is introduced by
an alleged nigger, who blithers at great
length after the style of the ordinary murky
corner man. “The Queen of the Deadskins”
covers no new ground. All bellowdramas
are supposed to contain a moral, however
vague, and the moral in this one is particu-
larly obscure. The most likely one, seeing
that .the villain gets in first and marries the
heroine, is “The Early Bird Catches the
Worm,” though it is a gross injustice to call
the heroine a worm —she doesn’t -speak like
a worm, anyway. It wouldn’t be an injus-
tice to call the villain anything—except a
villain. George Cross, as William Lynd-
hurst, alias Broncho Bill, is all that a cow-
boy hero could be, except when he upsets
things in the third act, just when they are
getting interesting—-from the villain’s point
of view. Nellie Fergusson makes her re-
appearance as the villainess, and Nellie
Bramby makes a splendid Wahneetali, the
Poor wronged Indian girl, also the heroine.
The scenery, especially in the final act, and
the costumes are all very picturesque.
***:{:
Sydney Royal is finishing up a fill-in week
of “Camille,” as this issue of The Bulletin
gets on to the bookstalls. Although the
present co., headed by Hilda Spong and Ear-
court Beatty, gives the dreary old thing a
decent run to the cold and silent tomb, the
public has stayed away in battalions, and
gone to the Firm’s other productions, which
are both bright and joyous, and don’t possess
one cough between them. The partially-
furnished auditorium may have something to
do with it, but the present version of the
great five-act coughdrama lacks fire. How-
ever, all the blame cannot be dumped on the
paying side of the footlights. Beatty’s force-
fur style is too hard for the lovesick and tire-
some Armand, and all the artistry of Hilda
Spong cannot hide her agreeable plumpness.
In the emaciated role of Camille, the Flesh
is the Devil. While this Camille is faint-
ing, and gasping, and dabbing her ripe lips
with a handkerchief, the Flesh is signalling
cheerily, “Only acting, you-know! Don’t
let yourself be depressed and carried away!
Look at us! We’re as right as the -bank !”
And it is quite impossible to disregard it. Of
the other people, Emma Temple makes a
quite credible Madame Prudence; A. J. Pat-
rick is somewhat stiff as Count de Varville;
and Herbert Leigh is fairly successful as the
elder Duval, who rescues his precious Ar-
mand. Rene Tanswell (Mam’selle Olympe),
Dorothy Gumming (Nichette), and' Enid
Bpnnett (Nanine)- fill in the feminine part
of the picture gracefully. On Saturday night,
the co. will stage “The Woman,” a modern
play which has a good deal to say on the
popular subject of graft, and is, therefore,
calculated to draw a lot better than the
dispiriting and artificial “Camille.” As a
brine pump, “Camille” appears to have had
its day. At any rate, it cannot compete
with two cheerful shows.

“Rather brief, but very dainty,” is the
verdict when the Three Sisters Macarte have
made their final bow after their Japanese
turn at Sydney Tivoli. As a matter of fact,
only the opening of the turn is Jap. The
rest is graceful wire-walking with a Jap.
background. When the scene opens, the
stage is in blue limelight. The three sisters
are seated near the footlights, and the lan-
terns in the background' complete as pretty
a stage picture as has been seen for some
time. To-night, Chinko, the youthful jug-
gler will put away his silk hat, his stick
and gloves, gather up his teddy bears and
depart. So, also, will Millie Kaufman, the
pretty trick cyclist. Other turns which are
keeping the box office from being dead are
Whistler Borneo Gardiner, La Freya’s pic-
ture show, and the Rallis and Wilson Trio
On Tuesday night, when this was being
delivered into the hands of the printer, the
De Serris models began a farewell season of
six nights. All who missed this troupe on
its last visit are advised not to fail to see
it now.

On Monday night, the show at J. D
Williams’ Empress Theatre (Sydney) was
brought to a full stop by a fire which broke
out in a paint and oil shop next door. How-
ever, although only a wall divided the two
places and the paint shop became a furnace
the Empress was undamaged, and before
tlie fire was out the police allowed the .per-
formance to continue. Writer witnessed the
conflagration, and decided that even if the
Empress were dropped into Sheol it wouldn’t
burn. At the Crystal Palace a good pic-
ure entitled “Earl William” a drama of
the loth century, _ when knights were bold
washed occasionally, occupied most of
the attention. “Williams’s Weekly,” at the
same theatre, contained the usual budget of
local happenings. At the Lyric and Col-
onial llieatres the programmes were well up
to the standard.
“THE QUAKER GIRL”
AT HER MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.

“The Chocolate Soldier’’ continues to lure
the discerning to Her Majesty’s;, Sydney.
Some time in the dim future, when Sydney
wearies of Shaw’s warrior, as portrayed by
Talleur Andrews, “Dorothy” is to be revived
at this playhouse.
By the time these lines appear, the large
and resplendent Miss Beaumont Collins will
have returned to the National Amphitheatre
(Sydney) with her one-act marrow-freeze,
or potted shudder, “The House of Terror.”
This turn is the one pool of blood, so to
speak, on a smiling landscape. The other
Amph. stars—-Lawrence Barclay, the Do,
Re, Mi Trio, Hamlin and Mack, and Hux-
ham’s serenaders—are all notably cheery
folks.

The long Anderson season of melodrama
is nearing its end at Adelaide Royal. Cyril
Mackay makes a fine, manly John Storm in
yet. another version of “The Christian,”
which cuts out the hospital and the monas-
tery, but shows the music-hall, and con-
denses the story into four acts, with a happy
ending. Miss Eugenie Duggan is an excel-
lent Glory—except in the first act —and the
support is admirable. The King’s has a
strong bill, headed by the Bartz three, who
do some reckless diving from the wire, and
Wong Toy Sun, an alleged Chinaman whose
conjuring apparatus is of great completeness
and effect. (But a conjurer who does not
talk leaves something lacking.) Blanche
Carelli is still singing, and Budd and Clare
have just come in. At the Tivoli, Nella
Webb talks her unusual American songs
with a charm all her own, and the Stavor-
dale quintette imitate the human voice re-
markably with their banjoes. Those comical
cusses, Rich and Rich, have made an imme-
diate success, while Vivian and Alton, and
the Alginas, supply the athletic element.
Wondergraph is starring “Fra Diavolo”
plus much of its music, and all the picture
houses have got in early with the football
final.. Other’s shows include boxing at the
Stadium, a tug-of-war entertainment at the
Exhibition, a Knox organ recital, a Reeves
elocution, William Robyns and co. reviving
the Omar song-cycle, “A Persian Garden,”
and sundry Scottish pipers’ evenings.
“WHAT WOMEN SUFFER.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Squire was quite an idiot, and very old
and mean;
His nephew, whom he trusted, had a record
most unclean;
He had designs upon the Will, and smoked
cigars and swore;
And when he hired a murderer he did it in
a roar —
Upon the victim’s doormat, in a confidential
roar.
The hero was a sailor brave—a bluff and
honest chap,
In short and sticky whiskers and a lovely
naval cap ;
His wife the old Squire’s daughter was ; his
infant son so gay
Was just a pretty little girl. (That is the
usual way ;
Small boys have too much self-respect to
figure in a play).
The old Squire choked the angel child, and
thrashed his dear Mammar,
Then suffocated Dad with one insanely cheap
cigar.
The villain, shocked by these events,' to Holy
Orders took,
And brought the boresome “funny” wretch
with threats of Hell to book.
The old and loafing gardener he also seized
and shook.
The stage police were “at a loss,” and also
“in the dark” ;
The old Squire met the lady who was “Lost”
down in the park ;
He called her “Kid,” and pinched her ear,
and took her out to dine ;
Then bullied sundry waiters when they lin-
gered at the wine.
Oh! it was auite original! The critic
thought it fine!

The official announcement at Melbourne
Princess’s last Saturday was “Good News
for the Irish,” signifying that Allen Doone
and co. had opened a five-weeks’ season wid
“The Wearing of the Green.” This innocu-
ous play of stage-Irish sintiment begins and
ends in Dublin, or thereabouts. In the
garden of the Shamrock Inn the characters
meet to explain themselves. Their costumes,
likewise the fact that somebody was hanged
last week for whistling “The Wearin’ of the
Green,” suggest a bygone period, yet the
outfit of Norah’s alleged studio in the next
act might have been borrowed from the
dining-room of an East Melbourne hashery.
Two old gentlemen have conspired to marry
Allen Doone to an heiress, who narrowly
escapes elopement with a loud-tongued vil-
lain ; but the gentle Doone adores, and is
adored by, Norah acushla, and an amiable
British baronet is accessory to their mutual
esteem. Moreover, the vociferous villain
favors a union between Doone and the im-
pecunious heroine, instead of himself pur-
suing her with base intentions. The only
obstacles in the path of true love are the
two fine old gentlemen, who say they’ll be
damned if they will when they are begged
to relent. Nothing remains for Doone but
to earn his living as a vocalist, to which
end he steps into the shoes of Miles O’Regan,
the local Caruso, and faces a crowded pic-
torial audience at the Dublin Hall of liar'’
mony. The silent, inhuman audience is
understood to have been clamoring wildly
for O’Regan, instead of Doone, the evening
long. The debut of the novice is a terrible
ordeal. He has backed himself to either
“knock the house” or break Norah’s heart- —
which is the swatest and tinderest heart in
all Oireland —so, as a last resort, he strikes
up “The Wearing of the Green,” and scores
an inartistic triumph. The old gentlemen,
having withdrawn their opposition to his
marriage, Doone takes his bride to America,
leaving the noisy villain to be fined 40 “bob”
for inciting the Hall of Harmony to cry
“Booh !”
* * * *
Allen Doone and his dramas have so little
vice in them that they invariably drive the
present reporter to temperance drinks be-
tween the acts. The dialogues are of the
florid stodgy, or poetic fustian, order, and
the plots excite one like a long-sleever of
milk and soda. Notable features of “Wear-
ing of the Green” are Doone’s emerald-tinted
garments and four tuneful warblings. His
warble to Norah McNamara is very effective,
and his rendering of Ireland’s national bal-
lad could only be surpassed in spirited
declamation by a tame curate singing “The
Death of Nelson” to an aged aunt whose
health was so delicate that the least shock
would kill her. Apart from his musical
turns, the easy, natural, unobtrusive thea-
tricalism of Doone is delightful to such as
enjoy his dramas, and soothing to such as
don’t. Miss Jgdna KeelCy acts prettily on
orthodox Norah lines, and most of the mem-
bers of the' co. understand their business
thoroughly. Some of them may be expected
to understand it better in the hereafter.

Gregan McMahon’s Repertory Co. com-
mence another season at Melbourne Athen-
aeum Hall to-night (Thursday) with Gals-
worthy’s “The Pigeon,” which may, or may
not, have been suggested by “Passers-by.”
The comedietta “Makeshifts” comes as after-
piece to “The Pigeon.” McMahon will
strengthen the cßst of both performances by
having a personal say in them, A revival
of “John Gabriel Borkman” is the bill for
Saturday, and “The Return of the Prodi-
gal,” by St. John Hankin, closes the 6th
chapter of Repertory drama on Tuesday
next.
According to the advt., “On Our Selection,”
at Melb. King’s, is attracting “the squatter
from his homestead and the shearer from his
hut.” When this paper last looked in at
the King’s, it did not notice either of the
persons mentioned, but it observed Billo, of
Collingwood, with his little bit of orright in
the gallery, and Arthur, of South Yarra, sit-
ting alongside Muriel in the stalls; and there
wasn’t room for any more Billo in the one
place, and, if an attempt had been made to
squeeze some more Muriel or a further quan-
tity of Arthur into the other, the theatre
would probably have burst, with a loud re-
port like a rent Marriage Tie. “On Our
Selection” appeals to the great heart of Mel-
bourne, as any decent drama with genuine
local color is liable to do. As Dad, Bert
Bailey wins laughter by legitimate means,
whereas Ned Duggan, as an utterly super-
fluous Hibernian, gets most of his humor out
of the toe of his right boot, and is the only
really non-Australian character in the play.
The verdancy of Ned’s Hibernian belongs to
the green-room, and not to John Bull’s Other
Island. Last week this paper, with child-
like trust, accepted the assurance of the pro-
gramme that Dave, of the expansive grin,
was played by Arthur Bertram; but the
document was unveracious. The credit for
this excellent bit of character acting is hereby
transferred to Fred McDonald. Arthur Ber-
tram is entitled to a bouquet of rather
smaller dimensions, for his performance as
Joe, but any sort of bouquet must be accented
as a mark of high appreciation in these days
of costly vegetables.
At West’s Palace, Melbourne, on .Satur-
day, Joachim Murat, N. Bonaparte’s mar-
shal and slap-dash King, had his life threat-
ened twice by one Perugini, but escaped
without damage to his person or composure.
A Dutch drama, with Dutch interiors and
dreadful pants and hoofwear pervading those
interiors, was somewhat baldly described as
“The Lock”; while a Yankee play with a
nice girl, a medico and an influential kid
was presented to the world as “Lulu’s Doc-
tor.” A shaky subject was “Beetles,” a
trick comedy which might have been devised
by the Religious Editor during a temporary
desertion of the water bottle.

Of several new turns that eventuated at
Melbourne Opera House on Saturday, the
best was provided by the Schenk Brothers.
The head and hand balancing of the two is
good enough to justify the applause with
which it is received. Margo, .“the Mystic
Lady,” pleases this paper, without astounding
it. The audience is requested by her to
name its poison, and she supplies anything
within reason—beer, milk, whisky, wine or
liqueur —pouring the moisture out of a jug
of water into apparently empty wine glasses.
She afterwards has the drinks handed round
among the boys, and the boys inform her that
they are. genuine. Maybe the brightness of
the lady’s smile deceives the palate. Other
new arrivals* are Burns and Bentley, foot
shufflers, whose turn is described as “the
acme of simultaneous movement.” Any
motion that Burns cares to move is carried
unanimously by Bentley, and vice versa.
D’Arc’s Marionettes, ffm. Whitburn and
Thos. Dawson are other contributors to a
programme which, after this week, will not
contain the name of Alec Hurley, the melo-
dious navvy.

At Melbourne Royal, a Jew-nosed com-
missioner named Sanballat, continues to
taunt the haughty Romans into laying 6 to 1
against Ben Hur for the Metropolitan
Chariot Stakes, and the wrath of those rash
speculators when they find they might have
invested their talents _ at evens burns as
fiercely as ever. Seemingly, they will never
get used to being taken down by Sanballat.
If they had the least commercial instinct,
they would go and reduce their liabilities by
backing Ben at the longest procurable odds
with some of the other Romans, but all they
think about is their indignation, when they
ought to be trying to make the best of a
horribly bad bet. Which goes to explain
why their Empire declined and fell.
One week more of “The Quaker Girl” will

esty’s (Melbourne), and already the advt. is
inviting the pretty maidens of forthcoming
“Florodora” to mention whether there are
any more at home like them.

Last Saturday the P’ran Lyric (Yic.) put
up “The Binding Link,” a large and sloppy
narration with heaps of kid element to give
it discursiveness. In the film a baby takes
on the job of reconciling its parents who
have been parted over her papa’s inability
to discontinue his pasts. A good picture
was “The Bank President’s Son,” which,
however, had a habit of stopping abruptly
and bisecting a long and shivery kiss. “On
El Monte Ranch” gave the usual U.S. story,
made up of cattle-duffing, poker-play, love
and coarse language. And a fairly bright
fiction was “A Romance of the Ice Fields,”
though a disenchanting factor was that the
hero was Dan, and not much romance can
be expected from a person called Dan.
It looks as though the same old influences
are going to defeat Melbourne’s struggle for
a decent traffic system, yet again. The posi-
tion is that ‘the Vic. Government has been
negotiating with the Tram Co. to buy it
out before the expiry of its lease in 1916, as
a preliminary to passing on the concern to
a municipal tramway trust which is to be
created this Parliamentary session. But the
City Council, being hostile to a Greater
Melbourne Council (a body which will be
elected on a one-ratepayer-one-vote basis) is
dead against the purchase, or any other pro-
position that will bring the dreaded, though
inevitable, change nearer. Also, the dozen
municipal councils into whose hands the
trams will fall in 1916 do not want to be
saddled with them until they have built
“wild cat” tramways to all points of the
compass. Their idea is to borrow money to
put down new trams, and let the old ones
go to blazes. But the Country Party which
has a big pull with the Government, goes
stark fanti every time the possibility of a
State loan for city improvement purposes is
mentioned in its hearing. The backblocks
are with the C.P. to a man in this respect,
and the bucolic feeling will herein be faith-
fully reflected by the votes of the country
members. It is also about 450 to one
(roughly speaking) that the “country influ-

ences” will prevent the Cabinet Pit-
ting through a Bill to authorise the electrifi-
cation of the suburban railways. In fact,
the chances are that nothing will be done,
and that Melbourne’s traffic system will con-
tinue to be Early Victorian, not to say Mid-
Elizabethan, as of yore; and that the only
beneficial outcome of the present movement
in the direction of improving matters will be
a further demonstration of the imbecility of
the Party Government system. Which will
be useful enough in its way, but not nearly
worth it at the price.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes :
Why throw scoffs at Albert Dorrington for his
yarn in the Contemporary Review about the horrors
of Australia? The Review presumably wanted good
reading matter. If Dorrington had described his
peaceful cottage and building allotment at Waitara
as an ordinary suburban spot on the railway line, a
few miles from Australia’s biggest city—a favorite
residence for business gentlemen-—a red-roofed suburb
with gas and fine pavements, and a good water
supply, and a tennis club, and golf links, and so on
—if he had done that sort of thing, would the editor
of the Contemporary Review have paid hyn a copper
for the information? Not much ! He..would as soon
have paid that enterprising Englishman, A. Dorring-
ton, for a truthful 10-page description of a window-
blind in Paddington or a flower-pot at Peckham Rye.
So the Contemporary Review man got the stuff he
wanted, written by a nameless eitv bushinan of the
worst omnibus description. The wild dogs at Waitara
are just as absurd as wolves at Battersea, but the
blessed editor never thought of looking up a map to
see the location of the place, nor did he consider the
obvious discrepancies of the narrative. The great
drawback about editors is the lack'of the journalistic
sense which induces the good pressman to rush at
the atlas, and make sure that the -Wild elephant story
that some humorist is trying to pass on him doesn’t
plant the impenetrable jungle in the middle of a great
city.-
AT POVERTY POINT.
The gallery crowd at the re-opening night of Mel-
bourne Royal looked strangely easy in mind and
body. They were sitting in comparatively open order,
in accordance with the new Board of Health regula-
tion, which insists on a reasonable breathing space
for each person. Nevertheless, there have been com-
plaints in the press that the Royal gallery had a
“packer” on the job, wljo compelled seven gods to
cram themselves within the spaces chalked off for
six immortals, and who stated that the Board of
Health boundaries didn’t count on first nights.
Which encourages the suspicion that prior to the
introduction of chalk lines the packer used to squeeze
not less than nine devout theatre-goers into the space
now dedicated to six. But the suspicion is beyond
proof. A number of girls who could have given valu-
able evidence, are said to be no more. There was
terrible mortality among Royal goddesses this last
winter, owing to tight-lacing it was thought. The
high death-rate is now believed to have been due to
tight packing.
Looking a gift horse in the mouth at Yorketown
(S.A.), a moving picture show gave a performance
for the benefit of the young men’s club. The propor-
tion of the receipts handed over was smaller than
was expected, and so, on a subsequent night, a crowd
gathered and pelted the manager with eggs. All this
is reminiscent of the fate of Ananias, “who kept
back part of the price,” getting no credit for the
sum he did give. In fact, he gave up part of the
money as a free gift, and was struck dead for the
balance.
Martin Harvey, who is booked for an Australian
tour, resembles the late Barry Sullivan in two ways.
He is idolised in the provinces, but a poor draw in
London. For years past he has been mainly identi-
fied with a character, which is eminently suited to
his style, viz., Sidney Carton, in “The Only Way,”
one of the many dramatisations of Dickens’ “Tale
of Two Cities.” No doubt it is in this role that he
will make his Australian debut.
“Kohu”: A number of fiercely idiotic and intern -
perately patient people formed a queue at midnight
in Auckland (Maoriland) to get a chance of seeing
the curtain rise on the Oscar Asche-Lily Brayton
performance of “Kismet.” People who do this sort
of thing probably deserve to do it, but present writer
wouldn’t wait 19 hours in a standing posture to see
the curtain rise on the Day of Judgment, even if the
piece were staged by William Shakspeare and had
special effects provided by Dante, John Milton, the-
Chapzander mission, Beelzebub and the ghost of
Elijah Dowie.
“Stargazer”: Two or three of the characters in
“On Our Selection” are particularly well done, and I
a,m inclined to think the truest bit of work is Sarah,
by Miss Laura Roberts. It is a
bright picture of a characteristic
bush girl, full of humor, and
without a trace of the exaggera-
tion with which several other
pros, get their effects. . There is
some excess of caricature in Ber-
tram’s Dave, but this,' too, is a
clever effort. The actor has been
assisted by Norm. Lindsay, whose
conception of David i$ faithfully
reproduced, yet Bertram spread.s
a sound bush type to great ad-
vantage by virtue of his own
abilities as a comedian. The chief
defect of “On Our Selection,” as
a picture of Australian manners
Outback, is the excess of eccen-
trics. All Steele Rudd’s curiosi-
ties of the bush are assembled
together, and the effect is too
suggestive of capers in a retreat
for the partially cracked.
Phil Rallis, the cheerful person who tumbles about
the Sydney Tivoli stage in order to make fun for the
folk in front, is said to have learned his business
with a gang of Arabs. The governor of the mob
of acrobatic undesirables was called Achmit Ibrahim,
and he was a distinctly difficult proposition. Rallis
was apprenticed to him at the age of eight years, and
saw not a piastre until he was 14, when he began to
get ss. a week. Four years later his screw rose to
10s. He left Achmit at last, and took to the variety
stage, where the gold and applause and other things
were better and more plentiful. During his Arab
slavery Rallis had all the important bones of his body
broken at one time or another. He tells hair-raising
tales of the way in which Achmit, who could tumble
like a dervish himself, treated the boys under his
control. Broken backs were not uncommon, and
those who won through the ordeal made rare per-
formers. Also, those who didn’t, made unusual
cripples. Rallis says there will be no more tumblers,
as English law forbids apprenticeship under the age
of 14, and no boy can learn after that age.
“Private Boxer”: Our old acquaintance, the
“actress-evangelist,” has once more turned up in
London, and to judge by the lady’s “card,” which
I have just come across on the front page of the
theatrical journal, The Stage, the fair Ada is intent
on carrying out her threat of returning to the boards.
Her advertisement runs:—
MISS ADA WARD,
Returned from Australian Tour. Great success
as Leah and Lady Isabel.
Quite in the language of the disengaged pro., you
observe. (By the way the mummeress, by some strange
oversight, has not printed her Australian press no-
tices!) The poor, unsophisticated theatrical man-
agers in England may be led to believe by the artless
Ada that she has been on a grand starring tour of
the playhouses in these parts, when, as a fact, the ex-
Salvationist only appeared in scenes from “East
Lynne” and “Leah” for one consecutive night. All
of which goes to prove that a converted actress can
never be converted from the base uses of advertise-
ment.
“Anglo-Saxon”: Why Nella Webb, the lady who
opened at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday, should call
herself a disease, passes all understanding. Anyhow,
why does a music-hall performer want to use a
manufactured French name at all? The Macarte
sisters pronounce their name McCarty, and are as
Irish as the shamrock itself. But disease. Nella
isn’t one. A diseuse is a talkeress, and the Webb
lady is a singeress. Why doesn’t she just say so in
any old language that may come handy ? If this
Frenchiness continues we shall have Huge Deal
Mclntosh spelling his name H. D. MakintQt or some-
thing.
“Harrison O.”: “Floater” alleges (B. 12/9/’l2)
that Gregan McMahon contemplates producing “Man
and Superman,” provided “he can find stage room
for Shaw’s Hell.” The Hell scene has invariably been
deleted from “Man,” etc., in London and elsewhere.
It is superfluous and boring. Shaw himself once
described it as an “attempt to write a new Book of
Genesis for the Bible of the Evolutionists,” and in
it he gives his, at times, intolerable prolixity free
rein. McMahon would be well advised to follow
precedent, and not attempt to present this dull and
unnecessary Sheol. Personally, I doubt if he ever
intended to do so.
“Ival”: A Bulletin writer pointed out recently
that the hero-crook of “Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford,”
though inexpressibly alluring to the matinee girl
type, would not go down for a second with business
men, however bucolic. Niblo’s youth, fluency, wide
hypnotic smile and gleaming teeth and clothes would,
as your correspondent remarked, inspire the utmost
distrust amongst the money-changers, etc., of real
life. The above is a reproach which cannot be
levelled at Randolph Bedford’s “The Unseen Eye,”
which is to be produced at Sydney Palace Theatre
at the end of next month. Roderick Speed, a' swind-
ling promoter and the central figure; is no' dazzling
lad, but the hard-headed, cynical, middle-aged man,
who is the real pirate of civilisation. George Bry-
ant will probably play the part. By the way, this
will be the first Australian city drama to find the
stage, here or elsewhere.
“Vulcan”: A large initial nail has just been
banged into the coffin of the conventional panto,
“principal boy”—who is a plump girl, mostly dis-
guised in a large hat and nothing much else. Drury
Lane (London), of all places, announces that this
year’s panto, “boy” will be Wilfred Douthitt —the
first male in the part within the history of the
Lane —and that the innovation will probably become
a habit of the future.

ART AND THE BEER-MONEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We do not desire to be antagonistic to any union
of actors duly formed, but we are quite at one on the
subject of the impossibility of laying down any
minimum wage in connection with Art. —The honor-
ary general secretary of the Ac-tors’ Association.
Long time the beauteous actor-bloke
Gave tongue among the beer —he spoke
On Art, and artists’ recompense,
And thence,
He came eftsoons to speak on his
Relations to the acting-biz.
Shaking his high-browed, lovely head,
“I toil for Art’s sweet sake,” he said.
“I toil for her, my mistress dear,”
He burbled, in between his beer,
And, while his eyes with rapture shone,
Went on,
To speak on Art and what it means.
Apart from boodle, gonce or beans.
To one whose Art is It. “To me
My Art is everything,” said he.
In earnest tones, serenely glad,
He told of triumphs he had had
In days gone by, and mentioned how,
Right now,
As something big the boss had billed
His nibs. His soul was plainly filled
With splendid scorn of those who could
Ask oof for simply making good.
Yet, when more beer came on the board,
And Horace fumbled for his hoard,
No sound was heard of clashing splosh.
“Be gosh!”
He groaned—and as he fumbled so
He glumly murmured, soft and low,
In hurried tones, bereft of joy:
“Oh, you pay for this beer, ol’ boy!”

HOWLS AT THE GATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Captain H. L. A. Frankford (Legion of Frontiers-
men) wrote: “I suggest that after the resolution has
been put and carried, the whole of the meeting ad-
journ to Government House, and sing ‘God Save the
King.’ This will, to my mind, give the disloyalists
some discernment, that they can .go so far and no
farther. I feel a demonstration of this kind to be
absolutely necessary.” —Fearful outburst induced by
fuss over G.-G. Denman’s “eviction” from Sydney
Government House.
The viceroy gnawed alone,
One dark and wintry night,
His larder’s final bone.
There were no more in sight.
The seaside castle rent
Had not been paid, and so
Some knaves of ill intent
Ha‘d told him he must go.
The ragged A.D.C.’s,
Before the few poor logs,
Sprawled round about his knees
Like old and faithful dogs. ,
Their master hoped for aid
From loyal folk and stout;
But he was sore afraid
There was no help about.
His heart was full of fear.
What loyalist could help?
An aide put Up one ear
And gave a nervous yelp.
“Lie down!” the.master kind
In gentle tones remarked,
For he was quite resigned.
The aide rose up and barked!
That roused the other aides ;
The pack call sounded clear,
As when, through social glades,
They chased the fatted deer.
He thrashed them with his hat
Until their clamor ceased;
When they were crouching flat,
The door-latch he released.
Beyond the gateway light,
He heard the hungry growl
Of some beasts of the night,
Then one horrific Howl!
He gave one startled bound
And madly rushed within;
, His cowed aides gathered round
And trembled at the din.
Behind the bars they kept
A vigil fierce and strict;
And if the viceroy slept,
His hands the good aides licked.
They did no recognise 1

That grand old institution, the stomach,

A significant sentence in the report of the Young People's Union stated that compulsory training had

fashioned way. The man, seemingly, is so
intent on his diabolical experiments that he
cannot see he is trying to do away with
what is at once a reason for living and a re-
ligion. Abolish the stomach, and myriads
of people would not know what to do with
themselves. Oratory would die out if human
innards ceased to be taken to banquets and
heavyweight functions; waiters, sailors,
farmers, vignerons, and others representing
Agriculture and Industry would go insol-
vent or mad, or both ; and the neglected part
of the human machine, the old-established
furnace, would develop some new and dan-
gerous complaint like appendicitis the
trouble that attacks the little blind, disused
alley that nobody knows the use of. Even
the greediest absorber of shocks would not
be able to develop a prosperous paunch on
electricity, and the sun would rise and set
on a race of servile flat men—wretched
beings with no splendid front curves. The
proud, confident fat man —the unshaken man
of resistless bulk —the man who is fit and
ready to shove against the world —would
nevermore be seen. A certain type of fighter
—the bar*room gladiator who holds his an-
tagonist with a baleful eye until he gets
near enough to shoot out his balloon vest
with the force of a battering ram, and fire
him through the swing doors —would become
merely a wonderful legend of retired arch-
drunks of the past age of beer. The absurdly
fat actor, who makes a splendid living by
singing and joking about his stomach, would
also vanish, and all the fat humor would
lose its meaning. The world will not stand
any scientific interference with its stomach

“Lex” holds forth :
The proposed re-admission of R. D. Meagher to
practise as a solicitor of the Ma State has demons-
trated, amongst other things, the tremendous capacity
of the local press, also “Pro Bono, etc.,” “Father
of Twelve” and other thoroughly British institutions,
to be stampeded, on the frailest grounds, into an out-
burst of snuffle and self-righteous cant. What is it
Meagher asks? The right simply to do that which
the Supreme Court of N. S. Wales explicitly promised
he should be allowed to do years ago, and which
a Chief Justice and divers other good Judges have
repeatedly agreed he should be permitted to do.
To hear and read the views of the rival solicitors
and their anonymous henchmen who are filling the
State with excitement re Meagher, one would
think that he was applying for a bishopric, or a cure
of souls, or something. The notorious truth is that
if Meagher had committed all the misdeeds he is
accused of, in addition to those which have been
officially scored up against him, he would still be
entirely worthy to associate with quite a number
of Sydney Gentlemen One. With nauseating self-
sufficiency they have been using the Meagher case for
years and years as a peg whereon to hang masses of
praise anent the “honor” and “high-mindedness” and
so forth of their branch of the profession. Speaking
from harsh experience I can state that there are at-
torneys on the roll of local solicitors, at the time of
writing, who would stand to be “pilled” at a Black-
mailer’s Club (if such there be) as over the odds in
the way of villainy, and whose robberies, swindles
and other delicts would fill volumes of small print.
For reasons which are perfectly well known to
those in the inner running, Meagher has always been
relentlessly pursued by the Law Institute. Folks
who are his enemies, not on public but on purely
private grounds, use this body as a lever.
The State has nothing to gain, and everything to
lose by making a man an outcast for all time; and
the abler and more forceful the man, the more dan-
gerous it is to render him desperate. An amazing
judicial decision laid it down, the other day, that
any scurrilous person, who felt so disposed, was at
liberty to roam about the country, publicly denounc-
ing Meagher as a “criminal,” or worse. ”It practi-
cally leaves him no redress against malicious persons,
sensation-mongers, blackmailers and the like, save
the revolver and shot-gun which provide the answer
to such remarks in those parts of the world where
Law and Order amount to so many dead letters. In
fact, the decision is absurd and indefensible. Equally
so is the proposition that this man, who erred about
20 years ago, should never again be suffered to
practise his profession. It amounts to the putting
of a premium on all those evil courses which the
community spends thousands annually trying to
cheek.
HER LIKENESS.
THAT BOY (with one of auntie s studies): “Is
this like you, auntie? ”
About a week after it advertised a vacant
infant for adoption, or something of the
kind, under the heading, “Dogs, Poultry,
etc.,” the S. M. Herald burst into tears in
its leading columns over the iniquity of a
shameless Government which had offered Jfo
towards the usual expenses to the lady who
had just acquired a baby in the usual way.
In its advertising columns, the Herald
usually refers to the young of man as an
“encumbrance.” How familiar to the Her-
ald reader is the advertisement, “Married
couple wanted for station. No encum-
brance”! And then the Personal column:
“Earl Blither, who is paying a visit to Aus-
tralia, arrived here yesterday by the R.M.S.
Dashit. He is accompanied by Viscount
Vacant, his eldest male encumbrance.” But,
no! On second thoughts, that news item has
yet to be published. Blither’s expensive
heir is often an encumbrance of the most
tiresome variety; but, somehow, the honest
fact always escapes mention. The need-
lessly unhappy Herald, with its one ser-
viceable eye firmly fixed on the bassinette
containing Mrs. Bellevue Toorak’s most re-
cent treasure, shed absolute pints of brine
on behalf of the shocked mother whose dig-
nity and tenderest feelings the Government
proposes to wound with its well-meant fiver.
Vague and dreary references were made to
such things as “the sacred mystery of birth”
—the intensely commonplace mystery which
has to be paid for in poor households with
unforgettable anxiety and hard unmysterious
cash, and which results, if all goes well,
in the production of a healthy little Austra-
lian—the White Man’s Burden that handi-
caps the working parents so damnably in
the eyes of some Herald advertisers. The
whole tenor of the wealthy old sheet’s out-
burst was that the dreadful subject should not
have been mentioned at all, and that to talk
of a money reward in connection with such r
thing as birth was just shameful. One way
and another, the Herald is a diverting old
wet. blanket. One can almost imagine it
reading its Bible in the twilight and saying
tenderly: “What a loving and beautiful
command that is! ‘Suffer little encum-
brances to come unto Me.’ ” And, again,
“Like as a Father pitieth his encum-
brances,” etc.
* * * *
“F.C.”: What, you ask me helplessly, is
the cause of “the waning influence of the
Church”? Wherefore, you clamor, are the
parsons and the bishops, and their fair mil-
linery and picturesque practices being en-
thusiastically turned down by the masses?
Well, one reason seems to me to be con-
nected with the Church’s snarling intoler-
ance and Chronic petty-mindedness and lack
of anything approximating to a sense of pro-
portion. To cite an instance, at the forth-
coming Melbourne Anglican Sydnod, Dr.
Deeper, one of the leaders of the denomina-
tion, proposes to move that the Synod “con-
demn the too prevalent practice of applying
the word ‘catholic’ exclusively to members
n i the Homan Catholic denomination, etc.,
etc.” A worthy issue for presumably edu-
cated men to waste time over, forsooth,
when such questions as housing of the Door,
pure food, control and treatment of infec-
tious and contagious diseases, and so forth,
are fairly yelling for attention.
Down at St. Kllda
Melb.), the other day,
the recipient of an il-
luminated address ac-
cepted it with all the
disrespect due to that
silly old form of com-
pliment. With his
hard, rough speech of
thanks he rubbed the
gilt off the gaudy
thinsr. He was an ex-
councillor, recently
rejected by the local
ratepayers, and the
mayor presented him
with the morocco-
hound vanity as a
sort of consolation
prize from his former
colleagues. The re-
marks of the frank
and hearty addressee
deserved all the illum-
ination a paragraph
can give them. He
said he had always de-
precated the wasting
of money on worthless
testimonials, but he
wasn’t going to refuse
to be lumbered with
this superfluous sou-
venir. He would take
it home and hide it
away with a lot of
other similar contriv-
ances for pulling his
leg that had happened
to him in the past. And this was an ex-
municipal dignitary! When a town coun-
cillor holds up the illuminated address
custom to honest ridicule, it seems about time
for a host of ex-presidents, secretaries and
managers of clubs, lodges, or business con-
cerns, to take their framed treasures from the
parlor wall and place them in the woodshed
to die of natural decay.
A gruesomely humorous mental picture
can be drawn from the cable reports of the
wrecking of the Chester-Liverpool (Eng-
land) express train at Ditton Junction: —
Immediately after the disaster the wood-work of
the carriages caught fire. Crowds of would-be res-
cuers stood helplessly by, owing to the fierce heat,
while imprisoned passengers screamed with agony
as they were slowly roasted to death. A clergyman,
who was summoned from Ditton Junction, gave con-
solation to the dying, who were imprisoned in the
wreckage, and could not be released.

One would suppose that the “Precentor
of Norwich Cathedral,” England, is a very
solemn, staid and dignified old boy. But even
a man who has to intone psalms, sing an-
thems, and keep a frivolously-disposed choir
within the bounds of order and decency
must indulge himself in a few giddy moments
from time to time. This particular precen-
tor has just written and composed a song for
the Boy Scouts. Here is one specimen
verse:—
We are the boys who without any noise
Have to help the old world on its road.
There’s no need to look blue if a scout is in view,
He is certain to lighten the load.
We are made of the stuff that is quite up to snuff,
Though we don’t care to brag of our skill ;
If you don’t think we’re worth a small place on the
earth, - /
Then we hope that you jolly soon will.

“Tamuinu”: I recently encountered a man
who had been enjoying or enduring a 12
months seclusion cure on Rotoroa, the island
in the Bauraki Gulf (M.L.), owned by the
Salv’army, and utilised as a “Home” for the
reformatory treatment of confirmed alco-
holics. When an inebriate has broken his
prohibition order four or five times within the
year, the S.M. commits him to Rotoroa for
a period of one or two years. Two years is
the maximum, and, according to my acquaint-
ance, it is about a year and nine months too
long. Most of the cases sent to the island
are physical wrecks at the date of landing;
but within three months, what with regular
hours, fresh air and total abstinence, the
worst soaker has regained his health so far
as he is eyer likely to do. He is as fit as he
ever will be to earn a crust and a bob or two
towards the price of his coffin. But for the
next nine months, or year and nine months,
as the case may be, he has to toil gratis at
scrub-whacking, road-making, fishing; in
fact, any sort of old job the Salv’army official
in charge puts him on. Whether he works
willingly or not, whether he makes a good or
bad job of his task, or whether he does any
blamed thing at all, the remuneration he re-
ceives never varies. The results of his labor
merely go to increase the value of the Army’s
property. The joke is that, during the whole
period of his stay on the island, the Govern-
ment is paying the Salv’army authorities 10s.
a week for his keep ! My ex-patient im-
pressed on me that the last nine months he
spent on Rotoroa were unadulterated Hades.
He had just one thing to look forward to —
the day of his release. When the sup-
posedly cured inebriate is discharged, he is
dumped on the Auckland wharf, with a Gov-
ernment gratuity, in the shape of a fl note
in his pocket, and freedom to do what he
likes with it. In many cases, night finds him
once more in the cells, sleeping off the
effects of his purchases, Awaiting returned
patients from Rotoroa, and leading them
to inebriate Elysiums, was at one time
quite a promising industry with the beer-
chewers of Auckland. This fact coming to
Magistrate Kettle’s ears, he announced from
the bench that anyone found tempting the
cured alcoholic would be presented with 12
months imprisonment. Since then the in-
dustry has wilted away, and returned Roto-
roans have to find their own way to the
Demon.

The stern parent who bellows so impres-
sively on the stage rarely appears in real
life; and when he does he isn’t a bit im-
pressive. During the hearing of a case at
Prahran (Vic.), last week, a father of the
stern, old-fashioned type (by some evil
chance he was being sued for maintenance
by his wife) told of the heroic efforts he
had made to make his son behave like a
gentleman. “He had flogged him black and
blue, and on several occasions knocked him
down and kicked him, but all to no pur-
pose.” One here pictures the splendid old
aristocrat throwing down his cudgel in de-
spair, and retiring to his study to take off
his boots and die slowly of heartbreak with
his bruised feet in a bucket of hot water.
DIDN'T WANT TO MISS THE CHANCE.
HE: “I'm sick of this extravagance. If it
wasn't for the children I’d leave you.

This is a plea, before I go too mad, for the aboli-

is the Arts course, and I defy any practical-minded
investigator to tear half a pound of usable informa-
tion from the whole dreary waste of it. Sometimes
it loses itself in the murky past in search of fossilised
nonentities. At others it debates closely whether A
is A, and whether B would be damned if it was
found drinking with Z. Anon, it requires one to

tackle the muddled Anglo-Saxon declensions of the
rude forefathers of the hamlet. And none of these
practices promise me the least fragment of direct
benefit. Next year, if I survive, the Latin-man is to
get me. He has got himself into a state where he
would be safer drunk on the Seven Hills of Rome
than sober on a modern sidewalk, and a false quan-
tity jars him more than a split infinitive does a
third-rate sub-editor.
Now, I may get past the lot. Indeed, I hope to.
But that is not the question. What I want to know
is: Shall I ever be able to forget the awful stuff
which is soaking into me, or does it all amount, as
a gloomy intimate avers, to committing intellectual
hari-kari ? Time will show, but the future is not
auspicious. Meanwhile, for the sake of a generation
yet unborn, I adumbrate a couple of reforms, viz.: —-
(1) Professors of the standard type to be segre-
gated from the normal community, and fed up with
material from their pet study. All escapees to be
hanged.
(2) Professional schools to be established in place
of Universities. These to really inculcate a live
knowledge of and capacity for his future job, on the
part of the student, and to avoid anv sort of allusion
to what was baked on the bricks of Babylon.
At present there is mostly only one sort of profes-
sional school, and nearly all who tackle the higher
education go to it. At it, the professors bring on a
few, who are able to stand it, and turn them also into
Professors. The many take up dog-fighting, or cro-
quet, or Christian Endeavor, or smoking niggerhead.
They stomach the Prof, half a year, and get it all
back on capping day. Meantime, the Commonwealth
searches in vain for its necessary complement of
statesmen, editors, pedagogues, captains of enter-
prise, and divines. All it gets is a selection of glum-
looking youths, with their mental machinery held
up by the barb-.wire entanglements of the Dead
tongues.

“Life Buoy” indicates a danger spot:—
Apropos the Royal Commission now sitting in
Melbourne (Vic.) on the bay steamers and their life-
saving equipment. Allow me to suggest the appoint-
ment of a similar body to consider the position of
the ocean-going excursion steamers that run from
Sydney to Cowan, Hawkesbury and Cronulla. The
Port Phillip’s Bay boats frequent practically smooth
water, and mostly there is a handy mudbank avail-
able in the event of desperate measures being called
for. The Sydney excursion vessels which specialise
in ocean trips hardly ever encounter calm seas, and
the only refuges open to them are a rocky lee shore
or a surf-pounded beach. They are allowed by the
Marine Act to take 1000 passengers. Nothing in the
way of extra boat accommodation is attempted, the
Law pinioning its faith to bulkheads and lifebelts—
the former being for the steamer, the latter for the
men, women and kids. But bitter experience goes
to show that these are but busted reeds to float upon
when, the gaunt hand of Death reaches up out of the
main and starts dragging down victims. After the
Titanic horror, the Government which allows a
steamer to go to sea with 1000 people on board and
boats for 300 takes a hideous risk of gaining sudden
unpopularity, the sort of unpopularity that keeps it in
opposition for decades.
“N. or M,.” who is The Bulletin’s
office whaler, sends an item: —
Either suicide is becoming fashionable among
whales, or the ambulatory oil_ reservoirs are consider-
ably more numerous than they were. The pivot of
these remarks is a young cachelot that has blundered
ashore on a Tasmanian beach, near my humpy, and
is at present forming a centre of attraction. (“Poor
little thing,” the women say, as they look at the
18ft. infant.) A practical humanitarian has taken
an axe and put an end to the dying brute’s struggles.
Ever seen a whale killed? It is a more gory affair
than a popular
melodrama or Nor-
wegian saga, and
“doth all the mul-
titudinous seas in-
carnadine, making
the green one red.”
These cataceans are
built on an ama-
teurish pattern,
and outside infor-
mation must have
a difficulty about
soaking in. The
ears are mere pin-
holes, and the
eyes, which are
little slits near the
corners of the
mouth, are so set
that the owners
can only see
straight in front
of them — hence
frequent disasters.
According to an
old statute, still
in working order,
the head of sue h
sea-sendings belongs
to the King and
the tail to the
Queen —the Prince
of Wales isn’t in
it. Old whalers
say that there are
now p 1 e n tly o f
whales in Austra-
lian waters to turn
the industry back
to the roaring days
of its prosperity, if
conditions were tho
same; but, whilst
wages and the, cost
of outfit have gone
up, the intrOdwc-
ti on of vegetable
and mineral oils
has caused a slump
in prices, and
sperm oil, which at
one time sold o n
the Hobart wharves
as high as £110 a
ton, is now down
to about £30. The
“right” whale —
the fellow that
carries the whale-
bone —is the aris-
tocrat of his kind, as the sick ambergris factory is
the millionaire. Australian whalers did not drop
to the value of the smellful commodity as soon as did
the Americans, and many a fortune must have
floated to the sharks for want of a little knowledge.
The sensational haul at Recherche, that glutted the
ambergris market, and made the fortunes of two
fishermen, is still talked of, though it happened about
25 years ago. McGregor’s old Derwent Hunter had
taken a whale, and towed it in shore for trying-out.
Having hastily stripped the blubber, it left for fresh
fields and cataceans new, passing the bones and
wreckage over to a fisherman known as “Black”
Harry, and a negro named Louis. The last of the
oil having been extracted, the negro crawled inside
the defunct, on an exploring expedition, and brought
out something that he thought might be ambergris.
It was! and the partners were offered £12,000 for
it on the spot. They refused. The Com-
mercial Bank took charge of the stuff for
them, and —in view of the fact that lOoz.
will supply a large scent factory for a year—
sold it out by degrees, realising a sum of £24,000
or £25,000. A thousand more or less doesn’t matter
much: when it comes to a lump of ambergris the size
of a bag of wheat. Ambergris, I believe, is reallv
the pain the killer whale gets in its stomach through
eating too many octopuses, the indigestible beak of
«ie fish accumulating in the larsre animal’s innards.
I give this item for what it isn’t worth.

Onehunga, the little Maoriland port with
the Zoo, which lives on the proceeds of
handling any chance goods which may have
the luck to get over Manukau bar, is the
latest place to cover itself with the blushing
shame of owning a Carnegie library. Maori-
land has now a lot of these memorials to the
man who posted guns in his own black city
of Pittsburg to shoot down the strikers who
clamored for somewhat less indecent condi-
tions than those which enabled Andrew to
gather in dollars by the ton. It is a pretty
bad business to accept foreign doles of this
kind from any source. Onehunga ought to
be quite capable of building its own library
as well as maintaining it, as it must do in
any case. The rate which the astute An-
drew insists on having struck to maintain
his keg of books after he has built it is, in
nine cases out of ten, sufficient to supply
the whole lock, stock and barrel of an insti-
tution for a town twice the size. In addi-
tion to the loss of respect which the Car-
negie transaction involves, and the contempt
which it earns from all decent citizens, the
whole affair is downright bad finance. Thus
a town which really requires a £IOOO library
costing £3OO a year to maintain, cadges
£4OOO for its building, and pledges itself to
go on raising till the Day of Judgment a
yearly sum for the upkeep which is out of
all proportion to the needs of the place. In
fact, it sacrifices its self-respect for the sake
of a white elephant.

Melbourne’s dreadfully incompetent Har-
bor Trust, which Bent threatened to wipe
out and Watt promises to abolish or reform,
has left that port so ill-provided with, berth-
ing accommodation that recently two loads
of immigrants had to lie out in the bay till
there was room for them at crowded piers
or docks. On September 14 the Gothic, with
752 settlers, found an odd corner unoccupied
in the West Melbourne dock. On Septem-
ber 16 the Norseman and the Medic wan-
dered in. One had to wait for the Gothic
to clear out, the other for a mail steamer to
leave Port Melbourne pier, on the outward
track. It doesn’t speak well for Melbourne,
but perhaps the Trust is wise. The big
steamers that are coming will pass by Mel-
bourne’s shallow inlet, even though the
Trust dredges a channel from the Heads to
Spencer-street ferry, and it isn’t any use
building wharves for steamers that will
unanimously ignore their existence.

THE NOISE OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let us take a ramble through the paddocks now,
when the young grass is so lusty that the surging
of the sap can almost be heard.
—Melbourne Herald’s tame spring paragraphisl.
I love the merry noise of Spring;
It makes me rear right up and sing
And dance about like anything!
Yea, I adore its cheerful sound ;
It laps my senses all around.
The plants are springing from the ground.
(They hiss like rockets as they jump)
And bombs’ of grass, in many a clump,
Come bursting upwards with a bump.
Virginian creepers shout and bawl;
And far abaft the echoing wall
0 hark! the sweet potatoes call!
But stay! across these hollow thuds
This thunder of the bursting buds,
These plaintive wailings from the spuds,
What novel note ? Ah, winsome souls!
Like some strange brand of burrowing moles
Spring bards come crawling from their holes,
While, sweeter than the cooing dove,
With many a pert coquettish shove
We hear the insects making love!
My cup of joy o’erflows the brim.
Oh, in the woods all weird and dim
To wander hand-in-hand with him ! —
AVith him, with him, where we two list,
’Mid Spring’s lush riot, roar and mist—-
Me, and the Herald Botanist. !

WHEN THE CAT’S AWAY.
The Man on the 1ST F LOOR: “Look out!
Here's the boss.”
“A. Nehoc” : “Reka’s” par. (B. 22/8/T2)
about the octopus, makes me wonder what his special
brand is, or what he has been having lately to eat.
The beak of the octopus, which is much the same as
that of a parrot, but does not protrude in the same
way, is placed exactly in the centre of the nucleus
of the tentacles, and is always underneath when the
animal climbs out of the water for a terrestrial
crawl. Perhaps “Rika’s” animal was standing on its
head for a wager, or overcome with surprise at meet-
ing a real aboriginality in the flesh. The beast’s
eyes are small compared with those of most marine
things, and very much resemble the headlights or
cow-catcher of a flatliead. I never saw the eight-
armed curse looking heartbroken, but some state-
ments made by bushmen from Waverley, and by
pirates and bushrangers holding Government clerk-
ships, would break the heart of an oyster.
“Pete”: Just liow far back cannibalism,
as a regular thing, ceased to exist amongst the Maoris
is not quite certain. There was a revival of it during
the savage days of the Hau-Plau war in Taranaki ;
but it is thought that the Taranaki consumption of
“long pig” was more an act of defiance than any-
thing else. However, those who are in a position to
speak with authority, declare that the Maoris ate the
flesh of their conquered enemies far more recently
than is generally thought. This idea is borne out,
to some extent, by an incident that cropped up at a
meeting of the Taranaki Native Land Court about
two years ago. A young Maori put in a claim for a
piece of land, saying that it was his because his
father had been the last man to own it, and was
buried there. The Court ascertained that the young
man was right with regard to the last occupancy of
the section, and decided to give him the benefit of
the doubt as far as the resting-place of his father’s
bones was concerned. A certificate of title was
about to be issued, when a voice at the back of the
court-room cried “Taihoa!” (wait a bit), and an old
tattooed warrior pushed his way forward. Smiting
the table with his fist, he shouted to the astonished
Court: “When this young man says his father’s grave
is on the piece of ground he desires, he does not
speak truth! Hear it, then, from me! Here”
(smiting his breast) “is the grave of his father!
He was my enemy, and I slew him in battle, and
ate him. The land is mine by right of conquest, and
must be given me!” Of course the Court was hor-
rified, and told the old warrior what it thought of
him. But the piece of land still remains State
property.
“Kodak”: When, the masked burglar scare
was on, I felt strongly inclined to break the rule of
a lifetime and buy a dog. People who said they
knew all about it told me there was nothing better
as a burglar alarm than a small dog. All you had
to do at night was to lock the small dog in, give it
the run of the house and go to bed. The trouble
was that I could not bring to share a house
with a dog. One of us would have had to take to
the kennel; and, as I hated the idea of a burglar
slaying me with poisoned meat while the dog was in
bed, I decided to do without the animal, and keep
the house for myself. lam glad I did so, because
the reliability of the canine burglar alarm seems
open to. doubt. There are hosts of dog-proprietors
living round my district, and, if their animals can
be believed, the whole place is simply crawling with
burglars every night. Of course, the yelping brutes
are merely holding long-distance conversations,
throwing out challenges and indulging in dreary
hysterical soliloquies. The average house-dog seems
to be a fearfully nervy beast. His low-grade brain
is filled with vague, nightmarish recollections of his
old forest days, and the minute the sun goes down,
or he is left alone, he sees and smells ghosts, and
howls his fears from the basement of his contempt-
ible, flea-bitten stomach. There is a particularly
desolate brand of beast, which is much affected by
people who go out a lot, and think their house is
quite safe so long as he is there. That dog’s de-
serted yell is simply an advertisement for burglars.
Sooner than be startled and maddened by having an
obscene false-alarmist running over my house, I’d
just submit to be robbed. In these days of masked
combines, there is nothing particularly objectionable
about a straight-out, occasional brigand.
* * # *
“Wal” : The remarks on the tide gymnas-
tics of Torres Strait, by “F.A.T.” (B. 20/6/’l2),
bring to my mind the antics played around the China
Strait, near Samarai, Papua. The eastern end of
New Guinea juts out into a myriad of islands, big
and small, and through the resulting innumerable
passages and channels the tide runs at the rate of
a baby hurricane. Was aboard a steamer once which
tried for three hours to enter a passage near Sam-
arai, known as Rocky Pass, but although the vessel
could steam 10 knots in a heavy sea, it was not able
to push its way in. I have seen vessels lying along-
side the Samarai wharf break every line and swing
out into the stream when the tide has been a little
faster than ordinary; and if the worried master had
not known the place well he might not have had his
anchor down to hang on to when the lines went. A
funny trick played one day was the spectacle of a
small launch being hurried down the passage towards
ICwato Island by a punt that the launch had taken in
tow —a sort of case of the tower being the towed.
When the tide has been at its full strength I have
seen bottles do the measured mile in a little under
seven minutes, which would show a rate of about
nine miles an hour. With a tide of this velocity, the
place is far from pleasant to navigate, and many and
strange have been the pranks that vessels have per-
formed when coming into port. In one passage the
current would be dead ahead, but, as soon as the
skipper entered the harbor the tide would be with
him, and then one would see a scared sailorman doing-
fancy steering to keep clear of the other boats, his
efforts being accompanied by much “langwidge” from
the crews of the anchored craft. Crossing the strait to
the mainland, I have seen as many as four different
currents, the first going south, the second north, the
third almost slack water, and the fourth and last
dashing madly to the south. The resulting “rips” are
sometimes startling propositions. Several boats have
been turned clean over by them, and several lives
have gone into them that never came back to pay
for their drinks. The worst tides are at full moon
and first quarter. One man who tried to study the
currents and make a tide-table is now in the lunatic
asylum. And the tides still chase each other round
the strait.
“Wonga” : Forest restoration is a small
kind of thing in the Ma State, but if the average
cocky had his way there wouldn’t be enough of it
left to find with a powerful microscope. During the
recent drought, a timber reserve up Dubbo way ear-
lied some coarse feed, and surrounding cockies who
had been too lazy or careless to save, a bit of feed on
their own places, let alone grow some as a standby,
cast an eye of envy over the fence. Applications
were made to put stock on the reserve, and, when
these were refused, there was a wail like that of a
stricken city bumped by the horror of Asia. Every
cocky put in several solid days of hard graft cursing
the authorities who had no bowels of compassion for
his hungry stock. But the reserve in question con-
tained young trees which the sheep would have eaten
out in 24 hours, and the loss of the future forest
growth was an infinitely more important matter than
TUSTIFICATION.
MAGISTRATE: "What made this brute strike you?"
WIFE: “Well, yer see, your Worship, I refused-him money for a drink, and he found
out I'd Ave threepence to a mission in China."
the loss of stock. The cocky has caused the sacrifice
of millions of acres of good timber in all parts of
the country, and now, when timber is getting scarce,
and the Department labors to save a few posts and
rails for Mr. Cowbumper’s grandchildren, he does
his level best to cripple its efforts. Truly, the man
on the soil is often a pretty ghastly proposition.
A MATTER FOR REJOICING.
SALVATION ARMY CONVERT: “To prove,
brothers and sisters, that I'm thoroughly
saved, you've only to look at the police
records. I've served seven years for
bigamy, five for assault, 18 for burglary,
10 for cattle stealing, six for forgery, and
I should have been hanged twice."
UNANIMOUS: “Praise the Lord!"
“Te Ruruku” : The Maori Tohunga—priest,
medicine-man, wizard, what you will—is really a
capable person, with all the instincts of a Beef Trust
or a grey nurse shark. The Maoriland Government
grants the old age pension to the ancients of the
hapu, but, in spite of many safeguards, the old
people get very little of it. The Tohunga’s way of
going to work is simplicity itself. He merely lies
in ambush by the post-office where the pensions are
paid, and frightens the cash out of his victims by
displaying his occult knowledge. “Friend Hoani,
look at the sky. Do you not see a cloud shaped like
a coffin? No? Well, I do, and I also see a man in
it very much like you.” Tremblingly the pension is
handed over to buy off the evil spirits. One Tohunga
got six months lately for such practices, and it would
be good business for the aged Maori generally if all
Tohungas could be given 60 years.
“Vagabond” : I want to know if any sort
of soup, stew, sea-pie or other dish can be made
from the river or mud turtles that crawl round the
banks and braes of the Murrumbidgee. When we
first ran across a covey of these shelly reptiles with
the delirium tremens countenances, vague memories
of aldermanic feasts of turtle soup and calipash and
calipee and turtle steaks floated across our minds,
and we carefully stalked a bunch and made prison -
ers of them. They didn’t look
anything inviting as the basis of
a Sunday dinner, but we dumped
them in our boat and pondered
over their possibilities in the
edible line for a day and a night.
By that time we had firmly estab-
lished the fact that turtles have
well —an odor, and this removed
them another long step from the
soup tureen. Finally it came to
the point of whether we should
leave the boat or the turtles
should, and the turtles lost—or
p’raps they’d say won, as we gave
them our blessing and a boost
back to their native smellement.
But there are plenty more here,
and if anyone tells us they can
be turned into a savory dish and
how, we’ll round up another herd
and experiment. Also, how do
you kill the deathless and im-
mortal turtle. (The person who
replies under this heading might
also explain how you kill devils.)
The infrequent inhabitants along
the river can’t help us, and firmly
turn up their noses at the notion of turtle figuring
on the bill of fare.
“Y.A.”: Re “Pick’s” yarn (22/<S/’l2), a
Jimmy Grant took a ringbarking contract in this
neighborhood the other day. A line of 27 telegraph
poles ran through the paddock. Stap me if he didn’t
ringbark every one of them. At latest advices the
authorities were debating whether they would send
him to join Chidley or proceed against him for
wilfully and malignantly damaging the property of

“Gouger”: Re that slow curse with the
quick fore-and-aft action, the death-adder. I re-
member, about two years ago, when I was prospect-
ing in the Stanthorpe district (S. Q’land), our party
of four had an experience. We had left our kapok
mattress behind at the last pub, and as a substitute
had to spread a big tarpaulin on the ground. In the
morning we found that our joint weight had rolled
a death-adder as flat as a blotting-pad. On another
occasion a mate of mine managed to roll up one of
the reptiles in his swag. He had left the blue
arrangement unstrapped for a few minutes in the
morning, and the poison-injector had crawled in.
Three days afterwards the swag was unrolled for the
first time—the hospitality of the pubs on the road
had rendered this unnecessary before—and the creep-
ing death came to view. I have seen only one man
bitten by a death-adder, and we saved his life by ap-
plying drastic remedies in record time. The bite
was a little below the ankle, and while one of us
held the victim down and sat on him, another got
a thick cord, and, with the assistance of a rifle-
cleaner, twitched it tightly above and below the
wound. Then we cut the bitten part out and
jammed gunpowder into the hole. When we put a
match to it and fired the mine the patient gasped ;
when we repeated the performance he howled ; but
after feeling bad for a day or two he was as right as
ever.

of the Lemon River Valley, a couple of weeks ago,
I came across what I believe to be Binghi’s Royal
Academy, or something of the kind. It is an escarp-
ment of ferruginous sandstone ridge,
which once formed the eastern bank
of the river, and through which chan-
nels were cut at right-angles by the
waters of the ages. The Lemon River
may not be as ' --ell known to Aus-
tralians as the names or the Seine;
wherefore, I pause to observe that it
flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria,
about midway between the Roper and
the Marathon rivers. All three are
larger than the foreign gadder-haunted
streams, and could be made quite as
navigable for ships of moderate
draught at a comparatively trifling
expense. (I expect that the Japs will
attend to this when they foreclose on
the continent.) The facade presented
a glittering display of natural history
studies in the impressionist style.
Section B, on the right side of main
entrance, showed a trial stakes open
to all-comers. The ’roo, gohanna and
bandicoot were well ahead of the field,
and going strong. The native com-
panion and whistling duck almost
flew off at my approach; and the
gohanna and bandicoot looked round
for holes to dive into. But the trum-
peter goose was the pride of the col-
lection. I guess the coal-black Aus-
tralian artist must have worked pat-
iently from the model, and not re-
lied on a defective memory. No doubt
jealous critics afterwards jeered at
the photographic accuracy of his pic-
ture ; but it is till plainly a trum-
peter goose after many years. Only
after I had been walking round some
time did I notice that I was not the
sole person on the premises. Though
it was a warm evening, the other
visitor (a severely-silent and with-
ered old man), was well wrapped up
in a bark overcoat. For some reason
he had been brought along there for
his long rest, after his last Extended
sun-bath. I can’t stand these old
men who sleep in public places, and
I left in disgust without buying anything.”
“Billy Hopkins” : Bishop Frodsham’s story
of the London editor, who had heard of “Queensland’s
icy' mountains,” and the old lady at the tea party,
who “remembered that hymn perfectly,” is percolat-
ing through the northern papers. The yarn sounds
mildly-' humorous on the plains, but that editor may
have been pulling the Bishop’s—er—apron all the
same. The ranges at the back of Cairns are icy-
enough in winter to suit Polar bears or even pen-
guins. I have written my name in frost on the fences
at Atherton, only 2500 ft, above sea-level. At Her-
berton, 3000 ft., I have seen half an inch of ice on my
bath. A little to the south, Bellenden Ker towers
up to a height of over 6000 ft., and the Bishop could
make ice-creams there, without a refrigerator, for
the old lady he met at the tea-party. Bishops don’t
usually get into places like these, hence their tropic
mirth over the ignorance of the benighted Londoner.

“Kobbi” : “Monkbarn’s” yarn(B. 15/8/’l2)
about a white woman living among the Gippsland
blacks recalls an incident in the early history of
Rockhampton (Q,). One Hewitt, who was well
known in his humorous day and blatant generation,
reported to the. local paper that in his wanderings
on the coast he had seen a tribe of blacks, in whose
company he observed a white woman. She was 6ft.
high, of fine form, and perfectly 1 iiude. Although,
apparently, past her first youth, she was still strong
and well. A ship had been wrecked in those parts,
and it was never ascertained with, certainty whether
the captain’s wife, a. splendidly-built woman, who to
some extent, answered the description of the nude
wanderer, had gone to Jones or not. Rock-
hampton built its own theory. Sensation climbed,
on the shoulders of Rumor, and Howl gathered on
the shoulders of Sensation, and on top of Howl was
wild-eyed Blither, naked and unashamed, and with
its hair down. This came to pass when it was
known that Hewitt was actually bringing the
woman to Rockhampton. Then Public Interest
dropped with a sickening thud and broke its neck.
The notorious jester displayed the white female
figurehead of some wrecked vessel.

“Kunisarta” (in a burst of enthusiasm) :
The little war in Timor will bring that almost for-
gotten island of Captain Bligh and earlier buccan-
eer fame into the world’s limelight beam. It is
about the only spot left in the East Indian Archi-
pelago which is not spoiled and infested by the
tourist. In the rugged hills, rajahs still keep just
that sort of state which fired the imaginations of
writers on India in the days of Clive and Hastings,
There is less treasure, of course, in little Timor, but
still quite enough of semi-barbaric luxury and color
to make the visitor feel that he is living through a
series of Arabian Nights’ tales. . The Timorese are
the simplest, most guileless, and joy-loving creatures
left over from the Golden Age. That is the period
they rightly belong to, for they make play of all
their work, and yet do it with exquisite skill and
finish. The women go in groups to pick the cotton
that grows wild in the hills, or the mealies, yams,
bananas and mangosteens which flourish in the com-
pounds. They spin, weave and dye their beautiful
sarongs in the open. Some of the sarongs are ex-
quisite in pattern and color. Both men and women
carve skilfully, and dance with a grace and rhythm
which make the grotesque and ungainly contortions
of the modern ballroom look utterly vulgar and
foolish. Both sexes are soft-voiced and gentle-
mannered, and the women are lovable, good-natured
creatures —unless they have been spoiled and demor-
alised by intercourse with the whites. The Timor-
ese respects the women, and invariably treats them
kindly, though here, as among all Asiatic races,
polygamy is the law as well as the custom. The
islanders are singularly fortunate in being free
from all the Asiatic diseases except beri-beri. This
may be due to their habit of bathing early and late,
also between times. The Dutch and Portuguese will
have an anxious time if the rising spreads, for the
rajahs are able to muster considerable forces. The
Rajah of Amurassie can call up 10,000 men for ser-
vice, while his neighbor of Gabenzoes is good for
about 5000. The European population will not
muster 1000 all told. And it is a very lazy and
self-indulgent foreign legion. The leading club in
Koepang is the far-famed lap of luxury itself. You
can there obtain delicious dinners, rare vintages, and
everything that tends to content and flabbiness. If
the Dutchman knows little else, he knows the art of
dining a guest from A to Z. Now he will have
something else beside feeding to think about.
“Tiaki” : Some information which may be
useful to “Tamumu” and co. is to be found in the
June number of the Wide World Magazine. Alva
L. Cloyd supplies the “facts,” and H. Lane the illus-
trations. Cloyd started on a walking excursion
from the coast at Wairoa (M.L.), and thence to
the Urewera country. On the way he witnessed
some weird and wonderful ceremonies, and at one
part he came across a rushing army of “savages,”
who were whizzing over the landscape and beating
“tom-toms.” (No savage, according to the English
journalistic idea, is complete without his “tom-
tom.”) They (the tom-tommers) had an old chief
anchored down to a “shed-like” affair, which received
its motive power from a scrawny horse, and the
procession shot, “meteor-like,” into the “umbrageous
shades of the forest.” 1 can’t imagine even a mos-
quito bolting “meteor-like” through the supple-jack
bush which adorns Maoriland, let alone a vehicle
like a Mormon caravan. The idea, it appears, was
to rid the rider of a spirit. According to Cloyd,
after an Urewera native is thoroughly and completely
dead the scene of his demise becomes “taupo,” and
the Urewera native is a savage distinct from the
Maori—in fact, he was the aboriginal in possession
when the Maori arrived. Eventually the intrepid ex-
plorer got bogged in under a four-foot fall of snow,
which, taking all the circumstances into account,
was rather an easy let-down. The present writer
was in the Urewera region m 188,9, and his weapons
consisted mostly <?f Matilda and a bottle of whisky.
The latter implement seemed to impress the natives
greatly. Cloyd’s story looks as if it had been written
up in the mighty solitudes of Whitechapel, and
touched up by a sub. who had never personally en-
countered anything more deadly than an infuriated
cab-horse.
BRAINS WHAT TELLS.

The Labor party talks about nationalising land.
If ever it tries to run a farm it will fail for this
reason—that it takes brains to run a farm. Brains!
Why this Labor Ministry has shown that it has not
brains enough to run a saveloy cart.— Hot words
spoken at a recent meeting of the IVomen’s National
League in Melbourne.

Great intellect, assert yourself.
O matrons, wonderful and wise,
Turned recently from dough and delf,
To guide a nation’s destinies,
Behold the rich upon their knees.
As you are brainy be ye strong,
And set aright the proven wrong.
These Labor men have shrivelled brains,
They throw the policies aside
By which their betters won. their gains.
The grand mistakes do not abide.
But you believe, O Freetrade ma’s,
In all the errors of our pa’s.
Your splendid duty do not shirk,
Revive the things that wouldn’t work.
Reforms that didn’t try once more,
Worn-out devices quick renew.
It is the policy of yore
That specially appeals to you.
We’re trusting now to woman’s wit
To drag the bones up from the pit.
Please God, she may with subtle brain
Imbue them all with life again!

FAT.
An Official Who Would Save the State
Money.
Dear Bulletin : Touching the perfectly
veracious remarks of Plain Snaffle (B.
5/9/T2). The writer supplies the bane, as
regards an important side of our military
system, but he makes no serious attempt to
provide the antidote. That valuable horses
are being ruined by the hundred yearly as
the outcome of bad horsemastership; that
the State is thereby wasting large sums of
money ; that the business is inhuman as well
uneconomical —all these have been truisms in
the' service for some time past. The scandal
is largely due to the very natural ignorance
of the liner points of horse-breaking which
characterises 999 soldiers out of every thou-
sand. A skillful horse-master has to be not
only born but made. The type of man who
spends his life learning the soldiering busi-
ness—and this is the type that mostly super-
intends the purchasing and brealcing-in of
the Commonwealth’s remounts at the present
time —has not had the leisure to acquire ex-
tensive equine lore, even assuming he pos-
sesses the capacity. The consequence is he
relies largely, when buying, on the good faith
of the seller —a notoriously dangerous thing
to do in the horse trade —and he gives the
professional breakers a free hand where the
young remounts are concerned. What the
country needs is at least one man at the head
of affairs who knows as much about horse-
trading as any of the folks he is likely to
meet, and who knows more about horse-
breaking than the professional rough-riders.
One possessing the latter qualifications should
be easy to find. In practically every case the
local rough-rider is a rank ignoramus. He
has but one end in view when faced with
a green horse —namely, to quell its spirit
and bring it to heel in a beaten state in the
briefest possible space of time. When one of
these bruising specialists has made a horse
buck —a horse which, if properly handled,
never would have bucked—and has then
kicked and ridden every ounce of buck out of
it, he (the specialist) is satisfied and feels
that he has earned his money. He has grati-
fied his own vanity by providing a highly
spectacular show, and no one can say he has
not done his duty, for there is the cowed and
obviously bested brute to prove the supre-
macy of man to demonstration. That a fort-
night later the animal may be an incurable
outlaw, as a result of his efforts, doesn’t
worry him one iota. The generality of young
horses cannot be subdued to such an extent
as to make them safe and serviceable chargers
in a day, or for that matter in a week. They
need to be handled with care and patient
gentleness and the utmost discrimination,
sometimes over a very long period. The
writer has had a deal to do with horses in
his time, and he avers, without fear of con-
tradiction from knowledgeable quarters, that
out of any given mob of (say) 1000 horses
off the grass, not more than 2(> or 30 will ever
buck if they are handled skilfully in the
initial stages. What the Government needs
to do, if it has any regard for the lives and
limbs of its soldiers, and if it doesn’t want to
waste a vast sum annually on scrapped re-
mounts, is to secure a man (not necessarily
in the service) with high qualifications of the
sort indicated above, and hand the whole con-
trol of the remount business over to him. It
would be his job to see and pass every horse
that was bought by the State. And he would
be required more especially to superintend,
either personally or by a qualified deputy of
his own selection, the breaking-in of each
fresh mob of young horses from the bitting
stage right up to the point where they were
handed over to the men as finished convey-
ances. This sort of employee or official might
cost a trifle, but he would be worth his salary
(providing he was the right sort of man)
many hundred times over. —Yours, etc.,
Miles. *

By the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Apropos Melbourne booksellers (Bulletin
12/9/’12), one of the most noteworthy from the mid-
fifties, up to his death in 1872, was Henry Tolman
Dwight, mainly a trader in second-hand literature.
His immense stock was housed in shed-like premises
in Bourke-street East, adjoining the old White Hart.
At his death, Mr. Dwight’s stock amounted to 30,000
volumes, and Messrs. Cohen and Co. were 14 days
selling it under the hammer. James Caple 1 knew
well. H's shon was on the north side of Collins-
street West, about midway between Elizabeth and
(jueen streets. He was a large, bulbous-nosed man,
who took snuff in quantities. At one general elec-
tion he stood in the interests of the importing party
for North Melbourne, and was badly beaten. His
wife, a small woman in spectacles, also attended in
the shop. lie had a derelict brother, who sold
newspapers on the street corner nearest to Caple’s
shop. (Almost everybody has a derelict brother).
He told me that Janies bad invited him to a Sunday’s
dinner at his place at Elstemwick, but he would not
to, as he could get as good a dinner for what it
would cost to reach Elsternwick. The brother was a
pork-pie sort of man, with few gastronomic- refine-
ments. Mr. Caple at one time did the commercial
community of Melbourne a service. He caused the
establishment of a late letter fee at the G. P. Office.
The mailboats, in the late ’50’s, lay out in Hobson’s
Bay, and the mails closed in Melbourne some hours
before the sailing of the vessel. The mercantile
people grumbled, but the P.O. authorities took no
notice. Caple established a late letter bag in his
shop—it was No. 29 Collins-street West —where, up to
one hour before the sailing of the vessels, letters
could be ijosted at a late fee of Is., subsequently re-
duced. I think, to (id. when the business got bulky.
The fee, of course, went into Caple’s pocket. The
bag was sealed and sent on board bv a special messen-
ber, a boatman being in waiting at Sandridge.
After Caple had been working his late letter bae- for
some months, and making money at it, the P.M.G.
stopped the business. The G.P.O. established its own
letter bag. It should be mentioned that anyone
could post a letter on board up to the time of sailing,
but the cost of getting there, by rail and boat, was
heavy.

Senator McGregor (S.A.), who witnessed
the Governor-General wheel away the first
clod of the Western railway, said he once,
as a navvy, wheeled a barrow and bran-
dished a shovel on the railway from Port
Augusta to Oodnadatta. Senator Fraser, he
said, was then riding up and down the line
as an overseer to make sure that he did his
work properly. ' That was 35 years ago.

The things that may happen to a man
these times (Adelaide Register, 18/9/T2) :
Deceased had been ailing for some time, and was
operated on about a fortnight ago. He also had a
bacon-curing business.
“0.K.” : Died last week, in the West, “Tom
Collins” —or Joe Furphy—as Bulletin
readers knew him. Furphy lived much of
his life at Shepparton, Vic., where the stories
of his domestic eccentricities are district
traditions. His capacity for remaining
silent in the presence of his nearest relatives
is said to have been unlimited. Years ago
he founded a local Suicide Club, and when a
death occurred among its members there was
talk of indicting Tom Collins for man-
slaughter, or for being accessory to the sad
event, or something. Of the many people
that are needed to make a world, the late
Mr. Furphy was one of the least ordinary.
And a man who steadfastly refuses to be
ordinary can ill be spared. He is one of
the little bits of garlic in humanity's salad.
A letter from Rockhampton (C.Q.) :
Exit Paul de Montalk, for 20 years a reporter and
sketch writer on the Rockhampton Record. The beer
habit hastened his end. As some poet-thinker or
other has observed: “The ways of Bung kill slowly,
but they kill exceeding dead.” A thing that distin-
guished deceased from the generality of ink-sprayers
was the azure tint of his blood. He was a Pole,
who came here because of some brick or mud he
threw at the Russian Government. He had been
educated at a German University and spoke five
languages, all of which he brought out with him.
At first he held a job as lecturer at a Maoriland
college, and thence he drifted to press work and its
liquid concomitants.
Rev. R. S. Willis, Anglican parson, who
died lately at North Sydney, aged
75, was nearly the last of the primi-
tive group of Sydney University grad-
uates. He was the son of Joseph S.
Willis (Willis, Merry and Co.), who estab-
lished himself as a merchant on Church Hill
in the first 40’s of the 19th century, and
had his private residence where now stands
the Australian Club House. Willis, junior,
went to the Ma State University
when that institution was a baby.
He took his B.A. in 1855, and was
ordained in 1865. The daily papers
said he was the final remnant of that early
group of graduates, but that is by no means
certain. One Fitzwilliam Wentworth is still
suspected or keeping above ground.
The Office American drops a line
Rockefeller, the absurdly rich old Standard Oiler,
of Abraham Lincoln’s country, who earnestly desires
to buy a second-hand stomach, is now reported to be
so badly scared by murder threats that he lives
through his rollicking days with a guard of 18 buck
niggers. John the Standard Baptist is probably so
well hated that, even if he divided up his dollars
and dismissed his tribe of savages, someone would
hunt him for the pure joy of it. If John were a big,
strong man, instead of a dyspepsia-racked Croesus, he
might get some safe indoor amusement by going down
into a bomb-proof vault, and throwing cash into
the air with a long-handled shovel. Then, when
he had worked off his first burst of energy, he might
order one of his splendid slabs of darkness to hold
out his hat, and pour dollars into it until the crown
fell out, and the money splashed back into a glit-
tering, close-packed lake of wealth. Or he might
take wretchedly hard-up people down in a pinioned
state to view the treasure, just for the pleasure of
seeing their mouths water and hearing them gnash
their teeth. But Rockefeller never gets, any real
amusement like that out of . his fearful hoard. It
gives him no more joy than turnips. All
he gets out of it is the jumps, and a band of prowl-
ing blacks, who probably give him more jumps bv
breathing hard on his neck and looking at him sud-
denly round corners.
I )ied in London, at the age of 67, Charles
George Brooke-Hunt, the last surviving
officer of the Orpheus, which was wrecked in
a particularly thrilling manner at Manukau
(Maoriland) in 1863. The Orpheus was a
steam corvette of 21 guns and 1706 tons, and
was cruising in the more or less aimless
manner usual with naval ironmongery when
the Manukau bar got in its road. The
crew took to the rigging, and tremendous
splashes of water rolled over them again
and again until every stick was torn out and
carried away. The commander, Burnett,
with many of his younger officers, died cling-
ing to the mizzen-top, and the wreckage,
freighted with dead seamen, was carried
inshore by the tide. The small steamer
Wonga-Wonga rescued 70 men, but 23
officers and 166 sailors, marines and boys
were lost. Take it broad and large, it was
one of the worst things the Maoriland sea-
shore ever did. The Manukau bar is still
there, and at times looks ready enough to
put in a bit of overtime at the work of
destruction.
“Scarde”: Paragraphs concerning the late
J. Si Butters, of Melbourne, omit all men-
tion of the man’s non-ordinary personal ap-
pearance. To look at, Butters was decidedly
“out from the ruck,” and it would be a
pity if the millions who never saw him were
left to picture a double of. say. Willie Kelly.
In 1887, and for some years after. Butters
(then well over 50) was an erect fathom of
well-proportioned humanity. He had the
tyicai “warm auburn” hair of Scotland, and
it oozed in wild whiskers and beard. Thin
lips joined firmly in a long line across a
not-too-aggressive jaw. He had a nose, but
all I recollect about it is that “delicately
retrousse” doesn’t describe it. His red eyes
were very small and knowing. His voice
was hard and -metallic;. His hand-shake had
the vigorous cordiality of raw tripe in win-
ter. The unvarying black ton-hat. black
frock-coat and black pants would have made
him conspicuous enough, but he also affected
a black vest cut high and worn open down to
the second vest button, thus exposing a gold-
studded white shirt-front and long, slender
gold chain pendant from his red neck. No
one knew all the sights of Melbourne who
hadn’t seen Butters’ unbuttoned vest, linen
facade and gold chain. He Jived high, and
was a connoisseur in choice viands. There
is large suggestion of chef in the name
James Stetvart Butters.
DENMAN IN ALL HIS GLORY.

late issue are :
MR. GEO. REID IN CHICAGO.
MEAT IN AMERICA.
About 60 years ago Van Diemen’s Land
resolved to. change its name, and be known
as Tasmania for the future. It was a wise
decision, for at that time “Van Demonian”
was generally regarded as a roundabout way
of spelling “lag.” But one crusted institu-
tion completely ignored the change, and to
this day it continues to call itself the “Van
Diemen’s Land Company,” It is an ab-
sentee English corporation, founded in the
early days, which acquired for nothing or
perhaps less, a huge tract of territory up
Circular Head way. A century of unearned
increment seems to have done this property
and its absentee proprietors a lot of good,
although the Tasmanians who have really
given the land its value have derived little
or no benefit from it. One George Thomas
Bait, a director of the V.D.L. Co., whose ad-
dress was Ethel burgh House, Bishopsgate,
London, lately shambled into eternity, leav-
ing behind him the tidy little sum of
£377.926. Most of this morally belongs to
the Tasmanians, but apnarently not a penny
of it will cross the Equator. Details of
Bait’s will are published in the London
papers. Not a single Tasmanian institution
or charity is mentioned to the extent -of a
copper.
Henry Varley’s will has been proved in
London. The Anglo-Australian butcher-
evangelist, or meat preacher, left £2375. He
did not annex a wealthy wife, like some
other evangelists of our acquaintance. Var-
ley was running a sausage and kidney and
chop shanty in Pakington-street, Geelong
(Vici), when he discovered and developed a
talent for open-air preaching. He praught
in a fashion suggestive of his trade, and
when he smote the Bible in moments of fer-
vor, he always left the idea that he had
struck Exodus, in the eye with a hind quarter
of mutton. In the fullness of time he
migrated to London, where his admirers
built him a tabernacle on Notting Hill.
Spurgeon is said to have thought highly of
his preaching powers. Varley revisited
Australia from time to time, and specialised
on social purity crusades. When he ad-
dressed himself “to men only,” the house
was generally full. A number of his ser-
mons and addresses have been published in
pamphlet form. In one of these there is
some plain speaking about the irregularities
of the late Duke of Edinburgh, son of Queen
Victoria, during his stay in Melbourne. A
certain voluptuous female, named Sarah
Sagin, was Melbourne’s choicest gift to the
Royal visitor. For years afterwards she
announced her free-and-easy establishment
as “Under Boyal Patronage.” But economy,
not immorality, was Edinburgh’s strong
point.
Clerics have their housing
troubles as well as Governors.
When Dr. Mannix was due at
Melbourne as coadjutor or as-
sistant to B.C. Archbishop
Carr, it was obvious that he
must have a residence and a
parish. He couldn’t hang out
in an hotel, and “the Palace”
was occupied. Now there was
a fine parish and a commodious
presbytery at West Melbourne,
but_ Father Carey was in occu-
pation, as parish priest. He
couldn’t be canonically removed,
except for “grave cause,” and
good Father Carey looked about
the last possible man to supply
grave cause.” But the matter
was got over. Father Carey
accepted promotion downward
to the parish of Brunswick, and
upward to the status of Dean.
So, having thus started suddenly
on the ladder of promotion, via
the brickyards of Brunswick,
there may be a great future
before Dean Carey. He may
even be a Cardinal one day.
Meanwhile, the coadjutor has a
roof over his head, and is no
longer in danger of having to
camp out.
Consider the expert in all his
glory! A quarter century ago
Gyles Turner was the great
banking genius of Australia.
True, the smash that his bank
made was as the smash of 10
(other men are still busy pulling
the concern round), but the
great banker’s knowledge of the
theory of the game was illimit-
able, and if he failed a little
in the simple, dull-brown job of
making h wise selection of the
securities to lend some millions
of money on, well, no man can
be perfect. Similarly, Jacques
Martin, long autocrat of the
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance
Society, was called the greatest
life assurance expert south of
the line. He knew everything
about his business —even the
number of Tubal Cain’s endow-
ment policy. Still, some people
said that the expenses were too
high, and that the policy of
opening offices in Johannesburg
and Edinburgh and Dundee and
Aberdeen and Leicester and Bloemfontein and
all manner of places was altogether to rash
and. costly. Now. a fierce demand is made
in the Victorian State Parliament for an in-
quiry into the Colonial Mutual. Jacques
Martin, the great oanjandrum who devised
the policy of the office, was, as already men-
tioned, an exnert and a genius. Some con-
cerns get on better without a genius.
The mischievous old presentation habit or
nuisance was reduced to well-merited absur-
dity, the other day, when the Southall-Nor-
wood (Eng.) district council unanimously
resolved to “place portraits of the Earl and
Countess of Jersey on the walls of the coun-
cil chamber in recognition of the great in-
terest they have always taken in the welfare
of the district,” and followed that up with
a special resolution requesting the Jerseys
to “provide the portraits.” If every up-
country banking official, parson, etc., had to
personally fill the purse of sovereigns that it
is the imbecile local custom to heap on him,
previous to liis departure, marriage, or what
not, there would be more joy in the land
than if 99 sinners had suddenly died unre-
pentant.
RECKONING IT UP.
I think the method adopted in Europe might with
advantage be employed in Sydney, and the patrol
men authorised to act promptly, and demand a pre-
scribed penalty where breaches occur, giving a re-
ceipt to the offender for the amount claimed and
paid. —Sydney Lord Mayor Clarke.
PATROL M AN: “ Let's see . Three spits at the
corner of George-street, a tram ticket in
King-street , and a cigar butt. That makes
five and a penny ha'penny. Thank you."
A BLACKSMITH’S OPINION.
“For severe colds, which gave me racking pains
in the chest, I used Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
with the best results. It ends these colds in little
or no time, and I do not think there is a better
remedy on the,market,” says Mr. John McGrade, 154
Young Street, Annandale, N.S.W. “I give Chamber-
lain’s Cough Remedy to my boy and girl for colds
and croup, and say that it is an excellent remedy
for children.”*

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The application made to the Victorian
State Parliament, for an inquiry into the affairs of
the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society, is a
matter which might well have happened much earlier,
not only to this concern, but to others. If the investi-
gation comes off, the results may be surprising, or
they may not, but if the event leads to a general
habit of investigation, it will not be trouble wasted.
A strange, quiet, peaceful, casual, slummocky place is
Australia, so far as its life assurance control goes.
Except for some limitations, which are almost too
small to be worth mentioning, anybody can start a
life assurance concern, which is much worse than
letting anybody start a bank. For when grave sus-
picion falls on a bank, the depositors rush it, and
thereby put it promptly to the test. But a life office
can’t be rushed with any degree of promptitude.
People can stop paying premiums, and lose their
investment; or they can ask with more or less success
for their surrender values (which are fixed by the
management—in the case of the dreadful 1.0. F. of
Canada there were none at all) ; also, they can study
the balance-sheet, which most of them find most in-
comprehensible. And that is about all. Nominally,
of course, the policy-holders control a mutual office.
They can shift the directors if they have any suspi-
cions, and appoint new ones, with instructions to
hold a rigid investigation. But when a concern has
policy-holders all over the world, it has to be a very
large and terrible suspicion that reaches in the ordin-
ary course to the ears of 2 p.c. of them. If the owner
of a £lOOO policy becomes so embittered that he
will spend £20,000 in rousing his fellow policy-
holders to an investigation of the accounts, he may do
something—provided he is able to get the addresses of
his fellow policy-holders. But people of such ferocious
energy are rare. The general course of things is this:
The management draws up a balance-sneet. The
management values the assets. The management
states that all is right, and implies that it (the man-
agement) is above suspicion. The management sends
out proxy forms to remote shareholders if there is
any urgent question to the discussed, or any attempt
to unseat the directors, and generally it gets enough
of them to vote down any number of local malcon-
tents who are likely to personally attend the annual
meeting. The directors are, as a rule, able, if they
so desire, by the aid of proxies, to virtually re-elect
themselves, or if one of their number is dead or tired,
to replace him by a friend of their own. They are
generally able, if they so desire, to elect the auditors,
who generally report that all is right. (The auditors,
by the way, hardly ever value the securities, which
may be scattered all over the world, and quite beyond
any one man’s valuation.) In fact, the whole busi-
ness is a good deal of a family affair, if the direc-
torial and managerial family likes to make it so.
There is no Government audit or inspection or valua-
tion. The States did nothing when they had the sole
power, and now the Commonwealth has the power and
it does nothing.
The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society was re-
puted, rightly or wrongly, to have been heavily struck
in the securities when the Victorian boom broke nearly
20 years ago, and in the absence of any State audit
or valuation it had no easy way of getting rid of
the suspicion. It might, perhaps, have asked for a
special Parliamentary investigation, but it didn’t. It
isn’t an absolutely first-class affair in point of size,
for its assets only add up to a trifle over £3,300,000.
It gathers its moderate bit of business over a very
large area, having offices at Aberdeen, Belfast, Bir-
mingham, Cardiff, Cork, Dublin, Dundee, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester,
Newcastle and Sheffield in the British Isles; also at
Bloemfontein, Capetown, Durban and Johannesburg
in South Africa, and at many places besides. The
fact that all this wide spreading of its business ten-
tacles produces a comparatively moderate amount of
trade, suggests that, in its own country, where it
should be best (or worst) known, it has no great
connection. The widespread nature of the office must
needs add to the expenses; it makes it extra difficult
to keep an eye on the quality of the securities; it
makes it extra-difficult for any malcontent to rouse
the policy-holders to active investigation; it makes
it extra-easy for the people in authority to preserve
their authority unquestioned, if they want to do so ;
and it tends to add to the death losses, for Australia
and Maoriland are the healthiest countries in the
world, and all this expansion into less healthy regions
is bad for the burial average.
Last year (1911) the expenses of the Colonial
Mutual were much higher than the year before. The
closest estimate The Bulletin could make was that
they represented £26 16s. Bd. per cent, of the total
income, which was very heavy indeed. The assets of
the ordinary and accident departments consisted
mostly (nearly 70 per cent.) of mortgages and free-
holds, which is rather a dangerous kind of business,
unless closely watched, and in the absence of a State
audit and valuation it is difficult to say how much
watching was done. And the industrial department
was wholly depressing. Its biggest asset was “Exten-
sion of Organisation Account,” which is simply a
paper or goodwill item, and is so described (to save
space) in the table below. This paper item has been
increasing alarmingly:—-
Colonial Mutual Industrial Life Branch.
1909. 1910. 1911.
Liabilities .. .. £16,745 £89,209 £109,870
Visible .. .. £4,456 £7,047 £6,476
Paper or goodwill.. 11,289 82,162 103,394
£15,745 £89,209 £109,870
This showed a huge increase in the paper, or good-
will item (or, to speak plainly, the deficit) of the
industrial branch. And as the ordinary branch has
to carry its industrial brother somehow, the assets
of that branch now include an advance of £49,178
to the other branch —the one which has only £6476
of its own to bless itself with. Some people seem to
look unkindly on this asset of £49,178, and possibly
on some other assets, anil when it was resolved to
declare no bonus this year, but to hold over
the surplus of £149,732 (which is partly
made up of the £49,178 abovementioned) tiil
1913, they weren’t mollified in any way.
The reasons assigned for this proceeding looked
fair enough, but still the malcontents were not molli-
fied. It is alleged that the methods used to prevent a
new man getting on the board last year, and getting
a view of the inside aspect of things, were “over the
odds,” said methods consisting, according to the
story, mostly of proxies; and there is a demand for
a general pubb'c overhaul. The demand is one which
the directors should receive with applause. In fact,
they should demand a rigid Government audit and
valuation, and a complete public inspection. Then, if
all went well, the Society could advertise that it
was the only one of its kind in Australia which
possessed a State certificate of solvency.

These are exceedingly good times for the Melbourne
Tramway Co. It was founded in 1884 to work the
Melbourne and suburban tramways (it didn’t build
them), and it got a 32 years’ lease, so it has to
give up possession on July 1, 1916. It had to keep
the lines in repair, and hand over the system in good
order, and there is no reason to believe there will be
anything wrong with the system when it is handed
over, save that it will be about as antiquated as
Ahab’s chariot. Also, the co. has to pay interest on
the debt which the municipalities incurred to build
the lines, and to provide a sinking fund sufficient"to
extinguish that debt by 1916. All these things it has
been able to do without turning a hair, thanks to
low wages, high fares and general economy. The in-
terest and the sinking fund contribution are among
the expenses, and the profits shown above are net.
Also, the reserves are wholly the property of the
company, unless some small amount has to be ex-
pended for repairs in order to put the lines in the
good order and condition that the lease stipulates
for at the date of surrender. Yet that isn’t likely,
for as the first business after the surrender will pro-
bably be to scrap everything except the merest skele-
ton, and instal an electric system, nobody in author-
ity is likely to be very particular about small details.
Put in a condensed form this is how the co.’s assets
stand:—
1909. 1910. 1912.
Liquid assets ..£995,415 £1,023,708 £1,300,067
Freeholds . . 244,507 248,641 222,906
Other property . . 149,541 156,116 163,765
Total ..£1,389,463 £1,428,465 £1,686,738
Less debts.. 212,878 145,310 127,861
Surplus. . £1,176,585 £1,283,155 £1,558,877
Or, to go into further details, the assets, as at June
30, 1912, were as follows:
v Solid Assets.
Freeholds ' £222,906
Securities .. 1,257,280
Debts due to company . . .. .. 37,433

Cars, grips, and other material . . . . 158,766
r v £1,693,412
Less liabilities .. .. ~ 127,861
£1,565,551
Therefore, even supposing all the £170,439 worth of
More Doubtful-looking Assets only yield enough to
make the lines habitable when they are handed over
three years hence, the co. still has £1,395,112, plus
all the profits it is liable to make in the next three
years, with which to return its shareholders the
£250,000 which they actually put into the business,
and a huge bonus to boot. Yet, if business remains
on the present level, they will, by 1916, have again
got their original capital back nearly twice over in
dividends, and have got their capital added 11 times
over to reserve funds. Truly, this is something like
being on a good wicket!
A great deal of the luck of a monopoly depends on
the kind of Government that the monopolv strikes.
The Melbourne Tramway Co. was legally liable, after
a certain number of years, to have its fares revised
to any extent by the Victorian Parliament; there-
fore, its 32 years’ lease was never worth as much as
it looked. There was no written proviso for revision
of the charges of the Sydney Gas Co. And the Tram-
way Co. did things in the way of dragging stupendous
profits out of its customers—it has averaged within
a fraction of 100 p.c. per annum for the past two
years- which the Sydney Gas Co. never had the
courage to attempt. But the tram concern struck a
friendly Government and a complaisant Parliament,
and nothing serious happened to it. There is now
hardly time for anything tq happen to it. The
chances are that it will retire in a blaze of glory in
1916, and return the original capital and hand out a
lordly bonus of about £5 for every 20s. Of course
the market has been hard at work for a long time
discounting that bonus, but that is a way the market
has.

That 21f p.c. div. is reckoned on the written-down
capital, not on the money that the shareholders put
into the business. On the original capital it is only
a trifle over 2+ p.c. The co. was formed in 1885, as
the Federal Coffee Palace Co., Ltd., with an author-
ised capital of £200,000, of which £122,752 was
issued with Is. a share uncalled. When the co. was
formed, Melbourne was very thirsty, and the result
was that the property, etc., were very much over-
valued. In 1897, soon after the bank collapse, when
people were feeling sobered down, the co. discovered
that its property wasn’t worth the £151,083 that it
originally thought it was. Instead, it decided that
it wasn’t worth more than £65,000 ; and the furni-
ture sank in their estimation from £29,210 to
£17,866. There was also a big mortgage, £68,000.
and this plaster was bigger than the book value of
the premises. So something had to go, and the 19s.
shares were written down to 2s„ with Is. callable,
of which ljd. was then called up. This table shows
10 years’ progress:—
1902. 1911. 1912.
Liabilities £60,329 £45,088 £40,708
Liquid assets 3,090 2,448 2,488
Deficit £57,239 £42,640 £38,220
So in that period the co. has got out of the hole to
the extent of £19,019 —this, of course, besides paying
for renewals and repairs to property. The plaster
on the premises is being removed gradually. It now
stands at £38,500. During the year £4750 was
hacked off, and each bit taken off means less interest
to pay, and consequently a bigger chip to knock off
next year. At the present rate of going it will take
about seven or eight years to remove the whole of the
incubus. Then things will look up for the share-
holders. Meanwhile, they must be content with a
modest return of 6d. per annum on the 19s. lid. they
dropped into the plate.
In a financial way, the present N.S.W.
Government appears to be plunging down a very steep
place into a very deep sea. It has managed, in the
first eight months of 1912, to increase the expendi-
ture by £1,474,983, as compared with the first eight
months of 1911. Yet there is nothing special to
show for the extra outlay, and it hasn’t reduced the
expenditure of loan funds by a single copper. In
fact, the loan expenditure has gone up to a point
never before dreamt of in the State. The McGowen
Ministry shows a cynical disregard of its pledge to
reduce borrowing, and restrict loan expenditure to
works that will pay full interest and sinking fund,
which is a marvel in the way of the political Judas
Iscariot or turncoat business. The straits to which
it is reduced these days begin to arouse interest. A
sum of £2,150,000 has been borrowed on short
terms from the Federal Government. The trifle at
credit of the sinking fund has been borrowed. In
1910 the Treasurer had about £3,200,000 at com-
mand to the credit of various funds, but by June,
1912, it had all been spent, save £lOO,OOO or less.
The revenue, closer settlement, public works and loan
funds had oyer £2,600,000 on hand at 30/6/’lO. By
30/6/’l2 they were overdrawn to the extent of nearly
£700,000, and two months later they were over-
drawn to the extent of over £2,100,000. In fact,
every available fund seems to have been used up’
Perhaps the prize jest of the situation lies in the
fact that, last January, the N.S.W. Treasury gave
notice that it would redeem over £2,500,000 of old
4 p.c. securities. It wasn’t absolutelv bound to re-
deem them, for they were securities of the optional
variety, but it proposed to float a new loan at a
lower rate of interest. Now it becomes a verv
serious question if the loan won’t have to be re-
floated at a higher rate of interest. Short-dated
loans, short-dated deposits, short-dated overdrafts
threaten to fall due shortly all round the wildly ex-
travagant McGowen Cabinet, and its prospects show
no improvement every day.

Revenue from sales of gas for the half-year is £2034 •
for the corresponding period in 1911 -it was £1843’
So a very satisfactory increase is shown. In the
latter half of 1910 a reduction was made in the price
of gas, and though this had the effect of lowering
the profits for a while, the co. has now caught them
up, and for the first time has gone over the £7OO
mark. Liquid assets are £1331, and liabilities
£l6, a surplus of £1315, as against £1237 for
December, 1911, and £990 for June, 1906. So in
six years, besides paying the regular dividends and
repairing, renewing and adding to plant and mains,
the co. still is £247 to the good. And there ap-
pears to be nothing in sight which is likely to in-
terfere with the progress.

The return is the poorest on the above list, and
the above list goes back to December, 1904. For
some reason or another a severe slump set in after
July, 1911, and has continued since. July, 1911,
was, on the figures, the pinnacle of the co.’s pros-
perity. Next half-year the profits dropped by £383.
This half-year they have declined by another £303.
This is a condensed statement of the position:—
July, Jan., July,
r , 1911. 1912. 1912.
Gross profats £4362 £4377 £4050
Less expenses .. .. 3078 3476 3452
, , £1284 £9Ol £595
Less depreciation . . .. 104 42
, £llBO £9Ol £556
Less div. and bonus .. 847 869 522
£333 £32 £34
So the verdict is (1) That the gross profits have
diminished within the last half-year; (2) that the
expenses increased greatly during the half-year which
ended on January, 1912, and have been reduced very
little since then ; (3) that the allowance for depre-
ciation has been reduced, presumably in an effort to
put a good face on things, but all the same a very
bad face has been put on things; and (4) that
despite the reduction of dividend and bonus, the
amount available for reserves is only about one-
tenth what it was a year ago.
The capital has increased a little of late, but even
now it is only £5OlB. Both the value of the stock
and the amounts owing to the co. are rather less than
they were six months ago. The co. seems to be in
a chronic- state of indebtedness to the bank. At
July, 1911, its overdraft, less cash and deposits on
the other side of the account, was £523. At Janu-
ary, 1912, it was £471. At July, 1912, it was
£1639. No doubt the famous general strike did
some harm to the business, but even apart from that
the position looks none too progressive.

The Bill, now before Victorian Assembly,
re the State’s brick paddock at Thornbury, provides
for a 21-year lease of the land, at £l5O a year, for
purposes only. The Government claims
50,000 bricks a day if it wants them, at 31s. per
1000, on trucks at Thornbury. In case of failure to
deliver, the Government may purchase elsewhere at
the company’s risk, or it may impose a penalty, or
determine the lease. It looks a good bargain on the
State’s part, especially as the Combine’s present
price for baked clay is 40s. per 1000; but if it will
pay a private company to load the articles in trucks
at 315., the State could probably do it at 255. or
thereabouts. Anyhow, a lot depends on how the
conditions are enforced. The affability of a Minister,
or his overweening anxiety not to “inflict hardship”
on anybody, may turn the penalty clauses of the con-
tract into vain words.

Ardlethan (N.S.W.) is suffering from a
mi Id sort of boom, on the strength of recent discov-
eries of tin in the district. Most of the land is
privately held, but over 200 applications for authority
to enter have been lodged with the warden. Report
says that the Carpathia mine has been sold for £7OOO
cash, and £lO,OOO in shares, but the name of the
purchasing co. is not stated. Neither is the number
of tons of crude ore from which was picked the parcel
of 10 tons, said to have returned over 40 p.c. tin.
The same line of lode has been tapped in places for
about three-quarters of a mile, but there seems to
be a disinclination to do any sinking worth the men-
tion, as the deepest shaft is not 20ft. in the most in-
teresting direction.
* * * *
For the half-year ending July 31, Y. Water
tm mine (Emmaville, N.S.W.) produced 1.3171 b. of
tin oxide per cubic yard (195.78 tons). The grade
compares with 1.6551 b. per cubic yard for the pre-
vious six months, but the quantity of the globe
treated increased from 246,700 cubic yards to 333,000
cubic yards. The tin sold realised £24,785. Four
Is. dividends (£8000) were paid, £2660 was
written off for depreciation, and £5Bl paid for,
income tax, leaving £5784.
Last week the Junction North (Broken
Hill) mill . recovered 316 tons of lead and 18,5460 z.
of silver in 562 tons of concentrates, the average
assay being 56.4 p.c. lead, 330 z. silver, 14 p.c. zinc.
In addition, the mill produced 330 tons of zinc con-
centrates, assaying 42 p.c. zinc, 9 p.c. lead and 16oz.
of silver. The gross value for the week’s run was
£9270 (lead at £2O per ton, silver at 2s. 6d. per
oz., zinc concentrates at £2 per ton). The Junction
North is producing from 12,000 to 15,000 tons of
lead a year, and the silver recoveries average 58oz.
per ton of lead. It has been officially estimated that
the working profit is £3OOO for the week, and, if
this is correct, the Junction North should not be long
in securing a firmer financial foothold. Still, the
mixing of slimes with crude ore, and the adoption
of the mineral separation process was by no means
an unqualified success at first, and -the Junction North
having got into debt, has had to make up financial
leeway. A call of Is. was due September 11.

The Mining Engineer answers :—“Chlor-
ide’s” howl about lodide is -not surprising.
In fact, it was to be expected, for therein
lies the explanation of his connection with the mine.
Yet what does the howl amount to? The “erroneous
ideas” (B. 12/9/’l2) are supposed to be established
by the peevish objection taken to a trivial detail of
the capital distribution, but the net result is not dis-
proved, unless perhaps “Chloride” means to show
that the concern is loaded with an extra £3500 not
suspected. He does not discuss the value of the -ore
reserves in their relation to costs, but merely says
that “valueless figures are provided.” The showing
of just wherein the figures are valueless is successfully
evaded, for obvious reasons, and attention is drawn
away to the more congenial subject of the immense
and dazzling possibilities. It is time that pause is
taken to cry out against 15s. per ton as the cost of
mining, and the triumphal fact that the ore is actu-
ally being broken for ss. per ton is loudly acclaimed.
But the wages cost of breaking ore is not the total
cost of mining, not by a long way, as even “Chloride”
would know, if he had ever been connected with the
operative side of mining, instead of only that side
which is concerned with long-winded, optimistic
scribbling to the daily press. This class of scribe
would have the public believe that the net profit
on that picked parcel sent to Cockle Creek was
£7 13s. per ton of crude ore, whereas it is doubtful
if a shilling was netted after the deduction of all
expenses. But, leaving out of consideration past results
and present costs on the ground that a new era is to be
ushered in—the position is this: The lodide is going
strong, and has improved almost daily since Fawcett’s
report. That it is a justifiable proposition for a
development company is beyond question, but there,
for the time being, -the matter should end. But this
course has not been taken, and, although the present
positive value of the mine is nil, or thereabout, the
lodide is now loaded with an absurdly ton-heavy capi-
tal. which is to be redeemed bv the little tin-pot
smelter proposed to be erected. “Chloride” misses the
significence of the siliceous ironstone, once again in
italics. His “best silver-lead smelter and adminis-
trator at liberty in Australia” ought not to be on
the show for at least a couple of years to come, but
the good administrator certainly was needed before
the float was rushed on to the public, long ere its
nr : me. But, the plan suits the promotion idea, be-
cause “mining” includes a good deal of speculation
in human nature, and occasional developments in
oxidised ore are a thing to juggle with and impress
the mind of the public, which rarely discriminates
between sensation and soundness. Budgery, C.S.A..
Cordillera, Mount Costigan, these and many others
are monuments of unseemly haste.

“Tinapagee”: Standard Consolidated Tin
(N.Q.) shareholders will agree with you (B.
22/8/12) that the “hand to mouth treatment at the
mine is to be deprecated”; but the show should
hardly he compared with the Oaks Rush. It is onlv
a 100,000-share concern, with 60,000 issued, the
remaining 40.000 being kept in reserve to provide
the milling plant, and there is a likelihood of them
being offered at par (10s.) shortly. The treatment
plant will only cost £BOOO at most. The dumps,
etc., left by the prospectors above the 50ft. level

represent £16,000. The shaft is now down 60ft.
below this level, with the 10ft. lode of 5 p.c. tin oxide
already proved for 240 ft. in length. This adds
another 8500 tons, worth £50,000, on to reserves.
State Geologist Cameron reports that the “well-defined
character of the fissure gives exceptional promise of
considerable persistency with depth.” Outside the
Dainttee the co. is prospecting four other very prom-
ising lodes. The proved width of the Abernethy is
20ft., worth £4 a ton. The co. seems now to have
struck something worth while, so it is up to the
directors to hustle on with a new plant, as tin won’t
always stand at £2OO. The rattle-trap five-head now
in commission is a waste of time and tin, notwith-
standing the £4OOO profit for five months from the
partial treatment of 900 tons of stone.

North Smithfield (Gympie, Queensland) got
on the old payable track when it shouted itself a
shilling dividend —the first since June, 1909. The
July crushing gave 711 oz. from 434 tons, and August
went better with 8560 z. from 300 tons. Most of
the payable stuff is coming from the 680 ft. level,
where a 14in. reef blossoms like the rose. Its divi-
dends to date total £4 6s. lOd. per share, which
isn’t bad on 48,000 half-crown shares, paid up to
13d.
“Kobbi”: Mount Garnet (N.Q.J is to be
resurrected, which is a further tribute to the ascent
of King Copper. The show put its first parcel of
stuff through its own smelter way back in 1901. At
that time, the directors reckoned on 209,000 tons of
6 p.c. ore in sight. It must be there still, or most
of it. It certainly wasn’t got out.
* * * *
Mount Molloy (Q.) has to face recon-
struction. It has produced 1370 tons of copper,
which realised £196,000, out of which it paid a
few thousands in dividends. It has a good supply
of water and timber, for it is close to Rifle Creek,
and is equipped with a smelter and converter plant.
The mine did very little good since the railway (22
miles) was made. It is thought that some of the
low-grade silicious ore can be concentrated, and that
the show is worth a course of prospecting. The ore
shoots have been payable but erratic.
* * * *
Hampden-Cloncurry has engaged a con-
verter superintendent from Port ltembla (N.S YV.).
A good run is expected for September, though a
leaky water packet caused some delav. Plenty of
ore, limestone and ironstone, are available. But the
supply of coke has been short. Smelters in Queens-
land obtain most of their coke fnm Hie south coast
of N.S.W., and the break-up of the Wollongong and
Port Kembla jetties has interfered with shipments.
The Hampden co. has secured a six months option
over the Answer mine, which has a shaft down 701 t.,
and is showing good prospects. First-grade ore
shipped has been 30 p.c., while seconds assay 22 p.c.
copper. So far the Hampden co. has been very
lucky, by securing mines like the Duchess, and the
Trikelana—lo miles from the Duchess—at moderate
prices. The Mascotte, Scalper and Answer, recently
taken in hand by the Hampden “0. . are promising
shows in the early stage of development. .1 be
Hampden leases supply the smelter with ore that
helps to flux the silicious material from the
Duchess. It is a favorable sign that the co. intends
to sink No. 1 shaft another lift. This shaft is down
214 ft. From No. 2 shaft the workings on vhe east
and west ore bodies extend a long distance to the
north. At 748 ft. N. a rise is up Onft. ibove the
280 ft. level; width of lode 39in., worth 5} p.c.
Standard Consolidated Tin Mines (Q.)
have purchased an up-to-date 20-head battery and gas
engine from the Golden Horn Co. (near Charters
Towers). Since April the old mill treated 838 tons
for 47.4 tons of tin oxide, assaying 68 p.c. metal.
The recoveries have not been good, and it is calculated
that it will pay to treat the tailings again when the
new plant is in commission. There are 86,030 shares
issued. Co. has three lodes, the workings on which
have been confined to shallow levels.
* * * *
At Charters Towers the Brilliant P.C. is
coming into favor, because of good prospects ob-
tained near the bottom of the winze 220 ft. east of the
New Brilliant Freehold’s boundary, and the extension
of the 1596 ft. level to the east on a favorable forma-
tion.
Brilliant Deeps (Charters Towers) has
opened a share register in London. At the mine they
are cutting down the western side of the rise and
winze connecting No. 4 with No. 2 level. It is in-
tended to form a main haulage-way or underlie shaft
some 173 ft. west of the crosscut, and consequently, in
the thick of the shoot of good stone. This reef, when
No. 4 level was being driven, produced 323 tons,
worth £2323, which is over £7 per ton. Of course,
the reef is rather bunchy and patchy, as shown by
the fact that the smallest lot crushed was 48 tone for
£l4 15s. 6d. per ton, while 202 tons averaged
£3 13s. No. 5 level has been driven 279 ft. For
more than 140 ft. it was a blank, then a reef sft.
wide appeared in the face. Since then the level has
shown a reef from a few inches to 3ft. in width. No.
5 level is in 279 ft., so it will soon be as far from
the crosscut as No. 4 level, and it will be interesting
to the Brilliant Blocks to watch the course taken by
the level, for No. 4 was undoubtedly heading for the
boundary, and was taking a much more southerly
course than was expected.
Mount Morgans are moving up in spite
of the mob of shares left by W. R. Hall, W. (Yd big-
nan and A. J. Oallan. There has been no attempt
to force sales at low figures. With - increased prices
for copper and good management, shareholders ex-
pect a nse in dividends. With a reasonable cost, of
producing copper, big results may be expected, and
1S i. i°P that, with general manager Magnus at
the helm, and metallurgist Wesley at the smelter,
the profit for the current half-year will be a happy con-
trast to the miserable result achieved for six months
to Nov, 30, 1911, when 3698 tons of copper were
£2O per ton. For the very next half-vear to the end
of May, the profit was £187,393, or' at the rate of
£5O per ton on the 3742 tons of red metal.
* * * *
Fpr three months to end of August, Mount
Elliott (Q.) smelted 16,482 tons of ore for 2135 tons
of copper, 38770 z. gold, and 40050 z. silver. So the
furnace has required an average of less than eight
tons of ore to run out a ton of copper. The ex-
traction averaged 12.9 p.c. The August run smelted
the most ore (5710 tons) —in fact, a record quantity
to date—-vet the yield of copper was lower than for
the two previous months. June gave 749 tons ; July,
1 12 tons; August, 674 tons. This reduction of the
yield was expected, as some of the richest stopes
eased off. At No. 5 level driving is going on to
define the contour of the ore body, picked up by the
diamond drill, and this make of, ore will be sunk
on at no distant date, and all doubts about the verti-
cal continuity of the lode set at rest. Assays from
development work are not high. Hampden Consols
and the Trafalgar mine continue to develop on sound
lines* though the ore (6 p.c, and 8 p.c. copper) isn’t
nearly so r,eh as that being stoped at Mount Elliott.
Probably the latter will have to increase the capacity
of its smelting plant when a larger supply of ore
becomes available from outside mines.
The *Radium Hill finds it difficult to pre-
pare radium bromide in a state of purity at the Wool-
wich works (Sydney). The impurities contained in
radium sulphate from the furnace have been trouble-
some to separate, for it is only by the tedious pro-
cess of fractional crystalisation that the pure radium
salt can be prepared. To extract a grain of gold
from a ton of rock would be difficult, but it is com-
paratively an easy task to the extraction of a milli-
gram of pure radium bromide from a ton of concen-
trates. About 15 tons of the latter are treated and
reduced to radium sulphate and uranium oxide per
week. Though official information is scanty, it would
seem that it takes four or five tons of ore to pro-
duce a ton of concentrates. Salts of iron, barium,
uranium, etc., crystallise from solution under variable
conditions, so constant repetition of chemical methods
is required to eliminate the impurities and extract
the final germ of radium from the mountains of
.debris.
Jack Lennerberg and late Assistant Gov-
ernment geologist Gibson, who left the West some
months ago to prospect the Northern Territory on
behalf of Dorrie Doolette, have sent word that no-
thing worth mentioning was met with in the
McArthur River country, which is the track the rail-
way would take if it went through the Eastern States.
They are now sampling some copper shows at Pine
Creek, and intend to have a look at a “big thing”
near Port Darwin later on.
“Few miners are now employed, and the
completion of the treatment plant seems as remote
as ever,” remarks a local paper of Bullfinch. This,
taken in conjunction with the fall in the market,
seems to indicate that again all is not well with this
once high-priced bird. May be the moulting season
has come along with its train of worries.
* * * *
Sirdar (W.A.) has bowed to the inevit-
able and made preparations to wind up. During an
unprofitable existence, extending over some years,
33,000 tons of ore were dug out of the old General
Gordon mine, in the Kanowna district, for a recovery
of about £25,000. As is usual in cases where a
poor and struggling co, is working a low-grade show,
most of this return went back into the mine, and
the remainder was spent on plant and equipment.
Shareholders got nothing. Latterly yields have been
so disappointing, and prospects so discouraging,
that there was nothing for it but suicide. Arrange-
ments are now being made to realise on the assets,
which chiefly consist of 20,000 tons of accumulated
residues, and some odds and ends in the shape of
plant.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has now got
all the water it wants from the Government scheme,
and is confident of treating from 10,000 to 12,000
tons a month on its Ora Banda show. The first
(partial) clean up realised £2300 from 2155 tons,
but solutions absorbed some of the gold. The next
return is not expected to be anything to blow about,
but the one after may. Costs, including “every-
thing,” are not expected to exceed iOs. a ton, and all
over this, minus London exes, will, it is alleged, be
available for dividends.
* * * *
Lawlers (W.A.) has diminished in the last
12 months from a flourishing centre to a dis-
mal community of 50 souls, six pubs, a'
store or two and many goats. All this trans-
formation is the result of the closing down of the
Northern mines. Several shows in the neighborhood
are believed to have the makings of good gold pro-
ducers in them, but the shoots are small, and, even if
they do turn out as well as the oldest optimistic in-
habitant anticipates, they won’t be much. The
chilly hand of Death seems to be pressing on the
locality.
Seen through the eyes of a Government
field geologist. Kurnalpi (W.A.) is sized up as fol-
lows: (1) More reefs and lodes may be found in the
vicinity of the old alluvial deposits. (2) Quartz
reefs, though numerous and strong on the field, do
not appear to live at depth, or carry payable gold
for any depth. (3) As rich contact gold has been
found in places—there may be other undiscovered
patches elsewhere. (4) Existence of payable lode
formations in the district considered doubtful. (5) As
regards the claims where the recent sensational finds
were made, other rich discoveries may be hit on, but,
in the absence of proof, the possibility of locating
anything else but an occasional dab is doubted.

Meekatharra (W.A.) is receiving further
attention. The Marmont. which has produced
34,28502., and paid big dividends, has been optioned
to the Lake View and Oroya Exploration. The
Ingliston Consols syndicate is adding to its plant with
a view of increasing returns, and the adjoining Ingl’s-
ton Extended Co. has made arrangements for putting
up the output. At Garden Gully, 12 miles further
no’-th, the Kyarra Co. is busy with shaft sinking and
mill erection. The producing stage is expected to be
reached some time in November.

To date, £3,300.000 has been recovered by
amalgamation from Westralia’s State batteries, and
the revenue derived from treating residues brings the
total recovery up to close on £4,000,000. The
aggregate crushing capacity of the mills is 280,000
tons per annum, but only about one-fifth of this ton-
nage is at present being handled.
High Finance in Collins-street is rubbing
its eyes and asking, “What next?” Everything was
sailing along smoothly when a raging gale about the
brown coal deposits and the State electrification
scheme upset things. No one knows quite how long
Morwell leases have been shepherded, or when Croker
first got into Altona. But everyone knows that three
big German brown-coal experts came out under the
direction of a Collins-street crowd to measure up
Morwell, and that they folded up their tents and
moved off as silently as the Arabs in the desert.
What they reported isn’t known outside, but the
attempt to get a concession to run electric cables
along the Gippsland railway line from Morwell con-
veyed the warning that tile pitch was being pre-
pared for big things; and now one of the Germans
has returned, and the Melbourne Lignite Electric
Proprietary Co., Ltd., has been registered. This is to
take over the goods and chattels of the Victorian
Minerals Co., Ltd. If no one had queered the pitch
no doubt there would have been a pass on to a big
co., according to the ways of high finance. Mertz*i
return to tell Premier Watt what to do with the
electrification of the railways has pricked most of the
bubbles. He goes for brown-coal with a central
power station at Spottiswoode; but this, according to
the Cabinet, means that tenders are to be invited
from private suppliers of electricty for two other
stations. This was too thin for even the Argus,
so it thrust fusty ideas into the background, and
demanded that if there is to be national ownership
of the railways the source of power must be in the
hands of the State. In turn, the Age, having cut
down the gas monopoly, can’t logically build up an
electric one, so it has joined in the hunt. At which
High Finance wonders whether it has struck a land-
scape or an iceberg. Meanwhile, Labor looks at all
this as a step in the direction of nationalising the
coal deposits, for which it has battled for so long.
Duke Extended, Maryborough (Vic.), was
formed to pick up the Duke lead beyond where
it was left by the English crowd that took the
Duke United off Bill Baillieu’s hands when liis high-
est ambition was to make money out of Victorian
mines. Old Sam Body used to swear that the gutter
made to the north in a straight line from the Duke
boundary. Instead it curled away out of a big crab-
hole, and hasn’t been heard of since. Baring showed
that it ought to leave the lease to dip into the Duke
and Main leads claim. Bumpy ground was found
beyond the crab-hole, but no one is prepared to take
his oath that the big in-and-out workings of the Duke
United beyond the crab-hole were ever on the true
glitter. Long after Bull dropped the claim, and his
gilt at the same time, James McCrorey agreed to have
another cast for the lead. This first draw was a
failure. So he cast back to do more under level
work. The tally now is that bores reveal a gutter
450 ft. wide with a fair sample of gold from every
bore. Should the co. genuinely prove an extension
of the Duke lead in a well-defined gutter, it has more
that the usual mining hope to go on with, especially
if the lead is on a north and south course. A good
sign is that the quartz leaders have been cut in the
under-level.
“Ruat Coelum”: Victorian Central Coal
and Iron Mining Co., at Lai Lai (Vic.), has, so to
speak, blossomed forth in a prospectus after having,
in mixed metaphor, been in process of hatching for
several years. For two of those years the co. has
had an emissary in London, trying "to tap John Bull
for the ooftish wherewith to mine brown coal and
make iron by electricity, and, incidentally, to sup-
ply electric power to a formidable list of towns as
far as 50 miles away. The mine was worked for
brown coal 25 years ago, by shafts and drives, all of
which are now full of water. The prospectus’ author
seems to think the mine can be worked by open cut,
or inclined shaft, or by tunnels. Also, the coal
might be raised by suction through an iron cylinder,
or it might be blown up to the surface by forcing
compressed air through tubes sunk in the lignite-
or a better way to raise it would be to treat it like
petroleum, and sink (say) to 5000ft.,* and wait till the
fine, brown coal was driven into the air by the
artesian water, just like an oil “gusher” in Pennsyl-
vania. And these three proposals, like those in the
prospectus, are chiefly rubbish. So is the suggestion
that iron can be made cheaply by electricity. This
new practice has been well tried in the Cold Country,
and entirely abandoned, because of its excessive
cost. The open hearth furnace still holds its ground
as the cheapest and most satisfactory method of
making pig-iron, and it is, merely silly to suggest
that brown coal can be raised at such a low cost at
Lai Lai as to generate electricity as cheaply as by
water-power in Sweden. Besides, the centre of the
coal lease is three miles on the plan from the
ancient pits of iron ore, so that a tramway
must be made, either to take the coal to
the iron, or the iron to the coal, both of which
will cost money. The present issue of 35,000 shares
at 2s„ will, at the outside, only produce £3500
which won’t go very far towards carrying out even
one of the four objects of the co.—-wh'ch are the
supply of power, smelting of iron, making briquettes
and making bricks and pottery. In fact, it will only
go _ far enough to get a proper report on the am-
bitious scheme outlined by the prospectus, from some
competent German chemist who understands brown
coal and its value. There is no lignite mine worked
in England, and, therefore, there is no English en-
gineer who can handle a big lignite project like this
at Lai Lai. The main value and interest of the Vic-
torian Central Co.’s prospectus lies in the fact that
C. H. Merz has brought under notice the obvious
fact that in its brown coal deposits, covering hun-
dreds of square miles, Victoria has an asset of more
than enormous value. There are billions of tons of
brown coal to be used as fuel, and it will take mil-
lions sovereigns to shift the goods.
Central Red, White and Blue, Bendigo,
has paid out another 20s. on account of gold being
got in the western side of the formation to the north
at 318 ft. Co. has already touched the £90,000
dividend mark, as the result of two years’ work, thus
showing that there is still some good stuff left in the
reefs of the Golden City. A lot is now being made
of the fact that Lansell’s Little 180, next door, has
been stacking up profits for the owners out of the
same run of stone, but the level on the eastern side
of the Central Blue, at 318 ft., didn’t disclose anything
phenomenal. It was only when a crosscut went into
the spurs on the eastern side that better stone was
got, and, as one man puts it, “the saddle presented a
more expansive appearance.” The distance to the
Little 180 boundary is 500 ft., and a lot can happen
in that distance, as has already been proved on several
occasions in the present workings of the mine. The
iaws of the office, which had ben hanging lower and
lower since the battery got go ; ng, have tightened
wonderfully since the crosscut went out.
Tin is quoted in London at £224 per ton
(22401 b.), which is exactly 2s. per lb., and black
tin oxide is quoted at 395. 6d. per unit in Sydney.
At that rate 70 p.c. is worth £l3B ss. per ton. A
large proportion of alluvial tin assays from 70 to 74
p.c. pure tin, so the Briseis, of Tasmania (alluvial),
with an output of 45 tons of black oxide per month,
is able to declare a 6d. ( £15,000), making the total
dividends 12s. 3d. per share ( £367,500). Briseis
has 600,000 shares, so it goes without saying that
the profit on 600 tons ‘ of black tin—rather more
than the annual output—must be very high to pay
two or three 6d. dividends a year. This year Is. per
share has been declared, and a total distribution of
Is. 6d. per share (£45,000) is expected. The in-
creased gold yield is a heln, still Briseis has a fleet
of dredges to keep in repair, which takes some
of the gilt off. During August the Wallace dredging
area yielded 6790 z. of gold from 132,800 cubic
yards. The previous yields were: July, 9480 z. ; June.
8650 z. ; May, 7830 z. This dredging property was
acquired in 1909, and has become the most pro-
ductive in Victoria (32750 z. in four months). There
are 2112 acres on Yackandandah and Sandy Creeks
(N.E. Victoria). Property was purchased for
£60,000, some of which is payable out of profits or
alternatively out of anything over 2d. per cub. yard.

For 12 weeks to September 4, Mount
Lvell (Tas.) smelted 74,296 tons of ore for 1568 tons
ol blister, containing 1550 tons of copper, 101,1070 z.
silver, and 19970 z. of gold. Average, 2.08 p.e. cop-
per, 1.360 z. silver, 14 grains gold. Precious metals
are worth, approximately, 6s. per ton of ore, so
Lyell cannot expect salvation from that source if the
base metal declines to a low price again. It will
take Lyell all its time to produce 3500 tons of copper
this half-year (ending September 30), for up to Sep-
tember 4 the total was 2867 tons. At the mines the
heavy weather has interfered with open-cut work,
and the mullock for refilling depleted stopes has been
in short supply. Boring northwards in search of ore
extending into the Comstock lease, has not so far re-
sulted in any important discovery, but when the
ground floor at the north end of the 1100 ft. level is
enlarged diamond drill work will be resumed, with a
better chance of success. There are over 900,000
tons of ore blocked out in the North Lyell, and a very
much larger quantity of low-grade fluxing ore in the
parent mine.
Winton (Q.) reports another opal find
at Britcher’s Creek, on the dusty track which leads
to far-out Boulia. The report is good, as all first
reports are. The opaliferous district in Western
Bananaland, like the sapphire country further east,
has had a big struggle to live. Opal output to date
is estimated at £169,500, but no one can live on
“output to date” any more than the mill can grind
wheat with the water that has passed to date. And
current output is none too gorgeous.

The great advance made in the construction of In-
ternal Combustion Engines has now been further
demonstrated by the fact of Petrol, Benzine, Kero-
sene and heavy Oil Locomotives being brought into
daily and successful commercial use. The machines
are thoroughly reliable, and are cheaper in very
many instances than steam or electric locomotives.
Messrs. Ironside, Son and Dvckerhoff, of London,
have supplied a great number of their famous “New
Century” locomotives nearly all over the world, and
their machines are even working continuously and
safely in “gassy” coal mines. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne, will be pleased to supply further par-
ticulars.*

In all smithing work high-class iron can be more
safely manipulated at varying temperatures than
steel or ordinary iron. It is for this reason that
Best Yorkshire Farnley Iron is preferred by engi-
neers, where toughness, .great strength and close
grain are needed. Whatever the specification, Iron
of the Farnley type does not vary, but is simply the
best that can be produced from what is really
wrought iron. “Farnley” Bars of all sections sup-

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and say
u the ITardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, September 23, 1912.
My Dear Arini. —
That dark-eyed, white-toothed young Miss,
the unmarried bud of the Mat Harris
family, is engaged. She’s going to give her
hand, and her flashing smile, and a snug
marriage portion, to one Rupert Cox, form-
erly of Melbourne. He has shifted his
moorings to this port. Ijptham, the large,
square-shouldered mansion that eyes the
rising sun from Darling Point (once the
Mitchell homestead, but now the property
of Knight Mat Harris), is said to be in-
cluded in the Ruby Harris dower.
An Australian in Kaiser-land sends a few
aeroplane remarks, which are hereby boiled
down and passed to you: “Invited for a
three-hours’ flight in the Zeppelin airship,
‘Victoria Louise.’ Left Hamburg early
in the morning. The huge machine fled
through the air to Kiel at the rate of SO
miles an hour —or less—to see the opening
of the regatta. A lovely sensation, accentu-
ated by sitting in cane armchairs in a long
observation car. Washed down our flight
with champagne and nibbled caviare sand-
wiches. over Kiel Harbor about 11
a.m. Saw the Kaiser standing on the deck of
his yacht, the Hohenzollern, waving his cap
to our airship. We sent him a postcard per
aerial post. This consists of a small oilskin
bag attached to a long streamer with the
German colors, which is dropped from the
airship, and generally finds its destination.
Hamburg, a lovely town rather like Syd-
ney, with a fine harbor and beautiful homes
scattered about its shores.”
Kirkb.v Lunn is steadily luring the multi-
tude to listen to her siren song. Saturday
night’s concert only left a few vacant chairs
tor the nipping draughts (a Town Hall
specialty) to whiz round, while Arthur
Mason, at the organ, plunged into the
National Anthem with his hands and feet.
Necks were twisted in search of Governors
or wandering Helps, but the only suite in
sight was upholstered in cretonne, and
stowed away in the Northern Gallery. It
was obviously to let. Plainly, the organist
had got away before the starter’s signal.
The' voice of the Chamberlain rounding
up his flock in the corridor then trickled
through the chinks in the gallery doors, and
the Denmans made a wary descent to their
P] a teau ; The organ bellowed a double dose
of God Save,” and the multitude broke out
111 joyful greeting to the G.-G., smacking its
hands and[ . stamping the soles of its shoe
leather. Since. the days of the Rawsons,
who were on friendly terms with every man,
woman and dog in the street, Sydney audi-
ences have turned a languid eye towards
the vice-regal perch at local concerts. So the
Gee-Gee, who blushed like a pale pink radish
over the edge of the balcony, had solid
reasons for looking as if he liked the fuss.
Arthur Mason, with a Bach “Fugue in G
Minor,” and a dreamy lullaby by himself.
“A Venetian Serenade” (a charming trifle),
got the municipal organ again on the trail.
Fiddler Ribaupierre and pianist Laur-
ence Phillip collaborated in Schumann’s
“Sonata in A Major” (all the majors and
minors seemed to be out on the spree the
other night). The mournful baritone,
Andrew Shanks carolled “O Star of Eve ’’
and William Murdoch had his fling at the
piano with three Chopin studies before the
siren Kirkby Lunn allowed her matchless
contralto to float across the hall. Her
breathing is one of the small miracles of her
art. It must occur somewhere. But neither
the longest phrase in the “Delilah” aria, the
subtle changes in two songs by Brahms, nor
any other perfect. sample of her vocal craft,
the other night, hinted at a breathing appar-
atus under the delicate bodice of veiled apri-
cot satin.
About the most picturesquely dressed
young man in this city is Fred "Niblo (of
Noo Yark), the Wallingford of the “Get-
Rick-Quick” co. The creases of his trouser-
legs are absolutely distracting in their beauty
and mathematical accuracy. His satin-
lined coats open over waistcoats that reduce
the wearer of domestic architecture, i.e., the
huckback chest-protector, to a state of
green-eyed frenzy. Before the beautiful
Aibio came to town the silver-gilt youths of
these parts looked half-choked by their new
neckwear, which is after the fashion of a
modified Beau Brummel stock. It rode
up over their collar-fences and backed into
their noble necks. See Niblo’s high stock-
cravat with one small jewel flashing in the
centre as he saunters into a fashionable
hostel. Then die, or get out of the clothes-
horse business.
Mrs. G. Kellick. who is a sort of compo-
site mother, grandmother and great-aunt to
the E resh Air League, attended its 21st
birthday greeting last week. She was in the
first lighting rank when it first struck the
golden idea of hurrying the sick worker from
the overcrowded city tenement house to green
paddocks where the lamb frisks near the
mint, and so on. The Fresh Air League has
various strenuous “stickers” on its com-
mittee, who will only be removed by Death
from service to the Cause. Mrs. Ernest
Broughton, Miss McCarthy and a few others
of the same fibre who belong to the original
Fresh Airers, were very firm in their accus-
tomed places when the Chelmsford lady sat
in the 21st meeting chair.
The last American mail brought the glad
news that Mrs. Hugh Ward was staying
under the domestic tile of the Bert Lews in
N’York.
Concerning the Gale comet, which walks
the evening sky in the direction of the
Southern Cross, I hear that comet-catching
used to be a recognised industry in the U.S.
Prof. Barnard built himself a large house in
Tennessee out of the proceeds of fishing with
a telescope for new stars with fluffy little
fails. He had a lot of luck, and got about
£4O (not dollars) for each stray he trapped
with the glass. Other astral-fishers in the
U.S. as elsewhere have been less lucky,
many, indeed, having caught nothing more
merchantable than sneezes.
Miss Rose Scott, who might be a militant
suffragette in the Old Land, if she weren’t
a Peace Society enthusiast in this, sends me
a letter from the National Union of Women’s
Suffrage societies (London). This docu-
ment deals agitatedly with the damage that
the incendiary, and the window-smasher, and
the hat-bashing brand of lady vote-chaser is
doing the cause. A codicil earmarks the
three groups of women’s franchise support-
ers in the House ,of Commons. These are
the Conservatives, who would fling a grudg-
ing measure of approval to ladies who owned
something in their own right. Secondly, the
adult suffrage M.P. (rather scarce), who
distributes his benediction on every petticoat
in pursuit of the balUt-box. The Norwegian
franchise is the last log in the track. Its
supporters would (with many mental reser-
vations), hand women householders, and the
legal proprietors of male householders, the
v ote. _ Lloyd George and Sir Edward Grey
are said to be biting gently at the “Nor-
wegian” compromise. Lastly, the “National
Union,” of which Mrs. Fawcett, LL.D., is
top lady, hungers for Australian news re
the nerve-racking theme—one woman, one
vote.
The Australian wild flower rally bursts
into bud at the Town Hall as this meets
your long-distance gaze, Arini. The Chelms-
ford dame is billed to tear it open with a
few botanical remarks. But the joy of
addressing the lilly-pilly by its fancy name,
Eugenia Smithii,” or bounding up to some
other humble herb to stroke its back and
call it “Darwinia fascicularis” can be yours
or mine without paving extra gate money.
There seems to be no patent remedy to
exorcise the small child (usually overdressed
to the verge of physical anguish), swelling
with importance behind a presentation bou-
quet. This species haunts every charity
show, and sidles up to the victim (generally
the wife of a Governor, Admiral or Mayor)
and hurriedly butts her with a heavy floral
trophy. At the recent garden bazaar in the
grounds of the Justice Pring domicile (Stan-
more) a male infant made the expected rush
at the vice-regal She, and dashed a bunch
of flowers into her firm right hand. Some
day the promoter of a raid for charity’s
sake will try the effect of a bold advt. to
say that the sale of socks will open itself, that
there will be no presentation marigolds, and
that any person who thirsts for a platform
appearance at the tender age of eight, nine
or 10 vears, will be briskly spanked in a tent
set apart for that purpose.
Placards of invitation are “out” for the
opening of the new Zoo, Athol Bight, where
hot water may be obtained by incorrigible
picnickers free of cost, or less, all the year
round. October 14 is the date of the Lion
and Tiger display.
The Tony Horderns will give a decorative
private hop under their own roof during the
October blizzard of festivities, likewise the
Jim Fairfaxes and the Sep. Levys. The
private dance is getting back into its old
niche under the domestic shingle, and the
average charity ball wears a distressful
countenance in consequence.
Two youthful visitors at State Govern-
ment House are the Hon. Margaret Best
and Miss Lees, sister of the little A.D.C. of
that name. Best is the tame or household
nomenclature of the Wynford familv which
is not old enough to turn blue-mouldy on its
ancestral tree. The first Baron (1824)
dabbled in law as Justice of Common Pleas,
and the sixth Baron Wynford is the parent
of the Chelmsford’s overseas guest. The
Hon. Samuel John, who’ll probably climb
under the present lord’s coronet later on,
follows the useful trade of growing tea-
leaves in Ceylon.
The Chelmsford’s garden party on October
10 will be their principal votive offering to
the stern, insistent demand of the well-to-do
for free entertainment during the week of the
Horse.
The Spencer Bruntons, when the last mail
left England, were dashing through Siberia
and other agitating patches in red Russia.
The recent amateur revival of “School” re-
minds me that Robertson wrote this comedy
in 1869, as contemporary matter. In the
Victoria Barracks production the male stars
got into the garb of the late ’3o’s and mid
’4o’s, and were, therefore, about 30 vears
older than they had any right to* be.
“Naomi” (the linotype tripped over this
name last week) is the sparkling type of
soubrette part the modern dramatist seems
to have mislaid.
Miss Grant Bruce (of the Melbourne
Age), the vivacious writer of bush stories
for the young child, is snatching a holiday
in this town.
Which branch of the numerous (Sydney)
Manning clan owns Mrs. Harold Manning
and the Misses Manning, I wonder? Any-
how, they’re billed as settled down in Paris to
study art and music for some time. This
sounds a large order, but perhaps they’ll
work it out in heats, with an hon. referee
to act as umpire.
“Agnes Storrie” (Mrs. Ivettlewell), the
well-known writer of melodious verse, is
dropping her locum tenens pen for the Syd-
ney end of The Australasian this week.
While, the usual nib was careering over the
face of the globe, “Agnes Storrie” draped the
banal dress report with a few literary frills
which that dreary topic doesn’t usually get.
Percy Hunter, N.S.W.’s tireless globe and
immigrant hustler, is pushing Continental
languages into his youthful offspring, at the
rate of 70 miles an hour or thereabouts.
After spending a strenuous time, intellectu-
ally speaking, in Berlin (under the eye of
their mamma), the two boys are now taking
a header into French verbs in Paris. Ru-
mors reach me of a brief breather devoted
to tearing across the French map, from Bou-
logne to Normandy, on rubber-tyres, but, re-
calling the furious earnestness and work-
hunger of the family, I discount them by
60 per cent., or more.
Mrs. Langloh Want, who’s one of the
amateur cast in the “Importance of Being
Earnest,” has some stage experience to back
up her performance for the “Ministering
Children’s” League. As Miss Newton, she
toiled for a while in legitimate drama. By
the way, it was her brother, a former
Chelmsford A.D.C., who married Miss Kath-
leen Verney. October 2 is the date of the
impending flurry in pursuit of the nimble
charity shilling.
Woman, plain and fancy, is beginning to
make herself a public and uproarious nuis-
ance at political and other meetings in this
city. Even the country mouse, since the
franchise drove her into the murky atmo-
sphere of politics, is often reported as a
persistent interjector. The practise of in-
sulting inoffensive word-spinners has long
been the privilege of the male barracker,
and he is welcome to it.
Society sent very few of its members tc
the Town Hall, when the meeting on the
vexed question “To go —-or not to go” was
torn limb from limb. But the plain citi-
zeness, getting her back up and her temper
on end, was the chief offender in the matter
of howling down Minister Beeby. Granted
that he was self-invited, and even allowing
a wide margin for the excitement of the
moment, he had a right to a hearing. Mayor
Clarke saw the tactical blunder of howling
down a Speaker who had the courage to
address a furiously hostile gathering of
rather less than 4000 persons. That’s the
Town Hall limit when it’s jambed to the
doors, but it lacked the squeeze, and showed
vacant chairs in spots of space. It was the
shrill treble of the noisy women in the body
of the hall which led the 'uproar. If the
woman’s vote is going to create a shrieking
sisterhood, who defy the ruling of a just
chairman (witness the frantic efforts of
Mayor Clarke, the other night) and “down”
an opposition speaker, so much the worse for
the woman movement.
Invitations are out for an Australian
Club Ball on the Bth October. Also, a num-
ber of bachelors, mostly members of the
Macquarie-street edifice, have asked their
friends to dance and eat at a tea-room about
the same time.
The M.L. Government is going to make a
bold advt. of its wares in this city as this
reaches you. Dominion Day (September
26) will be celebrated in the local M.L.
Tourist Agency from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Business men only are invited. They’ll put
their commercial wits into Maoriland decor-
ations, indigenous to the soil. If they put
their knives and forks into anything edible
it will bear the M.L. cheese or butter brand.
As a mild house-warming or something of
the kind, for the youthful visitors, Misses
Best and Lees, a small dance will shake the
rafters of State Government House before
this letter greets you. A chaperon or two
may have been inserted into the proceedings,
but young men and maidens will chiefly
frolic under the vice-regal eye.
Oswald Anderson has written some tune-
ful music for “Two Short Songs.” The
words are adapted from the Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam. They side-step the lover
in “Love’s Wish,” and twine a graceful
melody round “Regret,” F. R. Hedges
shakes his lutfe on the old theme, “Sigh no
more, ladies,” from “Much Ado About No-
thing.” He makes more ado about some-
thing with a brisk accompaniment. Still
another song-march. “The Australian
Cadets,” by Robert P. Thomson, ought to
convince those khaki saplings that, if they
don’t grow into sturdy limbs of Defence,
this nation will inquire the reason why.
Palings are responsible for this rush of home-
made music.
That sunbaked elongation of six feet fouv-
and-a-half inches, Broome Smith, F.R.G.S!,
unloaded some good material at the Town
Hall last week. Traveller Smith, however,
has none of the instincts of a showman. He
recklessly gave away, beforehand, in columns
of press interviews, the heart of his African
story. Having read with starting eyes, for
one penny, the details of High Life in
Pigmy Land, and the daring deeds of gav
young bloods in Ashanti, that portion of the
public which likes to sip its adventures
through a fireside straw, stayed at home on
the lecture night. Most of the lantern slides
were new, and 28 years in the land of ivory,
rubber and witchcraft made a solid joint of
meat. But the prime cuts had been given
away—and very few citizens wanted a
second help at two or three shillings a head.
Prof. David presided over an aching void of
empty “reserved” seats. Under cover of the
twilight gloom, while the cannibal gentry
were floating across the screen, the back
seat holders were beckoned to the front.
They made a joyous stampede and helped to
take the chill off the lonely heathen troglo-
dites on the desert of white sheet.
Mosman, assisted by Neutral Bay and
North Sydney, held its sixth annual ball in
aid. of. the Mater Misericordiae Hospital,
which is located in the vicinity of Crow’s
Nest, North Sydney. Warringah Hall.
Neutral Bay, was the scene of the
revel, and the gentle Lady Mayoress lent
her aid. Fancy sets and individual fancy
costumes were the evening’s attraction for
the onlookers. There were dainty and
demure 1830 crinolined damsels, who con-
trasted strongly with a tribe of aboriginals
and their piccaninnies and lubras. There
were Esquimaux with sleds and a tame Polar
bear; semi-barbaric Valkyries with flowing
hair and golden armor, and girls in half-and-
half costumes of black and white. Also,
there was a highly original set, labelled
Daily News. Familiar caricatures of our
great morning dailies, closely followed bv
the Speaker and his Sergeant at Arms, led
a procession of 24. In their wake came
Shipping, Sport, Billiards, Counter Lunch
(a Domain resident bearing a tray of coun-
ter delicacies and a dipper of foaming beer).
Music (with her miniature piano) and
Gilded Finance, her gown jingling with coin
of the realm. The Gas Bill was very pro-
minent, in the shape of a stork-like birl with
an enormous bill and flashing orbs. He paid
marked attention to the Baby Bonus, and
seemed on very good terms with a leg-ironed
Chidley labelled “Dangerous.” An evicted
Governor-General, in his cocked hat, looked
rather dejected as he grasped his luggage in
one hand and some camping-out utensils in
the other. The Law, Military, Advertise-
ments, Amusements, Strikes (represented by
a red-bordered white skirt with a matchbox
corsage) were there, too. Only the Church
was missing. Perhaps its stipend was not
up to a night out such as this. A real live
baronet appeared as a “Woman of No Im-
portance,” and another was disguised in the
garb of a gentleman of the 20th century.
.The forthcoming dance on H.M.S. Drake
will be the last of its kind on any British
naval flagship in these waters. After the
final quack on the Drake (which soon steams
away to the grey North-land) the Aus-
tralian squadron will sit down at this end
of the fighting line.
The ball at Federal Government House
on October 4 is another final or
dead finish. For the sound of packing up is
heard in the land, and the Governor-Gen-
eral’s luggage is ready for the Great De-
parture from N.S.W.
Sincerely yours,
VANDORLAN.
A suburban judgment and some reflections
thereon, xl fair young bride, whose husband
is not rich, recently set up housekeeping in
a “good” suburb. She had to do her own
housework; but there wasn’t much of it,
and, being a dainty girl, she didn’t see why
she would make herself a disordered appar-
ition in the process. So she designed a
pretty dusting cap with ribbons to protect
her hair, and did the job nicely and just as
effectively as any ramshackle and maudlin
charlady. Some curl-papered and dressing-
gowned cats saw the vision going about her
household duties, hurriedly convened a back-
fence meeting, and came to the conclusion
there could be no marriage lines in the little
establishment—all on the evidence of the
pretty dusting cap. According to their way
of looking at it, matrimony is inseparable
from awful flannel wrappers, haystack coif-
fures, and the morning air of dilapidation
that shatters a bridegroom’s illusions and
makes watchful bachelors fear the altar as
they do the scaffold. So once more Frowsi-
ness is placed second to Holiness in Life’s
handicap. Between the unbrushed suburban
cats and the anti-ocean Wowser who stands
on the beach and waves a threatening brolly
at the Sunday surf, Cleanliness gets a very
poor run for the money it expends on soap,
ribbons and bathing dresses.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 23, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Rather unexpectedly, the G.-G. attended
the Gaud Mayor’s dance in most of his offi-
cial haberdashery and wearily trod a cere-
monious measure with the Gaudess, while
State Governor Fuller pranced gaily with the
black-clad lady of Admiral Creswell. The
Gaudess was amazingly maize-colored, with
gold threads in old lace and a purple sash.
The Fuller lady, fair and daring, wore a
brilliant pink-red sal,in with a tiara flashing
like an electric sky-sign. The Forrest dame
trailed wattle-yellow garments from neck to
toe and her private roof regalia. There were
no flies, crows or vultures on this function.
At 10 o’clock, the hour of the official step-
ping, a great buzz of anticipation went up ;
but it was the buzz of a swarm of honey-
laden bees. Supper was strewn in various
parts of the building, and the new dining-
room of the adjacent coffee palace was also
utilised, in order that the famishing would
have plenty of room to charge. Every avail-
able corner of the furbished and brilliantly-
lit Town Hall was made available for sit-
ters-out and card players so, though there
were 3000 in the building, there was a
reasonable amount of elbow room for every-
one.
The frocking was unusually good and fre-
quently heavily jewelled. Mrs. Edwin
Miller had emeralds and rubies in the em-
broidery of her black ninon. Mrs. Ross-
Soden positively clattered with pearl and
crystal fringe. Mrs. Mayoress Wilks, of
vice-regal Malvern, wore a gold-embroid-
ered tunic over her white dress; and Mrs.
Frazer, wife of the M.H.R., sported crystal
diamond hangings on her grey ninon gown.
Lesly Madden glittered and gleamed in a
black satin upholstered with jet; she pro-
vided a sombre contrast to Mrs. Geoffrey
Syme (just out from nursing her burglar-
mauled husband), who wore a coat woven
of pearls and lace over a dress draped in
ivory chiffon folds. The blue Chinese tunic
and trousers of the daintily-tinted wife of
the Consul-General struck the only quiet
dress note in the whole dazzling pageant.
During his visit to Melbourne, last week,
the spruce little G.-G. left the motors at
home and actually walked up C.ollins-street
on his own feet, with his blue suit unpro-
tected by overcoat or umbrella. Help Bart-
telot striding alongside was enveloped in a
checked blanket great coat, and bore an
umbrella to keep the witches off. But, then,
Barttelot is, comparatively speaking, com-
mon clay and possesses none of the divinity
which fences off a viceroy. All the same, if
it had commenced to rain, he would probably
have had to deliver up the umbrdlla or be
indicted on a charge of high treason.
The uproarious doings at the last night of
the Glaciarium are leaking out in cautious
whispers. Ten o’clock or 10.30 is the usual
hour for closing; but, for the final session,
the management generously allowed the
skaters to glide till one hour before mid-
night. When time was officially up, the
gong clanged loudly and attendants started
to shoo patrons off the ice. But manv of
them glided on defiantly. Once again' the
attendants implored them to desist and go
home. But they went smilingly on their
way, and appeared not to hear. Then said
the manager, “Hose the ice!” The hose was
run out; but before it had time to fill, fiend-
ish skaters cut it to pieces with their foot-
irons. Another hose was brought into play,
and began to splash ominously. Some of the
revellers put on macintoshes and skated
gaily through the spray. Suddenly a young
cadet of the Very Best order seized the
hose and turned it on the man who was
using it. The attendant fell and slid along
the ice under the force of the jet. Another
attendant grabbed the nozzle and turned the
stream on the cadet, who struggled and
fought to. regain possession of the weapon.
When he got it, he mischievously turned it
'on the watchers. Squeals and sobs of rage
went up from the previously merry specta-
tors, as the flying water, splashed and dam-
aged frocks and furs. Waterproofed police
finally restored sobriety and decorum. But it
is beyond the power of O’Callaghan’s force
to restore the ruined garments.
Some Hawthornites, bazaar-bent, are re-
hearsing. for a Pierrot performance in the
garden-girt hall which is affectionately
known as “the Kew Rec.” A man per-
former evaded the little co. the other day,
and his place is to be filled bv Colonel Bal-
lenger’s smart little sporting daughter. She
made such. a success-of her donkey-boy dress
at the “Kismet” dance that she has ceased
to feel truly happy in skirts.
A gnashing of cashboxes seems to follow
every charity entertainment which is at-
tended by society. The Best People buy
and sell tickets with a light heart, and then
often forget to forward the cheque to the
harassed treasurer. Thereupon the treasurer
resorts to every known polite device to jog
their memories. Lesly Madden, who looked
after the financial part of “The Cassilis
Engagement.” and Mrs. Jolley, cashboxer of
the Girls Training Home dance, are both
bothered at. present over this troublesome
part of their duties. It isn’t exactly bad-
debt collecting, and yet, in some respects, it
is worse than bad-debt collecting. And
worse than bad can only be described as
rotten.
Funds for the Babies’ Home are now
being chased by the Very Nicest people. Mrs.
Albert Miller’s Whernside f§te—due next
month—is at present being prepared for at
top speed. The secretary enlivened, the last
meeting by bursting forth in a cherry-red
hat and a blue dress from the interior of her
cherry-red and blue motor. In stage circles
it would have been described as “a splendid
entrance.”
The Melbourne Hunt Club escaped the
floods by a few days for the last run of
the season at Clyde, down towards the coast
swamp-lands; but the members had to gal-
lop through the preliminary showers of the
v ictorian Deluge. An early morning special
train carried a load of pink-coated men, but
only three of the hatpin sex —a McCullagh
Miss, from Woodlands, Miss Raleigh and
Miss Creswick. Locally the sporting Duffy
girls joined the adventurers, together with
Mrs. Bullock. Jack Baillieu, carrying a
stiff arm from a recent spill, cut out the
fences. Jim Osborne galloped with the best;
and the women of the district, preferring the
comfort of carriages to the saddle, whipped
up a tea party for the drenched sports-
women within coo-ee of the return train,
bnc Maxon, of the “Ben Hur” co., attended
the function in dandy attire, and was con-
spicuously ornamental at the refreshment
rendezvous.
This year the Wesley College Old Boys
are going to have a fancy-dress procession of
past and present students, as well as the
usual garden party and cricket match. The
gay pageant (it is determined to be gay)
will go round a large square that takes in
Chapel-street. It is said that the function
wnl mildly emulate the annual procession
of University students.
The annual kick-up of the Ilyams’ pupils,
which has been converted from a “ball”
into a “dance,” will happen (d.v). at St.
Hilda Town Hall on Tuesday, October 8. Of
fate years, the Hyams event has rarely or
never come to pass in the Gaud Mayor’s
municipal barn, as of yore. The frisky
suburb-by-the-sea has a somewhat larger
hall, with less draughtiness on the premises
than the place where the pneumonia comes
from.
Major-General Kirkpatrick’s lady has
strewn invitations amongst the nicest moth-
ers tor a garden treasure hunt on Thursday
ot this week If any unlucky infant chances
to exhume the forgotten victim of some rat-
trap tragedy, loud roars of indignation will
make the welkin ring and necessitate heavy
bribes of mdigestibles and inflated drinks.
Ihe treasure-hunt idea has its dangers.
In spite of the hostile elements of last
Ihursday night, a full Town Hall audience
gathered to hear Bostonian Bliss Knap talk
Christian Science—the creed which invites
,you t0 m Call yourself a liar every five min-
utes. The .audience came and went in a
nianner which bespoke the free show of no
particular grip. Pig-tailed misses and wild
Salvationists were numerous ; but the audible
words of the lecturer were few and far be-
tween, owing to the dry rattle of coughs
and incessant shuffling of feet. When Bliss
subsided in a sad way, there was a frantic
stampede to evade the suspected collection
plate. lam not quite clear if Christian
Science has ever managed to cure itself of
the terrible collection plate habit; but the
audience seemed disinclined to give it the
benefit of the doubt.
The Wattle Leaguers finished off last
week with a tea and bun outburst at the
Alexandra Club. Mrs. Geelong Watt did
the talking for Dame Staughton, who was
occupied with an attack of pleurisy. The
Fuller lady is to be asked to patronise the
next raid on the suffering golden groves.
•Tack McComas, who married a Geelong
heiress, a few weeks ago, nearly converted
Ins bride into a widow, during the honey-
moon among the snows of rugged Buffalo/l
forget just what death he escaped from, but
it was very thrilling. The two are now
safety and happily flatkeeping in a Mel-
bourne pile which is composed of lavers of
homes.
Dr. Mary Booth is back again in Mel-
bourne, looking much better for her health
trio to sunny Bananaland, where the winter
is more or less of a jest.
Miss Maggie Maguire is the latest recruit
to the Bush Nursing corps. She hails from
the comparatively urban Goulburn Valley,
where miles of river frontage are neatly
divided into smiling orchards, and neighbor-
bors yarn to one another over the fences.
And she has gone to work at Buchan, in the
richest and least accessible part of rugged
GiP’-'sland.
Talking of nurses—Miss lima Toomath,
who matroned the Foundling Hospital at
Last Melbourne for two or three years, has
put her quaintly pretty name on her own
biass plate. Weary of well-doing for mere
wages, she lately took over a private hospi-
tal at Malvern from the Bevan sisters. The
name, of Toomath is associated, thereabouts,
with the cure of souls, as well as cure of
bodies. Miss Ilma’s father, the Rev. An-
drew, abides at Armadale these times. He
is said to be “one of the oldest Anglican
parsons living”—which means, presumably,
living in Australia. In England there are
country vicars who have lived the simple
life for ages and ages, with a repertoire of
three or four time-honored sermons which
they mumble in turn to their drowsy flocks,
on the rare occasions when the curate gets
a holiday. The very oldest Anglican clergy-
men have achieved their antiquity under
good old English conditions, I take it. This
country is not the best on earth for them.
The Norman Brookes baby began her
social career early by inviting most of those
who attended her parents’ wedding, two
years ago, to roll up and see her christened.
Norman Bayles, of the butterfly moustache,
played godfather, and the sedate Wrixon
lady solemnly undertook the duties and re-
sponsibilities of godmother along with Mrs.
Charles Emmerton. Little Cynthia masquer-
aded in her mother’s wedding veil. For the
subsequent feast, a layer of the wedding cake
was re-iced and served up. Amongst those
who trailed expensive clothes round the
house were Dalrymples, Dunbar Hoopers,
McKinnons, Millers, Fiskens and Fairbairns.
Ivy Clarke’s fashionable tailorings ran a
neck-to-neck race with the smart Parisian
garments of Gladys Chirnside, just back
from the Continental chiffon stores. The
adoring mother hung over the cooing new-
comer in a lace dress, ermine furs and a top-
dressing of the inevitable ostrich plumes. A
social gathering these days makes one’s
heart bleed for the unfurnished fowls that
must rush round the feather farms.
Wal hice, orphan daughter of the
Wallaces of Ballarat, came to Melbourne
last week to marry Victor Ilyndman. Sister
Mrs. Unwin Taylor, wife of the medico,
spread the marriage feast at the Grand
Hotel, and brother-in-law handed over the
very dainty bride to her happy man. Two
cloud-grey and sky-blue bridesmaids hovered
prettily in the rear whilst Canon Gason
(what an ominous name!), of St. John’s,
blessed the pairing. When the bride put on

Rupert Kiddle, a tall, thin, warrior-squat-

as bridegroom at a very quiet wedding last
week. Ethel, daughter of the C. .T. Ham

®y the Remuera, which foamed through
Hobart waters the other day, the Arthur
Rhodes family returned to Maoriland, after
having swallowed their share of London fog
and left a son in the Grenadier Guards. The
Rhodes pair inhabited G.-G. Denman’s
London house for some time, while their
Maoriland mansion was occupied by Gov-
ernor Islington and his wife.
A smart matron, who is noted for her
musical parties, has a glittering series of re-
ception rooms, half-curtained off from one
another and full of Venetian mirrors. The
other day, while her guests were listening
more or less to a piano rhapsody, a beaury
girl who had arrived late was observed out-
side, rehearsing her entrance against tlm
time when the music should stop. The fatal
mirrors passed on the joke to those inside,
and shrieks of merriment were stifled with
cambric as the unconscious one smiled and
smirked and bowed to herself. At last the
Rubinstein riot stopped, and the artless
maiden floated in wearing her most demure
air. She appeared to be extremely gratified
with the general smile of welcome with
which she was received.
A leading light or gas buoy in the
Women’s National League has struck con-

by suddenly retiring into private life. Her
children are stated to »eed a mother’s care;
but as the family in question is a very well-
grown one, dear friends are busily emploved
seeking another reason for the dame’s sudden
loss of political enthusiasm.

A superior but unmusical person, who
finds it necessary for official reasons to sit
out many lengthy concerts, has found a way
to dissipate the awful tedium. He goes
armed to the uproar with a pair of powerful
glasses, and, when he has finished taking
observations of the platform star, carefully
searches the auditorium for the Prettiest

blush to the cheek of any competitor, he
only stares harder.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Every other woman wore a coat and skirt at the
Fort Adelaide Racing Club meeting on Saturday, for
the week had wound up with a damp curse arid a
meteorological howl, and the sporting of chiffons
would have been equivalent to a demand for pneu-
monia. Mrs. Rasp, Mrs. Herbert Rymill and Miss
Gardiner; Mrs. Hyland and Mrs. Jervois were amongst
the female enthusiasts present.
The G.-G. and several M’s.P. left us on Monday,
after a trifle of spade work at Port Augusta. The
latter township, by the way, is a rather pathetic
spectacle. It was expected to Boom, in no uncertain
fashion. And so the State sowed wharves and massive
public buildings, banks and churches all over it, and
then sat back and waited for the profits to come up.
They never did. On the contrary, Port Pirie came
with a rush, and knocked Augusta’s hopes out with
one .relentless punch. For years now it has been a
wilting place, filled with relics of great and awful
failed expectations. Maybe, with the arrival of the
transcontinental, its luck is due to turn.
By the way, G.-G., Denman mentioned, while he
was here, that he would come back in the summer
with a polo team. The cheers were simply deafening.
Polo is booming in this city for several reasons. For
one thing, so soon as a man gets married or engaged,
he taboos hunting; or has it tabooed for him. Women
consider that the aniseed sport is unduly dangerous.
Polo, on the other hand, they approve of, and their
male relatives are encouraged to play as long as
avoirdupois makes it possible for polo ponies to carry
them.
The Prince Alfred Old Scholars gave a dance in the
Norwood Town Hall-on Thursday evening. Mr. Miller
and Mr. Shuttleworth were the secretaries, and they
did their work like tradesmen.
The engagement is announced of Miss Lillian Davis
—a musical : lady with a milk and roses com-
plexion—and a Queenslander, whose name has eluded
me for the moment. It isn’t Smith, however.
The Ingrams settle permanently in Melbourne early
in October.
Miss Rose Loweay’s pictures, recently exhibited
in this city, won the critical admiration of Prime
Minister Fisher on Monday. He said the nicest
possible things of them, in the broadest, Scotch.
By the way, a lot is said of the woman-worker
who is continually robbing men of their billets,
but a big drapery house, ’t’other day, gave the
woman herself similar cause for complaint. One
of the firm’s windows displayed a bedroom, “taste-
fully” furn'shed with an “exclusive” suite, and two
large and brawny men roamed about in the window
o’ mornings, making the bed and removing dust from
the mirrors. Is this unjust competition, or is it a
gentle warning re a possible solution of the Marv
Anne problem ?
Cleric Severn —son of the artist of that name,
and a nephew of that Mrs. Ivenn’on whose husband
was once our bishop-—has renounced his vows of celi-
bacy, and become engaged. The girl comes from
the West Coast, where the Rev. S. has been evangel-
ising for the last year or so.
Cables from London announce the death of Mrs.
Morgan Hawkes, who left here early in the year, to
attend the marriage of her youngest daughter. Mr.
Hawkes died about 10 years ago.
Now that spring is fairly on us, excursion trains
on Saturdays and Sundays are beginning to fill up.
The hills thr's year showed the effect of the long, dry-
spell, and were slow in changing from drab to green,
but they’ve done it at last, and are smothered in a
thick, velvety mat of grass. Here and there are bril-
liant masses of dandelion and oxalis, smothering:
green in gold, and early wild flowers are beginning:
to add their colors to the carpet that Nature is
spreading. _ Nearer town, English trees are slowly
breaking into leaf, and flowering peaches are iri
bloom. In short—we’re looking our best, and we
know it, and we challenge comparison with any
town in the- Commonwealth that feels like putting*
up its money and having a race.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
The “hardy pioneers” • who did so much
for this country, and, incidentally, for them-
selves, have left P’ran (Vic.) a problem
which it doesn’t know what to do with. The
trouble is Chapel-street, which is so narrow
that a. lusty athlete could almost jump
across it. It is a busy thoroughfare, and it
gets more congested every day. Between l
frequent trams, more frequent motors, cabs, ]
carriages, carts, lorries, drays, buggies, soci- ;
ables. barrows, perambulators and other
vehicles it is so dangerous that the council- i
lors and other representative citizens hardly
dare risk crossing it. When the electric
trams come along and race up and down
like the Melbourne Cup, they will simply
not dare to cross. Of course, they want to
widen the streak of misery, but that means
buying up, demolishing and re-erecting about
two miles of shop fronts and other orna-
ments. to say nothing of the Town Hall, pic-
ture theatres, banks, etc. The owners of the
premises are demanding about £20,000,000 of
compensation; and P’ran can’t see it. Those
early pioneers left some heavy burdens to
posterity.

POLITICAL
POINTS
MEALS THAT MIGHT BE PINCHED.
POOR OLD BULL: “Ah, me hoy, it's terrible
expensive keepin' a armed force t’ protect
me imported victuals. Reckon it’s up t' you
t' take a ’ and in it."
YOUNG A USTRALIA: “But doesn't it ever strike
you that a kitchen-garden with one of these
on the back gate might be a bit cheaper?"
The Age casts Alfred Deakin off for good,
the Akgus allows its correspondents to re-
pudiate hint as a Liberal leader, but the
Women’s .National League embraces him.
Alfred may yet come back to State politics
and become a member of the House of Land-
lords.
Prime Minister Fisher’s reply to Admiral
Tate’s claptrap, re Australia being unable
to man its national navy (an accusation, by
the way ? that was palpably levelled to tickle
the ears of “Loyalist” groundlings in Can-
ada ), was fairly explicit. Said he : —
Until less than 12 months ago, other than recruit-
ing for the English navy, there has been no attempt
to get men for our fleet. The Commonwealth has
been handicapped by want of ships and shore estab-
lishments in which to train men. Notwithstanding
these drawbacks, there are drafts of men recruited
in Australia now in England, waiting to come out
with the ships. The cruiser Encounter, lent to us
with a nucleus crew, has a full complement of re-
cruits. Our shore establishments are full, and we
are extending them to make room for more recruits.
Within six months we have entered 135 boys on the
training ship Tingira. By the time the fleet unit is
ready, we shall be able to fill all the lower ratings
with Australians. The scheme works well and
smoothly.
Though rather a quarantine than a fiscal
matter, it is pleasing to note that Customs
Minister Tudor lately prohibited the impor-
tation into the Commonwealth of the dead
bodies of persons whose decease was due to
any infectious or contagious disease.
Heavens knows why anyone should ever
want to import such things! This paper
has never perceived any large demand for
the article —even when the spring sales are
on —and, anyhow, the Commonwealth itself
produces the normal supply with mathema-
tical regularity. Still, it is interesting to
note that in one item of commerce local in-
dustry is protected.
“G.V.W.”: Maoriland Customs Minister
Fisher proposes to send an officer to Eng-
land to prevent sweated goods from other
European countries being re-exported from
Fogland as the pure British article, and
gaining admission into Maoriland under the
preferential tariff. The proposal would be
all right if it were not lame in its feet and
rather buzzy in its head. Does Fisher
imagine that there is no sweating in Eng-
land? Also, does he imagine that one officer
can keep an eye on all the goods that are
sent out from Bull ports to Maoriland —
that he can know in advance every firm that
is going to send out goods by the next boat,
and get to that firm’s warehouse in time,
and inspect the goods, and avoid being
kicked for his interference? It looks a most
hopeless business.
“G.V.W.”: Observe the futility of the
Maoriland land purchase system:—
Iouseph Ward speaks: “It has taken the Govern-
ment the best part of 22 years to purchase £6,300,000
worth of land, and to settle 3500 souls on it.”
Iouseph on his own futility: “The former Govern-
ment did its best in the time at its disposal.” (Did
he want a millennium ?)
Iouseph, out of sad experience: “Freehold purchase
in quantity would lead to depreciation of the value
of land. Extensive private borrowing would lead to
higher interest and probably a slump.”
Yet, as a fact, Iouseph’s Government raised
land values steadily and on a system, and
used the fact that they had risen as a lure
for Cohen when negotiating fresh loans. The
land speculator, in turn, used the Govern-
ment valuation as a lever to extract higher
prices from the land-seeker. The land-
seeker was thus always between two devils,
each worse than the other, according to
whether you saw him from the end of his
tail or from behind a tree.
“Sub Rosa” : If
the Fisher Govern-
ment goes under in
Victoria at the
next elections its
capital-site policy
will be one of the
causes. Every
centre of any im-
portance has
passed resolutions
of disgust against
the waste of money
on Dryberra. And
Laborites are do-
ing as much in
this line as the
Liberals. To come
down to specific in-
stances, if Parker
Maloney, Scullin, Me-
Dougall and Ozanne
survive I am prepared
to spend the whole of
my next holiday in
the dreadful place that
the Party Govern-
ment system has de-
creed shall be the cap-
ital of a continent.
“The Nut” discourses:—
“Demos,” in his appeal (Bulletin 28/8/T2),
that State Labor members should be encouraged by
the party to contest Federal seats in Tasmania,
misses the main point at issue. In every other
State the local Houses are elected from single elec-
torates, or by the block vote, and where a seat is
given up by a sitting member the chances are that
the same party will win it again. In Tassy the
position is entirely different. The island is divided
into five districts, each of which returns six mem-
bers on the preferential voting system. The result
is that, even in the most conservative district, Labor
gets two seats, though in a minority of 4000 votes.
Suppose the holder of one of those seats resigns to
contest the Senate. Whether he wins or loses, his
State seat must be lost to his party in a straight-out
fight, and where there is at present only a single vote
between the two parties in the Assembly, there
would then be three. No one will deny that the
best tiio for the Senate can be selected from the
Assembly, but, if that means wrecking the State
Opposition, it may be bad business for democracy.
There is only one electorate where Labor can be
sure of winning a by-eleetion, viz., Darwin. In
all the others the party was beaten last April.
The claim of “Demos” that restriction of choice is
undemocratic, will scarcely hold water, as in this case
the question to decide is whether the interests of a
vast number of iState electors shall be considered, or
those of ambitious State members who would grasp
the bigger prize. If a special effort were necessary
in order to hold the Federal Parliament, the suggested
step might well be taken, because, after all, the
national legislature should have first call, but Labor
has a majority in the Senate for another three years,
and in Tas. it has no chance of winning any more
Rep. seats for the present, even with the strongest
men available. Whv, then, should the Executive risk
a reduction in the party strength in the State
House ?
A deputation called, the other day, on
N.S.W. Premier McGowen to utter a
muffled curse about the increased rents of
Sydney. Incidentally, it demanded that im-
migration should be instantly stopped as
regards the whole of N.S.W. —a great por-
tion of which has about half an inhabitaiit
to the square mile—because Sydney is
already overcrowded. The idea that immi-
grants might be sent to some place in
N.S.W. besides Sydney was beyond the
scope of the deputation’s politics. It had
evidently never heard of any other place.
This fragment is from the Brisbane
Courier of September 4, in the year 1562
b.w. (Before Willis) :
A most disgraceful scene occurred in the Assembly
last night. While the members of the House had
adjourned for refreshments, it was reported to Mr.
Buchanan, the eccentric and notorious member for
Morpeth, that Mr. Terry, another member, had called
him a blackguard. Buchanan then went up to Terry,
and struck him, whereupon the latter returned the
blow, and the little “mill” was ended by the by-
standers. It was rumored afterwards, however, that
Buchanan delivered a challenge to Terry, which that
gentleman very wisely tore up without reading.
When the House resumed, the circumstances were
reported to the Speaker, hut he ruled that he could
not interfere, as the fracas alluded to did not take
place within the precincts of the House. Buchanan
made an explanation, and, in the course of his re-
marks, called Terry a coward, but his words were at
once taken down, and he retracted. Subsequently,
while the House was in Committee, Buchanan, who
was intoxicated, several times interrupted the pro-
ceedings, and, the House having resumed, his con-
duct was again reported to the Speaker, who im-
mediately signed his warrant for the refractory
gentleman’s arrest. Buchanan struggled violently,
and the Sergeant-at-Arms had to be assisted by
several hon. members in ejecting him from the
House. He was locked up until the Assembly ad-
journed, and then discharged.
In those days the N.S.W. Assembly was very
like that wonderful gathering of hogs,
Huns, pushites and larrikins, the Hungarian
Parliament of 1912. The august body in
question has just met in an atmosphere of
curse and blither and free fight, and a con-
siderable-sized piece was bitten out of a dis-
tinguished nobleman of the Opposition. The
trouble arose out of the strenuous efforts of
the Opposition to disembowel the Cabinet.
THE FINAL JEER.
The Government made the formal announcement
in the House of Representatives to-day that there is
to be no new tariff during the session....It is to be
hoped that the Victorian Protectionists, who gave
their votes to Caucus Candidates at the last Federal
election on the plea that the Labor party was the
only one which would supply another dose of duties,
are satisfied. —Sydney Telegraph.
FUSIONESS (playfully): “ Seein’ as 'ow I cer-
t'nly won't allow Alfred to ’elp you—and
yer dear friend Andy don't seem disposed
to relieve yer — p'raps you'll now carry our
load in a nice peaceful, 'umble manner, an'
shut up! ”
WHEN MA GOES MAD!
Apart from that aspect of the question....there is
the plain cold fact that in virtually dismissing the
Governor-General, the Ministry had completely played
into the hands of the neighboring State of Victoria,
which recognises quite accurately that the presence
of the King’s chief representative is a valuable asset,
and that it becomes even more valuable when it is
taken away from New South Wales. If Victorian
politicians had framed the scheme promulgated by
Mr. Holman and his colleagues during the absence of
Mr. McGowen, it could have been understood. But
the enemy that has done this thing to New South
Wales is the New South Wales Government.
—Daily Telegraph, frantic with rage.
Discovery of another State grievance and dire
outrage on the. Ala State.
“Briner”: It is to be hoped that no dis-
aster will overtake our expensive plums, the
warships Australia, Sydney and Melbourne,
through lack of navigating officers. Natur-
ally, Britain will try to keep all the best
men for use in the coming scrap with Ger-
many, and the best men will want to stay,
because a row offers chances of rapid promo-
tion. Good navigators ought to be obtained
from our merchant vessels, if our naval
machinery is sufficiently elastic to allow it.
About getting scientific officers and handy
men there need be no special anxiety. Big
money will always draw them, even if they
have to be sought on land.
THE SERENADE.
There is a growing belief that the State Govern-
ment intends to make a determined attack upon the
Legislative Council, and, moreover, that it will also
seek to abolish the office of State Governor.
—Sydney paper.
Weakly yielding to the insistence
of country members, Victoria’s
Watt Ministry has driven a ten-
penny nail into the coffin of Closer
Settlement by moving amendments
to its own C. S. Amending Bill —
which amendments were, of course,
carried—providing that (1) an
owner of resumed land may keep
£lO,OOO worth instead of the £6OOO
worth formerly proposed; (2) a
closer settler may sublet his land;
(3) the restriction prohibiting the
transfer of these holdings to per-
sons who already own land in the
State worth more than £2500 be
abolished; (4) a settler may get
his Government grant—with the
right to transfer—at the end of 12
years instead of the 31 years orig-
inally agreed upon. Thus does the
Rich Landlord work his point and
play his old, disastrous, retrogres-
sive game of land monopoly. But when the
Federal land tax is increased he may find the
game not worth while.
“Albatross” : Australia wants an increase
in the birthrate. Well, why do decent girls
object to sailors as husbands? If sailors
have wives in every port, is it not possibffi
that bagmen have wives in every town?
Bah ! the thing disgusts me! Sailors make
good husbands and fathers; but until the
silly old English estimate of them is driven,
out of the skulls of marriageable Australian
girls their chances as legitimate birthrate
enhancers are small. In the meantime they,
are supposed to be sticking to their Pollies,!
Mollies and Sues, and spending their money
like water on beer and rum. A sailor in
England is dirt. In Australia he is much,
better off; but the old British stigma still !
hangs to him like pitch, and will take a
lot of scraping off.

TIGHT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Griffith yesterday foreshadowed the postponement
of sanctioned public works on account of the tight-
ness of the monev market. “At no period in the history
of the State,” he explained, “have so many railways,
irrigation works, harbor works, and school buildings
been under construction as at the present time, and
it is a vast pitv that the money markets of the
world have chosen this particular moment to get
‘tight.’ ” — Sydney Telegraph.
Tight!
Ev’ry money market’s tight!
Ev’ry precious golden quid is on a mad financial
“skite” !
British capital is reeling towards the railways of.
Cathay,
And it’s “Pass the bottle, brother!” all the bright
and careless day,
For the battleships and railways—for the docks,
canals and schools,
For the schemes of honest thinkers and the greedy
dreams of fools.
And the cash —cash —cash
Makes a loud metallic splash—-
Makes a tinkle and a rattle as it swiftly flows away
To accomplish distant wonders while the night suc-
ceeds the day.
Oh! it talks all sorts of lingos and it buys both beer
and bhang,
And the white men struggle for it like the shuffling
nigger gang;
Ev’ry camp and town is merry and there’s laughter
and delight.
But the joy is all suspended when the money market’s
tight!
Tight!
We have all been very tight!
We’ve been spending, strewing, flinging borrowed
money left and right!
Now there’s nothing in the bottle and it’s time to
sober up,
Or go reeling down to ruin with a more expensive
cup.
Cohen’s minted beer is finished and he offers us
champagne;
But the drunkard who has wisdom will not seek his
bar again.
And the cash —cash—cash
That has made us far too rash —-
That has lulled our honest hatred of the int’rest-
loving Jew,
And has kept us from the straight road where there
is no I O U,
Now is filling up the glasses of the Canuck and the
Chow,
And the Towel of Repentance binds our hot and
bursting brow.
So we find a flaming moral by the painful morning
light:
Lo! the, Borrower and the Market at the same time
can’t he tight!

Defiance bids to sense ;
The teeth that grind and gnaw
Have found at last a flaw
In this fine house immense.
The Letter of the Law
Now mocks our impotence.
The Letter of the Law!
What enemy need fear?
What need to hide the claw?
Rise tigers from your straw!

Oh! teeth that grin and saw!
Oh! cruel eyes that peer !

Or grips the crushed and raw
Remains of rat or mouse!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Exactly what went wrong with referee
Arthur Scott at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night,
writer knoweth not; but, had he laid himself out to
make a hash of things he could not have done it
more thoroughly. It was an absolute masterpiece.
' His handling of the fight was slovenly, and his deci-
sion simply putrid. The difference in the weight of
Read and Til was said to be only four pounds ; but
Read looked easily a stone heavier ; and it is obvious
that the little Frenchman realised that to mix things
from the jump meant being worsted. And it did.
For in the early stages of a fight Read is a whirling
cyclone; an animated mass of aggression which
bounds, rushes and throws around blows like rain.
Even so hardened a bruiser as McCoy, who also looks
heavier and stronger than Til, found Read’s
early onslaught almost more than he could bear. So
the little Frenchman, it was obvious, had decided to
let Read exhaust that initial energy on thin air, and
when the first blush had worn off his aggressiveness,
to wade in. It was the right game, too. And he did
it. This idea that a man should get points for
coming in to attack, whether he makes good his
attack or not, is the most crack-brained of the many
mad notions held in Sydney regarding boxing. Til
eluded Read’s furious onslaught with considerable
skill, and when he had worn off the keen edge of his
aggressiveness, rushed in, swarmed all over him,
knocked him into the ropes twice, so that he would
have gone right down but for them, and scored a
clean, straight knock-down; and, finally, had him
hanging on desperately to see time through and avoid
a knock-out. Another couple of rounds at the most
would have seen Read beaten to ruins. Til fought a
scientific fight, and won absolutely beyond the shadow
of a doubt. Scott’s decision was most unfortunate,
and a rank injustice to a clever, gallant boxer.
There was one circumstance which makes the hand-
ling of the fight by Scott look very slovenly. In the
fourth round, Til suddenly doubled up, and his face
assumed an expression of intense pain. He claimed
to have been hit low, and staggered to the comer,
where he sat down for a brief space. Scott had seen
no foul blow struck, and Read’s look of surprise was
the expression of a conscientious man. The explana-
tion given afterwards was that Til, in fending a belly
rip, had knocked a drive of Read’s downward instead
of to the side, and thereby caused it to land in the
forbidden area. All this writer has to say is that
after having been hit in the same locality three times
in the course of a mis spent youth, he cannot under-
stand how the deuce Til came up so quickly and put
up such a wild-cat fight as he did. Writer has grave
doubts about the genuineness of that alleged foul
wallop. It certainly was not severe, or Til had not
resumed so gamely. If he was fouled, even accidentally,
Til was entitled to a verdict on a foul. If he was
not fouled, then Read should have got the decision on
the spot. It’s one thing or other, and all talk about
considering the public, and saving it from disap-
pointment, is just plain flap-doodle. The referee is
not there to consider the public which puts up the
money—he is there to see that both fighters get a
square deal, and to interpret a very plain set of
rules. It was obvious from the way that Til came
up and resumed the disagreement that he had never
been really fouled at all. He may have been pinked
low—but injured he certainly was not —unless he is
differently constituted to the writer. It was after
that alleged foul that he made an absolute chopping
black of the Tasmanian, and as referee Scott had
allowed the incident to pass, Til should have got the
verdict.
* * * *
It is not by any means certain, after all,
that The Mclntosh will succeed in landing Johnson
at Rushcutter’s Bay Stadium ; as that lengthy hum-
bug has been up to his old tricks again. His latest
flapdoodle was to stipulate that, in addition to the
$lO,OOO guarantee Mclntosh should also put up the
$5OOO expenses. Mclntosh snid he was agreeable,
whereupon Johnson cabled that the total $15,000
must be put up _ with a particular friend of his.
Then Mclntosh kicked. He wanted to deposit the
money in a bank—Johnson or his unknown friend
could nominate the bank, so long as it was one of re-
pute. But Johnson would agree to nothing but that his
nominee should hold the money. It was such an
obviously impossible condition put up to gain time,
that the Sydney promoter could do nothing but get
off the grass. At the time Johnson fondly believed
he would get £6OOO for fighting Jeanette in New
York. He was anxious to fight there, till he learned
with disgust that the Commission had no objection
to his fighting another nigger, but would not' allow
him to fight a white man, as it could see no white
man who had a reasonable chance. Johnson is a
great bluffer. While he was humbugging Mclntosh
in Svrlney with impossible conditions, be was us : ng
the offer of the Mclntosh to try to bluff a higher
price out of Gibson, of New York, for the fight with
Jeanette. Gibson got worried, and, going to the
long-distance telephone, rang up Johnson’s “Caf6 de
Champion,” as he calls it, in Chicago. Johnson was
there. “$20,000 is the best I can offer for a fight
with Jeanette on Labor Day!” said Gibson. “I can
get $20,000.f0r fighting suckers. My price is $30,000,
an’, sav, Mista Gibson, I mus’ knoo right soon, so’s
to begin and fix ma dates fer ma Australian tour.
They’re real anxious out ther’ to have me back ’gain,
Mr. G'bson, so Ah guess the $30,000 mus’ stand,
Mista Gibson.”* Then Gibson hung up and rang off,
and Johnson went back to attend to the “Caf6 de
Champion.”

“Magpie” : Re goal-kickers (B. 12/9/’l2).
The Messengers are not the only pebbles on the
sward. As regards mere numerosity, David
McNamara, the Essendon (Vic.) Soccer champion
licks them hollow. Up to time of writing he has
booted 99 goals in 19 games, and with possibly two
more matches —certainly one—to go, it is a cer-
tainty he will top the century. On April 3, 1909, at
St. Kikla (Vic.), this player kicked a football 84yds.
from boot to bounce—a world’s record.
Saturday’s Melbourne lioofball finals
were played in ideal weather, though an occasional
breath from the coming summer warned the ’bailers
that it was time they put their playthings by. All
the disturbances were of the hard, close-fought order,
and none of the competing teams could take a
moment’s respite till the last bell rang. On the
Metropolitan ground 47,356 persons paid £1790 2s.
6d. to watch the Carlton-Essendon collision. A 2000
larger crowd watched the same clubs battle out the
finish in ’OB, but Saturday’s push was apparently
“flusher,” as it parted 225. 6d. more than the pre-
vious record. Play was brilliant in spots, but the
teams were hampered by having top-notchers who
were either stunned by the importance of the oc-
casion, or were too tired to bustle themselves, or
something. In brief, the ’Dons were smarter and
quicker-witted. Going off at a great pace, they got
a small lead, and never lost it. The Old Blues had
what their barrackers called the “rotten luck” to hit
the goal post four times, but it was rather selfish and
unsystematic play than luck that lost them so many
points. In the second quarter the “Same Old” made
determined efforts to get away from their opponents,
and reached the interval nine points to the good—
which wasn’t much. The third and last terms saw
the Blues doing their darndest —the bigger battlers
plunging round and tearing through regardless—but
ever as they put on a goal or a behind the ’Dons
would square the account with a similar score. And
always they kept ahead. The Blues got within four
points, but before they could storm the longed-for
goal the ’Dons had added one, and the position was
as bad as ever. They put up a tremendous rush and
gained a goal, but even as they were tearing down
the ground for another the bell* rang, and the ’Dons
had won by four points—s 2 to Carlton’s 48. The
winners meet South this Saturday in the “grand
final,” but as one of their forwards was limping
badly through most of Saturday’s game, and their
champion rover broke his leg just at the moment of
victory, their chance against the “Southern Angels”
doesn’t look too rosy.
The Ass. final, at North Melbourne, viewed by
23,000 people, worth £342, afforded a suggestive co-
incidence. Last year the two Essendons beat the two
Magpies in the final matches; this year the two
’Dons, both in the third place, have successively
beaten the leaders and runners-up, and now have to
meet the leaders again in a “grand final.” And on
Saturday both ’Dons won by four points only. The
North-Essendon encounter was a case of wits against
main force —and wits won. The ’Dons boast the
State’s champion goal-kicker—his record for the
season is 105, miles ahead of any previous tally—
and North told off two men to block him. They suc-
ceeded to some extent, though he got six goals ; but
while he was galloping round and often pretending
to go for a mark, his two small fellow-forwards were
playing shuttlecock with the ball, and tossing it to
and fro till ihey got into position. The result showed
in the scores-—Essendon. 16 goals six behinds ; North,
14 goals 14 behinds; 102 points to 98. The breeze
alternately favored either side, and when the ’Dons
started the last term 17 points in arrear, it was felt
that it was a case of goals or nothing. North during
the term added another 19 points, but the others, by
brainy play, making the most of their chances, got
six goals four behinds—and the odd behinds won.
As the last goal only came in the last minute, the
finish was exciting enough, and the roars of the bar-
rackers could be heard nearly out to Essendon itself.
The ’Dons have now to meet the “minor premiers,”
’■Scray, and that ends the riot.
McINTOSH GETS A MOVE ON.
Previous to last week's elections by tlie
clubs composing the V.C.A. of their respective dele-
gates, barrackers for the malcontents, anticipating the
defeat of the former delegates and their Board of Con-
trol nominees, were eagerly advising everybody to
decide the issue once for all, and then bury the
hatchet—“in the deep blue sea,” as Nawman Bayles
put it. The elections are over, and the hatchet has
been buried all right—in the necks of the malcon-
tents. The former V.C.A. delegates to the Board of
Control were re-elected with 24 and 17 votes, their
opponents polling 10 and eight. For the selection
committee, Peter McAlister, E. E. Bean and Mick
Ellis got 67 votes altogether, while their solitary
opponent, Harry Trott, carried only 11. The East
Melbourne C.C.’s annual meeting, a few days before,
gave a forecast of what was going to happen.
The Melbourne Cricket Club is in reality a body
of persons using certain public lands and the build-
ings and appurtenances thereon for its own amuse-
ment and delectation. Its revenue last year from
subscriptions and entrance fees was £10,367 14s.
The trustees of the Metropolitan Cricket Ground,
whereat and whereon the M.C.C. members get the
worth of their subscriptions, simultaneously acquired
a net revenue of £2231 Os. Bd., to which football
contributed £lO2l 10s. ; cricket (with an English
team playing international and test matches), £lOl7
11s. 9d. ; concerts, £lB2 os. 3d. ; and miscellaneous
sports, £9 18s. Bd. The cricket takings only reach
that height triennially or thereabouts; the concert
revenue depends on the weather and public taste, but
the football gate is a regular and abiding circum-
stance. No wonder the ground’s trustees don’t set so
much store by the M.C.C. as that body does by itself.
The Soccer struggles for the Rawson and
Association Cups are soli raging in Sydney, and if
the present rise in the temperature continues, the
’bailers will find the final allocation of those utensils
a very perspiry job. Saturday was a mighty warm
day to play football; but all the same, the Soccer
crowd did two desperate matches at the Sports
Ground. In the matter of the Association Cup, New-
town, which is second last on the list, with only five
competition points, after much wrestling in prayer,
decided it was not worth while to go up against West
Sydney with its 23 points, and sent along a forfeit.
The result of this was that Balmain and West Syd-
ney are now equal on points, and must eventually
meet in battle array to decide which of them shail
have the use of the splendiferous mug for the coming
year. And great will be the battle. In the Rawson
riot Balmain fell on Sydney, which was leading by a
couple of points; got it down, and bit it by two
goals to one, and thus equalised things. Wherefore
and whereby they, too, must meet again to decide
which shall bite the dust. The Navy attacked New-
town, and overthrew it by four goals to three —but
got no nearer the goal practically. The Navy, even
with its honors, bruises and contusions thick upon
it, still shares with Canterbury the dubious distinc-
tion of driving the rest of the competing clubs before
it, and Newtown is last in the procession of the
driven. But, all the same, the two clubs struggled
as desperately as though the fate of the Cup depended
on their exertions. The meeting between Balmain
and Sydney was tremendous. Balmain discovered
that Sydney had been unable to bring its best team
into the field, and hastily decided to force things
and see what rushing would do. The Sydney defence
was rock-like, and when it wasn’t, it was lucky.
Sydney’s captain lifted his men after the repulse of
each attack to another splendid charge. It failed,
but it was a great effort. Back each time came Bal-
main, and at last, with a three-man pass, tore into
the goal. Balmain, one; Sydney, nil. That goal
was the taste of blood to tigers; and Balmain was
out for meat. Also it was loaded for beer. Sydney
struggled desperately, hut again the men from the
Ragged Suburb broke through, and the score was
two to nil. Close upon half-time Sydney burst
through, and wiped one off the margin. After that
they swayed about helplessly, struggling desperately,
almost too exhausted in the heat to play systemati-
cally ; and there was no further score. Balmain won
by two goals to one.

In the Australian Rules section, Y.M.C.A.
met Sydney, but for once the Loard hid His face
from His children, and the heathen triumphed might-
ily—by 78 points to 31. Exactly why the Good
Young Men should have gone to pieces so utterly is
hard to explain. The previous Saturday had seen
them utterly smash Paddington, the “minor premier
club,’’ and the general expectation was that it would
be a hard and bitter day for Sydney. It wasn’t.
Sydney’s splendid team worked like a machine. Its
kicking was superb, its charges irresistible; its com-
bination perfect. And the result was the utter over-
throw of the Anointed.

The Scots’ College Sports produced a
youthful phenomenon in the person of little Eric
Senior, one of twin sons of the lady who is known
in journalistic and musical circles as Miss May Sum-
merbelle. Young Eric is only eight years old, but he
won the mile handicap from the 380yds. mark in
smin. 19see., with 25yds. to spare, from boys many
of whom were double his age. His sprinting was
beautiful to watch; but about the wisdom of the
school authorities in allowing an eight-year-old boy to
compete in a mile race, this writer has very de-
cided opinions—which are highly uncomplimentary
to the Scots’ College athletic authorities. Still, the
boy is certainly an abnormality, for in addition to
this deed of derring-do, this almost baby also won
the high jump handicap, and put up some startling
performances in a number of sprinting events. There’s
not much of Eric, but what there is seems to be of
fine quality.

Midway in the long billiards game between
Lindrum and Harverson, at Alcoek’s Parlor, in Mel-
bourne, another new cloth was substituted for the
somewhat nappier one which had seemed to handicap
the Australian champion. On the new cloth he at
once began to make up his points, without the
assistance of the Gray stroke. Both men have been
playing well of late, and the game will be an inter-
esting exhibition right up to its last session on
Saturday night. Next week Alcock’s are to intro-
duce the novelty of a Bijou-table tournament, con-
fined to bona-fide amateur experts in “pony” billiards.
Probably Lindrum and Harverson will open the pro-
ceedings with an exhibition of the Bijou-table’s pos-
sibilities for the making of big breaks at small ex-
penditure of elbow grease.
Backers of Flavian for the Cups, on the
strength of his two “seconds” last year, begin to
think that his mighty fine appearance is not quite
satisfactory. What he has gained in weight the
horse may have lost in speed. On Saturday, at
Caulfield, the handsome six-year-old started at odds-
on for a 11-mile race, but was beaten by a 1 ght-
weighted commoner. Parisian and Bobadea ran un-
backed in the same race, the latter making the better
show. If the Victorian nop-notchers are to be fit to
hold their own against the best of the N.S.W. cham-
pions in four or five weeks time, they will have to
put in some hard track work in the meantime.
The richness of the A.J.C. Derby stake is
a most commendable thing from both a sporting and
punter point of view. It ensures a reasonable chance
for criticism of “crack” three-year-old “form” in
the near future events, and disposes of a lot of con-
fusing doubts that arise from the bad running of
good horses during the few weeks prior to the Syd-
ney event. Within the past 12 years seven winners
of the A.J.C. Derby have gone on and captured the
V.R.C. ditto, two of them —-Poseidon and Prince
Foote—have taken the Melbourne Cup also, and
three others—Malster, Abundance and Mountain King
—have run second or third for the Cup. Two of
the A.J.C. Derby winners in those 12 years have run
second for the V.R.C. Derby, and six of the minor
placed ones at Randwick, have been placed again—
first, second or third —in the three-year-old test race
at Flemington. Evidently the A.J.C. Derby is an
honest guide to three-year-old form, and as the rich
stake grows richer, its guiding power increases rather
than otherwise. The form may be very moderate in
some years, but its comparative value holds good.
Last year Cisco missed his second Derby by a head
only, after going amiss in his training. Next Satur-
day week should show whether Wolawa, Cider and
other lately disappointing crack three-year-olds have
lost ground since last season, or have been getting
ready for what is apologetically termed a surprise.
About the recent doings of the more elderly gee-gee
aristocrats there seems to be no doubt whatever.
With only one or two exceptions they were under-
stood to be making an unholy show of their need
for a few more gallops or a wider betting market,
or both. Nobody nowadays expects to see the best
horses win in August or the early part of September.
Curiosity centres in their manner of getting beaten
and the measures adopted to impart an air of re-
spectability to their defeat.
The combined batting averages of Bards-
ley and Macartney for the Australian Eleven, in Eng-
land, amounted to one run more than the combined
averages of Kelleway, Gregory, Jennings and Mayne,
the next four men on the list, who ranged from
28.57 to 21.39. Ilazlitt, with an average of 7.93 for
37 innings, was the tuft of the long batting tail, but
he shared with Whitty the honor of taking more than
100 wickets, at the reasonable cost of 18 to 19 runs
apiece. Both in batting and bowling Whitty came
out a trifle ahead of Hazlitt. Macartney, second in
batting and first in bowling averages, was unap-
proached as an all-round performer. Then came
Matthews, Kelleway, Minnett and Emery. McLaren,
who took 27 wickets, was less of a failure than non-
bowlers Webster and Smith. Carkeek’s batting aver-
age of 9.17 made him a costly wicketkeeper as com-
pared with the keepers of yore.
The four Australian cricketers who took
the £4OO in lieu of a share of the profits got the
best of the deal after all, as it turns out the other
11 will receive about £2OO each —which is none too
bad,_ considering the way the weather went into
liquidation. By the time this is in print Gregory,
Kelleway, Whitty, Matthews, Mayne, Emery, McLaren,
Smith, Webster and Carkeek will be taking their
first glimpse of the land of America, where, with a
“pick-up,” most likely a South African, they will play
the brethren of Philadelphia and divers other churches
till the end of October. Macartney, Bardslev, Jen-
nings, Hazlitt, Minnett and manager Crouch will
return home by the Marathon, arriving Sydney, via
the Cape, on November 25.
There is always balm in Gilead; and
South Africa, though outclassed and utterly walloped,
not to say routed, managed to collar two medals on
the tour. Nourse’s 213 against Hampshire is the
highest individual score for either visiting team;
but it was hard pressed by Macartney’s 208 against
Essex. Also, Pegier captured more wickets than the
most deadly Australian.
“ * *
The curse of “King Willow”: Unreason-
ing- newspaper reckoners, who regard international
cricket as a club-swinging endurance exhibition, are
whooping that Bardsley has carried off the batting
honors of the tour, with an aggregate of 2416 runs,
and they give Macartney a gentle pat for 2207. But
the hotch-potch “all in” total credited to Bardslev
includes no fewer than 855 runs made it matches
that do not count, or shouldn’t count, as they don’t
matter, being outside County, Test or M.C.C. fixtures.
In the latter Bardsley made 1561. Macartney only
troubled to make 459 in the unimportant knocks;
but in the merit matches he aggregates 187 more
than Bardsley, and when runs were badly wanted in
a tight corner, it was Macartney who smacked them
up. In June Australia first struck trouble, being-
beaten in two successive matches, but in these
Macartney totalled 111 and Bardsley 10 against Lan-
cashire; Macartney 66, Bardsley 26 against Surrey
in the return. In the first Surrey Macartney made
148 runs, Bardsley 46. In the two drawn games
with the then coming champion county, Yorkshire,
Macartney 91, Bardsley 37.. The left-hander is a
good bat of the stolid sort, but on neither of his
English tours has he been the best man in big things,
whatever newspaper averages may allege.
Yorkshire, with 72 per cent, of points has
won the First Class County Championship of England
from 15 opponents. The system of points governing
this competition is one that might well be applied
or adapted to the performance of teams touring
the Land of Darkness and Deluge. For an outright
win five points are awarded. Where each side com-
pletes one innings only three points go to the leader,
and one point to the other team, in consideration of
the fact that it might have won had the match been
completed. For any play less than one innings each
side, no . points. By that system the wearisome
“draw” is eliminated from many unfinished games,
and the play is brightened by the effort to reach at
least the “minor” points stage before the rain and
murk resume. It took Fogland until last year to
discover this eminently sensible reform. Just note
the application thereof to the Australian Test,
County and M.C.C. matches (the only matches that
are of any real significance) : Matches commenced,
27. Unfinished at less than one innings each, and
therefore wiped off the slate, three. Balance, 24.
Completed, 13. One innings each completed, 11.
Under the present misleading system Australia’s re-
cord in that series of principal matches is sum-
marised as:—■
Played, 27. Won, 7. Lost, 6. Drawn, 14.
But these 14 “draws” include no fewer than six
county matches in which Australia led on the first
innings, and one of them was the return with the
champion County, Yorkshire. The points system
would present Gregory and Co. thus: Played, 24.
Won, seven. Won first innings, six. Lost, six. Lost,
single innings, five, or 58 points out of a possible
98, equal to 59.18 per cent., as against 53.84 per
cent, for seven outright wins in 13 completed
matches.

A gaudy rumor started by a Melbourne
paper, has just about blown itself out. The fairy
tale was that the Mitchell Bros., owners of Trafalgar,
were importing Frank Wootton from England, at a
fabulous fee, to ride the champion in the Melbourne
Cup. Many noble sports, who are trusting to Car-
bine’s grandson to do the trick at his fourth attempt,
did not fancy Frank Wootton on such a horse in
such a race; and they will be relieved to hear that,
some months ago, Sydney jockey J. E. Pike was
engaged to ride Trafalgar in his spring engage-
ments, and. that, at time of writing, there has been
■no alteration of that agreement. The aforemen-
tioned marvel of horseflesh is at present in as good
fettle as ever in his life, and is due in Sydney
this week, with a nose for three A.J.C. weight-for-
age events. Although he has started 56 times for 23
wins,. 10 seconds, and s'x thirds, and won £20.003.
and is now a seven-year-old, he has never been turned
out for a spell. Which is more than can be said for
Carbine, who started 43 times for 33 wins, six
seconds, three thirds and £29,476. Trafalgar looks
safe to beat his grand-dad’s money, this season, as
well as his number of wins before retiring. Already
Trafalgar heads the list of Australian-bred stake-
winners, for Carbine was a Maorilander.
The great tug-of-war carnival will* burst
into being on Saturday night at Mclntosh’s Stadium,
Sydney. The opening scene will be a procession of
the visiting champions and the pick of the local
men, such as the mighty Heckenbergs. Later on. the
“Parramatta Pygmies”, (a team consisting wholly of
members of the lleckenberg family from Parramatta)
will, settle the question of which shall represent Aus-
tralia by argument with Fitzpatrick’s crowd, which
is described as “a little lot.” Of course, it is all a
matter of comparison. The International struggle
will be opened by Scotland “talcin’ aa pu’ at Ire-
land.” The volcanic tuggers from Maoriland and the
Melbourne cask-jugglers will be down against Sydney
unionists and storemen —an airy team whose average
weight is 18 stone. Blue-jackets ‘from the Cambrian
and the Drake will decide which is the better war-
ship. So altogether the veriest glutton should not go
away altogether unsatisfied.
SPRAINS AND BRUISES.
COMSTOCK’S NERVE AND BONE
LINIMENT USED WITH WONDER-
FUL SUCCESS. A BALMAIN RESI-
DENT’S TESTIMONY.
“Some months ago,” writes Mr. J. Bur-
gess, of Balmain, Sydney, “I had a nasty
fall, _ severely bruising the kneecap and
spraining my wrist. Having been recom-
mended Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Lini-
ment on a previous occasion, I had the bal-
ance of the bottle in the house, and got my
wife to apply it, after bathing the parts
with warm water. It gave me almost in-
stant relief, and in a few days all traces of
the accident had disappeared. I really think
the Liniment saved me several days of in-
capacitation.”
A sprain is an injury to the ligaments of
a joint, usually the wrist or the ankle, by
accident or over-straining. Sprains are
usually attended with much pain and swell-
ing of the part, and sometimes produce faint-
ing and _ vomiting. Comstock’s Nerve and
Bone Liniment is an ideal remedy for
sprains, and should be applied frequently
and well rubbed in until all traces have dis-
appeared. As sprains are one of the most
frequent accidents, every household should
contain a bottle of this valuable Liniment
for this purpose, if for nothing else. Sold
by. all leading chemists and storekeepers,
price 2s. 6d., or will be forwarded by post at
same price by the W. H. Comstock Co.,
Ltd., 23 Lang Street, Sydney.

every serviceable hit, stop, counter,
feint, shift—in fact, equip you to take
your part in a convincing way.
I find your mode of tuition very
easy to follow, and I am highly satis-
fied with it, and progressing favor-
ably.— A.M., Glenroy (Q.).
Once you get a reputation of being
able to fight your way out of a
“scrape,” you’ll be seldom called upon
to defend yourself.
Once you prove yourself a soft “snap,” you will have to keep out of sight, when
there’s trouble about.
Now, why don’t you make a start, and learn Boxing by Post? Drop me a note

“F.C.” writes :
Whatever may happen in other States at next
general election, Labor in Victoria will probably have
some difficulty in answering insistent queries as to
why it has so long delayed carrying out the protective
policy on which it was elected in April, TO. When
Victoria’s Government delegated Mr. Whitehead to
the Cold Land, to rope in artisan immigrants, many
manufacturers applied for mechanics of sorts. The
Trades Hall Council objected that they weren’t really
wanted, and a compromise number was agreed on.
Whitehead got his men, many of whom left fair
billets to come out, and, now that they are coming
in shoals, the manufacturers can’t find jobs for them.
Of course, this is quite wicked on the part of the
manufacturers, but their explanation is that imports
are increasing, as they never increased before, and
therefore manufactures, instead of growing, as was
naturally anticipated, are about stationary,' and they
can’t employ men when they have no work for them.
There is much in the plea. The only remedy the
electors now have is to fire out at next June election
every candidate, Laborite or otherwise, who will not
promise to assist in passing a genuinely protective
tariff within the next 12 mouths.
Wales is the stronghold of Baptists. Every
Welsh village has a Baptist chapel. In one
of them, at Pontypool, a preacher was say-
ing disrespectful things about King David
a few Sundays ago, when a member of the
congregation rose and objected on the
ground that David was not there to defend
himself. “What’s the good of all this mud-
slinging?” inquired the interjector. “For
months you have been preaching these de-
rogatory sermons. First, you hit out at
Moses; then you spoke of Esther, as if she
were a bod woman; and last Sunday you
dragged Job through the mire. You seem
to delight in this sort of thing, but we
don’t.” As other members of the congrega-
tion seemed disposed to say ditto to the in-
terrupter, the preacher brought the sermon
to "an abrupt olncn ”

Do You Odolise P
Odol, the World’s Dentifrice, is the
preparation to use, for a few drops mixed
with a tumbler of water make an emulsion
which will thoroughly cleanse and ourify
the oral cavity, destroying all injurious
bacteria.
It is the rinsing of the mouth and
the brushing of the teeth with this anti-
septic and delightfully refreshing mixture
that constitutes the process now known
as Odolising.
Odol penetrates the interstices in and
between the teeth and permeates the
gums and mucous membrane of the
mouth, exerting its marvellous powers
not only during the few moments while
using it, but for hours afterwards.

“Corkonian”: Hugo’s big minstrel company opens
at Wirths’ Melbourne Hippodrome. The first negroid
minstrels in Australia were Rainer’s Serenaders.
Rainer long afterwards had the enormously lucrative
panorama of the United States Civil War. The
better panorama of the Franco-German War, with
Kyrle Bellew as lecturer, never caught on like
Rainer’s. The next after his Serenaders were tiie
Backus Minstrels, from San Franc.sco, showing at
Coppin’s Melbourne Olympic. Coppin brought, out
the Nubian Minstrels, the worst frost ever he bandied,
and the worst ever known, except Simonsen’s Spanish
Students. The so-called Christy Minstrels opened at
Melbourne Royal in 1860, and Burton’s Circus showed
there the same year. The Christys included Tom H.
Rainford, a baritone, not to be confounded with J. H.
Rainford, the well-known Sydney actor, manager and
publican. Other Christys were tenors Stewart and
Melvyn, pianist Steele, and comedians Joe Brown
(of course not our little, fat theatre manager) and
Wash Norton. Two years later another good com-
pany, at the Melb. Haymarket, included tenors Abecco
and Herberte, of Belle Brandon fame, also Nick La
Feuillade, the violinist. The Weston and Hussey
Minstrels included Harry Kelly and Charley Holly,
afterwards partner with Tom Buckley. Maxey was a
well-known corner man, who visited Australia. Emer-
son’s first batch included Sutton, Scott and Rocke-
feller. Billy voted Australia rotten. Yet Emerson
came twice more. The second time he had the
Cogills, Walsh and King, Stanley and Pixley, and
Dan Treacy, clog-leaper, afterwards manager of Melb.
Gaiety. In Emerson’s third visit he was with Wood,
described as the Somewhat Different Comedian. And
he certainly was different, though what he was differ-
ent from is another matter. Tommy Campbell was a
well-known baritone. After dropping out of mind,
he turned up again from San Fran., with a renowned
nineteen-guinea fur coat. Good Australian performers
have been Johnny Cowan, Buckley, Kohlman, the
brothers Dave, George and Johnny Gardner, and Cal
Gay. Hiscocks and Batchelder’s Minstrels held on
long. Horace Bent, a Geelong man, did well for
many years, not only in Australia but in America.
Charley Hugo had a good spell of performing and
managing. I think the first woman that blacked up
in Australia was Nellie Hosmer. Then there was
little Fanny Wiseman, Monty South’s wife, so capi-
tal as Topsy, in the eightv-nigbts run at Melbourne
Princess’s, with her song of “Chingy Ring a Rickey.”
Her daughter has also taken up the Topsy mantle,
which consists of a bit of old gunny-bag. So much
for my recollections of M ; stnh Johnson, Bones and
Tambo. And I’ve forgotten the two Georgia Troupes
"ud M'Adoo’s.
“Lantana” : Recently bought a ticket for a charity
dance in connection with a well-known city maternity
home. Printed conspicuously across the top was a
legend conveying the compliments of a reputable firm
of undertakers. The association of ideas was cheer-
ful.
C. M. S. McLennan, the man who, under the name
of Hugh Morton, wrote “The Belle of New York,”
which netted £40,000 for George Musgrove in Lon-
don, has perpetrated a new musical comedy, to be
called “Her Left Shoulder,” and has been talking to
the London interviewers about it. The story deals
with artists’ models, and the hunt for a correct left
shoulder for a picture of Venus. This obviously
involves inspection of a crowd of pretty girls at
close quarters. McLennan says it is much harder
work to write these light, frothy comedies than to
perpetrate serious plays. He has done both, so he
ought to know. Some people say that he has done
both badly.
Franz Lehar, the composer of “The Merry Widow,”
is reported to have made £lOO,OOO out of the cheery
female with the famous waltz. He has also done
well out of his other musical comedies, and is pro-
claimed by a London authority as the “wealthiest
living composer.” But he had his struggles. When
a student at the Prague Conservatorium he was a
“boarding pupil,” which is not an agreeable form of
existence. His parents were poor and unable to
rtjnit him sufficient funds. “On one occasion,” he
told a recent interviewer, “I collapsed in the street
from sheer hunger.” He showed Dvorak.a couple of
his juvenile compositions, and that master said:
“Hang your violin up on the wall and devote your-
self entirely to composition.” He took the advice,
and gave up being hungry and collapsing in the
street.
The London County Council exercises jurisdiction
over all the variety houses, theatres and concert-halls
in the latter-day Babylon, with one conspicuous ex-
ception—the biggest place of the lot, the Royal
Albert Hall. This is the colossal rotunda which,
with the absurd “memorial” statue in front of it, is
supposed to perpetuate the memory of the husband
of Queen Vic. and the grandfather of King George.
Hitherto, the influence of royalty has prevented the
County Council or anybody else interfering with the
control or regulation of this place, although it is
frequently used for concerts and big public meetings
of all sorts. At the last meeting of the Council it
was decided, as a matter of public safety, to appeal
to the High Court for authority to bring the danger-
ous building up to date and in line with other struc-
tures of the sort. According to the Chairman of the
Theatres and Music Halls Comniittee, the Albert Hall
holds 10,000 people, whereas the exits provide for
only 4000. Also, most of these exits are blocked up,
and would be death-traps in an emergency. Further-
more, there are no attendants qualified to direct
people through the maze of passages and corridors.
And finally, the doors leading from the vast promen-
ade gallery are always locked. He prophesied a holo-
caust there some day or night.
“Monkbarns”: The Melbourne Theatre Royal being
newly done up, may justify a glance over its history.
The first Royal opened about the middle of 1855. It
was built by Black, who made a fortune as carrier
to Ballarat and Bendigo, and here dropped the swag
and the loot and the profits. The only previous Melb.
theatre had been the Queen’s, opened in 1845. Three
theatres arose in 1855 —the Royal, Olympic and Ast-
ley’s—on which last G. B. W. Lewis' lost £30,000.
Coppin and Brooke obtained the Royal in 1856.
Brooke was sole lessee in 1858. Brooke and Coppin
again in 1860. The next lessee was Wilton, under
whose auspices Barry Sullivan appeared in 1862.
Sullivan was lessee in 1863. Hoskins and Clarence
Holt, Bland’s father, arrived in 1865. Co-partnery
of Lambert, Harwood, C. Vincent, Bellair, Hennings
and Stewart in 1867. Various changes followed, in
most of which Coppin and Greville figured. Theatre
burnt in February, 1872. New one, built by Coppin,
opened in November of that year. He subsided into
one of the proprietary, while Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove raised the house to new glory. When thev
opened the new Princess’s, the Royal fell back into
the barn stage. Bland Holt lifted it again, and with
the new improvements it has recovered its old pres-
tige. Meanwhile, the Princess's sags somewhat into
the barn category.
“Vulcan”: Even Tokio’s brown heathen suffers
from tlie fatuous theatrical censor. Recently, after
witnessing* a performance, the Home and ii<ducation
Departments suppressed Sudermann’s “Magda,’ on
the ground that it “contained too many sentiments
contrary to the ideal of filial piety, which is so much
prized in this country.” A wild press howl resuited
and raged unabated until the authorities permittee
“Magda ”to resume, but in a mutilated form —“in
order to avoid that which is contrary to the old
public morality of Japan.” And the laugh of the
Yoshiwarra rang out right across the Monkey Sea.
In Paris there seems to be a lot of money flying
about in the moving picture business. Owing to a
squabble among the shareholders of a leading cine-
matograph company, there have been revelations in
court. The company paid Le Bargv £760 a year as
“artistic adviser,” and the same annual sum to !
I.avedan as “literary adviser.” Also, there were
three stage managers, each in receipt of £BOO a
year. The sums paid to the actors and actresses
seem small in comparison with the salaries of the
advisers and stage managers. That grand old girl.
Sarah Bernhardt, heads the list with £6O a perform-
ance, while Rejane gets only £4O. And Bernhardt, in
addition gets a id. for every yard of film. Some of
these films would stretch from Sydney to the Middle
Ages, so that humble coin really represents a very
substantial addition to the £6O fee.
“Stargazer” : Re effort to encourage the making of
plays in Australia, it strikes me that the music-hall
offers a better field for beginners than is discoverable
in any other direction. Vaudeville patrons like little
plays, and their taste is not bad. But the supply of
even moderately good small comedies or 16-minute
farces for the halls would appear to be woefully
limited, with the result that the opening promises
to be choked with sheer litter. Many of the dramatic
spasms presented lately have had no quality of work-
manship to recommend them. Actors of some ability
come from the legitimate stage, with playlets to try-
on the dingo that are utterly hopeless to begin with
-—bald, brainless, humorless stupidities, without even
the coarse, knoek-about mirth that may save a tum
form the ultimate depths of dulness. Give music-
hall audiences a short, sharp play, that has a rattling
idea, one striking situation, some decisive character-
drawing, a good caricature and a fair seasoning of
humor, and they love it.
A DANGER TO ENGLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. George Edwardes has been compelled to insert
a clause in his agreements with actresses prohibiting
them from marrying while under engagement to him.
He has taken this course in order to prevent the in-
convenience caused by actresses quitting the stage
whilst a play is running. —Daily ray.
George Edwardes, must this really be,
And can you then afford
To flout the aristocracce,
You who so love a pedigree,
And venerate a lord?
Reflect, sir, what it means like this
To bar the ballet girls
From rushing to connubial bliss.
’Twill knock the census all amiss,
And block our dukes and earls.
Now how are men in highest spheres
To be with equals mated,
If you withhold the dancing dears?
Why, hang it, man, the House of Peers
May be depopulated.

HOW “ANTINEURASTHIN”
REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food —not a
drug stimulant.
It is a food that feeds the whole of the nervous
system with those elements the lack of which in the
structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition.
It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully absorbed, thus creating quickly a renewed
mental and physical vigor. This is not mere stimu-
lation, but is really the sensation produced by the
actual assimilation and storage of those refined ele-
ments necessary to nerve comfort and vigor. This
is not —as in the case of tonics and stimulants—a
mere transient whipping up, but an actual addition
to the nerve structure and nerve strength of the in-
dividual. A FREE trial

plaints, and containing analysis of Antineurasthin,

Concerning an early Victorian: The San
Francisco Newsletter, of August 9, 1869,
had the following respecting George Francis
Train, who was a Melbourne merchant,
1853-’55:—
George Francis Train, that incomprehensible com-
pounded agglomeration of impudence, brass, conceit,
egotism, vanity, insolence, ignorance, shrewdness,
cunning, cupidity, vulgarity, buffoonery, obscenity,
infidelity—the intellectual eunuch, the oratorical har-
lequin, the verbal limber-jack, the financial burnt-
cork clown, the political dancing-monkey—that
social eruption that keeps the epidermis of the civil-
ised portion of the human race in a constant state of
irritation—that perambulating moral cancer that is
eating out the life and patience of two hemispheres
—-that universal pedlar of stale fish, whose mental tin
horn sternly vexes the ear of the world—the insuffer-
able bore and ineffable blatherskite—is still holding
forth in San Francisco before gaping multitudes,
who accept his senseless balderdash for wisdom be-
cause thev do not understand it, take his insolence
for bluntness, his buffoonery for wit, his ranting for
eloquence, his sickening, self-laudation for independ-
ence. Stockton Gazette (our contemporary) is fair
—very fair—but mistaken. The audiences of Mr.
Train accept that gentleman’s eloquence for nothing
of the kind. They go to look at him for the same
reason that they go to North Beach to see the nasty
bears and monkeys. George Francis is amusing, and
if our people keep a tight grip on their noses, per-
fectly inoffensive.

George Train stated that the English were a nation
of drunkards and prostitutes. Mrs. Jones, of Pros-

country-women by collaring the blackguard in public

EDISON
RECORDS
Eleonora de Cisneros, the world-famous con-
tralto, has made a series of Amberol Concert
Records of some of her most popular songs
for the Edison Phonograph.
Her exquisite performances for the Edison,
in the rendition of such fine numbers as “Ben
Bolt,” “Home, Sweet Home,” “The Rosary,”
and “O Wert Thou in the Cauld Blast,” have
all substantiated the claims made, that the
contralto possesses one of the richest and
most beautifully sympathetic voices on the
operatic stage to-day.
Call on the nearest Edison dealer and have
him play these de Cisneros Records for you.

B. North: “She rang like hell” (or per-
haps it is “rang the bell”), “and the white-capped
nurse entered softly, bringing tights and a skunk.”
Or perhaps you are trying to say that she brought
lights and a drink. Anyhow, it doesn’t matter. No-
thing matters to a person who writes a hand like
yours....A.G.M.: Your suggestion that The Bulle-
tin should take up the cause of the British suffra-
gette to hand. But Britain is a good way off, and
this paper isn’t sufficiently swelled about the head to
imagine that anything it could say at such long
range would have very much influence. It seems
like attacking your enemy with an axe at a range
of 100yds. However good the weapon may be within
its own radius it has its limitations.... G. M. Lob-
ban : There is no market in all this vast Common-
wealth for such verse as “The Cruise of the Rangi-
tira.”... . Jiggi: Beautifully written set of gags, but
otherwise deplorable Orara: Curse the beach
worm. It is not often we speak thus
harshly of one of God’s dumb creatures, but
there has been such a flood of copy re worms, of late,
and the subject of worms and their ways is so soon
exhausted, that the thing is getting on our nerves.
We have arrived at such a pass that we don’t want
to see or touch or read or hear about a worm for
months. .. .The Caretaker: Your reputation as a
teller of plain, unvarnished fact is under a cloud.
The verses you mention did not appear in the issue
you name, so how can we be expected to believe that
you sorted them out of garbage tins in New York ?
. .. . J.F.I-I.: “Tats” is a solid piece of fairly correct
I rhyming which is of no use to man, beast or devil.
Please note the fact particularly that it is no use to
devil.. . .Maod: Davis and Moore are not “young”
Celtic poets, anyhow. Your verses are bad, and you
haven’t in the least gripped the other fellow’s idea.
Besides, Guiterman’s statement is somewhat true, as
you would know if you had any idea what you were
talking about.... Heavenly Twins: We absolutely de-
cline to have our leg pulled. The verses you send
are the sort which might be produced by a depraved
cow. Two depraved cows in collaboration could have
done better.... Aulus: Two stanzas seem worthy to
live:—
But what can we do with a man like this?
He holds them all up to fun,
McGowen has to crawl, and cringe, and kiss,
Or he will lose his majority of one.
I would suggest a riddance by a terrible measure,
A tug-of-war between parties,
Wade would chuckle with fiendish pleasure
At McGowen’s Heave IIo, my hearties.
.... Whiskers: A sad, sad story, which is of no more
use than a drayload of empty oyster shells to a be-
sieged city P.W.B.: Faulty verse, with nothing
new in it....Casual Avenue: Very wicked story,
wickedly told. A hero who open’s other people’s let-
ters ought to be attacked by an infuriated policeman,
not made love to by a Spanish lady with Irish eyes.
....Karl Austerweal: You’re an Australian “rough
wntter” all right, but we certainly think this bit
worth printing:—
A beam of light through the open door;
On the face of a man did stream:
As my friend from the room did soar,
My pocket book I screamed.
And now I learnt a lesson
Expensive though it be,
I’ll never go a messen
With cobbers, I ne’er before have seen.
....D.M.: If you are as bad as that at the age of
16, what tears you will shed by the time you are 37.
... .C.H.H.: Too dull for genuine drunk verse. .. .F.
(Honolulu) : Is there no post office in your country?
Don t weep about it in verse, but send your sub-
scuption P.F.: “Drops that fall through the
years has nothing of special interest or distinction.
. . . . H.E. (Rockhampton) : No scent of humor can be
found in the verses, although the office bloodhound
tried for an hour to get on the trail Barney:
Dreadful verses Anderides: Dull as a beauty
actors private conversation Longy: Each poem
is worse than the other, and both are much worse
than either. .. .Phil Austral: Information that “it
was Spring again noted. If the season affects you
like that, how you must suffer in the Summer!
UV.K. - Delicate verses, which get nowhere
Loyalty: “Careless Immigration” cheered up the
office on a dull day. How’s this for gladness?—
Australia thou wert once so fair,
And still might be,
If only the Government would exercise a little care
In this immigration policy.
Touting in England is a snare
Which many to their bitterness see
When Australian Soil they touch, then stare
To find the streets not really paved with Gold.
;. .T. Gibcat: Your description of “A Musical Evening”
is more awful than anything which could possibly
™ e „been sung thereat Languid Lou: “In a Boot
®“°P Alls us with pity. We wept some tears into
the basket, but nothing could soften our pain....

The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kit'd has ever achieved such
a reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contributed to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatogen bv the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefits they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press and Circular states “has
strengthened the physician’s hsnd a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick —Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
wtiich it rapidly restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action. By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combination with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system—it feeds the brain and
ne ves, it improves the condition of the blood, it helps
the stomach todigestother food, and it thereby develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that delightful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered the disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the possibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy —Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole systbm takes on a feeling of
buoyancy, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual.
Sanatogen’s merits have not only been eulogistd
by the medical press, and by the medical profession,
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the bes -
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has wrought in their cases.
Sanatogen may be obtained from all chemists.

Andrew Wilson. Please mention this paper, and

HOTELKEEPERS
PROFITS
and How to Enlarge Them.”
No. 1.
“Two ways of making more money are: —•
“ ( 1 ) Increasing your output.
“(2) Cutting down expenses.
“You may not be able to do the former, but I can tell you how to
perform the latter. If you’re in the habit of sending to the manufac-
turer for your aerated waters —you’re on the wrong track. He charges
you just about 500% more for your cordials than you can. make them
yourself, using a Nelson Carbonating Machine.
“There is absolutely no reason why you should not reap the
great harvest of profit that these machines yield. They are like a hard-
working partner who has no share in the pay : roll; they can make money
faster than the shrewdest business-head; their capacity knows no limit.
“To operate thena. is simplicity itself," and far cheaper than you
are likely to imagine'; their up-keep (with proper use) is nil. They
are manufactured on the most modern lines, and are the most satisfac-
tory machines that money can buy.
“You need neyer fear breakdowns or any trouble at all. Being
built of the finest materials, by experts, they are absolutely dependable.
“I can fit you up with a machine from £25, and will grant you terms
if you wish. I will personally see to it that you are pleased, should
you order. Meantime, write in for further particulars of these Car-
bonating Machines —I shall give you any details you want.”

The N.S.W. Truck Deficit.
The commission which has been inquiring
into the shortage of trucks, etc., in N.S.W.
has unearthed some interesting facts. The
bitterness all through the State, and especi-
ally at harvest and shearing times, is that
there are not nearly enough vehicles to go
round, or that they don’t go round fast
enough. ; Farmers are often months behind
contract-delivery time in consequence, and
lose money all the while. The average num-
ber' of trucks supplied varies from 10 to 30
per cent, of those ordered. In one case men-
tioned a wheat buyer ordered six trucks a
day, and got 10 in three weeks. Meanwhile,
the wheat has to be stacked, and the farmer
has to pay for space and also for stacking.
At Barmednian, right in the centre of the
wheat-belt, a man who was just craving to
load four trucks a day, obtained 55 trucks
in 108 working days and none on Sundays.
Even when the trucks are secured the farmer
never knows how long they are going to take
to get to Sydney. Some recent performances
—-averages for the first four months of this
year—are as follows: Temora to Sydney,
•U days’; from Wyalong, 31 days; Corowa,
4i days’; Manilla, 31 days. That is not
counting Sundays. If Sundays are counted
in, the average goes up. Thus a train from
Corowa, 409 miles from Sydney, taking 41
days, maintains an average speed of 3| miles
per hour, and from Bathurst the average is
41 miles per hour. And this waste of time
and money will continue as long as every-
thing is dragged to Sydney. The goods yards
in that city are only capable of holding 116
trucks. When they get full a bloated arma-
ment of trucks is formed at Clyde, where
they have to wait their turn. And when
Clyde gets full, as it sometimes does, traffic
from all stations is stopped, and wheat lies
and rots, and trucks loaf idly qn sidings. At
times there are as many as 200 trucks wait-
ing at Clyde. When several other harbors
are opened up and lines built to them, this
congestion will cease, till then it will get
worse and worse as more land is settled.
The truck shortage isn’t really caused by the
truck insufficiency. It arises through the
last and boundless length of time the truck
takes to get to Sydney at the rate of 44
miles per hour, unload, and return at the
rate of 4J miles per hour for a new cargo.
And that is caused by the congestion at and
around Sydney, and that is caused by the
struggle to drive the trade of 310,000 square
miles to one port. Probably if the number
of trucks were doubled, the vehicles would
congest so much more that they would take
twice as long to get back for their next
load, and then the old trouble would be as
bad as ever.
“Wonga” makes a few remarks: —
For years now a wrangle has been in progress in
those places where sheep, goats, etc., do most abound
anent the fate of the Pasture Protection Boards. The
latter, which took the place of the old Stock Boards,
have, been, for a long while, regarded as useless ex-
crescences by a big proportion of the cookies, who
think that their work, such as it is, could be done
for less money by the shire councils. On the other
hand, the big landowners want them not only to be
retained, but to be given greater powers. In their
eyes the Boards have virtue, inasmuch as they repre-
sent about the last remnant of the good old days
when “property” had the commanding vote. Amid
the wordy warfare that has been raging among the
bucolics, no one seems to have paid any attention
to the interests of that good old entity, the General
Public. Yet the General Public, and more especially
the section which lives up-country and eats local
meat, had a peculiar interest in the matter. The
P.P. Boards boss the stock inspector. That is to
say, they pay his wages. But he is also under the
Government, and cannot be dismissed without the
consent of the Minister. Experience has proved,
however, that where an inspector is obnoxious to the
Board, he is invariably “outed.” The Board repre-
sents the stock-owners and is composed of stock-
owners. The inspector is the chap who has to keep
an eye on diseased stock. And stock-owners are not
pleased at having their stock diagnosed as “diseased.”
The inspector, if he would keep on good terms with
his employers, must move warily—too warily, in fact,
for public safety. Any man, not of independent
mean?, whose job consists of censoring his bosses’
products, is Unhappily situated. Many rough-and-
ready stock-owners consider that a piece cut from
a “lumpy jaw” bullock is quite harmless. How is
the conscientious inspector to retain the confidence
of that reckless type, and at the same time guard the
public health by condemning a diseased beast, or
promptly reporting anthrax, and causing the infected
district to suffer the loss and inconvenience of quar-
antine? The stock inspectors should be given a
chance to do their duty fearlessly—that is to say,
they should be made responsible to no one but the
Chief Inspector of Stock. Also, the Minister might
see that they are men who have a thorough knowledge
of their vitally important duties, and pay them
sufficient to obviate any necessity of eking out their
allowance by sojourning for long periods at the
homesteads of stock-owners.
Deak Bulletin, —When Arclibish. Kelly
has quite done talking Archbosh about
“mixed” marriages, and trying to keep one
Australian out of every five or six from
having anything to do with the other four
or five, he might answer these few questions
and make us all feel more comfortable —or
more uncomfortable :
(1) Does he know a- Romish animal answering to
the name of Motu Proprio Decree?
(2) Was one of these animals promulgated at the
beginning of the year, and does it bite Australiat
• (3) Does this animal' automatically, and immedia-
tely excommunicate and deprive of the right of
“spiritual benefits” any Roman Catholic who takes
any steps, directly or indirectly, in a civil or a
criminal matter to bring any clerical person before
a civil or State court?
(4) If any Attorney-General, or Crown Solicitor,
or Crown Prosecutor, or Police Prosecutor, or Judge
takes any ordinary (or extraordinary) legal steps
against any clerical person, does Motu Proprio bite
him ?
(5) If any base Protestant brought a suit against
any clerical person under the forbidden conditions,
and if the jury were, or happened to be, largely, or
partly, Roman Catholic, would the jurymen not he —-
er — reluctant to bring in a verdict against any cleri-
cal person t Also, if they did bring in such a ver-
dict, would the Motu Proprio anim&l bite them?
(6) If this animal was promulgated at the be-
ginning of this year, and if- it does bite Australia,
will Archbishop Kklly kindly say what effect, legal
or moral. Motu Proprio is supposed to have on his
followers ?
(7) —And last, my beloved hearers!— Are the
R.C.’s of Australia hound by the law of Australia, or
by the animal named like a Latin creallure of one
kind or anotherf
I hope there will not be a rush of clerical
persons to “explain.” Questions need only
an, answer. —Yours, Petronius Earbiter.

KATOOMBA
The Metropolis of the Blue Mountains.
FAR from the City’s smoke and turmoil, Katoomba, with its keen, crisp
air, is an ideal resort for health or pleasure. A matter of two hoars’
journey, the train, on its way through the mountains, carries me
through one of the most magnificent scenic panoramas in the world. Deep
gullies with a wealth of ferns and foliage, lie on the left hand far below
the traveller, whilst in dim distance on the horizon may be discerned the
soft, hazy lines of the City. Katoomba is the most convenient centre of many
Mountain Sights, such as the Leura Falls, the majestic Katoomba Falls, the
Valley of the Grose, with its gorgeous sunsets and bewildering color con-
trasts, the Federal Pass, and other famed beauty spots—all of which may
be easily visited on foot.
The Tourist who desires to enjoy his sojourn to the utmost will find in
the “Carrington” —Katoomba’s finest Hotel—a pleasant, comfortable base
equipped with all modern conveniences. Provision has been made for 120
guests, and no expense spared on details that would tend to increase the
pleasure of the visit. Since its inception, the “Carrington” has always been
patronised by all Vice-Regal Representatives. The Bedrooms are beautifully
furnished and lighted from the “Carrington’s” own Electrical Plant; a
Luxurious Lounge, Drawing and Music Rooms, occupy a large section of
the first floor, and a well-appointed Billiard Room provides a source of
amusement for the Gentlemen. At a cost of over £5OOO an up-to-date Bar
has been installed, facing the street. The Kitchen of the “Carrington” is
superintended by an expert Chef, and the cuisine is as perfect as one could
wish. In the Summer months the “Carrington” is ventilated in a thorough
manner. A modern Garage is a feature of the “Carrington,” designed for
the use of Touring Motorists. Equipped with every Motor need ; each Car
kept under separate lock and key. The “Itala” Cars used on the Caves
trip are stalled here.
Summer Tariff, extending from November to April, is £3/10/- per week,
or 12/6 per day. Winter Tariff, from May to October, £3/3/- per week, or
10/- per day. These charges cover full attendance, etc.

accordance with Medical instructions. High Frequency, Electric Light,
Vapor and Electric Baths.
DAILY MOTOR TRIPS TO THE
JENOLAN CAVES.
The Jenolan Caves, 47 miles away, are visited every day from the

IN
BANANA LAND
“Swagman” dumps Matilda and tells of a
petrified town he knows: Boolburra is its
sleeping label, and its hiding-place is the 7
valley of the Dawson River iC.Q.). Twenty-
five years ago this secluded spot was in-
habited by live aboriginals. To-day it is the
silent abode of a partially-dead white com-
munitv. About 150yds. from the leaning
shanty which does duty as a post office
dreams the local cemetery. I guess it must
be the largest graveyard in the world, for it
has no boundaries of its own, and, therefore,
extends to the fence of the next cemetery
somewhere over the horizon. Some of the
graves are divided from the living world by
a small picket fence; but others are not so
cramped. As I gazed and mused on the
friendliness of the underground townspeople,
a lethargic grey' ’gelding chafed hjs itchy
lower jaw on the “"wooden erbss .that leant
above the resting’place of a pioneer, and
sneezed twice before taking a tuft off grass
from the .mound with large, yellow teeth.
Boolburra possesses a church, and the resi-
dents have planted their cattle-dip less than
50 paces from the door. The result is that
the officiating clergyman has to hold the ser-
vice with one hand and his nose with the
other. At frequent intervals the metropolis
is inundated by the flood-waters of the Daw-
son. Then and only then do the burghers
become animated and shift their feet. From
the high ground they look down mournfully
on the spires and domes, and wait ; for the
waters to subside. When dry times arrive
again they return and shovel out the stink-
ing sediment from the art gallery, theatre,
museum ano Hall of '’Victory. 4 Boolburra
has no hotel,; An adventurer once attempted
to establish a grog shop, but the school-
master said that it would poison the morals,
of the children. The residents, thinking
“morals” was the technical term for
“bowels,” sternly refused the freedom of th£
city to the poison vendor or snake-in-the-
glass. So he departed and became a revolu-
tionist in Central America.
To Northward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To Northward far where the sunrays shiver
On brown sand beaches and vine-clad tree,
In deep, lone valleys there runs a river,
Through sun and shadow, towards the sea.
And there the palms with their regal crown-
ing—
Their wealth of trailing blossoms hung,
With the spent bloom drooping above and
drowning
Stand, as thev stood when the world was
young.
(With never the smoke of a grimy steamer,
And never the churn of a driving screw;
The white crane out on the sand, a dreamer,
The brown hawk poised in the boundless
blue.)
The vine-clad heights, with the pine trees
lifting
Their stately heads to the winds always,
Or the barque of a native fisher drifting'
Around a bend in the waning days.
And there the days bring forth no dangers
To the wild shy life in the flowering trees;
And there the gulls and the deep sea rangers
Come for rest from the stormy seas.
(A water hen from the rushes peeping,
A wild duck sporting, that takes no heed
Of the suaden sound of a mullet leaping,
The splash of a falling mangrove seed.»
The morn is a dainty bridesmaid, dressing
Her golden hair for the hallowed day ;
The sunset falls like a mother’s blessing,
And sheds its gold on the broad tide why.
And then the night, when the stars are scat-
tered — ,
A wealth of pearls in the water flung,
With dim suggestions of things that mat-
tered
In the long ago, when the heart was young.
(Only the cry of a bittern calling
Somewhere off in the tideswept ways,
The scent of a broken blossom falling—
The still sweet nights, and the dreamy days.)
The lazy tide in the river reaches,
The trailing vine and the towering tree;
And far away on the ocean beaches
The drowsy boom of the dreamy sea.
QUEENSLAND.
Francis Kenna.
Australian Ladies Blackmailed.
PARDONABLE INDISCRETION. HEAVILY
AVENGED.
A woman* who has once committed a certain very
natural apd pardonable indiscretion is ever after-'
wards at the mercy of her own act, unless she learns
—as will be shown in a moment —how to free her-
self.
It is a very obvious figure of speech to say that
any lady who, afflicted by, superfluous hairs on face
or arms, once uses a depilatory or cuts off the hairs
with scissprfj or a razot, can only be freed from the
effects in one way, ; Unless it is treated again and
again with the cutting steel or the burning paste or
fluid, it will crop out again and again and humiliate
her by its degrading, masculine appearance. Just as
a human blackmailer must be paid again and again,
so this silent blackmail of superfluous hair must be
dealt with again and again.
The only escape is by destroying the enemy at the
root: and this caff only be accomplished in one way.
She must send for a self-acting electrolyser which
Mme. Tensfeldt, 120 a Princes Street, Edinburgh,
Scotland, has invented specially for the benefit of
ladies who cannot go to her for treatment. This
apparatus, which only costs £5 55., carriage paid,
will dissolve painlessly the root of every individual
hair. The hair cannot possibly reappear on the same
root: and this work is quite sample and painless.
When the apparatus has done its work it can be
sent back, and 255., the second-hand value, will be
returned in exchange for it, provided this is done
within six months.*
“St. Nick”: Note that “Don Q.” (B.
12/9/T2) says two or three wild things
about a deputation that interviewed Digby
D. regarding a certain stupid law passed
ere the time was ripe. I likewise ob-
serve that he is on the wrong scent.
The deputation did not ask that the
law should be absolutely repealed. What
they desired was that a law similar, but
hardly so drastic, should be made uniform
over Australia. They pointed out the fool-
ishness of demanding that all boots should
be all leather. F’rinstance, ladies evening
shoes and certain classes of house slippers.
Also, they showed that, whereas the Queens-
land retailer could not sell certain boots
under the Queensland Act, his Queensland
customer qould write to N ; .S.W- or arty other
State, for that matter, and obtain tljem by
post. As a matter of fact, the deputation
was merely a living witness of the neces-
sity of passing the Commonwealth Referenda
proposals without further delay, and of the
fact that hasty legislation is not a special
perquisite of the Labor party, as Liberal
organs have A habit of shudderingly inti-
mating to the unsophisticated person who
owns terraces of houses.
THE THING THAT
REMAINED.
HUMOROUS TEAMSTER (to his
mate): “These ’ere motor-cars has come to stay all right. Eh? "
Maryborough (Q.) buried old William
Southerden, the other recent day, setat. 81,
one of its oldest inhabitants. He helped to
build up that rather unassuming town on
the Mary—that is to say, he lived in it, said
it was a good place, and waited for it to
grow. Southerden. was all the things, that
gladden the heart of the usual “local citi-
zen”—from Mayor in ’67 to trustee of the
burial ground. He formed one of the first
Gympie gold escort, which brought the metal
to Maryborough as set forth on page one of
the history of those parts.
The other day representatives of the com-
bined unions of Queensland, assembled in the
Trades Hall forwarded to Prime Minister
Asquith copies of resolutions condemning
the Industrial Peace Bill, and asked the
British Premier to request Governor Maegre-
gor to withhold his assent to the same. This
is a poor attempt at aping the imbecility of
Premier Jack Verran, who also clamored for
British interference with the self-governing
rights of S. Aus. some time ago. Is the Q.
Labor crowd so purblind as to be unable to
see that if Asquith were so demented as to
comply with their request a Tory Prime
Minister of England might similarly meddle
with Q. Labor legislation in the interests of
Fat on some future occasion?
The Mount Morgan branch line is no
longer the best paying in Queensland. It’s
23 miles still give the good return of £lO
3s. lid. per mile, but the steel track from
Stewart’s Greek to Ayr, 44 miles, has scored
£l3 4s. lid., and easily heads the list.
Charters Towers to Ilughenden comes third
with £lO ss. 3d. It is to be noted that the
best dividend payers are not in the south-
east corner of the State where the Queen-
street Ministry spreads its blankets. Trav-
elling is comfortable in that region, but it is
where the public bones are rattled over in-
different tracks in carriages of the dog-box
type that the cash is earned which Drings up
the railway average. Bananaland has in-
creased its lines by 1128 miles in five years,
apd has now a total mileage of 4266. Also,
the total proportional returns are not as
good as they were.
“Kobbi”: Somebody in Winton’s Shire
Council (Queensland) got the idea from the
Chapzander mission, or somewhere, that the
show was not being run on sufficiently godly
lines. He moved, accordingly, that the
weekly squabble be opened with prayer, “as
was done by other Parliaments.” But the
western person has got out of the habit of
praying, and he resented the proposal to
delay the row between Councillor Tonks and
Councillor Beef by even so much as the time
spent in asking the Almighty to see fair
play. Also, he argued that a Shire Council
was a more or less reputable institution, and
had no right to be bracketed with Parlia-
ments and other affairs that badly needed
praying for. The proposal was bumped out
with enthusiasm.
Rock: Nobody seems really to know
whether Kenneth McDonald Grant, of Rock-
hampton, late Minister for Public Instruc-
tion, fell or was pushed. But quite a num-
ber of people think he was pushed, and that
the Queen-street push pushed him.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 21, 1912.
My Dear Tiiargom indaii, —
The Macgregor returned from his jaunt
to Blaekall on Tuesday, bringing. with him
his chieftainess, as is the way with leaders
of this clan. He attended the function,
observance, celebration or shivoo at the
United Service Institution the same even-
ing. On Friday, he opened the show at
Nerang, and to-day (Saturday) the new
Sandgate Town Hall claimed his attention.
And yet there are disloyal sneerers who
hint that Governors don’t work!
Miss Forrest, the younger daughter of
E. B. Forrest, of this region, was married
to Southwell Lord at Suva, Fiji., on Sep-
tember 6. The Bishop of Polynesia at-
tended in all his glory to weld the chains of
matrimonial gladness, and one Langton gave
moral support to the 6ft. 2in. of bridegroom.
There were no bridesmaids, but the bride
worried through in a lace frock under a hat
adorned with yellow roses.
On Wednesday, owing to an incorrect
rumor, or an error of judgment,, or an in-
different guess or something, a large and ex-
pectant crowd gathered at St. Stephen’s
Cathedral to see Phil Forrest and Kathleen
Real permanently hitched under ecclesiasti-
cal sanction. Bitter was the disappoint-
ment when it was discovered that the happy
pair had dodged the eyes of the curious, and
that the said hitching was already all over.
It seems that at 2 p.m. Judge and Mrs.
Real, son Eddy and the daughter bride-lady,
together with Mrs. Forrest and the bride-
groom, and all the absolutely necessary
bridesmaids, groomsmen, best men, clerics
and paraphernalia had wandered into the
place of prayer and wandered forth again in
less than a quarter of an hour with the
whole business transacted. It leaked out
that the bride’s wedding garment was of
Limerick lace and liberty cr@pe, that Miss
Feez and Miss Mann, of Sydney, were the
female accomplices,: and that Roy Murray
and Ted Real helped the groom to bear up
under the stress of the ecclesiastical warn-
ing. The central male person in the observ-
ance presented the lady of his choice, and her
girlish support with diamond trifles set in
simple platinum.
Mrs. J. R. Sankey and her sister, Miss
Brown, worked like the forwards of a League
football team on Thursday, when a coin tea
in aid of the Alexandra Home for destitute
children was held at Mrs. Sankey ? s, pretty
house. In spite of the ungentle and over-
grown zephyrs which sprayed the charitable
enterprise with grit, some £lO was acquired,
and the kiddies in whose interests the cash
was extracted had the time of their lives at
a picnic which was held next day to eat up
the remains of the feast.
On Wednesday afternoon the collective
mother and aunt of the Boys’ Grammar
School arrived in wind-swept parties on the
more or less historic green, and watched the
annual sports with an interest keen but pen-
sive. Cheery little Mrs. Bousfield flitted
about through the throng, and a horde of
flappers from the Girls’ School descended
upon the place of athletic battle and urged
the combatants on to victory, or glory, or
second-wind, or something.
On Friday the Girls’ School itself got on
the warpath, held its annual dance, aired its
best frock, and grew giddy and glad, while
each tender bud swayed in the arms of the
male flapper person of her special choice.
Miss Wilkinson looked dignified in white
crgpe de chine, and the staff wore its party
frock with a grace and charm that dulled
the brightness of the other decorations.
On Tuesday, death came along to claim
Mrs. Miller, wife of banker Miller of our
hamlet. Young, popular, handsome, happy,
it seems as if the grim old person with the
antiquated reaping machine had called her
out of her turn, and two little Australian
children are left without a mother.
To-day (Saturday), the Yachting Club’s
season opened and the river was crowded
with every variety of craft, from paddle-
wheel steamers, whose splash was out of
all proportion to their go, to flying yachts
with their acrobatic crews hanging far out
to balance the swelling sails, and chattering
motor-boats that skipped and zigzagged, care-
less of wind and tide. Nautical costume was
the order of the day on everything afloat,
and on the breakwater a fluttering array of
summer frock shook itself to the breeze.
There were some collisions, bumps and
things, but only a little paint was damaged,
and nobody suffered from anything worse
than the excitement of an expected ship-
wreck which didn’t come off.
The gallant Commercial Travellers have
again allowed a selection of womenfolk to
enter their sacred and baggy portals. The
occasion was a concert at which Mrs. Lee
sang one or two songs, and veteran Joe
Bottger explained his desperate and brigand-
ish propensities in a tuneful voice.
Lena Conly, the third of a series of de-
pressing concert artistes, has been warbling
here this week. She sang mostly to empty
benches, as did Cisneros and Lalla Miranda.
Sally (I mean Kirkby) Lunn will be with
us next week, and, judging by the booking,
should be the most successful of the quar-
tette. This place is apt to wilt under too
liberal supplies of vocal genius.
Yours, amid the turmoil of wealth and
fashion,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Kobbi”: After the general strike in
Queensland the Government felt so pleased
with its John Hop that it swore by several
gods, into the ear of every reporter, that it
would make his lot happy and see that he
became the best paid Dunn in all Australia.
The bloke in the uniform was elated, and in
sheer joy bought a new pair of boots or a
motor-car or a crayfish, or something, and
waited with a glad heart to see his new and
inflated price posted in the Estimates. When
that document duly arrived, the force
dashed nearlv arrested it on a charge of act-
ing in a way calculated to disturb the peace
and provoke anarchy and bloodshed. It
read this way :
(1) A Commissioner’s salary, raised from £BOO
to £lOOO.
(2) Chief inspector, raised £5OO to £6OO.
(3) New billet, senior inspector, £5OO.
(4) Four first-class inspectors, £450 (a rise of
£5O).
(5) Three first-class sub-inspectors, £340 (a rise
of £4O).
(6) Four second-class sub-inspectors, £290 (a
rise of £4O).
(7) Five third-class sub-inspectors, £250.
Then this: “In the non-commissioned ranks
increases are provided which will bring the
men well up to the rates paid in NEW
SOUTH WALES.
If you can afford it, writing plays, taking a
theatre, and producing the literary goods at your
own risk and expense is as good and pleasant a
hobby as stamp collecting, or suburban gardening,
or chronically watching cricket and football matches.
There is a man in England named W. H. G. Nation,
who has been practising this hobby for close on half
a century, and he is still going strong. At latest
he was in possession of Wyndham’s Theatre, London,
where he was running a couple of his peculiar plays
in the presence of skimpy; audiences. Nation rather
fancies himself as a song-writer, and on his present
bills and posters he prints the titles of a dozen of
his songs with the words “By W. H. G. Nation”
after each. His name thus figures on his posters no
less than 15 times, which must be a bit of a record.
It was in 1866 that he started management at Sad-
ler’s Wells, the North London theatre where William
Hoskins (afterwards of Australia) gave the stage-
struck youth, Henry Irving, his first lessons in the
mummer’s art. Nation knew Charles Kean, Samuel
Phelps and that old-time Australian idol, G. V.
Brooke. “These three,” he says, “could not be
matched at the present day. And in comedy we
have no one man who could compare with Buckstone.”
He deplores the change in the public’s taste and the
lack Of interest in the serious drama. Nation is a
wealthy Devonshire squire and a lord of the manor.
He enjoys his rural delights for nine months of the
year, and then he comes to London, takes any theatre
that happens to be available, and runs a season of
two or three months with limited success and a smat-
tering of applause. The list of his plays is tremend-
ously long, and in addition he has published a score
or two of books. London Chronicle starts an inter-
view by describing him as “poet, author, artist,
dramatist, theatrical manager and country gentle-
man.” Nation’s interest in the theatre is hereditary, for
it was his grandfather who discovered Edmund Kean
(then an almost unknown barn-howler), and en-
abled him to achieve his first great success at the
Exeter Theatre. From the Exeter his fame soon
spread to London and beyond.

ALE •
The Wine of the Barley.
FOR countless generations Ale has been a favorite beverage.
It was drunk in Egypt 3000 years before the Christian
era; it was known and appreciated by the ancient Gauls;
it was the favorite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and
is still the premier drink of the most alert and active peoples of
the world. It was the drink of the lusty and strong, the “doers”
in the history of the past.
Cascade Ale is akin to the ale of old England, for.it is rich
in the qualities that promote health and strength. That its merits
are appreciated by those most competent- to judge is proved by
the rapidly-growing sales in every part of the Commonwealth.
Sold at all first-class hotels and stores.

AS its name implies, the Silent Em-
pire runs so freely and smoothly
that there is absolutely no noise
from it —and the amazing steadiness of
the projected pictures is due to the
Maltese Cross attachment fitted to this
high-grade, yet economical, Biograph.
The operator may have perfect confidence
in it, because it is fireproof-—simple and
easy to manipulate—strong and rigid—
reliable and durable. Write for further

It is not always the best looking watch
that gives the greatest satisfaction. A
smart looking case does not necessarily
mean Timekeeping Quality. Accuracy and
reliability of movement or works, and the
reputation of its makers should have first
consideration.
The discriminating buyer has a way of
looking deeper than the outward finish of a
watch. He is not misled merely by pretty
outward appearance.
Over 25,000,000 discriminating Buyers in
England, America, Canada, Germany,
and South Africa, and in almost all
parts of the Globe, have tried and tested
Ingersoll Watches
and have found them exactly as represented by the makers. Thfe most
practical, economical and perfect watch that money will buy. Now, tor
the first time, we are able to offer Australia this wonderful scientific
production, so if you are ready for a cheap watch and believe that 6/6
entitles you to a reliable timekeeper, be sure to ask for an Ingersoll, ana
look for the name on dial, and guarantee in back of case. They are
there for YOUR protection.
CROWN 6/6, ECLIPSE 8/6, JUNIOR 10/6, MIDGET 10/6.
The jewelled Trenton Watches are as eminent in quality and economy as the

“Hermes” writes: —
The Laud Mayor of Sydney is anxious to have a
clean city, but a large proportion of the citizens are
seemingly indifferent on the subject. With a view
to stirring them up, his Washup proposes' to have a
street patrol of 20 officers, who will wander round,
and grasp the delinquent who heaves a tram-ticket
on the pavement, arraign him, find him guilty, fine
him, and collect the penalty on the spot. There
are points about the scheme, although it has its
weak spots. The proposal does not go far enough.
The, patrolmen should also be Authorised Kickers.
The vehicle conductor who drives full tilt past a
stationary tram-car when the whole footboard is a
mass pf alighting women handing out children
should be seized, yanked out of his car, and kicked
hard till his nose bleeds. The indi-
vidual who stands in the middle of a narrow Svdnev
pavement, talking’ to a friend, with his stick slipped
crossways between his back and elbows should not
be spoken to, but just suddenly kicked; he might
also be fined afterwards. When a small boy just
out of knickerbockers is discovered trundling a
handcart loaded up with about 2cwt. of goods, the
name and address of the employer should be ascer-
tained, the goods confiscated, and the employer called
on and kicked. The parties of young hoodlums who
gather at tram stopping-places and corners in the
suburbs, and make remarks about girls and women
who have occasion to pass, should be charged back-
wards by Authorised Kickers, walking on their hands
and hitting out with both feet. The tout outside
the drapery shop should be kicked, and the person
who walks on the wrong side of the pavement, and
the profane individual, and the dropper of orange
peel—in fact, so many people require to be kicked
that I don’t see the end of the business.


On Face, Armsand Body. Water Blis-
ters Burst and Spread, Clothes
Stuck to Them and Caused Great
Suffering. Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment, Sores Disappeared.
“My two children (ages: girl, 10, and boy
8 years) broke out in sores on the face, arms,
and lower part of the body. The sores came
out in a kind of water blister and would
burst and then become full of matter and
would run and then spread bigger. They
caused great itching and burning and we had
to tie the boy’s hands in cloths at night to
keep him from tearing at them. Their
clothes would stick to the sores on the body
and caused great suffering.
“We took the children to a doctor and for
two months we used his remedies but they
not only did no good, but the sores got worse.
I saw in the papers of the cures effected by
Cuticura Ointment, so I got a box of Oint-
ment and the first application gave such
relief that we kept on with it. My wife used
to wash the sores two or three times a day
with warm water and Cuticura Soap and then
apply the Cuticura Ointment each time and
in a month the sores disappeared, leaving a
red blotch on the skin. We kept on with
the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
and their skins were soon free of all marks.
I think the Cuticura Ointment a wonderful
cure and feel sure that if we had not used
the Cuticura Remedies there is no telling
how long the children would have suffered.
I can safely recommend Cuticura Remedies.”

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half ’’ will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Halr=Qrowing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When 1 had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing, com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have , actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest;

“Lud”: The Times cock-a-doodle-doos over No.
40,000. Established 1788, by John Walter the First
(1739-1812). Not a printer or journalist, but an
underwriter, who lost a fortune through French cap-
ture of merchant ships. In 1803, John Walter the
Second (1784-1847), the great one, took charge of
the Times. Refused to take the foreign news
ladled out by Government to the press. Walter or-
ganised his own system. Refused an offer of exclu-
sive Government intelligence, in exchange for
consistent support. Refused almost everything.
Times printed by steam, 1814. Barnes editor in
1816, assisted by Sterling, called the Thunderer.
Delane followed Barnes. The third John Walter
took the ribbons in 1847. Good man, but not up to
the second, and the paper needed genius. The Times
was the Times up till about 1867, when it began
to be threatened with real competition, and now
what is it? A shop, like the Salvation Army. De-
lane’s time of efficiency was up when he shunted,
but the paper slumped awfully under Chenery, an
Arabic Professor, nick-named Tiglath-Pileser by
Yates in the World. After Tiglath, the proprietary
went back to something like another young Delane,
in Buckle. Now it is G. G. Robinson. Doesn’t mat-
ter. In 1906 a company took over the business,
with Northcliffe, of the Mail, as chief boss. I suppose
the paper will become the Mail-Times, or the
Times-Mail, or simply the Tail.

John Corlett wrote a farewell article when he
quitted the London Sporting Times or Pink ’Un,
which he had owned and edited for 39 of its 48
years. He mentioned that the paper paid from the
start; its capital “was a £6 note, and was never
fully drawn upon.” Also the largest verdict ever
given against it in a libel suit was one farthing, “and
the Judge said that even that was too much.” The
Pink ■’Un has lately dropped its motto, of “Old
Toryism, Old Port, High Church, and High Farm-
ingj for ever!” but it is “to be carried on on the
same lines as before.” This, if correct, means that:
(1) its pet original stories will all be of the bright-
blue or smoking-room order; (2) it will sling
savage sneers at all democratic movement; (3) It
will keep on stealing from The Bulletin without
acknowledgment.
* * * *
Lord Morley, better and more respectfully known as
plain John Morley, lately presided over a journalistic
dinner in the London Hotel Cecil. He made a pass-
ing allusion to the Commonwealth law requiring
political articles and reports at election times to
be signed with the names and addresses of the
writers. John has only a hazy idea of this law and
its scope: “On this point of anonymity he was told
the other day, and he believed it was true, that in
either the Commonwealth of Australia or one of the
provinces, they had passed some regulation to this
effect, which he commended respectfully to the at-
tention of the company, that in the period before a
general election every article should be signed.” He
gave some interesting reminiscences of the period
when he was editing London’s leading evening paper,
the Pall Mall Gazette. His assistant, understudy
and successor in that post, was W. T. Stead, of the
spook Julia and the Titanic, to whose memory he
paid a tribute. There never was, he said, a more
heroic spirit. Whether Stead made the best use of
his genius was a question which he would not dis-
cuss at the moment. But there was no doubt Stead
had a tremendous opinion of the functions of a jour-
nalist, and he showed it by . taking for his tele-
graphic address the word “Vatican.” He had really
and truly convinced himself that he could be the
centre of a new spiritual power akin to that of the
Leos and the Gregorys who had exercised world-
wide jurisdiction from the great Papal Palace in
Rome. Morley proceeded to dilate on the changes
in the journalistic world since he was promoted
straight from the editorial chair of the P.M.G. into
Gladstone’s Cabinet. On the whole, he thinks the
press has distinctly improved during recent years,
but he deprecates some of its developments. He
does not like the “flaming garish colors, the dashing
emphasis and the Brobdignagian attempts in type of
all kinds,” to which certain sensational sheets—the
Daily Mail and its numerous satellites —are prone.
He thinks the “unrest of the present age is traceable
in some degree to this sort of distracting printed
shriek.” And he uttered one pessimistic note. He
had n,ever advised anybody to take up journalism as
a profession. “It was so precarious and insecure,
so subject to the caprices of time and fortune.” Yet
there are other professions that are equally sudden.
Suppose a man brought up his son to Hooleyism!
“Linesman”: The Melbourne Herald is not what
it used to be. The closing days of many an old
dodderer in the Benevolent Asylum were once
brightened by the interest he took in solving the
puzzle-competitions which it formerly used as head-
ings. “How, When and Where” was its usual cap-
tion for a murder, and if it was not dead sure that
murder had been committed, then would it ask, in fat
black pica, “Suicide, or What?” Aforetime, nobody
ever died in the columns of that paper. They either
“passed,” like euchre players with poor hands, or
“crossed the bar,” like glasses in an hotel shindy.
At Show time, the bucolic eye of the farmer, who
had come to Melbourne for the joy of having his
boots blacked by a real night porter in a real
coffee palace, was wont to be gladdened by the
spread-head “Agricola.” The spielers and the guns
were not dead sure that it was really Gup time until
Field-Admiral Reay, then editor, had announced the
fact under the ingenious and scholarly crosshead,
“King Equus,” as evidence of his Latinity; nor
was a petitioner certain of his divorce before the
granting of the decree nisi was reported under
“Breaking the Bonds.” “Retribution” headed the
sentences handed out in the Crim. and the Sessions,
while “News and Notes in a Nutshell” was the allit-
erative frieze that decorated the summary of the
day’s happenings. “The Fire Fiend” and “The Dust
Devil,” standing headings, kept the printer’s devils
warm through many a hot summer; and no account
of a wedding was regarded as fit to pass the
eye of Mrs. Grundy until the fragrant and romantic
caption “Orange Blossoms” ratified its respectability
and ensured the sanctity of the marriage tie. No:
the Herald is not what it used to be. Even the
newsboys give it its aspirate nowadays, and on
Thursdays it runs a literary column.
TO THE EDITOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who are these mystic blighters,
These weird, fantastic writers,
Who decorate your pages every week?
We know each nom de plume
From Cooktown round to Broome,
But it’s inside information that we seek.
So will you kindly tell
Who “KODAK” is and “SNELL,”
And who the deuce “PHILANDER F.” may be?
Who grills the morning chop
For “SATAN” and for “HOP,”
Who brews “RELIGIOUS EDITOR” his tea?
You might mention, by the way,
If “0.K.” is just “0.K.,”
Some anecdotes of “WANG” and “BILLY B.”
And tell us if “MACHETE”
Is one of the elite,
And give us “CURSE O’ MOSES’ ” pedigree.
Of straight names there are plenty,
Such as ADAMS, MORTON, HENTY,
DYSON, 11. McCRAE and ROBERT BROTHERS,
And a dozen more or so,
But it’s little more we know
Of them than what we know about the others.
We should like to know what manner
Of a woman is “JOHANNA” ;
And is she of the brand that’s known as “new” ?
And if the poet BRADY
Is a man or just a lady,
And lastly, who and what and how are YOU?

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad
to hear of a simple and scientific device which will
restore your hearing, no matter how old you are.
.There is no mystery or secrecy about it; we describe
it fully and explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and in the
same way you may use this sound magnifier as an
aid to weak hearing. But, unlike spectacles, the
Wilson Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and
comfortable. You can’t tell you are wearing them.
No one else can, either, because they are not seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off
them—the strain of trying to hear dim sounds.
What a blessed relief to have done with that
tiring strain !
Being made of the purest and softest Para rubber
they cannot be felt, even when the head rests on a
pillow. For the same reason, a blow on the side of
the head will not hurt the ear. In fact, they pro-
tect the ear, the tender inner parts that are so
senstive, from cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing
sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why these
facts are true, and why the Sound Magnifier restores
the hearing, we give an illustration of one as it lies
in the ear. You will notice that the Sound Magni-
fv
fier is shaped
like a trumpet,
and so con-
veys even the
faintest sounds
right to the
natural e a r-
drum. Being
of the softest
rubber, it can-
not hurt the
ear. It fits the
orifice of the
ear with preci-
sion and com-
fort. The di-
vision that
runs across the
mouth is to al-
low the remo-
val and inser-
tion of the
Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
T h e shape
of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has
been chosen
after years of
experience a s
the best adapt-
eel to carry the faintest sound right down to the
natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not only
trying to have people shout at them, but it hurts
the ear-drum. When age comes the ear-drum some-
times gets thickened, or loses its tightness, and
shouting does not act properly on it. It only
makes a confused and tiring noise. But the
Sound Magnifiers concentrate the sound in the best
spot for perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-nerve
completely, or were born deaf, we cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could do that, in spite
of some of the absurd claims made to-day. But if
you can hear the faintest sound, do not despair.
You will never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people in
Australia and New Zealand, who have been cured,
and you can be cured, too. You may wear the Ear-
Drums day and night., and take them out whenever
you wish. Children can wear them (we have spe-
cial sizes for children from six to twelve). Even
a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they
are only sold in pairs), a fine_nickel remover and
also an inserter. After the first pair is bought you
may purchase a single drum at any time for 8s.,
but the pair you get at first will last quite
two years. Do not ask for a trial pair. We do
not send them out on trial, and so they are never
secondhand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent you at once, with the fullest
instructions. Don’t delay, but have the comfort of
good hearing as soon as you can.

HK Mtvfes ifrefe singing to the breeze,
I The hiingfy deep had claimed its owd*
J-- It was but fight it should have
fclfiimed it,
And ho ohe vefy greatly blamed it;
For ih the middle of the seas
The Ship was sitting on a stbne.
The witter foamed along the deck
Like liqhids in a pewter cup,
The purser took it rather sadly,
The first mate swore about it badly,
The cook remarked it was a wreck,
Which summed the situation up.
So wet it was, the captain said :
“Ho, bring my green umbrella aft!
And launch some boats upon the ocean,
Extravagant as seems the notion,
Some of us may be shortly dead
If we remain on this old craft.”
They launched the boats and left the
ship,
The captain only stayed behind,
He sat Upon the bridge serenely,
His large umbrella glimmered greenly,
A pleasant smile was on his lip
As if he really didn’t mind.
The boats were damp as damp could be,
And though they tried to bail them dry
They could not make the matter better,
For every moment they got wetter,
Until they foundered in the sea
And everybody had to die.
The skipper sat and smoked his pipe,
And drank his rum to keep him brave;
And when the old ship started breaking
HiS fioble thirst he still was slaking,
Hg merely said, “The time is ripe,”
And floated down a lonely wave.
This is the way things should be done;
The Wide sea teaches men to end
Ip Simple, serious, noble fashion;
Beyond all hope and all compassion
They meet the death they cannot shun
While othefs draw the dividend.

CURSE O’ MOSES.
The Thirteenth Juror.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MU. dUSTICU HARRON climbed the
sandy way up from the bathing box
on the long sickle of Hobson’s Bay
beach. To the north the red roofs of
Brightoii showed among the pines. Behind
him the sun-haze made the bay a shield of
ruffled steel. Before him the beautiful forms
of the flowering ti-tree descended to a carpet
of green and chrome-lush grass and the
yellow ribbons of the. Cape weed. Despite
the greyness of his beard, there was about
him the air of a man in his first prime. He
walked up the banks of yielding sand on
his toes; his step was springy as he reached
the level walking of the height. There he
stopped, ankle deep in the glossy, yellow
carpet, and looked at the isles of ti-tree re-
peated to infinity, shafted with sunlight and
dappled with gloom.
The old and recurrent memory came now
to spoil his holiday—a memory that was
always the skeleton of his feast —the ever
present knowledge of a betrayal that said
to him always: “Be not lifted up! For
this thing has been, and your life is failure.
He had succeeded for a week in seeming
to forget—except when alone at night, that
time and place which finds a man out, and
shows him himself as he is. _ And now he
had remembered, when enjoying the perfec-
tion of physical health, and walking in a
kind of sober intoxication at the beauty of
the world —newborn this spring. And there
was a month yet before he had to return to
his judicial work in a northern State. At
the prospect of four weeks of doing nothing
but remembering ne was almost afraid.
For memory showed him this. Himself
a struggling lawyer. The girl who meant
the world and Heaven to him, radiating sun-
shine, bringing gaiety to his study—a butter-
fly among the books. Too much a butterfly
in other ways maybe • shirking mother-
hood, spinning not nor toiling—making her
love of life a snare for life. Her name
linked —almost certainly without justice—
with a man of that growing class of doctor
who is appointed to save life and grows
rich by killing—-by murder of the human in
its blindest and most helpless stage.
And then —a discovery of his own self-
content and his immersion in work —too late.
She had said to him once: “Did you ever
read a book called ‘Too Much Alone’?” and
he had replied, with only a glance _ in her
direction: “No, my dear —life and its pro-
blems take all my waking moments. I
haven’t time for romances.”
And now, whether he would or no, he had
to find time for romance, since he had
burned his own romance unread. A hus-
band awakened too late, and a woman who
was sunshine gone to darkness when she
should have been a smiling mother with a
laughing child.
And the man who had destroyed the two
lives under cover of the license of the pro-
fession he prostituted went his way, not
only unpunished but even rewarded —rich
with the price of blood, honored as a dis-
creet and successful murderer nf the race.
Into the Judge’s eyes, as he thought of it,
came a weariness that took the youth from
him, and was suited to the greyness of his
beard.
The weariness was succeeded by fierceness
—the craving to see a credit entry against
that scoundrel whose debits were all so
black. And then Mr. Justice Harron smiled
grimly and said: “One day.”
He had been saying it for 15 years, won-
dering how he could ever meet that day;
for the mal-practitioner who had killed
Harron’s wife had let his northern practice
drift after that last exposure, and was now
mostly in Melbourne—but richer and more
successful than ever. And in a month Mr.
Justice Harron would return to his work,
and might never see his enemy again. Yet
with the strongest of hopes, which is revenge,
he said again, “One day.”
The day had come! It was to-day.
In the garden of his hired cottage near
Black Rock that night he read the morning
p a pe r —for he was half a day behind the
world —and the holiday habit left the chron-
icle of the world's pretensions and its misery
until the day had taken all he had Wofth the
giving. 1
He read cflfelessly—selecting by ittstiflct ;
and habit the law hews. “Commonwealth
High Court Appeal! Argument before
State Full Court! Judgment iU Admiralty
And theU the scare-heads caught him: —
THE MYRTLE fiOWNES INQUEST.
VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER.
bR. ANTIOCHUS COMMITTED FOR TRIAL.
Harron, with the old ache renewed in its
first agony, looked at her photograph, which
was all of home he carried with him, felt
the appeal of her wistful glance_ at him,
knew that more than half her failure had
been his own —and planned. He had yet a
month to fight in—four weeks before work
would claim him again, and this time work
would be helped by a new forgetfulness.
“lie who cannot revenge himself is con-
temptible. He who can and will not is
despicable,” said Harron.
Later on, a suburban barber had a visitor
who was unexpectedly fastidious —for that
suburb, at least; and when a beardless,
clean-shaven man left the chair the identity
of Mr. Justice Harron was lost in the super-
ficial change.
The Criminal Court Sessions opened a
week later, and the list was short. “The
King against Antiochus” commenced 10 days
after the committal for trial. There was a
heavy jury-panel, and the prisoner exhausted
his challenge early. The State challenges
were almost complete when the crier called
the name of “Henry Strange.” The clear-
cut, student’s face of Henry Strange, said to
be an iron-moulder, did not give the cue to
his occupation; his white, strong, nervous
hands looked as if they might mould men,
but not iron. But the appearance of many
men unfits their pursuits. In any circum-
stance the State had no reason to challenge
this eminently _ respectable man. And
Henry Strange, iron moulder, entered the
jury box. When the jury was invited to
elect a foreman, Strange was appointed
almost without a word. A grocer juryman
nudged a builder juryman, and, with a finger
pointed at Henry Strange, said “Him!” So
Henry Strange was appointed foreman.
The prisoner had scarcely looked at the
men who held his life in their hands. He ap-
peared nonchalant, though he may have been
afraid; but, to help him there were the ex-
periences of his own and other malpracti-
tioners —men charged with this method of
murder, which is so common as to be almost
legal, and whose proofs are so elusive as to
brake the murderer immune. Antiochus was
a pitcher who had been often to the well;
and Hope and Experience told him that he
would not be broken. He talked much to
his Solicitor, who stood deferentially by the
bars of the dock, and at short intervals
prompted his counsel; and he smiled to re-
assure himself that all the byways and loops
and side-tracks of the law were meant to
help him, and that justice was still
sleeping far away. In effect, his attitude
said: “I cannot prove myself innocent; but
I defy you to prove me guilty by the forms
of law.”
The examination in chief of the leading
witness for the State, a young man whose
attempt to rescue Myrtle Downes from con-
ventional shame had ended in her most un-
conventional destruction —was at an end.
Cross-examination shook it slightly. There
was no need for more than that. The un-
corroborated testimony of an accessory
before the fact bade fair to end in the usual
way—the failure of the State case, the
acquittal of the prisoner; congratulations,
and a new advertisement of him as a man
“safe” and immune.
And then, as the young man, who was
repentant because exposure had come for him
as a penalty of death had come to Myrtle
Downes, prepared to leave the witness box,
a new voice spoke and brought to Antiochus
his first thrill of fear.
It was a voice measured, cultured, digni-
fied —the voice of a man wbo knew his posi-
tion, privilege and responsibility—the voice
of Henry Strange, iron moulder and fore-
man of the jury. But that which made Dr.
Antiochus most afraid was that the voice
was familiar, or had been—not with the
familiarity of the voice of the man you meet
every day, or of the friend whose utterance
you could recognise after long parting, but as
a voice he seemed to have known ma,ny years
ago. _ The prisoner looked at the foreman of
the jury, but saw nothing familiar in his
face.
“A question, your Honor,” said Henry
Strange. “Witness, you went to the prisoner
before you brought Myrtle Downes to him?”
“Yes, sir.”
“How did you pay—by cheque?”
“No, sir—he refused a cheque.”
“Why? Did he give any reason?”
“Only that it could be traced. Later, I
took him the money in bank notes, and he
refused them.”
“Then how did you pay?”
“In gold.”
“Did you give him the gold while you were
in his house?”
“Yes—in the surgery.”
“Did he do anything with it?”
“He examined every sovereign under a
microscope.”
“For what reason?”
“To see if they were marked, I think.”
“I object,” said the prisoner’s counsel, and
the Judge upheld the objection; but the
prisoner knew that no objection could re-
move the answer, and felt with a new sensa-
tion of terror that the foreman of the jury
knew him—knew his ways and methods, and
had stripped his soul naked before them all.
“Just another question,” said Henry
Strange. “Did he give you a receipt?”
“No, sir.”
“That will do. Your Honor, the jury
would like the prisoner’s bankers examined,
to see what gold was paid into his account
that day.”
It was the hint oblique to the State Prose-
cutor, and he took it, despite the defending
counsel’s objection, and the statement that
all the banks in the world would prove
nothing either for or against the prisoner.
Yet, when on the second day that evidence
came, and £9O in gold were shown to have
been paid in, the - jury read it along with
the fact of two other admissions to Antio-
chus’s hospital on the day of the admission
of Myrtle Downes, and read both facts
against the prisoner. For a jury, having
little law, has much room for the deductions
of common-sense; and hangs men often be-

BARCOO ROT
One of the Terrors of Out-back.
Indescribable Torture of Bursting Blisters and
Spreading Sores.— Other Ointments Prove Useless.
MR. H. McDIARMED, of 150 Nichol-
son Street, Abbotsford, Vic., says :
“ I contracted a terrible skin com-
plaint while employed in the grape-picking
industry in the Mildura district of Victoria. The
disease which is known as ‘ Barcoo Rot,’ started in the
form of blisters, which appeared on the face and then
extended to the arms, finally spreading all over the
back. These blisters w’ould burst and then form
into the shape of ringworms. The irritation nearly
drove me mad, and I felt I could tear myself to
pieces. It was torture indescribable, for I could
not obtain a moment’s rest, and I became run-dow'n
in health, and felt depressed and despondent. I
applied an ointment, but this only increased the
irritation and caused it to spread alarmingly, thus
adding to my misery.
“I was tortured in this way for six weeks. I
gave up the idea of ever getting well again, when
Zam-Buk was recommended to me. I promptly
discontinued the ordinary ointments, and com-
menced using Zam-Buk. Immediately Zam-Buf
was applied I felt its sOothing effect, and the irri-
tation ceased. Other applications of this healing
balm brought a decided improvement in my con-
dition. It acted like a charm, and I could not —.
realise that T was fast getting better. After Using Zam-Buk fora fortnight, the sores were
all healed, new skin formed, and I was completely cured. My skin was spotless, and in
fact, I presented a better appearance than I did before I contracted this awful complaint.
My health ' is better in every way, and J never felt more fit than Ido at the present
time, which is entirely due to Zam-Buk” . :

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. : In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe, a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and'adults.

cause they are morally guilty, as well as
merely for the reason of their legal crime.
The State was never so helped before,
though the assistance came only as the legiti-
mate and impartial inquiries of a man sworn
to his duty and governed by his oath.
He was quite unprejudiced. Twice he
brought out answers favorable to the pris-
oner, even though he destroyed the effect by
the questions asked of the next witness.
And through it all he was the same dis-
passionate, judicial, evenly-balanced man
doing his duty, without fear or fayor, and
waking up the inferior minds of his 11 pup-
pets, while always sure of his own.
Antiochus began to remember the facts he
had tried to forget—an awakened public, an
angry State disgusted at its numberless
failures to convict. He felt no remorse for
the crime which had become habit, but he
began to fear the law would make a scape-
goat of him, if a jury would convict. And
he felt that conviction lay with this calm
foreman, that he was prosecutor, judge and
executioner—Outraged Morality in person
come to help Tardy Law.
He tri'Hl to catch the eye of Henry Strange
and to i -ead for pity with a glance, but could
not. The foreman did not seem to know
him but as a name. He never glanced to-
wards the dock, and apparently knew only
that its four palisades of steel held a pris-
oner.
Then Antiochus saw in this avoidance of
his glance that the foreman knew him. He
looked again and long at Henry Strange,
and tried with all his heart and soul co
remember—-yet could not. No memory
of the quiet lawyer with the pointed black
beard came to help him —no thought of one
of his many victims who had been that law-
yer’s wife. Even the judicial utterance, the
quietly used knowledge of the forms of law,
the questions that were never against the
law of evidence—these struck no answering
chord.
A laborer asking for recognition as a
prince—a clown demanding consideration as
a prophet—these are propositions to be
laughed at as he would have laughed at the
suggestion of a Judge masquerading as a
juryman. And even the suggestion never
cane to Antiochus. He could only wonder
dullv who this man was who seemed to
know his self-protective methods so well.
He scarcely heard the Judge’s summing-
up—a summing-up terribly adverse; he felt
only the presence of the real judge and the
real accuser, who was Henry Strange, iron-
moulder.
In the jury room the retirement was pro-
tracted. The foreman found two for an
acquittal and three undecided ; and he wisely
allowed the two to talk themselves out.
The view of the three undecided ones was
that many other and unarrested doctors were
equally guilty, and that Antiochus was
about to suffer for the crime of other men.
The foreman destroyed that argument with
a sentence.
“We are trying him for his own crime,”
he said. “And the evidence is beyond doubt.”
The two for acquittal had the easy moral-
ity that regards the common as the sanc-
tioned. They forgot the motive of gain, and
spoke of the kindness of the mal-practi-
tioner to women in trouble.
And then the foreman spoke leisurely, dis-
passionately, summing-up against the pris-
oner in a way that excluded argument or
denial.
“Here is a man,” he said, “who has been
twice tried for similar crimes, and has twice
escaped. He has grown rich by murder. It
was no murder of passion or intoxication;
but a calmly made and systematic plan for
gain to chance killing, while taking such
precautions in the acceptance of payment as
to make conviction almost impossible. You
will think of the disgrace of this trial; if he
is acquitted, it becomes a diploma. You
will consider him punished by the exposure
of the accusation; if it fails, it becomes an
advertisement.
“Most of us have wives and daughters.
Our ancestors made laws to protect them,
ami we assail our ancestors’ wisdom with
timidity and maladministration of the law.
Murder is not the less murder because it
takes such a form as to be almost respect-
able ; by softness to it we pave the way to
make murder more easy of commission and
more difficult of punishment. By agreeing
to regard this sort of crime easily, while the
slaying of a man by a man would fill you
with horror, you buttress the convention
that regards the foundling hospital as a pre-
mium to immorality—that despises the good
girl who keeps her love-child and works for
it, and drives the more weakly-sensitive
woman to poison or the river.”
He paused, but they were silent, and when
he proceeded, there was another presence in
the room —a presence that acted on the
waverers as a Thirteenth Juror.
“I knew one case—one of the many that
are never heard of, for a certificate of death
covers any crime. A couple happily married ;
the man devoted to his work, and so devoted
to his wife that he weakened her by keep-
ing her from the touch of the world that
makes us strong by struggling. From being
a merely happy, careless girl she became a
frivolous society woman, hating responsi-
bility. Petted and coddled as she was, had
she been a man she must have been a loafer;
being a woman, she did nothing at all but
pretend to amuse herself. She had one child,
and even that responsibility grew irksome;
she avoided motherhood; she found a scoun-
drel who, for gain, helped her avoidance.
And, gentleman, she paid the penalty. She
died.”
They were all hushed now, tensely quiet,
seeing the ghost of murder in the room—the
spirit of the woman dead before her time;
hearing the rustle of cerements and the
shroud.
“Some of you may know of such a case,”
continued Henry Strange, and they answered
him: —
“I do!”
“So do I!”
“And I do, too!”
“Then here is duty. There is no moral
doubt of the prisoner’s guilt, and no legal
doubt that can be considered. The dead ask
for our pitiless and dispassionate verdict;
the living expect protection by this verdict;
the State demands it. For ourselves, we are
sworn to do our duty without fear, favor
or affection ; and I say ‘Guilty.’ ”
Twelve jurymen brought the verdict. The
Thirteenth Juror did not accompany them,
but her vote went with them into court.
“Gentlemen of the jury—have you consid-
ered your verdict?”
“We have,” said Henry Strange.
“And what do you find?”
“We find the prisoner guilty of wilful
murder.”
“Without recommendation?”
“Without recommendation.”
The Judge put on the black cap. But the
prisoner neither looked at him nor listened
to sentence pronounced without hope of re-
prieve. He knew already. When the jury
entered, he had looked at the foreman and
i-ead Doom in his eyes.
* * * *
“The finest jury on earth,” said the State
Prosecutor. “But why not? You don’t find
a foreman like that once in a century.”
“A fine legal mind lost to the Bench,” said
his Honor.
In Westralia that day a pocket Hei’cules
of a man, who swung 141 b. hammers on in-
candescent metal as if he liked the exercise,
negotiated for a partnership in a small iron
and brass foundry. He had been paid £2OO,
and his name was Henry Strange.
In his cottage at Black Rock Mr. Justice
Harron, much more youthful looking by
reason of his clean-shaven face and almost
happy—though his eyes shone with tears —
knelt before the photograph of a woman
whose glance appealed no longer, but seemed
to praise.
“Have I done well? Are you satisfied
now?” he asked, as one expecting no reply,
of the portrait of the Thirteenth Juror.
And the man who was the pitcher that
had gone to the well once too often, won-
dered vainly for the identity of the man who
had spun his rope, trembled in the condemned
cell and shuddered for the end.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Node on the Bursting-up of
'Ome and the Marriage-Tie!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A deputation from the Council of the Churches ob-
jected to the proposed maternity bonus being made
applicable to illegitimate children.... Archbishop
Kelly said that Australia wanted more churches.
There are 614 churches of assorted brands in the
Commonwealth. -—Current news.
Recitative. —A Woman Who Did.
LOVE’S delight and lover’s folly
Bring me now to melancholy;
Sorrowfully, I move forsaken —
By pursuing Time o’ertaken;
Now the future darkens o’er me- —
Rough and hard the path before me.
Yet across the warp of sadness
Gleams a golden thread of gladness!
I but follow many another....
Not a wife, and yet a mother —
Ah !.... my child.... must I bemoan thee ?
Will the grudging world disown thee?
Innocent, bright flower of Passion,
Canst thou come in dubious fashion?.. ..
Never ! Let the scorners mock ,thee,
So I can but feed and frock thee.
I care nothing !.. . . oh, what made me ?.. . .
Surely—surely some will aid me !... .
Chorus of Federal Ministers: —
How blessed are the merciful! How worthy
are the meek!
How merry are the generous who others’
welfare seek!
The poor in heart are far, far worse than
poor in pocket are,
And meanness is a greater curse than shoddy
or “Three Star!”
We’ve tried to do a little good—we hope to
do a lot!
For some of our proposals we are catching
it red-hot!
But let’s be Liir—and do and dare —and let
the poop!- .-judge.
And, hr, i iif) once made up our minds, refuse
io bend or budge!
We've brought a little Bunus in—a helpful
kind of Bill
Intended to assist the poor, and empty
cradles fill;
And if, perchance, some Little Strangers
don’t come through the Ring,
They’ll need the more the useful aid our little
Bill will bring!
Antipiional Chorus of Prelates, Wow-
sers and Doctors of Divinity:—
Shame ! Shame ! Shame !
Here’s a baby without any name!
How dare it arrive?
Does the Devil contrive it, or is it the
Lord we must blame?
Sin ! Sin ! Sin !
The mother looks weary and thin —
What! Give her & fiver,
And help to revive her? —If so, let the
Judgment begin!
What? What? What?
Will you subsidise Sin in a cot?
Such conduct besmirches'
The Six Hundred Churches —we tell you
to stop on the spot!
Why? Why? Why?
Do you know where you’ll go when you
die?
Do you know we shall damn you,
And into Hell ram you for bursting our
grand Marriage Tie!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Prepare for tornadoes of Woe!
Look out for our curses,
And horrid reverses, until to your
hearses you go!
Chorus of Federal Ministers: —
Come ! Come ! Your attitude is quite
unreasonable —
We’re not proposing anything that’s
treasonable;
We’re imitating—think this no pro-
fanity—
The Founder of our common Christi-
anity !
Antiphonal Chorus: —
Your conduct is most shocking!
It’s suspiciously like mocking;
If you gave the churches cash, some
good they’d say for you !
But you’re wasting it on mothers—
Therefore know, O wicked brothers,
That, henceforth, Six Hundred Churches
cannot pray for you!
{Exeunt, singing: “Shame! Shame!
Shame!”)
Chorus of Federal Ministers:—
See, with sureness and with clarity,
What the Churches misname Charity!
On earth peasoup, cells and hominy—
Gloria, gloria tibi Domine!

makes the following claims upon your attention:—
1 — It uses cheap laqip oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
s—lt5 —It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.
