The Carpenter and the University
The other evening I introduced a young
carpenter friend to my library. His keen
glance passed quickly from books on psycho-
logy and other matters pertaining to the
teacher’s craft to the row of history books
large and He paused for an instant,
and his idle lingers strayed to touch some
novels. Then he looked at me. ' “Hot any
poetry?” he asked. In silence I pointed
to Shakspeare’s plays, poems of Tennyson,
Wordsworth, Keats, Browning and Milton,
and anthologies and collections of various
kinds. As my friend extracted “The Eng-
lish Parnassus —An Anthology of Longer
Poems,” he said, “I can always get plenty
of novels to read, but never enough poetry. ’
And I had not opened that book for six
long years—not since I studied certain odes,
elegies and poems of Johnson, Gray, Collins,
Cowper, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Brown-
ing and Matthew Arnold for the University
Arts course; and I have no wish to read
them again.
Later 011 I noticed that when the
carpenter was reading The Bulletin,
he naturally turned to the column of
A r arious Verse—a thing I never do.
It is the only column I fail to read
every week; only on odd occasions do
I read even the topical verses scattered
through the issue. Yet as a youngster I
was fond of poetry. I can still remember
many of the poems I learnt at school; still
I feel the thrill of Scott’s scene in “The
Lady of the Lake” that ended with the line,
“And Saxon I am Rhoderic Dhu!”; and as
I teach again those lilting excerpts from
Byron’s “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage” en-
titled “The Ocean,” “Solitude,” and “The
Rhine,” the well-remembered cadences revi-
vify for me the glamor of poetry. But for
the rest —well, I don’t hate poetry; yet I
have lost all desire to voluntarily read and
learn it.
The true aim for teaching literature in
our schools is to inculcate a love for the
best poetry as well as the best prose in our
language; but that aim is always deflected
by the demands of our University system.
For centuries the Universities have been
examination-ridden; examinations are the
be-all and end-all of the system of educa-
tion culminating in the University degree. So
the University has called the tune and
teachers and pupils have danced to it,
right from the University itself down to
the primary schools. Now I claim that my
early love for poetry has become atrophied
because during my years—my most formative
years—of studying for such examinations I,
along with thousands of others, was com-
pelled to pore over dozens of books of litera-
ture, and endeavor to cram in enough to
answer such questions as “Elucidate seven
of the following passages with reference to
the context” —followed by 10 two- and
three-line extracts from as many different
books. Nothing could be so deadening to
true teaching and true learning. And this
soul-sickening spirit still persists. Not so
long ago my upper-grade children were
reciting some simple, gentle poem of Roderic
Quinn’s, when my inspector turned to me
and demanded why I did not teach them
something solid—something from Shaks-
peare, for instance. “They'll need it later
on, you know,” he avowed.
My carpenter friend has had no Univer-
sity education ; he still cherishes his love for
poetry inculcated during his primary school
days. He has outgrown the rhymes of his
childhood and - now reads Shakspeare and
Milton for pleasure and profit. Whereas I,
with a University education, can derive
neither pleasure nor profit from the reading
of any poet, ancient or modern. What
good have my studies of ilterature been to
me? None at all!
Teachers of science have revolted against
the University proscriptions for science
teaching, and. instead of teaching science in
the water-tight compartments of chemistry,
botany, physics and physiology, they teach
general science. That is, all scientific phe-
nomena that come before the child’s view is
explained no matter whether it is botany or
zoology or any other ology. Teachers are
free to teach matters of strictly local
interest. In a somewhat similar fashion
teachers of literature should rebel so that
they will be free to inculcate a love for
poetry without fearing that their young
charges will be plucked by some wily, hoary
examiner.
COUNTRY PED.
A Poetical Thesaurus
Reputations are strangely haphazard
things; great men die and are forgotten,
mouldering in the graves of first editions,
while for no visible reason some dull fellow
is reprinted eternally, and —most astonishing
of all—is evidently sold. There is Walt
Whitman, for instance. It has always been
a mystery to me why fame should have
settled on the head of this strange person
howling his “barbaric yawp.” It was the
Burroughs volume—which we now know was
written by Whitman himself —that, seems to
have first hoisted him definitely on the public
as a serious writer; but, then, even such
men as Emerson added their voices to his
praise, and the only contrary intelligent
voice to be discovered is Swinburne's. But
Swinburne did not have the strength of his
opinions: he turned apostate at the desire
of his friends, and from attgcker became
affirmer. Since then nobody seems to have
definitely approached Whitman in a critical
way; he is accepted as a great poet, but
posterity always likes to crown with laurels
those who were given thorns in their life-
time.
Taking Whitman from any angle. I can
find no value in his work. He has discarded
all pretensions to rhythm, that Midas-like
thing which transforms leaden words to
golden magic; he ignores rhyming, except
in the rather lamentable effort of “O Cap-
tain, My Captain.” and seems to do nothing
except chop bad prose into lines. His only
idea is that all men am equal on the face of
the earth, rather an ancient cliche, and so
inqre aptly and succinctly put in the old
rhyme:
When Adam delved and Eve span,
Who was then a gentleman?
But Whitman takes a huge volume (o repeat
those two lines again and again in confus-
ing language, in monotonous catalogues of
cities, parts of \the body, machinery and in-
numerable adjectives. It is perfectly simple
with the aid of an atlas or any doctor’s text-
book to produce most of Whitman’s poems.
The famous passage in “Children of Adam,”
so often quoted as an example of perfect
love poetry, is nothing beyond a long and
very dull list of the various parts of the body
occasionally brought in amorous juxtaposi-
tion with each other; its opening line alone
is enough to damn any verse in the world
for ugly phraseology and vagueness: “O my
body! I dare not desert the likes of you in
other men and women, nor the likes of the
parts of you.”
For this kind of poetry at its best Rupert
Brooke is the perfect example. What is
“The Great Lover” but a list of ordinary
objects such as Whitman tries to handle?
Yet one has only to compare the two to see
the vast difference. Brooke’s poem is magic;
here every article-—cups, trees, roofs, grass,
houses —is banded together with such beauty
that it is immediately brought vividly to the
eye. Whitman suggests nothing; he simply
tabulates an irrelevant series of words with
no attempt at imagery or beauty. If one
sees them at all it is only because one knows
them so well. But in Brooke even the blan-
kets are shown to us because of their “rough
male kiss” and “the cool kindliness of sheets
that soon smooth away trouble.” This is
the difference between good and bad poetry.
One is alive and the other dead. Take
Brooke’s “Thoughts on the Shape of the
Human body” and compare it with
Whitman’s already-mentioned “Children
of Adam,” Part 9. Here the same things
are dealt with —love and the human body.
But where Brooke’s body, moves with blood
and muscle, Whitman’s lias no more life in
it than a text-book on anatomy.
But perhaps it is unfair to place Whitman
near Brooke; let us then choose a prose-
writer with no pretensions to poetry. There
is m.ore poetry, for all that, in one line of
Joseph Conrad’s than there is in the whole
of “Leaves of Grass.” Imagine Whitman
trying to create the glowing lines of that
little masterpiece, “Youth” —to write such
a passage as this of the doomed ship fight-
ing its way across a smooth sea with all its
cargo of coal afire: —
And she crawled on, do or die, in the serene
weather. The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle
of azure. The sea was polished, was blue, was
pellucid, was sparkling like a precious stone, extend-
ing on all sides, all round to the horizon —as if the
whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel, one
colossal sapphire, a single gem fashioned into a
planet. And on the lustre of the great calm waters
the Judea glided imperceptibly,' enveloped in languid
and unclean vapors, in a lazy cloud that drifted to
leeward, light and slow: a pestiferous cloiid defiling
the splendor of sea and sky.
In the hands of Whitman those great lines
would have become simply a burbling cata-
logue of lumbering words, heaving together
against each other, seeming to groan with
the sweat of movement. Here is Whitman
on Cpnrad’s ground, the sea, put into prose
for the sake of space (if this appears un-
fair, I might add that it would be far simpler
and nearer to my argument if I were to chop
Conrad into lines) :—•
Sea of stretch’d ground-swejls, sea breathing broad
and convulsive breaths, sea of the brine of life and
of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves, , howler and
scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea. 1 am
integral with you. I too am of one phase and of all
phases..
It reads like a description of Whitman’s
own poetry, sluggish and painful, with no
attempt at continuity in the phrases. Where
Conrad moves Whitman stays stuck in a
rut. Conrad's sea in “Typhoon” is a sea
of living fury. Whitman’s sea is just a
burble of ugly words that gives as much
effect of the sea as it does of a passing
motor-car.
At least Whitman has one value—the
value of unconscious humor. In “Salut au
Monde!” we learn some very interesting
anthropological items: about our own abo.,
for instance: “You Austral negro, naked,
red, sooty, with protrusive lip, grovelling,
seeking your food !” And in the same poem
a most original conception of the cocky’s
daily activities“l hear emulous shouts of
Australians pursuing the wild horse.” At
one time he suddenly asks in a most naive
fashion: “What am I, after all,- but a child,
pleas’d with the sound of my own name?
repeating it over and over; I stand apart to
hear —it never tires me.” There is a good
deal of truth in that. Whitman was really
only a child surprised by the beauty of the
earth- and determined to miss nothing. In
simple faith in the uniqueness of his own
eyesight to let everybody else
into the gigantic secret of the joy of living.
Therefore, he began to catalogue. He missed
nothing; everything important and unim-
portant was jambed into his “Leaves of
Grass.” It is a book of synonyms, a the-
saurus, Roget without an index.

Mr. Galsworthy Side-steps
What would you do if you suddenly met
an escaped convict, and it was in your power
either to help him elude his pursuers or to
secure his return to his cell in Pentridge
Prison? That is the question which Mr.
Galsworthy raises in his play of “Escape,”
quite recently produced at the London Am-
bassadors’ Theatre. It is not an easy one
for any to answer. Mr. Galsworthy side-
steps it. To the common or garden type of
man the question implies a possible conflict
between his desire as an individual, inclined
to mercy and moved by pity, and his duty

Your car will be a better car when you use “Sternol.” This power oil gives
easy smarting, ready response, smooth, silent running, greater pulling power and
less depreciation. Sternol is clear, clean and carbonless, and maintains its
viscosity under all conditions and temperatures, giving better compression and
more power. You can prove it with one trial.
Messrs. Sterns, Ltd., have been manufacturing lubricants for over half a century
—before the first motor-car was made. This is why “Sternol” is so good.
Two Essential Lubricants
AMBROLYTE (Medium).
Ambrolyte is a medium-weight lubricant
for gears and back axles manufactured
by the makers of Ambroleum, the lieavy-
gear lubricant.
Ambrolyte clings to the teeth of the gears,
penetrates the ball rods, retains its lubri-
cating properties after being subjected to
working temperatures, and at the same
time is of such body that none of the
energy transmitted from the engine to the
driving wheels is lost. Ambrolyte will
outlast any other type of medium-gear
lubricant on the market.
“It combines economy with efficiency.”
AMBROLEUM (Heavy).
Ambroleum is the finest heavy gear-box
lubricant so far introduced, and well-
known manufacturers and private ownei’s
have abundantly demonstrated that it is
the real thing for geai's. Owing to its
distributing properties there is no need
to more than quarter-fill the gear-box,
for in use the gears are then covered and
thoroughly lubricated.
“It Clings to the Teeth.”

SERVICE
«s

They withstand unusual strain—in the parlance of
men of action: ‘‘They’re there!” Count the moment
well spent when you ask for Paris.
P/IRIS GARTERS
NO METAL CAN TOUCH YOU
Manufactured in Australia by
PRESIDENT SUSPENDER CO., Ltd., 50 York Street, Sydney
as a citizen to his fellows and to the com-
munity to which he belongs.
“I’m always on the side of the wrong-
doer,” Max Beerbohm has said somewhere.
“They have such a bad time.” This atti-
tude seems quite defensible, not from one
point of view alone, and cannot be dismissed
as mere easy sentimentalism.
Unfortunately, Mr. Galsworthy does not put
the problem quite fairly. An attractive young
man foolishly stops and quite innocently
gossips with a young woman in, the park.
The girl is arrested by a plainclothes con-
stable for soliciting. The young man resents
the roughness with which she is treated,
struggles with the policeman and knocks
him down. Unfortunately his head strikes a
sharp iron railing, and he is killed. The
man had, of course, no intention to murder
or even seriously to hurt. He is tried for
manslaughter and sentenced to five years’
penal servitude. It is perhaps beside the
point to doubt whether in practice he would
have received so severe a sentence. Life in
prison is insupportable to this young, healthy
man, whose, spirit of adventure has been
developed by life on a ranch in the Western
States and by escaping from a German
prison during the war, and on one foggy
day he contrives to escape again.
It is a mad enterprise, and eventual cap-
ture is almost a certainty, but in his few
hours of freedom he has a series of sugges-
tive adventures. A pleasant young lady, in
whose room he hides, lends him her hus-
band’s razor and his Burberry and fishing-
rod, in order that he may hide his convict’s
appearance and seem to be intent on a lawful
pursuit. A retired Judge gossips with him
in the friendliest way, and gives him cigars.
One of two sisters living together in a cot-
tage is sympathetic and helpful, and a clergy-
man in whose vestry he takes sanctuary is
ready to lie in his service, and is only pre-
vented by the convict’s realisation that he
is not playing the game, and by his readi-
ness to surrender rather than gain advan-
tage from a good man doing evil.
Several points suggest themselves. Mr.
Galsworthy’s convict is a very pleasant and
most attractive person. Had he been an
ordinary criminal, rough of speech, repul-
sive in appearance, would the young lady
have lent him her husband’s Burberry, would
the Judge have given him the cigars, would
the clergyman have hesitated before handing
him over to the police ? The question
whether it is right or wrong to aid the crimi-
nal flying from justice cannot depend on
whether the criminal is nice or nasty.
Again, is one quite sure—from the good citi-
zen’s point of view—if it is material whether
the convict is innocent or guilty? The play
(as written) is not without those accom-
panying irritations from which the theatre
never seems able to escape. One of the two
sisters in the cottage goes to church. The
other does not. It is the churchgoer who
is hard, the non-churcligoer who is sympa-
thetic. Is this cheap and familiar gibe
really justified by human experience? Per-
haps not. If I were in the position of an
evildoer, sorely in need of the ministrations
of a good Samaritan, I should without hesi-
tation seek that aid from a woman who
prayed rather than from the woman who
hunted.
The clergyman, too, is a most queer sort
of person. He declines to give the convict
his blessing, on the plea that it is only
bishops who bless, and he declares that the
right of sanctuary had been lost because the
Church (in England) now belongs to the
State. This is an _ exaggerated Erastianism
which even Archbishop Lees could hardly
approve. The clergyman’s first dilemma is
that he would not dare to tell his people if
he helped the convict. He would lose his
people’s confidence if they knew he had been
merciful to a sinner. Such a fear could
never influence a self-respecting priest.
Public opinion would be nothing to him so
long as he was doing his duty. But he
might well hesitate. Was it his duty to
feed the fugitive and help him on his way,
or to say to him : “Brother, you have sinned
and must pay. I will pray that you may
suffer without losing dignity, and pay with-
out losing self-respect”?
If all Judges were merciful, if all sen-
tences were equitable, if all prisons were the
houses of mercy and understanding, the deci-
sion would be easy. As it is, it is doubtless
the duty of the good citizen to be on the side
of the law. But I am quite sure that I
should aid and abet the escape.
A. H. G.
Australian Speech
It was Thomas Carlyle who said that
every parish in England had a speech of its
own with peculiarities perfectly obvious to
the people of every other parish. The furious
discussion which rises every now and again
about the Australian accent gives point to
this. Hosts of people are found to declare
that Australians speak only the purest Eng-
lish, hosts of others to assert that Austra-
lians speak very badly. In the confused
wrangle it is difficult to understand on what
either contention is based. If a standard
English mode of speech be set up which re-
presents with tolerable fairness the average
sounds of words in the mouths of the best
educated users of the language the world
over, the general level of Australian speech
will fall very far short of it, though not so
far short of it as the general level of speech
in Britain. There are probably more people
m Australia, in proportion to population,
who speak pretty decent English than in any
other country; but as these do not repre-
sent more than five or six per cent, of the
whole population such a comparison is not
particularly gratifying. In England the
proportion of people who speak really well
would not work out at more than 0.05 per
cent., yet it is with these—the very elect of
the elect in the matter of care and pronunci-
ation—that the comparison is usually made
when considering the conversational tones
of Collingwood and Surry Hills.
Take another mode of testing and the re-
sult can never be in doubt. Do the people
of Sydney and Melbourne slums speak as
well as those of the slums of Londou, Glas-
gow and Manchester? Do the station
workers from beyond the Darling speak as
well as the people who drive sheep on the
Sussex or Hampshire downs? Do the stu-
dents of our universities speak as purely and
cleanly as those of Oxford? In every case
we are forced to admit that the Australian
speaks very much better. There are, of
course, people in Australia even in the higher
occupations whose mangling of wmrds and
sentences is distressing and whose tones must
make a purist for language shudder; but
such people are found in Britain also, as in
every English-talking country. The com-
parison of the polite murderer of speech in
Australia with his brother-felon of other
lands boils down largely to a consideration
of vowel sounds. Where the Australian rips
those sounds up the other fellow generally
batters them down; and because the ripping-
up process is a trifle more aggressive than
the other it is liable to be noticed more.
To speak of an Australian accent is
absurd. The differences of speech have
rarely anything to do with accent. There
are a few words in current use among us
which are almost invariably stressed in the
wrong place, but this in itself would be too
small a difference to matter. It is in the
vowel sounds that the real differences lie, and
the variations from type are of such a nature
that they can hardly be expressed in writing.
The gradual passage from the vowel A to its
comrade I includes at least a dozen sounds, all
of them shading off in sueli a way that only a
trained ear can distinguish them. If you
can do so without provoking battle, ask a
person who is not pronouncing the A in a
particular syllable correctly to pronounce it
in your way. In 19 cases out of 20 he will
be quite incapable of detecting any difference
between your mode of pronouncing and his
own. In the 20th case he will turn upon
you and ask you to imitate sounds he makes
and prove similar defects in the accuracy of
your own hearing. Such an experiment
shows very plainly why strangers do not for
years adapt their pronunciation to that of
people around them, even when they have
reason to believe that their neighbors speak
better.
In this matter of the finer shades of vowel
sounds it is almost impossible to set a stand-
ard. What can be done, however, is to set
a tone. Quiet speech, carefully uttered, will
go far towards remedying other defects. The
trouble is not so much that local pronunci-
ations will grow up as that ugly pronuncia-
tion may become the rule. To get the best
out of language its flow must be graceful
and easy. On such grace is built all litera-
ture and without it poetry is sadly limited.
The mode of speech is to some extent the
index to the mode of thought. The
roar of the bull, the bark of the dog and the
cackle of the fowl-run have all their counter-
parts in the conversation we hear around us.
But human speech should have some finer
qualities than these; and the modulation of
the voice to give each word itsl true emotion
as well as its full meaning is the thing most
needed in Australian language reform.
D. M. W.
Stephen, Nicholls and Others
Can Australians write? Well, here is
a specific case.
I have but recently read Beverley
Nicholls’s “Patchwork.” In its way a read-
able enough book, it still has nothing to tell
us beyond how sundry ’Varsity students
played at authors and editors, and gives
some good pictures of English college life.
Yet it has had its vogue, and sells even in
Australia. The estimable lady who lent me
the book had never even heard of Adrian
Consett Stephen, to say nothing of Duncan
Hall, R. I. Kay and R. R. Kidston, who
were the nucleus of a small literary school at
Sydney University in 1913-14. Ail of these
writers are Nicholls’s equal, Stephen greatly
his superior. All of them wrote good prose,
and some of them good verse. Hall and Kid-
ston “graduated” as minor Australian poets
in Murdoch’s “Oxford Book of Australian
Verse.” Stephen was, however, the “star
turn.” His wit had a spontaneity that ever
delighted his friends and needed no rehear-
sal. Not for him the numberless shirt-
cuffs of Wilde, nor did his epigrams require
a background of risque suggestion. Stephen
lies in Flanders and his friends have raised
from his works two modest memorials to his
genius. I doubt if “Four Plays” and
“Stories, Burlesques and Letters from
Hermes” are one-quarter as well read in this
country as “Patchwork,” but, then, Sydney
University is a mere colonial “shop” for
turning out professional men, while Oxford
is a social institution in a great country
where social institutions are as important
as religious or Parliamentary organisations!
Whilst Stephen fought, Nicholls went with-
out the discipline that sixth-formers im-
pose on their fags in English Public Schools.
Hence his much-vaunted impudence. And
now whilst Nicholls publishes interviews
with London celebrities and enjoys a repu-
tation for smart journalism and the fruits
thereof, Kidston and Kay, in Sydney, are
content to purvey law, and Hall, last heard
of at Honolulu, w T as preaching a gospel of
brotherhood of not-so-vei’y-pacific nations.
I lately watched Kidston turning over
MSS. of Stephen’s and Kay’s work, and
some of his own. There was enough material
for a couple of good books. Asked why
they did not publish it, he laconically replied,
“No demand,” and settled down to write a
synopsis of commercial law for the use of
students. No doubt genius will find its
outlet, but good readable matter is within
the scope of many Australians. That they
should prefer professions or trade reduces
the whole question to a simple sum in
relative profits. Any observer may work it
out for himself.
MATT LOWE.
A Satchel of Books
Exactly As It Goes, by John Raxon (Vidler, Melb.).
The author has succeeded in putting together a fairly
readable group of tales which, though sometimes
artificial, are about, equal in interest and variety to
many similar collections from oversea. They cover
a wide range and touch many emotional notes.
Cleaning and Repairing Furs (Robertson and
Mullens).’ This little book, described as having been
written by an expert, ojlens with the rather startling
headline: “How to manufacture, clean and repair
your own skins.” Really, however, It is devoted
to the handling of furred skins—such as
rabbit, ’possum, wallaby, kangaroo, water-rat,
fox and the domestic cat of Suburbia. By
expert treatment of these it would appear to be
possible for our wives to be just as happy in rabbit
fur as in raccoon—provided we don’t mention the
price.
Prairie, by Walter ,1. Muilenburg (John Lane).
This study of a family upon an American farm
could, with certain excisions and modifications, have
had its location on the outer fringe of the N.S.W.
wheat belt. It is a story of a pioneer’s fight against
bad seasons, drought and bush fire and the loneliness
of the empty plains. Although the prevailing note
is one of depression, it is an absorbing volume.
Children’s Books (Werner Laurie). Two booklets
“The Little Girl Who Curtsied to the Owl” and “The
Dog, the Brownie and the Bramble-patch,” the letter-
press by Margaret Baker and the illustrations in
silhouette by her sister Mary, offer a striking con-
trast. in their absence of color and presence of both
literary and artistic merit, to the crude productions
that not so many years ago were deemed good enough
for the use of children.
Betting to Win, by “Delaware” (“The Harbor”
Publishing Co., Sydney). For this betting system
the minimum capital required is 30 units, and the
amount won on the average is only one-tentli of
the capital. Still, with £3O giving £3 profit a
week, it is obviously worth while. The author has
put some humor into his treatise; but it isn’t
accompanied by any cash guarantees.
The High Adventure, by Jeffery Farnol (Sampson
Low: Robertson and Mullens). Since “The Broad
Highway” many years ago introduced a new novelist
with a good old-fashioned theme full of robustious
movement, squires and inns, foaming, tankards and
coquettish misses, Mr. Farnol has periodically pro-
duced replicas, more or less. The present novel has
all the vigor and melodramatic color of its pre-
decessors.
A Lovely Day, by Henry Ceard (Knopf). A trans-
lation of a typically French story in which a wife,
weary of domestic routine and drab monotony, deter-
mined to have at least one lovely day. So Madame
set out with a lover to enjoy all the associations of
sin without committing it. It rained heavens hard
all the lovely day and the lovers bored each other
inexpressibly. Then the faithful wife returned to
the unromantic M. le Mari, and “without kisses or
desires the couple fell gently into slumber, mingling
their snores.” Humorous, satirical and salacious.
The Land of Many Names, by Josef Capek (Allen
and Unwin). The author, a Czechoslovakian poet
and painter, is the elder brother of Karel, whose
“R.U.R.” created a world-wide sensation, and with
whom he collaborated in writing “The Insect Play.”
But as a dramatist running in single harness Josef
doesn’t threaten to gain a place among the leading
men. While this play has originality in theme and
construction and. introduces a variety of technical
devices, it too often descends into incoherence. It
would be a persevering reader indeed who would
carry on after the first 50 pages.
The God within Him, by Robert Hichens
(Methuen). A blend of stoic philosophy and the
Christian ethic in narrative form. Peter Kharkoff,
the Jew, is the central figure in a story not so much
of incident and plot as of subtle analysis of the
influence of an “uneartlily” character upon a group
of his fellow beings, Jews and Gentiles alike. Not
that l’eter claimed to be unearthly in. any specml
sense, for he held that “everyone of us is unearthly.
The novel tells how this conception of the God within
us moves the characters in his tale to personal sacri-
fices and satisfies in them the lonely yearnings ot
humanity that reach out for satisfaction in a higher
life. A long and sometimes prolix book, but worth
while, informed as it is by a more serious purpose
than that contained in any previous work by the
author.
“W.N.L.”: Is not one reason for the comparative
non-success of Australian writers that they are not,
speaking generally, true to Australian life? A very
large proportion of Australians are neither uneducated
vulgarians of the “On Our Selection” type nor beer-
swilling hooligans, nor yet society bounders; yet, to
judge by the majority of Australian stories, 90 p.e.
of our population is composed of these types. Aus-
tralians as I know r them, in every grade of society
and every quarter of the continent, have much the
same qualities, good and bad, as their English, Scotch
or Irish forebears, with more enterprise perhaps
(“perhaps” remembering our early pioneers and
explorers), more- self-reliance and adaptability, and
a keener artistic sense. A splendid people in the
making, and our writers do not do anything like
justice to them!
“Veronal”: The filming of Marcus Clarke’s “For
the Term of His Natural Life” has exhumed the
book, so far as Australia is concerned. Its first
print, in serial form, was about the end of the
’eighties in the Australian Journal, of Melbourne,
under the title “His Natural Life.” The text w r as
enlivened by woodcuts from drawings by Thomas
Carrington; Tom had previously illustrated Clarke’s
“Long Odds, a Novel,” also published by Mussina.
Richard Bentley, of London, subsequently got hold
of the book, but altered the title to that by which
it is now known, while Marcus Clarke added a dedi-
cation to Charles Gavan Duffy, in which he apologised
for any shortcomings in his literary craftsmanship.
Bentley’s edition is now scarce. The book was
soon dramatised; Alfred Dampier showed the best-
known version, in which he took the part of the
Rev. James North. It is strange that no collection
of Clarke’s works has yet been published. The
brilliant “Sensational Tales,” for instance, are now
long out of print and not easy to procure.
Signposts on Life's Highway, by “Juliet” (Vidler,
Well).). Simple, easily flowing verse and sentiment
so devastatingly sincere as to disarm criticism. A
specimen:—
“O Melbourne streets are straighter
Than any streets I know.
So wide, there is no doubting
The road that we should go.
How can we ever falter
Upon our onward way,
When only wilful wand’ring
Can cause our steps to stray?”
There are no traffic cops in “Juliet’s” philosophy.
Sonnets and Other Verses, by Oswald Gray (pri-
vately printed at the Argonaut Press, Melb.). Ihe
author apparently suffers from the sonnet complex in
a mild form. His 26 sonnets are neatly packed
with nice words and inoffensive phrases; but his
subjects are the worn stock themes .of “literary
work. There is nothing to condemn in his output,
but there is not very much to praise. What he
says he says in a gentlemanly manner; but one
stark epithet would be welcomed in this sweetly
flowing rivulet of classic poetry. His best sonnet,
“Shake!” strikes a stronger and more individual
note: —
“1 like a man. I like a man that takes
Occasion bv the throat —and strangles it ;
A man with courage, he who has the grit
To frown at Opportunity, that makes
A way for everyone ere yet he wakes
And gives to each a chance to do his bit;
I like a man who Fortune brave forsakes.
Myself, I have a leaning, too, that way;
And love to meet a man above mere pelf,
Who willing drives the pen or pulls the rake,
And dreams his dreams, and lives them day by day.
I like a man like you —a fool myself—-
I’m mighty glad to meet you, comrade. .. . Shake!

TT HE more beautiful a woman is the greater her dread of old age.
1 Woman, by her beauty alone, has ruled and ruined nations,
made and unmade kingdoms, suppressed and caused revolutions —
such is the power of her beauty.
Beauty and Youth go hand in hand. As old age appears beauty
gradually fades, the skin loses its peach-like bloom, and, worst of
all, the telltale of approaching years, silvery GREY HAIRS, make
their appearance. As soon as a woman sees the reflection of these
silver threads in her mirror she realises her maturing years. Her
husband, her children and her friends —they all notice it.
ALLEN’S WALNUT STAIN is a simple, harmless liquid, and
when applied to the hair removes these telltale silver threads.
Obtainable in brown or black, it tints to any shade. It is
perfectly safe and easy to apply, and can be obtained from any

When at last the grasses cover
Dust, the heart of me,
You the loved and I the lover
Cold, cold will be.
Still the cloud-ships will go heaving
Through the starry sea,
And the moonlight still be weaving
Silver filagree.
Still will spring to leafage tender,
Waken clod and tree,
And young lovers praise Love’s splendor,
Even as we.

The spring wind is the children's wind; it
plays amid their hair,
And leads them forth to bower lands where
all the world is fair.
It rests with them in meadows green, where
golden glows the sun;
And happy are the long hours as they pass
them one by one.
The spring wind is the flowers’ wind; in
dancing elfin glee,
Adowu the winding w T oodland dells he sets
them nodding free.
The blossom trails of crimson vine he blows
into a blaze,
And snows the heath with waxen bloom down
glowing gully ways.
The spring wind is the lovers’ wind —a
pulsing, joyous thing
That drains the brown boronia cups and flits
away to sing
A lover’s song among the trees —a song that’s
very old —
And strum the measure sweet upon a wattle
harp of gold.

“The Glory of Old England.”
Listen to the sea, as it sings a song of
bravery,
Listen to the sea, as it sweeps along the
shore,
Telling of the fights that have saved our souls
from slavery,
Ten years ago, and a hundred years before !
Telling of the men who went out to give
their lives for us —
Each man a hero—a hundred thousand
strong;
Leaving their homes and their sweethearts
and their wives for us:
The sea still sings to us the burden of their
song!
“ Quarter-deck! Lower-deck!
Cabin-boy and Admiral,
Engineer and sailorman —
Their lives were given free!
All for the Navy and the glory of Old
England!”
That’s what you’ll hear if you listen to
the sea!
Listen to the sea, as it heaves above the
heads of them,
Telling all the winds of the battles they
have won!
Standing its watch with the angels by the
beds of them,
Chanting in chorus of the deeds that they
have done!
Look, through the night, where the phosphor-
bells arc glimmering,
Lighting up the deep for the gallant souls
below!
Full fathom five, where the moonlit waves
are shimmering,
They wait there till Gabriel his bugle-call
shall blow!
“Quarter-deck! Louver-deck !
Admiral and cabin-boy,
Engineer and sailorman —
He’ll set our spirits free!
Then shall we rise for the glory of Old
England !”
That’s what the Navy men are singing in
the sea!

COTTON-WOOL AND THE EMPIRE.
Cotton-wool is a substance that people stuff
into their ears when they have an ache
there, or when they want to shut out un-
pleasant noises. It has some surgical uses,
too, but otherwise, though quite innocuous
and comforting, it isn’t much good expecting
to do things with it—-like building empires,
for example. Yet periodically the leading-
politicians of the British Empire, both those
who have learned what London means and
those who have merely been told about it.
find that it is imperatively necessary to drop
thinking about all the problems they have
been unable to solve at home and rush to
London to save the Empire. And on such
occasions, having only the haziest of notions
about the constitution of the British Empire
—they aren’t to be blamed for that, because
there isn’t any constitution and it’s a racial
habit to fight shy of definitions—they swallow,
each and every one of them, about nine yards
of the best political cotton-wool, and through
that tough and sense-deadening material they
endeavor to emulate the Delphic oracle. The
general idea of the celebration from the
English standpoint is a schoolboy's notion of
rejoicing over Victoria’s 60th year of reign-
ing. There must be a great waving of the
Union .Tack; a great assertion of unity; a
great rejoicing over the fact that, as an
empire, we’re here because we're here.
Maoriland’s ebullient Dick Seddon, in whom
the world failed to perceive one of the great-
est advertising geniuses of his age, realised
in the first years of the century that it was
only necessary for a “colonial" Premier to
say that his country loved its mother in order
to bring down the house. The astute but
not very original William Morris Hughes
profited by the example at a later date. Like
Seddon, he was hailed as a saviour of the
Empire. Smuts, of South Africa, who knew
enough about the racial antagonisms in his
own domain to wish all wars to cease, got his
hurrahs more sensibly by helping Britain to
play the entertaining game of “League of
Nations” with an American President who had
high principles and no ascertainable sense of
humor. Canada, during the war, produced
no great empire-saver. She had troubles of
her own, like Australia, and she didn't have
any politician who could bluff as well as
Hughes. And one of the first things that
happened after the war was that Britain,
most unexpectedly from the point of view
of students of history, told Ireland to go
and have a shot at governing herself.
Thus it happens that to-day, there being in
control of affairs in Britain a party which
thanks its God daily that it has a broad out-
look and a soft heart for the colonies, and
which seems to envisage those colonies in
terms of 1786, there is yet another Imperial
Conference, and one at which almost every
delegate probably is hoping that none of the
others will discover his weak spot in the
matter of allegiance to Mother. Bruce, of
Australia, and Coates, of Maoriland, have
the easiest job. They live in remote lands,
sparsely populated, much in need of a friendly
hand if ever they have to defend themselves,
and in countries, moreover, which it is diffi-
cult for “the poor Pommy” to enter, the fare
being high. Whatever is said at the family
council table Bruce and Coates can wink
knowingly at the representatives of J. Bull.
But there are other delegates who won’t be
so happy, and the silly game of currying favor
in London by referring to the difficulties of
Canada and South Africa seems to have
already begun. Mr. Bruce has been re-
ported to have said that ho stands for the
unity of the Empire, the silken bonds, the thin
red line of heroes and the blood that was shed
in brotherhood, etc. —a quite beautiful senti-
ment. But from Calgary to Dunedin and
from Singapore to British Guiana it is being
said that Australia’s spotless Prime Minister
has administered a crushing rebuke to Hert-
zog, of South Africa, Mackenzie King, of
Canada, and all the seditious-minded Minis-
ters of the Irish Free State. As a matter
of fact, Australia’s Prime Minister is more
or less of a political accident; he has shown
more discretion than valor in his treatment
of domestic troubles, and his qualifications to
speak for Australia on subjects that neither
Australia nor he have had time to consider
thoroughly may fairly be challenged. Prob-
abiy the same sort of thing may bo said
about most of Bruce’s colleagues at the
present conference. They represent at best
but a transitorily dominant section of poli-
tical opinion, and they are more likely to
stir up family quarrels than to promote family
concord when they assemble in London with
no other aim than to show what great men
they are. At the best they can only pro-
duce a few resolutions swathed inches deep
in cotton-wool. And if they get outside of
their cotton-wool cocoon and start to play poli-
tics, then we shall get the worst —an Empire
or a Commonwealth of Nations or a Com-
munity of Territories or whatever they like
to call it. by schisms rent asunder and by
heresies distressed, because some gentlemen
who couldn’t keep their heads shut wanted
to play the game of party-making and party-
breaking on a bigger scale than they ha I ever
known before.
* * * *
An empire can no more define exactly
where every part stands in relation to every
other part than a man can draw up a defini-
tion of his relationship with his wife. The
best he can hope for, and she can hope for,
is that, when there is need for fortitude, for-
bearance and forgiveness, there will be
enough affection left to save the partnership
from wreck. Adversity, as nations and fami-
lies know, is more likely to cement an alli-
ance than disrupt it, and the British race
has already stood that test. There are times
(though these —in a peace—are at decently
long intervals) when it is essential that our
elder statesmen should foregather ; but to drop
national interests and send our political
leaders scurrying London wards every year
is simply foolishness. Not one of them has
yet solved the most pressing of the prob-
lems of his own land. In the meantime,
we have something we call an empire—
though Julius C.-esar would smile at the
notion —and it hangs together. It doesn’t
sqem probable that extempore by
politicians who must feel impelled to keep
one eye on Mother and the other on their
own constituents, and who are only too likely
to succumb to the temptation of scoring
at each other’s expense, will help it to hang
together any more solidly.
THE BITTER CRY OF THE IDEAL
EMPLOYER.
One of Australia’s grievances against the
Labor crowd is that it pays tremendous sums
for the political education of Labor leaders,
only to be deprived of the fruits. Young
working men of good natural parts, but with
their heads full of nonsensical theories
derived from books written generations ago
in France or Germany or from Sunday-night
lectures at the Trades Hall, are taken from
brace or stopes or gravel-pit and made rulers
of the land. In the course of years they
shed their illusions and get a practical
acquaintance with the business of govern-
ment, at terrific cost to the community in
more ways than one. But when they have
become qualified to give their party sane
leadership and the State useful service, they
encounter a blizzard of unpopularity and
arc passed out. Such was the fate of Scad-
dan in Westralia and Theodore in Queens-
land (the circumstances were different, but
the result was the same'), and it will per-
haps be the fate of Collier, who followed
Soaddan, and Theodore’s successor, Mc-
Cormack. That gentleman has courted it
by dropping the language of flattery to which
his followers have grown accustomed, and
addressing them in strangely frank terms.
After 11 years of Labor administration,
during which 45 millions of loan money has
been spent (when Labor took charge the
whole public debt was but 544 millions) and
taxation raised to the highest point in Aus-
tralia, McCormack finds himself, being
Treasurer, in “a very awkward and most
difficult financial position." He "must get
more revenue from somewhere, and curtail
expenditure in every direction possible to
make tip the deficit."
He had taken some very drastic action with regard
to different Government activities. They would not
continue to lose taxpayers’ money upon ventures
that were unprofitable. The shortage of revenue
was largely due to the difficult position on the
State railways. So far as the railways were con-
cerned the Government was going to see that it
got efficiency and discipline. Inefficiency and lack
of discipline existed, and the Government in tackling
that contract had a big task.
The next few months will show whether a
Labor Premier can "take very drastic action
with regard to different Government acti-
vities" and "tackle inefficiency and lack of
discipline” in the railway service and keep
his job.
* -X- * *
McCormack's party started out with a
sturdy belief in State socialism, which all
the other Labor parties shared. "Extension
of the economic function of the State” —
that was how it was worded in the Labor
platform, and it was the way to make every-
body happy. With the Government <is em-
ployer men would work with such a will
that the rate of profit under the old regime
would be doubled or trebled, and the whole
people would benefit, instead of a grasping
few. And the beauty of it was that over-
seas capitalists would provide the where-
withal (at 44, 5, or perhaps 6 p.c.) for the
undoing of their Queensland brethren, while
the growing army of State employees would
be so grateful to Labor for saving it from
the exploiter that they and their womenfolk
would vote for it every time. The last part
of the programme has certainly been realised.
At Federal elections, where only principles
are at stake, the State employees are divided;
at State elections they vote as one man and
woman for the party which gave so many of
them their jobs, and which has hitherto
proved sufficiently humble when the whip
was cracked. As there are 40,000 State em-
ployees (to say nothing of adult relatives)
out of 400,000 actual voters, they have been
the main factor in keeping Labor in office.
But where are the profits which were to pre-
pare the reign of general happiness? Alas,
there are no profits! A State pub and an
occasional State butcher's shop show small
credit balances, but State cattle-stations,
sugar-mills, coalmines, copper-mines, treat-
ment works, canneries and trawlers have
produced losses Which in the aggregate are
frightful, though concealed to some extent
by ingenious bookkeeping. As for the rail-
ways, which returned a profit of £48,000 in
1914-15, when the nefarious capitalist ran
the country, outgo has exceeded income by
14 millions in 11 Labor years, as the tax-
payer knows only too well. And although
Labor has not quite succeeded in doubling
the public debt, its loans-at-any-price policy
has been so costly of late years—it is paying
64 p.c. on £3,100.000, 7 p.c. on £2,466,000
and 74 p.c. on £769,000 —that the annual
interest charge has jumped from £1,975,000
in 1914-15 to £4.617,000 in 1925-26.
The trouble is that the emancipated section
has refused to behave as good copy-book
socialists should. Instead of toiling joyfully
for the ideal employer, and presenting aii
idyllic picture of triumphant collectivism,
it is the most rebellious class in the com-
munity and the least earnest and efficient,
judged by results. Since their successful strike
last year for a ss. per week increase in the
basic wage (the ideal employer conceded it
by Act of Parliament, having previously
reduced the weekly working hours from 48
to 44), the railwaymen have spent a lot of
the ideal employer’s time holding stop-work
meetings. It is impossible to get rid of the
railways, but stop-work meetings can no
longer be tolerated, so the Commissioner-
unhappy man ! —has been ordered to put
them down. The cattle-stations, sugar-mills,
copper-mines, coalmines, canneries and
trawlers are in a different category, and the
most horrible examples are to be handed back
to the nefarious capitalist, though emanci-
pated workers become wage-slaves again.
Referring to these most horrible examples,
the Premier remarks sadly that “the men
were not wholly to blame; the direction was
bad. Persons who were charged with carry-
ing on those concerns have not done their
duty to the State.” For that reason, and
because the Government had reached the end
of its resources, it was no use going on;
“if people whom we set out to serve will
not give the social service necessary to make
a success of those ventures, then there is no
policy left but for the Government to
abandon these particular things until people
are willing to give that necessary social
service.” Herein McCormack shows that
lie is not deficient in courage. But lie does
not go far enough. If his Government lias
no further use for State trading it should
have no further use for borrowing, except
for renewal purposes and a severely limited
number of public works, such as the live-
stock-saving line from Cunnamulla to the
N.S.W. border. If riotous expenditure and
punitive taxation have brought Queensland
to the sorriest pass, frugality and taxes
framed in a scientific spirit should be tried
instead. Since the policy of coddling the
Government’s supporters has completely
broken down, those supporters should be told
that they must no longer expect politics to
do for them what can only be done by thrift,
voluntary co-operation and a steady pre-
ference for the produce of their own country.
In fact, it is incumbent on the McCormacks
to produce a new platform, the old one
having collapsed. A socialist party that
abandons socialism and doesn't suggest an
alternative has no raison d'etre.
A CHOCOLATE-WHEEL EDUCATION.
It is very characteristic of the pathetic insu-
larity of our minds and of our mental and
emotional absorption in the little games ot
Australian politics, in sport, in gambling, in
flapper-beauty competitions and chocolate-
wheel charity functions that since the war
no serious effort has been- made to recon-
sider our educational theories and methods.
Subjects and practice are substantially the
same as those adopted by the Department
of Education upon a .semi-Scottisli. semi-
German model before the W estern cataclysm.
German is no longer popular, however, and
has almost ceased to appear upon the curri-
culum just at the moment when there is
great need of it. French is treated in most
of the non-State Schools as if it were already
a dead language, useful only for examination
purposes alongside the little Latin and less
Greek which Australians acquire so pain-
fully. Spanish and Italian are practically
unknown. All members of the Latin races are
“Dagoes,” and despised as inferior peoples,
heedless of the revival of Italy in world power
and the existence of powerful Latin States
in South America. There is almost com-
plete ignorance and indifference with regard
to the great civilisations of China, Japan
and India, and to the recent movements and
developments in Asia, which vitally concern
the future of the little colony of whites in
Australia.
No attempt has been made by our experts
and specialists in Education nor by the
headmasters of the Great Public Schools to
put before the public the crying need for
taking thought upon these subjects, and of
bringing vividly before the adolescent mind
the actualities of Australian existence. His-
tory is not compulsory whilst games are.
Latin still holds pride of place in the Great
Public Schools as the subject which attracts
the aristocracy of intellect, whilst geography
and economics are cast like bones to those
whose brains are of inferior calibre. The
development of science teaching is the one
great advance which encourages the hope
that the young men and young women of
Australia may yet learn something of cause
and effect, and not continue to think that
prosperity and happiness can proceed from
luck rather than personal effort, and that
the object of culture is the possession of
motor-cars and a racing-stable.
Apparently the Great War taught us no-
thing which we have thought fit to carry
into our educational institutions and prac-
tice —no revision of our ethical cqdes, no-
thing new in our outlook upon human
development and fate, no additional impor-
tance in history, scientific geography and
ethnology: no appreciation of the vital neces-
sity for the study of economics and social
science, and of the psychology, aims, ideals
and civilisation of other races. It is,
indeed, pitiable. And over all broods the
ghost of Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, and the
image of the great god Sport, the idol and
raison d’etre of the Great Public Schools.
The founders of the Public Schools of Aus-
tralia endeavored, more or less successfully,
to introduce the English model based upon
the aristocratic principles of Dr. Arnold,
the aim of which was to train men for posi-
tions of authority and , power. The English
system had its roots- in theocracy which
cannot exist under the Southern Cross. An
aristocracy must have certain virtues if ii
is to survive, and these must be imparted aj
school. Such a scheme of training was ar
education for mandarins,\ not for democrats.
The product of such an educational system
will be energetic, stoical, { physically fit, pos>
sessed of certain unalterable beliefs, with
high standards of right and wrong, and con-
vinced of his own importance in the world.
He will hide an unbending pride under the
mask of a shrinking modesty. This is the
aristocratic ideal behind the regulations for
the Rhodes Scholarship. The Great Public
Schools of Australia profess their adhesion
to the English tradition; in reality, competi-
tion with State institutions has compelled
them to surrender to two fetiches —exami-
nation results and sport, an unfortunate
combination which produces in the mind of
the adolescent a whole series of false values
at the very outset of life.
The publicity given to-day to all kinds of
sporting competitions and to individual
prowess in games has caused a serious effect
upon the schoolboy. In the old days, when
games were intensely played and enjoyed,
whether there was a crowd to see them or
not, a football match and an eight-oar head-
of-the-river struggle did not prompt the
youngsters who took part in them to look
upon themselves as personages of public
importance, or the heroic' protagonists in a
contest in which victory was to be achieved
at all costs. Publicity focuses the attention
and energies of the school upon these epic
struggles of tritons amongst the minnows
in natural preference to the main educa-
tional work of the school. In.this way we
are multiplying sportsmen who wall prefer
the sporting news to international politics,
or to devoting thought to the serious pro-
blems that beset us as an enlightened demo-
cracy. In the school there spreads an atmo-
sphere of unrest, and a complete lack of
interest in the “healthy mind” of educa-
tional theory. Boys go from the excitement
of one contest to that of another. School
public opinion is against work and condemns
as a “fag” or a “swot” him -who shows out-
standing enthusiasm for pure intellect, for
art, letters, mathematics or science. Such
is the herd spirit of a Great Public School.
The over-insistence upon games and ath-
letic competitions as a factor in the produc-
tion of a certain type of character admired
by sports masters has seriously disturbed the
balance of the educational system of the non-
State secondary schools. Compulsory sport
is intolerant of the exceptional in adolescent
manhood, of the artist and the thinker; it
is merely a makeshift legislation for the
mediocrity of health, and aims at producing
a uniform type, and not a diversity of tal-
ents. It is still chained to the idea that
battles can be won upon playing fields, in-
stead of avoided by the discipline of the
intellect and emotions.
It is time that greater recognition was
accorded to the part played by mental con-
centration and discipline, and to the educa-
tion of the aesthetic faculties in the growth of
character. There is as much strength of will,
and as much genuine public epiritj called


for in the determination to work and achieve
an intellectual, artistic and cultural success
as in physical achievements and excellence.
It is time that Education should be put in
the forefront as a subject for national con-
sideration. There should be a complete over-
hauling of our values, methods and subjects
for instruction. The lead in this direction
car. scarcely be looked for from those who
arc in control of our non-State secondary
schools. They are too busily occupied in the
harassing struggle to keep the favor of the
public, and to persuade parents that all’s
right with the school world. The movement
must come from outside.
FRANCIS JACKSON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Words of Comfort.
A CLOUD of witnesses, who grow more numer-
ous and cloudier as days go by, has arisen
to testify , that Australia has run no risk in
borrowing so much, and would run no risk
if it borrowed a great deal more, and that
it might reasonably borrow the whole dashed
lot. Evidence, or at least assertion, in reply
to recent unpleasant criticism, to say no-
thing of recent disconcerting events, is ten-
dered by politicians, sharebrokers, some
alarmed newspapers, “Pro Bono Publico,”
and by N.S.W. ex-Treasurer Arthur Cocks.
The last-named even proposes loans in New
York to supplement the British orgy. All
these views are somewhat discounted by the
fact that it is 97A per cent, less trouble to
take the easy way than any other way. The
invariable argument is that this country will
always be able to meet its liabilities be-
cause there is an immense surplus in the
assumed value of its public and private
assets (almost all immovable, very much of
them unsaleable, and most of the small bal-
ance very hard to realise) over the amount
of the dead-sure debt which falls due for
repayment with the regularity of the sun-
dial. The assets, an independent valuation
of which is much wanted, include public and
private lands, streets, schools, forests, har-
bors, gaols, sewers and an amazing collection
of sundries, winding up with just about as
much real money as the last two years’
borrowings would account for. But even
if the values were real and permanent it is
not Australia’s duty to borrow till everything
is pawned to the limit. And even if Aus-
tralia can meet its interest liabilities when
called on out of its own assets and not, as at
present, largely out of new loans, and even
if it will make a stupendous effort and do
so, there is no satisfaction in dissipating a
fortune in comparative youth and starting
old age with a pick and shovel. In saying,
as a fact or as a reckless assertion, that
there will be sufficient to pay with at all
times, the prophets of smooth tidings are
saying no more than could be said for the
City of Glasgow Bank and the Prodigal
Son. The former paid £8,000,000 worth of
creditors in full, though it peopled work-
houses, lunatic-asylums and cemeteries with
its shareholders; and because the Prodigal
Son wasn’t sold as a slave, but got home, it
is evident that liis debts didn’t exceed his
assets. The present situation is that
£133,000,000 of State and Federal loans have
1927 set against them in the official statis-
tics as the date when they fall due. The
Australian part can be renewed by Austra-
lia lending itself its own paper, and it is
hoped that it will not be necessary to print
so much paper as to depreciate the currency
in the process. For the non-Australian part
dependence is placed on the country’s ability
to borrow the required amount in gold or its
equivalent abroad ; and meanwhile new and
additional loans are wanted abroad, in gold
or its equivalent, in order to meet interest.
The N.S.W. Government became huffed with
Director-of-Finance Stevens, and gave him
its habitual crude form of “sack,” thereby
setting him at liberty to discourse on finance
as a private citizen. In that capacity he
has broken the news that the Ma State will
require £80,000,000 in the next five years for
works to which it is already committed.
Two questions which remain are, how much
will be lost if these works are left unfinished,
and how much will be lost if they are finished
and prove totally unable to earn their keep?
It thus appears that the future has been
heavily mortgaged as well as the present
to buy temporary support for temporary
politicians. The ex-Director of Finance pro-
posed a stock-taking of the national assets
and prospects—presumably by independent
auditors. All enthusiastic boomers should
approve the suggestion, for a. bubble that
can’t bear being handled and prodded is
doubtful property. It would be dreadful if,
for want of timely audit, the accounts went
wrong so suddenly that the Melbourne Cup
had to be stopped. All the racecourses and
racehorses in the land are among the public
and private assets on which all the lOU’s
are secured.

Dead Ends and Dead Dosses.
It was characteristic that N.S.W. Minister
for Railways Flannery should promise to
get busy about supplying the people of the
dead-end railway town of Inverell with an
extension to Ashford, thus making Ashford
the dead end instead. The dead end at
Inverell lias been there for 24J years, and
presumably because of the defunct, if not
decomposed, quality of the extremity, the 96
miles section, Moree-Inverell, pays no interest
on cost, and is short of working expenses.
It was £19,000 shorter by last return than
in 1917. Inverell is 509 miles from Sydney,
but that is partly because the line describes
three sides of a square, heading north-west
till it is not far from the Barwon River, and
then turning due east towards the main line
and the coast, but reaching neither. The
inhabitants have been insistent ever since
the lino stopped there that it should be car-
ried 42 miles further east, and the route was
surveyed, but nothing happened. This exten-
sion to Glen limes would connect with the
main (Sydney-Brisbane) railway, and fur-,'
nish an alternative route only 475 miles long
to Sydney: but, then, it might be the begin-
ning of a short, straight route from the table-
land to the coast, and that is an idea to be
scotched at all costs. If the line to Ashford
is built, there will be three parallel N S W.
railways in those parts—Sydney-Wallan-
garra (493 miles), Sydney to the Queensland
border, via Ivyogle (about 540 miles), and
Sydney to the dead end at Ashford (544
miles). There is no connection between
these except that it is possible to get from
Inverell to Glen Innes, 42 miles away, by
a 420-mile circuit via Werris Creek. The
distance by rail from Inverell to Grafton,
the nearest place of call for sea commerce,
is 695 miles, though the natural distance is 180.
Ashford’s prospect of its railway isn’t, how-
ever, precisely immediate, for there are some
£8,000,000 worth of railway works, including
dead ends, ahead of it. And then a time of
stress may come when the closing-up of many
profitless scrap lines, to save the loss of run-
ning expenses and the repair bill, may have
to be considered. This would logically imply
the completion of a few bits like those of
Bombala and Inverell, which have a definite
destination ahead and some financial pros-
pects on arrival, and a cessation of the
building of scraps. In late years, the little
new railways, when completed, have almost
automatically taken their place on the list
of those which can meet neither interest nor
expenses. The building of bankrupt steel
highways which all lead to Sydney doesn’t
“promote settlement” or “put people on the
land,” despite what Australia’s particularly
stupid brand of politicians may say to the
contrary. It is about eight years since the
last redistribution of Assembly seats; and
though they have been years of hard borrow-
ing and railway-building and “settlement,”
the country districts are now to have 39
members (in a House of 90) instead of the
present 45 because the rush of population
cityward has intensified. Meanwhile pro-
duction hasn’t grown as it should have
done, because too many men have been
building money-losing railways when they
should have been employed in money-mak-
ing factories.

A Federal Health Council.
The main reference of the Royal Commis-
sion on Health, which made its report to
the Federal Government in November, 1925,
was “to inquire and report upon public
health as a matter for legislation and admin-
istration by the Commonwealth in conjunc-
tion with the States where necessary.” It
was further directed that the inquiry should
be carried out along certain definite lines
which were set out in 11 clauses. The report
was comprehensive and courageous. The
Commissioners exposed and analysed the
defects of existing systems, and suggested
drastic and far-reaching reforms. For many
months it appeared as though the effort would
bear no fruit, that the report would find a
permanent resting-place in the pigeon-holes
of a complacent officialdom. But apparently
some good may yet result. In July last a
conference of the Ministers of Health of
Commonwealth and States was held for the
purpose of considering the report of the Com-
mission. Each Minister (or his representa-
tive) was accompanied by the medical-officer
at the head of his department. The results
of their deliberations were lately published
in the form of a series of resolutions which
may be taken as representing an acceptance
in tlie main of the recommendations of the
Royal Commissioners. Chief interest centres
in the agreement that a Federal Health
Council shall be appointed. This body will
consist (if the recommendation is adopted
in toto) of the Director-General of Health,
two other representatives of the Common-
wealth and a financial expert of the Com-
monwealth Government, together with the
chief medical officer of each State. Accord-
ing to the Commissioners, the Federal Health
Council would “devise means for co-opera-
tion of Commonwealth and States, and of
States with States, and to promote unifor-
mity in legislation and- administration where
advisable.” The remaining resolutions
passed at the conference were concerned with
such subjects as the prevention of disease,
venereal disease, foods and drugs, maternity
hygiene, child welfare, industrial hygiene,
research work and co-operation of medical
practitioners with, health authorities. These
subjects are all concerned with preventive
medicine as opposed to curative medicine.
The whole outlook of medical teachers has
changed during recent years, and the old
adage that “prevention is better than cure”
is coming into its own. The keynote of the
last Australasian Medical Congress was pre-
vention, those hest qualified to know clamor
for the creation of chairs of preventive medi-
cine. at the Australian Universities, and all
medical research is directed to the discovery
of causes in order that disease may be pre-
vented. Co-operation of Commonwealth and
State Health Departments with practising
members- of the medical profession will aid
prevention, and for this reason a Federal
Health Council should be welcomed.

Caucus-ridden Ministries.
Most of the internal troubles of present
Labor administrations result directly from
the system of allowing Caucus to select
Ministers. It is utterly unconstitutional, to
begin with. The King, or the King’s repre-
sentative, commissions a man, not a party,
to form a Government. A leader so com-
missioned naturally chooses men whom he is
likely to be able to work with. If he finds
any colleague thwarting or defying him, he
is entitled to ask for such an one’s resigna-
tion. He is even entitled to demand it, as
John Forrest once did in Westralia, with-
the result that a recalcitrant colleague was
found complaining that he had been “sacked
in his nightshirt”—those were pre-pyjama
days. But the modern Labor Premier,
afflicted, like Lang, with Cabinet associates
who deal him vicious kicks from behind and
make no secret of their utter antipathy to
him, has no such means of restoring harmony
in his Government. He can neither choose
tin colleagues whom he wants nor dispense
with those who are almost openly contemp-
tuous of him. He has to take those who are
given him by the party as a whole. About
the only attribute of leadership left to him
is the right or privilege of trying to fit them
into the places where he may deem them
likely to do most good or least harm, and
Caucus is gradually encroaching even upon
that. It is an ignominious surrender of the
powers that should be centred in the head of
a Government, and it is worth recalling that
the surrender was not made without some
struggle: The early Labor Premiers in Aus-
tralia picked their colleagues ; how else could
they present them to the Governor as certi-
fied and guaranteed by themselves in the old
constitutional way? The late Harry Daglish
did this in Westralia and Anderson Dawson
had done it earlier in Queensland. The first
Federal Labor Ministry was J. 0. Watson’s.
But when it came to Andrew Fisher’s
turn Caucus asserted itself. Fisher was
asked if he would consent to have no more
say in the selection of his Ministers than the
youngest member of the Ministerial party,
and Fisher, who was always prone to take
the line of least resistance, professed him-
self quite willing to fall in with the new
arrangement; he saw nothing “humiliating”
in it, he said. Since then events have marched
rapidly, and the wild scramble for portfolios
in a new Labor administration, the intrigu-
ing, the log-rolling and the advantages of
mere popularity with the majority, furnish
the material for a periodically unedifying
scene. In Britain respect for constitutional-
ism dies somewhat harder. Ramsay Mac-
donald, when he formed the first Labor Gov-
ernment, was at least allowed to choose his
own colleagues and not to have them thrust
on him willy-nilly, although whether the
precedent will be adhered to when Labor
comes into power again at Westminster is
another question. Probably not. Lang
would doubtless defend the new system as
wholesomely democratic in theory; it would
be interesting to have his candid opinion
about the way it works in practice. The
titular head of a faction-split Cabinet, only
saved from deposition a few weeks ago by a
single vote, can hardly repel Opposition
attacks with the energy and vigor demanded
of him. It would be too much to expect of
a man to lead the House capably when he
has to spend so much of his time in keeping
himself leader of his own party.

“The Serum-monger’s Trade.’’
“L.C.M.”; Helena MacDougall, hon. sec.
Melbourne branch of the British Union for
Abolition of Vivisection, alludes contemptu-
(B. 14/10/’26) to “the serum-monger’s
trade” and to “the pseudo-science of bac-
teriology.” At the risk of proclaiming self-
evident facts, I quote Sir George Newman,
.Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of
Health in Great Britain :
In England leprosy, sweating-sickness, epidemic
scurvy and the plague have disappeared; cholera
has not been epidemic since 1866 ; the small pox,
though liable to outbreak, appears to be vanishing
under our eyes, and compared with oidy a century
ago is relatively a rare and mild disease, which,
it not always avoided, is at least avoidable; typhus
or gaol fever is rarer still; typhoid and diphtheria
are yielding to improved sanitation, isolation and
the use of antitoxin; hospital gangrene and sepsis
in their gross forms have largely disappeared in
response to the application of antiseptic treatment;
. and some of the great scourges of the world,
such as malaria, hookworm and yellow fever, are
coming steadily under control.
This is mainly due to the work of Pasteur,
Koch and -Lister, of a few rarely intelli-
gent persons who lived before these three
and anticipated the spirit of their discov-
eries, and of the thousands of patient, clear-
thinking, hard-working bacteriologists who
have carried on the work of discovery. Of
course there have been mistakes and fail-
ures ; of course there are problems yet to be
solved; of course the money-grubber has
crept in and used serums for “pleasantly-
lucrative purposes.” All great movements
harbor abuses, and even bacteriology lias its
fakirs. But would the anti-vivisectionists
and anti-vaccinationists prefer the old days?
When we were helpless in face of diphtheria
and tetanus? When, since the germ theory
was unknowh, pre-Listerian surgeons oper-
ated in dirty, blood-encrusted black frock
coats, in the pockets of which they kept
their instruments, and on the tails of which
they wiped their lancets? Do they think
that any advances can be made without
experimenting on living animals, and do
they think that the tremendous advances of
the past 50 years are not worth the sacrifice
of the comfort or even the lives of a few
rabbits, guinea-pigs, goats and monkeys? It
would take too long to describe these
advances, but I may mention that, thanks
to the “pseudo-science of bacteriology,”
diphtheria is a preventable disease. There
is a simple skin test by which it may be
ascertained which persons are susceptible
to diphtheria ; and these susceptible subjects
can be definitely immunised against the
disease by a simple injection. This method
is used to protect nurses in children’s hos-
pitals, and used with signal success. But
when the enlightened doctors of a large
country town in N. 8. Wales, where diph-
theria is alarmingly prevalent, offered,
through the Parents and Citizens’ Associa-
tion, to perform this test on all the children
in the town at a nominal charge (Is. per
child), they were ignored. Of 800 children
eight were presented by their parents for
the test! Many who read this will think
I am using heavy artillery to kill mosquitoes.
But the above instance shows how numerous
are the enemies of progress ; and it is, indeed,
a common fault of right-thinking people to
underestimate the forces of darkness and
ignorance, and to underestimate their ani-
mosity. Truth is great, and shall prevail,
but before and until it prevails we must rid
ourselves of the sentimentalism that pro-
duces the anti-vaccinationist and the anti-,
vivisectionist who rates the lives of rabbits
and guinea-pigs above those of men and
women ; of the sensationalism that daily dis-
torts truth; of the fanaticism that builds
dim cloisters to keep truth out. We must
free ourselves, in short, from ignorance, and
from all who foster ignorance and live by
fostering it.

Who Runs Sydney?
There never was such a city in the world
as Sydney is to-day for providing work for
men who can shift dirt. It would be a safe
bet that more holes are dug and filled up,
more earth moved from one place to another
and more purely manual labor used in the
process in Sydney than in any other city of
its size. There is scarcely a thoroughfare
in the city or its environs that is not being
torn up and laid down again at some portion
of its length at the present moment. Most
of the wages for this class of work come
directly out of the pockets of the workers’
fellow-citizens—9o per cent, of whom are
themselves wage-earners, and some of whom
perhaps earn less than the stout lads who
attend to road-eonstruction and -repair. It
is important to everyone, therefore —and not
least important to the men who get so much
work from the city—that it should be demon-
strated that the city is getting as fair a
deal as it gives. But that never has been
demonstrated. All the facts and figures that
can be adduced are capable of another con-
struction. The other day there was a clear
demonstration that in at least one instance
the city was getting a very unfair deal. Cer-
tain men of the City Cleansing Department
were set to work to remove mountains of
soil from Hyde Bark and dump them in
Moore Park. When the job was done—by
day labor, of course—it was found that it
had cost almost exactly two and a half times
as much as it could have been done for under
contract. Even Labor aldermen were shocked,
and said it looked as if the toilers who re-
moved the mountains had been having a
good rest between shovels-full. It was, of
course, a most un-class-conscious thing to
say, and the aldermen who said it were
promptly- and right trenchantly rebuked by
the organiser for the Municipal Employees’
Union, one Deane, who said that anyone
with the sense of a fowl might have known
that it wasn’t the toilers who were respon-
sible, but the “folly of those in charge.”
Ilad the work been entrusted to the City
Engineer’s Department, said Mr. Deane, it
would have been done very cheaply. But
the men of the Cleansing Department were
sweepers, not shovellers, and therefore not
versed in shovel technique. There the matter
rests. But what the average citizen would
like to know is what would have happened
to “those in charge”—which presumably in-
cludes the Labor Mayor and his aldermanic
following—if they had awakened earlier to
the extreme tardiness of the shovellers who
used to be sweepers, and had invited them
to put a bit more gusto into it. The Bul-
letin for one absolutely refuses to believe
that any part of the army of laborers that
looks to the City Council for bread is in-
capable of shovelling, even after it has been
street-cleansing for a spell. Whoever was in
charge of the soil-transfer job must have
known it was going sloav—far too slow.
Why didn’t he, or they, do something to
accelerate matters? The answer seems to
be that Mr. Deane would have been very
displeased, and that it is not safe for City
.Council officers, however highly placed, to
displease Mr. Deane. And if the job had
cost 30 times as much as it ought to, it
would have been Mr. Deane’s duty to say
that the men who employ him and pay him
to look after their interests were not to
blame, and equally his duty to find a scape-
goat higher up. Mr. Deane belongs to the
Imperial caste that tells Labor aldermen
and members of Parliament what they are
to do; which appoints them and dismisses
them. The power of this caste rests on a
foundation of manual labor, and naturally
it follows that a Labor-dominated City Coun-
cil must frame its policy to provide the
greatest good for the greatest number—of
manual laborers in its employ. Such a
policy is cock-eyed and dumb, and a general
nuisance, as the more intelligent of Labor
leaders perceive. But about the only thing
they can do about it is to get out of the
movement. Which is quite unsatisfactory,
especially if they do nothing when they
get out.

Things We Have to Know.
Dear Bulletin, —Only one whose job, like
mine, is to search the newspapers daily for
news that is new knows how astonishingly
standardised is that necessary commodity
which the staider journals call “intelligence”
in oblique compliment to their readers. Stan-
dardised foods, standardised work, standard-
ised politics, standardised education and
standardised news—it is logical enough. But
what power over the outlook of readers, and
therefore the predominantly intellectual sec-
tion of the people, have the two or three self-
selected agencies which standardise and dis-
tribute that news? The sameness of the news
read and re-read in the course of a day’s
clipping is not so much the subject of won-
der, for the sameness is explained by the
fact that all news in Australia is distributed
by two main agencies and raked in from
oversea through not more than anothe..- two.
Subscribers attach different special and even
copyrighted titles to the service when it is
presented through their columns, but study
of the verbiage of the messages proves that
the differences are solely those of title, not
of matter. It is the selection of news that
is the compelling factor, and is one that
leaves the student puzzled to know who is
the selector and upon what lines he, she or
it works. For instance, in London, New
York, or even some obscure village in Britain
or America, some obscure person will say
some sort of not-very-thrilling remark, or will
perpetrate some usually sordid or moronic
deed. Forthwith that trifle sets upon its jour-
ney through Christendom. According to the
paper which receives it, it is given screamer
heads or the obscurity of a foot-of-columu
fill-up par., but there it is—paper after paper,
town after town. The bigger news goes, too,
but that, of course, is to be expected: if there
were no radio, telegrams or any means of
communication outside the smoke-signal, that
kind of news would circulate. I recall several
nonentities who have assuredly been put upon
the world’s map simply through the medium
of the news-machine which tells Australia
that which it is decreed by the machine that
it should know. When the English and
American mails arrive they disclose that the
Old World is rich with happenings and com-
ments that leave the news-pabulum served to
Australia a very lean thing indeed; but be-
cause these have not appealed to the cus-
tomary newsmongers, and because there is
no other channel whereby they may reach this
benighted country, they are not circulated.
The discovery of riches also applies to the
smaller Australian provincial newspaper. The
intra-Australian news-services cover a re-
markable amount of ground, but the closer
search of papers which obtains in a clipping
bureau reveals what an amount they do not
cover. All sorts of undiscovered epics peep
from the sheets of Dead Horse Gullies and
Battlers’ Ends in remoter Australia. Many
of them reach The Bulletin, but by that
time they do not conform to the Northcliffian
definition of “news.” Cost accounts, no
donbt, for this very casual standardising oi
news. The news-service, distributor only and
not collector of information,, thanks its stars
it can secure so much at so small an expense


Mere words cannot express
their Infinite superiority.

The Allancocks in Trouble Again.
The Vic. Allan-Peacock Ministry has
spent another week-end “considering its posi-
tion.” It is used to being defeated once a
week, but this time the thing happened twice
—on Tuesday, when ,an adjournment motion
was carried against it because of its refusal
to over-ride the Railway Commissioners in
the Milvain case, and on Wednesday, when
the House refused to go into committee to
consider the proposed tax on bookmakers, its
mind being still full of the Milvain affair.
The Allancocks are often wrong, but in
supporting the stand the Railway Commis-
sioners have taken concerning Milvain, they
are right. Milvain was the motorman of
the electric train which ran into the rear
of another “spark” waiting at the Caulfield
station on May 26. Two passengers were
killed, and a score or more injured. Sent
for trial on a charge of manslaughter, Mil-
vain was acquitted. He is now being charged
before the departmental Board of Discipline
with breaches of the regulations. According
to all the Labor members and a few
“Liberals,” this is contrary to the “funda-
mental principles of British justice,” inas-
much as “the man is being tried twice for
the same offence.” The reply is that because
he was held guiltless of crime, it doesn’t
follow that he was guiltless of negligence,
and that an. intolerable position would arise
if a jury’s verdict cancelled all proceedings
for the enforcement of the regulations. The
Board of Discipline was established, to try
employees charged with breaches of these
regulations. It comprises a chairman
(Sutton, retired secretary of railways), a
Commissioners’ advocate and a representa-
tive of the employees. It is strict, but fair.
After the historic Sunshine smash the driver
concerned was charged with manslaughter.
He, too, was found not guilty. But he had
been guilty of carelessness, he had broken
regulations framed to protect the travelling
public, and on this being proved to the satis-
faction of the Board of Discipline, he was
dismissed. The same principle is involved
in tlie Milvain case, and the politicians
should keep their meddlesome hands off. If
political influence is imported into these mat-
'ers there will be an end of discipline and
, fficiency, as the Commissioners declare, and
Iwo other States have learned.

The Half-caste.
"Anophele”: To the Resident Engineer for
railway construction in the Northern Terri-
tory must be assigned full credit for a rather
daring and highly successful experiment with
the much-abused and ill-used half-caste and
colored male labor about Darwin. The min-
ing boom in the early years of this century
brought to these parts 100-odd tin-scratchers
and eopper-gougers, mostly from Queensland
and Westralia. When they disappeared they
left behind them a rather heavy crop of half-
castes, whom I have since seen grow from
bright, cheeky, lovable brats to sullen, useless
boys and youths, quick to acquire most of the
vices of the yellow man and low white.
Seldom in employment, their teens have been
mostly a barren period. From messenger
boys and such like, most of them were drafted
on to the indigent ration list, with here and
there an odd one finding a place in the laboi
gangs on the water-front or railway jobs.
But “last on and first off” was the rule in
their case, and invariably they found them-
selves the butt of insulting remarks from
some of their fellow-workers. This is the
material that the Resident Engineer selected
for a trial. He chose the ironstone-ballast
pit near the railhead as the testing ground
and gave a job to all who offered, with the
result that this day he has a gang of 25
working away contentedly under a sympa-
thetic ganger and powder monkey, stiffened
with half a dozen carefully-selected white
navvies of the old type. He is getting results,
too. Watching them the other day I was
astounded to see the change wrought in what
12 months ago looked like the scum of China-
town. Here was a contented gang of colored
pick-and-sliovel men with a muscular develop
ment that was really surprising. The mar
ried men had their wives with them; camped
in the neat white tents supplied them, they
were preparing meals for their navvy lords
away from the smells and vices of the town
and the vicious atmosphere of the low and
idle camp life of Darwin. Here was a prob
lem tackled and solved by a youthful Queens-
land engineer after it had baffled at least
half a dozen Administrations.

“Tuart” : Since 1826 Sydney has had a
P’emale School of Industry, supported and
controlled by Anglicans, whence have issued
multitudes of good cooks, needlewomen and
housekeepers. At the hundredth annual
meeting of subscribers it was plaintively
announced that the supply of students had
been dwindling for years, and was now so
small that, in the judgment of the Anglican
authorities, it was no use carrying on. Legis-
lative sanction has since been obtained for
dissolving the trust and handing the pro-
perty over to the controllers of the C. of E.
hostels for girls. So passes an interesting
relic of the old colonial days; but it had
to go. The name was against it, for one
thing; “female” is as obsolete as the pave-
ment-sweeping skirt. They are all “ladies”
now. Moreover, the modern miss who has
got to earn her own living is not going
to take up housework when she can become
an office-lady or a sales-lady, with a pros-
pect of getting her picture in the photo-
graphic press showing large expanses of limb
and torso which used to be reserved for the
inspection of the husband, when the husband
arrived. Domestic training was all very well
for Mum and Grandma, but it limits a girl’s
chances of winning the competition for the
Most Unclothed Surfer, the Most Ravishing
Bingle, the Most Perfect Ankles (the ankle
being situated nine inches north of the
knee), the Most Popular .Tazzer and the

“Weaver” : A recent Bulletin par. recorded
a start with the weaving of Australian
cotton tweed, and now the Yarra Falls Tweed
Mills are getting busy with a £500,000 cotton-
mill proposition. The Granville (N.S.W.)
Woollen Mills are another half-million
cotton venture, and the Sydney Vicars, who
have spun and woven worsteds and woollens
for two generations, have also taken up
cotton. Customs Minister Pratten, who
stuck to his duty on cotton tweed in the face
of strong opposition and introduced the
bounty a little later, has thus evoked such
a response as rarely falls to the fortune of any
Minister, and if all goes well his action
should prove one of the biggest things yet
done for Australian industry.

“Deu Jong” : A feature of the fighting in
China which has interested veterans of the
second Boer War is the resurrection of the
Maxim-Nordenfelt one-pounder, otherwise
the pom-pom. The little gun is reported
to have done good service for the British in
the river fighting. In S’Africa, however, it
was something of a dud. Certainly Brother
Boer found it useful on the Modder River
front among the closely-packed British in-
fantry formations, but against the fast-
moving or extended mounted troops it was
almost harmless, and when we adopted it
later the experience was repeated. In the
course of two years spent with various flying
columns the writer saw thousands of the
lib. shells fired, with no visible damage to
anyone. Early in the Great War they were
tried against aircraft, and later a pom-pom
was occasionally seen on motor-patrol boats,
but without startling the world. Now they
seem to have at last come into their own
against the massed rabble of the Chinese
Reds.

“.T.C.8.”: I knew Singapore well 20 years
ago and recently decided to renew my
acquaintance with it. I found it rapidly
changing into a modern city. Huge concrete
structures have replaced the dirty but pic
turesque old shops and dwellings, and an up-
to-the-minute railless tram service was being
installed, and hundreds of motor vehicles
compete with rickshaws for the dollars and
cents of travellers. But the deepest impres-
sion of my visit was that the white man
has lost much of his old prestige. Niggers
of all shades and races treat him with fami-
liarity, tinged in many cases with contempt
or at least pity. One explanation offered is
that hundreds of whites went broke during
the great slump after the war, becoming
so impecunious that they had to do the most
degrading and shameful things in Oriental
eyes to get a meal or drink. Another reason
for the change might be the seepage of news
of Canton and Hongkong happenings. There
is little doubt that some of the Bolshevik
venom comes through. The household ser-
vants are growing careless or insolent, and yet
I was told that “We must bear it or walk
out.” Friends with whom I had been invited
to stay I found on arrival to be living at an
hotel, whilst their own bungalow was closed
up, being servantless.

“Gregor” : So far as Australia is concerned,
there is something attractive about the hypo-
thesis of “continental drift” put forward by
Wegener, the Austrian scientist. It sug-
gests that all the land-masses of the earth
were formerly joined together, being later
broken into their present units by the'
wrenching-away from the earth of the moon.
In support of this theory, it is men-
tioned that when the eastern coastline of
America is compared with the western one
of Africa opposite to it, the two fit into each
other like the edges of a jig-saw puzzle.
Similar evidence in support of the hypothesis
can be found much closer home. An inspec-
tion of the coastline of Northern Australia
reveals that a good portion of it almost
exactly complements the opposite Papuan
littoral: one of the projections of the south-
western New Guinea coast fits exactly into
the Gulf of Carpentaria, Cape York going
into the indentation on the eastern side,
. while Arnhem’s Land fits into the Dutch
New Guinea Gulf. In a * V,, between
this agreement does not exist, thei . t j l(J
them small islands, which m S narts
cause. The theory, if applied
would explain the similarity m the floia an I
fauna of the two countries.
Queensland, for all her casual methods, has
never been a happy liunting-groun -
medical quack and empiric, as Victoria, tor
instance, has been. Two of the f ‘
were rounded up the other day fo
ing the 1925 Medical Act, a net of fair y
small mesh. The charge in each case was
that the offender “held himself out as a
doctor,” and both were convicted and mmt
One said he was a “doctor of electio-medi-
cal therapeutics” and a licentiate o
“Royal Canadian College.’ The othei held
a diploma from the Chicago University in
chiropractics. Here is another lnstmiee
a badly-needed Federal Act. At present
any graduate of the College of Quacks w
strikes trouble in one State can cross ic
border into another whose lawmakers are
more credulous or negligent, and recommence
the gentle business of skinning the public
alive.
“A.8.W.”: The other Saturday afternoon
the narrow-gauge train which fussily nego-
tiates the Dandenongs (Vic.) from Fern tree
Gully to Gembrook was approaching the
level-crossing near the junction of the Bel-
grave and Olinda roads,_ when one of the
new railway ’buses, on its downhill course
from Belgrave, dashed across the rails and
cleared the train by a whisker. Emblazoned
across the rear of the ’bus was Commissioner
Clapp’s pet slogan: “Cross Crossings Cau-
tiously.” I was told that even the engine-
driver and fireman guffawed. So did I
but not till next day. I was one of the bus
passengers.

That inconsequent section which insists
that Australia should have the right of re-
maining neutral in the event of Britain going
to war has a Chorus in South Africa. Prime
Minister Hertzog, now at the Imperial Con-
ference in London, is the leader of the
Afrikander optimists. Canada, if it is
content to creep under the petticoats of the
U.S.A., may be safe; but if either S. Africa
or Australia decided to remain neutral in
Britain’s next war, it would have a lively
time trying to persuade an enemy at war
with the British Empire that, though it was
in the Empire, it wasn’t in the war. And
how about the use of the “neutral”
dominion’s ports and resources? If it was
refused, to an enemy, there would be trouble;
if it was allowed—well, we certainly wouldn t
belong to the Empire any more.

“M.G.S.”: “Many personal experiences, of
a pleasantly lucrative nature, attach them-
selves to the pseudo-science of bacteriology,”
remarks Helena MacDougall, lion. sec.
Melbourne branch of the British Union for
Abolition of Vivisection, commenting on my
article on the Commonwealth Serum Labora-
tory. The Commonwealth Serum Labora-
tory, it should be unnecessary to state, is a
Federal institution which (unexpectedly)
makes a profit on the sale of its productions.
The profits are devoted to further search for
methods of protecting the community, includ-
ing Helena MacDougall, from the ravages
of cancer and other diseases. The hard-
working civil servants employed in this splen-
did effort have the , “pleasant personal experi-
ence” of drawing inadequate monthly
salaries, and run no small risks in earning
them.

“Old Unionist”: N.S.W. Minister for
Labor Badoeley lias promised to give the
people who make up the Insurance Agents,
Canvassers and Collectors’ Association a
chance to secure a regulation of mostly bad
conditions under the Industrial Arbitration
Act. The first union to cover these spas-
modic workers was formed in 1910 ; but those
who had jobs worth keeping developed fears,
those who were less lucky couldn’t pay their
fees, and a man who pushed himself into an
official position spent what money there was
gloriously on beer. Even at this date the
association more recently formed has to feel
its way to the court which most people
suppose is prepared to fix the conditions of
any body of workers who apply for an award.
It is a mixed army, recruited from the multi-
tude of people turned out of our schools with
nothing except a general education and, for
the most part, not much of that; and only
a very small percentage of the army which
desperately tackles the infinite variations of
“commission work” possesses the qualities
which go to the earning of big money. A
few who have got these qualities make
incomes that prosperous captains of industry
might envy, and usually become employers
of commission workers lacking their own
initiative; the balance includes many who
make from fair to good livings, and a multi-
tude who are permanent failures. To equit-
ably fix conditions of employment for this
motley army is a mighty problem; yet the
very helplessness of the lower strata makes
them proper subjects for whatever protec-
tion and aid a board can offer.

POLITIAL
POINTS
The Vic. Labor party has established an-
other claim to the gratitude of its friend
McShortodds. It periodically saves him from
the tote, and last Aveek, with the help of a
few soreheaded Libs, and Cockies, it saved
him from the 14 p.c. tax on his turnover.
With the gleeful shouts of McShortodds ring-
ing in its ears, the party will noAv resume
its war on capitalists like the McKays, who
establish great industries employing thou-
sands of Australian artisans, and are there-
fore beyond the pale. McShortodds Avill go
on depositing unearned wealth in the bag
where the drugged conscience of political
Labor reposes, being the Workers’ Friend.
Holding high bumpers charged with the
best, the clan of McShortodds toasted Grand
Master SnoAvball last week a few hours after
he had helped to throw out of the Vic.
Assembly the preliminary resolution relat-
ing to the imposition of a tax of 14 p.c. on
the turnover of odds-layers. It was the
last kind of compliment SnoAvball looked
for, and he was about as well pleased with
it as he would be with a guard of honor
supplied by the I libernian Society. SnoAv-
ball and three other independent supporters
of the Ministry (Evcrard, Dunstan and Car-
lisle) voted against the motion, which was
defeated by one vote.
When the chairmanship of committees was
vacant in the Vic. Assembly, Carlisle, of
Benalla, aspired to it, and thought that he
could just about capture it Avitli the help
of Labor if his fellow-cdckies Avould coun-
tenance his candidature. But he got no
encouragement. Allan proposed Farthing,
Avho was chosen. It may have been a co-
incidence, but Carlisle voted agin the Guv'-
ment the first chance he got on a vital
question and placed it in a minority. Of
course it is disappointing to have been in
Parliament 24 years and to have Avon no-
thing but a short-lived honorary job in a
stop-gap Ministry; still, when he appeared
in the party room after his vote he avus
shown the door.
The Federal Arbitration Court was
assured in Melbourne by the president of
the A.R.U. that “the 44-liour week had been
introduced in the Westralian railway service
without extra cost.” whereat Commissioner
Pope must have smiled grimly. In his 1925-
26 report, Pope states that “additional per-
manent staff were necessary in connection
with the introduction of 44 hours per week”
(the introduction has been gradual, having
begun in 1921) ; there were 7615 hands on
June 30, 1925, and 8014 on June 30, 1926.
And in recording a loss of £31,900 for the
year, the man who led the 16th Battalian
explains that he had to find an extra
£98,000 for “increase in rates of pay and
reduction in hours of work.”
Speaking to an Eight-Hour audience at
Goulburn (N.S.W.), Tully, M.L.A., said
that the 44-hour wc<4{ had been a rich bless-
ing to N.S.W., and “most of the companies
in N.S.W. had increased their profits 50
per cent, during the last feAv months.” He
gave no names of the enriched companies,
but it Avould have been a pleasure if he had
been able to add that the railways and tram-
ways had increased their profits 50 per cent,
instead of showing a heavy loss, and that
the Sydney Harbor bridge would cost less
under the new system.
One of the blessings of the 44-hour Aveek
has been brought home to a section which
voted solidly in favor of it 17 months ago.
For years the people of the Ma State’s
northern coalfield have been asking for the
construction of a 40-mile line from Cessnock
to Cockle Creek. With Labor in, the appro-
val of the Public Works Committee was
taken for granted, but that body has stag-
gered the coalfields by turning the proposal
doAvn. The 44-hour Aveek lias put 9 per
cent, on to the estimated cost of £832,000,
and with so many other works to be pro-
vided for there is no possibility of raising
that amount of money, even though a full-
blown peer is acting for the necessitous State
in London.
THE WANDERLUST.
NQUIRER : " All away again, Constable?”
The S.A. Auditor-General’s report con-
tains a pitiless exposure of the fiction that
the States never borrow except for reproduc-
tive works. On June 30, 1926, S. Aus. had
spent £88,701,619 of borrowed money: of
this £21,583,442 was represented by fully
reproductive works, £38,210,356 by partly
reproductive works, and the balance by non-
reproductive Avorks. The S.A. taxpayer had
to find £1,012,136 last year for interest on
non-reproductive works, and “a continuance
of the present rate of loan expenditure on
non-reproductive works (£6,836,000 was
splashed up from loans last year) makes
extra taxation inevitable, if that stage has
not now been reached.”
South Australia has lost £97,000 on
the Labor Government’s Thousand Homes,
according to the Auditor-General’s estimate.
The Commonwealth Government dropped
nearly two millions on its War Service
Homes, though not one-tenth of the Diggers
applied for edifices. These facts ought to
restrain the Bruce-Pages from rushing into
another Government building scheme, to cost
£20,000,000, but probably they won’t. It
is questionable if anything can restrain these
enthusiastic amateurs when they are bent
on butting in. They hurriedly produced a
£20,000,000 road scheme, regardless of three
States’ opposition, and imposed a new petrol
tax, explaining that the companies wouldn’t
dare to pass it on. The companies have
now passed it on, and the Government is
talking feebly of reprisals, which will be
equally feeble, no doubt.
In the last couple of years Maoriland’s
whole system of bookkeeping has been
altered. It seems clear, however, that,
despite a complete change in the methods of
railway management, the railways are still
losing money. A “surplus” of £21,000 is
claimed by the Railway Board as the result
of its first complete year of working, but the
accounts show that £360,000 was taken from
the Consolidated Fund to balance “losses on
branch lines.” The Government takes the
vieAV that branch lines sho’uld be regarded
as developmental, and paid for as such out
of taxes. But any undertaking could show
a profit if it was allowed to put unprofitable
portions into a separate account and debit
someone else with the losses; and the worst
of us Avould have a front seat in Heaven
if the recording angel kept his books on the
same principle.
An item of evidence before the N.S.W.
Bribery Committee: —
The Premier said that he did not believe any
member of the Labor Party would take a bribe.
No, nor offer one either. Lang himself, for
instance, wouldn’t dream of offering the “In-
dependent” Kay a highly-paid job to throw-
up his seat in Parliament, so that it might
be handed to a pledged Lang supporter.
The worried men who run Queensland
imagine they see something ahead which
Avill help to balance the losses on the State
cattle-stations, copper-mines, etc. The pros-
pect is that a lot of pastoral leases are
falling in, and the hope is that the land
may be re-let to Private Enterprise at
greatly increased rentals. It is held that
Private Enterprise Avill naturally make a
profit in addition to paying rent and taxes,
though the State stations pay neither and
make nothing. It seems a pretty rough reflec-
tion on State enterprise; but the Queensland
Government ought to know.
Queensland collects almost twice as much
from its mostly pastoral tenants as Victoria,
Tasmania, South Australia and Westralia
put together, the revenue from this source
having nearly doubled since the famous
breach of faith in 1920, and still more is
hoped for when the present leases fall in.
After the illegal raising of rents in 1920 the
State, applied for a Federal bonus on the
export of cattle by reason of the distressed
condition of the industry, and the Federal
Ministry, being a meek and obliging ass,
consented. If the fowl which lays the fairly
reliable golden egg fails to respond to the
further demands in any large way, it will
only be another disappointment in a world
where such things are common.
Emma Goldman, the strong-minded lady
whom Chicago reporters used to star as “the
Red Virgin,” and who in pre-war days was
unceasing in her endeavors to induce the
proletariat to arise in its might, east off its
shackles and dance on the face of the capi-
talist, arrived in Canada a few days ago
from Russia, where she has been living since
she was expelled from the United States in
1919. She says of Soviet rule: —
The political institutions of Russia are worse
now than they were under the Czars. That does
not mean that I favor a return to Czardom. but when
people rise in two revolutions, as the Russians did,
one has a right to expect a little more in the
way of freedom and well-being than under the
terrible regime of the Czars.
Even Red Virgins live and learn.
Before its execution the Queensland
Upper House rejected four times a bill for
a railway over the Dawes Range (C.Q.).
Since then the Labor Government has
approached the range with a railway from
both sides. But that was before the last
election. After it the job was stopped
abruptly. In Queensland railways are in-
ventions for carrying politicians back to
office.
The latest steamboat hold-up (if there
are no more while these remarks are getting
into print) was that of the Werribee at
Geelong. The union officials held it a self-
evident truth that they should select and
supply the crew, and the owners held it a
self-evident truth that the people who paid
the wages should select the crew, always
inside the union circle. Arbitration is as
useless in such a case as it was between
the Inquisition and the heretic. The position
is similar to that in the British coal dispute.
One side says it is a divine law that wages
should remain up even if the price of coal
has gone down till the value of the product
won’t pay the wages, and the other says
that there is no such law. The Werribee
was held up before for nearly a year over
the same point, and at the end of that time
agreement was no nearer.
Whether Theodore Avas or wasn’t “re-
quested by Mr. Lang to bring about peace
in the ranks of N.S.W. Labor” (he says he
Avas, and Lang denies it), the factions were
beautifully unanimous on one very interest-
ing point. The Worker editor mentions it
in his first-hand account of the negotiations:
Both the Premier and Mr. Willis, Vice-President
of the Executive Council, had no objection whatever,
they said, to Mr. Bailey being readmitted to the
A.L.P. It could easily be done. .. . Mr. "Willis turned
to Mr. Bailey and said: “I give you my Avord. here,
that as I was the man who moved the resolution
that put you out, I will move the resolution that
will bring you in.”
Bailey was wiped out for life on a charge
of being concerned in the business of the
ballot-box with sliding panels. Willis took
credit for the wiping out, and asserted that
he had thereby “cleaned up the movement.”
Now, being in a gorgeous Ministerial job
which is endangered by the manoeuvres of
Bailey and the Bailey union, lie is perfectly
willing to thrust Bailey on the movement
again. Willis is the kind of “reformer” that
Pecksniff would have loved.
Gabled reports make it appear that the
clutch of circumstance may affect even the
brotherhood of the proletariat. The Mos-
cow Government has intimated that the
latest “gift” of 500,000 roubles to the Brit-
ish miners’ funds will also be the last. The
reason offered has a horribly capitalistic
flavor. It is that any further subs, might
injure the excellent M. Krassin’s chances of
biting John Bull’s capitalistic ear for a loan
of 20 millions sterling.
The Labor majority in Sydney’s City
Council made a new departure over an ordei
for electric lamps. There are eight estab-
lishments in Australia which make electric
lamps, but they didn’t appear in the story.
It was first proposed that French lamps
should be imported, through a Sydney firm
of agents, in place of British ones, the alleged
purpose being “to smash the combine.” How
the Labor aldermen know that there is a
combine in Britain, and not in France, is
a mystery. The expert who- manages the
city's electrical department has lately been
in Europe, inspecting lamps and other things,
and he was strongly against the proposal,
but he was over-ruled. In the end it was
decided to tell the Sydney firm of middlemen
to get busy, Avithout stating definitely of
what nationality the lamps Avould be. ' On
a previous occasion, wheh it Avas a question
of importing Italian motor-cars at a higher
price than British ones, Alderman English
said lie had every right to look after the
interests of his friend who was in the trade.
Over the lamp matter he was merely
reported as saying that lie had special
reasons for acting as he did, and no one
contradicted him.
SOLIDARITY FOR EVER!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Messrs. Loughlin and K. O. Hoad, M.L.A.,
arrived at a meeting of the A.L.P. at Junee and
voted Mr. Kenny, the local president, out of the
chair in favor of Mr. J. E. Hoad, M.L.C. Mr.
Kenny, having presently resumed the chair, was
pushed out of it, and the meeting broke up into
two sections, which carried votes of confidence in
Mr. Lang and censure on Mr. Loughlin, and vice-
versa.”
The legions of Lang
In order were set,
With clatter and clang
Came a turbulent gang
And the hall-rafters rang
With the clash as they met.
’Twas bold Loughlin, pardie!
Full of combative glee,
And young Hoad, M.L.A., and old Hoad, M.L.C.,
Who flung themselves into the fray at Junee.
Boss Kenny, begad !
Took his seat in the chair,
A broth of a lad,
But some reckoned he had
Less title than Dad,
Dad Hoad, to be there.
There was hot repartee
AA'hen they couldn’t agree
And mutual exchanges were lurid and free
AVhen the factions collided at rural Junee.
What with' bellicose shout
And tumultuous din,
’Twas matter for doubt
The barney throughout
Which chairman was out
And which one was in,
Till at last you might see
In fierce vis-a-vis
Two meetings a-whoop in vociferous key,
For Lang and for Loughlin, at riven Junee.
They must cease from their knocks
And the hatchet be hid,
They must eat from one box,
The Langs and the Loughs,
The lion and ox,
The wolf and the kid;
So runs the decree,
But as long as there be
A Hoad, M.L.A., or a Hoad, M.L.C.,
’Twill be hard to enforce it, they say, at Junee.

It was a rich year for Electrolytic Zinc.
The div. was lifted to 12 p.c. for both
classes of shares —prefs. are 8 p.c. cum.,
but follow the ords. point for point beyond
that rate. The return compares poorly with
the opulent distributions made by the lead-
zinc mining cos., but Electrolytic Zinc is.
predominantly manufacturing, although the
mining side should develop rapidly from now
on. Shareholders look for rich returns
with metal prices at such profitable levels.
But whatever their desires in the matter, the
board of financial heavyweights is not likely
to be influenced to undue liberality at the
expense of strength. Thus far, the co. has
built strongly. After all, the beginning dates
back only 10 years, and it is but six since
• the proprietary was turned into a public co.
It got its start and gained an impetus
through the Empire’s war necessities and
war orders, and a guaranteed purchase price
by the British Government insured its suc-
cess. Big Bill Baillieu, as financial chief,
and Gepp, as technological head, were a com-
bination which soon won results. By March,
1923, the co. was using the full 30,000-h.p.
originally contracted for from the Tas. Gov-
ernment’s hydro-electric undertaking; an
additional 3000 h.p. was added four months
later, and last year the volume was raised
to 34,000 h.p. Zinc production has expanded
to 128 tons per day; and although the total
output last term compared with 1925 was
a shade less, that was because of the shorter
period covered by the financial year. In
addition to the 46,583 tons of zinc produced,
180 tons of cadmium wrnre recovered, resi-
dues containing 261 tons copper and 47,4000 z.
silver were shipped to Kembla, and silver-
lead product containing 8000 tons lead and
1,179,0000 z. silver sent to Port Pirie. From
those figures it would appear that little of
value was left after the co.’s technical staff
and the Kembla and Pirie experts had
finished with the material that came to them.
Gepp, however, believes that the zinc at
present in the silver-lead residue, and which
finds a resting-place as slag in the dumps
fit Port Pirie, can be saved; he hands on the
torch to his successor with the remark that
“it is certain that in due course the recovery
of this zinc will be achieved.”
Electrolytic Zinc is interested in more
than the lviining of zinc. The bulk of its
raw supplies comes from Broken Hill, and,
unless something very bad happens to the
markets, there is little likelihood of any
diminution from that quarter for a long
while. But the co. has its own zinciferous
deposits—the Mt. Read-Rosebery field on
the Tasmanian west coast —from which it
is drawing increasing supplies of concen-
trates. These are being handled systemati-
cally. Developmental and investigational
work has gone on steadily. Zeehan mill is
in use, and the question of recoveries is
being examined earnestly. Diamond-drilling
on Mount Read has proved the existence of
a body of ore superior to the average run
of ore on the field. One drill-hole at the
southern end of the field has proved the lode
350 ft. vertically below the present lowest
workings; about 1000 ft. northwards the drill
has proved the existence of a body of good
grade sulphides. The ores are complex—-
the big trouble with n.-w. Tasmanian de-
posits—but there has been remarkable im-
provement in treatment methods of recent
years, and what was impossible is already
only difficult. Australian metallurgists have
led the world in discoveries and processes for
the treatment of lead and zinc; and they
are not resting on the laurels already won.
To strengthen its staff, the board has retained
Professor David Masson as consultant in
an intensive study which is to be undertaken
over the next few years.
Production (allowing for the shorter
period—five days—covered by the accounts)

The gain in metals other than zinc was sub-
stantial, and the average daily output of
zinc rose from 1264 tons to 128 tons.
Average prices over the same period have
been as follows :

The increase in the average price of zinc
was worth £65,000, which the lessened rates
for silver and lead reduced to £45,000. Some
of the brightness has now disappeared: at
latest zinc had declined to £34 ss. and
lead to £3O 12s. 6d. Accepting the co/s own
profit as shown —£420,699 —it made £9 per
ton, the return from the other sources assist-
ing, of course. Latterly consignments of
concentrates from the Barrier have been
considerably finer, and this has made further
demands on Electrolytic Zinc’s specialists.
The difficulties have been steadily overcome.
Two years ago, the co. started to make
superphosphates, the gases from the roasters
at Risdon being captured at a highly-profit-
able figure. The output of sulphuric acid
from the Pirie plant is being sold to S. Aus.
superphosphate works. With 20,000 tons
of acid from that plant and 10,000 tons from
Risdon, the subsidiary industry is a substan-
tial one. Still further extensions are being
made in order to meet expected expansion in
demand for superphosphates from Tas-
manian consumers, who are being educated
in the use of fertiliser. Last year’s produc-
tion was 16,098 tons.

“Investigational research and general de-

in the books at £190,921. It is offset by
various funds totalling £537,968, which pro-
duces the net reserves, £347,047, of the intro-
ductory table. There is a reserve, too, for
depreciation and renewals which, at June
30, amounted to £575,932. The reserves are
almost wholly in plant, etc., and the position
is governed by its profit-earning capacity.

In its first term the co. claimed an “aggregate
net profit” of £36,039; but that was after
£lOO,OOO had been added to goodwill. In
1925, £18,357 was shown and, after prefs.
had been attended to, ordinaries were given
5 p.c. Profit for the 12 months ended June
30 last according to the accounts, was £26,167 ;
but another £9032 fell from somewhere into
reserves. In 1925 £14,000 was transferred to
general reserve; in the latest accounts “sun-
dry reserves” appear at £23,032. A further
£6OOO is to be transferred, and that amount,
with the £3473 balance at p. and 1. will lift
accumulations to £32,505. The grouping is
not to be commended. The label suggests
that some at least of the reserves are specific,
and with £200,000 of goodwill in the balance-
sheet, it is desirable that investors know
exactly what the position is. Nor would it
be straining things to show the provision for
depreciation. Newspaper machinery, plant
and fittings lead fast lives, and with competi-
tion keen to the point of impoliteness the
latest plant is the latest only until a com-
petitor goes one better.
Balance-sheet figures moved in the right
direction :

Premises were a trifle more; machinery,
plant, etc., almost £lOOO less. But the
figures afford no means of judging what was
put aside to cover wear and tear, and much
depends on that. Additions are being made
to the present building and additional plant
is on order. “The company will be able to
meet this expenditure without calling for
additional capital,” says Joynton Smith; but
it will certainly have to go outside for assist-
ance. Incidentally, liabilities at June 30
include £7OOO, “dividends unpaid to ordinary
shareholders,” who agreed to allow the sum
to remain with the co. free of charge until
such time as the co.’s working capital is
adequate.
It looks as if the co. has turned the cor-
ner. Judging on past records, the Weekly’s
profits were something a shade over £80,000;
so the daily is probably making a few pounds
profit. If it isn’t doing that it is making
a few pounds loss —there can’t be much
either way. It is not doing any better now
than it was a few months ago, and competi-
tion isn’t easing by any means; in fact, the
fight has not yet developed to the full. The
real fight, of course, is for circulation, and
whether that can be captured for good by the
new baits that have of late been used has yet
to be proved. The public is interested only
in the prefs. (9 p.c. cum.) and their 9 p.c
is easily earned. Their security, however, is
poor: at June 30 net tangible assets amounted
to £132,497, equal to 17s. Bd. for each prof.
But the market isn’t troubled; it offers 245.
for any shares available. Ords. are held by
Joynton Smith and his associates.

In June, 1925, there was a reconstruction.
Shareholders agreed to give Edward Fay,
Ltd., control with 10,000 ordinaries pur-
chased from chairman Joe Gardiner in re-
turn for the conversion of the other 70,000
ords. to prefs. carrying 10 p.c. cumulative
with an extra p.c. whenever ords. receive
20 p.c. or more. Prefs. were given ample
protection—equal voting with ords. on ques-
tions affecting pref. rights or in the event
of the div. being three months or more over-
due. Otherwise, the pref.-holders have one
vote for 10 shares against ords.’ one vote
for one share. Any issue of shares with
rights equal or prior to present prefs. re-
quires the consent of three-quarters of the
shareholders affected, and their sanction is
necessary in the case of an increase in share
capital beyond £100,000; in the case of a
mortgage exceeding £90,000; or in the event
of the proposed sale of the business. The
20,000 ords. then held in reserve were to
be issued for cash only, and this was done
during the past term. Prefs. got their maxi-
mum last year, and as the report declares—
and balance-sheet figures appear to confirm
the statement —that all known contingencies
have been provided for, there are prospects
of the 2\ p.c. addition to their 10 p.c. on
future occasions.
The co.’s turnover is very large and
brisk, and something will have to be
very much amiss if big profits are not
regularly shown. Stocks are the serious
consideration, but in the case of a co. having
such a turnover, difficulty is likely to arise
only from goods that stick to the shelves.
Concerning that danger the report states that
the clearing-out of slow stock received special
attention during the term —a comforting in-
timation. Stocks were £27,199 lighter than
at the previous balance, and the £93,788
represents only about seven weeks’ sales.
Gross profits (£147,205) were only £lB3O
better than in the preceding term, but
general expenditure was cut back by £14,044.
And more was put aside for taxes, and
£3340 written off fittings, plant and lease-
hold premises compared with £2326 for 1925.
The new capital was used in reduction of
liabilities, which were £49,347 lighter than
at the previous balance, the process being
assisted by the reduction in stocks and the
sale of portion of the George-street freehold.
Freeholds stood at £lOO,llO at July 31.
1925; at latest the figure was £83,110. Of
the purchase price of the premises sold
£15,141 was secured by mortgage. For its
part the co. owed £32,726 mortgage, £39,114
cash deposits, and a modest £9038 to trade
creditors. A concern with an annual turn-
over climbing towards three-quarters of a
million is in a position to buy advantage-
ously, and when its policy is prompt pay-
ment it can buy even better. ibesre is
a seller of the prefs. at 31s. Considering
the prospects, it seems a reasonable price.
The co. lias benefited greatly by the stoppage
of the old price-cutting; whether that happy
state of affairs will last only time can show.
A large goodwill has been built up to meet
such a contingency; and the co, is in the
strong position of not having to show any of
it among its assets. #

Profits disclosed were almost as good as
those of the two preceding years. But the
directors dropped the div. a couple of points,
and for the first time for many years ordi-
naries got less than 10 p.c.; £6337 was then
available for reserves. The blow is soft-
ened to old holders by earlier capitalisations.
From one angle the decreased div. is re-
assuring, for although visible reserves after
final appropriations were £44,848 —as good
as the best on record —they are little enough
compared with paid capital of a quarter-
million. And the aggressive competition of
rival cos. marked by intensive advertising
and the absorption of other trading houses
by bigger and more vigorous concerns have
had their effect. Were the old Mutual not
so solidly established it might show the
effects of this competition even more. _ Only
very keen trading will allow a co. with so
much of its capital in real estate to offer
better than 8 p.c.; it has done surprisingly
well to pay 10 p.c. for so long.
Balance-sheet movements compared with
the previous term were unimportant:—

Cash . . . . 18,503 300 300 300
Additions are being made to the co.’s pre-
mises, and these swell the property item.
Stocks were lighter, a favorable movement
if it is certain that the management is not
stinting supplies necessary to hold its cus-
tomers. Book debts increased slightly, and
they are heavy enough. In the case of a
firm which had its beginning about the
middle of last century, however, experience
should have armed it with good judgment
in estimating accounts. Also age has doubt-
less brought with it wisdom in other re-
spects. Certainly the co. made no error in
its buying prior to the slump, for it was
able to continue its divs., and, so far as the
eye could see, profits were not impaired.
In earlier years the writing-off was on rather
a liberal scale, and maybe there is a little
hidden there. Although gross profit last
year was £1443 lower than that won in
1925, exes, were cut back by almost the same
amount. There arc 50,000 8 p.c. prefs., and
they are comfortable both as to support and
div. Ords. seem to be fairly secure at 8
p.c.; 10 p.c. was not beyond last year’s
profit, although the margin was none too
generous. Of the liabilities £45,000 is re-
presented by a mortgage. Recent sales of
ords. were at 255.; and there are visible
net assets of a few' pence less than that to
back’each share, after providing for prefs.

competition and arduous industrial condi-

can only judge from the money they turn

circumstances, not worrying about the secu-
rity, and values the shares at 225., which
gives buyers about 6rv p.c., with the above-
mentioned possibility of a shade better. An
8 p.c. div. would carry the return on the
investment to 7* p.c. But the ordinaries
have still a long way to go before they reach
12 p.c., albeit the average profit of the past
four years would pay it. As a rule there is
no special reason why a holding co. should
build up big reserves; but in this case the
ordinaries may prefer to' assure their own
dividends by strengthening reserves.
* * * *
From Gould McDougall :
“Mining Engineer’s” comparison of prices of
shares in proved tin-producing cos. with “sound
industrial stock” (B. 14/10/’26) is quite feeble.
What sound industrial stock can be bought to yield
“at least 8 p.c.” ? The two which he mentioned
f#»ow 6J and 5J p.c. respectively. The range of sound
industrials showing as high as even 6 p.c. is most
limited. Admitting, therefore, that it is difficult to
Blake a selection of sound industrials to return more
than 6 p.c., why should 20 p.c. be a basis of fair
valuation on which to buy “proved tin-producing cos.’
shares with the metal at £250 London”? The dis-
cerning investor will, of course, make ample allow-
ance in the price he pays for amortisation of capital.
Having dotie so, and estimating profits vvitti tin at
an average price of £250 per ton, a net return of
10 p.c. is far more attractive than 5 p.c. to 6 p.c.
on so-called sound industrials, which in almost every
instance depend on the continued efficient manage-
ment of those who established and built up the
organisation.
With tin over £3OO a mild boom has certainly
developed, and the prices of many stocks are admit-
tedly too high; but indiscriminate criticism is just
as dangerous as indiscriminate buying. While “M.E.”
is quite sound on Kamunting, he misrepresents the
position very badly in some of his instances. Kun-
dang, for example—what reason has he for assum-
ing a recovery of 30 tons monthly ? Malcolm New-
man’s estimate is .81b. per cubic yard. This repre-
sents not less than 40 tons monthly, which, with tin
at an average of £250 and the dredge treating
120,000 cubic yards monthly, means an annual
profit of not less than £50,000. Does he challenge
Newman’s estimate? If so, on what data does he
base his own?
As to Takuapa, why does “Mining Engineer” fore-
cast leaner times while admitting late returns to be
excellent? He is evidently unaware that recoveries
to date merely conform to prospectus estimates and
the general average of the area.
Rawang shares are high. There are more attrac-
tive investments even amongst those criticised by
“M.E.” True, it will take £48,000 per annum to
pay a2O p.c. dividend; but the sluicing plant alone
should easily earn sufficient to cover cost of both
itself and the dredge and leave a good margin, and
the bucket dredge, on Jib. ground, treating, say, even
120,000 yards monthly, should recover 40 tons, repre-
senting a net annual profit of about £40,000. Esti-
mates have been made in quarters to which “M.E.”
evidently has no access that the present rich run of
ground which the dredge is working and the sluicing
plant is entering should within 12 months earn a
surplus profit equal to about 50 p.c. on the com-
pany’s capital. It is interesting to note, by the
way, that the present high market in Rawang is
chiefly due to heavy Eastern buying orders. ‘
“M.E.’s” remarks about Alluvial Tin’s other pro-
perties are just as much at random. He doubts the
depth and states that he knows the Kinta Valley
well and remembers the old hands boring it a
decade ago. A truly remarkable achievement by the
old hands if they really bored the whole valley!
Alluvial Tin has spent over £50,000 on boring merely
sections of this valley. I do not challenge the late
Mr. Bethune’s reliability, and have no doubt that
“the various sections” that he tested generally bot-
tomed at from 30 to 40 feet. The explanation is very
simple, and can be found on reference to the report
of Malcolm Newman on the Malim Nawar South
area, whwein lie stated that the greater part of the
area in question wa» then bored for the first time,
the work being only rendered possible by the recent
canalising of the Kampar River by the F.M.S. Gov-
ernment. Alluvial Tin’s engineers have, as the
result of a costly and extensive boring campaign,
proved the existence of a deep channel of virgin
ground, mostly unbottomed at 80 ft., surrounded
by a limestone area of shallow depth.
The “Wild Cat” (B. 21/10/’26) stated that the
dredges of Malim Nawar and Malim Nawar South
had made a weak reply in their latest returns to
“Mining Engineer.” In the ease of Malim Nawar,
as the official report shows, the poor return is due
to the dredge having encountered a patch of cement
gravel which the boring indicates is limited in
extent; so no significance at all attaches to the
return. As to Malim Nawar South, the dredge is
down 68t't. in ground which “M.E.” alleges does not
exceed 40ft. in depth; and as 45ft. is barren over-
burden, it is difficult to imagine what better return
could have been expected at the present stage.

Belford. Dome, Ltd., the million-pound pro-
position formed to decide whether there is
petroleum on its holding in the Hunter River
valley, and whether the Greta coal seam in
its area is worth while, has altered its treat-
ment of share options in conformity with

From Courtenay Martin, g.m., of Belford
Dome, Ltd.: —-
In referring to Belford Dome prospectus, “Melbourne
Broker” (B. 7/10/’26) complains that it does not com-
ply with the Vic. Companies Act in respect to definite
statements about what cash is being taken by the
vendors and promoters. As a matter of fact, a
definite statement that the vendors are. not taking
any cash is made: “They are prepared to support
their faith in Belford in the decidedly practical
manner of not requiring any money payment, but
have agreed to exchange 250.000 shares in Hunter
River Oil Co. for a similar number of shares in
Belford Dome, Ltd.” But as the co.’s property
is in N.S.W., and as the directors and two-thirds
of the shareholders in the parent Hunter River Oil
reside in N.S.W., why should the co. comply with
the Victorian Act? “Melbourne Broker” wants to
know “how much money Hunter River Oil actually
spent on its coal and oil holdings in the Hunter
River Valley-—surely not more than thousands.” I
have before me a prospectus of Taranaki Oil Fields,
a co. incorporated under the Vic. Companies Act,
and I cannot find how much money the vendors —
the Taranaki Oil Development Co. (N.Z.), Limited,
Alexander Wright Donald and Albert Edward Broue
-—spent on their oil holdings. T would emphasise
the fact that the thousands the Hunter River Oil
did spend were spent to the best advantage and
with economy. Australia’s greatest need is oil, and
Belford Dome is making an honest effort, conducted
on approved lines laid down by successful oilfield
practice, to discover that which will mean so much
to the prosperity and security of our country.

Tanami (N.T.) announces an issue of
40,000 pref. shares of 2s. 6d. if an extraordi-
nary general meeting agrees. Having failed
to secure aid from the Home and Terri-
tories Department, the co. is driven to do
what it should have done at first. The
40,000 new shares will be available to pre-
sent holders on a one-in-four basis, and will
raise the register to 200,000 and capital to
£25,000. They will be called up to 9d. on
application, and be liable to calls of 3d. a
month, with a pull on the old issue, inas-
much as they will be entitled to receive the
net profits until they have had a refund
of their capital. In the event of liquida-
tion, they will likewise have first call. Chair-
man J. T. Beckett states that abnormal
floods held up machinery transport, but the
plant is now at the mine, and A. H. Stewart
is rushing the construction with a view of
early reduction of the heap of ore lying
handy.

Something is amiss at Flagstone (N.5.W.)..
On June 19 it was officially reported that
in No. 1 and No. ,2 tunnels there was so
much high-grade ore opened up “that a suffi-
cient tonnage can be broken from these two
faces to keep the mill going full capacity for
some time to come.” On July 26 No. 1
tunnel was said to carry 26ft. in width of
good-grade ore, and No. 2 was in highly-
payable ore 18ft. across. “Now that these
two faces are in working order a large
tonnage of ore of good average grade can be
won.” On August 7 the manager reported
that in No. 1 tunnel “the lode is being taken
out 26ft. wide, and the ore at present being
won is of the best value since operations
were started at this point.” No. 2 tunnel
was producing “good-grade ore by open cut,
and as we proceed east the lode is widening
and well maintains its values.” September
4 report contained similar eulogies of grades
and widths. October 9 report mentioned that
a tramline was being erected from the work-
ings on the Cartwheel lease to the mill, a
distance of 900 ft., and that when this is
completed “it will enable me to keep the
mill running full time.” The same report
gave 811 tons as the crushing figures from
August 2, when the 10-head battery started,
for 19 ; ] tons concentrates. It seems
inconceivable that an efficient 10-head
battery with 1250-lb. stamps requiring
only a 4in. drop could put in its time
for two months on 811 tons. In June the
manager says he can keep the mill going
full time from Nos. 1 and 2 tunnels; in
October lie has to link up another lease
with 900 ft. of tramline to bring the mill
to full capacity! The market naturally
gives up the job of trying to reconcile these
conflicting statements, and share prices sag
despite a rich market in the metal. With
tin about £2BO in August, fully-paid £5 shares
were at ss. premium, and contribs. paid to
50s. were at 50s. premium. Now, with tin
at £B2O, 50s. is offered all round, meaning
par for contribs. and 50s. discount for paids.

Manna Hill, Stuart Town (N.S.W.), got
only 90oz. from the first 240 tons, and the
co. hastened to explain that fully 90 p.c. of
the ore treated came from ground formerly
worked above No. 1 tunnel, and had to be
taken to keep, the mill going while slopes on
richer ore were being opened up. This, of
course, is quite at variance with an interim
announcement that the mill was running on
2oz. stone. Fortnightly crushing results will
be posted now that three stopes are produc-
ing. The lower tunnel, “on which the mine
depends,” has been driven 585 ft., the lode
having widened to 6ft., and the point
approaches where the best ore in No. 1
tunnel should be picked up. The market
went to the region of 65., while the 2oz. talk
lasted, but the battery cut that price in
halves.

John Fell has asked the Lithgow Warden
to cancel the Shale Oil leases at Newnes
■(N.S.W.), in which the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation sank such a pot of money. The
Corporation had secured suspension after
suspension of working conditions, and had
consented to the cancellation. Fell’s idea is
to tackle the job himself. He has hopes of
co-operative assistance from his workers, and
if he could get it it would be a help. But
high labor costs have been only one of the
causes of past failure. Indeed, everything
was w r rong.
Queensland Antimony still announces in-
creased ore tonnages, but holders who went
above 10s. for scrip wish they hadn't with
sellers at Is. 6d. and buyers offering Is. Id.
That is bad enough for the contribs., on
which only Is. has been called, but the ven-
dors and the second issue paid to 4s. are
no better in Pitt-street. From the mine a
oft. lode of smelting grade in the Black Bess
at 70ft. is said to be opening up bands of
higher-grade ore, and 500 tons will be avail-
able for smelting from this lease when 50ft.
more of driving has been done. On the
Fthcl lease the tunnel has 100 tons ready
for smelting, and at the 70ft. level the apex
of a new lens has been uncovered. As
holders of dear scrip haven’t yet started
trying to average, headway with plant:erec-
tion evidently hasn't been to schedule.

The Redcap Mine, Mungana (N.Q.), pur-
chased by the State for £750 from a pros-
pecting syndicate last April, is opening up
pretty well. At present the manager is
driving a tunnel through the ore body, and
P. L. Goddard, g.-m of State Smelters, is
beginning to feel hopeful that it wall help to
keep the smelters running sweetly and wipe
off a bit of the loss made during the last
couple of years.
Brisbane’s duffer, the Brookfield goldfield,
is not done with yet. An arrangement has
been made for the Rclipse to operate from
No. 2 shaft on a quartz vein, carrying a
leader of mundic. It was a mundic leader
assaying up to 60oz. a ton that caused a lot
of damage when there was a little boom on
in Brookfield’s. The leader was certainly
there and carried the gold, but it had dis-
appeared before late-comers got delivery of
their scrip.

Prospecting work around the new anti-
mony find on the Drummond Range, near
Clermont (C.Q.), has not revealed any new
ore bodies worth testing. Claims have been
amalgamated on the lode and a tunnel is
being driven to connect at 30ft. This will
give good backs and cheapen costs. Thirty
tons of 55 p.c. ore have been despatched, and
eight men are at present on the job.

Tarcoola Blocks is very sanguine about
the prospects of its Northampton leadmine
(W.A.). Last year James Ilebbard reported
favorably on this show, and since then noth-
ing has fallen short of expectations as re-
gards appearance and values. The co. has.
however, been handicapped through shortage
of capital, but by making a 6d. call and
borrowing £3OOO from the Government and
other lenders, this difficulty has, it is stated,
now been overcome.
Chairman Tom Birkbeck was right at the
Kanowna Red Hill meeting when he de-
scribed the show as erratic; it has often
revived when apparently dead. Present
prospects are not the brightest, but manager
James is confident that he wall continue to
unearth rich patches. Higher costs due to
the new Workers' Compensation Act, how-
ever, make the div. outlook misty.
Monthly profits from the Great Victoria
(W.A.) are diminishing. While the co., a
local one. was treating surface laterite results
were encouraging, out little profit is to be got
from the big low-grade lode. The co. put
up a good performance in mining and treat-
ment costs, and deserved something better
than the poor stuff it is getting at depth.
Associated (W.A.) held its annual meet-
ing in London recently, when chairman A.
H. Collier complained of fresh burdens laid
on the gold mining- industry and reckoned
that his namesake’s Labor Government was
not much chop. To induce fresh capital
to come in, in the face of these additional
burdens, he said was practically impossible,
and unless some of them were removed most
of the mines would have to close down. He
hoped that before it was too late the Asso-
ciated and other cos. concerned would re-
ceive fairer treatment. As the cream had
long since been taken off, conditions! should
be made easier, not more onerous. Dealing
with other matters, Collier said that at
present the co.’s biggest Westralian asset
was its holding in Wiluna. This show was
looking well; and, while it was impossible
at Kalgoorlie to treat 30s. ore in relatively
narrow reefs at a profit, it would be very
profitable to treat 40s. ore at Wiluna in
reefs of from anything between 20ft. and
40ft. wide. In the co.’s Golden Mile pro-
perty there is still visible a lot of low-grade
ore, but under present conditions the manager
is hard pressed to make ends meet —and
sometimes doesn't.

Climatic conditions in Malay Peninsula
render it imperative that good housing be
provided for white employees on rubber and
tin-dredging properties. In this connection
those engaged in the tin industry are pro-
bably the better catered for. Work is more
strenuous, and the industry more prosperous.
Bungalows with roofs of nipa palm-leaves
—called atap—are usual. With large, well-
ventilated rooms and floors set high above
the ground level to discourage visits from
hamadryads and other snakes of a too-
friendly character, they are cool and sani-
tary. Established and prosperous dredging
centres provide bungalows of a most modern
and attractive type—set, as a rule, in sur-
roundings which resemble well-kept botanic
gardens. The Taiping and Rawang resi-
dences of the Pratten tin group are striking
examples of the artistic merit which can be
introduced into the setting of these Eastern
homes.
Golden Horseshoe’s chairman, Prothero
Jones, is back in Perth after an unsuc-
cessful attempt in Adelaide to raise capital.
Approximately 140,000 shares are held in
France, 150,000 in England and a few
thousand in Australia, and as money was
unobtainable in either France or England
the Horseshoe board got Jones to try in
Australia. He isn’t likely to succeed.


EVEN TERMS.
“A memorial has been signed by many leading bankers of Europe and a few in America, and by other leaders of great industries, pleading for the world-wide removal
of barriers to trade as the thing most likely to restore world prosperity and maintain world peace. ’

SQUARING THE ACCOUNT.
NURSE (at hospital): “You want, to sec the young man who was
injured in the motor accident? Are you the lady he was
with?”
YOUNG LADY: “Yes j I thought it only fair to give him the kiss
he was trying to get.”
“Modestine”: Here is a new way of scar-
ing a burglar. Mrs. —-—, a M.L. lady, alone
in her handsome house on a recent warm
morning, treated herself to a cold shower,
and then walked up the carpeted hall to her
bedroom in the altogether. Passing the
dining-room door she fancied she' heard the
cat- within, and opened it abruptly, thinking
to catch Tom on the table. Standing at the
sideboard, a Gladstone bag in one hand and
a silver teapot in the other, was a burly bur-
glar ! Two yells rang out simultaneously,
the lady diving for cover and Sikes rushing
through a door opening on to a verandah, and
thence through the garden into the road.
Here a quick-witted citizen, either disliking
the gentleman’s looks or rendered suspicious
by his haste, grappled with him and held him
until the police arrived. Sikes had left be-
hind not only the valuables he had been collect-
ing when interrupted, but also plunder
gathered from the house next door. He is
now in a place where there is no chance of
a nude female intruding.
“Mars”: The Bribery Commission in
South Aus. may have left some police con-
stables with smirched reputations, but the
force has its heroes, too. For some time the
Police Department has been trying to detect
breaches of the Dental Act by unregistered
and unqualified teeth-extraetors. The main
difficulty has always been to catch the defen-
dant in flagrante; but this was achieved the
other day, and an amazed Court learned
that a young John Hop, entrusted with the
task of trapping the defendant, had taken
the simplest way of all—he had gone to the
unregistered operator and had a tooth yanked
out. This method of obtaining evidence
against law-breaking publicans may involve
no hardships, but so far as the Dental Act
is concerned it opens up alarming possibili-
ties for the “subject,” especially if the man
with the forceps should happen to suspect
his victim of being a policeman in disguise.
“Gordelpus”: They did some rough-and-
ready surgery in the old windjammer days.
During a voyage to Australia a sailor fell
from the rigging and broke his leg. The
skipper patched it up with a couple of spars;
but after a while gangrene set in, and the
only chance of saving the man’s life was
to amputate his leg at the knee. Of course,
there were no anaesthetics, and no surgical
implements except, the carpenter’s tools. The
skipper, having filled the patient up with
grog, instructed his heftiest flatfoot to knock
him out with a sandbag, and repeat the pro-
cess if he should recover consciousness before
the operation w y as finished. His instructions
were obeyed, and the stump, as soon as the
leg was amputated, was disinfected with
boiling pitch. Amazingly enough, the victim
recovered, and it is not so many years ago
since he left off stumping up and down the
streets of Fi'emantle (W.A.).

“1.D.8.” : The theft of the world-renowned
Conde pink diamond from Chantilly in
France has given rise to some curious mis-
conceptions of the meaning of the word
“rose” in connec-
tion with it. Most
of the Australian
cablemen take it
for granted that
the word refers to
the diamond’s
color. As a matter
of fact, the term
denotes the manner
of cutting—a dia-
mond may be a
“rose” diamond, as
opposed to a
“table,” for in-
stance, whether it
is white, yellow,
blue, green or
black. Like many
or most historic
diamonds, the
tionde has a ter-
rible history, but
it is fairly certain
the world will
never know it
again in its origi-
nal shape or size.
Pear-shaped, half
an inch wide and
an inch and a
quarter long, it
was mounted as a
tiepin. Even a
bookmaker would
shy at it as an
adornment, and its
production for sale,
anywhere on earth,
would ensure
prompt and pro-
longed jug for the
vendor. The only
way for the thieves
to get rid of their
white elephant will
be to cut it up
into many small “stones.” That process is
probably in hand at this moment.

“Flagwagger”: French ideas of modesty
are very different from ours in some respects,
as most travellers discover for themselves.
Very few farm-houses possess a bath, and
peasants will often indulge in a liead-to-foot
wash by standing on the paved yard while
their fellows throw buckets of water over
them. It is not uncommon for a brother to
assist a sister with her ablutions and vice
versa. In 1916 twelve of us found ourselves
billeted at a farm at Wittes. It was man-
aged by an elderly woman, whose husband
had been killed in the war, and her 17-year-
old daughter. They soon chummed up with
these first Australians they had met, and, find-
ing that they had to work exceptionally hard,
we often lent a helping hand. A middle-
aged Digger who could speak French was
their favorite, especially the girl’s. On one
occasion she innocently asked him if he
would assist her to wash. When she ex-
plained that she wanted him to throw buckets

of water over her nude body he gave a hor-
rified refusal, lectured her in a fatherly man-
ner, and warned her never to again approach
a soldier with a similar request. Possibly
it was fortunate for the jeune fille that she
had directed her artless request to an ex-
Salvo officer.

“Three E.’s”: Here are some methods of
opium-smuggling that have come under my
personal notice. The traveller wearing the
soldier's badge who left one of his legs
somewhere in France finds the artificial limb
an ideal receptacle for the contraband; the
fact that he wears the thing so well that no
one suspects his loss renders him free from
any suspicion on the part of the Customs
officers, to whom he is well known. I have
seen a man cheerfully pay the demanded
duty on 200 cigars, every one of which was
merely an envelope for a tin cylinder con-
taining something much more precious than
tobacco. A passenger went, ashore, unsuspec-
ted, with his camera, and a dozen rolls of
films, to secure some typical Australian snap-
shots : every one of those films, each bearing
the maker’s name on the colored wrapper,
was a well-camouflaged tin of opium. I know
of a gentleman wearing clerical attire who
used what looked like a Bible and prayer-book
for opium containers. A lady passenger
came under my notice not so long ago. Several
of her friends were waiting on the.wharf to
meet her when the vessel came in. One had
an extra-nice bouquet of flowers for the
traveller, and obtained permission to go on
board with them. But what Customs officer
would suspect a bunch of flowers that he had
seen go on board? And so the game runs on.

“Tliomo” : “Stellsby” (B. 12/8/’26) claims
to have heard plenty of whistling up Little
Bourke-street, but I question if he can make
oath that it was really Chinamen who were
doing the piping. My life is spent between
Siam and the F.M.S., where the population
is 75 per cent. Chinese, and since the ques-
tion was first raised I have taken particular
notice. Never once have I heard any of
the tens of thousands of Chinamen among
whom I have moved during that time try his
lips at a whistle. Making inquiry on the
subject of my interpreter, he told me he
never remembered hearing any of his coun-
trymen attempt a tune. It was “not their
habit.”

“Larrapinta” : There is a S.A. pastoralist
who still tells how his father obtained his
first billet for him in a local bank, confident
that he would some day make his mark in
the world of finance. But he didn’t; in fact,
he remained in the job only a month. A
cheque from one of the bank’s most esteemed
clients was presented during the lunch-hour.
The cashier was away and the manager
engaged, so the young clerk .took the cheque,
looked up the ledger, and found insufficient
money to the credit of the account to meet
it. He accordingly marked it, as he had
seen the cashier do, but instead of “N.S.F.”
he wrote “N.8.G.” on one corner and returned
the document to the presenter. A couple of
hours later the drawer of the cheque burst
into the bank and waved the document under
the astonished manager’s nose. “No blanky
good, am I!” he bellowed. “It’s more likely
this bank that’s N.8.G.” I’ll take my
account elsewhere. And he did. The dis-
turbance reached the ears of the heads, the
manager was hauled over the coals, and the
squatter’s son resumed his pastoral pursuits.
“H.K.” : Apropos the decision of the Syd-
ney City Council that in future all houses

in 1825 :—
SYDNEY HOTEL.
William Cummings begs leave to inform those
friends who have so kindly patronised him that, with
the view of rendering- his establishment perfect, he
has added to his accommodation a desideratum much
wanted, namely, a bath, capable of being used hot
or cold at pleasure. To persons requiring such a
stimulus to health little need be said, particularly
when they will find every attention afforded for their
eomfort, as in regards the necessary accompaniments
attendant upon private bathing.
The bath has been exhibited to a most respectable
medical gentleman, who has highly approved of it,
as well as of the arrangements made for the comfort
of those who may have occasion to use the bath.

“Sixenate”: A woman who was “up” at
Rockhampton (Q.) for bigamy has had
rotten luck in matrimonial matters. As a

deserted her, after which she lived with an-
other who went to the war and was killed,
leaving her with children but ro pension.
Then she “married” again, only to find her

Three years ago she took another mate; at
this stage, after being missing for 20 years,
the original husband turned up. The tangle

The flappers turn and giggle as they pass you by,
They leave you on the footpath thinking “Why, why,

Other fellows make advances when they’re sitting-

For you’ll never make a lover if you’re shy, shy,
shy!
You’ll never be a rival of the smooth-haired Sheiks
Unless your tie is faultless and your breath just reeks
Of brandy, gin and whisky—and you can’t help feel-

If you’re pounding out a Charleston in your new

You’re nothing else but simple if your home’s all
bliss;
You’re a poor romantic wowser if you think like
this;
You may call a lady “honey,” give her all your ready

But your very best credential is a long, close kiss.
You must read the naughty novels that the bookstalls

If you can’t get home blithered —well, your girl-

Extol a flapper’s glories in some rather risque stories.
And you’re sure to be a “darling,” or a “real he-

If you’re out-o’-date and simple, and your clothes
aren’t gay,
And you feel a decent pleasure in an old-time play;
If you do not beg or barter for a lady’s jazzv garter —
Well, you’ll be a lonely mortal with your old shy
way
Still, I’d let the flappers giggle as they pass you by,
I wouldn’t bother thinking of the “Why, why, why?”
Let the fellows make advances when they’re sitting-
out at dances—-
For I guess you’re mighty lucky if you’re shy, shy,
shy!

“Wang”: I put down the paper wherein I
had been reading about an affluent citizen’s
will, and my mind travelled back to a Sab-
bath morning nearly 30 years ago. I
attended the local kirk regularly with my
boss and his family. We all sat in the same
pew, and this Sunday morning, as the plate
was approaching, the boss, sitting beside me,
whispered in my ear, “Laddie, ha’e ye some
siller on ye? I’ve come awa’ wi’out a
bawbee.” I dredged a sixpence and a florin
from my pocket, and cannily offered him the
latter. But he was cannier. “Nae, nae,” he
BURIED TREASURE.
RRIECTED GILES : “Think of all the things I’ve given her!”
PRACTICAL LARRY : “Get ’em back, you ass!”
REJEOTED GILES : “Can’t; she’s eaten ’em.”
expostulated, “th’ sma’ ane ’ll do, laddie.” It
being an inexorable rule that the plate should
never be ignored, I had to dump my two-bob
piece into it, while the boss contributed the
saxpence. On the way home he took me to
task for extravagance. “Laddie, ye’ll nae be
reech,” he said, shaking his head. “Th’
guid Lo-rrd wad nae expect sic a saeree-
fice from sic as ye. Nae, ye’ll nae be
reech, gin ye gang on like that.” He was a
true prophet, though I’m not going to blame
the church for it. It was his will I was
reading about the other day. He left over
£50.000, and I notice the old kirk gets £5OO
of it.

“W.T.W.”: Speaking of cheque signa-
tures, the son of a Mallee cocky writes so
like his father that the difference isn’t worth
mentioning. The father bet his bank-man-
ager one day that if the son signed a cheque
the bank wouldn’t be able to pick it. A
week later two cheques came in for £lO
and £2O, and were referred to the manager;
he told the ledger-keeper to dishonor the
£2O, on the ground of “Signature unlike.”
Somehow the cheques or the instructions got
mixed, and it was the £lO cheque that was
sent back. In a few days the cocky looked
up the manager and handed the amount of
the bet to him. The manager had been
throng jri his first pick, and the teller’s extra-
ordinary accident had saved him from dis-
honoring d genuine #
“Mitt” : Copy of letter received by d head-
teacher from the mother of a 10-yeaf-old
school-bank depositor ;— *
Let Joe go down and get me what money he has
in the bank to-day, and then I will know he has
none and can put none in, as it only learns them to
steal, not to save.
It looked like a dark mystery; but inquiry
elicited that Joe had been convicted a few
days previously at the Children’s Court of
stealing vegetables from a Chinaman. Hav-
ing stolen them, it further transpired, the
young financier sold them and banked the
proceeds. Joe probably holds an Australian
record: has any other boy ever had to be
forbidden a savings-bank deposit because it
led him into temptation?
“Fantas” : The pommy gets a lot of bricks,
mostly for ignorance of a new country's
customs; he is entitled to an occasional bou-
quet, too. The other day in a township in
the south-east of S.A,. two horses attached
tb a buggy tfidk ffight and. bolted. The
first bo see tht'm waS a IY-yeat-old Dew-
chum, who Has b'Hen liet'e fdr Only about
five weeks. He snatched a walking-stick from
a stand in fro'nt of a genefab.stdfie, anfl,- hs
the runaways passed, grabbed the. back Of
the buggy and swung himself into it. Then
leaning over the dashboard he fished up the
reins from among the horses’ hoofs with the
crook of the walking-stick, and brought the
horses to a standstill. The owner arrived in
hot haste, and, after going to the horses’
heads to make sure everything was 0.K.,
turned to find the rescuer. But the latter
had disappeared without waiting even to be
thanked.

“Toby C.”: Clancy belonged to the old
school of navvy gangers. When he thought
he had spotted a loafer amongst his men
the rest of the gang would soon hear of his
intentions. “The first good man comes along,
you’ll go,” Clancy would mutter in a tone
just loud enough for the nearest men to hear.
“And you, too, Casey,” if Casey happened to
straighten his back whilst the first
victim was easing his. “Finnigan’s a
man could be did without,” Clancy would
soliloquise boomingly as Finnigan walked
about under pretence of looking for a shovel.
Perhaps O’Donnell would ask Morrissey if
lie thought of going into town for the races.
“You’ll be goin’ soon enough, and a couple
more wid yer; including them two Orange-
men and Cassidy,” Clancy would comment
truculently. There was one advantage about
working in Clancy’s gang; a man would
always receive ample notice of his impending
dismissal. There "was another: Clancy had
never been known to sack anyone.
* * * *
. “Trustee”; A good example of conflict be-
tween business and farming knowledge is
shown in this transaction between an execu-
tor and a ’wayback cocky. Bill Cowman’s
spinster aunt having left him a fat legacy,
he was advised by her executor, after the
estate had been wound up, that the money
which had been invested in Government stock
was at his disposal. His reply ran thus:
“Dear Sir, —I got yours of the seventh, and
am glad the matter has been settled. I have
my doubts about Government cattle, but
please send word as to the day you are truck-
ing them up.”
‘S.R.M.” : The old Royal Hotel, Sydney,
better known these days as the Soldiers’
Club, is going out in a much tamer fashion
than its predecessor of the early days, also
known as the Royal Hotel. There were wild
scenes on the night of March 17, 1840, when
this old building went up in smoke. The
DIPLOMACY.
TRIXIE : “Oh, I do hope, Tommy (darling, that when we are married you’ll never come
home and find fault with the meals.”
TOMMY (scans the bill and finds he has been stung): “Never, darling! We’ll eat at
a restaurant, and then we can both find fault —you with the grub and I with
the bill.”
officers attending a Government House ball
left their partners and gave enthusiastic
help as amateur fire-fighters. One officer
was especially mentioned for his services;
he directed the efforts of a number of helpers
who demolished adjacent buildings to pre-
vent the fire spreading. Flushed with suc-
cess, the wreckers went a step further, and
laid a train of powder to blow up a fetv
more tenements. At this stage, however, the
property-owners took a hand, and robbed the
crowd of the impending thrill.

“Renrut” (Honolulu) : If “Akenehi” (B.
26/8/’26) will omit all her fancy dressings
and simply cut her avocado in halves, remove
the seed and use a little vinegar or tomato-
catsup with pepper and salt on the pulp, she
will, I think, agree that the avocado is “some
fruit.” The taste for it is acquired, but
once established the eater will go through
Hell and Highwater to satisfy the craving.
“L.C.M.”: So many of our requirements
are now being made in Germany that we are
in danger of forgetting there was ever a
war. But it has left some indelible traces
in the names of the younger generation. In
our town we have among the eight-year-olds
a Salonica, a Dardanella, a Kitchener
Flanders and a Joffre Ypres. As anyone
might guess, the last-named is just Bill to
his cobbers. Another kid’s full titles indi-
cate his age pretty clearly; he is Lloyd
George Versailles. Little Locarno Brucia
arrived, it is needless to add, only last year.

“The Rumpus”: I have a new prescrip-
tion to offer for watches that won't go. 1
possess a comifion old timepiece which had
struck work for over a year. I tinkered
with it, trying every remedy known to the
amateur, but the darn thing refused to tick
even once. So I laid it aside. A week ago
an old teamster friend of mine came in from
the Never-Never, and in my toolbox we
came upon the watch. Briefly I related its
history. “As a teamster,” said my friend,
“I have a for a horse that won’t
do his bit alone. I put him alongside a will-
ing puller. Like this.” He whipped out
his own watch and slipped mine with it on
the clasp. I have no explanation to offer,
but my watch started to go straight away,
and has kept going ever since.

“Gasmask”: When the Casino Isolation
Hospital, near Boulogne, was burned down,
a makeshift was contrived by converting
bathing-boxes into rows of one-man wards:
in each a window was fitted, and the hutch
was furnished with a locker, a stretcher and
a hurricane-lamp. Sand pathways Were laid
between, and the sisters did their rounds-
mostly in gumboots. Incidentally, one day
a Fritz ’plane headed for Dover came in for
a gruelling of anti-aircraft shrapnel, . and
as it was directly over the town a hail of
spent iron lobbed down, one piece striking:
a nurse and putting her out of action. After
this anti-aircraft guns aiming anywhere near
the perpendicular in the city fired a light
shell filled with cotton-wool, the idea being:
to get the clouds of wadding tangled around
the propeller-shaft and bring the ’plane down.

“Blum” : The most popular picture in the
Australian National Gallery in Sydney,
judged by the amount of time devoted to it
by visitors, is E. J. Poynter’s quarter-acre
depicting the visit of the Queen of Sheba
to Solomon. But it isn’t Australians who
worship the exfitic scene. It’s the Asiatics
who are brought here in hordes on British
ships. They march through the turnstile, and
tramp straight to the object of the admira-
tion, looking as a rule neither to right nor to
left. Then they stand for a long while,
drinking it in. I have seen *a group of a
dozen or more rooted there for 20 minutes,
discussing every detail, with great flashing of
black eyes and waving of brown hands.
Possibly racial pride and a desire to bask
in dead glories, is at the bottom of it—or
is it that they revel in the spectacle of a
comparatively fair-skinned lady doing hom-
age to • a dusky potentate ?

Old as the hills, old as the ages misty
gods wetfe quite a lot more like mankind,
And Ate bowled a wrong Tin, deft and twisty,
Where deities the banquet-tables lined,
A golden Granny Smith, with “Te Kalliste,”
You may recall, engraven on the rind.
Old, old as Beauty’s self, this ceaseless quest
For what O. Henry calls the “Beautifullest.”
How Juno, Venus and Minerva squabbled
About this discord-gift you may imbibe
From founts Pierian, and how Paris wobbled
Before he fell to that stupendous bribe.
And notwithstanding that the judge was nobbled
’Twould be unjust his ruling to describe
As faulty. Evidence of statuary
Exists to show the shepherd picked the pea.
All Ate’s doing! How could Olympus stand her
If that was her conception of a joke?
What hell-on-earth it loosed! What direful dander
And angry passions did that stunt evoke
Till red with blood of heroes ran Scamander
And Ilium’s topmost towers went up in smoke!
And all because three ladies couldn’t agree
Themselves which was the comeliest of the three.
Aiiij couid they now? ’Twouid be, I thiilkj a rareness
T 8 find a trio, perhaps even two; , .
Who could be fair about each other’s fairness;
Hence harried man has still the work to do,
And let him thank his stars he’s spared the bareness
That the embarrassed Paris had to view.
Men may grow more like gods; sans skirts and
bodices,
Women, conversely, might be less like goddesses
(The sort enshrined in Iliads and Odysseys).

“A white swan attacked a sculling boat on Bendigo
Lake and inflicted damage which will necessitate the
boat being sent to Melbourne for repairs.”
’Tis items such as this
Provoke the artist’s stricture;
A detail all amiss,
A trait not “in the picture”;
The classic swan was wont to steer
Its stately way o’er lake and mere
With the repose of Vere de Vere,
But now the voice of slander,
Impatient of its grace sublime,
Convicts it of the vulgar crime
Of brawling like a gander.
Had this occurred of old
That pale, poetic glamor
Had left the muses cold;
Stunned by pugnacious clamor
The Laureate would have penned no lay,
Saint Saens thrown his score a Way,
Fair Leda would have scorned —but, stay,
Perhaps we should forget her;
With all a tender maid’s delight
In scenes of battle and affright,
It’s probable for this she might
Have loved her lord the better.

.Charlie Ryan, “Gutzer-King”-in-Chief to
the A.1.F., was on his way back from Eng-
land when Death met him at Adelaide the
other day. By the very nature of his job
Ryan was about the worst-known man in
the A.I.F. He was the final reviewer of
medical judgments, and was inclined to
regard every man who came before him as
a lead-swinger. Yet it was admitted that,
though hard, he was impartial. It was said
of him that he sent his own son, considered
unfit by another medical officer, back to the
place where he almost immediately met his
death. Ryan let it be known that a trip
back to Australia awaited any man who
could put a new tale up to him. but it was
a very safe bet. One 50-year-old Digger got
Ryan's respectful attention, though. He
claimed he had symptoms that made him
believe lie had t.b. ; his father's suffering from
the same disease strengthened his fear.
Ryan looked compassionate, but just at the
end, after lie had told the oldster to go, he
shot at him the question: “What age was
your father when he died?” “He's not. dead,"
said the Digger, “he was 94 last week.” But
the Digger got his trip to Australia. Apart
from his work in the A.I.F. Ryan had done
great service at the Melbourne Hospital,
most of it without fee.
Bishop Long, of Bathurst, is the George
Washington of the “Church of England in
Australia.” The agitation for self-govern-
ment is an old one, but it is only recently
that it has become popular, and it is appro-
priate that Long, born in Victoria in 1875
and the first Australian-born bishop, should
have fashioned the bill that the Constitu-
tional Convention has endorsed. Inciden-
tally he was once a brigadier-general as well
as a bishop ; he held that rank as Director-
General of Education in the A.I.F.
Sin lias its uses. Riley, who archbislies
at Perth and lately celebrated the 32tid
anniversary of his appearance in lawn
sleeves, got an ideal possy for a soul-salvager
when he was dumped down, gaiters and all,
in the middle of the Westralian gold rush
of the early "nineties. Riley still recalls
with a chuckle that when he went east to
Sydney in his first year he paid a visit to
Darlinghurst Gaol, where the governor apolo-
gised for the smallness of the congregation,
explaining that recently about 200 of his
guests had flitted to Riley’s diocese. The
Bishop tilled the stony field so well that after
20 years his flock had to stop calling him
“My Lord” and murmur “Your Grace.”
Now that an old man in England is dead,
a Melbourne alderman does not know
whether to go on calling himself Mr. Frank
Stapley or to put “Sir” in front of his name.
Stapley has a right to quote Tom Hood
when speaking of his grandpa, saying he
“ruined me ere I was born ; sold every acre,
grass and corn.” The Stapley baronetcy
goes back to the Stuarts, but the family lost
interest in the title in 1701, and it is a ques-
tion whether its disuse did not void the
handle ; also, whether the right heir revived
it—Burke doesn’t include it in his list, and
Debrett says the claim of the late alleged
holder was unsubstantiated. The Melbourne
man, who is the last survivor of the four
sons of the reputed Sir Harry Stapley, who
died the other day, is 68 years old, and like
his bi-others, who died childless, has no off-
spring, so it doesn’t seem to matter much
what is done with the estateless title —if
there is a title.
Tasmania’s new Speaker (Walter Woods)
and Chairman of Committees (Ben Wat-
kins) are brothers-in-law. Also they are the
only two members left of the Speck’s original
Labor party.
The heavy smoker amongst the delegates
to the Church of England Convention in
Sydney is Charles Owen Riley, Archbishop
of Perth, who, feeling the need of his pipe,
boldly made a suggestion to the convention
that there should be an adjournment for
“smoko.” The suggestion, which might have
had a cold reception if it had come from a
less exalted quarter, was accepted with alac-
rity. Dr. Riley admits to having been a
devotee to nicotine for 55 years, which
means since he was 17 years old. But his
smoking has not interfered with his bishing.
The. Primate (Archbish. Wright) didn’t
smoke before lie came to Australia; he fell
to the pipe in about his fifth year here.
The Labor Caucus was a bad picker when
it foisted Alam, a storekeeper of Asiatic
descent, on to Lang as a Legislative Coun-
cillor. Alam. shortly after his elevation,
proposed to take a business trip to America.
Lang objected, lie said that it was Alain’s
duty to stay on the spot, to help in the
destruction of the Upper House. Alam
coolly retorted that he wasn’t very anxious
to see the House go, in any case, and Lang
then refused him credentials ; but Alam got
them and the necessary passports from the
Commonwealth Government. Last week he
sailed by the Ventura for San Francisco,
leaving Lang lamenting.
Records, like horses, run i n all shapes.
Councillor John McSolvin, of Brunswick
(Vic.), a carrier by trade, is the terror of
thieves who rob vehicles. In the Melbourne
City Court recently he obtained his 63rd
conviction for this class of robbery.

Old John Sly, whose health was drunk hy
Hobart’s city fathers at the Town Hall on
his 97th birthday, came to the .Speck over
80 years ago, and has been rooted there ever
since, except for a few years when he was
connected with the Geelong Times. He remem-
bers Hobart Town in the early ’forties,
when brass and iron foundries were busy
and almost everything required in the colony,
even to crockery, was made in the place.
Grandfather John, who is still hale and
hearty, has 50 descendants to carry on the
name.
Engineer Harry Walkling, lately retired
after 51 years’ service with the Melbourne
City Council, laid Melbourne’s first wood-
blocks in Flinders-street outside what is now
Clapp’s fruit-stall.
Hartley Williams, the ex-Justice of the
Vic. Supreme Court, who retired from the
Bench 23 years ago on a £l5OO-a-year pen-
sion because he was passed over for the C.J.-
ship when Higinbotham died, celebrated his
84th birthday lately in England. His Honor
has already drawn £34,500 from the State,
which is pretty fair compensation.
A striking memorial to Boss Smith is to
be erected in Adelaide, his native town. T.
B. Hitch, the English sculptor, has it in
hand. Keith Smith, Shiers and Bennett, who
shared in the world-flight, will be shown in
relief on the pedestal. The whole thing is
to cost £3500, and it will stand in the Cres-
well Garden, just outside the oval.
Bananaland is developing a habit of keep-
ing its ain fishguts for its ain craws. The
job of planning and building a bridge over
the Brisbane River, betwixt North Quay and
Grey-street, goes to Harding Frew, son of
R. D. Frew, engineer, of Brisbane. The
young man, who is a product of Brisbane
Grammar and Sydney Uni., is just now
making a steel path over the Mary River
at Granville.
The new president of the N.S.W. Congre-
gational Union is Touched, the Kogarah
parson who had the limelight upon him
whilst he sailed into Rome over an escaped-
nun episode. The lady, a Miss Partridge,
subsequently became a member of the
Touched household. Although he is liable to
fly off the handle when the seven-hilled city
is mentioned, Touched is a good-natured
chap, and not devoid of humor. Many dead-
beats know the room he maintains in his
house for the benefit of the casual homeless.
It is seldom unoccupied.
Most of the duties of the late Judge
Mitchell in S.A. go to Kingsley Paine, at
43. He practised in Kadina and other
country towns before becoming S.M. in the
city. Like so many other Adelaide lawyers,
he has strong literary tastes. His most
immediate work will be to finish the book-
makers v. police Royal Commission —he will
have a free hand, either to pick it up where
Mitchell dropped it or to ask the 50,000
questions all over again. Two more S.M.s
are to be appointed for Local Court work,
which is much congested, and Paine will take
Insolvency, with the title of Judge. Some-
thing will have to be done also m the
Supreme Court. Of the four Judges there,
Poole and Napier have both been out ot
health, and the former is to have leave of
absence for most of next year.
Passed out at Toowoomba (Q.), B. F.
Yaldwyn, member of one of the State’s
pioneer families. By breeding a useful strain
of milking shorthorns lie helped to make cow-
cockying popular on the Darling Dowms.
“Picnic” racing appealed to him, and he
was one of the founders of the Downs
Amateur Picnic R. C., a tremendously
swanky institution.
An aged Queensland identity went west
when 11. M. Challinor, for years secretary
to successive Police Commissioners in Bris-
bane, called it a lifetime at 68. He was
a son of Queensland’s first Government
medical officer, and, as a C.P.S., was well
known in N.Q., especially Cooktown, during
his earlier service with the Government. He
was ’ a voluminous writer ot verse, and

a memorial of its 1852 crisis, when the

diggings and taken all the money with
them. Adelaide was without cash, and busi-
ness became paralysed. When the luckier
diggers returned they brought over two
millions of bullion —there was still no legal
currency in the place. George Tinline, man-
ager of the Bank of South Australia, per-
suaded the Leg. Council, the only governing
body of that day, to pass an Act authorising
a local coinage. The British Government
when it heard of it, which was not for
months, emitted a howl of indignation, but
by that time the position was saved. The
little community banqueted Tinline, and
handed him a £2500 cheque and a 200-guinea
gold salver with a long inscription. He re-
tired to England 10 years later, died in 1895,
and left the plate to a daughter for life,
then to the “Public Institute” of S.A. She
has just died in London, at 86, and the
Public Library will get it. Chief Justice
Murray is a Tinline descendant.

There’s a Melbourne boy—a Grammar
School pupil—who is the envy of about 99.9
per cent, of the budding males of his age
who know him. He’s got a father who is
affluent enough to run racehorses; he’s been
chosen by Francis Birtles as his companion
on a motor trek from Darwin to Melbourne,
and when he gets over that experience
there's a job waiting for him in Britain,
where the head of the Bean motor-factory
has undertaken to teach him the trade. If
there’s a heaven for boys of 18 the speci-
fication must read very much like that. His
name is Alec Barlow.

he’d give away his last shovelful of
manure!”
Had a 90th birthday in Port Adelaide,
John Deslandes, who has done good work
there for a lifetime as contractor and City
Surveyor. His most cherished memory is of
being- sent by the S.A. Government to the
N.T.. about 1870, to build a floating bridge
at Escape Creek. On the day arranged for
its opening a steamer arrived and ordered
everybody on board, as the Government had
decided to abandon the settlement.
A STAGE MINER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Marquis of Salisbury’s visit to Australia has
resulted in a letter to the Argus from a lady who
says she remembers the Marquis’s father wcnking as
a ‘swell digger’ at Bendigo in the early ’fifties. ‘He
wore corduroy breeches,, long boots, a cabbage;tree
hat and a crimson silk waist-scarf in lieu of braces
or belt.’ ”
His blood was blue, of course, he being a Cecil;
Withal it was no bluer than his shirt
AA'hen with a shovel or a pick he’d wrestle
Or stand around a windlass, hauling dirt,
lie was to wear the gladdest rags that riches
And rank can on a lord of men bestow ;
But it was mostly boots and cord’roy breeches
At Bendigo.
Some day imposing robes would drape his carcase,
AVitli bars of costly ermine on them set.
Fate had ordained that he should be a Marquis
And don a pearl-encrusted coronet
On State occasions. High silk hats uncounted
In later years his wardrobe was to show.
A floppy cabbage-tree his head surmounted
At Bendigo.
Treaties and laws he framed, edict and charter:
He ruled the Empire and he led the Lords ;
He wore upon his leg the storied Gaiter,
Most coveted of statesmanship’s rewards.
How changed from him who nuggets sought to dig
out
Of sweaty shafts ! But for those boots, you know,
There might have been some bowyangs in his rig-out
At Bendigo.
I wonder if, amid Imperial splendors,
A transient regret he ever felt
For days when he was delving sans suspenders
(As Yankees call the things) or even a belt.
Ensconced illustrious in earth’s high places,
AVith stately dukes and belted earls a-row,
Did he recall those cramped or open spaces
AAherein he bent to yacker, minus braces,
At Bendigo?
N.s.w.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED.
TRESIZE: “Have a accident, Silas?”
TREVARROW : “No, thanks, if ’ee don’t mind, Peter — I’ve just
had one.”
“Topee”: To stop roosters from crowing
in the night (B. 30/9/’26) it is not neces-
sary to build their perches near the roof.
Stretch a piece of fencing-wire above and
parallel to the perch, and on this string
lengths of plasterer’s lathing, allowing the
ends to dangle about 9in. above the resting-
pole. Slide some of these pieces along the
wire at 4in. intervals over the patient’s usual
roosting-spot; then even if Chanticleer’s
comb is missed by one lath when lie rises
to crow, he is pretty certain to get a side
swipe from another. Three nights will gen-
erally effect a cure, although in the case of
a particularly obstinate old Brahma five may
be required.
“Verri”: Orchardists in Maoriland are
perturbed at hearing that the flying-fox has
made its appearance in the Waikato, one of
the great fruit and dairy produce areas of
the Dominion. With the exception of a type
of wild cat that escaped from a travelling
circus the flying-fox is the first wild creature
—other than bird or fish—that has managed
to get into Maoriland unaided. The theory
is advanced that it may have come over in
the rigging of a ship or been smuggled in
by someone with a liking for curious pets.
This particular specimen revealed its
presence by hitting a power-line and being
electrocuted. The authorities are now look-
ing round anxiously to see if there are any
more of the family about.
“Nikko”: The enthusiastic shout of Zane
Grey that he is “sure coming back to Maori-
land” for the swordfish and mako fishing is
apparently inducing a large proportion of
the population of the U.S.A. to do like-
wise. But big fish, however plentiful, don’t
last for ever, and the threatened depletion
is causing the authorities to consider methods
of conservation. These will include the
restriction of the fishing-grounds, define the
method of capture, prescribe the limits of
the season, and set an allowance of perhaps
ten fish to each angler. If Zane Grey and-
his followers don’t think it worth while to
come along under these conditions, they will
have to be content with the . sport provided
otherwhere. Our fish will not be sacrificed
• to make a Yankee holiday.
* * * *
“Kayeff” : Duck-hunting from aeroplanes is
by no means new. A big Yankee rice-
growing concern employs a service of pilots
and ’planes to chase ducks off its swamps.
The ’planes dive low over the feeding birds,
which fly away. The pilots then run down
as many as possible. Special metal-tipped
propellers mangle the birds in dozens/and
the machines and crew are plastered with
blood and feathers. On landing a dozen or
two birds can always be picked out of the
struts and guy-wires. The 1 pilots used to
take up shotguns,, but it was too much like
shooting the ducks sitting, as the terrified
squawkers fly straight ahead of the ’plane. A
pilot assured me that the duck is greatly
over-rated as a speedster. A ’plane doing
90 m.p.h. can run round any duck that, flies.
He estimates their speed at 40 miles an hour,
canvas-backs and teal included.
* * * *
“Genturion”: One of our later-imported
pests is the buffalo-fly. This smalli black,
swift-flying insect has been increasing its
numbers for some years in the N.T., . whither
it is supposed to have come from Timor.
It lias now spread
to the no>rth of
W es t r a 1 i a, and
there is goiod rea-
son to fear that it
may work south, as
the devastating
cattle-tick did. The
creature attacks
cattle, not com-
municating disease,
as the tick does;,
but causing irrita-
tion and exhaus-
tion by its numbers
and persistency in
blood-sucking, clus-
tering round the
bases of the horns
and the bare parts
of the body in
thousands. The
Federal Council for
Scientific Research
is despatching D.
Murnane, a veter-
inary official, to
Darwin to make
investigation. He
will work back
through the North-
ern Territory and
Queensland, on the
track the fly is
most likely to fol-
-1o w i n heading
south, and will re-
port on any evi-
dence of the fly’s
movement. The
tick was years in
the N.T. before it
decided to go east
and south, but,
once started, made a welter of it. Australia
can’t afford to have the experience repeated
in the case of the buffalo-fly.
* * * *
“Toby C.”: I once heard an ancient angler
say: “They catch ’em big up Goondiwindi
way in winter time.” I spent a few hours’
fishing there this cold season, and, though
I failed to hook anything as weighty as some
of the monsters I have seen landed in the
Abo. columns, my bag was unique in its
variety. A 71b. cod, a well-grown platypus
and a young turtle came up at one pull.!
It was a fixed line with three hooks attached
and the bait was common garden worm.
"Bisley” : The habits of the blind mole of
Central Australia are but vaguely known to
science.. It is. of the marsupial order and
pale golden in coloi-j a desert recluse with-
out ears, and has its eyes buried beneath
PEDIGREED BET POOR.
THE ENTHUSIAST: “ There’s a horse for you now. And he’s got blood, too."
THE CRITIC : “I hope so. He certainly hasn’t much flesh.”
the skin. To suit its burrowing habits, the
little miner’s muzzle is covered with a
leathery shield. This also assists in its dig-
ging activities. On the surface its comical
gait, with its forefeet turned out, resembles
the Charlie Chaplin walk. This peculiar
action causes the claws of the third and
fourth toe to grow larger than the rest and
the corresponding toes of the hind feet to
turn outwards and backwards. When
burrowing, these toes throw the dirt to the
rear, effectively sealing the burrow behind
the worker as he penetrates below the sur-
face. The pouch of the female opens back
and thus escapes the dirt while the burrow-
ing is in operation. I have tracked these
little miners by following the surface move-
ments of the sand, for they never travel more
than three inches below ground and live in
galleries rarely deeper than four inches.
They are invariably found in colonies of
great numbers.
* * # *
“Max”: “Spenner’s” bird (B. 7/10/’26)
appears to be the beautiful Australian fan-
tailed cuckoo, the next less in size to the
pallid cuckoo, though the square-tailed
cuckoo is almost exactly similar but a
rarer variety. Fan-tailed cuckoos are fairly
common, migratory and solitary, and are
one of our . best insectivorous birds, eating
hairy caterpillars and other rubbish rejected
by most birds. In my orchard garden near
Sydney several fan-tails arrive very late
every autumn in search of vine caterpillars.
Having cleaned up the vines, they hang
about for several months, whistling mourn-
fully on trees or posts, and dropping down
to the ground to pick up grubs. They dis-
appear as soon as the weather grows warm.
They are known to my household as postman
cuckoos, from their most frequent call. They
are not so much disliked by small birds as
are the pallid cuckoos, though canaries hate
them, and will always give warning of their
presence. Australia is rich in cuckoos, all
very valuable in spite of their customs.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: Because he showed an un-
accustomed fancy for bread, I suspect that
the Ashton Park ’possum (B. 30/9/’26)
was an escaped pet. But a recognised sanc-
tuary does create in the wildest creatures a
remarkable tameness and confidence. In the
Botanical Gardens at Sydney wild black
ducks —the shyest of all waterfowl—-assemble
daily. At evening they take. long coastal
flights to northern or southern feeding-
grounds. Outside the gardens they display
their customary timidity and knowingly
allow no person to approach within gunshot,
but inside they feed from the hands of child-
ren and in some instances even submit to
handling.
“Nosey”: As to oatmeal stopping leaks
in petrol- and steam-engines (B. 30/9/ -b),
has any Abo. put chewing-gum to a similar
use? Kay and Mathews, the unlucky bird-
men who kicked off first on the race from
England to Australia, owe their lives to its
ingenious application. After unfortunate
delays in Europe, the pair reached Constan-
tinople, where an overhaul revealed a large
leak in the petrol system.. Some substance
had to be found as speedily as possible to
stop the leak, and Mathews hit upon chew-
ing-gum mixed with asbestos, fibre. They
then started' on a 400-mile fly across rugged,
mountainous country in Asia Minor, and
the chewing-gum held. The extemporised
cement was, in fact, still effective when the
machine crashed in Batavia.
* * * *
“Clerk”: Toll “Tarago” (B. 30/9/’26)
that a well-conditioned tyke will exist for
20 days without sustenance. A tuckerless
fortnight is more than enough for the aver-
age man, and a bird can liold out for nine
days only. A frog can rough it with a year
between meals, and a tortoise can tolerate
500 lean days before turning up its toes. Eight
hundred days is about the limit for a snake’s
HIS MOVING TALE.
“Poor man, you have indeed been through
sore trials!”
“Yus, lady, an’ worse ’n that —I bin
convicted.”
hunger-strike, - and a thousand days for a
fish. As a faster, though, the bed-bug stands
on his own. Twelve hundred days, or nearly
four years, without a bite are necessary to
out him—so they say, but most folk don’t
keep him that long.
FURTHER WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The drought has broke,” the old chap said;
White was his hair, and rather thin.
“There’s big mobs on the roads, I read
In only last week’s Bulletin.
“The gidya’s all ablow, they say,
The ranges sport new coats of green.
And strong and brown the streamlets p!ay,
With growing splashes in between, y
“The daisies but on Johnson’s run
By this will be knee-high, I know ,
And Bathurst-burr will have begun '■»
To seed along the Warrego.
“The wool, teams soon will start to bring
From far-out sheds the curling fleece;
On Lawson’s Flat the mobs will ring,
Till cursing drovers make them cease.
“I mind the time in ’fourteen when”—
He paused -to light his pipe, and sighed—
“l nearly went back there again;
But then....you see —the old horse died!”
“Next week,” I said, “I take the track
Through Lawson’s Flat to Tarrawon.
There’s room for one swag in the back,
The box-seat’s yours to travel on.”
His old eyes lit, and hope anew
Showed on his sun-tanned, wrinkled face.
“I’ll come,” he said, and stooping drew
His swag from out its hiding-place
I called on the appointed day.
My disappointed eyes fell on
A stranger, who stepped out to say:
“I’ve got some bad news —Old Ned’s gone.
“He bade me tell you when you came
The trip you planned through Lawson’s Flat
Must pass him by. Thanks all the same—
He’s gone a long way west of that.”.

The TOP-NOTCH "Scotch
Say WREN Man!!
“Jesmond”: My experience in dairying has
shown that cows alternate the sex of their
calves with fair regularity. Twice during
the past four years this general rule has to
my knowledge been broken. Four years ago
90 per cent, of our cows on Phillip Island
(Vic.) had heifer calves, being 40 per cent,
more than we had expected. This year 80
per cent, of the cows that have calved have
had bull calves instead of about 60 per cent,
having heifers. The preponderance of males
this year is not confined to cattle. In a com-
bined litter from two sows 20 of the 22 pigs
are males. Similarly in a litter of puppies
every one is a male. Has the weather any-
thing to do with it? Four years ago it was
a wet season and we got a preponderance of
heifers; this season has been fairly dry and
we have a surplus of bulls. In between the
seasons were normal, and the offspring of the
cows were in the usual proportion of males
and females. Has any other Abo. noticed
this peculiarity, or is it merely a coincidence?
* * * *
“L. 37”: During my career of 15 years’
bullock-puncliing on the worst roads in
N.S.W. I never came across a good driver
who used the jingler (B. 16/9/’26) or a
good team of bullocks that had ever had it
used on them. I have pulled the biggest
WON EASILY.
PATRICK: “ What’s the matter, Mike — Wen figktin’?”
MICHAEL : “Vo, Pat. Oi let O'Brien he cudn't carry me
to th’ top on a hod of bricks —'nd Oi won. He
dhropped me at th’ first flure.”
loads out of Wilcannia and have never yoked
more than 20 bullocks to do so. I never
either cussed my team or used a jingler on it.
* * * *
“AdeL”: During the winter months, and
up till the beginning of the wet season,
countless thousands of pelicans congregate
upon the great lakes found throughout the
vast track of little-known country stretch-
ing between the coastal ranges south-west
of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Alex-
andria plains (N.T.). They swim to and
fro in huge V formations. The leader of
each division rides at the apex of its forma-
tion, and the birds keep at equal distance
from each other. There appears to be a
complete understanding between the leaders,
and the rank and file simply follow their
directions. These great black-and-white
birds are a pest to the leaseholders of these
far-northern lands, as they pollute the water
of the lakes to such an extent that neither
humans nor beasts can drink it, thus render-
ing huge tracks of lightly-timbered, well-
grassed high plains unfit to graze stock on
through the absence of clean water.
“M.G.”: Roma (Q.) is having a recur-
rence of the cater-
pillar trouble which
a few years ago
caused serious losses.
The Strawberry and
Brindle of that local-
ity have developed
an unnatural liking
for a diet of the pro-
cessional caterpillar,
and lick up the
crawlers from the
bases of the forest
trees. Acute inflam-
mation of the intes-
tines supervenes, and
induces a state of
high fever. The
final stages are diag-
nose d as cerebro-
spinal meningitis,
the results of which
are almost invari-
ably fatal. It has
been noted that the
pest feeds almost
exclusively on the
leaves of the iron-
bark, and the com-
plete destruction of
this valuable timber
has been suggested;
but eradicating the
ironbark would pro-
bably mean that the
pest wou 1 d only
accommodate itself
o n another host.
Beneficial results
have been obtained
by using, as an anti-
dote, a mixture of salt and permanganate
of potash.

“James B.”: For curly-leaf in the peach-
tree here is a proven cure at little cost. Bury
a cupful or two of ordinary washing-soda
close to its trunk. That’s all.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: The discovery of a rapid and
lasting cure for malaria is imported from
Germany, and if it does all that
is claimed for it one more of
humanity’s scourges will have
been cornered. Malaria
flourishes in many climates,
and still lingers even in such
lands as England, but it is the
greatest handicap white civili-
sation has to face in opening
up the rich new areas of the
equatorial belts. The prepar-
ation is called plasmochin,
and, like many other drugs,
is a derivative from the
aniline-dye processes which
the Hun cultivates so assidu-
ously. The discoverer has
successfully treated some hun-
dreds of malarial cases, and
is satisfied that he has got the
real thing. In combination
with a slight dose of quinine,
plasmochin not only destroys
the malarial spores in the
blood, but. it is affirmed, actu-
ally abolishes the effects of
the disease.
“Jimsey”: Near Sackville
Reach, Upper Hawkesbury
River (N.S.W.), recently, a
bag of sugar was left over-
night on a verandah. Next
morning it was noticed that
an army of meat-ants was
engaged in carrying it away.
One of the ants was followed
home, and the distance from
the nest to the sugar carefully
measured. Without allowing
for the unevenness of the road
and the detours the ants
would have to make en route
it totalled a few inches over
1100 yards.
“.Tim Carew”: It is not correct, as
“Spadger” affirms (B. 28/9/’2fi). that the
aboriginal meaning of the word Monaro. or
Maneroo, is a woman’s breasts. My people
were on the Monaro long before the Binghi
tribes vanished from the district, and they
always understood the word to mean the
navel. Binghi had a great habit of calling
places after real or fancied resemblances to
different parts of his body, and one has only
to travel through the Monaro district to
realise why Binghi so named it.
“Topee”: Re “hashmagandy” (B.
7/10/’26). Fifty years ago it was the name
given by sailors to a compound of salt pork
scraps, pea-soup leavings and cracked pan-
tiles, as Liverpool ship’s biscuit was then
called; the whole anointed with slush and
baked on a tin plate. If the pantiles were
powdered by being battered in a canvas bag
NOBODY. TO BLAME.
MOTORIST: “Let me see. I'm almost sure I’ve run against your
face somewhere or other.”
WAITER ( sourly ): “No, sir. It's not your fault — I’ve always
been like this.”
on one of the ship’s bitts with an iron be-
laying-pin, the mess was known, alterna-
tively, as “dog’s body.” As indulgence in
either plat was regarded by the afterguard
as being conducive to scurvy, by reason of
general greasiness, its inclusion in the menu
was discouraged.
“Aragun” : The name “hashmagandy” (B,
7/10/’26) was coined at Ramornie meat-
works (the first established in Australia)
many years ago. It is a slang word applied
to the hash resultant from boiling-down
operations. There is probably not a meat-
works in Australia, M.L. or the Argentine
where one will fail to find at least one man
who has worked at Ramornie at one time
or other; hence the widespread use of the
word. At a leading Sydney margarine factory
the term “greaves” is used, and I have heard
country butchers say “dabs,” “grouts” or
“crackling,” but where a meatworks man is
employed the term is always “hashmagandy.”
“Salt”: Can’t “hashmagandy” be traced
to “salmagundi,” to be' found in Chambers’s
and other dictionaries, and defined as “A
compound of chopped meats . with other in-
gredients, seasoned. A medley”?
“Kayeff”: Tell “Bourri” (B. 7/10/’26)
that “hashmagandy” was the term used in my
seafaring days to denote any dubious dish,
especially those of the genus hash. The
origin of the word, according to old shell-
backs, was one McGandy, a jovial ship’s
cook. His invitation to the crew on special
occasions was. “Come on, lads. Have some
hash a la McGandy.” This became cor-
rupted through use into hashmagandy.
“Mick Anic”: “Mullarula’s” Murdering
Gully (B. 7/10/’26) was so named because
old and broken-down Brisbane crocks used
to be taken out there, and from a convenient
rocky platform sent to a short and sudden
end. The crows attended to the burials.
When kiddies we used to earn the magnifi-
cent sum of threepence per doz. for leeches
at this place. We secured our take by
sliding through the damp moss and ferns and
then making out at the double with the
suckers hanging on our naked legs.
* * * *
“Older”: In the southern part of Aus-
tralia “Yarra” meant “muddy” (B.
7/10/’26). The aborigines’ name for the
river was “Yarra-Yarra,” the repetition of a
word with them denoting the superlative.
Hence “Yarra-Yarra” (very muddy),
“Wagga-Wagga” (very foggy). In the ’six-
ties I lived in Victoria. There were then
two strong tribes thereabout. One was
known as the Yarra-Yarra River tribe, its
territory being the Yarra-Yarra Valley, and
it reached from Baw-Baw to the sea, where
a small off-shoot, .Tika-.Tika, was located
about Melbourne. Across the range roamed
the Goulburn River tribe. Both were
friendly to the whites and with each other,
exchanging visits about twice yearly. They
were harmless, generous people, living simple
lives. Their country was rich in foodstuit,
and they had no reason to cultivate any-
thing, for there was more than plenty
of opossums, kangaroos, wombat, wallaby
and their kind. Also fresh-water fish, eels
and yabbies abounded, and in summer her-
rings from the sea, swam up the Yarra in
schools to its head waters round Baw-Baw.
* * * *
“Six and Eight” : During last year’s trout
season I caught in the Little River, a
tributary of the Abercrombie (N.S.W.), a
IMb. fish by the tail. The captive made a
rush at the fly the moment it settled on the
water, touched it with his lips, and the
instant I struck turned and made off. In
turning, however, he flicked liis tail against
the hook, which went through it, and so Mr.
Rainbow found his way to the pan. The
.same day my mate caught a trout in some-
what similar fashion, but in his case the hook
went through the dorsal fin. Surely the odds
are millions to one against two such events
happening on the same day.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: Someone recently
wanted to know whether bats eat mosquitoes.
They do! The nocturnal buzzers are the
bane of our existence, and during the summer
months we have to light fires around the
house in order to enjoy a little rest. Bats
come in dozens to batten on the blood-suckers,
and when the naked-winged ones are feeding
the sharp click of their needle-pointed teeth
can be heard every time they make a grab.
At night, with the curtains thrown back, I
have often had a pair fanning me for an hour
at a time as they swooped down every few
seconds to catch a buzzer hovering round my
proboscis. A pair will quickly clean out a
roomful.
* * * *
“Dinkum”: If “E.A.8.” (B. 16/9/’26) is
still seeking a cure for his barber’s rash, the
following can be recommended: Fluid: loz.
resorsin, loz. glycerine, loz. water,
lac. sulphur, loz. cologne and 4oz. alcohol.
Ointment: 15grs. tannic acid, 1 drachm
precipitated sulphur, 5 drachms vaseline.
Directions: Apply the liquid several times
a day with a soft sponge and bathe the parts
every morning with hot water. The oint-
ment is not to be used until the scabs have
formed. It is then to be applied immedi-
ately after each application of the liquid.
The purpose of the ointment is to keep the
parts soft.
* # # *
“Old Mac”: The food and animal idio-
syncrasies referred to by “X2X” (B.
7/10/’26) are more likely to be purely
physiological than, as he suggests, mental or
psychological phenomena. It is well knowm
that the body can become “sensitised” to
certain proteins, such as the pollen of some
kind of flower or grass, so that the inhala-
tion of a trace of the substance produces
a most violent reaction, which may take
the form of asthma or hay fever or intense
nausea. The reaction is extremely specific,
and a certain means of testing a patient’s
PERISH THE THOUGHT.
“ Yairs , they say this Solomon bloke 'ad
7 00 wives.”
“Gripes! Fancy all them feet in the middle
of yer back in the middler winter!”
sensitivity to anything is to rub a little of
the suspected substance into an open cut.
If the patient is sensitive to this substance
you get almost immediately a tremendous
weal raised up in the region of the cut. The
violent symptoms shown by some people
in the presence of horses or cats is probably
a similar reaction produced by inhalation
of the substance present in the mange of
these animals.

three years and gnawed his way through each one.
William has just been placed in his nineteenth cage,

So they boobed you, did they, Bill?
And you bust their flaming cages,
Though they’re hanging to you still!
Why, I’d lose a week’s good wages
Just to see you give the slip, son,
To those coots who passed the pill—-
Aw, I know you got the pip, son,
When they called you William, Bill.
Caught and jugged you, did they, Bill?
Gave you “life” with all the fun gone,
Where the fogs, like dirty swill,
Left you wond’ring where’d the sun gone
And the good old bush-day breaking
Through the gum-trees on the hill;
Still, you might ’ve stood the aching—
But the}' called you William, Bill.
Oh, I know the feeling, Bill,
When you're lonely-like in Blighty
And the climate’s blanky chill,
And the folks ’re high and mighty;
When you sit and try to figure
If y’d ever stand the thrill
Just of hearing “Good-day, Digger!”—
; And they called you William, Bill !

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Charm emanates from a black-and-gold
Chinese lacquer screen and fills the Educa-
tion Gallery this week. It is suggestive
of an Austin Dobson poem; of that Eng-
land, just on the fringe of trade with China,
when adventuring husbands and brothers
adorned chintz-cushioned and fragrant par-
lors with the lacquer cabinets and tea-
caddies and Indian muslins in which the
Georgians and early-Victorians delighted.
Behind the Madras curtains of those days
the thoughts of youth that knew not radio
or aeroplane must have been wide, wide
thoughts. But the screen is only one of
many beauties that the Arts and Crafters
are displaying at their annual show. Silken
wares, batiked and painted till they are
tumultuous with color, vibrate against the
walls. Bryam Mansell flashes one he names
the Arab shawl—a thing that might have
been tossed on the divan of Sheik Rudolph
Valentino. A scarf tjiat looks like golden
pansies and a poppy kimono are in Miss
Madson’s display. Among Ada Newman’s
treasures glistens a peacock-feather vase.
This is of Limoges, painted and glazed with
such cunning that it is hard to say where
the many-eyed plumes end and the back-
ground begins. Ernest Findley shows his
cool and • delightful flannel-flower porcelain.
A rose quartz in a Ithoda Wager clasp and
dependent from a black-watered ribbon blinks
seductively from a case of art jewellery;
and Daisy Dowse, just returned from Europe
and America, arrives with some fragilely
beautiful coffee-cups. A work-table of
graceful line, of grey greens with a design
as blue as the summer sky, is notable among
Mrs. Parsons’s exhibit.
Just as well the -10 English schoolboys
who descended on Sydney yesterday are
hardy products. In one day after stepping
from the Melbourne express they endured a
civic reception, a Government House rally,
a picnic at Clifton Gardens and a Y.A.L.
reception at the Wentworth. After that they
were disintegrated and allotted to the differ-
ent families that will be their hosts during
the Sydney visit. Everywhere speeches
assailed them, and everywhere they heard
of the vastness of this continent; but as they
have already been in W.A. and S. Aus., the
youngsters may be relied upon to have dis-
cerned something of that for themselves.
St. Luke’s, the C. of E. hospital in Dar-
linghurst, will soon be as full-grown as the
R.C. establishment of St. Vincent’s in the
same neighborhood. Quite palatial it looks
since it lias grown its new wings, and these
are to be stretched still farther till the estab-
lishment will hover like an angel of healing
over half of Roslyn-street. The Archbishop
of Sydney, flanked by two gaitered brethren,
blessed another foundation-stone at the hos-
pital the other day; it had been laid by
solicitor A. M. Hemsley in the presence of
many pillars of the Anglican faith. Secre-
tary Mrs. Roystone Davey subsequently
harvested £9OO from the foundation-stone,
and this, added to the £20,000 in hand, leaves
something like £25,000 to pay off the new
block. The special aim of St. Luke’s is to
provide beds at a fee of two guineas for
those who are unable to pay more, and who
desire the comfort of a private hospital.
Trouble has been long brewing within the
Women’s Club, and the ferment can no
longer be bottled up ; so the struggle between
the members who want to play bridge for a
small stake and those who would bar the
money has begun. The cork flew out at an
extraordinary meeting last week, when also
the 10-year-old question, “Why not serve
men and cocktails in the general dining-
room?” at last found voice. The club, which
is the meeting-place for most of the profes-
sional women in Sydney, was founded a
long time ago, when any woman who drank,
smoked and played cards for stakes in public
was a shameless huzzy. The franchise and
the World War have arrived since then ; but
many of the ladies who were daring enough
in their day to form a Women’s Club, un-
womanly enough to be actively interested in
medicine, law and the intellectual, view the
flapper of to-day with something like the
despair their own rebellion once produced in
the mind of middle-age.
But the Beaumont House affray was Lilli-
putian compared with the Homeric slaughter
that occurred within the Mosinan Golf Club.
This club, whose links crown George’s
Heights, one of the most heavenly view-
points on the harbor front, sprang into being
from the concerted action of a Clifton circle.
Both the members’ and the associates’ com-
mittees were picked from much the same
social cliques. The clubhouse has become
of more importance than the greens, and,
although the house holds a dancing-floor that
can accommodate 200 or 300, it has never
been able to instal hot showers for the play-
ers. Your heather-mixture golfer endured
this for many days, and then he up with
his club, and, with the help of his lady
friends, slew the reigning committees, anil
started his golfing year with a complete new
outfit of officials.
The fight put up by Emelie Polini, who is
now in America, was the basis of an argu-
ment which a band of feminists laid before
Attorney-General McTiernan the other day
in support of their claim for larger rights
for the mother regarding the custody of
children; it was incidentally mentioned that
the petitions circulated after the Court had
given its adverse judgment in the Ellis v.
Ellis suit (the actress was Mrs. Ellis in
private life) was signed by 20,090 women.
It would have been practically impossible
to get a demonstration like that for a woman
not in the limelight; the feminists in this
case were lucky to have been able to hitch
their waggon to a star.
Incidentally the big farm at Meadow Flat,
on the Bathurst-road, whereon Emelie and
her husband settled when she left the stage,
seems to be unlucky. It was lately going to
be the home of a young man, son of one of
our Best Families, and his bride ; but matters
did not run smoothly, and the fine home, on
which the Polinis spent or started to spend
a heap of money, is now a lonely bachelor’s
quarters.
The women of Marriekville are behind
the District Hospital. During the cold
months they held many dances to help pay
off the debt on. the new wing; and the heat
of last week could not prevent their having
a final fling in the interests of their growing
institution. The Ambassadors was the rally-
ing-point, and was easily one of the most
populous spots in Sydney that night. Mrs.
It. B. Trindall, who is president of the com-
mittee, shaded lilac and silver in black chif-
fons, and hostessed a large company at a
table banked with roses. Doctors were every-
where, and Matron Beattie, exchanging her
uniform for iridescence warmed by a green
shawl, entertained the president of the insti-
tution, Mr. Lenthorn, and Mrs. Lentliorn.
The Boy Scouts’ Ball, which is one of
the social fixtures for the Royal visit, is to
be the last straw that sucks the orange dry.
Fifteen thousand pounds is the sum aimed
at; and a round of entertainments, of which
the 1927 ball will be the glad finale, is being
set rolling by one of the biggest and most
title-gemmed committees Sydney lias known.
Vice-Royalty leads, and money and the mul-
titude follow. The Mascot competition is
something that all Scouts and their mothers
and their sisters and their aunts must wade
into. Apply to Garry Gordon, St. Ivilda
Flats, Cathedral-street, for particulars.

Claire Ivedwell, of Bellevue Hill, breathed
her marriage vows at St. Patrick's, on
Church Hill, the other night from handsome
trappings of ivory georgettes blazing with
diamente, pearls and silver. A train as
bright as that drawn by any comet followed
the gemmy gown, while mists of tulle veil-
ing and a sheaf of pink roses struck the
simple note. The male lead was Dr. Dodson,
once of Maoriland, now of Bellevue Hill.
He did his part in ordinary tailorings with-
out even the aid of lemon spats. The bride’s
twin sister Gladys, Vera Meyers (Melbourne)
and Linda Maguey ’maided in a flutter of
petalled taffetas crowned by large crin. hats.
Bride’s mother supplied nourishment at the
Cavalier,
Greta Gravolin, of Gootamundra, was an-
other pretty bride who slipped across the
threshold of matrimony with the blessing 1 of
St. Mary’s. The young man in the case was
Gerald Meredith Hayes, who came to Armi-
dale from London. Bride’s sister Eileen
’maided, and later Mrs. Gravolin did the
honors at the Astor.
Muriel, only child of artist Lister Lister
and Ids handsome wife, chose last Saturday
for her wedding at St. James’s to Geoffrey
Lamb, of London. The dark-eyed bride has
ideas of her own, and, discarding the
smothersome bridal veil, walked the plank
daintily in a frock of white shimmery
material with panels of white lace. Her
pretty hair was swathed with a silver
bandeau fastened over one ear with a blush-
pink rose. Her bouquet was also in the same
tint. After the ceremony Mrs. Lister Lister
received family well-wishers at the Australia.
“Maritana,” the opera that was written
partly in Tasmania arid partly, so some say,
while its com-
poser was sail-
ing in the wool
fleet on the
Murray, lasi
week poured
its melodies
once again into
Australian
ears. The lady
in the picture,
Rita Lancas-
ter, was re-

shaking the
moths out of
the old score.
Under her
baton a cast
mostly of
amateurs ac-
quitted them-
selves well in
the arias and
concerted num-
bers filled with the charm of other days.
Equally successful was her production of
the modern “Cavalleria Rusticana.” Miss
Lancaster has had lots of experience in pro-
ducing and conducting grand opera. On her
first visit to Australia she brought her own
company to tour under the Harry Rickard
management.
Harrington Lees, Archbishop of Mel-
bourne ; 1 >r. Cranswick, Bishop of Gipps-
land; and Padre Knox saw to it on Saturday
afternoon that no loophole was left in the
bond that tied Editha Hordern, of Chats-
wood, to Dr. Geoffrey Aitkens, of London.
A train all rose-pink tulle and pearls was
a delectable postscript to the orthodox white
and silver of the wedding dress, and two
maids in roseate georgettes added to the
pink sugar-icing effect. The loving-cup was
circulated under her own roof-tree by the
bride's mother, Mrs. E. Carr Hordern.
Monica Reid, youngest daughter of the
Tenterfield Reids, is another who has
decided to test Will Shakspeare’s statement
that spring-time’s the pretty ring-time. The
swain who goes with tlie circlet is John
Little, a Kentish man from Rochester.
To live in the memory of man for 700
years is not granted to many, hut tlie 700th
anniversary of the poet saint brings Francis
of Assisi a paean of praise. On Friday the
Lyceum Club was crowded with members
for a memorial reading to the bird-lover’s
greater glory. Francis’s own “Canticle to
the Sun” and one of the “Little Plays”
about “My Brother Sun” were read by Reiby
Bloom. The erudite Mrs. Bogue Luffman
declaimed her own bit of the saint’s bio-
graphy ; and Marjorie Quinn had the plea-
sure of hearing the poem which her lately-
dead father, P. E. Quinn, wrote for the
Franciscan Jubilee read by Beatrice Day
in her beautiful voice. Maoriland poet Tom
Bracken, too, lived again in liis “Not Under-
stood.”
When James McGowen formed the first
N.S.W. Labor Cabinet one of the ladies who
held up tlie social end for the new Adminis-
tration was tlie wife of Arthur Griffith. She
lived then, and has mostly lived since, at
Manly; and a few of her husband’s old
political friends followed her last week to
the Village’s little cemetery. She was no
politician, but she never forgot, if others
did, that it was Arthur Griffith who, as
Works Minister, started the movement which
led on directly to the contract for the
harbor bridge.
While Will Prior was directing the
orchestra at the Prince Edward the other
week his wife was knocked over by a motor-
cycle when making her way to their Hamp-
ton Court flat. Now the three breaks in
Mrs. Prior’s legs are mending, and, in appre-
ciation of the careful attentions of the Sisters
of Mercy, Mr. Prior and his friend Mr.
Pollard entertain the sisters and convales-
cents of St. Vincent’s with a movie show on
Sunday evenings.
Portia Geach stares at the Lido :
The Lido has a sand beach about 10 miles long,
so nearly all Venice goes there to bathe. But tlie
Smart Set are to be found on the exclusive Excelsior
Hotel beach, a fenced-in section in front of the
hotel. Here all hours of the day people surf, “ion
hire a tent, with a rest couch (covered with gay cie-
tonne as your color-Sense dictates), on which you
can recline and take your sun-bath to your lieait
content. These tents form two lines like streets
around the enclosure. Large striped umbrellas are
dotted about, and surf-boats, paddle-boats and swings,
with a pier, gaily painted, make up the sunny pic-
ture. This is the hotel-de-luxe for bathers. What
strikes one at first is the number of people walking
about in pyjamas—even at 8 p.m. you see them in
this attire. But they are not the pyjamas of old.
They are creations. Some of them are most beauti-
ful in all colors: jade, purple, blue, the smartest
being on Chinese lines, and caught tight at the
angle with three loops and buttons. Many are black
with Oriental trimmings and a gay coat to match.
Men and women, young and old, are indulging in
this fashion at present. After the morning swim
you rest; then you put on your smartest pyjamas
for the eleven o’clock. Downstairs in the sand is
a special restaurant, where you cannot enter if in
•walking dress. It is reserved for the bathers. Here
the lunch-time is very popular and gay, and there is
a pyjama parade as interesting and enjoyable as the
dress display at the supper-dances.
Beatrice Tange, tlie Titian-haired daugh-
ter of a Sydney suburban bank manager,
who has been studying the pianoforte under
the famous Teichmuller, of Leipzig, is to
give her first concert in the German city
this month, and she is to be launched in
London on January 17 at the iEolian Hall.
Lady Chelmsford heads a committee of pro-
minent people interested in her.
Indomitable George Collingridge, at 79, is
still holding his art shows. At the Feminist
Club, at 77 King-street, William Morris
Hughes, whose own portrait is one of the
72 water-colors on the wails, opened the
exhibition. Besides the water-colors there
are 17 oil paintings and 11 black-and-white
drawings. The water-colors are graceful,
and the artist is particularly happy in his
treatment of trees, as, indeed, is only to be
expected of one who in his youth was a stu-
dent of Corot.
May Sheehan, the finance secretary of St.
Margaret’s, is a J.P., too, now. In her time
she has been many things, but she cherishes
very close the memory of her service as
personal secretary to Ross Smith on his
arrival in Sydney.
On the 30tli the Bankers’ Operatic Society
will produce “Our Miss Gibbs” at the Con-
servatorium. Cecily Audibert, a Sydney
girl, is the Bankers’ chosen Miss Gibbs.
Miss Brisbane tells of brides and a hand-
some benefaction: —-
The Carmelite Nuns are to have Auchenflower
House. It was Thomas Mcllwraith’s cld home, and
he gave it its Scottish name. T. J. Ryan bought it
in 1918, and left it to his widow.
Nat Phillips’s “Whirligigs” are the show at
present in Brisbane. Two of the Kellaways are
with them, also Queenie Paul and the Charleston Six.
His Majesty’s is closed, and Vance Palmer’s “Happy
Family” is the brightest spot on the theatrical
horizon. The Repertory Society will produce this.
John Warren’s wedding with Efiie, daughter of the
late Captain and Mrs. R. B. Henry, took place in
the Park Kirk, the bride wearing black georgette
piped with blue and gold. Nell Eglington, in blue
crepe de Chine and jade, ’maided.
In the Valley Kirk James Ferguson was married
to Emily Morrison, the bride attending in crepe
silk with a broidered tulle veil. Ellie Ferguson
’maided in lavender; and Muriel Ferguson, in pink
pleated mariette, was trainbearer, carrying a basket
of lavender and pink flowers.
Warwick had nice weather for the Spring meeting
of the Turf Club, and several Brisbane women were
on the lawn, among them Mrs. Dinsdale, in navy
and wine er@pe de Chine; Mrs. Brett, in black and
white; Mrs. Hill, in rosewood crepe de Chine; Mrs.
Ahern, in white; Mrs. Sapford, of Allora, in black with
red roses; Mrs. E. A. Flower, in mauve and green ;
Mrs. Claude Newcombe, in figured crepe de Chine;
Mrs. Clive Evans, in white; and Mrs. J. H. S>. Barnes,
in black checked with scarlet and white.
In the evening a ball was held in the Town Hall.
Mrs. Devine and Mrs. Margetts judging the fancy
frocking. Aline (from Sabatini’s “Scaramouche”),
represented by C. Redgewell, won first prize for
ladies, and G. Jarret, as a tin soldier, won the men’s
prize.
Dr. Mayne and his sister have given £50,000,
with a promise of more if needed, for the purchase
of land at St. Lucia (which has a glorious river and
mountain view) either for a new Uni. or for a
public park. Dr. Mayne would like it to be for a
Uni. The doctor was one time hon. surgeon and
head at Brisbane Hospital, a man of few words but
of a great kindliness. It is not long* since he gave
010 acres of land at Moggill to the Uni. A poisoned
hand has affected his health, and he has had to
resign from active work on the hospital staff.
He breeds horses and Jersey cattle, and is a real
animal lover. He and his sister live at Moorlands,
Toowong.
In a forest of gum-tips and a maze of colored
electric lights, the O’Connor boathouse was decked
foi a dance. The visitors to Brisbane in connection
with the championship fours were entertained. The
Royal Queensland Golf Club had a party, the same
night.

Melbourne’s youth must have cried to
Heaven in anguish on Henley Day morning
as the rain came home with the milk. About
half the competitors had lost their boats,
and many gaily-decorated canoes had been
reduced to ashes by the fire that destroyed
Edwards’s boatslied: and when, by super-
human efforts, things had been got going
again, a rainy day would have been the
last straw. But it was a false alarm, and
llenley never saw finer weather. Flappers
shed the chrysalis of their winter garb, and
silk, voile and even lace frocks were flaunted,
and flowery hats and simple pandans shielded
happy faces. The grass-bordered banks of
the Yarra, with walks of elms, oaks and
silver beech, new washed by the morning’s
rain, looked their best, and the gardens
around were a wealth of yellow broom. The
scent of flowers mingled with that of just-
varnished and painted Japanese umbrellas,
and the pedlars who exist to satisfy the
holiday-makers’ thirst for kewpies on canes
and such did a great business.
Out on the stream youths in conscien-
tiously laundered flannels; paddled Madeline
along, Madeline having done her bit by bring-
ing along cushions to match the coloring of the
craft. So the Madelines reclined like queens
and listened to gramophones and ukuleles,
forgetting typewriters, ledgers and sales-
books.
Every State, arid Maoriland, too, was
represented in the racing, and loud-speakers
along the banks proclaimed the progress of
the races. Five bands assaulted the welkin,
and the last touch of modernity was added
when movie-camera men glided up and down
in launches, constantly churning handles.
Each prettily-decorated houseboat seemed to
have its own orchestra, and hundreds of
houseboat guests sipped tea as they watched
the races and absorbed the general air of
gaiety. Governor and Lady Somers, she in
the simplest of dull-green silk frocks and
a shady hat of fawn tone, viewed the scene
from the houseboat of the Henley Associa-
tion’s president, Mrs. Strachau helping her
husband to do the honors. The decorative
scheme there was based on roses and tall
lilies, pink, mauve and cerise. Mayor Bfun-
ton’s lady, who had her husband with her,
was in figured silk in fawn, cherry and
powder-blue with harmonising millinery.
She was hostess of a floating parlor decked
out in draperies of coral pink and gold and
a wealth of pot plants.
The fireworks and illuminations at Henley
attracted many of the very naicest people
on Saturday night, and “Aren’t AVe All?”
by the Boucicault company, at the King’s,
failed to draw the usual packed house. The
comedy was as charmingly staged as on its
first presentation here, and the dressing was
well done. Mary Jerrold, in the first act,
trailed a gold lame train behind a gown of
gold lace and satin, and made her second
entrance in silver, gleaming beneath black
lace —both becoming. But a neglige, pat-
terned in big pink roses, was a mistake, for
her curly shingle is of auburn hue. Mrs.
Brough wore matronly apparel of black
taffetas, and later on navy-blue ditto, with
an attachment of ivory lace fichu. Angela
Baddeley’s most intriguing get-up was a
caped frock in fawn and tan tones, with
harmonising hat. Some wraps of distinc-
tion were noted in the stalls, the most strik-
ing being of wine hue with a border round
the hem of velvet petals of the same shade.
The throng at Moonee Valley races on
Saturday was a shade smaller than last year’s
congregation, so the statisticians say, but it
was a mighty crowd for all that. There
was some good dressing, much of it light
and colorful, and it had a background of
the roses of every tint which can be
depended upon to put on their greatest glory
for Moonee’s special day. Chairman Alister
Clark’s famous garden supplied the pink
and red roses that enhanced the luncheon, at
which the G.-G. was the principal guest.
Mrs. Alister Clark enlivened her black satin
gown with crimson and gold embroidery.
Mrs. E. H. Kinear set a new fashion in
parasols. Her fawn georgette sunshade,
matching her frock of georgette and lace,
dangled tan-lined ostrich feathers. General
Chauvel’s lady had a picture-hat of black
with a gown of floral ninou in green and
black. Mrs. Norman Falkiner sported a red
hat with her white silk bordered in black
and red. Bea Kimpton was a real summer
maiden in white muslin, with sprays of
wattle trailed upon a green-edged skirt. A
water-lily weighted the brim of her white
crin. The wife of Ileaton Rhodes (M.L.)
wore silk in a cubist design of fawn and
blue with her black crin. Aileen Taylor, of
Overnewton, chose cr£pe de Chine with gold
embroidery, topped by golden-brown mil-
linery. Mrs. Rogers Thomson was smartly
gowned in black —a color shared by many.
The painters of the Lyceum Club having
hung their work upon the walls of the
reception-room, and the craftswomen mem-
bers having scattered their efforts around,
the president, Mrs. T. a’Beckett, said the
foreword to the Fourth Annual Exhibition
before a good muster. Such well-known
women painters as Dora Wilson. Marion
Jones, C. Southern Flinn and May Vale
Gilfillan are represented. E. M. Wilks
shows the beauty of our coasts at Rosebud
and Portsea, Edith Alsop has a clever study
of Chaliapin on the concert platform, and
Esther Paterson and E. L. Spowers are other
workers in oil whose offerings strike the eye.
Clarrie Green, an exhibitor in the water-
color section, shows a glimpse of an inn in
Normandy which she knew as a nursing
sister. After a long and meritorious war-
nursing career Miss Green finds herself in-
capacitated for her profession, and has gone
back to her first love —the accomplishment
she sacrificed when, a bright Gallery student,
she decided to become a ministering angel.
Mrs. A. B. Campbell presents examples of
London’s latest craze—miniature landscape
gardens. With kitchen-trays painted green,
some moss, wee creepers, dwarf plants and
plasticine she has constructed two Chinese
examples—pagodas, temples, people and all;
and also an elaborate model of an Italian
villa and garden. Examples of batik work,
parchment shades, raffia articles and fine
stitchery are included in this section. The
show winds up on the 30tli.
Dwarf pine-trees and foliage plants in
that corridor of the Town Hall which leads
to the rooms of the Mayoress proclaimed a
special tea-gathering in progress on a recent
afternoon. The Brunton dame, whose three
years of civic rule are over, entertained
friends who had helped her to help the
Homoeopathic and the Women’s hospitals.
The hostess wore a coat-frock of ecru shade
silk crepe Romaine, trimmed with guipure
lace and quillings in three tones of fawn and
brown ribbon and topped by a black hat
wreathed with shaded pink foliage. The
setting of the party included bowls and vases
of pink watsonia and snapdragon, amid pink
and black draperies.
For the benefit of people who forget St.
John of Jerusalem and wonder what a Red
Cross Society can find to do eight years
after the war, the secretary of the Vic.
organisation, Philadelphia Robertson, has
sent out a little resume. The society since
1918 —it doesn’t need to talk of 1914-1S —
has worked with Repat. to provide comforts
and other aids for sick and wounded soldiers
at military hospitals and sanatoriums. Limb-
less soldiers have been provided with motor-
cycles and side-cars, and these are kept in
repair. The Lady Helen Club is maintained
for the use of blinded men, and the Red
Cross Handicrafts Shop, in Queen’s-walk,
is another evidence that the scarlet badge
still marks a worth-while mission on behalf
of men who fought for Australia. The
civilian side is still carried on, too. There
are 50 auxiliaries and branches in Mel-
bourne and suburbs working for hospitals
and kindred institutions, and in country dis-
tricts the nearest bush-nursing centre gets
a hand. The Junior Rod Cross is now
blossoming in 1175 Victorian schools.
The lass with the gentle smile and unshorn,
locks is Beatrice Touzeau. of the Albert-
street C o n.,
who has lean-
ings towards
the dramatic
s t a g e. She
has lately
distinguished
herself in the
heroine’s part
in Tagore’s
“ G h i t ra, ”
which li a s
been staged
here by her
teacher,
Howard Edie.
Miss Touzeau
comes of
a musical
family, h e r
mother being
addicted to the
piano, and her
two brothers
to fiddle and
’cello respectively. She herself has a pleas-
ant mezzo-soprano voice, which is being
brushed and combed by Mary Campbell.
Lafayette is responsible for the portrait.
The Lawn Tennis Association had no
trouble in getting entries for the dance at
the Kooyong pavilion on Saturday night.
The decorative scheme was evolved by Vera
de Bavay—unfortunately she was unable to
be at the hop—and Gwen Bedggood, and it
did the pair much credit. The doorway
to the ballroom was framed in golden brown
and Iceland poppies; the fireplace blossomed
with cinerarias of every hue, and the supper-
table was crowned with pink roses, watsonia
and mauve flowers.
Edward Golfs students showed what they
could do to a concert grand at the Assembly
Hall on a recent evening, and they kept
their audience interested. The “Emperor”
concerto of Beethoven, with Mr. Goll at a
second piano, was admirably played by Leoni
Miller; Mona Nugent and Mabel Gibson
shared the honors of a similarly accom-
panied presentation of the Arensky concerto,
and Leoni Miller and Mona Nugent gave a
brilliant performance of Liszt’s "Pathetique”
concerto.
Only a few violinists can write them-
selves down as pupils of the great Sevcik,
of Prague.
Paula Sclierek,
daughter of
Benno, is oue.
She had her
first lessons
in Australia
from the late
George Wat-
son, and after
a course in
Prague with
Sevcik she
got her final
polish from
the Dutch
master Heni'i
Petri. She
made concert
appearances in
several Con-
tinental and
English cities,
and then set
up as a teacher
in Maoriland. Miss Scherek lias not been
heard in Melbourne for some time, but she
is with us again, and, joining forces with
soprano Grace Evans, will have given a
recital at the Assembly Hall by the time
this gets into print. Broothorn pictures the
artist with her fiddle and her big amber
necklet.
The Faireleight Old Girls’ Dramatic Club
produced H. V. Esmond’s comedy, “Elisa
Comes to Stay,” at the Playhouse on a
cent beautiful evening. Despite the fact
that the plot has been used 3718 times
before, the play went well and the Presby-
terian Settlement Home and Kindergarten
got a cheque that strengthened it in its re-
solve to be kind to children. Arthur J.
Patterson as the Hon. Sandy Verrall, Kath-
leen E. Howell, who played the part of a
mercenary lady, and Jean O. Robertson, who
impersonated a legacy, earned the laurels.
Miss Robertson captivated the hero in cover-
ings of blue and silver, floral georgette and
magpie tones.
The Thornton-Battle knot, which was tied
at Grammar School chapel, had a town and
country interest. The bride, Katherine, is
a daughter of the late J. Herbert Thornton
and Mrs. Thornton, Camperdown, and a
niece of Mrs. Harold Grimwade, whose
Brigadier-General is an uncle of the bride-
groom, Cedric Battle. It was a white wed-
ding, even the blossoms which garnished the
chapel beiiig pale. The bridal gown of silk
Spanish lace was made with long sleeves, the
train being interlined with georgette. A
tulle veil was confined with orange blossom
and a shower bouquet was carried. Erin
Stead and the bride’s little sister Winifred
attended her in frocks of white georgette,
frilled in the Victorian fashion. Their wide
crin. hats were turned off the face with a
small poke. Mrs. Thornton, who is still in
mourning for her husband, afterwards re-
ceived relatives for a tea at Amesbury,
South Yarra. Mrs. Harold Grimwade, who
lent her house for the occasion, assisted her
in a gown of cream lace and a large black
hat.
All his family steamed over to rally round
Tom Latham Baillieu, of Toorak, at All
Souls’, Langham-place, London, when lie
exchanged vows with Ruth Marion Coleman,
of Amersham, Bucks. The bridal gown, a
cloud of white chiffon, was showered with
diamonds and pearls, the long veil of tulle
being caught'with jewelled clasps and sprays
of orange blossom. The bridegroom’s sisters,
Clare and Amy. attended in gowns of beige-
colored lace, which matched their straw hats
and. posies. The reception, attended by the
Australian colony in London, was held at
Claridge’s.
At St. James’s, Spanish-place. London,
one of our smartest girls, Adeline Mary
Burke, of Toorak. was married on Septem-
ber 8 to Adrian Pearman Clarke, youngest
son of the Anthony Clarkes of Brighton
(Eng.), where the bride most likely will
make her home.
Edith Bridges, widow of the General who
got the Australians on to Gallipoli beach,
was a born house-decorator, and was never so
happy as when giving her own home a new
interior dress or imparting to a friend sug-
gestions about carpets and curtains. She
was an expert embroiderer, and her .work
often found its way. to sales in aid of het
favorite charities. Though the shadows were
deepening' in the last two years, slle gathered
strength to do. something for the Briendly
Union of Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers, of
which she was the first president. Ihe
South Yarra Children’s Hospital Auxiliary
also had occasion to call her blessed.
Colonel and Mrs. A. F. Gerrard. of Heidel-
berg, have had it broken to them that tliey re
going to lose only daughter Edith, who has
announced her engagement to Harold Bruce,
second son of the Arthur Adairs, of Bal-
larat. She has named the **<tli of next
month as the day.
Nigel Somerset, Who arrives eariy n'ext
month from India, Won t be Seep mncli in
Melbourne’s social rounds. His wife and
her mother. Mrs. G. Irwin, have turned their
backs on the approaching gaieties and gone
to Barwon Heads, where they have leased
a cottage by the. golf links for six months.
There the Hon. Nigel- will join - them and
spend his furlough. i
Lieut Colonel 11. T. Kirkpatrick, who is
settled in South Africa, has brought over a
wife and daughter on a visit to his home-
land. He is a son of the Kirkpatricks of
Beemery (N.S.W.).
Mrs. Daly, better known as Edith Ilarrhy,
song-composer and pianist, is again in
Melbourne with her husband and two small
daughters after a sojourn of over, a todr
in England. Her “Sea Songs” are. breathed
forth passionately by countless, baritones,
and her “Children’s Songs” are sung every-
where. Paling’s have published one song—
“ The Young Rose.” Sydney is likely to
make the musician’s acquaintance, as the
family go north shortly.
The Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals will
divide the proceeds of a party on the Otranto
on November 15. Mrs. E. A. Spowers and
Mrs. Edgar Dye are looking after the tickets.
The Old Laur'istonians’ Dramatic Society
put on “Mr. Pim Passes By,” with “ ’Op o’
Me Thumb” as an entree, at the Playhouse
on two recent evenings. In the curtain-
raiser Dorothy Warren took the title-r6le.
The society had the aid of Norman Simpson,
who played the absent-minded Pim and
was producer. Leura Andrews, in soft gar-
ments of fawn georgette and lace, was the
wife, Olivia Marden, and Sybil Irving put
her girl-guide uniform aside to play the
part of Lady Marden. Hordes of bonme
flappers sold flowers, sweets and programmes.
The little venture, in every respect success-
ful, was run to help the kindergarten holi-
day home and a holiday fund for th
R.V.l.’s blind children.
Rose Day, the street appeal on behalf of
the Free Kindergartens, falls on November
26 this year. Melbourne possesses 42 of
these institutions. Some are denominational
—eight Church of England, six Presbyterian
and one Roman Catholic—but all are worth
helping.
The Melbourne Nursing Society has set
its heart on an After-care Home, and the
society’s friends will rally at the Wattle on
November 26 to jazz and play cards in aid
of the good cause. Mrs. J. H. Hewison is
the organiser, and Valerie Purves and some
other sonsy lasses are going to see that
there’s a full floor. Mrs. Ham has lent
her premises, and will give the supper; and
her staff won’t claim for overtime that night.

Forerunners of the Parliamentary delegation
include Sir Howard D’Egville, who stayed with the
Robert Hoinburgs at Medindie, and Lady Cecil t who
was for a week-end at Government House Oii her
way from the West to Melbourne.
Spring brings us roses and fetes. Of the latter
an outstanding orle was for Minda in the Town Hall,
opened by Lady Bridges, aUd another in the gardens
of the Wilderness School at Medindie, to which one-
time pupils rallied, as usual, in force —as buyers and
sellers. There has been a sale of soldiers’ work from
the Red Cross handicrafts shop too —staged this year
in the grounds and recreation hall at the Keswick
Hospital, with Lady Bridges to open it.
The R, M, Hawkers have been fishing in Norway,
and have fine stories to tell of salmon trout that
weighed from 401 b. down to a mere 131 b. caught on a
July evening between nine o’clock and midnight.
Eight months’ leave has been granted to Justice
Poole, who has been more or less on the sick list
for some time. His plans are to go a-voyaging in
March or April—dodging thereby some at least of
the winter.
Workers for the S.P.C.A. Ball were bidden by
Mrs. Bruce to the Town Hall so that they might
drink tea and hear the results of their labors. Tak-
ings are set down at over £550, with more still
to come in, and expenses at about £l3O, most of
it for catering.
For music lovers there have been the final Back-
haus concert in the Exhibition and a delectable per
formance of “The Apostles” by the Choral Society
under John Dempster, with John Dunn at the organ
and boy choristers from the Cathedral and St. John s
to swell the final chorus. At his good-bye, Backhaus
brought his audience to a pitch of enthusiasm seldom
roused by a pianist. Lady Bridges was at both
concerts.

THE INKY WAY.
Nobody would accuse J. McMillan* just
dead at Ballarat, of being a rolling sto'fie.
He spent the last 57 years on the Courier,
which he joined as a juungstet of 24.
“Sucre” : Years back I store-kept at Bran-
don (N.Q.), and got my Bulletin from a
newsagent. The paper was supposed to
reach him on the Tuesday after publication;
but I never received my copy till the Friday.
It was some months before I dis-
covered the reason. He first lent out my
Bulletin at a tray a day to three friends.
No, his name wasn’t McTavisli, It was
Maginty, or something to that effect.
Jack Higgins, M.L.C., who some time ago
got a cheque from the Daily 'Telegraph in
settlement of a libel action he had started
against that paper and is now suing the
Labor Daily for £2OOO damages, has buried
more journalistic infants than most men.
The Kookaburra, Tatler and Vumps were
three of his weeklies, and the Labor News
also, although subsequently resurrected, died
on his hands. He is now a sort of publicity
man for the A.AV.U.
“Smada”: Henry Lawson’s shade has
doubtless forgiven me the only insult I ever
offeried him. On his weekly rounds he
dropped into my room; but before he could
begin, “Len’s a thrum’?” I anticipated him
with “Len’s a thrum, Harry?” He glow-
ered solemnly at me, and without a word pro-
duced a threepenny-bit. “Thanks, Harry,”
I said, and pocketed the cash. Next week
he did not appear; but it cost me more tliau
the thrum to be reconciled.
“Stellsby”: The Associated Stock and
Station Agents of Melbourne are about to
withdraw their livestock market reports
from the Age and Argus and give them to
the Morning Post. That paper jumps at
the chance to print them as news; most
people perhaps thought these reports couldn't
be anything else. Actually, since the war,
the “big dailies” have made agents pay sd.
a line. Melbourne papers are taking longer
than their contemporaries to revert to their
pre-war habits; for instance, they still re-
fuse to sell themselves for the plain penny.
“H.P.”: The death of Jas. R. Kean, at
Portland (Vic.), breaks an old link with local
journalism. A Portland native, born in
1858, he had lived in the pioneer Victorian
town all his life. His father, James Kean,
a seafaring man, was one of the crew of the
Portland lifeboat that went to the assistance
of _ the survivors of the Admella when that
ship was wrecked off Cape Northumberland
in 1859. After being connected with several
more or less successful papers in Portland,
Kean, jun., in the early ’eighties took over
the even then mature Guardian (hatched
1842) and carried it on till he retired a
few years ago.
Archdeacon Boyce, best remembered as a
canon, recalled in a letter to a newspaper
the other day that he took an anti-booze
deputation in to old Henry Parkes 50 years
•ago. It was in the early days of the Local
Option movement that a reporter called on
Boyce, and was kept most of the afternoon
whilst the enthusiast deluged him with pro-
hibition propaganda. Poverty, crime, insan-
ity, disease and other unpleasant things—
all were traced to the door of the Demon
Rum. At the finish, day was dying, and tea
was being handed round in the Alliance
offices. “Will you have something?” asked
Boyce as the pressman folded up his notes.
“Yes, thank you,” said the reporter, bright-
ening. “I’ll have a whisky.”
“J.L;C.” : The Argus in its recent mam-
moth souvenir number duly omitted to men-
tion one shower of brickbats that came its
way. Early in 1879 the Government
Gazette printed a warning to the public
not to give credence to any Cabinet news
appearing in the Argus, stating that it had
“endeavored to injure the credit of the colony”
for sordid party purposes. The Acting-
Chief Secretary of the time (Bryan O’Logli-
len) was the mover in this proceeding. The
march issue of the Illustrated Australian
News very prettily commented on the sub-
ject : “The Government should. not notice
any utterance of such an organ.... the in-
formation tendered by this journal has
always been extremely unreliable, not to
say utterly false, on most occasions.” Them
was the days!
“Old Sub.”: It’s never safe for a sub. to
push copy on the spike without looking at
every line of it, no matter who wrote it.
Once, in M.L., I fell in most dreadfully that
.way. It was a story written by our staidest
and most elderly reporter—a chap who
always read his copy through, crossed his t’s
and dotted his i’s. He’d done a glowing
account of the life and work of some Pommy
wlio’d just been appointed City Gardener or
something; of course, he got his facts from
the appointee. But he was called away to
the ’phone just as he finished the job and
didn’t take the paper out of his typewriter.
A graceless junior wandered in a little later,
read the eulogy, and tapped on to the end
of it: “We know all this is true because Mr.
McScroggan told us so himself.” Then he
gave the copy to the boy. How that tag
got through readers and revisers passes the
wit of man, but it did, and spoilt my break-
fast next morning. I
A curious thing about Inky-wayfarer
W. F. Meagher, who lately went west in
Hobart, was that all the papers he was
with during his 29 years in the Speck put
up their shutters sooner or later, through no
fault of his, except perhaps in one
case. He first joined the Lyell Standard
when the West Coast was being boomed all
round, and no pen did more for it than his.
After its collapse owing to a lost libel case
he edited the Banner at Strahan. Ilis next
charge was the Zeehan and Dundas Herald.
After its demise he went to Hobart and
joined the World, leaving it to become
mining and commercial editor of the News
both now dead. His last job was as librarian
of the geological survey in the Mines Depart-
ment. When King O’Malley was trying to
get into the Tas. Assembly the Lyell Stan-
dard ran his opponent, J. J. Gaffney, who
came in an easy winner. After the poll the
candidates thanked their supporters as usual.
But as for poor Meagher, the King likened
him to “a bob-tailed bull in a clover-field
trying to brush flies off his back.” Nobody
knew what it meant; but that was often
the King’s way.

Point
“Wigs”: Kenneth Duffield, the Adelaide
composer, has another musical piece ready
for production under the title of “Healo.”
It will be done shortly in his native city,
with Arthur Stigant, for years chief fun-
merchant for Williamson shows, in the lead-
ing comedy part.
A GOOD FINISH, ANYWAY.
PROUD MOTHER: “What do you think of Muriel as a violinist?”
VISITOR : “I like the way she puts her fiddle hack in the case.”
“Lud” : Sir Alfred Butt, who has captured
London with “Rose Marie,” at the Old
Drury, has made an offer to British authors
of £100(1 down and royalties for what he calls
“an Empire play.” It looks like a chance
for Australian playwriters.
“Goldilocks”: Australian Dorothy Cum-
ming has got a lift through her selection by
Cecil de Mille to play Mary, mother of
Jesus, in “The King of Kings” picture. She
had no chance in anything above the chorus
before she tried her fortune in America;
but there she has been given a good chance
in subordinate parts in De Mille pictures.
It was her calm sweetness of face that
earned her the part of the Madonna.
“C. Sharp”: One of the Torzillo family,
Joe, has just dropped out of the orchestra;
he was harpist Bertie’s brother and son of
the man who taught a whole multitude of
present-day musicians their business. Joe
has conducted many orchestras, and in the
heavenly choir will be able to play almost
any instrument. He was only 49, and seemed
a hale man until a few months ago.
“De Oriel”: All circus folk and show-
people will regret the death of Bud Atkin-
son in Auckland (M.L.) recently. Bud
came here from America with a big Wild
"W est show, and after many ups and downs
drifted into the movie business, and was
well on his feet when the end came. He
leaves a widow.
“Spaghetti”: Once more M.L. has lived up
to her reputation of being one of the frostiest
places on earth for a touring concert party.
Baritone Andre Navarro, whose party in-
cluded Elsa Stralia, lately told a moving
tale in a Sydney court of audiences and
salaries which failed to materialise, and of
cash paid by himself to return the members
of the company to Australia. Next time
Andre considers such a journey, he should
recall Henry Lawson’s chief objection to
visiting Maoriland: “You can’t walk back.”
The Navarro- party was supposed to be
financed by one George Walker, of London ;
but apparently he isn’t a brother of Johnny.
“De Oriel”: It happened to us at Lowater,
on the Darling. Lady Isabel, having unsuc-
cessfully demanded her overdue salary,
retired in anger from the dressing-room. The
stage-manager, used to meeting difficulties,
proceeded to play “East Lynne” without her.
“Well, Barbara,” said Sir Francis, “I have
just left Lady Isabel. She is in her room,
indisposed ; but she told me to tell you”
and he went on to say what she says in the
drama. But Lady Isabel spoiled it all. She
rose from her seat in the audience and
declared: “What I did say, ladies and gentle-
men, was that if I did not get my salary
I would not go on!”
“Extra Turn”: Vaudeville artists know
the value of quaint and catchy titles. A
recent pair on Tivoli bills appeared as
“Robin and Hood.” Another “duo” an-
nounced themselves as “Niagara and Falls” ;
and a comic singer took pride in being Mr.
Dusty Rhodes. In England, at the Coliseum,
a featured musical act was given by “Flot-
sam and Jetsam.” One of these is that
splendid Australian-horn singer Malcolm
McEacliern.
“Hamfat”: The story of Thespian hard
luck culminating with “I handed the audience
back his money and we had a drink to-
gether,” told now as a personal yarn by
nearly every visiting mummer, is, I suspect,
a gag as old as theatrical history ; but ven-
triloquist Val Vousden was the first I heard
tell it. Very likely
it had happened to
Val, who used
upon occasion to
do the smallest of
the “smalls” with
a one-man show.
His manager could
never be certain
that Val would
turn up, even when
a “h ouse” was
secured. One wet
night in a little
one-pub timber
town an audience
of a score or so
arrived in spite of
the rain, but Vous-
den failed to
appear. The man-
ager let the house
take care of itself
whilst he dashed
down to the hotel,
where he found his
ma n comfortably
seated in the pub
parlor, with his
legs on the table.
Bring ’em down
h ere, and we'll
have the show com-
fort a b 1 y,” was
Vousden’s order;
and the show was
actually held in
the pub, and was
quite a successful
affair, helped along
by drinks. His audience induced the ventri-
loquist to give another night’s show—and
the hall was packed.
“Ancient Prompter”: I am with “The
Stage Cat” (B. 21/10/’26) in thinking that
“Hamfat” erred in saying that J. B. Athol-
wood once “went on” for Julius Knight as
Monsieur Beaucaire. With all his versa-
tility, I do not imagine Jimmy would include
romantic heroes in his lines of business.
“Hamfat” was probably confusing Beaucaire
with that other French hero, Napoleon.
Atholwood has often played that character —
or caricature —in “The Royal Divorce,” and
I have no doubt he was every bit as effective
as J. Knight. But what under-study or emer-
gency actor, stepping into the breach, ever re-
ceived proper recognition for his performance?
“Hamfat” : Actors arrive mainly by acci-
dent now, and some of them are very bad
accidents; but I remember being shown by
an actor of the old school the “articles”
under which he trained in the company of
the Keans for six years. A hundred little
technical details of stage-craft, considered
very important in a former day, are over-
looked nowadays. I remember an old mum-
mer employed in the co. giving a heart-wrung
moan when he saw an imported star leaning
his weight on the foot nearest the audience
as he declaimed his lines. It was a small
point, undeserving the thespian’s deep
anguish, perhaps; but there was a sound
argument behind it.
“Joseph”: What an aston-
ishing number of those who
appeared in the original pro-
ductions of G. and S. operas
came afterwards to Austra-
lia ! Only those in their fifties
will remember the first Gaiety
Company. Nellie Farren, who
headed it, was in “Thespis;
or the Gods Grown Old,” the
first G. and S. venture. With
her in that piece was .1. L.
Toole, here in the nearly ’nine-
ties with a repertory of farces.
In his co. was Violet Van-
brugh, who was in “The
Fairy’s Dilemma.” Marion
Hood, another Gaiety favo-
rite, was in “The Pirates of
Penzance.” So, too, was Alice
Barnett, for whom Gilbert
wrote a number of his old-
women parts, which she sub-
sequently repeated here with
the Royal Comic Opera Com-
pany. Frank Thornton, here
so many times with “The Pri-
vate Secretary,” was in
“Patience.” Lenora Braham
was in “lolanthe,” and later
here in comic opera. Harry
St. Maur, a comedian remem-
bered now only by the middle-
aged, was in “The Princess.”
So, too, were Henry Bracy
and Chas. Ryley. Wallace
Brown low, Courtice Pounds
and W. 11. Denny were in
“Yeomen of the Guard.”
Decima Moore was in “The
Gondoliers” ; Charles Kenningham and Flor-
ence Perry were in “Utopia Ltd.”;
Workman and Beatrice Perry in “The Grand
Duke.” Harry Monkhouse, the comedian with
the co. that first brought Grace Palotta to
Australia, was in “The Mountebanks”;
Ellaline Terriss was in “His Excellency.”
And Claude Flemming was in “Fallen
Fairies,” the last of Gilbert’s operatic pieces.
“Burralong”: When I go to Melbourne
Majesty’s, as a matter of course I stroll along
to the quiet refreshmentery, off the dress-
circle foyer, and have a smoke. There one
finds an air of at-liomeness that makes one
want to call again. At Sydney Majesty’s,
when one visits the refreshment room off the
circle corridor for a smoke, one is early
advised that, though lemon-squashing is en-
couraged, smoking is forbidden. Same
theatrical firm, same sort of theatre-goers,
yet different rules. Whaffor?
“Alwyn”: Imposingly dubbed “Nicholls’
Gallery of Sculpture,” Sydney’s first wax-
works opened its doors in 1851. Located in
Dowling-street, Woolloomooloo, it was open
between 10 a.m. and dusk. On Thursdays
the price of admission was 2s. 6d.; on other
days, a shilling. Among the exhibits was a
statue of Captain Cook, modelled by the
enterprising proprietor himself. The Herald
commented: “We sincerely trust that Mr.
Nicholls may be soon engaged in reproducing
it in a more durable material than wax for
some public exhibition in Sydney.”
“Nero” : The second Australian actress to
see her name in electrics on the Great White
Way in New York (Francie, now Judith,
Anderson was the first) is Esther Mitchell,
playing lead in 11. V. Esmond’s “The House
of Usher,” opposite the old Bensonian, Clar-
ence Derwent. She is reported to have made
a genuine success. Her husband, Plumpton
Wilson, has been re-engaged by Walter
Hampden to appear in Tom Barry’s “The
Eternal Thief”- —written round one of the
thieves on the Cross !
“L.H.P.”: Reference to Marie De Grey
in a recent Bulletin recalls pleasant memo-
ries of her show at the old-time Sydney
Opera House in King and York streets. Her
“School for Scandal” production was fine,
with Morton Selton as a young and dazzling
Charles and herself a lovely Lady Teazle.
Her repertoire was excellent. During this
memorable season of 1884 Sydney got admir-
able shows of the classic English comedies,
including the rarely-acted “Country Girl”
and “The Busybody.” also “As You Like It,”
and as novelties “Moths,” “The Ironmaster,”
“Woman Against Woman” and “Adrienne
Lecouvrier.” We get nothing like it now.
“Schnorrer” : The venerable Sydney Jew-
ish minister, A. D. Wolinski, lost a brother
when “the blind comedian” Ben Welch died
in New York. Welch, the front-ranker
among Yiddish comedians, used to earn
£lO,OOO a year even before vaudeville salaries
ascended to their present height, but six
years ago blindness fell upon him. In spite
of that and his age he remained in vaude-
ville, and was always a good draw.
“De Oriel”: When Wilkie produced “The
Merchant” benefit performance in Melbourne
recently he had prominent barristers and
doctors as magnificoes, Senators, etc., during
the old Venetian Court scene. And they
frequently consulted the timepieces upon
their wrists! Producer Dawn had the same
experience in Port Arthur (Tas.) when film-
ing “The Term.” Several prominent Hobart-
onians were permitted to play convict
OUR GREAT EMPTY SPACES.
LEADING LADY: “I cannot wear this costume — it’s more
than I can hare.”
supers.; but the scenes had to be re-taken,
as the new convicts were wearing wristlet
watches.
“Vera K.”: “Hamfat” (B. 7/10/’26) says
it is' a rare thing for Hobart to see a play
before it has whiskers. There are excep-
tions. “Outward Bound,” which a recent
Poverty Pointer lamented had never been pro-
duced in Australia, was played in Hobart by
the Zillali Bateman co. .Judging by some of
the shows I saw in Melbourne last month,
Hobart has much to be thankful for in
being off the beaten track.
“Peter Pan”: Old-friend Hugh Huxham
is another of us who “retire” with reluc-
tance. After his costume-comedy co.’s season
in Hobart over a year ago, Hugh put it
around that he was going out of the busi-
ness ; but recently he bobbed up again at
Cremorne Theatre, Brisbane, as producer
only of the musical show there, and is already
putting new life into a show that was con-
sidered to be on its last legs. Now it is an-
nounced that “Hugh and Edith Huxham are
to specially appear in the cast for one week
only in operatic numbers.”
“Maestro”: Ernest Rolls (B. 21/10/’26)
is one of the musical Darewski family. His
two brothers, Max and Herman, are well-
known conductors and composers overseas.
Herman _ was in this country looking after
the musical accompaniments when his wife,
Madge Temple, was doing the Tivoli circuit.
Ernest did the same for his wife, Jennie
Benson, also a vaudeville star, here a year
or two ago.
THIS DECADENT AGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The public has changed in 20 years, and the
stage with it. The biggest change I can quote is
the use of ‘vocal violence.’ Twenty years ago we
would not have dreamed of using upon the stage
the language which is used to-day in the name of
realism.” —Hugh J. Ward.
Ferdinand FitzOtjierdays, log.:
Twenty years ago,
Who would have dreamed that words so precious low
They’d grace a Billingsgate virago’s rage
Would e’er be heard upon the living stage ?
Then ’twould have been, most like, an actor’s knell
To murmur—unless Biblically—“ Hell !”
And, Lord! we trembled for the wight who’d slam
In prim Convention’s face one fearful “Damn!”
But now the blankies how they roar and rip
Through ev’ry foot of almost ev’ry scrip!
It was not, laddie, that the words of hue
Were altogether—well, langue inconnue ;
But if they bubbled up (say, after tids)
We kept ’em for the missus and the kids;
For actors knew what actors owed the show
Twenty years ago.
Twenty years ago
We needed no ungracious gutter-flow
Of diction, sir, to make our meaning plain;
Nor to such utter depths would any deign
To abase his art. And yet, you must allow,
It points a truth —there are no actors now !
For, look you, where’s to-day your leading mime
Could launch for you (as in that halcyon time
We needs must do), sans speech, a sizzling curse
That blistered like a branding-iron, or worse?
There never were, despite your licensed speech,
With all uncensored Fitzroy-ese in reach —
There never were nor will be words, I wis,
Obscene as any old-time villain’s hiss.
Actors we were; but bullock-drivers—no,
Twenty years ago.

I don’t know what circassion is,
Or, for that matter, kasha;
And in the girl I choose to kiss,
Though she may be a dasher
Of modern type, I’ll seek the show
Of colors that I trust and know.
Perhaps the luring hues of eve
A r e rachelle and rosita;
These two romance may subtly weave
To set young hearts a-tweeter;
But willingly I will not seek
To kiss a lady’s hoggar cheek.
These colors may strike others dumb,
But, putting it quite plainly,
Sunburn and aluminium
Will tempt my fancy vainly.
The cheri lips of Rose Marie
And amber ale will do for me.

Not quite punctually at 8.10 p.m. last
Saturday a Sydney Criterion audience was
introduced to the household and friends of
Ernest Stanton, M.P., at the moment receiv-
ing congratulations upon his daughter’s mar-
riage. The moneyed Stanton, with a mouth-
ful of high-sounding sentiments and an in-
creasing circle of limpets, is steadily pushing
his way into British public life ; his daugh-
ter’s marriage to a scion of the peerage is
an important part of the pushing. Mavis
is really in love with her seemingly present-
able but really lamentable bridegroom, whose
family history holds more decay than
nobility, and who is himself a degenerate,
with a love of cruelty where cruelty is safe,
a mass of lunatic suspicions, a dishonest
character, and a taste for drugs which in
six years’ time helps his other bad qualities'
to take possession. Reduced nearly to a
w T reck herself by association with his beast-
liness, Mavis, deciding that the situation
must end, appeals to her father for advice
and help; and when he has proved himself
nothing more than a pretentious windbag,
with more regard for his social pride than
for his daughter’s happiness, the task of
rescue devolves on Geoffrey Sands, a direc-
tor of Stanton’s firm, who has known Mavis
from babyhood. With the knowledge that
there is another man in waiting who will
probably make her happy, Sands deliberately
arranges the elimination of the waster in
circumstances that will point to suicide;
and later, when the phrase-bound Stanton
insists on describing the end of the degen-
erate as the act of a “courageous English
gentleman” who removed himself rather than
be a nuisance to others, he tells him all
about it, challenging Stanton to inform the
police of his confession. With the know-
ledge that, when Sands’s reasons are given,
his own moral cowardice will be exposed,
Stanton avoids the challenge. Frederick
Lonsdale, who in “The Fake” shows a seri-
ous mood, succeeds so well in his argument
that there are circumstances in which kill-
ing is no murder that he had the audience
with him; the play might have finished,
however, when Stanton, with the ’phone in
his hand and Scotland Yard at the other end
of the line, turns from his intention of de-
nouncing Sands to giving a patronising word
of thanks for the manner in which the in-
quest was conducted. The tirade against
Stanton which follows is quite superfluous.
“The Fake” offers good acting opportuni-
ties, of which Moscovitch naturally got the
lion’s share as Geoffrey Sands, the candid
critic of political and social life in England;
it seemed a bigger lion’s share than it might
have been in lesser hands than Moscovitch’s.
Mary Macgregor rose in the second act,
grappled with the tragedy of the disillu-
sioned wife, and made a notable achievement
of it. Sincere simplicity was mainly respon-
sible for the success ; the tragedy was made
more poignant because the actress was never
tragical. Once his overdosing had dragged
the mask of decency from the Yvaster, Nat
Madison declined to let his character’s un-
pleasantness sink out of sight for a moment;
a brute who now and again dropped his
nastiness might have been more convincing.
The unctuous Stanton was well done by
George Zuceo; Margaret Murray made a
faithful character-study of the nervous Mrs.
Stanton, overawed by her husband; and
George Blunt was much more George Blunt
than Sir Thomas Moorgate, the bustling
medico. Reginald Newson was satisfactory
as Clifford Hope, the honest lover who hangs
in the offing according to best traditions.
In “Abie’s Irish Rose,” produced in Syd-
ney at the Royal on Saturday, Anne
Nicholls had the idea of blending the pro-
ducts of Ireland and Jewry, the two tradi-
tional sources of stage comedy; and for her
job she wms equipped with a blissful igno-
rance upon many points where a knowledge
might have spoilt the author’s confidence,
and an overflowing measure of heart-throb.
Artistically the play is ruined by the impos-
sibilities for which the ignorance aforesaid
is responsible. Abie, having made a hasty
marriage with Rosemary Murphy a
Methodist parson officiating—introduces the
lady to his father’s home, without mention-
ing the wedding, his idea being to bring the
old man under the spell of her charm before
his union with a non-Jewess is confessed.
Believing Rose to be a Jewess, old Solomon
Levy, who has been haunted by a dread that
his son will marry outside his religion,
delightedly hurries forward matters which
lead to a new marriage by the Rabbi, Dr.
Samuels; and on the arrival of Patrick
Murphy, who, like Solomon Levy, has been
deceived —in this case by the information
that his daughter is to marry Michael
McGee, a good R.C. Irishman —there is a
third marriage; as a way out of the tur-
moil which has descended upon the mixed
gathering, the priest, at the suggestion of
the Rabbi, puts the young couple through
according to R.C. rites. It is all as impos-
sible as the blending of ham and kosher in
the last act, when the happy union of Jewish
and Irish hearts is brought about by the
pull of the infant grandchildren. The bride
helps the situation greatly by giving birth
to twins whilst she is about it; and as one
of them is named Patrick and the other
Rebecca there is nothing left to quarrel
about. Hearts are good trumps in stage
work; and the liberal throbs, the easy humor
(some of it has a vaudeville flavor 1 and
ripe sentiment may carry the curious con-
coction through a long season.
The honors of the performance fall to
Jack Trainor, whose Jewish father, Solomon
Levy, was a sympathetically-drawn portrait
blending the lovable characteristics of the
ancient orthodox Hebrew with a humorous
racial caution that was nowhere over-
strained. The Mrs. Isaac Cohen of Bertha
Walden was also a well-defined study, and
John McCabe had a sound Irish brogue and
a breezy personality to carry him through
the boisterous lines of Patrick Murphy; but
Isaac Cohen (Marty Ford) was a direct
theft from the vaudeville stage, though pos-
sibly it is the author who ought to face the
charge. Blame may not attach, either, to
David Wall (Father Whalen) and Henry
Mortimer (Rabbi Jacob Samuels) that they
overlooked the limits beyond which even
the most liberal priest or rabbi must decline
to go. As the young husband, Abraham,
George Duryea was sincere, although stiff;
Grace Stafford represented a Rosie dainty
enough to reconcile even an orthodox Jew to
having half-Irish grandchildren.
“Rose Marie,” at Sydney Majesty's, will
be in its 23rd week on Saturday, which
equals the run of “Wildflower,” falls two
weeks short of “The Maid of the Mountains”
season, and has not far to go to eclipse the
absolute record of 26 weeks to the credit
of “Sally.” As it is mentioned that “Betty
Lee” is to be a tenant of St. James, the
end of “Mercenary Mary” appears imminent.
“Spangles,” in which Ada Reeve will glitter,
is the new event of Saturday night, the
venue being the G.0.H., from which “The
Sentimental Bloke” fades to-morrow night
(Friday). “Meet the Wife” has struck
popular fancy; night after night the Palace
proves too small.
Steele and Winslow, who dance on roller-
skates, fill out their artistic and clever work
at the Sydney Tivoli with solid, clean humor.
One of the couple, who is very tall and
lanky, more or less disguises himself as a
girl. He is blessed with a pair of legs
nobody would believe without seeing; and
in his eurhythmies as a woodland nymph in
“Soul of Spring” he reaches highwater-mark
in burlesque.
"MARITANA,’ AT
SYDNEY HIPPODROME.
“Maritana (Hilda Boyle) converses in song
with Don Jose (Richard McClelland).
To-night (Thursday) will be hectic at
Fullers’ New Theatre (Sydney), for it
will see the send-off to Clem Dawes and his
Midnight Frolics. The theatre will revert to
the old half-and-half show. The revue sec-
tion will be filled out with Moon and Morris,
who having captured Nell Fleming, amongst
others, have deserted their old two-character
turn for the form of vaudeville which has
grown most in favor of recent years.
The United Artists have turned the mystery
play, “The Bat,” into a very good film,
following the lines of the original drama,
with an amplification of detail which in
the play itself had to be described on the
stage by the characters; in the film all the
action is shown, and naturally that adds
to the thrills. “Satan in Sables” is coupled
with this film at the Lyceum (Sydney).
In “The Splendid Crime,” at Hoyt’s, a crowd
of story-book crooks scatter sentiment and
moral lessons; an interesting enough story,
if its crudities are overlooked. This is
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.

A Juggler with Light:—
Carl Hampel’s work is usually bright and refresh-
ing, but there are some pictures in his exhibition of
oils at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, which fall
far below his average. In the better work he makes
atmospheric melody in paint; “She-oaks—Morning”
is a good example, displaying misty sunlight in which
the trees and the shadows beneath them have a
quality of sleepy happiness. “A Narrabeen Headland”
is heavy in the foreground ; but the starkness of sun-
light is well expressed in the background.
If we had never seen “Aren't We All?”
played by the Yanbrugh-Boucieault co., the
revival at the King's (Melb.) on Saturday
night by the new Boucicault co. would still
be a disappointment. The comedy, which for-
merly sparkled, finds but poor presentation,
save from Dion himself, and on the first
evening even he was not at his best. Mrs.
Robert Brough, of course, is artistic. Mary
Jerrold disappoints as the designing, fascin-
ating woman of the world; she is charming,
but not subtle. And the Margot Tatham of
Angela Baddeley seems still further out of
the picture.
The Athenaeum, (Melb.) still tells “Nothing
but Lies.” No sign of reform is visible.
At the Princess “Lady, Be Good !” is waver-
ing, and on Derby Day Frank Neill will re-
introduce ns to “What Happened to Jones.”
Santrey’s instrumentalists still have the
lion’s share of the bill at the Tivoli; and to-
night (Thursday), when the last trams have
crept into the depot, Henry will wave his
baton for a special midnight performance.
“Is Zat So?” didn't take Melbourne by
storm. The comedy was well acted and
humorous enough, but we’ve had an over-
dose of Yankee plays. “Katja” still fills
His Majesty’s, and makes a fine race-week
offering, for. apart from the worth of the
principals, there are heaps of the latest
chiffons to give fair visitors a wwinkle as to
what is fashionable. “Aren’t We All?” is
to. be Dion Boucicault’s offering at the
King’s for the Cup carnival, with “Mary
Rose” to foliow. Renee Kelly is to appear
on Saturday night at the Royal in a role
after her own heart—“ Brown Sugar,” sweet,
but not refined. And “Don’t Tell the Wife”
is the special offering of Jim Gerald and his
revue co. at the Bijou.
Wirths' programme at the New Olympia
was strengthened on Saturday night by
several new-comers. Chief of these arrivals
is the Ridam Three, shapely maidens who
are a foil to a strong man with a wonderful
control over his muscles. Chester Dieck, an
Indian cyclist, adds something really thrill-
ing and'fresh in stunts of this kind, and
extraordinary balancing is accomplished by
the Bonellys.
Jane Novak, Eva’s fascinating sister, is
seen in “The Danger Signal,” which is good
material, at the Majestic (Melbourne) this
week. On Saturday Rin-tin-tm, the dog, will
arrive in “The Clash of Wolves —a fine
semi-scenic film.

A Show Without a Censor: —
The Vie. Artists’ Society is holding its spring
exhibition at the galleries in Albert-street, and after a
first look round one rings for the selection com-
mittee. Stuff is hung which would hardly giace an
agricultural show.
There are a great number of portraits, many of
them not good—a couple at least are honibly smug
and oleographic. W. B. Mclnnes heads the list of
the successful with his two portraits (53 and 71).
The first is an imposing likeness of Bishop Arm-
strong, of AVangaratta, in his robes. E. Buckmaster
has some capital pencil portraits and a piomising
oil. Some of the best landscapes in oils are fur-
nished by John Rowell (24), A. E. AValcott (40 and
41) and Mrs. Hedley Parsons (N.S.AV.) ; and ,J.
Beament has some effective sunlight in No. 56.
Esther Paterson has a clear, definite little compo-
sition in “Spring in Swanston Street,” and Dora
AVilson has a companion study of this season in
Collins-street. A portrait of Leslie Merrick and a
delightful study, all movement, also stand to this
artist’s credit. Victor Zelrnan and L. Bernard Hall
offer thoroughly sound work.
Marion Jones shows her scholarship picture, “Cui
Bono,” hung at the Royal Academy in 1923. She
also has some well-painted roses; other flowers of
note are by Annie Gates (104), Daisy Stone (60),
Mrs. L. McD. Armstrong and George Bell. The
water-color section has much that is very commend-
able ; No. 185, by Victor Cobb, was the first pur-
chased picture of the exhibition. Laura Booth, Mrs.
Iledley Parsons, E. M. Boyd, Arthur Boyd, Airs.
Ami Zimmerdahl and Marie Buchanan are successful
here. Paul Montfort’s “Peter Pan,” which will
decorate one of our gardens, is the arresting bit
of sculpture—an Australian re-creation of Barrie’s
hero. Margaret Baskcrville, J. R. Tranthim Fryer
and Douglas Richardson are represented, and some
miniatures add interest to the show, though there
is nothing outstanding in them.
More picture-shows In Melbourne: —
Charles AVheeler’s show of canvases at the New
Gallery is arresting. In portraiture he has made very
great progress in his art; Violet Knight’s good
looks are admirably portrayed above a sapphire-blue
velvet gown and embroidered white shawl. Then
there is a lady who, risking pneumonia, has fallen
asleep in the altogether, and whose flesh seems real
and her slumber unfeigned. His landscapes, with
soft shadow and shine and a certain poetic treatment,
speak of difficulties thought out and overcome. He
is happiest when depicting the bronze tints of the
autumn, or the young warm tones of early spring,
as in Nos. 24 and 26. “The Good Brown Earth”
(28) has particular attraction on account of the
capital painting of the plough-horses.
The weather is getting almost too warm for the
critic to view with judicial calm such a show as H.
Sennett provides at the Athenaeum. His large oil
studies of the Grampians convey the impression that
they are as hard to paint as they look difficult to
climb. His fellow-conspirator, F. Latimer, is a
graduate of the chocolate-box cover school. He has
pleasantly caught the character of the lovers’ lanes
provided by the obliging ti-tree within easy reach
of Melbourne; but when he painted F. Collier, Esq.,
J.P., he looked sideways at the worthy gentleman.
Civil servants will get no assistance in the selection
of a home at Canberra from Harold Herbert’s latest
show of water-colors at the Fine Art Gallery. The
exasperating fellow has only painted churchyards and
ancient farmhouses. His usual fine draughtsmanship
is shown in these, as well as his lack of a complete
sense of rhythm. His coloring is full of placid
charm, but his composition is apt to be distracting.
When he alights on a landscape with a natural unity
about it, he can be delightful.
“Tell Me More,” at Adelaide Royal, is a
riot of color, of dancing and of fun. Indeed,
there is possibly too much fun, and the
music-hall backchat that Gus Bluett loves,
and that holds up the action of the play,
might well be cut down a bit. With Maud
Fane and Margery Hicklin present, sheer
charm is unusually strong. Thyrza Rogers
pavlovas gloriously, George Gee is all over
the show, and a lot of clever people are
almost lost in the crush. Backhaus has
come and gone, greatly praised and mod-
erately patronised. Frank Hurley appears
in person at West’s, where his “Jungle
Woman” film is a thing not to be missed.
“Hugh Stone”: I don't question “Caesar's
Ghost’s” statement (B. 5/8/’26) that a tele-
gram addressed to a Sydney footlighter at
Poverty Point was delivered at the Criterion
corner; but P.P. was not always there. It
used to be at the intersection o£ Castlereagh
and King streets; the Royal was then the
chief theatre, and a musical gent, named
Sebastian Hodge ran a Thespian-haunted
pub over the way. A little further up the
street another stage strutter kept the Oxford
Hotel. Those days—alas ! —have gone and
taken the threepenny pint with them.

“Valet” Blades outlast the blades of the non-stropping
variety of safety-razor because the original superline
edge is kept in the pink of condition by a simple
method of stropping.
The “Valet” Razor is the only Razor that strops its
blade without requiring a special machine. Nothing
to take to pieces. Nothing to unscrew. Simplicity
itself.
Quality of blade, simplicity of mechanism and
economy in practice are the underlying principles
which characterise the “Valet.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
For a horse that had been “under a
cloud,” Heroic looked uncommonly well when he
came out to do his preliminary for the W. S. Cox
Plate at Moonee Valley. And McShortodds took no
liberties with the alleged invalid; he demanded
5 to 4, Limerick being 2 to 1 against, Cromwell
8 to 1, and Kellow’s other representative, Metellus,
15 to 1. Heroic was a bit rebellious at the barrier,
but he jumped away well enough. Limerick and
Metellus led past the stand, two lengths in front of
Heroic, and the Maoriland three-year-old was clear
of Metellus at the mile post, but Metellus had
reversed positions six furlongs from home. At the
four -furlongs, however, Cairns let Heroic go, and
the chestnut soon had the opposition at his mercy;
at the judge’s box he was three lengths in front of
Limerick, who finished pretty well, while Metellus
was the same distance away and Cromwell another
half a length astern. Heroic left the 91 furlongs
behind in lmin. 58sec. Limerick did not greatly
impress Melbourne racegoers (his split heel, however,
bothered him during the race and bled afterwards),
but Metellus ran better than they expected, and
Cromwell shaped respectably considering his long-
absence from the track.

There were 15 starters for the Moonee Valley Cup.
and Royal Charter, on his third in the big Caulfield
handicap, was always favorite; from 5 to 2 lie
shortened to 7 to 4. Spearer was second choice at
7 to 1, Tookarby and Naos being at 8 to 1, Battery-
man at 10 to 1, and Bard of Avon and Warwickshire
at 14 to 1. Bard of Avon was in the van early, and
with six furlongs to go he still led from Redshank,
Raron (20 to 1), and Royal Charter. Raron went
to the front three furlongs from home, but entering
the straight Royal Charter joined him, and although
the eolt hung on gamely the favorite was too* good;
he won decisively by three parts of a length, Battery-
man being a length or so behind Raron. Epilogue was
fourth, and Naos (running on), Bard of Avon and
Stralia did best of the others. Tookarby’s saddle
slipped at the turn, where he looked like running
into a place. Royal Charter, who completed the
big double for Holt, is a five-year-old gelding by
Comedy King—Polylogy, and is owned by V.R.ci.
committeeman J. M. Niall. Duncan rode him in
quite his best style, and there was no loafing on
the journey, the 11( furlongs being covered in 2min.

A.. G. Barlow -was smiling expansively after the
meeting. His Paper Money—Philomela colt, The
Wensum (2 to 1), got away with the colts’ division
of the St. Albans Handicap, and his Poetaster (4
to 1), well known in Sydney, downed a warm
favorite in Quixotic (2 to 1) in the first division
of the Dundonald Welter. It was rather surprising to
see Vali care’s stable-mate, who has never shone
under substantial burdens, backed so solidly for a
race of that class. Cooper piloted Barlow’s two
winners.

All going well in the meantime, Rampion
should win the Victoria Derby on Saturday, as
Manfred did last year and Salitros in 1920 after
succeeding in the N.S.W. classic. Rampion beat
Limerick fairly and squarely at Randwick, and has
since added the Caulfield Guineas to his collection,
whereas Limerick has been twice beaten at w.f.a.,
and has a heel which bleeds after a race. However,
the injury did not prevent his making a splendid
effort in the A.J.C. Craven Plate four days after the
Derby, and if he can reproduce that form at Flem-
ington he will prove a worthy opponent for anything
in the land. Cromwell, Raron and Epilogue are colts,
that are coming on, and it will be no cakewalk for
Rampion, though form points to his success. Vali-
care is not to start in the Melbourne Stakes, but
Manfred and Heroic should provide a great tussle,
of which Manfred may get the better by just about
the advantage in weight. It is many years since
the same youngster took the Debutant Stakes and
the Maribyrnong Plate, but Euston may do it this
time; his display at Caulfield was convincing. The
Cantala Stakes is a problem; Amounis (9st. 81b.),
Metellus (9st. 41b.), Perspective (Bst. 51b.), Aorangi
(7st. 71b.) and Abdera (7st. 61b.) all have chances.
Metellus, who is little short of weight-for age form
and very fit, may fight it out with Aorangi. And
Naos (7st. 91b.) will perhaps take out the Hotham
Handicap if he has the services of the Westralian
jockey Percival, whose vigorous methods suit the
little slug.
The Cup is very open. Had Windbag and Pillie-
winkie remained in it would have been one of the
best fields in the history of the race, and even with-
out them it will be much above the average. Partly
for that reason this Page expects Manfred’s task
to be too great for him, exceptional horse though
he is. If he couldn’t win at three years with 7st.
81b. he is unlikely to win at four with lOst. lib.
Heroic is a more taking proposition with 9st. 101 b. ;
the shrewd judge who framed the weights esteemed
him 51b. better than Manfred. Still, there is life
doubt whether either of these fine sons of Valais is
a stayer in the sense that Spearfelt (9st. 31b.),
Pantheon (9st. 31b.) and The Banker (Bst. 121 b.)
are stayers. Spearfelt, Pantheon and The Banker
have won at two miles, a feat which neither of the
topweights has accomplished. The three-year-olds
are a “warm” lot, Rampion (7st. 91b), Limerick
(7st. 51b.) and Raron (7st. 21b.) especially
the Derby winner will, of course, have to
carry 7st. 61b. if handicapped at less than
that. And there are some good stayers among
the others: Spearer (Bst. 61b.), Royal Charter (Bst.
51b.), Johnnie Jones (Bst.), Naos (7st.), Stralia
(6st. 121 b.) and Beedos (6st. 71b.). The Bulletin
took a fancy to Naos when he raced at Randwick
in the autumn. It was also impressed with Pan-
theon’s fast finish in the Metropolitan, wherein he
ran second to Star Stranger, with 31b. more than
his Cup weight, after having been all over the course,
and with his subsequent triumph in the Randwick
Plate, with 9st. 71b. —he ran two miles in 3min.
23fsec. without being in the least bit dis-
tressed. Pike will make a difference to this fine-
looking and thoroughly-seasoned English horse, and
Percival to Naos, who is bred to stay for a week
and was really good the day he won the Coongy
Handicap. There has rarely been a more puzzling
Cup, but Naos and Pantheon are here selected to
beat all the rest, with a slight preference for the
lightweight, because he is a lightweight.
“Toby C.”: The Bush will get the Cup
result before the prads have cooled down. It wasn’t
so before radio arrived. I was one of a party who
didn’t learn of Westcourt’s victory until we “came
in for Christmas.” And then the first man we asked
wasn’t sure whether the winner was Prizefighter or
Uncle Sam. The prad I backed in the late Metro-
politan was just making his run when news of Star
Stranger’s triumph reached our Queensland camp.
Platers came into their own again at
Moorefield (N.S.W.) on Saturday, all the good horses
now in training having gone to Melbourne. Two
rising apprentice jockeys had a successful day: J.
Coutts won on Persuasion (3 to 1) for his boss, IV.
Kelso, and on Coolahville (10 to 1) for J. A.
Scully, the race in each ease being a six-furlong
sprint; and A. Goddard got the hitherto erratic
Border Chief (9 to 2) home in the Moorefield Handi-
cap, 10 furlongs, just missing the double on Prince
Colugo (14 to 1) in the Welter —Blackman (3 to 1)
cut him out of it by a head. They are both
clever boys, and one or other may be as prominent
in years to come as Pike, Munro and Toohey are
to-day. Restricted to 10-furlong handicaps in sub-
urban company, Border Chief, who is by Shepherd
King—Uniformity, will probably win again; and
Woolita and Goldfinder should also make amends for
recent disappointments if properly .placed.

Jack Finn, who died at Randwick last
week, was one of the oldest trainers in N.S.W. He
will be chiefly remembered as a tutor of jumpers, his
best effort in this direction being the Lochiel geld-

flashes of Davis Cup form in Adelaide.
ing Beilis, who won the V.R.C. Grand National in
1905. Other good ones in his stable were Old Mun-
gindi, who won the same race in 1917, King Mostyn
and Lord Nagar. Finn began with the ponies, being
one of the founders of the long-extinct Driving Park
Club, but later went over to the legitimate game.

“Caller Oo”: Financial depression, coal
strike and war debt notwithstanding, there arc still
barrels of money in Britain for young bloodstock.
At Doncaster yearling sales, where many a renowned
turf champion has made his first bow to the public,
11 youngsters brought 66,000 guineas. Top price was

colt, and a colt by Gainsborough brought 7000
guineas. The highest price for a filly was 6000

Newcastle was so confident that Billy
Edwards (list. 4}lb.) would whip “Sunny Jim” Wil-
liams (list. sjflb. ) and backed its opinion so
solidly that the white lad was 6 to 4 on when
the trouble began at the Sydney Stadium; the
THE ADDICT.
FEATHERSTONEHAUGH : "You seem to spend

GEE: “Well, the wife won’t let me smoke in
the house.”
negro had been favorite at the races. There were
thrills in the very first round, for the coon swung
a right on to Edwards’s exposed jaw and dropped
him, and, when he foolishly hopped up before the
referee could start counting, floored him again.
Billy wasn’t badly rattled, however, as he showed
by carrying the fight to the American amid a frenzy
of cheering. Williams retreated round and round
the ring nearly all through the second stanza, and
remained more or less, coy during the third and
fourth (which was Billy’s) ; but, the black man
won the fifth, and in the sixth dazed the white with
a powerful right swing to the jaw. Then he tore in,
swinging both hands to the unprotected jaw, till
the sight was as distressing as Edwards’s refusal to
be downed was amazing. The game lad actually
assumed the offensive, and the coon clinched.
Throughout the seventh and eighth the colored gentle-
man roused the crowd to fury by his grab-and-hang-
on tactics, and there were shouts of “He’s yours,
Billy—he’s got a yellow streak 1” A change" came
o’er the scene in the ninth. Williams attacked
furiously and was whole-heartedly met by the
white. The tenth had hardly started when one of
those wild swings caught Edwards fair on the point,
and he fell on his back, bumping his head hard on the
canvas. The boy was counted out, and should have
been protected from any further onslaught, but he
struggled up somehow, onlv to be rushed by the now
madly-excited black and bashed into unconsciousness for
10 minutes. The referee crowned Williams amid a
storm of hooting. The “gate” totalled £2599 25.,
so the fighters got about £650 each.
“Backseater”: So another young Australian boxer
who, wisely handled, might have reached the first
flight, has been sacrificed to short-sighted greed.
1 suppose the winner will be advertised as champion
of Australia—he has been here long enough. Another
American negro who came out in the same crate
claims to have qualified to box for the Australian
title, and no doubt it will be put up presently for an
all-black meeting. There is supposed to be an Immi-
gration Restriction Act, but it has become a pleasant
jest where boxing promoters foregather, and nobody
enjoys the joke more than the Labor politicians
who swarm in the ringside seats.

The American wrestlers having gone
home, vowing to return next year and collect a
lot more easy Australian money, the Melbourne
Stadium management put on a boxing bill of
no earth-shaking importance on Saturday. Jack
Bowden (9st. 4flb.) outpointed Johnny Taylor (9st.
21b.), who has a reputation for flashness and is
treated accordingly; Filipino Joe Gonsalves (9st.
lib.) had the fading Ben Martin (Bst. 12J1b.) out
on his feet at the conclusion of their argument, and
Billy Moodie (lOst. 2-jib.) settled Ray Stewart (lOst.
in six rounds. “Sports” stayed away in vast
numbers, and their judgment proved sound.

Two days before Ilenley-on-the-Yarra, 19
racing boats were destroyed in the fire that swept
away Edwards and Sons’ sheds. Boats were, however,
borrowed from all points of the compass, and,
except that four scullers could not be accommodated,
the full programme was carried out—a first-class
feat of organisation, for there were 23 crews in
one of the eight races and 20 in another. The
Westralians, who won the Senior Fours last year,
didn't send a crew over this time, .but Maoriiand,
Tasmania and Queensland were represented. Otago
(M.L.) carried off the Cup; giving an uncommonly
good display of rowing, it easily disposed of Weri-
douree (Vic.), which had defeated Mercantile (Tas.)
in its heat. Mildura repeated its 1925 victory in the
Maiden Eights, but the Maiden Fours on this occa-
sion went to Essendon No. 1. Melbourne annexed
the Senior Eights, Mercantile the Junior Eights, and
Wahgunyah the Junior Fours. Cambridge, the Sand-
hurst champion, was again first home in the Senior
Sculls, but he had to travel at his top to beat P. A.
Trouchet (W.A.), son of a Frenchman fiom Mauritius
who has settled in Perth.

While all the other States sent represen-

clubs held a regatta on the Parramatta with the
four-oared championship of N. S. Wales as leading
attraction. Mosman retained the title though
Sydney, stroked by M. G. Mackenzie, kept at the
winners all through the race. Haberfield, the latest
addition to Sydney rowing, opened its account by
taking the Maiden Fours. New blood is welcome,
but one wishes that country clubs could shoVe their
oars into these metropolitan regattas as they do in
most other parts of the Commonwealth.

First prize in the Sun-Herald £5OO com-
petition, the most valuable golf tourney staged in
Australia, was collected last week by F. Eyre, the
Long Reef (N.S.W.) pro., who beat A. le Fcvre,
from the Royal Melbourne club, on Kensington
(N.S.W.) links by 6 up and 5 to play. Approach
shots and putting were the winner’s strong suits.
As “Happy” Eyre he is well known to Manly surfers,
and, like his dad, the original “Happy,” he was a
representative Rugby Union forward. He first shook
hands with golf as a nine-year-old caddie at Manly.
This is young “Happy’s” first big win, but he has
years of improvement ahead of him.
* * * *
“Slow Back”: The German has not yet
mastered the royal and ancient game; his first open
golf championship proved a gift for foreigners. An
Englishman was first, and a Frenchman rubbed it
in by running second, another Englishman and a
Belgian filling third and fourth places. Yet if Yankee
efficiency has achieved such results in golf, German
thoroughness should reach equal heights. No game
calls for. more concentration, and the German has
few equals in that quality. Then there are the
magnificent cursing facilities of the German language.
It may take some time, but for the German golf
champion Der Tag will surely dawn.
* * * •
“Real Estate”: Arne Borg, who has
been smashing more records at Stockholm, is some-
thing of a wag. On arriving at Melbourne he
hurried to the City Baths with Frank Beaurepaire.
Not long before the condition of the water in
the baths (they have since been remodelled) had
been the subject of hostile comment. A newspaper-
man told Borg of this, and asked him how he liked
the taste of the water. Borg grinned, and explained
through an interpreter that he “never drank water
except at meal-times.”

“Centurion” : This season the N.S.W.C.A.
will pay its representatives in Sheffield Shield and
minor inter-State matches 20s. a day for games in
Sydney and 255. a day while playing in other
States, Sundays to be included. Victoria and South
Australia allow their men no pay for home matches,
and once upon a time Queensland paid nothing at
home or abroad. Last season Northern Staters
received ss. a day. As this amount is allowable
under the amateur definition, Bananaland can still
repudiate charges of veiled professionalism. As a
matter of fact, not one Australian player in 20 can
afford to play Shield cricket without being paid to
do so. The amateur affectation should be cut out.
* » * *
“Shrewsbury”: The belated passing of the
old stars of N.S.W. cricket may yet give some of
the neglected younger set a chance before their grey
hairs become their chief claim to inter-State distinc-
tion. Such a one is Andy Ratcliffe, of Glebe.
Andy is one of the best left-hand batsmen now
playing anywhere, and as a ’keeper he is only second
in N.S.W. to Oldfield. He is a fine outfield as well,
so it would not be necessary to keep him in the
pavilion if Oldfield was playing as stumper. 1
suppose Kippax’s position is safe, though one never
knows. On Saturday the Waverley crack scored his
third successive century in club cricket, his innings
being full of the grace and style which mark him
off from all other Australian batsmen. Still, if
Sid Gregory decided to return to the game, Kippax
might have to stand down. Being only 25 or so, he
was too young to be taken to England this year,
though if he had been 50 he would have been one
of the first half-dozen.
* * * #
“ Post Mortem ”: M. A. Noble, whose
cricket comment commands more respect than most,
told a farewell luncheon party in England that spin-
bowling would have to be cultivated again if the
game was to come back to its old standards; and
Noble is right. The googly and swerve obsessions
have lowered the general standard of bowling in
both Australia and England. The fad of cultivating
the swerve at the cost of length and pace off
the pitch has ruined hundreds of young bowlers.
Its best exponents can do nothing with it, save
with the new ball, unless wind conditions assist;
in fact,, the swerver’s chief use is to catch an
opening batsman while the gloss is on the ball, or
to try an over or two whenever the new ball comes
out. Great spin-bowlers of the past, like Turner
and George Lohmann, did not rely on special contin-
gencies to get wickets, but raked them in on all
sorts of pitches and against batsmen whose like
are not now seen on every Test arena. Good-length
spin-bowling- is the marrow of attack in cricket
just as the straight bat is the marrow of attack
(or defence) in batting.
* * * *
Clem Hill lias been dropped by South
Australia, not only as Board of Control delegate
but also as a selector for the State XI. The reason
is solely that as a stipendiary steward of racing he
has not the chance to keep in touch with pennant
matches and rising talent. Bridgman, whom Clem
replaced several years ago, comes in again as a
selector, with Travers and Vic Richardson.

The Maori Rugby Union team did splen-
didly in Wales last week, playing a scoreless draw
with Newport and beating Swansea, 11—6 ; Pelham
the visitors’ full-back, scored a sensational try, a
stunt rarely attempted in British Rugby. Cardiff
Newport and Swansea are probablv the three best
clubs playing the game anywhere, so Parata and his
men have reason to congratulate themselves. The
Big Three gave the original All Blacks the hardest
games of their tour; the difference in favor of
Gallagher’s men was only a couple of points in
each game.

Whip shivering mortals day by day;
No more, storm-driven down the street
Like scudding leaves, men make their way.
The summer tempts us to delay
By field and flood, by park and shore ;
The white-winged craft are on the bay
And football umpires die no more.
No more, as in a winding-sheet,
The bleak sky wraps, the world in grey ;
No more in muffling furs discreet
Do flaunting flappers hide away
The little left ’em to display,
That eyes have not beheld before;
The cricket joss resumes his sway
And football umpires die no more.
No more do loud arenas greet
Huge muddied oafs in fierce affray;
Antagonists more leisured meet
Upon the green in trim array;
Hoarse barrackers forbear to bay
For barrels full of someone’s gore ;
Hot ram no more the pubs purvey
And football umpires die no more.

Less unforgiving crowds survey
The shattered stumps or mounting score;
Till April comes again, or May,
The football umpires die no more.

REVOLUTION in SHAVING!
Old Way: Rubbing
Soap made with Soda
NO SOAP! NO BRUSH!
Why the Shavex Way has come to stay
ShaveX
M
New Way:
Smear lightly
over face
Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as well.

The cottage in Ballarat where Adam Lind-
say Gordon lived in the 'sixties is still well
preserved. It is at the rear of Craig’s
Hotel. Recently, when sewerage excava-
tions were being made hard by, the well was
discovered whereat the poet used to water
his horse after a cross-country ride.
From an Adelaide critic: —
Herbert, Gallop has a one-man show at the Punster
G'allerv. He has some elusive charm, notably in a
Canberra canvas that will have historic; value some
day, arid in Blue Mountain studies. But he would
just as soon paint a back fence or a cowshed ; and
it is a very honest literal work of the latter 1 type
that the Adelaide Art Gallery has fancied and
secured —as well as a charming etching.
The death of Station-officer Frederick
Morris whilst tackling a fire at a Botany
tannery—a collapse of the floor precipitated
him into a heap of burning woodwork —is the
first tragedy amongst N.S.W. fire-fighters
since the collapse of an 85ft. ladder at the
tire at Adams’s Hotel in 1922 flung fireman
Brown to the pavement. Morris, 52 years
old, had been fighting blazes for 25 years. To
his pals he was “Slogger”—in his youth he
had been a champion boxer.
A new flavor has been added to the collec-
tion-plate by the appeal of a N.S.W. Back-
blocks parson, now in England, for the gift
of a “Moth” ’plane. A missioner of the
Bush iCliurch Aid Society, the padre, Daniels
by name, looks after souls out Wilcannia
way. Before that he was in the Big Fuss
with an Imperial regiment, and later with
the R.A.F. His experience as a pilot has.
apparently, convinced him that the Devil
can be most successfully combated on the
wing, an opinion, by the way, that lias the
backing of no less an authority than John
Milton.
The divorce that will restore N.S.W. Min-
ister for Education Tom Mutch to single
unblessedness is going through quietly. Even
the fact that the respondent is a Minister
of the Crown fails to lift the case out of
the ruck. The lady, who was a widow
when she married Mutch, is proceeding on
grounds of disobedience of an order for resti-
tution of conjugal rights, and there are no
columns of salacious evidence to be dragged
out of such a petition. The matrimonial
affairs of another Minister, although they (lid
not reach the Divorce Court, caused mucli
more perturbation to a former Government.
The Minister’s wife used to make descents
upon his departmental offices and lire off
lurid accusations about her husband and the
typists of his staff. The lady was for ever
threatening to take her suspicions into the
Divorce Court, and the Government, scared
of the effect that might have on the women's
vote, got rid of its awkward colleague. The
retirement was explained by allowing it to
leak out that there were “differences in the
Cabinet.”

A.J.S.: Keep quiet. There’s a magnum
opus hatching W. 8.: Max O’Rell did visit Aus-
tralia ; for further information you had best write
to the paper indicated. .. .Black Magpie: That Phil
May yarn has seen print already. .. .8.W.: The
yarns are very thin. .. .G.J.A.S.: Is “he struck a
match on the seat of his waistcoat” humor?..'..
J.S.H.: Your “’Phone” is cut off. .. .L.A.: Perhaps
unconsciously, it is mere imitative verses. .. .I.O’S.
(W.A.): No great promise; but we’ll be glad to
read the other stuff.... E.W.M.: Sorry, but we can’t
go to sea with you ; your poetic barque is too frail.
... .G. Lay: Always we are unimpressed by the
recommendations of the more or less distinguished
people who “said this poem was very good.” Such
polite lying adds a lot to our troubles. .. .A.F.:
Might make a bright par E.S.P.: “The Cricket
Match” promised interest, but finished indecisively.
.. . .A.8.W.: Reveals nothing new. . . .D.Q. : As a
verse-drover you fail; your mob of words gets out of
control. .. .G.0.M.: The tender touch appealed to us:
But no, she did not spurn him, she sat him down
to tea,
With plates of meat did pile him, that he ate
hungrily;
For well she knew, though blackguard, he was in
his morals halt.
His sin and his baekslidings was not the poor man’s
fault.
She knew his sad heart’s history, it moved her unto
tears,
For he had been an orphan for fifty-seven years.
. ...J.H.: There’s only one known firm in that line,
and the yarn is weighted with 1ibe1.... J.J.W.:
Unfortunately the faults are too many. . . . R.W.K.:
Only, for a crowded table your shy little strangers
might have been invited in. .. .D.P.: Fails....
W.C.P.: Evidently you’ve been studying the archi-
tecture of comic songs... .H.A.: Impossibilities spoil
a fair yarn.... Cam: Trust vour health is better
than your verse about it.... H.1.T.: For one bliss-
ful moment it seemed to read: “The full whiskied
face of the philosopher.” Alas, it was quite a dry
story... .S.T.P.: Mere mass of unamusing confusion.
.. . . J.K.J.: “Then he woke up” is a horrible ending
for even the best told narrative... .Cam S.: Thy
bones are marrowless, thv flesh is cold. .. .T.H.W.:
“Nineteen poems”—you're a wholesaler !... .E.G. :
Afraid it is not improved... .L.P.: The “Geranium”
is not suitable for this garden. May do elsewhe: e.
. ...M.E.0.: Merely a descriptive article decked with
the humor with which the curate amuses an after-
noon tea-party. . . .Davy Jones: Harmless little verse;
it’s being allowed to run around the office without
a chain until called for. .. . J.H.D.: Sounds like the
feeling you get over the nearly-last whisky... .A.D.:
“Spare Our Days.” Spare our blushes ... .N.Y.: Its
impetuosity will not get it into print... .F.W.R.:
“Riders” fall. . . .T.W.D.: Poor stuff... .D.W.C.:
Your apostrophe to Day lacks inspiration... .J.A.L.S.
(Penang): Not suitable ; forwarded as requested....
D.M.G.: The defensive note kills the joyful defiance;
and there are jarring lines. .. .D.R.: Just a tinkle,
nothing more. ~ . E.M.W.: Tripped over its spare
feet and fell downstairs.... E.M.L.: Well:—-
“But now I have repented
For all the sin that’s past;
I’m happy.” So, contented.
The cobbler breathed his last.
A pretty heavy breath that!.... San T. C.: Verse
ambles on the lines of a Chinaman’s jog-trot; but
the Chow does have something in his basket. .. .
A.P.M.: “There were seven men in the yard ; another
10 in the road; 20 all told.” That’s very simple
arithmetic. .. .G.R.L. : Tush; that cynicism is cheap
and untrue. Even the worst of women are not as
bad as some of them are painted. .. .M.G.: Merely
a rhymed chronicle of the dastard deed; but we
liked the line “A-silently a-weeping”. .. . Ehad: “The
Man Outback” has a rough existence in your verses.
S.M.: Blank verse mainly, blanky.... Proteus:
’Tis ill done, Proteus. . ...R.H.M.: Dry as its subject.
. ...G.S.A.: With you the effects of spring are
disastrous. Send the other along; we’ll read it,
anyway... .S.P.R.: The verses have all the soui-
stirring quality of a bill of lading. .. .8.L.: Both
good ideas; but the whole office staff could hang
its hats on the rough points of the verses.... S.C.:
When writing verses like that, why not send the
solution?. ... J.J.8.: “Stripes—likes” is being entered
in the Courageous Rhyme Competition. .. .Robin H.:
That’s an old, whiskered friend.... Ray C.: Yes;
“the yarn is a singular one.” But it’s also puerile.
. ...J.A.0.: Par-value only. .. . V.A.W.: Verse would
be fair if you hadn’t changed gears so often....
T.J.H.: “The Photograph” needs re-touching....
Rizzle: It would surprise you to learn what he
has drawn. It’s all paid for. . . .R.L.: Was trembling
on the balance up to that silly last line. That
pushed it 0ut.... Jim C.: You’re a nice, cheerful
bridegroom:—
Even as beside the altar rails
We stand, love beaming in her eye,
The grief , that maketh life prevails ;
I know that we must shortly die.
....C.L.P.: If it had all been as neat as “If 1
should call for whiskey, I know they’ll bring me
beer” it would have done. .. .C.McD.: The verse about
the condemned man doesn’t hang very well. .. .
A.M.8.: Very labored. .. .K.A.J.: Lacks grip....
W. J.T.: Why give corpse-like attributes to the good
old romantic moon ?. .. . Kahn G.: The elephants
should be boiled down.... A.C.: Try it again. It
opens well, but fades 0ut....C.M.: Tighten up
“Motorist.” The symbolism is not clear... .A.L.G.:
“Metamorphosis”, is good, but too long for our use.

RONISCH and LIPP PLAYER PIANOS
RONISCH GRAND,
The wonderful tone-soul of both Ronisch and Lipp Instru-
ments is just the same in their Player Pianos as has been
the case with their world-famous pianos for many generations.
To have attained a similar high standard with their Player
Pianos may be justly described as a wonderful achievement.
With many types of Player Pianos pianoforte tone is sacri-
ficed for mechanical perfection.
Ronisch and Lipp instruments, however, have achieved the
apparently impossible—the combination of a perfect, rich
piapoforte tone and a perfect Player Piano action.

THEIR TONE IS STILL THE WORLD’S BEST

make for happiness and contentment and the joy of living.
But why allow this distressing, spirit-reducing complaint to hold
sway over you! Why allow yourself to be dejected and despondent

at the nearest Store or Pharmacy you can purchase a bottle of
that renowned Indigestion Remedy:

“Hopalong”: Surely this is a record of
waste even for Bananaland ! Since 1913 the
Rockhampton Harbor Board has spent over
two and a half millions in dredging the
Fitzroy River. The latest soundings show
that the river is now two feet shallower than
it was in 1913!

“Sucre”: The Yngaren from America
brought 16,500 tins of canned tomatoes to
Brisbane the other day. There is no country
:n the world producing better tomatoes than
Queensland, but after finding a market in
Sydney and Melbourne for its choicest
growths, it pitches most of the balance into
the piggery. That’s why the Yanks can sell
their tinned surplus in Brisbane.
* * * #
“Bill R.”: During the long drought just
broken in the Longreach district (Q.),
thousands of sheep were kept alive on maize
scattered from fleets of motor-lorries. For
every ton of Australian-grown maize thus
distributed, hundreds of tons came from S.
Africa. And, notwithstanding the overseas
freight, it was dumped at Longreach at
less than the price of the Australian-grown.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: The motor-lorry is
rapidly ousting the heavy horse-drawn
waggon from the canefields in parts of
Bananaland. In my own district two
seasons back all the sugar was shifted from
plantation to rail by horse-power; this year
in all but two instances the work is being
done by motor. The lorries in general use
are only one-tonners; but they can shift
more of the sweet stick in eight hours than
a team of eight horses can in 10.
* * * *
“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: The exploitation
of the shark for commercial purposes is
nothing new in North Queensland. Forty
years ago there was a fishing-station on
Fraser’s Island, Wide Bay, run by an Eng-
lishman named Short, son of a bishop. The
boss was 6ft. 4in. and red-headed; he had
a couple of white men for assistants and
numerous blacks. They caught sharks, por-
poises and dugong, all of which were treated
for their oil and the skins converted into
leather. The oil was sold for 6s. a gallon to
a Rockhampton chemist, who converted it
into dugong and cod-liver oil. The first lot
of leather was excellent, but when the head
tanner left him and the boss tried his own
hand at it there was a slump in the quality
of the product, and “Lord Short,” as he was
commonly called, sold out. Another English-
man named Ching had a fishing-station on
Fraser’s in 1879-80 for dugong fishing. He
had a properly equipped schooner, boatSj nets,
etc., and for a long time his oil was in brisk
demand. He sent a consignment of shark
skin to England, but with what result I
never heard. The dugong, by the way, makes
excellent bacon, and when properly cured,
rolled and smoked is esteemed by some as
quite equal to the dairy-fed product.
MAGISTRATE : "Where are your witnesses?”
SAFE-BREAKER : “No witnesses, your Honor.
A bloke can’t be too keerful in my line
of business!”
“Kipper” : Being out of work, and having
failed to land any sort of wages-job, I
decided to employ myself as a fruit-hawker
for a week —as has been done by other men
who are now Rolls-Roycing in wealth. Given
fine weather, there’s a crust in it; but each
day has its different tale of luck, and the
business seems to be more of a gamble than
horse-racing. You attend daily, bright and
early, at the municipal fruit-market and buy
a case of one of the more popular fruits—
bananas or oranges, say. If one is careful
and lucky, it is possible to get a 36doz. case
of sound shilling-a-dozen bananas for 255.
If you’re careless or unlucky you may pay
more for a case of inferior fruit and barely
come _ out level on the day. My first case
contained 36d0z., which I sold in a remote
suburb by 5.30 p.m.—l2 hours’ activity for
a gross return of 11s. Next day I sold an
Bs. case of oranges for 16s. gross; and on
the third day about two cases for a pro-
portionate return. My fourth essay went all
right until the wind changed to cool at mid-
day, and the temperamental housewife
stopped buying forthwith. That morning I
had tried a few bunches of asparagus on
the side, and sold them well enough to
gamble on a dozen bunches next day, in
addition to my usual case of fruit. The
singular thing about the asparagus was that
I got rid of all but one bunch within an hour
and a half, and it took me all the rest of
the day to sell the dozenth. On the sixth
day I had an overhang of fruit, owing to
untoward weather conditions, and when I
sold this, after a hard battle, I took breath
and totted up my returns. I had been my
own boss for a week at a healthy job for
a gross profit of about three quid. For a
persistent single bloke or a married out-of-
work whose wife takes in washing, there’s
bread-and-butter in the game; but I can’t
see anybody getting a motor-car out of it.

Here is a description of one of the famous
Edison tone tests in which the 'New
Edison is directly compared with the liv-
ing artist. These tests have been publicly
made in New York, Chicago, Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Perth and other great cities. They
are being continued almost every night in
some part of the world.

Scene—a crowded hall. A New Edison in the centre of the stage,
pleasantly introduced by the concert manager and standing through
the ordeal without a sign of self-consciousness.
Then comes Anna Case, America’s foremost soprano, beloved of a
thousand concert halls. One of her own recordings is put on the
New Edison and Miss Case and the instrument start to sing together.
Then she stops and her other self continues—then together again.
You can see her stop singing—but you cannot hear her stop singing.
At the close—the big scene. Miss Case again begins singing with
the phonograph. At a certain stanza the house is suddenly plunged
in darkness. The song goes on. Everyone in the hall is listening to
detect the second when Anna Case will stop singing and leave the
stage. First they are sure she has gone; then not so sure; she seems
to be back again. All are completely deceived. When the lights
come on there is no Anna—the New Edison is standing and
singing alone.
The audience laughs and applauds one of the most charming and
astonishing recitals they have ever heard.
Isn’t a phonograph capable of sustaining a test like this the one
you want for your home? Will you ever be satisfied with anything
less than realism? Of course not!—for such a phonograph would
be one you would never tire of hearing. Then go to the nearest
Edison dealer—he will let you hear an Official Laboratory Model
capable of sustaining just that test described above.

“D.W.”: The Renmark (S.A.) police
court has just witnessed the curious spec-
tacle of one of its members, who is also
registrar of dogs, prosecuting himself for
having an unlicensed hound. His offence
cost him £2 65., and another Jay Pea, who
pathetically remarked that it was the first
time he had been before a Court, was mulct
in the same amount for a similar offence.
“Kayfin”’: I was an eye-witness of one
extraordinary casualty from anti-aircraft
shrapnel (B. 30/9/'2O). Two infantrymen
standing yarning in a street in Dickebusch
were both killed instantly by two separate
fragments of falling anti-aircraft shell. Surely
a ten-million-to-one chance ! A similar splinter
from the skies merely cost a pal of mine his
boot-heel. We were on horseback at the
time, and the heel was whipped cleanly off
without marking either his foot or the prad.
“Clerk”: Travellers between Melbourne
and Geelong now have the choice of several
’buses, and cut-throat competition assures
them of meteor-like transit. In fact, the
pace along Geelong-road threatens to- pro-
vide a smash one of these days. To lure
passengers back to the railway Clapp has
just equipped his “Geelong Flier” with the
first of a new and larger type of carriage,
which allows more elbow room. But he
hasn’t gone as far yet as one of his road
rivals, who has installed under one of the
seats an organ, which plays throughout the
journey.
“M.C.T.”: The youthful-looking English
M.P., Sir Frank Nelson, brought a very clear
and unaffected diction to garnish his speech
at the Colonial Institute lunch in Sydney
the other day. He was trying, he said, “to
stand up to the overwhelming length and
breadth of Australian hospitality.” He
owned that he was getting into the frame of
mind of an English bishop who, on arriving
on a cold day in a remote English village,
was asked by the rector if he would take a
little refreshment —“even a whisky and
soda.” “I am unable to accept your kind-
ness,” said the bishop, "first because I am
about to officiate at service, secondly because
I am president of the local temperance
society, and thirdly because I have already
had one!”
“Modestine”: Jim is a really helpful chap
at a fire. On the night when our only pub went
up in smoke it was he who had the initiative
and pluck to burst into the flaming bar and
hurl dozens of precious bottles through a
closed window on to the metalled road ! Last
week the local blacksmith’s wife, hurrying
up the mid-day meal with a drop of kero-
sene, gave Jim another chance to show Ins
mettle. The house was past all assistance
when he arrived, so he turned his attention
to the adjoining smithy, a wood and corru-
gated-iron building. Into this Jim dashed
while the crowd held its breath. Presently
he reappeared, liis sandy hair singed, his
face blackened, liis clothes smoking in several
places. His great arms were enfolded about
a heavy object. “I had to save it, he said ;
“it was the poor blankard’s living.” Then
he dropped the anvil among us.
“Avon”: People who claim to have bought
large slices of Maoriland from Maori chiefs
in the days of innocence have provided the
courts of the Empire with years and years
of profitable litigation. A case that was
early settled was William. Charles W ent-
worth’s. Wentworth reckoned he had bought
the whole South Island for £2OO, but un-
fortunately for him lie paid the money to
the wrong chiefs. Another claim, just settled
by a British-American Arbitration tribunal,
is that of William Webster, an American
citizen, who believed he had a title to about
half a million acres of North Island land,
including most of what is now Auckland-
city. Webster brought suit against the Gov-
ernment as soon as there was one —in 1840.
He was backed by his own Government,
and “special reprisals” were at one stage
threatened from Washington unless Webster
was paid £1,314,750. The whole of his
claims have now been rejected.
“Maski”: All the panics of the war
weren’t in the front line. There was an
officers’ school at Kandahar Barracks, Tid-
worth (Eng.). One day in 1917 a class of
over 50 officers was being instructed in
modern bombing. A number of Mills bombs,
cut into sections, without detonators or ex-
plosive, were handed round for inspection,
when suddenly one three-pip artist released
a lever by accident. The hammer struck
the cap composition, setting fire to the fuse,
which burnt noisily, and the holder promptly
dropped it. I shall never forget the stam-
pede that followed. There was a rush for
every possible exit. Many leaped for the
nearest one; one officer actually jumped
through a shut window and was severely
cut by the broken glass. Others hid behind
barricades hastily made of forms. It was
a shamefaced class that came trooping back
to the lecture-hall as soon as it was realised
that the bomb was a dud. There were many
men wearing decorations for bravery among
the stampeders, but obviously they didn’t
want to die that way. I was the lecturer and
saw it all, because I couldn’t have escaped
even had I wanted to.
“Flor di Toofer”: There is an odor of
boiled cabbage about an evening-press yarn
which tells of an unknown Australian soldier
dying in humble lodgings in London, pos-
sessed of a large sum of money which he
desired to leave to his relatives in Australia.
The letter, written by an ostensible resident
of London, came to the address of a Sydney
woman ; the identity of the wealthy indivi-
dual was not disclosed, but aid in identify-
ing the relatives was asked for. It all
seems a variation of the “Spanish Prisoner”
swindle which lightened a good many pockets
30 years or so ago. When a reply was
received from the mug, a follow-up letter
would come, intimating that the dying
prisoner was prepared to leave the secret of
his vast treasure with his beautiful daughter.
As soon as the mug sent to a Spanish address
the money for her passage to England
the lovely girl would arrive and reveal the
whereabouts of the cash. The girl and the
gold, with minor variations, were a killing
bait for young Johnny Bull in the 1890’s.
Evidently the same old brand of smoke is
being served up for Australian consumption,
with a new box and label.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
since that sunset (ah, so hoary,
i Though the rose-flush of a child-
dream lights its head !)
When a naked man and woman watched the
glory
From a headland where the sea was darkly
spread,
And saw the low, gold islands, far extended
To the limits of the purple water-plain,
And knew —without word spoken—that the
splendid
vjreat-maned lion never slew there, nor
the rain
Fast bitter flights of javelins, nor winds
shivered,
But. tin* faery apples hung, and magic deer
Yielded up their milk, and golden leafage
quivered,
Put aside by those who had forgotten fear,
\Ye have stood upon our life's extremert
verges,
Our faces to the lovely, deathless West:
Before our feet the dark, destroying surges,
And the wonder and the pain within our
breast.
Hy-Brazil beckons, and the Blessed Islands —
Oh, the first sea-voyagers sought for Para-
dise !
And heroes clomb the holy, death-white high-
lands,
Seeking God-home by the staircases of ice.
Where the desert flows like flame and has no
pity
W e have heard the chime of silver sunset
bells ;
W r e have glimpsed the sacred, never-entered
city,
Pale as porcelain, with its palms above
its wells.
Or it may be just the dusty, westering
shimmer
Where a little road goes sunward o’er the
hill.
We are certain that the Vales of Honey
glimmer
On and over, could we follow at our will.
But the first ships only found new coasts of
danger;
Eldorado lifted up no golden dome;
And a King was coldly cradled in a manger,
And Hell and Heaven brought Ulysses
home!
No sea-gulfs bar us from the sands of Thule,
W here the low tides break in music at our
feet,
And by the tide-lip, gentle, pacing duly,
Come the harmless leopards, tawny as the
wheat.
For near and far are met. The weary dis-
tance
Measured out with graves was but a circle-
quest ;
I bore with me the Grail of all existence —
I, myself, the yearning East, the sceptred

DULCIE DEAMER.
The P earls of Gungadool.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OT-fD Bon loaned by the hut door, enjoy-
ing the evening peace. The man
suited the country. With a comfort-
ably-built waistline, his face shone big and
round and jovial. Good humor twinkled from
the shrewd grey eyes that loved the scene
around. It seemed fitting that a shock of
white hair should crown that ruddy face and
that the strength of youth should flow in
the well-knit body.
Old Ben swore he was rich, for he pos-
sessed everything lie wished. Within the
strongly-built hut the storeroom was heavy
with twelve months’ supplies. The living-
rooms smelled fresh and clean. The walls
were hung with enormous buffalo-horns, each
trophy reminding Old Ben of some thrilling
exploit. The rifle rack gleamed with care-
fully-oiled weapons, and ammunition-cases
were plentiful. What looked like neatly-
folded rugs on Ben’s bunk were furs that
would have been a glory in any show window.
Outside were the outhouses, stored with
buffalo-hides and salted meat. From the
grassy plain behind the mangroves came the
tinkle of horse-bells.
The nestling sun enlivened the hilltops and
glared the waters of many a lagoon and
played queer tracery designs upon the looping
jungle vines. Enhancing this strip of the
Territory coast are many islands of irregular
shape and lovely vegetation. Old Ben was
the one white man in hundreds of miles of
country. He held undisputed sway—he and
Gungadool.
Along the beach tumbled laughing picca-
ninnies, as naked as their smiling mothers.
The youngsters halted a few yards away ana
challenged Ben to catch them. He winked
prodigiously, and their laughing shrieks
played musically across the bay. But the
gamest youngster dared not enter the hut,
even though now was the time “Bin” had
appointed for the distribution of damper.
And so Ben treated the elders, who were
also children, but dangerous. Thus far
and no farther. Liking and respect, tinged
with fear.
Only thus had Old Ben lived long and
heartily among these savages, in whose blood
was the fighting spirit of the Macassar proa
men.
Later, in the cool of the night, the door
opened and noiselessly shut. Old Ben merely
nodded to the savage who had squatted by
the fire. It was Gungadool, a heathen who
by sheer mentality held in awed terror a
country bigger than Tasmania. By reason
of his friendship with this man, Old Ben
did his work in peace.
“Cutter come soon. Leave Thursday
Island. The deep voice boomed within the
hut.
Ben sat down, handed Gungadool tobacco
and lit his own pipe. “You see him’” he
queried.
“Yah!”
And Ben knew he was experiencing vet
another instance of native telepathy, for'no
news had yet reached camp of a cutter
cruising along the coast.
“Kangaroo-rat man,” boomed the voice.
“No. good!”
And Ben understood that the stranger
would be a weedy man and, from the native
point of view, undesirable.
“He seeks the weeping stones of the sea,”
growled Gungadool. “He will steal them, if
he cannot buy. He must not take the stones.
They are mine. They are charmed. The
voice of the sea whispers through them, and
sings to me. The kiss of the sea is upon
them ; I love them as a warrior loves a maid.”
“What makes you certain The Hat knows
you have the stones?” asked Ben quietly.
“Budgaree told, and the stones whispered
to me. When Budgaree comes back his feet
shall go in the fire, so that he shall never
walk again.”
The men smoked silently. Ben knew his
aid was being asked under the unspoken pact
between them.
“I expect you can fix the trouble yourself,
Gungadool,” he said. “But you can call on
me for whatever help you wish. Only don't
kill.”
Three weeks later distant signal smoke told
the natives of the arrival of a ship; and two
days afterwards she anchored in the road-
stead. Old Ben waited, for he knew that The
Bat’s dinghy would visit him. He shook
hands and was pained to think that he must
regard the first white visitor in eight months
as an enemy.
“Surprised to have a visitor in this lonely
paradise?” laughed The Rat.
“Not at all,” smiled Ben. “I expected you.”
The Rat was staggered. “Nonsense!” he
replied sharply. “Not a soul knew, and not
a boat passed me on the way.”
“Yet I knew,” said Ben, “and so did Gunga
dool.”
“He’s here, then?” whispered The Rat
eagerly.
“Yes,” said Ben. “Now listen, just for
your own benefit. Gungadool told me three
weeks ago of your leaving Thursday Island-
arid told me why.”
“AVhy?” snapped The Rat.
“The pearls,” said Ben slowly.
The Rat breathed deeply.
“By God,” he sighed at last. “That’s
wonderful. Not a soul but myself and a
nigger, Budgaree, knew where I was going
or why. You have seen them, then—the
pearls?” he asked eagerly.
“No,” answered Ben, “I did not even know T
of their existence until three weeks ago.”
The Rat stared at the honest face, but he
believed nothing. As if coming to a sudden
decision he placed a hand on Old Ben’s knee.
“Listen!” he said earnestly, “I’ll take
your word. I’ll tell you all I know. If
Budgaree’s description is true, these pearls
must be worth thousands. He tells me that
years ago the tribe skittled a Malay pearler
and dished the entire crew. Gungadool's
share of the spoil was a bottle of pearls,
which the niggers, of course, valued less
than a chew of tobacco. In old days the
shell beds were very rich and easily worked,
and those pearls may have represented a
nine months’ cruise, perhaps more. The way
Budgaree describes their size and number
just gives me palpitations. He told me the
tale on condition that I’d ship him back to
the tribe. He’s been away three years and
couldn’t get a return boat. But the nearer
w T e got to the blasted coast the more cold-
footed he got. Now he’s trussed like a fowl
in the hold. I would have stripped his hide
properly if he’d lied to me.”
“Seems to me lie's in between two fires,”
said Ben grimly.
“AVhy?” asked The Rat.
“Because Gungadool promises to burn his
feet off.”
“Why?”
“Because he told you of the pearls.”
The Rat stared.
“Telepathy,” said Old Ben simply. “I
assure you Gungadool knows everything
about you. You've got no earthly hope
of getting those pearls.”
“You won’t come in with me?” said The
Rat slowly.
“No,” answered Old Ben definitely, “and
I warn you most solemnly, as white man to
white man, not to make the attempt.”
“Sure you don’t want the sea stones for
yourself?” questioned The Rat craftily.
“They would be useless to me,” replied
Ben simply. “My life is here. lam con-
tented. To fall foul of the natives would
end me.”
“But,” said The Rat in exasperation,
“couldn't I buy them? I've brought plenty of
stores.”
Ben slowly shook his head. “You’re dead
unlucky,” he said quietly. “I don’t blame
you for seeking the pearls, but to Gungadool
they are above all riches. He believes them
charmed. And my witch-doctor would sacri-
fice his life before he would give up his
charms. Take my advice. It represents
forty years’ experience. Give it up.”
The Rat rose. The glint in his steel-grey
eyes made his smile appear wry.
“No white man has ever bested me,” he
said quietly, “and no nigger is going to.”
At dawn a skiff left the cutter and touched
the beach just below Old Ben’s hut. The Rat
fastened the boat, then contemptuously
kicked a nigger crouched in the bows.
“Tumble out,” he growled. “Quick feller.
Take me where him Gungadool camp. Quick
feller now!”
The Rat tugged at a lashing and Bud-
garee staggered upright, eyes distorted with
fear. The native jumped as a revolver
muzzle screwed between his naked ribs. He
stepped off through the mangroves, The Rat,
wmlking behind, grasping the lashing which
bound the aboriginal’s arms. So they came
out on to the forest country.
Miles away there jutted hills red-faced
with cliffs, and in between splashed patches
of green where the slanting rays kissed the
grass. Three miles ahead stretched a sombre
line of jungle, and Budgaree made for this.
Once he appealed with streaming cheeks,
but The Rat savaged his head with the revol-
ver butt. Budgaree stumbled on so over-
come between fears of the white devil and
the black that his brain reeled.
A short hour brought them to the jungle.
Its gloom enveloped them, and hushed their
feet on the leafy carpet. Budgaree whined,
otherwise there was silence save for the
coo of unseen pigeons. The Rat’s temper
did not improve as he cut aside the vines
that entangled the bound Budgaree.
At last the screech of cockatoos foretold

Kidney disease often advances so rapidly that many
a person is firmly in its grasp before aware of its
progress. Prompt attention should be given to the
slightest symptom of kidney disorder. If there is a dull pain in the back, headache, dizzy spells, or a
tired, worn-out feeling, or if the kidney secretions are irregular and attended by pain, procure a good
kidney remedy at once. Sydney people recommend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Read these
statements: —
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. Pullbrook, Senr., No. 342 King Street. St. Peters,
Svdney, says: “For six or seven years I was troubled with
weak and disordered kidneys. The chief symptom was back-
ache, and the pain I suffered was awful. When I stooped the
agony in standing up again was almost unbearable, and I often
had to get someone to help me. Nothing I took seemed to
relieve the pain, and I used to wonder if I would ever be well
again. One day I was urged by a friend to try Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and it was a real friend’s advice, for a few
bottles completely cured me. My experience proves that Doan’s
Backache Kidney. Pills, are a genuine remedy, and I sincerely
trust that other sufferers will benefit by my experience and take
these splendid pills.”
Twelve years later Mrs. rullbrook says: “I am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and would not
like to be without them. They are invaluable to the kidney
sufferer.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. Thomas Duggan, No. 99 Connell’s Point Road, Hurst-
ville, Sydney, says: “I am pleased to tell you that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have done me the world of good. For
a long time I was so ill with backache and kidney trouble
that I was almost a cripple, not being able to move without
enduring positive torture. My limbs swelled very much, show-
ing serious signs of dropsy, and this worried me a good deal.
I tried all kinds of remedies, but they did not benefit me, and
I was fast losing hope of a cure. One day I happened to hear
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were a splendid remedy
for all kidney ailments, so I got some at once. After taking
them for about a week I began to feel better, and as I per-
severed a steady improvement was noticeable, twelve bottles of
these grand pills fixing me up completely.”
Four years later Mr. Duggan says: “I have had no return
of backache and kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured me
over four years ago.”

the lightening of the gloom. The jungle
clung "to a swamp edge. Interlaced with
creepers towered giants' of weeping fig. Un-
seen water-fowl fluted with a birds' babel
of sound. The Rat gripped the lashing.
“Looks like the Devil’s bathing-pool,
Budgaree,” he grinned ; “but if you’ve brought
me here to get drowned, you’re coming, too.
Go ahead !”
. To the black man’s appealing lips The Rat
screwed the revolver muzzle. Budgaree
gasped and slipped into the water.
It was a slow wade from islet to islet,
with water to the waist. . The Rat could see
only twenty yards ahead, for tasselled
grass clumps waved above a man’s height.
His heart leapt. In an islet enshrouded
by pandanus palms,-there nestled a solitary
dome-shaped gunyali. The Rat forced a
path through the lotus-lilies and clambered
up the bank, his breath halting at the rustle
of leaves. He sprang forward and thrust
his revolver through the gunyali opening.
Utter silence; only his heart thumping.
He drew back and allowed the weak light
to filter into the gunyah. But nothing was
to be seen there save Gungadool’s charm-
bag. The Rat snatched the smoke-grimed
bag and upended it*. Out rolled a medley of
quartz crystals, lumps of ochre, human
knuckle bones, the dried claws of animals, a
short cylinder of bamboo and what looked
like a similar cylinder wrapped tightly in
paper-bark fibre.
The Rat thrust his hand into the bag
and withdrew something. Shuddering
slightly, he dropped the smoke-dried hand
of a child. Hurriedly he untwisted the
bamboo cylinder. Inside was a long, needle-
pointed bone. He threw the dreaded death-
bone aside with scorn, and undid the paper-
bark wrappings. His eyes bulged at the
sight of glass. He scrambled from the gun-
yah, tore off the wrapper, and howled like
a maniac. He had glimpsed the bottle of
pearls ! He hugged the treasure and danced,
as mad as any savage. The sharp crackling
of pandanus leaves was the only accompani-
ment to his song. He looked round. Bud-
garee was gone! No matter —damn Bud-
garee ; he had the pearls!
Thankful for a sailor’s training, he re-
entered the swamp, steering a course for the
coast by compass, and wading fast. His
main dread was that he might not get
through the jungle before sunset.
At length he splashed from the swamp
edge, took a careful bearing, then plunged
into the jungle. He would have run had
such speed been possible. He must keep a
cool head as to his course, though the farther
he penetrated the gloom the oftener lie
glanced behind. How easily they could spike
him now! What if Gungadool were track-
ing him?
The Rat cursed. He felt sure a panther
tread was behind. To have gone under in
securing the pearls would have been all in
the game. Now that he really possessed
them, death wore a very different aspect. He
scurried on, rather heavier of breath, ears,
eyes and muscles astrain, but forcing his
mind to make him steer the straightest pos-
sible course.
At last lie emerged into the open forest
and sighed with relief at the glorious strength
of the sun. It was late afternoon, but in
the jungle all had been twilight. He broke
into a steady run and the free air against his
mouth tasted like an elixir of life;
Near the mangroves he smelt the tang of
the sea and laughed a welcome. He dared
not waste time examining his booty. He
would gloat over the pearls in the cabin
when the cutter was under way. The sun
was a fast sinking copper disc as he cleared
the mangroves.
The dinghy was not a quarter-mile away,
floating inshore with the tide. Strange that
it had broken away, but lucky! He ran
along the crinkly beach, thanking Omnipo-
tence for so many favors. The dinghy
floated in barely two feet of water, slowly
drawing inshore.
The Rat untied his boots, lie was fas-
tidious and hated boots full of mud, with
his toes squelching inside. He waded out
laughing to himself. He reached out for the
dinghy—and went down quite suddenly and
noiselessly, as if his feet had sunk in a
depth of paste. He tried to spring back,
but the movement loosened the mass be-
neath, and he had a sense of seasickness.
The mud gripped his knees. He felt it
squeezing through his clawing toes.
He knew what had happened. On portions
of the Territory coast are patches of quick-
sand, a pale-blue mud, line as sifted flour,
of unknown depth and irresistible. lie
struggled and the mud quaked in a caressing
grip towards his thisrhs. Half sobbing, he
nung his body straight out. He must not
lose his head even if all the rest went down.
A canoe shot out from the mangroves, and
a shout died in The Rat’s throat. Budgerce
was paddling, and the big nigger with the
bloodshot eyes must be Gungadool. The
Rat thrust the bottle under water and felt
icy sick as the mud crept above his thighs.
He strained his head above water.
The natives watched silently. The Rat
sought their eyes and knew that entreaty
was useless. He took a great breath and
roared a prolonged shout straight out over
the water. It had to be a steady shout, for
even with the expansion of his lungs he felt
the mud grip tighter. He shouted again and
yet again.
The mud had slid its warm arms around
his stomach before Old Ben, with all the
tribe running behind him, came galloping
along the beach. He harangued Gungadool,
then shouted to the sickly-smiling Rat.
“The game is up, old chap. Hand the
pearls over, and agree to give Gungadool half
the supplies on your cutter. It is the small-
est price I can get for your life, and time is
very short.”
The Rat reached up the bottle to the dark-
ening sky. “I will take it with me then,” he
snarled.
“Don’t be an ass,” called Ben. “Don’t
you understand lam utterly helpless? Why,
I couldn’t even reach you in time, no matter
how I tried. You are euchred. In half an
hour the mangrove worms will begin boring
your flesh? And make no mistake, those
natives will have the pearls just the same.”
The Rat’s neck was kinking. He opened
his mouth in defiance, but a splutter of salt
water slipped between his lips. He nodded
surrender.
I. L. IDRIESS.
Triumph.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
sunset shed its glory of purple,
gold and crimson over the desert. A
slight breeze stirred gently over
the sandhills, and the fierce heat was
gone, though the air was still warm and
sensuous. Peter Lamont could not help
contrasting the quiet of nature With the fury
of the mob which yelled and gesticulated
around them. All through the hot, clammy
day they had ridden under the blistering
blaze of the sun, over mile after mile of
burning sand that billowed about the horses’
feet, sand that rose with the wind and filled
the air until the sky was a yellow blur; sand
that lashed the skin like burning cinders,
filling ears and eyes and mouth until one
suffocated. For days they had faced that
fiery rain and burning wind, toiling on
through all the hardships of that restless
sea of yellow sand, only to stumble on to
disaster just when there seemed every hope
of finishing the journey with success.
•‘We were fools!” Peter muttered despair-
ingly, as with a hand that, in spite of him-
self, was far from steady, he swept the damp
air from his brow. “Fools to laugh at that
warning of the commandant back at Ben-
Ounif!” Then at Eldad, he reflected, their
reception at the hands of the greasy-faced
fanatics should have convinced them. He
remembered how they had drawn their burn-
ouses closer to avoid contamination, and spat
upon the ground to express their contempt,
muttering curses upon the unbelievers. It
was easy to smile at the time ; but he ought
to have remembered that they were beyond
the outposts of civilisation, where the utmost
precaution was necessary.
His eye swept the mob of white-robed
figures surrounding them —howling fanatics
whose shrill cries of “Allah ! Allah! There
is no God but Allah!” echoed strangely in
that serene hush which enfolds the desert
at the close of the day.
Peter was no coward, but the contempla-
tion of death at the hands of a fanatical mob
of Moslem brigands filled him with peculiar
horror it was so useless.
He turned again towards his companion.
What he saw caused him to catch his
breath sharply, while a gleam of admiration
shot into his eyes.
“So must the martyrs of old have stood,
he murmured —“oblivious to everything but
the glory of the ‘cause.’ ” Then, after a
moment —“Fanatics, all of them. Persecutor
and persecuted, both driven by a religious
frenzy-.”
He began to reflect that possibly had Ins
companion been any other than Father 1 aul
this disaster might have been averted: no-
thing incited the fury of these Moors more
than the sight of a priest,, flaunting the
insignia of the accursed unbeliever. To have
stumbled into the middle of their devotions
at the setting of the sun was the crowning
misfortune of all and eliminated all hope of
escape.
Just then, Father Paul’s ecstatic glance
caught his eye. “Death is but a little thing,
my son.” the priest called out triumphantly
above the hideous yells of the mob.
Peter moistened bis parched lips with his
tongue. Unfortunately for him, death did
not appear a little thing, especially such a
futile death as this. It was different for
Father Paul —he was making the supreme
sacrifice for that which he held dearer than
life itself. Such a death meant the con-
summation of his holiest aspirations—the
crown of all his desires. But to Peter no
religion had ever meant very much. Allah
and Christ and Buddha were all the same as
far as he was concerned: Yet, because of the
religious views of his countrymen, his body
would soon be fouling the white sand of the
desert. To have given his life in the war,
fighting for the defence and freedom of his
nation, would have been worth while, but
this
He shuddered as the shots rang out. It
would be his turn next. Unconsciously Ins
hand tightened upon the cross Father Paul
had slipped into his hand when the furious
Moors had first surrounded them. He
stared down at the symbol. Father I aul
had died for this—and he was to die because
of this; but not willingly as I ather
Paul had done.
An idea suddenly flashed through Ins mind.
He had heard tales of prisoners who had
embraced the Moslem faith and saved their
lives. What was the Cross to him? A
symbol of superstition ! He would cast it
to the ground, renounce it, trample it into
the dust, spit upon it —any damn thing to
satisfy their hatred of it. Why not? It
meant nothing to him: it would be renounc-
ing nothing; for he had professed nothing,
lie would not throw away his life for the
sake of a superstition. It was a chance
worth taking.
They were turning toward him now: there
was no time to be lost.
He raised the Cross high before the ring
of dark faces surrounding him. Something
strange'in his attitude held them back: they
paused, their rifles levelled upon him, while
for a brief space their cries died into silence.
His hands were trembling, his bloodshot
eyes fixed upon the Cross. A symbol of super-
stition ! .
Suddenly it seemed to expaiid before his
eyes and turn crimson, and lie was gazing
upon the central cross in Britain’s flag—the
flag for which lie had risked death a hundred
times. Wherever Britain’s flag waved its
freedom on the wind, there was the Cross:
wherever civilisation reared its head, there
was the Cross!
He drew his breath sharply, and cast
another glance at the white-robed Moors.
It. would be the triumph of a century to
these barbarous tribes should he, a Briton,
cast the hated Cross into the dust —a triumph
that would be recounted in a thousand camps
and villages from end to end of Africa. It
would smirch his country witli disgrace, it
would be casting the honor and glory of
Britain at the feet of a howling mob of
uncivilised fanatics. They seemed to have
divined his purpose and were waiting.
The Cross was suspended high in the air
ready to be cast to the ground. A serene
smile lighted up his. face as, instead, he
drew it down to his lips....
Frenzied yells, a resounding volley, and
the desert’s swift night dropped its curtain.
