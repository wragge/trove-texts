FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth Is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers, These
attributes are possessed only by ihe daily
newspapers whose circulation!; are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in • their
homes. '
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times ot
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective arid forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Queensland, as a market, Is therefore
its 950,000 people, collected in fami-
lies throughout the State.
It would seem a difficult task to
find a common bond between all the
varied interests of these people
a market-place where mer-
chant and client, may meet.
Yet there is such a market place
. . there is a common bond be-
tween all the varied interests . . .
the daily newspaper.
Through it 70U can reach the fami-
lies . . . the 950,000 people that
make up the Queensland market.
A market, too, that has thrown off
the throes of depression and is now
well advanced along the road to
orosperity.
Deliver your advertising messages
into the homes of these people, and
you will find a ready response. Let
The Courier-Mail carry the story
of your merchandise into more than
62,000 homes throughout Queens-

Make the columns of The Courier-

No other Queensland newspaper—

HIS BOOKS
Books About Sport
London publishers, bemused by the
feats of Lindrum, Bradman, Crawford
and similar specialists, visualise Aus-
tralia as a country where practically
everybody engages in all kinds of sport
all the year round. Hence their custom
of bombarding the Commonwealth with
books on every conceivable game and
pastime. The following arrived at The
Bulletin office this month:
High Days and Bye Days, by Ralph
Greaves (Philip Allan; 12s. 6d.).
Fifty Years on the Test, by C. Ernest
Pain (Philip Allan; 10s. 6d.).
Thrilling the Million, by Tom Stenner
(John Miles: Robertson and Mullens;
3s. 9d.).
Better Tennis, by Hazel Hotchkiss
Wightman (Allen and Unwin; 55.).
P. F. Warner’s Book of Cricket (Dent;
7s. 6d.).
There were also books about otter-hunt-
ing and covert-shooting.
Non-Australian Sports
Fox-hunting, as described in Mr.
Greaves’s biography of James Cockayne,
is unknown here. Cockayne began his
career 60 years ago as second horseman
with the Pytchley, and he spent several
years near Vienna with the owner of a
private pack. But his best work was done
in the cramped country round London,
much of which is now built over and
intersected by concrete roads and by-
passes. Cockayne joined the staff of the
Essex as first whip in 1886 (clay and
plough country, with banks and ditches,
calling for horses that jump well off their
hocks); and he got his first job as
huntsman with the Old Surrey six years
later.
Any modern who has been to Brighton
by train or car can picture the
Old Surrey country as it must have been
in Cockayne’s day—hilly, clayey, small
fields, and plenty of woodland— though
from Croydon, round by Purley, to
Reigate, it is now a succession of villas,
shops, public institutions and golf
courses. The writer had half a season
with a Surrey drag while living in
London seven years ago, and found that
hounds travelled there at about half the
pace of the departed Sydney drag-
hounds. Hunting is still a rite and a
science in England; and in the home
counties galloping is not merely discoun-
tenanced, it is virtually impossible. The
sport was taken still more seriously in
Cockayne’s youth. The object was to see
hounds work rather than to have an
exciting ride, and many were able and
perfectly content to follow all day with-
out jumping a fence.
Cockayne left Surrey for the Puck-
eridge (Essex-Herts), and he also served
for a time in Kilkenny under the master-
ship of the American polo player Isaac
Bell. When this fine horseman and
kennelmaster retired he had, to quote
his biographer, “in fifty seasons hardly
missed a day with hounds.”
Dry-fly fishing is another sport which
is not followed here in accordance with
British practice. We have no rivers like
the Test, with its clear, spring-fed water,
its gravel bottom and its almost unvary-
ing depth and temperature.
Trout-fishing in Victoria, Tasmania
and on the Monaro more approxi-
mates to Scottish sea-trout fishing—
an art, of course, but not nearly such
a fine one as dry-fly fishing on still,
shallow rivers where the prey has to be
skilfully stalked. About half this book
deals with “Stocking,” “Weeds” and
other subjects of little or no Australian
significance, yet it should delight all true
fishermen. There are eight illustrations,
and a foreword by H. Plunkett Greene.
Where We Shine
“It was Australia,” says Tom Stennef,
the sporting authority of London “Daily
Mail,” in Thrilling the Million, “who
gave us speedway racing as we know it
to-day.” England’s first speedway meet-
ing was staged at High Beech, east of
London, in 1928. It caught on at once.
Earl Beatty said after his first visit to
a London track:
“I have had two
thrills to-day.
One, racing at
Newmarket; the
other, here at the
speedway. And
this is by far the greater.” There is no
betting at speedway meetings, yet,
according to a London cable of the 10th
of this month,
Forty thousand spectators witnessed the
third speedway Test at Wimbledon
Stadium last night when Australia won by
54 points to 51.
Australia lost the second Test through
Vic. Huxley, of Brisbane, being ridden
into the fence. Mr. Stenner writes of
him:
Victor Nelson Huxley is the greatest
speedway rider the world has known. In
Test matches he is supreme. His total
of 1864 points in the series is head and
shoulders above that of any other rider.
Ron Johnson, of Perth (W.A.), who is
also a champion and who is described
as “one of London’s chief thrill-pro-
viders,” had scored only 75 points in 18
England v. Australia contests at this
time.
Speedway racing has spread to every
country in Europe except Sweden, where
it is banned as dangerous. There are
several Soviet-controlled tracks in
Russia, and Spain has sent a useful
speedway team to England. Jack Parker
(125 points) is probably England’s best.
Though England doesn’t excel in indivi-
dual performances, it had scored 1047}
points to Australia’s 948} in Tests when
this book was published.
Mrs. Wightman won three national
tennis titles at Philadelphia when she was
Miss Hotchkiss in 1908. She has played
since with every woman champion from
Helen Wills, who, as a pigtailed school-
girl, caught her eye on the Berkeley Club
courts in 1920, to Suzanne Lenglen, whom
she met in England four years later.
She and Sarah Palfrey won the ladies’
indoor national (U.S.A.) championships
four years in succession from 1924 on,
and she and Helen Wills were the
American doubles champions of 1924.
Coaching children has been one of her
hobbies for many years, and she now
has five of her own to coach. So she
is fully equipped to write Part II of her
book—“ How to Develop a Good Game.”
She offers most of the advice which has
been given in writing by other cham-
pions ; and an appendix contains “Points
to Remember,” “Slogans and Maxims”
( e.g “Make excuses for others, never
for yourself”) and the rules.
Each edition of Mr. Warner’s 23-year-
old classic is virtually a new book. This
one, though it goes back 40 years, con-
tains appraisements of all the leading
cricketers of to-day, based on last year’s
form. He classes Bradman as the world’s
best bat, with Hammond close up ; and
he thinks Kortright, at his fastest, “was
just a shade faster than anyone else.”
Larwood leads in ball-control. Body-
line is discussed in an appendix. It was
first exploited in. England by W, B.
Burns 24 years ago.
Burns, like Larwood, placed seven men
on the leg-side—six of them in the short-
leg area; but this form of attack met with
instant disapproval and was not per-
sisted in.
Mr. Warner’s charm lies in the goodwill
which permeates all his writings; and
he has a judicial mind. He is stodgy by
comparison with Jardine, the dour
special pleader; Constantine, the merry
debunker ; Mai ley, a wit and a natural
writer; but his book gives more solid,
reliable information and criticism than
all theirs put together.
The Prince is reported to have said
at the Lucifer Society’s dinner a few
nights ago that when a man got too
old for golf it was time for him to die.
These books suggest an alternative. A
good sportsman is never too old to get
pleasure from reading about sport.

A Misunderstood Poet
Adam Lindsay Gordon (Hutchinson;
Robertson and Mullens ; 75.), by Douglas
Sladen. In Australia the poet was the
prey of people who took his horse verse
for poetry and his propensity for versi-

Indigestion
Sufferers
:
■
Here is
New Hope
Be warned in time. You dare not
neglect even the slightest symptoms
of indigestion. The slight pains of
to-day may become the tragic health
breakdown of to-morrow.
When we tell you De Witt’s Antacid
Powder, the quick-action, new-principle
remedy, will give you immediate relief,
we wish we could show you the host of
wonderful letters from one-time martyrs
who say how quickly and surely this
new-principle remedy for Indigestion
has benefited them. You would not
stay a day longer waiting for “slight
indigestion ” to wreck your health.
RELIEF—SURE AND QUICK
Here are just three letters from men
and women grateful for indigestion
misery gone, thanks to De Witt’s
Antacid Powder. Read these carefully,
then decide if you will stay in danger
longer.
Acute Indigestion.
My whole digestive system was out of
order, due to having to get up from meals
to serve in the shop. At night I could get
no rest, and the shocking burning pain in
my stomach prevented me from sleeping.
Since taking De Witt's Antacid Powder
I have obtained complete relief. I cannot
speak too highly of it.—No. 196,
Sour Stomach Relieved.
It was my unfortunate lot to suffer from
sour stomach for many years. Soon after
eating-, my mouth would suddenly fill with
a nasty-tasting sour fluid, and nothing I
ever tried did more than lessen the sour-
ness, and the fluid continued to rise from
the stomach. De Witt’s Antacid'Powder
has altered all this. I will never be with-
out it.—No. 168.
Dyspepsia Relieved.
I was on special diet for a long time, but
excepting for short periods, my trouble
would keep on recurring. At times I have
nearly starved myself for days at a time,
until I became so weak I could scarcely
walk, then after the first real meal I would
be as bad as ever. De Witt’s Antacid
Powder has altered all that, and I cannot
speak too highly of it.— No. 180.
De Witt’s Antacid Powder for Indi-
gestion is indeed wonderful. Where
operation has been advised, where the
sufferers have been laid aside in hos-
pital, where everything has been tried
without results, this new remedy has
given glorious relief from awful pain
and built sound digestion once again.
Try this new-principle remedy now.
It is invaluable in all cases of
Sour Acid Stomach, Palpitation,
Flatulence, Heartburn, Burning,
Griping Pains.
Do not allow neglected indigestion to
lead you to a state of chronic stomach
ulceration or gastritis. Go to your
chemist now and get a supply of
Dewitts
ANTACID POWDER
For INDIGESTION. Price 2/6
Sold in handsome canisters con-
taining average month’s supply. Be
sure you get the genuine remedy,
prepared by the well-known house
“ De Witt’s,” which has supplied medi-
cinal remedies to the public for 50 years.
He met only three people who might
have helped him. The first was Father
Tenison Woods, a scholarly Catholic
priest, who was amazed at Gordon’s
classical knowledge. He gave the poet
the freedom of an excellent library, and
also introduced him to Browning,' but
Gordon was as shy of talking about
poetry as he was of versifying about
women. In Melbourne later he met
Marcus Clarke, a “very nice young
fellow,” and Henry Kendall, whose
poetry he liked, but of whose judgment
he had “no great opinion.”
Gordon’s one brief effort to direct the
destinies of his adopted country satisfied
him that the company of the most blas-
phemous stable lad or taciturn bushman
was preferable to that of the grave and
reverend seigneurs of the Parliament in
Adelaide. He attended nine debates, and
then sent in his resignation. He married a
working lass who does not seem to have
interested him, and their only offspring
died in childhood. For the rest his com-
panions were largely professional and
amateur jockeys and trainers, who re-
garded his steeplechasing prowess as his
most important attribute and his poetic
aspirations as merely an added charm
and mystery.
What was the key to Gordon’s ever-
lasting self-pitying, his brooding on sui :
cide and his passion for taking chances?
It lay, in my opinion, well back in his
boyhood days in England. He was ex-
tremely self-consckVus; couldn’t acquit
himself with the girls, envied those who
could and copied their methods. This
made him one of the finest horsemen
and the best boxer in the district. More-
over, it was all in accordance with his
conditioning as a member of an aris-
tocratic class and clan, famous for its
hard riding, drinking, swearing and fight-
ing. But it was hardly likely long to
satisfy a poet, and it is significant that his
wildness disappeared in Australia. It is
also generally forgotten that his horse-
riding in Australia was mainly done in
a professional capacity, in order to earn
a living. I doubt if he really loved the
horse. His verse says so but his letters
contradict it.
There was something beautiful in
Gordon which was striving to get out.
There are hints of it in his better poems,
which are contradictions of the senti-
ments contained in his worst ones. But
he lacked guidance or the right encour-
agement. So he tried writing lyric verse
like Swinburne and philosophic verse
like Browning. But his earlier condi-
tioning was against him. He could not
make up his mind what he wanted, so
his thoughts turned inwards in gloomy
self-depreciation and brooding on sui-
cide. No doubt his ill-health added to
this sense of frustration.
It is one of the melancholy curiosities
of literary history that a man who was
filled with perpetual nostalgia, who dis-
liked the necessity for earning his living
by horsemanship, and who finally
accepted defeat from life should be
regarded as the national poet of Aus-
tralia, the panegyrist of the horse and the
laureate of bodily and moral courage.
Mr. Sladen’s book is along conven-
tional lines, but is interesting for the
facts it gives and a section containing
the best of the poet’s verses.
M. G. SKIPPER.
The Balliols
In The Balliols (Cassell; Dymock’s ;
7s. 6d.) Alec Waugh gives a picture of
England, 1907-1933. Sex is treated
chronologically—first as a sin, then as
a scoot, and finally as a right. Woman’s
suffrage is tied into the women’s vast
war-work. The vanishing of privilege,
the birth of the new industrial “gentle-
man,” the flight of manners, of pity, of
charity—all these tie in also with con-
spicuous smoothness and cleverness. The
great upheavals, the little changes, the
shadowy nothings that alter the passing
years are shown resonantly, or in the
deftest of implications. It is all done
with charm, and the characters are
thoroughly English in their control and
good-breeding.
Alec Waugh has done good, steady
literary work since he wrote “The Loom
of Youth,” and he is now 35. The
Balliols is a sort of stock-taking at the
half-way house “for looking back and
looking forward.” But how often has
the same ground been covered in a family
panorama, the same birds flushed, the
same hard and easy shooting presented
to the reader!
Mr. Waugh writes too well. His
literary manners are so good that he is
not betrayed into any display of his
feelings, and only sometimes does he say
all that he means. He could have done
better than this. He had the material

Spahlinger
Spahlinger contra Tuberculosis, 1908-
1934 (John Bale, Sons, and Danielsson ;
12s. 6d.), is edited by Sir Lynden Macas-
sey, K.C., and Dr. Saleeby. The
jacket claims that “never before have
so many distinguished persons colla-
borated in the production of such a
book.” There are three “Forewords,”
by the Aga Khan, the Marquess of
Crewe and Sir Arthur Stanley respec-
tively ; also “An Afterword” by Mr. A.
Henderson, M.P.
The book is divided into two parts,
“Historical” and “Scientific,” with “Intro-
ductions” by (1) Lord Alington and (2)
Sir Bruce Bruce-Porter, and with chapters
contributed by the late Colonel Arthur
Lynch, Dr. Saleeby, Dr. Leonard Wil-
liams, Dr. Edmond Lardy (Switzerland),
Dr. Camille Savoire (France), Sir Thomas
Watts, M.D., and several professors.
Addenda crop up in unexpected places,
and there are “Conclusions” by the
editors. It might seem almost an over-
statement of the case did we not
remember that it is actually a “nine
years’ pondered” reply to innumerable
attacks.
The contents have been selected from
evidence offered by persons all over the
world. It is not claimed that the Swiss
is an “epoch-making innovator.” Jenner,
Pasteur, Koch and others are not super-
seded by him ; he merely confirms and
illustrates their work. “Call Spahlinger,”
say the editors, “a dwarf upon giants’
shoulders; but, even so, the dwarf sees
farther than the giants, as Coleridge
said.”
The man himself is declared to be
kindly, generous, gentle, upright; one
who loves his fellow-men, helps them
with time and money and abominates
cruelty. There is a moving passage from
Colonel Lynch’s outline of his life: “Fre-
quently young Spahlinger met with some
poor wretch, homeless and hungry,
shivering with cold in the dark wintry
street,” whom he would succor and
shelter. Wounded cats and dogs he often
“housed and fed and petted”; but it
remained for an experience during his
course in physiology to alter the whole
tenor of his life.
Part of the course involved vivisection.
He once described to me the scene and
its effect on him in these simple terms:
“Any man who has ever enjoyed the friend-
ship of a dog will understand what I felt.
The poor animal used for the demonstra-
tion was an affectionate creature. He was
not ailing. On the contrary, he was thor-
oughly healthy, and his behavior when
brought into the operating-room showed
that he thought he was among friends.
The moment his sufferings began, the look
in his great grey eyes was so reproachful
that I felt spiritually ashamed.”
Spahlinger bolted from the room. His
enemies say he has been bolting all his
life, chiefly from pertinent questions and
actual tests.
O. C.
The Folly of Heraldry
So a Sydney Genealogists’ Society is
encouraging the family afforestation
complex. Lord Carson once called
heraldry a “silly old trade.” It is.
Most of us know who our father and
mother were. But does anyone—king,
peer, prince or peasant—know who his
forebears in the thirtieth generation
were? How could he? The number
would be something like 1,073,741,824.
The common notion that each person
now living had only two ancestors in
each generation ignores the fore-elders
in the female line. In the first genera-
tion we have but two ancestors, in the
second four, in the third eight, in the
fourth 16, in the fifth 32. If we go
back no further than the twenty-fourth
generation we find the staggering total
of sixteen-million-odd ancestors.
It is a delusion to suppose that a cer-
tain couple living 800 years ago were
one’s ancestors to the exclusion of all
the rest of the people living at that time
in the country, and still having descen-
dants in it. Each and every one of us
has, in fact, sprung from the whole
mass. Hence, it is morally certain that
all English-Australians of this genera-
tion are descendants of Alfred the
Great and of all the citizens of his
time whose posterity had not died
out in England prior to the family’s
immigration here. This includes lords
and ladies, the wise and the foolish, the
toiling masses, beggars, idlers and vil-
lains.
The most un-English family in Eng-
land, oddly enough, is the British royal
family. In addition to Scottish and Welsh
elements the bluest blood in the King-
dom is diluted with German, French,
Dutch, Scandinavian, Austrian and
many other admixtures. Some of the
great English Catholic families mentioned
in the Almanach de Gotha as well as
Debrett (the Howards and Talbots, for
example) are equally international.
But, broadly, all the inhabitants of
England 800 years ago were forebears
of the present-day English, and all 800
years hence will be g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-
g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-g,-g.-g.-g.-g.-g.-grand-
sons and -daughters of the present-day
English. So it is that the whole world
is indeed made kin.
NOBLESSE DISOBLIGE.
A Satchel of Books
A dozen short mystery yarns by
Agatha Christie which appear under the
title of the first, The Lister dale Mystery
(Collins ; 7s. 6d.), are blends of Edgar
Wallace and Charles Garvice in varying
proportions. There is a gratifying ab-
sence of gore. Most of the dirty work
is done “off”; but in “Accident” a
sticky-beaking ex-detective is permitted
to expire suddenly in possession of the
sole evidence of his hostess’s Borgian
ways.
Ralph Rodd’s latest novel, Her City of
Refuge (Cassell and Co.; Dymock’s;
7s. 6d.), won’t enhance his reputation as
a creator of living characters. Dinah
Mellish, who induces John Hamlough to
make a replica of the Pentlorna
diamonds, is no more realistic than the
master criminal who, disguised as a men-
dicant priest, almost gets away with the
real gems. Penty himself merely bores
with his inane huntin’ and racin’ talk.
Noel Forrest takes an English village
for the setting of The Ferryman (Hodder
and Stoughton; 7s. 6d.). Dr. Fraser,
who tells the story, injures his spine.
After English and Continental special-
ists have failed to cure him, he buys a
cottage at Long Marsden near the river.
At the suggestion of Lady Hilda Rossiter
he reinstals a ferry service for the use
of the villagers. Chained to his wheeled
couch, he soon makes friends, and after a
while they begin to tell him their mis-
fortunes. With his clear vision, he is
able to ferry them across their troubled
waters, Hence the title.
Poison for One, by John Rhode (Crime
Club ; 7s. 6d.). Sir Gerald Uppingham
is poisoned while entertaining a week-
end party at Bucklersbury Park —and he
deserved it. The problem is who did it
and how and why. Our old friend Dr.
Priestley performs another masterly feat
of reasoning, and the slayer owns up.
Not much incident or excitement, but as
puzzling as any crossword problem.
The Brown Rifle, by Merle Cody
(Heinemann; 7s. 6d.). The period is
1820. Martin Ward, of Ohio, gets lost
in the snow and stumbles on a camp.
Here he meets Hagar Ulmer, who has
just finished tramping the earth down on
her husband’s grave. Hagar dissuades
him from trying to reach a settlement,
and they build a cabin. Martin takes
possession of all that belonged to Jethro
Ulmer, including Hagar and his long
brown rifle. The rest is the story of the
slow rise of the township of Toward,
and their rise with it. Excellent as a
yarn, and the characterisation is sound.
The History of the Vestal Virgins of
Rome, by Sir T. Cato Worsfold, Bt.,
M.A., LL.D. (Rider: Robertson and
Mullens, 125.). An account, full of
curious lore, of a cult which persisted in
Rome for 1000 years and was finally
destroyed by Christianity. It originated
in the primitive belief, common to races
as far apart as the Hereros of Africa and
the Aztecs of Peru, that the maintenance
of a perpetual fire was essential to that
of human reproductive functions. The
Vestal Virgins of Rome formed a power-
ful caste who had many privileges, in-
cluding that of being buried alive if they
surrendered their chastity. The decline
of the Vestals began when the megalo-
maniac emperor Heliogabalus publicly
married one.- The monument to the
Virgins is the headless and nameless
statue of Ccelia Concordia with a cross
on its breast, whose name “was probably
erased by her own order when she joined
the living Truth after quenching the fire
which for over 1100 years represented
the light and truth to Rome.”

WHY AUSTRALIANS LEAVE
HOME.
The Channel Islands, with a land sur-
face of 75 square miles and no industries
worth mentioning, are carrying a popu-
lation of nearly 100,000. They have a
pretty good climate and some charming
coastal scenery, but many parts of Aus-
tralia excel them in both. Yet scores of
Australians are to be found among the
sojourners from the U.K. who throng
the fragments of sand and stone—at the
risk of being pushed into the sea off
Guernsey, where about 45,000 people
are perched on 24y square miles. One
Australian bearing a distinguished name
died there recently leaving estate valued
at £34,600.
Why do Australians quit their own
magnificent continent for these remote
and historically null specks on the map?
Chiefly because there is no income tax
in the Channel Islands.
Tax-dodgers? They may seem to be ;
but they don’t carry their Australian pro-
perty away with them. Actually they
become subject to absentee rates of tax,
which are, of course, higher. And
among these exiles are men who would
scorn to cheat the land of their birth or
adoption. One in particular rendered
eminent services to Australia in peace
and war (two wars), and is remembered
with gratitude in hundreds, thousands of
homes. Before departing he gave a
hospital and £25,000 to his church. No,
Australians do not evade Australian
taxes by taking up their quarters in the
Channel Islands; but they do escape
being pursued and plagued beyond en-
durance by swarming tax-gatherers.
This is a form of persecution which
grows worse every year, and ageing, sen-
sitive men who have worked hard for
what they have find it maddening.
People go abroad for many reasons,
but in well-ordered new countries depar-
tures are regularly exceeded by arrivals.
This used to be the case in Australia.
But here is how the record stands for
the three years 1930-32 inclusive:
Australian

1930.. .. 17,537 27,765 10,228
1931.. .. 9,441 21,865 12,424
1932.. .. 9,868 14,686 4,818
Total arrivals (including visitors and
returning Australians) and departures
(including visitors and Australians leav-
ing temporarily) show these balances on
the wrong side, the N. S. Wales figures
being the worst:
Loss by Loss by
Migration, Migration,
Australia. N. S. Wales.
1930 .. .. 11,408 7992
1931 .. .. 12,061 9179
1932 .. .. 4,843 814
Commonwealth figures for 1933 show
an apparent gain of 243 (N. S. Wales
reported a loss of 77, and Canberra
claimed a mysterious addition of 596) ;
but even they are dreadfully disappoint-
ing. Australia should be holding its own
people (save those with special reasons
for departing) and drawing exiles home.
We should not be seeing passenger
steamers put out for Britain and North
America packed from stem to stern and
return half-empty. We should be getting
tourists and sojourners at the rate of
thousands a month. Exchange is 25 p.c.
in their favor ; the cost of living is lower
than almost anywhere else in the world ;
the country is healthy and interesting, and
it offers unequalled facilities for recrea-
tion, together with natural wonders such
as made Sarah Bernhardt declare near
the end of her long life that the most
beautiful thing she had ever seen was a
flight of Australian birds. Why are tour-
ists keeping away from what should be a
paradise for them?
It used to be said that we don’t adver-
tise, but that is no longer the case. There
has lor years been an Australian
National Travel Association which has
offices in London, San Francisco,
Toronto and Wellington. For the year
to May, ’3l, it spent £20,000, and it
proudly reports having issued “2,500,000
booklets and folders, 139,200 posters,
50,000 photographs and maps.” No, the
dearth of tourists is not attributable to
lack of advertising. A likelier theory is
that the travellers who don’t come have
heard that Australia has seven taxation
departments which are laws to them-
selves, and that baiting the newcomer is
their special sport. These things get
about and are discussed.
The Commonwealth department is
bad enough. In an unfortunate hour for
the tourist trade it was empowered to
tax a person’s overseas income even
if he leaves it overseas ; and the High
Court has held that it may add 25 p.c.
to taxable income for exchange, though
the exchange is never received. But some
of the State departments are, if any-
thing, worse. Particularly the one in
Sydney, which collects two State income
taxes, and which always has a multitude
of anxious-looking people hanging round
its offices, sitting on forms or filling in
forms.
An overseas passenger arrives in
Sydney, likes the look of the place, and
prepares for an indefinite stay. He
thinks he had better get £4OO or £5OO
out from England and place it in a bank
at fixed deposit; exchange profit will
keep him going for a while. Perhaps he
and his wife will take a flat and keep a
domestic or two. The bureaucracy does
its best to drive such thoughts out of his
head. He goes to a post office and finds
it plastered with notices to the effect that
a non-resident of N. S. Wales drawing
as much as £1 from Australian sources
must make a return of income to the
State Commissioner of Taxation;
“penalty for neglecting to furnish return,
an amount not exceeding £lOO ; for mak-
ing false statements, £lOO to £500.” He
goes along to the department and is
told that if he receives income in N.S.W.
from any part of the world he wiil be
taxed at the rate of lOd. in the £, no
matter how much of it has been taken
by the country of origin or by the Com-
monwealth or both.
There he will also notice placards—
if he hasn’t read them at the post office
—warning him that, should he employ
a servant “earning £2 or more in any one
week,” he will have to keep “records”
and “affix wages stamps” to them. “A
record of wages, showing all payments,
amounts credited or allowances,” and
“an employer’s schedule showing num-
ber of employees from whom wages tax
is collected, total amount of wages paid,
credited or allowed, and total amount
of tax collected.” Penalties are numerous
and substantial. He will also be told to
insure the employee or employees under
the Workmen’s Compensation Act. But
before this he will probably have decided
to move on to Maoriland or some other
country. There is brisk competition for
trippers all over the world, and only in
Australia is an army of jacks-in-office
turned loose on them.
One way of checking the flight of
nervy old Australians who can’t stand
the worry that the swarm of imposts
entails would be to restrict income tax
to the Commonwealth and make the
thing so clear that everybody would
know what he had to pay—hardly any-
body does now. One way of inducing
tourists to come here in multitudes
would be to issue tax-exemption certi-
ficates, good for, say, 12 months, the
proceeds (a pound might be charged) to
be divided between l the Commonwealth
and the issuing State. They would pro-
bably amount to a lot more than Com-
monwealth and States now extract from
the stranger by methods resembling those
of the late Kelly brothers, and there
would be still more to come from the
many persons sharing in the distribu-
tion of the money they would spend.
The chances are that another 20,000
tourists staying six months in the
country would spend £4,000,000. What-
ever the amount might be Australians
wouldn’t mind paying tax on it if they
had it.
AN OBJECT-LESSON IN
DISARMAMENT.
The early stages of the attempt to start
a revolution (or, which is the same thing,
a general strike) in the U.S.A. by means
of a transport strike in San Francisco-
bore a significant resemblance to the
early stages of the recent Kalgoorlie
riots. In both cases hooligans took
charge, and inoffensive citizens suffered,
because the Governments concerned
were incapable of preserving law and
order.
Such tragedies indicate both the
dangers of disarmament and the reason
why the U.S.S.R. Government (with the
biggest army in the world, and no inten-
tion of disbanding it) is always spreading
disarmament propaganda in other coun-
tries.
Disarmament is the father aiicl mother
of revolution. England would probably
have had a revolution in 1926 but for
the fact that ever since the passing of
the Army Act it has had a highly-
disciplined national force to protect its
institutions.
The objective of the T.U.C. leaders
who organised England’s transport strike
was the same as that of the organisers of
the San Francisco transport strike. They
meant to frighten the Government into
insisting on their demands being granted
by holding up the citizens’ food supplies ;
above all, the milk supplies. If London
had been deprived of milk for a week
children would have died in thousands,
and the inhabitants would have been pre-
pared to grant the enemy any terms —or
so the 1926 strikers reasoned. But before
the strike had lasted a day Hyde Park
was a rnilk depot under military control
and foodstuffs were coming up the
Thames and arriving from all points of
the compass at strongly-guarded rail-
way stations. As no one starved, the
strikers were left with nothing to bargain
over, and their demonstration died a
natural death. Guards and tanks saved
the situation ; plus the realisation by the
strikers that even if they overcame the
regiments on the spot there were others
in the vicinity.
Because San Francisco had no mili-
tary protection this city of a million and
a quarter inhabitants had to submit for
some days to the indignity of “govern-
ment” by a strikers’ committee; to
“widespread organised violence and loot-
ing,” to restaurants being “wrecked and
pillaged by marauding strikers”; and
(following on the mobilisation of the
National Guardsmen) to “hoodlumism
and guerilla warfare between strikers and
authorities.” Encouraged by the suc-
cesses of the Reds in San Francisco
rioters got to work in other parts of
California.
Most Australian cities are even wider
open to mob violence than San Fran-
cisco. Take Sydney. Practically all its
food supplies arrive from the west and
north at a dead end which could be
isolated at once by efficiently-led strikers.
From the moment the city’s food and
drink imports were cut off law and order
would be at an end. The police would
have no hope of standing up to looting
mobs for long ; they are not organised
for such work. The San Francisco
police, for example, failed to do it.
British Governments have always recog-
nised that it is not the business of the
London constabulary to fight disorder
on a large scale ; the police were kept in
the background till the 1926 strike was
virtually over. In Paris, when the local
Red Belt stages one of its periodical
demonstrations against the national Gov-
ernment, the police get off the streets,
and the Cuirassiers and similar crack
formations come into action with drawn
swords.
The democratic system decently ad-
ministered —as, with all the defects of our
elected persons, it is on the whole in
Australia —is a very precious jewel. It
represents personal freedom, comfort,
peace, safety from robbery, rapine and
murder, and from foreign invasion. We
have managed to keep it, so far, without
paying for the armies which the Euro-
pean Powers regard as necessary to pro-
tect themselves from internal trouble, no
less than from outside aggression. An
effect of Communist propaganda has
been to make other countries unsafe so
long as they are disarmed. America has
just made the discovery ; Australia may
be the next.
SAVING THE UNDER-
NOURISHED.
I have been living for three weeks with
19 young Australians who, before they
arrived at the place where I became
acquainted with them, had never seen a
scythe. Clinical thermometers they know,
and they can discourse on pulses as a
bookmaker will on form. Some of
them are aware that ether will remove
paint. But terrace homes in poor suburbs
and long months in hospital have limited
their ambit of experience. What chance
of rural adventure is there for the mite
born in depression, bred hungry in a
house full of unemployment and sent to
spend a fourth of his young life in bed
by a rheumatic heart or bronchial lungs,
developing after malnutrition?
There are boys in this place who might
fall down dead if they ran along the
terrace. There are “heart” cases whose
only sight of the outside world comes
when they are wheeled out of the ward
or carried to a chair on the lawn. Some
of them have been here for eight months.
Yet, with care, they will get well and
strong ; the physical basis is sound ; their
main needs are good food and sunshine.
They are, though, the lucky ones, in-
habiting the only recovery home of its
kind in Australia. There are other boys
in the industrial suburbs who will not be
cured as they will be, who will fall a
prey to pneumonia or grow up weakly
and bitter —an incubus on the com-
munity, a nucleus of discontent.
Mt. Arcadia is a child of the Smith
Family, an anonymous entity which lives
in an unpretentious office under a Syd-
ney city building. Nothing comes amiss
to the Smiths: Christmas hampers and
parties for the hungry, entertainment for
the sick, food and shelter for the work-
less girl, medical attention where it
means the saving of a life. Just over a
year ago the Smiths bought this farm:
a tangled mass of blackberry and black-
thorn, blady grass and untended
camphor-laurels. The land had been
cropped to futility, but the air was brac-
ing, and the view over the plain past
Parramatta was glorious. To-day a real
democracy has transformed everything
that needed transformation.
In the week-ends it is a hive of
workers. Unemployed concreters in-
struct managing directors. Lamp sales-
men shovel soil. From somewhere have
come a vegetable garden and a citrus
orchard, nicely sprouting. The black-
berry and the thorn have gone. Lawns
have been laid down, ornamental and
shade trees planted ; a dairy herd has
been established. The paddocks are
rolled in with subterranean clover and
rye and a rich dressing of super., and the
fences which will fit them for rotational
grazing are going up. A doctor is on the
spot with an eager audience intent on
its temperatures in the sunny easterly
ward. The ward has gay panels, the
work of famous artists. 1 The voluntary
barber and the dentist wait their turn.
I don’t know their names. Nobody has
a name here. If you want to use one,
you call your neighbor “Bill.” “Bill”
may be driving the dirt cart, and you
may learn afterwards that he is the presi-
dent ; but he won’t mind. Nearly every-
thing has been done voluntarily and with-
out wage, and most of it namelessly.
Only the nursing and the domestic staff
are paid, and they earn their pay.
The last thing you see at night here is
a white cap bent over a chart. The first
thing you see before dawn, when the
Southern Cross hangs liquid crystal over
Parramatta and a 130 pulse negotiates
the hour of lowest vitality, is a pink
dressing-gown and a dark, bobbed head
moving from quarters to ward in the
moonlight. Who wants to be a sister in
a boys’ recovery home, snatching odd
hours of sleep in a makeshift bungalow
which will be furnished to comfort point
only when the charges of the place have
been fully provided for? But they all
seem cheerful, though the nearest pic-
ture-show is three miles away along a
dark road and there is a lunatic at large
in the district.
Politicians should by law be compelled
to spend a few days every year in places
like Mt. Arcadia. The experience would
teach them that there is more behind the
unemployment problem than can be
cured with relief work on a sewer. The
full effects of the depression on adult
Australia will not be felt for half a
generation. The Smith Family, a small
organisation of limited range, can lay its
hands on hundreds of cases in Sydney
suburbs alone in which rheumatic com-
plaints following malnutrition and
huddled depression conditions are mak-
ing life a misery for youngsters of sound
Australian stock.
A complete medical survey of the chil-
dren of the unemployed and the half-
employed is needed. A national plan
to deal with their healthy maintenance
or recovery is imperative if Australia is
not to pay heavily in the next generation
for her neglect of one of the greatest of
present poverty problems.
EL VERDUGO.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Transport Tyrants.
Australia has acquired a new lot of
oppressors called Transport Regulation
Departments and the like. They have
been called into existence to save noisy,
smellful and dangerous Government
trams, and to maintain the revenue of
Government railways which cannot
stand fair competition with modern road
vehicles ; and they issue regulations by
the furlong. ’Bus services and delivery
services they ban. A fine is prescribed for
the citizen bringing his neighbor to work
in a car ; a tax for the charitable organi-
sation taking honorary entertainers to
a sanatorium.
Until recently, the new tyrants had
things all their own way, but people are
being baited into resistance. Even easy-
going Sydney revolted against a regula-
tion prohibiting taxi-drivers from picking
up passengers within a hundred yards of
a standing rank, unless by appointment.
“Taxis cause congestion,” it was said,
and “cruising cannot be allowed. A taxi
passenger occupies 81 square feet of
thoroughfare, a tram passenger only 6
square feet.” It is sheer nonsense. If there
were no trams in most of the Sydney
streets, there would be no congestion.
London’s Regent-street and Oxford-
street handle five or six times the traffic
of Sydney’s George-street in the day
without the muddle that rules and the
police that swarm in Sydney. Taxis
teem in London, and they cruise
and pick up anywhere. Also, by
cheap fares, they help to keep down the
charges on “general” vehicles and the
tubes. In Sydney, that is something to
be prevented by any means, fair or foul.
The 100-yards regulation was chal-
lenged in both Houses. The Assembly
approved of it by a small majority;
the Council threw it out. One for the
Council!
It is to be hoped that the N.S.W. Par-
liament won’t go to sleep again and that
other Parliaments will wake up. As
Spicer, M.L.C., said in denouncing the
100-yard limit, “Government by regula-
tion is becoming a danger and a
menace”; and this is true of all the
States and the Commonwealth. It is
permitting hordes of non-elected persons
unknown to the people to strike at their
liberties. The right to legislate is being
transferred from the Houses to depart-
mental offices.

The G.-G. and Dissolution.
“Lex”: By Sec. 28 of the Constitution
the Representatives “shall continue for
three years from the meeting of the
House and no longer, but may be dis-
solved sooner by the Governor-General.”
The G.-G. is entitled to grant a dissolu-
tion by recognised Parliamentary practice
(Todd: “Parliamentary Government in
the Colonies”):
(a) When a no-confidence motion has
been carried against a Government which
has previously appealed to the people.
(b) When an adverse vote has been
carried which is presumably against the
wishes of the people.
(c) When an adverse vote has been
carried by a majority so small as to
prevent the formation of an effective
Ministry by the Opposition.
None of the conditions precedent has
been fulfilled ; the Government has had
an absolute majority of 21 or thereabouts
(38 U.A.P. and 16 C.P. in a House of 75)
for 2\ years. Latterly it has shown signs
of slipping ; so at the beginning of this
month the P.M. told the Representatives
that he intended to ask the Governor-
General for a dissolution in time for a
general election on September 15 next.
This disclosure of an intention to com-
municate with the G.-G. was in itself
irregular. An attempt was made to
justify the procedure by Attorney-
General Latham in the House a couple
of days later. Preparations for a general
election were forthwith begun, to the
accompaniment of considerable expendi-
ture of the taxpayers’ money, though
there has been no executive act so far to
authorise anything of the sort.
To quote Todd again:
It is the duty of a Governor to consider
the question of dissolution solely in refer-
ence to the general interests of the people,
and not from the party standpoint
He is therefore justified in refusing a dis-
solution requested by his Ministers when
he is of opinion that it was asked for
merely to strengthen a party position, and
not for the purpose of ascertaining public
sentiment upon a disputed question of
public policy.
By past precedents the Governor-General
may (a) grant the dissolution; ( b ) refuse
it; (c) grant it subject to the passing of
certain legislation. At the time of writ-
ing he was considering the matter, and
the opinion was expressed by constitu-
tionalists who were familiar with his
methods of thought that he would take
the third course. Whatever his decision
may be Mr. Lyons must accept it or
resign. If he resigned it would mean a
commission to Mr. Scullin, and a promise
of a dissolution with the new P.M. in
power, but without the obligation of fac-
ing Parliament, supply having been
granted.
As I see it, the Government is trying
to establish a precedent, and it will be
dangerous if it comes off. How dan-
gerous may be realised when someone
like J. T. Lang gets into power and pro-
ceeds to follow the U.A.P. example.

Hacking at the M.L. Tariff.
Now and then an Australian manufac-
turer growls at the Tariff Board. Maori-
land manufacturers would like to swap
their Tariff Commission for it.
Maoriland’s Tariff Commission, con-
sisting of the Comptroller of Customs, a
professor of economics, a farmer and the
manager of an engineering business, was
set up to devise tariff changes that would
give the British manufacturer “full oppor-
tunity of reasonable competition” in the
M.L. market, as per the Ottawa Agree-
ment. Its report expresses the opinion
that the strongest argument for protec-
tive duties is “that they exist and have
created a situation that must be met.”
Its recommendations are made on the
assumption that the depression will soon
pass, and therefore need not be worried
about.
The commission’s proposals, adopted
by the Government and made law at
once, abolish all duties on motor-car
bodies, cabinet radio sets, electrical cook-
ing and heating appliances, iron and steel
pipes and nails—things all manufactured
in the Dominion. Substantial reductions
in duty affect nearly every other manu-
facturing industry ; the commodities in-
clude furniture, tinware, soap, galvanised
ware, paints and varnishes, jams, biscuits,
confectionery, baking powder, hats, caps
and millinery and shoe polishes.
A majority of the commission recom-
mended the abolition of the sliding-scale
duty on wheat, and a reduction of the
duty on timber. But these proposals
affected industries which control many
more votes than factory-owners and
their employees can muster. They were
turned down with a hard slam.
«
Australian Films.
“Cauboy”: The Victorian Government
has once more led the country in propos-
ing a quota of Australian films. It is
to grow year by year until Australian
pictures occupy 15 p.c. of the evening’s
screening.
This proposal, it seems to me, is worthy
of support from all people who regard
the film with hope. But the Govern-
ment should do something more than fix
a quota. It should supply facilities,
in the way of studios and equipment,
that would enable people with intelligent
notions of how worthy pictures could be
made to exercise their creative faculty.
It might even erect repertory theatres in
the capitals.
There is nothing Utopian about this
suggestion. The Vic. Licensing Board
has achieved miraculous improvements
in the realm of hotel accommodation by
similar devices. If the Australian people
fail to do the same with regard to their
main item of intellectual pabulum it will
only mean that they rate the quality of
their films as lower in importance than
the quality of their public houses.
There is an immense field for improve-
ment unexploited by Australian film pro-
ducers. The history of the art from its
inception in the silent days should be
investigated. At present a producer
merely pays a visit to the nearest cinema,
observes the latest foreign notions and
devices and then applies them, half-
baked, to a popular novel or some Bland
Holt melodrama, most of which con-
sists of a stage play photographed. The
result is a painful patchwork of old and
new fashions.
The film producer should think exclu-
sively in his new medium, if any artist
should. Few of them have done more
than try to tell a. story much in the way
the stage, with all its limitations, would
tell it. This is an extraordinary thing
when it is considered how far the camera
transcends those limitations. It can leap
from Gabo to Cape York and from 1934
to Batman’s landing in a second. It can
use for a backcloth the entire B.H.P.
works at Newcastle, the R.A.N. or the
air force. On the stage, incidental noises
are usually consigned to a stagehand
armed with a kerosene-tin with pebbles
in it. The screen can employ an actual
symphony concert, a real storm, or a
genuine bombardment.
These possibilities are realised by pro-
ducers, but only as incidental curiosities,
not as the very warp woof of the
tapestry they are weaving. The producer
who thought entirely in the medium of
the film would give us his impression of
life in the form of a sort of visual music,
a rhythmic pattern of light and shade, of
sound and silence, of very carefully dis-
tributed dialogue, all manipulated as a
unity to depict human emotions, precisely
as a sculptor uses clay.
All this might be said to be beside the
point, as the screen is primarily a medium
for popular entertainment. But popular
entertainment would be enormously im-
proved if entrepreneurs understood the
nature of the medium they are manipu-
lating. As things are, nobody would
accuse the average Australian film of
being either popular or entertaining.
♦
Queensland Unemployment.
Only 15.8 p.c. of Queensland salary-
and wage-earners is now unemployed,
against 19.2 p.c. in January. But the
employed include those on part-time, and
the Bureau of Industry admits that “a
further substantial increase in Govern-
ment employment is responsible for the
improvement.” The employable popula-
tion shows a natural increase of 220 per
month. All that the Forgan Smith Gov-
ernment has done is to take up a bit of
the increment, a process which may help
the trend towards a socialist State, but
which imposes a gradually-increasing
burden on the producing community.
The sort of unemployment schemes in
which Governments indulge merely pile
up liabilities for the future. Their cost
makes substantial taxation remission im-
possible. They give no permanence of
employment, no security to the worker.
They are apt to lower both wages and
standards of work, since nobody cares
much about standards in jobs which only
earn interest from the taxpayers’
pockets ; and they are so easy to operate
when the borrowing is done gaily
through political channels that they lead
their sponsors deeper and deeper into
temptation and put the electors under a
greater and greater obligation.
Referring to loan funds for relief work
the Bureau of Industry rejoices in the
thought that
This State has a large allocation of
£4,400,000 £1,100,000 in excess of the
sum approved last year.
Relief loan expenditure in the past three
years has been £6,500,000. Yet the un-
employed number 28,000, against an
average of 16,660 in 1929 and of 22,850
in 1930. Better results might be got if
private employers were relieved of
burdens and thus given a chance to show
what they can do.

A Voice from Moscow.
Comrade Goldsmith, whom the miners
of Wonthaggi (Vic.) sent to Moscow
when they were on strike—peace has
broken out again—has returned with
glowing accounts of what he saw. The
workman in Russia, it appears, “is
always certain of employment, food and
a home.” What is more,
The Red Army is well organised, effi-
cient and happy. It members are re-
garded with the greatest admiration by
their countrymen.
Queer reading for Australian workers,
who are repeatedly urged to smash any
attempt to create a decent defence force!
The Red Army is a regular army ; and
regular armies anywhere but in Russia
are denounced as a menace to the
worker. It has (according to the War
Commissar) “the finest gas equipment in
the world,” and “a mighty force of heavy
bombers.” Bombs and gas outfits are bar-
barisms to trade-union and A.L.P.
leaders when it is suggested that Austra-
lian citizen soldiers should have them.
Australia has never shown any desire
to do violence to any other nation, much
less to “class-conscious” mischief-makers
who take advantage of her liberal free-
speech laws. Yet every time anybody
suggests that she might have efficient de-
fence anti-war leagues raise their voices
in every capital. The loudest mouthpieces
are usually Red Army admirers, who see
nothing wrong in the U.S.S.R. maintain-
ing the largest standing force in the
world. It would be interesting to hear
why, but we shan’t be told. There are
times when even the noisiest agitator
finds silence golden.
♦
Habits of the Turk.
“Chok Fena”: Unless Mustapha Kemal
can devise a new type of frontier tech-
nique or train another type of soldier
he is going to meet serious trouble.
Johnny Turk is apt to be a cow-faced
bucolic who has been taught obedience
with a whip after being conscripted from
an Anatolian farm. He is set down by
the seashore or a frontier in a snuff-
colored uniform which melts into the
surrounding scenery, so that it is diffi-
cult to see him. There, choosing a shady
tree, he draws his cap over his face and
relapses into dreamland. Awakened by
any intruder who does not look Turkish,
he arises with a yell, at the same time
drawing a bead and pulling a trigger
irrespective of whether the obtrusive
foreign matter is a yard or a mile away.
If he has not made a kill he apologises
handsomely, and you are hypnotised into
giving him two lira.
I have been through the experience
twice, and 1 know how uncomfortable
Johnny can make a visitor with his
little gun. Luckily, I was in a fast car,
and each time the sentry was a long way
off; otherwise there might have been a
death or two of British subjects long
before Lieut.-Commander Robinson was
shot at Samos the other day.
There will probably be no serious re-
percussions from that incident, which
would not have happened had Britain
taken a few years ago the stand the
French took. After an inspecting colonel
had wandered inadvertently over the
Syrian border and been peppered, the
French authorities made it plain that the
next time it happened they would
machine-gun every Turkish sentry in
sight. This measure has been highly
effective. The French have their faults,
but they can be sternly practical on
occasion, their leaders not having been
brought up in Lossiemouth on weak
parritch.
«
The Small Investor.
The politician who talks airily of
“nationalising banking” and “socialising
credit” should convince nobody. Bank-
ing and credit could not be brought
under political control without hitting
directly at the class of people who were
compelled to sell their deposits to money-
lenders after the N.S.W. Savings Bank
crashed in April, 1932.
No country in the world has such an
equable distribution of investments as
the Commonwealth. Savings Banks hold
£220,000,000, 70 p.c. in amounts under
£5OO. Building societies have £13,000,000
worth of assets. Friendly societies,
whose operations concern a third of all
Australians, have incomes totalling
£2,900,000 per annum which must pass
through the banks. A quarter of a mil-
lion co-operators handle a turnover of
£36,000,000 per annum, and the size of
the average life-insurance policy (£327)
shows how many small insurances there
must be in existence, and how much
workers’ provision for old age would be
involved if political parties could play
with insurance funds. A million and a
half industrial policies averaging £44 per
policy would also be touched, and there
is not a single fire-insurance policy which
would not be controllable politically,
even if the banks alone were dealt with.
Any voter who is inclined to the wild
nonsense which is being talked in Labor
broadcasts and pamphlets needs to pause
and consider his responsibility to his
neighbor.
Leaving trustee investments on fixed
deposit and in bank shares out of the
question, there are several hundred mil-
lion pounds of workers’ savings to be
endangered by handing over control to
politicians, who have never found them-
selves able to resist the temptation to
use funds and facilities at their disposal
for vote-buying, irrespective of the
interests of the owners.

The All-Important Issue.
Dear Bulletin, —The Federal Council
of the Pharmaceutical Service Guild has
read with considerable interest the
articles which have appeared in your
columns dealing with the chain-store
problem, and I have been asked to
write expressing appreciation of your
action in making your columns available
for the discussion of this important
problem.
Whatever the merits of the chain
store may be when viewed from the
standpoint of merchandising efficiency,
the problem, to my mind, is narrowed
to one issue, namely, is the system in the
best interests of Australia?
The attitude of my council is that
a survey should be made of the problem
and the issue determined as to whether
or not this type of business is satisfactory
from an economic or national aspect.—
Yours etc., C. L. Butchers, Federal
Secretary.

"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Crossed Fingers”: Australians in the
mass heayed a sigh of relief when
Friday, July 13, passed without any
“Stop banging that drum, you brat, and let us listen to ‘Jack and the Beanstalk’!”
appreciable calamity to nation or in-
dividual. There was one exception. On
the date in question a man at Innisfail
(N.Q.) was convicted on 13 charges and
sentenced to 13 months where the flies
won’t roost on him. He had been 13
weeks in the Innisfail district, was driv-
ing a stolen car 13 miles out of town
when pinched, and will do his time at
Stewart’s Creek gaol, 13 miles outside
Townsville.
“Stroratt”: Luton, in Bedfordshire (B.
11/7/ ”34), is one of those queer English
villages that grew into towns on skill in
one trade. Practically, it has lived for gen-
erations on hat-making ; even the women
and children are engaged on piecework
in their houses. The original founders
of the industry were Flemish refugees ;
and the founders of the hat-making indus-
try in Australia were all Lutonians. The
“six hatters” of the early political histor\
ol the Commonwealth (they arrived under
contract after introduction of labor under
contract had been prohibited) were from
Luton. But the old town didn’t have it
all its own way in the Australian hat
trade. Italian hatmakers were pushing
rivals, and French manufacturers might
have been, too, if they hadn’t failed to
realise that the models used for hats of
Frenchmen were useless for most persons
of British extraction. There is a remark-
able cranial difference between races.
* * * *
“Tiki”: The march of progress has
made itself pleasantly felt in Central
Otago (M.L.). In the old days when
anyone got snowbound on the tangle of
mountains that fills
that part of the
South Island he
usually perished. A
little while ago a
walking party of
four went a-missing
on the Lammer-
moor Range. The
Otago Aero Club
sent a ’plane out
scouting. It soon
located three of the
party, who had
taken shelter in an
old sod hut, and dropped food and
fuel to them. The fourth person was
found by searchers on foot, frost-bitten,
but otherwise going strong. The rescue
of the hut inhabitants, once they were
spotted, was easy.
* * ;k
“Sailor”: Word is afloat that Sydney’s
Government House is to be renovated.
It needs it sorely. The bathrooms, to
take one instance, have reached the ripe
old age of 95. They were handed over
by the Admiralty long years ago. The
furniture is Victorian in both appearance
and age, and the carpets have the look
of prehistoric hessian. Some bright
person suggests that the vice-regal bed
should find a last resting-place in the
Museum because it has couched slumber-
ing royalty on several occasions. It
would be more fitting to hand it over
to Cockatoo Dockyard; it is of solid
iron and has a beam of seven feet!
* * * *
“H.A.L.”: It is absurd of “Whitaker’s”
to state that the world’s slowest train
runs between Port Augusta and Kal-
goorlie (B. 11 /7/’34) if the reference is to
the Transcontinental Express, which does
the 1000 miles under 40 hours. But slow
trains do run on the same line, sidetrack-
ing every few miles, and if they aren’t the
slowest on earth they must be near it.
There is an obvious reason ; the so-called
“tea-and-sugar” train is a travelling
“Hey, Gus, y' forgot y'r skis!”
store which supplies the fettlers and their
families with anything from a pack of
cards to a side of bacon. Naturally, a
train which halts every few miles while
women shop at it, there being no other
shops on the Nullarbor Plain, must
travel in leisurely fashion.
* * * *
“Block Boy”: The absent-minded
public posts letters in stranger places than
fire alarms (B. 18/7/’34). A friend of
mine who wields a broom and pan busily
in George-street, Sydney, tells me that
it is no uncommon thing to see people
shoving their mail into those columnar
iron edifices which are so useful in our
streets, even in these days of horseless
transport. It is true that these are gradu-
ally being abolished in favor of a trap
arrangement flush with the gutter, but
while they endure a certain amount of
postal matter will find its way to the
main sewer outlet at Bondi.
* * * *
“L. 1.8.”: The many who groaned
under the headache-producing protec-
tion of the “tin hat” during
the turn-up with Fritz will
rejoice to hear that the thing
has been abolished by the
War Office. In its stead comes
a shrapnel- and bullet-proof
lid made of some secret com-
position in which compressed
cork plays the principal part.
The old tin hat was never
what it was cracked up to be,
for it was not proof against
the average shell fragment or
even against shrapnel under
certain conditions. Concus-
sion often followed after a
whack, and even on the West-
ern Front it was often un-
bearably hot. It made a first-
class wash-basin, however,
and I have brewed hot rum
punch in it in the cold wind and rain of
Esdud.
* * * *
“Mells”: One gets some quaint in-
formation on other subjects beside
cricket in the cricket cables. Witness a
printed statement that two Australian
players were recuperating at Harrogate,
described as “a watering-place” and later
on as “a well-known seaside resort.”
There are watering-places in England—
Bath, Cheltenham and Buxton among
them —which don’t include ozone among
their attractions. But there can’t be
many further from the sea than Harro-
gate, which is about as near the dead
centre of Yorkshire as any place can be.
* * * *
“General Prac.”: The latest figures
show that 491 Australians died of
appendicitis in 1932. Some of these,
of a certainty, might still be alive had
they availed themselves of the early diag-
nosis and the quick operation which are
nowadays obtainable. The swallowing
of powerful aperients to cure any violent
stomach-ache is another danger; castor
oil and Epsom salts have killed thousands
of “acute appendices” in their day.
Countless scores of our fellows must have
died of appendicitis before the appendix
was even known to exist. Not until
1524 did Berengario da Carpi describe,
in execrable Latin, this little side-alley
of our bowel. Open the surgical text-
books of a century ago and you find no
mention of the organ. It needed a king
to warn us that appendicitis is a danger-
ous disease. In 1902, when Edward VII.
was laid low by an attack of abdominal
pain on the very eve of his coronation,
half a dozen of England’s best doctors —
Lister, Laking, Barlow and Hewitt
among them —crowded to the bedside.
ft was appendicitis, and Treves was called
in. He pronounced an operation essential.
Edward, always game, gasped “Opera-
tion! No, Treves, no! Must be at the
Abbey for the Coronation on Wednes-
day.” Treves, not long back from the
South African war, drily remarked that,
unless the King was treated surgically, he
would go to the Abbey in his coffin.
Treves operated, and the patient recov-
ered. Later the great surgeon was to
lose his own daughter from acute appen-
dicitis.
* * * *
“G.G.”: “Rokko” (B. 4/7/’34) errs
in accusing M.L. of exploiting the
“Wakitipu” stamps. When the error was
discovered a number of shrewdies bought
up the entire issue with the intention of
making a handsome profit. Joseph Ward,
then P.M.G., ordered another large
supply, with the result that collectors
were not forced to pay fancy prices for
specimens. In later issues the name was
spelt correctly—Wakatipu.
* * * *
“W.E.F.”: Professor William Thal-
bitzer, of the University of Copenhagen,
is making a fight to save native place-
names in various parts of the world by
having them pegged down on charts.
Serving on a Danish commission, he
found that many localities named by the
Eskimos in Greenland, Canada and
Alaska now bear names of persons. He
will continue his campaign at the forth-
coming Congress of Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences in London ; mean-
while he wants to know what the posi-
tion is in Australia. It is not a ques-
tion that can be answered off-hand, but
there are indications that the habit of
replacing aboriginal names with English
ones is going out. There is a feeling in
favor of keeping native designations and
even of reviving many that have been dis-
carded, but there is no organised move-
ment to that end. It is a job literary and
scientific societies might undertake. For
a start, they might suggest aboriginal
names for our many Lilydales, Brae-
sides, Cliftons, Cheltenhams, Kingstons,
Richmonds, Ravenswoods, Kensingtons,
Prestons, Guildfords and Queenstowns.
* * * *
“Pawang”: A Dutch doctor once
told me that every Asiatic drug, potion,
magical draught and opiate was either
known to the West or had been identified
and analysed. Professor Osborne, Dean
of the Faculty of Medicine at Melbourne
University, however, has a 2000-year-old
poison of the Chinese whose nature is
still a mystery. It is compounded from
the skin of a frog quite easily, and causes
death instantaneously when injected. The
professor has been conducting research
into it for three years without discovering
the secret of its potency.
* * * *
“Bramham Moor”: The story of how
the guest of an Indian rajah took
a stroll in the palace gardens after
dinner and was eaten by a pack
of Alsatian dogs kept as guard recalls a
well-authenticated fox-hunting happening
in the 1840’s. I have forgotten the name
of the pack, but it was a Midlands one.
One bright moonlight night the hounds
kept up such a continual baying that
the huntsman, living close by, could get
no sleep. Taking his crop he went down
to rate them. Unfortunately for him,
he was wearing only a nightgown, and
the hounds, failing to recognise the in-
truder, devoured him, body and bones,
only his skull being found in the
morning.

T. THE R.


“Moo”: Mr. Weaver’s “Drink More
Milk” campaign has had some remark-
able repercussions in Sydney. The other
morning I passed a milk bar which I
never enter myself, though it is
frequented by friends. The interior
is easily visible from the street, and,
looking in, I was aware of an
elderly gentleman of a ruddy but un-
cheerful countenance shudderingly re-
garding a “schooner” which the Hebe
had just placed before him. Pulling him-
self together, he plunged his hand in his
overcoat pocket and pulled out a large
flask of rum. Pouring a liberal dose of
this into the glass before him he gulped
it down. He emerged obviously a braver
and a better man.

“X.N.0.”: The duplicity of Charles
Rogers, who is doing nine months for
breaking the same tooth 27 times on
alleged bits of brick found in London
pies, and who collected cash damages on
each occasion (B. 18/7/’34), reminds me
of an experience of my own. When I
was a youngster I slipped on the bath-
room soap, breaking a large piece off a
front tooth. It looked ugly, but later on
I had the next two front teeth knocked
out in a boat accident at Smyrna. The
Admiralty gave me £2O compensation
and provided me with three new teeth.

“Runa”: Mention of London’s
Jermyn-street (B. 18/7/’34) reminds me
of a war incident in which a street ol
the same name in Auckland (M.L.)
figured. It was then an unimportant
locality, and probably few people had
ever seen the name in print. That didn’t
deter a collection of half a dozen super-
patriots from holding a meeting and
demanding loudly that the name of the
street be instantly changed to something
less suggestive of enemy nomenclature
The bewildered politician to whom their
demand was forwarded sent a reply in-
dicating he would look into the matter,
and the patriots saw the name ortho-
graphically for the first time. That was
the end of the agitation.

“Linseed Lancer”: Now that the
Defence Department has acquiesced in an
inquiry into the Casey case, it is worth
noting that it has crawled down on the
less important—but to those concerned
equally burning—question of the color
granted by King Edward to the N.S.W.
Army Medical Corps half-way through
the Boer War. A color for a medical
unit is a unique distinction. So, when
the flag vanished from N.S.W. and was
later found in the possession of the
Commonwealth, with a plate on the staff
that hadn’t been there originally saying
it had been bestowed on the Common-
wealth quacks, there was trouble. For a
long time the South African Soldiers’
Association bombarded George Pearce
with demands for its return and proofs
that it had been granted nearly two
years before the Commonwealth medical
units came into existence. The corre-
spondence shows just the same twisting
and unwillingness to acknowledge the
truth which The Bulletin showed up
so devastatingly in the Casey affair.
Pearce has finally thrown in the towel,
but with a reservation. He is returning
the color to the A.M.C. in N.S.W., but
refuses to recognise the S.A.R.S.A.
Characteristically, the official announce-
ment of the surrender refers to the color
as having been presented by King Ned
to the Australian A.M.C.
“Hunter Tucker”: There are Victorians
who hold that Batman was never at
Port Phillip at all. Now comes “F.S. ’
(B. 18/7/’34) with the suggestion that
Nuttall’s sketch of Batman is apocryphal.
The figure in Woodhouse’s painting was
“How’m I to have me hath here with no lock on the door?”
“Well, there’s hot and cold water laid on; and I'm not interested."
done from an authentic drawing supplied
by William Weire, Batman’s son-in-law.
Nuttall had no need to draw on “his
powers of invention” ; he must have
known of the existence of Woodhouse’s
painting. It won a Government prize.

“Mako”: A Maoriland parent wanted
a message delivered to an adjoining
farm, and directed his nine-year-old
daughter to deviate from her school
route sufficiently to call on the neigh-
bors. It was only when her brothers
returned late in the afternoon that a
horrified parent learned the girl had not
been seen by anyone all day. Inquiries
at the next farm elicited that she had
not been there, and a search party set out.
Suspicion fell on a field of which the sole
inhabitant was a pedigree bull with a
somewhat sinister reputation. The only
other object in the field was a briar
“If I were you I wouldn’t spend so much time looking into the mirror.”
“Same to you, auntie.”
clump, round which the bull was inter-
estedly sniffing. Group investigation
revealed the missing child in the middle
of the briars, fast asleep from exhaustion
and fear. She had risked a quick run
across the paddock in the morning to
save a lengthy walk round, but the bull
had beaten her to the fence, and only
by doubling back and struggling into the
briars had she been able to save herself.
* * * *
“I Spy”: Von Ernst, ex-head waiter
and Nazi storm-trooper, who was one
of Hitler’s victims during the recent
massacre, comes from a tragic family.
Long before the war a near relative of
his kept a hairdresser’s shop in the
north of London, where he acted as
“letter-box” for German agents in
Britain. When the Kaiser was in London
for the Coronation of Edward VII., one
of his personal staff visited Ernst, un-
aware that he was being shadowed by a
Scotland Yard detective, and that put
authority wise to the hairdresser’s real
calling. Henceforth all letters delivered
to this man were first photographed and
copied. For 12 years Intelligence kept in
touch with all the activities of German
spies, and four hours after war was de-
dared in 1914 all these agents were
arrested except one, who managed to
escape to Norway via Hull. Not till the
spring of 1915, after Lody had faced the
firing squad in the Tower, did the Ger-
man Government know what had hap-
pened to its emissaries.

“C. Coral”: Speculation has been re-
vived regarding the “mahogany ship'’
buried somewhere near Warrnambool
(Vic.). The wreck is supposed to lie
about six miles from the seaport,
covered by sand hummocks. It was first
noticed in 1836, and was considered to be
a vessel of anything up to 200 tons. Old
natives said it was there when they were
small. Relics from the wreck are in
the local museum, and it has fre-
quently been spoken of as the “Spanish
ship.” Many years ago a local clergy-
man, visiting a parishioner, was shown
a curious-looking vessel, and identified
it as a Spanish chalice of about the
seventeenth century. He was told that
it had been found by blacks near the
scene of the wreck. The derelict was
visible for some years, and those who
stood on its decks say that its timbers
were of mahogany, but all recent attempts
made to locate it have failed.

“Freddo”: A curious instance of how
good luck may bring misfortune hard
upon its heels comes from S. Aus. Tak-
ing a ticket in a raffle a popular
citizen won a case of wine, but being
strict t.t. sold it privately. Sequel—
appearance before local Bench charged
with breach of the liquor laws. The
fine was £2O.
* « * *
“Nakhoda”: The reason Melbourne-
ites don’t complain of the cold (B.
11/7/’34) is that they get so much
of it; Sydneyites grumble about it be-
cause they get it so seldom. It is the
steepness of the drop and its rarity that
produce comment. I well remember
some years I spent in Sydney, when most
of the winter we could lie about in shorts
and singlets. When the westerly blew
across Botany Bay the story was different.
The foregoing applies also to the tropics.
Any sojourner in Singapore who greeted
a colleague with the conventional “Hot
to-day, isn’t it! ” would immediately be
put down as a sinkeh —a newcomer. As
it is always hot in Singapore comment
is regarded as superfluous. That was
why Leon Gordon’s otherwise meritorious
“White Cargo” gave ex-Singaporeans a
pain in the neck. The characters never
ceased to wipe their faces with cotton-
waste, sigh, groan, gasp and grumble,
and talk about the weather; and the
equatorial white man on the screen
follows their tedious example.

“Outlander”: What is an immigrant?
A member of a well-known N.S.W.
family was charged at Norfolk Island,
where he made himself unpopular with
authority, with being a prohibited immi-
grant in so far as he had failed to pass a
dictation test in German. The point was
raised that he wasn’t an immigrant, that
he was merely there on a holiday trip.
An immigrant was defined in the Aliens
Act, counsel pointed out, as “an alien
steerage passenger,” whereas his client
was a British subject, and “to immigrate, ’
according to the Oxford Dictionary, was
“to come as a settler.” The objection
was overruled on the vague ground that
anybody who came to Norfolk Island
from anywhere else was an immigrant;
in other words, that the term was synony-
mous with “newcomer” (“comeling,” long
obsolete, is the good old Saxon word).
Possibly there wasn’t a “Webster” on the
Island, but that authority certainly sup-
ports more readily available dictionaries.
It defines an immigrant as “one who
comes to a country for the purpose of
permanent residence.”
“General Prac.”: Certain good souls
have formed a blood-donors’ association,
pledged to serve at a big Sydney hospital.
A like body—policemen and firemen in
its ranks —has been saving odd lives in
Melbourne for four years past. It’s
really nothing new, this blood transfu-
sion. Sam Pepys saw the thing done on
dogs at the Royal Society in 1666, and
mentions such operations at least six
times in the “Diary”; Sam’s tavern
friend, Dr. Lower, seems to have been
the first Englishman to perform the job.
Louis XlV.’s physician, Baptiste Denys,
is said to have saved a man’s life with
calf’s blood, a deed which enraged the
Paris doctors of his day. Old Pope Inno-
cent VIII., in his last days, was given
blood from the veins of three boys. The
Franco-Prussian War saw a revival of the
practice ; but faulty knowledge of “blood
grouping” and fatalities due to the in-
discriminate mixing of blood caused a
slump. To-day, with perfected technique,
transfusion is here for keeps. During the
war many a doctor cherished, above any-
thing else, his jars of blood, all ready for
the succor of the wounded.
CASABIANCA UP TO DATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the Carcoar (N.S.W.) inquest, the deposit ion
clerk determinedly continued his work though smoke
billowed round him and his eyes streamed with
tears. He never even paused to ascertain the cause
of his discomfort —his extemporised foot-warmer
was afire.”
The clerk sat at his desk of oak,
The sheets before him spread;
He couldn’t see for clouds of smoke,
He typed by touch instead.
He didn’t seem to know or care
The focus, of the storm
Lay in the brick-and-sacks affair
That kept his trilbies warm.
The tears into his eyes that came
The depositions blurred;
He gasped and choked, but all the same
He never missed a word.
His hero soul was not the sort
To leave his job half-done;
Though ever smokier grew the court,
He plodded gamely on.
He might have perished at his post
For oh! his plight was dire;
His very boots were like to roast,
His pants were near afire.
But some bold copper saw his pass,
Noted the sacks a-fume,
And deftly grabbed the smouldering mass
And hurled it from the room.
Martyrs to duty? Aren’t we all,
Somewhere, somehow, somewhen,
Who answer to our country’s call
And quit ourselves like men?
That “Crowner’s Quest” from day to day
Sat on, from dawn to dark,
But the noblest Roman there, I’ll say,
Was that intrepid clerk.

POLITICAL POINTS
Lawson is retiring from Common-
wealth politics as well as Latham. Either
might have been Prime Minister had he
pushed his claims —Latham in 1931,
when he stood aside for Lyons ; Lawson
this year. Though it wasn’t noised abroad,
i? e Rockies were willing to serve under
the ex-Premier as leader of a composite
Government. Menzies, who is to stand
fpr Kooyong, will be more self-assertive
than the two L’s when his chance comes.
Walter Kingsmill’s fidelity to the Com-
monwealth is to cost him his seat. Yield-
ing to secessionist threats, the controllers
of the Westralian Nat. organisation have
erased his name from the Nat.-C.P.
ticket, substituting that of some “cam-
paign director” or other—there are lots
of these gentlemen about, and the
example of Parkhill has kindled their am-
bition. So the Senate will lose a graceful
speaker and Westralia a representative
who has served it worthily for 37 years.
W. J. Cooper is out again for a
Queensland Senate seat along with Sena-
tors Crawford and Foil. They have been
members since 1917; Cooper had one
term, but was defeated three years ago.
He and Foil were Diggers.
Queensland Country-Progs, are hold-
ing their annual conference in Brisbane
on August 30-31. In one of the motions
on the business-paper reduction of the
number of members of the State Parlia-
ment from 62 to 48 is proposed; in an-
other, subsidies for denominational
schools are sought. This looks like a
challenge to the Langsters and the
Scullinaries.
Britain’s policy of levying on imported
beef to provide a bonus for the British
farmer is to be held in abeyance for two
years—the term of the Ottawa Agree-
ment. Stewart, the Minister of Com-
merce, is anxious for the world to know
that the change of front is not due to a
threat by his Government. Why labor
the obvious? His Government wouldn’t
threaten King Buck-Eye, much less King
George.
The strike of coalminers at Wonthaggi
(Vic.) lasted four months and two weeks.
Eleven hundred miners came out and lost
£lOO,OOO in wages, and the State, which
employs them, lost £ll,OOO. The trouble
was over the dismissal of two men and
the suspension of seven wheelers. It
could all have been settled in a couple
of hours by a bit of commonsense.
Under Victorian law cinema pro-
grammes must contain 1000 feet of Aus-
tralian film. The Argyle Government is
extending the quota system to the dis-
tributor, who will be required to handle
an annually increasing Australian propor-
tion of feature films —5 p.c. in the first
year, 7 i p.c. in the second year, and so
on until 15 p.c. is reached in the fifth
year. It is borrowing the notion from
Commissioner Marks, who reported on
phases of the film business to the N.S.W.
Government. To show how amicable it
can be, the N.S.W. Government has
undertaken to copy Victoria’s quota
legislation.
N.S.W. Transport Trust claims a “net”
profit of £44,000 on trams and ’buses for
1933-34. How much was lost in taxes
and charges on outlawed private ’buses
and dole payments to unemployed drivers
and conductors is not stated. Anyhow,
the public is not rejoicing, knowing that
most of the Government trams would
have been used for firewood on the Ark,
and that Government ’bus fares are the
highest in the world. On one section—Spit
Junction to The Spit—four passengers
sharing a taxi can cut the ’bus time 50
per cent, and save Rd. each on the ’bus
fare.
The Government at Canberra persists
in letting the Westralian secessionists
score off it. After announcing that it
would not reply to their case it engaged
a committee at great expense to prepare
a reply. The secessionists’.retort to this
is that their case was drawn up by an
ex-Premier, an ex-Minister, the Crown
Solicitor and others without costing the
taxpayers a penny.
The Vic. Cockies talk of bringing out
a man against young Fairbairn in
Flinders. They have only once contested
that electorate—in 1922, when S. P.
Thompson kept Bruce busy, being beaten
by 2157 in a poll of 19,221. There was
no Labor man in the field, and no doubt
Thompson got most of the Labor vote.
Westralian Labor Ministers admit a
loss of just on £789,000 for the year to
June 30, and, considering the grants they
are getting from the cursed Common-
wealth and the revenue they could be
getting from goldmines, real and alleged,
they ought to be ashamed of it. They
began the year by providing for a dis-
tribution of £llO,OOO among State civil
servants. An ominous precedent, but it

has been disregarded in N.S.W., where
Stevens is starting 1934-35 by adding
£400,000 to public-service pay totals.
Tas. Premier Ogilvie, who has secesh.
notions, reports a rush of applicants for
Federal-aid road money, the brutal Com-
monwealth having “granted to us
£133,000 out of the tax on petrol.”
Comrade Dwyer, V.C., was in it:
Mr. J. J. Dwyer, V.C., pointed
out the necessity of completing the road
from Granton to New Norfolk. The
Government has placed on the schedule
£6500 for the purpose.
Perhaps this will console the V.C. for
being the only re-elected Labor Assembly-
man to be crowded out when Caucus
was shaking the plum-tree.
Queensland Deputy-Premier Percy
Pease, who must have his sensation:
I have had letters from producers’ associ-
ations telling me that, if I did not stop
my policy of opening up further land for
settlement, 1 would be stopped with a
bullet.
Doesn’t Percy mean billet? It is a far
commoner weapon for stopping poli-
ticians.
Paterson, Gibson, Hill and McClel-
land, the Vic. Cocky Ms.H.R., and
Senator Bob Elliott have refused to sign
“the new nomination form,” which for-
bids them to do anything at Canberra
without the permission of Hocking’s
“central council,” though they are not
expressly forbidden to breathe, eat,
drink and sleep. Paterson has been ad-
vised by Edward Mitchell, the constitu-
tional lawyer, that “the new nomina-
tion form” is illegal. Whether it is or
not, these “central councils” and “inner
groups” that come between members and
their constituents are hastening the day
when the whole pre-selection swindle will
be declared illegal.
Pre-selection doesn’t seem to be nros-
pering anywhere The S in Boothbv
( S .A.) took a ballot to satisfy objectors to
Jack Price, who used to be Labor; it
resulted in a tie between Price and K. O.
Wilson, and the bosses may have to
endorse both. The same course may be
necessary in Wakefield, where Malcolm
Cameron is resigning. Another Cameron
is after the seat, and Senator McLachlan
wouldn’t mind having it.
Diggers’ wives whose pensions were
cut 22\ p.c. in 1931 (10 p.c. was restored
last year) are to get full rates again. This
is good, but much remains to be done.
In t.b. cases pensions are refused to
Diggers who cannot prove that the
malady was war-caused. Even where
proof is furnished allowances in some
cases are sinfully small.
The Vic. branch of the R.S.L. had a
Canadian at its annual conference. He
mentioned that in the country of the
Canucks every returned soldier with t.b.
is regarded as suffering from war in-
juries, and is pensioned accordingly. And
so it should be in the Commonwealth.
If Chief Secretary Macfarlan has his
way, every motor-car and -cycle owner in
Victoria will have to take out insurance
to cover possible victims, and pay the
premium on registration or renewal of
his license. According to Macfarlan
there are about 187,000 motor vehicles
in Victoria, and in five years (1929-33)
36,136 accidents were reported ; the killed
numbered 1261. Voluntary third-party
insurance has been tried and found want-
ing. Only 42 p.c. of motorists in the
country and 60 p.c. in Melbourne go in
for it.
Australian motorists who take out
third-party insurance complain that it is
dashed expensive. Chief Secretary Mac-
farlan admitted this when introducing
the bill which will make the thing com-
pulsory in Victoria (N. S. Wales, Pre-
mier Stevens says, will follow suit), men-
tioning that in Maoriland —which has
had third-party insurance since 1928 —un-
limited cover can be bought for an
annual premium of 17s. It runs to
£3 10s. in Victoria. If the Vic. and
N.S.W. Governments want to secure
general acceptance for their measures,
they will have to guarantee motorists
something like Maoriland rates.
Queensland Opposition-Leader Moore
has joined the chorus of politicians who
want five-year Parliaments. Three years
he pronounces “far too short a term for
any Government to give effect to a broad
and far-reaching policy” ; but the Gov-
ernment with that sort of policy is as
scarce as iced shandy in Sheol, and for
the Government with another sort three
years is too long. Imagine five years of
government by Lang!
All this talk of five-year Parliaments
being necessary for continuity of policy is
bunkum. The U.S.A. has got along for
146 years with a Federal House of Reps,
elected for two years, and nearly every
State has two-year Legislatures. New
York, with over 13 million people, has
an Assembly of 150 members elected
annually.
Westralia would be much better served
by its separatists if they devoted part
of their energy to campaigning for real
constitutional reform and part to getting
a dock for their State, or a naval base,
or both. The “Sentinel,” a new Fre-
mantle paper, makes the arresting point
that when the Government steamers
need attention they have to go to Sydney
or Sourabaya to get it. Cockburn
Sound was a live place when the Govern-
ment of the day started to act on
Admiral Henderson’s report, but it lost
its enthusiasm, and the works were
abandoned.
Hitler has a short way of settling labor
troubles. By an Act promulgated last
January and put into force on May 1 the
mass of arbitrative legislation accumu-
lated when the Social Democrats were
a power was swept away. The new Act
decrees briefly that the owner of an in-
dustrial establishment is the boss and
shall make all decisions ; the duty of his
employees is to obey.

Sir Osborne Smith, of the Imperial
Bank of India, is to be governor of the
projected Reserve Bank of India. He
is a Sydney Grammar product, and
learned his banking here. He was
manager of the Brisbane branch of the
Commonwealth Bank during the war
years.
Dr. Leonard Cockayne, the M.L.
botanist, who has gone west at 80, was
born in Derbyshire. When the Royal
Society awarded him its Charles Darwin
Medal and made him a Fellow, Lord
Rutherford, who made the presentation,
said that Cockayne’s researches entitled
him to rank with the writer of the
“Origin of Species.”
H. E. Boote, who has completed 40
years as a Labor journalist, started life
as assistant to a chain-maker. He made
his name on Brisbane “Worker” before
joining the one in Sydney. He had a
very light touch in youth. Witness his
“Fool’s Talk.” The necessity of slang-
whanging the capitalist octopus in and
out of season has rather cramped his
humorous style; but he can still joke
J. A. MACARTHUR ONSLOW, late of Norfolk Island.
without difficulty. He is Shavian in his
vegetarian and anti-liquor tastes.
“Kir”: Tom Hoskins, who passed out
at Marrickville Hospital (Sydney) last
week, was about the most ferocious
orator who has adorned the N. S. Wales
Assembly. He used to make one long
speech each session. The Labor Opposi-
tion, to a man, invariably rolled up to
hear it, and to feed the iconoclast with
interjections. Maledictions poured from
him amidst the cheers of the attacked.
On one occasion, however, he gave ex-
pression to a truism which prompted the
late Hugh Connell, M.L.A. for Newcastle,
to comment encouragingly, “That’s a
sine qua non, Tom.” Hoskins glared
malevolently at Connell, and thundered
“No impudence from you, young
fellow! You can’t bluff me by drawing
a red herring of that kind across my
trail.”
“H.S.”: William Kippen, of Ipswich
(Q.), has claims to Australia’s continuous-
service record. The “Queensland Times,”
Ipswich, which recently had a 75th birth-
day, has employed him for 70 years. He
began as the office devil, and at 84 he is
chairman of directors.
“W.L.”: The late Professor Le Gay
Brereton, first president of the Fellowship
of Australian Writers, whose portrait
was unveiled by Minister for Education
Drummond the other day, helped to
found another literary society, over 20
years ago—the Casual Club. Members
used to meet for meals at the old Troca-
dero in Castlereagh-street, where the
Prince Edward now stands. Chris
Brennan. Hugh McCrae, Arthur Adams,
Hal Eyre, Frank Fox, Norman Lindsay,
Dave Soutar, Henry Lawson and Ber-
tram Stevens were among the feeder-
talkers.
Here is Finey’s conception of the man
who gave Norfolk Island a pain in its
Pinney. J. A. Macarthur Onslow (only
son of the ex-M.L.A. and ex-M.L.C.
who will entertain the Duke at Camden
Park) was in the 16th Lancers in the last
years of the war.
He was, of course,
only a youngster
then. The Ad-
ministrator of Nor-
folk Island had
him deported after
he had failed to
pass a test in
German. Here
we have another
proof that history
doesn't always re-
peat itself. A Mac-
arthur ousts Bligh ;
a Pinney ousts
Macarthur’s de-
scendant! Young
Macarthur Onslow
has made history
in another respect:
he is the first
member of his
branch of the
family who has
been front-page
stuff in the “S. M.
Herald.”
H. C. Cornforth,
the large, genial
golfing chairman
and managing
director of the
Vacuum Oil Co.*
has decided to call
it a day. He is fit
enough, and will
still sit on the
board of the con-
cern he has helped
to build up in
Australia, but he
‘ wants a rest. He
has been a director
for quarter of a
century, and local
boss for two-thirds
of.the time. S. A. Callanan, an American,
will take over in October.
From Dave Souter:
Last week the Australian Writers unveiled
a portrait of Prof. Le Gay Brereton, and
stressed his attainments as a scholar and his
quality as a man. But they ignored an im-
portant side of his character. Jack Brereton
was a pioneer. Boys, young men, middle-aged
men, old men, are exposing their domes to the
sun in their thousands in the vain hope of
never going bald. Factories shut down, shops
shut up, the price of rabbitskins drops ten
per cent.-all because Jack Brereton was the
first white man in Australia, maybe in the
world, who never wore a hat.
After J. A.
McCallum here
depicted by Frith —
had made a big
impression as Fed-
eral Labor candi-
date in the Martin
by-election he was
nearly deprived of
the party nomina-
tion for the general
election on a snap
vote. However, the
matter was fixed
up last week, and
he is again the
standard-bearer of
Scullinism. Born
at Mittagong 41
years ago, Mr.
McCallum joined
up early in the
war, rose to be a
sergeant in the
55th Battalion, and
was wounded at
Polygon Wood. He
is a graduate (first-
class honors in his-
tory) of Sydney
Uni. and led the
Arts team against
the Oxford de-
baters who were
here in 1925. He
is a teacher of
English and history
at Canterbury High
School. McCallum
is something of a
curiosity as a poli-
tical candidate ; he
has nothing but
good to say of his
U.A.P. and Lang
Labor opponents.
Colonel R. M.
Downes, who suc-
ceeds Major-
General G. W.
Barber as C.M.F. Director-General
of Medical Services, became a M.O.
in 1908. He was a Lieut.-Colonel
when he joined up with the A.I.F.
six years later. His work was done
in Sinai and Palestine, and his jobs in-
cluded D.D.M.S. of the Desert Mounted
Corps and D.D.M.S. of the A.I.F.
throughout Egypt and Palestine. He is at
present Deputy-Director of M.S. for Vic-
toria. Born in Britain in 1885, he was
educated at Haileybury and Melbourne
University.
Captain Pinney, M.C., who had a dis-
tinguished carer in the Papuan civil ser-
vice before he was made Administrator
of Norfolk Island in 1932, joined the 4th
Light Horse as a trooper in the first
month of the war, and was badly
wounded in the attack on Lone Pine. He
got his decoration for work at Second
Passchendaele, where he led a company
of the 6th Battalion in what Bean
(“A.I.F. in France”) calls “a most gal-
lant episode.” He married a daughter of
Lieut.-Governor Murray, of Papua, in
1918, and they think a lot of him in the
Imperial Service Club, which he fre-
quents on his rare visits to Sydney. His
reasons for deporting Macarthur Onslow
remain matters for speculation, but those
who know him say that he is unlikely to
have erred on legal grounds. He was
trained by his father-in-law, by far the
ablest colonial Administrator that Aus-
tralia has produced.
Neil O’Sullivan, who will run for
Brisbane against the Labor M.H.R.,
Lawson, is a solicitor of 33 who has
already made a place in his profession.
It will be his first shy at Parliament, but
he has been taking a hand in politics
for some years, and has aspired to be a
Brisbane alderman. He is a product of
Nudgee College.
Vic. branches of the R.S.L. are now
asking who “Mr. Martin” is. This
mysterious benefactor of the Diggers’
J. A. McCALLUM, Digger, ’Varsity hofiors-man and
Federal Labor candidate.
descendants has already given £2500 to
N.S.W. branches. Recently he extended
his activities to the Cabbage State, and
his anonymous largesse now exceeds
£2OOO. An effort of the annual con-
ference in Melbourne to award him a
certificate of merit was frustrated by his
polite refusal to disclose his identity.
“D.” looks in on the Dom.:
Rufe Naylor is the queerest recruit Sydney
Domain has attracted for a long time. He had
more people listening to his rubbish about
inflation on Sunday last than any of the other
speakers. A. small, dapper man, with manicured
hands and a face as unemotional as a rat-trap,
he gazed down on his audience with undisguised
nausea. There were no jokes. Gamblers of
his type don’t yield to weaknesses like laughter;
the furthest they go when amused is to con-
tort the lower section of the face grimly for
a second or two, while preserving the menacing
appearance of the brow and eyes In pony-
racing circles this manner, taken in conjun®-
tion with a chewed cigar or a half-cigarette
dangling from the lower lip, indicates know-
ledge of form and of the secret intentions of
owners, trainers and jockeys and a capacity to
outwit racecourse officials. Tight, shiny clothes
and comic little hats add to the impression.
Mr. Naylor was wearing the livery of his
calling on Sunday, his diminutive panama being
of a delicate pastel shade. Where do book-
makers and professional punters get these
preposterous hats? Never have I seen a speaker
with a better control over a crowd. He was
slinging them tips, and they were as grateful
as racecourse mugs.
The late Walter Bennett, M.L.A., like
many another successful N. S. Wales
citizen, was born and educated in M.L.
A newspaper proprietor, he was first
elected for Durham 36 years ago. He
became Minister for Forests three years
later, and, with one interval, he was
prominent in public life to the end of his
days. Everyone liked Walter Bennett,
and Macquarie-street will miss him. A
son, Gordon, has written some fine
Bulletin stories.

The strength of the banks has been a
more important factor in the re-
covery of Australia than is generally
realised. Yet, so far as profits are con-
cerned, their figures exhibit a stubborn-
ness that has been overcome by most
other traders. That is because returns
from advances, some of which now turn
in nothing at all, and from Consols,
Treasury bills, call money, etc., have con-
tracted faster than the cost of deposits,
and overhead generally, including the
demands of the taxgatherer, Which call
for a much larger proportion of earn-
ings than they did five years ago. Cer-
tainly the rate for fixed deposits has been
reduced from 3i p.c. to 2 p.c. for one-
year and from 3\ p.c. to 2\ p.c. for two-
year currencies over the last 12 months.
But old contracts run to maturity at the
old rates, so it will be close on two years
before the full benefit of the last reduc-
tion (April) will be felt. The cut in
the charge for overdrafts (the maximum
rate is now 5 p.c.) and shrinkage in
returns from Government and other
securities have been immediate and
general.
About nine-tenths of the Q.N.’s busi-
ness is done in its home State, where,
during the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, wool, sugar, beef and
butter all brought in more, exchange was
steady, and trade locally was better —
there was a drop of £533,426 in interest-
bearing deposits and a growth of
£602,507 in current accounts. The co.
bought at a discount and cancelled
£160,617 of old interminable deposit
stock (a reminder of the ’nineties), and
some “profitable dealings” in Consols
(£1,456,388, up £83,503) helped. Treasury
bills (£690,000) were down £440,000, and
there was very little demand for over-
drafts—advances were only £6608
heavier.
Whatever the co. gained on the swings,
however, it lost on the roundabouts.
After providing for contingencies, de-
clared net earnings were £5629 lighter at
a shade under 4 p.c. on capital as against
4.3, 4.2, 8.1, 11.7, 12.1, 12.3 and 13.6 p.c.
back to 1927—£950,000 of fresh capital
was gathered during the six years to the
close of accounts in ’29, more than
doubling the total on the register.
The div. was kept at 4 p.c., and the
market, which doesn’t expect anything
better for a while, prices the £5-paid
shares at par. As for cover, the eye can
see £7 10s. 2d. per share in net tangibles.
So, to pay a 4 p.c. div. and 3\ p.c. on
the interminable debenture stock, total
funds (capital, reserves and debentures
combined) need turn in only a shade
over 3 p.c.
The solid nature of the financial struc-
ture, and other things, are seen in this
comparison:

was holding only 30s. of the public’s
money for every pound, of its own, in-
cluding the debenture stock. It is an ex-
ceptionally strong position, but it means
low earning power until profitable em-
ployment can be found for more of the
funds.
The outlook is for another good season,
but prices are uncertain, especially for
wool.

This co., with factories at Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Port Adelaide, is the largest
manufacturer of linseed oil and cake in
Australia. For many years it did not
get the full benefit of its expanding out-
put, because the demand for cake, etc.,
as stock food greatly exceeded the de-
mand for the oil—every two tons of cake
means a ton of oil. Partly because
of this, chairman S. W. 'Phillips induced
Michael Nairn and Co., the big Scottish
lino, people, to set up here about half
a dozen years ago ; also, arrangements
were made with Blundell, Spence and
Co., of London and Hull, to use their
trade-marks. Then slump, exchange and
primage—the co. buys linseed, its raw
material, mainly from India and S.
America —interfered with the ’3l and ’32
figures, and reserves had to be tapped to
pay two modest divs.
Meanwhile the enterprising manage-
ment turned its attention to the dairying
industry, where the demand for linseed
cake, which enriches the butter-fats, con-
tinues to expand. This, steadier exchange,
smaller fluctuations in the price of lin-
seed, the recovery in the pastoral and
paint industries, and especially the pro-
gress of Nairns have enabled the
co. to make a rapid recovery. Last year
gross earnings (£133,773) sprang £19,200 ;
exes. (£104,695, including provision for
depreciation, etc.) took £16,090 of the in-
crease, leaving enough to pay the pref.
divs. and show 7.9 p.c. on £327,369 ol
ord. capital as against 6.9 p.c. in the pre-
vious term. The div. was kept at 5 p.c.,
making the average 4.7 p.c. over the last
decade. Excluding the depreciation re-
serve (£19,965), previously lumped with
sundry creditors in the sheet, £87,635 of
the capital was unrepresented by tan-
gibles when the books closed —goodwill
figures at £115,747.

The more or less liquid surplus
(£145,780, including stocks) was £29,719
stronger than at the previous balance.
Drafts for linseed shipments (£82,330)
were £12,603 heavier, and the amount
coming to sundry creditors (£13,712) was
£11,984 lighter, due to disclosure of the
depreciation reserve. Stocks were down
£34,448, and cash (£113,743) up £66,038.
Owing to the widespread nature of the
risks and the amount of goodwill, the
market prices the pound ords. at 215., at

There is a sharp contrast between the
performances of this co. and those of
the overcapitalised Union group, with
which it is now linked up. It was formed
in 1920 to build the Prince Edward
Theatre, Sydney, which began earning
four years later, and gathered £lOO,OOO
of capital in 80,000 prefs. and 20,000
ords. for the purpose. There was no
goodwill to weigh down the earning
power of capital, and preliminary exes.
(£BBl6 in 1924, since wiped out alto-
gether) were moderate. Further, the co.
got out of its property investment, the
Victoria Arcade, with a profit of £24,619
in 1926, and lowered the mortgage from
£161,793 to £60,000-odd. The only sub-
stantial capital outlay since has been the
cost of the change-over to talkies and
the outlay on air-conditioning and noise-
absorption equipment, which has been
financed out of earnings.
The floating debt, down £2196 last
year, is well covered:

A start has been made to reduce the
mortgage, down £lOO5. On fixed assets
£437 was spent and £2142 was written
off. In addition £2500 was dropped into
the depreciation reserve, making it
£25,120, which is not included with
reserves in the table.
Thus far the theatre has been kept as
attractive as most others. This and its
reputation for select entertainment have
ensured the co. its full share of public
patronage, and divs. have continued to
flow, despite extra taxation and reduced
admission charges. Allowing for depre-
ciation (£2500), last year’s net earnings
sprang £4637, reaching 8.4 p.c. on
capital, thanks to freer spending, a little
relief from taxation and better films, and
an all-round p.c. was distributed.
Satisfactory contracts for film sup-
plies for “a considerable time to come”
have been entered into, the board says.
Still, more theatres are being built, and
goodwill in the picture business is a mer-
curial element. Much therefore depends
upon whether the allowances for depre-
ciation, etc., together with what may have
been spent on fixed assets and charged
to revenue, prove to be sufficient to
cover the cost of renovations, replace-
ments, etc.
The market sums up the risk by pay-
ing 21s. 6d. for the prefs., at which
figure the return is 7.2 p.c. on a 1\ p.c.
div. basis. The shares carry a non-
cumulative 10 p.c., with priority as to
capital. After both classes of scrip have
had 10 p.c., any surplus, whether distri-
buted or not, belongs 60 p.c. to the prefs.
and 40 p.c. to the ords.

After maintaining the steamers and plant
in thorough repair, and providing for de-
preciation, etc., the board wrote the
year’s net profit £2348 better at £19,726.
But £3685 dropped from somewhere into
reserves, whereas £1394 disappeared in
the previous term. Taking these move-
ments into the reckoning, the year’s net
earnings sprang £7427, reaching 8.3 p.c.
on capital as against 6.2, 6.6, 5, 6.9 and
11.8 p.c. back to 1929, and 1| points
were added to the div., lifting it to 7 p.c.,
the final being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
This surprised the market, and the
price of the lOs.-paid shares advanced
sharply from 16s. to 18s. or thereabouts,
following publication of the accounts ; a
year ago the figure was 14s. 6d. The
return at 18s. is 3.9 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div.
basis. The cover is 11s. 7d. per share in
net tangibles.
Among the factors responsible for the
better showing were the new bathing en-
closure, dressing pavilion and promen-
ade built on the harbor-beach side of
Manly. These attracted large crowds,
especially during the school holidays, the
board says ; and the return from season
tickets was better, too, while operating
exes, showed “a very small increase,”
notwithstanding that the fleet steamed
more miles. Incidentally, the co. is giving
the public the cheapest passenger ser-
vice in the metropolis, and it runs a ten-
minute timetable during peak hours.
What the new attractions cost the co.
has not been disclosed in the published
accounts. The outlay occurred mostly
during the previous term. A pleasing
feature is that the co. didn’t have to go
outside for any of the money:

‘lncludes investments.
The real position has been obscured by
the lumping of investments and fixed
assets in one untidy entry during the
past two years. The net growth in the
item was £5022 for the last term.
In 1929 ss. per share (£140,808) was
struck off capital in order to write down
the book value of the fleet, which had
been multiplied by three in 1920, when
scrip paid to 40s. was handed out for
every share paid to 15s. in the old co.
Then, in 1932, the liquidation of the
P. J. Investment and Insurance Co.
turned in a profit of £23,556, which was
added to reserves.

The business has developed steadily with
the growth of settlement on the N. S.

opposition, but it never affected the co.
much; one after another competitors
were bought out or dropped out, and
the co. now enjoys practically a mono-
poly of the shipping from Newcastle
north to the Queensland border. Earn-
ings depend mainly upon shipment of
dairy produce and the back-loading of
goods for storekeepers and others. The
div., which was 8 p.c. early in this cen-
tury, was lifted to 9 p.c. in 1913, and to
10 p.c. in 1920, and remained steady till
1932, when it dropped to 8 p.c. again.
A small capitalisation in 1926 —the only
one in the co.’s history—makes 8 p.c.
worth a shade under 9 p.c. to old
holders.
Including an unexplained addition of
£4ll to reserves, and after providing for
depreciation and taxation, the net result
for the last term was 8.1 p.c. on capital
as against 8, 8.1, 8.6, 12, 11.1 and 11.7
p.c. back to 1928.
Owing to the co.’s snug position, the
cheapening of money and strong demand
for sound industrials, the pound shares
are now priced at 445. on the market as
against 345. a year ago, and 255. 12
months before that. The return at 445.
is 3.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis ; every
rise or fall of 1 p.c. in the div. would
affect the return by half of one per cent.
The cover is visibly 275. Id. in net tan-
gibles.
During the year two steamers —Bur-
ringbar and Coramba —were sold.

The figures show the trials and tribu-
lations of the timber trade over the last
eight years or more. The co. was a steady
10 percenter for 20 years after the public
became interested, in 1905. But, owing
to competition from reinforced concrete,
etc., and imported timber, net earnings
averaged only 3.5 p.c. on £150,000 of
capital for the five years to the close of
accounts in 1930, as against 10.5 p.c. for
the preceding quinquennium. Then slump
further reduced turnover and flooded the
market with liquidation stocks.
To wipe out the resultant losses and
bring the book value of assets more into
line with their earning power, half the
capital was jettisoned, reducing it to
£75,000 in 10s. shares:

more than was written off to the book

side for a further £10,889 last year. The

Did you share in the
£4,773,000?
AT the beginning of July, Bonus Certificates with a
reversionary value of £4,773,000 were distributed
amongst A.M.P. members. Did YOU share in that
distribution? No? Why not? Surely you are missing a great
opportunity to make your future comfortable and secure?
One member who took out a £5OO policy in 1903 found that
his share of the distribution brought the sum assured to £973.
Another member who took out a £l,OOO policy in 1891 found
that the sum assured is now £2,332.
A young husband, who began investing £7/17/11 a year in a
£5OO policy the day he got his first “job” in 1924, finds that
he and his wife have a policy for £633.
Over 1,040,000 policies, assuring £223,000,000 are now held
by members for the purpose of providing security (and peace
of mind) in one form and another. Membership is open to
all men and women who are in good health, and the advice of
a certain carpenter to his assistant is sound for all: “Become a
member of the A.M.P. when you are young, lad,” he said.
“Don’t put it off. The younger you are when you join, the
less you will have to invest each month to get your benefits
later on.”
That advice is as good for the merchant and the countryman
as for the boy or girl beginning life in a city office.
The Society will gladly send an experienced counsellor to
advise you, or will send a copy of “Investing in Happiness”
if you prefer.

revival in the building trade. Still, owing
to keen competition, the co. was able to
squeeze only £2662 of profit (= 3.5 p.c.
on capital) out of the larger trading, and
shareholders got a 3 p.c. div., the first
thing of its kind for over half a dozen
years. Prospects of their remaining in
the picture are fairly good. But
the market notes the competition, which
means price-cutting, and the lOs.-paid
shares are offered at Bs. At that figure
the return is 3.7 p.c. on a 3 p.c. div. basis,
or 5 p.c. on a 4 p.c. distribution. The net

Both mineowners and workers lost a
very able and diplomatic manager in C.
J. Emery, who died at Broken Hill last
week, following an attack of pneumonia.
Born at Campbelltown (S. Aus.) in 1876,
he went to the Barrier 20 years later as
timekeeper on the British, of which he
became g.m. in 1912. When the North
bought the British in 1923, Emery re-
mained in charge of that section until
he stepped into the g.m.’s chair at the
North in 1927, when George Weir re-
tired. He was also president of the
Mine Managers’ Association, and of
recent years did a lot of valuable work
in straightening out industrial problems
at the Barrier.

Hogden’s Shoalhaven Gold, N.L., is a
Sydney float with possibilities, though
many would like to have seen a more
thorough testing of the ground before
the show was pul on the market.
Nominal capital is £lOO,OOO in ss. shares,
of which 300,000 are offered ; the vendors
(G. E. Hogden and W. Dicks) take 50 ? 000
paids, plus £lO,OOO cash, and 50,000
shares are in pickle. It is proposed to
call the contribs. to 3s. each, and, after
paying the vendors, brokerage (£3750
= 3d. per share), preliminary exes.
(£400) and spending £25,000 on a bucket
dredge and monitors, which are to handle
30,000 c.y. weekly, £5850 will be avail-
able for working capital and develop-
ment. T. Yeomans, who used to be with
Placer in New Guinea, estimates that the
ground (it is on the Shoalhaven River,
about 40 miles from Goulburn, N.S.W.)
contains 7,000,000 c.y. of 9d. dirt (gold
at £8 an ounce Australian currency), plus
a probable 5,000,000 c.y. of similar
gravel. On a turnover of 1,500,000 c.y.
p.a. there is five years’ work in the more
or less proved ground. All-in costs are put
at 3d. a yard, or £18,750 p.a. The pros-
pectus allows £20,000 p.a. for amortisa-
tion of capital, leaving £17,500, equal to
over 30 p.c. on a paid capital of £57,500.
Some of the gold is very fine, which
means that it may be difficult to recover
it all. The Haven co. is putting in a
dredge on an adjoining property, and
Oroville, an English concern, is testing
other adjacent ground.

“Pack Saddle”: Reference in the daily
press to the “worked-out” nature of
the Palmer River (N.Q.) alluvial gold-
field leaves the impression that all is
over with that area. Nothing is further
from the truth, and it would be a shame
if such statements crippled efforts to
revive activity there. On the Upper
Palmer, where all the rich stuff came
from, there remains ten times as much
auriferous gravel as ever came out of it.
What is needed is capital and the right
kind of machinery to work it. It can
neither be dredged nor elevated, and
there are only four months in which work
can be carried out, owing to excessive
water for six, and utter lack of it for
two more, months every year. Get the
machinery up there and things will
brighten as of yore.

New Queen Cross, the first of the old
Towers mines (N.Q.) to be successfully
unwatered, has been optioned by G.
Wilkie-King, who intends to form a new
co. to work the show. In its palmy days,
when the gold was worth about £3 15s.
an ounce, this mine hoisted 7688 tons of
ore, which yielded £68,000. Recent
examination and testing have disclosed
at least 10,000 tons of stone, expected to
average half an ounce.

Old Warden”: Gold-stealing has been
prevalent for some time in New Guinea.
Recently Bulolo Gold Dredging, whose
alluvial gold has been the easiest mark,
brought a detective from Sydney and
put him on the job as a worker to find
out what he could—a trick tried with
success on the Towers and at Mount
Morgan in the long ago. The result was
that two men were convicted. After
reaching Rabaul, the plunder was
shipped to Hong Kong and the China
coast.

Murchison Gold Development Ltd
is to be put off the stocks in London this
week with a nominal capital of £450 000
in ss. shares. Of these 400,000 are to
be offered to Great Boulder Prop’s
shareholders, and 100,000, which have
been underwritten, and 300,000 are to be
put on the Australian and London
markets respectively. The issue carries
an option, until the end of 1935, of one
new share at par for every two taken
now. The vendors, Claude de Bernales
and Great Boulder, divide £31,500 cash
and 400,000 paids, this being the con-
sideration for the Emu and Riverina pro-
perties, etc., at Lawler and Mulline (W.A.).
The Emu comprises the old Great East-
ern and Waroonga groups, which, between
1899 and 1931, produced approximately
132,4870 z. of gold from about half a
million tons. Riverina has recovered
19,3310 z. from 29,000 tons. Both were
hopelessly unpayable ventures before the
price of gold soared.

The prospects of Hannan’s Hill Amal-
gamated (it used to be Hannan’s Reward)
are being investigated with a view of
putting the show on the London market.
The Reward, which is on a rise over-
looking Hannan-street, Kalgoorlie (W.A.),
was originally floated in London in
1902, but, after paying one 10 p.c. div.
and reconstructing, it was handed over
to tributors. Later a local syndicate car-
ried on. W. H. Corbould was one of its
earliest managers.
* * * *
Boulder Perseverance is putting on
financial weight. At the end of 1933 it
had, in addition to mine and equipment
valued at £50,000, cash amounting to
£30,037 ; Government securities, £59,547 ;
stores, £20,000; miscellaneous, £ll,OOO.
A div. has since absorbed £32,758, which
is more than offset by profits earned
during the expired months of this year.
Sundry creditors figured for £12,721, and
£25,125 had been set aside for redemp-
tion of the £36,045 of 10 p.c. profit-
sharing notes, due 1936.

Wiluna has extracted and treated
about a million and a quarter tons of ore
from its big Westralian mine for a yield
of nearly 350,0000 z. of gold. Monthly
production is now worth approximately
£95,000 in Australian currency. One
div. (10 p.c.) has been paid to date, but
another and more substantial one is
expected shortly.
* * * *
Interested people are whooping about
the wealth awaiting extraction from the
Kanowna (W.A.) gold-bearing pug, and
shares in the Adelaide syndicate floated
to treat the stuff are fetching a sub-
stantial premium on the market. Results
from a new process are said to be more
than satisfactory. According to the
Westralian Mines Dept., it is just as much
lack of gold as difficulty of extraction
that has rendered treatment unpayable
in the past.

Ora Banda Amalgamated’s property at
Grant’s Patch (W.A.) is opening up
nicely. From the Nicholson - lease 694
tons averaged over 25dwt. Including the
stuff from Hall and McKenzie’s leases,
1132 tons of development ore from upper
workings averaged over 22dwt. Plans
are being prepared for an all-sliming
plant to treat 1200 tons monthly. It is
expected to be ready before the end of
this year, and will include 10 heads of
12501 b. stamps, corduroy strakes, Dorr
classifier, tube mill and Oliver filter.
Crude-oil engines will supply the power.

On the recommendation of mining-
engineer Albert Faul, the Bega Co., of
Adelaide, has taken an option over Hack,
Kingswood and Howie’s old Imperial
mine at Widgiemooltha, 70 miles s.-w.
of Kalgoorlie (W.A.). The vendors have
taken out and crushed over- 1000 tons
of ore. In the same district
Western Mining Corp. has optioned
Solly brothers’ mine, which contains a
large body of low-grade stuff.

“Oof Bird”: Rand gold-mining profits
now exceed 2\ millions sterling a month.
The average grade of ore treated by one
group in April was more than a penny-
weight lower than that treated in Dec.,
1932, before the gold value of the S.
African pound note was reduced. Avail-
able ore reserves of the 11 mines in this
group at the end of 1933 would have
been only 33,500,000 tons with gold at
85s. an ounce ; actually they were up-
wards of 53,000,000 tons, an increase of
nearly 59 p.c.

“Morning Glory”
At the State. It emphasises once more
the contempt Hollywood has for stage
stars. Katherine Hepburn, when she first
makes up her mind to emulate Sarah
Bernhardt and the other celebrities whose
portraits are in the foyer of a theatre
she visits, is little better than a half-wit.
The inane chatter which she keeps up
right through the picture makes her part
a very big one as regards word-footage ;
but it is trivial on the emotional side.
For the umpteenth time we are shown a
stage-struck lass from the U.S.A. back-
blocks who makes an idiot of herself
amongst the sophisticated Bohemians of
a great city and establishes herself at the
top of the theatrical tree when a tempera-
mental leading lady lets the manager
down. She differs chiefly from previous
interpreters of the part in making the
girl sillier than usual.
A great deal of rubbish is written and
talked in Australia about the deleterious
effect on the young of nudity in
films. There isn’t much nudity in this
one, but it is more effective propaganda
for promiscuity than any b droom or
ballet sequence that was ever rut by Mr.
O’Reilly. Katherine Hepburn gets drunk
at the home of the manage., Adolphe
Menjou, and, in the ranci ly genteel
euphuism of the blurb-,/riter, “a
romantic episode ensues.” In plain
English, he spends the night with
her. Next morning his only thought
is to get rid of her. He explains the
situation to a playwright (Douglas Fair-
banks, jun.) who depends on his favors,
and the matter is adjusted. The episode
isn’t even true to life. Eminent theatrical
managers, such as Menjou portrays, can’t
afford to seduce befuddled flappers and
talk about it afterwards, and the kind of
girl who wins fame doesn’t make herself
cheap in that particular way. But how
are the Hepburn’s girl-worshippers to
know such facts?
Menjou is appealing in a part which
would have been played on Mephisto-
phelian lines in pre-talkie days, and
Douglas Fairbanks does as much as any-
one could with his invidious role. There
is only one member of the cast who
portrays a complete human being—C.
Aubrey Smith, a decent old trouper who
tries to save the girl from herself. What
an artist the man is! When he is vis-a-
vis the heroine her artificialities become
genuinely pathetic.
“Murder on the Blackboard”
Edna May Oliver and James Gleason
collaborate again in this low comedy
horror film. Everything happens as
before —the discovery of the body, the
waggish behavior of Mr. Gleason in the
house of death, the guilty demeanor of
the innocent characters, the preternatural
ingenuity of Miss Oliver’s deductions and
the assumption of all the credit for them
by Mr. Gleason as Inspector Piper.
Bruce Cabot, Regis Toomey and Jackie
Searle are in the cast.
“Bitter Sweet”
This Melbourne Athenaeum picture is
the most elegant British production that
present critic has surveyed. On the
spectacular side it moves with the proud
confidence of a luxury motor-car. Were
a theatregoing Rip Van Winkle to see it
he would be staggered at the beauty of
the settings, the perfection of the acting
and the general suavity of Herbert Wil-
cox’s conception. Compared with it
J.C.W.’s stage confection, with its physi-
cal limitations, was an amateur perform-
ance.
On the dramatic side its chief fault
is a tendency to prolong emotional situa-
tions. The eye tires quickly when con-
fronted with photographed lovers
engaged in extended flirtations, however
beautiful the leading lady or handsome
the lover. While the story is moving,
however, nothing could be more satisfy-
ing in the realm of romantic fiction.
Anna Neagle makes an extraordinarily
convincing Sari Linden, the constant
fluttering of her hands suggesting the
temperament of a girl on the verge of
a neurosis. This realism is appropriate
while she is the virginal creature un-
decided whether to obey the dictates of
her parents and marry a rich English
husband or bolt with a poverty-stricken
music-teacher of foreign extraction. She
drops it when she becomes the conven-
tional heroine of romance, sacrificing all
for love in a cabaret in Vienna.
This mixture of realism and romance
is Noel Coward’s private recipe. Just
when you think he is getting sloppily
sentimental he drops in a bit of realistic
acid, and vice versa. In real life the
girl would probably have wanted to go
off with the dashing cavalry officer, since
her fiddle-playing husband was obviously
a failure. But she doesn’t; the husband
slaps the soldier in the face, the soldier
passes his sword through the fiddler’s
appendix and a musical romance breaks
in waves of pathos on the bitter coasts
of tragedy.

Baer-Carnera Fight
Two of the worst boxers who ever took
part in a world championship event are
on view at the Empress. Jack Johnson —
to name only one heavyweight whom
Australia has seen —would have extermi-
nated either of them in very short order.
In ways, the clash resembles the Burns-
Johnson one ; Camera is virtually settled
in the first round ; his conqueror never
stops jeering at him ; and he takes his
hiding with splendid courage. Whereas
Bill Squires had a glass jaw, Camera
seems to have a glass occiput; most of
Baer’s lethal haymakers land on the
back of his head, or thereabouts.
Camera is wide open for seconds at a
time in every round; but then so is
Baer. It is interesting to watch them and
imagine what a hard-hitting precisionist
like Sam Langford would have done if he
had been given such openings ; but in
itself the fight is curiously uninteresting.
The highlights are Camera’s stolid
bravery and Baer’s flashness and tigerish
will to win.
In addition to the fight picture, there
is a first-class British thriller at the
Empress in which such accomplished
veterans as Bromley Davenport and
Clarence appear.
“Evergreen”
A British musical comedy at the Em-
bassy, which can show several points to
Hollywood.
Opening in London in 1909, we see the
retirement of Harriet Green (Jessie Mat-
thews), a popular music-hall star. She
has promised her hand to a Marquis.
But the father of her illegitimate child
threatens trouble, and she clears out to
South Africa, leaving the infant under
the care of a nurse.
A quarter of a century passes. Har-
riet is dead, and we see the daughter
(Jessie Matthews) following in her
mother’s footsteps. A publicity agent
(Barry Mackay) conceives the idea of
palming her off as her mother. Sonnie
Hale agrees to back the deception, and
London is placarded with the news of the
reappearance of Harriet Green.
The fraud leads to all sorts of com-
plications—the girl’s blackmailing father,
the Marquis, and the publicity man all
being drawn in.
Jessie Matthews has never been gayer.
Sonnie Hale and Barry Mackay are also
admirable. But that was to be expected ;
the chief subject for praise and wonder
is the new plot.
“Channel Crossing,”
Which won high praise from The
Bulletin’s Melbourne critic last week,
is also at the Embassy.
“Springtime for Henry”
A comedy of Restoration vintage in
a 1934 bottle, based on a play by the
London dramatist Benn Levy, and on
view at the Capitol.
Otto Kruger is a wealthy Lothario.
Believing that Nancy Carroll has lured
him into a compromising situation so
that her husband can blackmail him, he
transfers his attentions to his secretary,
Heather Angel. To make it clear that
she had no part in the plot the married
lady rushes to Kruger’s apartment and
takes off her clothes in his bedroom,
only to be coldly reproved. At the same
time, her husband is flirting with the
secretary—a widow who is the murderess
of her late husband. It ends in a matri-
monial shuffle, facilitated by divorce.
The action drags despite desperate
attempts to introduce excitement, and
the dialogue at its best is only mildly
funny. Nigel Bruce’s smooth perform-
ance as a philandering husband is the
brightest spot.
“No More Women”
Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen
are deep-sea divers engaged in the salvage
of sunken treasure. Their ship falls into
the possession of beauteous Sally Blane.
Both fall for her, and she keeps them
at a reasonable distance by pretending
to each that she adores the other. Lowe
gets gaoled for assassinating McLaglen
during a ride on a switchback railway,
and McLaglen (who merely fell into the
sea and hid under a wharf) lets him stay
there for a week. But when a treacher-
ous diver from another ship cuts Lowe’s
air-tube McLaglen goes below and
rescues his rival. Miss Blane calls at the
hospital and rejects them both, where-
upon they swear the oath that gives the
comedy its title.
Underwater scenes are cleverly faked,
and the heartiness and frequency with
which Messrs. Lowe and McLaglen
belabor each other redeem the romance
from flatness.
Sundry Shows
Packed houses are surveying “Mother
of Pearl” at Melbourne Princess. There
are so many: good things in A. P. Her
bert’s piece that present critic, with
characteristic, benignity, overlooked some
of the weaknesses in his initial remarks
on the opus. Most of these have now
been eliminated, and the show appears
to have been shortened by at least 20
minutes. _ One of the items missed on a
second inspection was the public un-
dressing of the leading lady, which went
awry on the first night with what might
have been disastrous, and were at least
mildly exciting, consequences. Presum-
ably Thring decided that the gain wasn’t
worth the gamble. The Delysia defi-
nitely improves on acquaintance. There
is nothing this charming Frenchwoman
does that is without significance. The
second act is the chief weakness in the
play. It is in the mood of tragedy, and
unreal tragedy at that. Miss Delysia
was not built for tragedy. As the un-
happy mother cherishing the memory
of the love-child she hasn’t seen for 20
years she is distinctly over the odds, but
as the cheerful philanderess she fills the
bill, and more than fills it. Robert Coote
deserves more than the scant attention
he received last week. His performance
in the last scene is as brilliant a bit of
sustained fooling as any of the lady’s.
Bendigonian Phyllis Glen impresses as
the heroine, and Cecil Scott continues to
command no respect as the hero. If
Oscar Straus brought an injunction
against the singers of his melodies he
would secure a verdict from any jury
of musical citizens.

“White Horse Inn” put up its shutters
at Sydney Royal on Saturday night, and
the house is occupied by mechanicians
getting ready for “The Gay Divorce,”
which will celebrate the return to Aus-
tralia of Madge Elliott and Cyril
Ritchard next Saturday. The Cri. stage
is still exposed to “The Wind and Rain,’
a storm that shows no signs of slacken
ing. Musically the biggest event on the
horizon is Florence Austral’s season,
commencing at the Town Halt on
August 11.


THE CUCKOO IN THE NEST.
“John Anderson, the pacifist Professor, though his Chair of Philosophy at Sydney University is partly subsidised by the State, claims that he is entitled to use it
to advocate disarmament.”
AUSTRALIA: “Advocate what you like, mate; it’s a free country. But use your own soapbox.”


ABORIGINALITIES
“Kisumu”: Some amateur naturalist
has been writing to a Sydney paper
claiming that he has on his property an
ants’ nest whose inhabitants know and
respect him. When he sits down on
their nest they run all over him
in friendly fashion, but never attempt
to bite. Several colonies of ants only
a little distance off attack him fero-
ciously if he goes near. It recalls an ex-
perience of my own in the Belgian Congo.
I had got on such good terms with a
number of robber-ants that, in considera-
tion of my putting out daily rations for
them, they let my sugar and other luxuries
alone. One day when I was bathing in
the river a horde of leaf-cutting ants cut
my only suit of clothing—a shirt and
shorts —into tiny pieces and took them
to their nest. I managed to convey the
news to my mercenaries. They imme-
diately pursued the robbers to tneir
stronghold and brought back the bits of
cloth. Not content with this, they
“Think ’ell, let you in?”
“Well, ’e can’t chuck me out unless ’e does.”
promptly enlisted the services of another
species of ant which sews leaves together
for nests with silk supplied by its own
larvae, and when I woke up next morning
there was my clothing fit to wear again—
a little bizarre in appearance, certainly,
but that matters little to he-men of the
wilds.
“Homby”: The question whether
birds use the same nest for a succession
of seasons is answered in the affirmative
by a pair of peewits which, at Confrey’s
Tank, near Naraduhn (N.S.W.), have
stuck to the one cradle for at least 11
years. The female bird had a leg broken
by a pea-rifle bullet (aimed at a crow)
in ’22. The birds have patched and
titivated the old home before each
seasonal occupation, and probably little
of the original material is left. A result
of these yearly renovations is that the
nest is nearly four times the ordinary
size.
“Jim G.”: Apropos “Cam Cove's”
fish in the ’Bidgee irrigation channels
(B. 4/7/’34). Each winter the draining
of these channels brings a finny harvest
to settlers and workmen living close by.
Last year two men secured a haul which
netted £2O. Swimming against the
current the fish had become impounded
in a depression caused by the water
rushing over a regulator. When the
rice-fields are drained off carp perish in
thousands, and ibises, cormorants and
crows gorge on a fresh-fish diet for
weeks.
“Blueskin”: Early-Australian menus
often included dishes as strange as those
Elizabethan spreads (B.
11/7/’34). Setting aside the
crows to which the first
South Australians are said
to have resorted for pro-
vender, wombat hams were
once a recognised delicacy.
Another favorite dish with
the early hands was said to
be the echidna. Considering
that the spiny little beast
lived on nothing but ants,
and that other ant-living
animals are uneatable for
this reason, the yarn is pro-
bably in the fiction class.
Kangaroo-tail soup has sur-
vived to our own day.
Writer, much exposed to if
in his youth, could never stomach the
rankly-flavored stuff.
* * * *
“Sa Tiko”: “Bauwa” (B. 20/ 6/ ’34)
doesn’t surprise me with his information
that the Poly-Melanesians are copying
the deceit of the white maramas in the
matter of quick-change hair colors. They
don't stop at this imitation, either. I
remember six young Fijian maramas
visiting a draper’s shop to buy them-
selves a princess-slip each. “Big fella
warship coming in to-morrow,” they ex-
plained. But in the matter of hair-dye,
the original reason for rubbing in the
lime-paste was to sa mate, or kill the
“too plurry many itchy fella” —and not
to discolor the hair. Only the men used
the paste ; it was tabu to the women,
like drinking kava or being over-friendly
with the man next door.
* * *
“Cachalot”: This being the season
when whales of many kinds are skirting
the N.S.W. coast on their way to the
breeding-grounds in the warm waters of
the tropic north, the Sydney press has
been spreading itself on the subject.
Some humpbacks were attacked by
killers off the Heads the other day —the
last time a scrap of the kind occurred
the killers’ antagonist was referred to
as a “huge sperm whale” —and much
play was made of the “spouting ’ and
“bellowing.” The idea that whales
squirt large quantities of water
like fire-engines is dashed hard to kill.
The filmy “spout” is the whale’s
warm breath congealing in the colder
atmosphere as it is ejected from the
nostril or nostrils. Further, whales have
no vocal organs, and none of the scien-
tists or practical whalemen I have come
in contact with have ever heard the big
fellows make a vocal noise that would
do credit to Mickey the .Mouse. The
“bellowing” is either imagination or the
reverberation of the water beaten by the
great flat tail thrashing in an endeavor
to beat off the killers.

“Trepang”: The pro. at our Q. golf
club missed balls from his room, and
“Ever have any children, Jacky?”
“No pfear, missus. Mary hab ’em.”
stayed back at night thinking to trap an
erring caddie. Shortly after sunset a 19ft.
carpet-snake emerged from a small hole
in the floor, made for the counter on
which the balls were displayed and
helped itself to three of the best. At the
post-mortem 21 balls were found in its
stomach, and some must have been there
six weeks. They are now in use.
❖ ❖
“Walkabout”: With the first nip of
winter Combo, our half-caste stockman,
strutted round in his ’possum-skin vest.
“It would keep you warmer, Combo,”
said the boss, “if you wore it with the fur
inside.” “No fear,” replied Combo. “That
feller ’possum he wearem all the same
this feller; reckon ’possum ought to
know!”
“Ibn el Issar”: A pretty story of a
native baby playing with a cobra is borne
on the cables from India. The snake, coiled
round the child, playfully dodged the
infant’s attempts to grab its
spread hood; onlookers stood
by terrified and unable to inter-
fere until the snake got bored
and cleared out. The evidence
points to the happening taking
place in a Hindoo community.
No Hindoo would dare to
attempt to rescue the child by
killing the snake, sacred and
near to a godhead. In any case,
the child was probably in no
danger. Only one or two of
the poisonous snakes are actively
antagonistic to • humans or
other animals too large for
their food. Provided they are taken
gently and not frightened by abrupt
movements, nearly all snakes can be
handled with impunity by comparative
neophytes.

“T.H.M.”: Re the water-bearing
mallee. A South Aus. police trooper,
making towards the Westralian border
with a black-tracker, asked for water.
The native passed many specimens of this
stunted tree, but at length pulled up at
one, apparently no more suitable than
the others. From this he broke off pieces
of root and upended them into the quart
pot. The explanation was that the un-
suitable mallees showed signs of leaky
roots ; those without evidence of grass
or growth of any kind along the root-
lines were the water-bearers.
“Felis”: I denied, not the existence
of the spotted “native-cat”—really a clasy-
ure—but that of a hitherto unknown sub-
species of the Felidce named by its alleged
discoverers “tiger-cat” (B. 11/7/’34).
The concerted yowls of half a dozen
protagonists of the mythical creature in
one issue of The Bulletin leave me
cold. Not one has offered to produce a
“tiger-cat,” the only evidence offered that
such animals exist in Australia being the
unsupported vaporings of tale-pitchers.
The extraordinary Australian fauna
has attracted the close attention of the
world’s leading naturalists and other
scientists from the day the country was
discovered. Many of them have visited
and toured Australia. None has been
able to discover and describe an indi-
genous member of the genus Felis. No
zoo or museum in Australia or abroad
has ever contained a specimen of this
phantom creature which has been iden-
tified as a true cat and native to Aus-
tralia. The discovery of a true cat south
of Wallace’s line would intrigue the
scientific world, and great would be the
monetary reward for the finder. Person-
ally, I offer to eat raw any specimen iden-
tified by proper authorities as a member
of the cat family indigenous to this
country and not merely an extra-big
example of the domestic cats whose
forebears have gone bush and thrived on
the change. •

“Barang”: “Python” (B. 27/6/’34) is
right; snakes can, and do, eject half-
finished meals at will. Four years ago
in Negri-Sembilan I came across what
appeared to be a first-class jungle tragedy.
Two pythons had seized a small mouse-
deer simultaneously and proceeded to
swallow it. When their jaws met the
larger one started to swallow his com-
panion, and had absorbed about four
feet of it when we arrived. With yells of
joy my Malays broke off small saplings
and commenced to beat the larger snake
across the head, explaining that two
live pythons at 50 cents a foot were
better than one dead and one alive. In
two minutes the smaller python had
been disgorged and both held captive
“Johnny H.”: Yes, snakes can unload
a meal at will. All reptiles gorge dur-
ing the summer and autumn to fatten
themselves for the long sleep. As the
cold weather approaches they prepare
their winter quarters, usually a burrow
in loose earth or sand that will fall in on
them after they have settled down. When
all is ready, they vomit everything left
in the stomach, which often con-
tains remnants of their last victims ; this
is done because their digestive organs
don’t function during the hibernating
period.
“Yarragundry” : While a telephone-line
extension was being made in the Tallan-
gatta Valley (N.S.W.), the linesmen saw
a jackass caught in the swan-neck loop
which holds the wires to the post. Pre-
suming him dead, they left him. Six days
later they found Jack still there. A
mechanic mounted a ladder to remove
the bird. When throwing it down he
thought he felt a flutter ; much to his
surprise, Jack spread his pinions and flew
wobbily away to water, followed by
friends. Quenching a thirst a toper
would have envied, Jack and retinue flew
to a near-by tree and roused the valley
with a thanksgiving chorus. The lines-
men reckon the bird had been fed by
its mates while a prisoner.
BACK TO THE COWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We are scattered the continent over;
We come from the ends of the earth;
On creek flat and upland and hillsides
You’ll find us, from Gympie to Perth.
1 here’s only one precept to guide us,
One rule no amendment allows:
i on can go on the bust, but you certainly must
Get back, soon or late, to the cows.
You’ll find us by day in the township,
At market and counter and bar;
You’ll find us at work in the paddocks,
But later, wherever we are,
The shops and the bars and the pavement,
The fernhook, the axe and the ploughs,
We’ve gone from them all, and wherever you
call
You’ll find that we’re back to the cows.
We climb into bed in the evening
And reach in a moment, it seems,
I'o the exquisite uplands of fancy,
The castles we build in our dreams;
And the lustreless facets of daytime
The night with rare color endows.
But the first grey of day wipes the rainbow
away
And it’s time to get back to the cows.
And the Prince of the Pit he will wonder
What causes his fires to abate,
And he’ll angrily call to his minions
And point to the gaps on the grate,
Till the imps from their dens come a-trembling
And wiping the sweat from their brows,
And the boldest explains “Not a farmer
remains,
For they had to get back to the cows.”

A. G. BURNET.


“Bukshi Sahib”: Interesting to an old
hand to note how India is moving with
the times. When I was Resident in the
little Native State of Jimjamathala the
Maharajah Sahib was accustomed to rid
himself of inconvenient heirs and other
rivals in the fashion of his ancestors.
He generally had them stiffened with
white arsenic in curry or trampled to
death by the two State elephants. My
protestations were rewarded with the
poisoning of my cook —I always made
him taste his preparations in my presence
—and an attack by the Maharajah’s
troupe of fighting apes, which somehow
escaped from their cages as I was leaving
the palace. These and various other
indications that I had fallen into dis-
favor induced me to resign. The modern
method, according to the cables, is to
invite the unwanted person to take a
stroll by night in the gardens of the
palace. A pack of dogs does the
rest. Alsatians, of course; so the
entire blame falls on them, and
there is nothing more to be said. In
the particular case 1 have in mind, the
eaten person was a cousin of the ruling
potentate. Indian potentates do not, as
a rule, have much time for near-relations.

“Spinifex”: For exuding a vile odor
I'll back crushed saltbush against any-
thing that grows. A handful of it smells
like a shipload of stinking fish, and puts
dogwood and wattle-seeds (“W.P.T.,”
B. 27/6/’34) well into the shade. My next
entry is the gidya scrub on a wet night.
This is pretty hard to beat; a newchum
Englishman once told me that the smell
made him violently ill.
“Rindy”: Eighteen months ago a
friend 400 miles away sent me a four-
weeks-old puppy cattle-dog which
could never have barked beyond an in-
fantile yap. The other day the friend
did the journey, too, and I met him at
the station. I stopped to chin-wag with
a resident, while my visitor, a stranger to
the district, walked on; “Well,” I
said as I overtook him, “you’re on the
right road, but how’d you know which
way to go?” “I heard your dog bark!”
he said. “Why, you couldn’t have heard
that dog bark before!” I exclaimed. He
staggered me with a quiet “No, but he
barks just like his father ; and I own
his father, don’t I?”
* * *
“Sluice”: That bush substitute (B.
11/7/’34) for a wash-basin—a hole dug
in the ground and made water-
tight by paper or some other
material—is a pretty ancient
one, and popular to this day
among soldiers on active service
where drinking water is too
precious to permit of streams or
pools being polluted by bath-
ing. I first struck it during the
S’African war, and it could be
seen during any halt in the
Sinai-Palestine campaign. The
rubber “ground sheet” issued to
all ranks was the standby in
these cases. After the hole was
dug the sheet was used to line
it, and what water was to be got
poured in.

“4 x 2”: My knowledge of canine
idiosyncrasies is much broader than
“Trevdee’s” (B. 30/5/’34). Motor-
cyclists (I’m one) are fair game to
most; I’ve sampled the mongs of four
States, and some have sampled me, but
only once per dog. Bananaland special-
ises in “Blueys” which rush from gates
and intercept the cycle. N.S.W. breeds
a type which chases vehicles apparently
for exercise—met one once that kept it
up for a mile. Victorian hounds are in-
different, a supercilious glance usually
satisfying their curiosity. Tassie has the
least troublesome; the law demands
strict control, and prescribes the right to
shoot trespassing hounds. Kicking hurts
the kicker. Preferable is a trenching-tool

handle (ex-military pattern) mounted by
spring clips on the handle-bars. Use the
steel-shod end for large and vicious
brutes and the light end for ordinary
yappers. I never have to treat the same
dog twice.
“Marcine”: Working on a forestry
job in the Circular Head district (Tas.),
one of my mates refused to cut black-
wood trees or even to handle a slash-
hook with a blackwood handle. Five
years ago he contracted blackwood itch,
and, although he is supposed to be cured
of it, if he comes in physical contact
with even the seasoned timber the com-
plaint becomes active again.
* * * *
“No. 6”: An argument has been rag-
ing in Sydney as to whether the stubble
quail lives on grain, as its farmer-enemies
allege, or on insects, as its backers claim.
One of the controversialists says it lives
entirely on grain and seeds. In proof he
cites 20 birds which he shot for examina-
tion. Ten of these he dissected himself
“Nice an’ comfy down here
out o’ the wind, ain’t it, Alf?”
and the other 10 went to the Sydney
Museum. Of those he post-mortemed not
one contained insects. The Museum
reported, on the other hand, that not
one of the 10 it examined con-
tained anything but insects. The truth
seems to be that the quail, like
all the gallinaceous birds, is omnivorous.
Writer’s opinion, founded on some weeks
of shooting the little chap in the barley
crops of Western Egypt after The Evacua-
tion, is that he eats shed seeds as well
as insects. Walking through barley
literally alive with the birds, writer
cannot recall having seen one attacking
the ear on the stalk, as yellowhammers
and several other varieties of small birds
were constantly doing. As shed grain
is no use to the farmer, the quail eating
it becomes a benefactor instead of a
thief by preventing self-growing, that
bane of grain crops.
* * * *
“Pirinoa”: Driving into Gisborne
(xM.L.) I came upon Hori, busy with the
starting handle of an ancient Lizzie
which had stalled. Hori was all dressed
up—tan shoes, check trousers, heavy
double-breasted overcoat, stiff collar,
purple tie and hard hat. I asked if I
could help him, but he begged me not
to stop ; he understood the car’s little
ways and would soon get it going. Re-
turning the same way four hours later I
found him still busy, though both he and
his clothes showed signs of the struggle.
“Hallo, Hori,” I said ; “still here?” " I
get him going in a minute,” he again
bravely assured me. Then I noticed that
he was working in his socks, and my eyes
fell on his new tan shoes parked neatly
on the roadside. He saw me glancing
at them and grinned cheerfully. “Yes,”
he said, “I take him off. Frightened
I might kick te prurry cow.”
“Pawang”: An accidental experiment
on the operation of bird instinct is pro-
ceeding on Griffith Island, near Port
Fairy (Vic.). The Public Works closed the
river that separates the island from the
mainland. The island has been a haunt
of mutton-birds since time immemorial,
and mutton-birds are insular in their pre-
ference. There is no case on record
where they have dug their burrows on
a mainland. Up to date no old man of
the tribe has reported the plot against
the national traditions.

“Erne”: Anyone ever seen an Austra-
lian eagle take another bird in the air?
Victorian bird-lovers have been arguing
about it, and, barring one observer who
saw an eagle swoop on a shag, which he
missed, no one has yet produced any
evidence of the big fellow going after his
own kind. Yet in the days when plain
turkeys and swans, both big birds and
straight fliers, were as plentiful as eagles
in western Queensland there must have
been plenty of opportunities of seeing
such a capture if it ever came off. That
the eagle can field off the ground with
ease and dexterity many an unhappy
lamb’s fate goes to show. Writer has
seen eagles’ nest littered, not only with
fragments of lamb, but with those of
kangaroo-rats and wallabies, both much
more difficult to catch than the chap
which followed Mary to school.
“Purari”: With the price of copra and
rubber all to billyoh, Papua has been
in the doldrums lately. There has natur-
ally been a considerable amount of
excitement over the alleged discovery of
a five-toed pig in the Delta Division.
The ordinary pig has only two big toes
and two subsidiaries far up the leg. The
new discovery has five big toes. So
important is the find considered that the
local resident magistrate is to make a
special report on the pedal properties of
these animals, their abundance, fecundity
and general possibilities as a commercial
proposition. No one who knows the
demand for the ordinary two-toed pigs’
feet at Sydney hotel free lunches and in
the delicatessen shops of King’s Cross
can fail to realise the possibilities for
Papua lying in the breeding and export
of a five-toed variety.

“Pollywoggle”: “Arachne” (B. 9/5/’34)
on mosquito-trapping: “My recipe is to
encourage spiders about the house,
especially the gentlemen who build the
circular ‘geometrical’ web.” Wrong in
two places! First, Mrs. Arachne would
never allow spiders to build webs
about the house; secondly, the gentle-
man spider never builds a web. Apart
from that, I don’t approve of his method.
It might be likened to a man using a
drum net, while I employ the artistry of
a dry-fly fisherman.
“A.W.C.”: The people of southern
Tasmania have been perplexed by the
greenish color of the water in the upper
reaches of the Derwent. Carruthers,
M.H.A., says it is due to the snow on the
highlands taking up the coloring from
grass and carrying it down to the river.
A. N. Lewis ridicules this notion, and
avers that the tinting is due to algae and
infusoria, adding that scientific facts can
be relied on more than facts political.
Both authorities were combatants in the
State elections, standing for the same
seat, Perhaps some Aboliar will give a
casting vote.
“Bogaduck”: “Aplanges” first tells
me (B. 20/6/’34) that I have something
to learn about Aussie shellfish and then
goes on to say that he found the flesh
of the giant clam and mammoth cockle
of Northern Australia as tough as an old
motor-tyre. I admit my lack of know-
ledge of shellfish —all I did was to
recommend soup made from the scallop
of southern waters. lam not responsible
for the fact that northern , shellfish are
tough, nor am I to be blamed for the
fact that alligator steak will never be a
serious rival to baby-beef on the English
market. I likewise disclaim responsi-
bility for the fact that shags are not as
good to eat as black ducks, and have
never said that emu steak is as good as
jugged hare. I only recommended soup
made from scallops.
“Norway”: North-western Queens-
land is overrun with another plague of
rats —the last was in 1908. Now, as then,
they are doing everything Browning’s
rats did in “The Pied Piper,” including
the biting of babies in their cradles.
Houses and ttye countryside swarm with
them, and they dwell in amity with dogs
and cats, too fed up to kill them. They
are Australian indigenes, and that much
is to be said in their favor. The present
swarm began in 1932, and, like its pre-
decessor, is moving north to the Gulf
of Carpentaria. In due course all will
disappear there by drowning, since
neither river nor sea can change them
from their set course. Meantime, they
are eating all that comes in their way
and doing particular damage by ring-
barking the scanty forest of the n.-w.
plains. Vegetable gardens have been
eaten out, and even the chillies are taken,
the rats running backwards and forwards
to the adjacent creek after every bite at
the red-hot vegetable, if local yarns are
to be believed. Binghi, who gorged on
the newcomers when they first came,
cannot bear the idea of them now. Yet,
many years ago, these creatures were
looked on as rare and valuable speci-
mens, and scientific expeditions sought
eagerly for them.

By weather prophets, but I wish 1 knew
If one can charm a snake with music’s strains.
Bushmen and wanderers—l’ve seen a few—
Humping a sack that palpably contains
A host of wriggling captives, tell me true:
Are snakes amenable to music’s strains?

«/ He/p/n/netf/
T'HE P. & C. was the first Life Office in Australia to
apply Co-operation to Life Assurance. In adopting
this principle it undertook a policy of greater help-
fulness and service to members. The passing years have
proved how faithfully its aim has been carried out. The
spectacular growth of the Company proves how much
such a plan was needed and appreciated.
In joining the P. & C. you, too, may
enjoy the extra benefits of co-operation.

STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
MERINO TYPES.
“W.M.F.”: Sydney’s first sheep show
was held in 1895. Since then shows have
been held annually, except in 1931. A
study of the roll of grand champions will
tell the opponents of export that good
merino blood is not confined to Australia.
The champions of 1895-97-98, 1900-01-
02-04 were chiefly, in some cases purely,
American blood. Futhermore, to at least
1910, Vermont blood was much in evi-
dence. The recent show was not without
winners that derived at least some of
their strength from U.S.A.
Secondly, up to 1913 wrinkles and
folds carried the day. Most of the flocks
of Australia previous to the period
carried light fleeces, lacking in density.
The wrinkly rams imparted the density.
Since 1913 wrinkles and folds, now
usually termed “development,” have
been at a discount. The winner of to-day
is a plain-bodied animal with folds only
on the neck.
We may be going too far toward
plainness. The sheep shown arc stud
sheep, and there are still many flocks
that could with advantage carry denser
fleeces. The tendency to “fine out” in
hot climates must not be overlooked.
In “inside districts” where paddocks are
small and water always within easy reach
fine-woolled and delicate sheep are all
right. But it should not be forgotten
that these districts are even now turning
their eyes upon fat lambs and dairy cows.
The sheep that have made our name
and brought untold gold to Australia
are the big, bold fellows with medium to
strong staple, frames that will enable
them to travel and constitutions that will
bring them through hard times. In the
dry interior areas nothing can take their
place. It is because they recognise this
that breeders do not buy ribbons.
TREATING DUSTY CLIPS.
“Dead Finish”: Dusty-clip scouring
is a problem which every “further-out”
grazier should face.
Dust is a great price-reducer, but
whether to scour the whole clip or only
backs depends on the amount of dust in
the fleece and the demand for scoureds.
In a dry season backs are often so faulty
that the earthy stain remains on the skin
after shearing. Earthy wools should
always be scoured. Irt the open far-west
and n.-w. of N. S. Wales and central-
west and n.-w. of Queensland, it is im-
possible to run sheep without getting a
dusty tip, unless the season has been
more than favorable.
The appearance of the clip on the
show floor is the prime factor to be con-
sidered. The handling a bale of wool
receives in carting, trucking, etc.,
before reaching the store helps to
sift the dust from the tip through the
clean wool in the bale. Growers of
dusty wools often fail to recognise their
own product after transport. Earthy
matter is always more conspicuous than
clean wool when opened up. It is a
common sight to see woolbuyers shak-
ing samples over their catalogues to gauge
the dust in them.
The main arguments against scouring
locally are (1) the cost, and (2) the time
lost waiting for wools to be treated, with
the possibility of missing sales. And
accruing interest charges offset the freight
saving as between greasy and scoured
wools. In any case, the wool must even-
tually be scoured, and the buyer allows
for it when estimating his clean scoured-
yield valuation. Delay and interest are the
big obstacles for the small man. Most
people are in receipt of financial
accommodation. The man who is being
carried by a wool-selling firm is usually
told to send in his wool in the grease.
The more bales the bigger a firm’s busi-
ness looks. But it is not always good
business for the grower.
SORTING THE PIECES.
“Boka”; When classing the clip the
pieces should receive as much care as
the fleece wool, but in some small sheds
they are bundled into one straight line
with no pretence at sorting. This means
a sure loss to the grower, because no
woolbuyer likes lines of mixed pieces,
and they are bought by dealers who sort
them and resell at a profit.
Rig up a piece table—any home-made
kind that will let the fribby ends through
will do —to stand alongside the wool
table for the pieces to be thrown on to.
If they are dropped on to the floor they
are sure to get mixed with the locks,
and they are in the way of the man
working on the wool table. Two lines
of pieces are sufficient for a small clip,
one line of good clean pieces and the
other the shorter and dirty wool. If the
top line is a good length on no account
throw short pieces into the bin. Even
if they are clean and bright the short
pieces will only spoil the sale of the
longer wool. Keep the wool floor clean,
and do not let the pile of unsorted pieces
get too big.
FLOCK RAMS FOR GRAZIERS.
The N.S.W. Department of Agricul-
ture is continuing the policy, started two
years ago, of assisting owners of small
flocks to buy rams from registered stud
breeders. Graziers eligible for assistance
are those owning not more than 2000
breeding ewes. Maximum advance to
any one applicant is £5O 10s., plus
freight. There is a nominal limit of £4
4s. for each ram, but the £4 4s. may be
advanced towards the purchase of higher-
priced animals.
Repayment, with interest at 4 p.c. p.a.,
has to be made in two equal instalments
from the proceeds of the 1936-1937 and
1937-1938 seasons’ clips. Applicants
will be required to furnish orders on
such proceeds and a mortgage over the
rams, which are selected under the super-
vision of the sheep and wool branch of
the department. .
Application forms can be got from
the officer-in-charge, Rural Industries
Branch, Box 2706 C, G.P.0., Sydney.
DIPPING AND THE RESULTS.
“H.L.G.”: “W.D.McC.” (B 4/7/’34)
has scored almost a direct hit when he
describes dipping as the only preventive
of fly trouble. Although not the only
preventive, it is certainly the most eco-
nomical one. The job has to be done,
anyhow, so why not do it with an eye to
prevention of fly strike?
This season I have had two lots of
ewes of the same breeding (the only
difference being a year in their ages)
running in the same paddock. One lot
was dipped in an arsenical powder dip
and the other in a liquid dip. In the
first wave of fly trouble, one month after
dipping, percentages of strike in the two
mobs were 45 and 7, the smaller
number being in the lot dipped in the
powder dip. In a lighter wave, four
months after dipping, the figures were
14 p.c. and 3 p.c., with the smaller
number again in the powder-dipped lot.
This speaks for itself.
One point which has an important
bearing on the effectiveness of dipping
as a means of control of the fly pest is
the length of time between shearing and
dipping. The sheep must have sufficient
growth of wool to retain a fair amount
of dip. After machine-shearing six
weeks is necessary, arid a longer period
is advantageous. The strength of dip
used and the manner of dipping are also
important.
“Crutchem”: “W.D.Mc.” (B. 4/7/’34)
gives some striking illustrations of the
immunity from fly attack through dip-
ping in a powder dip. He was either
lucky or had dry, healthy sheep unattrac-
tive to the flies.
Having dipped mobs with a full-
strength powder dip, I have found that
some have been struck within four days
afterwards. I only dip to keep my flocks
free of lick and lice. The sheep always
get knocked about at this job, however
careful one is, and for this reason alone
I would never dip for fly.
Jetting doesn’t even give immunity
when the fly is bad, although the solu-
tion for this purpose is so much stronger
that if we dipped in a similar strength
we should find most of our sheep dead.
How does “W.D.Mc.” account for that?
The only control that I know against
fly attack is keeping the sheep healthy,
clean and constantly attended to. In
other words, hard graft is the best pre-
ventive.
OATS FOR FODDER.
“Granova”: Many graziers who own
farming plants could very profitably use
them more for growing oats for fodder.
This season in our district (Temora,
N.S.W.), sheepmen who sowed large
areas of oats have enough feed for their
ewes, whereas others are hand-feeding.
The light rains, of little use on grassland,
germinated the oats and kept them grow-
ing. When the grasshoppers swept
through the district, most of the oat
crops were spared, although all other
green feed was eaten. Oats can be put
in very cheaply ; on light soil they can
be sown straight in with a combine after
the stubble has been burnt.
In safe wheat districts oats can be fed
down till August, and then allowed to
grow up and be harvested for grain.
Crops left untouched until September
will, in a normal season, carry 10
sheep per acre until December. During
this period, pastures should be allowed
to seed, and the value of a reserve of
feed is apparent.
In many districts fat-lamb raising is
an impossibility on natural pastures, but
can be safely undertaken by providing
grazing oats for the ewes. In wet years
the usual waste of feed can be avoided
by keeping the stock on pastures and
allowing the oats to grow unchecked.
They can then be made into hay or
silage, or harvested for grain, and
valuable fodder reserves created.
A RABBIT DECOY.
“Valerin”: Here is a decoy which is
getting me satisfactory results in the
Riverina. The base is syrup, made in the
same manner as for preserving fruit and
of about the same consistency. To Boz.
add
Oil of cumin .. .. 20 drops
Oil of sandalwood .. .. 3 drops
Oil of pennyroyal .. .. 5 drops
Shake well to disperse these oils.
About 500 drops equals loz., and Boz.
of mixture is sufficient for 4000 baits.
Roots of black thistle which have not
started to run up make best baits. Cut
into short lengths according to thickness,
and wash in clean creek or dam water-
no/ water from a roof.
After washing do not touch with the
hands. As soon as baits are dry put into
an airtight tin (round for preference). Do
a thousand at a time. Gradually add 2oz.
decoy, shaking well to work through. Add
loz. finely-ground strychnine crystals and
again shake up thoroughly. Close down
lid and “sweat” for 18 hours.
Baits may be laid either in small holes
chipped out with mattock, or through
funnel of poison-cart. Do not cover up,
and put out with small pair of tongs.
To get best results care and cleanliness
are important. Keep tins washed out
• after each mixing, and do not smoke
while mixing or laying baits. Remove
and burn dead rabbits from the trails
every morning, and don’t put out baits
in showery weather.
I have not found it necessary to
remove stock from paddocks where baits
are laid.
CHOOSING NETTING.
“Albarmount”: Netting for fences
should be selected with an eye to dura-
bility and efficacy as well as price. The
18-gauge “B” grade is so pliable that
frequent working on the mesh bulges it
to twice its width. And kittens old enough
to maintain themselves have squeezed
through H x 17 “A” grade. Therefore
use the best —42 x x 17 “A” —for all
boundaries. Where areas are being
subdivided prior to digging out, the
36 x \\ x 17 “A” is cheaper and will pro-
vide sufficient baulk, and with a couple
of good wires above the netting you
have a very solid fence for many years
to come. A few rabbits will scale the
3ft. netting, but not enough to harm
unless the digging-out is unduly pro-
longed. However, if many gullies have
to be crossed the 3ft. 6in. should be
used.
CORRECTING THE BALANCE.
“Rich. J.”: Overstocking leads to soil
depletion and mineral deficiency.
The flesh, blood, bone and wool of
sheep contain sulphur, phosphoric acid,
soda phosphate, potassium chloride,
sodium chloride, iron oxide and phos-
phate, lime sulphate, lime phosphate and
carbonate, magnesia and silica.
To sustain these in the proper propor-
tions, sulphur, salt, lime, iron and mag-
nesium are needed.
Top-dressing pastures to bring back
the mineral qualities costs about 7s. or
Bs. per acre, and does not give quick
results.
In my judgment it is better to use a lick
containing all the necessary minerals.
This applies especially to dry districts,
where top-dressing may fail owing to lack
of sufficient rainfall to nourish tender
grass roots stimulated by artificial
manure.
A mineral lick costs a fraction com-
pared with manuring, and at the same
time sheep will pass back into the soil
any mineral matter exceeding their
demands. The results are a better lamb-
ing, bettef : quality wool and prevention
of internal parasites.
SELECTING SEED POTATOES.
“R.J.”: Now is the time to cull over
potato seed and prepare them for plant-
ing—in N.S.W., at all events. A good
plan, after sorting and eliminating
damaged and disease-infected tubers, is
to spread seed out at a shallow depth,.

preferably under shady trees. The tender
white shoots will be hardened by the
action of light and air, and incidentally
rendered tough and green.
Many farmers make the mistake of
rubbing off all sprouts growing at the
time of planting, but this is in most
cases fatal.
I have got the best results from sec-
tions of tubers weighing about Roz.
Portions showing weak buds should be
discarded altogether.
From now on until the crop is about
six inches high, harrow regularly every
week. If rain falls at this period harrow
immediately after the fall to prevent
ground baking, and also to imprison the
water precipitated.
Have found the best results to be ob-
tained from spacing 30in. between rows
and about 16in. between sets, using
17cwt. of certified seed to the acre.
PROTECTING BORE DRAINS.
“Dumpy”: When running levels for
bore drains, it pays to ease the pace of
the stream by turning at angles for a
hundred yards or so occasionally.
Sheep invariably drink running water
facing upstream. If the water is too fast
it causes ripples which are apt to run
into the nostrils. Therefore, sheep favor
calm stretches for drinking.
With cattle it pays to run a tap-stream
into a hole in the creek. The drain is
always higher than the creek-bed, and it
is merely a matter of shooting off any-
where that suits. Cattle do not like
drinking from a small, running stream.
They love to wade, wallow and splash.
A hole, particularly a shaded one,
provided for the cattle will protect the
drain unbelievably.
It pays ten times over to do the same
thing for horses. They are murder on
drains. They will paw and scratch, lie
and roll, and otherwise play the fool.
If there is no hole for them in which to
do those tricks, you can kiss your drain
good-bye, particularly at the beginning
and end of either summer or winter,
when Dobbin changes his coat and loves
to mitigate the itch with a good roll in
the sand or mud.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Namoli”: To remove banana-stain
use a strong solution of tan by soaking
wattle-bark in water.
“Billabong”: To coax Reynard to
the trap, take strained honey, }
drachm musk, 3 drachms oil of lavender
and 41b. tallow. Mix and make into pills.
Place one under the pan of the trap.
“Lion”: Dead wool adhering to the
bones tightly will blunt any knife, but
if you use a sharp tomahawk it will chop
off easily and cleanly. Gloves should
be worn for safety—heavy, cheap rubber
ones.
“Safety First”: When catching fly-
blown sheep always have your dagging
shears in a pouch until you are
ready to use them. I know one man
who lost an eye through his shears flying
up when he was struggling to turn over
a big cross-bred ewe.
“Eureka”: To prevent tools from rust-
ing dissolve one ounce of camphor in
two pounds of melted lard, and then add
enough blacklead to give the mixture an
iron color. Smear the tools with this
and leave them for a day or two, and then
rub well with a soft cloth. After this
treatment the tools will not rust. If they
are exposed to damp, repeat the process
every few months.
“Wrash”: If you want a potato-bin
that will automatically keep clean inside,
build your bin with two storeys, the
upper section 2ft. high. Floor it with
a frame of canary wire-netting on which
the potatoes will lie. Under the netting
have an easy-sliding drawer, 4in. deep,
that will catch and hold all dirt falling
through the mesh.
“Karaway”: If the haystack is in-
fested with mice, enclose it with sheets
of galvanised iron, placed lengthwise on
edge and a yard or so from the hay.
See that the sheets are well embedded,
and that there are no openings at the
ends and no stakes on the outside. Then
lean a board here and there from the
ground inside to the top of the iron for
the mice to get out. They have to go
out for water, and once out they can’t
get in again.
“Orchard Hand”: Many a grower has
had trees that won’t set their fruit,
though healthy. Get to them with the
back of the axe and belt the trunk,
bruising the bark well. This arrests the
too-free sap flow, and the tree should do
its job next season if it has the fertilis-
ing flowers near by.
“Spring” : To remove a bullet stuck in
a pea-rifle, put pieces of No. 8 wire, about
iin. long (longer pieces won’t do), down
the muzzle on top of each other until the
obstruction is reached. When one just
sticks out, drive it in with a fairly light
hammer. Place another short piece on
top, and continue as before until you
have driven the obstruction out.
”Jaen Eille”: Avoid complicated wool-
bale brands. A good brand is the owner’s
initials over the first letter of the station
name. Stencil in black on the bale in
block letters. Squares and circles and
letters in diamonds give trouble to your
broker, who has to include them in
records and catalogues.
“W.W.”: Growers of bush fruits in
some of the blackberry-infested districts
of the Speck are urging local councils to
make the eradication of the pest a muni-
cipal matter. But blackberry-gathering
keeps scores of families emplQyed during
the picking season, and councillors are
not enthusiastic about flinging so
many wayside harvesters on the dole. The
argument of the cultivators of raspberries
and currants is that the blackberries are
unfair competitors and are ruining legi-
timate business. A subsidiary grievance is
that the sodium chlorate used to deal
with the “curse” costs from 9d. to Is.
per pound.
“Airline”: “Haddington” (B. 27/6/’34)
got off lightly. Cramped paddocks, in
giving the fly more sheep to work on
in a given area, accentuate the trouble.
However, I think “Haddington” is for-
tunate in missing at least one fruitful
source of infection, i.e., timber. His
country (n.-w. Queensland) is to a great
extent treeless. And timber at least
harbors the fly. The worst offender is
wilga ; the offensive smell these trees give
off, especially in wet weather and while
flowering, is a great draw. Fly-traps in
their vicinity are a necessity.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
How to feed an Airedale puppy six months
old 7—2341.
Feed twice a day, and no food between meals!
Diet depends on animal’s condition. If the
pup is in poor flesh he should receive oatmeal,
rice or wholemeal bread in addition to meat.
If he is kept as a house dog, a mixed diet of
meat,' vegetables and cereals is the most satis-
factory. Raw meat is most essential for de-
velopment and health. Every alternate day the
pup should have one meal entirely of raw
meat. Don’t mince the food up; the dog
digests it better when given in chunks. This
applies even to potatoes.
(1) Is there any process by which waste
leather can be made into fertiliser for plants,
etc. ? (2) If so, has it been proved commer-
cially profitable and where ? (3) What is the
process 7 —2292.
(1) and (2) Shredded waste leather has been
treated in Europe with sulphuric acid, and the
product, an acidulated leather, has been sold
as a fertiliser, but experiments in England
have shown it to have little value. (3)
Several processes have been patented, and a
plant is to be erected in Australia to treat
leather by one of these methods.

secretary, Prickly Pear Commission, Lands
Department, Bridge-street, Sydney.
Is it safe to use Cooper’s yellow powder
dip, dissolved in water, to treat rams’ heads for
fly-blow where skin has been broken in fight-
ing 7 —2213.
The makers of the dip say it is safe, but
that it is desirable immediately after spraying
to sprinkle the affected part with boracic-
acid powder. On no account should Cooper’s
powder dip be mixed with oil or grease.
Are fruit-trees ringbarked by rabbits and
shooting from the ground likely to survive,
and, if so, when will they bear fruit 7 —2340.
If the shoots are coming from below the
scion or graft, it will be necessary to re-
work them to the variety originally worked
on them. If they are growing from above the
graft or bud, the trees will be satisfactory. The
length of time the trees will take to commence
cropping depends on kind and variety. Period
ranges from three to twelve years.
How to eradicate blackberries 7 —2551.
Eradication is not easy, because the roots
sucker freely. If the plants are destroyed as
soon as they appear, the pest can be kept
under control. The thorns make “brushing”
an unpleasant job, so spray the plants with
sodium arsenite and burn when dry. Further
applications of the spray can then be given
to destroy the young plants, or these can be
hoed out. Fruiting time is best for treatment,
as suckering does not occur so freely then as
at other periods. On sheep land, a few cross-
bred wethers or goats will clear young shoots.
Kikuyu grass sown soon after burning helps
to smother the suckers.
Recipe for making candles with mutton fat,
and where can moulds, wicks, etc., be obtained,
and cost 7 —2441.
You can make a very good candle by melt-
ing together one-third beef fat and two-thirds
mutton fat, both clarified and free from salt;
the mixture should be hardened by adding lib.
alum dissolved in water to every 51b. of fat.
Wicks, moulds, etc., are procurable from
Anthony Hordern and Sons, Sydney, who will
quote you prices.

SPRING AND
SUMMER
SYDNEY HAS AN
IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO
HOLIDAY MAKERS.
Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harjpor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical
and picture and other pleasure resorts. Sydney’s shops
with their displays are reached by tram. Winter Garden
with Orchestra. Terms from 6/6 per night (room only)
you will combine with economy the greatest comfort. Service is
not the slogan—it is the practice.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
X—Whaling Days.
Whaling in the earlies was a far dif-
ferent pastime from the whaling ot
to-day. The modern whale is timid and
degenerate, and sneaks away Poleward,
so that it takes a whole flotilla ot ships
armed with 10-inch guns to find him. His
great-grandfather was a horse ot a dif-
ferent color. Huge, daring and impu-
dent, he didn't wait to be found, but car-
ried the war right into the enemy’s terri-
tory. At Twofold Bay, King George’s
Sound and Freeman’s Nob it was a daily
occurrence for a whale to steam in under
full sail, head down and tail up, trumpet-
ing loudly and spouting defiance.
It usually happened at breakfast time,
and the whalers would rush forth to their
boats carrying their lives and the remains
of their meal in their hands. The whale
would promptly charge the nearest boat
and smash it to bits with a swish of his
tail. This was called a llukc, but it was
really done on purpose. A fluke scored
one to the whale, and if he had sense
enough to be satisfied with a win on
points he called it a day and 1 elt the
other boats to pick up the pieces. Usually,
however, he was greedy and played lor
a straight-out win—with dire results.
Whales are not very good at mathe-
matics and can’t count past three. Con-
sequently after a whale had scored three
flukes he used to slacken off. thinking the
match was over. The fourth boat would
then sneak up on his weather side and
lampoon him, and
as a whale can’t
stand ridicule it
was usually the
end of the argu-
ment.
It was the am-
bition of every
whaler to get into
fhe fourth boat,
but to achieve
this a man had to
survive in turn
from a first,
second and third
boat. The fourth
crew thus con-
si st e d of the
strongest and
luckiest men, and
once they were
there they were
on a good thing,
provided the
whale played fair
and didn’t lose
count of his
flukes.
The whales
were known by
various names,
depending largely
upon whether
you were in the
first, second, third
or fourth boat.
They didn’t mind
much what they
were called, nor
whether they were sold as lamp-oil,
candles or corsets, but they did object to
oeing labelled Cod Liver OH.
Old whalers say they wouldn’t mind
starting the industry again, but they can’t
get anyone to man the first three boats.
There’s no ambition nowadays.

THE LAST STRAW.
He rose suddenly, silencing her with
a dramatic finger.
“This is the end!” he cried. “Now
there’s only one thing for us —divorce!
I've put up with your nagging morning,
noon and night, at home, away from
home —everywhere! I’ve put up with
it eating, drinking, dozing, dreaming,
walking, sitting, working and holidaying!
But, by heaven, I’m not going to put
up with it while I’m trying to listen-in

SUSPENSE.
Ever since he came to the place he
had been impatient for this moment.
Time and again he had seen others
approach the iron
grille and then
step happily out
in the fresh air of
the open world.
.Scores of them —
their names he
knew not; all were
mere numbers in
the merciless ini
personal system of
this huge place.
Now at last it
was his turn. He
seemed to have
been waiting an
age. Often he had
asked himself,
“Was it worth
while, for the sake
of a few pounds?”
“Still,” he solilo-
quised, “I should
have thought of
that before I put
my signature to
the thing.”
A few pounds!
And all this
humiliation....
But Mabel would
be waiting for
him when he came
out —dear, innocent, trusting Mabel, for
whose sake he was here.
But would she? A horrible doubt
assailed him. After all, she was but
human. Supposing she tired of wait-
ing.... Supposing....
“Ninety-seven,” the voice droned out
from behind the grille.
Ah! At last! Now to leave the
accursed place.
He stepped forward.
“How will you have it?” asked the
teller politely.

PURE.
The Commonwealth Government had
offered a prize to the first Australian film
to pass the censor. Although competi-
tion had been keen, the prize was still
unclaimed. “Little 80-Peep” had been
banned because the actress who had
taken the name part had once rented a
flat in Darlinghurst. Another film, which
depicted life in the Golden West, had
been refused on account of a suspected
connection between the West and Mae
of that ilk. Scores of pictures had fallen
by the wayside. There had been objec-
tions to all the books that had been con-
verted into talkies.
At last Lilywhite Films, Ltd., pro-
duced something that had the censorship
puzzled. The champion moralists of the
department admitted that it was free
from sin.
“But,” remarked the Chief Censor to
the producer, “it’s not very interesting.
Do you think anybody will pay to see
it?”
“Probably not,” the producer replied ;
“but that won’t prevent our collecting the
prize.”
“And I can’t altogether follow the
plot,” continued the Censor. “What is it
based on?”
The producer was surprised. “Why,
didn’t you recognise it?” he said. “It's
a dramatised version of the N.S.W. Rail-
ways timetable.”

the kitchen to ask Mrs. Blinks, who was
cutting sandwiches. She told him, and
wrapped the sandwiches up, and then
unwrapped them again, having forgotten
to put any butter on them. It was then
that Blinks put a rather sheepish head
round the door to say that he’d forgotten
where she said the tie was. When the
tie and the sandwiches were ready, they
went out to get the kids, who were play-
ing in the back garden, having forgotten
there was a picnic. Mrs. Blinks helped
them to dress and Blinks went to get
the car out. At last they set out. When
they had travelled about two miles, they
suddenly remembered that they had for-
gotten the car, but of course it was too
late to turn back then, even if they could
have remembered the name of the street.
I’ve forgotten what happened after
that.

Information Sought.
(1) Respective heights of Max Baer and
Primo Camera ? (2) Why is Baer called the
“Livermore Larruper” ? (3) Where and when
was he born, and did he defeat many men of
note before conquering Camera ? —2548.
(1) Baer, 6ft. 3in.; Camera, 6ft. 6}in. (2)
He began boxing in Livermore, Cal., in 1929.
(3) Born Omaha, Neb., February 11, 1909.

Heeney, Johnny Risko, King Levinsky, Ernie
Schaaf, Tuffy Griffiths, Max Schmeling and
others.
(1) Was Mick Simmons, who owned a
tobacco shop in the Haymarket, Sydney, the
proprietor of the Alhambra Theatre ? (2)
Was he a colored man and, at one time, a
boxer ? (3) When was his business converted
into a limited co. ? —2405.
(1) He did not own the theatre, which was at
the back of the shop, but people possibly
thought that he had an interest in it, owing
to the shop being part and parcel of the
theatre entrance. (2) He was an Englishman,
and was not a boxer. His grandfather, Danny
Mendoza, was the champion of Great Britain
and a companion of George IV. (3) In 1910.
(1) (a) Where can 1 learn to become a movie
cameraman ? (b) Knowledge necessary ? (2)
(a) Where can 1 learn to operate a film pro-
jector ? (b) Knowledge necessary? —2373.
(1) (a) No schools. Qnly chance is to obtain
private tuition. ( b ) A thorough knowledge of
photography; composition is also important.
(2) (a) No schools at present, though a possi-
bility of one starting at Sydney Tech. ( b )
Principles and practice of electricity, sound
amplification, elementary mechanics, optics of
projection and general proficiency in operation
of the projector. Usually only acquired after
some years of experience.
(1) Must the beneficiaries under a will in-
clude in their returns amounts received from
distribution of liquid assets of an estate ? (2)
Should the trustees render a return for amounts
received on behalf of a beneficiary who has
only a life interest ? —2358.
(1) Beneficiaries should include in their re-
turns any amounts received from the estate
which are part of the estate income, but need
not show corpus payments. (2) Trustees are
required to lodge returns for the estate and
for any beneficiary under a legal disability,
such as an absentee. Beneficiaries not under a
legal disability should lodge returns showing,
as well as any other income they may have,
the distribution from the estate.
How could I find out if a prospector who
died this year at Darwin has left a will 9
2497. _
Write to the Crown Law Officer, Supreme
Court, Darwin, N.T., asking whether probate of
a will has been granted and, if not, whether
he could put you in the way of ascertaining
the existence of a will. Give prospector’s name
in full and any facts you know about him.
(1) Where are marriage licenses obtainable in
N.S.W. ? (2) Cost ? (3) Does license cover
marriage at registry office and elsewhere ? (4)
How much time must elapse between obtaining
license and ceremony? (5) Is a birth certifi-
cate necessary when it is obvious that one is
over 21 ?—■ 2406.
, (1), (2), (3) and (4) There is no provision for
the issue of marriage licenses in N.S.W. Arrange-
ments for a marriage should be made direct
with the minister, and the question of notice
is a matter between the parties and the cele-
brant. While there is no residential qualifica-
tion in the case of a marriage celebrated by
a minister, a district registrar is not author-
ised to celebrate a marriage unless the bride
ordinarily resides within his district. (5) Not
if there is no room for doubt.
/ am an ex-officer of the A.I.F. About Aug.,
1918, / was awarded the Military Cross. Am
l entitled to a money grant ? 1 have never
received a pension. —2273.
As the Military Cross was awarded whilst
you were holding commissioned rank, no
gratuity or other allowance is payable.
(1) Should liquids be taken after or with
meals ? (2) Is it correct to eat sweets with
both fork and spoon ? —2379.
(1) The generally accepted theory is that
liquids should be taken after meals, as fluids
dilute the gastric juices essential to digestion,
but physiologists assert that dry food is better
digested and assimilated if a little fluid is taken
with it. (2) Both fork and spoon may be
used in eating sweets if the diner is unable
to eat with fork alone. The spoon only is
used with small compote and sweets dishes
(fruit salad and cream, etc.).
What is the qua!up bell ? Is it suitable for
Sydney climate? —2519.
Scientific name is Pimelia physodes, and it is
a native of Westralia. It grows to 2ft. 6in., and
carries bell flowers which are tinged with
yellow, green and purple. Grows well in sunny
position, and thrives in loamy soil in Sydney.
Seed is obtainable at Is. a packet.
(1) My lilies-of-the-valley flowered weakly last
year; is it because they have not been divided ?
(2) What are the principal colors and varieties ?
—2503.
(1) Probably the fewer blooms are caused by
the roots becoming matted together. Dig up
the rhizomes and separate them; then remake
the bed, adding plenty of rotted cow manure.
Set the crowns 12in. apart, covering them
lightly with sieved soil or leaf mould. The
plump crowns will flower in the first year; thin
ones will not bloom for another year. Febru-
ary to April is the best time to divide them.
(2) The English varieties are Fortin’s (giant
white) and Majalis (white and pink); and a
new orange-golden species from South Africa
named Sandersonia aitrantica, with bell-shaped
flowers lin. across, is particularly recom-
mended.
(1) Is it practicable to transplant pepper-trees
15 years old ? (2) Proper time to lop them ? —■
2340.
(1) Aged pepper-trees hardly ever survive
transplanting. (2) In mid- or late spring, after
rain.
(1) English translation of words sung to
Handel’s Largo “Ombra Mai Fu” ? (2)
A uthor ? (3) In what work of Handel’s does
the song occur ? —2532.
(1) Too long to quote here; copy posted. (2)
The translation usually sung is by Paul Eng-
land. (3) From the opera “Xerxes.”
(1) When was the first Federal Public Works
Committee appointed? (2) When did it cease
to function ? (3) Payments to , chairman and
other members in addition to their Parliamen-
tary salaries ? (4) Travelling expenses ? (5)
Principal works reported on by the commit-
tee ? (6) Members at the time the committee
ceased to function? —1941.
(1) December, 1914. (2) November 28,
1932. (3) The chairman was paid £2 and
members £1 10s. per sitting, but total ex-
penditure was limited to £2OOO p.a., reduced
by 20 p.c. under the Financial Emergency Act.
(4) £1 per day while away from seat of gov-
ernment. (5) A summary has been posted.
(6) A. W. Lacey, M.P. (chairman), Senators
J. B. Dooley, M. Reid and B. Sampson, and
Ms.P. M. D. Cameron, J. Curtin (resigned
1.1 /3 / ’3l), H. Gregory, E. J. Holloway (re-
signed 11/3/ ’3l), W. J. Long, H. P. Lazzarini
(appointed 13/3/’3l) and J. T. Tully (appointed
13/3/’3l).
(1) Would a 10 -h.p. electric motor drive the
same load as a 10 -i.h.p. steam engine ? (2)
Difference between i.h.p. and b.h.p. ? . (3)
How to determine the h.p. of a D.C. electric
motor ? (4) The i.h.p. of a steam engine ?
(5) Would a 10 -b.h.p. semi-Diesel oil engine
drive the same load as a 10 -b.h.p steam engine ?
■ 2416.
(1) Yes. (2) I.H.P. (indicated h.p.) is the
power delivered by the steam inside the cylinder
to the piston; b.h.p. (brake-h.p.) is the h.p.
delivered to the crankshaft, that is, the i.h.p.
minus the power required to drive the engine
itself. (3) Multiply the power in kilowatts by
1.34. (4) Multiply the mean effective pressure
on the piston, in pounds per sq. in., by the
length of the stroke, in feet, by the area of
the piston, in sq. in., by the number of strokes
per minute for double-acting engines, or the
r.p.m. for single-acting engines. Divide the
result by 33,000. (5) Yes.
(1) What rifle is used by the U.S.A. Army?
(2) Type of machine-gun ? (3) Calibres of
artillery, including anti-aircraft and railway
guns ? —2349.
. (1) The improved Springfield, credited with
a range of 5500 yards. (2) All calibres are
Browning type. (3) The calibres of mobile
artillery are: For the pack, 75mm. pack
howitzer; for the light, 75mm. gun and 105 mm.
howitzer; for the medium, 155 mm. gun and
155 mm. howitzer; and for-the heavy, 155 mm.
gun and Bin. ; howitzer. The 155 mm. howitzer
is now, issued in lieu of the 105 mm. howitzer,
pending production of a sufficient quantity of
105 mm. howitzers. Likewise the 240 mm.
(9.65 in.) howitzer is used in lieu of the Bin.
howitzer. Anti-aircraft guns are of 3in. and
105 mm. calibres. The most powerful mobile
gun is a 14in.‘ gun on a railway carriage. The.
largest calibre is the 16in. gun on barbette
carriage. .
What is the strength of the Chinese Navy ?
—2384.
Largest ship is the 4300-ton cruiser Hai Chi,
24 knots; two Bin. gups, ten 4.7 in. guns and five
above-water torpedo-tubes. The 2600-ton Ying
Swei and the Chao Ho were built in 1911;
used mainly for training purposes, they have a
speed of 20 knots; two 6in. and four 4in.
guns. The 3000-ton Nai Yung, Hai Chou and
Hai Shen, built 1897-98, have a speed of 19.5
knots; three 6in. and eight 4.lin. guns. The
2500-ton Ning Hai and Ping Hai, built 1931-32,
carry six 5.5 in. and six 3in. guns; and the
1650-ton Yat Sen, built 1930, has one 6in.,
one 5.5 in. and four 3in. guns. In addition,
there are 20 steel gunboats of over 400 tons,
18 smaller gunboats, three destroyers and eight
torpedo-boats.

(1) The dew point varies with the change
in the pressure of the water vapor in the air.
Consequently there is little change in the dew
point unless there is a change in wind direc-
tion. As a guide to possible occurrence of frost,
it is wise to take observations as late as pos-
sible in the afternoon. Consideration should
be given to any change in the wind circulation,
and on the coast the dew point should be
determined after the sea breeze, if any, has
dropped. (2) Frost does not occur unless the
temperature of the air falls below 32 degrees
Fahr. If the dew point is above 32 degrees,
condensation takes place before freezing point
is reached, and cooling is checked by the re-
lease of latent heat. Frost is unlikely if the
dew point be above 32 degrees, but it does not
follow that frost will be experienced if the
dew point is below that point. (3) No. The
dew point is merely that temperature to which
the air must be cooled to cause condensation.
The temperature does not necessarily fall to
that point, and only does so under favorable
conditions —for example, on a calm, clear night
in winter.
(I) How to oxidise copper ? (2) How to
finish the two sides of copper spinners used
for fishing ? —2453.
(1) Copper can be oxidised or colored to
various shades from light brown to black by
dipping it in a solution made by dissolving
ioz. of potassium sulphide in one gallon of
boiling water and then, adding a spoonful of
ammonia. A green color can be obtained
by dipping in, a mixture containing loz. of
sal ammoniac, foz. of common salt and one
quart of water. The metal is left in the solu-
tion for about an hour, removed and dried,
the process being repeated until the required
effect is achieved. (2) The convex side is either
polished or chromium-plated; the concave side
being painted with red enamel.
Recipe for a thick office paste that will-
keep ? —2436.
Place one small cup water in a saucepan over
the fire, and drop into it half teaspoon pow-
dered alum. Mix in a cup 1 tablespoon flour
to a smooth paste with cold water, and when
the alum water boils stir in the mixed flour.
Bring to the boil, and let bubble for a few
minutes. Remove from the fire and whisk
into the paste 1 teaspoon of essence of cloves;
while hot, pour into wide little jars and cover.
Keeps indefinitely.
I wish to saturate small sheets of cardboard
in a solution to enable the sheets to burn
fairly rapidly without flame. (1) Will a solution
of sugar and saltpetre give me this result ?
If so, in what proportions should the constitu-
ents be mixed ? (2) Should the solution be
hot or cold when the strawboard is immersed ?
(3) Could any better solution be used com-
mercially ? (4) Is there any method of treating
, the solution so that the sheets after treatment
would be moisture-proof without affecting their
burning power ?■ —2209.
(1) Yes. Most suitable proportion and
strength of mixture for your purpose should
be ascertained by experiment. (2) Hot. (3)
A mixture consisting of potassium nitrate 2
parts, lead acetate 40 parts and water 100 parts
might be more suitable. The board is placed
in the heated solution (not boiling), and the
longer it is heated the faster it will burn. (4)
Solution (3) would be better than the saltpetre
mixture.
How to make carbon paper ?- —2210.
•In commercial practice soot, lampblack, ultra-
marine or Prussian blue is mixed with finely-
scraped and ground soap, which is then brushed
on to the paper with a stiff brush. Unsalted
lard, mixed with any of the above colors, can
also be used to make a pigment. It isn’t a
job for the amateur. A sheet of paper rubbed
with black packing chalk is sometimes used
by artists who wish to transfer an outline that
, can easily be rubbed out.
Date of departure'from Sydney of the four-
masted Finnish barque Pamir, time she cleared

The terms agreed on by Smuts and
Hertzog for the fusion of the Dutch
Nationalist and South African parties
have been endorsed by the supporters of
both, and the fusion will probably be-
come an accomplished fact in August,
when party congresses will be held. An
encouraging point for those who believe
that racial bitterness can again be lived
down is that Dr. Malan was beaten on
his own D.-N. committee by 13 votes to
seven. The only other dissentient was
Colonel Stallard, of Natal, who found
everyone on the S.A.P. side out of step
except himself.

“4 x 2”: The most extraordinary
escape in the history of aviation was a
war-time one. In a dogfight with
German ’planes a Canadian observer
was thrown from the cockpit at the start
of a vertical dive. The ’plane, with engine
full on, went down the faster, but he
overtook it as it was coming out of the
dive and landed astride the tail after a
fall of some hundreds of feet. He hung
on, and the pilot landed him intact on
terra firma. There are many authenti-
cated instances of sailors being washed
overboard from ships and washed in-
board by the next wave, but this must be
the only recorded case of regaining an
aeroplane in mid-air.

Carnoustie : Another of those luna-
tic exhibitions of marathon golf is re-
ported from England. One Norman, an
18-handicap golfer who is lame with
war injuries, wagered he would play 10
non-stop rounds .of the Stoke-Poges
course. It took him 16| hours to do it
and 960 strokes, his best round being
89 and his worst 107. He walked 45
miles, and went through the whole per-
formance on a diet of lemons and water.
The record in this direction stands in
the name of Bruce Sutherland, an Edin-
burgh Scot. He began at 8.15 in the
evening and kept going until 7.30 p.m.
the next day. He played 14 rounds, in-
eluding 252 holes, and during the night
was accompanied by fore-caddies carry-
ing lanterns.

“Aigburlh”: The spectacle of Brad-
man and Chipperfield rising superior to
their bodily afflictions and leaving their
beds to play their part in the Old Traf-
ford Test reminds me that Australian
Elevens have been lucky, as a rule, in
the matter of serious illness or casual-
ties. The worst case writer recalls
was that of Sammy Jones, who went
down with smallpox early in the 1888
season and played in only 12 matches
out of 40. That was the year another
Sammy from N.S.W., fast-bowler Woods,
was co-opted from the Cambridge
Eleven to help his countrymen along.
“Williami”: Does any Aboliar know
the equine crab? I met the strange and
beautiful creature only once; it was in
a pub in Suva, and I was sober (always
am). Bung handed the crab skeleton over
the bar. It had perfectly-formed hooves
with hairy fetlocks, the four legs were
like those of a Shetland foal, and along
the centre of the back was a mane hali-
an-inch in length. Otherwise it was all
crab, and not in any sense subject to
suspicion. Bung informed me that the
equine crab belonged to Maoriland, and
in parts could be seen in hundreds ; but,
since it had the speed of a greyhound
when in full gallop, it was difficult to
catch.

“Hesketh Park”: One item in the
cricket cables which intrigues my friends
of the Sydney C.G. “hill” is that telling
how spectators in the Test-match crowd
at Old Trafford were hurt by carelessly-
thrown “pop” bottles. It is a curious
fact that, while an Australian takes beer
with him to a cricket match or on an out-
ing, the Lancashire operative leans to soft
drinks of varied and devastating descrip-
tion which he groups under the generic
title of “pop.” More different kinds of
this are made and sold in Lancashire than
anywhere else in the world. They all
taste much the same, but the colors are
different. I can recall one entitled “eli-
campane” which I have never met by
sea or land since my Lancashire days.
Not that the Lancashire lad isn’t partial
to beer. But to him drinking “aale,” as
he calls it, is as sacred a function as a
Test match, and he shrinks from com-
bining the two.

TYRE INFLATION
The “RENRUT” QUADRUPLE TYRE PUMP gives a
remarkable service in tyre inflation. Built on the principle
of quadruple compression, which provides a double-acting
main barrel, drawing in air on both the up and down strokes,
this unique mechanism doubles the capacity of the large barrel,
and. so halves the time of inflation. The inner high-pressure
cylinder ensures easy delivery of this large volume.
Sturdily built for a long life of faithful service, the “RENRUT”
QUADRUPLE offers quicker and easier pumping than you

STANDARD CHEVROLET TESTED UNDER
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.
ECONOMY AND HIGH PERFORMANCE OUTSTANDING
FEATURES.
BY FRED BERRY.
Australian motorists have for years held the Chevrolet
in high esteem, low initial cost, dependability and good road
performance being its most appreciated virtues.
The 1934 Chevrolet is a worthy successor to family tradi-
tion, providing equal reliability, greater power, more economy
and improved appearance.
The standard model tested recently over “The Bulletin”
course is a full-sized car in both performance and efficiency.
Body styles are in keeping with modern
streamlining practice, with ample room
for all passengers, while no-draught
ventilation is incorporated in all closed

Passing through the busy city streets
it was demonstrated that easy steering
and short wheelbase, coupled with rapid
top-gear acceleration, made traffic driving
a simple matter.

sumption at high average speed.
Approaching Windsor speed was re-
duced to 15 m.p.h., and over the coasting
section, with gear-lever in neutral, a dis-
tance of 654 yards was covered before
coming to a standstill, a slightly binding
front brake preventing a better result.
Nearing Richmond a test of maximum
speed was made over a measured mile,
the time taken, 47 4-ssec., giving an
average speed of 75.3 m.p.h. During this
high-speed run the sedan held the road
well, steering was easy yet positive, and
the motor, although turning at maximum
revs., was without noticeable vibration.
Continuing through Richmond a
deviation was made through Grose Vale
over unmade clay roads, treacherous
through recent rain. Here the driver
made an error in treating the conditions
too lightly, resulting in a visit to the
ditch, fortunately without damage. The
car showed its worth by being driven out
of this difficult position under its own
power.
Next test, the two-mile climb of Kurra-
jong Mountain, was clocked in 3min.
39sec., the car negotiating the difficult
bends in a safe manner, while over the
final water-worn section steering was
good and road-holding qualities first-
class, due in some measure to the knee-
action type of independent front-wheel
suspension.
Returning down the hill, emergency
braking equipment was tested, the car
pulling up in a very short distance with-
out skidding. Before entering Rich-
mond the cross-country route via Castle-
reagh to Penrith was taken. On this sec-
tion a number of performance tests were
made.
First and most critical of the series was
that of covering 350 yards in top gear
as slowly as possible, followed imme-
diately by a similar distance —still in top
—on full throttle. Here the Chevrolet
showed its flexibility and traffic qualities
by covering the slow running in 4min.
18sec., an average of 2.8 m.p.h., and the
fast section in 19 4-ssec., averaging 36.3
m.p.h., crossing the finishing line at 50
m.p.h.
From a standing start through all gears
the time occupied in reaching 50 m.p.h.
was 14 4-ssec., while accelerations from
10 to 30 m.p.h. in top and 10 to 30 m.p.h.
in second were
clocked as 9 2-ssec.
and 6sec. respec-
tively.
Turning circle
was then measured
in order to show
how the car could
be manoeuvred in
parking, right lock
being 34ft. and left
lock 39ft., a decided
advantage when
pulling sharply out
from a tight posi-
tion.
Returning to the
city via Penrith
brakes were tested.
and the Chevrolet pulled up evenly in
24ft. from a speed of 25 m.p.h.
At the conclusion of the run of 116
miles fuel consumed was measured, 5|
gallons being required to fill the tank —
averaging 21 m.p.g. The time taken, in-
clusive of all tests, 3hr. lOmin., showed
an average speed of 36.6 m.p.h.
The six-cylinder engine fitted to the
standard Chevrolet is of the overhead-
valve type, developing 60 b.h.p. at 3000
r.p.m.
Bore is 3 5-16 in. and stroke 3yin., giv-
ing an R.A.C. rating of 26.3 h.p. Cylinder
head has been redesigned, valves are
larger and the position of spark plugs
and valves has been altered, giving
greater power and better fuel economy
than last year’s motor.
Cylinders cast en bloc are integral with
the upper half of the crankcase, and
generous webbing ensures crankshaft
rigidity.
Crankshaft, statically and dynamically
balanced and weighing 571 b., is carried
in steel-backed, babbit-lined main bear-
ings.
Lubrication is on semi-pressure sys-
tem, with vane-type pump in crankcase.
Oil at pressure is fed to main
camshaft bearings and overhead valve
gear, with provision in top of rocker arms
for feeding ball sockets and valve stems.
Fuel is taken from a 9|-gallon tank at
rear of chassis by mechanical pump,
driven by an eccentric on the camshaft to
a Carter down-draught carburettor
equipped with accelerating pump, which
delivers fuel only when the throttle is
opened suddenly.
A butterfly valve type automatic choke
control, together with a large air cleaner,

ing cool water around exhaust-valve

flame arrester and silencer, is also
standard equipment. Intake manifold is
of improved design, port sleeves having
been eliminated, with consequent better
and more even distribution of gas to the
cylinders.
Coil and battery ignition system is
used, an octane -selector, instantly ad-
justable to handle varying grades of fuel,
being incorporated with the distributor
head.
All high-tension wires throughout the
system are waterproofed.
The cooling system has been given
particular attention. In addition to an
efficient impellor in the water circuit,
eight special spraying nozzles through
which the coolest water is by-passed are
located adjacent to the exhaust-valve
seatings in order to keep the valves cool,
improve efficiency and lengthen the life
of the valves.
No-draught ventilation system allowing
fresh air to he drawn in at the leading
edge; used air is forced out at rear.
The complete power plant is suspended
in chassis on live rubber supports in order
to dampen vibration.
Transmission is through single-plate
dry-clutch, 9in. diameter, the cushion-
mounted clutch-disc having a moulded
lining.
The three-speed and reverse gearbox
has a central control lever, second gear
being “silent,” using helical-cut synchro-
mesh pinions. The open propeller-shaft
transmits the final drive to a banjo-type
rear-axle assembly, with semi-floating
driving-shafts.
The chassis on the 1934 Chevrolet is
of X-girder construction, and is of
the improved KY pattern. This new
frame has been specially constructed for
use with independent front-wheel suspen-
sion, and is claimed to resist lateral
stresses to 15 times the extent of frames
of conventional type.
Sub-frame members, one on each side,
increase strength and provide an ideal
engine mounting.
Independent suspension is provided,
each front wheel being fitted with a knee-

Do you know that up to three or four months ago I'd never taken Eno.
Of course I used to read those advertisements about Can and Can't.
But somehow I never thought of them having anything to do with me.
And then one day I got talking with a doctor friend about why it
was that I was always feeling so tired and depressed.

Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom
centre in technical or abstract features, but rather in personal
experiences or achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over
specified routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the
present mechanical condition of cars after years of use are matters
of extreme interest. Huge annual mileages, old driving licenses, and
perhaps low car numbers support claims to experience, while many
drivers, with characteristic Australian ingenuity, have made interest-
ing emergency repairs.
Who holds No. 1 license or drives No. 1 car in each State, and
who drove the first car?
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver
covers the greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been
confined to racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic,
hundreds of miles from repair shops, has worked miracles in order
to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount
their experiences.

British Racing Prestige to be
Restored by the E.R.A.S.
Tired of repeated lickings when driv-
ing home-built racing cars, and equally
disgusted with having to drive foreign
makes in order to be first over the line, a
group of British sportsmen with an eye
on coming events in England and on the
Continent has formed a syndicate to
build a fleet of special machines in a
grand effort to restore British racing
prestige.
If the names and achievements of mem-
bers of the English Racing Automobiles
Syndicate go for anything the new cars
will give drivers of Continental cars some
sleepless nights, and the dust will fly to
some order in this summer’s classic
events.
Built in a private factory three of the
new racers are now complete, and
while technical details have been care-
fully guarded the jobs have already set
the racing world chattering. Wheelbase
is 7ft. lOin., and the bodies are business-
like yet perfectly streamlined. The track
is slightly crabbed, 4ft. 3£in. in front and
4ft. lin. at rear. The chassis is unusually
stiff, and the front axle is designed to
withstand enormous stress, both essential
features in standing up to gruelling road
racing. The gearbox has been specially
built by Armstrong Siddeley, and is on
the self-change principle, controlled in an
original yet simple manner.
Power plant is equipped with double
overhead valves, vertical drive magneto
ignition and Murray Jamieson super-
charger, and, while actual power output
has not been stated, the cars’ sponsors
appear confident of phenomenal per-
formance.
First full-dress test will be at Shelsley
Walsh. All three cars have been entered
for the British Empire Trophy race.
Aluminium Heads and Touring-Car
Performance.
Until a few years ago aluminium
alloys were but a laboratory curiosity,
and their high cost made their use in
automobile construction prohibitive.
To-day it is almost impossible to
imagine how the designer would fare
without generous use of these alloys, and
in actual fact they rival rubber in their
manifold uses. Cast iron has now taken
a back seat. In its stead aluminium
alloys are used for gearboxes, crank-
case, pistons and many other important
units, and a number of 1934 models are
fitting aluminium cylinder-heads and
combustion chambers.
In the past car engines suffered a
severe handicap by reason of poor
thermal efficiency. At one stroke alumi-
nium heads have solved this problem.
MOTORIMPRESSIONS.
The “corduroy”-road sensation.
and now compression ratios of six and
seven to one —once only possible in
racing cars operating on “doped” fuels
—are fitted to tourers and give greater
power at low revs, than the old cast-
iron type, together with absence of pink-
ing and smaller petrol consumption.
Motor Oddities.
“The Mugwump”: Twenty-five miles
from the nearest ’phone and 80 from a
garage we faced a hopeless dawn with
the bearing behind the pinion of our old
Model T Ford in a double handful of
pieces. The ball thrust race, however,
was all right. We cut a block of wood
to fit the bearing-housing neatly, the
spindle connecting-rod, heated red, being
used to bore the necessary hole. The
wooden block was then fitted in two
pieces, packed with grease out of the
front wheel hub-caps, and we landed
home without much trouble. On two
occasions I have brought in Model T’s
on leather big ends, but this method of
repair is hard on boots.
“Pip 4453”: Have been driving for
30 years in the metropolitan area, so far
without being booked. Is this a record?
* * * *
"H.E.L.”: Travelling from Mt. Isa to
Camooweal on a cold Sunday night in
June 1 had the misfortune to lose the
plug from the rear end of the drag link
in sandy country. The spring and other
bits were recovered, but not the threaded
plug. A substitute was fashioned from
the thick end of the benzine-case holding
spare petrol. Carved out with a pocket-
knife, driven home after the other gad-
gets had been restored to place and
secured with a nail from the benzine-
case, the repair lasted for years and
may still be going strong for all 1 know.
Do Spark Plugs Wear Out?
Every now and again motorists are
served with advice to scrap plugs after
15,000 miles’ use, and canny
members of the brotherhood
wink knowingly in the belief
that this propaganda is only
for the purpose of stimulat-
ing sales. But here the manu-
facturer is telling the whole
truth.
Plugs don’t wear out like
the soles of shoes, but they
become tired electrically and,
while still firing the gas in the
cylinder, do their job in only
a half-hearted (or, rather,
half-heated) fashion.
Tests conducted recently
by an unbiased authority
prove this contention to the
hilt. After driving a 14-h.p.
car for 11,000 miles, made up
of regular daily journeys of
140 miles, petrol consump-
tion was carefully tested on
five consecutive trips and
gave an average of 16 m.p.g.
Without any mechanical
adjustment a new set of plugs
was then fitted, the result
being an immediate improve-
ment in consumption to 20
m.p.g., a figure that has been
steadily maintained since the
change over.
The moral is that any
motorist who keeps his
original plugs overlong is
paying for wasted gas, while
his car is down both in
acceleration and general road perform-
ance.

SCREENED AERIAL LEAD-IN.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
If you suffer from “man-made static” this easily
constructed lead-in filter may overcome your troubles.
Splutters and crackles which super-
impose themselves on your programmes
are often of sufficient intensity to com-
pletely ruin reception. It has been proved
that in many cases this unwanted inter-
ierence finds its way to the. aerial cir-
cuit of the receiver through the aerial
down-iead, where an outside aerial is
used. The down-lead may pass close to
lighting or power circuits en route,
whereas the aerial itself is quite clear.
If this lead-in can be screened in such
a manner as to retain the efficiency of
the aerial, it is possible to reduce the
interference to a minimum, or eliminate
it entirely.
The accompanying diagram illustrates a
simple way of dealing with the problem.
Two R.F. transformers are arranged in
metal screens, one at the junction of
the aerial and the lead-in, and the other
at the receiver itself, with a screened
twisted cable connecting the two. The
coil assembly for each transformer may
be made from old 75-turn plug-in
honeycomb coils, with an 8-turn winding
wound over the top of the honeycomb
on a strip of insulating tape. A large-
sized coil can or even a round cocoa-
tin with close-fitting lid may be used for
the screens.
The shielded
cable linking
the two trans-
formers can be
lead - covered
power cable,
but it is essen-
tial that the
continuity of
the lead sheath
is not broken.
U ndoubt-
edly, the most
suitable cable
for this
screened link
is the armored
cable as once
used exten-
sively in car-
lighting sys-
tems. This is
quae weatherproof, and light into
the bargain. No restriction is placed
upon the length of the cable, but
the scheme is that the aerial (flat-top)
should be erected as far as possible from
the source of electrical interference. This
screened lead-in has been found re-
markably effective in eliminating radio-
inductive interference from an external
source, and the combination of this with
a power-line filter can often make all
the difference between high and low
noise-level reception. The arrangement
has been found to be fully advantageous
also for short-wave reception.

AN INTERFERENCE TRAP FOR AMATEUR
TRANSMISSIONS.
The broadcast listener is in some cases
annoyed, in others amused, when an-
nouncements or telegraphy clicks from a
near-by experimental transmitting station
cause interference with reception of
broadcast programmes. The newcomer
to broadcast reception so affected may
be under the impression that the experi-
mental station is breaking regulations by
operating on the broadcast wave-lengths.
A few experimenters in Australia are
authorised to conduct transmissions on
wave-lengths between 200 and 250 metres,
but only at such times as the regular
broadcasting stations are off the air. Such
transmissions may be heard mostly after
10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. on Sunday nights
and are popular with many listeners.
Often severe interference is caused by
a near-by experimental station working
on the amateur 80- or 40-metre
bands, and in such cases “shock excita-
tion” of the aerial used with the broad-
cast receiver may be responsible. The
present-day experimenter takes every pre-
caution to minimise such interference,
but in extreme cases, attention to the
affected broadcast receiver is the only
remedy. Such interference may be
eliminated by connecting in series with
the aerial to the receiver a simple short-
wave trap, which may be made inexpen-
The components are mounted on a sheet
of bakelite and fitted into a screening box.
sively from a few simple paits. If the
experimental station operates on only
one frequency, a trap tuned to this rre-
-4will suffice . Experimenters in
most cases use the 80-, 40- and 20-
metre bands allocated for their use, and
so it is an advantage to have a trap with
switching to cover these three bands. The
illustration and diagram show the essen-
tials. A small sheet of bakelite, a 23-
plate midget variable- condenser, a tapped
coil and a three-point switch comprise
the assembly. The coil is wound on a
lin. diameter former and has 30 turns
of 26 enamelled or insulated wire, tapped
at 15 and 7 turns, the taps being con-
nected to the switch as in the diagram.
The variable condenser is thus switched
across the three portions of the coil as
required. The complete unit may be
fitted neatly into an aluminium box and
placed inside the receiver cabinet at the
rear. The inclusion of the trap is not
detrimental to broadcast reception. When
interference is heard from an experi-
mental station the switch is tried in each
position in turn, and the condenser
rotated until the unwanted signal dis-
appears. Broadcast listeners will find that
the owners of experimental stations are
anxious to co-operate in the elimination
of interference, and the listener can help
the experimenter in his work by co-
operation in the simple matter of fitting
a wavetrap of this type,

THE OUTPUT METER.
Useful for the Radio Serviceman.
This Page has had many requests tor
information on the construction ol a
simple output meter. The constructor
or serviceman who is at times required
to line up the tuned stages of a super-
heterodyne or tuned R.F. receiver may
find the process difficult, even with the
use of a modulated oscillator, if an
output meter is not available.
The experienced ear can do a fairly
good job with the aid of the modulated
signal, but for real accuracy the output
meter is indispensable. By its use the
last ounce of selectivity and sensitivity
can be obtained from a receiver on the
testing bench. A modulated oscillator
is easily enough made (B. 27/6/’34), and
an output meter may be readily arranged
if a 0 to I milliamperemeter is available.
The circuit diagram shows how this is
done.
An audio transformer with a ratio of
5 to 1 is used “back to front.” The
primary winding is connected in the
meter side of the arrangement, and the
secondary is connected to the audio out-
put of the receiver under test. The
meter is shunted by a 30-ohm rheostat,
and in series with the shunted meter and
the audio transformer primary is a
crystal detector, preferably of the per-
manent carborundum type. If the meter
has an internal resistance in the vicinity
of 30 ohms the maximum resistance of
the rheostat will reduce the meter reading
by about half, and, as some meters have
a resistance of about 50 ohms, a higher
resistance of rheostat will be required
accordingly. The function of this shunt
across the meter is to prevent over-
loading on strong signals, as it may, in
some cases, be difficult to reduce the
modulated radio-frequency input to the
set from the oscillator.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
Conditions have varied very much lately
on all bands. I heard an interesting con-
versation between a U.S.A. amateur and
M.L. on the 80 band. The American
was giving particulars of the power used,
and remarked that it was low, as his
neighbor used 3000 watts. One wonders
what the radio inspector would say if
such power was requested in Australia
by amateurs. On a recent evening, RNE,
25m., was quite good strength at 11.30
p.m., giving the usual alternate talk from
a man and woman with music in be-
tween.
RNE appears to be used far more
now, and one picks the station up at the
hours when REN was used, and also
at other times. The 25 stations have con-
tinued to be weak in the mornings. An
exception was an occasion when FYA
and GSD were quite good strength as
early as 7.30 a.m.
I still cannot place the new station on
about 25.1 (just above RNE) heard about
2 to 2.30 p.m. Strength rises until clos-
ing time, when it is quite good, but not
strong enough for speaker work. Mostly
slow speech is used, with occasional
music of mixed types. The only English
heard recently was on a Sunday, when
before closing at 2.30 the announcer
said plainly “Here is radio ,” but the
conclusion was in a language which
sounded like Spanish. The name of the
station was also unidentified. The
station is so close to RNE that it could
easily be taken for that station, but both
have been on at the same time,
jpg same Sunday was an excellent day
on all the 25 stations after 8.30 a.m., with
a peak signal strength at 3 p.m. FYA put
over some excellent music in the afternoon
and was very strong, and GSD and DJD
were nearly as good. WBXK. also came
up t 0 f u n speaker strength at 2.30, and
was au dible nearly all the morning. The
talk on ] o ng- and short-wave stations
from 2 to 2.30 p.m. was interesting, but

I did pot hear our new station VK3LR
mentioned. The 20 band was also very
good between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., many
Americans from districts 4, 6 and 9
being good ’phone strength, and some
very strong.
The 80 amateur band is playing queer
tricks with “skip.” Very few Sydney or
Melbourne stations are heard, while
north of Newcastle, South Australia,
western Victoria and N.S.W. are coming
in very well ; also many Maorilanders.
The 40 band is dead, but the Dutch
East Indiaman in the 49 band has been
strong about midnight, though suffering
from high-speed fading and high-noise
level. RVIS, 70m., continues good.
Reception lately has been very vari-
able, with one day of exceptional success
on the lower bands. Two new stations
have appeared, though one is probably
a future ’phone service station. 12RO
on the 25m. band has not been heard
for several weeks. Apparently it has
either gone off the air or changed to a
frequency we cannot hear. A few years
ago this station experimented during the
winter on 42m. and was well received in
Australia. After 9 a.m. FYA continues
at fine strength, with peak strength just
before closing at 3 p.m. The 8.8. C.
transmissions for Australia are not so
strong as FYA. The best is GSB on
31.5 m.
There is still very little improvement
in the night strength on the 25m. band,
but it will not be otherwise for several
months. Several mornings recently DJC,
49.8 m., has been heard clearly between
7 and 7.30 a.m., with RFN, on 49.9 m.,
not quite so good. RVIS, 70.2 m., has
been excellent all the week, with some
distortion fading, but the volume had
frequently to be considerably cut down.
One of the new stations was JVB, on
17.1 m. Not much music, but reception
was very good at 11 a.m. The station
gave its actual frequency (in code)
several times, but no English was used.
The other newcomer is 3ME, which has
been testing just at the high-frequency
end of the 80m. band between 10 and
11 p.m. This may be a harmonic or
overtone. No actual wave-length was
stated, and, although the signal was
strong, the distortion sounded more like
one of the spurious A stations.
July 7 was one of those exceptional
days. All the 25m. stations were very
strong at 3 p.m. Dozens of American
amateurs were heard on ’phone, and it
was amusing to hear W6UF trying to
persuade a VK3 to use ’phone. W6UF
was using 1000 watts, and the VK3 25!
There were several G (English) amateurs
on code between 7 and 8 a.m. on the
same band at good volume.
The 80m. band has been most erratic,
very few Sydney stations being audible
and only late at night. Queenslanders
have been coming in very well.
The stranger on 25.1 m. is still there at
odd times, but says nothing in English.
WBXK has been not nearly as good as
on previous Sundays, and the short-wave
session at 3 p.m. was almost impossible
to copy. This, station has been much
weaker lately, and none of the Americans
on the 31m. band has been worth lis-
tening to. Conditions on 31m. have
changed very much the last two years.
W2XAF used to be excellent until 11.30
in the morning.

R.F. Coupling Condenser.
The writer recently made the “Wide-
World Two” receiver (“A.R.N.” 26/1 / ’34)
and decided to add a stage of tuned R.F.
All sizes of coupling capacities were
tried, including two stiff wires and in-
sulating sleeving to form a very small
capacity. The best scheme was as illus-
trated, the condenser being variably ad-
justable to a very small minimum. A
piece of mica or sheet celluloid should
be glued to the surface of one of the
plates to prevent a possible short if the
capacity is used at maximum.

Short-wave Pros and Cons.
Making a Switch from an Old Rheostat.
Most likely a collection of old fila-
ment rheostats will be found in the radio
scrap-box, and from one of these, of the
type illustrated, can be made an effec-
tive single-pole multi-point switch. Re-
move the circular strip on which the re-
sistance element is wound, and unwind
the wire, leaving the strip bare. With a
small three-cornered file make grooves
about l-32nd of an inch deep for as many
contacts as are required. Bind the space
with 18 tinned copper wire and solder
the turns together at the side. If the
turns of wire are flush with the edge of
the strip the contact arm will run
smoothly over each section, and an effec-
tive single-deck wave-change switch is
the result.

What’s What in Radio.
Eckersley’s pronouncement (B. 4/7/’34)
is not radical. Ex-4HG and I took
buzzer practice with galena and buzzers
via two 2mf. Stromberg paper condensers
in series from Ashford’s Hill to Horse-
shoe Bend (suburbs of Gympie, Q.) over
the 220-volt wiring, points being two
wire miles apart. I often wonder why
the local lighting authority hasn’t used
the method. —V. E.

The “Autocar” (England) refers to a
new type of primary cell, which, it is
claimed, may revolutionise electrical
generation. The cells remain inactive
until an electrical circuit is made, when
the exact current necessary for that cir-
cuit is automatically produced. So long
as the circuit is made the battery will
continue to generate, up to 1000 hours
of use. The action is chemical, and, after
the solution has been emptied out, put
through a gauze strainer and replaced,
the battery is a_gain ready for use, and
returns to full output. Although referred
to as a battery development applied to
motoring, it is of great significance to
radio. The trade name is “Salora
Hydrolux.”
* * * *
With increasing activity among experi-
mental transmitters consideration should
be given by radio manufacturers to the
inclusion of a wavetrap for amateur fre-
quencies as part of the receiver. At a
cost of a few shillings extra, the broad-
cast listener could thus be made practi-
cally immune from interference by a
short-wave transmitter in close proximity.
No experimenter worthy of his license
will cause wilful interference, but some
co-operation is necessary on both sides.
Experimenters cannot always confine
their transmissions to non-broadcasting
hours. They should be encouraged, not
discouraged, for the growing group of
all-wave receiver users finds amateur
telephony transmissions entertaining and
instructive.

What is the mystery of the type-15
valve? This indirectly-heated two-volt
battery valve reached Australia from
American sources a few months ago, and
found applications of much benefit to
battery-set designers. Yet American
valve manufacturers are strangely silent
on the subject. No overseas literature
bears any reference to the type-15. This
valve is a proved success in Australia,
and there appears to be no technical rea-
son for the non-appearance of a com-
plete range of two-volt indirectly-heated
battery valves. Possibly the American
motor-car interests, with which the 6.3-
volt indirectly-heated valve for car radio
is important, could throw light on the
subject.

In Sydney the reception of a radio
broadcast programme by a user of the
telephone is recorded. The occurrence,
though unusual, is not unique. As early
as 1913 the writer heard and copied
Morse messages from a ship at sea thus.
The cause may be partial rectification by
oxidised metal contacts somewhere in the
circuit. It must be remembered, too,
that telephone lines provide a long un-
tuned aerial system.

Luxurious demonstration is the idea ol
H.M.V. Radio (England), which has fitted
up a show-train, consisting of three orange

display of 30 different radio and gramo-
phone instruments. The train is covering
most of Great Britain, and is reported to
be attracting crowds.

Something more than a fillip has been
given to the Australian radio industry
by the 1934 cricket Tests. Factories
everywhere are working to capacity, and
double shifts and overtime are the order
of the day. Despite every effort, leading
manufacturers report that they are hav-
ing trouble in catching up with orders.
The position is aggravated by the water-
side strike on the West Coast (U.S.A.),
which is preventing valve deliveries.
* * * *
The moral of the previous fast-
selling period with its t.p. and consign-
ment evils should be borne in mind by
factory sales departments. In one case
during the cricket boom a firm has had
six receivers of different makes out
“on demonstration,” and there will prob-
ably be more retailers providing cricket
broadcasts thus until the Ashes are lost
or won. Then back will go the last on
appro.” set.
A thousand sets per week is a laige
number for an Australian radio manu-
facturer, but this figure is reported from

MOKE THAN JUST MAKING VALVES
During the past ten years of radio, more
Mullard Valves have been sold than any other
make. This definitely proves two things:
that Mullard Master Valves must be the
finest radio valves obtainable, and that ten
years’ preference by the radio public has
been maintained by continued research and
experimenting. Write for Booklet.

The American Federal Radio Commis-
sion has authorised the use for broad-
casting of wave-lengths between 180 and
200 metres. Many receivers will include
this new territory in the tuning range,
and others will fall short. The remedy"
is in the all-wave receiver, which must
of necessity include all frequencies be-
tween 12 and 200 metres. Should 180
to 200 metres be used in Australia, many
existing all-wave receivers would be un-
suitable, the upper limit of the switched
short-wave bands being in the region of
100 metres.

It is remarkable that in Australia, in-
habited by people who find much of
their enjoyment in the open air, the truly
portable receiver should have no market.
A self-contained, easily-carried receiver
can provide much enjoyment for picnic
parties, to say nothing of the beach.
With modern economical battery valves,
Class-B audio and midget permagnetic
speakers, such receivers give most
efficient service. Car radio cannot be
considered as portable, for the car
cannot be taken everywhere. The enter-
prising Australian manufacturer who
first trenches on this field should do very
well indeed.

Television and the Future.
Television, Theory and Practice, by
J. H. Reyner, B.Sc., A.C.G.1., A.M.1.E.E.,
M.lnst.R.E. (Chapman and Hall; 12s.
6d.), is a thorough digest of a science
which seems destined to develop into a
part of everyday life. The author, one of
England’s foremost radio and television
authorities, deals extensively with every
known system of television, British,
German, French and American, and his
well-illustrated manual can be easily
understood by a reader with a knowledge
of electrical and radio fundamentals. Of
the future of television he says: “It is
inadvisable to allow speculation to run
riot on the future of such a comparatively
new practice. Broadcasting in America
is only just over 12 years old, and it is
reasonable to assume that television will
in another 12 years show an even more
rapid development.”
Casual Comment.
It appears to the user of higher fre-
quencies, more so in the case where a
sensitive receiver is employed, that sup-
pression of harmonics is warranted in
VK. In Brisbane three Sydney B-classers
are R 5 on my “Wide-World Three” on
the 3500k.c. region, and VK2JJ tells me
my crystal signal is often smothered in
the mush of VIB coastal radio, quite a
formidable distance in both instances.

The announcement that a device for
elimination of announcers’ sales messages
and other unwanted verbiage is under
manufacture should make newspapers
glad, plus 99 p.c. of listeners. There’s one
snag—the resonating need which trips
the “hit and miss” governor on the loud-
speaker will also trap musical frequencies
over a narrow band. —V. E.
Trade Jottings.

Australian radio engineers and dealers,
has changed the title of his business
from Colville-Moore Wireless Supplies
to Colville Wireless Equipment Co., the
address (4 Rowe-street, Sydney) and per-
sonnel remaining the same. Mr. Col-
ville is well-known in connection with his

Sensitive Five” series of receivers.

Hints for Manufacturers.
[Under this heading overseas develop-
ments and progress in radio will be
reviewed with the object of bringing
under the notice of Australian manufac-
turers new components worthy of pro-
duction.]
The undoubted advantages of ferrous
core coils have been referred to previ-
ously. Their special interest in Australia
is that they make it possible to produce
a modern tuned radio-frequency type of
receiver particularly for use in the
country. There is much to be said for the
T.R.F. receiver where the utmost must
be made of a weak signal under daylight
conditions. Compared with the average
superheterodyne the T.R.F. has a more
favorable ratio of signal-to-noise-level.
The ferrous core coil appears to be a
distinct aid to selectivity in this type of
receiver. England placed the develop-
ment on a commercial basis, and such
receivers are now produced in the U.S.A.
* * * *
The manufacture of dynamic speakers
is a well-established industry in Australia,
and the product is fully the equal of
anything made overseas. There is one
feature, however, outstanding in England
which could be adopted here with advan-
tage. Instead of separate transformers
for various types of valves, a universal
transformer should be fitted as standard.
The transformer can quite easily be
designed to match any output stage, from
power to push-pull pentode and
Class B.
■lt . :Jt * !|t
Other than importations, there is a lack
on the Australian market of high resis-
tance potentiometers capable of carrying
more than a very small milliampereagc.
Such potentiometers must be completely
silent in operation and gradually variable
from zero to maximum resistance.
* * * *
With increasing interest in short-
wave reception on the part of the public
and Government departments, radio
manufacturers would be well advised to
pay more attention to the home con-
structor. Apart from the all-wave re-
ceiver, the short-wave field is very much
a home-constructor market. It is pos-
sible to make up an inexpensive two-
or three-valve regenerative receiver and
to obtain just as much enjoyment from
short-wave listening as with a costly all-
wave superhet. There is plenty of
demand for home-constructed compon-
ents for short-wave receivers.
The Q. and A. Column.
Would a small bicycle dynamo, driven by a
windmill, charge an A-battery accumulator ?
—45.
Such a small generator delivers too low a
voltage and amperage to be of much use. A
car generator, delivering 20 volts, would be
suitable, and these can be picked up cheaply
from garages or “car-wreckers.” The wind-
mill method is quite workable, but an auto-
matic cut-out would have to be included (as
on a car) so that the accumulator would not
discharge through the generator windings when
the windmill is idle.
I made the Class-B amplifier (“A.R.N.”
22/9/’33) and can get excellent quality, but
not enough volume. I have since obtained a
Milliard PM2B, but get no more volume. There
is plenty of amplification before the driver
valve. I see you use an Airzone Ciass-
B transformer in the “Wide-World Three.”
Would a similar transformer improve things ?
—49.
You must not expect too much in the way
of volume. Two watts is all these valves are
designed for. A stage of T.R.F. before your
detector would help considerably. The Air-
zone Class-B transtormer is correctly matched
for the PM2B; its use is advised.
I propose adding a stage of audio to the
“Wide-World Two” as in the enclosed dia-
gram. (1) Will the 15,000-ohm voltage divider
put too great a load on the power transformer ?
(2) Is the power pack suitable ? (3) Is a
centre-tap resistance necessary across the ’45
filament, and what size bias resistor should
be used ? (4) Number of turns on Marquis
former to cover the broadcast band ? (5)
Would a .00025 mfd. fixed condenser in parallel
with the .00015 mfd. tuning condenser spoil
short-wave reception 3—50.
The extra stage as suggested is quite cor-
rect (1) No, but a 20,000-ohm resistance
would be better. (2) Yes. (3) Yes; a 20-ohm
C-T resistor and a 1500-ohm bias resistor
by-passed by a 10 mfd. electrolytic condenser.
(4) 155 turns of 36 D.S.C. and 8 turns
cathode coil. (5) Yes; it would serve no
useful purpose, anyway.
I have built the B eliminator (“A.R.N.”
2/3/ ’34), but before I include the filter section
wish to ’ know whether I can use electrolytic
condensers here without absorbing too much
current. Also, can I use the same A accumu-
lator for the eliminator and receiver? —sl.
Use a solid dielectric condenser input and
electrolytics for the output to the filter. The
same A accumulator can be used for both
purposes.
I intend to construct the “Daventry Short-
wave Four" (“A.R.N.” 29/12/’33) with 6.3-
volt auto-valve as in the sketch enclosed, but
using a full 250 volts on the plates. (1) Will
this mean any alteration in bias resistor values ?
(2) My transformer has a 4-volt and a 2.5-volt
winding. Will these two in series (6.5 volts)
be too much ? (3) 1 have two 26,666-ohm
resistors. Will these be suitcible on eoch side
of the \O,OOO-ohm potentiometer in the ’36
screen-grid ? —52. , „ „ , , ,
Your circuit is correct and fully workable.
Use a 700-ohm cathode resistor for the ’3B
pentode. (1) The higher plate voltage calls for
no alteration in bias resistors normally. (2)
Quite in order; the auto-valves are safe up to
7.5 volts on the heaters. (3) It has been found
better to earth one side of the potentiometer
and to use a resistor in series on the other
side only. Your two 20,000-ohm resistors in
series will do.
In my “Sttperbe” superhet there is a slight
hum. I would like to get rid of it. Would
a 100 ma. 30 H.Y. choke and extra electrolytic
condenser, connected as in the sketch, help ?
—54.
The extra filtering will certainly help, but
readjustment of the voltage distribution in the
set will be necessary.
Can you supply me with the circuit of the
“All-Empire” receiver details of which, I
understand, appeared in 1928. If there are
any improvements since then, please include
them. —53.
The “All-Empire” receiver was the first
short-wave T.R.F. receiver using a screen-grid
valve described in Australia, and was a year
ahead of receivers such as the “Pilot Wasp.”
The amended circuit is illustrated here. The
“Wide-World Four” (B. 18/7/’34) is a more
modern type of T.R.F. short-wave receiver.
/ have been advised to purchase a 10 -valve
all-wave A.C. receiver. Would such a set be
suitable for North Queensland for reception of
all Australian and overseas stations? —57.
Do not judge a receiver by the number of
valves. It is how they are used that counts,
if the receiver is by a reputable maker and of
proved performance it should suit your require-
ments.
I have a five-valve superhet which is giving
excellent results, with reception of all Australian
A and B stations and such overseas stations
as Manila. Tokio and Bangkok regularly.
Having a boxful of spare parts, I would like
to make a short-wave converter. Can you give
me a circuit layout ? —5B.
Description would take too much space here.
Details of a superhet short-wave converter with
wave-change switching will be published soon.
Please give details of a transformer for a
filament supply from 110 volts D.C. and the
circuit of an eliminator ? —59.
Direct current cannot be transformed.
Voltage changes are effected by conversion.
Also you neglect to state filament voltage or
amperage. The circuit diagram of a filter and
voltage supply from D.C. mains is illustrated.
/ have a Radiola 80 superhet, 8 valves and
rectifier. Coupled to it is a Silver-Marshall short-
wave converter, and the combination gives
good reception of world short-wave stations.
There are two faults—(a) a station is tuned in
and remains so for a while, when it wanders
off, and the dial must be returned; (b) a micro-
phonic noise is, present, most pronounced on
the 31- and 25-metre bands. —55.
(n) This may be due to oscillator instability
in the converter. Probably a faulty resistance
or leaky condenser. ( b ) Have the valves tested,
and try removing the aerial., If the noise stops
minus aerial, the interference is external to
the converter.
I have noticed reference to the use of a Ford
spark coil for a B eliminator. (1) Is such
a scheme practical, and, if so, would the usual
choke and condenser, as in an A.C. receiver,
be satisfactory? (2) Is a rectifier necessary,
and what output may be expected ? —56.
(1) Yes, for small receivers. The usual choke-
condenser filter is applicable. (2) Yds, and the
rectifier valve must be of the same voltage
as the input. Output will be up to 15 milli-
amperes at 135 volts.
Being an invalid I wish to occupy my lime
building a radio receiver. (1) Name of an
inexpensive book dealing with the general prin-
ciples of radio ? (2) Will you deal with the
construction of simple receivers on this page ?
(3) Is a miniature set as strong as an ordinary
set ? —6l.
(1) “Concise Radio Handbook,'’ by R. C. V.
Humphery; White Bros, and Parsons, Wingello
House, Sydney, price 3s. 6d. (2) Yes. (3)
Depends on the design of the set. Some midget
sets are powerful five-valve superheterodynes,
and will do just as much as the more bulky
receiver, but with the difference of a lack
of full, round quality of reproduction.
I am building the “Straight 1934 T.R.F.
Receiver” (“A.R.N.” 2/3/’34), but with a ’45
audio output valve instead of the 2A5. (1)
Is my circuit correct? (Sketch enclosed.) (2)
Can I use a 2500 -ohm dynamic speaker with
input transformer for push-pull 45’s ? —6O.
(1) Not quite correct. The 4 mfd. condenser
should be across the 1500-ohm resistor in the
filament centre-tap, and the .1 mfd. con-
denser from centre-tap to the junction of the
1 meg. and .05 meg. grid resistors. (2) Yes.
Use the two outsides of the transformer
primary.
(1) Can a .0001 mfd. condenser (23 plates)
be used in place of a .00005 or .000175 mfd.
condenser without alteration to a circuit ? (2)
What is meant by “general-purpose valve” ? (3)
Can a 4-volt valve be used in place of a 2- or
6-volt valve ?—62.
(1) Some increase in the inductance in the
tuned circuit will be necessary when substi-
tuting a .0001 mfd. for a .000175 mfd. con-
denser. If .00005 mfd. is used, this will require
almost twice the value of inductance. In
other words, more turns. (2) Term indicates
that the valve has plate impedance, etc., en-
abling it to be used as a detector-audio ampli-
fier or even radio-frequency amplifier. (3)
Whichever valve you use, it must have the
correct filament voltage.
I have a 5-valve midget superhet by Breville.
Willi volume tuned down everything is all
right, but increasing the volume brings in a
shrill whistle which is severe at full volume.
I know nothing about radio and wonder if it is
the speaker at fault ? —63.
More likely to be valve trouble. Have the
valves tested and, if the trouble still persists,
get the manufacturer to examine the receiver.
Please look over the enclosed circuit. It is
from an American journal, and supposed to be
a rectifier, but I cannot see how it can work.
—64.
The circuit is quite in order. It is a halt-
wave chemical rectifier of the once-popular
“trickle-charger” kind. A bell-ringing trans-
former would serve the purpose. Ihe larger
the electrodes the more current it will pass.
The electrodes can be one of pure aluminium
and one of lead, in a strong solution of
washing-soda.
I have a three-valve receiver {sketch en-
closed), and am in trouble with tuning. I
cannot get Cl ( T.R.F.) to track properly. Have
tried adding and ■ removing turns on the
coils. —65.
In the first place, your detector has reaction
control, and this valve being a triode, of widely
different characteristics
from the R.F, valve,
ganged tuning is more
of a problem than if
the detector were a
screen-grid valve minus
reaction. The. conden-
sers you have ganged
together are certain to
be unmatched. As you
have no trimmer con-
densers an easy way out
of the trouble is to get
the two grid coils as
nearly matched as pos-
sible, and connect an
11-plate midget variable condenser across C-1
as a manual trimmer. This is an extra adjust-
ment, but you won’t notice it after a little use.
The number of turns and size of a tuning
coil for a Reinartz receiver with 31-plate con-
denser ? —66.
Try 50 turns of 26 D.S.C. on a 3in. former
for the grid coil, with a 35-turn reaction coil
(continued winding). Connect the aerial through
a .0001 mfd. fixed condenser to the reaction
coil (rotor plates of reaction condenser). In
this way the reaction coil serves also as aerial
coupling.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
At Caulfield on Saturday the mount on
Baanya in the Leamington Hurdle was
entrusted to Dillon. The Tasmanian
gelding shortened from 5 to 1 to half
those odds, and at barrier rise had a
pronounced call over The Mirror, who
originally headed the quotes. Don
Zealley rode The Mirror in preference to
Sarokos. It proved an unfortunate
choice, as The Mirror never looked to be
a possibility and dropped his pilot half
a mile from home.
Hynes went to the front on Sarokos,
who is a notorious puller. He refrained
from opening up too big a gap, hoping
to keep something in reserve for a finish-
ing struggle; but Baanya swept past the
grey as they turned for home, and it was
a case of “pay out” from that stage.
Easing up, the son of Salatis scored by
four lengths in 3min. 54sec. for two
miles one furlong and 65 yards, which
is 2£sec. faster than the previous course
record for the distance. Mystic Peak
was beaten by Sarokos for second. He
would have reversed the placings if
Sarakos had not chopped across to the
rails. Hynes, who was reprimanded by
the stewards, explained that his mount
shifted in from the whip when under
pressure.

Seven of the Leamington Hurdle
starters, namely, Baanya, Sarokos, The
Mirror, Dress Suit, Mystic Peak, Etymo-
logy and Riawena, are engaged in the
Australian Hurdle on August 4.
Jack Holt may play a strong hand in
the three-year-old classics next spring
with Hyperion, the Pantheon colt sent
across from Westralia by W. H. Vincent,
of the W.A.T.C. committee. Holt did
exceedingly well in the past with such
horses from Groperland as Mistico,
Eurythmic, Easingwold, Lilypond and
Maple. He won “first up” at Caulfield
with Eurythmic at long odds, and re-
peated that achievement at “the Heath”
on Saturday with Hyperion. The natty
little black colt was deemed backward
in condition, and McShortodds offered
15 to 1, but Hyperion paid only 11 to 1
on the tote. Coming at the right end,
Hyperion caught Sol Green’s gelding,
Fersen, a few strides from the post and
scored by three-quarters of a length.
Hyperion was handicapped to concede
Fersen (Verbius —Gallantry) 251 b., but
R. Heather claimed 51b. apprentice
allowance.
The quality of Hyperion is unquestion-
able. By Peter Pan’s sire, he was bred
by Percy Miller and is out of Opera, by
Comedy King from Ellen Graeme, a
mare imported by the late Norman
Falkiner in the days of the Noorilim
(Vic.) stud. Hyperion cost 250gns. as a
yearling. His Caulfield victory was
gained in the second division of the
Lillimur Two-year-old. The first divi-
sion went to Arroba, trained by D. J.
Price, who followed up his success in the
Two-year-old Mile at Flemington. There
seems more stamina in Arroba than in
any other galloper by Manfred that has
performed in Melbourne. His dam is by
Wallace from Sizzle, and, therefore, a
sister to Patrobas.
By taking the Murrumbeena Handicap
Glideaway won his third race on end for
J G. Russell and C. T. Godby. He
squeezed home by the barest margin
from Gallibrook, with little Dick Devon
a fast-finishing third. His Highness, the
best galloper sired by King Ingoda to
date, landed the Malvina Welter in gal-
lant style. Folk Lore (second) is the
filly that L. K. S. Mackinnon bred in
France to Australian time, having shipped
Susie Pye overseas to be mated with
Dark Legend. Before long Jack Holt
will win a race with Folk Lore. She
started at 50 to 1.
* * * *
Some Boy, always reckoned a smart
galloper, capped all previous perform-
ances by leading throughout in the first
division of the Flying Handicap at
Moorefield—he is trained there. Sky
Brightener and Golden Gate chased him
home. Some Boy started at fives. Bartle
got him going smartly—he was moving
when the barrier was released —and this
won him the race, as he was able to beat
Le Touquet for the lead. Veilantif and
Leila Vale were just behind the placed
horses. Veilantif will be all the better
for the outing.
King Moab (10 to 1) went kindly for
Darby Munro in the second division.
Martingale and Causina cut at each other
to such purpose that King Moab met
with little opposition when he tackled
them. Omagh was backed, but when
pressure was applied he could not come
on. King Moab, who now carries
the colors of trotting sportsman G.
Brown, gave Munro his third winning
ride —he had scored on King Moab’s
stable-mate, Dazzle (6 to 1), and on
Prince Yamba (7 to 2) in divisions of
the Kogarah Stakes.
The Moorefield Handicap brought
about the destruction of the promising
Sunstone, who fell and broke a leg. Dan
Lewis was fairly confident of pastoralist
Malcolm Mackellar’s Eton Lady seeing
out the journey, and she was backed
from 20 to 14 to 1. Tortoni appeared
to have the race in his keeping at the
turn, but Eton Lady, well ridden by the
apprentice Hanley, came on the out-
side to get the verdict in the last couple
of strides, with Maurice Bede third.
The Brewer, a big chestnut by Tre-
clare from a Linacre mare, Sparkling
Cascade, was backed from tens to 7 to
2 (favorite) in the Maiden Juvenile, and
made every post a winner. He is a
stable-mate of Jacko and Regal Son,
and more successes should come his
way.
Multigris had been shaping so con-
sistently that his victory in the Carlton
Mile was anticipated. Favorite, with
Persian, at twos, he recorded a sterling
performance. Ramrod, who likes the
Moorefield track, stole a big lead at the
three-furlong pole; but Multigris re-
sponded like a good one and beat
Ramrod by half a neck, with the improv-
ing Delray a good third. Persian, un-
lucky in running, was fourth. Multigris
is in the Epsom with 7st. 21b. and has
a chance.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
At Brisbane on June 29 Penchiff beat
Clarke by two falls to one. At Leich-
hardt on Saturday night the American
appeared a better wrestler than the Bul-
garian, though inferior in gymnastics.
Clarke stuck to straight wrestling, and
gained a fall in the fourth. There was
little between them throughout a fast
fifth ; in the sixth the Yank fell a victim
to Penchiff’s short-arm scissors. Draw.
Woodfull’s Men
The two first days of the fourth Test
match at Leeds can be ranked as among
the most sensational of the long series.
The strong English batting side was at
the wickets nearly all the first day for
a paltry 200. In the short interval before
stumps, Australia lost three wickets
for 39. On Saturday Bradman and
Ponsford were not separated until
Ponsford trod on his wicket hitting a
four to leg and was out for 181. The
pair had hoisted the score from 39 to
427, the partnership of 388 being a Test
record for any wicket. At stumps it was
four for 494, Bradman 271 n.o. and
McCabe 18 n.o.
Woodfull again lost the toss—the
Board of Control should have shouted
him a course of instruction under Herb
Collins before leaving—and England
went in on what is described as an easy
pitch. Opening batsman Keeton —who
had replaced the injured Sutcliffe—was
caught by Oldfield off O’Reilly for 25
with 43 on the board. Walters batted
oh to 44, when a c. and b. by Chipper-
field dismissed him. Hammond looked
dangerous until. Wall clean-bowled him
for 37; then Hendren was bowled by
Chipperfield for 27, and four were gone
for 135. Grimmett got his first wicket
when Oldfield stumped Wyatt for 19, and
O’Reilly “legged” Leyland when he was
16. Six were down for 170, and Ames,
Hopwood, Verity, Mitchell and Bowes
could only add 28 runs among them.
There were only two leg byes, and Old-
field accounted for four batsmen, three
off Grimmett.
Grimmett, condemned by one of Aus-
tralia’s most vociferous cricket writers
as a has-been bowler to whom the Eng-
lish batsmen were thoroughly accus-
tomed, had the lot tied up, and ended
with 4 for 57. Wall only took one for
57, but it was Hammond, just as he was
getting set. O’Reilly sent back Keeton,
Hopwood and the dangerous Leyland
for 46. Chipperfield bowled really well,
getting Walters and Hendren for 35.
Australia struck its share of disaster
when opening a short while before
stumps with Ponsford and Brown. The
pair ran quietly to 37, when Brown was
bowled by Bowes. With only a few
minutes to go, Oldfield was sent in and
was sent back by the same bowler for
a duck. Woodfull, following almost on
stumps, also fell to the spectacled Tyke.
It is difficult to swallow the good-wicket
theory. Here were 13 batsmen, some of
them the world’s best, sent to the right-
about in a day. It looks to the experi-
enced eye that after the influence of the
early shower worked off the pitch, rain-
soaked some days previously, it gave the
spin bowlers a lot of help. One has only
to run down the scores after the first
four English wickets to stumps to realise
that something was happening.
Ponsford (22 n. 0.) and Bradman
resumed on Saturday on a pitch that
was now perfection. After a careful
start both scored freely, Bradman show-
ing a return to his style of 1930
and completely dropping the slapdash
methods which have marked his play this
tour. Both men punished the weak stuff
unmercifully and, though the English
fielding remained keen throughout, were
right on top after the first hour or so.
Bowes took no more wickets, his figures
being 3 for 99. Verity got the credit
of Ponsford’s wicket, but was spanked as
he rarely has been before by Australian
batsmen. Hammond, Mitchell, Hopwood
and Leyland also bowled.

Footbrawl
None of Melbourne’s Saturday League
games amounted to much, though the
collision of ’Wood and ’Scray brought a
huge crowd and an exciting finish. Faster
and more dashing, Footscray pinned the
Magpies down to a few points’ lead, and
•in the last term got its head in front.
But the methodical precision of the
’Wood machine collected the necessary
points—’Wood, 105 ; ’Scray, 95. Rich-
mond had a somewhat similar experi-
ence at North Melbourne, the Norths,
up to lemon-time, setting their bar-
rackers cheering the victory-to-be. It
is the score at the linish that counts, and
when Richmond settled down it was soon
over —Richmond, 99 ; North, 78. On
Carlton Oval, where 20,000 supporters
and Gov. Huntingfield attended, the
home side found Essendon’s pace and
position play baffling. Settling down,
Carlton swept the “Same Old” off its feet,
and won by 148 to 109. South Mel-
bourne, on the M. C. Ground, handed
Melbourne an unmannerly hiding—lss
to 99. Geelong came up to Fitzroy, and
scored 102 points against ’Roy’s 71 ; and
St. Kilda got the better of Hawthorn
with 88 to 72.
* * * *
Sydney’s R.U. games for the Shute
Shield saw Randwick beaten 16-3 by
Manly in a forward battle. Randwick
still heads the list, 2 points ahead of
Manly. University was all out to down
Parramatta 15-12 at the latter’s ground,
and Northern Suburbs, also at home, had
to fight to better Eastern by 14 to 9.
Drummoyne convincingly defeated West-
ern Suburbs by 18-6.
In the Rugby League matches Western
Suburbs suffered its first defeat of the
season, being downed by Eastern Suburbs
32-8. Newtown had an easy passage
against University, winning 22-7. At
Earl Park St. George scored 32-9 against
Balmain. At Chatswood South Sydney
and North drew, 11-11.
* * * *
Reporting the case of a Leichhardt
junior, and a plea for clemency made by
H. F. Benning, Sydney “D.T.” attributed
to Mr. Benning the remark that “a
player should not be disqualified for life
unless he has killed a player or a
referee.” “Footballers will wonder why
Benning dragged in the referee,” a
Bulletin contributor observed (B.
18/7/’34); and Mr. Benning objects.
I have been the University club dele-
gate since 1928 (with only one break owing
to absence), alternate delegate to the Aus-
tralian Board of Control, manager of the
1930 N.S.W. team to Queensland, selected
representative of the League in the Queens-
land League v. Brisbane League dispute
and in the Group 9 v. N.S.W. League dis-
pute. I have not earned or deserved a
reputation for unsportsmanlike remarks
or conduct.
Precisely; but Mr. Benning admits
having made “a jesting reply to an inter-
ruption,” and surely a newspaper com-
ment may be offered in the same spirit.
{Continued on page 36.)
Racquet and Bawl
The horn of the righteous who listened-
in to Bradman’s huge cricket score in the
Leeds Test was further exalted by the
news that Crawford and McGrath had
both won their singles matches in the
final of the European Davis Cup zone
against America. Crawford walked
through Shields in the first two sets,
winning 6-1, 6-2. Shields fought hard in
the third, and carried it to double figures
before the Australian made the scores
12-10. McGrath’s win from S. B. Wood,
rated America’s best, was a surprise
packet. It was no fluke, but a hard battle,
as the scores, 7-5, 6-4, 1-6, 9-7, show.

Under the Whip
Walter Brunton, the A.J.C. committee-
man, already has one of King George’s
cups, won for him at Brisbane by Val-
paraiso, and another might have been
secured for him by Mr. Kerry if that
horse had reached his top in the autumn
instead of the winter. Mr. Kerry’s form
at Grafton last week was very fine.
Carrying 9st. 31b. he downed Cercello
and Wee Jack in the C.R.J.C. Handicap,
and up 111 b. in the Grafton Cup, run
next day, he finished too strongly for
Confab and Regal Star. Pratt rode him
each time, and each time he was favorite.
To Confab, who won a good race at
Randwick last Easter, he was conceding
291 b. Pat Nailon trains Mr. Kerry for
Walter Brunton, as he did Valparaiso.
Confab is owned and trained by Jack
Kelso. These trainers have been closely
associated in their lives. Nailon was
William Kelso’s head man when the son
was an infant, and when Jack Kelso set
up for himself —he was the youngest No.
I trainer at Randwick —he bought Pa*
Nailon’s stables.
* * * *
“Moonee Valley”: When the V.R.C.
officials two years ago refused to renew
the licenses of a number of jockeys and
bookmakers everyone wondered what it
was all about. Several of the bagmen have
successfully applied for reinstatement,
and now all the 11 suspended jockeys
have handed in their applications. Most
of them have been allowed to ride work,
and one, P. Egan, who was an apprentice
when he went on the peg, has been per-
mitted to complete his indentures.
* * * *
“Eagle Farm”: Half a dozen Brisbane
jockeys have been getting letters from
deluded backers cursing the recipients
for putting them on to stiffs. Some of
the letters, especially those from the
female punters —as always, more rabid
than the male—have threatened to report
the horsemen to the stipes. Some enter-
prising lad has evidently been working
an old lurk.
* * * *
“Haro”: Just as in the good old days
those languishing in the jug or waiting
for the gallows took fresh hope at the
news of a royal visit, with its possibility
of clemency, so a good many Queens-
land gentlemen in reduced circumstances
are hoping that the arrival of the Duke
of Gloucester will soften the heart of
the Q.T.C. and induce it to lift the penal-
ties imposed on owners, trainers and
riders in the past. The Queensland rac-
ing calendar has two pages filled with
the names of the stricken ones, and the
poultices range from a month to a lifer,
some of them going back to 1920.
♦ * # *
“Marybyrnong”: The V.R.C. is mak-
ing considerable additions to stake-
money. There will be £650 extra for the
mid-August meeting, when a new race,
the Nerrin Nerrin Handicap, in memory
of Agar Wynne, will replace the August
Handicap. For the spring meeting
£12,200 has been added in an effort to
make it the outstanding item of the cen-
tenary celebrations. One of the fea-
tures will be the Duke of Gloucester
Cup, which takes the place of the V.R.C.
Handicap on the fourth day. The Wind-
sor Hurdle of £650 will be another new
event on this day. The C. B. Fisher Plate
will be run on the third day, while the
Linlithgow Stakes will be under w.f.a.
conditions instead of special weights as
formerly. Chairman Mackinnon has
voiced a warning that the increases for
the centenary festival may not be main-
tained at later meetings.
* * * *
Mooi Paard”: The South African
Union has got itself into a mild tangle
with its Australian opposite number
Pretzel was bought by a South African
owner, and when the nag arrived at
Durban the Customs bunged a duty of
£lOO on him, plus a dumping duty of
£250. South African dumping duties
are supposed to apply only to goods detri-
mental to South African industries, and
the Australian Government is arguing
the point. It is on a good wicket, for
South Africa has yet to establish a decent
thoroughbred strain of its own. When
writer knew racing thereaway, most of
the horses were imports from Britain or
the Argentine, with a few from this
country. In a considerable experience of
“Funny game golf, isn’t it?”
“It is—the way you play it.”
racing at Johannesburg, Pietermaritzburg,
Durban and Capetown a few years ago,
he cannqt recall one country-bred of
even selling-plate class.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australian match with Yorkshire
ended in that atmosphere of don’t-care-a-
damnedness associated with games
against counties. The wicket rolled
out all right after a dry Sunday, and
Yorkshire reached 340, Sellers being top-
scorer with 105 (Grimmett 4 for 113,
Ebeling 2 for 78). Australia’s reply re-
sulted in 348, the most cheering part of
which was 140 by Bradman, made in his
old-time style after the scratchy start we
have grown to expect from him now.
The runs were made in 115 minutes, and
included two sixers. Woodfull raked 54
together and Darling 47. Ebeling held
the tail up long enough to pass York-
shire’s score. Bowes bowled really well,
to take 7 for 100. Yorkshire went for
157 in the second shot. But for ’keeper
Woods, who opened vice the injured Sut-
cliffe and made 59, the flop would have
been floppier. Wall bobbed up with 3
for 36, Mitchell, Leyland and Sellers
being his victims; Fleetwood-Smith
(3-39) also did well. With 150 to win
and only 40 minutes to get them in,
Australia lost Brown l.b.w. to Macaulay
on the last ball of the day for 12. The
score was 28, and McCabe was 14 n.o.
* * * *
“Tadcaster”: I don’t know whether
any member of the Eleven drinks what
I was taught to regard as “aale,” but
if anyone does he has a chance to own
about the most fascinating vehicle
for conveying the Elizabethan beverage
from its native wood to the destination
of all good drinks that I have seen in a
long experience. This is a silver cup,
presented by the Duke of Manchester to
the first Australian Eleven in England,
and is inscribed with their names. Jeweller
Percy Marks has come into possession of
the historic trophy, and he will present it
to the player with the best batting
average at the end of the present tour of
England. Measuring up with a trained
eye the cup’s cubic capacity as it stood
in the window the other day, I should
say it holds well over a quart. Stan
McCabe looks the likely winner at
present, and if he wants any help to
empty it when the filling ceremony comes
on he can call on me.
* * * #
“Parmelia”: At Fremantle a young
and cocksure member of the Australian
team was asked his opinion of Brown
and Fingleton. The latter was airily dis-
missed as outside Test class, but of
Brown it was grudgingly conceded that
he was a fair bat, although “lucky to be
making the trip with us.” There is a big
gap between Brown and his critic on the
list of averages.
* * * *
“Statist”: The Australian figures up
to the end of the Yorkshire match show
a marked improvement in Bradman’s
case, he having at last reached four
figures. His aggregate of 1095 with
two not-outs brings him to third place
with an average of 57.63. In Tests his
figures are 133 runs for five innings—26.6
average. Ponsford, with 1022 runs, is
second in the averages with 68.13. His
Test figures are 100 runs for three com-
pleted innings—average 30.33. McCabe
tops the list with 1397 runs and an
average of 77.61. In Tests he has played
five completed innings for an average of
75.2. Of the bowlers Grimmett has
taken 82 wickets costing 19.96 apiece.
His Test figures are 10 for 372. O’Reilly’s
73 wickets have cost 16.84 each, and
his 19 Test wickets 23.33 each. Wall
has bagged 37 wickets for 28.56. In the
Tests his five wickets have cost 76 runs
apiece.
* * * *
“Dizzy Limit”: The English women’s
cricket team for Australia has been
chosen. All are over 21 and under 25.
The skipper. Miss Archdale, is a barrister,
so umpires had better brush up their
cricket law. There are 16 in all, includ-
ing four wicket-keepers, though whether
they will all officiate at once is not
stated. The English cricket world (female
section) is at present in the throes of a
controversy as to what the team’s cos-
tume will be. There are two parties,
one backing the present skirted togs, and
the other all out for shorts.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg”: Darned funny to read
in the cables of the horror of a Professor
Murphy at the discovery that a sweep
had been formed on the Australia v.
Lancashire match. Before the Austra-
lians landed in England writer pointed
out that London commission agents were
opening books on Test results, and that
even Lloyd’s was open to take a gamble
on anything connected with a Test match,
from the number of l.b.ws. to the maker
of the highest score. The cold truth
is that, in England at least, cricket has
always been a heavy gambling proposi-
tion. Writer has spoken with English-
men who can recall when games were
played between amateur sides for stakes
as high as £lOOO, and that well into the
reign of Queen Victoria. In Australia it
is difficult to get a bet to money from a
regular fielder. The reason is that the
allegedly gambling Australian is not a
punter’s bootlace compared with Cousin
Choom overseas.
Footbrawl
“Black and White”: When the tenth
round of Adelaide League football
ended, the premiership table revealed an
anomalous situation. The team at the
bottom, South Adelaide, has scored a
higher aggregate of points, 1141, than
any other. Port Adelaide, next to last,
runs a close second in aggregate with
1102, while West Torrens, at the head
of the table, has the lowest aggregate,
937. The second team, Sturt, is next
with 965. The moral is that many wins
by narrow margins are better than a
couple of runaway victories ; otherwise,
that consistency is a jewel.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The ugly scene during the
Carlton-Collingwood football match (B.
18/7/’34) roused the Melbourne press
and public to emphatic protest, yet little
was done. Of those reported by the
umpire for punching and kicking, only
one was dealt with by a six weeks’ sus-
pension, though Syd Coventry, one of
the victims, was still in bed four days
after the match. This sort of thing will
never stop until the V.F.L. follows the
example of other football codes and
authorises the umpire to send an offender
off the field, instead of merely report-
ing him.

“Richmond”: Not only do the Mel-
bourne football clubs growl at the huge
bites taken out of their gates by the
ground managements (B. 18 /7 / ’34), but
they complain that they never get a smell
of other large profits made by the
ground controllers. Bars, sales of sweets,
etc., advertising and broadcasting rights
all provide a pretty penny in the course
of an afternoon. Although all this arises
entirely out of the football, the grounds
stick to every bean of the extra money.
The clubs estimate that it costs £l2O to
put a team in the field every Saturday,
and consider they should get a bigger
cut of profits Which they, and they alone,
make possible.

ganui, and if the visitors are as bulky as
reported it may be necessary to hire the
Harbor Trust crane used by Kingsford
Smith to get his ’plane off the steamer.
One interesting item about the visitors is
that they will play the South African 3-4-1
scrum formation instead of their histori-
cal 2-3-2 pack. This means that for the
first time in football story the M.L.
players will take the field without a wing-
forward. Probably the wing-forward has
been responsible for more cursing and
recriminations than even the referee. In
Australian, British and South African
eyes he has always been the personifica-
tion of everything that stands for beating
the rules while technically complying
with them, and his passing will be re-
gretted by no one.

“Off-Side”: Rugby Union football
seems to have taken strong root in the
Atlantic States of the U.S.A. Several
flourishing unions have been formed all
under the wing of the Eastern R.U. of
America, to give it its full title. This has
invited the All-Blacks to call in on their
way back from their tour of Britain next
year and get what is being readied up for
them. As Canada is also asking for
matches, the M.L.R.U. will probably
click.
* * * *
“Senax”: Some people never know
when to stop. Cyril Barden, a Bogga-
billa grazier, suffered a broken leg while
playing in a match at Goondiwindi,
southern Queensland. Barden was a
member of the A.I.F. team which made
such a name for itself abroad and at
home after the Armistice. He has been
playing the game every season since he
was demobbed.
* * * *
“Gate”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
continues to worry over the falling-off
in attendances at club games. A remedy
which may be tried is the institution of
“home-and-home” matches among the
clubs instead of the present practice of
presenting one “match of the day” at
Sydney Sports Ground. Supporters of
the scheme think that barrackers for a
district club will be more willing to
attend in numbers at their home ground
than to take the long journey from out-
lying suburbs to the star turn at the
Sports Ground.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: Brisbane has been grinning
at an incident arising from a box-on
between forwards during the match be-
tween Brisbane and N.S.W. The fuss
occured on a Thursday, and on Friday
morning the manager of the local
stadium was on the Ma Staters’ doormat
at dawn with a contract all ready to sign.
It provided for a six-round match at the
stadium between Gibbs, of N.S.W., and
Rudd, of Queensland, both of whom had
been ordered off. A £lO trophy or purse
was offered. It was declined.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Lofter”: Nineteen-year-old Jim Fer-
rier’s remarkable consistency during the
past two golfing seasons has started a
movement to send him overseas for the
British amateur and open championships
next year. His dad, who taught him, is
all for having the boy wait until
after the Melbourne centenary tourney,
when he will meet many of the overseas
golfing visitors, including Sarazen and
Kirkwood. If he comes out of that
trial with credit, the tour abroad will
be considered. Always a distance-getter
from the tee and a fine putter, the lad
has recently given more attention to his
approaches. How he has profited can be
seen in his runaway win from Queens-
lander Radcliffe in the N.S.W. champion-
ship, in which his approaching from all
sorts of lies was extraordinary.
H*
“Brassey”: Though Odette Lefebvre
and Joan Hammond started hot favor-
ites for the N.S.W. women’s foursomes
at Royal Sydney, the ex-champion and
champion of the State didn’t have a look
in. The Manly pair, Mrs. Ctements and
Miss Buckle, won with six strokes to the
good from Miss Wray and Mrs. Slack.
The winners were consistency itself; the
two rounds were done in 165—84, 81.
Mrs. Clements captured the State title in
1929.
* * * *
“St. Colombes”: The French asso-
ciate title was taken this year by the 17-
year-old London girl Pam Barton. The
sensation she made in the British
women’s championship when she came
from nowhere and ran Mrs. Holm to a
short head in the final is not forgotten
yet. It is worth noting that Maorilander
Betty Gaisford did well in this tourney,
getting as far as the quarter-finals. Her
mate, Oliver Kay, who can give her a
stroke a hole in M.L., failed early in this
event, just as she did in the British one,
and has evidently lost her form com-
pletely for the time being.
“Carnoustie”: Cabled that the King,
asked why he had given up golf, replied
that it was because it made him so
damned angry. There are people who
would think that a poor excuse for aban-
doning the game while other alternatives
remained. I am constrained to tell the
chestnut of the Scottish minister who
emerged, white-faced, from a long stay
in the bunker, and hissed through his
teeth “Aweel, I’ll hae tae gie it up.”
“Man,” replied a staggered crony, “gie
up gowfl ” “Na, na,” was the hasty
reply, “the meenistry.”
* * * *
“Hoylake”: The English golf team for
Australia has taken shape. Two good
men in D. Martin and J. McLean have
accepted, and T. Bourn and L. G.
Garnett are willing if the authorities at
the other end endorse them. Garnett is
a Londoner, young, and a mighty hitter,
who all but downed the ultimate winner,
Yankee Lawson Little, in the semi-finals
of the British amateur championships.
McLean is one of the best of the young
Scottish amateurs. *He was the object
of the notorious display by the crowd
in the other semi-final of the amateur
tourney, when artisan Wallace’s Glasgow
following made things as hot for his
opponent as possible. Bourn was Eng-
lish amateur champion in 1930, and has
also won the French title. Martin is
an Oxford blue who has been doing
well in the best golf for a couple of
“ ’Sail ri', mum ; we’re lish’nin’-in t’ th’ Tesht.”
seasons past. The team sails by the
Orford on September 15.
* * * *
“Sunningdale”: Two of England’s
leading golf professionals spent a tor-
tured hour or two the other day. They
were playing in a tournament at Fair-
haven for which the first prize was
£750 cash. R. A. Whitcombe and M.
Seymour met in the final, and tied with
aggregates of 284. They replayed, with
that £750 fairy gold dancing mockingly
before them down the fairway, and again
tied for the two rounds. In desperation
they gave it a go for another nine holes.
Whitcombe finished two up on Seymour
with 34 and collected the elusive goblins.
* * * *
“Sturt”: Golf in Adelaide is having
some odd developments. Alec McLach-
lan—his father once won a Melbourne
Cup with White Nose—put down
Ackland-Horman, the State champion,
by 6 and 4 for the supremacy of
Royal Adelaide club. Kooyonga, after
just beating the said R.A. club team,
itself went down surprisingly to Glenelg,
previously considered hardly on the
golfing map.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: The A.L.T.A. has been
worded by S. R. Youdale that Perry and
Hughes are certain to make the trip for
the big tennis spree in Melbourne,
together with Dorothy Round and the
Lyle and Dearman girls. Stefani, of Italy,
and Maier, of Spain, will also come
along, and South Africa is sending Kirby
and Malcolm. The V.L.T.A. is spending
£3OOO on improvements at Kooyong in
expectation of the overseas invasion.
“Top Spin”: The overseas stars will be
here for the Ma State championships,
which open on November 23. The Vic-
torian State tourney will begin on
December 6, and Davis Cup manager
Youdale has been asked by cable to see
that all hands get away in time for these
two shows.
“Centre Court”: Almost any day now
we may expect to hear the decision of
the Davis Cup conference on the pro-
posal that the tourney be held every
two years. South Africa sponsors the pro-
posal ; with Australia it feels the handi-
cap of sending players away each year
with the certainty of their absence from
local tennis for six months. Another
hurdle is the great cost of transporting
a team on the long journey overseas. It
is known that Dwight Davis, founder ot
the Cup contest, desires it to continue
an annual affair, and, since the institu-
tion of the elimination matches in the
European zone each year has consider-
ably shortened the tourney, his views are
likely to carry the day.
# * * *
“Fitzcray”: A Melbourne paper is
annoyed with the centenary tennis
heads for refusing to invite the
Yankee championette, Helen Jacobs.
That is nothing to the disappointment
caused by the news that Mrs. Fernley-
Whittingstall will not be coming.
The lady’s good looks and the fact that
she freely displays what a London tennis
writer recently referred to as “the most
beautiful legs in the game” in ravishing
pale-blue pleated shorts made her the
first pick among both sexes on this side
when a visit of English women was first
mooted.
* * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The thorough-
going German has invented a method of
playing tennis by oneself. The player
stands before a tennis net and plays his
shot at a drop curtain painted to look
like a tennis court on the other side of
the net. The spot at which the ball
strikes the curtain corresponds to its
flight on a proper court, and the player
can thus judge his errors and correct
them. Presumably a dummy umpire to
curse and a ditto linesman for tempera-
mental players to glare at are part of
the outfit, though this is not stated.
Miscellaneous
Hubert Opperman broke the record for
the 866 miles from Land’s End in Corn-
wall to John o’ Groats on the northern
tip of Scotland, driving his pushbike
through in 58 hours. This was 3 hours
32 minutes better than the figures put up
by Englishman J. W. Rossiter, which
had stood for years. Before starting on
this run, “Oppy” smashed several other
records, including Dick Turpin’s time on
Black Bess from London to York.
*/* * *
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian rowing
heads are expecting to hear any day that
an English eight will come to Australia
for the centenary Henley-on-Yarra. Syd
Middleton, the Australian oarsman of
other days, who now abides in London,
writes that he has been putting the screw
on the London club, which was to give
a decision some time this month.
London won the championship at the
last Empire Games, and has taken the
Grand Challenge at Henley for the last
three years.
* * * *
“Stamford Bridge”: England held the
national track and field championships
at the White City this year, and, much
to their disgust, members of the
Dominion teams now in London for the
Empire Games were not allowed to
compete. The 100 went to J. Sir, a Hun-
garian, in 9 9-10 sec. Another Hun-
garian, Bodosi, took the high jump with
6ft. 3in., and Kuscokinski, a Pole, won
the three miles. Frenchman Paul won
the long jump, covering 23ft. 9in. Eng-
land’s best was Duncan’s 22ft. a
lot worse than Australian Jack Metcalfe’s
figures. England took the rest of the 11
events, Maorilander Lovelock helping in
the mile, travelled in 4min. 26 3-ssec.
* * * *
“Aileron”: The King’s Cup aeroplane
race in England this year was won by
Flight-Lieut. Schofield, one of the
Schneider Trophy team of 1926. He
flew a Monospar and averaged 134.16
m.p.h. over six circuits of 234- miles.
Three Australians competed. H. F.
Broadbent, in a Fox Moth, reached the
semi-final. J. D. Kirwan, a Westralian,
was forced down by a torrential storm,
and Captain Percival, flying one of his
own Gulls for Prince George, was placed
fifth. The weather was very bad.
* * * *
Alec Kermode, given out by Umpire
Time in his native Balmain (N.S.W.) at
58, was one of the best of the many good
cricketers England has recruited from
Australia, a list beginning with Ferris
and ending for the present with Hunt,
another Balmainer. Alec was a right-
hand medium bowler who was just show-
ing up in Sheffield cricket when the
astute eye of Archie Maclaren spotted
him in 1901. For years after Kermode
was Lancashire’s right-bower bowler.
Some time ago he came back to Sydney,
and for a time tried his hand in grade
cricket, but soon dropped out of the
bigger stuff.
“Splash”: After many
attempts, the Australian swim-
ming authorities have managed
to bag a couple of Japanese
swimmers for the coming sea-
son. Miyazaki, Olympic 100-
metre free-style champion, and
Kiyokawa, the 100-metre back-
stroke Olympian, are the two
named. Another may be Kila-
mura, the 16-year-old winner
of the 1500-metre go at Los
Angeles. A 14-year-old Chin-
ese with the inspiring name of
Kwak Hong may also make
the trip. He is a breaststroke
specialist.
* * *
“Ride Off”: Polo players
are already getting ready for
the centenary tourney for the
Gold Cup which is listed for
Cup week in Melbourne. In
addition to teams from N.S.W.,
Victoria, South Australia and
probably Queensland, a Maori-
land side will definitely be
there. Five players are com-
ing,. G. H. Grigg (hep. 5), R
M. Johnson, capt. (5), G. Hen-
nessy (5), D. W. Gould (7)
and D. H. Riddiford (4). They
will leave M.L. early in
October, and will have several
weeks for practice and match
play before the tournament starts. We
had one M.L. side in Australia in the
first tourney for the Australasian Cup
some years ago. They showed them-
selves able players, but their ponies could
not live with ours.
* * * *
“Goalie”: N.S.W. lacrosse players are
not to have an entirely empty season.
Victoria has offered to hop off at Sydney
on its trip to Queensland and play a
match against the locals this month. As
this will give the Welshmen a chance to
shake a team together for the scheduled
fixtures with Queensland when the
Bananalanders come to Sydney in
August, the offer has been accepted.
Nothing has yet been done about the
proposed visit of a Canuck team (B.
4/11/ ’34), but president Ferron, of the
V.L.A., has offered to raise £lOOO to
finance the visit.
* * * *
“Topping Lift”: An unusual yacht-
ing interlude was the strike of the pro-
fessional crew of the Endeavour, the
challenger for the America’s Cup. Four-
teen of the 22 making up the crew have
been paid off, and their places will be
taken by amateurs. Manning these big
sailing yachts in America and Europe is
a lucrative business, and the men who
specialise in it are a pretty close corpora-
tion. No doubt the Endeavour crew
thought they saw a chance for a finan-
cial squeeze.


BUSINESS, ROBERRY, ETC.
Restored to Life
Promotion of gold-mining companies
b,RS suffered a check in N. S. Wales in
consequence of the Tullamore disclo-
sures ; but it is going on briskly in other
parts.
In Westralia there has been a black-
guard rush to acquire rights over long-
neglected holes in the ground abandoned
when the reef cut out or the under-
ground river became unmanageable, and
option-sellers are doing famously.
Indeed, prices asked for shows which
could have been bought for a few pounds
when gold was £4 4s. an ounce bring
back memories of the ’nineties, when
the salmon gum and mulga from Cool-
gardie to Lake Way were full of mugs.
It has been reserved for a syndicate
which took over the old Lady Shenton
leases at Menzies to ask for the largest
bite.
Mines Department records show the
Lady Shenton crushed 96,280 tons of ore
for 132,101 ounces of gold. Then “the
rich lode was cut off, and persistent
efforts failed to locate it,” and the com-
pany gave up the ghost. Lady Shenton
Options, Ltd., claims —or at least sur-
mises—that it has “located the southern
continuation of this lode in the hanging
wall at the bottom of a winze sunk from
a crosscut on the 340-feet level.” It has
broken out a whole “200 tons” of ore ;
“thousands of tons of low-grade ore in
the old workings are ready for breaking,”
and “there is also a quantity of sands
and slimes ready for treatment” (pre-
sumably at a Government battery), sub-
ject to royalty, to be fixed by the
Minister.
So the public is asked to come in. It
is invited to gobble up 500,000 shares
at ss.—2s. 6d. down and the balance in
“calls not exceeding 6d. per share per
month.” But people could not expect
to get a show like the Lady Shenton for
nothing.
Three hundred thousand shares, fully
paid up, are to be allotted to the vendor,
the Lady Shenton Options, Ltd., as part
of the purchase consideration; the balance
of the consideration, namely £15,000, is
payable in cash.
The list of provisional directors of the
Lady Shenton Gold Mines 61934), No
Liability, is headed by “James McCallum
Smith, M.L.A., newspaper manager,
Perth.” He is one of the leading seces-
sionists, and in every issue of his news-
paper the Federal Octopus, the Cor-
morant Commonwealth, gets it in the
neck. But while ruthless on this issue,
Mr. McCallum Smith does not entirely
reject the inhabitants of the Effete East;
“certain parcels of shares are to be set
aside for Adelaide, Melbourne and
Sydney subscribers.”
Fifteen thousand pounds in cash and
300,000 ss. shares for an almost-
forgotten mine in a long-dead town!
“O Sophonisba, Sophonisba, O!” Owe
Jim McCallum, Jim McCallum, Owe!
Trade with British Ports
“X.T.”: The Empire Trade number
of the Glasgow “Herald” contains a
long review by H. M. Ford, commercial
manager of the Clyde Trust, of Scot-
land’s commercial relations with Aus-
tralia. The writer declares that “there
is no quarter of the Empire so rich in
commodities which Scotland requires.”
He adds that the Commonwealth
has failed to realise the opportunities
of trade through Glasgow’s markets, yet
has been more persistent in its cry for
new markets than any other country.
Australia’s principal products, up to the
past year or two (he writes), “have been
virtually unknown in the 15,000 retail
shops in our area and in Scottish homes,
simply because Australia has clung to the
mistaken idea that her one and only
market in Britain is London.” Hence,
while Scottish housewives have been
urged repeatedly by the Empire Market-
ing Board, by Australia House and by
relatives in the Commonwealth to buy
Australian goods, they have been unable
to get them.
In the last year or two, the position
has been remedied in regard to dried
fruits, but things like butter and canned
fruits still lag badly.
It might be a good idea if, instead of
leaving provincial British trade develop-
ment to the ballyhoo department which
the Commonwealth maintains expen-
sively in London, bodies like the Clyde
Trust and the Ports of Bristol, Man-
Chester, Liverpool and Hull, which
clamor equally for Australian trade and
besiege every Australian visitor for the
reasons why they cannot get it, were
asked to act as Commonwealth agents
and deal direct with local Australian ex-
porting interests. They know local con-
ditions and requirements, and their heads
are mostly keen, highly-paid businessmen
who do not suffer from the civil-servant
complex.
Bond-hawkers at Work
“4 x 2”: In the course of my work in
a Queensland town, I am often asked to
advise on various subjects, generally of
a financial bearing. The latest is forestry
bonds. Our town has been invaded by
a carload of high-pressure salesmen, who
are inviting shop assistants and office
employees to lay up stores of future
wealth by buying blocks of pine-trees at
£l5 the quarter-acre.
Prospective buyers have asked me for
advice. My reply to all is: “Do you
read The Bulletin? Obviously you do
not, or you wouldn’t come to me.”
Bulletin issues of March 21, May 16
and 23 and June 6 and 20 are becoming
well-thumbed. Some inquirers showed
these issues to salesmen, whose reply
was “Oh, The Bulletin crabs any-
thing that isn’t in N. S. Wales!” It
satisfied some but not all.
Concerns carrying on a solid business
should not need a parcel of hawkers to
“work” strange towns for three or four
weeks and then leave* for parts un-
known. This consideration is sufficient
“Don’t tell me I’m in the wrong room !”
to deter those not carried away by glow-
ing estimates. If companies must have
country representation, surely some local
firm or person of repute could be
appointed to handle the business after
due investigation of the co.’s standing.
Some protection should be given to
fools and their money, but apparently
Governments do not care.
I know instances where members of
established life-assurance offices have
allowed their policies to lapse in order
to buy forestry bonds.
During the year to June 30 2,484,254
bales of" wool*were sold, about 400,000
less than in the previous year. The
average price realised was 15.8 d. per
pound and £2O Is. 9d. a bale. The
average for Victorian wool over the
period was 16.4 d. per lb., but the average
for the Commonwealth during June had
fallen to 9|d.
* * * *
At the week-end buyers in Australian
capitals were offering 3s. 2d. a bushel for
August deliveries of wheat. At that price
a man with a good crop and not out of
the way could show a profit; in parts
of Westralia the freight-rate to port is
4d. a bushel. There has been a harden-
ing tendency for some time, drought
having assisted the crop-reduction pro-
gramme in the U.S.A.
* * * *
The community-owned hotel at Ren-
mark (S.A.) continues to do well. After
spending £lB5O on improvements during
the financial year, the committee de-
clared a profit of £5858. Nearly every
local institution gets a piece of it: the
hospital £Boo,'the council £750, the Irri-
gation Trust £7OO, the recreation ground
£5OO, the swimming pool £3OO, the relief
committee £2OO, the racing club £2OO,
the agricultural high school £l5O, the
Mothers and Babies £lOO, the school
committees £l5O ; and £lOO goes off the
debt on the soldiers’ memorial.

A complete reorganisation of petrol
prices follows concerted action by all the
oil-supply companies' to introduce new
grades. The multi-cylinder engines of
1934 call for a better class of spirit;
hence “super qualities” blended to a
high anti-knock value, hitherto restricted
in use to aviation, are to go on the
market at the price of present first
grades. Some will have an ethyl con-
tent. Existing qualities will be reduced
to the current price of second grades—
Is. 6d. per gallon in most cases, though
a few lines, such as Texaco 400 motor
spirit, will be down to Is. sd.
He * * *
“X.”: Victoria has made a good move
in passing legislation to give the Elec-
tricity Commission power to control types
of electrical appliances. There has been
vigorous competition, and the cheap
radiator, toaster and water-heater have
become popular. Some of them are in-
efficient, though reasonably safe, but it
gives one palpitation of the heart to
merely look at others, and particularly
at the cheap plugs and accessories which
accompany them.
* t * *
“Green Lane”: The opening of the
great vehicular tunnel under the Mersey,
between Liverpool and Birkenhead, has
been greeted with a mighty flourish of
trumpets. One would think the work was
unique, but, as a matter of fact, Liver-
pool opened a sub-Mersey tunnel as long
ago as 1886. It carried a double line of
railway from the city to Rockferry and
linked up the railway lines already run-
ning into Liverpool with the Great
Western and Cambrian systems, which
had their termini on the Cheshire side.
There was a regular service between the
Cheshire suburbs and the city, the trains
being drawn by specially invented
engines supposed to consume their own
smoke. This they didn’t do, and the
tunnel atmosphere was as vile as that of
the old London Underground. As a con-
sequence, travellers preferred the older
ferry system from the great landing stages
at the foot of Water-street, and the
tunnel' a private enterprise, did not pay.
Later, when the docks were electrified,
the tunnel followed suit, with more satis-
factory results to shareholders.
He * * *
“Hyram”: The M.L. fertiliser cos.
raised their prices by 3s. 6d. per ton.
The Farmers’ Union brought pressure to
bear, and results were twofold: firstly
a threat, given publicity in all the Gov-
ernment-supporting journals, that the
price would be fixed at the old figure by
an Order-in-Council, and secondly a
threat made privately by the Government
to the cos. that their profits would in
future be limited to 7 p.c. of capital.
This was accompanied by an observation
that the Government saw no necessity
for fertiliser cos. to establish reserves. A
5 p.c. dividend, plus income tax, costs
the cos. 6 2-3 p.c., and they have long
been complaining that the depreciation
rate allowed them by the Taxation
Department is too small.
H« * * =!=
Transport “co-ordination” is a joke in
Westrafia, though the point of it may
be lost on owners of motor-lorries and
-waggons which have been regulated off
the roads. A choice example is quoted
from the “Primary Producer”:
West Leederville people are served by
Government trams, trains and trolley-’buses.
The services run almost parallel and only
a street apart. The trolley-’bus terminus
is outside the railway station.
Evidently the trolley-’bus is winning
the competition. Anyway, the tramways
manager reports a profit of £904 on
trolley-’bus operations for eight months.
* * * *
“Red Fern”: “Keg” complains of the
Sydney trammie being long looked on as
legitimate prey for the passers of bad
coins (B. 4/7/’34). But sometimes the
boot was on the other leg. There is an
ex-conductor who is serving a stiff sen-
tence for getting rid of brum bobs and
bogus sprats in the course of his profes-
sional duties. How many coins he dis-
posed of, with his unique opportunities,

“Lao-dah”: David Morris, of Mel-
bourne “Star,” has induced the “Argus”
proprietary to assist 25 or 30 copyboys,
whose jobs are usually dead-end ones, to
bring out a monthly mag., the
“Asteroid,” proceeds to Melbourne
Hospital. It contains all customary
features, plus anything the lads care to
invent. The first issue has disclosed a
youth who is regarded as a potential
Northcliffe. Everything will be written
by the boys, except a column by Neville
Smith, chief-of-staff of the “Star.” The
“Argus” has given its services free of
charge.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: The toothless gap in build-
ings on Adelaide’s North Terrace where
doctors’ residences used to stand, oppo-
site Government House, is to be filled
at last. Next to the Adelaide Club the
Shell Company’s building has lately
gone up, about the city’s highest. The
remaining space between this and the
Liberal Club has been marking time as
a parking-ground, but is now to be built
on by Goldsbrough Mort, who, ever
since they descended upon Adelaide to
take over the Bagot, Shakes and Lewis
business, have used the latter’s vener-
able King William-street premises.

“Toowong”: The Bureau of Industry’s
July report seems to brand Queensland
as the most prosperous of the States.
The average weekly wage for men is set
out as 88s. Id., or 7s. 7d. above the Com-
monwealth average, and the average
weekly hours worked are slightly less
than in other States. Only 15.8 p.c. of
all persons dependent on employment
are out of work, though many are
rationed. The “prosperity index,” based
on a collation of ratios in stock exchange,
banking, trade, employment, building
and traffic figures, shows a steady rise,
and the share index is at a higher level
than in April, 1928. In short, the
atmosphere is right for solid tax reduc-
tion to help industry to capitalise its
buoyant tendency.

“N.Y.”: People who hold a careless
view of American competition should
take a good look at the British trade-
balance figures for the past ten years.
The adverse balance against Britain last
year was £49,686,152, equal to 2j times
the value of her exports to U.S.A., while
in the past decade Uncle Sam has had
more out of John Bull by £1,100,000,000
in trade than John Bull <has had out of
him. Yet Uncle seems bent on killing
all this business, and his sales to G.B.
have dwindled from £241,000,000 to
£75,000,000 p.a. since 1924, while
Britain’s relative loss in export values has
been only £30,000,000 p.a. Sam may
be gaining in power, but certainly not
in pocket.

“Sailor”; “Papaki” (B. 4/7/’34) men-
tions that he knew the Australian abo.
before civilisation’s “diseases and drugs
got too firm a grip on him.” While
admitting that the white man’s disease and
sickness have taken a mighty toll of
Binghi, I think “Papaki” exaggerates the
influence of “drugs.” Cocaine is worth
about £2l an ounce, and opium, the last
time I had a hand in its control, was
around £l4 an ounce. The prices of
similar injurious soporifics are equally
high. Binghi hasn’t enough to buy a
few sticks of niki-niki, much less dope.
If “Papaki” calls alcohol a drug I must
say that in a lifelong experience I have
never seen more than half a dozen abos.
properly under the “influence.”
“Goonai”: Justice Brennan remarked
the other day that he would not have
Queensland turned into another Reno,
but certain unauthorised persons had
their easy divorce mills there before he
was born. The procedure went some-
thing like this. The Supreme Court, re-
moving its cutty from the fastnesses of
its beard, would remark: “Now, Toe
Rag, what name you wantum kick out
that one Mary?” To which the plaintiff,
standing on one leg and looking shyly at
Mother Earth, would respond almost in-
audibly: “That one killum me pfeller
too much!” “Along what?” the Bench
would inquire, and, the reasons being
given, it was next usual to see if anybody
else wanted Mary. Counsel’s objections
were met with a sound kick administered
in the place where it would do most good
and the custody of children was apt to
resolve itself into: “You wantum picca-
ninny, eh? What name? You like
catchum hair belong him, eh?” (hair
being a valuable commodity for making
rope and string). “Awright, Toe Rag
catchum hair, Mary catchum picca-
ninny!” There was never any delay,
either. Any old station-owner, sun-
downer, constable or J.P. felt himself
empowered to act if necessity arose.
« * * *
“Wondai”: Southern India is to try
Australia’s own dairy cattle —the Illa-
warra shorthorn from the N.S.W. South
Coast. The breed has a Bates shorthorn
base, with a dash of Devon and Ayrshire
thrown in, and it should suit the south
Indian country, much of which strongly
resembles the scrub lands of coastal
Queensland. It will be interesting to see
how the Commonwealth animal mixes
with the hardy cattle of Mysore and the
Deccan —not only indispensable to
industry, but the staple of the racing
game. The Mysore cattle are small,
white and muscular. It was with
them that Cornwallis and Wellington
learned their transport business, the
former carrying the baggage of his forces
in Tippoo’s wars with 80,000 of them.
The Illawarra bullock makes a good
haulage animal and produces immense
steers.
* * *
“Travel Stain”: Although crocodiles
may be increasing in outback rivers of
the North where the abo. has failed in
his job of keeping its eggs down, the in-
crease is offset in civilised areas by the
mere presence of man and his use of
dynamite, traps, firearms and poison.
Tell “Pandanus” (B. 13/6 / ’34) that
settlers in the Tully and at Mossman in-
variably get their ’gator wth strychnine
bait. One teaspoonful will stiffen a
croc, as big as a dinosaur. It is less
destructive than dynamite, which destroys
decent fish and spawn.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: The balance sheet of the
Levuka Chamber of Commerce shows
that, in spite of the low values ruling in
copra, the colony’s main export commo-
dity, the Fiji trade position is sound. The
trade balance is equal to 65 p.c. of the
value of imports, which pay an overall
average duty of over 25 p.c. With the
fall of the cocoanut business, sugar be-
comes the main industry. It is worth
about £1,200,000 p.a. Like Australia,
Fiji has had Splendid seasons during
the depression. The Levuka rainfalls —
105 inches in 1932 and 98 inches last year
—were the highest for over a decade.
4 # 4 $
“Liver”: A slab of official advertise-
ment appears in the Darwin “Govern-
ment Gazette” advising the northern
civil servants of what the Government is
doing to provide them with fruit. Apples
(Rome Beauties), which can be bought
in Sydney from 7s. to 9s. per case,
choicest packs, can be had from the N.T.
Government Railway at Darwin for 13s.
6d. a case or 7s. 9d. a half-bushel, and
export navel oranges, which are worth a
maximum of ss. a bushel in Sydney, are
on sale at 15s. a bushel or Bs. 6d. a half-
bushel. Skins are given in.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: It has been left to the North
to provide Australia with her first locally-
owned modern shipping service to Europe
outside the late Commonwealth Line.
W. R. Carpenter and Co., the firm which
sponsors it, has been in the copra trade
for many years, but hitherto its business
has been done with chartered ships. The
new enterprise, started at a time when
cocoanut products are at their lowest,
speaks volumes for the confidence of men
who have a lifelong knowledge of tropi-
cal commercial conditions, in the future
of the lands above Twenty Eight. We
need a thousand Australian ships instead
of two, however. Without a mercantile
“Don’t be so inconsiderate, Joey! I told you I was locking up for the night”
marine of our own we should be para-
lysed if Britain were isolated from us in
war-time.
* * * *
“Agi”: Some misguided persons sug-
gest the founding of a copra industry in
tropical Queensland, and point out that
there are over 100 products of the cocoa-
nut for which there is a good market. The
erection of mills for extracting the oil
and generally preparing the products is
also advocated, with Brisbane as the
centre of the tracle, drawing supplies from
Fiji and the Solomons in addition to N.Q.
There are several hurdles. One is that
land on which cocoanuts will grow can
be much better employed. Another is
that copra-growing and -making is only
possible on a paying basis where native
labor is cheap and plentiful. Further,
if copra from the islands produced by
native labor were pooled with the Queens-
land white-grown and -manufactured pro-
duct there would be a hopeless price con-
fusion. It may be that Queensland could
grow enough copra to supply Australia.
Even then it is doubtful if it could be
sold. It can be taken for granted that
outside Australia not an ounce of it
could enter the market.
* * * *
“Towri”: The decision of the Ministry
of the Interior to shift the aborigines on
the Tennant’s Creek reserve to another
stamping ground, to allow the develop-
ment of a goldfield, has brought justified
protest. The Minister’s plea that the
abos, will be transferred to a larger,
better-watered and in every way more
desirable area is just so much humbug.
To the Australian native his stretch of
territory is more than an abiding place
and a hunting ground —it is literally his
spiritual home, and has a significance for
him which cannot attach to any new
territory, even if flowing with milk and
honey. The whole affair is strongly remi-
niscent of the circumstances in which a
British Government once came to the
rescue of the Griquas on the borders of
the Orange Free State and Cape Colony.
For years the Boers of the O.R.C. and
the natives scrapped intermittently over
undefined boundaries. Britain suddenly
resolved to protect the poor Griquas from
the Boers, and annexed a chunk of their
territory along the disputed boundary
line. That this included the recently-
discovered Kimberley diamond field was,
of course, a peculiar coincidence.
* * * *
“Easton’s Syrup”: Malaria, once a
scourge in far N.Q. and the adjacent
islands, has come back to some of the
latter with renewed vigor. The worst
outbreaks have been on Saibai and Yam,
two Papuan islands within Queensland.
Nearly everyone on the first island went
down, including the mission priest, G. H.
Darke, who has reported the matter to
the Bishop of Carpentaria. There were
11 deaths here, and the thing which
annoyed the good missionary most,
apparently, was the way the sufferers
turned from his quinine and other
remedies and, Christians though they pro-
fessed to be, went back to the old native
cures and superstitions.
* * * *
“G.G.6”: Why muck about trying to
grow wool? If you go on the land,
young man, trap rabbits. The country
between St. George district and the
N.S.W. border has lately been carrying a
rabbit to every blade of grass. One man,
who for years has spent money on
destroying all possible rabbit shelter, has
24 men trapping on his property. Not
far away a party of trappers have con-
tracted to take 60,000 bunnies off one
holding, and at last advices had the end
of the job in sight. But the fairly
numerous graziers who have spent hun-
dreds in getting rid of bunny don’t like
it a bit.
$ * * *
“Marsh”: Doing some night fishing on
one of the Whitsunday Passage islands
(N.Q.), my mate landed a wobbegong.
We bashed him unmercifully and cut
some bait slices from him. Twelve hours
later, when we returned for more bait,
the dead ’un bucked at the first jab of the
knife, slithered into the briny and moved
groggily off.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
At a gathering the other afternoon a well-
known Brisbane songstress inquired plaintively,
“What is the Douglas Credit system?”
Most of the women cheerfully acknowledged
ignorance; but one suggested, hopefully, that
it was a sort of system of barter under which,
instead of paying for things, we would have
to exchange, for instance, potatoes for meat.
The singer opened her eyes. “Goodness!”
she exclaimed. “I hope they don’t get it.
I haven’t got anything to exchange, and I’d
have to go out and sing to the butcher.”
The newest engagement is that of Val Brady,
the charming dark-haired elder daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. S. B. Brady (his father was Under-
secretary for Works, and Mrs. Brady was the
younger daughter of the veteran schoolmaster
W. Bevington, and is a sister of school-inspector
W. J. Bevington). The lucky lad is lan Grant,
son of General Grant. The little bride-to-be
is almost exactly like her aunt, Mabel Brady,
who was one of Brisbane’s prettiest girls less
than 20 years ago. Mrs. Bevington, senr.,
who is a youthful 84, is still finding life en-
joyable. There will be a few score teas for
the bride-to-be in the next few months.
So many balls have been arranged for the
next few weeks that there is more than a
chance of some of the lasses dancing their
slippers into holes, which is good for trade.
There will be more debs, at the ball on the
Naldera on July 30. Mrs. A. V. Logan will
present the buds to our Sir Leslie, who
will be piped aboard, navy fashion. The
Crfcche and Kindergarten and the Mission
to Seamen will share the profits.
The Journalists’ Ball happens on July 27, and
the committee vows that the show will be bigger,
brighter and better than ever. All alcoves
already have been taken, and extra copies of
the “Midnight Horror” ordered in advance.
The Law Students’ annual ball, on July 31,
is to be at the Belle Vue. It is a pity that
it will clash with the big entertainment and
fashion parade in the City Hall on the same
night to help along the Playgrounds’ Associa-
tion; but, as every night for the next month
seems to be booked for two or three events, it
cannot be helped. In the City Hall show,
Dorothy and Ina Jones, the Lady Mayoress’s
two slim daughters, are, for the first time, to
act as mannequins in the big parade.
The Matrons’ Ball is on August 2, and the
Bachelors and the Spinsters also have issued
invitations for dances in the same week. The
dancing mania has extended even to the man
in blue, and for the first time in history a
Police Ball is to be staged in the City Hall
on August 1. On the committee arc Mrs. A. H.
Whittingham and other social lights. The
Governor has promised to go along.
No lewer than 40 debs, will be presented to
Sir Leslie at the Masonic Ball at the Trocadero
to-night. Instead of being lined up, they will
take part in a pageant to be arrange'd by Mrs.
A. V. Perrott, whose husband is chairman of
the committee. The pageant is “The Passage of
Time,” and a tiny girl of three will first make
her appearance, then one slightly older, then a
miss in her early teens, and then the debs. Harry
Borrodale is taking care of several acts, and
there is to be a tremendous debutantes’ cake,
the top tier of which will be presented to the
Governor.
Eddie Cahill, who really is going abroad,
gave a farewell invitation recital in the Lord
Mayor’s reception-room.
The Brisbane Women’s Club entertained
Ruth Portrate at a welcome-home afternoon,
said the usual nice things, and handed over the
usual bouquet. Mrs. G. L. Byth, the presi-
dent, is a keen musician, and the club as a body
does more to help and foster music than many
organisations which pride themselves on their
highbrow instincts.
Major Tom Macleod and his wife, Lady
Aurea Macleod, both well known in the Long-
reach district, where Tom made his home for
some time after the war, are among the dele-
gates from Great Britain at the World Con-
vention of the W.C.T.U., which has just
opened at Stockholm. Isabel McCorkindale,
who has friends in all the Australian States,
is among the delegates from this country.
More women riders have entered for the
Brisbane Show this year than ever before,
among them Mrs. Stanley Schooley (she was
Hazel Willcocks, and before New Farm was
converted into a flat-dwellers’ suburb she and
her piebald pony and her flapping Titian
plaits were a regular part of the
scenery most mornings). Doris Hein-
dorff, who is secretary of one of our two
riding clubs, and Miss G. Kemp, who is
the mainstay of another, will also take part
in several events. Blacksmiths and saddlers and
produce merchants are blessing the whim
that made riding fashionable again, and hoping
that it will last.
Mrs. Alexander Aiken and Mrs. Clive
Paine, another Queenslander, were presented
together at H.M.’s June Court. The new
regulations forbid parking outside the Palace,
so from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. a stream of cars
solemnly circled round and round it until the
courtyard gates were opened.
Aileen Bell, of Coochin, is just back from a
trip abroad. A splendid horsewoman, like her
sisters, she did a good deal of hunting in
England. A long motor tour in Europe filled
in several weeks, and she had as a travelling
companion Mrs. N. A. H. Campbell, the pretty
and popular young Englishwoman whose hus-
band was aide to Sir John Goodwin while he
was our Governor. Poland, Spain and other
out-of-the-way places were visited. Miss Bell
brought her car back to Australia with her.
The Bell clan gathered in force to welcome
the traveller home, and spent a few days in
Brisbane before returning to Coochin.
Edna Morton, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Morton, of Clifton, has entered the
Order of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan
at Pennant Hills. She is not only a B.A. of
Queensland University, but a brilliant musician
and a licentiate of Trinity College. At various
eisteddfods she gathered in gold medals for
elocution.
There was a cheery little party when the
three Grant boys, Bill, Eric and lan, and their
fiancees, Beverley Wymond, Joan Bond
and Val Brady, dined, danced and supped
together. The Grant family has a very high
standard of female beauty—Mary, now Mrs.
Bob Sword, was the loveliest girl of the year
when the Prince visited us —and the three little
brides-to-be could take their places in the
family picture gallery with the full approval of
the most critical family ancestor.
Six past-students of the Melbourne National
Gallery Art School are holding an exhibition.
M. S. Herring opened it. Gwen Grant, Enid
Dickson, Caroline Barker and Yvonne and
Melville Haysom are the other exhibitors.
There have been plenty of visitors, but so
many other art shows have happened recently
that the little red seals aren’t so numerous
as they might be.

The best-dressed dance of the week
was City Tatts.’ effort for hospitals.
This filled David Jones’s ballroom with
the rustle of moire and taffeta and the
swish of velvet. It lured Lady Isaacs,
who came in beige laces. Commander
G. D. Moore was in attendance, and
Mrs. Moore wrapped a Spanish shawl of
brilliant coloring around her black
satins. Glittering sequins outlined the
neck of Mrs. Owen Maidment’s black
cotelle frock, and daughter Olwen
pinned a spray of pink camellias on the
corsage of her Patou-blue crepes. Olive
Reynolds’s green crepes flashed a golden
girdle. Margaret Herridge’s long black
taffeta coat had puff sleeves. Mona
Ryan wore lupin-blue crepes, and Mavis
Carmody a wreath of flowers on her hair
and a Medici collar on her long lime-
green coat. There were 16 fledglings
trying their social wings. Mrs. E.Pope led
them forward to the vice-regal greeting,
she herself trailing midnight-blue laces.
The night before their federation went
into conference, the Parents and Citizens
had a dance at the Wentworth. The
federation’s blue and gold was the domin-
ant note in the decorations. It appeared
in the huge bunches of balloons that
hung from the ceiling and in the ribbons
that ran up and down the official table.
Each of the 22 districts represented stuck
to its own colors, which with the amusing
jazz caps and favors on heads and tables
made for jollity. The band with reason
played “Advance, Australia Fair,” as 35
white-clad youngsters walked down the
gallery stairs and across the room to where
Lady Isaacs was ready with a smile to
launch them on the social sea. Her dress
of amethystine velvets had drapings from
the shoulders for sleeves and diamonds
at shoulder and waistline for sparkle.
Commander G. D. Moore was in atten-
dance, and his wife was in dusty-pink
satin, with a glittering halo in her hair.
Mrs. J. Stewart swished black chiffon
below the waist, and shone in silver lame
above. W. M. Hughes brought Dame
Mary wrapped around in the tranquillity
of oyster-grey flat crepe. The federation’s
hon. sec., J. S. Gerrand, brought two nice
dancing daughters. Mrs. C. E. Farthing,
wife of the president, wore spring-leaf-
green crepes, and Mrs. Ross Thomas
snuggled down into her fur coat. Minis-
ter for Education Drummond came on
after unveiling the photograph of Prof.
Le Gay Brereton at the Fellowship of
Australian Writers’ meeting.
King’s Old Boys and their best girls
filled the Blaxland Galleries to over-
flowing for their ball. It was a great
affair. A model of the school in mauve
stocks was one of the night’s attrac-
tions ; another was the fencing dis-
play by members of the Swords
Club. Tall standards of poppies and
marigolds tied with white and blue
streamers and festoons of the golden
blooms hanging on the walls made a
bright background for the night’s fun.
There were many flowers on the official
table, and aloft a 2ft. replica of the
school crest stood proudly. Here sat
the school’s head, C. T. Parkinson, his
wife in black velvet slashed with gold
at the shoulders, and a big company of
representatives of other public schools ;
B. R. Riley, president of the 0.8. U., and
Marion Riley were there. The Brough-
ton O’Connors (he’s sec. of the union)
were the centre of a group which in-
cluded Rita Roseby and Kathleen Telfer.
Barbara McGann in flounced floral taf-
fetas, Ethel Matthews in white chiffons all
a-glitter with silver beads, Judy Burleigh
in nutmeg matelasse, Patricia Littlejohn
in black laces, and Ann Gordon, whose
briar-rose pink velvet coat covered
Patou-blue crepes, were a few of the
young things whose feet seemed to have
discovered the secret of perpetual
motion.
Knox Grammar Old Boys held their
shivoo at Hordern Bros. Scotch thistles
decked the official table, and the school
banner with its thistle emblem draped
one side of the wall. Principal M. H.
Mac Neil and his wife entertained the
John Fell, the John Adamson and the
lan Clunies Ross couples. C. S. Peebles
(hon. sec. of the dance) and Joyce
Peebles saw to it that the representatives
of Barker, St. Aloysius, Trinity and
Cranbrook had their share of the night’s
enjoyment.
Sydney folk who went to the races at
Grafton are still talking of that pretty
town, with its tree-shaded streets and
jacarandas, now in full bloom. There
were hundreds on the course to cheer
Mr. Kerry as he romped home, and to
cheer again when Mrs. E. A. Woodward
(wife of the chairman of the C.R.J.C.)
slipped the winner’s ribbon around his
neck. At the R. H. Macdonalds’
after-the-races cocktail party the talk
was about the horses and their riders,
as it was at supper-time at the pre-race
bridge and poker parties of the George
Morrisons and the P. N. Webbers. The
golf club took the opportunity to cele-
brate the opening of its new clubhouse
with a cabaret ball which enhanced
the sparkle of the week’s festivities.
The girl with the steadfast eyes who
looks at you from this pencil drawing is
Audrey, only daughter of the T. Nicol-
sons, of Chamberlain-avenue, Rose Bay.
She recently announced her engagement
to John Michael (Mick), elder son of
Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. M. F. Bruxner, of
O’Sullivan-road, Rose Bay. Mick’s
father may become Premier if Mr.
Stevens enters Commonwealth politics.
The week has been an intoxicating one
of private dress shows. These foreshadow
that in the spring there will be spots and
bars (Mexican, Roman and lolly) for
the sophisticated, flower-printed chiffons,
silks and cottons for the nature-lovers,
and checks for even the poorest of us.
More so than ever is there a rhythmic
movement in clothes. There’s a blown-
in-the-wind look about the materials, and
when this is allied to fulness of skirt
'and fussiness of jabot in front the effect
is one of being windswept forward.
Occasionally, there’s a sprouting of wings
on peplum or shoulder. This gives the
backward flyaway look that comes
mostly in evening dresses from petal-like
ruchings of taffeta, spiral or cascading
frills that creep or tumble into a train.
Every dress must have its coat —waist,
fingertip, three-quarter or full length.
Navy is smart; so is black. Sapphire
blues and dusty pinks will also make
themselves seen. Obtrusive buttons occur
at odd places. Cotton fabrics are un-
crushable, so that “just out of the band-
box” look is carried all day. Taffeta for
daytime and evening is popular. An
afternoon frock had wide-spreading cuffs
and a jabot of white-and-black plaid. An
evening coat had dolman sleeves.
The lucky buyer will clutch the wrap
around her. It will blouse at her waist,
and billow and stand out ’ about her
shoulders like a full-blown water-lily—a
beautiful setting for a red or a golden
head. A thing of beauty was a burnt-
chestnut romaine and lace evening dress
with godets that opened fanlike to give
fulness at the front. It streamlined into
a train at the back, and its softly-cowled
neckline had a scarf; its little coatee, a
demure monk’s hood. Cowl necklines are
still worn, but square ones are newer..
These are often drawn down to the side
at the front, in diamond or pearl clips.
A black moss crepe afternoon dress had
the new peplum, at the back only, a
wide leather belt and deep collar and
cuffs of bird’s-egg-blue eyeleted linen. A
costume in the new dusty pink had its
cuffs detachable from the elbow. A belt
of brown suede and its circular jabot of
white linen were fastened with brown log
clips banded in gold, and there were tucks
above the hem of its three-quarter coat.
A brown tulle evening dress that would
gladden the heart of any young thing
had its bodice ruched and its frills running
around its circular cape, north and south
of its flounce and
up the front of the
skirt, the whole
finishing in a big
bow at the back.
Your organza or
chiffon day dress,
smart lady, will
be lOin. off the
ground, your linen
12in. From sto 7,
the cocktail hour,
your gown will be
ankle high, and in
the evening it will
flow into a train.
The engagement
of Janet Knox and
Julian Simpson is
viewed with in-
tense approval in
the only exclusive
social circle that
poor old Sydney
has left. Janet is
one of the charm-
ing and brainy
daughters of the
E. W. Knoxes, of
Roma, Bellevue
Hill. Her interests
are literary and
artistic, and she and
her sister Barbara
used to come along
to the luncheons
of the Cavalier
Club with Mrs.
Pitt-Rivers and
George Lambert some years ago ; but
dignified isolation has always been the
family’s line. She shuns the limelight of
the gossip-hounds as assiduously as
those who are battling to get into one of
our innumerable social worlds chase
after it.
The young man in the case has political
aspirations. He put up a strenuous fight
for East Sydney as a Nationalist candi-
date in Mr. Bruce’s time, but failed to
bring it off. His father was the old-time
Equity Judge who was almost as cele-
brated for the beauty of his clothes and
general appearance as he was for his pro-
fessional attainments. On this side of his
family Mr. Simpson is related to Telford
Simpson and the London novelist who
wrote “Boomerang.” His mother, Mrs.
Ashburton Thompson, spends most of
her time in London, but makes periodical
visits to this part of the world. He is
a member of Premier Stevens’s personal
staff at the Treasury (he was previously
on the staffs of Prime Minister Bruce and
Premier Bavin), and, as befits one with
political intentions, he belongs to the
Australian Club.
What a lovable man Prof. Le Gay
Brereton must have been! The Fellow-
ship of Australian Writers has a photo-
graph of him for its rooms. Educa-
tion Minister Drummond unveiled it last
week. Dora Wilcox (Mrs. William
Moore) read some of Brereton’s verse and
prose to an assembly-room filled with
members. Mary Gilmore and Rod
Quinn would have swelled the numbers
if ’flu hadn’t had them in its grasp.
President Dr. George Mackaness was
in the chair. Hugh McCrae came down
from Camden; Steele Rudd, Julian
Ashton, Will Jago, Will Lawson, John
Lane Mullins and Dave Souter all offered
their meed of praise for “Jack,” the
scholar, the poet, the prose-writer, the
good companion, the Fellowship’s first
president.
When all these words had been spoken
the -company stood in silence while Dr.
Mackaness held aloft Pixie O’Harris’s
fine pencil drawing of the professor’s
head for all the company to see.
“Young Jim” Onslow, who startled
Sydney by announcing that he had been
deported from Norfolk Island, mar-
ried Pixie Herbert, a tall atid beauti-
ful J.C.W. showgirl, and that has been
described as the wisest thing he ever did.
She is enormously liked and respected
by all who know her. Her husband is
descended from the father of our wool
industry on both sides. His grandfather
was a naval man who married a daugh-
ter of James Macarthur, of Camden
Park, nearly 70 years ago; and his
mother is a daughter of the late Arthur
Macarthur, of Sydney.
There were congratulatory speeches,
set around with fragrant flowers, and a
tea-drinking waiting for Mrs. Hubert
Fairfax at the Carlton drawing-room
when members of the Harborside branch
of the C.W.A. gathered to honor her
appointment as a vice-president of the
World Association of Country Women.
The Metropolitan Group also had its say.
Just before the golden notes of Athos
Martelli’s ’cello filled the room a
beautifully-bound autograph-book was
handed over bearing the assoc.’s motto:
“Honor to God, Loyalty to the Throne,
Service to the Country, Through Coun-
try Women, For Country Women, By
Country Women.” Then the voices of
Walter Kingsley and Madame Goosens-
Viceroy delighted the gathering.
The Agricultural Department is
pleased, and chief organiser C. C. Crane
and Lorna Byrne, director of the
women’s section, are smiling broadly, for
the 12th yearly conference of the Agri-
cultural Bureau, just ended, has proved
again that its existence is justified. Three
hundred delegates came to this year’s
three-day talkie, many of them women,
and the sex is showing every indication
of becoming more and more interested
in the scientific running of a farm as a
whole, rather than in such sidelines as
bee-keeping and flower-growing. Mostly
the lectures deal with phases of farm
life, but such subjects as mental hygiene,
flower decoration and games for social
gatherings proved very popular.
Hawkesbury College houses the pow-
wow, which is held during the winter
vacation. It always starts off with a
lunch. At this, noticeable among the
delegates, were the Vice-Consul for
China’s wife, Mrs. Wong, in her pic-
turesque national dress, and Mrs. Host,
wife of Denmark’s Consul-General.
There’s a certain amount of social life
to leaven the lectures. At .the cottage
there’s a constant pouring of tea and
cutting of cake hostessed by the presi-
dent’s wife (this year it was Mrs. W. W.
Watson). In the evenings roaring fires
make the college a very comfortable
place, and community singing helps the
time to pass. But the social event is the
dance. And on the last day the delegates
are the guests of the principal.

St. Kilda Town Hall was lavishly deco-
rated with blue and gold for the P.L.C.
Old Collegians’ dance. Twinkling lights
ran right up to the roof, green palm
fronds wrapped themselves round the
pillars and cleverly arranged draperies
made a frieze under the balconies. Doris
Moore introduced 14 fledglings to the
president, Mrs. F. W. Kitchen, who
clasped Christmas roses against her
golden-brown velvets. The all-white debs,
entered via the stage, each with one hand
touching the arm of her escort and the
other occupied with a splash of pink
camellias. Carmen Rainford‘s befrilled
taffetas brought up the rear. Enid Har-
well risked the delicacy of a tulle train,
and Phyllis Uhlig was the only deb. to
choose lace. Margaret and Muriel Ross,
Glen Crockett and Jessie Peter were four
debs, from country homes who were
boarders during the same years.
Burneice Swaine, in an inky mist of
black fluted net over gold brocade ; Elma
Watson, in a slimly-fitting gold lamd
dress and violets to match her velvet
cape; Coralie Gardiner and Bonnie
Kellett, wearing the flower wristlet of
committee-women, directed the traffic to
cabaret tables round the ballroom. At
the official board were the principal and
Mrs. W. Gray, Miss F. Fraser, in a dove-
grey velvet cape, and Mrs. I. H. Moss,
who never misses parties at her old
school.
Mrs. R. Lamble sported an intricately-
strapped corsage upon her flame moire,
while her sister, Charity Friend, whisked
a frill round the ankles of her loquat
ninon. Long-sleeved dresses were chosen
by Lottie Clarke and Alma Silvester.
Jean Robertson’s Parma-violet frills
blew backwards upon lime-green stiffen-
ings. Mrs. Douglas Tail’s ice-blue
“wings” were silver-lined, and Shirley
South by wore sapphire shoes with her
dusty-pink dress.
Lady Huntingfield opened the Empire
Knitting Competition in the lower Town
Hall, where a dense crowd, a low ceiling
and an Indian summer day made an
atmosphere which could have been cut
with a knife. Exhibits numbered 2000,
parcels having arrived from as far afield
as Canada, Scotland and Malta. A New-
foundland package was delivered too late
for judging. The Women’s Centenary
Council had to dip into its pocket for
£B-odd to get it through the Customs,
for the contents are for sale. These
articles, mostly children’s wear, are
knitted by the wives and daughters of
fishermen, who maintain a policewoman
entirely through the- proceeds pf such
handiwork.
The smartest thing in the Melbourne
show was a jumper knitted diagonally in
the tartan of Cameron of Lochiel, which
was exhibited by Mrs. Leslie Love, of
Hamilton (Vic.). Any girl would get a
thrill from wearing Mrs. V. Heming-
way’s tomato woollen blouse with a white
motif in place of a vestee. Nina Mogg,
of Mudgee, specialised in neat seams,
her green prize-winning jumper being
made from narrow strips joined to make
a flawless diagonal pattern. In the Most
Original section there were patchwork
cot-covers (the patience of these knit-
ters!), a nursery-rhyme picture being
worked into each square. Prizes totalled
£5OO, marks being awarded for tension,
general appearance, shape and finish.
Lady Huntingfield lingered among the
babies’ woollies —such lovely things for
some lucky infants! —and the Hon. Sara
Vanneck was attracted by the wool rugs.
There were no exhibits from England,
for Agent-General Linton is running his
own competition, with a return fare to
Australia as first prize. The Pioneer
Women’s Memorial fund reaps the pro-
ceeds from the Melbourne display—
-2748 people paid Is. for admission.
It takes a visit to the R.V.1.8. to make
folk who have their sight realise how
lucky they are. The combined auxiliaries
filled Ormond Hall, where the institute’s
symbol of a lighthouse twinkled on the
stage as a shelter for the birthday cake,
cut at tea-time by Lady Huntingfield.
Blind Girl Guides and Brownies made a
guard of honor for the Governor’s wife,
who was escorted up the room by the
president and Mrs. J. L. Carnegie, Mrs.
J. Frost and the S. W. Hedgers. Music
and dancing are a marvellous help to
the blind. Junior boys and girls smiled
all the way through their rose dance.
Ethel Hall and her twin sister were the
“green skirts” in the tamborine dance.
Ethel afterwards sang a duet with tenor
Fred Sutcliffe. George Findlay (Mus.
Bac. and blind) and Arthur McKay, aged
12, who was successful against 109
children who could see in the recent
Music Teachers’ Association competi-
tions, played piano solos. Much of the
credit of the orchestra is due to D. L.
Palmer (he is not quite blind), who has
to use his inventive faculties when tran-
scribing music into braille, for there are
many marks which have no braille equi-
valent. Lady Huntingfield engaged this
orchestra to play at a private dinner
party last month.
Commander and Mrs. Cresswell gave
a late-afternoon party at Wolverton,
Toorak, most of their guests being naval
men and their wives. The hostess per-
formed her duties in a dress of henna
matt crepe, the corsage softly draped into
a cowl neckline. Daughter Peggy wore
a springlike garment of figured georg-
ettes. In the throng were Vice-Admiral
Hyde and his lady, Rear-Admiral and
Mrs. McNeil, Commander and Mrs.
Loudon Shand, Commander and Mrs.
Leo Quick, the James Noalls, Mrs.
Lucius Manning and Judy and Denise
Finch.
The Alan Curries are to have the royal
visitor under their roof at Ercildoune,
which is cheering for them, as they spent
a good deal of time and money preparing
their fine station home for a visit from
the Duke and Duchess of York. Plans
were altered at the last moment, and the
visit was cancelled.
By a slip of the pen on this page last
week, Mrs. Russell Grimwade was num-
bered among the patrons of the races at
Flemington. The dress described was
worn by Mrs. Norton Grimwade —the
Russell Grimwades never go to the races.
Delysia, as a woman as well as an
actress, is the most-talked-of person in
Melbourne. Her popularity is assured
by her friendly manner, for she has an
air of taking into her confidence the
person with whom she is carrying on a
conversation. She is always vivacious, and
is just as charming to a taxi-driver as she
is to a high Government official. Off the
stage Delysia wears only the thinnest
layer of powder (sometimes in the day-
time none at all), her bluish eyebrows are
thinly pencilled so far down that they
touch her hair, she uses a profuse amount
of eyebrow shadow and tints her toe- and
finger-nails to match her carmine lips.
She does physical jerks every morning
and loves to dance to good music on a
perfect floor.
In “Mother of Pearl” the dialogue is so
scintillating that many gags are lost on
slow wits.' A respectable suburban couple
sitting in the middle of the stalls helped
one another right through the show by
explanations. In the last act, when the
worn-out and very untidy cricketer
shouts “Merci, merci,” John Citizen said
to his wife: “He’s asking her to let him
off ; she’s one of these vamp women, and
he’s scared to death of her.”
This Broothorn portrait is of Olive
Norman, one of the people who worked
hard to make a success of the Buffalo
Chalet Ball in aid of the Lord Mayor’s
Fund. She is an efficient inquiry agent
at the Government Tourist Bureau, and
occasionally acts as chaperon on organ-
ised tours of schoolchildren. Her last such
trip was to Buffalo with 170 boys and
girls from Queensland, who spent a thrill-
ing week on skis and skates. Miss Nor-
man was sports mistress for several years
at Fintona, and takes a keen interest in
baseball. (The Vic. women’s baseball
team was formed two years ago, its
members being old girls of secondary
schools.) She is also a clever amateur
actress, and has produced several plays
with marked success.
The impression left by the Buffalo
Chalet Ball at the Forty Club was very
like Miller’s drawing of the Ark house-
warming in last week s Bulletin
decorous to begin with, but uproarious
after midnight. Staid and elderly citizens
danced as rapturously as Miller’s tiger
with his coy lady ostrich ; portly gentle-
men like the elephant in the paper cap
tasted the elixir of youth ; youths and
maidens galloped round the room or just
drifted with their eyes closed whichever
way the solid mass of dancers pushed
them. One young woman had a laugh just
as hearty as the lively crocodile who is
getting a thrill out of the flipper hug of
her walrus escort. In the middle of the
room a snowman blinked his eye at the
1600 dancers, and a model in relief of
the Buffalo plateau showed what dizzy
precipices yawn in the locality.
Lady Huntingfield, wearing a black lace
gown, and the Hon. Sara Vanneck, whose
snuff-brown velvet was protected by an
Empire-green cloak strengthened about
the shoulders with epaulettes, came early,
and stayed for supper in a specially-
decorated niche. Railway Commissioners
in Melbourne for a conference arrived
in a body. J. W. Davidson was there, and
the T. J. Hartigans, she in a blue velvet
cape, brought Gwen in rose-beige geor-
gettes. Mrs. H. J. Hodgens was vivid
in electric-blue. Mrs. Raymond White
wore a halo plait and a gown of primula-
pink velvet. Gold lines flowed up and
down among the black taffetas worn by
Mrs. E. C. Eyres, and Olive Norman’s
dress was foamy white, sprigged with pink
flowers.
In 15 years Melbourne has not
changed so very much to Mrs. Laurence
Meynell, pictured here by Broothorn.
As youthful Shirley Darbyshire, she went
off to England to school carrying im-
pressions of large houses, spacious
gardens and tall buildings (our child-
hood memories always exaggerate size!).
Mrs. Meynell took a Diploma of Jour-
nalism in London, for at a very tender
age she decided to become a writer.
Under her maiden name she has pub-
lished one novel, “Something Human,”
and many short articles in English
papers. She is working on her second
novel and intends her third to be a
pioneering tale of Australia. This is her
author-playwright husband’s first visit to
this country. The couple’s home is a
quaint eighteenth-century house in Lon-
don. Though it’s not far from the heart
of the city, there’s a garden of plum-
and cherry-trees and rambler roses.
Their three months’ visit here is to
gather authors’ material, but Mrs. Mey-
nell has schoolgirl friendships to renew
and is being entertained by so many
friends of her mother (the musical Mrs.
Taylor Darbyshire) that neither she nor
her husband has settled down to serious
work.
Mrs. W. A. Kernick (her late husband
was the Rev. Kernick, of Queen’s Col-
lege) sailed off in the Orsova with her
daughters. While the children are at
school in England their mother will live
in the Channel Islands. Mrs. N. Charl-
ton’s holiday is over. She embarked for
Madras in the same steamer. Molly
Druce and her cargo of presents and
trousseau were bound for Colombo,
where John Wilson waits with the wed-
ding ring.
Mrs. Charles Wallace and only daugh-
ter Mary boarded the Orsova bound for
foreign parts. Ahead of Mary is a year
at a finishing school in Switzerland ; her
mother’s plans hinge upon the dates of
musical festivals in Munich and Vienna.
For her farewell tea-party at the Alexan-
dra Club, Mrs. Wallace wore a blue
tailored dress and a small black velvet
hat, with a trifle of eye-veil. Mary’s
suit and hat were of flecked blue and
grey tweed. Mrs. Frank Andrew had
skunk furs upon her black coat and Mrs.
Angus Urquhart, of Kernong, Neerim-,
was also in all black. Bfue was chosen
by Mrs. M. Armstrong, of Camper-
down, and by Mrs. Alan Calvert, who
had silver foxes dangling over her
shoulder. Among other guests were Mrs.
Massey Burnside, Mrs. Chester Mani-
fold, Mrs. Cedric Battle, Trixie Hay,
Adela Wertheim and Nesta McKellar.
A highly qualified woman, Jocelyn
Hyslop, has been appointed Director
of Training for the Board of Social
Studies. The board has been piloted
through the 15 months of its existence
without a director, the Charity Organisa-
tion’s secretary, Grieg Smith, and Mel-
bourne Hospital almoner Helen Rees hav-
ing supervised the work of 16 trainees.
Miss Hyslop has a science degree, a social-
science certificate and a special certificate
of training in mental health. While on
a world cruise last year she spent a few
days in Melbourne. Her present job is
that of organising psychiatrist for the
Babies’ Association in Leeds. Financial
help which has created the new Mel-
bourne position was given by A. W.
Coles, A. Nicholas, S. Hicketson, F. Lay-
cock and the Herbert Brookes couple.
Following on the “Pashometer” and
the “It-Meter” is a weighing machine
which, when a penny is pushed into its
interior, speaks your weight. It has an
unpleasant habit of shouting its loudest
when a crowd of people are round it;
but “13” and “14” sound so alike in its
vocalism that you can, if prepared, jump
off the thing with a beaming smile, say-
ing “Only 13 stone!” when you know it
said 14, or vice versa, if you’re a man
and like to be thought hefty.
A good excuse for parties is given on
these nights when the Test matches
are broadcast till 4 a.m. to a
synthetic accompaniment of clapping
and crack of bat on ball. In between
messages are scraps of comedy or dance
music, according to the station you tune
in to —all a help to a hostess, for with
so much entertainment on ,tap it’s the
guests’ fault if they don’t enjoy them-
selves. Many old ladies accustomed to
turn in at 8 o’clock every night can last
out round the radio as enthusiastically as
their grandchildren.
The inventors of Dacomb shorthand
are fast workers. But for a few finishing
details, they completed their system in
an evening. It can be learned in a few
hours and a speed of 300 words per
minute can be attained. The inventors
are Melbourne women, and have been
for many years professional shorthand
writers. Miss C. T. Dacomb is a Fellow
of the Pitman Society and ran her own
business college, where at one time she
taught as an experiment three different
methods of shorthand in one room.
Travelling as luxuriously as a talkie
star, Anna of Ashcroft arrived in Mel-
bourne. The blue-blooded lady shared
the cabin of chief-officer T. T. Oliver on
board the Karamea, and travelled with a
copy of her family tree, a suitcase of
medicines, skin powders, brushes and
combs, light- and heavy-weight jumpers,
several sets of blankets for her wicker
bed and an insurance policy for many
hundreds of pounds. Anna is a snob ;
she couldn’t manage more than a sniff
and a disdainful glance from her half-
closed, bulgy eyes for all the people who
came to meet her. After 60 days in
quarantine she will go to live at the
MacLarens’ kennels, where Rufu Tu, an-
other Pekingese importation, puts on the
airs and graces of a champion.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
WESTRALIA.
A thousand passengers booked berths
for the Advertising Arts Ball at the
Embassy. Lifeboats flanked the gal-
leries ; a nautical band played and
swayed on the poop deck; sailorettes
danced an eccentric hornpipe ; luggage
was brought aboard with a neat terpsi-
chorean turn ; the vessel plunged from
calm waters into a gale of lightning,
thunder, wind and rain, and the “Ad-
rift” publication gave under- and over-
seas news. Organiser Solomon’s diminu-
tive wife stood near the helm in sea-wave
lace, with a crest of silver lame ; Kitty
Sache’s gold effulgence topped the deep
green of turbulent waters ; Mrs. Frank
Whitford paced the decks in fair-weather
chiffons; Mrs. W. James frothed in a
wake of snowy satins; and Muriel
O’Brien’s laces provided a touch of sky-
blue.
W. A. J. Corbett pegged a claim at
Kalgoorlie in partnership with Beryl,
lone daughter of the E. C. Rosmans, of
the Lake View. Goldfielders picked their
way to St. John’s Cathedral, where Beryl’s
French pearl flowers surmounted a shaft
of tulle, which covered the depth of her
clinging alluvial barre to the end of the
fur-edged, four-reefed train. Margaret
Stewart and Marion Jukes attended in
gleaming blast-swept satins, with fissures
of auriferous soil where hung their trails
of autumn foliage. Baby Jack Hocking
was a page, and Mrs. Rosman’s “color”-
streaked earthy laces inspired confidence
in the company at the Palace Hotel after-
math.
Coffers of the Clontarf Orphanage
bulged after the ball at the Y.A.L.
Father Kelly represented the Coadjutor
Archbishop, and was welcomed by organ-
isers Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Hannan.
Tables in the gymnasium held a donated
supper and a profusion of English mari-
golds, poinsettias and Geraldton wax.
Mrs. Walter Dwyer’s severely-cut black
velvets were admired; Mrs. Dan Mul-
cahy’s scarlet pebble crepe caught the
eye ; Molly Lalor swung a length of floral
georgette ; Mercia de Mamiel was an ice-
floe in satin.
Mrs. F. Bromilow, Mrs. B. M. Risch-
' bieth and Mrs. A. E. Joyner, three ex-
presidents of the Women’s Service Guild,
hostessed the annual social rally at Guild
headquarters. The Mitchell lady, set
abo , ut w u ith cl ° th ’ P i em J er Co 1:
her s other half Mrs. E B. Sinclair and
Parliamentarian May Holman had front
stalls during the items given by Mrs.
Menkens, Mrs. Howard Birt, Thelma
Berry and Joan Adams. Mrs. Orgill
arran gcd the doings, and Mrs. Wells held
swa Y during the tea interlude,
The Shakspeare Club cut a birthday
cake at the Town Hall. John le Tessier
presided, with wife Anita Fitzgerald at
his right hand, and secretary Kitty
Gillies to the left. During the evening
Anita changed her purple satin with its
black lace covering for Romeo’s sombre
raiment, to take part in the balcony
scene with Sylvia George’s Juliet. Joyce
Mortlock produced A. P. Herbert’s
“Two Gentlemen of Soho”; Elsie Mc-
Callum, Lucy Howell and Molly Malone
gave items; and Fred Barlee and Mable
Balding appeared in duologue.
Uni. women went frivolous at their

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Embassy was the setting for the
jj unt club Ball, an affair of 200 couples.
dance was given a good kick-off
by dinners at the Oriental, the South
Australian and the Ambassadors. Supper-
tabje decorations were scarlet, of course
—geranium and salvia. The younger
mem bers of the club had been busy for
wee k s on making special little sets of
h un tsmen, horses and hounds, designed
by Nora Young, daughter of the club’s
president, and painted by the girls of
the committee. On each of the six tables
was a hunting scene in miniature. Two
sets of lancers were danced, the girls look-
ing charming in white satin frocks, scariet
coats with pale blue facings, lace jabots
and large black velvet hats with ostrich
plumes. Their partners sported red coats
with blue lapels. Lud Mayor Cain and
his daughter, Mrs. H. Dunstan, were
there, the acting-Mayoress choosing
scarlet chiffon.
The same night the Uni. Dance Club
held its ball and decided to defy luck.
The guests were compelled to enter the
refectory beneath a ladder, and the deco-
rations featured broken mirrors, pictures
of cross-eyed Chinamen and black cats.
Supper was served in the Lady Symon
Hall. Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters re-
ceived the guests, Mrs. Matters wearing
Madonna-blue triple georgette cut on
princess lines, with silver lame on the
bodice.
A bridge party on a large scale
arranged by Mrs. Harold Bickford, in
aid of the R. 1.8., and held at Alving-
ton, Somerton, brought in £l7l, the ex-
penses being only 275.
The garden at Mrs. H. C. Downer’s
home at Walkerville looked like fairy-
land with thousands of multicolored
lights festooned about the large garden
when Mrs. Downer, in conjunction with
Mrs. Seymour Hawker and Gordon
McFarlane, gave a ball. Dancing was in
a marquee erected upon the tennis court,
and supper was served in the billiard-
room, the table arranged with pale pink
sweet-peas, pink candles in silver can-
delabra and pink shades, all to tone. Mrs.
Downer was in black satin, smartly cut,
with train and an orchid shoulder spray.
Mrs. Hawker chose petunia chiffon with
long train and cross-over bodice. Suzanne
Hawker and Phillippa McFarlane wore
their debutante frocks.
Sylvia Welling, here to play “The Du-
barry,” was given a civic reception, and
for once in a way every alderman and
councillor turned up. Miss Welling looked
charming in black chiffon velvet with a
black halo hat, a handsome black silver-
fox fur, and a spray of white camellias
on her shoulder. Mrs. Dunstan wore
black marocain with a knife-pleated cape,
the tie ends lined with scarlet, and her
hat was a small Breton straw in black.
Almond-blossom and pale pink sweet-
peas decorated.
Two Adelaide girls were presented at
the last drawing-room at Buckingham
Palace, Mrs. J. R. Clarke (Alison Milne,
of Somerton, that was) and Mary Cave,
only chick of the C. H. Caves.
Athalie Cuming gave a cocktail party
at her home, Gilberton, as a good-bye to
Margaret Jolly, who left for England in
the Chitral. Miss Jolly was entertained
at a number of parties prior to her de-
parture.
Tonv Wynyard’s farewell party for
Margaret was on the “follow-on” plan,
each course being served in a different
room.
TASMANIA.
Lady Clark entertained Girl Guides
and Scouts at Government House the
other afternoon. Commissioners Mrs.
W. Hudspeth, Mrs. W. Thirkell and Lilias
Lyne took out the young guests, who
were received by his Ex. and Lady Clark,
shown all over the house and fed in the
ballroom.
The committee of the Launceston
B.D.D.T. gave a party for the various
“Queens” who for the last few weeks
have been raising the wind for the insti-
tute by entertainments of all sorts. The
jollo took place at the Virginia, where
those inclined for dancing had the run
of the big tea-room downstairs. Bridge
tables were set out upstairs. A presen-
tation was made to Miss Lindus, secre-
tary of the Queen Campaign.
Joyce Margaret Leach and Roy John
Gibson were linked at the Cathedral,
which had been decked with berries,
bulb flowers and green by the bride’s
girl friends. The bride wore over her
dead-white satin a tulle veil that had
served two generations. It fell from a
halo of silver and was caught at the back
with a spray of orange-blossom. Family
treasures in the shape of a diamond
brooch and diamond earrings were worn.
Nancy Gee and Ninie Gibson ’maided
in jade-green velvet. Their long scarves
were finished with fur on the ends, and
their little halo caps were of green and
gold brocade.
The Hobart Repertory Soc. took its
most recent production, Lonsdale’s “High
Road,” to Launceston, in aid of northern
charities. The Launceston Players did
the same sort of thing for Hobart
recently. The Hobartians had a good
reception.
Midland folk regret the passing over
of Mrs. Herbert Dowling (Connie Cox
that was), of Harland Rise, Evandale.
Both her own and her husband’s people
are well known in Tas. pastoral circles.

BRIDGE
WITHOUT
SIGHS.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONS. -
Another bridge championship has been
added to the collection of Messrs. J.
Griffiths and C. Cadwallader, of Sydney.
They won this contest, under the Howell
match-point scoring system, more easily
than any preceding it. In the home of
this system, America, an average of 60
p.c. to 62 p.c. over 100 hands or more
is looked on as good enough to win a
championship event. In quite the best
field which has contested a bridge tourna-
ment in Sydney, the winners averaged
63 p.c. over the first 60 hands. Re-
laxing a little in the last session, know-
ing that they held a good lead, they
finished with a fraction under 60 p.c.
Apart from their admitted ability at
contract, there are some outstanding fea-
tures of their game. They retain mutual
confidence despite occasional crashes.
They exhibit some shrewd psychology
in picking the pairs against whom to put
in their bluff bids. And they remember
that in Howell contests it pays to refrain
from overbidding, unless deliberately for
a sacrifice.
The runners-up, Dr. Buckle and Mr.
C. O. Thompson, returned the capital
average of 54 p.c. In third place were
Mr. L. Donaldson and Dr. Harris, a
strong partnership that should win a big
event shortly. It was a most enjoyable
contest for us all, and our thanks are
due to David Jones and the Sydney
Bridge Club for staging it, particularly
the final session in the beautiful Audi-
torium.
Among the most interesting deals on
the last night was a small slam which
was only bid at one table, most likely
by a pair who felt that they had to chase
a lot of points. With neither side vulner-
able, North dealt and held the follow-
ing:—
4 —K, Q, 10, x
V-A, K, Q
♦ —Q, x, x, x
Jf» —A, x
Playing the Culbertson system, he opens
with one spade. South responds with
three n.t., and leaves North to do some
thinking. There would seem to be a
’ slam about, but in what? If South has
both the missing aces, it may be as
good in n.t. as anything. If there is an
ace against them, it would appear better
to play it in six of South’s best suit.
Hence North, as a feeler, bid four n.t.
South promptly denied both aces, and,
knowing that North wanted to hear what
his three no-trump response was founded
on, said five diamonds. The bidding
finished at six diamonds, which were
obtained. South held:
♦ —X, X
V—J, X, X, X
♦—A, K, J, 10
*-K, x, x
The small slam was playable in no-
trumps, but at more risks, as the spade
ten would have to be finessed. All the
same, it is questionable whether it pays
Jo go after slams in a big match game.
The obvious slams make themselves
apparent in the course of the bidding ;
us for the doubtful ones, if a pair stop
? at game they still receive a good score,
because the slam bid will only be made
hy a minority.
1 A recent statement of mine regarding
;a dislike of the opening one no-trump
has occasioned a deal of comment. One
of my friends suggests that this aversion
is unreasonable when I would open on
a 3 to 7>\ honor-trick hand with one club,
holding 10, x, x, x or J, x, x, x in that
jsuit. Well, two or three of us have tried
this bid during these last six months,
and our opinion is that it pays. We
ffiave found it easier to get into the cor-
rect suit declaration, and also, should
• the final contract be n.t., have often
a more favorable opening lead
by bidding the weak minor. This alleged
advantage may give the bid a sort of
• psychic” flavor, but unless your weak
/Suit is massed in the hand of the opener,
with a certain entry, it is unlikely to be
even when he begins to suspect you.
Of course, it looks like the Culbertson
approach principle carried to an extreme,
a *} d wdl g et no quarter from the disciples
-ot Mr. P. Hal Sims, but one hand which
1 witnessed recently furnished some
argument against the Sims or any otner
opening of one no-trump.
The dealer held six honor tricks, with
a biddable five-card suit. He com-
menced with one n.t., received a re-
sponse of two diamonds, and literally
dived into three n.t. He got them all
right. As a matter of fact, he got six
n.t., and could also have made either
six clubs or six diamonds. What 1 would
point out is that in making the opening
n.t. bid on powerful holdings, the value
of revealing distribution to partner is
forgotten. It is all very well for him to
know that you possess four quick tricks
or primary tricks, but where are they?
It may be argued that he doesn't need
to know, that he can confidently bid any
weak five-card suit, as the n.t. bidder
must have support for it. But does that
get you any further ahead? Does the
powerful opener then raise the weak re-
sponse to three or four, or does he pass
it? If he goes on with his n.t., does his
partner do anything but feel ill?
Whereas, if means are taken to inform
your partner as to where your top cards
lie, and also that you hold four or five
of that suit, a safer scaffolding is erected
for your prospective game-building.
W.G. (Rose Bay) has written me
something of interest on forcing with
short suits, a very valuable device and
sometimes the only method of arriving
at a slam declaration. But you have to
keep in mind that the short forcing suit
is preferably lower-ranking than the suit
bid by your partner. This ensures you
having control in case he should show a
disposition to bid high in your short suit.
Secondly, you must have more than
normal support in his suit, which also
allows you to control the situation.
On a holding such as:
Q, 9,8, x, x
V —K, x, x
♦— A. K, x
*-Q, x
if your partner bids one spade, the game
is in sight. You would like to know if
he has any additional values at all. A
secondary bid in clubs from him would
make a slam promising. Therefore,
force him with three diamonds. Should
he answer three n.t., the bidding finishes
at four spades. If the response is three,
hearts, you may bid three spades, in
case there is a chance of his supporting
diamonds on the next round. Once he
is able to make those three bids, one
spade, three hearts, four diamonds, you
can see quite a possibility of his having
a singleton club, which makes the slam
well in the running. On the other hand,
if he bids four clubs in answer to your
diamond force, the slam is almost a cer-
tainty. Your only loser should be the
heart ace or a trump finesse. Whichever
way you consider it, this type of bidding
is much more intelligent than the “slam
invitation” five spades, recommended by
sponsors of the direct method. Even if
the original spade opener has quite a
solid hand, any.slam try he may make is
a shot in the dark. He can’t possibly
place his loser or losers, and, if things
have not been going well, he may decline
the invitation, thereby throwing away a
certain 500 points.
That the tournament in Melbourne
Town Hall went off without a hitch was
a creditable reflection upon the organisers
of the Bridge Association, for there were
400 competitors. Entrants were divided
into five groups, according to their stan-
dard as A and B pennant players, team
members, odd pairs and players at non-
official tables. The 400 were remarkably
quiet, frivolous people being awed into
silence by watching such a weight of
brains in action. The association pro-
vided 32 trophies, comprising cups, pewter
mugs, sandwich dishes, little sweet dishes
and other useful bits of plate.

“The Doughman”
by
Robert Desmond Tate
“JONAH”
by Louis Stone
PAGEANT is aptly named.
It describes the spectacle of
life in the days of Queen
Victoria, in the stage-setting
of Colonial Tasmania. The
characters have all the
glamour of actors in a bril-
liant masquerade. The pages
are packed with dramatic
incidents, told in a masterly
style. Here is History in
the making, told as a
dramatic story of individuals.
A book to read and keep,
to discuss and recommend.
PRICE 6/6. Postage 4d.
It is more than an author’s
brilliant first novel; it is
the first of its kind among
our novelists. It trans-
lates. in terms of the
sharpest realism, an aspect
of life in the raw —in the
sweat and steam, the stealth
and sinister dealings that
may form the atmosphere of
industrial workers. It shows
the insidious effect sueh
atmosphere may have on
those who breathe it—men
and girls. It shows the re-
action of a girl of clean
character and a man who in
other circumstances might
have been an inspiration to
men. It carries with it a
quick spice of humor and
the softening influence of
romance.
PRICE 6/-, Postage 3d.
The late Mr. John Gals-
worthy said: “I’ve lapped
up your novel, which I think
extraordinarily actual, vivid
and good.” This is an epic
of the city’s back streets.
Jonah is an unforgettable
character, as truly Australian
in his way as any man from
the Bush. The book will
surprise those who now read
it for the first time, by its
dramatic power in telling of
a phase of Australian life
which has almost entirely
vanished.
PRICE 6/-, Postage 3d.
“It ia a fascinating record
of the great days of Tas-
mania seen with the romance
that always clings to a lost
cause.”—London “Times.-”
“It is a picturesque piece

lated.” —London “Sunday

“It is decidedly one of the

“In many ways ‘The Dough-

BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
PAUSING in Brazier-street Alf eyed
the tumbledown ’Loo street; the
sniff of spring in the evening air
only made it worse. There was the
backyard of Ettore Scala’s place up the
lane, piled with empty fruit-cases ; old
Marty Day’s spick-and-span shop was
red and warm in the westering sun.
Damn Marty Day! His flash shop made
the rest of the street look like hell.
Mrs. Coulter’s store at the corner,
now —that was right, with its small-
paned windows and jumble of lollies and
bacon and rolled oats, with a dash of
eggs and ladies’ stockings. Admiring the
essential rightness of Mrs. Coulter’s
window-dressing Alf felt his ill-humor
vanishing. It was that sniff of spring in
the air that had done it. Strangers,
spring and Alf, down here in Sydney,
in the ’Loo among the crooks and near-
crooks, the half-baked grog-shops always
being raided, the snowbirds, the drunks,
the deadbeats.
Not too clever at times, among the
near-crooks and the soft things you
could pick up now and then; you got
puzzled, bushed, and a sniff of spring
seemed more than it was.
Coonabarabran —a faint track wind-
ing beside a bit of a rise. That’s what
it seemed to mean —and that wasn’t too
clever either.
A wet, comforting nose came into his
hand, a bony tail thumped his trouser-
leg, brown eyes stared comfortingly up
at him.
“Good-oh, Cobber,” he apologised.
“I’m coming over now.”
Cobber accepted the apology and
trotted across the street to Mrs. Coulter’s
doorway. On the threshold he looked
back, barked a monosyllable of satisfied
welcome when Alf followed him in, and
two more going through the shop to
announce that, so far as he was con-
cerned, the guest of the evening had
arrived.
Mrs. Coulter, shuffling the cards,
glanced through her eyelashes at Alf’s
lean, brown face. “Cobber always lets
us know when it’s you,” she said, and
glanced at him again through her eye-
lashes.
Now that was a point. Once or twice
the thought had crossed his mind, sharp-
ened a bit in six months of the ’Loo
after 30 years of Coonabarabran. He
drank his beer, played his hands, was
down sixpence, was up eighteenpence,
was down again as the thought crossed
his mind to-night several times, back and
forth, while she continued to glance at
and away from him.
She was good-looking ; and things in
general were at the moment far from
that. She was well-known to be stuffy—
a couple of houses up at the top-end and
a six-house terrace down by the docks,
besides one of the oldest stores in the
’Loo, started by the late Coulter’s father
donkeys’ years ago.
The near-crook knows a soft thing
when he sees it, so Alf got his teeth into
it. He went easy on the beer, pre-
sented her with the two-and-tenpence
he was up at the end of the evening,
and impassively outstayed the other
guests, working all out when they had
gone.
“ ‘Love me, love my dog,’ ” she told
him on the threshold under the moon at
midnight. “Dad had a picture called
that in the parlor at home. I always
liked it.”
Cobber, barking curtly in farewell,
seemed not so sure of this business. He
even snorted in scorn as he vanished into
the freedom of the spring night, stronger
now in the empty street.
Most of the immediate ’Loo came to
the wedding jollo to drink the beer and
admire the bride’s new fawn coat-and-
skirt. Mary Day thought she looked
years younger in it and said so; but
Mary never did like her. Anyhow, so
many nice things were being said in the
general glow of the party that an odd
nasty one was neither here nor there.
Alf’s all-round, feeling was glow, too.
The soft thing was a certainty now ; he
just sat in his store and took the money
from now on, with a party or two in
the back room to break the monotony.
Maybe a night or two off the chain once
in a while....
This last thought lingered at the back
of his mind. Throughout the business of
shaking hands, opening beer, drinking
beer, filling glasses, he remembered the
tight roll in his hip pocket.
, On Saturday he had found a certainty
I at Randwick; the roll was the result.
Nobody’s business but his own, natur-
ally ; it was a standby ; he had bought
a new rig-out for his wedding-day, and
what was left was an entirely private
matter between him and the nights-out
and what-not he proposed to spend it on.
And there were quite a few escapes of
one kind and another in it.
Watching the shivoo and opening and
drinking beer he realised that the means
of escape might become important. Well,
he had them. Lifting his glass he drank
a silent toast to the roll.
A sudden jolt at his elbow shot the
glass out of his hand. He looked down.
To see Cobber glaring up at him, fangs
bared, bristling
“Hey, Alf!” a furious voice stormed
into his surprise. “What sort of a game
is this?”
He turned to the bride beside him.
The beer had landed in her lap. The
new fawn skirt seemed to be one ruinous
stain from waist to hem....
“I’m sorry, Janet,” he began. “It
was”
“Sorry be damned!” she told him
roundly, the note of livid rage rising in
her voice. “Me coat-and-skirt’s ruined!”
“I tell you it was the dog,” he pro-
tested. “He jumped at me elbow and sent
the glass flying”
“Oh yeah?” There was a deadly still-
ness in the rage now, a stillness on the
shocked shivoo. The bride’s bright eyes
were hard, bitter, cruel. “Blame it on the
dog, do you, on me Cobber that I had
years before I saw you”
' “I can’t blame it on meself, can I,
when he did it,” Alf snapped.
“Years before you came sneakin’
round,” the stilled, implacable voice went
on, ignoring him. “To find a soft thing,
to marry a hard-working woman with a
bit o’ money when you hadn’t a deener
to call your own and couldn’t earn one,
only pinch it from drunks and”
“Be damned! ” he cut in. • This was
over the fence, before the whole shivoo.
“Buy another coat and skirt.”
“With what? With your money, Mr.
Alfred Raven?” she asked gently, a
world of scorn in each word. “Or with
my own?”
“With mine.” He threw the tight roll
on to the table. “Take it out o’ that.”
He’d show them who hadn’t a deener
, In a flash she had slipped the roll into
her new handbag. “Thank you, dear,”
she said gently, her voice empty of all
rage and scorn. “We’ll call this your
contribution to the business you’re com-
ing into.... I’ll go and change me
frock, if you’ll all excuse me a couple
of ticks.” She smiled blandly round the
company. “Mister Independence, isn’t
he? I knew you were all wrong about
him,” she added at the door before she
turned and went out, with the handbag.
Dumbfounded, Alf glared down at
Cobber. “Of all the stinkin’ narks”....
he muttered. “And on me wedding-
day! What made you do it?”
Cobber’s reply was a deep growl,
heavy with the scorn of indifference, and
another baring of his fangs.
And it wasn’t a soft thing, either. It
was hard —stone hard. Seven in the
morning till midnight were the working
hours, the spells being listening to Janet
telling her troubles, mostly caused by
him. Much of it was a sort of house-
work —cleaning and sweeping the shop
and back-room, dusting the stock, wash-
ing up milk-containers and dippers, boil-
ing this and putting that out to dry —
all in an overcrowded two-by-four ’Loo
store and yard.
It was dreary, dull. Kids came in with
ha’pennies, and old women with
troubles; drunks with determined minds
to get bacon, bread, cheese, on the nod;
near-crooks with determined minds to
pinch what they could and get out —and
he had to shepherd the lot and keep
smiling, to teach the kids to spend a
ha’penny in less than half an hour, to
run the drunks out, to
That tight roll, far away in the peace
of the imminent Domain and maybe no
dinner, looked like the steps of paradise.
Day after day, seven days a week...-
She didn’t want a husband ; she wanted
a rouseabout for nix. It wasn’t she who
was the soft thing.
And Cobber, his mate of old
Cobber was the lousiest nark of the lot.
He waited round corners in the yard,
nipped out and worried Alf’s ankles,
snarled at him, cursed him, bit him, made
his life a miser? as well as a dreary
nothing. Misery was right, too, when

Roboleine has proved a real blessing to thous-
ands of anxious mothers who have seen their
ailing little ones brought back to vigorous
health by this magical tonic food. Roboleine
is not a “medicine.” It contains no drugs—
nothing but a concentration of Nature’s own most
valuable body-building foods, rich in vitamins.
Not only is Roboleine a complete food in itself
—in addition it causes the body to extract the
utmost nourishment from the ordinary diet. Read
what Roboleine contains. RED AND WHITE
BONE MARROW to make good red blood.
CREAM OF MALT, a source of energy. EGG
YOLK, containing lecithin, the greatest nerve
food known. LEMON JUICE for building bone.
VITAD, a wonderful tasteless concentrate of cod
liver oil, the most powerful source of vitamins
A and D. If you do not know from experi-
ence what Roboleine can do for ailing children,
send the coupon for a sample. Three teaspoons-
ful a day (the proper ration for children) costs
less than 3d., surely little enough to pay for that
priceless blessing, perfect health.

even your mate went back on you. If
it wasn’t for a yarn with Snowy Nilson
now and again Alf would have cut his
throat.
Snowy was good at soft things; as
a rule, you could trust him as a side-
kick to help you to a clear getaway. On
a getaway with the minimum of violence,
at the worst. There was a thing out at
Drummoyne, he was telling Alf, a bit of
a tobacconist’s shop, s.-p. ; and race-
days, too late for the bank, the bloke
kept the cash in....
Alf listened. After a spell of Janet’s
store and Janet —this Drummoyne thing
was music....
It was six months in the end, and the
magistrate said that was letting him down
lightly. Snowy got twelve.
Coming down Brazier-street with the
six months behind him, Alf smelt the
spring again. A shadowy memory of
that winding track up by Coonabarabran
stirred and quickened him.
He’d chuck it and go back up-country.
It was graft, but it was better than.. ..
The stretch at Goulburn had taken the
guts out of him, broken his nerves. He’d
get it back up-country —nowhere else.
If he stayed down here she’d only get
on his nerves and he’d find another soft
thing and be put in again
“Hullo, Alf! Back again?” Marty
Day was smiling all over his face ; he
put down his basket to shake hands with
Alf. “Well, well—it’s good to see you
back”....
Alf felt the sudden glow of the wel-
come ; it mingled with the heavy spring-
time smell, lingered and warmed him
after Marty had picked up his basket
and gone on. Old Mrs. Stacey nodded
and beamed, and the two Brawner kids
ran across the street screeching their
welcome home to him; Mary Day
turned from her chat with Mrs.
Kavanagh and flashed him her whole-
some smile....
It wasn’t so bad ; he felt his shoulders
straighten. Here was the lazy, happy
’Loo glad to see him, to feel him back
home ; he was somebody here. It would
be all right; he’d put the boot in, give
Janet a jog once in a while —he’d been
too lenient. All she wanted was a man
who knew his own mind —damn the
country! Too much graft; worked pro-
perly, there was no graft here at all.
Besides, she wasn’t so bad....
Other people joined the Brawner kids ;
he was the centre of a fair-sized group
when he reached the store.
She, too, standing on the threshold,
was all aglow with greeting, her eyes
soft and warm. And watching him
through their lashes in the sleepy spring
sunlight.
“Well, dear,” she said gently. “You
got back all right—home again, eh?
Come in and I’ll get a cup”
“Gee!” A sudden screech from a
Brawner kid split the day. “Ain’t that
your dawg, Mrs. Raven —ain’t that
Cobber?”
Janet looked up the street; Cobber
was standing on the far corner, his head
cocked, one ear a note of interrogation.
“Cobber!” she cried. “Me own
Cobber! Come to mother” she
turned from Alf and ran across the
street, most of the fair-sized group to -
lowing her in delighted surprise.
“Well, what do you know about that?
Old Noddy Colin chuckled and spat.
“That dawg’s been lost missin for
pretty near six months. An’ now e s
found ’is way home again. Wonderful
how they do it, isn’t it?”
Alone in the street, Alf glared at the
lazy, heavy day, at the broken houses,
at the dust. A dog....that lousy nark
of a Cobber. He’d always had it in tor
him, Cobber ; and now he’d come and
queered his home-coming—there wasn t
any home-coming. And he wasn’t any
more than a dog in the 'Loo not so
much.
Good-oh. He was through. Sammy
Miles, out of Coonabarabran, would give
him a job. He’d walk it, pick up a job
or two on his way for his scran and to
get a couple of blankets —he, too, spat
and turned back up the hill.
At the head of Abercrombie-street he
paused on the pavement-edge to let a
stream of lorries pass. This Surry Hills
was different
A cold, wet nose pushed itself com-
fortably into his hand while a bony tail
thumped hard at his trouser-leg.
“Hullo, Cobber!”
Alf stared down at the dog, at the
lustrous, beseeching eyes looking up at
him. The bewilderment in Alf’s eyes
gradually disappeared. He grinned,
caressing the nose a moment.
“Good-oh, Cobber —want to come
with me, do you? Come on, then.”
Overdoing It.
Bloggs staged a very good penitence
when he felt it was required after that
night out. He bore the reproaches
patiently, waiting until he could pretend
that he thought his wife was out of
hearing.
“My darling wife! To think that my
thoughtless self-indulgence has hurt her
feelings! I could kick myself!” he cried,
making sure that she was listening.
He strode to the sideboard dramati-
cally and, seizing the whisky-bottle,
stepped resolutely towards the window.
“Vile, cursed stuff!” he declaimed.
“Never again shall I touch a drop of it!”
“Don’t throw it out!” cried his wife.
“Don’t try to restrain me!” he im-
plored. “It has hurt you, and I hate it.”
“John,” she said coldly, “the last time
you threw that bottle of whisky away
it crashed into the begonias, and you
broke a number of other plants recover-
ing it in the morning. You might just
as well put it back on the sideboard at
once.”
Bloggs has realised that an act can be
overplayed; he will have to think out
a new one.

The Permanent Job.
BY WALTER JAGO.
EVERYONE on the station called him
Jack, and everyone asked everyone
else how old they thought he might
be. Jack himself did not know, but, to
be on the safe side, he’d tell you that he
was rising 60.
Edward, the youngest son of the late
squatter, remembered Jack’s coming to
the station forty-five years ago, when
Edward was nine. Jack then was a young
man of anything between twenty-five and
thirty. He’d seen the squatter’s wife
bury the old man, and the sons bury
their mother ; and the ups-and-downs of
the station life in all those years were
as clear as little pictures in his mind, as
also were the happenings round about
the district.
When Jack spoke of Major’s Flat you
sometimes didn’t know whether he meant
the station where he worked or the
township, which in the early days was
the back paddock. Jack always regretted
the cutting off of that paddock to make
a township; it caused the air to be
stuffy, too, having so many people about
—but one could have suffered that, since
the homestead was seven miles from the
township. What did really matter, how-
ever, was that the great boast of a life-
time had been destroyed: the boast that
Major’s Flat was the largest station in
the Monaro.
Jack was to suffer many humiliations
of this kind after the paddock for the
township had been cut off. for closer
settlement took bit by bit of the station
in forty years, until it was now, accord-
ing to Jack’s sorrowful description of it,
hardly large enough to fatten the wom-
bats. It was a murderous thing to cut
up the station, and Jack was certain it
had been the cause of the old man’s
death.
The place had become so small that
the old man had had to take to timber-
getting after he was eighty to make a
living at all; and it had been too much
for a man of his age. There was no say-
ing how much longer he might have
lived but for the murderous onslaught of
the settlers: he’d have been a hundred
and ten by now if they had left him
alone, and might have outlasted that old
Turk. Always doing unexpected things
was the old man.
If the old man had lived, too, things
might have been different for Jack. The
old man had often said Jack would have
a permanent job and need never worry
about getting another y as long as he
lived; but who could say what might
happen any day now that the old man
had been dead for thirty years? He
admitted that the sons, Edward, Bob
and Joseph, had been always fair to him
and had kept him on ; but, still, they
had never promised him that he should
be permanent.
He would forget his grievance in a
moment, hoping for the best and trust-
ing for security in the niche he had made
for himself on the station.

If the red cow had given a little extra
milk that morning he’d report to the
managing brother at once. He had pre-
dicted that the cow would improve, and
advised the boy how she should be
milked. All the other cows were regular
in their issues of milk. They would be
coming on at their full or going off;
but the red cow was an unknown quan-
tity. At any point she would excel her-
self ; at any point she would establish a
new measure for the irreducible mini-
mum.
Edward had said one day that she was
temperamental: she was like those artists
who did mad things and called them
Bohemian. It wasn’t temperament at all,
according to Jack: it was just plain bad
temper. How it could be plain when
Jack colored it so much in the telling 1
couldn’t say, but Jack never liked to
have his statements cross-examined, so
1 didn’t interrupt.
Temperament, Jack reckoned, was a
good thing: it kept you from eating
always from the same joint of corned
beef and saw to it that you got a roast
occasionally. Refinement it was: no
blankard could do without a little blanky
refinement. So forceful was Jack on the
point that I felt he must be right.
I was in the men’s hut alone when
Jack came in fresh from a new battle in
the milkers’ paddock. He’d been telling
me of some of his difficulties.
“Take that red cow, now.” He offered
me the cow, not bodily, but as a hypo-
thesis. “She’s got the mad look of a
poet in her eyes : a sulky sort of look,
with two red coals in the middle of it.
They never seem to burn out, but always
keep alight—always ready to be insulted,
they are, and always looking for trouble.
Just ride up to that cow and try to drive
her to the milking, and if she’s in the
middle of making up a poem, or even
just thinking of something, it’s hell-for-
leather and Barney’s bull for you and
your horse to the nearest gate.
“Before I got to know her bad-
tempered ways I nearly lost my life to
her,” he told me. “I rode up to her, as
a man might any day in the year, and
I think to myself—if I even thought to
think at all—that getting her to the yard
is going to be as easy as ploughing in
soft ground, when, by the holy smoke,
she wheels like a hoop and rips me open
in the horse’s flank!
“Up goes the horse in the prettiest
rear you ever saw, and as he’s coming
down she gets me in the chest between
his front legs. We were weakening from
the loss of blood, which was running
out of his flank and chest, and scared
to death ; but I used that stockwhip till
the mountains split with the cracking of
it—you could hear the echoes for half
a day afterwards. With her eyes closed
at last, she rushed past me and ripped
me open here all along the horse’s side
from the hip to the shoulder.
“Before she could open her eyes and
get back at me I was through the gate
and safe home. Bob sewed me up in
the three places on the little horse, but
the rips didn’t heal too nicely, and the
old horse has never been the same since,
what with the flies and a bit of proud
flesh.
“Of course, that day,” he assured me,
“she didn’t give a drop of milk —hold-
ing it up like a dog’s hind leg. We
never tried to bring her in, knowing
how it would be ; and next day she
came quietly with a bucketful of it,
being too big in the udder to do any-
thing else. We get her into the bail,
and it’s easy going for a pint, when
sudden as a tap she turns off, and even
Shakspeare, with Shelley holding the
bucket, couldn’t have got a baby’s bottle
out of her. That’s what temper, which
they call temperament, will do for you! ”
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Dan, who
had come for Jack to help him to get
in the bullocks for the team and had
delayed while Jack finished his yarn. “I
can’t agree that it’s temperament; it
might be culture.”
“It isn’t culture,” Jack asserted em-
phatically. “How could it be culture
for a cow to rip a man from flank to
chest and ruin a good horse?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Dan said doubt-
fully ; “culture’s a strange thing. It re-
minds me of what my dad used to say:
he used to say that animals had a lot
more knowledge than people gave them
credit for. Who can say that the red
cow wasn’t educated in her own way?
She might have had a great plan in
attacking the horse. Perhaps she and
the horse had had a barney in their own
lingo about how much they were doing
for the boss or something. She might
have wanted the horse to go on strike
for better conditions all round, and when
he wouldn’t she was showing him, per-
haps, how the strike weapon could be
used. That’s culture, all right; you can’t
get away from it!”
“I don’t know what you mean by
‘That’s culture,’ ” said Jack surlily, “but
it isn’t culture to my way of thinking.
If there’s any such thing as culture in a
cow —which I doubt —well, old Whitey’s
got it, with cap and gown and brass
finishings. She’s a lady in disguise if ever
there was one. Why, only yesterday I*m
out in the paddock behind the sawmill,
when I jags my shin on a piece of dead
stick. Not being a man of a few words,
I thought I’d let the blood run to cleanse
the wound and, just to fill in time, ease
my feelings a bit, as it were. Old
Whitey’s standing by chewing her cud
not more than a hundred yards on any
side of me as I spun round in a circle
holding my leg up to squeeze the boot
and stop the pain, if possible, this side
of Christmas. It didn’t seem possible,
so 1 sits on the grass face round to old
Whitey, and, as sure as luck’s all one-
sided, she’s going off at a run with her
ears turned over forward to shut out
what I was saying about my injured
feelings.
“That’s refinement and culture joined
together. It’s understanding and fellow-
feeling, unless you’ve got a better name
for it.”
Jack wrinkled his eyes up to see if
Dan was admitting his defeat.
“It’s good taste, too,” Jack went on,
“and proper ladylike conduct. She
allows a man to be human, does old
Whitey. But all that day she kept to
herself and couldn’t be coaxed to let
me near her, although I’d finished my
little discussion with the stick almost
before it had begun. That’s culture ; and
the red cow’s a battle-axe alongside a
feather-duster compared with old
Whitey.”
Dan had to admit that there was much
to justify the claim; he’d often felt like
old Whitey himself when Jack was doing
a bit of plain talking, as he called it.
After that he should always have a
greater respect for the old white cow.
But there were the bullocks to be got
in. The sawmill would be wanting the
logs in the afternoon. Dan was respon-
sible for the bullocks, but he thought
that perhaps Jack would help him to get
them in.
Jack reckoned that he couldn’t; he’d
have to get steam up in the boiler. The
boiler was Jack’s special care. It was
part of his niche ; he wouldn’t let any-
one go near it.
The sawmill was now the main source
of revenue to the station; the consum-
mation it was of the timber-getting indus-
try commenced by the old man when
he was 80 and too old for that kind of
work. Jack knew exactly how much
firing was necessary to keep the great
saw turning through the huge logs, and
never once had the saw been known to
fail. He’d watch the pulleys drag at the
leather belting, which sometimes flapped,
sagged and hesitated, but never stopped.
Had you been in the engine-room
when Jack was forcing the fire or watch-
ing the pressure-gauge, you’d have heard
him personifying the machinery, coaxing
it, abusing it, threatening and storming
until the terror of failure inspired every
moving thing to a grand success.
“Round you go, you loafing hide of
hell!” he’d bellow at the belting as it
crept almost imperceptibly down the
slope from the pulley to the flywheel,
“Do you think the old man bred the
idea of this plant to have you gaping at
me and going to sleep like a tired flapper
after a dance?”
And the belt would seem to move a
little more certainly, while the big saw
outside, screamingly, desperately, cut
through the heavy butt of the great log
into the less resistant slender end. Then
the belting would travel with great speed,
as though running away from Jack’s
abuse.
At night Jack would tell the story in
the hut of how he got the saw through
the big log.
(Continued on next page.)
THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
The Falling Birth-rate
One reason for its decline (B. 27/6/’34)
is psychological. Nowadays people with
more than two children are thought to
be fools, and their friends look on them
with amused contempt. Women are
ashamed of becoming pregnant because
of the sarcastic remarks of their sex.
When our second child was born my
wife received letters from relatives—one
almost a stranger—urging well-tried
methods of prevention. A friend of
mine, a tradesman, called on a customer,
who demanded to know if it were true
his wife had a child the day before. On
learning that it was, “And your other
child is barely two,” she hissed. “Brute!”
With this she slammed the door in his
(ace and has since refused to deal with
him. Reads rather amusing, but he did
not find it so. A flood of circulars from
purveyors of contraceptives and others
is flowing from the cities to the country.
One I saw hinted that abortion would be
performed for five pounds. Ladies (and
sometimes gentlemen) who call at Mrs.
Cocky’s back door purveying needles
and pins often have “chemist’s sundries”
to offer.— Pater (N.S.W.).
Unemployment
It is caused by the big difference
between the cost of raw material (i.e.,
the price paid to the producer of that
material) and the retail cost of the
finished article. The difference is made
up of actual cost of manufacture, freight,
taxes, retail profits and cost of distribu-
tion. The bigger the reduction of this
difference the more will unemployment
diminish. — Bill the Lizard (Vic.).
Penalised for Working
A man who had been out of work
for more than two years was offered a
job at less than the award rate. The
N.S.W. Department of Labor and Indus-
try granted a permit for three months at
£3 a week. When the three months
elapsed he was put off, as he could get
no extension. He has an invalid wife
and two children. Obliged to go back on
the dole, he called at the Labor Bureau
on a Monday to be registered for em-
ployment again. He was told to come
back on Thursday for a card, and to call
at the Chief Secretary’s Department on
Friday with a paper which would have
to be properly filled in. After that an
investigating officer would be sent to his
home to verify the statement, and on
the following Friday he might draw
rations. Can you wonder that the un-
employed grow bitter? —J. C. (N.S.W.).
Too Much Land
The trouble with many Australian
farmers is that they have too much
land; but Governments are slow to
recognise it. In the Western District of
Vic., where there is a 24-inch rainfall and
better, settlers have 1000-acre blocks,
and Government aspires to give them
500 acres more from land surrendered
by failures. What about opportunities
for unemployed who were too young
to go to the war?
I know dozens of Victorians who
began with 320 acres of the same land
and are living easy lives to-day because
of keen management and hard work.
With improvements in care of pastures,
in agriculture and grazing, even smaller
areas will suffice.— Try It (Vic.).
“Honors”
It is time Australia ceased playing with
these baubles.
Publication of honors lists excites a
passing curiosity among those who like
to know who’s “got one” and “what
did he get?” Then begins a harmless
controversy among friends as to why
Bill was created a K.C.M.G. and Tom a
mere K.B. or K.B.E.
Many Australians who have accepted
titles have passed away and been for-
gotten. Other untitled persons will be
long remembered for the contributions
they have made to the country’s develop-
ment and progress. Of these are John
Macarthur, Samuel Marsden, Farrer,
Sturt, Deakin, Bruce, Hughes, Chaffey
and Holman. The baptismal names of
these men need no fore or aft embel-
lishments.
There has been a ludicrous extension
of the granting of “honors” to civil ser-
vants ; it is a laughing-stock in the
service itself. Besides creating invidious
distinctions it leads to heartburnings. The
head of one department is labelled
C.M.G., of another C.B.E. The latter
is dissatisfied ; he regards the distinction
conferred on him as no honor at all.
In the New Year’s list of 1933 the Prime
Minister’s press-agent was created an
0.8. E., his stenographer an M.8.E., and
his messenger and chauffeur were
granted the gold medal of the Order of
the British Empire. His poodle was
overlooked. —A. H. (Canberra).
Money from Trippers
Summer cruising is now in its third
year in Britain. In the past 12 months
the White Star and Cunard lines received
£900,000 from cruising fares, and the
customs got £20,000 as revenue on
souvenirs brought back. So far, our own
shipping companies have confined them-
selves mainly to occasional trips to the
Islands or the Barrier Reef; but why
stop at that? There are places just as
interesting within three or four days’
steaming.—R. J. (N.S.W.).
The Folkard Case
There are a couple of aspects requir-
ing emphasis. My son, John M. Folkard,
passed a severe medical examination
prior to his admission to the Naval Col-
lege in 1930, and was classed as physi-
cally perfect. When he broke down in
1933 three medical officers, after a suc-
cession of X-rays, failed to find anything
the matter with him. A civilian doctor
detected the abnormality at the first
examination without the aid of an X-ray.
In the meantime the lad had been re-
ferred to as a malingerer and subjected
to massage which aggravated his con-
dition.
I complained in a letter to the local
M.H.R. As a result, my son was brought
before what the Navy Board terms “an
inquiry in the usual service manner.”
The “inquiry” followed immediately
after nine days’ educational examination,
during which time my son was under a
severe mental strain. He was con-
fronted by the admiral and five senior
naval officers, including two com-
manders. Certain extracts from my letter
to the M.H.R. were read to him. He
had no advocate and was afforded no
opportunities of calling witnesses. He
was told he must either make definite
accusations or apologise. A boy of 17
in the presence of so much gold braid
was not prepared to do the former, but
he took good care before leaving the
service to state that he was not satis-
fied with the treatment he had received.
The Navy Board refused to do any-
thing in the way of a corrective opera-
tion, claiming that the boy was born
with the trouble and should never have
entered the service. This in spite of
the fact that he passed as physically per-
fect and stood up to a strenuous course
of physical training and athletics for
over three years till he received a
definite injury; then, in true navy
fashion, he’s thrown overboard like a
broken oar, to drift as best he may.
One senior officer avers that the train-
ing has cost the Commonwealth in the
vicinity of £3OOO. Whatever it may have
cost the Commonwealth it has cost my
son the best four years of his educational
life and considerable physical pain, and
neither he nor the Commonwealth is to
benefit in any way from the drain on
the public purse.—S. Folkard (Vic.).

BLUE NORTH
H. DRAKE-BROCKMAN
This strongly-written first-novel holds
the color and romantic appeal of
fortune-seeking on the West Aus-
tralian pearling grounds in the days
when that glamorous life made it's
irresistible appeal to the adventurous
of all kinds and classes. “Hand-
some” John Fordyce, throwing off
the petty ties binding him to his
society-obsessed lady and the social
life of the South, adventures into the
“blue North” in search of complete
freedom among men. He finds it
there, but only through the agency
of Woman—a wanton his handsome
figure attracts at one of the pearling
outposts, and who, when he breaks
from their one-night liaison, takes a
fiercely-jealous revenge on a pretty
little waif of the outpost, with unex-
pected results for herself, for the
waif, and for the man she sought to
hurt. A feature of the novel is the
realistic presentation of the pearling
life, spiced with adventure, rich
finds and sometimes violent action.
A very colorful picture of pearling
up and down the blue waters of the
Nor’-West.

“I had a fire going,” he’d say, “that
would have boiled the Bagja River for
a hundred miles, and the saw going
round till you couldn’t tell it was there,
and the driving belt singing the Lord’s
Prayer, with a bit of ‘The Marseillaise’
chucked in to liven it up. All was set,
and Bob runs the log up to the saw on
the rollers. The saw gets Bob in the butt
and bites like the British bulldog at
Trafalgar into the first yard ; and then
she held on for the flash of a second, with
Bob looking as though he’d never get
through. But I’m there with gentle
suasion and great determination, and, with
the boiler bursting to the last ounce and
the flywheel just going over, it’s me and
the belting for it to the death in a battle
of the survival of the best man. Slip,
you cow, would you! You crow-eaten
son of Satan! Rainbows of sulphur, to
the hobs of Beelzebub with you —back
to the cow you came from and be cut to
bootlaces with the whips of hell! Over!
And the tears were in my eyes like a
maiden’s prayer.
“1 threw in a pound with both hands,
and the great belt answered to the
friendly touch. Slowly, slowly, glinting
over went the wheel, with the belt, mov-
ing, gathering speed. The saw gets Bob
in the belly—out of the heavy going into
the thin end. Bob’s through, and the
log’s in half with a great roar of triumph,
and the fire looking at me like a girl in
love, every bit of machinery doing the
maypole on a spring day, while the belt
is like a flock of lambs gambolling over
a hill of daisies. It was a great trial of
strength, I can tell you ; with that saw
a man could cut the devil into ham
sandwiches.”
Jack wished that the old man could
have been there to see the great victory,
but what with him dead of a broken
heart and lumbago he couldn’t be ; and
with the station being only a post-hole of
its former self it was just as well, any-
way.
The electrified audience of one who
had heard Jack’s blistering account of
the victory walked to the door of the
hut as Jack went out. Over and oyer
in his mind the audience was turning
the words, “It is just as well, anyway.”
Up the slope of the little hill to the
sawmill a lantern could be seen swinging
backwards and forwards, marking the
progress of Jack on his way to the engine-
room. Inside the air was warm and all
vas still.
“Well, I’m proud of you,” Jack said
addressing the machinery. “Nobody
would think to see you standing there as
still as a bogged waggon that you had
the muscles of a hundred horses; but
you have, you little beauty—and more,
with understanding and pride in your
work ; and you never fail to appreciate
proper human kindness. That’s why I’m
here to bid you good-night. You’ve had
a hard day. God be with you till the
next logs come in, and then, by the
bursting thunder, it will be me and you
for it to the last smudge of steam!"
Back down the little hill he came with
his lantern to light him to his bunk in
the hut. The problem of the red cow
was before him as his first job in the
morning, but she was, in the soft
thoughts of a restful night, a very small
difficulty. He could, at least, sleep one
more night unafraid of the sack —and
who could deny that one day he should
be made a permanent hand!
How to Become a Songwriter.
First of all you must have a keyword.
Take “blue,” for example. Now there’s a
keyword—where don’t you hear it? Blue
heaven, blue skies, blue birds, blue
rooms, boys in blue, girls in blue, Big
City Blues, Am l Blue? Art thou Blue?
Is he, she or it Blue? There are count-
less instances. Take the “Honey” songs,
take the “Money” songs, take the
“Sonny” songs—all of them masterpieces
based on a single dominant idea. It’s
easy.
You’ve got your stock rhymes —
sad, glad ; you, true; park, dark ; high,
sky ; moon, croon ; heart, apart —use
them and stick to them. Never give the
public a new rhyme ; the public doesn’t
want it.
The following example by Ima Neu-
singer may be taken as a guide. If there
is a flaw in this exquisite study it is that
the beauty, the charm, the genius of this
delightful fragment may deter young
authors by its very strength:
The moon
Is blue
For you,
Just you.
My dove,
I love
Just you.
But don’t be deterred. Even Neusinger
had to start somewhere.

No Family.
BY KYLIE TENNANT.
TS a good thing I’ve got no family,”
I Joe Paul said as he strolled out into
X , • u i . r, ' „
his backyard alter a quarrel with
the rent-collector.
“Yes,” he went on, “I’m sorry for
chaps who’ve wives and kids to look
after. Only a nuisance—eh, Uncle?”
Uncle a oreaw bearded old centle-
Uncle a greasy, bearded old gen
mm who to usiaHy to be found on
the back doorstep in the sun, removed
his pipe and spat sympathetically.
Paul had just expressed the same
views, more forcibly, to the rent-col-
lector when that optimist applied tor
the twelve months’ rent due for the shop
in which J. Paul, Boot Repairer, car-
ried on his trade.
“I ain’t no married man,” he had
stormed. “Y’ can’t put it over me. How
about doing something to them walls
first? They’re that damp the moss is
growing on them. Pay back rent for a
miserable dark hole where I’m losing me
eyesight! All right, chuck me out. I
haven’t any family to worry about. Well,
here’s this week’s rent; and damn lucky
io get it.”
Paul, Uncle and Whitey Sims lived
together in the room behind the shop.
It had not been intended for a dwelling-
place, but the three found it satisfactory,
There were a fireplace, a table, a few
soapboxes for seats and some bedding
iptowed in the cupboard. They cooked
over the fire and slept beside it at night,
Their needs were few, their main ex-
travagance being a succession of broken-
down motor-bicycles which Whitey re-
paired and sold.
Whitey always had some scheme on
hand for making money. Occasionally
one succeeded. His partners never
grumbled when they failed. “He’s a
genius, that boy,” Uncle would remark
admiringly every time Whitey made a
few shillings on a machine that had cost
him weeks of labor.
Uncle was the most unprofitable of
the three. Before drink spoiled him. he
had been a cornet player. Paul first
met him as a member of the Sal-
vation Army band that helped to brighten
Friday night outside the little shop. Mo
one could fail to notice Uncle s hoary
beard and profound Amen. He had
]ived the P Salvation Army hostel until
the advent of a superintendent with
extreme teetotal opinions.
Uncle was all in favor of Paul’s views
on families, as he explained the night of
the c ° llector ’ s visit The Partners were
sitting round a blaze fed by palings
h| J whit had taken from neighbor-
., J &
a ' man’s sorrer,” said Uncle,
« comes through women. Take me
daughter Ada, f’r instance. Y’ couldn’t
smok:e j n the sitting-room, and y’
cou jdn’t eat in yer shirtsleeves, and y’
couldn’t even smell of beer. ‘Disgusting,’
she says j was ‘All right, me girl,’ 1
sa ys, ‘never come to me if you’re in
trouble, you and yer jellyfish of a hus-
band.’ Left them flat, I did.”
Paul grun t e d, but Whitey was paying
no attention. He was listening to a sound
f rom the direction of the back shed,
where lay his latest bicycle. He rose
su ddenly and went out to protect it, if
neC essary. Presently he reappeared, half-
dragging a ragged but confident smail
boy.
“I was only looking for somewhere to
sleep,” the boy explained. “I had a good
place last night at the back of the tram-
sheds, but a big John nearly caught me,
and he’ll be waiting there to-night.”
“What’s yer name, son?” Paul asked,
drawing forward a butter-box.
“Mick,” he answered, sitting down
fi rm i y> but keeping his eyes turned from
t h e half-loaf of bread and the three
enamel mugs sending up a comforting
steam of tea.
Having fed him, they discovered that
he had come from Eugoner by burrow-
ing in among wheat-sacks in a railway
truck.
“Why did you leave your folks?”
Paul inquired.
“Haven’t got any. I’m on the State.”
He launched into a description of the
farm on which he had been boarded out.
He had grown tired of rising at five and
working until it was time to leave on

the four-mile tramp to school. He
toiled on the farm again from the time
school came out until dark, and fell
asleep over his homework.
“I was that hungry I scoffed the fowls’
food,” he said shrilly. “Didn’t get a
square meal all the time I was there, an’
slept on some sacks in the shed.”
“I thought they had inspectors,”
Whitey cut in.
“ ’Course they have. A big fat chap!
Drove out in a car and had lunch with
Mrs. Harris. Looked at the room they
said I slept in—Jimmy Harris’s room,
with a blue cover on the bed an’ flowers
on the washstand. Then he’d tell me to
behave meself, an’ drive away. They
nearly belted the life out of me once
when I told him 1 had no boots.”
“And what are yer going to do now?”
“Look out the p’lice don’t get me and
find a job.”
“An’ y’ ain't got no one to go to?”
Uncle inquired.
Mick laughed scornfully. “I wouldn’t
go to them, if I could. Pretty sort they
must’ve been to leave me on the State!
I look after meself, I do.”
“Good on yer, kid!” said Joe.
“Precious little me family ever did for
me! Turned me out to work when I
was twelve.”
“Never depend on anyone,” Uncle
added. “Each for himself, that’s what
I say.”
The Independent Order of Bachelors
broke into its hymn of hate:
“They never give you any thanks.”
“Nagging at you.”
“Wanting yer to work,” from Uncle.
“Worrying you for money.”
When bedtime arrived each made a
contribution from his pile of bedclothes,
and the new partner was given the left-
hand corner near the fireplace.
Mick, after a few weeks, managed, by
sheer impudence and numerous fights
with rivals, to establish himself as a
newsboy. He was little and quick and
intelligent, and sometimes brought home
as much as fifteen shillings a week. This
was welcome, as Whitey had made no-
thing for three weeks. He retrieved
himself, however, by his sensational Deal
in Doormats, when, single-handed, he
stripped one street of those useful articles
and sold them in the next. This had
returned huge profits, as Whitey had
removed only those mats that were nearly
new. The firm felt rich.
But on the night after the Deal in
Doormats the luck began to change. The
partners were waiting for Uncle. Paul
was mixing a patent waterproof shoe-
varnish ; Mick, who had left his beat
after he had sold out of final extras, pol-
ished the potatoes off his plate ; Whitey
was planning the purchase of some tennis
balls second-hand.
A knock at the door brought all three
to ’attention. It was only Mrs. Menzies
from the third house up the road, but
she was bursting with news.
“I seen Mr. Leslie” (Mr. Leslie was
Uncle) “bein’ taken along to the p’lice
station by the tall dark cop what raided
Marks’s place. Swearing something ter-
rible, Mr. Leslie was. The cop ’ad ’im by
the collar, and ’im ’anging on to ’is cornet
as though it was a drowning straw.”
“And there,” said Whitey bitterly,
“goes all the cash we made on them
doormats.”
Uncle was told by the magistrate next
morning that he was a disgrace to the
community. It cost his partners two
pounds to get him out.
“It’s just as well y’ haven’t any family
to be ashamed of y’,” Paul remarked. “I
suppose it could be worse.”
Two days later Paul spilt the pot of
boiling waterproof shoe-varnish over his
hand. While he sat and cursed, Mick and
Whitey were left to carry on. Uncle
would only sit and hug his cornet, shak-
ing his head if anyone spoke to him.
• “If I were to marry now,” he would
say despondently, “I could go an’ live on
’er relations.”
“More likely to come an’ live on you,”
Paul snarled.
Mick returned home one night white-
faced and trembling. Because he had been
questioned by an official of the Child
Welfare Department, the partners decided
that it was dangerous for him to go on
selling papers. Then it was that Uncle
rose to the occasion.
Uncle tramped from house to house
until he got a few days’ gardening by tell-
ing a tale that would have brought tears
to the eyes of a potato. He painstakingly
denied himself even one beer out of his
earnings, and when the gardening was
done set out early each morning, cheer-
fully whining his tale of woe to half-
shut doors. He often brought home
some small contributions in the shape
of food. But the rent-collector was now
becoming threatening.
“We’ll hang on if we can,” Paul said
to Whitey as they sat late worrying over
ways and means. “We’ve fought to hold
this place together, an’ we may manage
yet, barrin’ more accidents. I don’t want
to leave here unless we have to.”
“What about Mick?” Whitey said;
and they brooded over how to keep him.
The problem was settled by the arrival
one morning of a policeman and a Child
Welfare official. Luckily Mick had gone
out with a little cart to collect manure,
which was sold to gardeners. Uncle to
the rescue again!
“Not on yer life!” he asserted. “That’s
my niece Emma’s boy you’re talking
about. She left him with us when she an’
her husband had to go up-country.
They’re goin’ to send for him.”
“Urn,” the official sniffed. “Is Mr.
Paul any relation to the lad ?
“Joe is Emma’s brother,” said Uncle
promptly. “ ’E’s been like a second
father to her son.”
“And Mr. Sims?”
“He’s Emma’s husband’s brother,” re-
torted Uncle. “And I’d like to know
where else they’d ’ave left the little chap. ’
“Oh, certainly. Must stay with his
family,” the official said sarcastically.
“Who’d have him if we wouldn’t?
Blood’s thicker than water, is what I
say,” said Uncle, courteously holding
open the door for the gentlemen.
Outside, the official looked at the con-
stable.
“Well,” he said, “I’ll have to make
further inquiries, but from Mr. Blake’s
description 1 am certain this is the boy.
Rather a strange environment for a child,
anyway. I don’t think I shall have any
trouble getting an order of the Court to
remove him.”
However, when, a few days later, the
department descended in its rhajesty, it
found only an empty jam-tin, a pair of
old sandshoes and some dead matches. It
had taken a deal of argument to con-
vince Whitey that, if Mick was to be
saved, the beloved motor-bike must be
exchanged for a decrepit horse and
buggy. But exchanged it had been at a;
loss that nearly broke Whitey’s heart.
The buggy creaked out into the open
country, Mick, Uncle and the cornet
perched on a pile of baggage. Whitey
and Joe trudged behind.
“It’s a damn good thing,” Paul re-
marked with a grin, “that we ain’t got
Emma with us, too. jUncle grumbles
enough for ten. Got any idea where
we’re going?” ';V- ”
“No,” said Whitey, “but. we can:stick
together. It might be worse.”
Paul nodded. “After all we ain’t got
no family to look after.”
Voices.
A Jekyll and a Hyde in every man
Wage secret warfare till the curtain falls.
While Duty leads, a siren whisper drawls
Of glamorous paths beyond Convention’s ban.
Brute strength, red hate, Suspicion’s meanest
plan
Are held in leash by Chivalry. The calls
Of hearthside oft grow faint and duty palls
Before the lure of Spain and Ispahan.
Still through the tangled jungle leopards creep;
Wild deer still roam upon the windy hill.
Men work in sunless offices and sleep
Where scent nor breath of night comes not.
Yet still
The heart is vexed with longings sharp as
Saul’s,
And hears two voices till the curtain falls.
N.S.W.
CHRISTINE COMBER.
Undine.
The waves are lapping at my knees,
Their soulless green tongues suck and kiss,
And soulless and salt-sweet as these
Was my first bliss.
O glassy-emerald wind-rocked bed,
Strewn with the petals of the spray,
A curving wave at foot and head!
The great whales grey
Sent fountains for me high in air.
Foaled by the moon, my horses while,
Rearing with rapture, galloped where
Strange bones lay bright
On clashing gravel trod by storm—
Drowned bones, men’s bones, with which 1
played,
Weaving light fancies of the form
Long since unmade.
Sitting alone, with light thoughts warm.
The waves are lapping at my knees;
Bleak are the dripping rocks that wall
The ocean-pool; hollowed by seas
This niche-seat small
Wherein I sit ’twixt green and blue —
The known salt wave, the unknown sky.
Crying and crying “What are you?”
Pale birds go by.
I have one soul, I’ve had three loves
(Gold human-jewels stud my ears).
When man’s voice the cold wave-girl moves
The soul appears
Between the water and the air,
As sea-face lifts to, human-face,
Growing tangible and flushed and fair
With the embrace \
Where the wet , margin shimmers bare.
The waves'are lapping at my knees;
.It cannot go—my soul and I
Down to the vale . of amber trees.
The land is dry,
As paths of dust where many tread,
1 And the brown, wistful petals fall.
Perhaps' the unknown sky o’erhead,
In some far hall,
May keep a soul’s cup, sunrise-red.

The OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO PRACTISE
PELMANISM
ARE ITS STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION
JAN AND NEW ZEALAND
A CABINET MAKER: “The chid
benefit 1 have received is that of know-
ing myself and my limitations. I have
strengthened my confidence, and been
assisted in overcoming a shy and re-
served nature. 1 realise that every day
l am showing some improvement.”
ENGINEER: “I feel physically and
mentally alive and ready for my day's
work. I can find interest in it now,
when I was beginning to think I had
made a mistake.”
ASSESSOR: "Considerable progress in
my conversational efforts, which arc now
a pleasure and relaxation, instead of an
embarrassment.”
DOCTOR: “Whilst visiting many large
centres and interviewing numbers of
business and professional men 1 have
found repeatedly coming to my aid the
benefits of the Pelman Course.”
CLERK: “Keener interest in life and
improved greatly in Self-confidence, Per-
sonality and Memory. Conducting my
social life confidently and more effici-
ently.”
FARMER: “I took up the course with
main object of overcoming a reserved
nature, which precluded me from taking
part in discussions of policy and in de-
bates. I have achieved this object. Also,
I find myself rapidly acquiring a larger
circle of friends.”
FARMER : “The Lesson on Personality
is splendid; all fears are gone, and I
now enjoy my social life.”
CLERK: “Last month I won a Flying
Scholarship for which there were 216
entrants. I thank Pelmanism for this
success, chiefly because of the wonderful
manner in which it has increased my
self-confidence.”
CYCLE ASSEMBLER: “I have some-
thing to show for the Pelman Training.
I have just won the State 25-mile Pro-
fessional Cycling Championship. The
Course, by increasing my confidence,
certainly helped me to gain this title.”
SHEEP FARMER: “My main object
(the desire to overcome the impediment
in my speech) in taking up the Course
has been attained.”
ENGINEER: “I am amazed at the
manner in which these printed Lessons
time and again hit upon, and deal with,
what I have always considered as my
own personal and particular problems.”
HORTICULTURIST: “Thanks to Pcl-
manism, I have instituted a system into
the harvesting which worked out without
a hitch, and have taken oft a record crop
with Jess expense per ton and in a
shorter time than ever 1 have before.”
COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER: “It
may interest you to know that my
figures for the first quarter this year
show an increase of 30 per ccijt."
CLERGYMAN: “I am conscious of
much greater freedom in preaching—
also of fertility of ideas. Last Sunday
l preached four times to different con-
gregations on practically the same sub-
ject with scarcely any repetition.”
A MEMBER OF LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL: “There was a fear in my
mind that I was drifting and was get-
ting past the time when I could settle
down and study without positively driving
myself, and that feeling has been dis-
pelled.”
A JUDGE:, “I have derived great
benefit from the Course, and from the
careful correction of my work. The
lessons should be studied again and again
for the purpose of training, so that when
a great effort is required a man may be
able to use all the powers of his mind
without thinking of rules.”
A TEACHER: “The other night I was
suddenly called upon to speak at a meet-
ing. I found that I did the job much
better than I expected, and with very
little self-consciousness. That is the
result of the Exercises, in that I am
thinking more of what I have to say
than of myself.”
A MECHANIC: “Now that the Course
is finished I must tell you that I am
more than satisfied with it. I am vastly
improved as far as my work is con-
cerned, mainly because I am taking an
interest in it.”
A STENOGRAPHER: “The whole
Course is such a sane, well-balanced
training that one cannot fail to respect
and appreciate it.”
The results of the Pelman Training are seen in the Pelmanist’s every
activity. In his calling, in his social life, in all his interests, Pelmanism
increases his force as an individual, makes him stronger in purpose, more
direct in thought, sounder in judgment, quicker in decision and more
confident and successful in action.

What Pelmanism
Does
It is the plain truth that no matter
where or how a man or woman may
be placed—in a big organisation,
working with many others; in a pro-
fession ; in a small business as pro-
prietor, manager, clerk or salesman ;
on the land ; in factory or workshop ;
in any calling whatever —Pelmanism
will help him to make the most of
his circumstances or his opportuni-
ties.
Remarkable Reports on
the Benefits of Mental
Training.
The accompanying letters from
Students of Pelmanism in Australia
and New Zealand are of recent date,
and are selected mainly because in
each a definite development of one or
more desirable attributes is recorded.
In the last analysis, it is not oppor-
tunity and facilities for acquiring
knowledge—these are open to most
of us —but the possession and extension
of personal qualities which carry one
man ahead of others.
The Headquarters of The Pelman
Institute for the Development of
Mind, Memory and Personality

A New Novel by the Author of “Pageant”
“THE WORLD IS YOURS”
By G. B. LANCASTER
G. B. Lancaster chose the modern Yukon as the setting for this graphic
story. In a succession of brilliantly descriptive pages, this romantic outpost
of Empire is presented with all its haunting glamor. The riddle of human
relationships is personified in Tamsin MacDonald and Kirk Regard. The
tragic love story of these two young people is unfolded in a well*
sustained atmosphere of suspense, leading to a strongly presented climax.
“The World Is Yours,” by G. B. Lancaster, now on sale at all bookstalls and
newsagents. Published by The Endeavour Press, 252 George Street, Sydney.
