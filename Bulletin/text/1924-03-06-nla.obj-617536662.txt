The Red Page
Nellie Stewart’s “Life”
My Life’s Story, by Nellie Stewart (John
Sands, Sydney), commands attention, in the
first place, by many pages of photographs
illustrating the difference between fashions
modern and those of years ago. Portraits
of old actors are profusely reproduced in
the earlier section of the book, and these,
with a wide selection of pictures of the
authoress in stage character, give it an
interest, apart from the letterpress. And
that has all the virtue of the sincerity
Nellie Stewart claims for it. She talks or
herself always as one who was trained by
affectionate parents to devote herself heart
and soul to the profession she has adorned,
and it is only as an earnest theatrical
W'orker that she presents herself in the
picture.
Stagecraft was in her blood. She is
proud to claim Mrs. Yates, a famous con-
temporary of Garrick, as her great-grand-
mother, nor does she offer any apology for
a reproduction of a portrait of Mrs. Yates
in the character of Lady Macbeth, revealing
her as garbed in eighteenth-century evening
dress. Inaccuracy of costume the
stage custom of the times, and Nellie
Stewart suggests, somewhere, that where
the acting was of all importance the cos-
tume could be forgiven. Her mother, who
had a Hibernian streak, was a Miss Theo-
dosia Yates. She taught the chorus at
Drury-lane when she was still a mere girl,
and in 1840 joined an operatic company
which left London for Hobart. Miss
Yates—or Yates Stirling, as she called her-
self —married James Guerin, leader of the
orchestra, and Maggie and Docie Guerin
(afterwards Stewart) were born to her. It
was in 1557 that Mrs. Guerin married
Richard Stewart (born Towzey), an English
Welshman, 12 years his wife’s junior, who
had come to Australia infected with the
gold fever.
Dick Stewart took naturally to theatrical
business after his marriage. When daughter
Nellie was six months old the family moved
from Woolloomooloo to Melbourne, and it
was in Melbourne that Garnet Walcli wrote
the Stewart Family entertainment, wherein
young Nellie, like her dad and half-sisters,
played many parts. “Rainbow Revels,” as
the sketch was called, did so well that
Stewart took his stepdaughters and his
Nellie to Calcutta and Bombay with the
show, and afterwards gave the girls a peep
at London and America ere shipping them
back to Australia. Meanwhile a cable from
manager Coppin, in Melbourne, had engaged
young Nellie for principal boy in his “Sin-
bad” panto. That was in 1880. Nellie
Stewart had arrived. She was a “star.”
She had the advantage of a girl who enters
theatrical life without stage illusions. She
was brought up, by shrewd, conscientious
parents, to a full appreciation of the com-
forts of orderly home life and an under-
standing of domestic duties. One notes in
her story of stage successes, from 1880
onwards, that she never was a spoiled darling
of the public, never -a swelled-headed Nellie.
She took herself seriously—it was her nature
not to" be frivolous- —but not seriously in an
egotistical way. Indeed, her most strik-
ing successes are insufficiently emphasised
in her story. Old theatre-goers remember
that she was the talk of the town for her
sweet performance of Cinderella in William-
son, Garner and Musgrove’s panto, of 1885.
It was the first of her most notable charac-
terisations, but she says little about it,
except that she was the first Australian
prima-donna to wear bare feet on the stage.
Thoroughness! Nor does she dwell with
particular self-satisfaction on the success
of her Dorothy, in Cellier’s opera, which re-
introduced her to Australia after she had
been to England to complete the education
of her singing voice, nor does she enlarge
on the gratifying reminiscence of her triumph
as Ma Mie Rosette, a performance which
may be said to have re-stamped her the un-
rivalled ~ favorite of the operatic stage in
this counti’y. and to have raised her even
higher in public esteem than her remarkable
effort in singing the part of Marguerite in
Gounod’s “Faust” six times a week for some
weeks. The kindly references to Wal-
lace Brownlow, who made ’ his Australian
debut as Henri of Navarre, would give one
to suppose that the handsome new baritone
in a picturesque new part took a full half-
share of the honors in the notable produc-
tion of “Ma Mie Rosette.” But history re-
cords that the prima donna took more than
half share. The wonder of her success lay-
in the fact that Nellie Stewart, familiarised
to the public by dozens of character imper-
sonations in a dozen years, could have thus
renewed her celebrity in rivalry with a new
favorite.
Very readable and very free from self-
conceit arc the first 150 pages. The author-
ess is hampered by the need of “skimming”
the incident of her marriage, which was
hardly a marriage, to Dick Row 40 years
ago, and of treating her subsequent associa-
tion witli George Musgrove as a matter of
social history kr.own to all the world. She
assumes that the reader of her book is con-
versant with the facts. There could be no other
way of dealing with the alliance, but it
carries its own embarrassment with it.
Critics may fairly complain of the book
that it resolves itself into an appreciation of
the late George Musgrove, a man who, for all
his integrity, open-handedness, artistic aspi-
rations and admirable courage, was to the
world at large notoriously unamiable.
Everything Nellie Stewart says has been said
by the few who had intimate business rela-
tions with him. His wmrd was his bond.
His enthusiasm was fine. But to the reader
who knew Musgrove only superficially, or
by unkind rumor, Nellie Stewart’s testi-
mony will seem unduly partial.
In humor, and anecdotal discursiveness,
“My Life’s Story” is deficient. The narrator
has no memory for incidents that make good
yarns. She lacks the journalistic instinct.
She might have made 20 or 50 digressions
from the path of purely theatrical interest,
but : had not collected the material. She tells
a good story touching W. S. Gilbert’s incon-
siderate treatment of Alfred Collier in his
composition of “The Mountebanks” score,
but she makes no reference to the circum-
stance that her wonderful debut as an actress
in drama stands recorded in the Racing
Calendar by the victory of Sweet Nell m
the Caulfield Cup. Nothing in her career
was more remarkable than her singing of a
Memorial Ode, composed by Charles Ken-
ningham, at the State Concert given in Mel-
bourne Exhibition Building to the Duke and
Duchess of York. Nellie Stewart refers to
it, as does Gustave Slapoffski, in his inter-
polated contribution to the Story, but not
enough is made of the achievement. Her
hard-worked singing voice was in its decline
at the beginning of the present century. On
the same platform with her were Ella Rus-
sell, a famous American prima-donna,
Antonia Dolores, and other “classy” vocal-
ists ; yet it was Nellie Stewart who scored
the big success, singing as she had never sung
before, nor ever sang afterwards. She was
the versatile artist on her mettle, rising to
the occasion. Nellie Stewart’s distinguish-
ing characteristic has been ever the deter-
mination to rise to the occasion. She was
the earnest, honest trier who always got
there.
Slapoffski, as was remarked just now, in-
terpolates his reminiscences of grand opera.
.Norman Campbell has a lot to tell about a
Musgrove tour. Nancye Stewart supple-
ments her mother’s praises of the generous-
hearted manager who has gone. The book
would have been all the better for the inclu-
sion of much of this extra matter in Nellie
Stewart’s own discourse. She is most inter-
esting when she is most personal, and one
feels that she could, an she would, have
been pungently querulous on the subject of
the firm which .1. C. Williamson formed after
his long partnership with Musgrove was
ended. As it is she contents herself with
reiterating the truth that Maggie Moore was
the founder of J. C. Williamson’s fortune.
Wherefore any booklet which ignores the
early helpmate of Musgrove’s former partner
is a contemptibly absurd publication. There
is no malice in Nellie Stewart’s tale of her
ups and downs under Musgrove’s optimistic
management. It leads one to the conclusion
that she is a good sort, who, like charity, has
suffered long and is kind.
EDMUND FISHER.
The Evolution of the Drama
The ordinary Briton regards the theatre
merely as a place of amusement, ignoring
the fact that the Drama is the source of all
literature. The earliest plays in Europe
were representations of the dramatic ele-
ments in Christian worship. The revival
of the religious sentiment —after the uni-
versal terror of the tenth century—was
sliowm by the illumination of missals, the
painting of windows, and the erection of
statues. When one of these “statues”
stepped towards the choir and they spoke a
sacred dialogue, the Christian Drama took
shape.
These liturgical dramas w r ere acted solely by
priests during “the period of faith and con-
templation” culminating in the thirteenth cen-
tury. At a representation of the Nativity
in Rouen Cathedral, children placed in the
arches represented the angels; a golden star
suspended by a string shone above the cradle,
and one of the Wise Men pointed with his
staff to the mysterious portent. “The
period of Dramatic Simplicity” opened with
“miracles” and lasted till the middle of the
sixteenth century. Little by little profane
elements began to mingle with the Christian
drama, which moved from the choir to the
porch, and from the porch to the market-
place, where merchants sold balms to anoint
the body of Christ. The representation
of a “Mystery” threw the whole town into
excitement. All the actors took part in a
public procession which delighted the crowd
and made the bosoms of the performers swell
with pride. In a Mystery of the Passion per-
formed at Metz in the fifteenth century, two
of the personages representing “God on the
Cross” and Judas nearly lost their lives
through a too-faithful adherence to their
respective roles, and had to be “rubbed with
vinegar.” A Mystery was not of necessity
a sacred theme: it might be historical, and
we find the Siege of Troy treading hard on
the Lives of the Saints, scenes from the Old
Testament and the Acts of the Apostles. In
the “Moralities” abstractions such as virtues
and vices were portrayed. Truth and Justice
accuse Adam, and Pity defends him. At
the May festivals, pastorals of Flora and
Robin and Maid Marion were enacted, and
there were conflicts between Winter and
Summer, and Wine and Water. Here we
find the intrusion of the comic element. In
a Christian drama of the thirteenth century a
pagan choir opposed the faithful in the fol-
lowing terms: “By the joy of Summer the
earth is made young; by the ardor of the
combat Venus is awakened; the flowers of
love smile in their season ; who can describe
the joy of the bridegroom who cherishes a
love that is pure and without venom?” Here
we find the profane drama taking precedence
of the sacred "theme.
In Spain, where all the superior,clergy were
French, the liturgical drama was introduced
with Roman rites. The “Mystery of the Three
Kings” was acted at Toledo. The Wise Men
were represented coming from different points
to inquire how a child can be both
human and divine. They offered mvrrh to
Humanity, gold to Royalty, incense to
Divinity, and judged Him by His choice.
Although a code issued by Alphonse for-
bade the clergy to frequent taverns and play
“mockeries,” they were allowed to perform
religious dramas displaying the Nativity and
the Resurrection. Spectacles and dances in
church were forbidden in the sixteenth cen-
tury. but a dance with castanets by children
still takes place six days after Corpus Christi
day in Seville Cathedral. The most ancient
Spanish drama was played before the Duke
of Alva. Two hermits and Veronica were
seen talking on their way to the holy sepul-
chre. Although the conception is touching,
the play is spoiled by too many puns, not
always in the best taste. There were also

Every day
with every weigh
I get closer and closer to an ideal figu: e
Correct diet has been my chief aid, but
I was only able to find what diet exactly
suited my case by weighing every day in
privacy on my own ASCO Personal
Weigher.
Here is a world-famed diet by which you
too should be able to reduce your weight;
it has been used with considerable suc-
cess by many doctors.
The "Banting” Diet.
BREAKFAST —4 to 5 ounces beef, mutton
kidneys, fish, bacon, or any meat except pork
1 cup of tea, 1 oz. of toast.
DINNER —5 to 6 ozs. lean meat or fish,
vegetables, 1 oz. dry toast. Any kind of fruit,
poultry and game. 2or three glasses of claret,
Madeira or sherry.
TEA —3 to 4 ozs. meat or fish, fruit, etc.
EXTRA-Cheese, Vichy or Spa waters, greens.
AVOID —Pastry, confectionery, sugar, starch
foods, potatoes or any vegetable which grows
underground or in the pod. Do not eat a late
supper since fat forms during sleep.
Diets act differently with many people.
In your case a slight moderation of
starchy foods, with a little more exercise
and fresh air, may cause you to lose
much weight.
This special "Asco” Personal Scale will
show you from day to day how different
diets and conditions affect you, and will
aid you to keep healthily and attractively
slim.

comic representations of Love and Politics,
and of Vegetables driving away Meat m
Lent.
The strange productions known as the
“Miracles of our Lady” show., the most
hideous crimes purified by the Virgin. As
time went on, the comic element became more
and more accentuated. Some of the “pleas-
antries” were very indecent. At last
matters reached such a pitch that these per-
formances were stopped in England by the
Parliament in 1548. This was largely due
to the influence of the Reformation.
The sixteenth century, which opens ‘ the
period of Faith and dramatic knowledge,” saw
the development of the classical theatre under
the form of sacred Tragedy, the most, remark-
able being the “Sacrifice of Abraham” by
Theodore de Beze. But the new departure
did not become essentially dramatic till the
influence of Spain made itself felt. In the
“Devotions of the Cross” we are shown a
bandit sullied by crime yet keeping a respect
for the Cross. Should he see it on the
breast of a priest lie is going to assassinate
or a woman he wishes to dishonor, he recoils.
Grace has touched him and he is saved!
About this time the religious drama appeared
to be a thing of the past : but 50 years later
came “Athalie,” the result of a well-known
crisis in Racine’s life, when, disgusted with
the theatre, he devoted himself to prayer,
meditation, and the study of the Scriptures.
The spring of action in “Athalie” is the most
powerful known to the theatre. It is the
research of a secret whose discovery must be
fatal to the seeker. This was the motive of
“CEdipus.” Racine shows himself the equal
of Sophocles by the simplicity of the action,
the splendor of the spectacle, and the lyric
elevation of the choir. His chief aim was to
show that God was the Deus ex machina of
human existence. The cry of Athalie,
u lmpitoyable Dieu, toi seul a tout conduit,”
is a hint to the spectators rather than a
defiance to the Almighty.
Here the religious drama ceases. We can-
not regard as anything but a spurious imita-
tion the revival of spiritual themes which
marked the movement known as neo-Plato-
nism or neo-Cliristianity in the early ’nineties.
The faithful worshippers who in the sixteenth
century crowded the churches to witness the
drama of the “Manger” were far removed
from the fashionable throng of literary and
artistic critics who applauded Maurice
Boucher’s “Noel,” played in Paris by sculp-
tured marionettes. A writer claims there is
still an evolution of the religious sentiment
to be expressed in the theatre —the love of
humanity. .Escliylus has shown Prometheus
nailed on his rock for humanity. May not
the dramatic gift of the twentieth century
find its inspiration as of old in the Christian
“Mystery” of One nailed on a Cross by virtue
of His immense love and pity for mankind ?
L. BOGUE LUFEMAN.
Ballades and Why
Elsie Cole (R.P. 7/2/’24), in urging the
value of the ballade and its mates, quotes
chiefly from the writers of 30 years ago. At
that date there was a deliberate revival of
those old French forms by Henley, Austin
Dobson and the rest. My point is that since
that time the Troubadour forms have become
indigenous, especially the ballade, and have
not ceased to be used very freely, especially
in Australia. They have been employed as a
weapon of satire, as efficient and deadly as
a cartoon. They have served as a eurhythmic
exercise, by which a poet found his sea-legs
or showed that he had found them. Finally,
once in a way, as Elsie Cole suggests, but
extremely seldom, as I insist, they have
served, like any other poetic form, as a means
of personal expression.
The full exploration of the possibilities of
the ballade as a vessel of wrath was pro-
bably made by that animal which G.B.S. once
called the “Chesterbelloc.” In their review,
the New Witness, Belloc and Chesterton
and their camp-followers for many years
wrote ballades of everything they most en-
thusiastically hated. The refrain of one
sings itself into the heart:
Their souls are like a temperance hotel!
In Australia it is not surprising to find the
ballade very common. The standard of light
verse here is so very high that most of its
writers in The Bulletin could turn you a
ballade quite as easily as the fantastic
measures they invent and carry out so
cleanly. I would like to see still more of the
political ballades, though, and with more
venom in their satirical composition. In
a post-war world, painfully habituated to
restricted supplies of everything from sugar
to liberty, there is crying need of plentiful
satire.
So much for ballades written with the
eye on their purposeful contents. The men-
tion of Ezra Pound’s name reminds me that
when he first sprang upon the world with
his poems, fie carefully let it be known that
he had also written 300 sonnets and burnt
them. With this beau qeste in mind, the
public could read his poems in full confidence
that when he wrote a queer and wavering
line like
I am drawn back again to the kin of the spirit,
he meant it for a queer and wavering line:
for had he not been able to write 300 son-
nets just for practice? In the same way, I
think most competent, poets have, without
perhaps announcing it, written ballades.
They have made these castles of cards deli-
berately, three storeys and a turret, but
without caring to express anything seriously
felt. Their lines were indeed “all carved
out of the carver’s brain,” and that was all.
Sometimes one of these ballades turned out
to be well worth preserving as a piece of
occasional verse. I remember a brilliant
one by Frank Morton—one that, in his own
phrase, would be fit for any tinker’s wedding.
It was called a “Ballade of His Own Book-
fellows,” and gave a list from his crowded
shelves.. The babel of names fitted in like
a mosaic, and the refrain was:
These are worth while when all else is vain.
Sometimes, again, writers seem to have ex-
perimented for a moment with the ballade
to see.if, after all, nobody but Villon could
make it elastic and full. Bernard O’Dowd
indeed, once had an idea of challenging these
traditiona l and courtly forms as “old bottles”
<uh! filling each kind with the new winp of
revolution. A ballade he did in. thirmood.
making scorn of the cheerful-foolish sundial
that “only counts the sunny hours.” Later
on he wrote a chant royal, that big brother
of the ballade, with the refrain, “The rank-
ers of the Bottom Dog Brigade.” Furnley
Maurice, in something the same vein, but
with more whimsies, wrote, “El Gai Saber.”
a chant royal with double refrain, and with
a long extra stanza thrown in—thus break-
ing the rule only to make the task more
difficult. (For sustained technical agility
this feat compares with McKee Wright’s
“Crown of Sonnets.”) Among Australian
ballades worth keeping can be counted cer-
tain ballades of places by Elsie Cole, Marie
Pitt and A, T. Strong.
NETTIE PALMER.
Good Dogs and Naughty Geniuses
I have annoyed Jack Lindsay (almost I
had written of him as “Jacky” in envious
tribute to his glorious youth) by a
platitude: that a dog may be more admir-
able on the moral side than a man. No one
but a blind devotee of that silliest of super-
stitions, anthropolatry, would question it. I
was not influenced by “the outburst of a
subconscious strata [sic] of rage” in citing
Puddifoot as an example of sex obsession.
Puddifoot has some creative ability, doubt-
less, even though it does not approach that
which was owned by so splendid a moron
as Villon. My point was that any human
being, genius or fool, who grows so pre-
occupied with sex as to disown all else
as subjects for art or human interest is in
danger; and that the dullest dog, to the
extent that he has no such craze, is a better
and more balanced animal than the brainiest
man. As an odd example of historical igno-
rance and muddled thought I take this pas-
sage from “Two Heretics of St. Venus”
(R.P. 21/2/’24) :
Can he t i.e., myself] really believe that the auto-
matic aberrations of a moron have any relation
whatever to the disciplined power to react to “an
emotion of loveliness” ? Does he really think that
Sappho, Praxiteles, Titian, Shakspeare, Rubens, Burns,
Byron, Beethoven, Wagner and Rodin (to take only
the most significant names) were “weaklings,” liable
at any time to commit rape?
The lives of most of the unhappy beings on
this list supply as good a proof as could be
desired of my contention. Sappho’s name,
and that of her birthplace, stand for a
sexual aberration as unpleasant as Sadism.
R.L.S., in a sympathetic study of his fellow-
countryman Burns, remarked :
He who had once refused the invitations of lords
and ladies is now whistled to the inn by any curious
stranger. His death in his 37th year was indeed
a kindly dispensation. It is the fashion to say he
died of drink, and that drink and debauchery helped
to destroy his constitution, and were the means of
his unconscious suicide, is doubtless true.
The recently-published Lovelace papers leave
no doubt that Byron was guilty of incest—
“the moron’s crime,” as village lawyers call
it. Beethoven was a syphilitic, and Rodin
to the end of his life was an embarrassment
to the Parisian authorities. No child was
safe with him. In brief, the greatest of men
are often hopeless moral weaklings, liable
like Leonardo, Michelangelo and a hundred
others who might readily be named to sink
to ruinous depths of depravity. To state it
is not to betray “a subconscious strata of
rage against all passionate beauty”: it is
to be honest with the facts of life. Jack
Lindsay is exasperated at such plain speak-
ing because, in the present stage of his men-
tal development, he is not honest. He
writes of Greece, whose shores he has not
visited, and ignores the incomparably more
beautiful coasts of his own country. When
he wishes to image beauty he turns from the
beauty which is around him to a Titian
which he has never seen; and, on being chal-
lenged, explains that he saw a reproduction
of the work —“nearer to the original than a
gramophone record of its!” He is the intel-
lectual counterpart of the tiresome Austra-
lian native who, without having been outside
Australia, talks of England as “Home,” and
whose eyes are ever turned in yearning
admiration to London. When he gets over
this phase; when he learns humility and the
difficult art of clear expression; above all,
when he appreciates that preoccupations re-
garding naked girls (and the hideous
sequelae of such pre-occupations) are
the deplorable accidents and not the
inevitable attributes of genius—when all
those things happen, then Jack Lind-
say should do something of value. For
behind his wordiness, his boyish pomposity
and arrogance, and his classical references
which smell so stale, to us who remember the
shoddy Greek apostles of the ’nineties, he is
a very clever young man indeed.
HENRI SINGEMOINE.
Jack and Beethoven
I would like to ask Mr. Jack Lindsay what
Beethoven has to do with “the laughing
dance of naked girls.” Like most people
who don’t understand the aim and scope of
music, Mr. Lindsay fits the musician’s pur-
pose to his own ideas. Beethoven’s deepest
motive was the religious. If Mr. Lindsay
reads his letters he will not find naked girls
or Bacchus or nymphs and fauns mentioned
or indicated; and, after all, a man’s letters
are a close index of his mind. He was
probably far more preoccupied with the sheer
mechanics of the Third Symphony than with
its spiritual significance. It is notable that
nowhere in his letters does he burble about
the “meaning” of the pictures in his music.
He had no literary sense, he was only a poor
devil of a creator, and he left it to others,
without any real idea of the difference
between fugue and canon, or the Lydian and
harmonic minor, to attempt to explain his
highly technical art by phrases about laugh-
ing dances and naked girls.
When Mr. Lindsay’s whiskers become
streaked with grev he will perhaps not dog-
matise so youthfully, and will appreciate the
fact that to the artist —of any kind—the busi-
ness of creation is “1 per cent, inspiration
and 99 per cent, perspiration,” and that the
creator is usually less preoccupied during his
job with the subject itself than with the
sheer pleasure of workmanship. Beethoven
is great not merely because he was a tragic
literary figure, but because of the beauty of
his tunes, his mastery of counterpoint and
harmony, and his architectural conception of
the possibilities of the sonata form. Behind
that skill was a deeply religious and emo-
tional brain, a brain which loved .peace and
order and worship—and all the things which
a bacchanal is not.

The Last Library
You who remain at last standing upon the
earth or suspended like a cloud in the buoy-
ancy of accumulated human thought, listen
to me for a moment.
Perhaps you will have overcome pain of
feeling and woe of change, become free of
the body, master of distance and lord of all
knowledge between the stars; perhaps life
and death will be to you but as a rhythm
of greater breathing, and light and darkness
as a pulse of the spirit’s blood. Yet, as
you walk over the stones of grey cities and
the dead fields men ploughed with sweat and
toil, you may yet feel an earth-hunger for
something lost—a music more precious than
wings, a desire sweeter than all realisation.
Go back, then, to the worn brown books
under the dust and the spider-webs, and
read between the books and under the
books the things that men eager with
life and heavy for death had in them
to sing but never sang. If you can
read this language, as perhaps you may, you
will come suddenly back to the garden, to
weary limbs and tired eyes and fear and
death and pain, but you will feel the morning
unutterable and the evening too exquisite for
words. Even to-day, under the wheels, we
dream Sappho and breathe Orpheus and
thrill to the unknown, unheard Amergin.
How much more you, far above the wheels,
will feel the songs left unsung by Milton and
Keats and a man called Jones! And if you
make an anthology of these things, faithfully
covering the years, the whole world w r ill be
a little book easily carried by the youngest
and most omniscient god.

A Satchel of Books
The Joyous Adventurer, by Ada Barnett (Allen
and Unwin). It has the freshness of the Sussex
Downs, in which much of the story is laid. The
writer has the knack of peopling her world with
pleasant folks, and the nicest of all is the old Pro-
fessor who from his beloved woods and streams
receives the gift his soul craves—a son and a com-
rade.
The End of All Dreams, by Pamela Hinkson (Fisher
Unwin). A first novel and a good one—-a fine
study of the agony of mind of a young Irishman who
went through the awful four years between the end
of the Great War —in which he fought—and the
arrival of the Free State. There is more thought in
The End of All Dreams than in a half-dozen average
novels of the day; yet the story is never overlaid.
Streams of Ocean, by Aubrey de Selincourt (Heine-
mann). A little volume of discursive essays and
dawdling papers, some of them already published in
the Manchester Guardian, and in the Manchester
Guardian manner—which is to say, above all
idealistic. What, for instance, is the purpose of
education? “True education is. .. .valuable only in
so far as it forms a child’s mind to habits of com-
passion and humility, and leads it as far as may be
to an habitual sensitiveness to the inner spiritual
meaning of beautiful things.” Though you know it
is nonsense you have a suspicion that it is a very
likeable old gentleman who wrote it. But it is
not all like that: there is plenty of hard common-
sense in “On Second-hand Knowledge,” for instance.
Fiery Particles, by O. E. Montague (Chatto and
Windus). This author takes a high place among
the tellers of the short story on the strength of
“Another Temple Gone!” Like all the rest that the
volume contains, it has the distinction of a new man-
ner and a fine, rippling humor. And the tale itself
is fascinating. If the rest of the book is not up to
the level of its first tale, it is none the less delight-
ful. Ho more joyful and laughable satire on the
way in which the late war was conducted has
appeared than “Honors Easy”; and while there is
much variety in the other stories, they are all pre-
sented in the same pleasant way. Montague is in a
sense a word-spinner. He does not take the shortest
road to clear expression, but , arrives at it by curious
zig-zag tracks that make it all the clearer in the
end and gathers a smile on the passage.
The Dancing Star, by Berta Ruck (Hodder and
Stoughton). A story written in the style of the
new journalism, which is a matter mostly of yelps.
Something like this: —
“Two men sat on a log.
“It was a morning in early June and the cucumbers
were still green.
“Suddenly there Was a little scream —was it sur-
prise, was it delight ?
“ ‘lt was quite easy, after all,’ said Timotheus
Preservus; ‘I think almost anybody could do it
with practice.’
“The face of Claudius Godelpus registered resolu-
tion.
“ ‘lf I cannot be the first to do it,’ said he, 1
will be the second, or my widow shall collect my
life assurance.’
“Knitting his brow, he lurched forward.
“Five seconds passed.
“Ten seconds passed. ,
“Eleven seconds passed.
“Then his companion shook his hand warmly.
“‘Magnificent!’ he said.
“They had now both fallen off the log!”
For the rest, Miss (or Mrs.) Ruck’s story is about
a dancing-girl who wins fame in a breathless moment,
and marries the right man after nearly making a
mess of it with the wrong one. A story so modern
that 20 years ago looks like the Dark Ages; so
modern that the tremendous hero gets his living by
riding in motor-bike tests.
Playwrights on Playmaking and Other Studies of
the Stage, by Brander Matthews (Scribner’s). The
trouble with the learned Professor Matthews is that
his scholarship has been nourished at the expense of
his critical faculty. He is well grounded in the
literature of the theatre from zEschylus onward, but
one can search his volume for an original observation
that is not challengeable or absurd. The character
of his argument is shown by an allusion to “La
Dame aux Camelias,” which “must have had a solidity
of its own, and even a certain sincerity of a kind,
because it kept the stage for threescore years and
ten.” So “Uncle Torres Cabin” is a masterpiece,
and manv worthy efforts like Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna
Christie,” Schnitzler’s “Reigen” and Hauptmann’s
“Weavers,” which have had no box-office success,
are poor things. In reminiscent vein Professor
Matthews is more interesting, and' his talks on old
actors and old theatres covering half a century of
memories will make one forgive him even for the
profoundly unconvincing reasons why Mark Twain
failed to become a dramatist.
<►- — .
“Wilfrido”: The new collected edition of Lafcadio
Hearn reminds me that he was once an applicant for
the professorship of English at Victoria Uni. (M.L.).
Although he failed to land the job, he held for a
number of years at the Tokio University the one’
that Robert Nichols has now. Hearn was born at
Leucadia, one of the lonian Islands, hence the Greek
forename. His father was an Irishman and his
mother a Greek, who nursed her husband when her
brothers, not favoring his suit, stabbed him. Lafca-
dio was educated with Francis Thompson, the poet,
at Ushaw, in Durham ; but he jibbed at the priest-
hood, and at 19 landed in America without a penny.
From there he went to Japan via the West Indies.


NEW EDISON
triumbhs in amazing test
Stella Power’s voice matched perfectly.
On February 7 over a thousand music lovers crowded to the Masonic Hall, Melbourne, to hear Miss Stella Power. On
bare stage the artist stood and sang beside the phonograph. Read what the papers said:
“When Miss Stella Power was singing ‘The Cuckoo’ (Lehmann) the
lights were lowered and she escaped from the stage. But her voice was
heard to the end. . . .it was a puzzle to know when she left the stage. .. .
no more exacting test could have been given.”
—Melbourne Hebaxd.
“....a notable success.... Gounod’s ‘Serenade’ showed admirably
the degree of perfection... .the Edison Company proved the complete
confidence it has in its productions.”
—Melbourne Argus.
“Miss Power would sing one phrase, the machine would
with another. .. .were mystified as to when Miss Power was
singing in Henschel’s ‘One Spring Morning,’ so close was the
mation.”
—Melbourne
“Miss Power would sing.... and then the phonograph..,
the audience sat puzzled but critical, then applause broke \
and spontaneously.”

Oakland 6
These natives were found lost and starving in the
Karoo Desert of South Africa. The Oakland,
carrying the rescue party, stood the test of 2000
miles through desert and forest and intense heat.
Oakland
the first low-priced
six-cylinder motor car
THE first Oakland was built to
answer the demand of motor-
ists for a six-cylinder motor car
which could be purchased at a low
price and which would be economi-
cal to operate. ~
That task successfully fulfilled, the
builders of Oakland each year have
sought to make the finest “light six”
that engineering talent, modern ma-
chinery and ample financial resources
could produce.
Today Oakland’s reputation is inter-
national. Across the deserts of Asia
and the veldt of Africa, over the
boulder-strewn passes of the Andes,
through the bush of Australia —wher-
ever the going calls for sturdy con-
struction and faithful service—Oak-
lands are upholding the tradition of
the first of their name.
* * * *
Motorists have a double sense of
security in the purchase of the new
Oakland. The company which builds
it is a division of General Motors, the
largest automotive organization in the
world.
Uniting the resources of many com*
panies which are building fine motor
cars and making parts, accessories,
and equipment, General Motors
gives to Oakland the economies of
great purchasing power and stand-
ardization, plus the financial strength
of all its divisions.

Far from this dull street;
And ah! what sheer gladness
To feel ’neatli my feet
The touch of kind grasses;
And this you must know
We’ve seven stars to guide us
The way we would go.
Our way is a bright one,
’Tis through a green door;
No mortal has ever
Passed our way before.
“ ’Tis my way and your way,”
The wind said to me,
“For you are a vagrant—
That’s how it should be.”
So my way is this way,
The w y ay the wind Mows;
For ah! I must follow
Wherever lie goes.

The Waterfall.
Never was a scene more fair
Than this woodland waterfall;
Hither comes no thought of care,
Ne’er a sorrow-shape at all ;
Honeybirds in quest of honey
Plunder bloom and bud at leisure,
Pausing now and then on sunny
Sprays to carol forth their pleasure.
Down the rocks the waters glide
Gleaming, glancing merrily;
Golden mosses at each side,
Fern and bracken, flower and tree.
Far ahead they hear their river,
And they hasten at her calling.
All day long and night-long ever,
Sing the silver waters falling.
What is best for such a scene?
Dreams arc best—to lie and muse;
Mean it were, and more than mean,
Such a moment to refuse!
Underneath green leaves a-glisten,
Shine and shadow round me flinging,
Sweet, O sweet it is to listen
To the silver waters singing!

The Dividing of Earth.
(AFTER SCHILLER.)
“Take, take tlie Earth!” cried Zeus from his
high heaven
To new-made men —“Yours shall she ever
be.
I give her you, her joys and sorrow's leaven;
But see you live thereon in unity!”
Then ran each man to seize his portion
straightway;
In eager flight competed young and old.
The peasant closed the field with fence and
gateway,
The huntsman sought his prey on hill and
wold.
His stores to overflowing filled the trader;
The churchman chose the noble sparkling
wine;
The king taxed all—a gallant, royal raider —
And said. “The tithe of these things shall
be mine!”
Alas! When all good things had been
divided
Late came the poet from his wandering
far
To find, by crooked fate delayed, misguided,
That all the gifts were under lock and bar.
“Woe, woe is me! Ah, what was my de-
merit” — ,
So rose his cry—“that thou thy loyal son,
O Zeus, shouldst in this fashion disinherit
And leave him giftless— him, the only
one ?”
“If thou didst in the land of dreaming dally,”
Replied the god, “O minstrel, blame not
me! , ,
Where wast thou when I gave up hill and
valley?”
“O Zeus, 1 ever lingered near to thee.
“My eye hung on thy brow sublime with
rapture, . _
My ear drank in with joy Olympian song.
Forgive me if my share I failed to capture
Because before thy throne I stayed too
long.”
“What can we do?” cried Zeus. “The
Earth’s bereft us.
The field, the chase, the mart are mine
no more!
But stay! This heaven, my son, at least is
left us. , ,
Come when thou wilt; here stands an
open door!”

BORROW GAILY, FATHER WILL
PAY.
Till within the past year or two the Aus-
tralian press had scarcely begun to get the
habit of assuring all whom it might concern
that, at the worst, the credit of the Empire
is behind that of Australia, wherefore the
ship can’t really sink. Thirteen years ago,
when the State or peace debts were half
what they are, and the interest bill was one-
tliird what it is going to be very shortly,
the habit wasn’t thought of at all. There
was no “worst” in the national vocabulary
then. Now the scene is changed, and such
lucubrations as the following, hacked out of
the leading article of a “great” and ortho-
dox Sydney daily (26/2/’24), is as common
as a bottle-throwing push outrage, and more
common than the discovery of a dead family
of small children :
Mr. Theodore, while in New York, announced
his personal conviction that London financiers will
underwrite the conversion loans now outstanding in
spite of the feelings raised by his unhappv method
of dealing with State obligations. It would be most
unfortunate were his endeavors to convert Queens-
land’s loans to meet with failure in London. Such
a thing as the partial bankruptcy of an Australian
State could not be allowed by the Commonwealth,
which would be compelled to intervene by accepting
the obligations of Queensland with regard to the
loans falling due this year and next year.... The
excitable ex-Agent-General for Queensland... .did not
improve the position by telling the Australian Press
Association that “those who insist on talking re-
pudiation may get a real lesson in repudiation in
regard to loan renewals.” It is not in the power of
any Australian State to repudiate. The credit of all
the States, separately or collectively, is an ultimate
obligation of the Commonwealth. Further, the
credit of an Australian State is an obligation of the
Umpire. ...The keen financiers of Wall-street know
quite well where to look in the last resort for the
money they may lend to Queensland.
It suggests a boy with a dubious past whist-
ling among the moonlit tombstones to keep
off ghosts.
» * # *
The matter goes into a compact series of
propositions. Each State is liable for the debts
of all local bodies within its area. That is
not unreasonable, seeing that it can control
their extravagance. The Commonwealth is
allegedly liable for State liabilities, in-
cluding those of local bodies which have tot-
tered back on the State, though it has never
found out how to supervise their borrowings.
The theory is that it has its name auto-
matically on the back of any lOU which
any State likes to give, in consequence of
which any State can float many more
lOU’s than would be otherwise possible.
In addition, it has become an unwritten
law that the Commonwealth should raise
the wind in times of stress, and lend the pro-
ceeds to the States. (Whether the Common-
wealth is also responsible for the liabilities
of banks, which it ought to control and
supervise but doesn’t, is another branch of
the subject, and one which should be looked
into.) Finally, and in the last resort, accord-
ing to the theory of the endless chain of
responsibility, the Empire is liable for the
lot. No one has asked its permission to put
its name on the back of the bill. No one
has had the ineffable cheek to tell the Empire
that its name has been put there. The
Empire is a big affair, including a multitude
of States, some of them rather huffy about
their dignity, and if the news was conveyed
to Canada, Newfoundland, South Africa,
India (which now has a Parliament of its
own, and the huffiest of all). Maoriland
(which stands on high stilts upon occa-
sion). and the Leeward Isles that they
would be called on to pay their bit as a
matter of honor should Theodore, of Queens-
land, default, the messenger might not get
away alive. Even the Irish Free State,
despite its monumental patience, might say
things in haste, and not repent at leisure.
And if Prime Minister Bruce was told that
the Irish Free State or Newfoundland and
Labrador had gone broke, that the Empire
had to take up its liabilities lest the Empire
should be discredited, and that Australia’s
share was so much, even his well-tailored
affability might desert him.
* * * *
On the other hand, when it is said, many
times and in many ways, that “the credit of
an Australian State is an obligation
of the Empire,’’ it may be simply
meant that it is an obligation of the
United Kingdom, which is now England,
Scotland, Wales and a scrap of Ireland.
But that would make the matter worse. To
assume single-handed responsibility for one
debt would involve, by the establishment of
a precedent, assuming responsibility for all,
whenever a dependency cared to profess itself
in difficulties. There are in Greater Britain
a hundred or so of different debts in the
present, not counting municipal liabilities,
and there are unlimited possibilities in the
future. The Old .Man in London might not
think the fantastical point of honor worth
such unlimited chances. In one of Thack-
eray s tales the leading character was pic-
turesque and financially used up, just like
Theodore, and he likewise put it to the Old
Man (the Earl of Crabs ) that the situation
was now in his hands. The reply was to
the general effect that the situation might
fry in Topliet, and that the owner of it
was welcome to sizzle in the depths of im-
pecuniosity until the- end of all things, and
after. The Earl continued to prosper de-
spite the blow to the family credit, but the
last appearance of the superb Hon. Alger-
non Deuceace was as a Domain loafer, who
had lost one hand (his card-sharping hand)
in a duel, and was hitting his deformed wife
with the other. The covert assurance that
any Australian State may borrow itself into
an insolvent condition with complete safety
because the ancient parent must pay (that
unspeakable meanness is pot put into words,
but it is clearly implied) should be read in
the light of this and similar cases in which
the prodigal brought his debts home, and
had them rejected. The parent doesn’t
always take his son’s view of parental re-
sponsibility.
* * * *
It is provided in the Australian Consti-
tution (Clause 96) : 0;
During a period of 10 years after the establish-
ment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until
the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament
may grant financial assistance to any State ■on
such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks
fit.
So far all the States have been helped with
loans, and Westralia has had a costly fail-
way built for its particular benefit, though
these matters hardly come within the limits
of Clause 96. But two States (Tasmania
and Westralia) have received large aids
which assuredly come within the meaning of
the clause, and both have asked for more.
Ihe help was given without any terms or
conditions, which was a misfortune, for not
only has it been forgotten that such things
are in the bargain, but a legend is being
festered that, the Commonwealth is bound
to give unlimited aid at a crisis, and ask
few or no questions. If the Parliament is
to help largely, as itwill apparently be ex-
pected to do in the unpromising future, it
should make up its mind to exact corres-
ponding reforms and guarantees, as security
that the crisis won’t become an annual in-
stitution. Concessions, that might reason-
ably be suggested are such as these:—
That the embarrassed State shall borrow no more
except through the Federal Parliament, with its
permission, and for purposes which it approves.
Borrowing to be limited, so that the debt per head
will gradually diminish, and the Federal supervision
to cease when the liability gets down to a fixed
figure—possibly £5O per head or less. This would
in no way hinder the execution of works out of
land or other revenue.
That the embarrassed State, on being relieved of
its embarrassment, shall establish a satisfactory
sinking fund in the hands of approved trustees, as
security for the future.
That, in the case of a State of excessive- size,
which always implies excessive cost of government
and consequent financial difficulties, the bankrupt
shall consent to a subdivision.
Possibly also the State might be invited to
re-model its Constitution, with a view to
better administration in the future. Some
ragged but truculent Cabinet might take up
the attitude that beggars should dictate their
own terms. But even the loftiest attitude
may wear thin, and the mendicant on the
highest horse may dismount in time.
THE CHARITY THAT IS UNKIND.
British communities have a ruinous habit
of clinging to ancient institutions long after
they have fallen to decay, and a glaring case
in point is the voluntary hospital system.
During the World War a citizen who sug-
gested leaving the care of the sick and
wounded soldiery to the hazard of charity
would have been regarded as a lunatic or a
traitor. It was well understood that the
life of the Empire depended on the health
of its armies. But with the return of peace
the old fictions reappeared, and notably the
axiom that there is something morally repre-
hensible, if not actually un-Christian, in look-
ing after the public health in a systematised
and business-like manner. The notion dates
from the Dark Ages, when practically the
only hospital work that Europe knew was
done by the Church. The tradition of the
blessedness of charity was passed on through
the hands of England’s Lady Bountifuls,
with their gifts of fruit and jelly to con-
sumptive or cancerous villagers, to Australia’s
organisers of hospital balls and fetes —to the
edification often of the thoughtless multitude,
but greatly to the detriment of the ailing
poor. No country trusts its people to re-
frain from crime, resist the temptation to
smuggle dutiable goods, voluntarily pay income-
taxes, or otherwise behave as though the Mil-
lennium had arrived. There are some, it
goes without saying, in every community who
might safely be trusted not to steal, smuggle
or cheat an income-tax commissioner, but
they are few in number, and observation
and statistics show that it is the same as
regards the upkeep of the nation’s hospitals.
Thousands who ought to pay contribute little
or nothing ; and because of that evasion other
thousands feel it incumbent upon them to
pay far more than their fair share.
* * # *•
In spite of these sacrifices, it is often impos-
sible to collect the required amount. In
Victoria, for example, there is a permanent
army of about 500 patients (at the begin-
ning of the year it was over 600) awaiting
hospital treatment, and unable to get it owing
to the chronic shortage of beds. Add to this
list the unfortunates, probably numbering
thousands, who are neither poor enough to
be admissible to a public hospital nor rich
enough to be able to pay their way at a
private hospital, and a tremendous tally of
unavoidable suffering is arrived at. Victoria
is the Commonwealth’s horrible example;
but in every State, as surely as an epidemic
appears, the entire voluntary system col-
lapses in the same way as law and order
would collapse in a great city if it had only
a voluntary police force to confront an in-
vasion of inter-State criminals. It is a con-
dition of affairs almost as calamitous—the
humanitarian aspect apart—as it would
have been in the war if the armies had
omitted to establish C.C.S.’s; and clearly
also, like the establishment of C.C.S.’s,
the root of the problem is not vague
idealism but hard business. A section of
the Victorian Railways Union showed its
appreciation of this truth a few days ago
in a practical fashion. It proposed that
each railway employee should pay £1 per
annum to the Bendigo Hospital in return
for hospital treatment for himself and his
dependants. And the Argus stated the usual
case against the scheme: —
One inevitable result of systematising* charity is to
stifle it. When a unionist or anyone else gives some-
thing in expectation of receiving an equivalent in
return, he is not exercising charity. He may be dis-
playing prudence, but only in the most general way
are hospitals maintained for prudential reasons. After
all, charity is the best of all mutual benefits,
although it has become a fashion to denounce charity
as if it were not a virtue but one of the deadly sins.
'\s£ v * * * '
Now, no responsible person has denounced
charity, to The Bulletin’s knowledge; the
complaint from which the hospitals, and
through them the nation, are suffering, is lack
of charity. N. S. Wales, which has more beds
in proportion to population than any other
State, is periodically forced to turn patients
away who, while not destitute, are far from
being in a financial position to buy treat-
ment at private hospitals. The public is
continually being implored to pay up—by
art-union organisers', by ball, jazz, theatrical
and vaudeville-promoters, by committees of
K.B.E.’s, politicians and similar public char-
acters, and by the heads of all the churches
-—and yet the responses are so faint that
some of the biggest of the metropolitan hos-
pitals are on the verge of bankruptcy. Is
there any prospect of this position being bet-
tered, any hope that those with money to
spare will experience a sudden change of
heart, and not only provide enough to main-
tain the hospitals free of debt but add to
their beds and equipment as increases in the
population demand? An honest observer
must admit that there is no such hope. The
position—never satisfactory at any time-
lias changed greatly for the worse with tlie
rise of Labor, and its effects in raised wages,
shortened hours and increased taxation.
There are few charity-collectors who have
not been rebuffed with some such remark as:
“Labor makes me pay through the nose.
Why should I give to hospitals that are
frequented chiefly by the workers?” And
at the same time the costs of maintaining
hospitals have risen. Instead of bleating
about “all members of the community sup-
porting existing hospitals” on a charity basis,
a sensible State will cast about it for a
scheme ensuring hospital attention for every-
one in need of it. To remove hospitals from
utter dependence on charity will not kill
charity any more than the removal of the
care of sick soldiers killed charity. There
was still plenty for charity to do among the
soldiers; there will still be plenty for it to
do among the sick-poor when the mainten-
ance of enough hospitals to attend to all who
need them is taken out of charity’s uncertain
hands. From its very nature its hands must
be uncertain. There can be no compulsion
about charity. There can therefore be no
guaranteeing of results. Once, then, it is •
admitted that a twentieth-century community
is definitely required to provide sufficient
hospital accommodation for its sick, eharity
is ruled out as the agent in that matter, since,
as we have seen, it cannot definitely under-
take to do anything. And when it insists
upon attempting to do something which from
its very nature it is unfitted to do, and must
hirgely fail in doing, charity ceases to be
kmd ; and then it ceases to be charity.
THE COW AND THE LAW.
Since two bulls and five cows arrived in
Australia with the First Fleet and were
loosed in Sydney in January, 17S8, horned
cattle have been the cause of ■so vast an
amount of legislation, litigation and crime
that no wonder harmless, necessary Straw-
berry is now given to rumination.
She got a bad start in a bad school. The
first batch to arrive—bulls and cows—
escaped into the bush, through the
negligence of a convict in charge of them,
and the last of them were not discovered for
over 10 years. They had settled down, and
raised a numerous progeny, in what came to
be known as “the cow pastures,” a well-
grassed tract of land along the base of the
then un penetrated mountains, and watered
by the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers. Of
course, the cattle had become wild, and the
first extension of law was to protect them;
to capture or kill them was made punish-
able by death. Death with a hangman’s noose
in his hand stalked the land very briskly in
those days. In 1812 no less than 14 men
and women were convicted of stealing or
receiving cattle. Of these two were executed
and the remainder sentenced for periods of
seven to fourteen years’ transportation to the
Coal River, now known as Newcastle. Right
down the years, commencing with this period
when the beasts were few and the need to
multiply them great, cattle-stealing has been
regarded as a most serious offence.
The bullock was quite early in his history
put into servitude, and there he has remained
ever since, a useful but blasphemy-inciting
animal. He helped to make the convict
roads, was often seen in the shafts of a cart
this even in Sydney-—was used as a pack
beast, drew the plough ; in S. Australia, at-
tached to a light cart, pulled one of the
pioneer parsons from preaching-place to
preaching-place ; and in his old age made beef
for fiis master’s table. May we all have as
useful a career!
The cow came more to town, as befitted
her gentler sex. She was relieved from
strenuous toil and stimulated to milk-giving,
But though her lines were cast in relatively
pleasant places she has been regulated by
law and ordinance far more stringently than
her brother, and suffers many penalties
vicariously through her master. If she strays
on the highway he pays ; if she is a “poor
milker” or is off color through the scantiness
of feed, he is punished for “adulterating”
her milk —a distinction between fact and
legal fiction which he rarely grasps. Her
calves are a fertile source of litigation, and
as the devourer of honest men’s gardens she
is accursed. The owner of a cow is an
anxious man. He is cow-tied, and cow-care
is written on his face. For him all time is
indicated by two diurnal milkings; and there
is no Sabbath observance for either him oi-
lier. If he own many cows his wife must
bear him a numerous progeny—the cows de-
mand it. His children are care-worn early
in life by the excess of cow duties, from
which only the blessed intervention of measles
or other epidemic can relieve them. The
cow is a dictator greater than Trotsky.
Whether she wall remain so time only can
tell. For though it is years since they heart-
ened us with the assurance that the milking-
machine had been at last perfected, it makes
its way into the sheds with exasperating
slowness.
Before the country police-magistrate come
many pleas in the matter ;of the cow: that
the said cow was naturally of a mild and
inoffensive nature, but was led astray by
evil companions, to wit, a neighbor’s cows;
that another said cow was subject to fits of
turbulence, and at such times broke bounds
despite the most vigilant precautions; that
still another said cow was wickedly and
wantonly led, induced and surprised into acts
of lawlessness by some person unknown, and
the gate of a certain garden- -to wit, that of
one .Tones —being by him left negligently
open, the contents of the said garden, that
is to say 40 cabbages—and so on —were
innocently eaten by the said -how. The cow
is also frequently brought before liis Wor-
ship’s notice as an opprobrious epithet—
is known broadly to the police as “language."
On the other hand, in cow-obsessed dis-
tricts, tln* animal is used for spiritual pur-
poses, as a sort of familiar urge to the better
life. Hence a notice posted in front of a
Hawkesbury chapel: “All invited. Stirring
spiritual address, ‘The Red Heifer.’ ”
Country solicitors are well acquainted with
the Cow, and easily dfetingush her from
Marie Corelli's “bulMieifer.” They spill
much eloquence over the aninial, and fight
fierce forensic battles over her identity. “The
whole issue before your Worships,” said one
such advocate, “is the identity of this cow.
Many witnesses have been? called on both
sides; but I submit tlis||Court will set aside
the mass of detail, and concentrate' itself
upon one essential fact proved beyond doubt
this cow was ear-marked when my client
bought her, and the cow in court bears that
ear-mark, as your Worships have seen. The
Court need not, therefore, have regard to
other marks and indicia, such as long or
short legs, cloven teats, lips, horns or color.
About these irrelevant things the Court need
not trouble its head, if it may rightly be
said that the Court has a head.” And at
this point the sergeant had to call for order.
But it is the milkman, a little higher than
the cow and a little lower than the publican,
who appeals most to our sympathy. The cow
trats the milkman abominably. Out of sheer
cussedness she drinks water into her milk;
and she fraudulently secretes fats, as the
analyst terms them, about her person in-
stead of depositing them in her milk, as the
law requires. She eats non-succulent food,
contracts coughs, catarrhs and divers epi-
demics ; puts “blue” in her milk, and, to
sum up, “adulterates” her milk most shame-
fully. Always the innocent milkman has to
pay the penalty. The malevolence shown by
the cow to the milkman is beyond woi-ds.
Then there is the pathetic case of the poor
but honest cow-owner, who keeps the animal
in a paddock, or sometimes a back yard,
where, apparently, she is fed by the ravens
who come from the green lanes hard by. But


despite the paddock and the ravens she will
stray, will eat up gardens, trample down cab-
bages and refuse to go to the pound when
the inspector endeavors to drive her there.
This inspector is generally an inspector of
nuisances, and obviously the cow comes
under his jurisdiction. He is also generally
an exacting man who has no cow of his own.
Amiable cows with the highest credentials
are dealt with unflinchingly by this instru-
ment of Local Government.
Vendors of milk have to be licensed, and
with the license in his hand, and a code of
regulations to study, comes a new crop of
troubles to the cow-owner. No longer may
he put her in any old place to milk her.
Henceforth she must have an apartment
dazzling to the eye with limewash. No longer
the odors of past generations of cows, the
picturesque festoons of cobwebs; no longer
may she be milked standing in mud and
manure. She must place her dainty feet on
a well-drained concrete floor, and refrain
from swishing her tail in the milk.
Her bellowing may be a nuisance under
a Local Government ordinance, even as the
crowing of the cock; and when in despera-
tion lie proceeds to be rid of her, he will
find that she may not be “driven” through
the streets of his suburb, and whether or
no she will lead he has no knowledge. On
the whole issue, he who contemplates the
buying of a cow should think twice and think
slowly, unless he occupy the wide-open places
of the earth.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
One-Way Traffic in Gold.
The question is whether Australia is get-
ting the great advantage it ought to have
from its production of gold. All the world
has been struggling for years to acquire and to
hold this metal. Crossing over a border in
Europe even a man’s clothes are liable to
be searched lest he should have a few gold
pieces concealed about his person. An Aus-
tralian journalist passing through the U.S.A.
took an American gold-piece with him. ’ Pie
had to give it tip before he left New York,
and take silver or paper for it. Britain is
holding on hard to what she has. An Aus-
tralian firm wanting to make a payment in
London can get £lOO paid there by lodging
£99 in Sydney or Melbourne. This means
that Australian banks and others have a
great deal of money piled up in London and
can’t get it away; they, therefore, jump at
the chance of paying it away in London and
getting a somewhat less amount put to their
credit in Australia. Now, Australia is one
of the few producers in the world of this sub-
stance which is in such tremendous demand
—not a large producer now, but still a pro-
ducer of, say, Bi| millions’ worth a year.
This current output is exported, though the
country holds on to its old accumulation,
and it is understood that the community
should be glad right down to its boots be-
cause it gets £4 16s. or more per oz. instead
of about £3 19s. as in normal times. But
the proceeds don’t come to us in sovereigns,
or in redeemable paper with an international
circulation (no such thing exists yet). The
money merely stands to Australia’s credit,
like the proceeds of foreign loans, and can
be taken out in goods; and all these goods
tend to reduce Australia’s factories, and em-
ployment. and wage-earners, and taxpayers.
The question, therefore, arises whether the bit
of premium we get is anything like adequate
payment for the loss of the gold. The United
States, at recent advices, had £640,000,000
of gold in reserve, besides a big circulation,
and there is no reason why Australia
shouldn’t have something pretty of the sort
likewise—something bigger than it has. With
this increased reserve it should be abundantly
safe to print some more notes; and unless
there are more notes it is hard to see how
all the hard-borrowing Governments can bor-
row all the notes they want to borrow. The
gold output could be paid for in our own
currency—that is to say, it could be paid
for in money only good for spending in Aus-
tralia instead of, as at present, in money
that is only good for spending outside Aus-
tralia. If there is an apparent loss or com-
plication in paying, say, £4 16s. in paper
that is. nominally redeemable in the dim
future in gold, for an ounce of gold that is
normally worth only £3 19s. in coin, the
profits of the note issue can stand the racket.
The auriferous output is so small now that
it isn’t much of a racket. We certainly
could not afford to pay the producers in
paper only the amount they would be en-
titled to in gold ; for that would close down
many, if not most, of the mines, and we
cannot afford any more unemployment. If
by any chance a test should prove that there
is a hole in the anti-export argument, the
new pile of gold can always be got rid of.
Nothing is easier to get rid of. The present
situation is that Australian Governments can
borrow gold in London, but owing to ex-
change complications, which appear to have
come to stay for a long time, they can’t get
it here. In the circumstances, it seems
worth while to keep the gold here that is
here —that is born here, in fact. This “one-
way traffic only” in gold is wrong somewhere.
State Railway Ownership on Trial.
The Speck’s railways total 663 miles and
have cost £6,300,006. As the earnings last
year were only £572,417 and the expenses
£514,350, the profit was no better than 0.74
per cent. The estimate for 1924 is less even
than that. The two best years since the
Government acquired the old Midland Rail-
way Co.’s line for a trifle of £1,100,000 four
decades ago were 1913 and 1921. when pro-
fits equalled something less than 24 iter cent,
on capital. This year expenses are likely
to exceed earnings by at least £20,000, and,
as the interest bill is well over a quarter-
million, the year’s loss will not be far short
of £300,000. With his eyes full of these
calamitous figures and his ears full of the
deafening demands for increased road votes
to repair the highways damaged by the heavy
motor-lorries plying for freight in competi-
tion with the railways, new Labor Premier
Lyons promptly called for assistance, and
South Australia lent its newly-imported
American. Commissioner TV. A. Webb to
make a diagnosis of the case. Commissioner
Webb, after inspecting 570 of the island’s
630 miles of railroad and poking an inquir-
ing nose into every corner of the manage-
ment, fled back to Adelaide, from which he
mailed his considered diagnosis and prescrip-
tion. Nothing so startling has struck Tas-
mania since the Neale report on education
of a couple of decades ago—h bomb that also
originated in South Australia. lie finds,
among other evidences of antediluvian man-
agement, that the official staff is altogether
too large for the mileage, and that there
are too many separate departments for cheap
and efficient working; in short, the whole
thing is top-heavy. He urges the immediate
appointment of a sole Commissioner who
shall be a competent engineer, and shall be
paid at least £2500 a year for seven years,
during which term he shall have sole charge
of the railways, including contraction of new
lines, if any. The Commissioner must be
absolutely free of political control or influ-
ence, and free also of the present Appeal
Board and similar interferences with railway
discipline, and removable only for proved
malfeasance. Such a Commissioner, if the
right man, would proceed “to take the
same action for the State that any privately-
owned business would take if it were con-
fronted with your present situation of expen-
diture being in excess of income,” for “effi-
cient Governments can no more violate econo-
mic laws without coming to grief than can
individuals or privately-owned business
firms.” Further:—
To prevent the motor traffic from destroying rail-
way transportation, all carriage of goods and pas-
sengers by road must be placed under the Railway
Commissioner; motor-cars and trucks should be
licensed, and shall pay at least a fourth of their earn-
ings to the Commissioner; the Commissioner should
be empowered to add road motor-cars to his equip-
ment.
Private Enterprise, in the guise of motor-
lorry owners, is almost too indignant for
words. Premier Lyons himself says nothing,
and his Cabinet says precisely the same.
There is not a Ministerial whisper to indi-
cate the intentions of the Government. The
Premier gravely laid the document on the
table of the House with the simple remark
that, as it concerned all the people of the
State, he had no doubt the newspapers would
publish the whole thing. Of course the news-
papers took the hint; and the resultant noise
in the land is so great that Hobart residents
can scarcely hear the sirens of the steamers
making off down the Derwent with the first
cargoes of apples for London. All the same,
there is a pretty general feeling that Mr.
Webb’s diagnosis is right, and his proposed
remedies not very far from unavoidable
if the State is to keep the railways in its
own possession. Australia adopted the
policy of State-ownership for one reason and
one reason only—that railway users might
be saved from exploitation. But they are
not being saved from exploitation; where-
fore the whole question of railway ownership
and control is once more up for considera-
tion.

After Dalhousie.
In Victoria recently a young Digger-farmer,
standing in the Labor interest, was elected
by a small majority for Dalhousie, a rural
Assembly seat which no Labor man had
ever won before. Local and personal in-
fluences had a lot to do with the victory—
quite as much, indeed, as Labor sentiment —
for the successful candidate was a resident
of the district and thoroughly well liked,
whereas the Nationalist was a stranger and
the Cocky a recent arrival from another
State. In point of fact, the Labor man
polled less than a third of the • primary
votes and fewer than those cast for the
Nationalist, who would probably have won
had there been only two candidates, and in-
disputably had the first-past-the-post method
obtained with three candidates going.
All the same, Dalhousie has become a word
to conjure with among Labor politicians.
It has revived the thought, or strength-
ened it, that the party is about to regain
the commanding position it enjoyed in 1910
and lost in 1916. In the exhilaration born
of the belief some remarkably foolish things
have been said. At a banquet in honor of
the member for Dalhousie that young man
spoke with becoming modesty of the “agree-
able surprise” he had felt when the numbers
went up, and of the necessity for being
“tolerant of our opponents.” Prendergast,
who has been leader of the Victorian Labor
party, off and on, for 20 years, without hold-
ing office for longer than a month, was in a
vastly more exuberant mood. Referring to
the unpromising aspect of the money market,
which renders it difficult for the time being
to waste a few more millions in Government
steamers, trawlers, fish-shops, cattle-runs,
timber areas, cottages, wheat-pools, fruit-
pools and all manner of dirt-jobs, Prender-
gast suggested that the remedy was simple
and obvious. “He did not see why there
should not be some form of forced loan by
which wealthy people would be compelled to
lend them money at reasonable interest for
the development of the country.” So much
Australian money has been invested in tax-
free Government loans, which have been
recklessly wasted for the most part, that too
little is available for labor-giving private
undertakings; hence unemployment. Pren-
dergast’s forced loan would further denude
this fund and so cause unemployment to
spread; the effect, in short, would be to
penalise non-Government workers and favor
Government workers, whose operations are
much less productive, judged by results. In
aiming at his “wealthy people,” much of
whose wealth, thanks to Labor and good-as-
Labor Governments, has been deposited in
the sanctuary of tax-free securities, Pren-
dergast would hit a numerous section of his
own supporters, but that is Prendergast
all over. Another solution of the financial
problem, as it concerns N. S. Wales, is sug-
gested by O’Halloran, secretary of the
State Labor party. O’Halloran, a robust
democrat of the wrongs-of-Ireland school,
has discovered that “a state of uneasiness
exists in financial and business circles,” be-
cause the Fuller Ministry has put off a few
Government employees and reduced loan ex-
penditure to about £4 per head per annum.
“Something has to be done,” shouts O’Hal-
loran. “and that, soon, or financial chaos
will reign.” The “something” O’Halloran
proposes is that the Fuller Government
should “get out and make room for a Gov-
ernment that understands the wants of the
country, and how to satisfy these wants” —
i.c., by borrowing harder than ever. N. S.
Wales has been brought to its present pass
by over-indulgence in loans. O’llalloran’s
idea is that it will regain its health by taking
larger doses of the drug that has done the
damage. Lazzarini, the effusive. M.11.R.
for Werriwa (N.S.W.), has also a pet nos-
trum—“the nationalisation of finance and
credit.” This has been tried in Russia with
results so thrilling that the Soviet Govern-
ment is breaking its neck to get credits in
“capitalist” countries. By contrast with the
blither of Prendergast, O’Halloran and
Lazzarini, Collier, the Westralian Labor-
leader, is making over-borrowing and un-
sound expenditure the chief counts in his
indictment against the Mitchell Govern-
ment. The Tasmanian debt and deficit were
likewise the main points in Labor-leader
(now Premier) Lyons’s indictment of his
Nationalist opponents. It is all terribly
confusing, and suggests nothing very de-
finite, except perhaps the vast gulf that
ncw r lies between the Labor politicians of the
smaller States, which are hard up against
it, and those of the larger States, whose
awakening has yet to come.

Imperialism ami Beefsteak.
In Australia Freetraders are nearly always
professing Imperialists. But in the home of
Cobdenism Liberalism began by regarding
colonies as encumbrances, and still views
them with thinly-veiled disfavor. We may
not care about the Liberal-Labor attitude
towards Imperial preference, but it is, any-
how, consistent. It was to be expected that
a Freetrade Government, like that of Ram-
say Macdonald, would hand its military
meat contracts to a foreign firm, if the lat-
ter’s tender was cheaper than that of a Brit-
ish or Dominion firm, and the event duly
arrived the other day, when Argentina (that
is to say, the U.S. Meat Trust) secured a
£50,000 order for canned meats from the
War Office in opposition to Australia.
According to Freetrade notions —British
Freetrade notions, that is—the deal was be-
yond criticism. It saved the Treasury
several thousands sterling. Of course, there
are other aspects. Britain, which shortly
before the war grew nearly half its meat,
now imports over five-sixths: at Smitlifield
last year, of the 430,000 tons handled, but
68,800 tons were home-grown. Over a dozen
years ago The Bulletin was pointing out
that the U.S. Meat Trust meant to estab-
lish itself at Smitlifield, and a recent pro-
spectus quoted from by Agent-General Asii-
bolt, of Tasmania, in the December issue
of Empire Production, shows how far
the Chicago concern has gone on the road
to success:—
The company.... will acquire the whole of the
Ordinary Shares in nine companies. The purchase
will give control of about 2400 retail shops, depots
and market stalls in this country [England], together
with factories and wholesale selling establishments.
This will constitute by far the largest and most
complete organisation of its kind in the world.
Argentina is selling its meat cheap in Eng-
land at present, and present cheapness is
all that concerns believers in the Freetrade
gospel. They forget or ignore the fact that
during the war certain Argentine interests
earned 100 per cent, dividends out of the
necessities of the Allies, while Australia, for
example, made no attempt to take advantage
of Britain’s desperate plight. The British
Freetrader forgets, too, that his country has
a clamorous army of unemployed on its
hands. These people can only be absorbed
by lands capable of providing them with a
living. With a little encouragement to
Dominions industries they will emigrate
within the Empire, and remain Britishers.
In the other event, thousands will go else-
where, with those evil results, should war
come, that emigrant countries of the type
of Germany and Japan have sought to pro-
vide against by elaborate, though usually
futile, nationalisation laws. All such facts
and contingencies have doubtless been
weighed by the British Freetrader, and quite
logically and consistently dismissed as un-
worthy of consideration by one who, in his
traditional capacity of anti-imperialist, con-
siders America as good a place as any for
settlement by impoverished Britons, and
who, as a pacifist, declines to recognise the
likelihood of another war. But what is the
Australian Freetrader—who, as mentioned
above, is practically always a rampant Im-
perialist—doing in that galley? The truth
is a Freetrade Imperialist is as much a con-
tradiction in terms as a dog-faced beauty.

Latter-day Czars.
The Rev. R. Hammond, of Sydney, levelled
this devastating charge the other day:—
We only need 100,000 prohibitionists out. of the
400,000 in this State to pledge themselves to the
ideal of a “dry” Parliament, and in 12 months it
will be so.
The tragedy of the accusation lies in its
truth. It is a fact that, as Parliaments func-
tion to-day, any determined little gang of
cranks or scoundrels can foist unwanted
edicts on the dumb, unknowing public, or
engage in corrupt practices. Decisions on
questions involving the expenditure of huge
sums of public money are not necessarily
made by Parliaments: often they are merely
brought to Parliaments for ratification. The
actuating force behind a big deal may be
a financier and a few friends, none of them
ever elected to a Parliament or wishful to
be. Their position does not differ greatly
from that of a pre-war unconstitutional
sovereign. They have Ministers who are
prepared to go to great lengths for them;
they are responsible to nobody ; they rule the
party machines, by either cash or cunning.
The well-meaning crank comes in a different
category. He has nothing to offer Ministers
or the party organisations usually but
threats. There are cases, however, in which
a threat may carry more weight than the
promise of a cheque—as, for example, when
a prohibitionist leader is able to satisfy
a Government that he has solid block-votes
in the constituencies capable of turning a
Parliamentary majority into a minority. If
Mr. Hammond’s 100,000 force a “dry” Par-
liament on N. S. Wales’s population of
1,930,246, and if prohibition with its accom-
panying pains and penalties follows, it will
be an example of tyranny as dangerous as
any of the arrangements between the late
Czar and his advisers which led up to the
Ekaterinburg crime. It will hardly be dis-
puted that prohibition is unenforceable in
N. S. Wales at present, and there is no
evidence from any of the countries which
are experimenting with the scheme that a
lone Australian State can ever hope to make
a success of it. So high an authority as
Archdeacon Boyce laid it down some time
ago that it would be unwise to attempt to
impose teetotalism without ‘ a substantial
majority in favor of the reform. He was
speaking, no doubt, with the uneditying
spectacle of innumerable disregarded laws m
his mind’s eye. It is an offence under the JN. S.
Wales Pure Foods Act to smoke in restaurants.
Yet smoking goes on in every dining-room
where the majority of the approve
of it. Most forms of gambling are forbidden
by statute, except on certain racecourses; yet
thousands of reputable citizens habitually
engage in games of chance. Six o’clock clos-
ing is a farce for the sufficient reason that
many people insist on having alcohol with
their evening meals, and the majority think
they have a right to it. All these and many
other laws that were foredoomed to be
ignored, to the embarrassment of the police,
and to the discredit of sensible enactments,
are products of the block-vote method of
bludgeoning Parliaments. Success brings a
passing sense of triumph to the organisers
and underground workers responsible, but
the results are negative where they are not
pernicious.
A Drought that Is Breaking.
T. H. Alsing on a Norwegian experiment:
Uncle Sam's experiment in prohibition has been
getting more than its fair share of publicity; it 's
time that somebody spoke up for Norway, where the
same thing has provided just as many adventures to
the square mile —so many, in fact, that if the promises
recently made in the King’s speech come true, Pussy-
foot Johnson will be another step away from his
ambition of a dry world. He may have convinced
the Sultan of Zanzibar of its desirability, but it
won... take a good deal to convince Norwegians of
the same thing just now.
The Norwegians have never been famous for their
abstinence, and it came like a shock that even a
minority could pass a prohibition law. Yet that
happened in 1917. In that year Norway went dry
as far as spirits and heavy wines are concerned,
which means to all intents and purposes. The Norse-
man is very fond of his “aquavit,” a kind of
schnapps heavily flavored with caraway seed; and,
anyway, beer and hock are not much good to a man
when there is six feet of snow on the ground. Still
for six years he has stood it —with the aid of smuggled
German raw spirits and doctors’ prescriptions.
When Prohibition was enacted, the Norseman
mourned for a while, but he was never one to let a
trifle beat him. The stuff had to be got, and if
the Government had decided to forego the revenue,
so much the worse for the Treasury. There is no
coast in the world that lends itself to smuggling
better than the Norwegian. It is jagged and torn,
and there are that many inlets and bays, headlands,
islands and reefs that if it all was straightened out
it would be long enough to go twice around Aus-
tralia, although the total area of the country is
only about two-fifths of that of N. S. Wales. The
German coast is near, and not too many countries
had been falling over themselves to buy German goods.
For a while the Germans sent the real stuff; but
when the full force of Norway’s thirst became appa-
rent, raw spirit colored and flavored with burnt sugar
was found to do the trick. It is sent across in
blackened benzine tins, dumped on the numerous
islands, and carried from there in fast motor-boats
to cheer gloomy Norsemen. The trouble is that, bad
as it is, it does not even provide a cheap jag, for
the smugglers know how to charge.
It is difficult to estimate the amount of spirit
that enters Norway in this manner. The official figures
are of little use, as so few smugglers, comparatively,
are caught ; still the bag was 909 in 1921, 1082 in
1922, and 1150 in 1923. In 1922 about 20,000
gallons of spirit was confiscated, and last year about
45,000 gallons. The authorities estimate that they
get about 5 per cent., which means that about 900,000
gallons went into Norway last year. This is a pretty
heavy supply for such a small population.
But there is another method of irrigation for those
who can afford it. As in America, the doctors are
allowed to prescribe spirits for patients. Hardware
of this kind, including several well-known brands of
“Scotch,” is freely advertised in the papers as
obtainable at “the best chemists,” and the chemists
even display in their windows “Scotch” in convenient
bottles to fit the hip-pocket. Prescriptions are not
hard to get. Doctors supply them free of charge
to friends and regular clients, and to others for a
consideration. Doctoring in Norway was not much
of a profession until the drought came, but it is
good business now. Most people carry a few with
them, and if you want to invite friends to a jovial
evening and have forgotten to get the doctor’s per-
mission, a kind person can usually be found who will
lend you a few until you can get a supply yourself.
The police used to prosecute doctors for giving
prescriptions to perfectly healthy persons, but they
soon got tired of it. Not a single conviction was
obtained.
How the Prohibition against heavy wines was lifted
is a curious lesson in international politics. Norway’s
supply of this commodity came from France, Spain
and Portugal, all Catholic countries which consume
a great amount of fish during Lent. With droughts
starting in all sorts of unexpected places, these
countries determined to stop it where possible, and
in this instance they had a great opportunity of
retaliating. King Fish rules Norway, and markets
have to be obtained for him. It looked pretty blue
when these countries raised the duties on Norwegian
sardines so that they became too dear to buy. At
the same time they dealt the Norwegian shipping
interests a severe blow by raising the harbor dues
against them. Norway had no intention of commit-
ting financial suicide, so she promptly repealed the
prohibition on heavy wines. Which ended that
experiment.
Now the other is about to be ended. It has been
a costly business. The Treasury has lost an enor-
mous amount of revenue without decreasing to any
great extent the consumption of spirits. Besides,
the spirits imported are of such a nature as to injure
the health of the community, and it is also stated
officially that there has been a big increase in crinv*.
Further, the police report that no evil effects fol-
lowed the repeal of the prohibition of heavy wines.
No wonder Norway wants to end the drought.

JLo the Poor German!
“Why doesn’t Germany collapse? The plain man
can be forgiven for asking this question, in naive
w'onderment. It seems no exaggeration to say that
Germany does not collapse because there is nothing
left to collapse. She is literally an organism almost
drained of her life-blood, enduring a suspended ani-
mation which, though it may carry the potentiality
of recovery, is little better than a catalepsy.”—
Stead’s Review.
It has taken Germany’s foreign propagandists
and sympathisers five years to work up to that
conclusion. They could hardly have postponed
the diagnosis much longer, since never a year
has passed but they have foretold the
eventual dissolution of the Fatherland and the
reversion of Europe to barbarism, unless the

fillies cancelled their war claims. This latest
appeal to the world's kind heart might carry
some weight, fantastic though it appears,
on the surface, were it not that all previous
moans and threats from similar sources have
proved so absurdly devoid of foundation.
Of late the friends of our former enemies
have been indulging in marrow-freezing pro-
phecies about the Ruhr. When the French
first went there London Nation acclaimed
the resulting general strike: —
The trade unions in the Ruhr are standing solidly
behind the railwaymen, who have to endure the first
shock. All members of the trade unions are forbidden
to report for work to the French, and “traitors are
outlawed.” Thus it can be seen that the prospects
for the re-establishment of normal conditions in the
Ruhr are most gloomy.
A special correspondent of the same paper
subsequently took the exultant view that this
admirable strike and the boycott which grew
from it would drive the French out of Ger-
many altogether and settle the reparations
dispute in a manner entirely satisfactory to
Berlin :
It exasperates the French; it has led to blood-
shed. I should call it the weapon of the unarmed
man, who, outraged in his deepest feelings by a
sudden invasion of his rights, and the consequent
menace to life and property, can think of no better
device to assert the first principles of justice. The
Ruhr worker is proud to think that he is making
history, that his peaceful resistance will be remem-
bered as a triumph of right over might. He hopes
that it may set a lesson to the world of the undying
strength of the human will in a struggle with mili-
tarism.
Actually this strike, like most strikes every-
where, was foredoomed to failure. Within
a month most of the German railway men
were at work again. Over 15 per cent, of
the Ruhr’s 545,000 miners are not Germans,
but Poles, Czeclioslavs and Yugoslavs. About
50 per cent, of the Germans arc socialists
or communists whose national sentiments
are far from strong. Much to the dis-
appointment of the pacifists of England,
who, as between Germany and France, have
consistently played the part of the agitator
in the industrial sphere, the miners evinced
no more desire for martyrdom than the rail-
way men. They have settled down to work.
And that is what all Germany will do the
moment papers like Stead’s and the Nation
cease to encourage the belief that there is
money in whining and scrim-slianking. The
pre-war wealth of Germany was estimated
at 400 billion marks, and most of it is there
still, simply because it couldn’t be shifted.
Its agriculture is in a flourishing state.
The shipping industry (heavily subsidised
and almost wholly untaxed) is earning great
profits, and growing at an unprecedented
rate. All the evidence inside and outside
the allegedly dying land goes to show that
the wealth of the great industrial and finan-
cial concerns is enormous. It is ludicrous in
the circumstances to suggest that Germany
is a starving pauper, or anything else but
a stout swindler who is ready to tell or act
any lie to avoid his liabilities.

Collier’s Opportunity.
Since the trouble over conscription the West-
ralian Labor party, which held office from
October, 1911, till August, 1916, has been
an inconsiderable factor in Jarrahland poli-
tics. It was routed at the 1917 election,
and three years ago it won no more than
16 of the 50 Leg. Assembly seats. Another
two were gained by successes at by-elections
(in each case the majority was very small),
but midway through 1923 it seemed perfectly
safe to predict that the party would remain
in Opposition for another three years at
least. Then things began to happen. The
Mitchell Government introduced a long-
overdue Redistribution of Seats Bill which
would have wiped out five Labor pocket-
boroughs in moribund mining districts, where
there are fewer people than abandoned
poppet-heads. But the measure "was feebly
handled, and the strenuous Labor resistance
was successful. Next a fissure occurred in the
Country party, which contributed 18 members
to the lopsided coalition, in which there
were only nine Nationalists, including Pre-
mier Mitchell and George, the Minister of
Works, and five National Laborites. Fol-
lowing on repeated declarations that men
elected as Cockies had become abject sup-
porters of Mitchell, the Country party
organisation withdrew its endorsement from
Sampson, one of the Agrarian Ministers, and
three private members. Maley, Cocky leader
and Mitchell’s first lieutenant, thereupon
sided with Sampson, as also did Scaddan,
the third Agrarian Minister, deputy-leader
Latham and the other members of the
party, with three exceptions. These three
are standing for re-election as orthodox (the
Mitchell press calls them “Opposition”)
Cockies, and 10 other seats are being con-
tested in the same interest; whereas the rival
faction has transformed itself into the “Min-
isterial Country party” and is receiving such
aid as the National Federation may be able
to afford. If, as seems more than likely,
half a dozen orthodox Farmers are elected
on March 22, the Government will be in a
hopeless plight, even on the highly impro-
bable supposition that it will hold its ground
elsewhere. It has crowned its folly in not
getting the 1911 electoral boundaries altered
by letting Collier start the election with
an advantage of 10 seats in unopposed re-
turns. In the circumstances, Westralia will
probably acquire another Labor Ministry.
If it is a Ministry like the first of its kind
or the second, the country will deserve sym-
pathy. But the party really to have
learned something since 1916. Colliers
speeches suggest that he, at least, is alive
to the fact that there has been too much
land-settlement of the shiftless Mitchell
variety, that foreign borrowing has been
vastly overdone, and that reckless loan ex-
penditure and ill-distributed taxation re-acts
harshly on the wage-earner—which last truth
has been borne in upon the Labor Govern-
ment in the Speck.

Sydney Facing the Vandals.
Henri Singemoine watches them at work:
Professor Wilkinson opened an exhibition of maps
and photographs last Thursday under the auspices
of the Sydney Regional Plan Convention. The aim
is to wake the city up to its crudities, and some
truly frightful methods have been employed. The
Place de 1’ Etoile in Paris is contrasted with Rail-
way-square (the one having the Arc de Triomnhe
and the other a tramshed in the centre of it),
and poor old wandering, ragged Eiizabeth-street is
placed in juxtaposition to the Rue de Rivoli.
AVhat the display does most to suggest is that
Sydney’s worst horrors are irremediable within the
next half-century or more, no matter how the public
mind is inflamed with regard to them. But there
is useful preventive work that may be undertaken
at this moment. W. H. Kelly, ex-M.P., put his
finger on a great truth in a letter to the S. M.
Herald a few days ago: —
Sydney now boasts of her size, and. cares nothing
for her‘vanishing loveliness ! Surely it is not yet
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
“Commenting on Mr. Theodore’s financial mission to London, the financial editor of the London Daily
Telegraph says the rate of the Queensland conversion loan must naturally be affected as the result of
such incidents as have been created by the notorious Queensland legislation amending the Act under
which the annual rents of pastoral leases were fixed.”
FARMER BULL-COHEN (to Theodore) : “Seems a hit nervous of you? Yes, sonny ; if you
remember you twisted her tail the last time you milked her.”
too late to call a halt to the vandals. Is there
any sense in permitting land speculators to denude
a whole district of-trees in the stupid, belief that,
by ruining the beauty of a neighborhood, they will
sell it more readily? Is there any sense in turning
ocean fronts into drifting sand by tearing up the
binding vegetation ?
Consider in this connection the tragedy of Narrabeen
—and Narrabeen typifies a hundred outlying suburbs
that will soon be as much part of Sydney as North
Hampstead is part of London. Twenty years ago
Narrabeen had the haunting beauty of a tropical
beach, in conjunction with a range of tree-clad
hills such as one may see flanking the valleys of
Normandy or above the Thames between Pang-
bourne and Goring. At short intervals along the
wonderful curve formed by the coast-line waved
cabbage-tree palms—yellow sand in front of them
and sage-green scrub behind. The palms are all
gone now and so is the scrub. Their places have
been taken by crazy wooden cottages which are
drenched in flying sand every time an easterly
gale blows. As to the hills, most of their trees
have been cut down and the rest are doomed. Fur-
ther on is a peninsula, formed by ocean and lake.
Once it was well-wooded and guarded by scrub to
the beach’s edge. Land sharks tore away the vege-
tation that Nature had provided for the protection
of the place, and the obliteration of the whole settle-
ment by the ever-moving sand is only a matter of a
decade or so. From every l ' standpoint economic as
well as aesthetic, this wonderful region has been
ruined.
However, there are many others, north and south
of Sydney, that may be saved. It should be made an
offence to destroy' any tree or shrub within a fixed
number of yards of a beach without the permission
of the Local Government Department. The Shire
Councils should be charged then with the duty
of seeing that for every tree cut down along
a foreshore another is planted, and certain trees,
and notably the irreplaceable palms, of which many
still remain, should be protected absolutely. The
whole scenic character of our coasts and harbors —•
the one feature that gives them individuality—is
their indigenous vegetation. The future suburbs of
Sydney ought to be as lovely as parts of France’s
C6te d’Azur: land agents, speculators and shire coun-
cillors are transforming them into Australian Peck-
hams without Peckham’s orderliness and solidity.
This disastrous tendency could be stayed by one
short Act of Parliament, and it should have a salu-
tary effect on the bigger movement which the
Regional Planners are heroically attempting to push
on. As a matter of fact, the best method, probably,
of interesting the populace in the beautification of
Sydney (a work which will still be unfinished 100
years hence) would be to make a brisk beginning
with some humble offshoot of it —such as Maroubra.

The miserably inadequate accommodation
that the Sydney Public Library offers to the
people who desire to use it is stressed rather
more plaintively than usual in the report for
the year just ended. The trustees point out
that whereas the Melbourne Public Library
claims an average of 2000 readers a day, the
figure at the Macquarie-street institution is
only 649—mainly no doubt because no more
can be huddled into the building. It might
be added that a less inviting sight than the
Library presents, with occupants jambed to-
gether like sardines in a tin, is unimagin-
able ; the place is, to put it frankly, the last
word in discomfort and unwholesomeness. A
generation back the building was recognised
as a makeshift, and as long ago as 1910
Parliament picked the site for a new Public
Library. The foundations for the main build-
ing were laid in the ensuing year, and then
the work stopped dead. Periodical deputa-
tations i»o Ministers appear to have little or
no effect; the trustees almost despairingly
record that Bruntnell, Minister for Public
Instruction, xjromised to bring the matter be-
fore Cabinet over 20 months ago, but no inti-
mation has been received that he has ever
done so. The Public Library of N.S.W. has
a collection of books that any city might be
proud of, and a place to keep them that no
city could help being ashamed of.

Ex-Treasurer and Labor-leader Lang, of
N. S. Wales, has raised his voice against
the Communists of the Moscow brand who
have eaten into the Australian Labor move-
ment. Where the Communists have got in
(for they made an early start) ;
Useful business has been practically suspended at
the meetings. An orgy of abuse and intrigue has
taken the place of beneficial effort for the move-
ment. Decent-minded people find it more and more
difficult to face the meetings, which are gradually
being abandoned to these gangs of blaspheming poli-
tical cut-throats.
Unfortunately, a year or so after the N. S.
Wales Labor party, then free of the Com-
munist element, acquired office, its leaders
proceeded to demonstrate that their alleged
policy of reduced loan expenditure was bogus,
and that they had duped and tricked the
country. Still, if the ex-Treasurer thinks
that something should be done to prevent the
crookedness of his old friends being
swamped and eclipsed by the extra-
crookedness of his new acquaintances, there
are suggestions which might be made. One
is that the teaching and preaching of murder,
arson, theft and the taking from the people
of their self-governing rights (the revolu-
tion covers them all) should be made
offences punishable by permanent disqualifi-
cation as a voter, member of Parliament or
alderman.
“Sir aw Line": “Capricorn" (B. 21/2/’24)
says that in tlie districts between Townsville
and Mossman tlie Australian sugar-grower
is being pushed out by Italians. But his
figures prove something quite different. Brit-
ish growers are still more than two to one
of foreign, but foreign cane-cutters are in
a big majority. Witness “Capricorn’s"
statistics for four districts:—
British British
Farmers. Labor.
Cairns 370 326
Johnstone River . . .. 325 205
Herbert River . . . . 188 .36
Totals . . . . 883 567
As tlie British growers must need more than
about two-thirds of a laborer apiece, obvi-
ously they are employing foreigners. That
these should be Italians is reasonable enough,
people of that nationality being so well
suited for work in tropical and semi-tropical
countries that when a party of politicians
visited the Northern Territory some years
ago the more intelligent of them inclined to
the opinion that the best hope of populating
the territory with Europeans was in inducing
Italians to settle there. Anyhow, what
“Capricorn” usefully shows is that for in-
dustrial purposes the Australian stock, like
the original North American, is giving out.
I have a little building job on hand in a
Sydney suburb. The master builder is a
Choom. The municipal engineer who over-
looks the plans is recently from the Old
Dart. So is the girl behind the counter
where they sell the inside ironmongery. So
are most others concerned in the job. All
very well to snigger at Pommy and his elon-
gated vowels, but it’s Pommy here and
Pommy there and Pommy pretty well every-
where if you want skilled craftsmanship and
service. We are making lawyers and doctors
and dentists by thousands; but the manu-
facture of native artisans is a flickering in-
dustry—if not a flickered. The country’s
choice is between importing labor from Bri-
tain and Europe and importing the things
which that labor makes in its own countries.

“Tea Gardens” ; In April a fearful lot of
mush and inaccurate history will be written
and talked about Captain Cook, whom most
political and other orators persist in regard-
ing as the discoverer of Australia. And
about Anniversary Day various persons are
annually petrified with amazement at the
wonderful sagacity of Governor Phillip in
realising at once Cook’s blunder over Botany
Bay and shifting to the fine harbor next
door. Phillip was in a hurry, and he did
the best he could with the knowledge lie
had. But with more knowledge he could
have done much better. Sydney has a fine
harbor, but Nature had marked out Port
Stephens as the site for the greatest port on
the east coast of Australia. Its. entrance
has 30 feet more water than Port Jackson
had before it was deepened. In fact, Nature
has given it water enough, with no artificial
aid, for the largest ships now afloat or ever
likely to be. This is more than can be said
of any Australian capital except Hobart.
Within, Port Stephens is 24 times larger
than Port Jackson. But it is in its rela-
tion to the interior that the great advantage
of Port Stephens lies. Sydney has such a
tangle of mountains and gorges behind it that
it took the early settlers 25 years to get over
them at all. To-day the railways drag every-
thing backwards and forwards over the
mountains at vast expense. Not far to the
south of Port Stephens is a natural gateway
into the interior, the low and easy Cassilis
Gap or Hunter Gate. It is the only place
for over 1000 miles —from beyond the Dar-
ling Downs in Queensland to the Kilmore
depression in Victoria —where the “dividing
range” sinks below the 1000 ft. level. Back
of Sydney the range is from 3000 feet to 4000
feet high; and even at the Lake George Gate
it is over 2000 feet. It was not Phillip's
fault that he never knew anything about the
existence of the Cassilis Gap; but it might
have been expected that some of his suc-
cessors who did know would have had brains
enough to put a railway through it before
this. The truth is it is too dangerous to
Sydney. All the railways religiously avoid
Port Stephens lest some stray trade should
find its natural outlet there. The Railway
Commissioners have just stated that they
do not want even a branch line to it. They
consider that the port of Newcastle can
serve all requirements. But Port Stephens
is the natural port for the Hunter Valley,
and it has cost the State a pretty penny
to fly in the face of nature and make a deep-
sea port at the mouth of the Hunter. A
canal from the Hunter to Port Stephens
could have been easily and cheaply made.
The distance is only a few miles, and it is
all low, flat, alluvial land. This would have
given Newcastle and the Hunter Valley the
finest natural harbor in N. S. Wales. Any
mistakes that Cook and Phillip made when
they had to go blindfold at things are mere
trifles compared with those perpetrated and
perpetuated by their better-informed succes-
sors.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
Germany, deprived of its section of New
Guinea, has an eye upon the Dutch piece.
A. concession is being sought from the Nether-
lands Government to open up a large area—
about twice the size of Victoria- —utterly un-
explored in the interior, full of fever and
high mountains. The proposal is for a char-
tered co. to administer and exploit the area,
the Dutch Government to receive a 10 p.c.
royalty on all products and trade. The
Dutch have never made the slightest attempt
to develop the country, and know little, if
anything, of its mineral resources. It was
only in 1920 that they showed any official
interest in the colony. They then created
it a province, with a settlement that could
hardly be dignified by the name of town, and
appointed a Governor, who found his position
so trying that a few months ago he suicided.
A few r German settlers from ex-German N.G.
migrated to Humboldt Bay, and although
they appear to have done very little they still
remain there. The centre of the pearling
industry is slowly moving into these waters,
and Japan is watching the new move.
A rich landowner died in England the
other day, and, as the cable quietly put it,
“a cheque for £1,200,000 was paid at Somer-
set House yesterday in estate duty. Other
sums are to follow.” Happenings like this
probably bring it home to Rambling Mac-
donald that Britain already has a levy on
capital (or three levies —-estate duty, legacy
duty and succession duty), and they are
capable of mopping up almost half of a very
big fortune. Therefore when his party
viewed this as a virgin gold-mine it was out
of its reckoning. But despite death duties
and other exactions the U.K. remains the
land of big estates. The Law of the Eldest
Son does its darnedest to keep the large
properties together, and the levy when the
old owner dies does less than might be ex-
pected to break them up. But it often puts
a sky-scraping mortgage on the estate, and
then the new owner economises on repairs
and screw’s the tenant a bit harder to make
up leeway.
A prophecy from Perth: —
There will be a Labor Ministry in Westralia at
the end of the month. Phil Collier and his fol-
lowers have a secure hold on 18 of the 50 Assembly
electorates—at the moment most of them are with-
out opponents. Then the party is tolerably sure to
recover Menzies, Guildford and Bunbury, and it has
even-money chances in Mount Margaret (Speaker
Taylor’s seat), Fremantle, Albany, Nelson and
Leederville, together with fair-to-middling prospects
in Subiaco, Sussex, Perth, Avon, Pilbarra and Kim-
berley. All these constituencies, with the exception
of Kimberley and Sussex, used to elect Labor men.
If only four or five of them return to their old
allegiance Collier will lead the strongest party in
the House. In that case the Mitchell Government
could only exist by permission of the anti-Mitchell
Cocky group (the Ministerial press calls it the
■“Opposition Country party”), which, seeing that it
has the Farmers’ organisation behind it, will pro-
bably be the more numerous faction after March 22.
There is a lot of pride, as well as good-humor, in
Mitchell’s composition, and rather than accept a
humiliation like that he would unquestionably resign.
If Collier has to pick a Speaker from the other side
he will have no trouble in getting one—-there are
Nationalists and Cookies who would jump at it. But
he is hoping for an absolute majority.
In the matter of a bridge:—
Sydney Harbor bridge, which has been talked of
for half a century, is to be constructed by Dorman,
Long and Co., an English firm with workshops in
Sydney and Melbourne. They have undertaken to
build a bridge of the arch type for £4,217,721, and
the amount may be reduced to £8,499,815 if four
granite-faced towers (which would afford tolerably
good targets for a low-flying bomb-thrower) are
cut out. An element of doubt enters into the span-
ning of all wide waterways, and this, it has been
pointed out, will be the biggest arch bridge in the
world. Still engineer Bradfield is confident that his
dream will be realised without such tragic interrup-
tions as occurred at Quebec ; and Fraser, the Chief Rail-
way Commissioner:, says that, expressed in steel, it will
take all the loads he expects to send over it. It is
provided that the whole of the material will be
fabricated locally. Another promise, not so specific
or so satisfactory, is that half the steel (50,000
tons) will be got in N. S. Wales if the Broken Hill
Piop. can supply it. Already it has been suggested
that the capacity of the Broken Hill Prop, for the
particular material required is limited to 18,000
tons, and in the interest of Australian industry this
is a feature that will have to be watched. For the
rest, it has been shown that the N. S. Wales Labor
Government initiated the movement for removal of
the duties on bridgework; but whether the fiscal
policy laid down by the national representatives
should be remoulded to the desire of any State
Government or altered at the will of any non-
elective Board remains a matter for early considera-
tion by the Commonwealth Parliament.
As was expected, the Russian Government,
having been recognised by Britain’s sympa-
thetic Labor Ministry, is making tentative
remarks about a loan, though the 1700 mil-
lions or so which it repudiated remain out-
standing. The loan would be taken out in
goods, and the British workman is in mortal
HOMELESS.
“The Australia is being broken up at Garden Island. The hull will be taken out and sunk in about
a month’s time. No ship has been built to replace her.”
need of a job, even if it is paid for with a
very dubious lOU, so there is quite a pos-
sibility that Yladmir Badeggsky may raise
a trifle. Within the last nine months Brit-
ish municipalities sent a million’s worth of
orders abroad, so Britain sacrifices good cash
customers on Freetrade principles, and gets
hopeless ones like Badeggsky, wdio are always
available.
It is announced that when the Federal
Parliament meets it will ponder ponderously
once again over the insoluble Northern Ter-
ritory problem, as if it was the 14th dimen-
sion or the problem of communicating with
Mars. As regards the Commonwealth’s
other territory nobody ponders. A railway
to connect with the nearest big city is the
orthodox way to shove settlement along, and
there is such haste about it that mdney is
being lent to the State Government to speed
up its share of the business.
Eleven Labor Assemblymen and one
Nationalist have been returned unopposed
in Westralia, leaving 35 contests to be de-
cided on March 22 : three northern polls occur
later. Nothing could be more foolish than
to set 11 opponents free for work in other
electorates, and to allow the impression to
form that a party which starts with an
advantage of 11 seats to one can’t lose; and
Mitchell, of all politicians, ought to know
better. He was a member of a Government
(the late Frank Wilson’s) which, 121 years
ago, presented Labor with 10 unopposed
seats. The party thus favored finished up
with 34 members out of 50.
When compulsory training began in Aus-
tralia (Fisher was Priminister) tire follow-
ing cry of anguish came from a British
Labor politician :
I disagree with Australia when it assumes that
its domestic politics require the backing of force.
From the military point of view the citizen army is
unnecessary, because it presupposes invasion, a thing
which practically every military and naval authority
deems impossible. I Kitchener and Admiral Hender-
son had recently told the Australian Government that
invasion was not only possible but must be prepared
against.] It is a great pity that Australia should
begin a policy of> militarism. This will hamper
the fulfilment of an object on which the rest of the
world is beginning to set its heart —the establish-
ment- of an International Court Which will end
militarism and establish peace.
The delirious rubbish was printed in August,
1911, just three years before the greatest
explosion of militarism in history. Its
author was Ramsay Macdonald, now British
Prime Minister.
Any day now a stream of messages may
be expected from the U.S.A. testifying to the
God-like work W. M. Hughes is putting in
there on behalf of Australia. He has gone,
as Lloyd George did, in quest of a political
re-birth. The cables telling of his large
and enthusiastic audiences won’t be all guff
either, since one of the idiosyncrasies of the
Yank is a passion for being lectured. The
financiers who underwrote his £25,000, and
eventually had to pay most of it, are deter-
mined to" get value for their outlay if they
can. Bruce is not persona grain with them
any more than Baldwin is with the Hebrews
who are behind Lloyd George in England. If
Hughes comes back with the prestige of one
who has done well for his country abroad,
and if Bruce is forced to disclose that his
success overseas was nil or thereabouts, the
chances of the ex-dictator should be bright.
Sydney’s National Club is solidly behind
him, and he can master Parliament, as of
old, the moment he decides to master his
temper.
Winston Churchill retired from the con-
test for the Conservative nomination in the
Westminster division by-election last week
“owing to the condition that a candidate
must not stand if the association failed to
select him.” He was the only distinctive
figure offering, and the bulk of the votes
eventually went to an obscure nephew of the
former member. That is how pre-selection
nearly always works out. It begins by ex-
cluding all candidates of independence, and
ends by plumping for the most pliant and
inoffensive and generally useless one of the
lot. In fact, it is about the most reliable
scheme yet devised for producing a Parlia-
ment of time-serving nincompoops.
The N.S.W. Select Committee which is in-
quiring why State-built houses cost like
Queen Anne mansions and look like King
Billy gunyahs, had the Board’s former archi-
tect before it the other day. He put his con-
clusions briefly:—
In some cases the wages had come to about double
what they should have done, partly on account of in-
crease in rates since the estimates were made, and
partly on account of slow work. The principal reason
was the small amount of work the men did.
The gospel of slow work was invented to
make the jobs go round; unfortunately it
doesn’t help to make the houses go round.
Go-slow in cottage-building will be a suc-
cess when Labor can find a way of compel-
ling the capitalist to rent the cottage built
Go-slow in cottage-building will be a suc-
cottage which has been built for half the
money. It hasn’t been able to perform the
miracle so far.
This was Sidney Webb, President of the
British Board of Trade, in the course of a
debate about the monotonous way that con-
tracts drift abroad :
In connection with the South African contract, Mr.
IVebb said that if British engineers could not come
nearer than 30 per cent, above foreigners something
was wrong with the industry.
Freetrade, maybe. The Daily Mail Year
Book alleged that at the end of July, 1928,
over 22 per cent, of British engineers and
shipbuilders were out of work; and that
sort of uncertainty isn’t calculated to keep
the best men in the country.
“0.P.H.”: A non-Labor organisation with
more reach, pull and punch than the Gnash
Federation is being sighed for by city men
who are not Laborites, but they do little
more than sigh. For years the principal
contributors to Gnash and Lib. party funds
have been metropolitan magnates, and some
of these are getting tired. The weariness
has grown more noticeable since Lib. and
Gnash Governments took to sending abroad
for articles which have been, can be or ought
to be manufactured in the Commonwealth.
What is wanted is an organisation that
would take up the made-in-Austraiia move-
ment and go baldheaded for high Protection.
Such a political undertaking would be
assured of substantial support.
Officials of the Miners’ Federation proudly
announce that levies amounting to £242,02S
were paid last year, mostly by 16,000 mem-
bers for the support of the 8000 engaged
in the latest and stupidest Maitland
(N.S.W.) strike. The A.W.TJ. has never
stated what its equally fatuous revolt against
the 1922 Powers award cost in strike pay,
etc., but it couldn’t have been much less
than the expenditure on the tomfoolery in
the Maitland district. The extent of that
lamentable outlay has been cited as a proof
that the miners (many of whom paid the
levy most unwillingly) are devoted to the
Kawse. What it really proves is that these
big unions control enormous financial re-
sources—resources which might be expended
for the good of the members and the com-
munity instead of being dissipated in idiotic
strikes.
Premier Theodore told interviewers in
London that he hadn’t yet appointed a new
Agent-General in Fihelly’s place. He might
have added that, Australian Labor Premiers
having long since surrendered to the party
machine the right to fill billets like the one
in question, he was likely to have precious
little say in the matter —or none at all, if
the choice is made before he returns to
Brisbane.
A note from New Australia: —
Three months ago I told The Bulletin —we were
then in the midst of another revolution—that just
about all this colony (anyway, the old whites and
the all-white ParagUayan-born) could be got for
Australia if Australia wanted good, hard settlers
and would pa}' the cost of shifting us. Of course
we have heard nothing about it; and the only one
who can afford to up sticks and shift himself is
tired of waiting and will leave here for Australia
with this letter. And, curiously enough, he’s not
an Australian but a Welshman. His luck is that
he hasn’t been here long enough to lose all his
money, though the recent revolution told him what
he might expect. Incidentally, our dollar is now
worth about Id. English. The last par. I wrote
for The Bulletin brought me in 7s. It seemed
quite a lot when the bank here gave me $77 for it.
When the British Government recognised
the Russian Soviet, which France and the
TJ.S. and Japan still refuse to do, and
appointed James O’Grady, Labor M.P. for a
dingy factory town, as ambassador to Mos-
cow, adverse criticism was probably the last
thing it looked for. But Tcliicherin, Com-
missary of Foreign Affairs, had no use for
this appeal to his simple republican tastes,
and told Britain to keep O’Grady and send
“a well-trained professional diplomat.” Of
the other nine ambassadors whom the Cold
Country sends out seven are Right Hon.
Grand Cross knights, one a Right Hon.
lord, and one a Most Hon. marquess, and
Tchicherin (whom The Bulletin suspects
of being Bruce Smith in disguise) objects to
“injurious differentiation.”
PLOUGHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where the burnt gorse the yellow hillside dapples
With marks like blotted wordg,
And the wild airs are full of falling apples
And crying birds,
Along the whitened stubble, loose manes flowing,
The snorting horses go,
Turning the brown earth for the winter sowing
Of bread that men must grow.
Far off a bell is ringing; and in places
' Shut round with high grey stone
The men with open books and quiet faces
Low words intone—
Old, cryptic words, long lost to use and meaning,
Copied from ancient scrolls —
The haggard day upon the dead days leaning
That men may save their souls.
In the grey wood the leafless boughs are creaking;
White arrows sear the light,
Where ten are dead and fifty wildly seeking
Mercy in flight.
The ploughman pauses on the whitened stubble
And strains a listening ear
Against the wind for the hoarse sounds that trouble
The changing of the year.
Red windfalls in the orchard and the woodland,
Dead murmurings on the hill!
But one must make the furrows in the good land
For the year’s will.
And one must dream of harvest, though the reaping
Be black with scaith and dread —
Oh, song of living ploughs for ages keeping
A mad, red world in bread !

During the past 10 years the City Mutual,
having laid its foundations, has altered out
of recognition. Managing-director Geo.
Crowley, in his most optimistic moments,
could not have expected the expansion re-
corded in the following comparisons over
five-year periods:—

Dec., Premiums. Premiums. etc. Funds.
1908 .. £55,287 £17,000 £19,061 £391,577

1923 .. 338,420 65,453 181,189 2,540,970
Renewal premiums last year were six times
larger than those for 1908, and total
funds have grown more than that. Mean-
while the book value of all assets has moved
in this way : 1908, £396,051; 1913, £717,110;
3918, £1,403,723; 1923, £2,655,102. Some
of the figures in the comparisons do not tally
with those in the introductory table; income
there includes cash bonuses which have been
applied to purchase additional assurance
(£129,754 was so included last year). The
feature of the City Mutual’s growth has
been that all the new business has been won
at comparatively low cost. Ten years ago
nobody would have dreamt that a World
War, instead of crippling life offices, would
have made new opportunities for them both
in business-getting and on the investment
side.
The table which follows shows the increas-
ing volume of new assurances during and
since the war-period and the effect on re-
newal-premium income: —

The expense-rate showed a substantial de-
cline on pre-war performances. Even in
1921, the year of record new business, ex-
penses took only a trifle more than 16 p.e.
of all cash which flowed into the office. Last
year, owing chiefly to the smaller volume of
new assurances written, the all-in cost was
down to 18.6 p.e. New business is the costly
item of life assurance; it is not unusual in
the newer offices for the equivalent of two
years’ premiums on the new policies to be
spent in writing them. The City Mutual,
partly because it is an old, aggressive office
which talks big bonuses, wins its new policy-
holders cheaply—much more cheaply than
some of its bigger competitors. Usually
very little more than three-quarters of the
first year’s premiums is required—that is on
the assumption that a fair charge for old
business is 7 p.c. of renewal premiums, and
that the balance of exes, is reasonably
chargeable against new business. Lately
policy-writing has not been so easy, partly,
no doubt, owing to the competition of the
swarm of canvassers for the younger cos.
Last year the City Mutual, rather than incur
the extra cost, and so “possibly impair the
splendid bonus results,” decided to curtail
its new business operations. This prompts
managing-director Geo. Crowley to remark
that his office has “an old-fashioned idea—
apparently out of date in these disjointed
times —that the interests of policy-holders
should be the first consideration.” The busi-
ness which did go on the books during the
past 12 months cost 85.6 p.c. of first pre-
miums, the calculation being made on the
basis 'already stated. Another accepted
method of dividing expenses is to assume
that new business is 10 times more costly
than old, and on that reckoning the old and
new business expense rates were approxi-
mately 8 p.c. and SO p.c. respectively.
A low expense-rate is one of the principal
producers of life-assurance profits; others
are (1) a mortality experience lower than
that provided for in the premium tables;
and (2) better investment earnings than
were anticipated. Losses by death are
shown in the next comparison:—
1915. . £36,451 | 1918.. £55,534 | 1921.. £47,034
1916.. 30,801 | 1919.. 43,973 i 1922.. 50,284
1917.. 61,333 | 1920.. 34,692 I 1923.. 54.093
Not only are the “lives” of good quality,
but the policy-holders are stickers. Let Geo.
Crowley testify:—
Renewal premiums for 1922 amounted to £291,000.
New business amounted to £77,000. So Hat if there
were no lapses, no surrenders, no deaths, no endow-
ments matured, and every policy-holder paid up, the
renewal premiums for 1923 would have amounted to
£368,000. For the year £54,000 was paid in
death claims, £47,000 was paid for endowments
matured and £27,000 was paid for surrendered
policies-—a total of £128,000. Naturally, of course,
no premiums were paid cn the bulk of the policies
for the year. It is, therefore, with pride and grati-
fication that the directors are able to draw attention
to the fact that the renewal income for the year
amounted to over £338,000. Such a record '.s
probably unparalleled.
The allocation of bonuses also discloses the
type of policy-holder the City Mutual attracts.
Last year £134,853 of bonuses were declared,
and constituents had the right to claim every
penny in cash. All except £sioo (3.7 p.c.)
was left in to buy additional
The City Mutual claims to pay “the high-
est rate of bonus of any life assurance in-
stitution in the British Empire.” Low cost-
and claims-rates do not wholly account for
the big profits. The office has been a pluckier
investor than most; instead of putting the
greater portion of its money into gilt-edged
securities, it has ninned its faith to mort-
gages, and 56 p.c. of all assets was in pro-
perty loans at the latest balance. Here are
further particulars, and also comparisons

Other managements may sniff at the City
Mutual’s securities, but there can be no
objection, provided care is taken in accept-
ing valuations and allowing ample margins.
There have been occasions when Geo. Crow-
ley has taken risks in anticipation of win-
ning good profits; but from actual results
he can at least claim that his judgment in
the end proved sound. Including profits on
sale of securities, investments last year
turned in no less than 7.6 p.c. on average
funds. The directors explain that one rea-
son for “this seemingly large rate of in-
terest is the fact that the assets of the society
are under-stated in the balance-sheet by
hundreds of thousands of pounds.” The
accumulation of these inner reserves—only
£60.000 in a reserve for contingencies is
visible —is gratifying, particularly consider-
ing the amount of profits disbursed each
year. When valuing policies, by the way,
the rate of investment earnings assumed is
only 31 p.c., and the fact of that rate being
so greatly exceeded is the principal explana-
tion of the large bonuses. Funds at Decem-
ber 31, 1922, were £267. , 000 in excess of the
actuary’s requirement for policies, and the
visible accumulated profit at that date was
more than 12 p.c. on funds. Only £134.000
was extracted for bonuses, and the balance of
£133,000 was left in reserve.

After a successful run for 14 years from its
establishment —with regular dividends of
at least 10 p.e.—Sargent’s has had a
wretched year. The management explained
that the poor results for the .Tune half were
caused by higher prices of commodities, wage
increases and heavier rents. They lifted
the minimum charge to tea-room customers,
and anticipated that this extra bit would be
“reflected in a satisfactory manner” in the
next accounts. Instead, the co. has gone
from bad to worse; for the six months ended
December £149,805 of gross profits showed a
margin of only £2762, and when provision
had been made for taxes the accounts showed
a loss of a couple of hundred pounds. r lhe
directors were not talkative in their report;
they remarked that business had been well
maintained, but “the increase in the mini-
mum charge proved insufficient to cover the
increased expenditure and show a satisfac-
tory net profit.” Shareholders were not
satisfied with the explanation; the annual
meeting was stormy, and eventually ap-
pointed a committee of five “business-men”
shareholders, led by F. W. Stoddart (Sydney
managing-director of Robert Reid and Co.),
to investigate the eo.’s affairs and report to
an adjourned meeting. The committee con-
sists of F. W. Stoddart, Geo. Bridges, W.
Mclntosh, J. Bell and E. Lindsay Thompson.
The co. had its beginnings in a little pie-
shop in the near-suburb of Paddington, where
the late George Sargent and his capable wife
established the biggest catering connection in
Sydney. Old hands in Sussex-street can still
recall the days when George Sargent had to
pay cash down for his half-ton lots of flour.
In 1909 the business was sold to a public co.
for £60,000—50,000 £1 shares and £lO,OOO
cash—and the purchase price included
£45,000 for goodwill. Mr. and Mrs. Sargent
continued in control, and they developed it
on such sound lines that, after paying 10 p.c.
p.a. regularly every half-year, by 1915 suf-
ficent reserves had accumulated to cover the
whole of the goodwill consideration. By
1922 £21,000 of visible reserves had accumu-
lated after goodwill had been written out of
the accounts and £25,000 had been capi-
talised. These magnificent results were due
wholly to good management, including excep-
tionally careful buying; for though the Sar
gents had sold out to a co., they gave as
much attention to detail .as in the early
years of the little pie-business. Until a few
months prior to his death practically every
pound of foodstuff which went into the Sar-
gent factories was ordered by and passed
under the eye of George Sargent, and the
trade knew better than to attempt to sell
him inferior grades or charge a farthing more
than contract prices. Sussex-street fre-
quently met him on the kerbstone awaiting
the opening of the day’s business so that he:
could buy to the best advantage. Practically
every corner of the big business received
similar scrutiny. Nowadays wholesalers
have the acquaintance of three buyers. How
much depended on George Sargent has now
become apparent; probably it is too much to
expect that the directors can find as brilliant
a successor to control the co.’s affairs.
Possibly the investigating committee will
discover that, especially under the changed
conditions, the co. has over-reached itself in
the directors’ policy of rapid expansion. Here
are comparisons of balance-sheet figures go-
ing back to the first accounts :
1909. 1914. 1919. 1923.

Note the expansion of the property item.
The directors have been so active buying
premises that that account is now £9200
larger than paid capital. Though £79,000
has been raised on mortgage, so much funds
have been required for the purchases that,
to run its cafe operations, the directors at
December 31 last were leaning on other-
creditors for £78,766. and. taking taxation
commitments into calculation, floating debt
exceeded the £46,378 in stocks, book debts
and other more or less liquid assets by no
less than £34,388. That aspect of recent
developments will, no doubt, receive the
attention of the investigating committee. The
quick expansion of the business, coupled with
other features, may be responsible for the set-
back. Incidentally, it may also account for
the proposal, which lias been talked of in
Melbourne, to float that end of the concern
into a separate co; Whatever is done about
that, the first essential is a thoroughly
efficient management which can control every
cost. That was the rock on which Hart’s,
the old A.B.C. and many others split. Sar-
gent’s was until recently the only big Sydney
catering concern run by a public co. which
had steered clear of the troubles that others
in the trade had encountered.

Last year’s profits were below the recent
average; nevertheless, the directors lifted the
div. a half-point. Before electric competition
cut into the hydraulic field, this co. paid
10 p.c. regularly, but the rate declined first
to 8 p.c. and then to 6 p.c. and, though it
has recovered a little, for some years the
undertaking has earned less than share-
holders’ funds would produce were they in-
vested in mortgages or some gilt-edged secu-
rities. The net profit for the past 12 months,
after providing for taxation, gave only a
little more than 6 p.c. on capital and re-
serves. This is not a cheerful position for an
industrial undertaking. Heavy working costs
seem to have made profit-earning more diffi-
cult. in 1915 57.7 p.c. of gross revenue went
in exes, and taxes; last year the co. collected
£lB2 for every £lOO received in 1915, but
costs, including unspecified provisions for
renewals, soared to 72.8 p.c. of the larger
income. Here are further comparisons:—

1915.. 24,074 13,898 | 1923.. 43,794 31,870
The co. may be doing relatively better than
the figures in the introductory table suggest;
prior to 1918 allowance was made for. re-
newals out of disclosed profits, but now that
charge is included with working costs, etc.
Anyway, larger profits should be made, be-
cause a little additional capital has been put
to work—a couple of years ago new plant
was installed to meet the demand for
hydraulic-power for wool-dumping—and
there are said to be reserves of £66,000 to
help earnings for £120,000 of paid capital.
Only £51,000 of reserves are shown by the
introductory table, Parliamentary rights and
concessions with a book value of £15,000 not
having been treated as assets. Reserves in-
clude £40,000 which has lain in a plant and
contingency account for many years, but
whether this is a real reserve—in other
words, whether the plant, mains and other
assets are to-day worth £50,000 more than
the capital—is not ascertainable. On re-
sults they are not. In their reports the
directors say very little except as to the dis-
posal of profits and to assure shareholders
that works and mains are in good order.
They do not discuss operations, hence no
explanation is offered of the rather serious
falling-off of revenue for the past 12 months.
Practically all shareholders’ funds are
sunk in the undertaking. Here are com-

debts, investments and cash over and above
creditor accounts. Freehold premises had a
book value of £34,234, and machinery, plant
and mains £127,405.

Accounts are now presented once instead of
twice each year, and for purposes of com-
parison the table has been recast to show
results for periods of 12 months. The earlier
entries go back to the time when the co. was
suffering the effects of a Board-room up-
heaval, but divs. soon recovered to the 10
p.c. rate which had previously been paid and
which has been the regular cut for share-
holders through the boom and slump in the
leather trade. Reserves have not visibly
benefited much after paying divs., but the
co. is a better proposition for its shareholders
because it is giving them 10 p.c. on a much
larger capital. Here are balance-sheet com-
parisons over two five-year periods

A lot of the new capital went in Remodelling
and extending city premises and in trans-
ferring factory operations to the suburbs, the
directors having decided that they could do
better by letting portion of the warehouse.
So far profits have not responded ; perhaps it
would be fairer to say that the effect of the
move saved a heavier decline than the
accounts have .shown, but no evidence is ten-
dered on that point. Since the slump, trade
has been erratic and working costs have
pressed harder. Last year the markets for
raw materials are reported to have been
favorable and the local demand for manu-
factures was “well maintained,” but there
was not much demand for export, and that
is where the sweet titbits of profit are won.

. The makings of one of the biggest booms
in recent years in the base-metal section is
in evidence in Sydney. Some weeks ago
the whole of the scrip in Mt. Isa Mines,
Ltd., went off in a few days. Though not
yet listed on ’Change, shares have been
traded in at steadily appreciating prices,
though so far general-manager St. Smith
(formerly, Queensland Government geologist)
and W. H. Corbould have not had time to
make development endorse the glittering
prospects of surface indications. Mt. Isa

offering 80,000 shares of ss. each, and secre-
tary 11. B. Jamieson announces that during

cations for 225,800 shares were received.

due on March 10. G. iJ. Rodda has been
appointed manager, and he leaves for the
field this week to commence development.

which hitherto went to De Bavay’s, The
accumulated dump slimes, Which have given
magnificent profits, . are now almost ex-
hausted, and the slime-flotation plant is
to be switched on to the huge dumps of
zinc slimes.
The fire position at the B. H. Central is
thought to be much easier. Inspections have
been made with a view to devising means of
isolating the south end of the mine and work-
ing the northern stopes, which are free from
fire and can be. easily kept clear of gas. It
will be a tough job, but £35 for lead is a
prize worth going after,

A float with a high-sounding name, the
Carabost Dredging and Mining Exploration
Co., N.L., is before the public in Sydney
proposing to (1) purchase leases and dredge
for gold on Carabost Creek, near Tum-
barumba (N.S.W.) ; (2) take over
the Bethanga mines and tailings, near
Wodonga (Vie.) ; and (3) become an “ex-
ploration co. as well as an actual mining
co.” The lure in the Carabost area is that
“in this locality enormously rich gold de-
posits have been recovered, notably at the
Old American Yards, and it is apparent
even to the lay mind that gold in payable
quantities must be won.” The leases have
previously not been worked to any extent
owing, the prospectus states, to the opposi-
tion of local pastoralists, who feared sluic-
ing operations would pollute the creek. These
objections “have now been satisfactorily
overcome.” At the extreme southern end
of the leases Onus and Green report an
average depth of 6ft. and an average value
of (6s. per yd). At the north end
the average value was Is. per yd., but the
promoters believe that they missed the main
channel, and they arrive at conclusions de-
pendent on nothing more tangible than such
phrases as “it is only reasonable, to assume”
and “local opinion is that the flats are very
rich.” All this may warrant a little pros-
pecting syndicate seeking capital to estab-
lish values definitely, but there is not much
to justify a £50.000 co. making a plunge
more or less in the dark and allotting half
of its shares as fully-paid to vendors and
promoters, besides undertaking to pay away
£740 of the cash to be subscribed.
The second string to the float is the
Bethanga, which was shut down years ago
owing to treatment difficulties. For an out-
lay of £650 the Carabost people believe they
can tackle the 30.000 tons tailings at the
mine and recover 72.4 p.c. (15s. 9d.) of their
values at a cost of ss. 9d. per ton. They
expect to win a thousand profit per month,
and propose to spend half of it on re-opening
the mine and “turning it into one of the
premier producing gold-mines of Victoria.”
Assays of some of the ore stacked in the
bottom level went 83s. 3d. gold and 4s. 6d.
silver, but copper and arsenic have been the
bugbears. The promoters claim that they
have a process which will recover 90 p.c.
of values in the ore. A refractory gold-silver
show and an alluvial-gold proposition are a
strange mixture for a single float.
* * * *
New Red, White and Blue, Bendigo, be-
gins a new half-year with improved pros-
pects. . On the 1600 ft. level there are three
formations: a centre reef in a big slate bed,
extensively stoped some years ago to about
400 ft. south; the slate veins about 40ft.
west, where the slate bed adjoins a big sand-
stone bed, and in which are the sandstone
spurs. Most of the divs. of the last two
years came from the rich slate veins which
have been driven on for 1300 ft. southward
and are all stoped out above that level. In
opening out west from these, at 800 ft. south,
the sandstone spurs were first cut, and the
two formations were worked together. Best
results were got north and south of the No.
3 shaft at 1100 ft. This work produced many
divs. and was responsible for the boom in
the shares, but towards the middle of last
year the gold in the slate veins suddenly cut
out and resulted in a slump. Nevertheless,
the mine lias been battling on these spurs,
but divs. have been scarce. The feature of
last half-year’s work was the opening up of
spurs nearer the mainshaft by west cross-
cuts from the old stopes on the centre reef
at 40ft. up. At 400 ft. south a width of 54ft.
of spurs has been exposed, and side-stoping
and driving are giving about half of the
weekly output of 700 tons. The grade here
must be nearly half an ounce. At 500 ft.
south another crosscut has just entered the
body, and values so far are as good. A cross-
cut has also heen started opposite the shaft.
On the 1500 ft. level the main crosscut went
through what is evidently the top of these
spurs, but they were of low value. At 150 ft.
south, however, they gave a trial value of
sdwt. Further work on this level for some
reason was not persisted in. On the whole,
prospects for the crosscut 60ft. lower down
are bright. Already the results at 400 ft.
assure some years of work. Similar results
opposite the shaft would extend the life of
the mine considerably, and enhance prospects
northward. Some work is also being started
southward below the 1600 ft. level on the
slate veins, where gold went underfoot. This
work may help divs. in the near future.
Costs have been surprisingly low at 245. per
ton; good management has, perhaps, been
helped by a big proportion of the tonnage
having been won from sill work, which has
not involved much timbering or mullocking.
# * * *
In the South R., W. and Blue, Bendigo, a
big change has taken place in the structure,
due to the crosscourse which cuts through
the beds about 300 ft. south of the New Red’s
boundary. A prolonged and expensive search
for the slate veins and the sandstone spurs
proved unavailing, and efforts are now being
made to locate the centre reef.

J. Langdon’s skill at Bendigo A.I. could
not prevent a loss of £2OOO-odd last half-
year, and it looks as if the old New Moon
block of country will have to be abandoned.
Before Dyason got his grip upon the ground
it had paid £371,000 in divs. in response to
calls of £11,500. Down to 1300 ft. the shoots
had been attacked in a most persistent way,
and development had been done down
to 2400 ft. Dyason would not have got the
old claim if yields had not been tapering off.
Eventually he passed the show on to George
Dickenson’s office, with one of the “Money”
Millers in the chair. More than £26,000 has
gone into development, and several runs of
gold have also kept things going. As a last
shot, Langdon came up to 260 ft. and 614 ft.,
but lie has had no luck there. Returns ran
out at an average of about lldwt. for the
six months, but there was not sufficient stone
available to make up one decent crushing.
The State is in the show for £lO,OOO.
* * * *
Absence of early winter rains held up
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), and pad-
dock No. 38 could not be got out of the way
until well into January. When rain came
Hugh Falconer kept the plant working at
full capacity. His first patch gave 443,000
c. yd., from which were won 3512|0z. gold
and 571 tons tin oxide. Income was £22,738,
and a profit of only £402 came from six
months’ hard going. That should be more
than compensated for by returns from the
final January wash-up, because much of the
cost of handling that ground was covered
by work done prior to closing the latest
accounts. Besides, old hands had delved in
the wasli included in the first-clean-up; they
had pulled out all the gold from the 50ft.
and 70ft. floors, leaving only the 90ft. floor
intact. The whole of the paddock washed
up for 707,000 c. yd., and 61230 z. gold
and 90 tons oxide was the final
count. The plant is now being hustled
to the lower stretch of the gutter
to test the deeper runs of wash bored there.
Years of work are ahead, but costs will be
heavier unless Falconer’s scheme of bringing
coal from the Riverina colliery makes a big
saving in the fuel bill.

The Radio, north of Bullfinch (W.A.),
is a much-sampled show, and it responds
satisfactorily on every occasion. The latest
to have a look have been Bestwick. of Adel-
aide, and Giblin, of the White Hope, who
recently made a joint inspection for Adel-
aide. They voice the general opinion that
it is a good mine, but that the £40,000 asked
for it is too stiff. The two prospector-
owners continue to make about £BOOO a year
each from small crushings, so just at pre-
sent there does not appear any likelihood of
their accepting less than the £40,000.
* * * *
The Perth syndicate which has been work-
ing the May Queen, Southern Cross, under
option, is pleased with the result of its first
trial crushing. A parcel of 22 tons aver-
aged almost 50z., including 12dwt. in the
tails. Nevertheless, that is less than the
average won during the past 10 years. The
owners state that their only reason for want-
ing to sell is that an air-compressing plant
is necessary to deal with the hard country
now containing the lode.
Gnow’s Nest (W.A.), a small producer in
which several well-known Perth and Kal-
goorlie speculators are interested, has appa-
rently taken a new lease of life. Good re-
turns were obtained for a year or two, and
then the shoot cut out. Now it has evidently
been picked up again in deeper ground, and
several thousand pounds’ worth of gold has
been won in the last few months. Produc-
tion to date amounts to about £55,000, and
shareholders have divided £lO,OOO.
* * * *
Paringa and Lanarkshire still potter about
in shallow ground at Siberia (W.A.), where
hard country and impoverished reefs have
impeded successful mining at depth. Both
cos. may win small crushings from near the
surface, hut on present appearances that will
be practically their limit.
Adelaide is trying to stir up a mild boom
with King of Creation scrip. The King holds
an option over the White Horseshoe, Parker’s
Range (W.A.), a show which looks a good
proposition for a small -working party, but
whose ore deposit is too small to give much
hope of profitable operations by a co.
Mt. Clear View, near the Cape River
goldfield (Q.), whose prospects looked rosy
early last year, is in temporary difficulties,
and will probably be forced into exemption
until further funds are provided. Under
favorable conditions this mine could go
ahead with its crushing plant, but as it
lias no water and is in an isolated position
further reserves of ore arc considered neces-
sary to justify expenditure on plant. The
co. has three lodes, and the biggest averages
sft. thick and probably Bdwt. per ton. Funds
arc wanted to seek its junction with the
No. 3 lode in the hope of getting a bigger
ore-body carrying payable values. Mt. Clear
View is an impressive low-grade proposition,
but costs are likely to be pretty high.
* * * *
Mt. Nolan, at Silver Valley, Herberton
(N.Q.), is keeping up its reputation, and
looks one of the best tin shows in the district.
The stopes average about 18in. of ore rang-
ing from 15 p.c. to 25 p.c. The No. 4
level encourages hope in depth. For 70ft.
driving is in ore practically all the way,
the ore-body ranging from a few inches to
sft., with values averaging about 15 p.c.
Prospects are decidedly good.
Conditions for tin-mining are good at
Kangaroo Mills (N.Q.), the recent heavy
rains having filled the dams. There have
been no startling discoveries lately, and pro-
duction has slowed down. The Canary is
stoping its rich, narrow shoot of 35 p.c. ore,
and it should be a regular producer for the
rest of the year, the shoot having been proved
to a depth of 185 ft. The Sardine eased off
lately to push development w r ork and erect
overhead plant. The Shrimp has hardly
come up to expectations.
* * * *
Many Peaks (Q.), which used to supply
fluxes to Mount Morgan, is hoping for a
revival. Tom Mills, of Charters Towers,
whose name recalls the efforts to locate the
ore body outside the Mt. Morgan pegs, has
been looking up Glassford Creek and the
Apple Tree areas, and announces that he is
“impressed with the richness of the ore-
bodies in both.” A Gladstone syndicate is
also meandering in the same locality on the
lookout for options. The New Cannindah
copper-mine, near Many Peaks, proposes to
commence operations shortly. The new rail-
way to Mon to passes close to the mine, and
this has influenced the decision to re-open.
There is a large brecciated-slate formation
containing extensive lenses of copper which
are amongst the richest known ore bodies in
the State.
Chairman “Mick” O’Keefe, M.L.A., has
reported to the Speck’s Parliament the re-
sult of his Select Committee’s inquiry into
the diseases peculiar to miners and metal-
lurgical workers in Tas. The suggestion to
extend the Workers’ Compensation Act to
cover these diseases did not meet with favor
from the bulk of the witnesses examined.
They preferred a separate fund, such as that
which general-manager Gepp has in opera-
tion at the Risdon Zinc Works. So the
committee recommends that such a fund
should be established by the Government,
and, where the nature of the work warrants
it. every worker should compulsorily con-
tribute 6d., the employer Is., and the Govern-
ment Is. per week per man employed, the
fund to be devoted to the maintenance of
stricken workers and their dependants. Other
recommendations: Compulsory X-ray exam-
ination of all mining and metallurgical
workers; sanatorium treatment for incipient
cases; prohibition of “man-killer” (tele-
scopic) drill; machines having water-jets to
be operated by two men ; and shorter hours
to be made compulsory for those engaged in
metallurgical and certain other occupations.
Tassy’s Labor Government has the will to
give effect to all these things, but at present
it reigns on sufferance, and may have to
go slow.
Thanks to the Lyeli group, copper again
headed the list in the Speck’s mineral output
for 1923, 6064 tons of the red metal giving
£435,413. Tin came next with £235,955
from 2160 tons. Then lead, £127.542 (4785
tons) ; limestone. £122,428 (99,113 tons) ;
silver. £91,339 (636,8050 z.) ; coal, £70,797
(80.718 tons) ; and carbide. £64,720 (3236
tons). Osmiridium (673.4230 z.) furnished
£19,642. The. Electrolytic Zinc works re-
covered 41,153 tons zinc worth £1.293.422,
and 107 tons of cadmium worth £27,551.

SOCIETY
"and it's
printed with
WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Schnorrer”: No wonder the arguments
about how Easter is determined are more
heated than usual this year. The English
Prayerbook lays it down that Easter Day
falls on the Sunday following the first full
moon on or after March 21. If this were
taken at face value Easter Day this year
would fall on March 23, a full moon being
visible in the early morning hours of March
21. But the ecclesiastical full moon differs
slightly from the real one; the church runs
a table of its own to say when the orb is
full and doesn’t care a trousers button about
the astronomers or the almanac. The atten-
tion paid to the moon in determining church
festivals and observances is obviously of
Jewish origin. By the Jewish calendar the
year is composed of 12 moons of alternately
29 and 30 days. To adjust the difference
between the calendar and the actual year the
Jews have a leap-year also, only the Jew-
ish leap-year comes so seldom that it con-
tains an extra month instead of an extra day.
This year is one of them, and instead of there
being only one month of Adar there are two
-Adar I. and Adar 11. The feast of Purim
falls this year in Adar 11., pushed back, like
all the other feasts, for. a month, to conform
to the orthodox seasons. The Christian
Easter conforms with the same juggle.

“777”: Re queer self-in dieted won.ids. I
can tell of one lot which kept the recipient
from his eagerly-anticipated Paris leave,
instead of withdrawing him from the line.
After cleaning his tunic collar with petrol
from an innocent-
looking bottle, the
Digger donned the
jacket and forth-
with became tres
beaucoup malade.
His neck and face
took on the color
of boiled beetroot,
partial blindness
set in, and his
lungs were affected.
Inves t i g a-
tion showed that
the bottle, which
had been discarded
by the H.Q. gas
officer, still con-
tained a trace of
liquid mustard
gas. The result
was a period in
hospital and a
souvenir in the
shape of a badly-
burned and scarred
neck, and a set of deranged internals which
took a long time to cure. I was the owner
of them.

“8.V.E.” : I can tell an even queerer story
of soldiers’ “doubles” (B. 21/2/’24). In Lon-
don, towards the end of 1917, a well-sozzled
Digger was arrested by the red-caps without
papers, identity disc, etc. Instead of being
delivered over to the A.l.F.’s H.Q. when
sobered up, he was sent, to his amazement,
under armed escort to the H.Q. of the 31st
Surreys. There he was charged with desertion,
and, despite his protestations, was actually
committed for trial by General Court-Martial.
Two days before the trial came off the din-
kum deserter was brought in, having
given himself up to the civil police.
His tale of being bludgeoned and robbed, and
of three weeks spent in a hospital, was veri-
fied, and he got off lightly. When the Digger,
who had been overwhelmed with apologies
for the injustice done him, was brought face
to fa.ee with the Tommy, he ceased to wonder
at the mix-up. They were as alike as two
peas. And it turned out quite natural that
they should be. The aunt of the Tommy dis-
covered that the Digger's mother was lur
sister, who had emigrated to Australia some
20 years before, leaving one lad for the aunt
aforesaid to look after and bring up. That
lad was the Tommy; the Digger was his
twin brother!

“Harold Hardupp”: The old Sydney
School of Arts in Pitt-street is to disappear
soon. The land uuon which it stands was
NEXT DOOR TO PERFECTION.
“Like my new bathing-cloak, Jimmy?”
“My word! Stunning! It’s nearly as good as nothing, isn’t it?"
a gift (for use only) of a long-ago Govern-
ment ; last year the Fuller Ministry bestowed
on the trustees a couple of blocks elsewhere
as a sort of hint that mid-city improvements
call for the passing of the old rambling
building. The Debating Club which is
attached to the “School” trained a number
of men who afterwards loomed large in public
affairs. One of them was George Reid, who
was so nervous and self-conscious a speaker
when he first tackled the game that his em-
barrassment, added to the quakiness of his
voice, made him the jest of his fellows. _ A
great number of movements, some of which
have made history, were started in the old
hall —the Women’s Franchise League among
them. But not all of them lived. The Hus-
bands’ Rights Association,' for instance,
failed to get a quorum at the second meeting.

“Arev”: It's dangerous to assume that
people will recognise your sex from your hand-
writing. A young friend of mine (feminine)
noted an advertisement: “Lady or gentleman
offered holiday on farm ; fresh eggs, milk and
cream in plenty ; drives.” Thinking it would
suit her, the girl applied, prefacing her surname
with her initials only. An answer came to
the effect that the farmer’s wife would be
pleased to receive the applicant, but that
accommodation was already taxed to the
utmost. “However,” the writer continued,
“my son is sleeping out in a van. If you
decide to come, you can share his quarters.”
The young lady lias since developed the habit
of signing her letters with full Christian
names.
* * *• *
“Dircke Jansen”: When Joseph Weller,
one of two brothers who established the first
whaling station on the Otago (M.L.) coast,
died in 1835. his remains were preserved in a
puncheon of rum for shipment to Sydney.
This is the only instance on record as far
as I know of this form of embalming in this
part of the world. The American whaler Sus-
liannah brought the captain’s body to Sydney.
The method of preservation was apparently
not uncommon in the eighteenth century
when the illustrious defunct had died on
some distant station. Nautical tradition
even traces the heartening word “grog” to
this source ; also the now obsolete euphemism
for the illicit imbibing of alcoholic liquor,
“tapping the governor.” In 1778, or there-
abouts, when England was at war with
France, one Monsieur Guillaume Roussel,
Governor of Guadaloupe, died at his post
and was shipped for France in the manner
aforementioned. On the rum puncheon was
painted “Guillaume Roussel, obit Guada-
loupe,” and round the lead that was nailed
over the bung were the initials G.R.O.G.
The Vessel carrying this bit of cargo was
captured by an English man-o’-war ami a
prize crew placed aboard, ihey tapped tin-
cask with gimlets and smacked their
over the contents. I know, of course, that
there is a tradition linking the word with
“Old Grog” (Admiral Vernon), who wore
“grogram” and diluted the sailor s rum,
but, anyway, the other is a picturesque story.
“Kip”: The recent discoveries in the
Valley of the Kings recall to me my own
humble explorations
in the catacombs at
Matarieh, situate
close to the Zeitoun
camp. This ancient
cemetery was divided
into two sections, one
for the rich, the other
for the poor. The
former had been ex-
ploited with success
by an American syn-
dicate. The latter
probably never con-
tained anything of
value; but it was
known that beads and
bits of pottery were
still to be found there.
It was a broiling hot
afternoon when I set
out on my souvenir
hunt. Having dis-
carded my tunic, I
hopped into a vent,
and was soon crawl-
in g on all fours
thro u g h narrow,
lioneycomb-like tun-
nels. An hour’s search
having yielded only a
few beads, I forced
my way through a
much narrower corri-
dor leading to another
vent, and presently
found myself so firmly
wedged in that I
could move neither
backward nor for-
war d. Perspiration
streamed from me,
and I tore into the
earth with my finger-
nails. Soon, to my
unutterable relief, I
unearthed a w e 11-
conditioned leg-bone,
once, doubtless, the
possession of some bygone Gyppo. Not much
of an excavation tool, certainly, but patient
use of it gave me my freedom at close on
nightfall.
“Jonah”: The Commonwealth steamships
carry only one class of passengers now. It
was the easiest way out of a difficulty, for
iu a floating republic different classes are
troublesome. The Bay liners have always
been republican. The salooners had their
own recreation-room —at least, they had it
in theory; but the stewards dropped in to
fraternise when off duty, and to take an
interest in the game. It was quite common
to hear the remark from a friendly disli-
carrier : “I’d play that card, miss, if I were
you.” Each ship being a sort of Soviet at
sea, with the cook and steward comrades as
the principal element of the organisation, the
navigating section put up with many things,
and took extra pay to make up for lost dig-
nity. Those passengers who were not of the

JACK: “ What do you do when anyone hisses

JILL : “Oh, I leave them to find out for
themselves.”
rough-and-ready or homely or bottle-throw-
ing kind put up with many things likewise,
including very stern language when they
chanced to be late for meals, or otherwise
offended. And as things were getting more
so instead of less so, it was considered best
to close up the saloon end of the business
before some humorist-at-sea wrote a book
about it.

ARDATH TOBACCO CO., LTD., LONDON.
ATeames” : A Sun cable about the treason-
trial of Ludendorff and the rest of the
Bavarian monarchists took me back nearly
quarter of a century:—
The impression remaining- is that it was a debat-
ing society discussing the relative degrees of the
patriotism displayed by strange individuals of rather
limited intelligence rather than a court of justice.
It was almost impossible to believe that the accused,
sitting at case surrounded by lawyers, were being
tried on a. capital charge, or that a really serious
punishment would be inflicted.
No better pen-picture could have been sup-
plied of the trial in London of the Jameson
raiders. Ludendorff, we learn, looked fat
and tired and shabby. So did Jameson.
Clad in a dusty old lounge suit, he dozed
even while Sir Edward Clarke was thundering
within a few feet of him. But the other
accused were typical soldiers of fashion,
wearing the frock-coats and Malmaison
button-holes of the period, and as much at
ease in the dock as if it had been the
Guards’ Club. The galleries were crammed
with peeresses and other influential women,
and altogether the atmosphere was that of a
social gathering which was honoring a num-
ber of famous men —the lions, of course,
being the prisoners. Ludendorff and his
friends may get nominal sentences, as some
of the Jameson raiders did, but even so re-
mission will quickly follow', as it did in the
other case, it would save a lot of time,
costs and wear and tear on lawyers’ jaws
if nations recognised once and for all that
kaisers are never hanged by the ordinary
processes of law.
The office curate on a Church matter: —
A London cable of last .week quoted the new
“Crockford” as estimating that “the number of Angli-
can clergy under 35 years of age throughout the
country does not exceed 1000. Unless the number
of ordinations is much increased, it will soon be
QUITE SAFE.
“Aren’t you frightened to have your dog sleeping in your bed
with you?”
“Dear me, no! I asked the vet., and he says it will not harm
him a bit.”
impossible to carry on the. present parochial system.”
America has lately had a remarkable revival of
enthusiasm for missionary work in China. Divines
of all ages are offering. One explanation is that
it is easier to live cheaply and comfortably in China
than in the U.S.A., while there are large sums to
be made by dealing in silks, jade, curios, etc.
According to the American Mercury, many mission-
aries have found the business of exporting Chinese
goods to the U.S. so lucrative that they have retired
from the church altogether. For those who remain
there is the consideration that no controversies
about Fundamentalism ever penetrate to China
to discredit them in the eyes oi their flock. They
remain, first and last, what religious teachers should
be—unchallenged autocrats on the spiritual side.
There is a lesson here for wilting churches. A living
wage and an uncritical outlook are first essentials
in the chancelleries of Paradise.
THE CATCH IN IT.
“John, it is so considerate of you to have
your life insured for my benefit!”
“Yes, my dear; but remember, if you drive
me to suicide you won’t get a farthing
under this policy.”
“Veedee II.” : In the matter of stiff luck,
consider the case of our padre (we were
Enzeds). He was remarking, a day or so
before the Armistice, on his good fortune in
having come through the piece without a
scratch. His dug-out that night was on the
side of a small hill, at the top of which
were parked some laden limbers. The padre
was about 6ft. 4in. long, and overflowed out
of the dug-out by about a yard. During the
night, a limber broke its moorings and
backed down the slope, and a couple of
wheels skipped across two clerical shins.
Result: One pair of broken legs and 12
months in hospital.
* * * *
“Jack S.” : The kiddies at Port Stephens
(N.S.W.) seldom see a big boat, although
the harbor is the deepest on the coast-line.
They are much more familiar with motor-
cars, the place being a favorite resort for
fishermen. Most of the traffic on the water
is done by small steam launches, and con-
sequently when a hefty paddle-steamer came
in recently with a load of excursionists from
Newcastle the youngsters assembled in
massed formation. Luck was against _ the
skipper; in drawing up to the wharf he
struck a pile, vßesult —a smashed paddle-
wheel case. In high falsetto C. sharp came
a voice out of the crowd : “Hey, mister, ycr
mudguard’s broken.”
“Bouragi”: The other day a number of
Solomon Islanders avlio years ago were taken
to Samoa by the
Germans passed
through Sydney
bound for their
native land. Some
were returning
with Samoan wives
and families born
and brought up
under the fairly-
civilised conditions
of Polynesian
Samoa. What the
fate of these people
will be when they
cast up in their old
homes I doiti't
know; but remem-
bering some inci-
dents of the
Kanaka repatria-
tion from Queens-
land 16 years or so
ago, it seems to me
they are taking
chances. No doubt
a lot of change has
been brought
about in the Solo-
mons since those
days; nevertheless
I wouldn’t like to
be one of the re-
turning wanderers,
or. for that matter, to be the officer respon-
sible for the bright idea of returning them
to those isles of ill-repute.
“J. 8.”: Re Jewish methods of killing
animals for food. I agree with “Runic” (B.
14/2/’24) that Gentiles have nothing to learn
therefrom, except what to avoid. As a medi-
cal student in Edinburgh I had the
privilege of accompanying Sir Henry Little-
john, Prof, of Public Health, on his visits
to the abattoirs, and was struck by the bru-
tality of the Jewish method. An Admiralty
Commission appointed to investigate humane
slaughtering recommended some years ago that
all animals should be stunned or otherwise
rendered unconscious before blood is drawn.
The knife the Jewish butcher uses may be as
merciful as the pithing spear, pole-axe or
hammer —-though even this is doubtful —but
to witness the hapless animal’s struggles
while it is being roped or chained, pulled
down to the- floor and frequently dragged
along it is a harrowing business. Apart
from this, there is a hygienic objection. It
is well established that under the influence
of fear and distress toxins are rapidly
formed in the body, and these, circulating
throughout the system, have a deleterious
effect upon the flesh of the animal. In such
cases meat putrifies more quickly than it
would otherwise. I have brought the cruelty
of the Jewish method of killing before the
S.P.C.A. in three Australian capitals, but
have always been asked not to press the
matter, as the Jewish element in the society
is so strong; indeed, there were Rabbis in
two of the bodies I approached.
“Mudurup” : Few of the scribes who have
been chronicling the arrival of the British
Squadron at Fremantle have omitted to men-
tion that the last official visit of this kind to
Westralia was made in 1881, when one of
the warships was lI. M S. Bacchante, which
carried Prince (now King) George and his
elder brother. Prince Edward, who died some
10 years later. Years ago, in the Perth
Public Library, I came across a book of ram-
bling reminiscences, by a W.A. clergyman
of that era, containing a rather startling
item about our present Sovereign's first jaunt
to these shores. According to that writer,
the two Princes went ashore at Albany for a
day’s kangaroo shooting. Returning to their
ship at nightfall they somehow got cut off
from their companions, and ran into a mob
of local larrikins, who. unaware of
the identity of the illustrious stran-
gers, pursued them with the sparkling
wit and playful persiflage of the larrikin cult
till the bewildered lads had regained the Bac-
chante. The story must have had some cur-
rency at the time, although it is rather
difficult to associate the larrikin nuisance,
even in its mildest form, with a tiny seaport
like the Albany of the early ’eighties.
“Links” : Sydney has a habit of mislaying
things, but the police sometimes dig them up
when they are wanted. A man with an art-
union motor-car has camped daily for
months —it seems like years—on the tiled
paving in front of the Customs House. The
police regarded him with disfavor as a blot
upon the landscape, but he seemed perfectly
within his rights. Then some investigating
Hop made a discovery resulting in the art-
unionist being fined for leaving his car in a
public thoroughfare in a place not set apart
for parking cars. What had been discovered
was that away in the remote past, when the
configuration of the Quay was quite different,
the Customs House frontage had been part
of Alfred-street; and in spite of all changes
it remains officially a street.
“Yardley”: A recent newspaper par. men-
tioned that at the “trying-out” (beastly
word!) of applicants for inclusion in the
chorus of the coming opera, Dame Nellie
“whistled” a song. If the diva would only
do this on the stage, she might revive a
healthful habit that. I verily believe, contri-
buted much to the stamina of our ancestors.
Whether singing or whistling be the better
exercise for the lungs may be a question for
the medical faculty, but it is certain that the
assiduous whistler expands his lungs for a
far longer period than the singer. I have
heard in England a farmer’s boy whistling at
top power during every pace of a three-mile
journey. During my first few weeks upon
Australian soil, no other variation from Old
Country customs impressed me so forcibly as
the absence of whistling. Although the hard-
pressed liomefolk habitually piped and fluted
like cock-birds in the mating season, here,
amongst a more buoyant people, the good old
stimulus to cheerfulness seemed to have been
utterly discarded: One explanation that I
have heard is that to sailormen whistling
is a solemn rite, only to be indulged in when
a breeze is ardently desired. Many ot the
early-day gold-diggers were sailors, and these
not only themselves refrained from whistling
on land but discountenanced the practice m
others. Hence, according to this theory, the
abandonment of one of the most healthful
of lung exercises. #
“H.H.”: Queer accidents? A Balmain
(Sydney) dance-hall patron slipped and fell,
and a tangle of other dancers tumbled on
top of him. Not until the following day did
he realise that he had sustained any serious
damage; then he was taken to hospital and
died there. A crushed kidney had done the
mischief.
* * * *
“Howitzer”: One Digger tried to swim
the Channel. He was a hard case, and was
doing a sentence in a Boulogne prison for
breach of army rules, when he decided that
a trip to Blighty was due to him. He man-
aged to escape without much difficulty; the
first rebuff he met was when he reached the
quay and besought the aid of a French fisher-
man. Meeting with not only a flat refusal
but some voluble abuse, he lost his temper
and pitched the unaccommodating skipper
overboard. His first idea was to sail the
craft himself, but the wind died away, so
he decided that swimming would be a quicker
job. He had actually passed two lines of the
famous Home Guard Fleet when he was
picked up by a stray torpedo-boat 10 miles
from Dover. He didn’t get a medal for his
feat, but his pluck appealed to the Brass
Hats, and he was assigned a cushy job in
Blighty until the Armistice.
* * * *
“Cato”: Paragraphs about oncer army
orders remind me of a quaint-looking charge
I once saw on a crime-sheet. Private X was
accused of “shooting on the King’s enemies
without orders.” The impeachment was,
however, not so absurd as it looks in print.
Ammunition was short, and the men were
forbidden to waste it on the many ’planes
that flew over. But, of course, to have said
so in a crime-sheet would have been language
far too simple for a glorious brass-hat.
STILL CONSIDERING THE COLOR
SCHEME.
“Haven’t you made up your mind what dress
you are going to wear?”
“Don’t be a beast. I haven’t even decided
on what rouge yet.”

at Home. How-
ever, the Press
owes him no ill-
will, It was .on
the occasion of the
first meeting of the
Council in his
administration that
reporters were ad-
mitted to the Coun-
cil Chamber. Since
then it has been
their privilege, if
not their pleasure,
to record the pro-
ceedings of the
House.
“Swiss”: He was doing the Farthest
North of his gubernatorial dominions, piloted
by the toniest membah of the Morgan-
Kidston Ministry. The official reception in
the shire hall was over, and the turn of the
usual deputations, with their grievances, had
'arrived. Still he lingered, loath to leave. “I
am afraid your Excellency would find no
interest in this part of my duty,” said Joey
Bell in his best Oxford mannah; “it would
only bore you.” “Not at all,” replied the
other. “I shall only be too delaighted to
remain. The experience will be valuable—
I may some day be a Minister myself.” The
day was long in arriving, but he is now First
Lord of the Admiralty in the first Imperial
Labor Government. His name is Chelms-
ford.
Richard Butler, Speaker of S. Aus. Assem-
bly, lias never been quite happy in the chair,
having the fighting rather than the judicial
temperament. He is standing for Parlia-
ment again, but announces in advance that,
if elected, nothing will make him take the
referee’s job.
Last week Francis Redwood, of Welling-
ton (M.L.), had been 50 years an R.C.
prelate. Nine brother-arclibisliops, 12
bishops, over a hundred priests and most of
Wellington helped him celebrate the occa-
sion. Born in England 85 years ago, he was
the first boy in M.L.'*to enter the Catholic
priesthood. At the age of 35 he became the
youngest bishop in the world, and has now
the distinction of being the oldest. He has
lived under six Popes and is the only sur-
vivor of 1300 Catholic bishops living at the
time of his consecration. Through it all he
has fiddled persistently on a precious Strad.
George Fairbairn’s acceptance of the Vic.
Agent-Generalship, in succession to McWliae,
was a tremendous relief to Lawson and his
Ministers. They were tired of hawking the
job, and were not helped by a cabled state-

knight.
ment that McWhae had to spend £3OOO of
his own in addition to his screw (£1750 a
year). There is to be no increase of pay
for the new man, but that will hardly worry
him. A grounding at Geelong Grammar and
Cambridge (Eng.) prepared Fairbairn to
handle his pastoral business and financial
enterprises and add to his store of wealth.
Public life (he had terms in Vic. Assembly
and tiie Federal Senate) broadened and
humanised him. Courteous, good tempered
and appreciative of the other point of view,
lie has made friends all along the line. His
trip to England will be a continuation of his
honeymoon, as he has just taken a second
plunge into matrimony at 69.
Alec Peacock will have been 35 years in
the Vic. Assembly on March 28. Dr. Willie
Maloney has been a Parliamentarian for the
same period, but he served only 15 years in
the State Assembly; for the rest of the time
he has been in the House of Reps. There is
a move to get together on March 28 the Sur-
vivors of the 14th (Reformed) Parliament
of Vic. (1889-92). So far as is known there
are only 14, the youngest over 60 and the
oldest more than 80. it is hoped that Agar
Wynne will do the convening.
Deeming, the almost-forgetten hearthstone
artist, appears in distinguished company in
a new book of reminiscences by English jour-
nalist Ernest Smith. Smith was intimate
about 1895 with Lombroso, the Italian crime
specialist, whose private museum at Turin
included “a plaster cast of the head of Deem-
ing, the Australian murderer, which the
Professor discovered was exactly similar to
tnat of Napoleon.” ‘‘Napoleon was a slayer
O' men, said Lombroso; “Deeming was a
slayer of worqen.”
Tlie, Deacon’ : The Black Camel which
s J°l in Dunne, of Wollongong
(JN.b.W.), on his return from a 12-months’
trip abroad, removed the most picturesque
R.G. padre of the fast-diminishing old school
of two-fisted Celtic fighters. Most of his life,
winch ended in the middle sixties, was spent
in salvaging miners’ souls on the near and
far South Coast of N.S.W., where his rugged
personality, plus his strong right arm. won
something more than respect. His Wollon-
gong appointment carried with it a V.F.
title, which had the effect of an ecclesiastical
subconsulship as far south as Nowra.
John McWliae, who retires from the Vic.
Agency-General in July to make way for
Fairbairn, says his knighthood cost him
£3OOO-odd. He did not put it quite as bluntly
as that, but told an interviewer that in order
to hold up his end” in a way “worthy of the
State” he had to spend £l5OO a year for two
years out of his own purse in addition to the
Agent-General’s allowance of £1750 p.a.; and
of course he accepted the job to get the title.
There are whispers that McWhae got huffy
over the Auditor-General's inquiries about
some things which he himself regarded as
small. If this be so, then he is not the first
A.gent-General to find out 'that there is a
difference between being a Minister in power
and a super-officer living in London and
carrying out orders.
“R.D.” : Sir Henry Slesser, the new Brit-
ish Solicitor-General, must be one of the
youngest men to get that job. Some years
ago I belonged to a small party, of which
he was the deputy-leader, in one of the
mock Parliaments that every London muni-
cipality boasts. These are supposed to be
training-grounds for Westminster, and swarm
with youthful lawyers who aspire to poli-
tics. A frail yoiiiig Jew, with no initial
assets of physique or appearance, Slesser
showed even then that he had the secret of
political success. His suave, ingratiating
manner could always be relied upon to cool
the heat of a debate, and from his small but
well-packed head he brought out one fact
after another with the precise air of a lawyer
producing the exhibits in the case. He
specialised in trade-union law, and was one
ot the bright stars of the Fabian nursery
w ; 1 ", cl1 at that time held J. C. Squire, editor
of the Mercury ; St. John Ervine, the drama-
tist; and other young men who have since
achieved fame of one sort or another.
Although Rear-Admiral Hall Thompson,
who has arrived to take his seat as first
member of the Naval Board, has in recent
years been A.D.C. to the King, and had
other fancy jobs, he has an old prosaic asso-
ciation with Australia. In 1901 he was
inspector of stores at Garden Island.
Vic. Premier swore once more the other
day when lie tossed the Water Supply
portfolio to Eggleston and took the Treasurer-
ship Within the last 10 years he has kissed
the book and successively snapped pretty well
every office in the Cabinet. It would be hope-
less to try to get on the blind side of Law-
son m any department—he knows too much
tor the comfort of both officers and col-
leagues.
Poole, K.C., has succeeded to the seat of
the ffite Judge Gordon in S.A., and Tom
O l-lalloran takes “silk.” The K.C. list in
Adelaide is fairly long, but Symon, Nesbit,
Glynn and Grundy are all taking things
easy now. Of the younger men Richards
keeps to Crown cases, and the Bar leaders
are Cleland. Piper, Isbister and Villeneuve
smith. O Halloran is 58, and an expert
draftsman of Parliamentary bills, an art
which he studied under C. C. Kingston long
ago. The two legal professions are com-
bined in 8. Aus., and he has been solicitor
to the Municipal Tramways Trust since it
started. His father was a magistrate, and
his grandfather the first Adelaide Commis-
sioner of Police.
Mars lost a valiant supporter the other
when Alfred Pickering, of Hurstville
, went out. Born at Peakhurst
(N.S.w.) in 1858, he served in the Camel
Corps m the Soudan campaign, and with
the Bushmen’s contingent in the Boer War.
Then when the last disturbance happened
he couldn’t keep out of it, though he had
to make 14 attempts before he could persuade
the heads to let him go. The old fellow—
-5o when he enlisted—saw three years’ fight-
ing, including Gallipoli.
Former Native Land Court Judge Edward
Walter Puckey, who died recently, aged 87.
was said to be the oldest Maorilander of
European parentage. His father reached
the colony 105 years ago, and he and his
wife were among the first white people to be
married there. Most of the wedding party
were Maoris, and the bride rode 15 miles
to her new home at Paihia in an armchair
slung between two poles. Edward Puckey,
as interpreter and Native Land Court Judge,
played a leading role in the cutting up of
Maonland for settlement, his biggest job
being in connection with the Waimarina
block of 583,000 acres.
J. O. Bull, who died in Adelaide recently,
claimed to be the oldest man of local birth.
He was born in March, 1838. when the city
was but a year old and people could still be
bushed in its streets. Bull was a stockman
all his life, and spent much of it on the
Darling and in the N. Territory.
Dr. Baldwin. Vic. Government Astrono-
mer, lias come into prominence with a pro-
posal for revising the Gregorian calendar
by providing for eight months of 30 days
and four months of 31 days each. For an
ordinary year the doctor would have also
New Tear s Day (which he wouldn’t include
in any week), and for a leap year a
similarly detached leap day. He would
, a fix ed date for Easter, and make
Christmas Day always fall on the same day
ol the week. The first of a month would
never start on Sunday, and quarters would
be of the same length. The idea is, of course,
not novel, but Dr. Baldwin’s backing of it
now that a committee of the League of
Nations is seeking opinions, through the Com-
monwealth, will help discussion. Like Cooke,
o! N. S. Wales, Baldwin is Australian-born.
His father was that Joe Baldwin who used
to be Vic.’s senior inspector of schools.
THE NEW VIKING OF N. S. WALES,
SIR DUDLEY DE CHAIR.
Dead in Adelaide, at 64, W. W. Andrews,
son of an Anglican canon of old time.
Railway engineering was his life’s work, and
after some experience in the U.S.A. he was
in charge of various S. Aus. lines, notably
that from Darwin to P'ine Creek, when the
central State had charge of the Territory
and dreamed dreams of running the rails
right across the continent as it had done
the telegraph wires.
Airman Howard Jolley induced Henry
Moore (“Black Harry,” of Port Melbourne)
to go for a ,ioy-ride in liis ’plane on what was
alleged to be Moore’s 108th birthday last
week. P. H. Moody, of Sydney, was the
pilot, and the spin over the Port and the
hay lasted 10 minutes. After it was over
Moore, who is probably the oldest man in
the world to go skimming the clouds, rec-
koned it was quite as safe as the stage-
coacliing of his youth.
“Sixenate” : An interested follower of the
trial in Melbourne of Angus Murray was
octogenarian P. de Jersey Grut. He was
exactly 60 years ago a leading actor in a
sensational attempt at bank robbery. Four
armed bandits raided a hank at Collingwood
in which he (then ledger-keeper) and the
manager _ were alone. The man covering
Grut with a revolver had his attention
momentarily withdrawn, and the ledger-
keeper promptly jumped upon him, an action
which led to the bandits being routed. They
were subsequently captured, and two were
hanged for using their revolvers with intent.
The Ingleby family tree is rooted deep in
S. Australian law. Rupert, tjie present head,
is the son of a former leading member of the
inner Bar, and was at one time lecturer in
the Adelaide Law School. His daughter
Eileen, after a brilliant ’Varsity career, was
the second member of the petticoated sex to
be admitted as a practitioner in the State:
and the latest member of the family to join
the Costs brigade is son Jack, who repre-
sented Adelaide in the recent inter-’Varsity
sports in Melbourne.
New N.S.W. Governor de Chair was the
first captain of the Orion, which, with 13.5 in.
guns and a maximum speed of 23 knots, was
then the most powerful instrument afloat.
That was only 10 years ago ; but so great
have the changes been in even a decade that
the Hood, now in Australian waiters, mounts
no less than eight 15in. guns., and her max.
speed is over 32 knots.
An educationist of parts was J. W. Tibbs,
who died at Auckland (M.L.) the other
day. Born at Hobart, he graduated B.A.
at Oxford in 1879, and M.A. in 1883; and on
his return joined Plobart High School.
He went to Auckland Grammar in
1885 as maths, master; eight years
afterwards he was appointed headmaster, a
job he kept till he retired a couple
of years ago. Tibbs was in the honors-list
last June, but owung to illness the C.M.G.
insignia was not handed him till Gov.-Gen.
Jellicoe called at his home a few days before
his death.
DOWNWARD TENDENCIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are lots of things falling, we all of us know,
lake Lucifer ages and aeons ago.
The kroner, the mark, and the rouble are quite
Submerged in the bottomless pit out of sight.
The franc and the lira perversely descend
Till none knoweth just where the process will end;
And even old England’s reliable quid
Doesn’t roost in the tree quite as high as it did.
But a problem with which more directly we’re faced
I note in the fall of the feminine waisi^
’Tis a sort of a medium, though not of exchange,
W ith a hardly defined geographical range;
But I’m waiting to learn, from some capable mouth,
If it hasn’t arrived at its furthermost south.
The franc and the lira may possibly fall
Till their value arrives at just nothing at all;
That they will or they won’t I’ve seen proved and
disproved
Till the argument leaves me profound!}' unmoved.
But will somebody tell me (don’t answer in haste),
Can it sink any lower —the feminine waist?
lake a stroll, camarado, down George-street or Pitt,
Observe where the belts are expected to sit,
And think of the latitudes where they were set
In the days when you puffed at your first cigarette.
True, ’tis part of a woman that never has ceased
To be —like our Easter —a movable feast,
But limits there must be, above and below,
To where even sashes and girdles may go.
Some miracle’s needed if it’s to be placed
Any nearer to zero—the feminine waist.
’Tis a sign of the times that in city and town
There are people and things go relentlessly down.
Think of Hughes, how he towered till they gave
him the chuck !
Now he isn’t knee-high, you may say, to a duck.
And the franc of Monsieur, once reputed so sound,
fields! tis a, hundred and three to the pound.
’.Till it go on descending? Belike and perchance.
Go ask of the pundits whose forte is finance.
But ’twill tax even Fashion’s inscrutable taste
To drag any lower the feminine waist.

“Morob”: Probably the most intricate
code of signals in existence is employed by the New
Guinea natives in communicating between villages
by means of drum-beats. It cannot possibly be
based on the same principle as the Morse code, since
there is no such thing as native orthography; so
whole sentences and ideas at a time must be repre-
sented by a series of beats. At first, when one
listens to a village talking to another at night,
there does not seem to be any difference between
any r of the beats, but after a time, when the ear
has become accustomed to them, it is easy to dis-
tinguish variations both in sound and in the method
of producing it. The chief divisions seem to be a
rather lengthy scale of sharp and high notes, and
another of deep and low sounds; and the curious
thing about them is that, in sending, they are not
mixed up together—all the sounds in one series
belong to either one or the other division. More-
over, the code, if it really is a code in the generally-
accepted meaning of the word, seems to be common
to the whole country—at any rate, to the cn:ire
north-western coast, although most of the inhabitants
are not cn speaking terms with each other in those
parts.

“Vagabond”: On the Clarence (N.S.W.)
at present we have touched the limit in mosquito
production. The buzzing horrors are here not in
battalions, but in armies, nations! Jim Clod, a
sawny, rather dull-witted sort of chap, was planting
imphee seed yesterday, and doing his best to broad-
cast it and shoo the ’skeeters as well, only there
was no “well” about it. The buzzers in the long
run had him absolutely bamboozled, and when the
boss blew into the battle-field James looked like a
contortionist, a windmill and a scarecrow all rolled
into one. “What ther ’ell yer doin’ there?” yelled
the Old Man. From the middle of a blur of whirling
arms came Jimmy's saddened drawl: “S’all right,
boss; I’m sowin’ mosquito seeds —an’ every blank
of ’era’s cornin’ up!”
* * * *
“Yaeko”: Speaking of aquatically-inclined
horses, I know of a homesick nag who twice swam
the approximately 10-mile-wide Backstairs Passage
(S.A.). For a third time Dobbin took to the sea
but on this occasion he had a hawser round his neck
which probably impeded his action—anyhow, he was
drowned.
“Vagabond”: On the service car between
Maclean and Yamba (N.S.W.) the other afternoon, a
stranger was anathematising the appalling road at
great length. “What are you sparking about ?”
crooned the driver, holding himself down with the
wheel. "There's only one hole on this run —you drop
into it at Maclean, and bounce out of it at Yamba.'’
“Yes,” grumbled the tormented one as he shot half-
way through the hood, “that’s all right-—but the
damn thing’s got a lot of ridges in it!”
“S.”: Talking of one-armed handy men.
An old gent on the N.C. line (Q.)
had his left arm amputated midway
between the elbow and shoulder, yet
he could manage to make his own
johnnie-cake, wash, chop wood, fell
trees, nail up cases and catch, saddle
and mount his neddy as well as any-
one else. I also know a chap born
minus his right arm who can drive
nails and tacks and peel apples. He
holds the fruit on his right shoulder
with his chin, and peels away far
quicker than some who have their
two hands. When driving nails and
tacks he holds them between his toes.
He carries five eggs at once- —three
under his chin and two in his hand,
and I’ve seen him climb a 4ft.
paling fence with three eggs under
his chin. He is only a nipper
yet, and it looks as though ther''Tl
be nothing he won't be able to t»<jkle
when he grows up.
“Hopalong”: If, as “Golub” (B. 7/2/’24)
says, the goanna is immune to snakebite, how is it
that lie often comes off second best in a. fight with
the wriggler? After an examinaticn of the teeth ol
both, anyone would lay 10 to 1 on the go. if the
poison part were ruled out. A few years ago I
came upon the scene of a snake-goanna bout. When
I dismounted, the snake, which was badly gashed,
tried to get away, but 1 killed him. On turning to
examine the go., who hadn’t moved, I found him
dead. His skin was not ripped like his opponent’s,
but I found several nasty teeth-marks on his neck
and sides. Considering the amount of shot a go.
can carry up a tree, I am sure that the snake’s teeth
alone had not done the trick. No; he could not
move away soon enough to get an antidote, so died
of snake poison.
* * * *
“Thompson's Mate”: Though “E.V.R.”
(B. 7/2/’24) doubts “Jobber’s” marksmanship yarn
(B. 10/1 /’24), yet in the same par. he himself
brings in a man who could shoot moving wallabies in
the head at 50 or 60 yards in waist-high bracken.
Well, in bracken that high the head of the wallaby
would be visible only sometimes, and as the vulner-
able part of the animal’s top-piece would be about
2in. square, to hit a moving target that size, visible
only sometimes —well, h’m-h’m. I was seven years with
Joe Thompson, a man who could make £3O to £4O
a month where ’roos were “thin,” and two years
with Joe Barnes, of Coolamon, one of the best snap-
shots with a rifle the bush ever produced, and they
couldn’t do that sort of stunt.
“Dingaan”: “Elbow Bend's” par. (B.
7/2/’24) will rouse every true sportsman to fury—
not only on account of the ’possum that lingered for
36 hours in a trap, but also because of the gross
carelessness that allowed three skins to be wasted
by blowflies, as if our supply of fur-bearing marsupials
was not being destroyed fast enough otherwise. Possi-
bly, seeing that the animal broke the trap loose,
“Elbow Bend” cannot be held culpable for the time
it remained alive between the steel jaws; but the
fact remains that the ordinary spring trap
is a most abominable instrument of torture.
It is bad enough to leave an animal in mortal agony
a whole night, but many a trapper allows a much
HOT AND DRY.
VISITOR: “Phew! This is a stifling sort of a climate here!”
BIG ONE: “It is; as you teas sayin’, a hot spot, a very hot spot,
I’ll go even further an’ sag it is a thirsty spot.”
longer time to elapse before going his rounds,
neglects to do so for days on account of rain and
snow, and sometimes leaves his animals —especially
the comparatively cheap and plentiful bunny—to die
a lingering death of inconceivable agony. But what
is needed as much as anything is an awakening
of the national conscience to the sin of wholesale
waste, such as killing ’possums and subsequently
allowing their skins to be flyblown.

“A.E.G.”: I always believed that a cat
would not voluntarily get its body wet. However,
while walking along the wharf at Port Adelaide 1
saw a hungry-looking specimen run to the edge,,
look over, then deliberately take a header into the
water Bft. below. After swimming about 6ft. out
she returned, and by climbing up the piles regained
the wharf and calmly strolled off towards the sheds.
Will the Council please explain ? ■
“Hope On”: How's this for an outsize
fresh-water eel? He was recently caught in a small
creek near Yarram (Vic.), and his weight was
221 b., his length 4ft. Bin. and his girth 14in.
“Parama”: Three of the “boys” on tin
ketch are musically inclined. I’m fairly used to
weird sounds coming from their quarters for’ard, and
put anything fresh down to the latest New Guinea
jazz music; but I had to investigate re-
cently when I was aroused from a doze
on the hatch-cover by a series of ear-
splitting squeaks and squeals horribly
unlike anything I’d heard before. The
orchestra proved to be made up of the
same three musiei- n-, each of whom was
armed with a hardwood dance-drum with
the usual iguana-skin top, having in
addition a round hole lh the side in which
the musician turned a polished bone peg.
The row was caused by the friction of
the pegs against the sides of' the holes,
and a soul in agony was nothing to it;
but the performers were delighted, and with all an
inventor’s pride informed me that it was a new kind
of music they had made up themselves.
“Adamascus”: A cotton-farmer of Wowan
(C.Q.) placed all his cotton as it was picked in a
room in his house, and made it into bales after the
fields had been cleared. When the time came to
take the cotton to the ginnery he found the door-
way was too small to allow the bales through. Some
solemn thinking proved to him that there were two
solutions of the difficulty—either to unpack the
bales or pull down the side of the house. He went
on thinking for a while, then chose the latter. A
half-hour or so with a hammer removed the wall,
and the bales were taken outside and loaded. Then
he cheerfully put the wall up again.
“Nitric”: “Ignat” (B. 7/2/’24) wishes to
know if the “small green snake” generally found
among reeds and in trees (it is sometimes called a
tree-snake) is venomous. There are two Australian
green snakes, one of which has a yellow belly,
while the other’s characteristic feature is a copper-
colored head. I have met the latter often ir.
ploughed ground, and I know that one was respon-
sible for the death of a well-grown steer. Most bush-
men will credit this snake with being poisonous, but
the yellow-bellied one is as harmless as a toothless
toad. “Ignat’ uses the word “small” in his descrip-
tion. but though this wriggler rivals the whip-
snake for thinness in proportion to length, I’ve seen
tree snakes well over sft.
"Pick ’: The . most elusive animal sought
by the Australian tur
hunter is the platypus.
You never find the
fish-bird-’possum except
in deep waterholes,
which he reaches
through subterranean
tunnels opening below
the water’s surface.
Exceedingly wary and
distrustful, Platty dives
at the first sight of a
shooter, and is not
seen again for hours,
though, with beak tip
and eye protruding, he
may oe reconnoitring
but a few feet away.
Also, when a gunshot
is sent at him, he is
the hardest thing to
kill. lie swims with an
inch of water floating
up his back fur, and
though a close pot-shot
might knock a fistful
of his coat adrift on
the stream, the water
pact protects his body.
To get him, the expeit
hunter waits for the
roach on his back as
he doubles up to dive,
and half his form rolls
out of the damp, or,
surer still, stuns him
with a concussion shot
from a rifle. But he
is so extremely rare in
these days, that the
man who shoots one
deserves to be haunted
by a duck-billed ghost
for the rest of his days.
“F.A.”: If “Pat Busliie” (B. 7/2/’24)
had ever tasted goat he would not lay such a ridicu-
lous charge at the door of the out-back butcher.
Sheep and goat meat are about as much alike in
taste and appearance as Murray cod and goanna. The
flesh of the goat is differently grained to that of
the jumbuck and also kills darker. Further, the
former has a distinctive odor which, though not
altogether unpleasant when the belt of the sniffer
is at the last hole, is not exactly what an epicure
would call alluring.
“Pick” : A bullock owned by John Poole,
a South Coast (N.S.W.) dairyman, put up a record
for going the shortest distance in the longest time.
THERE’S A REASON FOR EVERY-
THING.
FIRST FISHERMAN : “My old woman’s never
happy once I’m out of her sight.”
SECOND FISHERMAN : “It’s a cotv, isn’t it?
My missus don’t trust vie either!”
Feeding along the cliffs of Corunna Headland he
slipped into a narrow chasm through the bank giv-
ing way. He was a fat, and his rotundity held him
suspended about 20ft. from the sand below. Gradu-
ally sliding between the smooth rock-faces as Le
became emaciated from want of food and watei, it
took him eight days after his predicament was dis-
covered by his owner to reach the bottom. The
converging opening to the cliff face then offeied a
passage-way to a fresh trickle through the locks.
The poor fellow was very staggery, but he managed
to reach it and get a long, long drink.

THE WIND THAT BURIES THE DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I spring from the land of the drifting sand,
The wind that buries the dead ;
I cover the roads like a rippled beach
Where the feet of the lost men tread.
Old is the night when I take my rest;
I sleep till the flaming noon.
I ride to the height of the clouds at night
As they’re scurrying past the moon.
Famine and drought are my henchmen stout,
My lover the wild bush-fire ;
I will never shirk full share of work,
And my lover he will not tire,
As he’s soaring high where the grass is dry,
With his wings, like a vulture’s, spread,
The great trees fall at the crashing call
Of the wind that buries the dead.
He will strip the limbs of the tallest pine
And gnaw through the knotted bole ;
Then he bites at the brush like a monster starved
And snails at a fallen pole.
But the bones of the perished birds and beasts,
When the grassless plains are red,
Will be hidden deep by the restless sweep
Of the wind that buries the dead.
I leave my mark on the curling bark
Of bramble and bush and shrub ;
And woe to the branch that may bar my way
As I race through the bending scrub.
I ruffle the rags of a fallen one
Who had dreams of a lake ahead ;
But he will not shift till the fine sands lift
On the wind that buries the dead.
The carrion crow of my deeds must know,
And croaks as it smells my breath ;
It reads in its circle and wheel on high
My message of coming death.
I howl round the shepherd’s hut at night
And he sighs on his lowly bed ;
On a restless quest the flocks face west
To the wind that buries the dead.
NO MIRROR HANDY.
“It’s not a hit of use, Professor. Apart from the fact
that it is contrary to the teachings of the Bible,
I can see no evidence anywhere suggesting to me
that man COULD be descended from apes.”
The wool kings crave for a sign of change
When the seasons are passing dry,
The sky is flecked like a mackerel
Or the flowing mares’ tails fly ;
But the ceaseless hum of the fencing-wires
Is one of the signs they dread,
Or the graceful whirlies that lead the dance
Of the wind that buries the dead.
Half crazed with fears a woman peers
For the sight of a child that strayed ;
The father has tramped and called all night,
While she cared for the rest and prayed.
Two crusted furrows are on her cheeks—
Dry salt of the tears she shed.
Her tears may flow as the seasons go,
For the wind will bury the dead.
The buslimen come in a mounted troop
And they scatter on hill and plain;
They follow the gullies and mulga ridge,
But their search will be in vain.
(There’s a creeping army of small black ants
That twist like a winding thread
Round and round and across the mound
AVhere the wind has buried the dead.)
When the rivers rise to the red soil’s edge
And the billabongs overflow,
The land turns green in a single night
Where the creeping waters go;
The wild swamp lilies bedeck the ground,
Like a golden mantle spread—
By the rich spring dress may the bush-birds guess
Where the wind has buried the dead.

“Gouger”: Can the Council wireless me
the best bark to roof a hut with, when to strip it,
how to prepare the sheets and finally' the correct
pitch to put on the roof ? I want it absolutely'
rainproof—-not a bark that in six months’ time will
crack from the sun’s heat and let in the first
thunderstorm like a sieve, as the roof I’m under at
present is doing. St. Peter has turned on the
spouts of Heaven, and my blankets, fire, tucker and
temper are getting the ducking of their lives.
It’s enough to drive a man to the city, or marriage
or something.
“The Rumpus”: Big Jack Geddes, with a
cheque for £2OO, drove from Broad Arrow to Kal-
goorlie (W.A.), and a fortnight later woke up with-
out a bean, Straightway he started back on the
hoof, and half-way was overtaken by a couple of
mine managers in a car going to Broad Arrow.
They stopped, cracked two bottles of beer, and then
told Geddes to hop in. But John turned his face
to the road and said sternly: “Jack Geddes, y'ou big
blankard, y'ou went through two hundred quid in a
fortnight and don’t remember any of it —you’ll
damn well walk to Broad Arrow.” And he did.
“Saaedi”: The barley-grass mentioned by
“S.C.” (B. 24/l/’24) is also becoming a pest in
several Central Western (N.S.W.) grazing districts.
When green it is excellent fodder, but when dry its
sharp heads cause endless mischief to the jumbueks.
Many are sent blind through the spear-like pieces
penetrating the eyeballs. Sheepmen hasten to extract
these fragments before irretrievable damage is done.
Weaners affected by the grass are often stunted in
their growth. It thrives on the rich blaok-soii plains,
and some stations are entirely covered by it. during
spring and early summer. The procedure in such
cases is to stock several paddocks heavily during the
early stages of the plant’s growth, so as to have
places of comparative safety on which to depasture
the sheep later on. Luckily, barley-grass rarely re-
mains a menace for longer than three months, and
this period is shortened if heavy rain or wind occurs
to shake the sharp seeds to the ground.
“Jimmy Possum” ; This ought to top the
score of youngsters on the wallaby. Travelling
regularly up and down the Bananaland coast about
two decades ago was a party comprising three genera-
tions —the granny usually going on ahead with a
sugar-bag to cadge, the sons and their wives and
families ambling on behind with a two-horse dray. The
last time I saw that cadging crowd the granny came
on ahead as usual, and she was followed at a slow
walk by the wife of one of the sons with a five-
days-old baby in her arms. I pitied the woman—
she was young; but I pitied the kiddie more—it was
the youngest thing I ever saw on the track.
NO NECESSITY NOW.
SQUATTER'S DAUGHTER: “Come in for a dip, Susie. We're all
going in.”
SUSIE: “No matter note miss. Mine, bin get it husban ’ long
time ago.”
a u • S i omebo<] y fisked recently if birds “McJ.”; What is the record batch of eggs
fly m their sleep? Dun no; but 1 do know they talk for a goanna for one sitting? 1 saw two nests
lv e . ln state - 1 .woke up the unearthed the other day, and each contained 12. I
i mg i a iea tei 12 and distinctly heard asked Binghi if that was the limit, and he gave me
two birds below my window, which butts into the
street. Before 1 threw the bedroom jug out, these
(or some such) words floated in: “An, ducky, will
oo love me for ever an’ ever?” In a deeper note
came the answer: “Too troo, my lirrel birder para-
dise ! ”
“Bush Girl” : A while back “AdeL.” asked
about a fish he caught near the Gulf of Carpentaria
that had the body of a perch and the head of a
black rock-cod. I took one from the Tate River (Q.)
HIS VERSATILE THIRST.
VERY PARTICULAR OLD LADY: “But, before you start, tell me, do
you drink anything?"
HORACE ( fervently): “Yes, lady. Anything.”
in 1915. My father set a fish-trap at night, and
when I lifted it next morning it contained what I
thought was a perch, but on looking at it I dis-
covered that it had the head of a black rock-cod and
queer fins. Dad has caught them with a line in
both the Tate and the Lynd rivers at different times,
and say's that he always heard them called butter-
fish.
“Akram” : A lady at Yamba, on tlio Clar-
ence (N.S.W.), recently was making a pudding, when
she cracked a large brown-shell egg on the edge
of the dish. In picking it up she noticed that it
was rather light, but she got the surprise of her
life when a young snake began to slide out of it.
Both the wriggler and the shell are at time of
writing, in a bottle of methylated spirit at one
of the paper offices. The snake’s mouth appears to
be fastened on to the inner portion of the shell,
and its body, about 9in. long, filled the whole of
the egg. There was no sign whatever of the ordinary
contents inside the shell; so what does the Council
make of it ?
“Jarrah”: Shooting at a moving object
from a galloping horse is about as rational a pastime
as that of a dog
chasing his own tail.
But I saw a hunter
put three bullets into
a euro his dogs were
chasing around a bluff
on the Saltia Hills
(S.A.). A fourth bul-
let in the brain-box
when the boomer bailed
up ended the business,
and the post-mortem
showed that he had
collected the four
pellets. Once, near
Bridgetown (W.A.), I
interrupted an eagle
that was stalking some
of my lambs. When
about 400 ft. up, he
sailed over me. With
an old .303 rifle I
took rapid aim, and
nearly fainted when
the bird fell like a
stone. The fluky shot
had almost severed its
head. Two days before
I had missed the
marauder at 50 yards
when it was sitting on
a dry tree.
to understand that sometimes there were 13, | but
never more. Seven seems to be the average. And
I can tell the Council they are first-class eating, too
—as good as the go. itself. By the way, if you
are out for your first taste make sure they are fijesh ;
otherwise y-ou may form a wrong opinion of them,
and their excellence will be lost to you for over.
Albeit Binghi doesn’t discriminate at all.
“A.E.M.” (M.L.) : The farmer has surely
enough worries to bear without having to put up
with destruction
wrought by' pheasants
bred for game oh a
neighbor’s place. Yet
when a M.L. farmer,
prosecuted the other
day for shooting a
pheasant out of season,
pleaded that birds from
a bree d i n g-f at m
scratched up his gar-
den (he shot the fowl
on his own land), it
did hot save him from
being fined £2. Phea-
sants and quail do, a
lot of damage in Maori-
land, but the breeding
of game birds in the
interests of “sport”
continues. There is an
idea of importing
grouse, and it is sus-
pected that this is be-
hind the wholesale
planting of Scottish
heather on the slopes
of Tongariro Park, in
the middle of the
North Island. There is
more than a touch of
the English game laws,
and of the aristocratic
attitude towards game,
in the laws of demo-
cratic M.L. The most
impressive example c f
folly in this respect is
the introduction of
deer, w'hich have be-
come such an expensive
nuisance that they have
to be thinned out
wholesale.
, “S h e i>” : The
Argos declares dog-
matically that the
term “cocky,” as ap-
plied to a farmer,
originated from the flight of city men to the coun-
try, “in droves strongly' reminiscent of the flight
of cockatoos,” when the Vic. lands were opened up
in 1869. I always understood that the word
came into use in its present sense from the indiffer-
ent farming of the “cocky”—he just swooped down
on land and scratched it. And I fancy the common
expression “scratch cocky” may have had something
to do with making the use of the word general.
“Bill It.” : Can anyone explain why it is
that the brand on a light roan —horse or bovine—•
is invariably more distinct than that on any other
colored beast ? Whipmarks, too, show in a fanciful
network of stripes over the backs of the roans,
whereas they are seldom apparent on the brindles,
reds or whites; and the slightest injury or scratch
on the roan pelt leaves a mark that is never effaced,
but is always plainly visible by a darkening of the
hair over the injury.
“Hillard”: Re “Ignat’s” inquiry (B.
7/’2 / ’24) whether the green tree-snake is venomous or
not. There are two infallible signs by which all
venomous snakes may be known—(l) in the centre
of the crown of the head there is one scale isolated
from the sides of the head by surrounding scales,
and (2) the number of scales from the hinge of
the jaw to the point thereof is seven or less. P.S. —
It is just as well to kill the snake before asking
him about these things.
“Hopalong” : Let me remind “Nitric” (B.
7/2/’24) that it is possible for a drover to do
better than make a 0 per cent, loss, which his
champions came so near doing. How about this ?
The two brothers P left S. Aus. vvith a team of
old, worn-out bullocks and three horses. Some
months later they arrived at Peak Downs (Q.) with
250 head of fine.young cattle and 14 good horses.
Although thousands of beasts were not involved as
in “Nitric’s” examples, I nominate this, on a per-
centage basis, as the record drive.
“King Ivurrajong” : Many stories are told
of animals when sold returning to the “dear old
home,” but I back this as a record. In the old
days a mob of horses, sold from a station near
Angledool, on the Queensland border, to a firm in
Melbourne, included a grey that had been dropped
and reared thereabouts. Three months later the
manager of the station was surprised to see the
grey' trot into the yard with the other horses at
the morning round-up.
“Pick”: Ringer was a decidedly unsoci-
able mong. in a Bungendore rabbiter’s pack, but ap-
parently he knew how to think things out for him-
self. He refused to mix with the rabble, and
hunted alone, travelling at all times hundreds of
yards wide, and declining to join in any- chase.
When, however, a yapping hullabaloo started in the
field, Ringer would dart off in the opposite direction
and squat suddenly at the mouth of a burrow. By
that stratagem he saved himself a lot of galloping
and returned to camp every day with more rabbit
scalps at his belt than any other tyke in the pack.
“Akran”: While records are still on tap,
how’s this for an outsize in stringrays? In Cud-
gera Creek (Tweed River, N.S.W.) recently a female
monster of 3001 b. was landed. Having been seen
in shallow water she was secured with a meat-
hook on a big stick, and then Dobbin’s plough-lines
were brought into play to haul her up. She mea-
sured Oft. by 6ft., and is by far the biggest yet
caught up this way. Four young ones, just born,
made their escape as mammy was being pulled
ashore.
* * * *
“Colwyn”: No, the emu is not a particu-
larly- brainy individual. Rabbit-proof fences, when
first erected in Westralia, caused the death of thou-
sands of the big birds. On one selection there were
two waterholes about two miles apart, and one of
them was extensively patronised by the emus. Then
a new fence was erected about 100yds. from this
hole, and within a few weeks of its completion hun-
dreds of emus were lying dead along it, although
there was water in plenty at the other hole two
miles away on their own side of the barrier.
* * * *
“Billy Brolga”: I thought I'd ask old
George Smith, the blower, about the possibility of a
•snake surviving 10 years at the bottom of a shaft, as
quoted by someone a while back. “On course they
can,” he said decidedly. “I knew one that lived
down a dry well in Victoria for 25 years. You see,”
he explained, “it’s like this. When a snake tumbles
down a hole an’ can’t get out he makes himself com-
fortable an’ keeps his eyes about him; then when
another snake tumbles in he pounces on him an’
gobbles him up—an’ so on. There’s always some-
thin’ tumblin’ down, an’ when it rains th’ frogs
come hoppin’ in ter have a swim, an’ then he collars
tucker enough ter last him till it rains agen, besides
havin’ a good drink an’ a bogey as well. Yes,
snakes can live down a shaft orlright.”
“McJ.”: I don’t know which to admire
most, his bush instinct or his endurance. He,
Micky Mapoon, a McDonnell (N.Q.) abo., is blind.
With two of his tribesmen in whose care he was for
the time being, he was hunting about 20 miles south-
west of McDonnell and 10 miles west of the tele-
graph line -the rest of the tribe were nowhere near.
Evidently thinking to get rid of their burdensome
companion, his mates deserted him. Several days
later Micky arrived at McDonnell in a weak
but cheerful state. When he found that he was
deserted he first made his way, through heavilv-
timbered country, to the telegraph line, which he
struck 11 miles south of McDonnell. He then fol-
lowed the line in. Luckily for him the country
was well watered, there being running creeks every
mile or so. But of tucker he had little —an occa-
sional yam, which he knew by the feel of the leaf
and the vine, was all. God knows how many miles
he travelled dodging swamps, scrubs, etc. Never-
theless he came up smiling.

“Aspro”: Two years ago I lost a good
gun in a lake. I revisited the place about nine
months later with a party, after young waterfowl,
and one of the mob stumbled over the irun. It was
A PRETTY FAIR GOER.

thousand words to the gallon!”
covered with a small red fungus-like plant which
must have some useful protective property, for the
metal had not rusted —in fact, 1 am using the weapon
still. Can anyone identify the plant?
“Henry Bateson”: What about the largest
’roo? One shot near Oootamundra (N.S.W.) in
1875 measured lift. 7in. from tip to tip, and
weighed 2071 b. The next largest of which I have
any trace in my- records measured 10ft. 6in. It
was shot near Goulburn.
THE CUSSEDNESS OF INANIMATE OBJECTS.

“I did it on the spur of the moment. He came
bullying me to buy beer, and I might have picked
up a piece of wood, but it was just my luck that it
happened to be a knife.” — Defendant’s explanation.
’Twas all a naccident. Old Ted and 1
Were dear old pals. So close was we, in fact,
That me and him grew used to letting fly
(Without a bit of malice in the act)
With anything that ’appened to the ’an:l—
Just like born brothers, if you understand.
Between two pals there ain’t no stiff restraint:
M hen they get narked, they show it honestlee
I over ’im might ’eave a pot of paint,
Or e’ might throw the fryin’-pan at me ;
Sometimes ’e’d use a poker cn me ’cad,
But it was friendly like, when all is said.
It was just stiffness. ’E come fooling round
Talking of beer when all the pubs was shut.

I swear to Gawd, in giving all these fac’s,

“With due form and solemnity,” such as
one Lachlan Macquarie, Governor-designate,
had deemed fitting on a similar occasion in
1809, Dudley Rawson de Chair was received
into New South Wales on Thursday, the
morning being grey and misty, and the
hour 11. The Governor and Lady de Chair,
who had arrived by the Maloja, left the big
liner down the harbor, sped in a launch
through the grey morning to the Adelaide,
and then stepped from the cruiser’s deck to
her pinnace that rushed them to the gar-
landed landing-stage on the east of Farm
Cove. Here in the cold remnant of the day-
before’s southerly the Union Jack and our
own starry emblem flashed a brave challenge
to the sulky day, and red carpets spilled their
softness beneath the tread of Premier and
Press photographer alike —not to speak of
the two brown dogs that had been testing the
pile of the carpet. Steadily the points of
vantage above and along the flight of Stone
steps grew black with humans. From top to
bottom these steps were an inspiring vista of
the bare knees of boy scouts; and where the
last knee-joint ended the marquee began. In
the immediate foreground the lads from the
Tingira kept the moth and the rust from
consuming their bayonets.
Notables began to arrive. Premier Fuller
and his Ministers; the Mayor, with the chain
of his office worn like a yoke above his
ermine: the Usher of the Black Rod, with
buckled slioon, wrist ruffles and knee
breeches ; Naval-Commander Craufurd ; be-
wigged Mr. Speaker Levy and Mr. President
Flowers; bemedalled Generals; Church and
State. Mrs. Craufurd, in the background,
sported a businesslike camera. The band
kept shoving on another record. A tremor
ran through the marquee; the Premier and
his lady, her white frock rather bleak-looking
against the gloom, stepped on to the pontoon,
and a moment later the pinnace snuggled
close, and Sydney Cove gave up still another
sailor-Governor to N. S. Wales—a lean, grey-
lmired man with a humorous mouth and a
blue eye with a twinkle, the typical glad-eye
of the Navy. In cocked hat and furlongs of
gold braid, he walked like a lamb into a bat-
tery of cameras. Behind him came Lady de
Chair, tall, clear-skinned, bright-eyed, in sea-
green frocking, a sleek, silky pelt slipping
from her shoulders, and about her throat and
in her ears a king’s ransom in pearls. This
splendor was topped by a black lace hat and
crescendoed to an armful of deep red roses.
Another pleasing figure in the vice-regal
group that lent ear to Mayor Gilpin’s fine
voice reading the civic address, and to his
Hx.’s clear-cut tones in reply, was the pink-
and-wliite wife of Commander Grant. Her
roseleaf coloring emerged from white fox and
melted into the designing brim of a rain-
bow-tinted hat. But the sartorial glory of
the day was the horizon-blue full-dress uni-
form of Flight-Commander Coote, of the
Royal Air Force. This slim, dark young
man, with a fascinating dimple in his right
cheek, in a sealskin turban finished off
centre-front with a luxuriant fur brush,
looked as though he might be the prince of
one of those artistically-dressed nations
whose upheavals when put to music have
made the fortunes of so many deserving
theatrical managers. It is said that the
bandmaster absent-mindedly burst into “The
Dream Waltz” on sighting this Vision, but
fortunately the thunders of the salute blew
the notes astern. But no musical-comedy
soldier he; according to his bag, not merely
an ace, but a royal flush.
Up the steps streamed the procession to the
tree-lined ways of the Domain. Here the
Viking and his lady stepped into the State
carriage with its four horses and its pos-
tilions. Closed in behind them a group of
Lancers, fluttering pennants, gallant hats
and all ; then the mounted police— -centaurs
these, if you like —and in drab procession
followed mere brains and place and power,
while above clatter of hooves and the surf-
like murmur of the thousands along the way
the bells of St. Mary’s pealed out a welcome
brazen and golden to the noon.
The swearing-in at Government House
was a grey ceremony, the only blaze of color
being the robes of the Judges, like a crimson
stain on the polished floor. The Consuls for
Belgium, France and Japan kept company
on one of the old-gold settees around the
walls. The Lieut.-Governor and his gentle,
blue-eyed lady, having delivered up the key
of the front door, entered the room. Miss
Onslow, from Camden Park, made an un-
supported entrance ; and Mrs. Budge and Mrs.
Bavin kept an eye on their lords from the
dais under the gallery, whereto presently
came the Vice-reine. On the dais on the
left-hand side of the ballroom the swearing-
in was got through neatly and with despatch
by Official-Sceretary Budge, Chief-Justice
Cullen and Sir Dudley, who in clear tones
repeated the necessary oaths, afterwards
setting his seal thereto. And now in the hall
of Government House, where the coats-of-
arms of the long line of Governors, from
Phillip down, are blazoned, the Dc Chair
heraldry will be added.
The new Viking and his wife have a sense
of humor, they like to be amused, and both
are keen tennis-players and dancers. Lady
dc Chair hqs been in Sydney before. It
was in the spacious days when her hus-
band’s uncle was Governor. She was at
a ball given by Admiral Rawson in Cran-
brook nearly 20 years ago, and somebody
who saw her entering on Sir Harry’s arm
took her to be his niece. That was a case
of coming events, for she and Sir Dudley
were not then even engaged. The Arts and
Crafts will find her a friend, for she is
something of a potter, while sixteen-year-
old daughter Enid is keen on embroideries.
Lady dc Chair declares ours to be the best
“found" and the most beautiful of the
Dominion vice-regal residences. She has
already discovered the silky-oak furniture so
beloved by Governor Strickland’s daughter
Mary.
The new Governor’s Chief of Staff, Com-
mander Grant, is more than half-Australian
already; and his father, curiously enough,
aided a former Governor, Sir Hercules
Robinson, in one of the numerous Govern-
ment Houses in which he tried to pick the
winner.
After having his right hand nearly put
out of action at a levee on Friday morning,
the Governor took his lady to the Royal
Hospital for Women in the afternoon, and
presided at the annual meeting of the
Benevolent Society of N. S. Wales. It has
been a Governor’s job since the days of
Lachlan Macquarie, and, despite the fact
that Sir Dudley was quite “at sea” with
regard to the formality of conducting a meet-
ing, he tackled the job with a sailor’s
thoroughness, and put the resolutions in
quaint phrases of his own. Lady de Chair
laughed as heartily as anyone at the floun-
derings. But, like a sensible man, he asked
what he should do, and before the meeting
ended he was conducting the business with
the correctness of a religious service on his
quarter-deck.
Chatswood flew all its flags on Saturday
afternoon. The boy scouts, the girl guides,
V.A.’s, naval cadets and returned soldiers
were out forming guards of honor to the
Viking and Lady de Chair on their first
visit to the North Shore. Nearly 3000 people
attended the unveiling of the tablets at the
War Memorial Hall. The singing of .the
“Recessional” at the beginning and the
sounding of the “Last Post” at the finish in-
vested the proceedings with due solemnity.
The Governor and his lady afterwards visited
the bowling-green, where President Gartrell
led the hospitality. As befitting an admiral,
the Governor showed that he had not
neglected the restful sport that permitted
Drake to learn unmoved that the Spanish
Armada was bearing down on Britain.
No doubt it was an ex-Governor who sug-
gested having a “Be Kind to Animals”
Week on the arrival of a new Excellency.
Allowing them only Sunday to get over the
wild rush that followed the landing, the publi?
started Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair on
a vigorous campaign on Monday. The Mil-
lions Club fed him at the Ambassadors, and
then talked to him. Before he had time to
tell his wife all about it he was at the
Town Hall opening the Week and parting
with a tenner. And in the evening they
were at Parliament House at the reception
in honor of visiting Victorian politicians.
The president and Mrs. Fred Flowers led
the reception committee. The affair was
staged in the huge dining-room. And there
were more speeches.
Earl Ilarrowby and his Countess had their
return to Sydney somewhat dimmed by the
new Governor’s arrival. They beat him to
a civic reception by only 24 hours. But the
kindly couple, with tall daughter Lady
Frances Ryder, aren’t looking for public
ovations. The reception at the Town Hall
served as a meeting-place for old Digger
friends of the family. Every man in the
vestibule wore a soldier’s badge. Sometimes
it was worn by a man too old to have done
a ’op-over; but he wanted to sav thank vou
for the generosity that had made the boys’
English furlough so pleasant. The oval face
of Lady Frances lit up at such times like
that, of a Madonna. But there was nothing
mediaeval about her clothes: they were of a
sophisticated simplicity, the color of wet
sands, a silk hat to tone carrying a narrow
knot of ribands. The Countess dazzled the
City Fathers in rich lace and satin and a
beautiful brown hat.
i Eadith Walker’s home will shelter the
Earl and his girls for part of their stay:
jukl lntoi- on the McArthur Oil slows will
provide tlie.se nice people with bed and board.
The Baek-to-Batlmrst week ended in a
delirium of civic pride on Saturday night,
when 10,000 people paraded the neighbor-
hood of the post-office, Royal Hotel and Sol-
diers' Memorial. Since the total population
of the place is under 10,000 the extent of
the influx of old Batlnirstians may be imag-
ined. Bathurst is associated in the minds
of its inhabitants with such names as Lee,
Suttor, McPhillamy, Kite, Meagher and
Stewart; but a feature of the festivities was
the paucity of representatives from afar of
these families. In their place came hordes
of persons whom many of the younger
natives had forgotten were once Batliurs-
tians. Amongst them were James Mitchell,
Inspector-General of Police; Charlie Turner,
the Test bowler of other days; and the
tennis-playing Andersons.
To-morrow night the Messageries Mari-
times Co. is giving a ball on the Ceepliee.
Consul-General Campana and his wife will
leave by the ship on March 22 to show Aus-
tralian-born son John to his relatives. The
Campanas have been feted in royal fashion.
The Syrian community came together en
masse to do them honor. Consul Campana
spent part of his diplomatic career among
the Syrians, and has always shown great
sympathy and understanding for these
French Colonials. The Consular service in
Sydney said au revoir to him and Madame
at the Ambassadors on Tuesday.
On April 23 a bride is to come out of Bai-
vaig, Dr. Charles MacLaurin’s fastness at
Rose Bay: daughter Catherine is then to
marry Alan Mackerras, at the local Si.
Andrew’s, and go off: with him to America
for a year or so. Grandpa MacLaurin was
for many years Chancellor of Sydney Uni.,
and both the parties in the present matter
are graduates—she in Arts, he in Fngin eer-
ing. His thoughts (in business hours) run
to mathematics; hers, like her father’s, to
literature—she writes almost as well as the
learned author of “Post Mortem.”
The most picturesque of a flock of Wed-
nesday weddings was at St. Patrick’s. So
many flowers and candles were used in the
decorations of the old Church Hill edifice,
and the bride gleamed so in silver and jewels
behind her mammoth shower of orchids, roses
and stephanotis, that it looked like a setting
of the mediaeval ages. Pere Piquet’s black
whiskers added to the illusion. The bride,
Lilian Paul, looked like a Valkyrie in a
gown of white satin embroidered all over
with gleaming silver and crystals and dis-
playing a court train of cloth of silver
covered in billows of silver tulle. Celest
Dougan was awaiting the shimmering vision
at the altar.
St. Canice’s saw a very quiet little
ceremony on a morning of last week when
Adele Arnold was married to Alexander Dal-
gleish, both from the environs of Goulburn.
Enid Cronin, one of Goulburn’s smartest
dressers, was an afternoon bride at the same
church. She is a daughter of bank-manager
Cronin. The man was Harold Brooke, of
St. Kilda, Melbourne. Enid upheld her repu-
tation for frocking in bridal trappings of
pale blue silk moire showing panels of silver
lame, and with a veil of old Limerick lace.
Dr. and Mrs. Lipscomb lent their home, Wis-
ton. Darling Point, for their niece’s wedding-
feast.
Ella Goodman, whose little picture this
is, is the daughter of Sydney’s old friend
“G o o d i e.”
who has been
one of the
pillars of the
J.C.W. fi r m
since the be-
ginning of
time. H i s
handful of a
girl is put-
ting her fire
and her
sparkle, plus
a good sing-
ing voice, into
the Melba
Ope r a Co.
She will sing
small parts,
and do under-
study work.
Her first
teacher was
Mrs. Hugh
Ward; and
lately singing-master Fossati has been train-
ing the lyric soprano.
The _ Coomoo Coomoo Allisons’ elder girl,
Marjorie said she would to Jimmie Traill,
also of Quirindi, on Wednesday evening at St.
Stephen’s. The fluffy-haired brunette with
the nice smile was frocked in cream satin
and silver and wore her plain tulle veil in
severe nun-like folds. Her sheaf of lillies
was quite in the picture. Sister Phyllis, in
a deep rose taffeta frock, befrilled and be-
ruched, attended her; and little nephew
Jimmie Allison, picturesquely clad in a black
satin court suit with deep lace ruffles, held
auntie’s train. Healths were drunk at the
Wentworth.
Last week the late Speaker Joseph
Abbott’s youngest son, Joe, took to wife
Katherine Wilkinson, of Stratlitield. The
bride walked up the aisle of St. James’s in
gold and ivory satin brocade, with a court
train of gold tissue on a shell-pink lining.
Eileen Iloss and Betty Leith, the first in
pale blue brocade and the other in pale pink
brocade, walked in beauty behind her. A
select company was afterwards entertained
at the Queen’s Club.
Here is a photograph of J. Muir Auld,
whose exhibition of landscapes in oils at
Horderns’ Gallery has been attracting a
good deal of
attention dur-
ing the past
E o r t n i gilt.
Auld has been
part and par-
ed of tlic art
world of Syd-
ney for nearlj
20 years, ant
his output has
included a
good deal of
more or less
e p h e m e r a 1
black - and-
white work
and some sound
portraits in
oil. Ilis pre-
sent exhibition
shows him to
be developing
a surer and
freer manner
iii landscape, and seems to indicate pretty
strongly that herein he is going to find the
truest expression of himself. Many of his
canvases are little gems in their way, and
the show fully deserves the crop of red tabs
that has sprouted upon it.
The Indian civil servant who married the
lady who was Mrs. D’Arcy Osborne is on
liis way to Australia. Her death resulted
in a queer mix-up. Her considerable for-
tune was left to her during her life-time, and
in the event of her death to her husband.
The Osbornes say that that meant D’Arcy
Osborne, who was the only husband the
lady’s father had in mind when he made the
will. However, the Courts to whom the pro-
blem was submitted said that Mr. Colvin
was entitled to the cash. He can be relied
on not to resign his heritage in favor of
D’Arcy Osborne, hut is suspected of an
intention to make some arrangement favor-
able to the children.
Gladys Owen, painter and patriot, is be-
ing welcomed home to-day (Thursday) by
sister-artists at the Women Painters’ Club.
Kathleen Brown, a pretty little North
Shore girl, flashes a diamond ring, which
Alec Robertson persuaded her to accept.
Kathleen’s dad is manager ’for Yates, the
seedsmen. She herself works half an acre
of garden at Warrawee with a girl pal, but
finds time to jazz and otherwise enjoy life.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Speaking- before the Accountants and Secretaries
Educational Society, Sir Matthew had some interest-
ing things to say about the good ould days when he
was Under-Sec. in Ireland; also about his Post Office
service in London, with side-lights on his experiences
in the Ministry of Pensions in the last two years of
the Big Fight. There was a musical programme, and
everyone patted everyone else on the back.
His Ex. dined the Ross Munros, Sybil Irving, the
Hawthorns and J. Bannister at Government
House during the week, and also found time to visit
an art exhibition at Exton’s, when the Cumbrae Stew-
arts and others of the socially and artistically elect
thronged to see the pictures that came from Sydney.
The Hubert Fairfax and Ernest White dames are
staying at Government House.
Amid pink-and-white blossoms and sacred bamboos
at St. Augustine’s, Hamilton, Joyce Ussher, of Mac-kay,
was matrimonially harnessed to R. H. Laffan, of
Adelaide. Mrs. Armstrong played the organ while
Pauline Elliot sang “Beloved It Is Morn,” and the
bride,, in silver brocade, was given away by papa.
Nita Archer and Mona Shannon bridesmaided in rose-
pink brocade. Little Morag Campbell, in cream silk
crepe, supported the rear end of the bride’s train.
The wedding feast was laid at Major Sankey’s home
at Hamilton.
The Wattle League tea-ed Mrs. Faulkner at Finney’s
cafe in a setting of gerberas and golden ribbons. The
J. Williams and Hope Morgan ladies wished the
guest God-speed to the Cold Country and tack again,
and there was a big roll up of well-wishers.
The Lockhart Spences gave a dinner at the Bellevue
to Dr. McKillop and his spouse, who are off to Blighty.
There were quite a lot of brother sawbones and their
better halves, among the guests.
The Hawthorn sisters gathered two or three to-
gether at the new Gresham Cafe to honor handsome
Marjorie Byram, who is about to jettison her single-
blessedness. It was a cheery affair, and there were
roses, roses all the way.
The Maryborough Harleys’ second daughter, Sallie
Isabel, has announced her intention of taking the
plain gold band from Dr. Clive Gowan Williams, of
Hawthorn (Vic.). •
Alan Collat'd is to try his luck on the London
Inky IVay. With hint he takes a part-finished novel,
a B.A. degree and a diploma in journalism of the
Auckland Uni. College. He worked on the Christ-
church Sun before coming to serve a year as assist-
ant leader-writer on the Brisbane Daily Mail.

A belated blaze of sunshine helped to draw
a big crowd to Flemington on Saturday,
when the cool greenness of the lawns and
surrounding hills supplied a restful backing
for a flutter of summer and ’tween-seasons
ehiffonery; but even the fierce blue overhead
failed to out-dazzle the broken patchwork of
myriads of gaily-hued sunshades. Possibly
the sale season’s reduction in the high cost
of brollies had something to do with this
irruption; but, anyhow, it made a brave
show. Tlie new sheath frock was aired in
various editions, some good, some so-so and
some awful. Many wore straight-up-and-
down tubes; others were swathed to the
figure, with the surplus material bunched on
the left side. Sleeves to the wrist and a
straight yoke of a contrasting color hall-
marked all up-to-the-minute dresses. Un-
trimmed millinery, homely as a currant-bun,
was unloaded from the latest liat-boxes from
Paris. Black georgette under fiuttery pointed
capes struck the most alluring notes. One
terrace-trotter, striped round with black and
bright yellow, looked like a giant wasp buzz-
ing along the walk.
Tlie vice-regal pen was well filled bn both
tlie Federal and State sides. Lady Forster
wore her cinnamon marocain caped frock
with a plumed taffetas liat to match; and
Lady Stradbroke her brown marocain, cheered
by a little madonna-blue hat with feathers
on the port side. Lady Dunleath struck a
further note of brown and marocain; and
Lady Ellen Lambert headed grey tailorings
with a black hat. One Stradbroke daughter
topped striped Fuji silk with an apricot lid,
and the other sported fawn brocaded tailor-
ings, with a black velvet hat fronted with
tangerine. Mrs. Charles Butler, from
Hobart, mounted a big blue hat worn with
cream marocain, and Eileen Bell —homing
to Queensland after an English trip—was
striped in blue and navy under a dark-blue
hat. Mrs. Pitt Rivers colored the group
with pale lilac which even topped her golden
head.
Mrs. Clive Leonard’s fairness was set off
by an ivory lace hat-brim over green silk
aproned with lace. Mrs. Tony Hordern, just
back from England, attracted feverish in-
terest in a silk-embroidered marocain tunic of
golden brown over a dull red undersheath,
Avith more dull red in the feathers smother-
ing her big hat. Mrs. Alan Currie looked
particularly well in bouncings of beige geor-
gette, with flower-stalks climbing over the
crown of her lace-brimmed hat. The Fred
Thiel matron had glittering bands hooping
her black dress, while daughter Mavis fea-
tured Paisley effects caped with black and
a mauve liat with a single rose peeping over
the ledge. Mrs. Jim Fairbairn, in brown,
had her neck and bell-shaped hat Avreathed
with orange chiffon, Dr. Leary’s handsome
wife avus curtained in misty black, Judge
Williams’s spouse in cinnamon georgette, the
Robinson lady in navy blue with a fuchsia
hat, and Mrs. John Irvine in waves of mauve
frothed Avith white lace under a big black hat.
Nearly 200 of the Best Known motored
up for Melba’s Coombe Cottage dance. The
first fox-trot Avas released soon after 9
o’clock, and the last at daybreak. Where-
after the dancers, who had been nibbling at
intervals all night, were fortified for the
home run with bacon and eggs. The Dame,
who dispensed her greetings in the hall, bil-
lowed attractively in green-blue georgette,
with silver beads cresting the scalloped hems.
Ropes of pearls wreathed lier neck, and dia-
monds eroAvned her brow. Mrs. George
Armstrong, as second hostess, was in maro-
cain of a deep pink, inlaid with silvery beads
and brilliants. Jazz was dispensed in the
music-room and in a marquee on the lawn,
and the orchestra was of a special ear-split-
ting quality, with a wandering banjoist and
two ragtime vocalists included in its make-
up. The whole thing was perfectly staged,
and as half the whirlers wore paper caps
the scene Avas a gay one. The vice-regal
Stradbrokes were the star guests. The Count-
ess jazzed indefatigably in black encrusted
with silver; daughter Helena also sounded
a silvery note in her jade-green dress,
while daughter Charlotte’s draperies were of
an amethyst shade. Little Lady Pat Black-
Avood—who has booked a return berth to
London —smiled above rose-pink draperies.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers’s graceful figure was
swathed in gold tissue with a tunic of geor-
gette. Lady Dunleath, wlio appeared to be
the only woman present who did not take
the floor, sported black satin and lace. Mrs.
Tony Hordern, just back from an English
trip, had a huge embroidered bird fluttering
round the hip line of her black Paris crea-
tion. Another Sydneysider, Mrs. Alfred
Turnbull, who is off to England _ with her
husband, had crystal bead embroideries on
her lavender gown. Director Henry Russell,
there with his wife, seemed to shrink in
agony each time lie came to close quarters
with the jazz- band.
A big covey of flappers dominated the
dance-floor. The Melbourne bud is nothing
if not unsophisticatedly sophisticated, and
likes to make herself felt. One overseas visi-
tor lifted frosty eyebrow's at the sight of
some young things puffing cigarettes by the
ballroom entrance almost from the minute
the frivol started.. The bobbed head has prac-
tically disappeared, but one or two flapped
in frocks w'hose brevity would shock an up-
to-date dress-builder. Prince Oblensky was
there, of course; and Tommy Cochran, who
was helping the Dame to make a shimmering
success of her party. After supper the jazz-
ers all joined in the fox-trot chorus written
by Beverly Nicholls, Melba’s new secretary,
wlio vainly tried to wear an unconscious look
during the performance.
Having signed in Premier Lawson’s pres-
ence an agreement to act as Vic.’s Agent-
General for three years from August 1,
George Fairbairn lias flitted off to England
via ’Frisco. He began the voyage from Syd-
ney yesterday (March 5) by the Ventura.
Of course, he has with him liis newly-made
bride (Lorna Robertson that was), the trip,
arranged long before his appointment, being
really a continuation of the wedding tour.
The manner in which Fairbairn came to be
sounded whether he would take the job will
some day make an interesting story. The
theory of the downy member of the Cabinet
that “when we’re in a real fix something
always turns up to help us” was borne out.
The cable mentions that pianist Benno
Moiseiwitscli, wffio was here last year, is
seeking a divorce from Daisy Kennedy on
the ground of saucy conduct with dramatist
Drinkwater. When the Moiseiwitsch return
tour of Australia was projected some months
hack it w r as understood that his brilliant
Titian-haired wife was to bring her fiddle
olso, but on the charmer failing to appear
Rumor had an explanation for lier absence
which the cable has amply confirmed.
Drinkwater, who is more intellectual than
beauteous, is understood to have a way with
the ladies, and his association with the
Moiseiwitsches probably began when they
bought a new house in a London suburb and
starting inviting the cream of the Four Arts
to musical evenings, at which Ivreisler and
other giants were often present. Drinkwater
was on the visiting-list at this time, and
used to orate blank verse to at least one
sympathetic listener. There are two hand-
some Moiseiwitsch children.
Meet Janet Mitchell, daughter of the well-
known K.C. and grand-daughter of the late
Dr. Morrison, one-time Principal of Scots’
College. This brainy young woman has just
taken over the
secretarial pen
of the
Y.W.C.A. Edu-
cational De-
partment, in
succession to
Gwen Evans,
who is trans-
ferring to

Janet Mitchell,
who is an Ox-
ford graduate,
is a talented
musician and
is further
equipped with
cons iderable
literary acu-
men, which
will now stand
her in good
stead, as she
is preparing
to carry on the library started by Miss
Evans. During the war years the new
Educational Sec. was in England with lier
mother, and she gained much experience that
will help her in her job. Lafayette made
the photo.
William McKenzie, circulation manager of
Melbourne Herald and once a Rugby inter-
national, took unto himself his second wife
at St. Paul’s the other night, the lady in
the ease being Constance Gibbons, elder
daughter of the John Gibbonses, of St. Kilda.
After the ceremony a vast concourse of news-
paper men and friends attended the Ormond
Hall in Prahran and swept the groaning
board of victuals. The bride, who used to
tickle a typewriter in the Herald office, is
a great-great-grand-daughter of John Scott,
Nelson’s secretary at Trafalgar.
Mrs. Jessie Longstaff, of Shepparton,
mother of artist John, survived her husband
only a few weeks. She was 91. John has
four sisters, three of 'whom are married.
Allen Leeper is steadily climbing in the
diplomatic service. According to news which
has reached his father, the former warden
of Trinity, he has been appointed first see.
to the British Legation at Vienna. Before
Curzon went out of the Foreign Office, young
Leeper was one of his private secs., and the
repository of stacks of embassy secrets.
The wife of the new naval chief, Admiral
Hall-Thompson, is getting her baptism of
local limelight as vice-president of the com-
mittee which is engineering the Fleet WeeK
ball in St. Kilda Town Hall in aid of Queen
Vic. Hospital. The lady is a pleasant-look-
ing matron, and with her flapper daughter
and smaller chick is looking forward to
having a good time in her new surroundings.
For the present the family is sheltering in
a flat at Fasadena Mansions, on the St.
Kilda-road.
The decided features here limned by
Humphries belong to C. O. Inglis, son of
the late Johnny Inglis, for many years judge
with the
V.R.C. After
establish-
ing his effi-
ciency as a
club secretary
for nearly nine
years with the
Bohem lans,
he has now
left his an-
cient haunt at
the instiga-
tion of the
Athenaeum
Club, to tackle
its heavier
s e c r e tarial
job. He de-
parted under
a mixed fire
of congratula-
tions and re-
grets. Like his
father, Hum-
phries is a small, well-proportioned man;
meticulously particular as to his tailorings
and the pronunciation of his name, which
.rhymes with dingles and tingles and little
things like that.
Dolly Stewart’s farewell benefit concert
packed the Town Hall with a well-dressed
audience whose enthusiasm rather out-ran
its discretion in the matter of encores. In
consequence of this half the crowd had per-
force melted away before the final curtain.
But the affair was a great success.
Dolly herself looked ravishing in shiny
clinging draperies, with the front panel
yvashed with filmy green sash-ends. She
sang various songs at the piano, and ended
up gloriously behind a solid bank of com-
plimentary vegetation. The Gaud Mayor
handed her a verbal bouquet, and her father
thanked all concerned in the name of bis
daughter. During the evening the platform
simply scintillated with stars, including Dr.
Price, Gladys McDowell, Myndelle Isaacs,
Louise Dunn, Victor Baxter, Jo Forster,
Alan Murray, Edwin Hames and others;
and Billy Burrell was a perfect accom-
panist.
Henry Russell’s wife, who writes under
the name of Serena Gray, and has launched
various plays and novels, was thrilled by a
N’York cable the other day saying that her
newest play, “Marriage Will Out,” has not
only been passed for production with three
cheers, but is to be released shortly fit a
leading Broadway house.
The kitchen stall at the market fair which
is to be held in Alexandra-avenue on March
21 and 27, to swell the Queen Vic. Hospital
appeal fund, will be heaped with hardware
as an outcome of the gift afternoon hostessed
by Mayoress Brunton and the wives of the
lesser city fathers. The invited came in
shoals, all hugging brown-paper parcels, and
were greeted by Mrs. Brunton in navy niaro-
cain surmounted by a ribbon-tufted hat-brim
crowned with Oriental colorings. Mark
Daly, Mamie Watson, May Beatty and other
members of the Nellie Kelly co. helped the
cause with song. They made rather a welter
of black; but May Beatty lightened her dark-
ness with the gleam of a petunia skirt
under her inky cloak, and Ena Dale sported
a vivid blue wrap.
Columba Back and Jack Cussen escaped
the public eye by getting married in the
Backs’ South Yarra drawing-room. Only
near relatives and a special friend or so were
gathered together to see Father Quy Gavan
Duffy adjust the knot. Included in the few
were Justice Cussen and his family and the
Charlie Duffys. The bride, who was given
away by banker brother-in-law John Dqyle,
substituted a three-piece tailor suit of bis-
cuit-colored velour for the conventional white
draperies, and tucked her handsome head
into a velvet turban instead of a bridal veil.
A flapper niece, Nancy Back, who lately
crossed from California, ’maided in white
organdi inset with lace, while cousin Maurice
Cussen took charge of the ’groom.
Mrs. Pierre Bellew took over part of Men*
zies’ lounge the other afternoon and beckoned
in a group of feminine pals to welcome Mrs.
Strangman, who with her medical husband
has just returned after over four years on tbc
other side of the Equator. The tables were
all bedded with autumn-tinted dahlias
arranged in a Maltese cross and frothed over
with fern foliage. The hostess, in navy blue,
smiled under a wide blue hat-brim support-
ing a flower-wreathed crown. Mrs. Strang-
man, who put in some time in Paris, says it
thrills her to see how cheap good food is
here after the terrific cost of eatables there.
Australians don't know how much they have
to be thankful for, it seems.
The ex-Indian Army officers who came
here under Major Alan Currie’s scheme, to
give woolgrowing a trial on adjoining
Western District runs, are finding life at
least pleasant in that fashionable locality.
Last week a crowd of the new squattocracy
combined to liven Polo Week in the district
with a ball at the official homestead, Leslie
Manor. All the cream of the woolly area
was there, of course, and quite a big crowd
motored up from town. The Pitt Riverses,
who were up for the polo, joined in the jazz,
as did some Manifolds, Chirnsides,
McArthurs, Greenes, Calverts, Staughtons.
and sc on. Several of the hosts’ wives helped
to engi Xeer the frivol.
Doris Mclnnes is among those chosen by
Henry Russell for minor roles during the
grand-opera season. Her soprano has stood
the test of three pianoless years in the
Solomon Islands, and this will be her first
public appearance since leaving the Conser-
vatorium.
Walter Kirby is in Hobart with the sum-
mer throng, and gave a recital in the Town
Hall. Administrator Ewing and his lady
attended, with most of the resident and
visiting heavyweights. A few days later
he sang a specially-picked programme for
the kiddies at. the Orphanage of the Sisters
of Charity, and followed it with a lecture to
the sisters on voice-production.
The hospitality section of the Victoria
League has broadcasted request-the-pleasure
cards for an afternoon tea in the Alexandra
Club reception parlors, on March 11, to
meet the visiting Countess of Harrowby. Mrs.
Harry Emmerton is shouldering the secre-
tary’s pen. As Lord Harrowby is not men-
tioned in the despatches, it is presumed that
the affair will be for us only.
Ruby Brennan, who steamed oversea early
last year, is back again, and has established
herself as a fashion dictator to the Heavily
Gilded. As Australian representative of
Reville she now reigns behind a glass v ; n
dow in the portion of Collins-street oicc
known as Doctors’ Commons.
The river of Fleet Week jazz, having
overflowed every available night, will spread
into the afternoons. The Harry Paynes
will lead off with a mixed garden party and
foxtrot on the 18tli, and Mrs. Lob Knox
has bagged the following afternoon for a tea-
dance at her Toorak home, Greenknowe.
Adelaide drops a line or two: —
A bowling club has been added to our list ot
feminine allurements. At the Kensington Gardens
green they’ve even got as far as mixed matches.
The idea has sprouted from seed sown three years
ago, when a mixed match was arranged to raise
funds for Minda, which is down for another benefit
performance this week.
•Jessie Webb had a hectic two days here. Local
committee-women descended upon her when she got
out of the East-West train on Tuesday evening; on
Wednesday she lunched with the Lyceum Club (and
spoke), tea-ed with the Mayoress (and spoke again),
and lectured for the League of Nations in the even-
ing ; and on Thursday, before boarding the Melbourne
express, she had as many private engagements to fit
in as would last most people a week. Dr. Gertrude
Halley was her hostess while she was here.
Margaret Darnley Naylor, bound for England in
April, will make the Save the Children Fund her
special job when she gets to the Cold Country. She
plans to work under the wing of Cecilia John.
South Australians continue to give a good account
of themselves in music. Ivy Philips has engagements
booked in London that will keep her going till the
end of April, and is due for another series of con-
certs in Wales. And we’re pluming ourselves that
Elford Mack has been chosen as principal ’cellist
for Melba’s grand operas.
Dr. Marie Brown is making another bid for a sea,
in the City Council, this time as Independent candi-
date at a by-election in a city ward. The Womens
Non-Party Assoc, is backing her.
The Blind School is rejoicing in a parcel of Braille
from Lady Weigall, who has kept alive her interest
in the institution. The school has to thank her foi
its pia no, for it was bought out of funds raised at
a concert organised by her Ex. at Government
House. ,
The old John Downer home in North Adelaide
(soon to be the University’s residential college,
but empty at the moment) was gay enough on
Saturday night when the Gordoii MacFarlanes ga-e
a dance, with the Griffiths Cup visitors as the P r,ri
cipal guests. Equally festive was the Griffiths Cup
dinner, with A. G. Rymill in the chair to hand
the Cup over to its new owner. There were no
untoward incidents in this year’s race, anyway

Quintus’s Newmarket was run in the
record time of lmin. llisec., and once more the
argument in favor of the outer rails was justified bv
results. Tape measure or no tape measure, drawers
of high-numbered marbles get an advantage of yards
over Numbers 1 and 2 and thereabouts in the
“straight six.” Blackadder drew 28, whilst Una
Carlos drew 27 and Quintus was 20. The squibb.v
mare got away with a three-lengths’ lead, so Munro,
the rider of the winner, said, and he should know.
His own mount was second most of the way. The
rails kept Una Carlos straight, as in the Standish
on New Year’s Day, but they were no use to Black-
adder, who, having started next to Una, was out
among the low marbles when he made his final dasli
and captured second money in the last few strides.
Apart from the well-positioned trio there was nothing
in the race. Easingwold, who finished fourth, had
drawn No. 25 marble, but the crowd never called
his name vociferously, whereas Quintus and Una
Carlos were always, in a manner of speaking, in the
multitude’s mouth.
Matters discussed with animation after the race
were Blaekadder’s fine finishing run and the uncom-
mon ill-luck of Darcy. Eceles in having sold both
Royal Thought and Quintus out of his stable. Royal
Thought robbed Eccles of an Oakleigh Plate coup
by beating Quintus, and then he robbed himself of
a Newmarket victory by selling Quintus for £l5OO
to T. M. Burke. Burke" is a dealer in real estate who
is declared to have taken up racing for sport’s sake.
He was astonished at the obvious on Saturday. The
victory of Quintus was clear to those about, yet he
didn’t quite believe it till the numbers went up.
It was an evil day for- the punting brotherhood.
Dalcross, the Hurdle "winner, was unbacked at 20 to
1. The same with Sandringham, conqueror of
Drongo and Frances Tressady in the St. Leger; he
also was 20 to 1, and that in a field of four. For-
tune’s perversity was accentuated in the disgrace of
Frances Tressady in a race where the one mare in
the-field had a traditional right to shine. The first
accepted autumn day should have been a day for
mares, who have had such a great season, yet no mare
ran better than a moderate second, and only three
of the sex scored places. Surprises were the ruinous
rule. Arendal, a twovear-old son of Beragoon,
downed the champion Heroic irt the Sires' Produce
Stakes—luckily, perhaps, for Heroic was interfered
with. Then there were four better favorites than
Benoni, winner of the last race, and one of them —
Eecles’s The Cypher—lost a lot more oof for the
public.
The Hawk might have won his recent races under
more testful circumstances. Nevertheless he stands
associated with the Devil’s own luck. Claro was
removed from the rich Caulfield Futurity States at the
eleventh hour because a foreleg was under suspicion.
Rivoli broke down on the track a few hours previous
to his expected fight with The Hawk for the Essendon
Stakes. The Maorilander was to have great goes
Provided for him, but the great goers went amiss,
leaving the Martian gelding with nothing much to
beat. Luck was against more than one English
horse at Caulfield and Flemington. Claro’s leg gave
hipi no chance, and Crowdennis resumed his early
English habit of whipping round when the barrier
rose in his face.

After Accarak’s success in the Australian

fashionable a year or more ago, that “the Wooraks
can’t stay.” Ben Chaffey’s five-year-old had been

torious third to Bitalli and Rivoli on the first Tues-

Winner for the generality of punters at 5 to 1. In
the places were Jackstaff and T. M. Burke’s El
Dorado, who was as sore as a boil the day before
the race, and hadn’t got rid of the trouble when
the barrier rose. In the circumstances he did well
to run third.
Validolid (Valido-Ilemlock) was a horrible
failure in w.f.a. company at Brisbane, but he has
a useful turn of speed when thoroughly fit, as he is
now, and racing among horses in his own class.
At Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday, carrying Sst.
91b. and starting favorite at 5 to 2, he won the
10-furlongs March Handicap from Duet, a nice cut
of a three-year-old filly that will probably do better,
and Dick Wootton’s English-bred liikumon. Booster,
Sir Walter (too much of a handful for his boy rider)
and King Carlos were close to the place-getters, but
Balaton was an inglorious last. The imported horse
looked very burly, and the apprentice on top could
do nothing with him.
“S.T.y.”: The go-ahead Port Adelaide
Racing Club installed a cinema last year >on its
course at Cheltenham to take a record of all finishes.
The newspapers boomed the innovation, but; it was
never popular with owners, and it has now been
dropped. An instantaneous decision is what the pub-
lic wants, and the trifling risk of the judge making
a mistake can be chanced.
* * * *
“15-30” : The personnel of the Davis Cup
team doesn’t justify optimism regarding its chances
against the U.S.A., but it ought to reach the chal-
lenge round. Patterson is a bit thick and stocky
from underwork, but as soon as he gets to America
and starts to practise he ought to put up better
performances than he gave in Sydney last week.
Although I don’t think he will trouble either Tilden
or Johnston, one never knows what he will do after
two or three months’ solid devotion to the game.
An extraordinary young man, he has belted his way
to the front rank by the sheer strength of Ins fore-
hand play. If he can get his service working he is
quite capable of rolling up Johnston’s front as
Anderson did. Tilden must, however, he regarded
as his master. Much has been said of Sehlesinger,
who is almost too orthodox, but if O’Hara Wood's
shoulder doesn’t go back on him that, under-rated
y oung man should be the second string. Wood has been
singularly unlucky as a, singles performer. He had
Anderson looking very serious at Wimbledon in 1922
when a net-cord shot came to the Cornstalk’s rescue ;
and the Victorian was within match-point of a
straight-three triumph over the brilliant Spaniard
Alonzo when he was foot-faulted. The decision was
questioned by players who saw the tussle ; anyhow, it
so upset Wood that he lost the battle. Such mis-
fortunes are enough to make a man burn his racquets
and become a Justice of the Peace.

There were a couple of surprises to re-
lieve the monotony of the M.C.C. tennis tournament.
One was the defeat of the Grace Park specialist,
G. N. Roberts, by the youthful G. W. R. Dickinson;
the other the downfall of Miss Boyd and Mclnnes
in the mixed doubles. The victors were Wertheim
and Miss De Bavay, who are not ordinarily an effec-
tive combination, but Wertheim’s pretty partner
placed some of her shots very well, and the tower-
ing piano-manufacturer compensated for some idiotic
errors with some sparkling cross-court drives. Mc-
Innes’s game lacked concentration, whilst Miss Boyd
seemed slack in her ground play and also registered
double faults.

“Jamwood” : “Slip” Carr, back in Sydney
on a brief visit to his people, has made the sensible
suggestion that the lawn-tennis authorities should
add Kalms and J. Willard to the Olympic Games
team. The Olympic Federation would be glad to
have them, and KalmS, as Carr points out, could
compete in the contests at the Colombes Stadium
without interfering
with his Davis
Cup programme.
Or Clemenger, who
has the knack of
rising to the
occasion, and whose
recent form has
been surprisingly
good, might be sub-
stituted for Kalms.
The lawn-tennis
associations have
ample credit bal-
ances, and a black
smudge will be
left on their sport-
ing reputation if
they don’t arrange
for some representa-
tion at the Games.

“15-30”: Temperamentally, the most un-
orthodox player in Australian tennis is the Victorian
Wertheim. Indifferent to the convention that com-
pels almost everybody else to look as impassive as
an iceberg, “Soss” makes no attempt to hide his
joy or despair. In doubles he will yell “Mine!”
when going for an easy sitter, and then smash it
into the net amid a roar of laughter. After a
failure of this sort he will be seen shaking his head
in a violent argument with the subconscious “Soss”
who was responsible for the fiasco, and the next
moment will be just as dramatically admonishing
his partner for some slip of the racquet. Ball-boys
dare not attempt to' sleep while Wertheim is about,
and the sight of his two yards or so of physique
pausing to reproach an infant who has failed to
feed him with balls at the required moment is
enough to make even a pqjitical caricaturist forget
for the moment his melancholy lot. “Soss” is no
respecter of umpires either. He has no compunction
about reversing a decision giVen wrongly, in his
favor, by autocratically altering the score, instead
of putting the matter right by purposely registering
an error in the next rally. He is a fine sportsman
withal. There is no one warmer in his congratula-
tion of the victor, even though a few moments be-
fore he has been wild with himself over some bad
shot.
“Linesman”: Manoel Alonzo has beaten
Tilden again—he is the only foreigner who has
ever done it twice. The Spaniard’s first victory
happened in a Middle Western championship some
time back; the second occurred only the other day
and ran to five chapters, in which each won a 6 —l
set. The match was played in an indoor tournament,
in which form of tennis Alonzo is probably more
experienced than Tilden, but still the American would
readily adapt himself to a fast, smooth surface suit-
able for the skidding shots in which he excels. As
usual, Tilden’s defeat is put down to staleness or
something of the sort. When Anderson humbled the
pride of Johnston, in New York last year, Tilden
was one of the first to broadcast the notion that
Johnston was off his game. Yet a shrewd English
critic who saw the battle has stated that Anderson
was invincible that day.
* * * *
“Big Iiotoo”: I agree that there are too
many swimmers in the Olympic team (B. 28/2/’24),
but cannot understand why the omission of Brancourt,
the N.S.W. heavyweight, should occasion surprise.
With all his tremendous physical advantages, to say
nothing of the moral effect the sight of such a giant
must have on an opponent, Brancourt has so far
failed to accomplish a clear-cut victory, either by
a k.o. or on points. His last fight with Jardine,
a man much smaller in every way, resulted in Bran-
court getting a decision which, in the opinion of
most of the newspaper critics and the crowd, he had
not earned. A fast heavyweight packing a “wood-
ener” would have no difficulty in impressing the fact
on Brancourt that a mountain of man with a wander-
ing wallop is not necessarily a champion.
“H.S.” : A Sydney leader-writer observed,
apropos Bert Spargo’s verdict of £lO5O 10s. for
injuries sustained on a Melbourne tram, that “there
are few callings in which a hefty young fellow with
the necessary physique can punch his way to fortune
so quickly as in boxing.” In a literal sense, of
course, there are none.’ In the other sense almost
any form of toil, if persisted in faithfully, offers
better prospects. The catch in boxing as a calling
is not that pugilists squander what they earn. The
modern pug of the Spargo type is as canny as any
trader. The tragedy of the game is that, while
every other working lad with “the necessary phy-
sique” thinks he is a prospective world-beater, only
about one in a thousand has a hope of earning an
occasional fiver in a preliminary bout. Physique—as
Harry Stone, Kid Lewis, Jimmy Wilde and scores
of other weeds have proved —has little or nothing to
cio with success in the ring. Macartney is a wonder-
ful bat .chiefly because he can see a cricket ball a
fraction of a second sooner than the next man.
Spargo has been making £4OOO a year for a couple
of years because something in his brain responds
with marvellous speed to the motions of assault and
battery. Without that mysterious gift, which is as
rare as the idiosyncrasy that produces an Inman or
a Tilden,. Spargo would be the harmless little
mediocrity he looks when not in action. Needless
to say, other qualities are needed. Bombardier Wells,
as pretty and fast a boxer as England ever pro-
duced, was a failure because lie couldn’t take a
punch on the jaw. Willard became champion of the
world for a time by sheer wffight of meat. But,
above everything else, a mental quality is required
which is as rare as that which produces great dratna-
tists and poets.
N.S.W. was too good for Maoriland in
the first Test at Christchurch. M.L. fell for 144 in
the first innings, but Dacre (127), Smith (52) and
Blunt (46) lifted the second effort to 329. N.S.W.
got 361 (Hendry 110) and 2 fbr 113. Dacre is an
Aucklander and a dashing right-hander; in local
cricket this year he has aggregated 246 runs,
averaging 49.20. In winter-tinte he plays soccer, and
has secured a position in the M.L. side. Collins,
the Maoriland captain, took a finishing course in
cricket at Cambridge. He got his blue in 1910 and
figured against Oxford in the Le Couteur match —
so called because the Vic. Rhodes scholar made 160
and took 11 for 65.
“Tren”: T. C. Lowry, who has been
elected captain of the Cambridge XI, is the first
“colonial” to lead the -Light Blues since the days
of Sammy Woods. Lowry learned his cricket at
Christchurch (M.L.), and on taking up residence at
Cambridge made 183 in three hours in the Fresh-
men’s match. He performed so ably for Somerset
that a place was found for him in McLaren’s team
that visited this quarter last year. His best per-
| formance on the tour was 130 against Wellington
| (M.L.). On the young man’s return to England he
showed wonderfully improved form. His average for
the Uni. —48.95—was fourth in the All-England list,
and he turned out for Gents, v. Players. He is an
exceptional field anywhere, even behind the wicket.
“Winkle” : Frank Tarrant was not the
first great all-rounder of that name (B. 21/2/’24).
George Tarrant, who visited Australia in 1863 witii
Parr’s unconquered eleven, is still named among the
world’s greatest fast bowlers, and he likewise got
heaps of runs. At single-wicket games George was
unrivalled. After he had helped his side to an easy
Victory against an Ararat 22, he achieved a draw
single-handed against the 11 best countrymen. He
rattled them out for’ four, and was caught after
making four himself. At Ballarat he and E. M.
Grace beat eight star diggers by 20 runs to 12. The
same pair, in Maoriland, defeated an Otago XI by
one run.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: He was a newly-
arrived Yank, who had never seen a cricket match
before. And, unfortunately for the Sydney friend
who had induced him to go, it proved to be one
of those deadly slow engagements which have be-
come the rule in the first-grade competition. There
was an oppressive silence, broken only by the occa-
sional crack of bat on ball, and then, in a voice
louder than usual, one of the umpires said “Over!”
“Wassat?” demanded the Yank. “Oh, it’s just
over!” returned his friend. With a sigh of relief
Hiram G. Spreadeagle jumped to his feet, ready
to depart. “Thank Gahd for that!” he exclaimed.
“Thought the darn thing might lasst alia affter-
noon!”
Adelaide chib cricket saw some sensa-
tional bowling lately, but unfortunately none of it
was by young players, Arthur Richardson, playing
for the Colts (but only as their coach and captain),
took 7 for 16 and 4 for 34 in one afternoon against
Kensington.. Glenelg v. University was a day out
for two plump veterans, Whitty and Pincombe—an
old St. Peter’s boy who has lately returned from
Broken Hill to live at Glehelg. The students totals
were 65 and 33. Whitty had 4 for 27 and o tor 18 ;
Pincombe 4 for 0 (hat-trick) and 5 for 9.
* * * *
“Centurion” : I never had any doubt about
Crossland throwing (B. 28/2/’24). For one thing,
I was a kid in Lancashire when that worthy s
career came to a dramatic finish, as tar as
county cricket was concerned. lie had a vol-
canic temper and was chiefly tolerated because ot
his alleged ascendancy over the Yorkshire batsmen.
To beat Yorkshire in the annual match was all that
the Lancashire lads in those days lived for, in sum-
mer-time at least. But the day came when Cross-
laud was no-balled. After the fifth delivery had
been ruled out, the bowler shied his cap at the
umpire and kicked the stumps out of the ground. He
followed this up by damning the eyes of Ink cap-
tain, A. N. Hornby, who had expostulated with him.
This, to “Monkey” Hornby, on Old Trafford, was
akin to sacrilege. Crossland went under in a flash
of flame and a strong smell of sulphur.
T. A. STIRTON, horseowner and A.J.C.
committeeman.
“D.” : In Sydney the man who aspires to
start a golf links comes under a sort of Most Fav-
ored Citizen proviso, and he and his friends get
carte blanche to do what would be shouted down in
the case of mere municipalities or Shire Councils.
The recent granting by the Water Board to certain
golfing enthusiasts of a 24 years’ lease, at a yearly
rental of £ 1 per acre, of 283 acres between Kensing-
ton and Botany is an example of the tendency which
is as flagrant in its way as the George’s Heights
scandal. The value of real estate in those parts will
have appreciated enormously inside the next ten
years (it is the only direction in which the city
proper can now expand), and for the remaining 14
years stout gentlemen will be banging balls about
an empty landscape which will then be about ten
times too costly for such a purpose. Randwiek race-
course is already an anomaly, and its removal to a
less costly and' populated region cannot long be
delayed, but golf links come in a different category,
apparently, in the opinion of politicians and the
departments, that politicians influence. The only
comfort residents of the locality are likely to get is
the knowledge that the golf-club promoters haven’t
been able to buy the 283 acres at bargain rates. The
astute business men who founded the Sydney Golf
Club at Rose Bay were able to do this 20-odd years
ago, with the result that the proceeds of the sale of
some of their unwanted acres sufficed to pay for one
of the most luxurious clubhouses in the world.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Melbourne Inman, one of the few
billiardists with any personality to speak of, appears
to have struck an awful snag in champion Smith,
who suggested that Inman’s recent attack of vertigo
was due to his having dropped 2000 points behind
in the early stages of a match, after receiving
1500 points start. It is Inman’s complaint nowadays
that all the new top-notehers play far above their
usual game when opposed to him. The veteran
seems to forget that he was declared, of yore, to
have a manner and method which partially paralysed
opponents and made them play below their average
game. The fact seems to be that all the other
pros, are affected by Inman. The older ones are
depressed and the newcomers are nerved up to con-
cert pitch by contact with him. Australia remem-
bers Melbourne Inman as a smileless, Jewish-looking
person, who always seemed in deadly earnest.
“Lexite” : In fulfilment of his threat when
disqualified last season that he would never play for
the N.S.W. Rugby League again, Duncan Thompson,
N. Sydney’s skipper and half-back, is returning to
Queensland, and will coach Toowoomba. Toowoomba s
first offer was £2OO per season, with a five-years’
guarantee, but when another Queensland club began
angling for Duncan’s services Toowoomba bid higher
and got him. Thompson is a native of Warwick
(Q.), and represented the north-eastern State against
N.S.W. in 1915.
“Full-back”: Billy Farnsworth, one of the
best utility backs ever supplied by the N.S.W.
Rugby LTnion to the League, has returned to Sydney
after a long stay in England. Billy, with his brother
Fiv, played with the old Newtown Union team, and
both ’verted to the League in 1910. He went to
England with the League Kangaroos in 1911, and,
with several other Australian and M.L. members of
the team, signed up with a Northern Union club —
in Billy’s case Oldham, otherwise “Owdham.” He
was a fine five-eighth of the solid type, with a strong
defence, and did well in England. Like all his
mates though, once his playing days were over he had
to come back to Australia.
KISS IN THE RING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The French boxing authorities have consented to
j-elax the rule that pugilists must exchange kisses
before assaulting one another. In future the British
jiaudshake will be sufficient.”
In France, before these pugilistic trials,
One gathers it was always comma il' jaut
That bruisers on each other’s battered dials
Reciprocal caresses should bestow
Ere they began to empty out the vials
Of fistic force and prowess on the foe.
Yet ’tvvould appear that even Gauls were galled
At being required to mug before they mauled.
These labial pecks at one another’s faces
As tokens of good feeling seem, mayhap,
Entirely proper to the Latin races,
Even with each participant a “chap” ;
Yet some, ’tis obvious, shied at such embraces
As prelude to a sanguinary scrap.
How else explain the wish to substitute
The English handshake for the French salute.
No more shall Jacques his foeman’s soft, caressing
Lip-touch upon his jowl or forehead feel
And linger for a moment, acquiescing,
Before he starts, as ’twere, to make a meal
Of his opponent, without salt or dressing,
And baste his ribs and tap his cochineal —
And leave him with a “kisser” so amiss
It can’t be twisted into shape to kiss.
A quaint prelimin’ry ma foi! to plugging,
So let the tender ceremony go.
Somehow it never seemed to sort with slugging
Even when tendered by a sport with so
Enormous a propensity for mugging
As courteous and gallant Jean Crapaud.
Or can it be ’twas Battling Siki’s face
That made unpopular this form of “grace”?

r< Jj-L.O. : the staff of the Border Watch, Mt.
Lambier (k.A.), ran claim a long-distanee record
" , lwo - The editor, John Watson, now in his
90th year (he was the town’s first mayor), has
been in the chair for 60 years. The head of the
l' , ! , ' :ni V staff, James Watson (no relation of the
chief), has been 53 years in his job. The combined
years of service of three other members of the staff
pass the century.
I’edro”: This is a true one. The young reporter
doing rounds’ over the ’phone thought the answer-
ing voice from the supposed police station was very
sweet for' a policeman’s, but he went ahead, so:
Sydney Morning Teleguard here. Anything doing?”
<< l_ l your pardon ?” came back the voice gaily.
Lot anything on to-night?” chirruped the scribe.
‘ What ! Father, come”—- But with scorched ears
the boy had fled the burning deck.
P. J. Nally, who compiles information about
Queensland for the Theodore Government, and inci-
dentally to lure thither the impressionable immigrant,
served his apprenticeship with the Warwick Argus
(S.Q.), in the days when Arthur Morgan, then plain
Mister, was in charge of the scissors and paste-pot.
"ally is off to America in a few days on a health
trip, and will do a bit of spell-binding whenever be
can get a Yank to stop talking and listen to him.
“Headline”: Melbourne Herald is an assiduous
borrower of features from London papers. The head-
ing of its daily joke, “Who Told You That?” is from
the Evening News, and the manner and style of
its causerie column are modelled on the same English
sheet. Its “My Nature Diary” par is a copy of
“To-day in the Country” in the Daily Mail, North-
<Life’s darling, its weekly “Through My Glad Eyes”
is an imitation of Jane Doe’s “Through the Glad
Eyes of a Woman,” which, with an article by Robert
Blatchford, occupies the front page of the Sunday
Chronicle each week. In fact, about the only
original feature is a thrice-weekly contribution by
C. J. Dennis. An Australian paper ought to be
more Australian than that.
Te Pam”: Police roundsmen on Sydney dailies
are being sorely tried these days in the rush for
“scoops.” The very mention of a “dope” syringe
will send one office into a perfect frenzy of antici-
pation, while a “closed green shutter sadly sombre
in the soft sunlight” is examined by another for
possible clues wherewith to hamper the police. The
S. M. Herald nian is careful to wipe all the blood-
stains from the razor, while the News smacks its
lips over every drop. In a Woollalira case a man
and his wife were found on the 16th day after
the murder and suicide. It was in a flat in the
worst days of February; nevertheless, the D.T. man
got a medicated mask and dashed into the foetid
room looking for unconsidered trifles to embellish
his story—and the paper’s “art” columns.
“G.8.L.”: W. Davis Wright, Of Yass (N.S.W.),
whose “Canberra” I reviewed for the Red Page, is
now writing his reminiscences of the past six or
seven decades. The old battler is extremely proud
of three things—of his family, which traces itself
back to Henry Vll.’s time; of being the oldest sur-
viving descendant of an original settler of the
Federal Territory; and of a letter in praise of his
book, “Canberra,” received from Buckingham Palace,
in which George V. and Edward P. joined to con-
gratulate him on his long Australian record. The
old chap is in his 83rd year, his. sight is failing
and his hand is shaky, but the pioneer spirit keeps
him to his task. He sells his books as well as he
can himself, for Sydney booksellers wanted a 35 per
cent, commission, and the thought of it alongside
his own old 2| p.c. commission on auction sales
was nearly too much for him.
“M.D.” : I feel inclined after reading “The Rover,”
a new romance of post-revolutionary France, to
join with Inky Way writers who find Conrad tire-
some. Passing over the sloppy sentences with which
the story abounds I find that he lays himself open
to correction for the unwarrantable liberties he
takes with a day-old moon. As thus: —
“The day-old moon was high enough to have
shortened the shadows”....
“The moon is about to rise”....
“The great clouds. .. .were moving westward be-
fore the rising m00n”....
“Just before the moon rose the captain came on
deck”....
The same moon was still shining at midnight and
was the only witness of the meeting between Peyrol
and Lieutenant Real. Even I, a mere city person,
could tell Conrad that a five-days-old moon sets
about 10 p.m.
“Te Pana”: O’Brien and sundry other South Sea
fictionists have drawn glowing pictures of the natives
of Papeete, Tahiti. From Hiva Oe to Suva, and
back again, the French town is known as “the Sink
of the Pacific.” Mostly the Papeete, native is weak
and undersized, and smitten with yaws and scrofula
and other loathsome maladies. His is the home of
elephantiasis, and scores of victims make a living on
steamer days by selling picture post-cards showing
close-ups of the ghastly disease to morbid-minded
tourists. In the bad old days, when Lovinia ran
the best pub, touts would assemble on the verandahs
after dinner, and for half a franc lead the way to
native huts where elephantiasis could be seen in all
its beastliness. When the German fleet in passing
blew half the town to pieces it did a service to the
whole Pacific.
REPETITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The rumble of the thunder dies
Upon the beaten shore,
Ihe lightning- flickers from the skies
Mosquitoes take the place of flies,
The lover sighs his last good-byes
And Night has come once more.
Ere long the trams will cease to growl
Outside my cottage door;
The wind wails in my chimney-cowl;
The am’rous cat is on the prowl;
1 hear my neighbor’s bandog howl,
As oft he howled of yore.
Amid such sounds, on such a night,
The Muse should yield her store,
And fill my brain with visions bright,
And urge me to poetic flight,
And bid me of the raptures write
That rack me to the core.
Alas! In vain I beat my head,
And tramp my study floor.
She brings the words to Fancy wed,
But who shall w-ork the horse that’s dead ?
Enough ! I’d better go to bed—•
It’s all been said before!

“Tons of Money,” the straight farce con-
verted into a musical comedy, now running
at Sydney Grand Opera House, looks like a
winner and a money-spinner. Also it is a
rib-tickler, the various roles assumed by
Aubrey Allington—dandified and bard-up
inventor, Spanisli-American ranchman, bleat-
ing curate and two or three other things—-
and the plot woven about a bunch of alleged
heirs, who chase each other through the last
act like a moving row of shadow shapes, be-
ing enough to make and keep any audience
merry. Add to this that the costumes are
dazzling, the ballets novel and dainty, the
dancing full of grace and spirit, the songs
and music alluring, and all the materials for
a highly-successful run are to hand. “Tons
of Money” impresses one as having been
staged, too, with thoroughness and attention to
detail; even the Thames discernible in the
offing in the second act looks more like that
venerable stream as it meanders past Maiden-
head than anything the writer ever remem-
bers to have seen hitherto on pasteboard.

Dorothy Brunton, as Louise Allington, is
winsome in crinoline and demurely roguish
in anything. She was greeted on Saturday
night with a roar, and her new songs went
like small change. Charles Heslop, as the
lady’s resourcefully adaptable husband
pushed into one prepostei-ous part after an-
other, is quaint and whimsical. His flow
of volubility in the first act is too rapid for
effectiveness; later his facial abilities get
fuller play. His best song is “The Long,
Long Wait.” Amy Rochelle plays Jean
Everard archly, and shows herself a singer
of quality. Millie Engler is a capital Aunt
Benita. Elsie Parkes and Oliver McLennan
as dancing partners are delightful samples
of glowing youth and vivacity, and John
Kirby deserves a word as a deal truer to life
than the average family lawyer of the stage.
Herbert Frawley, the bent and gnarled old
gardener; Compton Coutts, the butler;
“THE MAN IN THE DRESS CLOTHES,”
AT MELBOURNE PALACE.
Ellaline Terriss as Germaine Comtesse
d' Artois; Frederick Lloyd as Henri de
la Tour, who lives on the cinema rights
of his duels. Lucien Comte d’ Artois
(Seymour Hicks), dispossessed of
everything hut his evening dress clothes
and the housemaid’s bed, has to go to
sleep till the street lamps are lit. Frank
Dunn as Lucien, his valet.
Maidie Field, the maid; and Andrew Hig-
ginson and George Maitland, both in the
missing-heir line, complete an excellent cast.
At Sydney Cri. the Vanbrugli-Boucicault
combination will make another change on
Saturday, when “Mis’ Nell o’ New Orleans’’
steps down and “The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray” makes lier piquant and always wel-
come appearance.
“Sybil" continues to win the glad hand
and the enraptured eye, also the entranced
ear, at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Between
whiles the stalls and the d.c. may catch
themselves wondering what happiness
mightn’t even now be in store for Russia if
the Bolshies would quit their reconstruction
work and hand over the job to musical
comedians.
“De Luxe Annie” has been succeeded at
Sydney Royal by “My Lady’s Dress,” in
which Emelie Polini orders a hundred-guinea
gown for the subjugation of a doddering but
influential squire of dames, and, in visions
induced by a headache cure, reconstructs
the little comedies and tragedies associated
with the processes of manufacture —this with
the assistance of Frank Harvey, Katie Tow-
ers, Gerald Kay Souper, John Fernside and
others. Knoblock’s play is no stranger to
Sydney, and familiarity hasn’t bred admira-
tion for the maudlin .episodes of the consump-
tive French silk-weaver and the snivelling
Cockney hunchback who sells her golden
tresses to save her sister from the disgrace
of a three-palind wadding. But there is
good fun in the comedietta of the Dutch dude
turned lace-buyer for the nonce ; and the grim
amour in the Siberian fur-shanty would be
more impressive if the successful lover didn’t
keep the audience wondering whether he
most resembled a navvy, a fettler or a rouse-
about in a country pub. And in the powerful
study of the man-milliner and the mannequin
who stabs him with the scissors, Frank
Harvey is a compelling figure. In fact, “My
Lady’s Dress” gives Harvey a fine oppor-
tunity to show how versatile he is and how
effective he can be. Miss Polini is not so
well suited, and nobody else has much to do.

Julian Rose lias brought Levinsky to
Sydney Tivoli with a heavy load of trouble,
most of which is laid at the door of Henry
Ford. The only reliable point about his car
is the self-stopper; file machine is guaranteed
to go 30,000 miles- —but, as he says, who
wants to push a car 30.000 miles? Julian
is one of Musgrove's biggest catches, and,
even though the rest of the programme is
only moderate, he should keep the box-office
working overtime.
The Consul-General for Poland and Mrs.
George Earp introduced violinist Stempin-
ski to a section of Sydney’s musical world
and a small wedge of the public on Monday
afternoon-. - The> Japanese earthquake may
have swallowed up the violinist’s modest for-
tune, but it did not shake his art. He fiddled
his way into favor with Greig’s Sonata itt
C Minor, Saint-Saens’s “Le Cygne,” and a
Debussy and other compositions. The Polish
musician studied under Barcawicz in War-
saw ; he intends to make his home in Sydney,
and will teach for his bread and butter.
“Only 38” keeps Sydney Globe’s pay-
window smiling this week. Gay Girl marries
Dull Dog, and at 38 she begins to think that
it isn’t much of a world, after all. But then
she meets the Professor, and he’s the silver
lining. “Daddy,” one of Jackie Coogan’s
best, is at Hoyt’s. The same theatre shelters
“The Six-Fifty,” which debates how far a
wife’s loyalty to her husband should go. At
the Empress “The Poverty of Riches” re-
peats the familiar story that poverty and
easy slippers are worth more than riches
and tight boots. “When Odds Are Even,”
the supporting film, is a real thriller, deal-
ing with the trouble that arises when more
than one party is seeking an option over the
same black-opal mine. The not unfamiliar
theme of love triumphing over snobbery per-
vades “The Barricade,” at the Strand. The
other feature is “Your Friend and Mine”
with Australia’s own Enid Bennett in the
lead. “The White Flower” is still blooming
at the Crystal Palace. A feature of this
picture is an old darkie reputed to have seen
113 summers, and either the oldest actor in
the world or one of its best liars.
At the end of last week “The Man in
Dress Clothes” at Melbourne Palace looked
a little more unbalanced and unrehearsed in
places by reason of the fact that Joan King-
don had joined Barbara Hoffe in the hospi-
tal and had left her part in the hands of
Mione Stewart. The shapely Australian
makes a becoming picture of the naughty
Foxtrot, but her style is inadequate and the
false ring of levity in her tones emphasises
the effect of a girlish masquerade. Some
improvement may be expected when the
damsel has a bit more practice, but she
will never express an improper bedside man-
ner any better than Ellaline Terviss will
reveal the soul of the Comtesse d’Artois.
Miss Terriss, who was still reading some of
her lines when this paper last saw her, re-
mains a terror to diabetic subjects. Her
sweetness is too beautiful for this world.
Tn the circumstances one must congratulate
Seymour Hicks, who, apparently braced up
by the lack of feminine support, is endeavor-
ing to carry off the show by his own virtuo-
sity. And in most respects he succeeds. He
is never theatrically overcome by his alleged
unworthiness as a husband. Nor does he
slip into sentimentality when the provoca-
tion is intense. He has the art, rare in the
best mummers, of toying with Pathos without
screwing its neck.
“Sally” leaves Melbourne Royal to-morrow
night with the ambition of starting another
record somewhere else. On Saturday Gert-
rude Elliott’s gentle voice will be heard again
“TONS OF MONEY,” AT SYDNEY
GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
Charles Heslop (Aubrey) masquerading as
George from Mexico.
in “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,” which is said
to create the suspicion that its author, Alfred
Savoir, is a relation of that notable fellow,
Savoir Vivre.
Popular acclamation keeps everybody at
concert pitch in “Little Nellie Kelly” at
Melbourne Princess’s. Only Ireland Cutter
has abated some of his vivacity, but that
usually cheerful character i« understood to
have suffered a recent accident and is con-
fining himself to smiling wanly while he
nurses his wounds. Elsewhere there is noth-
ing fresh to report, except that the wily
detective, who is sometimes frankly dis-
guised as Mel. Ward, has taken to wearing
shiny boots and spats. There is no particu-
lar reason for the change unless the lad is
trying to give a touch of Bruce to his spider.

Lawrence Grossmith’s pretty bijou style
in “The Silver Fox” appears a little remote
in a big theatre like Melbourne Majesty’s,
arid the effect of mot and epigram is compar-
able to sipping a liqueur in a town hall.
All the same, the actor is again gracefully
presenting the character of Edmund Quilter
with a delightful impertinence on the moral
plane that excites the latent Methodism of
poet Chris to a Rotoruan outburst at the
end of the second act. On Saturday “The
Cabaret Girl” is due to enlighten the multi-
tude on another phase of frothy nocturnal
life.
Having had some practice in falling dead
as Othello, Oscar Asche will bring himself
into violent collision with the floor as the
rorty Maldonada in “Iris” on Saturday. This
revival at the King’s is for six nights only.
Asche proposes to then crack the whip
in “The Taming of the Shrew.”

Melbourne will have two big musical fix-
tures on the 15th. W T hile Fritz Hart’s Con-
servatorium pupils are doing Purcell’s “Dido
and iEneas,” at the Playhouse, in the
presence of Melba, Alberto Zelman’s Sym-
phony Orchestra will be ploughing through
a popular programme of selections at the
Town Hall. Gounod’s “Mirella” Overture
will be the main item, but the Barcarolle
from “The Tales of Hoffmann” and a suite
from Carmen” will also get a Tiearing.
Dulcy,” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, provides
some limelit mischief for Constance Tal-
who nearly ruins her husband’s busi-
ness by her reckless tongue. In several
bright situations she shows that she is rather
a genius in the commission of faux pas. “The
Self-made Wife,” which follows on, is an
education in the curse of affluence—brought
about in this case by finding an oil-gusher in
the back yard. Francis X. Bushman, wdio
used to make flappers envy the victims of his
torrid embrace, has returned to the screen
of his former triumphs in “Modern Marriage”
at the Majestic. “Robin Hood, Junior,” at
the same house, jests with the reputation of
the famous outlaw, but its humor is rather
labored. Mae Murray, as a daring dancer,
sighs for new whirls to conquer in "The
French Doll,’’ at the Melba. The Britannia
has “The Romany” and Charlie Chaplin in
"Dough and Dynamite.” Charlie alone is
worth the money.
Ada Reeve, at Adelaide Royal, gives a
pleasant rendering of Aladdin. She is more
boyish and less dashing that the usual Prin-
cipal Boy, and strongly recalls Nellie Farren
of long ago. The dressing of the show is a
striking feature; so is the undressing. In
either case the leading ladies are nothin"
uncommon, but the men are funny. Tom
Payne and George Welch have the biggest
chances, but Hector St. Clair and Gus Bluett
get right hold of the audience when their
chance comes. Business is big. So it is at
the Prince of Wales, Shakspeare being now
taken as a feature in South Aus. educatiou.
Wilkie’s big chance comes with Hamlet and
Malvolio. Miss Hunter-Watts is scoring all
along the line, while the manager amuses
himself with such parts as Caliban, Jaaues
and Mercutio.

Colin Colahan goes to a show in Paris:—
I have just come home from the comprehensive
Claude Monet exposition. Old Monet! Forty, even
thirty, years ago rejected by the Salons, damned
by the critics, starving almost; now, at 85, possibly
the most renowned name in contemporary European
art. The father of “Impressionism,” the chief
revealer of all its possibilities, the Chief demonstrator
of all its imperfections! A tireless explorer in a
little sea into which he has dragged half the artists
of Europe!
An extremely interesting exhibition, showing the
growth from his earlier work, broad, simple, but
somewhat heavy and opaque, to the work where his
determination to open his eyes to nature untram-
melled by any scholastic formula finds him rendering
the disturbing glare of full sunlight right at the
topmost range of his keyboard, and with that broken,
disturbed technique (at first so admirably suited to
the subjects) which afterwards became with him an
obsession, blinding him to Nature just as effectively
as the scholastic traditions which he had rejected,
In such canvases as his “Orchard,” teeming with
light and with very real atmosphere, hot and
motionless, you feel an almost perfect harmony be*
tween the technique and the subject; and in a little
grey-green “Seascape” nothing could be more refresh-
ing than the salt-soaked atmosphere and the lively,
choppy movement of the sea. But then you come to
his “Cathedral” (borrowed for this exposition from
the Comondos Collection at the Louvre), and you
are worried and unconvinced by the obtrusive tech-
nique and the exaggerated color. Here you are no
longer looking at Nature; you are contemplating—
Monsieur Monet!
Finally it becomes with him almost a matter of
chance. You walk round the exhibition alternately
troubled by the obvious lack of sympathy and co-
erciveness of the technique and delighted with the
happy harmony of the manner and the subject. But
you finally weary of this game of chance, and you
long for the sincere work of Corot—Corot who
jumped clean out of his draper’s shop to the subtlest
“AMBROSE APPLE JOHN’S ADVEN-
TURE,” AT MELBOURNE HER
MAJESTY’S.
Lawrence Applejohn Grossmith and cabill-
boy Dorothy Seacombe. “Aces, all aces!
Blast ye!”
and most sympathetic appreciation of Nature; who
died just as his sensitive experiments in key were
promising the blaze and brilliance of sunlight as
never “Impressionist” has given us.
And after these years of hard foreign study, I still
declare that it remained for Meldrum, following the
same Nature-dictated methods, to fulfil this promise.


War Gratuity Redemption
and Conversion Loan
TO DIGGERS
WHO STILL HOLD THEIR
GRATUITY BONDS.
It will help the Commonwealth
considerably if you can see your
way clear to convert your bonds
into the New Loan.
The very attractive rate of interest
offered (6% free of State Income
Tax) provides you with an invest-
ment that will take a lot of beating.
The cash will be waiting for you on
May 31 st if you want it, but the
Treasury’s conversion proposition is
well worth your consideration.
A GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY
that might never
come agam
TO CITIZENS WHO CASHED
GRATUITY BONDS FOR
THE SOLDIERS.
Many of you cashed these bonds
at the time at considerable inconve-
nience to yourselves. To all of you
who helped the Diggers in this way,
the Commonwealth Government
confidently appeals to convert your
holdings into the New Loan.
The Government on their part
are offering an interest rate (6%
free of State Income Tax) which
should help you to come to a quick
decision to help them in connection
with their Loan Conversion opera-
tions.

TO ALL MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN WHO HAVE A
LITTLE CASH TO SPARE.
Honestly, can you imagine any
safer investment than a Common-
wealth Bond? It is the one security
that transcends all others. The in-
terest is paid every half-year just as
surely as the sun rises and sets.
Just think! You are offered 6%,
free of State Income Tax, and you
have the choice of taking up 3-year
bonds, 5-year bonds, or 10-year
bonds—whichever you like.

TO PARENTS
WHO WOULD LIKE TO PUT
ASIDE A NEST-EGG FOR
THEIR CHILDREN.
Here is a golden opportunity—
one that might never come again.
By taking up a ten-year £ 1 0 bond
and letting the interest accumulate,
it would be worth £l7/1/9 on
maturity. If ten years is too long,
try either a five-year or a three-year
bond. The 5-year bond would grow
into £l3/4/1 1, and the 3-year bond
into £l 1/17/8.
This is absolutely the best thing
you could possibly do for your
children.

“Caesar’s Ghost”: Tlie lions which ran
amok in Rome during the production of a
filfn version of “Quo Vadis” recalled a
lednine outbreak at Sydney Royal. In that
case, however, the savage beasts were supers.
A Iproduction of “The Sign of the Cross” had
“BUT HE WHO FILCHES FROM ME MY GOOD
FRAME ”

“Steal any of your pictures?”
“No, the coins —they took the frames.”
been prepared in a hurry. The supers., who
of all stage people require the most training,
had been imperfectly rehearsed, but it was
hoped that they would get through all right,
and they did tolerably well until the last act.
Then, as the doors leading to the amphitheatre
were about to be flung open, they forgot to
supply the roar which should have caused
nervous Christian martyrs to flinch. Appalled
at their silence, the s.m. threw liis hands
aloft as a signal that the roar w r as overdue.
Every well-trained super, knows w T hat hands
pointing heavenward mean ; and as the doors
swung open and disclosed the Christian mar-
tyrs tottering to their doom the lions burst
intd three hearty British cheers.
“Cartot”: According to figures issued by
the’ Bureau of Commerce, the U.S.A. in
1922 exported 126,746,952 feet of exposed
filfiis, and during the first 10 months of
1923 that record was beaten —142,000,000
Feet."’ Australia bought more of flie stuff
than any other country; even Britain,
hitherto regarded as Hollywood’s best cus-
tomer, purchased 5,000,000 feet less than
Australia in 1922. What a distinction for
a Commonwealth that boasts of its protec-
tive tariff (a transparent fraud, as far as
the film duties are concerned) and its
national spirit—-to be Hollywood's biggest
rubbish-tip!
“Binks” ; The realism of Seymour Hicks’s
restaurant scene in “The Man in Dress
Clothes,” at Melbourne King’s, is affected by
the fact that lie suspends, the animation of
his super.-diners every time lie starts a con-
versation with one of his other characters.
Thus Seymour’s long outburst of sentimen-
tality with liis wife at a front table turns
off the joie de vivre in other parts of the
restaurant; and we have the spectacle of
sundry gay people sitting in attitudes sug-
gesting thjat someone lias spilt the iced soup
down tliefr backs, whilst a commissionaire,
unaccountably placed inside the entrance,
stands as if suddenly turned into stone by
some happening (invisible to the audience)
outside. Then the waiters are cruelly in-
different to the mounting appetites which
they were previously bustling to gratify;
they only resume business when Hicks has
got his tale of chaste passion off liis chest.
The effect of the heavy silence is purely
theatrical and is only planned to concentrate
the eye and ear on a dull tete-d-tete which
might otherwise be overlooked.
“Chev”: Bransby Williams is coming to
Australia. A native of ’Ackney, he is best
known for his Dickens characterisations,
notably Sikes, Peggotty, Micawber and Mon-
tague Tigg; but he made his name in the
halls in imitations of Tree, Irving, Wynd-
liam, Harry Paulton and others more or less
famous. Also, he introduced the descriptive
monologues “Devil-may-care,” “The Stage-
doorkeeper” and “The Green Eye of the
little Yellow Gahd,” which have been done
in Australia by less eminent hands. Versa-
tility itself, Bransby Williams gives a one-
man show which occupies 2| hours, and
leaves his audience thirsting for more. He
plans to be here in .Tune.
“Chris”: In Wellington (M.L.) there is
a fiddle bearing the Stradivarius mark and
the date 1715; it belongs to Mrs. Lena
Ogilvic. whose father brought it from Scot-
land 60 years ago. He in turn had it from
his grand-dad. An expert who recently re-
paired the instrument declared it to be a
genuine Strad. If so it will be the third
known to have reached M.L.; the others are
owned by Archbishop Redwood, of Welling-
ton, and Henry Hayward, of Auckland.
"0.K.” : Asche is said to have invented a
wonderful portable cooker.' But why did
he do it? The vast artist looks as though
a period of abstention from cookers and all
their works Would do him a world of good.
“Peter Piper”: “Plasmon”
(B. 21/2/’24) is wrong in stat-
ing that Melba is to do Carmen
during her forthcoming opera
season. The lady has sung
Micliaela to the Carmen of
Calyebut that is the only
part in the Bizet opera which
she has portrayed. Her origi-
nal announcement was that she
wapld sing five parts during the
season; hut, as “Lohengrin”
lias been omitted from the pub-
lished list of operas to be staged,
she will now sing only Mimi,
Marguerite, Juliette and Desde-
mona. In America Melba
created the role of Brunnhilde.
in “Siegfried,” with Jean de
Reske in the name-part. That
notwithstanding, her reputation
as a Wagnerian singer has
never been exactly great; still,
everything the diva does dis-
plays some distinctive features,
and her Elsa would have had
individuality, at least.
“Cat”: Tell “Hamer” (B.
21/2/’24) that “Maori Jack”
Littlejohn, the Orange (N.S.W.)
bellman, denies (1) that he is
a Maori, and (2) that he “died
some years ago.” Jack is still
emptying buckets of paste at
Orange; and it is still danger-
ous to call him “Maori” to his face.
On some impending operas:—
“La Bohetne,” “Otello,” “Romeo and Juliet,”
“Butterfly,” “La Tosca,” “Samson and Delilah”
and “Tales of Hoffmann” were first shown in Aus-
tralia in the first dozen years of the present century.
“La Boheme” arrived in 190il; “Tales of Hoffmann”
in 1912. “Romeo and Juliet,” though composed about
the middle of last century, did not reach this coun-
try until Musgrove’s German combination staged it
in 1907. Of the older operas on Melba’s list “Lucia”
got a look in during the mid-’fifties, “Trovatore” in
1859 and “Rigoletto” in 1860. “Faust” made a
start in 1864, and has been played by every com-
pany since. The humorous “Barber” and “Don
Pasquale” appeared in 1868 and were followed in
1877 by “Aida,” then and ever since a good drawing
card for managers. “Carmen,” Lvster’s last opera-
tic novelty for these parts, was put on in 1879 ;
Rose Hersee, Beaumont and Verdi were in the prin-
cipal roles. There was a break of 14 years before
“Pagliacci” and “Cavalleria Rustieana” made
their appearance—not as a double bill, which is the
custom now, but staged separately, with a spectacular
ballet to fill up the evening. To the present gene-
ration of opera-lovers “Don Pasquale” will be a
new experience. It has been on the shelf for nearly
half a century.
“Hamer”: Diggers who have cheered
themselves with “It’s a Long Way to Tip-
perary” on route marches will have a
kindly thought for Henry James Williams,
just dead at Kenilworth (Eng.). The mail
who wrote the best, marching song the war
produced was a cripple from birth.
ALL BARRED AT PRESENT.
CRITIOAL SAINT : “Dear me, it’s not a bit like the
place!”
SAINT PETER: “No, I’m afraid if we want to get de-
cent pictures for the new music-room we shall
have to suspend the rules and admit a few
artists.”
From a London first-nighter:—
A report that Robey is to draw £750 a week it
the Hippodrome has aroused some comment. The
organiser of the Variety Artists’ Federation states that
George has been getting ■,£6QO si . week from Oswald
Stoll, and that, if the screw is raised to £750, which
he doubts, the rest of the show will suffer. The
V.A.F. man says that “the highest'pay for a comedian
to-day, apart from Robey, is £250 a week, and there
is only one man getting that.”
Australian girls Florence Austral, Beatrice Miranda
and Clara Serena are the stars of the National Opera
Co.’s latest venture at Covent Garden. Florence gave,
the season a splendid start by her rendering of the
title-role in “Aida.” The lI.T. praises her “superb
voice” aiid “superlatively good work.” Clara was
Alcestis in Boughton’s musical setting of the Greek
play-—lie has used Gilbert Murray’s version. The
Times says Clara’s “clear, full voice invested The
music with real interest,” and notes that her enuncia- -
tion was “delightfully distinct.” An uncommon tri-
bute, that.
Connie Ediss and Lee White are back in the'
music-hall business —Connie at the Victoria Palace,
the other at the Alhambra. The two Australian
girls wfio came to London with Lfce White haven’t
made their debut yet. “Can’t get a suitable theatre
for our show,”- says Clay Smith.
London, by the way, is very short of theatres. An
American producer is willing to pay £lOOO a week
for a suitable playhouse, but cannot find one. There
was once a proposal to establish an Australian theatre
in London. Nothing came of the idea, but in my
early years in London there was an approach to an
Australian theatre. The Grand, in Islington, was then
under the direction of Clarence Holt, Bland’s father,
who encouraged Australian plays and players for the
sake of old times. George Darrell, I remember, had
a season of his own plays at the Grand. At the time
of Holt’s death it was stated that he had almost com-
pleted the MS. of a book, mostly his Australian
reminiscences. I wonder if Bland has that manu
script; it has never seen type.
“Turridu”: A shipload of operatic stars,
loaded to the bursting-point with tempera-
ment, is now on the water headed for Aus-
tralia, and the Firm can only view its ap-
proach with trepidation. Never has such a
collection of highly-explosive Latins been
sent to the Commonwealth, and never will
there be a greater test of the diplomacy which
even their enemies recognise in the Taits.
The seeds of several first-class rows have
already been sown by the eleventh-hour Euro-
pean success of a soprano. If the lady gets
more encores here than another nightingale.
Hell will break loose. On the whole, I
feel sorry for the Firm. Even the enthusi-
ast who suggested the enterprise is begin-
ning to dread the responsibility of having a
vast bear-garden to manage for 20 weeks.
“S.T.S.” : A brisk bit of censorship can be
guessed in “Luxury,” a film now raging.
The heroine is held captive, and a minor vil-
lain is on guard outside. Left alone, he
looks thoughtfully at the key of the apart-
ment, and with evil winks and chuckles
enters. The heroine looks round in hor-
ror—and instantly he is out of the window.
Evidently there was a terrific struggle, end-
ing in her heaving him out. But the cen-
sors have reduced it to a piece of trick acro-
batics —in at the door and out of the window
in the same movement.
“Trevdee” : Why do our gentlemen of the
chorus always seem so glum? The girls
invariably look as if .they enjoyed their
work; but undertakers in a season of low
mortality couldn’t look more
crestfallen than the men. Male
choristers are permitted to sing
and dance and (occasionally, at
least) dress well, so why the
dickens can’t, they smile? Is
it because they’re not allowed
to wear tights?
“Norbell”: The president of
Melbourne Green-room Club is
appealing for funds to provide
a long holiday for Harry K.
Roberts, who has been seriously
ill in Sydney Hospital for
months. Roberts deserves well
of the theatre-going public. A
most versatile mummer, he has
played everything on the Aus-
tralian stage from pantomime
dame to Romeo, and most parts
he has played very well indeed.
He married Maggie Moore in
New York on April 12, 1902.
“Orb” : In explaining that he
has altered his conception of
the Senate scene in “Othello”
since he played it in Sydney,
Mr. Oscar Asche affirms (B.
28/2/’24) “it is merely a ques-
tion of what is best from a
stage-management point of
view, and I know I am the best
judge of that.” Exactly; but
Mr. Asche said precisely the
same thing of his Sydney pro-
duction. Hall Caine is quoted
as saying that “critics are
mostly failures wallowing in
the backwash of their own in-
competence.” Doubtless it
would be better for dramatic
art if all critics of the stage
were professional stage-man-
agers. On the same principle,
of course, none but a cook
should pass an opinion upon a dinner—
and only a liog,, I suppose, can really judge
per!?.
"Second Murderer” : Dramatic criticism is
a trade that demands a wide knowledge in
its followers. In the Argus's critique of
Seymour Hicks’s “The Man in Dress Clothes”
I read with much interest that Ellaline
Terriss asked for her freedom in a “toilette
that might be described as a symphony in
browns. Over a long underdress of copper-
colored satin beaute was a knee-length tunic
of heavy georgette in a pale cocoa color,
bordered with dark sable, and with three
bands of embroidery in tones of dull gold and
copper above the band of fur at the kero
of the tunic,” and so on for inches of type.
Doubtless other actresses might give a dif-
ferent reading of the part, but still that
confection must be pretty thrilling. Un-
happily no mention is made of Hicks’s dress
trousers.
“P. Polonius”:. “The Taming of the
Shrew’s” popularity wms seriously challenged
by a sequel a few years following the Bard’s
death. The piece was called “The Tamer
Tam’d” and showed Petruchio, after the
decease of Katherina, as the humble slave of
a second wife, who had pounded him into
obedience to her slightest whim. It seems
to have regaled Charles I. and the Court on
one occasion at the end of 1633. “The Tamer
Tam’d” was staged at St. James’ Palace two
nights after a performance of “The Shrew,”
and an ancient chronicler mentions that
whereas the Bard’s play was “likt” the other
was “very well likt.” The hero of the two
tales was then, by the way, spelt “Petrucio."
“Boston” : The Firm is not altogether to
blame for the vagaries of its recent theatrical
advertisements in Melbourne. In the case
of “Sally” a sudden leap in receipts after
the show’s removal elsewhere had been an-
nounced led to a temporary change of plan,
but the eccentric behavior of the King’s
Theatre advts. was due to a power over
which J.C.W. Ltd. has no control. It was
originally stated that “Iris” would follow
“Othello.” Then “The Taming of the
Shrew” was substituted for the Pinero
drama, and it was said that rehearsals were
well in hand for a handsome production of
the Shakspearean comedy, including the
Induction, which Asche presented on his last
visit. The fact that “Iris” is again leading
the field of approaching events wdiilst “The
Shrew” has dropped back among the also-
rans is reported to be the result of. Asche
changing his mind. There were certain diffi-
culties of casting that have now been over-
come by the release of Diana Wilson for
“Iris.”
THE CHARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Drummers are very successful with actresses.”—
The B. 21/2/’2i.
My drummer friend, though doubtless you have got
A snug enough position, you will never
Be Young Sam Hordern’s rival, and you’re not
Particularly clever:
The jade Celebrity ignores you,
Yet, strange as it may seem, the green-room girl
adores you.
It cannot be your skill with ball and bat
That charms her, or your bent for bridge and
snooker:
The lure of these is faint compared with that
Of bags and loads of lucre;
Nor can it be, my York-street Strongbow,
Your flair, displayed in trains, for drawing of the
longbow. •
To paint in words your mould and outline calls
For no recourse to anyone’s thesaurus;
Yet, seated in the circle or the stalls,
You agitate the chorus:
Tour homely form and banal features
Find favor in the sight of these enchanting creatures.
What is the magic, Dig., that you possess
For show-girls, with their anklets and their
bangles,
For coruscating coryphees, who.- dress
In wisps of. gauze and spangles-
Your spell in forming these connections,
Your open sesame to actresses’ affections?
They know, these nymphs, expensively embossed
(fNo need to call in oracles or sphinxes),
That, matched with you they’d get their goods “at
! cost”
The mercenary minxes !
This is the thought that draws, entices—-
That they could always buy their “things” at
“warehouse prices.”

Announcing
Traffic Transmission Gear
Introducing the greatest
Improvement since the self-starter
CHANDLER’S dominance of the fine six field is a
simple matter of facts.
It is the only car with the Traffic Transmission
—the only car in which all gear shifting troubles have
been absolutely and completely eliminated.
—the only car in which a positive, instantaneous, silent
speed change is always possible —even to the least
experienced driver.
—the only car in which the problem of clashing gears
has been overcome without the use of buttons, levers
or electrical appliances, and without changing the hand
and foot movements of previous practice.
It is the only car with the Pike’s Peak Motor.
No car, regardless of cost or class, offers a pound for pound value
comparable to this 1924 Chandler.
Verify this by getting behind the wheel. You can decide whether
that statement is too strong— or not strong enough !

What can be accomplished <with a

h
THE farmer who invests money in a Tractor naturally
wants to know what returns he is likely to get. The
result depends upon what it will accomplish—what
labour it will save —what work it will do —the efficiency of
that work and the cost of it. The experience of farmers who
have tested the CASE Tractor affords the most convincing
proof of its advantages. Note copy of letter herewith showing
what the CASE Tractor has actually accomplished and the
satisfaction it has given. The points enumerated prove con-
clusively that only the most efficient Tractor could have stood

OBJECTS.
Company is being formed for the following, among other purposes, viz.: To acquire and work
\Vv«,-, i d f lng o Lea i es «? f ? s - 507 > 508 ’ 509 ’ 510 and 511 • Parishes of Carahost and Bulalgee, County of
wjnjaid, New South Wales, comprising an area of 334 acres 2'Lfbods 3 perches.
~ , ac< iuire options over Mines and Tailings, to test, develop and work same, or to negotiate for
me sale and flotation of companies in connection therewith.
... I he Trustees for the Company at present hold a six months’ option of Tailings License No, 787 and
-Mineral Leases Nos. 7125 and 7126, Division of Bethanga, Mining District of Beechworth, in the State
o, .victoria, together with valuable plant, machinery and mining stores thereon, the purchase price asked
being £5OO cash and 500 fully-paid-up £1 shares.
, Gold Dredging Leases Nos. 507 to 511 are situated about ten miles south of Humula, and
about twenty miles from Tumbarumba, on Carabost Creek, which has never been known to be dry. These
Leases nave never previously been worked to any great extent owing to the strong opposition of local
pastoral interests, who have feared the sluicing operations would pollute the creek. These objections
, ? ? ow beeu satisfactorily overcome, and when it is remembered that in this locality enormously rich
de P° s . lts hav< ? been recovered, notably at the Old American Yards, it is apparent even to the lay mind
that gold m payable quantities must be won in these leases.
, copies of reports of Messrs. Onus, Green, and the late John Nute, which are incorporated herein,
show that the leases are extremely rich in gold, and that no natural obstacles exist which would
prevent the economic recovery of same.
. i s P r( >P ose d to erect a plant capable of treating 166,500 cubic yards per annum, which should
yield to the Company a net profit of £41,625 per annum, after making liberal allowances for the cost
of working and probable stoppages.
The area of these leases provides scope for years of profitable working, and should undoubtedly,
yield most gratifying results from the inception of operations.
Tbe Bethanga Mines and Tailings are . situated about 14 miles east of Wodonga, in Victoria, close
to the New South W ales border, and comprise 64 acres 3 roods 29 perches. These mines were worked
in the early days on a very large scale, but, owing to the refractory nature of the ore, they have been
closed for some years. The tailings consist of some 30,000 tons, which have been subjected to laboratory
tests by the late Mr. A. J. Onus (a metallurgist of world-wide experience, and a specialist ; in the
treatment of ores), who assures an extraction of 72.4 per cent, of the value, equal to 15s 9d. per ton net.
Mr. F. L. W'att, A.R.C.S., F.1.C., F.C.S., checked the samplings at Bethanga, and has verified tin-
value of the tailings.
In addition to the tailings which are lying ready for treatment, the Company has, as already stated,
an option over the Bethanga mine, which, from most authentic information, contains an almost
inexhaustible suply of high-grade ore. Samples of ore taken from a heap near the mouth of the tunnel
showed an average assay value of £4/3/3 per ton gold and 4/6 silver per ton, without taking into
consideration its copper and arsenic contents, which are very' valuable additions, and will very considerably
enhance the value of the ore.
The tailings are ready for treatment, properly stacked on the surface, and require only the expenditure
of £650 to commence treatment. The mine having been previously working on a large scale definitely
establishes the presence of ore in quantities sufficient for most lucrative operations when the tailings are
exhausted.
W hen the. value of the machinery at Bethanga is taken into conisderation, together with the fact
that most of it can be utilised in the working of the Carabost Leases, it will be readily seen that the
Company will, under this option, acquire plant and machinery which alone are worth more than the
price asked by the Vendor.
Reports and uopies ot Agreements may be inspected at the office of the Managing Director, 76 Pitt
Street, Sydney. The Company will pay the usual brokerage on all shares allotted.
A limited number of shares are available for distribution amongst the Public, and those interested
may obtain 1 copies of the Prospectus and all other information on application either personally or in
writing at the office of the Company.

BY DIRECTION OF
MR. A. J. JACKMAN,
WHO IS RETIRING.
The 18 Years’ Leasehold,
TOGETHER WITH THE LICENSE
AND COMPLETE FURNISHINGS
OF THE WELL-KNOWN
Pier Hotel, Glenelg,
ONE OF THE FINEST SEASIDE
RESIDENTIAL HOTELS IN
AUSTRALIA.
T H p OCCUPIES an UNSURPASSED
.7 POSITION on the FORESHORE at GLENELG
the leading and progressive Watering Place of South
Australia, and possesses many unique advantages for
the successful and profitable conduct of a reallv
first-class Seaside Residential Hotel. Among these
may be mentioned:—
(1) The Magnificent Situation, fronting one of the
finest Beaches in the world, offering unequalled
facilities for bathing, boating, riding, etc.
(2) The ease of communication with the City.
(Comfortable express trains, taking only about
15 minutes’ run right to the door of the Hotel,
and there is, in addition, a Motor ’Bus Service,
via the magnificent new concrete motor road.)
(3) The almost entire lack of competition.
The PIER HOTEL is of IMPOSING APPEARANCE,
3 storeys in height, with a wonderful expanse of
balcony, reminiscent of the promenade decks of the
most luxurious liner, and a flat roof (possessing
great possibilities for use as a Roof Garden), from
which a glorious panorama of the picturesque coast-
line and bay on the one side, and the plains, city,
and hills on the other is obtained.
The Hotel is designed on modern European lines,
and contains a magnificent Dining-room for over 100
guests, spacious lounges, ballroom, nublic, saloon
and house bars, guest-rooms for over 100 people,
numerous fine bathrooms and absolutely complete
kitchens, domestic offices and quarters. All modern
conveniences, including an electric lift, are installed.
The furniture and fittings throughout are hand-
some, in good taste, and well kept.
In the hands of the right man, possessing the
necessary experience in high-class hotel management,
this Hotel should prove a veritable gold-mine, as
it is firmly established and has a very considerable
following amongst the State’s leading pastoralists
and business men, many of whom are regular visitors
year after year. In addition to the Christmas and
various holiday periods (during which the Hotel’s
accommodation is taxed to its utmost), the Autumn
Polo Week has now become a regular fixture, bring-
ing an influx of well-known people.
There is also an excellent bar trade, and the possi-
bilities of profitably inaugurating “Dinner Dances”
and other such functions, which en.joy such popularity
at the leading Seaside Hostelries in the eastern
States and overseas, are unlimited and merely await
development.

The above is what Mr. T. G. Stewart, of

the Boulia Saddle we sold him 10 years
ago.
The “Boulia” is one of our high-grade stock saddles
with a dippy seat. The pads are set well up along the
rider’s thighs, giving the utmost protection for rough rid-
ing. The tree is our best “Fouright” and the fittings
included are folded girth, bevelled leathers and solid nickel

ago England was a good country to leave; there were
long hours, no entertainments, and small pay for
the worker. It is different to-day, and the healthy,
ambitious youth has a chance in England unrivalled
by that offering in any othe.r country.” What?—
with countless factories closed or working short time,
with a million and a half people on the dole, and
when a Government recently went to the country
pledged to subsidise farmers who would pay farm
laborers a living wage? E.G. (Grenfell): The

loose :
Leap-year very seldom comes,
As there is Four Years between the Time
When the Month of February has to run
From twenty-eight Days to twenty-nine.
The Lassy then can Court her lad,
Who she has often wished to speak
Of Marriage, that may make them glad,
When they a Home together can keep.
Life should Think, how they on each other
depend,
For their general Foods and Clothes;
And then to each other send
Kind thoughts, that Reason shows.
Life should learn to Live and let Live,
And thin’c of each other’s need ;
Then the Best of Friendship give,
That can keep each other from Greed.

rat gives us a gentle thrill:—-
When the aeroplane reached
A height from the ground.
The aviators were startled
By a gnawing sound.
When from their food
A rat did appear
Which realised danger
And trembled with fear.
From the edge of the ’plane,

With a squeak it leaped out
Into the misty air.

story has worked so hard that there are corns on even
its tenderest parts. .. .M.L.T.: Filthy.... J.8.W.: He

This Free Test
Will amaze and delight you
This offers you a io-day test, to show the
way to prettier teeth. To cleaner, safer
teeth. Millions now employ it. You see the
results in whiter teeth wherever you look
to-day. Now find out, for your own sake,
what that way means to you.
Film —the great enemy
Dingy teeth and most tooth troubles
come from film. From that viscous film you
feel. Soon that film discolors. Then it
forms dingy coats, and white teeth lose
their lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay.
Very few people who brush teeth in old
ways escape those film-caused troubles.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodcnt disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

The New-Day Dentifrice.
A scientific tooth paste based on modern
research, now advised by leading dentists
the world over. Two sizes.
Price: 2/- and 1/3
How to combat it
Dental science, after long research, has
found ways to fight that film. One acts to
disintegrate the film at all stages of forma-
tion. The other removes it without harm-
ful scouring. A new-type tooth paste has
been created to apply those methods daily.
The name is Pepsodent. Now leading den-
tists the world over advise it, and careful
people of some 50 nations enjoy its benefits.
A new dental era
In other ways Pepsodent is bringing a
new dental era. It multiplies the alkalinity
of the saliva and multiplies its starch
digestant.
When you know these results you will
want them daily, and want your family to
have them. Send the coupon for a io-Day
Tube. Note how clean the teeth feel after
using. Mark the absence of the viscous
film. See how teeth whiten as the film-
coats disappear.
You will be amazed and delighted at
what you see and feel. Cut out coupon
now. This is too important to forget.

Diseased, Plague-infested
insects are a positive
menace, and should be
ruthlessly destroyed by
using
Kruses
Insecticide
Insects of every species are“down
and out” the moment this mar-
vellous exterminator is applied.
Kruse’s Insecticide positively kills
Fleas, Ants, Bugs, Flies, Cock-
roaches, Mosquitoes, Moths, etc.;
yet is positively harmless in its
application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry,
etc., etc.
For the destruction of Aphis,
Woodlice, and other plant-attack-
ing insects, a light sprinkling of
Kruse’s Insecticide in still weather
is all that is necessary.
One tin, carefully used, lasts a
very long time.
Be careful you get the genuine Kruse's —
It never fails.

“Cheezo” : lie the centenary of St. James's,
Sydney. A grandchild of the first rector,
Richard Hill, lives at Goulburn. She is Mrs.
W. Wilson, and her mother was the late
Mrs. Cross, of Windsor, who died in 1900
at 84. Richard Hill used to journey to Van
Diemen’s Land occasionally to preach to the
convicts there.
“Huflin-Guttin”: F. P. Dodd, the butterfly
man, of Ivuranda (Q.), would be better
known if he were less shy. About 40 years
ago he added up figures in a bank in his
native town of Stawell (Vic.), what time
he wasn’t collecting butterflies, beetles,
spiders and things. Then he threw up the
bank job, and failing health took him to
N. Queensland. The remarkable butterfly
life of the semi-tropics has kept him there
ever since. New Guinea has also been
visited, with much advantage to his collec-
tion, which is among the best in the world.
Dodd’s brother Frank, a successful book-
seller and newsagent at Hamilton (Vic.),
claims to have sold the first volume out of
Cole’s Book Arcade, Melbourne, when it was
opened in 1883. He is a great admirer of
Fred, and thinks he would be a wonderful
man if there were no butterflies.
“R.N.8.”: The “honor” system, of which
so much is heard in connection with U.S.A.
prison reform, is now well established in
Maoriland. On all the reformatory farms,
as on road works, drainage contracts, bush-
whacking jobs and tree-planting camps
•where prisoners are employed, one may see
individuals and even parties of workers quite
beyond sight and hearing of any warders or
guards. You could search reformatories in
both North and South Islands and never find
a firearm. The tree-planting system, first
introduced near Rotorua many years ago,
proved that at least 75 per cent, of the aver-
age prison population can be trusted with
a certain amount of liberty. Gradually the
idea of prison camps, far removed from
cities, became the vogue, and to-day most
of M.L.’s offenders are domiciled in the bush,
living an open-air life, toiling like Trojans
and feeding like navvies. The result shows
only 7 per cent, of “returns.” Wages are
paid up to £1 2s. 6d. a week. The missus
can gather that amount from the Prisons
Department every Friday; in the absence of
a missus or other responsibilities the amount
is credited for withdrawal when a prisoner’s
term is up.
About Lord Loughborough’s father
The Earl of Rossiyn, mentioned in the cables
the other day as having paid his incorrigible heir’s
debts for the second or third time, has played more
parts than most peers. He began on the stage, where
he created a sensation in the ’nineties by getting a
part as “Mr. James Erskine,” in George Alexander’s
company, then producing Pinero’s “Trelawney of
the Wells.” After that he made a fleeting appear-
ance as a war correspondent in S. Africa, where he was
gathered in by the Boers at Sanna’s Post. Later he
conceived the idea of personally-conducted big-game
shooting expeditions, and for a time did good business
with Yankee millionaires and others. When that
palled he ranched in Canada, and after a spell of
company direction and flotation devised the great
seneme of his life, an infallible method of breaking
the bank at Monte Carlo. Hiram Maxim, the
inventor-mathematician, had no difficulty in proving
the system a dud, but he couldn’t prevent Rosslyn
from floating a company. After a preliminary
success, his system, of course, went the way of
all systems. Lord Loughborough, the son, married
an Australian girl, and was assisted out of these
parts a year or so back. He was doing staff
duty for a time in Cairo, but hasn’t dad’s energy
for anything but the accumulation of debts.
“Ivopai”: Breezy Cunningham, manager
for years of Burra station, near Tumba-
rumba (N.S.W.), had, in addition to a vast
knowledge of sheep and language, a sense
of humor. While still a station manager he
put money into a holding near Tumbarumba
and named it Willegobung. He didn’t —quite
the contrary, in fact. He next invested in
a better squattage, there to settle, and called
it Dunmoviu. He has not moved since. An-
other squattage in the same district was
Stonebroke, the slice of the huge Yarra Yarra
run which went to pioneer Jimmie
McLaurin’s son Gordon when the latter set
up housekeeping. Gordon became M.L.A.
for Hume, and when he built a new home-
stead he bestowed upon it the more euphoni-
ous Dalriada, meaning lieaven-knows-what.
Soon afterwards the old Stonebroke home-
stead changed hands, and the new owners
were quick to also change its too-suggestive
brand. Further out the most original name
was Bit Late, fixed to his holding by a man
who reckoned he could have done better if
he had arrived earlier.
Les Robinson’s fable of the Infanticide
and the Supercargo :
“I have come to the conclusion,” said the Infan-
ticide, gloomily, “that competition is now too keen
for me to continue to enjoy in this country that
luxury to which I have been accustomed ; for, despite
the baby bonus, the Minister for Motherhood and
night clinics, the demand for infants still exceeds
the supply, and the quality offering is, all too
frequently, disheartening to an enthusiast.”
“Let us emigrate, then,” said the Supercargo; “for
what with strikes, droughts', prohibition threats,
Bolshevism, chronic indigence, the prevalence of holes
in trousers, the film ■ censorship and the spread of
wowserism, life is becoming duller than it ever
ought to be. Genius is unrecognised. I cannot find
any cargo to super, and rainy nights in the park
unhinge one’s morale.”
Rushing to the wharf, they were only just in time.
The voyage was uneventful.
Such was the enthusiasm of the Infanticide, so
a«ute was the Supercargo’s thirst, that they could
scarcely restrain themselves long enough to allow
the steamer to be tied by the sailors to the first
port of call. No sooner had the gong been sounded
to inform the Customs officials that the hold was
full of contraband than, seizing his meataxe with
both hands, the Infanticide rushed through the turn-
stile and up the main street. Perceiving an un-
healthy infant mewking in the gutter, he was about
to disconnect a sirloin from it, when the Supercargo
—an inveterate sentimentalist—seized him by the
ear. Deftly and with consummate abandon, the Infan-
ticide, who had muscles like a dynamo, cleft the
interfering caretaker of cargo neatly in twain. It
i 3 said to have been from this cause that the rash
young man expired.
Whereupon, the police arrested the Infanticide and
laid a charge against him of obstructing the foot-
path with intent to commit a felony. He was able
to prove to the magistrate, however, that the Super-
cargo was only 18 years of age, and therefore an
infant in the eyes of the law. To atone fo.r their
blunder, and to show that no malice was intended,
the police presented the Infanticide with a cask of
rum.

ETER DAWSON is an old old whisky. It is matured to
delightful mellowness by the only true process, that of the
years and in wood. It is old, too, in the sense that its distilling
and blending express the skill and experience of successive
generations of Dawsons.
Whenever and wherever you get “P.D.” you can always be
sure you are getting genuinely old whisky of the kind which is
none too plentiful nowadays.

ON WITH THE
DANCE—At the
Duchess of Richmond's
hall at Brussells on the
eve of Waterloo, the
44 GREYS," handsome
and gracious, tripped to
the strains of the Valse —
latest new dance,
frowned upon by the
stiff dowagers and deans
as the invention of the
devil! I /
WE moderns are frowned on just as much when
we jazz and when one’s fair partner says:—
"Well, just one, but it must be a 'GREYS.’”
’Tis hard to dictate to a woman, but harder still to
refuse her the cigarette we men find most delicately
pleasing and comforting.

The School Boy says: •
“Hunger’s awful — can’t study
• — can’t pay attention. Feel
like clearing out and leaving
everything. But you bet 1
know how to treat Hunger!”
The schoolboy’s way is by the appetis-
ing nourishing sandwiches of REX HAM
PATE which await him at 11 a.m.
He likes the taste of them—you will,
too. They satisfy his ravenous appetite
because Rex Ham Pate makes his sand-
wiches most acceptable.
Rex Ham Pate is the sandwich spread
without a peer. It is all Rex Ham—with
the mildness and flavor retained. The
spicy piquancy appeals to young and old.
Order Rex Ham Pate—the cheapest
and best way of using Ham on sandwiches.

“L.E.L.”: I got the surprise of my life
when I read in a London weekly that
Australian artist George Lambert was born
at Petrograd of an American father and an
English mother. The invaluable ‘Johns
tells me that he is Washington as well as
George.
The “wisliing-pool” at the Jenolan
Caves (N.S.W.) had its annual clearing out
lately, and £351-odd was trawled from _ it.
The coins included 13,361 pennies, 10,100
thrippennies, and one golden half-sovereign
-—contributed by tourists for the benefit ot
the Bathurst and Litligow hospitals.
“Leg o’ Mutton”: “Bildad” (B. 17/1/24)
isn’t meticulously accurate about the Queens-
land Government’s 72 retail meatsliops.
There are only 71; the other is being run
by a former shopliand, who has bought the
goodwill. “Bildad,” however, is right about
the State meat business going to the* dogs.
I know many staunch supporters of 1 neo-
dor e who rarely patronise a State butcher-
shop now, the chief causes being bad beef
and haughty sliophands.
“Shed Hand”: Re pars, about casks of
liquor being tapped in transit over the rail-
way. Once I worked in a metropolitan
goods-shed, and, seeing a keg of wine con-
signed to a friend-of-the-family publican
away in the Never-Never, I conceived the
idea of sending him a greeting on the label.
“Good luck, Bill,” I wrote, and signed my
name. When next I saw him, a year later, it
took a solid hour’s talk to convince him that
my shed cobbers and I had not polished off
the port. He had received my message,
coupled with various fraternal additions
from all alone the line, and an empty keg.
“Adelaide” : The States which haven’t the
advantage of having Commonwealth depart-
ments handy are very mad at a recent pro-
clamation forbidding the export of any ani-
mals or skins, other than domestic, “without
the approval of the Minister.” Cabled orders
for rabbit- or fox-skins often stipulate for
prompt despatch. The new rule means that
one has to go to the Customs, and they have
to communicate with Melbourne, and. the
outgoing ship may easily be lost. South
Aus. thinks it does all it can to protect the
native fauna, and that the Commonwealth
will take longer over the job and do it less
reliably. Anyivay, the skins of beasts that
are pests might have been excepted.
“Ngatik” : “Cartot” (B. 3/l/’24) can rest
assured that the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
were never very near the Australian coast.
Even before Britain had declared war they
were on the way to Ponape, the German
naval depot in the Eastern Caroline Islands.
It was there that the ships were prepared
for the proposed commerce raiding. Pianos,
ice-chests, tables, chairs —in fact, everything
that could be done without—went ashore;
most' of the boats were also put overboard.
I was there on Government business in Jan.,
1916, and saw the huge quantity of discarded
material in large sheds. Silverman, manager
of the Jaluit trading company (whom the
Japs allowed to remain), said the squadron
was there for several weeks. They were
never nearer Sydney than Rabaul.
A countryman looks at the bakers’ strike:
Sydney must be a rich place if the people can
afford night baking. The masters have agreed to
increase their wages bills for the right to deliver
hot bread, but this also carries with it the right
to deliver less bread in weight for the money.
The difference in the weight of the loaf concerns
evaporation. The loaf must weigh a full 21b. up
to the time it leaves the baker’s premises, but the
question for the public is whether the weight lost
in evaporation shall be lost by them or by the
master baker. If night baking again becomes
general, then the public be made to lose the
ounces, for the bread will be delivered hot, and
evaporation takes place when the bread is the
property of the purchaser. With day baking and
the delivery of bread cold, evaporation has already
taken place before the bread leaves the bakers’
premises. This loss in evaporation varies, but runs
about an ounce for every 21b. loaf, so that on
even a moderate turnover it represents a good
many bags of flour in 12 months.
“Te Pana” : Seventy years ago 30 million
acres of Maoriland were under wood: to-day
no more than a tenth of that area is grow-
ing trees. If destruction continued at the
present rate Maoriland would be bald of
native bush by 1950. The Forestry Depart-
ment is trying to promote conservation and
replanting; the Prisons Department is lend-
ing a helping hand, and is responsible for
vegetating thousands of acres of pumice «oun-
try between Rotorua and Taupo. Austra-
lian quick-growing eucalypts have been
favored in the re-afforestation scheme. 27
varieties having become acclimatised. The
slow-growing kauri is reckoned out of the
question. The position in the South Island
is not quite so bad, even though cockies have
applied the firestick freely. Tremendous
aeech forests are still a feature of the land-
scape in the far south-western district where
broken country prevails. But, gradually,
this timber is being utilised for axe, pick
and shovel handles, and fussy little sawmills
are doing their deadly work. Stewart Island
is about the only territory in Maoriland
which has withstood the inroads of fire and
axe.
“Centurion”: Mention of Morrisey, “the
snake man” (B. 14/2/’24), recalls a sinister
experience of my own with one of the tribe.
It was in the private bar of a King-street
(Sydney) hotel, many a long year ago. Avery
charming barmaid was ministering to our
wants, and, like all the girls of her day, she
was wearing a “shirt blouse” with a stand-up
collar and long necktie. A raffish-looking
gentleman came in and established himself
on the outskirts of the giddy throng. He
had a bag in one hand, and under his arm
was one of those long, narrow, glass-topped
boxes in which haberdashers keep neckties
folded side by side in separate compartments.
Hebe had just remarked that she wanted a
new necktie. Taking the new arrival, who
had his back turned, for a hawker, the
writer pulled the necktie-box from under his
arm, and, handing it to the fair one, invited
her to make her choice. She accepted
the box graciously, gazed through the glass
for a moment, dropped it with a blood-
curdling screech and immediately got jambed
in the exit doorway with two other ladies
who had gathered to admire the ties. When
the shouting and the tumult died, I dis-
covered that the box contained two live
snakes, neatly packed in the space for neck-
ties. I often pass that hotel nowadays, but
have never set foot in it since.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the belfry, high as Spring,
Little bells begin to ring
As the bowls of airy glass
Tip the wind and let it pass;
And a hoop of dusky moon
Into twilight seems to swoon.
Take your hat and grip your staff.
There are roads for those who laugh
When the sap is at the turn
And the restless longings burn
In the heart and in the feet.
In the valley we shall meet
What was never on the hill;
Shall the cap and bells be still
While the mountain makes a sally
Of green mirth the hollow valley
Cannot know for all the shouting
Of the silver waters sprouting
From the ledges green with fern?
Wear your shoes away and learn
Of the pathways brown and far
That the spinning of a spider
May be loftier and wider
Than the shining of a star.
Here a giant, old and stiff,
Leans his elbow on a cliff
High above the waterfall.
He will answer if you call.
Where a great-paunehed gum-tree stands
Showering shadow grey and crol
Make a trumpet of your hands
Call him “Fool, fool, fool !”
And across the steep and hollow
Will a rounded echo sing
Through the heart of all the Spring;
With a happy “Follow, follow!”
Shall the dappled woodland ring.
Follow folly and be wise!
All the glory of the year
Burns again in comrade skies.
O’er the hill across the stream
Is another sweeter dream,
Part of the long wandering plan
Of the enterprise called Man.

[For The Bulletin.]
SPHERE was an instant hush as she
entered the dining-hall, and as she
took her place alone at a retired table
Cartliew and I recalled all we had heard of
the Princess Xenopliistiba, who since the
revolution had lived in Paris or Madrid or
Rome. She was the most desired woman in
Europe. The lure that drew her countless
lovers was not only that of beauty, sex,
wealth and youth, but the attraction of an
elusive personality and the charm of a
character free from the affectations of con-
ventional morality and full of the wayward
happiness and unconcern that must charac-
terise young angels. Life to her was an
instrument of gaiety, pleasure and intrigue.
After dinner Cartliew left me, and, taking
a stick, a light cloak and a revolver, for the
moonlit evening was chilly, I left the hotel.
Rome has fascinated me always, and especi-
ally by night. I gave little heed to my direc-
tion or to the passage of time, but I imagine
it must have been after 11 o’clock when I
entered the narrow passage which led to the
adventure. Suddenly out of the darkness
came the clatter of hurrying feet and the
sound of a pistol shot.
I thought for a moment I had chanced on
a! brawl begun in some wineshop of the
quarter, and stood back in a convenient door-
way to let the clamor sweep by. As I did
so a woman in a long cloak came running
swiftly round a corner some thirty yards
away, followed by five or six men who were
rapidly gaining on her. As she neared me
she staggered and almost fell. The cloak
slipped open and I saw that she was in
evening dress, and jewels shone on her white
shoulders. Instantly I stepped between her
and the foremost ruffian, who fired as lie saw
me.
“Quickly !” I cried. “Into the doorway!”
I raised my revolver and shot him through
the forehead. As he sprawled to the ground
in a grotesque heap the others were upon me.
One made a dive for my legs and two leaped
at my arms, whilst the fourth crouched and
circled in a nervous dance, awaiting the
opportunity to dart in and use the gleaming
stiletto in his right hand. I had no time to
notice more, although I fancied I saw a
shape standing against the opposite wall
watching intently.
I kicked the first of them in the face, and
he cursed thickly as he struck the ground.
A few teeth rattled on the cobblestones. The
fellow on my right missed my arm, and
yelled with pain, as my fist crashed to his
chin and felled him. I tossed my revolver
to the woman, who caught it deftly. The
third attacker had me by the left arm, but
I whirled him round, got him securely by
the middle and swung him squirming into
the air. As I did so the man in the shadow
whistled shrilly and three others came round
the turn.
“Run for your life!” I cried. “I will hold
them,” and sent my man spinning to level
his friend of the knife to the ground. But
the woman did not stir. Then began hot
work. My coat was slashed in several places
by knife thrusts, and a blow from the butt
-f a revolver cut my cheek and drenched my
shirt-front in blood. But I manoeuvred to
prevent them passing to attack me in the
rear, and dealt shrewd knocks when I could.
I caught one man behind the ear and sent
him reeling. His head struck the pavement
with a crack and he lay still. But in hitting
him I tripped over one of the prostrate men
and dropped to my knees. The two rained
blows on me with their heavy guns. As I
raised my arms above my head to protect
myself, I felt a stinging sensation in my left
wrist, which wrung from me an involuntary
cry, and the arm dropped, numbed and
powerless.
As I fell the man in the shadows spoke
m the French of the salons, but with an
accent which betrayed him as a Russian:
“Give me the package, Vera; the fool of
an Englishman is finished.”
The woman in the doorway laughed mock-
ingly. "Never, Stephauovitch, my Bol-
shevik renegade,” she said—“never; you
must come and take it.”
The man stepped from the shadows with a
growl of anger, and as the moonlight fell on
him I saw that he had no arms!
The sound of voices had caused my adver-
saries to pause momentarily, and, lunging
forward, I took one in the stomach with my
head and winded him. Before his com-
panion could turn completely I had regained
my feet and accounted for him too.
The armless man had disappeared!
The woman's hand touched my sleeve and
she spoke in soft concern.
“You are badly hurt, monsieur?”
“It is nothing,” I replied, and looked into
the face of the Princess Xenopliistiba!
“Ma foi! What a man !” she exclaimed ;
and went on: “My friend, you have done
your country and Europe a great service to-
night. You have helped me to rescue papers
the most precious from the agents of Lenin.
You are a brave man!”
“Your thanks are more than sufficient
reward, Princess,” I smiled. “May I see
you safely to your hotel?”
“If you will,” she assented graciously, as
I bent to kiss the fingers she laid in mine.
The drawing-room of the old chateau, the
headquarters of the General Staff, is hung
with maps, and maps are scattered on the
tables and lie in heaps on the floor. The
mellow sunlight of late afternoon revives the
colors of the faded carpet that lias been tar-
nished by so many feet. I light a cigarette
with a hand that trembles ever so slightly;
but I puff it slowly and without any appa-
rent sign of fatigue, although during the past
forty-eight hours I have not left my desk....
perfecting the details of the great offensive
that will be launched at midnight.
I smile as my thoughts turn to Alice, Lady
Bingo, who has promised to be mine if I
succeed. Our marriage in the great grey
cathedral of the capital will be the fitting
crown of my triumphal return at the head
of my victorious troops.
And, indeed, my career has been incred-
ible.
When I joined the army as a private, three
years ago. I had been assistant to the driver
of a baker’s cart; but my capacity for
leadership soon asserted itself, and in a
month I became a sergeant. In my first
engagement I took command of the regi-
ment when all the officers were killed or
wounded, rescued the general from the enemy
and transformed an ignominious defeat into
a brilliant victory. For this feat I was
awarded the Victoria Cross and a captaincy,
and a month later was promoted to the rank
of colonel in recognition of my treatise on
the use of insecticide in warfare. When the
general died he bequeathed me his rank and
the battalion, and it was not long before I
made myself heard in the Councils of the
Higher Command. , So much so that after
the series of reverses that struck terror into
all hearts but mine, a unanimous round-
robin from the General Staff implored me to
accept the office of Oommander-in-Chief. In
six months I have restored our lost prestige
and regained the ascendancy in the field.
To-morrow my task will be completed.
My cigarette finished, I rise and pass
slowly from the room. My staff bow re-
spectfully and follow me with worshipping
eyes....
* * * *
When I rose to address the jury on be-
half of the beautiful woman who stood in
the dock charged with the murder of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, no one, I am
sure, thought there was the slightest chance
of acquittal. The Crown had woven such
a net of circumstantial evidence around her
that her escape seemed impossible. Popular
feeling had made her the heroine of the
hour. Day after day the court was thronged
to bursting-point, and vast crowds waited
outside.
She denied her guilt. Her story was
simple. While she was remonstrating with
the Archbishop for stealing her chewing-
gum, she declared, a masked man had
entered the throne-room silently, and, before
either could ask his business, had drawn a
hatpin from her hat. stabbed the Archbishop
to the heart and disappeared. But this story
was totally opposed to the facts that the
Crown had established—that the door was
locked on the inside and the key found in the
Archbishop’s pocket; that the windows were
barred in such a way that no one could enter
or leave by that means; that two curates
were constantly on guard in the corridor:
and that she was the Archbishop's only visi-
tor that day.
Things certainly looked black as I rose to
follow Bullsbile, K.C., who had denounced
her in a speech of four hours' duration. But
I was not afraid of this terrible giant of the
profession, although I was but a new mem-
ber of the junior Bar and this was my first
important brief.
There was a stir as I bowed to his Honor
and invoked the attention of the jury with
a wave of the hand. I caught more than
one feminine whisper. Tall, dark, handsome
and distinguished, with all the marks of
race and breeding, there is no doubt I was
a striking figure in my wig and robes, and
the dingy atmosphere of the dark courtroom
heightened the effect of my commanding per-
sonality.
I began very quietly, but gradually I
allowed my natural gifts of oratory and per-
suasion to have expression, until the whole
Court leant forward breathlessly. For three
hours I spoke. Women fainted and were
carried from the court, but their places were
soon filled. Strong men broke down and
cried, and even Bullsbile wiped a surrep-
titious tear from his eye with his famous
yellow handkerchief. At length the Judge,
who is held to be the sternest man on the
bench, interrupted me. “Mr. Miffsmith,” he
said, his voice broken with emotion and his
strong face working, “I—l —cannot s-stand
any more of this at present. I —I —m-must
adjourn the Court for a few minutes.”
As he left the bench the Court broke into
a tumult of applause which the attendants
were unable to quell, or Bullsbile to frown
down. Bowing gracefully in acknowledg-
ment, I crossed to the dock to speak a few
words of encouragement to my fair client.
Her glorious eyes were misty with tears as
she bent to thank me.

Are You as Wei I as
You Should Be?
It isn’t right for one to always feel tired, weak —all worn
out. Yet how many folks are constantly ailing, though
seldom sick enough to be in bed! Are you one of these
unfortunates? Do you suffer daily backaches —feel dull
and weary—nervous and dispirited? Is your health
slowly slipping away? It’s time, then, you were finding
the cause. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold, strain
or overwork has slowed up your kidneys and brought on
that dull, dragging ache —that soreness, stiffness, lassitude and weariness. You may have headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying kidpey irregularities, too. Don’t wait for serious kidney trouble, but help
the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor!
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, says: “As the result of an attack of influenza a
member of my family suffered terribly from kidney
trouble. The symptoms were various, the most trouble-
some being pains across the small of the back. This
ailment was very trying, especially so as every move-
ment seemed to'make the suffering more acute. No
position was comfortable, the ache keeping up practically
night and day. One day we were advised to try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills,' and they proved a blessing, six
bottles driving the pain out of the back and restoring the
kidneys to a healthy state. Doan’s Pills are a marvel-
lous kidney remedy, and I am sure sufferers from back-
ache cannot do better than take them. I consider they are
a boon to humanity, and I am never without a bottle in
the house.”
Two years later Mr, Francis says : “The cure referred
to still holds good, no signs of kidney trouble having
returned, a fact that Droves Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills give lasting benefit.”
TWO SYDNEY
PEOPLE
CURED OF
BACKACHE
AND KIDNEY
TROUBLE.
A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. W. P. Ritzau, 364 King Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says : “For years I was a great sufferer from
kidney disease. I have been treated by doctors and in
hospitals, and tortured with operations. After fifteen
months in one hospital I came out a thorough cripple;
I was so ill I was advised to go back into the hospital,
but my husband would not let me go. I was recommended
by a friend to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pius, and
commenced using them, carefully following the directions.
These pills have cured me. I can now get about and
do my work, and the pain has completely left me. My
cure is wonderful, for mine was really a very bad case.
Since my cure my uncle has used the remedy and they
have effected a complete cure in his case also. Our
experiences prove that Doan’s Backache Kidney 1 ills are
a positive cure for kidney trouble.’’
Eight years later Mrs. Ritzau says: I have still
the same good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
When I feel a slight return of my old complaint I take
them, and they never fail to put me right.

The excited hum of talk died down as the
Judge re-entered and I resumed my address
with a new confidence begotten of her faitn
and trust. If I was eloquent before, I was
doubly so now. Words flowed from me in
a never-ending stream. Hours and hours
went by and I was still speaking. It would be
impossible to describe adequately the effect on
those who listened to me. Low moans and
stifled cries from the spectators and sighs
and groans from the jury showed how I
touched them. The Judge’s head was buried
in his arms and his shoulders shook as they
might m weeping or in sleep. Bullsbile, in
an excess of jealousy and mortification, had
filled his ears with cotton-wool.
At last I paused for my peroration.
“And now,” I began—but the foreman of
the jury sprang to his feet.
“We have heard enough,” he shouted,
“The girl is free,” and he fell back uncon-
scious.
As one man, the remainder of the jury
took up his cry. “We have heard enough,”
they yelled. “Let the girl free!”
“I agree with you, gentlemen,” said the
Judge. “We have heard enough,” and, hand-
ing the black cap back to his associate, he
turned to the prisoner. “You may go.”
An instant cheer spread quickly to the
multitude outside, and a roar went up that
shook the city.

In a pleasant valley folded in the hills,
some 20 miles from Hollywood, is the pala-
tial million-dollar residence where Clarence
Dumaresq rests in the intervals of making
the pictures that have given a new direction
to the art of the screen. Here our inter-
viewer was received by Mr. Dumaresq in his
delightful music-hall, a replica of the famous
room in the Fanminista Palace in Venice,
where Mr. Dumaresq has spent several holi-
days swimming in the canals. He was attired
in a simple neglige gown of old-gold and rose
(presented to him by the Emperor of Mo-
rocco), and was transposing Bach’s “Con-
certo tor Two Violins” on a jewelled ocker-
iiia, for lie is an accomplished musician,
and regards music as an inseparable ally of
the silver sheet m the promotion of Culture,
When it is realised that Dumaresq is a
finer horseman than Bill Hart, a better aero-
bat than Douglas Fairbanks, a greater com-
edian than Charlie Chaplin, and stands far
above any of the excellent actors of the day,
tile value of Ins views on Art is apparent.
He has appeared in 59 master-pictures
written and produced by himself, for he
rinds it impossible to secure scenarios ot
sufficient merit from others. A spacious gal-
lory has been erected as an annexe to the
residence to accommodate his paintings in
oils and water-colors, considered by Sir Wil-
liam Orpen as equal to his own, and his
latest book, “The Direction and Dissection
of Ancient and Modern Philosophy, from
» t „
I Into to Castncklo, has been Clowned by
tile I rencll Academy.
“Yes,” he said, throwing himself with
easy grace on to a rare couch, formerly the
favorite haunt of Lucretia Borgia, “after
,1 ~ i a T . v
the influence of pure womanhood, I regard
the screen as the greatest power for good m
the world to-day”....
My private suite of offices is on the 30th
floor of the most ornate of the 20 sky-
scrapers of steel and glass that make up
“Smith’s Stores,” the most stupendous re-
pository of necessities and luxuries in the
universe. My desk is set in the centre of
a spacious chamber furnished in the extreme
of expensive simplicity. Artists who in
other days would have served popes and
emperors have found no task more fitting
to their talents than the creation of a setting
for my genius.
Leaning back in my chair I savor the
erotic excellence of Prebant’s four etchings,
his life’s work. He died at 24, worn out
by the excesses of perverse art that are more
terrible than the seven deadly sins. After
his death the plates were destroyed so that
I might have the unique joy of the possession
of these etchings. As I look at them I
think of Alexander, Napoleon, Hannibal,
Tamburlane, Csesar —all those great fore-
runners who lusted and travailed for power
and dominion. At the heads of armies, in
privation and in despair, they sought for the
glories and possessions that I have gained
by other means.
In 15 years I have mastered and tamed
the resources of civilisation, and now at 35
I am the sole proprietor of the most astound-
ing organisation that has ever been. Here
50,000 salespeople distribute to eager patrons
the treasures and marvels of the earth, to
produce which 14 million people toil in my
service. I am sole agent for all the Gov-
ernments of the world. Sometimes, through
the night, I watch the air-vessels, which fill
the sky with the glitter of countless new and
brighter stars, bringing their passengers from
Thibet, the Sahara, the Andes, from Paris
and from the quiet of forgotten villages in
the English hills. Persia is mine, for I have
purchased it so that I may be sure of an
adequate supply of rugs. The Antarctic has
been converted into an immense sheep-run,
whence comes my wool, and in the streets of
what was once New York the cattle grazing
on the deserted sidewalks are destined by my
agency to feed the millions of China. Three-
fourths of the population of the globe clean
their teeth each morning with my tooth-
nastes, and the superseded Ford plants have
been converted into storage depots for the
safety-razors, vacuum-cleaners, harvesters
and railway-engines that my inventions have
made unnecessary.
I turn idly as an obsequious attendant en-
ters and places the radiophone to my hand.
“The British Prime Minister, sir, desires
the favor of your advice on a matter of im-
portance.”
Languidly I lift the receiver.

(From the Evening Raal)
At the Central Police Court yesterday Henry
Plicket, 29, was sentenced to three months’ hard
labor as an idle, disorderly person without visible
means of support. Sergeant Feete said he was well
known to the police, and had never worked. He was
too listless to steal. He slept in the Domain, and
obtained his food from the garbage-tins of restaurants
and big hotels. When arrested on Friday last he
was half-clothed and in a filthy and verminous state.
Past efforts to reclaim him had failed, and he had
thrown up good situations that had been found for
him to return to a life of vagabondage. A spell in
gaol would ensure his cleanliness, at least.
The prisoner complained that the police had taken
some valuable manuscripts from him, and asked that
thev be kept in a place of safety.
Mr. Banton, S.M., said that Plicket was one of
the most worthless fellows that had ever appeared
before him.
J. J. SHEILS.
Andy's Jimmy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MM HERE was a tradition that no tra-
■ veller must be allowed to pass the
-B_ place without first being invited in
for a meal and a cup of tea. Even a black-
fellow always had his bag filled. When, twice
a week, the coach reached the place, all the
travellers were passed in to a well-spread
table. Everybody for miles on botli sides
of the border of Victoria and New South
Wales knew Nyora station. In the days of
motor-cars the custom could not be kept up ;
but Andy Campbell, the latest owner, main-
tained the tradition as well as lie could, and
when anybody called he lit the fire and boiled'
the billy.
Andy was a bachelor. He had lived for
years by himself; and as he was well-to-do
people wondered why he never married. But
Andy took no interest in women. “I never
notice them,” he used to say. All liis love
was for bullocks. Bullocks were his life.
When people were talking about the early
days and recalling memories of some old set-
ler, Andy would shake his head and say: "I
don’t remember him very well. If he had
been a bullock, now”
Nyora, which had been taken up in the
’sixties, had developed from a selection into
a station. It Avas a great centre for the
mustering of cattle. Andy had leases over
a lot of back country, and his cattle ranged
the hills from beyond Nadgee to Cape Ilowe.
He knew cattle better than he knew people.
A big mob might be brought in, and Andy
could pick out his own beasts, even if he
hadn’t seen them for a year. “If I brought:
a beast up till it was two years old I think
I could always tell it.” he said.
Andy hung an old black billy on a hook
and threw some branches into the big, open
fireplace. As he knelt before the fire he
turned round with a smile, and said to his
visitor, a trapper from the Victorian side
who had just dropped in: “I got him back.”
Andy seemed pleased with himself that
afternoon.
There had been a cattle' muster on Billy
Hunt’s station, 60 miles away, an exciting
event in the district. Cattle had been
rounded up all over the bush and the hills
and deep gulligs of the lonely Howe range.
Some of them had been running wild for
years. Old Billy Hunt had cut out a week
ago, and now he was drhdng his fine mob
from near the border to Bairnsdale.
When they had passed Timboon Billy felt
that the worst was over. Of course, wild
cattle always wanted watching, and the drov-
ers just snatched a few hours when they
could ; but with fair luck Billy thought they
should get them through now.
That afternoon, when the drovers had
fixed their camp and were boiling the billy,
who should ride up but Andy Campbell!
‘‘Hallo, Andy!” cried Billy in surprise,
“where did you spring from?”
“I just wanted ro see you a minute,” said
Andy in his soft, quiet voice. “How are you
getting on?”
“Not too bad.”
“Lost any?”
“One or two broke away, and we let ’em
go. That’s all.”
“You’ve'got some fat beasts there,” said
Andy, as he had a good look at the mob.
"I can’t complain,” said Billy. “Get off
your horse and have a drink of tea.”
“Wait a minute,” exclaimed Andy. “Look
at that beast there—that big red bullock
with the long horns. That’s Jimmy.”
“Jimmy!”
“Yes. That’s my Jimmy all right.”
Billy Hunt looked angry. “What are you
talking about, Andy?”
“I know what I’m talking about. That’s
my Jimmy right enough.”
“How do you know?”
“I’d know his head anywhere.”
Billy got on his horse and went round the
mob with Andy.
“There’s the brand. It’s a bit blurred;
but it’s not the brand I’m going so much on
—it’s his head. How did you get him among
your mob?”
Billy shook his head. “I don’t know. It’s
easy to make a mistake sometimes.” Billy’s
little mistakes were well known.
“I had .Timmy with me for three years,’’
Andy explained. “I put him out in the busk
about a year ago. I could pick out Jimmy
from a thousand.”
Andy then gave a full account of Jimmy’s
points, habits and pedigree. There was no
doubt the beast was Jimmy.
Billy Hunt gave in before he had finished.
“I suppose you’re right, Andy. I don’t know
how he got into the mob.”
“It’s all right,” said Andy. “But 1
wouldn’t like to lose Jimmy.”
“Will I take him along for you with the
mob?” Billy asked.
“Don’t bother,” said Andy. “I’ll drive
him back myself.”
Andy got off his horse and had a drink of
tea. When he rode off with his Jimmy, Billy
Hunt cursed Softly to himself. “How the
devil,” he wondered, “did he find out about
that damned bullock!”
•** * *
“Well,” said Andy, as he filled the tea-
pot again, “it’s a funny thing liow I found
out about that bullock. I’ll show you some-
thing.”
He wont over to a corner, and from a lot
of junk took out a copy of a country
paper. “Billy’s muster was the biggest
they’d had round here for a long time, though
I think I’ll beat it with my lot next year.
And Billy was very proud of it. He had a
photograph taken, and it was printed in the
paper.”
It was a good snapshot of a mob of cattle
ready for the road.
“That’s Jimmy there,” said Andy, point-
ing out a bullock among the mob. “That’s
how I found out where he was. I knew
him from his photograph. I could tell that
head anywhere.”
