CSC
The Australian Play Competition
The Red Page
Some 30 one-act plays were submitted for
this competition, but none of outstanding
dramatic quality. The chief faults disclosed
were: the excessive use of soliloquy, a con-
ventional plot, long-windedness of dialogue,
and speech that was literary rather than
natural. But the art of the drama has been
but newly born here, and the competition
has proved that, with proper nourishment,
the infant will survive and grow to a fine
manhood.
Evidence of the newness of the task im-
posed was found in the fact that many of
the one-act plays submitted had two or more
scenes —'‘Diamond Cut Diamond” had a tre-
mendous cast and six scenes. The essence
of the one-acter, as contrasted with the play,
is that the scene must not change. If the
dramatist cannot tell his story without
shifting the stage-fittings, he has failed. Like
the short story the one-act play must have
no interval in its action: it must embody
one idea and present that idea in the brief-
est possible compass.
&
Let us dismiss some of the failures.
“De Profundis” is a riot of soliloquy.
Each character in turn nervously waits till
the other characters get off the stage in order
to unburden his or her soul to the furniture.
In the midst of his long speech to the atmo-
sphere one character naively asks the car-
pet, “But why soliloquise?” and, as the
carpet maintains a stubborn silence, goes on
cheerfully. soliloquising. “The Girl from
Boggabri,” a poor farce, opens with Sarah
Jane dusting the furniture and telling the
couch large chunks of family history. Mr.
Soliloquy is also the chief character in
“Love's Progress.” This play hat. an impos-
sible poet, and the commonplace dialogue
has not the faintest semblance of dramatic
interest. There is a tiny surprise in the
climax, but for it the audience would not
have waited. “The Marquis,” a foolish
farce* begins,' too, with the time-honored
chat between a girl and the chairs. “The
Black Bag,” a quite conventional comedy, is
bespattered with “asides.”
The opening of “He Did It” arouses the
audiences’s interest. “An ugly affair!” one
character remarks; but the affair turns out
to be a tame plot developed by long-winded
dialogue, xllso in the ranks of the conven-
tional melodramatic plot, unlit by any dra-
matic interest, is “The Elder Son.” “The
Breakaway” has not even a plot; it is
merely an uninteresting conversation about
a youth who wants to leave home. “The
Old Trail” is a literary thing that is neither
realistic nor dramatic, disfigured by the in-
troduction of characters who do not contri-
bute either to the atmosphere or to the
action. In a one-act play there must be no
character introduced upon whom some part
of the.plot does not pivot.
So much for the kindergarten class. “The
Defender” is a patriotic play. In his intro-
duction the author remarks: “The absence
of action and the general talkiness are in-
tentional —and, I hope, in a small way sym-
bolic.” The play deals with, Australian
“territorials” of 1913, and the threatened in-
vasion from China. It is, unfortunately,
dreadful talky. but its clever climax might,
with a drastically cut dialogue, have -a
chance on the stage. Its characters are
crudely drawn Australian types. The author
has symbolically typified the Yellow inva-
sion by the descent of Chinese burglars upon
the undefended household of unpatriotic
Australians. The moral thus neatly indi-
cated is that Australians will talk but do
nothing for defence.
The title, “The Lepers,” would not do for
this play, as it discloses on the programme
the secret the author wishes to keep, for his
“curtain.” The scene is set in the cabin of
a private vacht, in which the mysterious
lady is vainly seeking to escape from the
pursuing yacht of the man who loves her.
The dialogue is good, but the end conven-
tional. The author shirked the “necessary
scene” between the lover and the lady when
he discovers that she is a leper. That was
the scene the audience had been led to ex-
pect; and in a matter like this an audience
must not be “had.” In “Mozart’s Requiem
the pathos is too obvious, though the sad
thing is well atmosphered. In “Chatterton,
by the same author, {here is the same too
palpable pathos—added to a tremendous
death-soliloquy by the poet. There is. how-
ever. a prettv little conventional plot, and
the plav would act in a well-mannered sen-
timental way. Leprosy is again the subject
of “The Remedy,” which opens with one
character “discovered in an attitude of
thought,” the necessary preliminary to a
soliloquy. There is a good dramatic interest
in the main theme. A man knows that he
has leprosy, and. to deceive his wife, pretends
that he is a drunkard. The emergence of a
hero out of a drunken sot is an interesting
dramatic motive; but the author has added
unnecessary sub-plots that fail to heighten
the pathos* of the main theme, and are, in
fact, quite unconnected with the develop-
ment of the chief action.
“Diamond Cut Diamond, a compressed
three-act play in six scenes, has plenty of
Australian atmosphere and vigorous action;
but most of the characters have an annoy-
ing habit of literary quotation. The char-
acter drawing is convincing; but the whole
thing is merely a good cattlerstealing cine-
matograph drama. A pleasant farce-
comedy. written in good Australian, but
with a conventional plot, is The Scare-
crow ” “Ruth Hillman.” labelled a tragedy,
shows us the happily engaged couple m the
.backblocks, to whom enters the woman of
tlu 1 man’s past. TLlie talk is the talk of
books, the situation is tarnished with age,
and the play is extended to two acts when
one should have sufficed.
We are now left with- five competitors for
the prize. ‘‘ln the Days of the Strike”
shows us all the stock characters —the man,
the woman, the factory proprietor, the
strike-leader, the children ; and the problem
set is whether the man will blackleg under
pressure from his sttfrving wife and hungry
children, not forgetting the “unborn babe."
The types are neatly portrayed; but the
play is vitiated by the fact that, as a rule,
women do not starve in Australia when
their husbands are oHt on strike. If it
comes to the point that strike-pay is no
longer available, the strike collapses. The
play is machine-made, with imported
machinery, and the moral sticks too prom-
inently out.
“At the Slip Rails” has more humanity
in it. It is the only comedy that is written
with real Australian humor, but the thing
is too slight in conception, and possesses no
element of dramatic surprise. The soliloquy
of the girl “waiting for the male” at the slip-
rails is justified; for in the back-blocks the
slip-rails are' usually the only things for a
girl to speak to. Thus the soliloquy, ban-
ished from the modern theatre overseas, may,
for years to come, find a comfortable home
in the Slip-Rail Drama of Australia. Her
soliloquy is interrupted by the arrival of
Dad with his gun, also waiting for the male.
The dialogue is delightfully natural; but
the climax belongs to the world of the novel.
The author is advised to keep on.
The three plays left in all deal with the
same subject—probably because it is the
stock subject for drama —the lonely wife
who is about to go off to civilisation with the
other bloke. In “Anoli the Blind,” c\
tragedy in a remote homestead in N.Q., the
woman is not even a wife. All the chief
characters are Italians, and passion and
jealousy and hatred and murder make the
plot. Anoli has been blinded by the woman
in an attempt to murder him, and he moves,
a sinister figure, through this sinister atmo-
phere. The play is tensely written, but the
ending is arbitrary, though dramatically
effective. It is a slice of life that leaves a
disagreeable taste.
“The Climax,” bv Edward Dyson, 164
Barkley-street, St. Ivilda, is more like the
real thing. The action takes place in,front
of a small bush hut; and with an expert
hand Dyson draws the brooding wife, ob-
sessed by the desolate loneliness of the bush,
and the husband unable to understand that
the silence is almost driving her mad. The
opening, where the wife spiritlessly washes
the clothes, and the husband fusses over his
new gun, has the well-known quality of
Dyson humor and pathos. The husband
goes off for the day, and the lover appears.
Her longing to escape from the bush, not
her love for him, is her weakness; but she
has resolution enough to refuse the ’over.
And during this scene we catch a glimpse of
the husband, unexpectedly returned, reach-
ing out of the window and taking what he
thinks is his gun, but is a similar gun
brought in by the lover. The scene ends
with the lover going out to shoot himself in
the saplings if the woman does not follow
him within five minutes. She refuses to go.
A shot is heard —but it would be unfair to
detail the unexpected climax here. The
play is realistic, lit with understanding of
humanity, and crudely dramatic.
“The Kid’s Fingers,” by J. Stanley
Hughes, “Wynella,” Fletcher-street, Bondi,
Sydney, is an equally admirable play, set in
a less melodramatic key. Into the selector’s
hut the husband comes, happily home to find
the one-year-old kid sleeping in its cot and a
letter from his wife telling him she has gone.
He takes the shock with fine bravery. On
his departure into the next room, the wife
and lover appear. She has made the lover
drive back, for she cannot go without her
child. The man stays outside ; and while she
is going to pick the kid up, she is startled to
find her husband confronting her. To her
consternation her husband assumes that she
has come back to him, and takes the blame
upon himself for her dreary life. He speaks
hopefully of a brighter future. .. .with a
gramophone and a visit for her and the kid
to Sydney. Then, dead tired, he lies down
and falls asleep—a theatric convention that
the audience will easily forgive. Here is
the opportunity for the woman again. But,
with the child in her arms, she is suddenly
overcome, and slams the door in her lover’s
face. Then, with the noise of wheels and
galloping hoofs dying away, she confesses.
It was the kid’s fingers holding her face
that had kept her. When woman has
sinned or is going to sin, she says, it is not
pity nor kisses she needs, but understanding.
The ending is charming, and the whole thing
a delightfully human play.
The two-guinea “author’s fee” is divided
between the authors of “The Kid’s Fingers”
and the poorly titled “The Climax.” The
last five plays mentioned will be submitted
to the repertory theatres mentioned.

STANZAS FROM "THE BUSH."
Yea, Mother Bush, in your deep dreams
abide
Cupids alert for man and maid unborn,
Apprentice Bucks amid, your saplings hide.
And wistful gorges wait a Roland horn:
Wallet of Sigurd shall this sicag replace,
And centaurs curvet where those brumbies
race.
That drover's tale of love shall greaten duly
Through magic prisms of a myriad years,
Till burns Isolde to Tristram’s fervor newly,
Or Launcelot to golden Guinevere's....
Where is Australia, singer, do you know?
These sordid farms, and joyless factories,
Mephitic mines and lanes of pallid woe?
These ugly towns and * cities such as these
With incense sick to all unworthy power.
And all old sin in full malignant flower?
No! to her bourn her children still are far-
ing :
She is a temple that We are to build :
For her the ages have been long preparing:
She is a prophecy to be fulfilled!. .
Yet she shall be as tee, the Potter, mould:
Altar Or tomb, as we aspire, despair:
What wine we bring shall she, the chalice,
hold:
What word we write shall she, the script,
declare:
Bandage our eyes, she shall be Memphis,
Spain:
Barter our souls, she shall be Tyre again:
And if ice pour on her the red oblation
All o’er the world shall Asshur’s buzzards
throng:
Love-lit, her Chaos shall become Creation:
And dewed with dream, her silence flower
in song.
From “The Bush,”
by Bernard O’Dowd.
Bernard O’Dowd
The most interesting development in Aus-
tralian poetry of recent years is the almost
dramatic awakening of Australian bards to
the need of immigration. This continent
must be populated or abandoned to others
who will populate it. The poets have had
little to say, except.a bland approval, to the
policy of the Government of introducing agri-
cultural laborers from overseas, and the
recent threatened stoppage of that immigra-
tion has, so far, aroused no frenzy of poetic
indignation. But in their own department
of immigration there is a recent access of
zeal. This continent lacks, not only
sufficient agricultural laborers, but suffi-
cient gods. The gods of the aborigines
cannot be adapted for white Australian pur-
poses, and compared with’the gods of myth-
ology they are mere stone-age savages.
Hence the clamant need to import, for
poetic purposes, a consignment of seasoned
and well-authenticated gods. Here is a
bare patch of land, eminently suitable for
gods, that has been left uncultivated since
the beginning of time. The bush must be
populated with imported mythological
beings; our nation is ready to welcome
them ; and there seems no reasonable doubt
but that the gods of antiquity can be suc-
cessfully acclimatised, while in due time
there is every possibility that, in the favor-
able environment of Australia, they will pro-
duce new gods, true Australian gods, who
who will no longer speak of Greece and
Norway as “Home.”
This patriotic experiment has already
been tried by poets like Hugh MeCrae and
Frank Morton (and championed in art by
Norman Lindsay, and. in his etchings, by
Lionel Lindsay), while Bernard O'Dowd
has always kept the project in view. Now.
in The Bush (Lothian. Melb., 2s. 6d.) he
puts forward the complete prospectus.
The poem is, despite the inevitable
o’dowdisms, and a plethora of colons, a
fine piece of work, as solid a bit of metrical
architecture as has been produced in Aus-.
tralia. The theme of the long poem is ad-
mirably portrayed, with sudden touches of
true poetry, and many a pregnant phrase.
Its argument is that the bush, which is
the soul of Australia, is the matrix of-the
Australia of the future, that we are but the
forerunners, the bushwhackers of the Ilium
of the south, that all the heroic—and non-
heroic—incidents of these pioneering days
will form the groundwork of the legend that
will, for our descendants, be Australia.
The miner cradling icashdirt by the creek,
Or pulled through darkness dripping to
the plat:
The navvy boring tunnels through the peak:
The farmer grubbing box-trees on the
flat:
The hawker camping by the roadside spring:
The hodman on the giddy scaffolding:
Even
Moths that around the fashion windows
flutfer:
The racecourse spider and the betting fly:
The children romping by the city gutter
are but the rough blocks from which sculp-
tors shall chisel brownie, fairy and fawn.
And myrmidons of some Homeric dream
From Melbourne mob and Sydney push
be drawn.
The humdrum lives that now we tire of,
then ,
Romance shall be. and we heroic men
Treading the vestibule of Golden Ages.
Here the poet drops into liis o’dowdisms:
Scholars to be our prehistoric drama
From Esson’s “Woman lamer shall
restore. ... ,
Our Gilbert Murray uirites ‘‘Euripides” :
Pirani merges in Pythagoras... v
While Benvenuto Morton, drunk with sing-
Sees salamanders in a bush-fire's bed,
And Spencer sails from Alchennga bringing
Intaglios, totems, and Books of the Dead.
■By Way was Homer into Greek trans-
lated. ...
Bowie's entwines with Cagliostro’s name...
Tillett and Mann are Tyler then and Cade. .
And Archibald begets Australia's Muse
Upon an undine red of Chowder Bay
Rose Scott refutes dogmatic Cyril gaily
A hotch-potch of contemporary names and
prose statements, the purposely common-
place emphasised in order to enforce the
poet’s view that Romance is now ; but these
are polemics, not poetry. They are, how-
ever, but the necessary blemishes m the de-
lineation of a patriotic and poetic idea.
Finely, in isolateu stapzas has O Dowd
emphasised the romance around us: —
And, mid the censers of the mountain
musk.
Acolyte bell-birds the Angelas are pealing.
And boobooks moan lone yespers in the
* dusk
but much of his imagery is too new, though
time will soften its glaring tints: —■
The yang-yang screams o'er cactus wilder-
nesses ....
‘ For a complete understanding of this
poem a dictionary of mythology is neces-
sary. But we shall need all our mythology
when the immigrant gods arrive. It
is impossible. in a poem of this
length, to keep up the necessary head of
poetic steam all the way, but there are iso-
lated lines that show the poet’s quality.
O'Dowd is a poet that Australia must take
account of: he has something to say, and
must be allowed to choose his own words,
even though, in so doing, he decimates the
dictionary.
The English Language
In his valuable book, The Task of Social
Hygiene (Constable, per Dymock’s Library),
Havelock Ellis discusses the question of the
world-language of the future. The claims
of English are ably tabulated :
“English is the most concise and laconic
of the great languages. Greek, French and
German are all more expansive, more syl-
labically copious. Latin alone may be said
to equal or surpass English in concentration.
This power of English to attain expression
with a minimum expenditure of energy....
furnishes no claim to preference. for actual
speaking, in which this economy of energy
ceases to be a supreme virtue, since here we
have also to admit the virtues of easy intelli-
gibility and of persuasiveness.... The inapti-
tude of English for the purposes of speech
is well illustrated in our oratory. .. .The
English intellect, with all its fine qualities,
is not sufficiently nimble for either speaker
or hearer to keep up with the swift brevity
of the English tongue. It is a curious fact
that Great Britain takeg the lead in Europe
in the prevalence of stuttering; the language
is probably a factor in this evil pre-eminence,
for it appears that the Chinese, whose lan-
guage is powerfully rhythmic, never stut-
ter.... While an admirably strong and con-
cise language, English is by no means so
adequate in actual speech ; it is not one of-
the languages which can be heard at a long
distance, and. moreover, it lends itself in
speaking to so many contractions that are
not used in writing—so many “can’ts” and
“won’ts” and “don’ts,” which suit English
taciturnity, but slur and ruin English
speech—that English, as spoken, is almost a
different language from that which excites
admiration when written.
"Moreover, it must tte remembered that
English is not a democratic language. It is
not, like the chief Romance languages and
the chief Teutonic languages, practically
homogeneous, made out of one block. It is
formed by the mixture of two utterly unlike
elements, one aristocratic, the other plebeian.
Ever since the Norman lord came over to
England a profound social inequality has
become rooted in the very language. The
exclusive use of English as an international
language would be a misfortune for the na-
tions already using it. since they would be
deprived of that .mental flexibility and emo-
tional sympathy which no discipline can
give so well as the knowledge of a living
foreign tongue.”
The claims of other living languages are
similarly ruled out by the author; and he
suggests thai a language called Ido—an im-
proved language based on Esperanto-—upon
the compilation of which an international
delegation of scientific men is now at work,
furnishes the only solution of an auxiliary
language for the world.

ASK YOUR WIFE
Being charged with the duty of assuring the maximum of comfort, at the
least possible expense, she appreciates the advantages of a perfect lighting
system, which is absolutely safe and clean.
SHE KNOWS
that the installation of a gas service means the saving of an untold amount of
work and worry, and, more than anyone else, realises the benefits of having
a gas stove and bath-heater always ready to help her through the continuous
round of household duties.
The Immense Saving Effected by
QUIRK S AIR GAS
is alone a very important factor, for it is far cheaper than any known lighting
agent, while —being non-explosive and non-poisonous—there is no need to be
constantly on one’s guard against accidents.
THE SIMPLICITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MACHINE
assures reliability, and obviates the necessity of any skilled attendance.
Company send their own Experts to install the system, and no payment
is asked until the Customer gives his certificate as to satisfactory service.

Every Woman Can Have
a PERFECT Figure!
Thin Women .
If you are flat-chested,

scraggly—e ven if you
never had a nicely-rounded
bosom, Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-
food will build you up
and develoD your figure. Does vour mirror mock
you ? Flesh-food will remove the faults in your
figure by rounding out and developing the defi-
cient places. Put up in Tablet form, it is easy
to use and pleasant to take, and, if desired,
may be taken secretly. Taken under our direc-
tions, it will work wonders for your appearance.
RESULTS GUARANTEED.
In many cases bust measurements have been in-
creased by over ten inches, and the weight over
five pounds weekly. Other cases have shown an
increase in weight of even a pound a day. The
average bust increase desired is about six inches,
and is readily accomplished.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development to
the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women. Get full particulars.

Fat
People.
Excess fat injures your health, impedes .your
movements, and makes you the butt of your
unfeeling normal-weight friends. People who
have been fat, and are now reduced to normal,
think other fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat injure your health
and endanger your existence, it absolutely de-
stroys your figure and makes you a ludicrous
sight. Why do you stay fat? “FATCURE
positively removes excess fat, and will restore
your spoiled figure to decent and pleasing pro-
portions, and is always a sure and lasting cure
for obesity and corpulency. A few doses im-
proves your breathing wonderfully, and the course
of treatment will cure you.
RESULTS GUARANTEED.
It is the only successful, and, at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been discov-
ered. Its efficacy has been undeniably demon-
strated in thousands of successfully-treated cases.
It is totally and absolutely non-poisonous, and can
in no wise work any injury to the general health ;
though it often reduces excess weight by as much
as a pound a day.

Tobacco
Kills!

MOST MEN would
cure themselves of
the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing
themselves discom-
fort. ... It takes but
ten minutes for To-
bacco to change the
beats of the heart.
To keep it up is to
tempt death by heart
disease, nervous col-
lapse, tobacco cancer
and stomach, liver or
kidney disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tem, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

Away from the World.
Away from the world,
Where no picture shows are,
Nor mummers to jar
On lite’s ideality,
Wrapped in reality,
Such as you seek
At the end of a week,
Or here,
In a year,
In an island away from the rest
Of the world you’ve exchanged, for repose,
You may dream you have bucked all the
woes
Of unrest from their seat on your chest.
Oh yes, you may dream
That repose is supreme,
And that all the conditions are just what
they seem.
Alone, you may think as you’re gadding
Away in the woodlands apart,
Afar from the crowd that is madding,
With a book or the girl of your heart.
But things are not so, and the crowd that
can “mad,”
In mode most efficient, is that which is sad,
By units and twos,
Alone, on the loose,
And loves to amuse,
With yabber profuse,
The stranger, whose prayer
Is the cry of despair—-
Ah, where
Can I fare
Away from the world?

Non-Progressive Joy.
The modern poet should not sing
Of gods who made the old world fair,
Of knights who tilted in the ring,
Of maids with pale and twisted hair;
These things to-day are out of date,
Like sandals, daggers and the like ;
The toiling bard must learn to make
A hymn to match the motor-bike,
The trust, the combine and the strike.
An aeroplane against the sun
Is dropping bird-men to the ground;
Excited people madly run
To catch their limbs on the rebound ;
A phonograph is singing loud,
Its Yankee accent shrill with pain;
While politicians to the crowd
Roar strips of language loud and vain
Their broken pledges to explain.
The trams are shrieking down the wire;
Wild motor-cars, with stench and horn,
Speed on the large, inflated tyre,
Raising a dust of pride and scorn;
Without a pause the message speeds
Through copper net-works spread on high,
While one the trembling ether reads
Across the Telefunken sky,
Making all distances a lie.
These are the things that should engage
The soul of the uplifted bard ;
His hand should smite in splendid rage
The type upon his key-board hard;
His mind should see the years unfurled,
With greater wonders yet to rise,
When new inventions lift the world
To bump its forehead on the skies,
And fact triumphant scorns surprise.
But strangely his perverted mind
Wheels back upon the ancient things ;
A maiden’s dimple he can find
More tuneful than the cashful strings
Loud progress lifts her hands to pull;
Two lips that hold one rosy kiss
Are more to the unseeing fool
Than all the hints of golden bliss
That mining speculators miss.
For thus the cranky ages turn,
And while invention grows apace
The world has incense still to burn
Before a young and smiling face;
For all the splendid wheels that spin,
The fact is patent still and clear,
This planet sways to elder sin
That swathed in joy its youngest year—
New petrol cannot match old beer.

Pierrot and Pierrette.
“Funiculi ! Funicula!” The lilting chorus
breaks and dies. .
Pierrot, he smiles. Pierrette, she sighs.
Beyond., the river waters lie
Gleaming beneath a starry sky;
And where the shore is swept with light,
The jesters flame their red and white.
All life is love and melody,
A gay-capped feast of revelry.
“Funiculi! Funicula!” A ripple of the
harpist’s strings
A voice that floats like silver wings
While o’er the dreamy, tropic night
Hot, yellow flowers breathe- delight.
Life’s but an hour of revelry ;
A puff-ball cup of melody.
Pierrot, he laughs; Pierrette, she lies —
The truth is written in her eyes.

Love v. Death.
If I were dead,
I’d have no debts to pay;
No thoughts of “might” or may ;
No sorrow, no dismay.
The grass o’erspread
Upon my grave would be;
The wind would croon to me,
There for Eternity,
O’er my lone bed.
Yet, were I dead,
I’d lose the night’s soft skies;
The sweet breath of your sighs;
The love fires in your eyes,
With passion fed.
Life may be sad awhile •
We’ll make it reconcile
Love me, my love, and I’ll
Take Death as read.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tin: Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to ver-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official alivays is.

THE LIBERAL “MACHINE” AND ITS
DEPLORABLE TENDENCY TO
TURN TORIES INTO ANAR-
CHISTS.
There is some ground for thinking that proposals
for a comprehensive scheme of national insurance
against sickness and unemployment will be a matter
of practical politics in the Federal arena before very
long. It is believed that it will be advocated as part
of the policy of the Liberal party if it should be re-
turned to power at the next general election.
—Great Liberal daily.
The repeal of the land tax is no part of the
Federal Liberal party’s policy. Apart from other
considerations such a step would be impracticable on
financial grounds.— lbid.
The Commonwealth Navy has come to stay, and the
sooner disgruntled critics realise that fact the better.
—lbid.
It is the ceaseless dropping of such intima-
tions that wears away the trusting Liberal’s
patience. “What is truth?” asked a prom-
inent anti-Socialist helplessly 1900 years ago.
His modern prototype has taken to inquiring,
with a similar air of stupefaction, “What is
anti-Socialism?” For years and years the
Liberal or Tory or Conservative or Reac-
tionary, or whatever he may be called or mis-
called, has been voting for candidates whom
he had every reason to regard as anti-Social-
ists. Also, he has been subscribing to their
campaign funds, orating on their behalf, en-
tertaining the electors at vast At Homes in
their interest, and writing more or less
incoherent letters in praise of their efforts —
all in the cause of Individualism and the
Empire. During this glad and hopeful
period, the persons in whose interests he was
spending his time and money and energy
used to tell him that Socialism was a raven-
ing tiger, and that it was their aim in life
—to the exclusion of fiscalism. Defence and
all else—to slay the brute utterly. Whereat
the soul of the Liberal grew joyous within
him, and he warmly asked the prospective
big-game destroyers what they would drink.
William McLinen, of N. S. Wales, one of
the most splendid patriots and fearless Tiger-
baiters of them all, was characteristically
strenuous in his advocacy of the drawing of
a clear-cut line betwen political vice and
virtue. In July, 1910, he said: —
I would suggest, as a beginning, that in Parlia-
ment, the term Labor should never be used for the
Socialist party ; also that in the announcement of
candidates at the forthcoming and other elections, our
leading journals should use the designation Socialist
as contradistinct from Liberal.
By such spirited pronouncements the anti-
Socialist elector was greatly heartened. He
took the people who were after his suffrages
very seriously. He believed in the menace of
the Tiger and its cubs, and told himself that,
with a bit of luck, the entire menagerie
would shortly be exterminated. And
what has his reward been? Actually he
is offered here and now the revolting soec-
tacle of his f 12-per-week wild-beast assailers
not merely sparing the Tiger, but offering it
raw meat and other sustaining food.
The rank Socialism which is bound up
with any “comprehensive scheme of national
insurance” becomes apparent when one con-
siders the experiences in this line of other
countries. Germany looks after its worker
from the first onset of sickness. By means_
of free medical attendance, sick pay, mater-
nity benefits for women, permanent invalidity
pensions, old-age, widows and orphans’ pen-
sions, sanatoria, etc., the Fatherland does
its level best to sap that independence of
spirit which anti-Socialism holds to be man’s
most priceless asset. The ailing Teuton
isn’t even worried by the reflection that he
will need to leave behind him sufficient cash
to pay for his burial expenses. A funeral
benefit system assures for him the prompt
and decent planting of his remains. In the
United Kingdom, under the Lloyd George
Act, the State helps to provide the working
classes with—
(l) Medical attendance in sickness to the end of
life.
(2) Sickness pay (from the fourth day) for 26
weeks.
(3) Maternity benefit for all insured women and
wives of insured men.
(4) Sanatorium benefit.
(5) Disablement pay until the age of 70.
(6) Old age pension at and after the age of 70.
It may be taken as read that Australia will
not lag behind either Germany or Britain in
the treatment of its invalid toilers. What-
ever scheme of invalidity insurance is adopted
here, it is certain that the employer and the
State will, between them, have to find a
goodly proportion of the money. To big
concerns like the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co. and the Melbourne Gas Co.—institutions
which have lavished all their faith, and,
unless rumor lies, a fair amount of hard cash
on Liberalism —the blow will be terrific.
And it will in no wise be lightened for them
by the consideration that it has been deliv-
ered by the party which has been posturing
for years as Socialism’s deadliest foe.
Nor do the wrongs which the genuine anti-
Socialist suffers at the hands of the bogus
anti-Socialists end here. A year or so ago
the Fisher Government’s Progressive Land
Tax was reckoned the ultimate howl in the
way of confiscation and daylight robbery.
To attempt to justify it was equivalent, in
well-to-do circles, to adulating Beelzebub
or excusing the practice of matricide. It was
Socialism, if not Anarchy. Suppose the Par-
liamentary Labor party identified a flagrant
and wicked piece of individualism, and made
its abolition one of their battle cries during
several years. Assume, for example, that
girl-sweating of a disgraceful sort was going
on —something even more disreputable than
that which prevails in the white-work busi-
ness at the present time. And assume that,
after making much political capital, and
earning thousands of votes by their alleged
furious hostility to this evil, the Laborites
suddenly abandoned the agitation, and, by
so doing, inferentially bestowed an official
benediction on the thing which they had for-
merly cursed as an intolerable wrong. What,
one wonders, would be the feelings of honest
anti-sweaters towards them! It is impos-
sible to say worse than that they would be
precisely the feelings of those unhappy
Tories who were deceived three years ago by
the glozing yarns of Liberal candidates on
the subject of their undying hostility to land
taxation, and who now find that the candi-
dates are liars and that they have no more
serious intention of wiping the Fisher Gov-
ernment’s much-cursed measure off the
Statute Book than they have of casting them-
selves from the top of the post office. It is
the same, without exception, in the case of
every other allegedly pestiferous act of “the
Socialists.” The ears of Emoire-leaguers
are still ringing, in a manner of speaking,
with the denunciations which the Cooks and
W. E. Johnsons of this afflicted ■ Common-
wealth hurled at the Australian navy pro-
posals. The allegations of these political
frauds were of no light order. They claimed
that an Australian squadron would not only
be tactically useless, but that it would (1)
fail to attract any sailors and (2) be used
ultimately to blow the British navy out of
the water." The Australian navy is here, to
all intents and purposes. More men have
offered than are required. Does Liberalism,
which used to claim that an effective local
fleet would constitute a menace to the Em-
pire’s chief line of defence, feature its aboli-
tion on the party platform? Not it! Liber-
alism is trying to forget that it ever howled
for the Dreadnought foolishness. It has
definitely adopted the “Mosquito Fleet”
ideal. In this, as in other principle-swallow-
ing feats, the Parliamentary imperialist and
anti-Socialist has been a thoroughly consist-
ent Liberal.
* * * *
Of course the Liberal politician does not
perform these unpleasant and discreditable
feats as a matter of pure enjoyment. He is
impelled thereto by the exigencies of the
party machine. To do him bare justice he
proceeds often enough to the place where he
is required to make a public meal of his own
lately-uttered opinions, with the same' com-
plete lack of enthusiasm which is noticeable
in the drunk who is having a frog’s-march
to a police-station. Withal he goes —for the
alternative consists in being ousted from the
party, and from the financial advantages
associated therewith. Parliamentary Lib-
eralism does not want to be Socialistic if it
can help it. Its trouble lies in the fact that
anti-Socialism is impracticable in a civilised
State. It is a good creed to blither about,
but an impossible one to practice. Educa-
tion and Socialism, like Gilbert’s pale young
curate and love, walk ever hand in hand.
The electors may vote for a candidate who
labels himself anti-Socialist, provided he con-
ducts himself rationally in other respects.
But if he does not help to provide them with
generous doses of Socialism, they mark their
approval of his consistency by passing him
out of public life. None know this better
than the party bosses. The aim of practi-
cally all of them is office at any price. But
office depends on outside support. The Lib-
eral leaders are not much concerned to cater
for the complete Tory. The rich they have
always had with them, and they consider
that this is a support which cannot be alien-
ated. Ruthlessly disregarding the enraged
countenance of Adipose, they accordingly
proceed to chase after the favor of the doubt-
ful quantity, i.e, the man in the bowyangs.
The Australian Industries Preservation Act,
the whole of the Commonwealth’s anti-Trust
legislation to date, Federal Old Age Pensions
and various other measures of the sort —all
of them introduced by the people who now
claim to be anti-Socialists—are manifesta-
tions of this tendency to collar votes or burst.
National Insurance is coming, the Land Tax
is to be left unassailed —if, indeed, it isn’t
made more stringent—and in a little
while we shall probably have anti-Socialists
advocating State hotels and haberdashery
shops, and threatening to nationalise the
coastal shipping trade.
A pathetic figure in this maelstrom of
false pretences, and mendacity, and sreed
and broken pledges is the forthright Tory,
who believes in his demented doctrine and
sees no reason why his representatives
shouldn’t carry it out. There is nothing of
the bogus anti-Socialist about this choleric
old stalwart. He would welcome the repeal
of every progressive Act of the last 25 years.
It is his tragedy that none of the politicians
are disposed to hold the bridge of reaction
with him. To all intents and purposes he is
unrepresented in Parliament. For all the
good the place is to him he might as well be
disfranchised. The depressing, and, at a
casual glance, anomalous result, is that the
true-blue Conservative is developing into the
nearest apnroach to an anarchist that the
more enlightened countries possess. During
the last Referendum campaign Bruce
Smith, M.P.; Lee, M.L.A., of N. S. Wales;
and others publicly mentioned revolution and
bloodshed if the proposed amendments were
carried. Bonar Law, the British Tory leader,
is voicing similar sentiments in England at
the present time in anticipation of Home
Rule becoming an accomplished fact. A
number of affluent company directors starkly
defied the law the other day in N. S. Wales,
and were fined for it. Everywhere anti-
Socialism is to be observed seething with the
spirit of rebellion. The development is de-
plorable, but inevitable. There is no place
for the genuine Tory in the world as it is
constituted to-day. He belongs, by rights,
to the Feudal period, or thereabouts. He
has no prospect of establishing the justice of
his cause by weight of logic. The dynamite
cap is about the only argument left to him,
and the hand-grenade is one of his few re-
maining hopes. When Australia reads one
morning that numbers of stout, elderly gen-
tlemen have been seen crawling furtively
about after the fashion of malefactors, with
bombs and other lethal articles in their
hands, it will realise that the worst has oc-
curred, and that anti-Socialism has at last
lost the only genuinely anti-Socialist sup-
port it ever had.
THE NAMES THAT TAKE THE PLACE
OF THOUGHT AND WORK.
It is characteristic of primitive peoples that
they lay great stress upon names and sym-
bols. It is characteristic of all peoples that
they cling to the names and symbols of
earlier days long after those names and
symbols have ceased to have either meaning
or use. Barbaric crests and emblematic
coats-of-arms are still in many lands the out-
ward tokens of a superiority of race and
caste, and a College of Heralds survives and
does large business in an age of wireless
telegraphy, aeroplanes and Beef Trusts. The
bishop still wears an apron to show the
arduous nature of his toil, wives wear the
chain-link of the old marital slavery on their
left hands, men are still called dukes when
every semblance of the leadership which
their name implies is gone, and the grip of
the right hand remains as the token of
friendship when there is nojonger any need
to hold that hand away fron| the treacherous
dagger hilt. The name will survive
all kingdoms, the name (f assar will out-
live all empires, and John Bull’s patrony-
mic will still be associated with roast beef
when he hasn’t a baked sparrow of his own
that he can eat. In the realm of politics
names and party cries continue to sway the
minds of citizens long after they have ceased
to stand for the things that once gave them
force and honor. While men fly in terror
from the name which is still outside the
bounds of respectability, they cling with
fatuous devotion to the older name which
has lost all the claim it ever possessed to be
regarded as respectable or even decent. The
mediaeval reverence for the name and title
of a king is not more remarkable than the
political prostration before the party word
which stood for something in the days of
our grandfathers, but which has now lost
all its better significance. This disease
of name-worshin is endemic in all countries,
and Australia, for all its larger opportunities
and possibilities of wider outlook, is just as
much afflicted as older lands. Here as else-
where the word retains its power when all
that gave it life and meaning for thinking
men has passed out of it, leaving it as empty
as the pub that has lost its license.
The explanation of all this is to be found
readily enough. Every word which finds its
way into a language represents the accumu-
lation and crystallisation of a vast amount
of thought. The syllables themselves may
fall together almost by chance, or be coined
by a writer in a careless moment, but the
word to have place and use must have had
the way prepared for it by a great quantity
of brain effort, often spread over years or
even centuries. Thus the term Wowser,
which has, only recently been incorporated
in the Australian tongue, represents a long
process of thought on the part of thousands
of people about certain problems of the day
and the attitude of narrow and unsympa-
thetic minds towards them. It does not
matter much who invented the word—which
was, after all, no very remarkable achieve-
ment —but the fact does matter that a long
process of reasoning had led to the demand
for a word which should express the easy
and tolerant contempt of the public for the
new bigotry in social matters which had
established its pernicious growth among us.
And all this is true also of political terms
and party names, only excepting the fact
that such terms and names are more liable
to change in meaning and force than any
others which become regularly incorporated
into language. In the first place, then,
thought, and lots of it, went to the making
of every one of these labels. They stood for dis-
tinct and often very complicated ideas which
had been slowly evolved. But having once
got these labels at some cost, the greater
number of the world’s citizens are content
to go on using them in order tp avoid
further thought and effort. It is much
easier to read the daily papers, go in the
evening to a theatre or picture-show and
talk to a friend in the tram or nub about
the Balkan war or the latest fight at the
Stadium than to do a little serious and in-
dependent thinking about the real meaning
of things which are so easily packed up in
unopened parcels and labelled with handy
names and words.
* * * *
As illustrating the force of names in poli-
tics the election for the Blayney seat
(N.S.W.) furnishes a striking object lesson.
One of the three candidates went to the poll
as a Liberal. It is a good old name sugges-
tive of big things, for there were once big
Liberals, and in some countries the name
still stands for honesty of purpose and a
battle for vast reforms. But even in the
land where the word came to birth its mean-
ing has been a very changeable one. Eng-
lish election crowds waiting for Liberal
speakers to address them on questions of the
day still sing an old election song to a sort
of hymn tune :
We’ll raise again the Liberal flag
Of Gladstone, Cobden. Bright,
And peace, retrenchment and reform
Shall be our cry to-night.
It isn’t much of a song, and it isn’t true.
The Liberalism of Gladstone wasn’t the
Liberalism of Cobden to any extent, and the
Liberalism of neither had even a decent
superficial resemblance to that of Lloyd
George. Still, the song goes with a swing
and Liberalism is a good catchword. What
more should a crowd want? But the Lib-
eralism of N. S. Wales is not even in any
sort of succession from the thing that wore
the label in the past, or in any sort of sym-
pathy with the thing which wears it even
now in England and Canada. The present
Liberals of Australia have no sort of affi-
nity to the Gladstones, Greys and King-
stons who once were proud of the title. It
is now simply a serviceable name for a party
containing the dregs and leavings of all
parties which have been united by force of
circumstances into an organisation whose
purpose is to get the loaves and fishes of
office and oppose all reform and bolster up
by every possible means the interests of the
fat man against those of the lean. Older
Liberals, if they troubled at all about the
matter, might reasonably rise from their
graves to hurl charnel clods of indignation
at the usurpers of their honored title; but
the word answers its purpose, and any num-
ber of electors at Blayney and elsewhere are
prepared to take it quite seriously.
* * * *
But the name Liberal is not singular in
that it is the only term likely to deceive
citizens at Blayney. Beeby stands as an
Independent, and the word by which he de-
scribes himself is apt to conjure up in the
public mind a vision of the strong and sturdy
democrat who, for the truth that is in him.
refuses to be bound by the conventions of
party, and, aiming at great reforms, insists
on following conviction and conscience at
all costs and in the face of all opposition.
But Beeby is not an Independent of that
sort, for at the very outset of his campaign
he made it clear that it was his intention to
form a third party. As the very terms In-
dependent and party are contradictory,
Beeby’s declaration made it plain that he
wasn’t the thing that he pretended to be,
and evers other word he has spoken has
made it equally clear that his desertion of
existing parties was due to nothing large
and free in his political outlook, but merely
to his desire to form part and parcel of
some organisation of narrower outlook and
smaller aim than the thing from which he
had retired or been driven. Still, the word
Independent has an attractive sound, and as
a vote catcher is at least as good a label as
that worn by either of his opponents. The
third candidate, who is now out of the race,
was branded Labor. Here again the term
was wholly misleading, for Johnston stood
as a supporter of the McGowen-llolman
Ministry, which, while wearing the Labor
name, has treated its party pledges as a jest,
and shown a spirit which bore no faint re-
semblance to that of the big organisation
which placed it in power. John Smith, of
Blayney, might well be pardoned if he hesi-
tated before giving his support to a Minis-
try which had placed the interests of a State
above those of Australia, and had acted in
a spirit of bitter hostility to the Common-
wealth whenever the opportunity arose.
Johnston might be the best of Australians,
but Johnston’s return could only have the
effect of strengthening the hands of
McGowen’s hopeless Ministry, which
neither represents Australian sentiment nor
supports Labor aims. Still, the name Labor
had its influence on votes, and served all the
purpose that the best label could serve even
if it were a true description of the goods
labelled.
* * * *
Blayney election is an unfortunate busi-
ness—for the electors. With an alleged Lib-
eral, Independent and Laborite to choose
from, they were still practically disfran-


chised. ihe alleged liberal was merely a
Tory of a very inferior brand ; the so-called
Independent a party man of the smallest
kind who thought he might win an advan-
tage in a re-shuffle of the political cards;
and the person selected to represent Labor
was compelled to present himself as the sup-
porter of a Government which has done
more to bring discredit on the Labor cause
than all the crooked works of the opponents
of that movement. It was a pretty choice,
and what the result of the second ballot may
be cannot matter the quiver of a lizard’s
tail to any Australian. But the political
names are good and high-sounding, and even
beautiful, and in our much prized system of
party politics, which cheats John Smith
to his own apparent satisfaction, the name
counts for a good deal more than anything
else. Possibly a time may come when John
Smith will get tired of being cheated and
insist upon his politicians having one name
with only one meaning. When the only
political party is called the Australian,
things will begin to move forward.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Dropping the Passenger.
Alfred Deakin practically severed his con-
nection with the alleged Liberal party of
Australia last week. He has resigned the
leadership of the Opposition, and after the
Referendum campaign he proposes to go
into retirement for good. It must be a
blessed relief to him, and it is certainly an
even greater one to the reactionaries into
whose midst he was driven four years ago
by one of Party Government’s queer necessi-
tous shifts. Melbourne Argus voiced the
sentiments of Toryism all over Australia
when it remarked (9/1/T3) :
The retirement which Mr. Deakin announced yes-
terday was too long delayed by a year at least. The
circumstances which impel him to relinquish his post
now were equally existent then. His leadership of the
Liberal party during the session of 1912 left much —
almost everything—to be desired.
To straight-out Conservatism Alfred
Deakin was anathema from the jump. The
ordinary man, realising this, would have re-
garded the position as hopeless and unten-
able and retired long ago. But Deakin has
the gift for which W. E. Gladstone was
famous, and of which A. J. Balfour is one
of the most distinguished living exponents,
of being able to talk himself into almost any
given point of view. Yet the Fusion com-
pact or swindle put too great a strain even
on his accommodating intellect. He was a
convinced high-tariffist. As the price of
association with ,T. Cook. Bruce Smith
and Co. he had to sit inert, and watch the
manufactories of the Commonwealth lan-
guish, and the workers of Australia go job-
less, while the sweated goods of Europe and
Asia poured through our defective tariff
fence. He knew the fence needed a general
overhaul. But by the terms of his bargain
with the importers’ representatives he was
precluded from so much as suggesting that
it required a fresh paling here and there.
The mental strain of convincing himself
that this was the better fiscal part must
have been terrific. He was an instinctive
democrat, a man with the imagination to
vision the joyless lot of the majority of the
workers even in this favored country, and
the heart to wish to better their condition.
The Trade Marks Act (1905), the Excise
Tariff Act (1906), and the Australian In-
dustries Preservation Act (1907) were all
his measures. The Trade Marks Act —a
scheme to compel the registering of a wor-
ker’s mark on all goods in order that the
consumer might know whether they had
been manufactured by unionists or non-
unionists —was denounced by his present
allies as an outrage on British freedom. Ilis
New Protection scheme and his anti-Trust
legislation were greeted with the heartiest
curses of Anti-Socialism. And. naturally so.
Anti-Socialism would have had even less
right to the name than it has, had it sat
down peacefully under these revolutionary
proposals. By the irony of Fate the sole
aim of the Fisher Government’s Referen-
dum campaign is to effectuate the very legis-
lation for which a Deakin Government was
originally responsible. There is nothing
more trying, not to say heart-breaking, for
a politician than to have to find convincing
arguments against the validating of his own
Acts. And that is the Herculean job with
which Deakin has been faced for some time
now. Of course he has been a failure at it.
For years he has been a mere passenger
aboard the “Liberal” ship. And now, de-
spite all the civil periphrases about ill-
health and the anguish of Messrs Cook and
Millen at his departure, the crew have
dropped him overboard. It has been done
gently, and a comfortable spot has been
selected. Had he waited longer it would
have been a question of. his colleagues
marooning him on a desert island.
No Place for the Uneducated Conscience.
A nation has a right to the use of all its
best brains, but in Party Politics there is no
place for them. Alfred Deakin, the most
winsome personality in Australian public lire,
has retired from the game, and someone ot
coarser mould must be found to take his
place. Lamentable as the admission is, our
political life as at present constituted has
no room for the man of finer temper. Ihe
honest man, if sufficiently endowed with tne
great gift of stupidity, may hold his own.
The clever man with the uneducated con-
science is likely to come to the front, out
the man who lias had both brain and con-
science whetted to.a fine cutting-edge, had
better stav away from an arena where i
can only win laurels at the expense of one or
the other. The most desirable leader in
party politics is the man whose instincts are
good, whose mind is keen and alert, and wno
doesn’t feel the ouiver of a nerve or tne
faintest titfgle of shame about doing and say-
ing things which in ordinary life would
bring him into discredit or disgrace.
Deakin wasn’t a man of that kind. He had
great opportunities, to which he was too hn
to rise. Under a non-party system of go
ernment he would have towered heat
and shoulders high above the crowd ; un
Party Government his magnificent strength
and talents were frittered away al }, T ' v '

A Trade Which Has Become Too Safe.
Last week a Alelbourne citizen made the
ratal error of going to bed with a couple of
Hundred pounds or,so on the premises. In
due course the customary masked robbers
arrived, lhey differed from those who have
been operating with such success in Sydney
and Adelaide in little but the dreadfulness
ot their language. Amidst a flood of hair-
raising oaths one of them shot the house-
holder dead, after which they left with the
money. It is just possible that these particu-
lar criminals may be apprehended ; the lurid-
ness of their speech was so much over the
odds as to afford a useful clue to their
identity. But so many of the malefactors
are not arrested that the law-abiding section
ot the public is feeling simply rotten. Here
is a civilised country, with costly courts,
gaols, penitentiaries, lock-ups, etc., a fair-
sized police force and a big army of detec-
tives in every State, and yet, seemingly, any
crude scoundrel possessed of sufficient cash
or credit to acquire a loaded revolver and a
mask is able with comparative safety to
burst into what house he pleases and rob
and slaughter the inhabitants. When the
dazed sociologist has done wondering why
this noxious trade should have become so
popular—whether it is due to the immigra-
tion policy or something else —he might pro-
fitably consider why the practitioners are so
rarely caught. For the most part they have
been not merely daring, but heroic in 'taking
risks. In Sydney, the other day, a band of
them stole a launch, steamed to the front
door, in a manner of speaking, comman-
deered all they could lay their hands on, and
afterwards cruised comfortably away into
oblivion. Others have walked leisurely up
the garden path, adjusting their masks
doubtless as they went, barged in through
the handiest aperture, and so home again,
richer by every portable article in sight.
The police, whether in Sydney, Melbourne
or Adelaide, have visited the place where
the valuables used to be, and after assuming
a siSindalised and at the same time knowing
air, have gone away, and, in most cases,
achieved nothing. It is quite possible that
they are incompetent. The pay of the
policeman is still so small all over the Com-
monwealth that intellectuals avoid the
Force; in fact, it is not rushed by persons
of even moderate intelligence. And, com-
petent or otherwise, are there enough of
them? It was stated a month or so ago
that in one North Sydney suburb of over
10,000 inhabitants there was but a solitary
constable. Many of the Melbourne suburbs
are grievously under-Dunned, and the same
criticism applies to Adelaide. The com-
bined futility and fewness of the metropoli-
tan police throughout Australia must have
a considerable bearing on the popularity of
burglary-CMm-murder as a calling. The ob-
vious thing to do is to set this part of the
national house in order, without delay. Bet-
ter-brained p.olice and more of them will cost
the States money, but the loss of such citi-
zens as he who was slaughtered last week
costs them infinitely more.
A Word Against the Boycotting of
Patriots.
Pending the appointment of a High Court
Judge to fill the place of the late R. E.
O’Connor, Liberalism is yapping strenuously
for what it calls a “non-political lawyer.”
So far as one can gather, any old lawyer
will suffice for this signally important billet,
provided always he has had no previous
association with statecraft. The inward-
ness of this demand becomes apparent wliefi
one remembers that many of the candidates
with Parliamentary experience are Demo-
crats, while practically every prominent bar-
rister who has confined himself to the prac-
tice of his profession is a hide-bound Tory.
There is, of course, an occasional exception
to this rule, but he is almost as rare as a
vegetarian shark. The Sydney Telegraph
put the “Liberal” case as follows: —
There are reasons which render the political
judge even more conspicuously out of place in the
High Court than he would be as a member of the
State judiciary. There is no need to go to militant
politics, in or out of Parliament, for Federal judges.
Other things equal, the less prominently a man has
figured in political strife the better his qualifications
for any tribunal, etc., etc.
Now, if there is one direction in which the
United Kingdom shines more refulgently than
another, it is in the quality of its judges.
And this is how the Lord Chancellor spoke
of their appointment, according to London
Times, at the last Guildhall Banquet:—
The office of Lord Chancellor was one that was
very puzzling to foreigners. The genius of British
law was very remarkable. Its sole purpose was to
see justice done according to the standard of recti-
tude which prevailed in a country like theirs, and to
that end they insisted that their Judges should he
trained not merely as lawyers or jurists, but as public
men, knowing something of public affairs.
I declare that if I were to be tried for a high
political offence I should wish to choose for those
who judged me twelve good men and true taken from
the Opposition side of the House of Commons. /Ap-
plause and laughter,.) You cannot get that training
in public affairs in any other place more perfectly.
Thus it comes.about that the head of the law the
•Judge to whom*is assigned the duty of superintending
not only in the supreme; tribunal of this country,
but of the Empire— is expected by the public to
have come through a career as a public man which
involves his spending a large part of his time m the
House of Commons-
It is this kind of thing which makes our country
unintelligible abroad,, but which enables us to com-
pass things which are not easily compassed elsewhere
wfget a wider outlook by that kind of training and
we get advantages which cannot be got bv nations
who g separate bad judges as a profession b -V them-
selves That is why our judges have always had the
closest relation to pubi c life
England has hardly had one really great
judge who was.a non-political. And the
same remark applies to America. Had local
Liberalism’s present aspirations been nut
into force from the beginning. Australia
would have lost Griffith, its greatest judge
to date and N. S. Wales would never have
had tS benefit of Martin's services. The
demented experiment has, fortunately, never
been tried on anything resembling an ex-
tended scale, and it is to be h °P« d tbqf ]t
never will. If there is one type that for a
multitude of reasons, is foredoomed to failure
“n the High Court Bench, it is the citizen
who has never considered his country so
well worth serving as his banking account.
Australia’s Aged and Decrepit Artillery.
“Don Q.”: The Bulletin’s remarks
(26/2/T2) about the deplorable arms of
the Turk apply equally to those of the Aus-
tralian. When the war-correspondent
writes up the invasion of the North, in
19 —, this is probably how he’ll commence :
The utter defeat of the Australians was due to the
overwhelmingly superior artillery of the invaders. It
wasn’t a fight, this gallant death of an army, it
was a mere slaughter. With obsolete artillery and
indifferent rifles, fashioned after the British pattern,
the Australian simply had no chance.
Although we have a few moderately efficient
18-pounder field guns, the bulk of the can-
non is 20 years and more old. In Queens-
land, where I am just now, the defence
ironmongery consists of three batteries (in-
complete) and a few ancient Maxims. The
field guns are principally of the old 15-
pounder type, and, if I’m not greatly mis-
taken, several of them are old muzzle-
loaders, which were converted into breech-
loaders years ago. Then we have one bat-
tery of 18-pounders—fairly good weapons,
fitted with the pneumatic recoil buffers.
Yet, when this gun is compared with, say,
the modern French field gun, it is a sad and
disturbing spectacle. The extreme range of
the 14.3 pounder used by the Bulgarian is
6500 yards (considerably greater than that
of our 18-pounder), while the rapidity of
fire possible with the French gun is more
than double that of the British-backed
weapon. Under pressure, 30 to 35 rounds
per minute can be fired from the French
implement, and I’ll defy Australia’s crack ar-
tillery squad to get 15 rounds per minute
(service conditions) out of our best gun. To
watch our Defence Department procrastin-
ating, you’d thing improvement was impos-
sible. Hearken to this. Bulgaria, with a
population only about equal to Australia’s,
completed the re-arming of its artillery one
year before hostilities broke out in the
Balkans, and to-day can place in the field an
artillery establishment slightly in excess of
Great Britain's, and of much more deadly
use. For all practical purposes there are
now but two forces in modern land warfare
—infantry and artillery. All other branches
are but sundries, so to speak. One remark-
able feature about the recent Balkan battles
was the close support of infantry with ar-
tillery, mostly mountain batteries. It was
rather a shock to the old school to find field
guns practically in the firing line with the
infantry. As for the Turks, they were
knocked endways by this kind of in-fighting.
The Bulgarians got the idea from the annual
manoeuvres of the German and French
armies prior to the war. Australia should
send some of its brighter young officers to
Europe to learn the science of war. They
should be in the Balkans at the present
time, along with the military repre-
sentatives of other nations. Meanwhile,
we might indent, say. five batteries of
the best French field guns, a parcel
of Vicar-Maxim’s latest machine-guns, and
a case of the world’s best military magazine
rifles. I believe in every nation making
its own guns, but if there’s going to be
slavish copying of another fellow’s type of
gun. let it be the best type. Of course, this
would be opposed to all the traditions of the
British War Office, and would naturally lead
piffling little tin-tack merchants and calico
jimmies in Australia to lay a charge of dis-
loyalty against Defence Minister
But that’s nothing to the charge that will be
laid against Australia unless something ol
the kind is done
Australia as she Could Be.
“Telemachus” on “Australia as she is”
(B. 2/1/’l3) inspires “Aquarius”:
Australia is the most arid of the continents Yet it
contains little desert. Arid countries are always rich
countries when watered. The. fertility of ar lf p„.
is due to a quality inherent in aridity itself. Pro-
fessor Hilgard found, as the result of more tha
1000 analvses of soils, that the soils of the and Ye
(United States) contain on an average, three
times as milch potash, six times as much
magnesia and 14 times as much lime as those
of g the East. The high percentage of fertilising
elements explains the superior productiveness of
semi-arid and arid territories. Auguste de Gasparin,
in discussing the great advantages of the use of water
in a warm climate, makes the following terse state-
ment: “Two units of humidity, multiplied by two of
heat gives four ; but four of heat by tour of humidity
gives 16. Such is, in fact, the rate of progression in
which are manifested the advantages produced by the
Association of these two essentials of vegetable
Kr Two-thirds of Australia is arid. It is a land of
few rivers, though it possesses the
known underground reservoir. But the value of the
artesian and sub-artesian supplies is very fairly recog-
nised and the underground reservoirs may now, there-
fore ’be left to take care of themselves The impera-
tive question of the day is the interception and utili-
sation of the surface waters, so that not one drop of
those which fall within the Murray basin, to start
with, mav be lost in the Southern Ocean.
The question of the water supply for a continent two-
thirds arid may be best approached by discussing the
potentialities of its largest streams. They are to.be
found in that, area known as the Murray basin, an
area larger than France and Germany combined with
aAnnnUHon of no more than a few hundred thou-
sands 3 as against a combined population of over 100
millions in the European area. The interior of Aus-
tralia cannot he attached to civilisation until this
territory is made water-famine proof, and thus turned
into a base for attacking the country further north
an The° r Murray basin is equal to one-seventh of the
total area of Australia, and no large portion of it is
unsuitable for the wants of man and beast. It in-
cludes the Murray, and the Murray s tributaries and
tributaries’ tributaries. It occupies one-sixth of N. S.
Wales an area of Queensland the size of Victoria,
one-half of Victoria and the south-eastern portion of
South Aus. The development of the potentialities of
this area is a national proposition. The water supply
of Australia means national life. Its neglect means
1903, after seven years drought, Australia was a
sand-blown wilderness, with half of its live stock
starved to death and its great plains white with
bleached bones. Man’s improvidence ! Man s cruelty .
T nek the Murray from its mouth to Echuca, the
DarlTn- toVaAgett, the Murrumbidgee to Hay. Thus
the billabongs and. the lakes would become permanent
reservoirs The 70 lakes along the Darling are natural
storages Cawndilla holds, when full, 17,196 millions
of cubic feet; Lake Menindie 16,700 million cubic
feet The flow from the latter, after it has been
filled bv flood waters, maintains navigation in the
Lower Darling for many months after it has ceased
higher up. Construct a weir at Talmalino, near
Albury, to hold up 11,000 million cubic feet of
water'; a weir at Bungowannah, with a mam offtake
channel to the Goulburn River weir, and thence to
flow to Waranga basin, and onward from there to
Brim to supply water for the southern Mallee, in
Victoria; construct another offtake from Bnngow-
annah to irrigate the country between the offtake and
the Edwards River, north of Deniliquin with branch
channels to Jerilderie, Conargo, Mnlwala and Denili-
nuin and thus command two million acres of the
finest land in the world. The Burrinjuck reservoir
and the weir at Narrandera, with the main offtakes
and branches, are already well under way, and under
careful management will be an invaluable object
lesson. At the head waters of the Lachlan River
construct a weir, and another at the head waters of
the Macquarie River, near Bathurst. Go on weiring
until the work of conserving every drop of the rain-
fall is done. That is the way to reclaim one-seventh
of Australia from water famine, and there is no other
way. By that method 31 millions of acres in the
Wagga district, of reddish loam, can be irrigated,
and nearly 10 million acres in the Southern Riverina
can be turned into lucerne paddocks to provide fodder
for the silo.
When all this is done the base will be there. Then
tackle the Cooper Creek basin, and solve the mysteries
associated with the Diamantina and the Barcoo and
Lake Eyre and its once glorious gardens and forests,
where roamed the mammoth mammalia, and where
lofty eucalvpts rose through the gloom of dense under-
growth to be the dwelling-places of the Kadimakara,
who feared the terrors of the earth.
Art, Nudity and Some Notions.
The wisdom of “F. J. 8.” :
“S.T.S.”: (B. 21/1/T3) says that George Lam-
bert’s 1000 guineas, collected from a Russian prince
for “The Man with the Mask,” were earned primarily
by the audacious handling of the nudes in the pic-
ture. Doesn’t that say everything? Art is getting
feeble and groggy on its legs, because our artists do
not know how anything looks without its stays. If
an artist’s only model is his wife, so much the worse
for him ; it is like a “star” always permitting his
jealous wife (invariably a third-rate actress) to play
all the leading lady rSles. There are, of course,
exceptions. Millet’s wife must have been one such.
I like that anecdote about Madame and her artist
husband. Millet compelled his wife (he could
afford no other model) to wear the same shirt for an
uncomfortably long time —not to paint the dirt, as
his early critics would have the world believe, but
that the rough linen should simplify its folds and
take the form of the body, that he might give a
fresher and stronger accent to those qualities he so
loved, the garment becoming, as it were, a part of
the body, and expressing, as he said, even more than
the nude, the larger and simpler forms of Nature.
Millet was right, but the nude is better. Accord-
ing to Rodin’s recently-published opinions on art,
the artist cannot have enough of direct impressions
from living, nude bodies. In his studio he has
always some half-dozen or more nude models walking
about, and when he notes a pose which appeals to
the artist in him, he arrests it, and models like a
fury. In default of other, the Boxing Stadium is a
capital studio. What finer sight on earth than two
living, throbbing organisms like Midwood and Bal-
zac in strenuous muscular antagonism! I was pleased
to see Australia’s greatest artist in line studying the
nude at the Stadium the other night. Folks may look
at pictures till the cows hop out of the canvas, but
that won’t make them artistic. The art instinct is
to be got only by making art a national matter.
Pictures, statues, buildings, fountains, gardens—open,
free, everywhere. Surround the nation with works
of the best art, and they will become art critics in
time, almost, but not quite, as good as an ordinary
French chiffonier, for there is something in the
French nature which makes for art, and there is
something in the British nature which doesn’t. Per-
hans it is our pre-mid-Victorianism. Anyhow, we’ve
had it quite a while. And never do what you don’t want
to do simply because it is supposed to make for
culture. Just look at our Town Hall fashionable
symphony concerts. If Dore were in want of faces
to put into his studies of lost souls in Dante’s
“Inferno,” where could he find more useful models?
Thev are listening, say. to Bach’s Symphony in G
Maior, and thev sit like a party in a parlor, all
silent and all damned. If vou could only see their
little personalities in the nude, you would never need
to visit the Chamber of Horrors in a waxworks exhibi-
tion.
The North Melbourne gravitation goods-
yard trouble has got the Vic. railway heads
down, and at present they can scarcely speak
civilly to anyone who mentions the matter.
The bother began when the Department de-
cided to plant its sorting-yard and the neces-
sary embankment on the filled-in bed of the
Moonee Ponds Creek, which is merely allu-
vial slush, and very soft slush at that.. As
fast as clay and gravel were carted thither
and tipped on the spot where the embank-
ment was wanted, it sank into the ooze ; but
the Department thought that if it kept, on
dumping enough it must some day get a little
bit of solid ground. But it miscalculated.
There is no certainty that if it humped Kos-
ciusko down by the drayload it would get
what it wants, because as fast as the soil is
tipped out the ooze disperses and makes room
for more carted stuff to spread out. Already
the banks of the Moonee Creek have been
affected, and that occasionally turbulent riv-
ulet may at any time spread over the sur-
rounding country. Near Dynon-road an
acre of what was lately a swamp has been
raised nearly 12ft. This is all right so far.
but there is no guarantee that things will
stav as they are; the patch may rise to a
peak or it may slop all over the place, dam
back the Moonee Creek and the adjacent
Saltwater River, turn Flemington racecourse
into a lake, and send Footscray under the
bay. The Department has of late been hump-
ing mullock from the Caulfield duplication
works —which is a long way to carry dirt —
and it has several more supplies to fall back
on ; but it has already spent about £150,000
on the job, and has got so little to show for it
that it is making “other arrangements.” It is
now spending £90,000 on similar gravitation
yards further up the Northern line, at Tot-
tenham, to “relieve the pressure” on the
North Melbourne yards —when it gets them.
Tottenham is mostly blue metal, so there is
little fear of subsidence there, whatever else
may happen.
♦
When the great trouble comes Australia
and Maoriland will have to pull together or
hang together, and the sooner they co-ordin-
ate their arrangements the better. But they
won’t do it so long as they don’t know one
another better and take a more neighborly
interest in each other’s happenings. The
default is mainly on the Australian side.
The Maorilander who. comes to the Common-
wealth for a change pr on business, kicks
like a regiment of mules at the lack of news
from God’s Own Country in the dailies.
Tom Mills —the M.L. pressman who is
president of the Australasian Country Press
Association —told the latter body the other
dav. in Sydney, that Australian country
newspaper men didn’t know “the first. thing
about news gathering and the distribution
thereof; and he heaved a verbal brick at the
metropolitan press concerning its lack of
neighborly and news interest in M.L. A.
S. Biss, a Wellington business man, is a
still later kicker. He has just got back home
from Sydney, and has unloaded his mind to
a reporter about the news the papers there
do not print. Moreover, he makes charges
which no self-respecting daily paper should
take lying down. Says lie :
I am given to understand that a good deal of news
is forwarded, but a good deal of it is never printed.
As a matter of fact, I am inclined to think that they
do not want to give Maoriland any publicity. What
is always published, however, are the reports about
there being heavy weather on the coast.
The M.L. Press Association gathers in half
a column of Australian news daily for its
papers; and there won’t be much love lost
for Australia on the part of the Maorilander
until the Commonwealth papers reciprocate.

COES
A Case Where Silence isn’t Golden.
Thebe is a type of Australian who seethes
with indignation when references are made
to the menace of oversea nations —particu-
larly if the nations are yellow or gamboge.
They would have the Commonwealth regard
the foreigner as a beneficent being who
spends all his waking hours manufacturing
cheap articles for Australians to import,
with never a thought, so long as he is left
unmolested, of playing the barbarian’s sorry
rdle. The cheerless fact is, the alien, and
particularly the colored alien, is far from
being the well-disposed and harmless charac-
ter that the typical importer pictures him.
Frequently he is shifty and unscrupulous,
and his eye is directed to the main chance
with tireless assiduity. Take the follow-
ing, for examnle, from the Yorodztj, a Tokio
journal, which has lately been urging the
advisability of Japan throwing over its asso-
ciation with Great Britain, and concluding
an alliance with Germany :
We Japanese do not hesitate to declare that Japan’s
interests lie in the partition of Great Britain and
her colonies. By the establishment of an alliance
between Germany and Japan the latter may take
possession of Australia, while the former may es-
tablish a protectorate over the various countries
and islands in the South Pacific. Russia will in
future make a descent upon Persia, and it is a fore-
gone conclusion that Germany will absorb the
Netherlands whenever a unique opportunitv presents
itself. Having enemies on all sides, Great Britain,
which has no intention to fight, will thus be placed
m a helpless condition. Certain it is that in that
event the Transvaal would declare for independence,
Spain would take Gibraltar, the United States annex
Canada, while France may once again become the
protector of Egypt. If things come to such a pas*,
the two-Power standard navy of Great Britain will
naturally become a useless weapon.
The indent-agent variety of patriot would
argue that such disclosures of opinion should
be civilly disregarded by the press of Aus-
tralia. In his opinion the people ought not
to be told that there is a powerful nation,
adjacent to their homes, whereof a section—
and a fairly cultivated and extensive section
at that—is in favor of disregarding its most
sacred treaty obligations at the slightest
prospect of material gain. The Bulletin
disagrees with .the indent-agent patriot. In
its opinion there is little point in sparing the
feelings of the foreigner at the expense of
the badly-needejd enlightenment of one’s own
fellow-countryman. That way lies the very
calamity which has caused us to be the in-
adequately defended people we are. For
years the “right-thinking” classes have been
repeating blithely that Australia has nothing
to fear from the invader, since Britain’s
navy is impregnable, and since, anyhow, the
foreigner is far too kindly and conscientious
to think of doing this country any damage.
Up till quite recently scores of these people
actually argued that Australia wasn’t worth
taking, and therefore not worth defending.
That delusion has been dispelled to some ex-
tent. Our vast heritage is no longer guarded
by means of an upraised umbrella, so to
sneak, but with a modest-sized meat-chopper.
We have an army that will be formidable
when it grows up, and a navy that should be
effective when it materialises. But there
are people who don’t want the army to grow
up or the navy to materialise. Therefore we
thank the Yorodzu for putting the matter
so plainly. Nothing more should be needed
to satisfy the Commonwealth that it hasn’t
started its Defence preparations a minute
too soon, and that it will be mad if it eases
un in them for a moment, and almost equ-
ally demented if it doesn’t rather push for-
ward with its preparations to the utmost of
its financial capacity.
It is cabled that the Indian Government
has suspended opium sales owing to the
accumulation of stocks in China; also that
the Chinese Republic shows signs of want-
ihg to repudiate the “opium treaty” with
England, and that the British Minister at
Pekin has warned the person with the lately-
docked pig-tail that if he doesn’t mind what
he is about the thing will have to be reported
in London. The whole business is the dead
limit of national infamy. The Indian opium
traffic was once the monopoly of the Great
Mogul, who was just the sort of person to
run an injurious trade of the kind. Clive
won it for the East India Co. at the battle
of Plassey, and the fat co. worked it for all
it was worth. Chinese Governments, recog-
nising the drug as bad for their subjects,
from time to time prohibited its use and im-
portation, and Anglo-Indian Fat had to con-
duct a contraband trade for about half a
century. Then the Chinese authorities got
a*gry and sent a person called Lin to de-
stroy as much of the stuff as he could find.
Lin did the job with Chinese thoroughness
and made an end of about £2,000,000 worth.
Still the British ships smuggled the iniquity
in, aDd the injuries to smugglers caught red-
handed caused Britain to go to war. As
China had neglected to keep any sort of De-
fence force to uphold its objection to the
destructive evil, it had to sit down licked
and buy all the opium India liked to send
along. Naturally, also, the Chinese began
to grow the stuff themselves, and all the
efforts of Chinese statesmen to suppress the
bad habits of their countrymen were of no
use in face of the British determination to
collect the cash which the bad habits were
worth to India. This sort of thing went on
until the Americans got the Philippines and
joined with the Chow authorities to suppress
the vice. At last in 1907 Britain made an
offer to reduce the export from India by
gradual withdrawals from the market each
year until 1910, provided China didn’t raise
a supply of the stuff or get it anywhere else.
China agreed, and the market price of
opium rose so much that India was draw-
ing almost as much revenue from the re-
duced output as it had drawn in former
times from the contraband trade. Now
China begins to think that the British agree-
ment is a little too good for the foreigner—
and England once more protests. But the
twentieth century is alleged to have arrived,
and the new China knows that Britain will
not, and dare not, enforce with cannon the
demand that the Chinese people shall destroy
themselves with a noxious drug to swell the
Indian revenues.

Faust is still behaving in a thoroughly
ungentlemanly way at Sydney Theatre
Royal, and, thank Heavens, meeting with
the due punishment of eternal damnation.
Now that the clergy are being allowed into
so many of our theatres on the
object being to get from these pious dead-
heads an endorsement of the high moral
purpose of the show—the writer is
emboldened to weigh in with his little
psean of holy praise of “Faust.” After
witnessing it he resolved definitely and
finally not to sell his soul to the Devil. One
of the conditions of any bargain of the sort
is, plainly, that Beelzebub shall attend the
vendor, in the absurd garments of the nether
world, at all subsequent revels. Rather than
be humiliated by such a companion, the
writer would live and die a Wowser.

It was the expressed intention of Allen
Doone to give a fortnight to “The Parish
Priest’s” tame morality mission at Sydney
Palace Theatre, but trade has been so brisk
that the evangel has been extended at least
another week. It seems to be the nature of
Sydney, to hunt for novelty even if it lead
in the direction of the Ten Commandments.

“The Monk and the Woman” continues to
be a Scandal at the Adelphi, Sydney, or a
Great Moral Lesson, according to the point
of view. One thing is certain —it is a great
financial success; and, in an age of moral
doubt and mental uncertainty, profits cover
a multitude of qualms.
“My Fancy” is not, as might be suspected,
the title of Taylor and Arnold’s latest rag-
time song, or Claire Romaine’s newest room-
wanner, but the nom-de-hop of the newest
Tivoli dancer; and The Bulletin offers no
opposition when the management books her
as the “greatest sand- and soft-shoe dancer
of the age.” She is billed in awe as having
appeared at a Royal Command performance
in London, and she is quite capable of giving
George Rex his money’s worth. Minnie
Kauffman, the pretty trick cyclist, and
Chinko, the youthful juggler, are putting in
a farewell season. The rest of the pro-
gramme hasn’t altered much. Next week the
Ratty Frank troupe of ground acrobats will
begin their eely business.

“The Count of Monte Christo,” a tabloid
version of Dumas’ novel, took 60 minutes
to unwind its three reels at the Crystal
Palace during its stay. It is rather lengthy,
but the film is a good one, and follows the
yarn as closely as the camera can. The hero’s
missions to Napoleon at Elba, his imprison-
ment and his escape to become owner of the
Island of Monte Cristo, his subsequent re-
turn home and the disposal, one by
one, of his haters —it is all very well worked
out. “Heredity,” another of the endless
Indian yarns, was a good second. “The Plot
That Failed,” a Labor v. Capital yarn, is
booked for the tail-end of the week.

When the moving-picture colonel puts a
good detective yarn into the field, he can
generally be sure of victory; and West’s
knew it when they unwound “Nick Winter
and the Stolen Favorite,” at the Glaciarium
this week. Nick is another of the very
numerous made-to-order detectives who wan-
der through about 3000 feet of film, without
doing as much as O’Callaghan’s sleuths, and
then wake up during the last few flicks and
win by a neck. In this case a gang makes
use of the remarkable likeness of one of its
members to Nicholas W. to steal Whirlwind,
the favorite for the Grand Prix of 1936, or
somewhere. If the film had been 500 ft.
shorter the gang would have made a good
job of it, but the extra distance upset the
pot, and Winter, Esq., got another rise in
consequence. Next week “Mimosa Fan,” a
Jap yarn, will be flicked.
Hugh Lloyd is earning godfr money and
delighting National Amphitheatre patrons
by bounding madly upon a rope. Some day
he will inadvertently bound off the rope and
break his neck, and then those who were for-
tunate enough to be present at the tragedy
will feel that they have not only got their
money’s worth, but a bit over. The public’s
love of danger (the other fellow’s danger)
makes countless vaudevillians risk their
glittering lives. John Fuller, tenor, is still
causing the welkin to ring with his plain-
tive cries, and Zif, Lyla Thompson and
Pedrini help to strengthen a fairly powerful
bill.

“Puss in Boots,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), continues to be broad-based upon
the people’s will, like numerous other anci-
ent customs; and the time for hoisting the
standard of revolt, and leading the forces of
common sense against he-dame§, she-boys,
gollywogs and wicked barons is'iibt yet quite
at hand. The sun of civilisation has not
ripened the time on
both sides, so to speak.
A marionette show,

that encouraged crime
among the infant
classes, but a good
moral lesson, adapted
to the Wowser con-
science, terminating
in the capture and
conviction of the clown
by the police, on infor-
mation received re-
garding a wooden leg
of mutton and a string
of rag sausages. Mean-
while, the grown-up public, or most of it, hangs
on the idea that a panto is hallowed by old
associations ; and as long as the public thus
remains suspended, the duty of ,T. C. Wil-
liamson, Ltd., is to pull its leg. (Further
apologies for “Puss in Boots” will be offered
as occasion requires.)
At the Royal the color of Cleopatra’s hair
is still making matter for good advt. dis-
cussion in the daily press; also, her last
night of Egyptian sovereignty is as gaudy as
ever, and the red-and-purple harmonies of
the scene in Caesar’s room strike the eye
with undiminished force. The fire of dis-
cussion re Cleo’s auburn tresses is now burn-
ing low. by the way, so Miss Brayton might
add fuel bv presenting herself in another
wig. The Serpent of Old Nile was remark-
able for infinite variety, and probably she
changed the color and dressing of her hair
between the times when Antony tore himself
away from her coils, andi to the
palace where his pleasure lay. The question
invites Shakspearian controversy.
These are the last nights of “The Oirl of

Melbourne Princess’s again shelters “The
P>ad Girl of the Family,” the bedroom play
whose rare moments of sanity are like the
feeble glimmer of a vesta in a twilight
world. There is little to provoke enthusiasm
in the resurrection, though Hilliard Vox's
chaste rendering of the villain’s part is a
matter for ashamed applause. As Harry
Gordon, Vox illuses the Bad Girl with the
starched effrontery of the perfect swell, and
his chase of the chick of the foolish Lord
Erskine, whom his pa holds deep in the
financial soup, is equally sinister, but well-
behaved. Lieutenant Marsh, R.N., who
loves Gladys Erskine in the blue-and-gold
upholstery of the Bulldog Navy, is our old
acquaintance Robert Inman, who, having
fitted his head with a flaming thatch, might
stand for a bit of bushfire, P. V. Scully
enacts Lord Erskine, and J. P. O’Neill, as
“Shylock” Gordon in earnest pursuit of his
pound of lamb, makes a brave attempt to
raise the ghost of the late John F. Sheridan
and put it into a pair of outrageous check
pants. Miss Elwyn Harvey is a pleasing
ingenue as Gladys Erskine, and Miss Ada
Guildford as the Worst Girl in the Collec-
tion tries hard to be that boshter superla-
tive. Miss Buckley and the gramaphonic
D’Arcy Ivelway hold the stage, and occa-
sionally the audience* as the comic relief,
Miss Buckley sporting glad rags, as usual,
and insisting that she is the entertainment.
Of the latest explorer:—
Professor Baldwin Spencer’s lecture on the North-
ern Territory might have been a mere picture show
for all that 50 per cent, of the crowded audience in
Melbourne Town Hall could hear of his utterances.
Admission was free; therefore, nobody felt justified
in exhorting the lecturer to speak up. When he was
most audible he sounded like a special pleader for the
Federal Government, whose agent he is. Everything
in the Government’s management of the Territorv is
beyond criticism, from Spencer’s point of view. Away
from the coast the climate is good; in fact, it is
delightful and invigorating for four months of the
year. Its drawbacks have been overstated. There is
no urgent necessity that the Professor can see for
the Government to lure settlers to this land of pro-
mise with greater inducements than have thus far
failed to attract them. The only question that wor-
ries Spencer, seemingly, is how the aborigines can be
fully protected and maintained in their native use-
lessness. He doesn’t even dream of a dav when the
blacks shall have duly disappeared under the in-
fluences of civilisation, and the North shall be a fully
protected portion of White Australia. Statistician
Kmbbs estimates the happy heathen population at
20,000. Spencer guesses 40,000.
Miss Renee, a pleasing lady who performs
on various musical instruments, is the newest
comer at the Opera House. Nella Webb,
the diseuse, is diseuseing as before; the
Italian tenor warbles soulfully with a vermi-
celli accent: Bluett sings his customary
songs of Araby ; and Whitburn's black Aus-
trahan humor takes the floor at 8.45 p.m
Ihe 50-minutes turn of De Biere is still most
puzzling in its tied-thumbs trick, and most
elaborately staged in “The Sculptor's

dream, or what the Bevil has to do with it at
all: but the other incidental mysteries are
more easily fathomed.
The Smart Set people are still in the same

“Bobby’s Father” has been keeping public
attention in custody at Spencer’s Olympia,
Melbourne. Bobby’s parent is a cracksman
of the deepest scowl; but under the influence
of Robert, who interrupts him at a mid-
night job, he jettisons his instruments of
felony and dedicates his future to pious pur-
suits. A similar tale of reformation was
related in “Tim” : but Tim becomes a ruly
member of society through sheer starvation,
inasmuch as his papa dies and he has to get
work in order to fill up the gap in his pro-
vision department. “Willie’s Ticker” was

better, and Pathg’s Gazette showed George

Short, but very pointed, is the inscription
which the relatives of St. Clair Stone, who
was killed at Mt. Lyell on October 21, have
placed on his tombstone at Queenstown
(Tas.) : “A human life sacrificed on the
altar of dividends.” It sounds pretty raw
when it is put that*fway ; but the statement
is quite true when applied to most fatal
mining accidents. There are very few that
are not preventable—it is simply a matter of
spending money on the prevention.
The Liberals don’t know what to do about
Deakin’s Ballarat seat in the Reps. Deakin
himself was a very doubtful winner; and
any other man the Liberals have in the bag
is an almost certain loser against the Labor
nominee, McGrath, M.L.A. Just at present
the tempter is whispering in the ear of Pea-
cock, also M.L.A. But Peacock has a fairly
safe seat in the Assembly, and some hopes
of taking Peter Mcßride’s place at the Mines
Department, when the present Minister goes
to London as Agent-General, vice Taverner ;
and the owner of the laugh isn’t enthusiastic
about the exchange. A certain seat and a
probable portfolio, even among the insects,
look much better than a pretty certain wal-
loping in an ineffectual attempt to get among
the lions.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The Nellie Mortyne benefit at Melb. Bijou is now
announced as a matinge show, and the mixed pro-
gramme, arranged by Hugh Buckler, should prove a
bonza of the matinee kind. The Oscar Asche Co
will be represented ; the Panto, supplies some items;
the Princess s Go. gives a hand; and Beatrice Day is
to stage an act of “Peter’s Mother,” with herself
in a strong cast. Vaudeville turns from the Opera
House and Gaiety include De Biere and Nella Webb *
and Walter Kirby w wilL be among the songsters. A
lot of people who have abandoned the habit of going
to the Bi.iou should be attracted to the pretty little
house on this special occasion.
“Mdb”; Garnet Walch began in Hobart, and
ended in Melb., • but was emphatically a Sydney
mhn. In a decade there he got about 40 of his
pieces upon the stage. This was unparalleled suc-
cess for an Australian. His best was .the extrava-
ganza of Trookulentos,” which had more vogue than
anything on the boards from an Australian pen ex-
cept “Robbery Under Arms.” Reading some of
Garnet s theatrical filigree and svllabub, I have
found the literary quality high. Taking a different
line, he equalled the almost peerless Boueicault in
good, workaday stage dialogue. Compare Walch’s
pantomimes with Hickory Wood’s! All thoroughly
well-written rhyme, quite up to such bygone glories
as the verses of H. J. Byron, the Broughs,
and Burnand. A pity Walch ever came to
Melbourne. He got right out of his swim
there, and two-thirds of his working life was
comparatively lost. Though a fish out of water as'
sec. of Melbourne Athenaeum, he nevertheless
galvanised it with a prodigious rush of about 150
new members. Then he practically had to go.
Even less of a success was the weekly Town Talk,
produced by the clever but ill-assorted trio, Walch,
Whitworth and Conway.
“Ami”: I recall Unie Russell, Chia’s bride, in two
stage performances. The first was as Parthenia, in
“Ingomar:” The .others who have played that part
in Melbourne have been bulky women, such as
Nance O’Neil, who was seen both with Plimmer and
Glendinning as Ingomar—a part Rignold liked, but
did not find much chance of acting. The slight
Kingston gracefully resigned it to Plimmer. Brooke
and Sullivan acted Ingomar with the solid Mrs.
Heir as Parthenia. Creswick did it in Sydney and
Melbourne .with his daughter-in-law, Helen Ashton, as
Parthenia. She was another of the rather-too-large.
But when the airy fairy, little Unie Russell, stepped
into it, what a beautiful embodiment! Her other
cbnspicuoqs part was Ida Ingot in “David Garrick.”
It obliterated the others—not many—from my mem-
ory. Even Essie Jenyns could not realise the appear-
ance so well. Julius Knight was the Garrick, glori-
ously chivalrous, and very subdued in the drinkv
scenes. I never saw him so thoroughly en rapport
with the leading lady, and I think he will say, “Aye,
that’s so! ” What a picture it was when he led out
the worshipping Unie at the end of the first act!
Oscar Asche has hones of hitting London with his
Australian production of “Antony and Cleopatra.” It
differs widely from Beerbohm Tree’s arrangement,
and will probably be preferred by Bardolaters, if
they can accept the un-Roman Oscar as a possible
Antony. Tree sought excuses for spectacle outside
the action of the play. Thus he introduced Cleopatra
in her barge—the golden-pooped barge she sat in
when she went to cultivate Antony’s acquaintance,
though their acquaintance had ripened into cuddle
long before the outset of Shakspeare’s play.
“The Chee-ild”: A parting word to “C. Ockney”
in this one-act play controversy. He now admits (B.
2/1/’ 13) that seven of the London theatres in the
fashionable quarter were, at latest, playing one-act
pieces as curtain-raisers, and four others were utilis-
ing entertainers for the same purpose. But when
“C. 0.” proceeds to say that the remaining 16
theatres give no preliminary canter of any kind, isn’t
it a little brassy in face of the fact that the great
majority of those 16 are running musical comedies,
musical plays, Shakspeare, Shaw (Little Theatre),
spectacular shows and (once more) long plays to none
of which does anyone ever expebt or get a “raiser” ?
Let me, in a last line, return to my original point.
Even “The Quaints,” “Jokers,” “Giddygoats,” etc.,
are curtain-raisers of a sort. Do we get even them,
much less the one-act play, as a sort of sherry to
the brief feed of a two-hours-long comedy?
Ivy Ray, • once chorus and understudy in the
J. C. Williamson cos a has “struck it” in London.
When she left Sydney 18 months ago she dropped
into “principal girl” work at Liverpool panto.
After this she assisted Bert Gilbert in a sketch
at London Colosseum; Then this happened (Stage,
Oct. 31) : —“Bert Gilbert lost his voice, and his
sketch, ‘The Ticket Collector,’ was off the bill on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. However, one’s loss
is another’s gain, and Miss Ivy Ray, his clever and
dainty partner, put on a singing and monologue act,
and held the stage for 14 minutes, charming all
present with her personality and fine voice. The
management was so satisfied with results that it
paid the full week’s salary—in itself sufficient proof
of Miss* Ray’s success.”
Tt is time that Australia’s daily press began to
nave a soul above the gratuitous advertising of thea-
tncal wares, especially the inferior wares that usually
get the largest amount of special encouragement. In
Sydney and in Melbourne lately the morning papers
published a number of foolish letters, calculated to
rvi ',“ e interests of an absurd Marlowdrama. Then
the Melbourne press admitted a less unpardonable dis-
cussion re the color of Cleopatra’s hair, a red-wigged
Cleo. being on view at the local Royal. After that
came the shocking outrage on public intelligence of
a reported speech by Allen Doone protesting against
the behavior of some spectators who thought his
sentimental Irish drama was absurd nonsense. The
intelligent section of the public knows that Doone’s
dramas are piffle, and doesn’t want to be told how
the showman assured the audience that the piffle had
v* cler Ky men two denominations to tears.
. Yet the report of Doone’s self-advertisement was
seized by Melbourne Argus as an excuse for a lead-
ing article, drawing attention to Doone’s tendency
to strive for a free ad.
~r , Why, in an English dramatic version of
i! mist (or an English operatic version, for that
matter), should Margaret be called Marguerite? It’s
rl lf J h ? )T ere a “ fair daisy.” Since Gounod and
his librettist I renchified Goethe’s German damsel, the
Lnglish.have nearly always called her Marguerite,
whether it s opera, drama or burlesque. They might
be either English or German.
Miss Henrietta Watson was a charming Glory
Quayle in Australia years ago. Since then she has
made a big name in London, mostly in the literary
and soulful drama, in the parts of various ladies
no longer quite young. But one would hardly have
expected, her to “look lovely in a fair wig as Nell
T 1 alongside of Gertie Millar and other
postcard beauties—in a tableau. That, however, is
what she is credited with doing last month.

llwell Star Dramatic Co., at Pinafore, somewhere
towards the end of last century. k Other per-
formances were bad in patches; the Star Dramatic
Co. s was all bad, and was saved from monotony
only by reason of the fact that some characters
were worse than others. The audience displaved that
forbearance which is no virtue up to Act 11., Scene 2,
and then it broke loose, and began to hit up the Star
Dramatic Co. The stalls threw derision, and every-
thing else handy. The miners in the shilling seats,
many of whom were going on night shift after the
show, threw their cribs. One enthusiast threw his
boots. It was at this point that the paternal Capulet
came to the floats, full of bitterness, glowering a
deadly glower. “Look here, you people,” he expostu-
lated, we didn’t write this play, you know.”

“N.L.”: Maud Hobson, now departed from the
stage of life, came to Australia with the George
Edwardes Co., which opened at Melbourne Princess’s
during the Easter of 1895. For this country the
co. marked the change from burlesque to musical
comedy. Chief features of that change were the
disuse of the pun and the wearing ,of modern dress'

instead of tights. Not
to shock the Johnnies
too much, however,
glimpses of leg were still
occasionally given. “In
Town,” for instance, saw
Maud Hobson as prin-
cipal boy of the Am-
biguity Theatre, and in
a greenroom scene she
and others appeared
minus skirts. Grace Pal-
otta was a slim vision
in pale blue and an ac-
cent. “A Gaiety Girl”
also had a scene show-
ing tights, alleged to be
bathing costumes. “The
Shop Girl” and “Gentle-
man Joe” Were the other
productions. Dec i m a
Moore was leading
woman. Blanche Massey
(whom one remembers
vaguely as winning a
beauty prize at a Melb.
Exhibition charity carni-
val, with Palotta scor-
ing for popularity) ful-
filled her mission by
drooping prettily about
the stage; and Florence
Lloyd’s build and style
scored best in two boy
parts. Massive Harry
Monkhouse did the chief
comedying in “A Gaiety
Girl,” and “The Shop
Girl,” and the spry
Louis Bradfield in the
other plays. Two of
Claude Bantock’s broth-
ers gave a hand—Leed-
ham in character parts,
and . Granville as musical
director. Though the
musical comedies i m-'
proved in some ways on
burlesque, they were
also responsible for the
sad fact that Charles
. _ Ryley, once the admired
baritone of Gilbert and Sullivan opera, was set to
sing such piffle as “Tommy Atkins.” Not being a
singer, Maud Hobson seemed in some narts to have
little to do, but she could do that well enough, and
look handsome into the bargain. Come to think of it,
looking handsome was her chief part.
“Mary Widder”: Apropos Stoll’s decision not to
permit his hirelings to dig at supposedly unpopular
politicians, etc., in his London music-halls. J. C.
Williamson might follow Stoll’s lead to advantage.
F’rinstance, never was a good song more nearly
spoiled than “Tact,” now being sung in “Floro-
dora” by Grace Palotta. What’s doing the damage
is three or four twaddlesome verses about the “evic-
tion,” Speaker Willis and the baby bonus. If we
want to, we can read all this nonsense six days a
week in the S. M. Herald ; and those of us who
don’t want it see no reason why we should have it
hurled at us in Her Majesty’s by a co. which is
supposed to be catering for our amusement. I
enclose one ha’penny towards buying a blue pencil
for J.C.W.
“Didn’t know he had a brother,” a good many
Australians no doubt said when they read of t' e
suicide in London, at 48, of William .Tohn Jones,
a 13-years-younger brother of Henry Arthur. There
was reason for the ignorance, as W. .1. Jones had
taken the name of Sylvanus Dauncey for his work
as dramatist and touring manager. (The father of
the playwrights was Sylvanus Jones, farmer.) Wil-
liam had his thoughts turned towards drama by the
success of Henry Arthur, whose “Clerical Error”
was produced in 1870. The big hit of “The Silver
King” came in 1882. Three years later Jones minor
began, at 21, with “A Divided Duty,” otherwise
known as “A Month after Date.” “Charity’s Cloak,”
“The Reckoning,” and “Love at Home,” an adapta-
tion, were all staged in 1891. With George D.
Day he was responsible in 1898 for “Bilbery of Til-
bury” and “Campano, or The Wandering Minstrel.”
His nervous breakdown, he said himself, was oae to
the worries of London management after the com-
parative ease of the provinces.
On Boxing Night, the largest theatre in Maoriland
was opened at Wellington. It was constructed to
the order of the Fuller firm to seat 2355 people.
Primarily, the intention is to use it as a picture
theatre, but it has been fully appointed for almost
any class of show. The stage is 80ft. in width
by 40ft,. deep; there are 12 boxes (seat 72), stalls
(seat 933), dress circle (seat 350), and upper circle
(seat 1000).
“Private Boxer”: Those erratic and perverse
mummers! I noted, with pain, in a Sunday paper
recently, a par. in which the writer alluded to the
curious fact that Gilbert Parker’s dialogue in his
“Faust” was written in blank verse, but that in
the mouths of the actors it sounded like prose.
What is the use of being a poet-playwright these
times? I once knew a playwright (he wrote panto-
mimes) who had the opposite experience. To ex-
plain my meaning I have asked his permission to
reproduce a nonsense-rhyme he perpetrated on the
subject:—
A clever young author (so I’m
Informed) wrote a Grand Pantomime;
His “book” was in prose,
But the pros, (goodness knows
How they did it) all spoke it in rhyme.
“C.0.M.” : Now that the Sydney picture show com-
bine is practically complete, and the firms which
made capital out of their independence have been
brought into line, the suburban shows are likely to
be squeezed out in large numbers, and the suburban
crowds forced to come into town for their jigger-
graph entertainment. But will the crowds come in ?
They have gone to the local shows because the cheap
amusement was at their door. Were these shows made
impossible along their present lines, through the
charge for the use of films being put up enormously,
cheap vaudeville performances would probably replace
them, to the great loss of the combine. Pictures in
and of themselves are not a tremendously strong at-
traction. The public mostly finds in watching them
a cheap and pleasant mode of killing time. Nobody
is going to pay theatre prices for the best of them,
and nobody is going to make long and frequent jour-
neys from the suburbs to see them. Moreover, when
the Combine is well on its feet, the Referendum pro-
posals will be carried, and then everybody connected
with the proposed monopoly will have to pay a fine,
and the organisation will be smashed up and the
names of a iot of proprietors of jiggergraphs will be
Mud. And to be called Mud in such a connection
may not be at all a good advt.
Barton’s Circus, now touring Maoriland, has got
the steel-nerved man, although he is not advertised
as such. The other day the show was aboard ship,
when a leopard got loose, and during the subsequent
proceedings the man (a performer, appropriately
named Tackles) put in a piece of unrehearsed work
that would have made a star-animal turn look insig-
nificant by comparison. The leopard started the en-
tertainment by killing two baboons, and while he
was being driven off he got clear on the deck with
a long neck-chain dangling. Tackles grabbed the
chain, and, throwing his arms round the beast, em-,
braced him like a long-lost lover, yelling meanwhile
for help. The leopard cursed, spat, and tore with
his plaws at his assailant’s throat and body, but the,
man hugged close, while half a dozen perspiring i
circus hands bashed the great cat into insensibility •
with tent pegs and other emergency weapons. Theni
he was hurled into his cage, and the man with the
iron nerves retired to pull himself together with i
sticking plaster.
“The Oldest”: Apropos the Holloways (B. 9/1/T3).
This writer knew Papa Deorwyn, grandfather of
Beatrice Holloway, when under another name he was
doing well in commercial life in the ’so’s and ’6o’s
in Melbourne. It was boom-time in “Penny Read-
ings” when the mother of Beatrice made her debut, 1
a mere child, as a reciter. The “readings” were in
the Fitzroy Court House. She was “Little Alice”
then. Papa used to recite long pieces. “The May
Queen,” “Horatius,” and such-like. Papa was open-
handed, and trouble came in his business ; so he faced
the footlights again—-he had been an actor in early
life. Mrs. Deorwyn, a fine woman, died only a
couple of years ago, aged 84 or thereabout.
“The Melbourne and Country Directory,”
published by Sands and McDougall, continues
to grow ; it has put on 78 pages since last
year. There are now more than 1000 pages
in the alphabetical section alone, and rural
industries (apart from “country trades”)
run into 175 pages. As a source of informa-
tion the red-covered product of Sands and
Mac is invaluable.
The reverence for the naval Johnnie which
is supposed to fill the mercantile marine
received a shock at the disclosures in the
matter of H.M.S. Torch. This vessel, which
left Australia for England during last year,
was in such an unseaworthy condition that,
had an ordinary shellback taken it out as
a merchant ship, he would have had a lively
chance of standing a charge in a criminal
court, according to the provisions of the
Merchant Shipping Act. Admiralty investi-
gations showed that the Torch had not
undergone a proper survey of its hull-
plating for seven years before leaving on the
12,000 miles voyage. A steam lighter bound
from Garden Island to Pyrmont would get
better attention than that. The British
Parliament has been told that the naval
dockyard officials in Australia have incurred
the haughty displeasure of the Lords of the
Admiralty, and, considering the. casual risk
of the lives of the ship’s crew, that seems
the least that could be expected.
PLAYING HELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yes, Rrown was very gav
That ni.ir'.-o when we met;
His wife had gone away
A month or two to stay.
“I'll shake things up, you bet!”
He giggled. “Eh? Well, well!
Ihey’re all right, married joys,
But still—‘Boys will be boys.’
I reckon I’ll play hell!”
I met Brown yesterday ;
That sober, married hack
Was looking far from gay;
At home he could not stay.
“I wish my wife were back,”
He grumbled. Then he fell
To cursing loneliness.
I pitied his distress;
I said, “Why not play hell?”
Brown looked me in the eye—•
His glance was serpent-cold—
A sidelong look and sly;
He yearned to tell a lie—
A lie immense and bold.
I saw his bosom swell;
I guessed the ghastly truth ;
He’d lost the art of youth —-
The art of “playing hell!”

The Bulletin takes back all it ever said
about the Melbourne police. They have
just arrested a deserter from the Challenger.
Knowing that the police were looking for
him, he kindly joined the force to give
them a hand in the search. That was only
two years ago, but already they have recog-
ised him. They wouldn’t have done it, cer-
tainly, if he hadn’t had the bad luck to
meet with an accident which sent him into
the police hospital.
FROM THE CATTY POINT OF VIEW.
BETTY : “ They say the mother is as young
looking as the daughter."
LETTY : “You mean the daughter is as old
looking as the mother.”
No previous Wages Board determination
in Victoria —not even the first, tentative
ones —caused so much frothing as that
which has just given the clerks a lift. The
best of the big commercial houses made a
few adjustments, or raised a couple of
juniors to be seniors (one junior to three
seniors is the allowance), and that was all
they needed ; but the “hard” business firms
and the struggling, scrambling possessors of
a brass plate and a brassier cheek put in
applications for exemptions by the score.
The worst feature was that many clerks
themselves asked for permits to accept less
than the minimum of 48s. per week, on the
ground that they weren’t worth it, and
would get the sack if they had to be paid
the minimum. But the Department sat
tight, and waited for the threatened volcano.
And, as it expected, the volcano didn’t
arrive. The dismissals were comparatively
few; and as there is no scarcity of work in
the Cabbage Garden- —and vastly better-paid
toil than clerking at Is. an hour —those who
did get notice to quit will probably reap the
most advantage from the award. The
Bulletin just at the moment remembers a
leading Australian merchant of the younger
school, who, after spending 12 years in an
insurance office in Adelaide, was crowded
out by an amalgamation. He was then get-
ting 355. a week, and didn’t honestly believe
he was worth more. But when he was
thrown on his own resources, he found that
he wasn’t a poor little mouse or caterpillar ;
and he has established thriving “houses” in
two States since then.
Mr. O. W. Rosenliain, of Melbourne, has
published in pamphlet form the paper he read
to the Ornithological Society’s Congress in
Launceston (Tas.) two months ago. It is
a plea for the preservation of the birds that
are slaughtered to make women’s hats
fashionable, or poisoned by orchardists and
farmers under the delusion that they are
pests. The pamphlet deals with bird life' in
many lands, and states that everywhere it is
being foolishly destroyed. Lord Kitchener
reported that the Egyptian cotton crop in
1911 was partially eaten by insects whose
natural enemies, the birds, had been wan-
tonly killed. . He was then considering the
question of the absolute protection of feath-
ered creatures. In America the inroads of
insects due to the diminished supply of birds
are said to be costing the country stacks of
dollars. And Australia, which was never
overstocked with insect-eaters, is going the
way of the older countries. Mr. Rosenhain,
who has received assurances of sympathy
from Lady Denman and the Fuller lady,
quotes Longfellow at the end of his paper:—
You call them thieves and pillagers, but know
They are the winged wardens of your farms
Who from the cornfield drive the insidious foe
And from your harvests keep a hundred harms.
If Longfellow had strolled around the Block
any day last winter he might have dedicated
a special verse to Woman. Something in
this way:—
The blood of lovely birds is on your head.
The feathers of mute murdered songsters deck
Your monstrous hats, whilst skins of creatures dead
Tell tales of guilty deeds about your neck.
“Montere”: The Bible in Schools agita-
tion is going strongly once more in Maori-
land. It is a sort of epidemic,
liable to break out at any time,
but, from past experience, not par-
ticularly dangerous to the Educa-
tion system. The teachers, who
see the matter from the practical
point of view, have all the time
been opposed to it. Were the
teaching of the Bible part of the
regular school work, it would im-
pose upon the school staffs work
for which they have neither taste
nor time. In country districts
where there is but one teacher in
the local school, and the local com-
mittee has a say in the selection
of the man or woman to be en-
trusted with the job, something in
the nature of conscience tests
would be absolutely certain to creep
in. A Wowser district would in-
sist on having a Wowser, and an
R.C. district an R.C. teacher, and
all other qualifications would be
lost sight of in the great question
as to how the new master or mis-
tress would handle the Bible
lesson. Naturally, teachers object
to the creation of such a system of
selection. On the other hand,
there is certainly a lot to be said
for the reading of the Bibid as
literature, but it is not exactly the
kind of literature best suited for
primary schools. And, anyway, if
you consider the matter on that
ground alone, the Koran or the
Mahaparinibbana Suttanta has
just about as good a claim to be studied.
Still, the matter need not cause anyone to
lose sleep. As on previous occasions the
Bible in Schools party will become a house
divided against _ itself the moment it begins
to define the thing it wants.
Recently a lot of hot air was wasted in
Melbourne and other places about the great
value of the “cat” as a deterrent to crime;
and to prove its effectiveness Alan Moore,
the burglar who shot at Geoffrey Syme, was
ordered 15 lashes. That was on December
15. Now, three weeks after, when that ap-
plication of the “cat” ought to have been
putting in its best deterrent work, Mel-
bourne wakes up to find that another armed
Sikes has actually murdered a householder.
Something seems to have gone wrong once
more with the beautiful Madden-blessed
theory.
MIXED CLOUD BATHING.
The local council objects—as usual.
An irresistibly beautiful grocer lately took
off his apron and joined in the Melbourne
Age correspondence re the wearing of' wed-
ding rings by men. The grocer (a passing
reference to a pound of butter betrayed him)
told how he used to be troubled by the flir-
tatious advances of adoring females who,
regardless or unaware of the fact that he
was a married man, would linger at his
counter and sigh inquiries about sugar and
honey. To save himself, he started to grow
a moustache and look like a married grocer.
(The married grocer, seemingly, always re-
tires from the world behind a barrier of
whiskers.) The fascinating experimentalist
had a quiet period while the new decoration
was in the smudgy stage; but when it shot
out, and bloomed, and was a joy to witness,
another swarm of females pursued him and
fought for his smile. They were the older
fashioned girls who adored whiskers. Then,
a,fter a night of pedestrianism with the new
baby, he came to work one morning with one
of its safety pins sticking in the lapel of
his coat. In a day or so, no lovesick woman
was buying the usual pound of butter in
three lots in order that she might gaze into
his eyes a little longer. The moral of it all
appears to be that, though loveliness is a ter-
rible trial to a happily married grocer, he
can, thank Heaven, still find a perfect haven
of refuge behind the infant’s safety pin.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
An old Sydney flour mill, long a land mark on the
Parramatta-road, at its. junction with the Liverpool-
road, has just been demolished. In years gone by it
was known as Boylson’s, and a busy place it was.
The inn alongside was built in the first ’3o’s
by David Ramsay, with Simeon Lord behind him,
fdr John' Ireland, who called it Speed the
Plough. Ireland, whose descendants* still keep a pub
on Liverpool-road, had an interest in a line of coaches
which ran from the Talbot Inn, Upper George: street,
to Parramatta and Liverpool. Ramsay, who was a
doctor and merchant and son-in-law of Simeon Lord,
had 480 acres there, a dowry given with Miss Lord
when she became Mrs. Ramsay. In late years the
name of the inn was simply The Plough. Close by
were two large estates —Ashfield Park,, owned 100
years ago by Robert Campbell (of The Wharf), and
afterwards by James Underwood ; the other owned by
Augustus Alt, who got it as a grant for services ren-
dered as Surveyor-General. Alt came with Governor
Phillip, and occupies a very much neglected grave in
St. John’s cemetery, Parramatta. The travellers to
Parramatta in the old days must have been thirsty
souls. Close to Ashfield Park was the Ship Inn, or
Half-way House, kept by Henry Austin ; half a mile
further on was The Fox and the Grapes ; and a mile
and a half still further on was The Coach and Horses.
There were two others before you reached what is
now Granville —one called the Cottage in the Grove,
kept by the father of the late John Lackey, M.L.C.
At the .old racecourse alongside, John, who became
President of the Leg. Council, imbibed all his sport-
ing proclivities.
A good many severe things have been said
about the motor hog and his habits; but
there is something to be said for the oily
animal. He has his trials, and one of the
worst of them is the woman who steps into
a river of traffic and starts to paddle across
without troubling to look to right or left.
Frequently her hat is so constructed that
she is unable to look anywhere but straight
ahead. In any case, she only starts to get
out of the way when a pulled-up dray-horse
snorts over her shoulder, or a tram laden
with yells and waving umbrellas stops with
a grinding of brakes within a foot of the
place where her blouse is buttoned. Then
she squeals indignantly, and hobbles out of
the way. Usually she is saved without any
damage being done; but it sometimes hap-
pens that a traffic tangle works up at the
critical moment, and something has to be
bumped. Then the unluckiest. driver has to
select the cheapest- thing to collide with.
Last week, in Melbourne, a blankly indiffer-
ent lady, who scorned to look where she or
anyone else was going, got a motorist so
boxed that he had to take his choice between
herself, a van and a tram. He picked the
tram, and when things had stopped smash-
ing, his car looked as if it had jumped at
the Great Pyramid. The obstructor of
traffic looked curiously at the ruin she had
wrought, and went on to hold up the wheeled
procession elsewhere. If some genius would
write a cheap handbook on “How to Cross
the Road,” a lot of motorists would buy it —-
for presentation purposes.
THE WIDOWS MIGHT.
SHE: “I suppose you and your brothers were
sorry to hear of your uncle's death?"
HE: “Yes, very, very sorry."
SHE : “What did he leave?"
HE : “A confounded widow we knew nothing
about."
THE MECHANICAL MILLENNIUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tt is undeniable that in the near future the motor will
be a great asset in the promotion of national temper-
ance. — Argus (3/1/T3).
There’s a sober time approaching when we’ll sign the
pledge no more,
And the lust for lush will perish as the mileage-
figures soar ;
When the wind that fans our whiskers on the dusty
downward grade
Will wake a thirst for nothing more than lukewarm
lemonade.
There’s a beerless age ahead of us, a dry time draw-
ing near,
When each man has his motor and no money left for
beer!
Would we help the common herd in simple virtue to
advance?
Would we elevate the masses, we who toil for tem-
perance ?
Would we push our beerless barrow yet a great way
further on
Till we’ve broken up the brewers and the last, lone
pub is gone ?
Let us buy Plain Bill a motor-car, to take his missus
out—
When he’s finished buying petrol he will have no
cash to shout.

One of the duties of the matron on the
immigrant ship which brings out the “trained
domestics” from the factories of Manchester
And Nottingham is to see that the tender
female cargo is safe under hatches at a cer-
tain hour. On one ship the matron struck
trouble, and finally one night found this
touching little thing (by Mrs. Hemans or
somebody) pasted up in the women’s quar-
ters of the floating doss-house: —
The curfew rings for Girls Only
The Matron feels sad and lonely.
Where are niv girls,
Mv precious pearls?
In the glory hole, dancing Salome!
The verse was dreadful, but tbe truth was
probably more so.
Of course, there is no truth in the old
wheeze that there is one law for the rich and
another for the poor ; but it would take more
than a handful of Sydney magistrates to dis-
prove the rumor. Two cases last week: —
(1) The Representative of the Hungry Classes: A
man charged at the Central Police Court with having
obtained a meal at the A.B.C. Caffi on the previous
Saturday? and endeavored to leave the premises with-
out paving of it, was sentenced to 14 days’ hard
labor.— (D.T., 8/1/T3.)
(2) And the Representative of the Proprietary
Classes: Fred Hunter pleaded guilty at the Redfern
Court, and was fined £. 2 or one month, for unlaw-
fully assaulting William Somner, a man in his em-
ploy, whom he hit in the eye and also kicked in the
ribs.—(D.T., 9/l/’13.)

The Christians are still loving one another
furiously in the Castlemaine (Vic.) district,
where the local preachers went on strike 12
months ago. One of many denouements
was reached a week or so back. The head
serang or president of “Conference” ruled
that the trustees of the church where the
row was could legally attend the “Quarterly
meeting.” But the local parson, having his
own views, insisted upon the three trustees
quitting. They wouldn’t quit, so the police
were called in to assist in their exit from
“the Lord’s house” ! There is no record of
what the angels thought. They, unfortu-
nately, are off the reporters’ beat.
SHYLOCK OUTDONE.
THE MANAGER : "Nothing doing, Miss. I
can’t pay for form like yours.”
THE JOHNNIE: “By Jove, old man, how much
do you want? You're getting more than
yow pound of flesh, areat you?"
“Persina” saves her country:—
That something unusual was stirring in our Gipps
land townThip was evident. Even a stranger must
have noticed it: There were secret whisperings and
mysterious conferences. First of all it. looked as
though the whole town was changing its addres .
Every person was struggling with «e article of
furniture. But it wasn’t that—it was merely that the
Women’s League had issued invitations to an At
Home at the local hall, “to meet Mr. Irvine M.H.R.,
and Miss Cameron, organising secretary Of course
I went The stage had been decorated with pot ,
nlants and kerosene cases, only a convenient table-
cloth partly hid the cases. Seated on these were the
committee. A farmer, who had been a waiter, and,
therefore knew all about etiquette, had crowded him-
self into his old dress-suit and ushered in the guests.
Several mistook him for Irvine. Almost the first to
arrive was our local meaty butcher. Mr. Andrew
McPherson ” called the usher in a loud voice. What
Hie hell do you want?” said Andy, coloring to some
extent. You could have heard a bomb burst. Andy
noticed the ladies seated on the stage in evening
dress. The sight was too much for him. He turned
tail and fled. Among the pretty-early arrivals was
a voung woman who said she thought it was going o
be a dance and proffered a coin to the usher, who
attempted to refuse her admission. However, she was
soon past him, and took her unannounced. Mrs.
pvan was the next, bonnet and all. She had her in
vitation card in her stocking, but produced it easily.
“Mrs Pumpkin,” roared the usher presently. Pre-
Hnt sir ’’ said Mrs. Pumpkin, and pushed on towards
the stage The train came and went. No appearance
of Mr Irvine or Miss Cameron. The strains of an
accordeon were heard outside the hall. Let s have
a darnce,” said the young woman who had proffered
Hie coin. She was the only person not disappointed,
for a “darnce” it was.
TERRIBLE PAIN ON PALM OF HAND.
“One night I struck a match and the whole box
went off in my hand, burning me across the palm,
says Mr. J. It. Worseley, Margate (Tas.). The pain
was awful. I went to the store and looked round for
something to relieve me. I saw Chamberlain s Pain
Balm, and noticed the word “burns on the abe .
I rubbed it on my hand, with the result that the
pain quickly disappeared and I was able to go to
sleep In the morning I found the skin whole, and
the burn quickly healed without even leaving a
scar.”*
“TIME” PAYMENT (the fourteen-years
system ).
“Who's there! What are you doing?”
“Just getting a few things on easy terms,
lydy."
This isn’t the first growl of its kind :
It is to be hoped that the Commonwealth Bank will
improve on some of the methods of the States’ Sav-
ings Banks. The counters of the latter are too
crowded, the clerks too few, and the manner of their
address too loud and familiar. Mrs. Mary Jones,
after elbowing to the counter, hands over her book
and a couple of pounds. The book is thrown from
one clerk to another, and when initials are com-
pleted, arrives back. Mrs. Jones has not changed her
place, but the clerk, casting his eyes over the crowd.
calls with the lungs ot
a police court crier,
“Mary Jones, Mary
Jones.” He cries with
the same lungs when
he has located her:
“How much?” Then
the book is delivered.
When ’Mis. Hannah
Smith wishes to draw
out £ 5 and hands over
her book with the duly
signed order, the book,
after going the rounds,
is returned with the
five sovereigns or paper
money on the open up-
turned face of the
book, accompanied be-
fore delivery with the
cry, “Hannah Smith,
Hannah Smith, how
much ?” Hannah says
how much, though
everybody at the coun-
ter sees how much, and
she retires to stow it
away in some part of
her clothing. What
fine opportunities this
method affords to
thieves and spielers!
Altogether, the system
is bad. Denison Miller
is exhorted to think
out a better one.
“Melb,” discursively :
The Methodies have a move-on law, and, except
under most exceptional circumstances, a man can t
hang on to one pulpit more than five years. Mostly
he is passed along at the end of three. Yet Pastor
Edgar, the State Cabinet Minister’s brother, has just
been expatiating on his 29 years at Wesley Church in
Lonsdale-street. In 1857 the Wesleyans had a church
at the corner of Collins and Queen streets. I*V e y
sold to the Bank of Australasia for £40,000. The
denomination, demoralised by cash, thereupon built
this awful Wesley Church. The famous Jonah
organ was transferred into it from Collins-street.
This machine, already old, and said to have been
formerly in a Dublin music-hall, was bought for an
R.C. church at Rio. But the ship couldn t get into
Rio on account of bad weather, so the organ had to
come on to Melbourne. Again, however, there was
trouble, the vessel being wrecked at the Heads. As
a spec, the Wesleyans bought the organ for £5OO.
Maybe because of the windy Jonah, the church was a
dismal failure for 33 years. Then Edgar started as
a successful imitator of Taylor, of Sydney, who, by
the way, also gave the tip to Hugh Price Hughes, m
London. Edgar’s chief standby has been the “Pleasant
Sunday Afternoon.” Consul-General Hwang was one
of the' speakers last year, and made us think when he
estimated that when Australia has only 10 millions,
China, Japan, India, Malaya, Java and the Archi-
pelago will have a thousand millions.
The story of the
latest Melbourne burg-
lary, with murder at-
tached, should be an
incentive to women to
always remember
their natural means
of protection when
danger threatens. Two
burglars, armed with
revolvers, invaded the
bedroom of Arthur
Trotter and his wife
in the dead of night,
and demanded deliv-
ery of the money
which that commer-
cial traveller and col-
lector had secreted
under the bedding.
Whilst Trotter par-
leyed with the rob-
bers his wife lay ter-
rified into silence.
Perceiving that the
man who had him cov-
ered with a gun was
likely to fire, she im-
plored her husband to
give up the money.
Trotter pluc k i 1 y
sprang out of bed to
grapple with the rob-
ber, and received a
bullet in the head,
whereupon his mur-
derer’s mate took the
money-bag from the
place where Trotter
had been lying. Then
the wife shrieked, and
the robbers fled. The
piercing scream is
Nature’s ’ gift to
woman. Unhappily,
she is disposed to use
it at the wrong time,
not having been
taught to think of it
as a' firearm —a thing
to be turned on im-
mediately at the man who would terrify her
into silence. It may be arguecl that the
man, in this case, was prepared to put a
bullet into Mrs. Trotter if she shrieked;
but the chances are that he wouldn’t have
done anything of the sort.^
The Adelaide Register has been trying
to revive the “viaduct” scare, so familiar
when the Adelaide-to-Melbourne railway was
being made. About seven miles from the
city, just as the line is getting into the hills,
it crosses a narrow gully, on a steel struc-
ture which from a little distance looks spi-
dery, and, having no parapet, gives an odd
sensation to anyone looking out and down
while crossing. Engineers all swore that
the thing was as safe as any other bit of the
line, but for years most people felt relieved
each time on getting safely across. The
present alarm, which professes to come from
“an official of the department,” raises two
ERMYNTRUDE.
points—(l) The little bridges are 25 years
old, and iron corrodes; (2) they are pecu-
liarly liable to be struck by lightning. But
the Railway Department itself has replied
coldly that original care and present in-
spection make the viaduct as safe now as
ever, and that damage by lightning is so
outside railway experience as to be not worth
bothering about.
THE MINGLERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What our reporter calls “the unconventional ming-
l'ne of the sexes" is much more unwholesome than
■an be any piles of dirty jam and fish tins.
—Melbourne Age on Seaside Camps.
A sight that gives me much distress
Is George without his trousers,
Garbed, scantily, in bathing dress
Proscribed by saintly Wowsers,
And Gerty, gay and forward flirt,
Without the regulation skirt.
Though ’tis a fearsome sight, I ween,
When jam tins strew the shingle,
It is a far more shocking scene
When Bert and Benjy mingle
With Maude and Winnie in the wave;
It hurts to see them so behave.
The .melancholy ilead marine
Sown thick along the beaches,
The can that £eld the late sardine,
Or potted prawn, or peaches,
Are things of innocence beside
Gay Tom and Topsy in the tide.
I hold by stern morality,
Despite the worldlings’ scoffing,
And though it pains my soul to see
A fish tin in the offing,
’Tis naught beside the things I feel
Whene’er I hear Belinda squeal.
Indeed, this tin that held sardine
My sad soul sorely vexes.
The fish it harbored might have been
Unwed, and mixed in sexes!
Good brothers, can you wonder, then,
That seaside damsels mix with men?
A pile of picnic scraps, ’tis true,
Can raise a mild commotion.
But what of John and Jane and Sue
Mixed in a single ocean ?
A sight that stabs me to the heart
Is Billo smoodging with his tart.
But hhrk, my brothers, yester eve
I hdd a wondrous vision.
The sun was just about to leave,
With his well-known precision,
When I espied upon the sand
A tin with a familiar brand.
And, as I gazed, mj r limbs grew limp
And giddiness came o’er me ;
For front it stepped a flsh-like imp
That smirked and bowed before me!
His puckered features seemed to be
Awry with spite and devilry.
“Young man,” he said, “You’re wasting time.
Why do you sit there mooning?
So brave a youth, just in his prime,
Should find more joy in spooning.
For see! the ocean hath its pearls.
Go forth and mingle with the girls!”
And from the tins that lay about
Upon the silver shingle
I heard a wee shrill chorus shout.
“Young man, go forth and mingle!”
And then I knew each empty tin
Concealed its special imp within.
I know my eye grew wide and bright.
Despite a life ascetic,
And from the narrow path of right
I felt a tug magnetic,
That sought to draw me o’er the sand
Out to the siren-haunted strand.
I felt the red blood course anew,
I felt my pulses tingle ;
And still the tiny chorus grew:
“Young man, go forth and mingle! ....
Then, from an old, bashed can I saw
A lordly lobster wave a claw.
“Good fellow, have a care!” he said,
“Stray not from pathways upper!
I am the ghost of one long dead,
Slain for a sinful supper.
But once good works were done by me
Amongst the sinners of the sea.
“In life I roamed the vasty deep
Engaged upon a mission,
Which was my fellow-fish to keep
From swimming to perdition.
Now I am dead” (his voice grew thin),
“Alas! they mingle in the tin!
“Beware the blood that bounds and leaps!
Your sinful feelings throttle.
Beware the imp that leers and peeps
From out each tin and bottle!
A submarine Chapzander speaks.
Beware when gay Belinda squeaks !
Lo, as he spoke my blood grew chill,
The spell no longer bound me,
The impish chorus now was still
And silence reigned around me.
The ghostly lobster disappeared ;
Mv heart of base desire was cleared.
But, like a man inspired, I saw
His cause for intervening.
His sad, sweet face, his waving claw
To me were full of meaning.
Indeed, a sainted fish was he,
A very Wowser of the Sea.
You smile, good friend ? But ah, be sure
’Tis not a theme for scoffing;
For well, too well, I know the lure
Of fish tins in the offing.
A devil lurks inside each tin
To tempt unwary souls to sin.
And, to this day, I feel a thrill
Mid tins upon the shingle;
I seem to hear that chorus shrill:
“Young man, go forth and mingle!”
And yet, ’tis naught to what I feel
Whene’er I hear Belinda squeal.

PETER (at the gate): " Jeminy, but won't this
make some of our people jealous!"
“Kus” : Couldn’t get any sleep for the
mosquitoes for a couple of nights, and then remem-
bered the old bush dodge of hanging a piece of raw
pluck over the bunk, with a small tin of kerosene
suspended about 6in. below the meat. Have ever
since been able to sleep outdoors without a net.
The mosks. make for the meat; then the glare which
kerosene gives off, even on a dark night, attracts
them, and they commit wholesale hari-kari. In the
morning the tin is thick with immolated mosks.,
self-sacrificed on the altar of reeking pluck.
Cbloe, concerning a marine blossom: —
rr * le masquerading crab mentioned by “Reka” (B.
/12/ 12) is not altogether peculiar to Fiji. Many
thousands of his first cousins, with similar habits,
frequent the tropic beaches and tidal estuaries of
North Australia. The estuaries of the De Grey, Ord,
and Fitzroy Rivers swarm at certain seasons of the
year with a small crab, not larger, when full grown,
than a florin, and of a brilliant scarlet color. From
v a . d i st^ nce the river-banks have the appearance of
being covered with some bright bloom, but closer
inspection shows myriads of crabs on the march,
sometimes in single file, sometimes in other forma-
tions, but all moving in perfect order. There are
commandants, and staff officers, who might have
studied the necessary “swank” of their profession
under Sergeant Ryrie or Corporal Onslow. They have
outposts and scouting Darties, and their hearing is
so acute that a light step on the beach or a pebble
dropped away in mid-stream is sufficient to alarm
the crabs along half a mile of march, whereupon
they disappear instantly by sinking through the
sort mud. Along the North Queensland beaches are
others of about the same size, and just as militant
looking, but of a bright, electric-blue color.
* * * *
“Machete,” concerning a higli-flyer:—
“V.J.D.’s” sketch, “Told at Vila” (B. 21/11/’l2),
introduces at least one picturesque identity of the
Papua of years ago, in the person of “Thorsen,” or
Sorenson, as he was known then. Christy
had been, as “V.J.D.” states, a member of the Viking
crew which sailed its craft across the Atlantic to
the Chicago Exhibition. But that was not a
thousand-year-old craft. It was a modern replica of
the Norseman’s old sea-dragon. Christy, when I
knew him, was varl or admiral, or whatever the
ancient Northern pirates called it, .of a yawl that was
well known in Sydney when it carried the late Jack
Want and his pals on fishing (and other) expedi-
tions. A couple of Maorilanders, dazzled with Louis
Becke legends, bought the craft all standing in Syd-
ney, and sailed it to Papua, where the luxurious
fittings roused the scorn of the hardened traders and
the delighted wonder of the giant Papuan cockroaches
which went aboard at Samarai. When the Maori-
landers realised sadly what trading in Papua really
meant, they sold out gladly. The purchaser stripped
the vessel, and the crevices of the cushioned divan
yielded many curios, such as cigar-ends, corks, hair-
pins, gloves, a garter or two, and so on. Under whose
regime these accumulated it is impossible to say.
Subsequently, the craft fell into the possession of
the improvident and likable Christy, and his flier
and his fiddle had equal place in his affections.
Nothing delighted him more than a race, and villages
with copra to sell had to wait until his yawl had it
out with some lugger or big, mat-sailed East Cape
canoe, the Guenevere being the only craft in the
Papua of that day able to hold its own with the
native fliers. For these and other reasons, Christy
did not prosper, though his mana was great up and
down the reef. As for the old Guenevere, she gradu-
ally went the way of most fast females, and last 1
saw of her she smelt horribly of bSche-de-mer.
“Te Babarantiko,” as a versatile under-
taker :—■
Following up the subject of the disposal of
corpses by colored peoples, I have seen in cholera
epidemics the peaceful defunct hurrying seaward
on the mighty ebb of the Hooghly. I have helped
to persuade persistent dead to relax the clasp-knife
position taken over our chain cable in the Irrawaddy,
and I could tell you things about the
Meinam, too, and a raft of teakwood logs.
Also, there was the ancient submarine
burial place of Natata islet, in Makin
lagoon, seen by but few, if any other,
white men’s eyes. It was an irregular
circular wall constructed of coral »ock
some 10ft. or 12ft. below lowest ebb.
In the centre of the enclosure was a black
chasm, about 6ft. across, in the reef, the
chasm in its turn being surrounded by a
stone wall. The natives described the
hole as bottomless. In times gone by the
dead, wrapped in special mats, were sunk
in the chasm, and eventually eaten by
crabs and fishes. At a later period the
same people adopted slow roasting as the
best means of disnosing of the cadaver.
Shallow trenches filled to the brim with
glowing husk and t’uri wood surrounded
the bier on which lay the corpse. The
women, dishevelled, ash- and dirt-be-
daubed, squatted around the trenches,
giving vent to hair-raising laments, and
grabbing up and scattering glowing em-
bers in the air, to fall on and scar their
nude bodies. Nowadays those people
bury their dead a la white men, in a
rough wooden coffin (if the local trader
can be beguiled into giving the boards
on credit), or wrapped in mats. Owing
to the water being reached at a very shal-
low depth all. through the atolls, usually
only a dozen inches of sand covers the
departed. There are generally native wells
near by. The handiest disposal I have
seen, and came near sampling myself,
was at the vellow fever hospital (Hos-
pital del Isolamento) in Santos, Brazil,
where a large pit, partly filled with
quicklime, received and neatly got rid of
the very frequent corpses handed in every
day when Yellow Jack was busv.
“Flinderino”: Hoes anybody know the
weight of the largest clam-shell gathered on the
Australian shore? Whilst on the Barrier Reef some
time ago a blackfellow offered me for a shilling the
biggest one I’ve ever seen. The bivalve, which was
embedded in the coral, must have weighed close on
half a ton. The nigger claimed ownership, as he saw
it first. I declined the offer, as I hadn’t a steam
winch on me at the time. Director Le Souef, of the
Melbourne Zoo, had a pair of shells which weighed
4cwt. Mariner Sykes, an ancient Queensland pilot,
found a brace on the Endeavor Reef, which he esti-
mated would weigh about 7cwt. with the fish inside.
This giant was afterwards collected by some bSche-
de-mer fishermen, and eventually found its way to
Sydney, and was placed outside the doors of the
Museum.
A GOURMAND.
BILL WAYBACK (after studying the bill of fare with interest): "Ere, bring me all wol's
on 'ere, an a piece o' bread."
“Yarrum” : For its inches, there is not a
gamer bird living than the willy wagtail. Once, at
the Patterson River (N.S.W.), I came upon a pretty
little nest with two young Willies in it. The birds
were almost full-fledged and could fly a very little.
It was evident, from feathers and hair lying around,
that they had both had their first flutter, accom-
panied by the parents. After a little while, one of
the youngsters, reaching for a peep at me, fell out
of the nest, and fluttered feebly out over the widish
river. It dropped into the water, out near the
middle, and would have been drowned in a short
time. I had my collar and tie unshipped preparing
to swim out; but just here the old birds came to the
rescue. Kicking up an awful bobbery, they flew out,
settled down in the wet, one on each side of young
Bill, and towed and pushed him ashore. Then they
preened and dried the little one’s plumage, and
helped it up to the nest. There was great rejoicing
in the camp, in which the other little William joined.
The feat struck me as all the more remarkable, be-
cause the willy wagtail, although fond of a dip
(which it mostly has from a bending branch, bob-
bing in and out of the water), never by any chance
flops bodily into the moisture.
THE BUDGEGONG RACES.
“ You didn't win, after all, Jarky. ”
“ No, dis pheller bin boll off course, bin jump
right over plurry barb wire fence. By
cripes him plenty frighten me white as
plurry sheet!'"
“Old Fritz”: “Ginger” has seen his first
blackfellow, found him circumcised, and remarks:
“This is the only part of Australia where the ancient
rite is practised.” “Ginger” has been prospecting on
a very old field, for not only circumcision, but in-
cision (Sturt’s “terrible rite”) is a custom of all the
Australian tribes that have not fallen wholly under
the influences of the white man’s “civilisation.”
“Silas” : Hawkins was an assisted immi-
grant with a patch of land at Ibbooby (Vic.). When
he had been on the place a month, he was still sit-
ting on a stump, looking fixedly at the holding,
trying to make up his mind where to start first.
Cardon, the rabbit inspector, found him surveying
the land, and gave him a friendly hint about doing
his share towards knocking out Brer Bunny. Carden
scattered a glance over the same locality a month
later, and found evidences that the plague was mak-
ing marked progress. Hawkins was still sitting on
a stump, thinking that perhaps it would be best to
start clearing in the nor’-east corner. The inspector
reproached him: “You know, you’ll have to do
something to clear out these confounded rabbits,”
he said. “All the people around here are complain-
ing, and your block seems a regular breeding place.
Get to ’em with something, right away.” Hawkins
was hurt. “Get to ’em!” he whined. “Why, blime,
ain’t I bin sprinklin’ insecterbane all the mornin’ ?”
“Hisiu”: Papua contains 7,765,342 spi-
ders. Of all shapes and sizes, their variegated
pigments would rival the show on Flemington lawn
on Cup Day. Some make their homes in the scrub
wood, others in the thatch of native houses, others
in the banks of the creeks. The
home of one variety is made of
clay, something like the trap-
door. spider’s of N.S.W. and
Queensland. But the residences of
the Papuan cousins are without
doors. The bite of a spider which
makes its home in the palm
thatching of huts is greatly feared
by natives, and is often fatal.
This spider is quite a little fellow,
with black legs and a scarlet body.
Another variety, to be met with
in the mountains, resembles a
land crab in size. Its color is
black, and its legs and body are
clothed with fur. In the Mekeo
district (inland from Yule Island)
a large spider weaves a very
strong web, with which the
natives make fishing nets. This is
done by tying together the ends
of a forked branch of a tree, so as
to form a frame similar in shape
to a tennis racquet, though larger. The web is then
wound around the frame, and Brother Brown gets
busy—or as busy as he ever likes to get.
“Peva” : The Papuan doesn’t want much,
and the cocoanut tree provides most of it. The milk
gives him a cool and refreshing drink. The nut is
food. It contains a fair percentage of oil, which he
uses as a medicine. When mixed with ochre and
other pigments it furnishes him with paint for his
personal adornment, and for decorating his shields,
spears, canoes, gods, etc. He extracts the oil in
a simple way. The nut is scraped, and the scrapings
are wrapped in a piece of fibrous bark (taken from
that part of the cocoanut tree where the branches
shoot from the stem) and squeezed. With the
shell of the nut he makes cooking pots, spoons, etc.
The rind he uses for fuel. And last, but not by any
means the least important, in a country where the
rainfall is very heavy, the branches provide him with
a first-class thatching for his house.
PURE ENGLISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the closing of some of the higher schools for
the Christmas vacations, a plea was made for the
use of pure English. —News item.
Myself, I’ve often thought of this ;
I have, in fact, been very sad
To hear young Bill or little Cis
Use English which their poor old dad
Can only class as hoodlum cheek—
It knocks me bandy, so to speak.
I’ve known the wretched kids come home,
And jaw about their pals at school—
How one was ratty in the dome,
Or dillv, or a balmy fool;
And, if I chide, they set up lip—
It sometimes gives a man the pip.
I used to go and watch their play,
Forgetting thus my unpaid bills ;
But never since that dreadful day
They said, “Oh, nit; here comes his Jills—
Let’s do a duck across the park,
And blow him out—the bald old nark!”
These are the sort of gags that hurt,
So, on the fly, I caught young Bill,
And said a piece. “It is a cert.,”
I chinned to him, “you’ll get your fill
Of leather dope, my wayward son—
Why, blime, boy, you take the bun.
“What sort of lurk is this you’re at?
Where do you learn this slang-stunt coarse?
I’ll whack your spine-bone through your hat
If you don’t cut it out, old horse.
Leave such to pugs and vulgar coves—
Pure English, lad, your birth behoves.
“When I was young, in College years,
My old man lobbed round every day,
And pitched a tale into my ears,
Much as I’m pitching you to-day.
He’d say, ‘Bog into Shakspeare, Syd ;
He has the English style, no kid.’
“But, nowadays, old Shak. seems down
And out, as far as I can pick,
And purity of speech done brown—
No wonder teaching-blokes get sick.
You’ll find you’re up against it, Bill,
If you don’t chuck this stable frill.
“It is so low to use such chat—
Think how it jars your ma and me.
This is the last, yes, strike me fat,
The last time I will stand it—-see?
Henceforth, if slang you don’t eschew,
I’ll dust the liver out of you!”

“Leichhardt” : This is in answer to “Mimo-
sa” (B. 5/12/T2). A carpenter I know set out to
ride from Eddington to Fort Constantine, 80 miles.
Being a poor bushman, he missed his road, and con-
tinued his journey till he sighted Cloncurry (Q.).
He had then done 76 miles, but turned back till he
hit the turn-off to “the Fort,” where he arrived in
the twilight, having covered 114 miles. He was back
at Eddington next day long before sundown, making
194 miles in two days. Same individual rode regu-
larly every Saturday afternoon for weeks a distance
of 48 miles, sometimes lengthening the trip six miles
by humanely taking his horse round to an off-side
pub for a long beer. On Christmas Eve, four years
ago, I myself did 82 miles on a 14-year-old mare,
followed by a dog the whole distance. This isn’t
much of a record for the horse, but, as the temuera-
ture around Cloncurrv romps up about 110° in
December, it was a fair-up for the dog.
CHRISTMAS AT THE MULGA CAME
“K. O. Gill”; If Australia was suddenly
confronted with the full extent of the damage and
suffering to animals caused by the barb-wire habit
it would be considerably astonished. Moving round
the North Coast (N.S.W.) recently, I found the same
old traces of the curse that I have become accus-
tomed to. There is hardly a horse that has not one
or more scars caused by the pronged wire, and, asking
the old question, I learned that numbers of valuable
animals have been so badly injured as to neces-
sitate destruction. If a barb-wire fence was of
any more use than four plain wires strained tight, I
might begin to understand its popularity, but it
isn’t. Also, it is not so cheap—a piece of news
which will probably make some fool people brush up
their thinking apparatus.
"Pick”: When the wind-endurance trial
is being run, Tilba Tilba, at the foot of Mount
Dromedary (N.S.W.), will be somewhere about.
Ancient Binghi evidently thought so too, for Tilba
means windy, and the double name indicates that
the tribe’s head meteorologist considered the region
extra special in the way of howling gales. White
interlopers afterwards upheld the idea by attaching
the names “Hurricane Hill,” “Whistling Point,” and
“Stand-agin-it” to parts of the landscape. It is a
region of almost perpetual blow, wherein the only
thing the wind has never been known to shift is the
cow-cocky’s conscience.
A NEW YEAR DAY ITEM.
BINGHI : “My word! Big pheller blowfly somewhere!"
“Pot Brook”; “Mimosa” (B. 5/12/T2)
wants to know what is the longest distance a
moke has been ridden off the grass. Here goes:
No. I—owned by Allan McLean, of Hynam (S.A.),
carried his owner from Hamilton (Vic.) to Narra-
coorte (S.A.), in 14 hours, distance 115 miles. No.
2 —The day succeeding Black Thursday, the late
David Edgar, one of the early pioneers, rode a
grass-reared moke from Portland to his estate,
Konepra, a distance of 110 miles. One can imagine
what the trip would be, yet this great prad swel-
tered through, and had daylight all the way,
“Snakespear” : A few years ago it was the
almost universal belief that the snake population of
Papua was very small. This, like many other be-
liefs about Papua, has since been exploded. The
Possession’s snake families are, in fact, fairly
numerous, and their re-
semblance to well-known
Australian crawlers has
earned for them such
names as the black,
brown, green, diamond,
ring and carpet. Some
are very venomous, not-
ably the brown snake,
which is met with fre-
quently in the coastal dis-
tricts. The death adder,
too, is pretty common in
the hill country. I have
killed a few. I know of
two instances where dogs
bitten by them succumbed
within 30 minutes. The
largest snake is the New
Guinea python. The
markings on its skin are
somewhat similar to those
of the Australian carpet
snake, but the skin itself
is much darker. It grows
to an enormous length.
Some time ago I saw the
dried skin of one which
was killed on one of the Northern goldfields. It
measured over 30ft. in length. I know of another
instance where one was killed and found to measure
over 20ft.
“J.G.” : Re “A.Y.A.’s” par (B. 5/12/T2).
Blacks are not immune from bee-stings, and, more-
over, they don’t compare with white men when it
comes to robbing a nest. Have seen white men in
N.S.W. and Queensland go out, and do a successful bit
of burglary with nothing to help them but a smok-
ing stick; whereas I remember once, when four abos.
on the Barambah settlement laid siege to a hive,
it took them an hour, after falling the tree,
before they were game to get to close quarters, and
they didn’t do it then until they had burnt about an
acre of herbage in order to cover their advance. Binghi
has no heart to endure bee or any other stings, and it
is only dire necessity which makes him, at any
time, crack Mr. Busy’s crib.
“Mimosa”: He was out on the station for
experience, and he wasn’t imported goods either.
We were on the road with sheep. The fence on one
side of the “break” for a couple of panels was not
too safe for the first night’s camp; so “Sydney” was
sent ahead and told to “brush up” the wire at the
back of the canvas, and have it finished slick, as the
sheep would be there in an hour. When we arrived
Sydney was still hard at work “brushing up” the
fence. But not with timber and small boughs. He
had a tin of polish he had ridden to the store for.
Says he to the boss: “She does not shine too good,
but that’s the rust. Next time she’ll look better.”
“Tiaki”: The younger Maori is beginning
to recognise that some of his race’s ancient cere-
monies, songs, etc., will go the way of the moa if
the remnants of the old generation are not made to
disgorge their store of knowledge. So a council has
been sitting to collect the lore. Great secrecy is
observed, and none but those Who receive permission
may view the records or be present when the evidence
is being taken. Some influential Henares are going
to build a large carved council-house at Carterton, in
the Wairarapa district, where the good work is to be
continued in the near future. One subject which
occupied the council’s attention was the ahikomau.
This was Henare’s ancient method of preserving fire.
First, a suitable bank was selected, a deep trench was
dug in it with the lower end down hill, and a log of
poporokaiwhiria (Iledycaria dentata) was laid in the
opening with its lower end resting on two boulders.
A fire was then lit round it, and, when well alight,
was buried in with earth. The old hands claim that
fire thus lit would be a glowing coal 10 and even 12
years after it was started. One or two of the com-
mittee started out to try the trick and prove the
old chaps to be tarradiddlers. After four months they
returned, and, on unearthing the log, found it to be
a glowing mass, just as the patriarchs had testified.

“McNorth” : The Papuan uses his ears as
a parcels express. The lobe is pierced when its
owner is very young, and the opening is gradually
distended until in many cases the ear flaps oh the
shoulder. In the loop thus formed he hangs the
family cash-box and quantities of his household
goods, so that when he goes to the garden to see if
his wife is doing her best, there is not much left for
the servant girl to get away with. Apropos ears, it
has been said that the' Papuan has a good one for
music as well as for furniture removing; but this is
doubtful. Some years ago six members of an itin-
erant Salv’army troupe visited Samarai. They were
possessed of the usual cornet, trombone, drum, etc.
Before commencing the performance the “captain”
presented to the wide-eyed niggers a number of coins,
beads, etc., with the understanding that the presents
were to be handed up to the performer they reckoned
played the best music. The show started. The cor-
net blew his hardest, the trombone man nearly burst
a lung, while the drummer worked himself into a
frenzy. When peace once more reigned the Papuans
were told to give their presents to the best musician.
Like one man the crowd rushed forward and heaped
their gifts at the feet of the rouseabout who banged
the big drum.
* * * *
“Te Babarantiko” : In his book, “Papua,”
Administrator Murray, talking of the small regard
of the nigger for human life, tells how a Papuan
on trial for murder explained that he killed a man
because “he talked too much”; another declared he
had killed a man because he was “no good.” I can
bear witness to like happenings. On the evening of
May 5, 1911, a Gilbert Islander quietly got out of
his bunk in one of the labor barracks on Ocean
Island (each barrack holds about 100 men), went
over to another bunk occupied by one of the com-
pany’s native police, struck a match to make sure
of his man, drew a sheath knife and slit open the
said man’s stomach. He then coolly returned to his
own bunk. “He talked too much,” said the nigger
in his defence. “His chatter kept me awake every
evening.” I know of another case where a native
on Maiana Atoll killed a woman and a girl for no
other reason than that, in his opinion, they were
“no good, and not fit to live.”
“Marloo”: A Northern River sapling,
which has long been the pride of Nimbin, 20 miles
north-west of Lismore (N.S.W.), was felled the
other day. It was a pine, just over 7ft. in diameter
at the butt, and contained 13,661 ft. of timber.
* * * *
“Ivaree”: Be “D.L.M.” (B. 19/12/T2)
and the barramundi, which he says are caught only
in the Dawson (Q-). I have coaxed the fish time
and again out of the Burnett River and Tinana
Creek waters, and I reckon that’s pretty fair evidence
that “D.L.M.” is wrong. In this season of grease
and goodwill, I can’t put it more tenderly than that,
can I ?
“Te Babarantiko”: Practically all the
languages spoken by the brown people of the wide
Pacific, from Maoriland in the south to Hawaii, and
west as far as Java and the Malay Peninsula, have
the same inter-relation that most European languages
have. It is a far cry (some 2100 miles) from Maori-
land to the Line Islands, yet the Maori word for dog,
te kuri, is the Gilbert te kiri. The Gilbert Islanders
also, by the way, call a dog te kamea, but that is
perhaps modern, and a corruption of “Come here!”
Also they call the animal te kaukau, which seems to
have been inspired by the dog’s bark. (Primitive people
usually name things animate by the noise they make.)
There is no end to words available for comparison,
but I will only say (as these words have so often
been used in Maoriland pars.), that mate has exactly
the same meaning in the Gilberts as in M.L., and
that the Maori waliine and the Gilbertese te aine
(woman) is practically the same word when spoken.
It is a still farther cry from the Line Islands to the
middle and west of Malaysia, yet I have found similar
words in both localities absolutely identical in mean-
ing, though the languages thereabouts would be unin-
telligible to the people of the Central and Southern
Pacific. Samples: Malay, mata (eye); Gilbert
Islands, mata. Malay, ikan (fish) ; Gilbert Islands,
ika. Malay, rumah (house) ; Gilbert Islands, uma;
Javanese, umah. More particularly are the words for
numbers closely related throughout Oceania and
Malaysia. Islands several thousand miles apart have
many of the numbers, especially (and curiously) 2,
3,4, 6,6, 7 and 8 almost exactly, and in many cases
exactly, alike.
“Gouger” : One of the many peculiar cus-
toms of the Pascoe River (N.Q.) natives is that of
never speaking by word of mouth to a man to whom
they are related by marriage. I have often told one
of them to go and spear some fish, but he, for some
reason or other, not wanting to go, has passed on
the request by finger-talk to another native. The
fish duly arrived. But, if there are no marriage ties
about, the natives do the necessary yabber-yabber by
tongue and lips. These blacks live very well. The
bush is full of wild fruits, game of every sort, and
enormous yams. A favorite dish is the carpet
snake, which is very plentiful in most of the scrubs.
I have often shot a healthy-looking snake and
watched the boys seize it, and bite its stomach open
with their teeth, to satisfy themselves that the' rep-
tile was fat. That ascertained, a hole is scooped in
the sand, a good fire lighted in it, and a number of
flat stones heated. On one layer of these the snake
is coiled, then another layer of hot stones is spread
on top of him, the whole being covered completely
over with sand, and a fire lighted on top. It is a
beautifully-cooked snake that finally emerges from
the oven, skin, intestines, all intact. When served
up with yams, and especially if some wild plums are
handy, Menzies or the Australia couldn’t entice me
away.
"LET BYGONES BE BYGONES."
VISITING MISSIONER (of the Cannibal Convert
Society): “But is it true that the society's
recent appointment is distasteful to you and
your brethren? ”
THE TRIBAL COOK : “ Well— er—not now, sir.
We had dinner with him yesterday.”
“F.T.S.”: Do magpies breed every year?
Though protected fowl, and, as far as I know, not
preyed upon by anything, they do not seem to in-
crease very greatly. One old cock bird has for the
past two years put up at our homestead, but he has
never introduced a lady bird, and the population
question doesn’t worry him. Apparently the only
thing he takes an interest in is the counter lunch.
ABDOOLA’S FLIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Abdoola left his ship because ’tis plain as plain can
be
The brown man who is desert-bred shall never love
the sea.
He’d rather face the sand and sun, the hot sirocco's
breath,
Than live the life which is to him the life of living
death.
Abdoola left his ship because upon the shrieking
seas
No lean, grey camel ever yet went down upon its
knees;
Because athwart the salty rim no dust-cloud signi-
fied
The sprawling teams that ever on the Great Lone
Pathways hied.
The Captain eyed the Customs men with white, un-
spoken fear ;
For when a brown man flees his ship that flight
shall cost him dear.
He played the hunter for a week —a grim, resultless
game ;
For Allah sees that all his sons shall look and
speak the same.
Abdoola steers the hunchies now, and no one seems
to know
That he is other than the man who steered them
long ago.
He wears his crimson turban and his wide, white
pantaloons,
And smokes the pipe that Abdul smoked ’neath
countless midnight moons.
For caravans are sprawling things that do not
understand ;
The footprints that are made to-day to-morrow fills
with sand ;
The desert stars are sentinels who see but never
tell;
And Allah’s sons were ever taught to keep a secret
well.
The Captain paid the Treasury one hundred sea-
stained pounds;
The Customs men, keen-sensed and grim, still go
their restless rounds ;
The Border Guards report “No trace”—but are they
much to blame?
For Allah’s sons are as the sands, and, like the
sands, the same!

W. S. Viner, who easily defeated Dr.
Lancaster for the chess championship of
Australia, is a farmer who works home with
father on land near Bellingen (N.S.W.).
Like J. L. Jacobsen, the ex-champion best
known to the last generation, Viner is a
comfortable, nerveless person with plenty
of fat on his bones. His probable challenger,
A. E. N. Wallace, a city man and a mathe-
matician, isn’t of that type.
J. W. SUTHERLAND ,
General Manager of the
Horseshoe (Kalgoorlie, W.A.).
Statistician Knibbs is still picking the
fruits of the last census. On April 3, 1911,
the Commonwealth owned three husbands
and 18 wives who had married at 14, eight
and 92 at 15, and 25 and 343 at 16. Of
the various ladies, five of the 18 had babies
within the customary period, 25 of the 92,
and 149 of the 343. At the other end of the
table there were three wives over 100, and
four between 95 and 100. Also, there were
110* husbands and 49 wives alive with
families of 21 and upwards. Apparently,
judging by these last figures, the rearing of
a sizeable family is less wearing on the part-
ner who fills the pot than on the one who
cooks it.
Another Tasmanian Bishop, Dr. Mercer,
will be added to the retired list in England.
He only _ awaits his successor’s nomination
to hand in his gaiters.
Iluka, on the Clarence River (N.S.W.),
has put up something like a record. Until
the other day, when the license was trans-
ferred, the name of John Rush (brother of
Mick, the sculler of olden days) had been
over the door of the local pub for 39 years.
“A. 8.” : The party most surprised by the
sudden announcement that Deakin was
going to retire from politics was Deakin him-
self. His decision, he thought, was a secret
known only in the bosom of his famliy. This
sort of thing comes from living in a wire-
less age.
Old digger William Mitchell, another
Eureka Stockader, has just died at Long-
reach (Q.), aged' 75. We begin to under-
stand what a task the military really had to
face in attacking the determined million or
so of armed diggers who sought death rather
than yield principle.
Henry Howell, for 38 years connected with
the Howard Smith Co., during which time he
rose from wharfinger to director, died on Jan-
uary 8. He had retired from active service in
July last, and, at the end of his six months’
leave, the firm’s staff gave him a send-off last
Wednesday. The reporters were collecting
names for the usual valedictory par. when
news was received that the guest, on leaving
the gathering, had practically dropped dead,
the result of excitement working on a weak
heart.
Walter Murdoch, the man who missed the
professorship of English at the Melbourne
University because he was an Australian,
goes to a similar job at the new Perth Uni,
His going discloses the fact that, of late, he
has been helping to pour out giggle-stuff for
“The Passing Show,” a dreadfully-humorous
feature of Saturday’s Argus. A man is
known by the company he keeps, and it is
painful to discover that the apparently-
respectable Murdoch has been keeping com-
pany with a jiggety muse of low character
and vulgar manners. His new £BOO a year
should be sufficient to reform him.
Another old Sydney building with ancient
memories hanging to it has just been pulled
down. It was in Pitt-street, one door from
King-street. In old days it was a hive of
lawyers. Sam Terry built it. The corner,
now a pub, was then a Bible depQt. Thur-
low, M.L.C.. Mayor of Sydney, had his office
there; so, of course, did his partner, Stephen
Campbell Brown, also a prominent poli-
tician. Next door, Thomas Fisher had his
boot shop—the same humble tradesman who
provided Sydney University with its magni-
ficent Fisher Library. In a room attached
to his shop, George Robert Nichols kept his
law books; and there it was that James
Martin, the greatest Judge N. S. Wales has
ever had, “read” his law.
The late J. Quayle Wood, who died at
Milson’s Point, Sydney, last week, aged 63,
was born at Bumbaldry station, between
Cowra and Grenfell (N.S.W.U—a property
belonging to William Redfern Watt, who re-
presented Carcoar in the Leg. Assembly as
far back as 1859-62. Mr. Watt was a
nephew of Dr. Redfern, who came to Botany
Bay for his small share in the Mutiny at the
Nore in 1797. Mr. J. Butler Wood, still liv-
ing at 93, left Bumbaldry and settled at
Brundah Creek, nearer Grenfell, where he
and his sons went in for sheep farming. In
1881 the father retired, and two of the sons,
J.Q. and Philip, took the property over,
developed it, and then started to grow wheat
on shares. After G. H. Greene, they were
the first to do it in a big way. The property
was a while ago sold to a syndicate for sub-
division purposes.
“The Wild Colonial Pressman” :
With a fairly wide experience I reckon Alfred
Deakin one of the most difficult men to report
in Australasia. It is not so much his speed (although
he could pile it up when he liked) as his meander-
ings in parentheses and his devotion to unusual
words. Very often he was disappointed in reports
of his speeches, and was inclined to think impatiently
of shorthanders whose worst fault lay in following
him too closely in his picturesque wingings in the
heights of oratory. If Deakin was confronted with
some notes, portions of which have never been trans-
cribed, he dbe a surprised politician. The most ex-
citing moments in my experience of Deakin were at
the close of a big speech in the Sydney Centenary
Hall. The press gang had the cable conveying the
news that it had been decided to send America’s
White Fleet to Australia, and fired it up to him. He
was surprised, but he surprised the packed audience
more when he let himself go. He swept them off
their balance with an explosion of metaphorical fire-
works. At the press tables we got only flashes of
it amidst the cheers and yells and general hallelujah.
It was a great performance, and I lost my hat and
my last tram.
The strenuous fight of the Freetrade
papers to put Cook into Deakin’s place as
leader of the crumbling Fusion recalls Joe’s
start in politics. Joe was a check-weigher
or something of the sort for the Lithgow
coal-miners when the first Labor party
arrived in the Ma State. The local P.L.L.
was mostly addicted to chapel-going prac-
tices, and the local Methody parson was
chosen as the Labor candidate. But he fell
sick, and Joe, as his most fluent “local
preacher,” naturally took the stipendiary
preacher’s electioneering pulpit. That first
lot of Laborites were mostly men from the
country, who felt a bit awkward in their new
surroundings (there weren’t any barristers
in the party in those days) ; so Joe, having
won the Lithgow or Hartley seat, and hav-
ing rather more education than the rest,
and being an experienced local preacher, was
given the job of leader.
Alexander Gray, who passed out on Janu-
ary 3, after 60 years’ work in Geelong, was
one of the men who made that much-libelled
place something of a manufacturing centre.
Full of Scotch grit, he established flour and
woollen mills (the latter as far back as
1869), fellmongeries and tanneries, besides
taking a hand in a ropeworks. One way
and another he amassed considerable dirt
and other wealth, but distributed a lot of
it in the best manner—without advertise-
ment.
UNSATISFYING FODDER.

THE ELEPHANT : “Now, I wonder how long
they expect me to exist on this testi-
monial?”
1 iji, the other day, got its first home-
grown K.C.; it has had some persons en-
titled to wear silk with their horse-hair, but
they_ have always hitherto been in the public
service. H. M. Scott, the new man, was
born at Levuka only about 30 years ago, and
learned his lessons —some of them—at Syd-
ney Grammar School. He is a good “sport”
and one of the popular men of the piebald
islands.
ancient Melbourne city freeholder, L.
M. Cantlon, passed out the other day. He
was the owner of Cole’s Book Arcade and
the Bull and Mouth Hotel —the hostelry
where in its early days the rugged grand-
father of Rupert Clarke used to put up when
he came to town and insist on swallowing
his food and drink from a tin plate and a
pannikin. The propputy that' had been
bought for a trifle at Melbourne’s first land
sale was valued at £98,000 for probate, and
alt of it goes to two married daughters of
Oantlon, both of whom live in Scotland.
Tommy White—he was always Tommy
was one of those old-timers of'the A.W.U.
who took to the office-work of the big
shearers union, not because it was their
particular line, but because honest men
with first-hand knowledge of the bushman’s
life, were wanted in the responsible places,
xhe tremendous work and worry of the
lighting years, and the constant grind of the
comparatively calm ones, helped to kill
Donald MacdoneH. Now Tommy White has
gone—died, aged 56, while train-travelling
from Jamestown (S.A.) to Adelaide on Jan-
A a w tt * He - wa i actin S general sec. of the
A.YV U. during the long final illness of the
much-loved Macdonell, and was afterwards
confirmed in the position, which he held in
feydney till a few months ago. Formerly he
had been sec. for many years of the big
Bourke branch. His general style was that
ot a man who likes to be sure of things, and
, Quicker-moving spirits sometimes
chafed under his “Wait a bit,” they saw
that it had its good side, and will keep a
special corner for friendly memories of him.
A send-off to a good old pen-hack:—
Garnet Walch, whose name was one time as
familiar in bohemian Melbourne’s mouth as Marcus
Se ° The at B ° X HiU Cemetery
„ j, er The present generation knew him
not, and with the exception of two or three relatives,
R. S. Smythe was the only mourner at the fiftieral
it is said. The Much Travelled showman used his
secretary of MeiTAtb Ret hiS °u ld friend appointed
secretary ot Melb. Athenvum, whose committee con-
sisted of solemn Wowserian folk, distrustful of any-
n as , soclated Wlth the theatre. Garnet made an
excellent secretary, and for a while the committee

taking that good, grave man behind the scenes on
lntroducin g him to the Ham-
itl “d Macbeths of the period. But when some mem-
bers of the committee found that their sec. was writing
a panto, for the Royal, they desired him to choose
between Respectability and the Stage, whereupon
Walsh resigned. He was a bright journalist in his d ? av
and probably the pantos, he wrote for the original
Wilhamsoman firm—“ The Sleeping Beautv,” nro-
duced at the Royal in 1885, was the last that had
JV S na f? e f eat ured on the bill—contained better stuff
dops modern shapeless Christmas show, which
doesn t finish with a harlequinade. He did a lot of
other work for the stage. The adaptation of “Rob-
bf'^him ndei A lto m n ’ pr ° du £. ed by Dampier, was made
bv him. Also, he and Dampier collaborated in a
version of “Monte Cristo,” and they fixed up an
extraordmary circus drama for Dr. Carver, when that
“W-m nt , sho ? te £ and mighty fine man brought his

“Billy B.”: Deakin suffers greatly from
lack of digestive powers. That’s his trouble
just as it was ex-Governor-General Hope-
toun’s. This is how he put it to John See
once : “You’d think I was a very fortunate
man. I've got money, estates, position, chil-
dren of my own —everything in that respect
has been good to me.” “Yes, my lord,” says
the attentive See. “But,” dammit,” cries
Hopetoun, snapping down the blind as it
were, “I’ve got no stomach.” At least, he
didn’t exactly say “stomach.”
“Old John” Robertson, one of
the two most picturesque figures
in the politics of N. S. Wales, had
plenty of chances to make monej
while he was in office; but he
scorned every suggestion of the
sort. Out of one proposed deal
alone he could have made £20,000
or £30,000 for himself; but he
sprang like a wolf upon a man
who hinted that such a thing might
be done, and gave the public the
benefit of the opportunity. Natur-
ally he died dog-poor, and left his
family in rather a bad way. One
of the daughters married, and
struck the awful misfortune of
having five children born deaf and
dumb. They have been able to do
a little for themselves, but not
much, and their mother has had to
always help them along; but now
the old lady is 70, and the struggle
has become well nigh insupport-
able. A fund has therefore been
started by people who want to do
something for the afflicted grand-
children of an unselfish man who
did much for N. S. Wales; and
contributions can be sent to T.
H. Nesbitt, the Towm Clerk of Sydney, at
the Town Hall; he is one of the joint sec-
retaries.
There are some strenuous old journalists
in Maoriland, and T. W. Leys, editor of the
Auckland Star (daily), is notable. The
other day he celebrated his 50th year in
journalism. Born in England 62 years ago,
he was taken to M.L. by his parents in boy-
hood and almost immediately began to learn
the mechanical side of a newspaper on the
old Southern Cross. After three years, he
found his way into the writing dept, and
gradually worked his way to the sub-editor’s
chair. He relinquished it to do similar duty
on the Star when that paner was founded,
and in 1876 became its editor. He has been
at the same job ever since, and shows no sign
of loosening up a very sturdy grip
of things. Part of his grip is on the
proprietorship, and that helps to find some of
the wealth he occasionally distributes when
a good cause needs oiling. When Ballance
was Premier, Leys was offered a seat in the
Legislative Council, but, though he is a con-
firmed politician, he prefers to make hi*
moves out of sight, and declined the offer.

There is likely to be a “temperance” rally
in Victoria, particularly in the R.C. Diocese
of Melbourne, when the new Coadjutor-
Archbishop arrives from Maynooth in a
month or so. Already there is a pretty
strong no-drink party among the clergy of
the Archdiocese, and Dr. Mannix, as a
pledged water-man, will naturally put him-
self at the head of it.
A VISION OF STRENGTH AND BEAUTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“How did Mr. McGowen look in his Court dress?”
“Just splendid. He’s so big and strong. 1 wish
he would wear it oftener. Lord Chelmsford thinks
he looks so well in it.”
■ —Sunday paper interview with Mrs. McGowen.
Yes, Life is a drab proceeding
Through a vale that is rough and dim ;
Some color and joy it’s needing;
We could do with a sight of Jim.
We are hungering—yea, we’re thirsting
To set eyes on his gold-laced coat,
And his silken stockings bursting
With the calves that are now remote.
Most men in tubular trousers
Like elephant’s legs go past;
Adonis, with lean-shanked Wowsers,
Is mislaid in the pageant vast;
But bravely in satin breeches
Lo 1 a Vision of Strength goes by,
With faith in the straining stitches
And pride in his conquering eye.
Packed muscles like mountain boulders
’Neath the beautiful broadcloth slip,
When he swings his mighty shoulders
And the tempered blade at his hip.
Oh, nothing can stop or stay him —•
There is nothing better on view^
Till Cohen crawls up to slay him
With his elegant I O U!

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Commonwealth Bank took off its coat
on Monday morning and started the savings-
bank business throughout the Commonwealth. The
ordinary banking business will follow next Monday.
There will be 1891 savings-bank agencies, nearly all
of them at post offices ; but for the present the Com-
monwealth Bank will have to depend on private
banks to do the other part of its business outside the
capitals. The “Wales” will be the general agent; in
Queensland the Q.N. will have the collecting agency,
in S. Aus. the Bank of Adelaide, in W.A. the Western
Australian Bank, and in Tasmania the local Com-
mercial. The Savings Bank is offering 3 p.c. up to
£3OO. For fixed deposits the ordinary branch offers
2 p.c. for six months, 3 p.c. for 12 months, and Si
p.c. for two years. It belies a rumor and makes no
offer for current account money; but it makes this
concession—it charges nothing for keeping a current
account unless the account falls below £5O. If that
limit is passed it at once charges the usual ss. In
the official circular nothing is said about the charge
for accounts that are not in credit. An account
£5OOO in debit might be —and in ordinary circum-
stances would be —vastly more profitable than one
which hovered between £5O and £lOO in credit;
vet, apparently, a charge of ss. is to be made on all
debit accounts. No doubt the difficulty would be to
discriminate between the bad debit accounts and the
good ones. Ordinary banking business of every sort
is to be undertaken—including, of course, advances
on all the usual banking securities.
Tasmania is the onlv State which has accepted the
Commonwealth’s offer for the taking-over of the ex-
isting savings banks. The scheme accepted by Tas-
mania (and still open to the other States) is some-
thing like this. The Commonwealth Bank will take
over all assets and all liabilities. The assets consist
mostly of the State’s 1 O U’s. The States may get
those I O U’s back on handing over their equivalent
in new debentures, secured as usual on the general
assets of the States. The Commonwealth offers to
accept 3J p.c. debentures at 95 in place of I O U’s
carrying 3| p.c. and 4 p.c. debentures at par for
those carrying more than 34 p.c. ; debentures to run
from 20 to 40 years. A 1 p.c. sinking fund is to be
also provided, to be used in reduction of the deben-
tures issued. That money is, however, to be lent to
the States at current rates if it is not required for
the repayment of depositors. This is carrying things
to an extreme in the struggle to propitiate the can-
tankerous States. It is obvious that it isn’t going to
be a real sinking fund at all. The thing works out
this way. The State has borrowed monev from the
people through the State Savings Bank. " The Com-
monwealth undertakes to pay back the people. As
security, the State which has borrowed the money
gives the Commonwealth certain debentures. The
S back 1 p.a., which the Common-
wealth may use to pay the people whose money it is.
But if the people are not waiting on the doorstep for
the money, the States take the money again. The
people may come in in a flock in a few months, and
the Commonwealth must pay them on the nail ; but
no matter how much it has to pay it can’t call on
the States for any money till the next 1 p.c. is due.
If they weren’t quite mad, and if there was no other
lion on the track, the States would accept that offer
But their trouble is not about the monev they have
borrowed, but about the monev they hope to borrow
If the Commonwealth controls the Savings Banksj
their dread is that they won’t be able to dip into the
till, collar the people’s savings, and put them into
the good old “permanent and reproductive works” to
quite the same extent as they have been doing lately.

Though still the Benjamin among Australian banks,
this little one is growing. For a good many years
after it moved down from North Queensland, it got
along with a paid capital of £lOO,OOO. That wasn’t
very much ; but, then, 15 years ago its deposits were
only £182,800. To-day they amount to £906,214,
and bills, etc., bring the total liabilities up to
£984,825. In view of the steady yet highly satis-
factory growth of the business, it was decided last
year to get in another £62,500 of capital The
bank was then in 50,000 shares of £7, paid to
£2. A call of £1 ss. per share was made, payable
by instalments. Though at the end of the half-year
only £31,250 had fallen due, £51,437 had been
paid—a pretty good indication of the shareholders’
confidence in their bank. This increase of capital
explains the jump in the dividend figures for the six
months. Some of the new capital could hardly have
been put to profitable use straight away; hence,
naturally, the profit, though easily a record, does
not look so well when calculated on canital and
reserves combined. This shows what these funds
have earned of late: —-
June, 1908 £6 0 10 p.c. Dec., 1910 £8 0 2 p.c.
Dec., 1908 612 1 „ June, 1911 717 9,,
June, 1909 7 3 7 „ Dec., 1911 817 9 ,
Dec., 1909 712 5 „ June, 1912 916 7 „
June, 1910 712 5 „ Dec., 1912 811 2 „
In the circumstances £8 11s. 2d. is remarkably
good, because the capital is taken as at the end of
the half-year, whereas an unknown quantity of the
new capital was paid in late in the term, and none
of it was available right through the term. Things
were bad with the North Queensland once; but the
country recovered quickly, dividends were kept very
moderate, and a lot of hard writing-down was done.
It is probable that, having got into the writing-down
habit, the management is still dropping a bit into
the hidden stocking whenever an unexpected stroke
of good fortune comes along. Judged by the interest
return, there can’t be anything wrong with the assets
nowadays.
The next table shows how things have moved in
12 months and 10 years:—

D e p°sits have shrunk a trifle —money withdrawn
probably on account of the new capital, in which
case the bank’s resources are none the less. Anyway,
trom shareholders and the public it had £1,064,530
months ago, and now it has £1,146,261. The
public s money in the business is now equal to about
£o 10s. for every £1 of the shareholders’ visible
funds; and that is well within the safety limit. The
cash and liquid assets represent 43 p.c. of the lia-
bilities, and that is a good way inside the safety
line, too. It means that the bank could, even on its
present resources, take a bit more advance business
if the right securities were offering. Like most other
banks it has no doubt been going very slow in the
sugar districts, where it was born, the sugar in-
dustry has been, and ought to be, highly profitable;
but when it comes to the future —the thing which
the bank has to consider when it is a matter of
helping a farmer or would-be farmer with some
cash—the uncertainty of the last two or three vears
has been paralysing. Banks, like most other busi-
ness concerns, don’t care much what conditions are
imposed on them, or on the industries on which they
depend, so long as they know' what those condi-
tions are going to be, and can figure accordingly
for a few years ahead. When they can’t figure ahead,
it means that they either turn the business down or
charge a stiff price to cover unknown risks. This
is what has been happening in connection with the
sugar industry; and it is particularly rough on the
little man, the struggler, the starter, who has per-
force to lean up against a financial prop or keep out
of the business altogether.

That gives some idea of how Australia and Maoriland
can pull themselves together. There were few cos.
that got into worse trouble in the crash that followed
the borrow-and-boom bubble of the ’Bo’s and early
’9o’s. So much of the often-doubtful blessing of
foreign capital was poured into the country that
values of squattages and farms —squattages especially
■ were inflated ridiculously by men who could borrow
too much and too easily. Then the owner of the
foreign money got uneasy and wanted it back; and
drought and rabbits came; and prices of wool, etc.,
fell; and on the overstocked country (overstocked in
the struggle to pay interest on inflated values) the
losses were terrible. Of this co.’s capital £1,042,142,
or about four-fifths, had to be written off as lost;
even the debenture-holders were called on to forego
£1,448,325.
In the natural order of things the debenture-holders
would simply have taken possession. But probably
they were not organised; anyway, they concluded
that the men who had led them into the soup were
the best qualified to lead them out again. So the
shareholders, after writing off the beforementioned
£1,042,142 were permitted to retain a paid interest
amounting to £135,000 or thereabouts in the con-
cern. But they were tied up in various ways, and
the payment of divs. was next-door to impossible.
When, therefore, it began to look as though very
decent profits might be made presently, a compromise
was sanctioned. Part of the debenture debt was
represented by a third mortgage, and the poor
beggars who held that stock had a ghastly time,
as the top lines of the table show. It was therefore
agreed between all parties in 1903 that, if conditions
were made such that the shareholders could get divi-
dends, the third debenture-holders might take as much
in excess of their then maximum of 44 p.c. as the
shareholders got in excess of 5 p.c. That is how it
comes about that in the last few years the third
debentures have had 7 p.c., while the shareholders
have had 74 p.c.
Notwithstanding these just-mentioned payments,
the profits and recoveries have been so great, while the
country has been going to the dogs on account of
Labor rule, that in the past three years £265,012 has
been added to reserves. In such circumstances there
was naturally a call for a rearrangement of interests.
And on the part of the shareholders the call was all
the shriekier because, while their shares were only
10s. paid, there Was a liability of £8 10s. on them.
The concern was obviously lop-sided or top-heavy—
£l3s,349 of capital owned by the shareholders who,
within certain limits, bossed the show;
£3,296,337 owned by debenture-holders who
played second (or third or fourth) fiddle. Hence
during the past few months a scheme of reconstruc-
tion has been incubating, and the last mail or two
brought word that it had got the sanction of the
Court. The details are not clear in every respect,
but this is the gist of it:—•
(1) First debentures ( £2,350,000) and second de-
bentures ( £540,764) ; total £2,890,764 carrying
4 p.c.—These are to be turned into £1,000,000 of
first and £1,000,000 of second mortgage debentures.
The balance ( £890,764) is to be paid off out of
share capital.
(2) Third debentures ( £405,573). —These are
worth 7 p.c. p.a. at present, as mentioned above. In
place of debentures pref. shares are to be issued,
£175 worth for every £lOO of present debentures.
This will mean in all £709,752.
(3) Shares. —The share capital is £135,349. Of
the shares 208,942 are £9, paid to 10s.; 60,000
are 10s. fully paid. The £9 shares will be reduced
to £5 10s., and the unpaid £5 will be called up.
This will bring in over £1,000,000. Part of that
money will be used to pay off £890,764 of the first
debentures. But, apparently, some of the ordinarv
share capital is to be turned into pref. capital. Any-
way, as explained to the Court, the pref. capital and
the ordinary capital are to be £1,000,000 each. The
old and th° new thus work out as follows:
Old. New.

Total ..£3,889,208! Total ..£4,000,000
There is a discrepancy of £110,792 there, £724 of
which is represented by capital paid in advance of
calls. Perhaps the full amount of the new pref. shares
won’t be issued. Also, the interest payable on the pref.
shares isn’t anywhere mentioned in the reports
available. Presumably the premium payable on the
third debentures (75 p.c.) comes out of the re-
serves. Part of the assets of the co. consists of all
the shares in the N.Z. Land Association. This
concern is to be transferred bodily to the recon-
structed N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., and
the Association’s nice little reserves will of course
swell the parent co.’s.
Getting back to the past year’s work and figures,
this is how the latter compare with those of a
couple of previous years:—

Other assets . . 229,619 186,921 209,949
Properties and stock have thus been reduced to a
comparative trifle. Certainly that is good; but it
means that the big profits made during the past
few years out of the sale of written-down properties
can’t be repeated. The money realised, as well as
the accumulated profits, have gone into advances;
and there is still a lot of work to be done in that
way—the work of financing rural industries.

Thus for the past half-year £11,250 is paid away
in divs., £10,560 is put by, and £1267 is written
off against depreciation of plant. Nothing has lately been
written off freehold premises; the explanation being,
no doubt, that the unearned increment of the land
has more than counterbalanced the depreciation of
the buildings. Even so, it is doubtful whether some-
thing should not be written off. Buildings are worn
out in the process of earning a co.’s profits, and
leave to be replaced; and when a co. sets about
the replacement it finds that for all practical pur-
poses the increase in the value of the land has
made no difference —so long, that is, as it uses that
land for the purposes only of its business. In other
words, it can’t pay the building contractor with the
increment unless it sells part or all of the land.
However, the Herald Co. could make a very liberal
allowance for depreciation of premises and still
show astonishingly good results. When it took
over the two papers it paid no less than £198,000
for the goodwill. Thus, of the £250,000 of capital,
only £52,000.was represented by anything visible to
any eye except that of faith. During the past
eight years £87,185 of the intangible asset has
been replaced by very tangible ones. The change
in the position in the past six years is perhaps shown
clearer still by this comparison:—

Thus in six years the co., besides paying its divi-
dend, has put £28,133 into good city freehold, and
has laid by £41,784 in hard cash or gilt-edged
securities—mostly hard cash, on fixed deposit. It
has still some distance to travel before it can show
20s. per £1 share in hard assets; but the share-
holders are probably not anticipating liquidation
and a division of assets just yet.

This society has just had its 50th birthday, and,
talking over its history, it remarks: “Up to
the present not a bad debt has been in-
curred.” That is a remarkable record, and probably
accounts for the directors’ apparent contempt for
such a thing as reserves. Nevertheless, the manage-
ment might well remember something about a well
and an old familiar pitcher that was broken at last.
No building society ever ought to have a bad debt,
of course; but things don’t always happen as they
ought to. The salvation of the society hitherto has
been that there has never—in modern times, any-
way—been a bad, sudden slump in Perth. Yet in
the early days of the society it was once so very sick
that the Government was implored to take the busi-
ness over and run it in conjunction with the Savings
Bank; and it was only because the Government
wouldn’t or couldn’t “arrange the requisite loan to
enable the society to be dissolved” that the doors
were kept open. The table that comes next shows-
the amount at present outstanding and a few other
things:—

Other assets 980 1,439 5,299 3,873 1,860
The advances made during the past year have thus
been unusually large. The cash actuallv paid out to
borrowers has been £24,306, all or nearly all, no
doubt, on new securities. If anything serious hap-
pened to Perth, and there was a bad drop in values,
the society would thus be in great danger of having
a lot of securities thrown on its hands; and, since
its reserves are so preposterously small, the capital
would be in danger.
While there has been no bad accident, the share-
holders have been doing extraordinarily well. Four
shillings a week paid for eight years ( £B3 Bs.) buys a
£lOO share through the accumulation of the money
at. 5 p.c. The bonus has been additional ; during the
past year the shares which have matured have drawn
£l4O 16s. 9d. This shows the record for a few
vears past:—

1906 .. 138 3 9 1911 .. 139 9 11
1907 .. 13512 4 1912 .. 14616 9
It illustrates the amazing power of compound inter-
est ; for neither interest nor bonus is payable till
the maturity of the share. Still, even compound
interest couldn’t do it unless the investment in Perth
mortgages brought in a very fine return. As things
settle down in the West the tendency of that return
will, however, probably be downward.

This co. was formed to take over the photo-supply
business run by Baker and Rouse, and Baker and
Rouse Prop., Ltd., with an interest in the Eastman
Kodak Co., U.S.A. It was a good, clean flotation, and
the accounts have throughout retained their good,
clean appearance. Thus the first line on the assets side
of the balance-sheet runs this way: “Goodwill, trade
marks, trade names and processes, Nil. (No value
has been placed on these or anything other than
tangible assets.)” Moreover, the reserves—that is to
say., accumulated profits—apparently include nothing
in the shape of a depreciation allowance for actual
wear and tear, that allowance having throughout been
written right off. Even the buildings are written
down, though most of them are new: 2 p.c. of their
cost has been struck off during the year. This indi-
cates very prudent accountancy, and suggests that the
reserves are very real. Probably the co. has in tan-
gible assets a good deal more than £39,781 in ex-
cess of its capital. It used to have nearly £28,000
in Eastman Kodak shares, and still has £15,038 (at
cost). Numerous sales of the stock have been made,
and in 1910 and 1911 “profit on sale of investments”
—evidently this Eastman investment —amounted to
£7402. The £15,038, therefore, probably means a
present value of another £lO,OOO. Certainly mer-
chandise stocks represent £90,203 of the total
£228,649 of assets, and it is impossible to check
that big item ; but if you can judge what you can’t
see by what you can see, things are all right. The
next biggest item in the accounts is freehold pro-
perty, £59,902, on which there is a plaster of
£10,000; the latter and current trade debts
( £21,367) represent all the liabilities. The ac-
counts altogether leave a very nleasant taste in the
mouth.

In 1909, the co.’s 21st year, a dividend of 7-i p.c.
was paid, along with a bonus of 12s. 6d. per £1
share. At the same time a fresh issue of shares was
made, absorbing the 12s. 6d. In other words, the
capital was increased from £18,598 to £30,000 by
the cheerful process of capitalising reserves. Ap-
parently there had been previous transfers, as the
capital to start with was under £lO,OOO. The past
year’s profit, calculated on even the £30,000 basis,
gives a very gaudy . return. But it is doubtful
whether anything like it can be made this year. The
co., like most in the wheat-handling and milling
business, is a speculator. It bought grain heavilv,
and the directors had to find just on £60,000 to
finance things. The market rose, and the co. un-
loaded at a big profit. As at November 30 its stocks
were low—just as well, for the market has been
easier since. If the management believes that there
is an improvement ahead, it has no doubt been buy-
ing heavily again. And that’s where the gamble
comes in ; for no man can say definitely what the
market is going to be. It looks as though there
should be a recovery after the first rush is over,
speaking generally. Thousands of farmers must sell
as soon as they have harvested in December and
January; thousands more prefer to sell rather than
go to the expense of storing. In January, 1912, mill-
ing wheat averaged 3s. 74d. per bushel in Sydney,
and crept up to 4s. 6jd. in October, 1912. Yet it
by no means always works out like that. In Decem-
ber, 1909, the average price in Sydney was 4s. Id.,
and in January, 1910, 4s. 3d. By June it was down
to 3s. 4d. Again in December, 1910, the price was
3s. Bd. ; by March, 1911, it was down to 3s. 3d.
These figures suggest how uncertain the trade is. If
the country miller is buying for a rise, he is all right,
if the rise happens; but if he holds off, expecting a
fall, he is handicapped, inasmuch as he may presently
be unable to get his requirements locally ; and that
means extra freight. However, he seems to mostly
do very well indeed —largely because he isn’t under
any illusions as to the nature of the business, and
doesn’t burst out into 50 p.c. dividends when he has
a fat year. He capitalises his reserves certainly;
but that doesn’t mean paying out money—at any
rate, not in a lump. In this case, notwithstanding
the capitalised reserves, there is a feeling that the
co. is over-trading, and the directors are considering
how they should set about increasing their capital
from £30,000 to £60,000. They may take the easy
course of capitalising more reserves; but it is to be
hoped they won’t do much in that way. A co. in this
business ought to have a strong contingency fund.
On past records shareholders can get a very good re-
turn on any moderate amount of capital they may
put into the business, and the contingency fund,
while earning money just as much as if it were capi-
tal, will protect the principal.

Last year Australia made a good show
as a producer of copper, though far too much of it
was sent away in the unrefined state, to provide work
for the foreigner. Mount Morgan was the big gun,
with 8818 tons refined at Kembla. Great Cobar sent
away 6654 tons of blister, more heavily charged with
silver and gold than in any previous year. Mount
Elliott did a brilliant run, producing nearly as much
jhe red metal as Great Cobar. To their disgrace
both of these concerns shipped their metal unrefined.
" allaroo and Moonta emphasise the improved mar-
kets by paying increased dividends. This co. is well
up to 6000 tons for the year. Mount Lvell, some-
what out of form, produced 3124 tons of fine copner
in the half-year to September 30, and looks like
giving the Great Cobar a close run for second place
when it gets into full work again.

for an issue of £150,000 worth of 6 p.c. debentures;
this was in August, just after the accounts had
closed. At July 31 the co. owed £77,829. No
Profit and Loss account is published ; but manufac-
turing account shows a debit of £28,288, although
only half the administration expenses have been
charged to it. The outlay was £61,343; sales and
stocks represented £33,055, leaving a loss of £28,288.
“Stocks of oils, etc.,” are, by the way, taken in
“at estimated cost,” which is a poor way of doing
it. In a statement of assets and liabilities, share-
holders don’t want to know what the asset cost; they
want to know what it is worth. The Murrurundi de-
posits are not very large, but they are rich, and there
is no reason at all why, well worked, they should not
pay handsomely. It remains to be seen whether they
will be worked well. Some of the estimates of
revenue put forward hitherto have certainly been
ridiculous.

Broken Hill exported minerals valued on
the spot at £4,186,200 last year, which is £1,086,091
more than the record for 1911. Dividends totalled
£1,529,417. The big figures are due to the boom in
metals; the increase in tonnage is comparatively
slight. Last year 747,077 tons of all classes of ore
and concentrates were railed away, an increase of
only 10,967 tons. During the 12 months 279,915
tons of lead concentrates, valued at £2,769,170, were
railed, an increase of 2952 tons ip weight and
£787,731 in value. Zinc concentrates weighed
433,054 tons, value £1,320,666, an increase of
11,023 tons and £273,646. It is significant that
there should have been such a small increase in ton-
nage, in spite of the vastly-increased expenditure
and the boom in metals. Assuming that the
279,915 tons of lead concentrates returned an average
of 60 units of lead, the Barrier produced 167,949
tons of that metal last year, irrespective of the few
thousands of tons to be recovered from zinc concen-
trates.
Bellinger, general manager of Great
Cobar, left Australia last week in pursuit of a holi-
day from the weary struggle to get and keep an
adequate staff of good miners, and also with an out-
nut that refuses to travel in the right direction.
Meanwhile Danvers Power, from Sydney, is in charge.
Last year was responsible for only' three decent
monthly outputs, and immediate prospects are not
encouraging, as the current quarter will be cut into
by holidays. It is reported that the Minerals Separa-
tion plant, on its trial run with the Chesney tailings,
proved an unqualified success, and that some wonder-
ful figures have been sent on to the directors in Lon-
don. Engineer Herzig, examining on behalf of
European interests, was favorably impressed with
Cobar affairs, and rumor has it that a deal is now
being made with the 15,000 reserve shares. Capital
at date of last report was £925,000 and debentures
£724,000 —an awesome array. By the way, the
time is over-ripe for something to be heard about the
accounts for the year ended last June. The current
year is more than half gone.
Cadia (N.S.W.), after a lot of spasmodic
but short-lived efforts, is now seriously on the trail
with a blast furnace that has supplemented the old
and wasteful small reverbs. As a result of a fair
amount of development work, there are respectable
reserves to keep the furnace going with 800 tons of
ore per week. The ore is not abundantly rich, is low
in sulphur and horribly high in alumina, with ten-
dencies towards producing pig-iron instead of copner.
The mining is a battle against weight of overburden,
as the deposit has only a small dip. Above it there
is iron ore, plentiful and of good grade, but this may
not be touched as filling. Into the bargain there is
the magnificent Canoblas Hill rising from the mine,
on the wav to Orange. Because of its iron deposits
Cadia made claim to a railway, but the claim has
not yet been sympathetically received.

Occidental, outside Cobar, is having
trouble which, unlike the plant, is not of its own
making. The mine is closed down for want of rain.
An issue of more capital was recently made, funds
being needed to re-organise the newly-erected treat-
ment plant. Not that this has so soon got obsolete ;
but it never had a chance of doing good work with
its disappointing string of variegated units. The
mine appears to be all right, but better management
is needed. Dividends have sadly wilted since metal-
lurgist Chappie departed. An offer of eight to nine
shillings a share for the mine is said to have been re-
fused by the company. It was understood that it
came from a source in some way connected with the
late metallurgist.

The December yield was, however, the highest for
any month of last year, and the outputs from several
new mines, which have either just started crushing
or are about to do so, may produce a temporary turn
in the tide. To date the State’s output amounts to
25,738,090 fine oz., valued at £110,332,149. Of
this wealth 10 mines have produced more than one-
half :

As all these leviathans have either passed their prime
or are showing signs of breaking up, and as there are
no others of the same class to take their places, any
increase in returns is not likely to be very large or
very long. *
To the end of November Westralia had
produced £3,123,861 worth of minerals other than
gold. #
Associated Northern (W.A.) reports that
things continue to run smoothly at Ora Banda ; also
that a strenuous effort is being made to put 9000
tons through the plant this month. Something cheer-
ful is also said about the new oxidised development
at the No. 4 level. On November 24 it was an-
nounced that 20ft. of driving had exposed ore worth
325. 6d. per ton for a width of 50in. About three
weeks later it was stated that a further extension of

Gw alia Consolidated (W.A.) passed its
accounts and agreed to a reconstruction scheme at a
meeting held in London on December 4. 8., M. and
Lo. out of the management.
For the year ended July last Kalgurli’s
report shows that the average return was 40s. 7d. per
ton. Since then it has been 395. The amount distri-
buted m dividends during the year exceeded the work-
mg profit by £32. As in the case of most of the
other honestly-worked mines at Kalgoorlie, costs
show a tendency to grow, the result of dearer water
and fuel and greater depth.
About a year ago North Kalgurli (W.A.)
down its manager’s suggestion to spend
£2OOO on deep development, and let tributors have
a go instead. The latter struck a few rich dabs ; but
as the average was not good enough, work ceased.
.Now the manager again urges the co. to do a bit on
its own account ; but with erratic shoots and uncer-
tain values staring it in the face, the Board is hesi-
tating.
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) claims to
have put years on to its life by finding two new
lodes, and a local paper declares that the mine is
looking better than it did two years ago. Something
is also said about a probable jump of a shilling in
the price of shares—which gives an impression that
the information is loaded. At present the co. is
treating the second-largest monthly tonnage on the
field, but aggregate profits are not likely to be suffi-
cient to allow much of a cut among shareholders.
Carr-Boyd has induced some Melbourne
people to find money to probe the Cosmo' Newbery
leases (W.A.). A Smythesdale (Vic.) expert is
reported to have visited the outlandish region, and
got encouraging results from samples. Though with-
out much hope, The Bulletin wishes old “Pot-
jostler” luck.
* * * *
Burbanks Main Lode (W.A.) met share-
holders in a cheery frame of mind on December 5,
when a number of “encouraging features” were re-
ferred to. Amongst these were increased ore re-
serves, new ore discovery at the No. 5 level and the
improved appearance of the main shoot at depth. A
gentle hint was, however, given shareholders that
they must not expect the increased returns of the
past few months to continue, as the output had only
been run up to pay for new machinery out of current
revenue. On the whole the mine is looking well, and
a prosperous career seems assured for some time to
come.
* * * *
Where there’s life there’s houe. In the
last 15 years considerably more than half a million
sterling has been extracted from quartz in Menzies’
Consolidated ; but owing to receipts being monoed
up in working expenses, pickings, etc., no money has
been available for dividends. The past year has,
however, witnessed an improvement in values at depth,
and at the No. 14 level the main shoot' has been
proved for a length of nearly 500 ft., and a width of
4ft. averages lOldwt. The management thinks
prospects are brighter than for years past, and there
is still a chance of shareholders getting something.
Having issued the whole of its capital, the
Board of Whim Well Copper Co. (W.A.) is thinking
out a new scheme. It reckons there is every justifica-
tion for making an increase, as “even then the pro-
perty will represent considerably more than the issued
capital.” The Bulletin suspected that something
like this would happen, and said so at the time the
co. was paying away in dividends money that it
should have held on to for equipment and develop-
ment.
The taking over by a London co. of Mount
Oxide is practically completed, the co.’s financial
man, Earle Hermann, having signed up with Edmund
Davis, of the very robust Consolidated Goldfields
group. The new co. will have a capital of
£475,000, of which the present co. receives
£200,000 in shares, and working capital of
£150,000 is provided. The Queensland Govern-
ment is ready to permit the co. to link itself up
with the railroad to Cuthbert. the co. building the
line and the Government providing the material and
giving very long credit at 5 p.c., while retaining
the right to resume the line at 5 p.c. ov.er construc-
tion cost. Latest developments at the mine are
good: values and widths increase as the level pro-
gresses north towards the iron mountain. Appar-
ently some poorer things are to burden Oxide’s
richness, as there is already talk of increasing the
capital sufficiently to take in the Cuthbert group
and the Dobbin, Crusader and other mines held bv
the very lazy Queensland Copper Freeholds Ltd. The
Dobbin, at any rate, has a shoot of ore so rich
that the Government should break the Copper Free-
holds Co.’s loafing habit.
North Australian Exploration Co.’s Mount
Lindsay mine is to be floated into a 150.000 share
co of 10s. each; 30,000 are in reserve. North Aus.
Exploration Co. gets 60,000 paid up, and provides
underwriting out of that; 60,000 are offered at
2s. Mount Lindsay is 35 miles from Cloncurry, and
the authorised Macgregor railway will bring it,
within five miles of the line. The mine has shipped
a lot of ore of consistent grade—between 20 and
25 p.c.—and J. H. Fawcett reports it a good thing.
* * * *
At Great Fitzroy (O.) expenditure and
revenue continue to run nearly a dead heat. Revenue
for December was £12,662 ; expenditure, £11.968.
Copper was taken at £BO 4s. 7d. per ton. The re-
turn was 132.76 tons copper, 5430 z. gold and 16090 z.
silver. Costs work out at practically £9O per ton
of copper. Concentration and high costs seem to be
inseparable. But with low-grade stuff what else can
be done? Even Mount Morgan is now talking about
concentration for some of its ore. For the month
5?11 tons were milled at Fitzroy for 979 tons of
concentrates, assaying 11.61 p.c. # copoer and B,7dwt.
e-old The mill recovered 2.1 units of copner per ton
of ore treated ; and’ some of the metal is probable
lost in the subsequent urocesses. With metal at £BO,
2 p.c. copper is worth 325. If the costs swal-
low 32s and a trifle over, as they do. the profit must
come from the gold ; and the separation of gold and
copper costs more than a bit.
Last vear Gvmpie produced less than in
anv vear since 1880. Scottish crushed 86.700 tons
for 24.8130 z„ or 5.72dwt. per ton- dividends,
£l6 500 Scottish is one of the lowest-grade_ mines,
but it is worked very economically on a big our-
put, so ss. per ton makes it possible to pav divi-
dends on 660,000 shares. No 2 South Great Eastern
crushed 10,384 tons for 28400 z ; South Glanmire and
Monkland, 6179 tons for 24850 z. ; North Smithfield,
2302 tons for 26300 z. ; North Columbia, 3134 tons
for 20670 z.; and North Phoenix, 1742 tons for
17780 z.

After providing for the December divi-
dend, St. Mungo, Cloncurrv, had a credit of £l7OO.
During the half-year, to November 30, the mine pro-
duced 761 tons, bulking 23 p.c. copper. Sales realised
£4006, and the ore at the mine and on the road to
market is valued at £3068 ; total, £7074. Expen-
diture at the mine took £2920, so the gross profit
was £4154—£5 9s. per ton of ore and over £23 per
ton of copper. Reserves are very limited, approxi-
mately 900 tons. The shaft is 150 ft. deep, and the
bottom is in hornblende schist, with intrusions of
granite. Further prospecting will be done by winz-
ing below No. 3 level, and the chance of picking up
another deposit of chalcopyrite appears fairly good,
There is £BOO on fixed deposit—not over-much for
a co. in 40,000 shares and a pretty heavy expenditure
staring it in the face.
Mills' United, Charters Towers, has failed
to respond to a very expensive course of development
in the deeps ; but the hope of finding something isn’t
dead, particularly since the Brilliant Deeps struck a
pay shoot at 2600 ft. The total return last year was
£57,752, from 20,341 tons. Shareholders got a six-
penny dividend ( £7500). New Brilliant Freehold
won £52,571 last year from 18,640 tons. It paid
£26,250, or 3s. 6d. per share, which was the largest
distribution on the field. East Mexican, once such a
favorite, crushed 4822 tons for £12,701, but was
unable to divide anything. It shelled out £33,962
m 1911. Marshall’s Queen crushed 5332 tons for
£14,346. Its latest return, 308 tons for an average
of £5 12s. 7d., is more encouraging. Next door the
New Queen Central reports a crushing of 173 tons for
an average of £l2 6s. 3d.
The New Year brings as much cold com-
fort to Walhalla (Vic.) as the Peace Congress in Lon-
don to the dreadful Turk. The Long Tunnel Board, hav-
mg given six months to the search underground, hasn’t
hit up anything worth while. So the word passes
round—“ Resources exhausted. What is to be done
next?” The directors plainly don’t like their job.
Being men with easy arm chairs and seats on the
Boards of well-protected, well-fed cos., they aren’t
the gritty stuff to stir the Walhalla viking out of
his coma. So they recommend that the co. be
wound up. This is banking the fires with a ven-
geance. To justify themselves they point out that
at 3375 ft. the reef is narrow and disturbed and the
average value is low. Nothing, to their mind, will
serve but to put up the shutters and sell off. If
Walhalla agrees to this the biggest gold producer of
Victoria goes into the lethal chamber with hardly a
mourner. To date 756,169 tons from the Long
Tunnel have given 813,0500 z. gold, and paid
£1,283,400 in divs. The old hands who believed
in Cohen’s Reef and in the Long Tunnel are of the
past; there is no one of the Pearson breed to ring in
supporters. What the Board might have done was
to have given the Hartrick policv a trial. Obviously
the deep ground isn’t going well; but why not test
some of the shallower region to the south? The
Bulletin believes that Klug, of 8., M. and Co., had
an idea that formations there ought to be tested;
but as some folk didn’t like Hartrick, the thing was
never done. And, with the cash all gone, the easy
opportunity has passed.
* * * *
New Chum Goldfields, Bendigo, recently
got on to a patch of plum pudding gold, and some
mining sneak passed the word round that a Christmas
dish was in stock. However, the manager, though
as rotund as Falstaff, got in promptly, to the
merriment of the Beehive, which well knows how
hard it is to catch that particular weasel asleep.
New Chum Goldfields —rich patch notwithstanding—
doesn’t make headway. The biggest work is at about
1100 ft., where the saddle shows 34ft. wide. Here
vields have worked out at about 3dwt. per ton. So
well have costs been watched that this return has
more than covered expenses. But shareholders in
these davs of high living want something more than
that. Their chance may come from nearer the sur-
face. But as Specimen Hill is draped in desolation
just now, it would take a mountain to move out-
siders to enthuse over prospects, or to bid up for
shares on mere talk.
New Langi Logan, Ararat, looks like hav-
ing a run, despite its 100,000 shares. If so, then
North Langi, Souths and Centrals may liven up after
six months of dreadful stagnation. New Langi has
the continuation of the Cathcart ground, as well as
two miles on the big Langi gutter. Mining to-day is
confined to the latter, but every foot of good wash
the Central Cathcart opens south-east adds to the
possibilities of the New Langi claim, lying, as it does,
next door. While Central is thus giving the office
for the Cathcart lead, New Langi itself is brushing
ahead with its level under the Langi lead Here
bore after bore has given such results as to establish
—unless bores lie, as they so often have done that
the wash in the gutter ought to pan out tip-top. It
is however, hard to forget the terrible experience ot
the Charlotte Plains, under a man as cautious as
Capron ; it frightens one off trying to spot deep-lead
winners on bore results. As at the Cathcart Central,
the wash must be entered before one can tell for cer-
tain This stage ought not to be distant at the
Langi, for the water there has been far below
croakers’ anticipations. Success at the New Langi
betokens the second advent of deep-lead mining in
Victoria; failure means its practical extinction.
Adelaide woke up suddenly out of its New
Year holiday sleep, switched on the light, locked the
door and telephoned for the police, because of a scare
head in the local Advertiser, stating that the
Standard Oil Co. of America had bought 50 square
miles of Kangaroo Island, and proposed to spend
several million dollars in putting down 200 bores in
search of petroleum. The Attorney-General was lured
out of bed in order to tell a reporter that the Govern-
ment would not let South Aus. get into the grip of
the Oil Trust. Then it was found that the author
of the scare head had mistaken the Standard Oil Co.
of Australia, a Melbourne concern, for Rockefeller s
octopus corporation. As a fact, the Melbourne co. is
getting the money and plant from London to make
an heroic effort to bore down 2500 ft., where it
hopes to meet with uncounted barrels of oil.
There is a lot of hard mining work done
in Tasmania without much fuss. Minerals valued at
about £1,500,000, were produced m 1912. Cutting
weights, values were as follows: Tin, £582,879
blister copper, £432,273; silver-lead, £322,103,
gold, £148,275; coal. £24,736; osmindium. £0355 ;
and wolfram, £3OOO. Considering how little the
Government does to help the mining industry, this is
a remarkable record. And by help is not meant
monetary subsidy, but track-cutting, road-makmg,
bridge-building, geological surveying, plan-drawing
and diamond-drilling, all proper Governmental activi-
ties, which are altogether too much neglected in
every one of the States. Only about one-fifth of
Victoria has been surveyed geologically, yet that
State owes its prosperity and population to the
mining industry. #
Statist Knibbs has compiled a set of tables
showing that the expectation of life for the Aus-
tralian baby is longer than that of any other newly-
born in the world. Thanks to Pure fiood Acts, purer
milk better sanitation and the effect of more educa-
tion all round, the Australian kiddy has a much
better chance than his co-eval anywhere else. rhe
critical age is from birth to 12 months, and infant
mortalitv during that period is diminishing all over
\nstralia. In Victoria it has dropned from'lls
deaths per 1000 children to 75 per 1000 within a
decade. The figures show that the expectation of life
at age 0 is improving all the time. Here it is (in
years) :
1881-1890 .. Males, 41.20; Females, 50.84
1891-1900 . . Males, 51.08 ; Females, 54.76
1901-1910 . . Males, 55.20 ; Females, 58.84
The next-best country to be born in is Sweden, where
the exepectation figures for 1901-1910 were —Males,
54.55 years; females, 57.00 years. Germany and
Austria are unfortunate countries for the infant to
see first, as their rates are the lowest in Europe ; in
Germany, males 40.56, females 43.97 ; in Austria,
males 37.77, females 39.87.
* * * *
E.W.R.: It looks as though about 10 p.c.
above par might be a fair thing; but there are lots
of possibilities to pull that figure up or down. For
instance, the business might be highly speculative,
and be the sort of thing that would blow clean out
with the first puff of dull times.
A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, January 13, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Easter falls so early this year that the
race-week balls will be pushed into the
warm end of summer. Swarms of musicians,
and m * nor > are already scraping the
hddle and tearing up and down the piano-
keys in anticipation of hurriedly bursting
into concert-bud about the second week in
March. Ladies who live for their clothes,
however, are in the worst plight. They
must choose between the Cup finery, which
was heavily rained on in November last, and
a swelter in fur and velvet. Probably they
will swelter. A new summer outfit for fes-
tivities in the sulky warmth of March is
only for the purse of Mrs. Moneybags : the
section of Society which looks twice at an
eighteen-penny cab-fare will have to follow
its thrifty habit of producing its new winter
garments for the Easter carnival of Hoofs
and Horns.
From January to the middle of March is
a period of migration for a considerable
percentage of this city’s population. They
make swallow-like darts to other States and
countries, varied by short-distance dives into
the local surf Manly and Cronulla are in
the damp-towel era, and the bare brown leg
° f fry is a thing of joy on every
surf-beaten beach. Grace Palotta is said
to have been sighted on the near side of a
Manly breaker the other morning. But the
man who thinks he saw her won’t swear
that it wasn’t a mermaid wearing her head
in a fascinating surf cap.
Launceston is said to be ready to greet
the Denmans with bunting and acclama-
tions as they pass through ; and “board and
residence is likely to put on airs and ex-
tras The threatened rush of Society trip-
pers to fish in the vicinity of vice-regal hooks
may not entirely, empty the floating popula-
tion of Hobart into Lake Leake, but Tas-
manians foresee fierce rivalry between the
two towns this season. If the rush of ama-
teur anglers to Lake Leake comes up to
expectations during the coming week, the
and his lady will have to creep warilv
out to play the nimble trout at dawn. Other-
wise, a sporting hook may catch some of our
Very Best People by the hair of their heads
°p the.soles of their boots. The congestion
of Society round the flaps of the vice-regal
tent may not be as alarming as a Hobart
pessimist predicts; but the prospect of
baronet Barttelot keeping even the Right
Peopie at Bay while his Ex. lights the fire
to boil the billy for breakfast, is by no
means remote. Lady Denman hurriedly
trying a few young and tender trout, while
the curious crowd gaze at Major Quilter
submerged in the dorfiestic duties of general
l ltl iu ty ’ J ls ., an item not likel V to filter through
to the daily press.
The passing of Mrs. Gamp is emphasised
by a recent conference in this citv. Two
large confederations of latter-dav Nightin-
gales control the going and coming, the
registration, fees and general status of Aus-
traiian nurses, who must belong to either
of these bodies if they wish to have a recog-
nised position. The. Australasian Trained
i urses Association is the more important
of the two, for it gathers under its cap and
apron trained nurses from every State in the
Commonwealth except Victoria. The south-

their employers fancy it, can. and often do
wear.the uniform of any hospital staff in our
big cities. Political influence is also alleged
to have put the uncertificated Miss Gamp
into posUmns she is incompetent to hold. So
the Cloak and Bonnet ladies are hammer-

land via a panther.
The opening day of Manly’s surf carnival
consisted chiefly of crowd. Thousands of
citizens craned their necks over the shoul-
ders of thousands of other citizens, and
made heroic efforts to see a few fancy cos-
tumes burst into a breaker, or a small boat
wallow in the trough of a long green sea.
±his was the ocean-beach end of the carni-
val on Saturday, as the crowd, gazing
through the elbows of the rest of the crowd,
saw it. W hat the smaller section who
knew enough to struggle into the right
places gazed at seems to have been quite
different.
Having had most of the breath knocked
out of his body in his fight to cross a dozen
yards of overcrowded Sydney wharf to the
Manly steamer, the visitor at length reached
the village, and bought a programme of
events, it cost one penny, and appeared
to. be worth at least eighteenpence. It con-
tained nearly as much information as an
encyclopedia, with a long list of events. The
visitor squeezed through the crowd on the
Corso, hurried breathless to a sandheap by
. S6 L a ’ aud sat down to study his pen’orth
of information. Then he found that its
commercial value was, so far as he was
concerned, about two-thirds of a farthing It
never mentioned where each thrill was' to
be found. So the stranger let himself loose
in the crowd, and tried to find out things
tor himself. In the intervals he worried, or
was worried by, several hundred persons
who were also on the trail of events that
were happening somewhere. It all seems so
Sl e m ivr e en we read about it over the rim
ot Monday morning’s teacup.
The blue face of Sydney Harbor was lit-
tered with all sorts of small craft on Satur-
day, when Hordern’s 90-h.p. Kangaroo was
snoring and boiling along victoriously at 5(1
miles an hour. While the first heat was
being run, a motor-launch fringed with
white-clad spectators came slowly along
towards I arsley Bay. The man at the
wheel may have been able to keep a bright
lookout; but the crowd on deck seemed from
the shore to be too thick for such formali-
ties. And then, of course, there was the
scooting hydroplane to watch. Suddenly
there was a sharp report, as if the motor-
boat engine had blown out, and two heads
were bobbing in the water. But there hadn’t
been any explosion; the preoccupied launch
had merely run down a little sailing boat
and shivered its timbers. Luckily nobody
was drowned. But if it had been another

Vice-Admiral Tate, who has recently re-

docks, passed through this town on his way
to Maoriland. He means to sample both
islands in hurried snacks of lakes, hot and
cold, and geysers on and off-strike. He has
a son on the much-discussed H.M.S. Torch
but fails to rise to any leading questions the
curious may throw out re that ancient craft.

Mrs, Macneill Simpson, the tall, willow-

the idea was ingenious, and the promoter
meant well. Dr. and Mrs. Ivater also went

When last heard of, Mr. and Mrs. James
Edmond were seeing Manila. There is a
good deal of scenery in the Philippines, pun *
tuated with cock-fights on Sunday. Con-
cerning the latter. Mr. Edmond writes
In Manila the bullfight has been suppressed, except
on ver}' special occasions; whether it is suppressed
on the special occasions also, it is hard to find out.
But the cockfight continues every Sunday. On the
Day of Rest almost every native seems to have a
rooster under one arm. I saw one event last Sunday
at Bos Banos, and backed the right fowl. Total
plunder, one peso (about 25.). The bird that ran
second threw in the towel inside three minutes. Much
poultry is eaten here on Mondays, while the defeated
warriors are still fresh. The bolted rooster never
lives to fight another day. He is reared from early
egghood with battle in view. He goes into the ring
tor the first and last time. He hands in his resigna-
tion, perhaps in a minute, and then his career is
over. In Manila there are some veteran birds with
a record of many victories, but they are few and
tough.
This place is noted for its fine roads (about the
city, anyhow), the brightest green scenery imagin-
able, swift motor-cars, old cathedrals and shilling
drinks, the cigar, at 2 5 d., can also be commended.

A hen the citizen sits down in his anger
and his haste, and writes to The Bulletin
demanding an instant apology and £126,543
damages for daring to say that he was a cruel
thief, when, as a matter of fact, all he did
was to water the milk on philanthropic prin-
ciples, the said milk being far too strong in
its raw state, the belligerent has, for 25
years past, been getting a reply referring him
to Laurence and Laurence. Or, possibly, it
wasn’t Laurence and Laurence 25 years ago.
ihe “and Laurence” is an addition of more
modern days; it was tacked on when the
youngster who had served as a model for the
Little Boy from Manly grew up and learned
how to charge six-and-eightpence. The
struggle to stave off the infuriated citizen
who, wants the £126,543 mentioned above
hasn’t been so fatal as might have been ex-
pected for it was a very robust gladiator
who said “Thank you” the other afternoon,
when the L. and L. office staff of to-day, and
some of the office staffs of other days, trooped
in and handed over an album of portraits.
This was the office’s way of saying “Many
happy returns” of “the senior’s” birthday in

for his mates. After prying the depths and
shallows of the Dominion’s commerce, the

Australia. S’Africa is next on the list I
fancy.

The prize money is about £75 all told, and
the right to hold the Mark Foy Cup for 12
months. On Mr. Doran’s native Swan most
of the boat races are won with the aid of the
Fremantle doctor. This is a light S.W.
breeze which occasionally exists only in the
imagination of devout Perthonians. It’s sup-
posed to fan their heated brows regularly
every afternoon; but sometimes it fails to
keep its appointment from Sunday to Fri-

The Zoo lady elephant, generally known
as Jessie, though absent-minded friends
sometimes call her Alice for short, was very
fidgety the other week. The authorities
discovered that she had some reason for the
kink in her temper as she had a whitlow on
hrenri° f he u- toes - So they put a large, fat
bread poultice on the part. In the morn-
ing they found that the lady had eaten the
whitlow’ Th WaS StUl ann °yed about her
whitlow. They put on another poultice, and
built it on the part with a bulwark of tim-
ber. Then they left the lady to her beautv
sleep. Next morning the outworks were
matchwood, and Jessie had again devoured
the poultice. The foot was worse.
One of Australia’s greatest surgeons was
called in to see what he could do with a
lady who ate her home-made remedies. He
lanced the festering pimple, not without
some trepidation, elephants being out of his
line. The huge beast bore the pain without
any sign of wrath, and merely shuddered
with the anguish, like a human Stoic. Next
day, being interested in his new patient, the
doctor entered her boudoir, keeping carefully
out of the way of the hearty kick he ex-
pected to get if Jessie could put her hoof
on him. To his amazement, she turned
round, apparently recognised the only per-
son who had given her relief, and held up
her sore foot for his inspection. The sur-
geon tells this story.
When the last mail left Paris, the colossal
Clara Butt had been singing with the Lam-
oureux orchestra. Later, the Butt organ
flung its profound contralto notes across
the Salle Gaveau, where it was much appre-
ciated. Paris hadn’t heard the songs of
Clara and the musical Kennerley Rumford
for three years or thereabouts, and it seems
to have taken the wanderers to its heart, or
its_ best cafe, or something of the kind. Gil
Bias lashed itself into a foam of flattery
over the Butt voice; so its size and depth
must be unimpaired by the years that the
locust hath eaten since we heard it in Syd-
ney.
A line from Paris tells me that pianist
Florence Menkmeyer gave a successful ex-
hibition on December 5 in the Salle Gaveau.
This good-looking concert hall was filled to
its uttermost keyhole, and great was the
applause thereof. The Menkmeyer pro-
gramme included a snack or two of her own
compositions, with a solid helping of Ruben-
stein, Moskowski and Chopin.
Another blow ! This time it comes from
one Theodore Flateau, author of a novel
branded “The Soul of the Dancer”:—
The Manora’s passengers were of the usual types
(of travellers in Egypt) the thin, crudely hearty
and heartily crude Australians, with their vivacious
and terrifyingly sophisticated women folk, and, as a
salt to the leaven, a sprinkling of the really nice
people.

The Germans had a day out at Clifton
Gardens on Saturday. It was the 20th
national handclap over the confederation of
the German States. Consul-General Killiani
made a speech which the State Frights
might clasp to their inner consciousness
with good results. Mr. Killiani is a man of
wide experience, of learned mien, and not
given, as a rule, to throwing away his
words. In the social round, he looks a re-
mark at least twice all over before he
launches it on a frivolous sea of frothy small
talk. So the lady voter who feels herself
torn both ways, in the matter of the Refer-
endum may, with all the more confidence,
pin his hints re the strength of unity on to
her hair-net or some other handy portion of
her attire.
Ancient members of the pioneer Cox
family are fast disappearing. Mrs. Francis
Cox, the last to depart, was a daughter of
Captain Bayliss, of the 17th Regiment; she
marned Francis, eldest son of Henry Cox,
of Mulgoa, in 1857. She was 84 at the time
ot her death, and had never travelled in
a train. The one-horse gig of olden times
was good enough for her, she told a vounger
generation. The old lady’s home was at
Mmah, near Mudgee.
The Sydney Stock Exchange has not, as

dazzling life of gamble. In London she has
already arrived, though the Stock Exchange
so far slams its door in her face. A snap-
shot of the only English stockbroker in pet-
ticoats shows the lady with her mouth wide
open wrestling with the telephone. Her
office table is covered with a blizzard of
papers, and no powder-puff or hairpins have
risen to the surface.

Twelve Months in
the Back Blocks
on a “Triumph.”
Riding for twelve months in the “back blocks” is enough to test the
stamina of any Motor-Cycle, and that the “Triumph” came through
such an experience and is practically as good as ever speaks highly
for its reliability.
Mr. A. McArtney is the owner of this machine, and, writing from
47 Morrisset Street, Bathurst, he says:—“l rode my ‘Triumph’ all
through the ‘back blocks’ this year, and never had one bit of trouble
with it, and I gave it some rough work on rough roads.”
The “Triumph” is the greatest satisfier you can get for a mount.
We’ll tell you all about it, explain the mechanism so that you’ll under-
stand it perfectly—give you a practical lesson, almost, on motor-cycle

“ BINDAWALLA.”
By THOS. E. SPENCER
(Author of “ How McDougall Topped the Score,” “ Mrs. McSweeney,” “ Spring Cleaning,” etc.).
With a Frontispiece by Percy Spence.
Crown Bvo. 296 pages. PRICE. 1/-; POST FREE 1/1.
The genial author of “McDougall” and “Mrs. McSweeney” gave it as his opinion that
“Bindawalla” was the best book he ever wrote. He nursed it for years, polishing here, altering
there, until he was quite satisfied that, as a story of bush life, both from the humorous and
the dramatic side, it was good and faithful work.
Those who have become acquainted with Mr. Spencer’s other books should certainly read
his last; they will be amply repaid.
This is the largest book every issued by the Bookstall Co. —a compliment to the author
and a decided advantage to the reader.
“Chandler of Corralinga.”
By R. J. CASSIDY. Fully Illustrated.
PRICE 1/-; POST FREE 1/1.
Chandler was what is generally known as a ne’er-do-well, a bad lot, who was mixed up
in every crooked happening around Corralinga. But he had his good points also, and meeting
the squatter’s daughter casually one day, he fell in love with her, and determined to turn over
a new leaf and prove himself a man.
In his hard try he has to fight both physically and morally in order to establish his right
to woo his lady love, and the story of his battles is quite fascinating. The ringing of the
shearing shed is a bit of realistic writing that would be difficult to beat, and the fight with
the city-bred banker has few equals.
“BASE BRANDS.”
By H. M. SOMER. With Eight Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.
PRICE 1/-; POST FREE 1/1.
Mr. Somer is the popular secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society of N.S.W., and a man
who is recognised as an authority on the horse and the bush, a combination in which most
Australians take a keen and abiding interest.
In “Base Brands” he has produced a book of uncommon merit, full of the dashing adven-
tures that accompanied sheep stealing and cattle duffing in the early days, yet not wanting
in the threads of romance that are always interwoven with the episodes of human life. His
portrayal of Captain Rundall, the daring hero with the dual personality, is an admirable piece
of work that will appeal strongly to lovers of bush romance.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 13, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Federal Government House turned its
close trimmed lawns into a picnic ground for
the Post Office folk on Saturday. A free
show of some sort buzzed at every corner,
and a band blared and thumped energetically
for the entertainment of the invaders. A
merry-go-round revolved tirelessly, an “<>ceun
wave” afforded diabolical pleasure for those
who love the heaving deep, and daylight fire-
works soared aloft and burst in "the upper
air, releasing strange, silken shapes that sank
softly back to earth and were scrambled for
by the youngsters. Young Judith and
lhomas Denman, shepherded by two nurses,
got a large share of the frayed scarlet silk
and dressed thmselves like Red Indians,
much to the envy of other gaping chil-
dren. Two very hot clowns, with melted
paint streaking off their faces, tumbled on
a platform and played wfith an overdressed
monkey. The big House happened to be
open for inspection by the Belgian naval
cadets; but when the perspiring 2000 showed
a disposition to tramp through the sacred
halls, alarmed flunkeys began hurriedly to
close the doors. Two long, flag-decked mar-
quees, with buffets manned by girls, con-
tained food and drink. The crowd haunted
these _ shelters until the ceremonious tea-
drinking by the house party allowed them
to make their onslaught. The Denman lady,
very droopy and dainty in filmy white, took
some Ministerial guests into a corded-off cor-
ner. The G.G., looking cool and comfortable
in grey, had his watch chain arranged in a
cross on his chest. The idea is sure to
become fashionable amongst the postmen this
year.
Commander Corneille, of the Belgian cadet
ship, wore his red moustache in two exquisite
curls. Valcke, acting-consul for the Flat
Country, and Vanderkelen, a Belgian of
great social tonnage here, helped at the spe-
cial spread. Chamberlain Xevill won many
small hearts with his smile, and worked
really hard at lifting little people on
to the merry-go-round. Prime Minister
Fisher came in a bashed grey hat and
travelling rig, and brought the family
in a car. Mrs. Fisher was away
packing for Sydney, and sober Andrew
hurried off to join her aboard the express.
Mrs. Thomas looked cool in a linen dress
and lavender veil. Defence Minister Pearce
and his wife showed off their considerable
family, one of whom is a small, white-
haired boy named Lloyd George. Mrs.
Hughes floated round in a white lace dress
covered with a cool cinnamon brown film.
The Barttelot lady was a picture in soft
purple from hat to shoe tip. Her military
husband walked in full regimentals. The
Belgian cadets, after being inspected, scat-
tered to chat with friends and girl chums.
At teatime the picnickers went and helped
themselves, and the abashed sun went
down on a couple of thousand hot and happy
people feeding “in no uncertain manner,” as
the daily paper would say.
The Denman pair, with the family in
leash, left last Monday for a loaf in an
unnamed fishing village in the Tasmanian
speck. The exact locality is a State
secret. Later on, the cadets will be put
through their facings in Launceston, and
then the pair will go south to Hobart to
see the Cup run, and attend a few functions.
Chamberlain Nevill is to meet them there
and take his trick at the social wheel. Miss
Verney and the family will be collected on
the way back. The vacation from vice-regal
pick-and-shovelling is to last three weeks.
Gaud Mayor Hennessy and his wife had the
Town Hall carefully decorated for the recep-
tion of the Science Congress people. The
Mayoress, who supported some long pink
feathers and a few nice clothes, had her
frock-coated lord on one hand and Professor
David on the other. Several men unburd-
ened their souls in praise of the gathering,
and everybody listened politely. The Ant-
arctic Prof, said some wise things very
quietly indeed; but he happened to finish a
comparatively unimportant remark with the
rolling phrase “on the illimitable ocean of
the Unknown.” The crowd evidently felt
that it was the oratorical cue for a round
of applause, and they woke up with a crash
of hands and feet that halted and surprised
the speaker. He blinked at them in humor-
ous amazement, then caught up the thread
of his discourse and snipped it off with a
few keen observations. A heavily impressive
organ-recital followed the speeches, tea being
carefully locked up till the thunderous music
reached a tumultuous end. The Hennessys
have thusfar made a feature of the organ
recital at their functions; but on each occa-
sion, some tactful coaxing and shoo-ing has
had to be used in order to herd the frivollers
within earshot, tea and a string band being
much more to their light taste. An organ is
much too churchlike, my dear, and, besides,
it is so horribly loud one can hardly hear
oneself speak. This time the official plans
were.laid with great cunning. The reception
was in the organ hall right next to the tow-
ering thing of pipes and keys. No civilised
person could rush upstairs to tea before the
hostess, and so the thunder had to be en-
dured. Right through the programme, the
Mayoress s pink feathers gleamed like a
fixed oriflamme; but the guests mostly
sighed like the winds in the trees, and
rustled and yawned behind their gloves. I
suppose it must be annoying to have a
>ea f idle organ just accumulating dust; but
the Hennessys are a trifle too enthusiastic.
Ihe only consolation Society has is that it
ft one of the kind you turn with a handle.
And, of course, there is no monkey with it.
The absence of the monkey is a great relief.
Lovie Mueller, the Bendigonian songstress,
is back from Italy with her sculptor hus-
band, Signor Ettore Cadorin. He is a pro-
fessor at the Academy of Fine Arts in
Venice, and has brought out with him some
beautiful bronzes and marbles. Travellers
speak glowingly of examples of Cadorin’s
work seen in Italian cities. About one thing
there is a special lot of raving—a Venetian
monument to some baroness.
The Belgian Consul Huylebroeck, who has
been m Melbourne for years, and was much
m endence in connection with the entertain-
ment of the Belgian naval cadets, is about
to shift to a Government appointment in
Holland.
Alderman Jack Marks has taken out his
ticket via America, and is off early in
I ebruary. His portmanteau bears many
scars, and he easily holds the travel record
amongst city aldermen. Uncle Jack, a bach-
will be chaperoned on his pilgrimage
by Laura Levey, a niece still in her earlv
springtime.
Ex-Police Commissioner Chomley’s widow
and her friend, Miss Baird, leave at the end
ot the month for Monte Carlo, where they
will most probably have a little flutter at
the tables with an “infallible” system which
has been presented to them free of cost for
trial. Neither of the voyagers will be par-
ticularly downhearted if they lose; but they
expect to get some amusement out of their
attack on “the bank.”
People here feel very sorry for Wheatley,
A.ILL., who has hurriedly returned to Eng-
land to attend the mournful legal transac-
tions which follow a father’s death.
All the Expensive people left in town put
9? their best clothes and hurried along to
the Iresbyterian Church, Toorak, for the
I airbairn-Jowett wedding. Bride Marjorie
Rose (all the Jowett girls are decorated
with the second name) was clad bravely in
satin, with a top dressing of old Limerick.
A cataract of chiffon balanced with brocade
composed the train, and was lifted from the
dust by little Beatrice Smith and a youthful
Stewart Balmain. Cousin Eily McCallum
from Toowoomba, walked in the place of
honor; Edna Armytage, Beryl Scott, Ade-
laide Schneider and Leonore Effingham—a
plump quartette—walked gravely in her
wake. They wore Dutch bonnets of green
curtained with white, to match the scheme
ot things. Clive Fairbairn, the leading
fas prompted through his part by
Clifford Anderson; whilst Noel Boothby, a
Pyeman youth, Mrs. Dalrymple’s son, "and
young Isiall hovered round the bonneted
maids George Fairbairn wore his hair
beautifully parted and his most bored ex-
pression. Mrs. George sat in pewter grey
at bis elbow". Her costume went well with
the orchid mauve costume of the Jowett
mamma. The recent Burston bride was
there with mother-in-law and the colonel-
also, the other sister, Mrs. Powell. The last-
named brought husband and baby all the
w-ay from Dalby to witness the" perform-
ance. Ihe crowd was afterwards fed in a
green-striped marquee, pitched behind the
Jowett homestead near a fence laden with
Kambier roses and a corner filled with
hydrangea. The pair are honeymooning
at Greenlawn, the Fairbairn country cot

lni r i S 'oi Ev ? r , d Browne, just back from a
jaunt abroad, has been chaperoning a Mani-
fold miss, of the Camperdown clan. Report
has it that the attractive girl grew senti-
mental aboard ship, and is about to be fully
engaged to a widower with good looks, two
children, and much less than a million in
cash. But the lady will have plenty of
money later on. p 01
Two South Australians w-ho took a Cud-
time opportunity of getting engaged are now
endunng an avalanche of congratulation^
The interested parties are Ruby Sandlands
KoortZSt
Ja.net), who lately said “Yes” to a good-
looking but somewhat solemn young man
endnwed with the deliciously romantic name
of -Derek Peveril. He came here from Eng-
land to find out the possibilities of wool and
mutton. Business took him to a Riverina
station, and it was there the newchum met
his affinity. The late Mr. Stewart, who did
not trouble about the hyphen or hen-roost,
was at one time manager for Goldsbrough’s.
’ Laing Bruce, son of the late com-
mercial chieftain, is to marry Dr. Jackson’s
daughter Alice. The congratulations are
congesting the telephone lines.
Sir Alexander Napier, the tired little
baronet who was here for a couple of years
as A.D.C. to the Dudleys, is engaged. He is
to marry Joan, only daughter of the late
Edward Ashurst Morris. The deceased par-
ent was rich—disgustingly so, in fact. Sir
Alexander has no ancestral or other man-
sion in Scotland, where he comes from, but
the projected alliance should put that little
anomaly right. He has left the Grenadier
Guards. By the way, Captain Gilliat, an-
other of the Dudley A.D.C.’s, has also aban-
doned his regiment, the Rifle Brigade.
• I<: is L, a lo . ng honeymoon that has no end-
Charlie W allace and the Urquhart
bride he took from the Western District, are
just back from wandering round the world.
Mr - Wallace has recovered his taste for
yachting, and is beginning to look critically
at white wings again.
A tall, dashing Melbourne girl who is tem-
porarily separated from her (say Marsovian)
faancti, has not gone into partial retirement
and adopted the sad, wistful expression
proper to one whose lover is away fighting
for his beloved country. Not a bit of it!
f>he drinks his health in champagne at jolly
care parties, and dissembles her grief with
chocolates, bonbons, loaves of bread, pickles
and rounds of beef.
Mrs. Rumor says an approaching divorce
will show the unwisdom of a husband im-
muring his wife in the country ere he goes
off travelling. In this case, the wife, finding
the country dull, developed a slight but per-
sistent malady which demaned constant
attention by a susceptible medico in the
nearest township. That’s where the storv
starts.
The joy of the Waxcellency pair over the
arrival of daughter Beatrice' Baillieu’s first
is said to be tempered with regret that "he”
is not a “she,” whereas the young parents are
quite satisfied with the infant stranger’s sex
Doubtless the darling is fat and will sleep
o nights, unlike the lean and hungry Cas-
S J. US ‘f the. kittle Madden descendants,
thusfar, have inherited the grandparental
avoirdupois.
Mr. Merz, the electrical expert who came
out from London to modernise our suburban
railways, has gone to Westralia on the
same sort of business, ere returning to his
native hemisphere. Reginald Wilson, an-
other ornament of the same firm, who abided
with his wife and daughter at Mandeville
Hall, Toorak, has already departed. The
Wilson lady, who was a vehement golfer and
an enthusiast upon countries and climates
other than Australia, seemed to rejoice in
packing her trunks. Miss Wilson, who is
still in the kingdom of flapperdom, was an
expert on the ice, and carried some stunning
carnival trophies away with her.
Theatrical and other circles have been
excited about the sudden departure of one of
ladies of the Asche Co. It is said that she
was expected at an “Antony and Cleopatra”
rehearsal when she "was already on her way
to London. So the astonishing story goes.
And it is going pretty strong.
Herbert Grimwood, Anson and two more
of Asche’s mummers are living the simple
VGA 1 ? a ?, amp P itcfa ed on the Yarra bank at
aa ? er Grange. The simple, sun-bathed
life is said to be a fine preparation for the
classic drama, which so often insists on its
victims wearing bare legs on the draughtv
boards.
Mr. Macrae, manager of Dalgety’s, intends
to take a health and business run to London
m March next, with his wife and elder
daughter. Mrs. Macrae’s mother, Mrs. Dill
will count the days until the wanderers re-
turn- Although nearly 90 years of age, she
still enjoys a tea-party, and can munch a
morsel of gossip.
The polo ponies raised the Kooyong dust
last Inday, when Caramut, the swagger
country team, played G.-G. Denman and his
men R. Urquhart, R. Cumming. Alec
Hood and A. Attwell represented the Woollv
District, and were charged against by his •
x., Ernest Bruce, and Helps Nutting and
Burnham. The Charlie Wallace couple
motored out, and “Bob” Bruce and his
nancee, Miss Jackson, wrere a popular double-
target for congratulations. The Jowetts
bi ought Mrs. Powell, the Bananaland daugh-
ter. The Denman lady arrived late with big
Major Quilter, her Ex. making a soft blue
vision in one corner of the motor. The
Ba-rttelot lady was in black. Chamberlain
Nevill rode out and watched the plav criti-
cally. It was such a busy social gathering
and tea was so eagerly looked for, that the
women could scarcely spare a glance for the
galloping, thwacking contest itself. The
usual superheated remarks of the players
were carefully muffled when the ball was
being fought for on the social side of the
arena; but when it was hit elsewhere, the
wrath was wafted down unashamed to the
spectators.
The G.-G.’s enthusiasm for the ancient
game has had an exhilarating effect on the
local horse trade. Australian breeders had
got into the habit of sending all the polo
ponies to India; but one man recently con-
fided that the handy little animals now
brought a better price locally, and that India
had to sit up and bargain vigorously.
Ivy Schilling was the guest of honor at
an A.D.C.’s party at Government House last
week. Her injured limb—one of those with
which she has made her name—is better
again. She is doing two dances a night as
in the brave days of yore, and generally the
sun is smiling on her classic brow.
Prahran has been giving farewell parties
at top speed to Donald Mackinnon, the
debonair, grey-haired politician, and his big,
important wife. The pair are off to scatter
some of their money among foreigners.
Mrs. Harper is busy arranging an en-
tertainment for the poor souls who are hav-
ing a good, summery time at Macedon. That
handsome youth, Peter Schuler, will put his
fate to the touch with a dramatic trifle from
his own fountain pen. The production in
MS. form has been purred over and pawed
over by the Very Best. It will be produced
on the 25th, and if smoke rolls down on
Melbourne we will know that it has set the
tindery bush on fire.
The trousseau chiffons of Mrs. Walker,
only daughter of the Brighton Ramsays’
have been laid aside. She is in mourning for
a much-loved little brother, who succumbed
to the after-effects of an attack of measles.
It was owing to the boy’s illness that the
Walkers postponed their contemplated honey-
moon trip round the world.
Captain Oswald Watt (you will remem-
ber he married pretty Muriel Williams) is
at Fremantle, or thereabouts, on his return
to these shores. He is the only Australian
of wealth, and one of the few T Australians of
any description whatever, who was suffici-
ently daring or mad (read it which you
please) to earn an aviator’s certificate*from
the Royal Aero Club. He is attached to
the Commonwealth forces, and reported on
the flying-ground site at Duntroon (N.S.W.)
when he was here last year.
Little Mollie Wilson, daughter of Norman
of the sporting Wilson tribe, and sometime
a dainty dancer in the J. C. Williamson
ranks, is now living happily in Holland with
a Dutch husband whom she met in London,
while she was studying the British style of
dancing at the Empire. Another Victorian
girl who is wedded to a Dutchman is Maud
Black, a Gippsland heiress who fluttered in
Melbourne under the chaperonage of the
Best matrons. A third Hollander by mar-
riage is (or was) Miss Julie Clark*, niece
and adopted daughter of the late squatter
Simson and his wife. For a couple of Mel-
bourne seasons Miss Julie reigned as the
smartest of the smart. After a scamper
round India, Paris and London, the little
Victorian heiress lost her heart to a Dutch
widower. The pair now lead the simple life
in Holland. In that land of windmills and
exaggerated trousers, simplicity is still a
fact and not merely a fad. Thus the dearest
wish of the bachelor Cantain Goedhuis. of the
Dutch boats that trade between Australian
ports and Java, is to presently quit the sea
and “grow the what you call flowering cab-
bage” in dear, dumpy Holland. And he
ought to have plenty of time to grow “the
flowering cabbage,” for the skippers of the
East Indies service retire at 45.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Grange, after a long period of neglect, woke
up in 1910, and has this summer moved a few more
steps towards waterside popularity. Kangaroo Island
which two or three years ago promised to boom as a
loafing resort, has dropped out of fancy again.
Mr Dutton is on another yachting trip ; with him

Russell. Mr. and Mrs. Harry Dutton, of the family

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australia’s Postmaster-General, C. E.
Frazer, who is at present on a visit to
Maoriland, has there broken the not too
pleasant news that Sydney’s
Labor daily is not expected
to be on the streets until
some little time after the
Federal elections in May.
LOOKING AHEAD.
GRANNY : “ Playin' with that big, fierce dog
agin, are you?"
THE BOY : “ He’s not a big, fierce dog. He's
only a pup .”
GRANNY: “ But 'e'll grow into a big, fierce dog
some day, an then he’ll bite somebody, an'
they'll die."
Deakin’s retirement from the leadership
of the Fusion party on the ground of ill-
health recalls that he sustained one previous
retirement for the same reason. That time
he had coalesced with the Tories of the
borrow and boom period. Coalitions seem
very trying to even a man as affable as
Alfred.
The Fat party is barracking solidly for
the State savings banks as against those
owned and run by the Commonwealth. The
anti-Sosh party, as usual, doesn’t know that
the thing is loaded. The one reason why
the States want to hang on to the Savings
Bank is that they may have control of the
funds in order to use them. So the party
which says Socialism is a tiger is barrack-
ing for a system whose object is to provide
sustaining food for the ravening animal.
During the Sugar Trust case in Maori-
land, Chief Justice Stout took a dive into
history, and brought up something of in-
terest about the crimes of “forestalling,”
“engrossing” and “regrating.” This was
the old law-book definition :
Forestaller is he that buyeth corne, eattell or other
merchandise, whatsoever is saleable, by the way as it
eometh to markets, faires, or other like places to be
sold, to the intent that he may sell the same againe,
at a more high and deer price, in prejudice and hurt
of the Commonwealth and people.
Pirate Enterprise is always blaming the
atrocious Labor party for "interfering” with
ancient laws. As a matter of fact, it is
Pirate Enterprise that has done most of the
“interfering” with ancient laws: the Labor
party is doing little except to root up a few
of the weeds that bowelless commercialism
has planted within the last three-quarters of
a century.
There was a terrible shindy recently
when the Sydney Water and Sewerage
Board wept on the public’s shoulder and
wailed that it had no money to carry on
its works because the shockingly wasteful
Labor Government had starved it. Henley,
M.L.A., who is a member of the Board and
a maddened Liberal politician, shivered the
atmosphere with his protest; another mem-
ber was so overcome that he described the
Government as inhuman or thereabouts;
and the Tory press shrugged itself and asked
what else was to be expected from Labor.
The Minister at this stage arose in the
middle distance and read a few figures as
follows: —
Voted to the
Year. Board by Amount.
1910 .. Liberal Government ..£440,000
1911 . . Labor Government . . 484,000
1912 .. Labor Government .. 585,000
Since then there has been a comparative
calm.
“Singemoine” holds an autopsy :—-
Alfred Deakin, clear-sighted and honest, has his
prototype in England in A. J. Balfour, the philo-
sophic doubter whom the Tories deposed the other
day. The wholly satisfactory party leader is one who
is either so elastic in conscience that he can swallow
anything, regardless of his own views, or so tractable
as to be able to absorb the whole party programme at
a gulp, and believe the sentiments are his own. Joseph
Carruthers was of the former class. All political
manoeuvres came alike to him, provided they seemed
profitable. To-day a flamboyant King’s man, to-
morrow he might head an agitation to evict the
Governor-General. Now a Socialist, now an anti-
Socialist, he was one thing always, and that was
thorough. Honest doubt he refused to know the
moment the party whip cracked. G. H. Reid was
much the same —prepared to take up anything and
drop anything as the exigencies of the situation de-
manded, and remain jolly and fat through it all.
Andrew Fisher is a good example of the other sort of
leader—the one who is not bowed down by an over-
analytical intellect. The party shibboleths are good
enough for him. He wouldn’t criticise one of them
for worlds, and he couldn’t if he would. Deakin, as
leader of a high Protectionist party, with democratic
leanings, was in his element. He could allow him-
self all the introspection he liked, and never
bump against a scruple. But in alliance with tariff-
sinkers of the old blue-mouldy, Tory class, he has
been about as comfortable as a sufferer from chronic
rheumatism. A more cynical and less honest man
would have stood it. Deakin couldn’t. And the ver-
dict of most of those who attend the inquest will be
that his retirement was a happy release for all con-
cerned.
The South Aus. Government is once more
talking about its unfinished Parliament
House. Away in the days before Federation
it started to erect a palace, but the cost was
too horrible, and the scheme left off half-
way. Then Federation came,
and all State Parliaments
dwindled in importance; also
S.A. very sensibly reduced the
number of members in both its
Houses, and the betting as to
the palace being finished was
about 100 to three against.
Meanwhile the finest site in
Adelaide is occupied by a lawn,
and kindly creepers have modi-
fied the hideousness of the blank
walls on the unfinished side.
There is room there for a splen-
did building of any sort, but to
squander it on a Parliament
whose Houses are quite corn-
fortably provided for already would be sheer
State-assertion of the wasteful kind.
Maoriland will soon be entitled to wave
some sort of proud tail feathers over its
citizen army. On March 31 last, 61,797
territorials and senior cadets were regis-
tered, and there had only been 362 refusals
to take the oath and 1161 absences from
drill. It doesn’t look as if the weird com-
bination of Peace Society and Red Tie was
cutting much ice in the Shaky Islands.
THE UNANSWERED CALL.
In the meantime there is quite a little flutter of
recrudescence in our own Freetrade camp. The
disease, which in Australia was virtually stamped out
before the Fusion, has reappeared in blotches and
threatening sores. — AGE.
AUSTRALIA (after the 10,005th call): “Fancy
being threatened with this form of measles
at my age, and not a soul in the shop
willing to doctor me!”
The annual report of the Vic. Government
Statist on (among others) the precious “in-
dependent” labor unions promoted by Packer
and the Abgus makes interesting reading.
The Agricultural Implement and Machinery
Independent Union had 611 memDers who
paid £24 14s. in entrance fees ; other contri-
butions from members for the year amounted
to £lB4 12s. But donations and subscrip-
tions from outside totalled £461 ss. 9d. So
for every £1 paid by members to their union,
kind and quite disinterested outsiders sub-
scribed about £2 ss. The Melbourne Tram-
way and Omnibus Company’s Employees’
Union had a membership of 100; but 22
quitted during the year, leaving only 78 on
the roll. Entrance fees totalled a whole £5,
and contributions from members amounted
to £35 55., donations and subscriptions
from non-members totalled £215 4s. 7d. So
for every £1 paid into this union by its mem-
bers, kind friends came along and threw in
£6. A lot of people were very indignant
when Justice Higgins said that this brand
of union was fostered by and run in the in-
terest of the employers. Yet, if they weren’t
employers, who could these kind friends have
been ?
LABOR DRIVING FAT OUT OF THE
COUNTRY.
Illustration for up-to-date encyclopedia of
political knowledge.
Apparently a little kite-flying was done in
Joe Cook’s interests just before Deakin’s re-
signation was announced. “It is considered.”
said various papers, “that Mr. Cook has a
good chance of selection as a member of the
Inter-State Commission” —the Commission
which is to be the eyes and ears of the Com-
monwealth as regards its trade and infant
industries. Essentially a Protectionist com-
mission ; and Joe Cook, Freetrader, a mem-
ber of it! If that joke were played, this
paper would expect a codlin moth to be
appointed an inspector of orchards when the
next vacancy occurred.
The Commonwealth Government has given
S. Aus. a year’s notice of its intention to
cancel the lease of the railway from Port
Augusta to Oodnadatta. the first section of
the Transcontinental. Since June 30, 1911.
the State has retained the railway at a rent
of “one peppercorn,” paying the expenses and
taking the revenue—which, by the way,
doesn’t anything like cover the outgoings.
When the South Aus. Government agreed to
hand over the line, it was, of course, an
understood thing that it would be carried
northward, thus opening up South Aus. land
before entering the Territory; and though
the present Commonwealth Government has
announced that it favors the straight line,
the Peake Ministry is suggesting that some
guarantees should be given before the
Augusta-Oodnadatta section is taken out of
the State’s hands.
Professor Baldwin Spencer, of Melbourne
I niversity, has come down from the North-
ern Territory to say :
I spent the whole of the year in the Territory. It
has a perfectly healthy climate. I did a considerable
amount of hard physical work and was never in better
health.
As usual, the papers which wanted black
and tan labor, and were quite sure the
white man couldn’t live and work in the
North, have got into the habit of printing
these things without the faintest blush. In
fact, within three years they will swear thev
have been saying the things all along
Inspired yarns still keep appear-
ing in the Sydney press to the ef-
fect that the late residence of the
Governor-General is to be the home
of N.S.W.’s State Governors in
future. It will be bad business
for the State Governors if the idea
is carried into effect. The plain
fact is, the class of State Governor
who is now appointed to an Aus-
tralian job lacks the independent
income requisite to “keep up” such
a vast pile. The Carringtons and
Hampdens of other days were rich
men ; the Rawsons of modern times
are not. They have to live within
their official screws; and a Gov-
ernor could no more run this place
on £5OOO per annum than a bank
clerk could support a yacht and a
motor-car on his earnings.
In the early days of the Mater-
nity bonus one of the Liberal sheets
remarked loftily that it was an in-
sult to offer any lady £5 for becom-
ing a mother. Up to date, no less
than 19,481 claims for insults have
been made, and only 100 applicants
have been treated with true Lib-
eral respect —that is to say, their
applications have been courteously
rejected. It is sometimes rather
terrible to be treated with respect.
The Tory person is just now yelling in
heart-broken tones for more immigration
with a view to finding soldiers to defend the
country. It is strange how the Tory can
interest himself even in such a matter as
Defence when it suits his book. Only a few
months ago the whole idea of defending
Australia was to his mind utterly absurd ;
now he talks as if nothing else really mat-
tered. The immigration problem is one of
comparatively easy solution. Australia can
take countless thousands of white men when
it makes room for them by ordering the
Tory person to get up and stand on one
side" At present the position is that the
Tory, having engaged for his special use 10
out "of 12 carriages of the national train, is
roaring to the throng on the platform that
there is any amount of room in the two
packed carriages. It is not a very convinc-
ing roar.
“F.H.”: The recall of unsatisfactory Par-
liamentary representatives, following the
American procedure, is advocated by
“8.N.F.” (B. 2/l/’l3). I am with
“8.N.F.” But it would lead to some hot
canvassing in certain parts of Australia. It
is not difficult to picture the feverish activity
with which, say, the Women’s National
League would get to work if a Labor maa
managed to jostle into the Reps, for Koir
yong f Vic.). He would not have to do much
nor say much to have the pack after him.
Electors’ petitions are, I believe, the first
stage in the recall biz. Judging from the
success of the W.N.L., etc., in obtaining
postal votes in the Kooyong electorate —a
record for Australia at the last Federal ex-
citement —the petitions would be garnered
in short order. It’s a democratic idea, no
doubt; but, then, according to Toryism, so
was the postal vote, deceased.
The cable last week solemnly reported an
exchange of utterances between George
Reid and the poor old Emperor of Austria.
George congratulated
the octo g e n arian
monarch on his “il-
lustrious” 64-year-old
reign and his “power-
ful influence in favor
of the peace of the
world,” to which the
ancient replied with a
few well-chosen re-
marks con c e rning
Australia and an as-
surance that he would
remain peaceful to
the end of his long
chapter. The piffle of
public life!
The second ballot makes us acquainted
with strange bedfellows. The Labor man
being out of it, the official Labor paper urges
its readers to vote for Withington at
Blayney rather than Beeby— to vote
for the Liberal in the name of Labor
solidarity. .It may be good party tac-
tics ; in which case so much the worse for
the party tactics that tell you to vote for a
man who will yield you two things out of
the 12 you want, rather than the man who
will yield you 11.
Before the Science Congress in Melbourne,
B. E. MacDonald said he knew personallv
one family which had left Australia because
some of its members had been compelled to
drill with the rough State school boys ; and
on account of this huge misfortune to the
Commonwealth, he advocated a scheme of
purchasing exemption from service. If there
were a branch of learning to be described as
Fatprotectionology or something of the kind,
MacDonald might shine as its professor; but,
on the bare face of things, the man who
advocates the recognition of a social ine-
quality based upon cash can have no decent
claim to a scientific outlook on social pro-
lems As for the family who left Australia
well, just as there are weeds that a garden
would be better without, so there are families
that merely take up the room that better
people might occupy. Whenever we are told
of somebody being driven out of Australia
are supposed to be shocked, and generallv
are. It is time we got out of the habit.
A FACULTY OF FLOGGING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The manner in which he swung the cat excited the
admiration of even the blase prison officials. His
efficiency he attributes to the application of brains to
his work. While it has been customary among pre-
vious unlettered flagellators to rely' on main strength
and stupidity, “The Native Cat” applies modern
scientific thought to his methods, with the result, he
claims, that far more pain can be inflicted and far
more bitter cries extracted from the subject.
—Newspaper report of the recent Melbourne floggings.

and field ;
Our trading trebles at its touch, our lands increase
their yield;
The wheels of industry roar on before its giant force;
It is the very pulse of life, its being and its source.
In olden days, left far behind, the man of strength
was king;
And he whose fist was like a hoof was first in every-
thing.
The self-made teacher of the tribe (though slow of
wit was he),
’Twas sad to note how dull his points through sheer
stupidity.
Quite aimlessly he’d brain a wight with one impatient
blow.
He could not understand at all the' surer way, but
slow,
To instil education and enforce the tribal rules,
Was scientific method for the poor benighted fools.
A clod who had his eyes put out with white-hot
copper wires,
Or limbs torn out of shape by racks, or half cooked
in the fires,
Would learn at once the truth of all the morals he
was taught.
His doubts, of course, would disappear, his instincts
go for naught.
’Tis by the science of the beast and not the strength
of him
That those great lessons of the Christ can reach the
faint soul; dim,
Unconscious almost, it is born. And thus to-day we
know
The surer way to drive them home compared with
long ago.
Yet, still we’re far from up-to-date, and lag behind
our needs
To swell the moral harvest and reduce the mental
weeds.
The time is ripe for Science to compel the blind to
see—-
We need a Chair of Flogging at the University!
Some skilled “professor” doing time at Pentridge
might be got;
Some full-fledged felon hid away for blood spilt
steaming hot;
A modern Prophet of the Cat with knotted, bulging
hands,
And claw-like fingers deft to catch and spread the
clotted strands.
All undergraduates would reach his lecture-room at
last,
When all the other sciences and cultures had been
past.
Equipped with everything but one grand scientific
plan,
They learn to flog “the double cross” to prove their
case to man.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Motor-Boat Speed Championship
contest on Port Jackson, on Saturday, was not a
thrilling business. To begin with, although it was
an Australasian championship, N.S. W. was the only
State represented, and not over-represented at that.
All sorts of wild stories were told of “dark horses’’
and new boats that would do wonders ; but when the
boats faced the starter there were only a familiar
four —Hordern’s Kangaroo, Relph’s Meteor, Monck’s
Rainbow and Taylor and Harvey’s XQQ-Me. The
Rainbow was the boat which made a sen-
sational dive to the bottom of the harbor
a week or so ago. The fact that it appeared
and ran suggests that the owner and repairer are
men who can get a hustle on. Crowds had congre-
gated along the harbor foreshores, wherever the boats
could be seen on the run between Rose Bay and
Manly. Weather conditions were absolutely perfect.
The first start was a failure, but the second was ex-
cellent. Kangaroo, Meteor and Rainbow were engaged.
They held one another beautifully over the first mile.
Then Relph had to retire. Something went wrong
with the cylinders. Rainbow was behind Kangaroo,
and hanging on well; but suddenly it was made plain
that Kangaroo had not been let go. Like a bullet
from a rifle it went away from Rainbow, with a
triumphant roar like a battery gf Vickers-Maxims.
The other responded gamely, but had no hope. Kan-
garoo cut out the trip in 38min. 35sec., equal to
29.8 miles per hour. Rainbow crawled home in
46min. 37sec., equal to 24.6 miles per hour—a very
moderate speed for a championship aspirant. It was
found there was no boat to make a second heat with
XQQ-Me, so the second heat became the final, and
Kangaroo, Rainbow and the boat with the trick mon-
niker lined up together. Rainbow did a little better,
but XQQ-Me could make only 22.6 miles an hour.
Kangaroo cut out at the rate of 29.15 miles an hour,
and Rainbow went up to 26.12. Rainbow will evi-
dently improve with running. Anyhow, it did splen-
didly for a boat which four days before was at the
bottom of the harbor.
Running speed boats is a ticklish busi-
ness. Take Relph’s case. The Meteor has twice served
him a scurvy trick. Last season when the finishing
touches were being put on, it threw its owners
overboard, and Mr. Relph just managed to kick the
clutch out as he shot. The engine nearly raced itself
to pieces before he could get on board again. This
time the brute came to the starting line and actually
got going; then the cylinder head cracked across.
Yet there are people who refuse to believe that boats
and engines have any individuality. James and
Moseley have another Stubborn craft of the same
temper. It is a hydroplane, Sydney built, engine
and all. Just before leaving Lavender Bay for the
club house at Rose Bay the brute broke a coupling,
and made it plain it was not raging that afternoon.
Engines, like horses, have to be broken in. The
Rainbow’s sister-boat, Peerless, also failed to put in
an appearance, for reasons the writer wots not of.
Most probably it was just sheer engine-cussedness.
Rainbow itself had evidently been affected by the
stay under water, as it failed to make the 35 miles
an hour it was alleged to be doing when it took that
sensational plunge. Kangaroo ran like the perfect,
well-trained craft it is. At one part of the race this
boat soared up to 35 miles an hour, and was ap-
parently in no way distressed. It is doubtful if Syd-
ney has seen the splendid craft really trying very
hard. About 35 miles an hour is the top speed it
has shown on Sydney Harbor, but under another
name, at Monaco, it put up over 40 without being in
any way forced, just before being acquired by voung
Anthony Hordern. There is little doubt that' it is
capable of something like 42 when pressed, so the
man who proposes to lower the Kangaroo’s tail has
to build on a 45 miles-an-hour limit —which is tall
going.
* * * *
Altogether, Sydney Harbor was a great
sight on Saturday afternoon, being almost floored
over with craft of one sort and another, from the
tiny gliding elcoplane Rainbow to the towering
Rawhiti, sweeping along like some great white-
winged bird of the sea. The Prince Alfred Yacht Club
was running a double-barrelled ocean race. The A
Division (Dreadnoughts of 10 metres and over) was
made up of Culwulla 111., Rawhiti and the ancient
flier Thelma; the B section (under 10 metres) in-
cluded Yeulba, Rawhiti 11., Petrel, Aoma an,d
Ranee. The little Magic was absent. It was a
perfect day for spectators, the wind being light and
the water smooth. The. club officials were on the
steamer Emu, and gave the passengers a royal time.
AVhat wind there was came from the north-east,
and the whole squadron hoisted topsails for the start,
and made a brave display. Of the A division, Cul-
wulla was easily the most sprightly, and began to
draw away from Thelma. Rawhiti did not get going
till five minutes after these two. and then got close
under the lee of Bradley’s Head. Culwulla led the
way to the Heads, and then came to a sudden stop
through the carrying away of the topsail. This had
to be lowered and reset; and while it was being
done, the others came dipping gracefully along.
Once outside, the usual manoeuvring took place, and
out of the juggling Rawhiti came first on a dying
breeze. Thelma, unable to rake up enough breath
to keep properly going, retired, and left Culwulla
111. and Rawhiti to fight it out. Rawhiti rounded
the ocean mark 2min. 2sec. ahead of Culwulla. Then
sky and sea were blotted out under the mighty
spread of canvas, every puff being necessary. In
the halcyon calm under North Head, on the home
run, Rawhiti could just move ; Culwulla came creep-
ing up, and the margin of two minutes odd was
reduced to a few lengths at Bradley’s Head. After
rounding that point, a luffing match took place for
what wind there was, and Culwulla got it. Seeing
the case was hopeless, Rawhiti took in the extras,
and Culwulla drifted home with lmin. 50see. to
spare.
There was more battling in the race of the B
division. After the handicap boats had got away,
there was a struggle btween Yeulba and Petrel for
the weather position, and Petrel won. When they
did get going they began to overhaul the long
markers fairly quickly, and the front boats were
overhauling one another, the nutshell Rawhiti 11.
sailing well in the phantom breeze, and Aoma
drawing away from Ranee. But it was not till the
Heads were passed that the scratch boats came up with
Ranee, the tail of the front division. Outside, Aoma be-
gan to close on the little Rawhiti 11., and the scratch
boats closed on all of them. Once really into the
ocean the squadron scattered in different directions
with a view to getting a straight beat for the mark.
That was the decisive part of the race. As they
crawled over the long beat to the turning point it
was evident to those on the steamer that, barring
accidents, it was Yeulba’s race; and this boat led
Rawhiti 11. round the mark by 2min. 27sec. Aoma
was nearly smin. behind the second, Petrel lOmin.
behind the first, and Ranee 2min. later still. Then
they started for home, and Yeulba increased the lead
as she went. It was quite an orderly procession,
Petrel’s overtaking and passing Aoma being the
only change in position. Yeulba won by 9min.
15sec., which was fairly decisive iu that make-
believe breeze.

There was a time when the regular ring-
sider at Sydney Stadium could gather during the
progress of the scrap which man was likely to get
the verdict; but those days and nights are past.
Now only fools and drunks venture to prophesy.
Saturday night’s battle between Poesy, of France,
and Hock Keys, of Australia, was a ease in point.
It went the full 20 rounds, and it was not till the
fifth that Poesy got a look in at all. Till half-way
through that round he was banged and walloped and
biffed, just when, where and how Keys liked. He
fought back gallantly, but" Australia’s Old Master
was altogether too skilful; and while he had the
freshness to show his skill at its best, the French-
man was the anvil on which he beat his bruising
masterpiece. In the fifth the Frenchman did cer-
tainly land a few right crosses. But Keys continued
to jab and stab, and in the eighth round split the
visitor’s chin like an apple. Poesy developed a
curious style of defence. He simply let himself go
and whirled in a mass of revolving, coruscating fists,
and tried to smother the Australian, who deftly kept
out of range. It was the ganie to play, for there
was sting in that wild blizzard of wallops. In the
ninth Keys backed on to the ropes. Poesy sud-
denly crowded on to him, and served up some heavy
ones; but Keys managed to duck out, although
somewhat rattled. After that Keys resumed the
offensive, and in the 14th was following up a fast
attack when Poesy sent a heavy right to the chin.
Keys staggered back ; Poesy rushed him and show-
ered blows, beating down Keys’s fainting guard and
knocking him down. He had taken five seconds
when the gong went. When he came up for the
15th he had not properly recovered, and put in the
round sparring for wind. He had to hustle con-
siderably to catch it, though. Of course, that round
was altogether the Frenchman’s. The next two
saw Keys come back in an amazing style. He drove
the left into the Gallic countenance repeatedly, and
made a punching-bag of it. Then his strength again
gave out, and during the rest of the fight things were
just about even, although Poesy was doing most of
the leading. The verdict went to Poesy, presum-
ably on the strength of the narrow escape from the
knock-out. But the point is that during the first
part of the fight Keys was aggressive always, and
landed the blows ; and during the second part, which,
with the exception of about three rounds, was dis-
tinctly defensive, Keys’s defence was too good for
Poesy’s attack. However, the chief consideration
is that it was a good, interesting fight, fought with
scrupulous fairness.
At Brisbane the scrap between Leon
Truffier and 'Joe Russell, for the Australian feather-
weight championship, found the Australian a distinct
favorite among those who back their fancy with
cash. The pair made it very fast and very willing,
and for six tremendous rounds the Gallic whirlwind
fairly smothered Russell. Then his boiler began to
feel the strain, and he easfed up. Russell took a
hand at this stage, and ran baresark for a couple of
rounds; but France came back in the ninth and
10th, only to go to pieces in the 12th, when he
seemed to suddenly lose the power of fighting back.
Before the gong went he suddenly turned, and, limp-
ing to his corner, declared he had been hit low, and
claimed the fight on a foul. The doctor declared no
blow had landed out of bounds, and Russell got the
verdict.
* * * *
Johnson’s best automobile and the gorge-
ous fittings of his amazing cafe have been sold to
satisfy a judgment. This is either evidence that all
the monev has gone, or a dark scheme on the part of
Johnson to convince his tormentors that he has no
more money, in the hope that the pursuit will drop. He
says he is anxious to get back to the ring and earn
something. The first thing that struck him after
that declaration was an order forbidding his entry
to a sporting establishment where he had been
allowed to box right through his troubles. Presum-
ably that club was like the rest of the world, disin-
clined to be too hard on a man as long as he had
money.
The widely-advertised importation of
“Young Jack Redmond, of America” to fight at
Sydney Stadium has ended in a joke. He was to
have left his old Amurkan home on the 22nd of
this month for the wilds of Sydney, a trusting man-
agement passed his photograph to. the press, and
the scribes grew enthusiastic over his record. Then,
despite contracts, business faith, pugilistic integrity
and all the rest, Young Jack Redmond, of America,
cables that he is not coming. And the reason:
“My wife won’t let me!”
Vic. cricketers resumed their devotions on
Saturday, after three weeks given to the serious
business of inter-State scuffles. The games were im-
portant to the flannelled —er —gentlemen, inasmuch
as the leading teams were colliding, and defeat meant
probable outing from premiership chances. The day
being fairly mild —150° in the sun —fully 3000 spec-
tators bestowed themselves in the cool, shady grand-
stand at ’Roy, while their champions chased the ball
that East’s warriors were smacking around. The
latter, however, weren’t any too hefty, only E. V.
Carroll (95) doing anything solid, and the tally was
221. If ’Rov can’t beat this next Saturday it de-
serves to lose. Northcote, against North, began slowly,
but continued firmly, making 123 for two wickets.
’Wood struck disaster in St. Kilda, the State’s only
respectable left-hand bowler, F. G. Moule, going
through the side like a bush fire through a grazing
lease, and taking five wickets for 23 on a batsman’s
wicket, while hisf mates, Addison and Fitzpatrick, got
three for 39 and two for seven. ’Wood’s main hone
of staving off defeat now is bowler Ryder, and as the
Saints had accumulated 111 (Hitchen 62) by six
o’clock, the feat is hardly possible. The collision of
Essendon and Carlton was of no moment, both teams
being thus early outed to all intents; and a similar
remark applies to the P’ran-Richmond bout. ’Varsity,
having the bye, indulged in a little recreation with
Coburg, of tlie Sub-districts ; the latter went in first
and made 155, which score is nothing out of the
common, and only notable because of the uprising
of that reliable old slogger Sundries, who compiled
36, mostly behind the wicket. His score was 10
better than the best* of his mates. *
The Sheffield Shield motoh between South
Aus. and the Ma State, at Sydney on Friday and
Saturday, was remarkable for the old brigade’s re-
turn to form. Trumper, the “champagne of cricket”
of old, sent his crowd drunk with enthusiasm by the
stvle in which he whacked 201 and carried his bat.
He was ably backed up by C. G. Macartney, who
made 125 before Bridgeman caught him off Craw-
ford; and when South Aus. got to the wickets, it
was the ancient warhorse, Clem Hill, who carried
138 to the scoring board. And in the second innings
Macartney made top score (96), while Hill once
more showed Sydney a taste of his brilliant hitting.
The brilliant feature of S. Australia’s
fight against N.S.W. in the first innings was the
wicket-keeping of' Campbell. In the Ma State total
of 513 (put together in 347 min.), the S.A.
“stumper” guarded his sticks so carefully that only
10 sundries were included in the total, in addition
to which he caught and stumped two of N.S.W.’s
warriors. Campbell looms up as the best South Aus.
“keeper” since the days when A. H. Jarvis was
half a team in himself.
There were four beautiful catches in the
early part of the S.A.-N.S.W. match. Bridgeman,
of South Oss., grabbed two tremendous sky-crackers
on the edge of the track; and Bardsley, of N.S.W.,
took a cannon shot from Crawford and a star-punc-
turer from Hill in “the country.” Good deeds like
these shine like virtue in a sinful world.
More startling cricket from Bathurst
(N.S.W,). Playing for the Lagoon Club against
Dunkeld, on Saturday, C. McSpedden did it quite
alone. In the first innings he bagged three wickets
for four runs; in the second, five for one run, in-
cluding the hat-trick. So his total tally was eight
wickets for five runs. Despite this demonstration,
Lagoon managed to scramble through with only 36
to the good.
* » * *
N.S.W. Country team,' with hayseed in
its hair and burrs in its socks, descended on Sydney
last week, but were outed by seven wickets.
The scoring on both sides was poor, country making
92 and 203, and the Metropolis 187 and 116 for
three wickets. The general lack of form on the
part of the Country suggests that cricket has been
neglected in the wild pursuit of the pumpkin.
All the “retirement” guff so liberally scat-
tered by Dick Arnst not so very long ago can now
be measured at its real value. Richard notifies that
he contemplates once more taking part in the rush
for the loot. There’s a gilded offer from the U.S.A.
to show the Yankees how to do it, and talk of going
on from there to shake up Barry once more. With
proper training, Arnst no doubt could shake up a
lot of them very much indeed ; but they do say that
he has taken a violent dislike to hard training.
There certainly isn’t much fun in it.
James Paddon, the new star on the
N.S.W. sculling horizon, is a burly Australian
indeed. Fined down, he kicks the beam at list.,
is 6ft. 41in. high, and has a chest measurement of
42in. When he stands up and makes a cross of
himself he stretches 7 ft. from finger-tip to tip; so
he has the reach which is supposed to give swing to
his abnormal strength. On February 15, he will
show what he can do against Alf Felton on the
waters of the classic Parramatta.

Longworth’s winning of the 100yds. State
Amateur Championship on Saturday was a mighty
close thing. About 3000 people were crowded into
Sydney’s big Domain baths to watch the tussles, and
the race for the championship was alone worth the
money. Lovely woman was there in a multitude, and
she who loves a Roman flavor in her sport got it.
At 60yds. Longworth was right in front, swimming
like a machine, and an apparent cert. But at 75yds.
E. Wickham spurted on the opposite side of the bath,
and shooting past the opposition, seemed to draw
level with the streaking Longworth. They were prac-
tically level, but Longworth’s arm flashed out first,
and he won by the touch. It was a well-contested
race. Longworth won it in 57 4-ssec. ; the last of
the bunch of five lost it in 59 l-ssec. This is pro-
bably the only occasion in which all the competitors
in a race have covered the 100 in less than the
minute. Longworth came forth once more for the
Half-mile, and therein he had a comparatively easy
time. His nearest competitor was Smith, of Coogee,
who was suffering from a cold, and was playing the
goat by swimming against his doctor’s orders. As he
was 27yds. behind at the finish, it is doubtful if the
affair could be styled a race. There should be some
medical inspection of the racers before they start;
a reckless stunt like that of young Sam Smith’s
might easily end in something unpleasant. The
Roman streak came in at the high diving display,
when McCarthy landed on his back from a height
of 60ft. and injured his spine, and Stevenson came
down on his diaphragm, and “hurt hisself all over.”
McCarthy had to be removed to the hospital in an
ambulance. It is feared he will be laid up for some
time, having sustained a severe twisting wrench of
the spine. Stevenson recovered very quickly.
On Monday night Longworth was again in evi-
dence in the Mile Championship of the State. It was
a mere swim-over for him, as there was nobody about
to dispute his right. He had only two opponents,
and he beat the better of them, young Adrian, of
Manly, by about 75 yards. Brady, the other man,
was hull down on the horizon.
The G.-G. and his lady and local Gov.
Fuller gave their patronage last week to a Melbourne
race meeting in aid of the V.R.C.’s Distressed and
Disabled Jockeys’ Fund. Habitual race-goers, as a
rule, have no consideration to spare for the per-
formers who fall by the way in the dangerous game
they bet upon. There ought to be homes for impov-
erished jockeys and trainers, not forgetting the
widows thereof, corresponding to the homes for de-
cayed mummers. What’s the matter with the idea
of taking up a collection on each of the big race-
courses on the biggest Cup day of the year in aid
of such refuges?
* * * *
“Bloggs” : A cable message last week rah
as follows: —“The post-office at Wye yesterday was
flooded with hundreds of meaningless telegrams, sent
with the purpose of effecting a starting-price job.
The idea was to prevent the starting-price bookmak-
ers from transmitting money betted to the racecourse,
and thus shortening the odds.” It casts a humorous
sidelight on the way the wire is so often employed
for the purposes of racing swindles in the Cold
Land. In England 1000 people bet for every one
sportsman who goes racing. Wye is a paltry little
provincial course, where rather inferior steeplechasing
rages all the winter. But a red-hot good thing savors
as sweet, financially speaking, at Wye as at Liver-
pool. In this case, doubtless, a gang of “heads” had
a certainty which they had backed in London at what-
ever the starting price should be on the course. The
starting price is made partly by the wagers laid in
the ring, but in an infinitely greater degree by the
bets which come over the wires. The less money
there was for the hot thing, the longer, obviously,
would be its price. By clogging the Wve office with
wires relating to politics, domestic events and so
forth, the conspirators would have a likely chance
of sending their choice out at 33 to one against, or
some satisfactory figure like that. The cutest swindle
ever worked on a trusting peneiller was brought off
bv the agency of the wire. One villain called at a
telegraph office with a vast sheaf of wires, got them
all marked, say, 2.45 p.m., and started putting them
through. At 3.7 p.m. his confederate dived in with
the news that Blight had won the Cup at 3 o’clock.
A vast wager on Blight was promptly despatched to
a bookmaker of standing, under the glozing caption
2.45 p.m. He paid unsuspectingly, and he and his
fellow books continued to do the same, under simi-
lar outrageous conditions, for some time.
The sport of going racing without budging from
one’s own fireside, so to speak, flourishes in London.
It is best enjoyed in a club (the Gazing Room of the
Raleigh, for example) or in the offices of a prosper-
ous firm of bookmakers. Here, with good servants,
drinks and cigars handy, the “lover of horse-flesh”
sits in a deep arm-chair, over against a gracious fire,
and watches the tape-machine. Five minutes pre-
viously he has backed his fancy in an adjoining
office. He sees the field finishing—that is, he sees
the names of the first three horses being spelt out
slowly on the thin strip of paper which coils tire-
lessly into the adjacent w.p.b. He gets all the ex-
citement, all the financial gain or loss of genuine
racing, and none of the noise and bustle and wet feet
and rheumatism. The phrase, “ruined on the turf,”
is largely a misnomer nowadays. Ruined on the
Russia leather, or on the washable chintz covers,
would express the situation of the up-to-date plunger
more accurately.

J. Scobie’s luck has not been too good of
late in big races, but with two in each event he

Manly, Sydney’s favorite seaside village,
began its week’s carnival on Saturday; and all the
world and his wife have been there to bathe and
frisk round in light attire. And there came, also,
all the “blue-bottles” in the Pacific, they and their
wives and their little ones. When the visiting
humans trod on the blue-bottles, there were wild
yelps and roars for a doctor. Some of the stings
were particularly virulent, and a few patients, show-
ing signs of collapse, had to be given medical atten-
tion. Two of them had to have strychnine in-
jected. Medical advice is, when introduced to a
bluebottle, to shake it off immediately, and rub
the spot with a handful of wet sand. Ammonia can
be used afterwards; but wet sand is the first aid.
The sooner the sand is applied, the shorter the
agony—and it is agony.
* * * *
C. Mundy, one of the first finishers in
the recent Motor-Cycle Reliability Test, having de-
termined to ride back to Melbourne, decided to have
a shot at the record established by N.S.W. rider J.
Fair, whose figures were 29hr. 43sec. Mundy set
himself a schedule which would, if maintained, have
landed him in Melbourne in 25hr. ' But he struck
trouble on the rough road between Gundagai and
Germanton, and instead of reaching Albury 6.18
а. Wednesday, did not arrive there till 11.50 a.m.,
and then he took another lOmin. for food and fuel.
However, he made up an hour on the run to Benalla,
which he reached at 3.45. Seymour was passed at
б. and the home wharf at Melbourne G.P.O. tied
up to at 9.40 p.m. He had not kept to his schedule,
but he had chipped 13min. off Fair’s record. He
rode a 34-h.p. Rudge machine shod with Continentals
in both the Reliability Test and the Record Run,
and got through without any troubles at all.
Horse reporters comment on the recent
epidemic of exciting dead heats and half-dead victories
in the racing around Melbourne as though it were
due to the excellence of the handicapping and the
vigilance of stipendiary stewards in promoting earnest
endeavor among the jockeys. As a matter of fact,
the clusters of nags that could be covered with the
proverbial tablecloth when they pass the post, are
very second-rate animals, not thoroughly wound up ;
and the jockeyship, as a rule, is so poor that any-
thing may win. All the conditions tend to close
finishes. They almost justify Moses in bawling, “Two
to one on the field, three to one bar one, four to one bar
two and six to one bar three,” in a field of 10 pos-
sible winners. If the punters are ready to accept
short prices about several of the runners, why offer
tempting odds against the unbacked ones that are
quite likely to win ? The Tote may commit such follies,
but not a level-headed bookmaker. His long prices
exist only in newspaper reports of the betting, and
9-Pply only to losers. For instance, the rank outsider
Positus nearly won the Standish Handicap at Flem-
lngton on New V ear’s Day. His starting price was
50 to one m a newspaper report. A punter, pushing
his way around the betting paddock, would have had
hard work to get 20 to one about Positus, although
there were 19 starters for the race, and the first
favorite was backed at threes. Bookmakers prefer to
have the unfancied horses running for their book
when they can “get round” on the volume bv laying
on es. That’s how it comes"to pass
Moses wins so much larger a percentage of the
money he takes than the totalisator does. He
aS „ laid A a verv , lcm £ P rice against the occasional
turn-up. As a rule he has not written its name.

ALL STATES
AND N.Z.
“ Jeames” discloses some secrets :
Sydney Daily Telegraph, discussing the new play,
“Milestones,” remarks sadly that “Mr. Preece’s ex-
perience as a member of the House of Commons had
not polished him sufficiently to enable him to avoid
an oath in the presence of a lady.” The oath which
scandalises the Telegraph is “By God!” Speaking
as one who has seen service in some of the best
families in England, and who, but for the demon
Alcohol—but enough. Speaking, I say, as one with
personal knowledge of the subject, I am able to
state confidently that to the average British Parlia-
mentarian of birth, such an expletive as “By God!”
would appear ridiculously inadequate to meet most
of life’s more exasperating situations—and that
whether ladies were present or not. Lord Lonsdale,
the Kaiser’s intimate friend, and a persona grata at
the Court of our own gracious King and Queen, is
a notorious hard swearer. As master of some of the
post fashionable packs of foxhounds in the United
Kingdom, his language to those who were guilty of
such offences as heading the fox, jumping on or near
the hounds, riding kickers and so forth, has at all
times been absolutely lurid. It would not have been
tolerated for an instant, even in the case of the
butler himself, in any genteel servants’ hall. For
that matter, it would have got his Lordship arrested
had he used it in a police-frequented street. But
the ladies present didn’t mind, and neither did the
gentlemen. The old Duke of Cambridge habitually
used oaths that made my blood curdle when I heard
them ; and he paid not the slightest attention to the
presence of ladies when enraged to cursing point.
Our own King can swear more than a bit, on occa-
sion, as those who were privileged to meet him when
he was here as Prince of Wales 12 years ago will
readily testify. To sum up, polish does not prevent
the modern Society man from using oaths in the
presence of ladies. The only social circles in which
the practice of saying nothing stronger than “blow,”
“dash” and what not, in the presence of the “fair
sex ” still obtains, are those which inhabit such
suburbs as Balham and N. Hampstead. It is a sad
admission for one who loves the upper classes to be
compelled to make, but the truth will out.

POST HOLE DIGGER
The “Iwan” is the original Post
Hole Digger, and a success because it’s
built right.
Light, rigid, durable, and perfectly
balanced, has no adjustable parts to
wobble about or stick.
Bores holes in any ground, cuts the
hole in a fraction of time taken with
bar and spade, empties with a shake,
and leaves you little ramming. No man
need rack his back with old-fashioned
methods of fencing, when the “Iwan”
does the job so easily, and costs but a
few shillings. You can build about 18
chains a day with the “Iwan,” or if
you want to bore for water it sinks
to 15ft.

In relating grim and ghastly yarns
My father was far from Dull
And one of his marrow freezers was
The yarn of the moving skull.
Though years have passed since he spun the
yarn
One night in the dear old Home
On the sexton grim and gruesome skull
I pen the following poem.
In an old burial grounds
A sexton Brave
Unearthed a skull while
Digging a grave,
He glanced at the skull
Worm-eaten and grim
Which twisted around and
Advanced towards him,
With a smile the old sexton
Undaunted and rough
Exclaimed alas poor yorrick
And picked the head up, •
When from without two moles
Speedily glided out
And the horrid skull ceased
To move about.

C. J. Hatton supplies the other side of the
bacon: —
There is not a word of truth in the paragraph
by ‘Fax (B. 19/12/’l2), re the bacon business of
Victoria. The Dandenong Co-operative Co. spent
the money it received from the trustful farmers
in putting up a great factory, capable of handling
the bacon trade of Australia, and forgot that some
money would he required to run the business. That
is exactly the position it is in to-day, but it is ap-
parently using every means to impress the farmers
that the fault was not the directors’—if “Fax”
speaks for them. So far as his statement goes about
Private Enterprise crushing the farmers, the reverse
may be said, inasmuch as the farmers have been
getting prices during the past 12 months which
hardly any other part of the world ever sees for
bacon pigs. For the six months from January to
June the average price this (Melbourne) branch of
J. C. Hutton Pty., Ltd., paid for pigs landed
at our Preston (Vic.) works was 5.29 d. per lb.
Usually that period represents the most productive
season of the year, when pigs are at the cheapest point.
If the farmers cannot make it pay at those prices
in the flush season—well, they had better give up the
business. Since June the following prices have been
paid:—
July average . . . . 5.66 d. per lb.
August „ . . . . 7.72 d. „ „
September ~ .. .. 8.22 d. ~ ~
October ~ .. .. 6.79 d. ~ ~
In November (the month in which the Dandenong
factory apparently found itself in trouble with its
stock, and because it had made no provision for
carrying on its business) the following prices were
paid:—
For week ending 2nd .. 6.89 d. per lb.
„ ~ „ 9th .. 6 88d.
„ „ „ 16th . . 6.91 d. „ „
„ „ „ 23rd .. 7.14 d. „ „
„ „ „ 30th .. 6.96 d. „ „
This does not indicate in any way that at the time
mentioned in “Fax’s” paragraph, “the bottom had
fallen out of the market,” owing to the co-operative
co. having been forced to stand out of the market.
It is very apparent that some people wish to cover
their own unbusiness-like methods, and make it ap-
pear that the greatest enemies of the farmers are the
men who have built up the bacon-curing trade
throughout Australia, and are still doing better for
them than any co-operative co. can hope to do; for
co-operative concerns in Australia, so far as the
bacon trade is concerned, are the weakest possible
sellers, and any co. or organisation that will break
prices cannot be any great friend of the farmers, for
bad selling of products must mean low prices for
pigs. The sooner that fact gets into the minds of the
farmers the better for their banking accounts.
“Chasuble” barks at the shepherds:—
The Bush Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd, work-
ing from Dubbo (N.S.W.), has had praise from The
Bulletin, and has deserved it, from the days of
Matthews, who wrote the book, onwards. The North
Queensland kindred body has acquired a new chief
one Halse. This is through a marriage. Celibacy
is the rule. It would be less objectionable if taken
ala Rome for life. What Ido object to is men
going in for five years’ bush work, with an under-
standing that afterwards they are to splice and go
to luxurious livings. Take your wives into the bush.
Marry bushwomen ! Don’t be a quasi-toff, waiting to
bloom into full toffdom. Make the bush your worthy
life work, satisfied that God made the country, man
the town. Otherwise you impair your influence. You
are good, but not so good. Away with this English
prunella, and the principle that labor is dishonorable
and work disgraceful.

Do You Odolise ?
Odol, the World’s Dentifrice, is the
preparation to use, for a few drops mixed
with a tumbler of water make an emulsion
which will thoroughly cleanse and purify
the oral cavity, destroying all injurious
bacteria.
it is the rinsing of the mouth and
the brushing of the teeth with this anti-
septic and delightfully refreshing mixture
that constitutes the process now known
as Odolising.
Odol penetrates the interstices in and
between the teeth and permeates the
gums and mucous membrane of the
mouth, exerting its marvellous powers
not only during the few moments while
using it, but for hours afterwards.

An Interesting-
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger

Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
1 am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, 1 fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly* plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the

%vas astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

The Inky Way
“E.O’F.”: One day lately I picked up my daily
paper and glimpsed the stirring headlines —“THE
LAST SHOT: A DESPERATE STRUGGLE.” With
a grateful sigh of thanks, I settled down and prepared
to read about a wounded policeman and a dead bur-
glar. I discovered instead that the whole beautiful
column was about a game of giant marbles, or bowls,
played by men who have lost the spring of their
tennis days. Seems to me the daily press is too
feverish these times. It has, or- it pretends to
have, an unlimited capacity for excitement; the
sporting specialists are allowed to rave as long as
they like ; and the most sedentary pastime is written
up as if it were a cross between a bull-fight and an
eruption. There is surely something idiotic in
describing a noiseless game of giant marbles (and
whisky) as “a desperate struggle” or “a fight to a
finish” —phrases that suggest kicking and throttling,
and pools of blood and corpses in heaps. Any writer
who applies hot and rebellious language to the slow,
green killtime seems to me to be working on the
wrong lines: it demands, rather, a grave devotional
style and plenty of rounded periods. Of course, this
is only personal opinion. I don’t perform the rink
devotions, and for all I know it may be a perfect
furnace of excitement. All I can say is it has not
got any of the usual symptoms.
“J.F.H.” : The lady journalist is a power here in
London. She has a society numbering 400 members,
a well-appointed club-house off Fleet-street and a fort-
nightly paper of her own —the Woman Journalist.
The society has just held its annual dinner at the
Criterion —the house where Spiers and Pond scored
their first big success after their migration from
Melbourne to London. Lord Northcliffe, the head of
the Harmsworths and the principal proprietor of the
Daily Mail, was the chief guest. He confessed that
he had been “happily associated” with lady journal-
ists ever since his earliest adventure in Fleet-street,
and now employed 300 of them in the production of
newspapers and magazines. They were loyal, sym-
pathetic and courageous comrades and ideal journal-
ists. Their powers of quick observation greatly
exceeded men’s, and there was a pertinacity about
them which made them highly successful inter-
viewers. When Li Hung Chang came to London, he
emphatically refused to admit a male journalist into
his presence. Yet the Daily Mail published an in-
terview with him, and a very good interview, too.
A woman did the trick. The boss of the Harms-
worths thinks few people realise the extent of the
revolution brought about by the advent of the she-
journalist. The coming of the woman writer in her
hundreds, he says, has brought out the woman reader
in her millions, and the woman reader has enormously
expanded the area of advertising; and that again
has enabled the present-day newspaper to do very
expensive things which it could not otherwise pos-
sibly attempt.
THE SYDNEY “DAILY TELEGRAPH’S"
SKYSCRAPER.
THE FACE AT THE THIRTEENTH-FLOOR WIN-
DOW “ Ah! This is something like a
building. Now I can look around without
getting my whiskers tangled up in the
traffic."
“Billy” Moore, of the Melbourne Inky Way (Bo-
hemian side), recently blossomed into a lecturer
before the Colonial Institute. “Australian Art and
Literature” was the title of the discourse, and the
Pie Commissioner was in the chair.
N.S.W.’s Comptroller-General of Prisons has just
started a weekly newspaper for his boarders. Hither-
to, the gaol bird has led an unnaturally cloistered
life. He has known nothing of the wars and revolu-
tions, the tragedies and other pleasantries, that were
occurring in the world outside. As one result, when
he emerged, it took him months to pick up the thread
of life in a proper fashion. The convict’s total ignor-
ance of international and other politics often caused
him to be mistaken by an importer, which annoyed
him and was awkward and undesirable in other
directions. The Compendium will obviate such con-
tretemps. It proposes to give the fallen brother,
week by week, a summary of the world’s most im-
portant news. However, for the good of the male-
factor’s soul, all such news items as murders, suc-
cessful burglaries, sensational divorces, breach of
promise actions, and so on, will be left out. Also,
there will be no blood and thunder serial, with a red-
hot interest sizzling through it. in fact, the
journal w’ill be something like a whisky and soda
with the whisky eliminated and the soda gone a
shade flat. But when one is in gaol one accepts
little crosses like these without a sigh.
Fred J. Ironside, the small man with the tall
hat, who wrote so much about cricket in Sydney,
was a son of James Ironside, a Sydney bill broker ; he
had a sister of some fame, Adelaide Ironside, poet-
ess and painter, who died in Rome, in 1867. The
late Fred Ironside was first employed on the S. M.
Herald under the original Fairfax; from there he
went to the Government Printing Office, where he
put in many years, and became chief reader —a post
from which he retired on pension in 1896.

The staff of Brisbane’s recently-launched Labor
paper, the Daily Standard, was combed from
Melbourne (editor), Sydney (sub-editor, chief of staff,
commercial editor, and three others), Maoriland
(sporting editor and another), Brisbane (cable editor
and lady inky-fingers), Townsville (one), Lismorc
(one) and Darling Downs (one). Australasian
“skeletons” should be a fairly easy business for the
telegraph sub., with that lot at his call.

Theßoyal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”-
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition,nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 months
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards
The * Allenburys Rusks. A
valuable addition t,o baby’s dietary
wnen ten months old and after These
Rusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the
cutting of teeth.

-TOR
The keen farmer judges by results
Here is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies inthefactthat
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay

THIEF ARTIST : “Oh, well, old boy, so long—
must get back to my ' crib' now."
Up at Chillagoe, the other day, the local
branch of the A.W.U. created a sensation
by organising a boycott against all pubs em-
ploying Chinese. But what about beginning
the patriotism nearer home? Hughenden,
Longreach, Charleville swarm with Chinese
tradesmen —and unionist customers !
George Cowlishaw, a dominating figure in
Brisbane journalism, passed in his checks a
tew days ago. He came of a Sydnev family
hnf iv S fu architect, by profession;
but. liking the smell of printers’ ink, he
secured with his brothers the control of the
Brisbane Telegraph some 35 years ago The
organ was in very low water at the time-
but under his capable fist it took new life
Griffith to h ° F r uf ars , the backbone of Sam
Griffith s big Liberal party. To-day its poli-
tics are pure h at. Cowlishaw died a wealthy
man. with the reputation of being a not
unkindly one when distress appealed to him.

Brother Binglii can be a snob, too. One
ot him, of the Ipswich district, wanting to
a Christmas treat on his kinsmen at
the Deebing Creek mission station, bought
a bottle of rum for them—and hired a motor-
car so that he might take it to the station
in a manner that would sufficiently impress
the poor niggers inside with the donor’s mag-
nificence. Unfortunately, something went
wrong with the works afterwards, and the
beautiful outburst ended in a week’s gaol.
Warwick, on the Darling Downs, is at
present just about as short of the wet stuff
it breaks down its whisky with as Yassberra
will be when Kink O’Malley has his capital
there. The town drainage goes into the
same chain of waterholes as the drinking
supply is drawn from, and the holes have so
little except drainage in them just now that
the local council warns the townspeople not
to drink the water, etc., without first boiling
U- Representations are now being made to
the Railway Department, which is going to
institute a pumping plant from the Conda-
mine, to increase the capacity so that the
town may get a drink, too.

Quoth Governor Macgregor, at the War-
wick Caledonian Society’s annual celebra-
tion :— :
Some one had said they could be just as good
soldiery in trousers as in kilts, but he was not at all
sure .of that. He thought it was well to maintain cer-
tain national characteristics. It would gratify him and
other Scotsmen to return to the kilts, and he did not
think it would be the worse for anyone else.
Well? There is no law in Bananaland to
prevent the Macgregor getting back to the
kilt as soon as he chooses, and if his Ex
can induce Donald Macintosh, M.L.A., to
don the petticoats wherewith he frightened
Arthur Morgan 40 years ago, and accom-
pany the representative of his Majesty (also
in full Highland fig) down Queen-street
daily, the spectacle will certainly gratify a
great many more people than the two Scots-
men themselves.
His Ex. Macgregor, reminiscing at the
toll-abolishing ceremony at the Burnett
Bridge—the only bridge in Australia where
dues were collected—remarked wistfully that
the clan Macgregor had in former days taken
a great deal of toll on the highways. This
recalls the case of another Queenslander.
Jack” Hamilton, M.P. for the Far North
for many years, and champion revolver-shot.
•Somebody said Jack’s prowess with pistol
and gun was something to be proud of.
‘Well, I dunno,” said Jack. “You see I
come of a border family that had to shoot
quick.”
Died the other day, in Brisbane, Tom
Carrol, one of the brothers in the firm of
Birch and Carrol, Queensland theatrical
managers. He was one of the best fellows
in the profession, and only those inside know
the number of lame dogs he helped over the
stile. He was only 31.
“P.F.": A sidelight on Wages Boards’
awards. A.* boy of 16, employed as a Bris-
bane carter’s helper, has his wage fixed at
dos. a week! Australia wants the highly
skilled tradesman very badly • but
there are few boys who will apprentice
themselves to trades at a low wage
tor three or four years while temp-
tations of this kind are waiting those
who won tbe apprenticed. A living wage is
good ; but one that attracts the youngster to
unskilled labor is a curse in the long run to
himself and the country.
From a man in the business:—
R ?“ rse Cowlishaw, the managing director of the
Brisbane Telegraph, who passed in his checks re-
el! 11 * was for 35 years the personality that made
that evening rag a political power. Its advertising
revenues come mainly from the shillings in the
Want columns. So the big advertiser Dlaved
second fiddle, and Cowlishaw at timls didn’t mind
ettmg him know it. Once a big politician, who was
? business advertiser, resented the Tele-
pmW L -XT 1 ' a 'l d called 0n Cowlishaw, threat-
ening to withdraw his advertising support. Cow-
lishaw rang his bell, and told the clerk to cancel the
naid S a Tn Ve , r 9 1S1Tlg l and return all the monev
paid. In 12 months that business man came to ask
for the reinsertion of his advts., and onlv had his
request granted after he had heard a sermon on press
Kuscobin on a shuddersome topic:—

hand as to whether he will wear the ballet
skirt of Caledonia, but 1 hae ma doots,
despite his note of admiration for it when
he bearded the Douglas and others in their
hall at Warwick.
Premier Denham and his wife spent the
New Year afloat on the waters of Moreton
Bay, using the Lucinda as houseboat. Yes-
terday they left for Sydney, whence they g 0
on to Melbourne and Adelaide.
The two clever Denham sisters are at pre-
sent in London, and are staying with the
Agent-General Robinsons. Next month
they are due at Stuttgart, Germany, where
a flourishing trade is done in polishing Eng-
lish and American brains and their various
imitations.
An English soldier man, Lieut.-Col. Har-
rison, of the Yorkshire Hussars, with his
wife and another lady, stepped ashore here
last Sunday, from the Kumano Maru. After
a cursory glance round, they departed south.
The party left England in October, and
went through Siberia, Korea, Manchuria,
Japan, Hongkong and Manila. After visit-
ing N. S. Wales, Victoria, Tassy and Maori-
land they will streak back to England by
way of Uncle Sam’s principal villages.
Under instructions from Cupid, dress-
makers have been working overtime of late
to build the glad marriage rags of handsome
Nellie Lawrence, who for many years has
taught the young and frivolous to two-step
and heel-shuffle in the most approved man
ner. The contract is to be signed during
February. Incidentally, Mr. Ted Oxley,
well known amongst tennis gladiators, is to
be the other party.
Bert Walter, well known as an amateur
mummer and a fine singer, was married at
All Saints’ on Thursday last to pretty Eva
Begg, of Kelvin Grove.
Two other recent starters in the matri-
monial stakes are Jack Surgeon, of Burde-
kin Downs station, and Miss Topping, of
Melbourne, a member of the erstwhile Merry
H idow Co. The risk was taken in Mel-
bourne.
Another wedding that will have lost the
first bloom of its novelty by the time this is
in print, is that of Charles Thorold, the
good-looking teacher at the Anglican High
School, at Southport, and Miss Jeffery, an
English girl. They are to be joined in the
firm, determined bonds of matrimony at
Melbourne on Wednesday (the 15th).
Gentle Mrs. Stevens, wife of the manag-
ing director of the local Courier, went to
her long rest this week, leaving six daugh-
ters and two sons to mourn. She arrived in
this State many years ago as a bride. Ada-
vale station, on the Warrego, was named
after her.
Another passing hence was that of Mrs.
Hipwood, Mayoress in 1886 and 1887, and
wife of Mr. J. Hipwood, founder of the firm
that bears his name. She was a Maori-
lander by birth, but had enjoyed about 40
of the best years of her life in Bananaland.
The Courier, in a breathless par., this
week stated that some person or persons
(unnamed) had seen a lion strolling down
the boulevard near Townsville. Probably
it was only the Anti-Sosh tiger practising
on the hard road it will have to travel pre-
sently.
Southport, the largest and most conveni-
ent watering place near Brisbane, has long
been unnerved by a pier that trembled
undei toot and shuddered in the sea breezes
as if tired of life. When the Maid of Sker,
a vessel somewhat smaller than the Titanic,
hit the spavined structure, it wobbled more
despairingly than ever, and the local coun-
cil hurriedly railed it off as a promenade,
but continued to allow boats to take up and
lower their burdens at the steps. Now it
strikes the council that the bridge might
topple over and ruin a good boat, or that a
good boat might butt into a bad bridge*
and far around with fragments strew the
sea. So a new pier is to be built and im-
provements are to be made generally.
Under-Secretary Boyne Hall, of the De-
partment of Justice, is sampling southern
brands of weather just now, and M.L.C.
h owles and wife are snowballing at
Katoomba.
Yours affectionately.

When you consider what your health
means to you, when you realise that it is,
perhaps, your greatest asset, surely
you will appreciate the absolute
necessity of maintaining a definite
and safe standard of physical and
mental fitness.
Unless you do so, any extra
exertion, any extra
worry, will not only
cause that “run
down ” and “ out-of-sorts ”
feeling, but is liable to undermine
your constitution and sap your vitality.
If you will take “Wincarnis,” “the
v/ine of life,” regularly, just for a
few days, you will be astonished
and delighted with the wonderful
improvement in your health, and
the increased vigor and vitality
“Wincarnis” will create.
“Wincarnis” will give you such
an abundance of renewed health
and strength that your whole
system will glow and pulsate
with new life.

ONE of the best proofs of R-C-H
value is the number of buyers
who heretofore have been
driving cars costing from to
£s°°-
And there’s a good reason for it. You
get in the R-C-H the utmost in comfort,
in looks and in strength. You get power
sufficient to take you and your family
wherever you want to go, and faster
than you’ll ever want to drive. You get
an economy of operation impossible in
the high-priced car. You get complete
equipment of the best quality. And you
save from £lOO to £2OO.
The easiest way to prove these things
is to let us demonstrate the R-C-II to
you. We’ll do it whenever you’re ready.
And we’re perfectly willing to abide by
your judgment.

ESTABLISHED 30 YEARS.
The Australian is still a casual cuss in
pretty frequent spots. Last year his Dead
Letter Office dealt with 1,662,897 missives,
packets, etc., whose owners could not by any
ingenuity be discovered. This was over half
a million more than in the previous year.
There were valuables in 3176 of these letters
—£17,392 17s. sd. worth of valuables. The
harassed officials did their best to discover
the owners, but as 82 of the letters, contain-
ing £709 6s. 4d., had no address either out-
side or in, and, nobody made any immediate
claim or complaint, they had poor luck. Yet
the chances are that each of those 82 con-
signors blamed and still blames the Depart-
ment for the loss, and sighs for the good old
days of State control when a penny stamp
cost tuppence, so to speak.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve c o m-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
ion from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
i?
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they ai;e never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

There are leather points to panel. Single or Double Girth Straps, whichever you prefer.

A Nasty Accident.
Little Girl’s Head Cut.
Rexona Effects a Rapid Cure.
There are so many uses for Rexona that a pot of this new Rapid Healing Oint-
ment should be kept in every home. One day it may be useful to cure the Bites
of Insects,. another day to heal the Cuts, Bruises or Scalds, which are forever
occurring in everyday life. Again, for the more serious complaints, such as
Eczema, Ringworms, and the various forms of Skin diseases, Rexona is a tried
and proved remedy.

A MOTHER’S EVIDENCE.
“My little girl, through falling on a sharp
tin, received a nasty gash on the back of the
head,” writes Mrs. J. Barron, 139 Alma Lane,
Rockhampton, Q. “It was about two inches
long, and deep, and it bled most profusely and
was very painful. I really thought I would have
to get it stitched. Luckily a neighbor
gave me some Rexona Ointment, and 1
applied it to the wound. It relieved the
pain and stopped the bleeding. (iradu =
ally the gaping wound commenced to
knit and heal up, and in about a week
the wound was completely cured.
I had also a little boy suffering
from a festered toe. Through it
being so bad he had to remain home
from school. I applied the oint=
ment to that also, and a couple
of applications cured it. 1 would
strongly advise all parents to keep
a pot of Rexona in their homes.”
EVERYONE NEEDS REXONA
Rexona is a Reliable Remedy for all Eruptions and Irritations of the Skin,
Sunburn, Piles, Eczema, Pimples, Sores, Chilblains, Chapped Hands, Sciatica,
Cuts, Burns, Bruises, Scalds, Bad Legs, Stings of Insects, and all kinds of
Inflammation. Rexona is sold only in triangular pots at 1/6, and in larger pots,
containing nearly four times the quantity, at 3/-.

HE sea had put his arm around
' I The wide waist of the land,
J- There was a pleasant kissing sound
Upon the yellow sand,
And all the little fishes found
It hard to understand.
For little fishes’ hearts are cold,
Except when warmed by cooks,
No hint of love their scales enfold
Even for baits and hooks;
So when Louise her line unrolled
They passed with scornful looks.
She sat upon a quiet stone,
Like some sad wedding guest,
While fleecy clouds were lightly blown
Out of the sleepy west;
But I am willing now to own
She fished her very best.
She caught a mullet and a crab,
A catfish and a cold ;
The sunlight touched her dress of drab
And burnished it to gold;
And little breezes sought to grab
Her hair with fingers bold.
Oh, very placid was her brow,
She sat the livelong day.
Like some still saint who makes no row
Except to kneel and pray ;
She seemed as patient as a cow
Yoked in a bullock dray.
The sun went climbing up the sky
Until he reached the top.
Then, like an acrobat on high,
Began his record drop;
He told one red and flaming lie,
And caused the day to stop.
Amid that flaunting of the west
Louise re-wound her line,
She felt that she had done her best
With patience and some twine ;
The time had come to take a rest,
And so she collared mine.
The evening kissed the green and drab
Lips of the ebbing sea,
Her captures lay upon a slab
Of rock close to her knee—
She had a catfish and a crab
An appetite and me.
Oh. little fishes’ eyes are bright,
For all their chilly look ;
But all her heart was warm that night
When she her task forsook ;
In fact, her task was done all right,
For I was on her hook.

II.—AH DAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Horse Ferry had its humorously
exasperating side. The boats were
high and flat and wouldn’t steer. I
have timed one to take three-quarters of an
hour for the trip from Blue’s Point to
Dawes Point, a distance of a little less than
half a mile. This included some half-dozen
attempts to make land. When the steering
gear or something went wrong, we’d have a
trip round the harbor thrown in for our
modest copper. The last time, I think, we
went twice round the flag-ship ; and the time
before that I had a nice little run up the
Parramatta River. I hadn’t been there for
years. On this occasion we came back on the
other rudder, and went into dock wrong end
first, with all the horses’ heads turned back
to Blue’s Point. They had big meat and
furniture vans and long timber trucks be-
hind them, and couldn’t turn. So the ferry
had to crawl back to Blue’s Point, where the
carts and vans and trucks were driven ashore
and turned round somehow, and brought
aboard again for another shot at it. I didn t
mind it much, only a big German training
ship was lying at Blue’s Point at the time,
and officers and cadets could look down and
smile on all this and on many other similar
manoeuvres going on daily in a very narrow
waterway, between Australia’s greatest city
and its nearest, wealthiest and most
fashionable front-garden suburb. That s
what galled me. Similar accidents occur
frequently on the passenger ferries; but it
doesn’t seem to matter, and it won t till the
big smash comes. And when that blows
over, it will go on not mattering. Sydney
people will stand anything. I remember the
years when they wouldn’t.
The Horse Ferry levels all, from the latest
expensive motor-car, with its load of veiled
and tailored tolerant disgust, to the little
turnout of Benno, the bottle-o, with his load
of disgust, but untailored and intolerant;
and so down to the derelict and the dead-
beat, working their way over at the tail ot
a friendly cart, because they haven t the
pennies to go through the turnstiles ot the
passenger ferries. Item: The black, covered,
unobtrusive undertaker’s cart, containing, in
the cheapest of contract shells, the last-
vacated earthly tenement—much damaged
and dilapidated, no doubt —of some friend-
less outcast, or pauner dead.
But this is the chronicle of my acquaint-
ance Ah Dam, a cousin (twice removed by
law) of my friend Ah See. and the son ot
old Ah Soon, whose tale I have told before.
At least his name wasn’t Ah Dam, but I
could see he felt like it, and lie sounded
like it occasionally, while he was tell-
ing me the story, in spite of the humor-
ously doleful smile, or grin, which is common
to white, black, yellow, brown and brindle
when they bump up against Aus-
tralian law. They don’t grin much when
they bump up against Chinese law at
least, not for long. Ah Dam told me that,
and his father told him.
I might have to use Ah Dam again, ,so
will tell you a little about him. He s a
Sydney-born Chinaman with a pigtail, ana
a merchant in a small way. His tatnc ,
native of Old China, made Ah Dam grow
the pig-tail, with the intention of taking the
boy to China some day, and he gave Ah
Dam a fairly good Chinese and English edu-
cation. Ihe old man went to China first,
to smooth over old matters, perhaps, but died
there before he could send for Ah Dam and
his mother. Whether the old ’un died of
Chinese old age, or got mixed up in Chinese
politics, or found that something that had
happened in China in his youthful and pre-
Australian days hadn’t been forgotten, Ah
Dam didn’t tell me. Perhaps he didn’t
know. Rut, in spite of its inconvenience,
and the time and trouble it cost, and the
derision it inspired in the bosom of dying-
out larrikinism, Ah Dam stuck to the pig-
tail, for the old man’s sake.
And from what I know of Ah Dam, and
in spite of his shortcomings in one respect,
I don’t believe that the spirit of his old man
has ever had cause to complain of any fail-
ure on the part of his Australian-born son
to do the right thing by his father’s
memory. Though for the sake of conveni-
ence in census returns and in other docu-
ments, and for personal reasons, and busi-
ness purposes occasionally, Ah Dam was
supposed to be C.E. (Church of England),
he told me “Confucius.”
His Chinese mother died —perhaps of a
Chinese woman’s broken Chinese heart
- —shortly after the news of the death
of his father. And Ah Dam carried on the
business, and prospered, and got the opium
habit (his father and afterwards his mother
had kept him carefully away from it —the
manner of the getting of the habit is an-
other story), and he married a half-caste
woman and had children.
I meant to say further back (but there
isn’t room for it now between the lines)
that Ah Dam met his Port Arthur by way
of the Horse Ferry and Elder Man’s Lane
that leads up from it to George-street.
His opium “jag” was costing him ss. a
day, and 7s. (3d. a night. So he went aboard
a boat from China, lying across the harbor,
and manned by a Chinese crew. There had
been preliminaries and arrangements, but
this is making the story short. “There were
14 of us,” he said, with the aforesaid smile ;
but the rest were caught after he had got
away. He blames himself for smoking that
night. He should, on that occasion, of all
occasions, have kept his senses unclouded.
(How many of us have failed to do that
same!) He seems to have got ashamed of
his associates rather early—common Chinese
forecastle coolies, and he a respectable and
respected Sydney Chinese seed merchant,
albeit in a small way. So he got one of the
crew to row him ashore, unostentatiously
(to avoid the bore and bother of farewells,
perhaps), just about daylight, and land him
in the scrubby, muddy, lmlk-encumbered
and nondescript little inlet between Neutral
Bay and North Sydney. He should have
gone round by Cammeray Park and loitered
about in the safe vicinity of the Chinese
gardens until a little more reasonable hour,
and then have boldly walked up and taken
the tram, like any decent vegetable or gar-
den Chinaman going in on business, or to
make purchases, or to consult his joss con-
cerning the weather. Rut Ah Ram did
none of these things. The spirit of the
opium-cloud, in which he was enveloped,
knew better than he did. Same as our
drink fumes know better than we.
Perhaps Ah Dam shrank from a chance
meeting with a Chinaman who knew him in
the way of business, and might _ tell an
acquaintance of his wife’s or his friends, or
his creditors (innocently enough, perhaps)
where he’d seen Ah Dam, and about what
time of the day. Besides, opium-smoking
was now an illegal offence, and severely pun-
ishable ; and Ah Dam might have simply
sought to cover no his immediate tracks tor
the sake of the fellow-smokers he had lett
behind on board, still smoking. Who can
fathom the Oriental mind?
Anyway, Ah Dam went right round by
devious ways to the Horse Ferry—the first
across, as it happened —where no decent
Chinaman was ever supposed to be without
a cart or basket. He sat down and looked
like nothing but a real Chinaman. There
were two other alleged Chinamen aboard,
with carts and baskets, but they were not
countrymen of his father’s ; and they looked
as bafflingly unconscious of his presence as
he of anyone’s. He gave up his ticket, and
strolled leisurely along Elder Man s Bane and
into George-street, and down round the cor-
ner to the Seamen’s Home, looking as bland
and innocent and as mildly, tolerantly and
benevolently interested in the world around
him as seven Chinamen. Then he was
aware, across the street on the opposite
corner, of my other friend, Detective O Kye,
looking also as bland and innocent and as
mildly, tolerantly and benevolently interested
in the world around him as 17 Chinamen.
It was a critical moment. Ah Dam knew
O’Kve by sight (and also by sound and
touch, for that matter), and the knowledge
was mutual. And Ah Dam was as Head
cert.” that O’Kye lwd noted him out of the
corners of his innocent Irish eyes as U Kye
was that Ah Dam had spotted him out of
tliG corners of his narrow, so.mewhat-slant-
ing, dark, reddish-brown Asiatic eyes.
They had met before, twice. The last
time was in Hobart, whither O Kye had
gone on some business with Ah Dam, who
had preceded him, but with no annointment
whatever. They had drifted in sight of each
other on opposite sides of the street, just as
now, a few minutes after O Kye had left the
boat. And tliey had returned to Svdney to-
gether on the same boat, and had been very
friendlv and pleasant coming across. AH
Dam’s' Society had fixed him up that time,
and next Christmas he had sent O Kye a
present of a pair of the plumpest and ten-
derest young muscovy ducks to be had. r>ut
all this in parentheses.
It was a critical moment, I say, but All
Dam’s mind was made up. He dived across
the street with the action and manner of an
impulsive English schoolboy on sighting an
old chum (it sounds impossible foi a China
man. but I have seen it done). He came up
on the opposite kerb with a glad hand for
O’Kye. (Ah Dam tells me all this himself.)
“How do, Mr. O’Kye!” he cried. You
remember me? Hobart! Five years ago.!
“ Why, it’s Ah Dam !” said O Kye, in
rVipn«?pd surprise: and he shook hands heart-
St. “How do you do, Ah Dam? Where
have you been all this time? Still in the
earden-seed business?” „
K “Yes. worse luck,” said Ah, Dam. Same
slion Why you never come?”
“Oh, I’ll drop in some day,” said O Kye.
“How’s the wife and kids? Quite well.

DOCTOR PRESCRIBES ZAM-BUK'
Child’s Terrible Scald —Flesh Was Half-CooKed and
Red-Raw-9 Months* Frightful Suffering' from Open
Sores, "Which Would Not Heal.
BABY GREEN,
cured, by Zam-Buk
A MOTHER’S INTERESTING STORY.
HE hospital doctor recommended
Zam-Buk to Mrs. Q. Green, of
57 Thomas Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, for a terrible scald sus-
tained by her little boy, and such
professional recommendation proves
the marvellous superiority of Zam-
Buk over all ointments and salves.
Mrs. Green says :
“My little boy, Jc’.in, was nearly scalded to
death through a kettle of boiling water up-
setting over him. The shock almost stopped
his heart beating. The whole of his left side
was in a terrible state, and we thought he
would succumb to his injuries. It was an
anxious time for me, I can assure you. He
was in terrible agony; his flesh was half-
cooked, the skin peeled off, and he was red
raw. Many home treatments were tried, and
although we did all we could to get rid of the
great sores which formed all down his body
as a result of the scald, they would not heal,
and the poor little fellow suffered for nine
long months.
“I took him to the hospital, and after at-
tending to the wounds, the Doctor recom-
mended me to use Zam-Buk for home treat-
ment. Acting under his instructions, I pur-
chased a pot of this splendid Balm, and
applied it to the sores night and morning,
until, presently, signs of improvement were
noticed. The Zam-Buk cooled the irritation
and allayed the pain, reduced the inflammation, cleansed and purified the under and
surface tissues, and commenced to heal the flesh nicely. All symptoms of dangerous
complications, which had previously threatened, were entirely expelled by Zam-Bjk,
and after a patient course of treatment with the halm, John’s wounds were com-
pletely and perfectly healed with sound, new, healthy skin. Although the injuries
were so dangerous and extensive, not a scar remains, for Zam-Buk made his flesh soft
and clear, and without blemish.
“This being my experience with Zam-Buk, it gives me great pleasure in mention-
ing the few' foregoing facts in support of its marvellous virtues, and I trust they will
be the means of doing good to others, who may chance to read this, and who may not
be aware of the benefits to be derived from this famous Balm, which we enthusiasti-
cally recommend to all.”
Every Home Needs Zam-Buk
Zam-Buk is unequalled for cuts, bruises, burns, scalds, rash, sunburn, sore feet,
pimples, blackheads, boils, eczema, piles, sprains, stiffness, bad legs, scabs, scalp
diseases, poisoned wounds, rigworm, baby’s teething, sores and rashes, barber’s rash,
and other disorders of the skin and tissues. Zam-Buk is obtainable from all chemists
and stores, at 1/6 per poii, or 3/6 large family size (containing nearly four times the
1/6 pot) ; or direct from The Zam-Buk Co., 39 Pitt Street, Sydney.

ll°\y s business? You look quite like a man
of leisure, Ah Dam. Taking a mornin’
stroll before breakfast?”
No damn fear!” said Ah Dam. “I was
trying to catch a damn vegetable Chinaman
from North Sydney. He owes me money.
Ao use trying to catch him at home. He
comes over ’bout this time with his cart on
Friday mornings, but I suppose he’s gone bv
the other, horse ferry and dodged me again.
'Veil, so long, Mr. O’Kye. I must go back
and open shop.”
But O’Kye was not the man to let an old
friend go like that, after not seeing him for
years. He passed his arm through Ah
Dam s in an affectionate, brotherly sort
of way, and strolled back with him
down George-street, and paused opposite
a small place built in the Graeco-
Roman - Moorish - Italian - Arabesque-
Elizebetlian - Egyptian - Chinese - Eskimo-
Amencan style of architecture, so much
affected in Australia. He patted Ah
Dam on the back and gently steered him in.
as if he were going to treat his old friend
to a good drink in a private bar, in defiance
of Australian public or anti-Chinese opinion.
It was No. 4 Police Station.
Ah Dam sighed a Chinese sigh, and
handed over nine tins of opium from his in-
side coat pocket, and four from his pants—
Fy in all and asked O’Kye to get him some
Chinese tobacco. O’Kye nodded in a broth-
erly way, and went to get it, and Ah Dam
retired to a cell.
I don’t see any particular end or moral
to this story, except, as Ah Dam put it to
me himself: “You should always keep sober
and your brains clear when you have any
particular business on hand, and for some
time before it.”

/£.VT he a darling?” cooed the stout
lady to the gentleman caller.
“Er —yes!” quavered the visitor,
a tall, blank-faced young man in
motoring rig. “I hope he doesn’t bite.”
‘‘Oh, of course not!” The owner of the
monkey held out one plump finger to the
brute. “Come on. Caesar, dear! Shake
hands with Auntie!”
But Caesar simply sprang up the pole and
gibbered like the worst sort of maniac.
“Come on. old chap,” drawled the caller,
who feared he had lost ground in the lady’s
eyes by his injudicious question, and hoped
to regain it by a show of forced cordiality.
“Shake hands with me, old boy!” He thrust
forward his hand and held it within a few
inches of the obscene brute’s distorted coun-
tenance. “Come on, old fellow! Shake
hands with— DAMN THE BRUTE!" He
tore his bleeding finger from the monkey’s
jaws, and the biter flew up to the top of the
pole and looked down with cruel twinkling
little eyes, while the visitor wrapped his
handkerchief round the wound.
“Naughty Caesar !” scolded the stout lady
in a wretchedly half-hearted manner.
“B-r-r-r! Naughty, biting Caesar!” Then
she turned to her visitor. “I’m most awfully
sorry! It was just a nip, though, wasn’t
it?”
“He got all his beastly teeth into me !”
She looked at him half-reproachfully.
“Oh, I’m sure he didn’t mean to do it, Mr.
Coopside!”
The visitor was not the sort of hero who
lightly describes a bad hurt as “a mere
scratch.” lie most ungallantly refused
either to dissemble his agony or to forgive
the monkey. “I hope my hand isn’t poi-
soned,” he grumbled.
Oh, now, Mr. Coopside ! I’m sure dear
Caesar’s bite isn't poisonous! Why, he’s
bitten at least three people in the last six
months, and not one of them has even been
ill!”
The unhappy Coopside did not pretend to
be comforted. On the contrary, he shot a
murderous glance at the watchful brute, and
said : “He’s a dangerous pet, Mrs. Dredglin.
I’d get rid of him if I were you.”
“I wouldn’t part with him for worlds!”
announced the lady defiantly. “Not for
ivorlds /”
“Well, if you'll excuse me, I’ll go and get
my hand dressed.” He raised his cap and
turned away.
“Good-bye, then. And I do hope your
poor hand is better by to-morrow!”
He had got the engine running, and was
about to step in, when a little hairy devil
dragging a length of broken chain scrambled
over the gate and hopped towards him with
murder in its eyes. He threw his heavy cap
straight at the horror, which squeaked
angrily and leapt sideways under the car.
As it disappeared from view, there was a
sharp bark of pain. The engine shuddered
once, and went on shaking the car. No
monkey emerged, and. to satisfy himself, he
bent down and peered underneath.
The running engine had avenged him with
horrible neatness and despatch. The shaft
had gripped the fur of the little terror, and,
in a couple of revolutions, had killed and
skinned it as clean as a rabbit! The bare
remains were lying in the dust of the road,
with the skin thrown carelessly across them.
Dazed with the suddenness of the trag-
edy, he raked out the two awful exhibits and
wondered dismally what could be done
about it. First of all, he thought he might
bear the relics reverently to the owner and
explain all in a few well-chosen sentences.
He decided, however, that in view of the
circumstances surrounding his departure,
she might suspect him of wilful murder. So
he thought again.
He was still pondering, when a rabbit-o
hung with dead furred things swung round
the corner and came bawling up the street.
As he got abreast of the motor, Coopside
hailed him nervously: “I say! Do you
know anything about monkeys?”
The rabbit-o stopped dead and shot a sus-
picious glance at the asker of silly conun-
drums. “Naw! Do you know anythin’
erbout pigs’ feet?”
Overlooking the retort, Coopside beckoned
mm. The rabbit-o slouched over to the
kerb., “Wot’s up, mate?”
Jp l ih an awful mess,” began Coopside
rapidly. “A monkey belonging to that house
there got under my car just now, and the
engine killed it—took the skin clean off.
Look !”
The rabbit-o looked and breathed hard.
‘Gorstrooth ! you 'ave made a mess of it!”
Coopside wrinkled his nose wretchedly at
the awful exhibits. . “Ye-es, I wonder if you
could help me in any way? Of course - , I
don t expect you to do it for nothing, you
know.”
The rabbit-o looked interested, but puzzled.
"Mrs. Dredglin’s monkey, wasn’t it?” he said.
"Yes.”
"It ain't much good to ’er now,” he an-
nounced.
“I tell you what. If you take it away, I’ll
give you five bob.”
“Right y’are!”
And as he spoke, he gathered up the de-
ceased and.... the door flew open and the
lady-owner of the monkey stepped out.
“Oh, there you are, Rabbit Man! I was
just hoping you’d call this morning.”
“Yes, lady,” mumbled the bearer of
tragedy.
"Have you got any nice rabbits to-day—
or a hare? I'd simply love a nice hare!”
"Got some nice rabbits, ladv!” He slung
one shoulder-load on the edge of the lawn,
and was arranging them for- inspection when
her gaze fell on the stark bodv he was en-
deavoring to conceal behind him. “Why.
you’ve got a hare !” she cried joyfully.
‘No, I ain’t, lady. Ain’t got an ’are with
—none ter be got jus’ now.”
“Oh, yes you have! Isn’t that skinned
one a hare?”
The wretched man fell into a panic, and
made an insane attempt to conceal the thing
behindhis back. “That ain’t fer you, lady!
1 P.PpP'I let - vou ’ ave it —reely I carn’t!”
What do you mean? Has somebody else
ordered it?”
“No, lady. Nobody ain’t ordered it —not
so tar as I know, that is!”
"Then you must let me have it!” The
ruffled customer produced her purse with an
awful air of finality, and inquired coldlv.
How much?”
The rabbit-o wiped a grimy sleeve across
Ins dry bps. “It ain’t fer the likes o’ von.
lady ! Lemme go an' git you another ! This
un’s too thin, an’ !”
“Please, give me that hare at once and
stop arguing! I can see quite well that it
isn t thin at all! If you try to tell me any
niore stories I shan't deal with you any more
How much is it?”
“Er — one an ’ six!” blurted the badlv-
shaken merchant. He suffered the awful re-
mains to be torn from him. heard the door
slam, and, realising that something too dread-
tul tor publication had happened, staggered
down the path, encumbered with a night-
marish eighteenpence and a monkey’s skin
Loopside. fiddling with the engine outside
tlie gate, noticed with some surprise that his
late ambassador set off up the street at a
great pace without further proclaiming his
rabbits. “Making for the nearest pub,” he
reflected wisely, and once more set about
starting.
He had got the engine going and w r as abouf
to step in. when the door of the Dredglin
house Hung open and a distracted lady rushed
down the path crying passionately: “Where
is that rabbit man? \v here has'he qone ?”
Coopside tore off his cap. “Just gone.
Hredghn. Is there anything I can do’”
Ihe lady sobbed and panted: “I want
him arrested at once! I want him arrested
and put into prison! Oh, the Brute' Do
you know what he did? He killed and
skinned poor Cwsar and sold me the bodv
for eighteenpence!”
Coopside fell back against the car. “Didn’t
he explain anything?” he cried amazedly.
‘Explain!” Mrs. Dredglin quiverec
with rage as she repeated the word. “Good
gracious. lou surely do not mean to sug-
gest that I a sensible woman—would stand
calmly by while a murderous Brute, who
° u ? bt , }°u- be in • P ris on” Coopside
switched his attention off her and let her
fume away, while he wondered how he was
to get out of it. It would be madness to trv
to tell her the dreadful truth. He would
call again next day or the day after, when
she had calmed down, and quietly set things
right. Meanwhile, absence was the best
policy.
He raised his cap and stepped into his
cai. And at that very moment, the anguished
voice of the returned rabbit-o broke in on
ms dream. By! ’Ere’s yer blarsted fi’

e\er I seen you or th’ blankv monkey' Now

t irough the air and fell jingling in the car.
Mrs Dredglin emitted a scream, and
pointed accusingly at the goggled Coopside.

And presently when she felt better, she
fired it straight at the rabbit-o. “Why’”
she wailed bitterly— “why did you sell it to
