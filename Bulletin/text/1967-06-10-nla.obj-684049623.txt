Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the '63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this reasonable price and in
the light of possible future
shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying '64
this year, you save some 20 to
30 cents a bottle.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been '54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, '6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The last touch
to the business
of the soft sell
A BROCHURE arrived on the Bat-
manic desk last week. It was of a deep,
tasteful green and on the cover was a
nice color picture of a rose garden. It
was titled “Melbourne Crematorium - —•
Fawkner.” And just to give you an idea
of the lovely style of crematorium writ-
ing we are getting these days .could one
quote some extracts. The introduction
goes thus: “The Crematorium, set in
the lovely parklands of the new Mel-
bourne General Cemetery, embodies all
the best of modern thought to make the
passing of our loved ones as beautiful
as possible. Here, in the colorful
gardens and shady paths one may
meditate amongst the beauties of nature
which breathe an atmosphere of life
—not death. Death is not an end, but
the entry to a new life. The trail
of love is endless and lies in the human
heart. Why, here is its very start."
So much for the introduction. Inside
there were some telling arguments:
“Rain makes a burial even more
ghastly than usual, but it does not affect
a cremation. Who would compare the
quiet disappearance of the casket at
the end of the cremation service, and
the comfort of the knowledge that all
that has to be has taken place, with
the anguish of the last terrible moments
of earth burial and the thoughts that
follow? . . . No matter how thickly
settled Melbourne may, in the process
of time, become, .the Melbourne Cre-
matorium at Fawkner w ill forever, while
human life exists, remain a region of
peace, tranquillity, and beauty.”
On page 10 there is the scale of
charges. Cremation $3O. A single
niche $18.90. A shrub $7O. A rose
bush $lOO. A tree $l2O. A book of
remembrance (hand-made volume in
calf vellum, tooled in gold), standard
entry, nine words, $6.30. Five-line
entry, 24 words, $12.60.
It just so happens that your corres-
pondent is something of an authority
and he only washes that some of the
members of the old Melbourne Crema-
tion Society could see this brochure.
We first thought of cremation in the
1870 s and Melbourne “Punch” cam-
paigned untiringly for it. On May 18,
1876, “Punch” wrote: “When we pay
£2o, or £lOO for the erection of
ostentatious monuments to mark the
whereabouts of a loathsome mass of
corruption, do we never reflect how
much more beneficially this money
might be applied in beautifying the
homes of the poor? But who has the
courage to discard the undertaker, the
clergyman, the tombstone chiseller?”
Then there was the fearful thought:
What in the case of murder by poison?
Cremation would destroy all evidence.
So we didn't get a cremation until
April, 1895. The newspapers ignored
it. The only record is in an under-
takers' trade journal called “The
Light,” which lasted only a few issues.
Much to the horror of the Brighton
Council, the cremation took place on
the beach at Sandringham. When Mrs.
Henniker died at 8 William St., Rich-
mond, at the age of 83, her will made
it very clear that she wanted to be
cremated. According to “Light,” Mr.
J. R. Le Pine, of Richmond, agreed to
do it, “at moderate cost.”
He picked a remote part of the
beach. Judging by the woodcut of the
scene your correspondent would say it
was at the end of Bay Rd., Sandring-
ham. “Light” said: “A van containing
three tons of firewood and a keg of
kerosine had been sent on in advance
and everything was ready when the
procession arrived at the chosen spot,
where a knot of curious spectators
gathered quickly at the unwonted spec-
tacle of a hearse drawn up in a sandy
track in the middle of the scrub.
“No clergyman was present but the
mourners carrying wreaths of white
flowers stood round the pyre, and the
only sort of the deceased, bending down
on his knee's beside the heap of wood, set
fire to it with his own hand. At once
the flame crackled in the brushwood
and fanned by the fresh, southerly
breeze that blew in straight from the
Bay, soon leaped among the logs. The
heat was intense and, as a strong wind
was blowing off the Bay the onlookers
had to retreat some distance off: but
they watched the progress of the flames
with unflagging interest. As the fire
“I came economy class-
I was cremated!”
gained strength and crept around the
coffin, a little hand of mourners,
among whom were half a dozen elderly
ladies and young girls, sang very softly
a few verses of Moodv and Sanky's
hymn “Shall We Gather At The
River.” The hymn “There’s A Land
That Is Brighter Than Day” was sung,
then mourners climbed the cliffs again,
and an empty hearse rattling away at
a brisk trot told all was over. The
undertaker left the scene at 9.30 p.m.”
The board of public health com-
plained. The Council complained, say-
ing that cremations would frighten re-
spectable people away from the beach,
and Parliament eventually put through
a bill legalising cremation. However, we
didn’t get the next one until April 13,
1905. Edward Davies', a devoted mem-
ber of the Cremation Society, died at
85, left £BO,OOO, gave orders for cre-
mation, and left instructions that his
ashes be scattered “to the four winds.”
The death was on Monday and the
funeral was on the Thursday so there
was a terrible rush at the Springvale
necropolis to build a temporary cre-
matorium. They dug a hole in the cen-
tre of the lawn lift. 6in. by 7ft. 6in.
and 2ft. 6in. deep and lined it with
brick. They used six tons of firewood
and in the centre placed a wooden
chute to take the coffin. They put a
sheet of iron on top of the chute and
a sheet of iron underneath and made
sure there was firewood all round. The
theory was that as everything burned
away the iron sheets would trap the
ashes.
There was a special train from the city
for the mourners. The clergyman in-
stead of saying “I commit this body to
the earth,” said “I commit this body
to the flames.” Four kegs of kerosine
had been put on the wood and as the
clergyman said these words, an atten-
dant lit the pyre with a torch. The
“Argus” said: “The whole ceremony
was most impressive and free from any-
thing repellent.”
Alas, this did not create great enthu-
siasm for cremations in Melbourne. The
Society died and did not re-form until
1924. We did not get a modern crema-
torium at Fawkner until 1927, at a cost
of £5OOO. Cremations moved very
slowly but the Cremation Society had
a great coup in the cremation of the
Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr. Harring-
ton Lees, and, by September, 1929,
cremations at Fawkner totalled 150. To-
day we haye four fine establishments.
The brochure points out with sen-
sible realism that 17,320 deaths take
place annually in the Melbourne metro-
politan area and it finishes with the
lines from Longfellow:
When the hours of day are numbered,
And the voices of the night
Wake the better soul, that slumbered,
To a holycalm delight.
With a slow and noiseless footstep
Comes that messenger divine,
Takes a vacant chair beside me,
Lays her gentle hand in mine.
No doubt the old Melbourne Crema-
tion Society would have approved.

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia's
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes;

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Here is a recipe
for a very
Moorish dish
THERE IS A rumor going round that
paella is the staple food of Spain. A
false rumor to be sure, as anyone who
has ever visited Spain knows only too
well.
Spanish cuisine, in point of fact, is
varied and interesting, and each
Province expresses its individual palate.
History and geography, climate and
economics all play a very definite part
in the eating habits of a people.
No other country has such a far-
reaching history of invasions and con-
quests. Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians,
Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Goths,
Vandals all came, conquered, and left
their impressions on the land and its
people. But the culture that made the
deepest impression of all on the Spanish
scene was that of the Moors.
Moorish influence is particularly
obvious in Andalusian cookery, where
spices of the Orient are used exten-
sively. Cinnamon, cummin, saffron, and
cloves. Fruit often appears in meat and
rice dishes as in the food of Persia.
And the Moors brought rice to Spain:
the Spanish way of cooking rice shows
its distinct oriental heritage.
Spaniards actually eat more potatoes
than rice, which comes as a surprise to
tourists. In Madrid, for example, the
only rice dish that ever appears on a
menu is paella. But paella is unques-
tionably an Andalusian dish. Only when
you travel to the south will you find
that a menu will have a whole host of
arroz dishes; arroz meaning rice
comes in many guises. You can order it
a la Valenciana, or a la Catalonia, or
con Polio or Mariscos but probably
the most famous of all is the mixed
paella.
When I lived in Spain and first
learnt to housekeep there, I made very
sure when engaging a maid that she
knew how to prepare a paella it was
unimportant to me whether she knew
how to cook anything else, because I
preferred to do the rest myself in any
case.
I used to watch, completely fascin-
ated, while a paella was being pre-
pared. All the ingredients would be
simmering away when the time arrived
to add the rice. Handfuls of rice were
literally thrown into the mixture,

nuickly shaken to prevent sticking
fnever stirred) and then boiling stock or
water was poured on with great
abandon, causing a great cloud of steam
to billow forth. The pan was then
placed on red heat and the rice cooked
nuickly, enabling it to absorb all the
delicious flavors of the ingredients.
This stage of the preparation takes
ten to 15 minutes, depending on the
quality of the rice. The paella is then
put in a warm place for another ten
minutes to “dry out” before serving.
A paella should be prepared in a
proper paella dish: a large, shallow,
iron or copper pan with two handles.
If you don’t own one, a skillet will
do to begin with providing you are
making only small quantities, but the
proper dish is a great improvement.)
The dish is served in the pan in
which it is cooked, and taken to the
table the instant it is ready. Strips of
lightly fried red and green capsicums
are laid on the surface as decoration.
Essentially a paella is a rice casserole
to which almost anything you have
or fancy—can be added; and the
preparation time is no more than 45
minutes. But take it from me, it needs
that time and experience to turn out a
really good paella; the cook has to learn
to feel for the dish.
Here then is the recipe for Paella
Valenciana enough for 6 good help-
ings:
Cut a 2|lb. chicken into pieces. Use
the back and other meatless pieces for
making a good chicken stock with 5
cups of water, 1 onion, 2 teaspoons salt,
and £ teaspoon saffron. Boil for 30
minutes, strain, and keep hot.
Fry the bite-sized pieces of chicken
dusted with flour and salt until crisp,
and set aside, keeping hot. Fry large
onion, 3 garlic cloves, 1 green, 1 red
capsicum, and 1 tomato, all sliced.
When cooked, add chicken. Fry some
slices of garlic sausage until crisp and
add. Then add a pound of peeled raw
prawns and a pound of mussels in their
shells. Simmer 5 minutes. (If you like,
it, slices of squid can also be added.)
Now add 2 cups of uncooked rice,
shake pan until rice is glazed, then add
your boiling chicken stock.
Cook briskly for 5 minutes. Add 1
small packet of frozen peas and cook
another 5 minutes. Cover the dish and
place over a very low heat (or in the
oven at 300 deg. F.) for another 15
minutes until all liquid is absorbed.
If this recipe is going to be a strain
on your pocket, try arroz Alicantina
(Alicante style). Make a fish stock
from the shells of lib. of raw prawns
boiled with 3 cups water, 1J teaspoons
salt, a pinch oregano, and teaspoon
saffron. Strain and measure for
cu ps stock. Saute a sliced onion in \
CU P olive oil. Add raw prawns until
they just turn pink. Remove. Add
sliced red and green capsicum. When
oooked add 1 cup long-grain rice until
glazed. Add boiling stock and cook
briskly for 10 minutes. Add prawns,
cover tightly and keep on the lowest
beat for 10 to 20 minutes, until all
liquid is absorbed.

OUT AND

A wild and woolly
night at
the Opera House
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE AUSTRALIAN Wool Board
nearly passed out at the “Dailv
Mirror” story which said they were
paying $250 rent for-the Sydney Opera
House. Yes, they were putting their
Scandinavian Fashions and Furnishings
Show on there, but as for flooding the
orchestra pit, floating' a Viking long-
boat on it, and later burning the thing,

“It’s the biggest non-news story of
the year,” said Hamish Graham, their
PRO. “We're certainly not paying
$250.” How much, then? Well, off the
record, NOTHING. On the record, it
could be said they were there at the
Government’s invitation.

As it turned out, rain nearly flooded
.i i . • j } ,
the orchestra pit, anyway. It was that
terribly cold, wet day when winter
really hit Sydney. The Drama Theatre,
filled with $20,000 worth of exhibits
and 250 drs tngurshed designers, decor-
ators, architects, and diplomats, had
one or two open gaps against which no
amount of draped material could trap
the draughts.

down with the Glogg, a Danish brew of
mulled wine laced with raisins, though

ON THE
MARGIN
The powerful
attraction of the
English classics
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
THERE IS A curious indifference in
this country to matters that concern
the national interest. It has taken “The
Times” of London to draw our atten-
tion to the accelerating exodus of
talented Australian jockeys to Britain,
We are used to the departures of scien-
tists, artists, and authors. When Joan
Sutherland, Sidney Nolan, Morris West
became expatriates we sighed but
quietly put up with it. The defection of
jockeys, however, has graver implica-
tions.
The triumphs of G. Moore and D,
Lake on English courses, following those
of earlier emigrants like S. Breasley, R.
Johnstone, and E. Britt, are certain to
lure more riders abroad. The questions
arise: What are the reasons for this
rein drain? Can Australia accept it
with equanimity?
In seeking the answers I had frank
talks with leading turf identities.
Jockeys were emphatic that conditions
in Australia were not attractive enough
to make them want to stay. As L.
Titch put it: “The Australian public
is unsympathetic to jockeys. We have
a depressing feeling that our work is
not fully appreciated. I had a typical
experience last week in the Ultimo
Stakes when I was on Danny Boy. As
you may know, this chestnut son of
Buck Mulligan (Imp.) started favorite.
He had won the Budgewoi Guineas in a
photo the week before, W. Squeers up.
“Well, I did my best, but when I
produced the cane a furlong from home
the well-bred Newcastle galloper failed
to respond. He finished in ninth place
and the crowd was extremely insulting.
They shouted ‘Robber!’ ‘Rub him out!’
and ‘What about last Saturday?’ Things
like that are very wounding to a sensi-
tive hoop. If I got an invitation to go
to England and ride for H.M. The
Queen, say, I would accept like a shot,
The racecourse crowds over there are
more cultivated and urbane.”
Rising Sydney horseman B. H ur
stressed another angle. “In my opinion
what drives Australian jockeys abroad
is the unpleasant, suspicious attitude of
racing officials,” he said. “An example
was my recent ride on Chemistry in the
Balmain Handicap. The bay daughter
of Pharmacist ran a beautiful race to

p oo , n ben prospect, Bar Sinister. But
sooner did I get back to scale than
10 swab was called for and I was
searched for batteries. And merely be-
cause Chemistry had finished last in
the Flyi n g at Gosford the week before.
I t was humiliating.”
Another distinguished rider to voice
discontent was E. Quine. He said:
“Let’s face it, the opportunities in
Australia are small-time compared with
England. I don’t mean that jockeys
here are actually in want. I personally
oW n a sheep property, and there was
q U ite a large crowd at my wedding.
g u t we don’t have a satisfying status.
Australian jockey has been knighted,
like Sir Gordon Richards. I believe Sir
Gordon even has a butler. The most
a rider here can hope for, after years
of high stake-winnings, is an 0.8. E.
And his chances of a butler are com-
paratively small.”
Well-known trainer Jack Pott, on
the other hand, was severely critical
of expatriate jockeys. “Most of them
are motivated by a desire for money,”
he said. “This mercenary approach to
racing is repugnant to reputable Aus-
tralian trainers. Anyway, with so many
riders emigrating there won’t be enough
to go round at the spring meetings. I
reckon they ought to be stopped by
law from leaving the country, like
Merino rams.”
Popular radio race commentator
Howard Kent was more temperate. “I
don’t like to see them go, but I can
understand why a brilliant jockey like
j. Gilpin seeks fresh fields,” he said.
“I’ll never forget how Gilpin landed
the major money on Simple Simon in
the Doncaster. The former Queensland
gelding was topweight in the big mile
event and blew in the market to twelves.
Simple Simon was slow out of the
machine and he was still well back at
the five-furlong peg. Rounding the
home turn Bolero had a saloon passage
and it looked like London to a brick
that he would salute the judge. But
coming round from the rear was Simple
Simon with J. Gilpin scrubbing him
along, he passed Blackmarket, Clog
dancer, Bedlam, and Pollyanna, the
crowd was roaring itself hoarse, down
the straight the gallant ex-Queensland
gelding was neck and neck with Bolero,
and yes it was Simple Simon by half
a length from Bolero in a magnificent
finish with Blackmarket two lengths
away third.” Mr. Kent sat back ex-
hausted and mopped his forehead.
The consensus of opinion, I found,
was that our jockeys are inevitably
attracted by the challenges and rewards
of the English classic races. For Aus-
tralia’s sake, action should be taken to
retain them. Punters could help by
giving jockeys more kindly' encourage-
ment and refraining from hostile demon-
strations. Owners and trainers should
tr y to make jockeys feel that they be-
long, and can achieve worthwhile self-
expression here. If the rein drain is
allowed to continue, Australia could
become a second-class racing power.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Our unchanging ways
AUSTRALIANS in the recent referen-
dum may have voted for Aborigines
and against politicians, but it is no
use fooling ourselves: it will be a long
time before we act as we vote. By
an irony, a party of journalists was
inspecting the new bauxite mining
settlement at Weipa in the Gulf coun-
try the weekend of the poll.
The 30 Aborigines who work on the
project were in the new township to
vote. Otherwise they are rarely seen
there. They get the same salary but
that’s all. They live in the reserve,
which has a population of about 300
people, in unfurnished aluminium three-
bedroom houses that cost $3 a week.
They do not have access to the sub-
sidised supermarket and they don’t
swim in the pool, drink in the bar,
go to the dances, or watch the films
in the town. They are, of course,
allowed to drink.
Appeal
PLAINTIVE little appeal in a slogan
which has been adopted for Kent
cigarettes overseas: Trends need
leaders.
Export action
ANOTHER “mainland” plot has been
discovered in Tasmania. It is alleged
that Mainlanders have been selling vast
quantities of tap water to Tasmanians
inside frozen chickens. By a Tasmanian
Commercial Poultry Producers’ Associa-
tion estimate, Tasmanians have been
robbed of around $lOO,OOO in 6oz.
chunks of frozen water included in
mainland frozen chickens, to say nothing
of the vast quantities of feet and giblets
involved.
Our slide rule suggests that $lOO,OOO
worth of frozen water at 6oz. per
chicken represents about 2,000,000
chickens; this in turn suggests that
something is wrong with Tasmanian
chickens, their sales promotion, or their
prices.
How fo be a writer
EVERYTHING about George Mikes—
humorist and travel writer, here to
Wr jte a book on Australia —is mild:
Thet, blue-grey eyes, a soft, warm,
r °sy complexion, neatly subdued grey
SUlt and tie. His voice, calm and
careful, delivers phrases with a kind
of nervous simplicity. It never rises or
falls below an agreeable medium pitch.
Unobtrusiveness is his strength: he
gives the impression of being a human
camera in the Isherwood sense, travel-
ling to various countries recording his
impressions without fervor, in a
measured, precise style that still reads
like a foreigner’s careful English. He
is not so much a wit as a man of
eminent common sense who sets down
coolly the things that other people
have missed.
His humor is of the essence of mild-
ness, very whimsical and “English.”
And his tastes in humor are quiet, too:
James Thurber, Osbert Lancaster,
Waugh, vintage Wodehouse. He has
never appealed strongly in America
where, he says, “humor is a matter of
exaggeration. Overstatement. Whereas
in Britain it is the opposite.” He
divides his sentences up into pauses
exactly this way.
Mikes began as a journalist, work-
ing for a newspaper in Budapest. He
came to London during the Munich
crisis as a correspondent and, when
Hungary came into the war in 1941,
joined the BBC European Service,
Hungarian section. In 1946, he wrote
“How to be an Alien,” a tiny, funny
book about British foibles and pre-
judices against foreigners, with illustra-
tions by Nicolas Bentley. It sold
300,000 copies because of its bon mots
(“Continentals have a sex life. The
English have hot-water bottles.”)
Since then, Mr. Mikes has sold
100,000 copies of a mildly satirical work
on America, “How to Scrape Skies,”
and has done well with books on
Hungary, Italy, and Jamaica, among
others.
He reads little on a country, prefer-
ring to plunge into it —via the biggest
city—with an open mind. “Here is
notebook number 12,” Mr. Mikes said
crisply, pulling a small shorthand book
from his pocket. “I go through it,
underlining the main subjects of refer-
ence carefully in red.”
Were there any Hungarian literary
origins for Mr. Mikes’ specific brand
of humor? “Not really. Except per-
haps that I may have been influenced
by a man called Karinthi. He was
really a genius. If he had been Anglo-
Saxon he would have been as famous
as Stephen Leacock. His one book fam-
ous in English was ‘A Journey Round
My Skull.’ But he was really untrans-
latable. And he parodied poets and
writers who were quite unknown outside
Hungary. But really I’m more English
than Hungarian. Most Hungarians are
excitable. I’m not. I’m reserved. Self-
disciplined.”
Mikes’ attitude to contemporary
British humor was detached and cool.
“I have stopped reading' Michael
Frayn, for instance.” Wasn’t it true
that humorists satirists, even who
once were at odds with fashion, now
followed it, and were thereby emascu-
lated? “Yes, I would concur with that.
But you must remember that the status
of writers has changed. Fifty years ago
a writer, like an actor, was leading a
somewhat Bohemian existence. Today,
a writer in England leads a somewhat
bourgeois one. He has middle-class
attitudes. Even as a humorist he sees
himself as the backbone of society
rather than its enemy.
“ ‘Punch?’ That’s only good when it
isn’t funny. Its parliamentary reviews.
Its book reviews.”
Mikes had contributed to the tele-
vision program “That Was The Week
That Was” and felt that this did repre-
sent a breakthrough. What was he
going to do after the book on Australia,
which had taken him to all States and
New Guinea in six weeks, and about
which he didn’t want to talk too much
ahead of writing? “A novel about a
little Jewish family from the Eastern
Marches of White Russia. One of
their members ends up in the House
of Lords.” And with a quiet wave of
farewell, the grey-suited figure of
George Mikes moved out of the Went-
worth lobby into Bligh Street, the
fingers firmly grasping Notebook Num-
ber Twelve.
More variety
YOU MIGHT CALL Ron Parry the
Don Lane or Graham Kennedy of
Adelaide, although he mightn’t care
much for it if you did. Parry has been
getting good ratings for his show
“Here’s Parry” on Channel 7. Once a
week to begin with, it is now on Mon-
days and Thursdays.
Parry is ex-Yorkshire, ex-Bomber
Command, even ex-bullfighter. Fresh
out of the RAF, he went to Spain in a
clown-and-mime act and stayed to fight
bulls for two years in the south, begin-
ning at La Linea. El Ingles finally had
about 50 bulls to his credit. He also
had a Spanish wife.
He is the son of one of the original
Twelve Lancashire Lads, of whom
another was Charlie Chaplin. After
extensive experience in British variety
and films he came to Australia in 1954
for the Tivoli, then returned in 1963
for the Channel 9 network.
Now he has written a book, “Inci-
dent at Littlehampton on Sea,” which
he describes as part-thriller, part a poke
in the eye at the Blackpools of this
world, and he thinks that in his time
he has seen most of them.

THE CENTENARY of the birth of
Henry Lawson will be celebrated at
Grenfell, N.S.W., this month. The road
linking Young through Grenfell to
Forbes in the central west is now named
the Henry Lawson Way. It is the
shortest inland route between Melbourne
and Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
Grenfell is promoting tourism along the
route with the slogan: “Save a day

AS I SEE IT
Holt trying to get
LBJ to go all
the way with us
FROM ALAN REID
IN WASHINGTON
TWO WORRIED MEN met last week
in the White House, both of them
burdened with political responsibility
for their fellow countrymen fighting in
Vietnam and equally worried about
the possible effect on their countries
of a British withdrawal from South-
East Asia. But equally, too, President
Johnson and Australia’s Prime Minister,
Harold Holt„ are superb political tac-
ticians, and, as Johnson rolled out the
White House red carpet, and a guard
of honor, in an exchange of public
greetings with his buddy, Harold (“All
the way with LBJ”) Holt, it appeared
neither of them had a worry in the
world.
President Johnson’s greeting was
warm, and genuinely so, for Holt is the
only leader of a Western country who
has gone all the way with LBJ, even to
the extent of publicly supporting, in his
first speech in the United States, the
American bombing policy in North
Vietnam, a policy under not inconsider-
able fire from critics in the U.S.
But there was real worry behind the
smooth facade and cheerful back-slap-
pings. Both leaders knew that, once
again, they were moving to a point of
crisis on Vietnam.
Joint interests
Johnson, of course, has other major
worries on his mind, including the
Middle East crisis in which the United
States, as a major world power, must
play a large role, while Australia can
afford to be virtually disinterested. But
Lyndon Johnson is sufficiently identified
in American minds with Vietnam for
developments there to loom very large
in his eyes, and it is fairly well accepted
that Vietnam, rather than the Middle
East crisis, despite its seriousness, will
influence his Presidential future.
Both Johnson and Holt undoubtedly
want Britain to maintain a military-
presence in South-East Asia. For
Johnson it is terribly important. In the
postwar era, the United States has
taken responsibility for the Chinese-
Japanese-Philippines area, and Britain
for the Malayan-Singapore region.
If Britain gets out —and both men
recognise it as a very real possibility
—there is going to be a power vacuum
which cannot be left unfilled. If the
United States itself does not move in,
the vacuum will, as far as the Western
world is concerned, have to be filled
by some Force or combination of Forces
acting at least with United States back-
ing.
For Holt a British presence in the
area is even more important. Australia’s
defence commitments in the area have
been built around the certainty that, in
any eventuality of a dangerous nature,
Australia, too small to act by itself,
would perform in co-operation and
association with a major power.
But if Britain went —and Australian
advice is that it would like to get out
by 1972 —Australia, with defence com-
mitments in Malaya and Singapore,
would be in a perilous position. It could
no longer be certain of the comfort of
association with a major power. It
might be on its own, like a shag on a
rock.
Convincing Britain
Holt, a self-described optimist, told
Johnson that the British Prime Minister,
Harold Wilson, had undertaken to re-
frain from any major decision on
Britain’s South-East Asian presence un-
til Holt had put Australia’s viewpoint.
Holt believes there is still a prospect
of convincing Wilson of the desirability
of maintaining the British presence in
South-East Asia in interests of world
peace.
Johnson told Holt that anything he
could do in that direction would be
valuable. But while both men were un-
doubtedly thinking of the long term
and of such broad issues as the further-
ance of world peace, they also had in
mind short-term objectives like the
welfare of the men fighting in Vietnam.
As both men see it, a British with-
drawal now, when the Vietnam war is
at a crucial stage and broadly based
government is not yet established in
South Vietnam, could be extremely
harmful. It would result in a change
in the power balance in an area that
would undoubtedly encourage the North
Vietnamese to persist in resistance to
peace negotiations. Possibly even more
important, it would erode the con-
fidence of countries currently develop-
ing both industrial and political strength
behind the shield of United States’
strength.
“If Britain pulls out of Asia today,
will it be America pulling out to-
morrow?” must be the uneasy thought
in the minds of Asian leaders in both
committed and neutral countries.
As Johnson undoubtedly pointed out
both the United States and Australia
are in a position to put indirect econo-
mic squeeze on Britain to influence her
toward what the U.S. and Australia
see as a more correct attitude. The
U.S. is Britain’s largest customer. Aus-
tralia is its second largest. As consis-
tent supporters of Britain and the
British economy in the past, they are
entitled to some kind of consideration
for their viewpoint that Britain should
defer making a withdrawal decision
at least until the position in Vietnam
is more stabilised.
Double-edged weapon
How far either Johnson and Holt are
prepared to use this kind of pressure
to keep Britain in South-East Asia is
conjectural. Both are practical poli-
ticians. If they thought that they could
produce, without adverse repercus-
sions, the kind of result they want,
they would undoubtedly use it.
But they are aware that this kind of
weapon is double-edged and that if
they use it crudely they could do more
damage to themselves than to others.
I get the impression Johnson is less
optimistic than Holt about their joint
capacity, not so much to convince
Wilson as to create the conditions in
which Wilson can convince his own
Labor followers and other sections of
British opinion in favor of withdrawal
to stay their hands for a while more.
While Holt is optimistic by nature,
he is still shrewd enough to look for
an escape hatch through which he can
clamber if the ship of his hopes goes
down.
What worries him is that the United
States, while appreciative of Australian
aid in Vietnam, still does not fully
realise the significance to the U.S. of
Australia’s defence development. The
theme he struck at Los Angeles is that
America, in its own self-interest and
for protection of its Pacific flank, can-
not afford to have Australia in un-
friendly hands.
In effect, what he is saying is: “If
Britain pulls out we are going to need
favored treatment for our defence spend-
ing, and access to capital resources. It
is in your interests to see that we get
it, so that we can hasten our develop-
ment which, in turn, will strengthen
your Pacific flank.”
Holt will not come up with an im-
mediate result on this one. This is
the type of thing that takes time before
it is translated into action. But it is
a measure of his uneasiness about the
long-term effects of British withdrawal
from South-East Asia (and of Britains
possible entry into the Common Mar-
ket) that his first American speech was
a warning about the importance to the
United States of Australia’s defence
capability.


AUSTRALIA
Electoral reform as Doug
Anthony sees it: more MHRs
WE’VE VERY RECENTLY had elec-
tions but Federal parliamentarians
and party officials are already starting
to think about the next ones. The
nexus referendum over and done with,
they are anxiously looking to the terms
on which the 1969 contest will be
fought.
Mr. Holt before he left for his North
American-British trip declared that the
people had voted against more politi-
cians and so there wouldn’t be any
in the life of this Parliament. But
there are plenty of MPs who are not
going to take this as the end of the
matter.
Interior Minister, and Deputy-Leader
of the Country Party, Mr. Doug
Anthony, who is responsible for over-
seeing the administration of the elec-
toral system, is one who thinks the
question will be raised again. Sitting
coatless and tieless at his Canberra
desk, he talked to several journalists
last week. Maps were unrolled, statistics
produced with facility. Like everyone
else he says there just has to be an
electoral redistribution before 1969.
Otherwise the subdivisions of seats will
remain on the present ridiculous and
unconstitutional 1955 basis.
This is one on which the Attorney
General, Mr. Snedden, of the far south-
eastern Melbourne seat of Bruce, repre-
sents more electors than Messrs. Cal-
well, Crean, Peters, and Cairns, of inner
Melbourne seats, combined; and why
electorates vary in size between 29,425
and 124,189.
But having left things so long, the
reform has to be extraordinarily radical
to correct matters. Mr. Anthony thinks
the ordinary parliamentarian simply
has not yet appreciated the magnitude
of the changes and the profound im-
pact it will have on him. Most of the
re-adjustment has to be done in Mel-
bourne and Sydney, but these two met-
ropolitan areas support 50 of the House
of Representatives’ 123 members.
Several Ministers could be affected •
McMahon, Bury, even the Prime Minis-
ter—were the Commissioners to stick by
technicalities.
So radical has been the shift of
Population distribution in Melbourne
and Sydney since 1955 that up to seven
seats will have to be abolished com-
pletely to consolidate declining areas
mto large enough units to provide a
Interior Minister Anthony
sensible constituency. And on the out-
skirts—in the northwest, west and south
of Sydney and all round Melbourne
though particularly in the north and
southeast —about the same number of
new electorates carved out. But in the
process there will have to be a whole-
sale recasting of the electoral map in
middle metropolitan areas and hardly
a Melbourne or Sydney MHR will go
unaffected.
Mr. Anthony foresees a great deal
of parliamentary discontent once this
is more fully appreciated. He sees pres-
sure on Cabinet from all directions to
alleviate the situation. And there is only
one way this can be done by in-
ceasing the size of the House of Repre-
sentatives. An increase of 12 would
do the job quite neatly, eliminating the
need for any seats to be abolished. It
would greatly reduce the scope of re-
arrangements in the established built-up
electorates, feeding new Members into
the bloated outskirts of the cities. It
would require only six more seats in
the Senate.
Mr. Anthony points out that mem-
bers of every party will favor such a
scheme. The Country Party, of course,
is as keen as the city-based parties on a
larger Parliament because it eliminates
the risk of a N.S.W. country seat being
dropped, as provided for in the 1962
re-distribution proposal. By increasing
the discrepancy between rural and city
electorates eight to 12 percent, N.S.W.
country areas can maintain their pres-
ent representation. N.S.W. had to lose
one seat somewhere, and if this were
done it could be lost in the city.
But opponents of this “gerrymander”
say that the new Electoral Act con-
tains no provisions which indicate the
need .for any greater favoritism for
country areas. It simply says that con-
sideration should be given to sparsity
of population and the other character-
istics of rural areas. Such considera-
tion has always been given. And there
has always been a regulation that no
electorate may diverge more than 20
percent from the average.
Whatever the Commissioners may in
fact decide, Mr. Anthony says that a
decision one way or the other will have
to be made this year, because it will
take the best part of 21 months to go
through all the motions of reforming
constituencies and printing new elec-
toral rolls and maps.
South Australia
Scene-shift
DONALD ALLAN DUNSTAN, QC,
who, at 40, is South Australia’s new
Premier, had three rivals for the suc-
cession to the reluctantly retiring Mr.
Frank Walsh (too old at 70 under the
local ALP rule). The day before the
ballot was taken, the four of them were
photographed “relaxing” in the Dun-
stan garden like finalists in a beauty
queen competition. All but the self-
conscious Minister of Lands (Mr. Jim
Corcoran) wore their best smiles.
Deputy-Leader Cyril Hutchens looked
more than ever like the aproned host
in the Holbrook sauce ad; the rather
austere Mr. Gabriel By waters (Agri-
culture) managed a furrowed grin;
Attorney-General Dunstan gave an im-
pression of being among bosom friends;
and only Mr. Corcoran, the youngest
of the four, looked as though he had
no right to be there.
The next morning the rivals had
vanished from the front page in a
sudden scene-shift, and there was the
new Premier sitting in front of a piano
with his good-looking family, all of
them wearing watermelon smiles. Be-
tween scenes he had had one bad
moment. In the first throw of the 23
caucus votes (one for each ALP merm
ber of Parliament) he had trailed Mr.
Corcoran, the late starter, 9 to 10. The
two older men were out of the race
with three votes each. The next ballot
was thus a straight-out contest between
Dunstan and Corcoran. The Attorney-
General won 14 to 11.
Dunstan’s election is the best shot


in the arm Labor has had since it took
over the Government in 1965, after
more than 30 years of dreary waiting.
Besides his much-touted youth and
arrogance, he has a first-class mind
which works quickly and lucidly. He is
by far the best speaker in either House,
and he is also a man of passion. He
likes to see himself as a reformer in
the Chartist tradition, which he thinks
is still strong in South Australia.
To his admirers, Don Dunstan is an
exceptionally able young man with a
social conscience properly appalled by
the things left undone for the Abori-
gines, the old, and, more recently, for
the shareholders of companies whose
directors are able to shelter behind No
Liability signs. He is also the most
aggressive and cleverest enemy of the
dug-in Legislative Council.
He is, perhaps, as much disliked and
feared as he is admired. Many people,
listening to the cultivated (and splen-
did) voice and remembering that he
went to Adelaide’s poshest school, look
on him as a deserter. Dear old ladies
wonder “why he isn’t one of us.” In
fact, he was ardently Liberal at one
early stage.
He joined the ALB when the going
for intellectuals with cultivated voices
was rough. It still can be; but he has
held his seat and for the past two
years dominated the Labor Cabinet by
the variety and aggressiveness of his
ideas and the aura of a young man in
a hurry. It has also helped that he
has a Wilsonian flair as a TV per-
former.
As Premier he is, of course, a risk,
especially in the country electorates,
where he touches most of the dark
suspicions. But he is also Labor’s main
hope of regaining ground, which, often
through no fault of its own, it has lost
in the past two and a half years.
Though he has obviously been working
hard on his image of late, he is at his
best when attacking. The youngest
of the reigning State Premiers, he has
nine months to the next elections to
Premier Dunstan with his family
reinvigorate the party. He may suc-
ceed only too well. That is his main
danger. But of one thing there can be
no doubt. If Labor, under Don Duns-
tan, loses office next March, it will not
go out with a whimper.
Canberra
A talk on tariffs
THE HOTEL CANBERRA is the
capital’s traditional pub and it was
not surprising they had all the flags
out for Mr. McEwen’s address to the
National Press Club. The Australian
flag on the left was crossed with the
Union Jack on the right. But just before
journalists and Embassy guests began
filing in, someone hurriedly got the flags
taken down much to the amusement
of three observers from the British High
Commission along the road.
Someone doubted the propriety of the
two flags on an occasion when the
Deputy Prime Minister was talking on
our trade patterns. He spoke again of
the “beneficial results” rising from the
Kennedy Round of tariff cuts and the
improved access to world markets which
this will produce. In the course of this
he simply had to say that we are buying
this improved access by selling away
British preferences and British access
to our domestic market.
Mr. McEwen reaffirmed that there
will be no reduction in Australian pro-
tection following world-wide tariff cuts
of 30 percent which followed the suc-
cessful Geneva conference. We will
satisfy North America, Europe, and
Japan by giving them some of Britain’s
share of the Australian market.
He referred in a scathing tone to re-
maining protection overseas: “The days
were when one produced something, one
could take it out and sell it at the best
price. Today the world is full of
countries who say, no, we won’t receive
that item at all; we won’t receive this
item without something like a 100 per-
cent tariff; we won’t receive that item
John McEwen ... hackles
except to the extent that we cannot
produce it at any old cost ourselves.”
Our man in Canberra, thinking Mr.
McEwen had perhaps undergone a
dramatic conversion to free trade while
suffering the traumas of the “tormen-
tingly agonising” talks in Geneva, asked
him at question time about this. He
also requested a comment on the call
by Tariff Board chairman, Mr. Ratti-
gan, for a re-examination of our
approach to tariff-making and his sug-
gestion that especially high-cost indus-
tries requiring high tariff protection be
phased out of production, over a period
of time.
The Ministerial hackles were up.
Offended, Mr. McEwen declared he
hadn’t referred to the silliness of other
countries’ protective devices, which he
hadn’t in so many words, though his
meaning was clear to everyone. He
hadn’t read Mr. Rattigan’s speech, but
Mr. Rattigan was a personal friend for
whom he had great respect. If he were
expressing a view he would address it
to him, Mr. McEwen, personally. He
would then study it quite carefully.
“Australia’s tariff-making is as clean
and open as anywhere on earth. If the
Tariff Board or Mr. Rattigan, as its
chairman, felt there was a need for us
to depart from tradition in our tariff
policy-making, I’m sure he would sug-
gest it to me.” People were free to
suggest lower tariffs, just as they were
free to suggest higher tariffs.
But Mr. McEwen is certainly trying
to be more conciliatory on tariff mat-
ters, if not to impertinent journalists.
He announced the abandonment of his
Department’s scheme for a panel of
part-time Tariff Board members drawn
from industry. “There was not much
support for it, and that might be over-
stating it.” Mr. Rattigan had also
written to him “explaining in convinc-
ing terms” that the Board could speed
up its work.
He had also been asked by the Board
for an informal meeting over lunch: 1
instantly agreed to that. This will be
my third meeting with the Tariff Board
in 11 years, so I don’t stand over them
very much.”


Aborigines
Victorian ways
THE NEW FIRM of Holding and
Wilkes has already shown that it is in
serious business in Victorian politics.
Since their election to the leadership
of the ALP Parliamentary Party last
month, Mr. Holding, aged 36, and Mr.
Wilkes, 41, have indicated their in-
tention to increase the pressure on
the Bolte administration’s weak spots.
At present the focus of their attack
is the Government’s Aboriginal policy.
Last week Mr. Holding recalled, to the
Government’s embarrassment, that the
new Minister in charge of Aboriginal
Affairs, Mr. Meagher, had been strongly
opposed to the development of the Lake
Tyers Aboriginal Settlement when he
was previously chairman of the Abori-
ginal Welfare Board: “he by-passed all
attempts to develop the settlement.
Many Aborigine leaders are concerned
at his return as the Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs.”
Mr. Holding claimed there was noth-
ing to show for the $130,000 plan to
improve conditions at the Lake Tyers
settlement, and that confidence in the
State Government’s Aboriginal Welfare
Board was at a low ebb: a rather dif-
ferent view to Federal Minister Sin-
clair’s “she’ll be right” one last week
when he declared the Commonwealth
was satisfied that State Aboriginal Wel-
fare Boards could do all that was needed
for Aborigines.
The first part of Mr. Holding’s charge
is not quite accurate. In the past few
months the Government has erected
four new houses at Lake Tyers and the
first of these will be ready for occupa-
tion in a week or so. Extensive repairs
have been made to other houses in this
Gippsland settlement and the water
supply has recently been considerably
improved. Lake Tyers Aborigines have
been employed on these jobs.
The charge of the Aboriginal Ad-
vancement League is that when at
length the Government and the
Aboriginal Welfare Board do act they
are more concerned with appearances
and structures, “with buildings than
with people. But housing is only one
thing needed.”
The League claims that the former
Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs,
Mr. Thompson, promised two years ago
that the Aborigines should be allowed to
elect some representatives of their own
people to the Welfare Board, but that
nothing has been done and the two
Aborigines on the Board are Govern-
ment nominees. The League insists that
there will be no solution to the pre-
dicament of the Aborigines unless they
me brought into the area where de-
cisions affecting their future are made.
, An example of Victorian paternalism
lies in the Government’s attitude to
the location and occupation of the new
houses at Lake Tyers. The Board has
ignored its advisers and placed the
houses in different positions from those
suggested by the Aborigines. The de-
cisions about the occupants will also be
made by the Board. In practice little
or no account is paid to the judgments
of the candidates for tenancy.
The Board now has no qualified
social workers on its staff: not long
ago there were four. The Board has
staffing problems in each of its dis-
tricts and is forced to reply upon
untrained, inexperienced, and, often,
part-time welfare workers. Because the
superintendent of the Lake Tyers settle-
ment was injured in a road accident
it now lacks adequate supervision, and
in the weekends there is no medical
assistance readily available.
The Aborigines, meanwhile, live
through the fuss with their unique mix-
ture of dejected fatalism and wry
humor. The story circulating in Gipps-
land is that the leader of the Lake
Tyers Aborigines reckons he will wait
a while longer, but if things don’t im-
prove he will be on the train to the
Melbourne Museum to ask for his spear
back.

Fair bairn
The SMA
Cold comfort
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT at
last has spelt it out the Snowy
Mountains colossus is doomed but its
brains are to be preserved.
Preservation —• and salvation for 700
of the Authority’s “brains” has been
decreed. Elements (this word is stres-
sed on the official edict) of the inves-
tigations design, and scientific staffs, are
destined to become a super nation-wide
consultation organisation after 1974,
offering specialist services to all and
sundry.
The head, admittedly a little shaven,
has been saved, but from now the rest
of the body will start to wither. As it
decays and crumbles over the next
seven years, with it will crumble the
jobs of nearly 4000 workers, and real
estate values in Cooma.
The chief administrative officer of
the Authority, Mr. J. Hinton, was not
giving anything away when the official
announcement was made. He flatly re-
fused to give details of staffing in vari-
ous areas. But Mr. Hinton forgot the
Authority’s annual report. Indications
are that half of the salaried staff of 1459
will have to find other work. They will
be joined in their quest by the 1700 the
Authority employs on wages in the field
and the 1500 employed by the major
contractors.
The Government’s official statement,
delivered by the appropriate Minister,
Mr. Fairbairn, waffles on and one can
be forgiven for thinking it might even
be a little apologetic.
“The Authority has special collective
skills,” Mr. Fairbairn says “. . . not
matched elsewhere in Australia.” But
then he adds “the Government has ac-
cordingly decided to continue elements
of the Investigation, Design and Scienti-
fic Services staffs (including the Hy-
draulic Laboratories) together with a
number of the administrative staff.”
All in all a delightfully vague state-
ment which should be cold comfort
for all staff in these departments as the
axe still hangs over every head.
Medical research
The cash society
IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT ironical that
a tribe of primitive natives in the
western highlands of New Guinea may
provide civilised man with the answer
to his greatest killer —coronary heart
disease.
Doctors have convincing evidence that
there are about 20 risk factors contri-
buting to heart disease, the better known
of which are cigarette smoking, over-
weight, lack of exercise, diet, blood
pressure, the level of blood fats, and
stress.
But the difficulty has been in pin-
pointing which are the primary causes
of heart disease and which the secon-
dary. If only one could take a primi-
tive tribe free of heart disease and
follow its evolution into modern society
to trace what factors made them more
prone to heart disease.
Dr. Peter Sinnett, 32, a graduate of
Sydney University, is doing just that.
With the support of the ANU and the
National Heart Foundation, he has
selected the 628 villagers of Tukisenta,
in New Guinea, for his experiment.
The villagers are a primitive people

“What’s Brahms doing
on a dictating
machine?”
Most dictating machines don't reproduce
music too well because they have 1 speed
only, for words.
The National RQISBS has a 1 7 4 i.p.s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3?4 speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse” gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at home. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can sw»itch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

just on the verge of entering what Dr.
Sinnett calls “the cash society.” They
have successfully cultivated crops of
pyrethrum, an insecticide, which will
give them the money to buy the goods
and foods common in a Western society.
After spending seven months with
the villagers recently, Dr. Sinnett has
found that they are remarkably free
of heart disease, compared with the cur-
rent rate in Western society of 24 cases
in 1000 in the 30-62 age group. Dr.
Sinnett has taken a cardiogram of every
adult in the village, measured their
height, weight, physical fitness, and
analysed their social background and
diet.
He will return to Tukisenta every
year to watch the villagers as they
become progressively more affluent and
more susceptible to the risk factors of
heart disease common in a civilised
society. By examining them as they
progressively develop symptoms of coro-
nary heart disease he hopes to narrow
down the 20 risk factors to the pri-
mary causes.
Although the experiment could take
up to ten years to complete, the
National Heart Foundation already re-
gards it as one of the most important
research works it has yet undertaken.
Of course, the villagers in ten or twenty
years’ time might feel otherwise and
ask why they were not warned more
forcibly of the dangers in a cash
society.
Western Australia
Tricky ground
NEXT MONTH, WHEN the Western
Australian Parliament opens, the
Liberal-Country Party coalition will face
the sternest test since it was elected
to office nine years ago. The coalition
has a notable record and the Opposition
is weak. On surface evidence, the
Government should be considered safe
to continue. But there are a number
of points of latent dissatisfaction.
Five issues stand out as potentially
dangerous, two within the Right Wing,
three beyond their ranks. The first is
the position dictated, according to
the Minister for Industrial Develop-
ment, Mr. Charles Court, by Federal
tight-fistedness which has forced the
Government to pinch its two strongest
groups of supporters. These are the
businessmen, annoyed by the peripheral
tax measure of stamp duty, and the
white-collar workers, squeezed between
generally static incomes and rising costs
that have accompanied otherwise
general prosperity.
The three public issues are emotive,
dealing with justice, betting, and land.
Three Tukisenta villagers
The contentious matter of justice
revolves on the protracted case oi
deaf-mute Darryl Beamish, found guilty
of a murder to which multi-murderer
Eric Edgar Cooke later confessed.
Leader of the Opposition Tonkin’s
call for a fresh inquiry was given
impetus last week by an outstanding
television review of the case which has
had strong public impact.
Betting also has been Mr. Tonkin’s
pet, but until recently he has been
seen to be on the wrong side of the
fence. However, a newspaper inquiry
into TAB activities prompted announce-
ment last week of a Royal Commission,
and so far the Opposition attitude has
come out of this well at the Govern-
ment’s expense.
On the problem of land, the onus
will be on Mr. Brand over the next
few weeks to prove that the Govern-
ment is sincerely against speculation
which has sent the cost of residential
land soaring. The ground is remarkably
tricky and the Government is handicap-
ped in being advised by public servants
with an interest in grasping control.
The fifth issue is perhaps the most
explosive. Mr. Brand has come out in
favor of the W.A. Development Cor-
poration being granted rights to carry
out research and development of a big
tract of land on the outer fringes of con-
ventional development. When, last
month, a joint meeting of Government
parties failed to agree on the basis of
negotiation, Mr. Brand said: “I regret
to say the matter has been referred back
to the Cabinet.”
WADC is offering initiative and
money to research the arid areas of
the State in return for some security
of tenure; this has been continually
watered down, as has been the area to
be made available. However, in a pre-
election year, with the Premier com-
mitted to backing the Corporation at
least part of the way, it is politically
necessary for some kind of acceptable
deal to be arranged. Mr. Brand’s big-
gest test this session may well be m
maintaining internal equilibrium while
striking the balance between the re-
quests of the WADC, the demands of
the Country Party—so sensitive to land
deals and the increasingly strident
calls of the back-benchers who rebelled
against him last year.

"L'Empire Trade Preference c'est moi!"
COMMENT
The Middle East: the issues for Australia
THE DESIRE FOR constant re-enact-
ment of some favored drama can be
one of the big promptings of political
interest and political action—and one
of the reasons why politics can some-
times become so ridiculous. Some of
us tend to sketch in some view of what
matters in world politics and stay with
it for the rest of our lives, and as new
situations occur we still react to them in
terms of old situations, so that although
things keep changing we go on seeing
the one simple thing that first appealed
to our imaginations.
It is to Australians’ credit that, over-
all, they have not done this about the
present Middle East crisis. Tradition-
ally, the naval stations and fortresses
of the old imperial sea routes seemed
to be part of the very skeleton of our
existence. We took the same view as
the British that the Middle East was
the key area in the strategy of the
Empire and that what happened there
was of decisive importance to us. It
even became an area to which we sent
Military expeditions. Now a crisis
ln the Middle East is just another
ensis and the areas that seem decisive
to Australia are nearer home, while
the areas that seem decisive to the
world are at no place in particular
but wherever the Russians and the
Americans, or the Americans and the
Chinese, or the Russians and the
Chinese, confront each other.
It is only in this second sense that
the Middle East crisis is important to
us—important to us because it is im-
portant to the world, but not because
it is happening in the Middle East. It
might as well have happend in Cuba
or the Congo. Those Australians whose
sense of historical re-enactment still
focuses on the Middle East so strongly
that some of them are speaking of the
present crisis as “the Suez crisis” are
using a language that is now incompre-
hensible to their younger or more adapt-
able countrymen.
This is not to say that the survival
of Israel is not a matter about which
Australia should be indifferent but that
it is for us a general issue, not a ques-
tion of special self-interest. The general
issue itself is clear enough and it is that
sovereign nations have a right to exist,
irrespective of how they were first
formed or what their neighbors might
think about them. In a way, of course,
this is also a matter of special interest
to us, and indeed to any other small or
middle-sized nation. Given the kind of
rhetoric sometimes used about Austra-
lia’s position in South-East Asia, it
should also be of some inspiration to
us that a nation smaller than our own
and living with present, continuing, and
immediate threats to its existence is
coolly and courageously prepared to
defend itself and also manages to go
about its daily business.
As a world issue, that is to say as an
issue involving Russia and America,
the Middle East crisis contains all of
the terrible dangers that are likely to
continue to recur and that now seem
to constitute the main threat to the
world’s peace. In itself the clash of
interest between the two super powers
is no danger to peace. The leaders
of these two nations are not maniacs
who would destroy civilisation in frontal
conflict. But all over the world smaller
States continue to quarrel with each
other and they tend to bring the Rus-
sians and the Americans into their
quarrels. It is out of this kind of
muddle that now, and in the future,
Russia and America will be brought into
continuing confrontation. The alterna-
tive would be a detente, in which both
super powers withdrew from the rest
of the world and let it fight its own
battles. This would be a real detente,
but it hardly seems likely.




LEONARD FRENCH: Everythinm a large scale
By BRIAN
BUCKLEY
IMAGINE the boy, snub-nosed and
squarely built, perhaps a little shorter
than average for twelve, searching the
back streets of the inner Melbourne
suburb for somewhere to paint. He
hasn’t the space to splash around in at
home and his mates won’t help; the
painting caper makes them wary and
suspicious of his loyalties, puzzled to
find a cissy streak in a tough kid.
Eventually, he pries his way through
the Brunswick potteries and comes
across some old and deserted kilns.
Solid brick, half-dark, and solitary, but
better than the young master had
dreamed of finding. He sprints home
and returns with easel and paints. Len
French was ready to set up his first
studio and the mongrel pigeons of the
kilns would be his first critics.
He emerged brilliant as a cicada and
in love with shape and color. Twenty
years and a bit later he was visited by
one of the nation’s best architects, Roy
Grounds, who put the proposition:
“Well, laddie, how would you like to
do the biggest ceiling in the world?”
French had always liked to paint big,
but this proposition, it emerged, was
for glasswork, colored chunk glass, 165
feet by 48 feet of it.
He remembers the sweat of anticipa-
tion which broke over him as he
realised something of the challenge and
opportunity of the job. Out in the
yard he feverishly paced out the
rectangle 165 feet by 48 of colored
glass to be chipped, chiselled, and
fabricated; inch-thick Belgian glass of
superb beauty through which light could
be reshaped into myriad patterns and
undiscovered hues. He went back inside
and accepted the job. It was a few days
before he was hit with the full shock
of how complex and demanding the
task would be.
The biggest glass ceiling in the world
will cover the State Reception Hall in
the new National Gallery and Cultural
Centre of Victoria now being rapidly
constructed in St. Kilda Road on the
southern side of the Yarra. To do the
job, which he has been working on for
four years, Len French left his factory
studio in the bayside suburb of Beau-
maris and bought an old mill at Heath-
cote, 76 miles north of Melbourne. With
the aid of a couple of assistants, local
men whom French has trained, he chips
the glass into the master design.
The glass is imported in rectangles
12 inches by 8. After being cut and
shaped it is assembled into triangles of
lift. base. By September the full 224
of these glass triangles in their frames
will be ready for erection in the Cultural
Leonard French... in love with shape and color
Centre, 50 feet above the floor of the
hall.
The artist communicates his own ex-
citement as he tells how it will look.
The strong fingers stab into the air as
he explains the design, and, especially,
the color: “I think of the whole thing
as a huge, deep, and sonorous Persian
carpet suspended in the air, 50 feet up,
with the light streaming through, the
colors breaking and falling on the
walls and floor. The colors will change
with the sun’s position and at night the
glass will be lit electronically.”
Occasionally the excitement gives way
to doubt: “If I succeed it will be one
of the greatest pieces of glasswork in
the world. But if I fail . . . well . . •
Look, this thing will either be a great
work or a disaster.” He rises and paces
the room for a few seconds, still talking:
“It’s not yet possible to see if weve
succeeded. All those glass triangles in
their frames up at the mill. September
will tell the tale.” The exultation soon
returns: “But I tell you this, boy, if it
looks like I designed it people with two
eyes are in for a surprise. It will knock
them over with its brilliance . . . with
color like they’ve never seen.”
In addition to the Cultural Centre
job, French is also working on 16
stained-glass windows for the National
Library in Canberra. They should be
completed by the end of the year and
then he can get back to full-time paint-
ing, for it is as a painter that he has
achieved fame, and as a painter he will
finally be judged.
French is often described as an Aus-
tralian prototype of the poor, unrecog-
nised artist, despised by the critics and
garret-bound, whom the capricious
Muses suddenly raise to fame and for-
tune in the final moments of despair.
That he served his apprenticeship as
a signwriter has reinforced the myths
which surround his reputation.
The unsentimental fact is that
although, like all artists, he has known
lean periods, his work has usually been
received fairly well by the critics, and
he achieved some notoriety as a painter
when quite young. The myth of the
semi-literate signwriter suddenly dis-
covering his latent genius is equally
silly. He has been an avid and intelli-
gent reader since he left school. He
has always been drawn to the vocation
of the artist.
The vocation which called him into
the pottery kilns at Brunswick allowed
him only three concerns at State and
technical schools: drawing, painting,
and modelling. It next took him
pedalling to a firm of city signwriters,
where his passion for covering large
walls with paint was put to commercial
use. A real Gulley Jimson of a boy, he
covered himself and the City of Mel-
bourne with paint all day before head-
ing off to trade and art classes at the
Melbourne Tech, at night.
Anyone with a large wall was in
danger, including the vicar of the local
Congregational Church, who was
approached by a 19-year-old sign-
writer with a notion about frescoes. The
result was a couple of pigment-and-
water-on-wet-plaster murals, which
rocked the congregation when they were
unveiled by Councillor Denzil Don, a
local football manufacturer.
The murals were a powerful mixture
°f war, suffering, and religion, rawly
conceived but executed with remarkable
craftsmanship. Some claimed that thev
Were irreligious in their modernity and
°. ers suggested that a competent sign-
Writer be called in to paint them over.
The papers gave the controversy a good
run. Next year the notorious young
artist held his first exhibition —of paint-
ings and mural designs. Only a few
days past 21, he sold pictures worth
$320 and thought the really big-time
was not far off.
As well as reading through the works
of Hugo, Dumas, Melville, and Homer,
the artist had become influenced by
James Joyce: he decided that it was
time for young Daedalus to go abroad.
The bright shrewd eyes of Len French
went with him to England, Ireland,
the Netherlands, watching and noting.
He returned 18 months later without
any pictures to show for his experience,
but with a head full of designs, colors,
and plans. An exhibition soon followed
at the now-closed Stanley Coe Gallery,
an exhibition significant because what
some had taken to be social realist
strains in his work were now beginning
to be subsumed into a symbolism under
strong intellectual control. Critics
praised his rich and vibrant colors.
Looking back, French says: “I was
never really a modern, though I was
often described as one in the early days.
I have always believed that emotions
need order, and that art is as much
concerned with compression as expres-
sion. I have always felt that I belonged
to a tradition.”
In three other one-man exhibitions
during the 19505, he moved deeply into
Western heroic traditions and symbols.
The Iliad series came first and three
years later the Odyssey series was
shown. Alan McCulloch thought the
Iliad was the outstanding one-man show
of 1952; Arnold Shore wrote that it
was the most impressive exhibition of
modern art yet held in Melbourne.
The heroic journey and the symbols
of the creatures of the sea and sky
emerged as preoccupations. In the
geometry of the paintings lurked the
threat of the machine, and, perhaps,
mechanised man. The mood was to link
ancient themes with modern forms. Is
the artist a 20th-century Ulysses in a
machine world? The links with Joyce
seemed strong.
But the market failed to respond.
French reckons that the Odyssey ex-
hibition represented four years’ work.
Sales came to two pictures and $l2O.
(According to my information these
were recently sold again; this time for
more than $2000.) To survive the lean
years he worked at his trade for a time
and then at various technical schools,
the Melbourne School of Printing and
Graphic Arts, the William Angliss Food
Trades School, and finally became
Exhibitions Officer at the Melbourne
National Gallery. Before landing the last
job he indulged his craving for large
designs and color in two sets of murals.
At the new “Legend” cafe espresso
in Bourke St., Melbourne, citizens
variously responded in surprise, terror,
or pleasure to a set of six feet by four
feet panels titled “The Seven Voyages
of Sinbad the Sailor” . . . Before the
town could recover French struck again
at Melbourne University’s Beaurepaire
Sports Centre with a mural 80 feet by
18. Both works were called abstracts by
their opponents, though they are clearly
symbolic and demand the use of the
mind as well as the eye. “Some people
think you should be able to take a
painting all in within a few minutes,”
says French, “well, I don’t paint like
that. You can’t take in a symphony in a
few minutes, either.”
The murals were paying propositions
but the rest of the work was in his debt.
In 1958 he exhibited 20 paintings at
the newly named Museum of Modern
Art. He sold one for $BO. The Mel-
bourne poet Vincent Buckley has writ-
ten of it: “The tone of this period
is set by such paintings as ‘The
Artificer,’ ‘The Iconoclast,’ and ‘The
Death of A Hero,’ all of which reveal a
growing tendency to see the aspiration
to heroism corrupted by an element of
sheer self-aggrandising play in the hero’s
stance as well as by the certainty of his.
eventual defeat.”
The artist began to be troubled by
the possibility of his own defeat. One
or two of the critics were kind, but
nobody seemed interested much any
more in what he was doing. John
Hetherington records French as saying:
“Every exhibition I held after (the
first) was progressively less successful
... I began to wonder if I had been
kidding myself.”
Intemperate will —his enemies call it
cockiness —when allied with abundant
talent (French denies that he was born
with much “talent”) is hard to beat;
and a year later he won the Crouch
Prize at the Ballarat Art Gallery and
a travelling scholarship to the Far
East. He travelled in India, China,
Japan, and Indonesia, letting the colors,
the architecture, the myths and symbols
seep into his brain. The decision was
made to become a full-time painter;
“I realised that I had to live fully
with my art; the rest was distraction
and temptation.”
The Perth Prize for Contemporary
Art, in 1960, brought second place in
the Rubinstein Scholarship, and the
Sulman Prize for a beautiful painting
called “The Burial,” in which gilded
figures are interlocked in a tomb. The
richness of the gold, reds, browns, and
blues is commanded by a symmetry-
in which the form of the circle is
dominant and the symbols of the fish
and the seed recur.
Word went out among the dealers
that French had perhaps been too long
neglected, that here was a boy worth
watching. People began to buy, but not
extravagantly. Toward the end of 1960
Farmer’s Blaxland Gallery in Sydney
and the Argus Gallery in Melbourne


hung a group of paintings which be-
came known as the Campion series.
Fame and fortune ran hot together. In
the panic of realisation people tried to
buy the whole collection before the
exhibition was opened.
In the opening oration Vincent Buck-
ley said that he was almost tempted
to compare French’s imagination with
St. Paul’s in its sense of certain theo-
logical mysteries: “The meanings which
French’s paintings create or constitute
are not merely private ones, but ones
which reverberate into fields of which
he knows nothing.” Robert Hughes
wrote that he had achieved a state
“where painting ceases to be a ‘cultural
activity’ and becomes a ritual in the
dark, an affirmation and a kind of
prayer.”
The paintings were in ordinary hard-
ware-store enamel on hessian-covered
hardboard. A glance at the names of
some of the buyers may indicate the
success of the exhibition:
“Autumn in the Garden” . . . Qld.
Art Gallery.
“The Crusader” (and six others) ...
Rudy Komon Galleries.
“The Crossing” . . . Mrs. Harold
Holt.
“Fish Transfixed” . . . Mrs. E. Bail-
lieu.
“Death and Transfiguration” . . .
Art Gallery of N.S.W.
“Death Full of Wounds” . . . Skinner
Galleries, Perth.
“In the Beginning” . . . Mr. J. Fair-
fax.
Len French had arrived. No more
bed-sitters; no scratching to buy mater-
ials; no more tramping through foreign
cities with the arse half out of his trous-
ers. Politics was short and art was long.
Religion? Critics began to call him a
religious painter after the brilliant series
on the life and death of the martyr
Edmund Campion, and some still do.
French does not accept the description.
“I am part of a tradition in which
religion has always been important,
and perhaps primal, but I do not be-
lieve that I am a religious painter in
any very serious sense of the term. Nor
am I a religious man in the usually
accepted ways.”
Not quite a religious man, but steeped
in Christian tradition; not lacking in any
of the sensitivity and imaginative pri-
vacy of the artist yet also shrewd and
calculating when his interests are at
stake; delicately sensuous and at the
same time heavily masculine, French
remains an enigma even to some of his
friends.
The voice and manner could be only
Australian: “Jeez, I’ll tell you what, we
know what work is up at the mill, all
right.” But there is nothing dry or
laconic about him. The words tumble
out in disorderly procession, relating im-
pressions, ideas, ambitions. Some of the
talk is for fun, some the verbalising-
of visual pictures (there is still a lot of
energy left for his art), and a lot of it
shrewd judgment on men and their
cultures. French is too egocentric to be
less than serious for long.
Above all he is a maker: “In art
you are not teaching anybody any-
thing,” he said, when we talked last
week, “you are making something; mak-
ing something. And it takes you a long
time to make anything good.”
My mind recalled the small boy and
the pottery kilns as he added: “It’s
strange, you know, when I lived in
Brunswick, if you were a painter it
made you quite odd, not just because
you were a painter, but because you
made something important to yourself.
Nobody else made anything.”
After the Campion paintings the
maker won the Blake Prize, the Georges
Prize, and the Wills Prize. In 1963 he
French at Heathcote, and in the back-
ground art dealer Rudy Komon
went to the Greek island Samos with
his wife, Helen, and the youngest two
of his four children (the Frenchs now
have another son): “1 wanted to work
close to where Eastern and Western
civilisations were born. We lived with-
in cock-crow of Turkey, but on an
island of Greece.” One of the products
was a series pf small paintings known
as the Samos miniatures. (Pythagoras
was born on Samos.)
After winning the Harkness Fellow-
ship he took off for the United States
and Yale in 1965. He told me on his
return last year that he found most
Americans courteous and friendly; the
young intellectuals were “very bright
and well informed”; the painters were
inclined to be more tempted into gim-
mickry than they are here, probably
because of the ceaseless demand for
the new, the latest; the younger painters
were often sadly deficient i n the
mechanics of the art and “were naivelv
impressed by my craftsmanship.”
He is still trying to assimilate his
American experience, but he feels that
in New York, certainly, he was ex-
periencing the end of something rather
than its beginning. “Death in the City”
is the theme tempting him toward a
series of American paintings.
More immediately he plans to com-
plete a series of paintings based on the
Upanishads, a theme which indicates
a growing interest in Eastern and Far
Eastern cultures. It will be no surprise
if he moves away from Celtic, Classical
and Byzantine symbols toward those
of the Orient.
Now that he has hit the big-time
(the glasswork contracts demand he
be insured for $200,000) the critics are
beginning to divide again. Some say
that he is not so much a painter as a
tapestry worker with paints; others that
his art is too concerned with surface
decoration, too brilliantly colorful for
its structures; by contrast, others suggest
that the designs are too calculated, too
much like architect plans in color.
On the other side there are critics
who claim that French is the best
Australian painter to emerge in the
post-war generation, and that he is the
most original man since Nolan. French
suffers from no false modesty hut is
wary of such comparisons. For one
thing, it is clear that he does not share
some of the more extravagant views of
Nolan’s work.
He has little time for city painters
and expatriates who spend their lives
trying to create myths about the bush:
“I live on the Australian coastal fringe
and so do most of the artists who are
hard at it painting the Australian in-
terior. We’re a long way from the bush,
Ned Kelly, and wild emus.” (He smiles
ruefully at a much younger Len French
who set out in a horse and cart to
paint Australia and got as far as
Albury.)
It’s hard to find out what the dealers
are now getting for his best paintings
—s4ooo, $6OOO perhaps? but the
prices indicate that the Australian
market, partly through the influence
of French and his contemporaries, is
becoming more cosmopolitan. It also
seems that the international art market
looks to Australia for more than the
symbols of a pioneering society: the
Rockefeller, Luce, and Rothschild
families in America all own French
paintings.
The fame of it all does not bothei
him much. He likes the trips overseas,
the good wines, the dinners with public
men, but he could live easily without
them. The call of art is much stronger,
not art for the sake of a better standaid
of living, but art for the love of sym-
bol, symmetry, and color, for the cele-
bration of dead kingdoms and then
heroes. “Painting,” he declares, “is con-
cerned with death and how heroically
you can handle it.”


Dark world of the Victorian A.L.P.
FANS OF J. R. Tolkien and his three-
volume fantasy “The Lord of the Rings”
should have no difficulty in following
Labor politics in Victoria. Both worlds
are peopled with mysterious creatures
w ho come and go on dread errands,
and both are commanded by strange
and contending powers.
Only those versed in the ways of
hobbits, wizards, and ores can really
understand.
In Victorian Labor consider the fac-
tions and forces, and the following is
only part of the line-up:
1. The Moscow-line fellow-travellers
who ride into union office on unity
tickets with Moscow-line Communists
such as those in the Railways Union.
2. The Peking-line fellow-travellers
who do the same with Peking-liner
Communists like Clarrie O’Shea of the
Tramways Union.
3. Italian-line fellow-travellers who
get their politics from Rex Mortimer
and “Arena.”
4. The members of the Trades Hall
branch of the Masonic Lodge.
5. The intellectuals, professional men,
and students of varied ideologies
who circulate around Dr. Cairns and
feed on trade union militancy. They
were formerly represented in the pages
of “Melbourne Partisan” but now tend
to support “Dissent.”
6. The pragmatic social reformers,
mainly professional men, such as Mr.
R. D. (“Barney”) Williams, of the Aus-
tralian Council of Salaried and Pro-
fessional Associations, who publish
“Labor Comment.” *
7. The trade union moderates gath-
ered around Mick Jordan, secretary of
Trades Hall, represented by the maga-
zine “The Unionist'.” |
8. The anti-Conimunist social demo-
crats who write for “Spotlight” and are
alleged to have contact with the DLP.
There is a spillover from some of the
groups to others. For example, Mr. Bill
Hartley, secretary of the Victorian
Labor Party, maintains contact with
e ach of the first five groups and is not
entirely represented by the designs of
any single one of them.
The “Labor Comment” group led
Ly Barney Williams, Mr. Dick
McGarvfe, Q.C., and solicitors Mr. John
Cain (son of a former Premier) and
Mr. John Button, and the Jordan and
Spotlight” groups have been outside
die corridors of power for many years.
More recently, the group around Dr.
Cairns has also found itself drifting

away from the decision-makers of the
ALP.
Real power now resides in these first
four groups and an amicable power
struggle is occurring among them. The
polarisation is best understood in terms
of whether loyalties are given to Mos-
cow or Peking, and the chief focus of
the present rivalries is the Trade Union
Defence Committee, an organisation
which has determined Victorian ALP
policy and personnel for the past
decade.
BY BRIAN BUCKLEY
The TUDC was once controlled by
the organisers of unity tickets with
Moscow-line Communists, but lately
allegiances have been moving east.
Some TUDC leaders have been in-
fluenced by trips to China and others
have been impressed by the more mili-
tant industrial attitudes of Communists
such as Ted Hill, Clarrie O’Shea, and
Paddy Malone, as compared with the
more cautious policies of J. J. Brown
and George Seelaf.
The Pro-Peking ALP faction thinks
almost entirely in industrial terms and
has only two immediate political con-
cerns: to force Whitlam into a corner
and to make ALP foreign policy anti-
American. Industrially, they plan to
work through union amalgamations and
shop committees to create a strong
union movement outside the authority
of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council
and the Australian Council of Trade
Unions. The Victorian ALP will be
used as a pawn in this industrial game.
An indication of TUDC intent is the
motion to be put to this week’s ALP
State conference that unions be
allowed to affiliate with the ALP with-
out being required first to join the
Trades Hall Council.
Intervention
The “Labor Comment” and Jordan
forces are organising an executive elec-
tion ticket to challenge the rulers at
the conference. The big numbers from
the Communist-led unions will ensure
the return of the Party’s present leaders.
The hope of the anti-Communists is
to command a respectable vote and
muster a team of able and well-regar-
ded men to stand against the present
regime. A good minority vote and an
attractive anti-executive ticket could
encourage Federal intervention into the
Victorian Party, if Whitlam can carry
the day at the ALP Federal Con-
ference next month.
But there are problems. For one thing,
Jordan has his hands full with trouble
at the Trades Hall over the 110 per-
cent rises in affiliation fees. Some of
his former supporters are siding with
the Communists in opposing the rises.
Another problem is that Jordan, whose
name and authority are vital to the
reform movement, shows signs of a
declining interest in Labor Party affairs.
He made his big play a couple of years
ago and lost. If Whitlam wants Jordan’s
full support in any move against the
Victorian executive he could be in for
some hard bargaining. At present, Jor-
dan is unlikely to stand on the anti-
executive ticket at Conference, but will
be represented by some of his closest
supporters.
In addition, the reformers are finding
it hard to agree on their ticket and
how representative it should be. Some
feel Left-wing unionists should be in-
cluded for balance, and to impress
Federal Conference with the reformers’
broadmindedness and maturity. Others
believe that such a move would more
likely produce the reverse effect.
For further insight readers are re-
ferred back to Tolkien and the world of
the Dark Lord of Mordor.




The other Edinburgh
Part one of two parts
By BATMAN
WE HARDENED VETERANS of
royal tours are a little alarmed. So far
there has not been a gesture, not a
single preparation to commemorate the
centenary of the greatest royal tour of
them all, that of His Royal Highness
Prince Alfred Ernest Albert, Duke of
Edinburgh, second son of Queen Vic-
toria.
At the tender age of 23 he was out
here in the colonies from October 30,
1867, to April 6, 1868. Frankly, to com-
pare any other royal tour with this one
is like trying to rate the Managatang
races with the Melbourne Cup.
Prince Alfred came as Captain of
HMS Galatea, a frigate, “a perfect
model of naval architecture,” 3227 tons.
Adelaide went almost sick with excite-
ment. Bonfires were lit prematurely and
gun salutes went off ahead of time.
Several sonnets, songs, and odes were
composed for the occasion. One which
was sung at the royal banquet began:
“Oh, welcome, welcome, Royal
Heart!
May ev’ry delight impart
The “Advertiser” even went so far as
to suggest that the Prince should be
invited to accept the throne of Australia.
What a splefidid way to unite the
colonies!
Yet, unquestionably, the greatest wel-
come was to be in Melbourne. The
“Argus” took 30 full columns to itemise
the decorations, and we recommend the
document to the Moomba committee for
future inspiration.
There were triumphal arches at
South Melbourne, in Collins Street,
arches in Little Bourke Street put up
by the Chinese community, in Toorak
Road, South Yarra, and the one on
Princes Bridge was utterly noble with
arches either end, trelliswork in be-
tween, and 82 flags on top.
There was barely a building in the
city that did not have the most mar-
vellous and ingenious illuminations and
transparencies. The Treasury buildings
were “one blaze of light from end to
end” with all sorts of stars, and crowns,
plus one colossal illuminated picture of
the Queen 27ft. by 13ft. There were
5000 lanterns in the Fitzroy Gardens,
and, on the night of November 23, all
Melbourne came to town to see the
Wheelbarrow and
spade presented to
the Duke of Edin-
burgh when he turn-
ed the first sod of the
Launceston and Wes-
tern Railway
Triumphal arch on Princes Bridge, Melbourne, for the visit of Prince Alfred, Duke
of Edinburgh, in 1867
glory of it all. The “Argus” put the
crowd at 100,000 souls, causing such
a congestion the procession of car-
riages took hours to inch its way up
Swanston St.
There were balls, there were levees,
the Duke laid the foundation stone of
Melbourne Town Hall. For this he
received a 22-carat gold trowel, decora-
ted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
pearls, and turquoises to the value of
£2OO. He also laid the foundation stone
of the Adelaide GPO, where again
he picked up a gold trowel, a silver-
plated level, a gold plumb-bob, and a
blackwood carved mallet. Actually, the
Prince laid a trail of foundation stones
from Adelaide to Brisbane and ulti-
mately returned to England with the
biggest collection of gold trowels, levels,
plumb-bobs, and mallets the world had
seen. In Launceston, when turning the
first sod of the local railway, he
received a silver spade and an utterly
gorgeous wheelbarrow with stags’ feet.
One really wonders what became of
that.
However, the occasion which was to
go down in history was the “Citizens’
Free Banquet.” The “Argus,” just a
few days before, had been purring over
the exemplary behaviour of the Mel-
burnian citizen, how not even a twig
had been broken in the Fitzroy Gardens,
and how “nowhere else in the king-
dom upon which the sun never sets
could a travelling scion of the reign-
ing family have received such a loyal
greeting.” It was just as well that the
“Argus” got these lines in early.
Originally, the free banquet was to be
just for the poor, but then the problem
arose, “How do you define a poor per-
son?” So the banquet committee de-
cided to leave this to the public
conscience and make it an open invita-
tion.
The committee expected 10,000 to
feast and 10,000 to watch. The “Argus”
said the preparations were “the like of
which had not been seen or heard of
since King Arthur held his Royal
Christmas at Carlisle”; the commis-
sariat might have sufficed to victual
the army of Darius for a week’s march.
The Sunbury wine-growers donated
600 gallons of claret and the Colling-
wood Brewery gave 360 gallons of beer.
There were 500 loaves, 70 tons of
potatoes, 120,0001 b. of meat, 5000 pies,
45001 b. of plum pudding, plus fish,
tarts, cakes, lollies, buns, fruit.
The banquet was in the old Zoologi-
cal Gardens in Richmond Park, by the
Yarra, not far from the Melbourne
Cricket Ground. Everything was
beautifully done. There were 50 fires to
cook the food. There was nearly a
mile of tables, all decorated with
flowers and ferns. Wine was pumped
through two fountains, one raised high
and connected to a siphon pump, the
other attached to a 500-gallon vat.
The first grounds for uneasiness came
early* The streets were filled with large
numbers of fashionably dressed women
w ho looked particularly unpoor. By
noon it seemed that every buggy, wagon,
gig, or what have you was headed along
the dusty road to Richmond Park.
The Duke was due to appear at 2
p.m. Indeed, originally he had been
invited to come at 1 p.m. to declare the
affair open. As the “Argus” put it, had
he shown the good manners of royalty
and arrived on time, perhaps all would
have been well.
Thousand after thousand after
thousand poured into the grounds.
Rather than the 20,000 expected, the
crowd grew to a ravenous 60,000. At
1.40 p.m. the first barrier gave way
and the 250 police managed to throw
the mob back.
Twenty young ladies in blue and
white were there nicely lined up to
present the Duke with a flag to run
up a mast and also to present him with
a golden goblet to take the first glass of
wine. By 2.30 p.m. he still hadn’t
arrived. The pressure was too great, and
this time the barriers really did
crumble under the united strength of
the army of Darius.
Some women shrieked. Others fainted.
The long tables were rushed, and in a
few minutes there was nothing left of
the vast store. By this time word had
gone to the Duke “better never than
late,” and he was turned away as he
was approaching the gates at 3 p.m.
At this stage let us hand the story
over to the “Argus” reporter: “A short
walk through the gardens, threading
the crowd which choked the place,
soon showed what sort of a struggle
there had been for victuals. Loaves
Reception to the Duke by the Mayor and Corporation of Melbourne
bedabbled in mud, and joints with only
half the meat cut away, and covered
with dust, lay there. Boys catching
hold of fresh loaves tore them to pieces
like wolves. The long rows of barrels
of ale had been rapidly disposed of by
the simple process of beating in the
heads of the casks and dipping out the
liquor in the readiest way. In the tent
appropriated to the committee there
were a few cases of porter and cham-
pagne, and some were opened for the
police. This got abroad and soon the
mob collected. Cases of champagne
were then pulled away from under the
folds of the tent and the purloiners
could not be caught every time. At
last, as everyone foresaw, there was a
great rush and the tent was pulled down
over the heads of the committee and
most of the contents appropriated as
loot, long before the police could
interfere.”
Next there were cries of “WINE,
WINE, WE WANT WINE.” Dr.
Louis L. Smith, chairman of the
banquet committee, said it had been
decided not to give away the wine now
but to reserve it for the poor. The
cries for the wine became louder than
ever. Somebody threw an egg which
“landed on a poor little girl’s hat.”
There was a rush. One man climbed
up and pulled the spigot out of the
500-gallon vat and out came the wine
drenching those all about. Another
thirsty man climbed the tree where
there was a cask to supply one of the
wine fountains. There, he cut the
pipes and sprinkled wine over the
heads of the crowd.
For nearly half an hour the wine
kept running and it was a matter for
Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh
furious expedition. The claret had to
be drunk at high speed to save it from
running all over the ground.
As the “Argus” said: “The expected
consequences followed. By 5 o’clock
hundreds of men and boys were reeling
through the crowd.” Some were satura-
ted with wine from head to foot and
they enjoyed themselves by abusing the
gentry. “Indeed, they introduced an
indescribably rowdy element into the
proceedings. Such a glorious fete never
before was seen in Melbourne and let
us hope never will again.”
But then the “Sydney Morning
Herald” said it was really only to be
expected. “It must be remembered that
in Melbourne there is a large number
of the vilest of the vile remnants of
old convict systems the gathering
of old seditions and of all those
abominations which are heaped upon
new countries.”
The “Argus” was shocked to the
bottoms of its sticks of handset type.
“The editor of the ‘Herald’ must have
been dreaming when he allowed such
a paragraph to appear, it amounts to
almost a breach of privilege.”
However, Sydney’s turn was yet to
come. Read all about it in next w'eek’s
royal episode.

Suburbia at the frontier
Workers at Weipa live in picture-book surroundings
Their modern bungalows only lack the city’s TV
BY MICHAEL BAUME
IT’S SUPPOSED to be the frontier,
the place where a special breed of men
are toiling in the tropical heat to open
up the huge mineral developments now
changing the face of northern Aus-
tralia. But there is not much of a
frontier look about Weipa, the most
northern and remote outpost of all,
where a collection of 100 VIPs last
weekend sat down to a formal dinner
in the mess to open the town officially.
Up near the top of Cape York on the
Gulf of Carpentaria, only 12 degrees
below the equator, 360 miles north-
west of Cairns over a rough track that
is unusable most of the year, 550
people are working in and building the
$3O million facilities for the world’s
biggest bauxite mining operation. They
have gone there because the area holds
20 percent of the Western world’s known
reserves of commercial grade bauxite.
But the 20th-century frontiersmen
have brought theit suburbia with them.
These tamers of the north live in their
three-bedroom brick bungalows (all
electric), amid trim, quarter-acre lawns,
the product of the familiar Sunday
morning whine of motor mowers. Their
wives shop at the local supermarket,
where prices, subsidised by the com-
pany, are no worse than Cairns, and
for some things like rump steak at
60 cents a pound a lot better than
Sydney. With their boats on trailers,
they take their children down for a
day on the water and come back to go
to the dance or the pictures.
Their attractive houses, of 12 squares
and costing $28,000 each, are made of
local bricks, with the unusual additives
of white-ant killer and bauxite, and
they rent for only $5.20 a week. Be-
hind each one is the familiar hallmark
of suburbia, the rotary hoist, all have
washing machines, hot-water systems,
and refrigerators. Only TV is missing.
There is an excellent tap-water
supply, the town is fully sewered, a
hospital is planned, and a police
station, intriguingly sited between the
quarters of single men and single
women, is being built.
But home isn’t the only place where
the Weipa pioneers can be comfortable.
The town centre, designed “to create
a focus for the community,” has a
splendid vista over the open Gulf
waters. The supermarket is here, along
with a snack bar, hotel, the cinema, and
community hall, and the tennis courts,
bowling green, and swimming pool.
True, there are some signs or the
frontier; there are too many sharks
and crocodiles in the rivers to risk
swimming there (so the company has
built a 25-metre fresh-water pool that
is hardly ever used); there are fly-
screens on every window and door to
keep out the insects which plague the
place just before the Wet. And there
is the isolation. But even this is
diminished, since the daily plane ser-
vice to Cairns costs only $7O return,
and days off are easy to come by.
And even the climate is tempered. It
gets oppressive in November and
December, but with a prevailing cool
breeze off the Gulf, the temperature
rarely gets over the century. It averages
96deg. in summer and 80 in winter,
but on a winter morning can toqch
around 54deg.
Most of the average take-home pay
of about $lOO a week (for 60 hours
work) can be saved; some people are
even doing enough overtime to get up
around the $l5O a week mark, but that
is really pushing it. Working for ten
hours a day, six days a week, in the
tropics is no one’s idea of fun. For the
married men with their families, the
only really “frontier” element about
the place is the amount of work to be
done and the money to be earned.
Things are not altogether home-
from-home for most of the 170 men in
the single quarters. About two-thirds
of them are married and want to bring
their wives as soon as they can get a
house; there is an 18-months waiting
list and the company is planning to
build another 25 houses, but these won’t
go far to meeting the demand. So most
of the men are just there to make as
much as they can as quickly as possible
and then get back south. Many don’t
stay more than six months before mov-
ing on.
Out of his average wage of $lOO
clear, it costs a single man $14.96 a
week full board (and that involves
Comalco in a 100 percent subsidy) in
fairly comfortable double rooms
which will eventually be single when
enough accommodation has been built,
Beer is the biggest cost: a 7oz. glass
is 12 cents and a half bottle is 30 cents
(everyone drinks these “stubbies,” be-
cause a big bottle of beer is getting
warm by the time you get down half
way).
At present the beer consumption
runs at about 36 18-gallon kegs and
8000 “stubbies” a week for the 550
people in the Weipa area. At one stage
the average consumption was as high
as 10 stubbies a day, a reaction, it has
been whimsically suggested, from the
time the place was run by the Presby-
terian mission. But the community thirst
has slackened almost in proportion to
the arrival of more wives.
Nowadays, if you open up a mine in
the north, you don’t just build a camp
in the bush. As Comalco puts it:
“Research was instigated to measure
the environment and psychological and
sociological criteria likely to apply at
Weipa.” Arid the result is “the most
thorough and fundamental planning for
a new community in a tropical environ-
ment undertaken to date in Australia.
“The research showed that acclima-
tised Australians in the Weipa environ-
ment would work and live most
effectively if sheltered in houses open
to the natural, ambient temperature and
breezes, provided direct sunlight and
indirect radiation were reduced to a
minimum.” That means there is no
air-conditioning, except in the offices,
shops, and public buildings.
But despite the lack of air condition-
ing, many of the 55 men with their
families in the housing estate have
never had things so good; have never
lived so well, and saved so much. F°’
them, this is the affluent frontier.

Sukarno sorts out his wives
The Great Lover
No. 1, Fatmawati
No. 2, Hartini
No. 3, Dewi
No. 4, Haryati
No. 5, Jurike Sanger
SUKARNO HAS LOST his political
power and the love of most of his
people but he still has the love of
his wives. But even some of this com-
fort, it seems, is going to be denied
him. A devout Moslem is allowed four
wives but the Indonesian Ministry of
Religious Affairs, which has been doing
some adding up lately, has come up
with a bigger tally for Sukarno; five
“definite” wives, with strong indications
of a sixth, and possibly even a seventh.
Occasionally, at weekends, Sukarno
can be seen driving around in a red
Volkswagen with wife No. 2, Hartini,
and some of their children, and there
is speculation whether “Doctor Engineer
Sukarno” will continue to stay at
Madame Hartini’s house in Bogor,
outside Djakarta, or move to a new resi-
dence being built at nearby Batutulis.
Bung Karno has had to leave the
beautiful Summer Palace of the former
Dutch Governor-General in Bogor, as
well as the Istana Negara and Istana
Merdeka in Djakarta. These places are
needed now for official functions of the
Acting President, General Suharto.
It was only on April 8 last that
General Suharto received the creden-
tials of a foreign ambassador at the
Merdeka Palace for the first time. The
polite General had been waiting tact-
fully so as not to hurt Bapak’s (Great
Father’s) feelings more than necessary.
The newly built residence at Batutu-
lis commands a wonderful view of Mt.
Salak, but seems a rather lonely place.
An Indonesian friend told me that
Sukarno visited the finished house a few
weeks ago with an old Dutch friend,
Konijnenburg. “That’s my place,” he
said, “where I shall finish my life to
be stabbed to death by a wonderful
woman, if old sayings come true . . .”
Sukarno was said to have been moved
to tears by this sentimental reflection.
He may derive comfort from the neigh-
borhood, a historic spot which has
famous stone inscriptions in an ancient
language of some 1500 years ago, and
revered relics of the old Sundanese
(West Java) kingdom.
Bung Karno can also find there
one of his favorite symbols, a stone
phallus, hidden in a poor bamboo shack,
which is in sharp contrast to the culti-
vated atmosphere of his country resi-
dence. There is a big lawn before the
house with a pond, decorated with
bronze and stone maidens in Sukarno’s
style of bourgeois realism—all naked.
This is not liked very much in Islam-
minded Western Java.
While Sukarno can enjoy the com-
pany of Hartini, there is also the house
of Madame Dewi, No. 3, reserved for
him in Djakarta as an additional resi-
dence —but, alas, the beautiful Japanese
Dewi is not there. Since early this
year she has been in Japan, where she
gave birth to her first child in March.
With growing agitation in Indonesia
to prevent her return, and angry ques-
tions about the source of her wealth,
27-year-old Dewi last week postponed
her return indefinitely. She had plan-
ned to rejoin Sukarno for his 66th
birthday, on June 6, but Djakarta news-
paper taunts about “that bar girl”
were no encouragement.
Relieved of his task of saving his
people (and the rest of mankind),
Sukarno must now pay some attention
.to the problem of his supernumerary
wives. It is agreed among Sukarno-
A "Far Eastern
Economic Review" report from
0. G. Roeder, in Djakarta
watchers that he has been formally
married to:
• Madame Fatmawati, considered to be
wife No. 1, living apart from her hus-
band and just back from medical treat-
ment in England.
• Madame Hartini, accused of being
Sukarno’s contact-maker with China
as well as with local Chinese business-
men.
• Madame Dewi, most publicly dis-
liked of the wives.
• Madame Haryati, 27, always forced
to fight for public recognition.
• Madame Jurike Sanger, 21, a beauti-
ful Menadonese woman in the shadows.
There are strong indications of a sixth
wife, Hilda Djafar, kept well hidden,
and even a seventh, Lory Ismail, a
“gift” from the old Governor of Central
Kalimantan to Sukarno, and said to
be presently in Tokyo.
Sukarno has set about reducing the
number of his wives (concubines are
another matter) by officially divorcing
Madame Haryati. His letter to her
said: “Yatie (pet name for Haryati),
I divorce you not because you have
committed any mistake. I divorce you
because we cannot go together.”
This painful affair was not mentioned
when I paid a visit several weeks ago
to Madame Haryati, in her rather
modest bungalow. “Please don’t ask me
about Bapak,” Madame Haryati said
while her beautiful black eyes moved
over the many photos arranged every-
where in the spacious hall—all of them
showing a happy couple, Sukarno and
Haryati. She proudly let me see
Sukarno’s dedications: “Close to me
with body, close to me with the soul,
that’s you, Yatie, my wife” . . . “Longer
than your hair is my love for you,
Yatie.”
Sukarno, in photos, was everywhere
in the house—Sukarno in the pose of a
proud warlord, Sukarno just in sandals,
Sukarno as a very important states-
man, Sukarno as a lover. In the bed-
room, with its vast bed, I was impressed
by a huge oil painting of a voluptuous
lady, very scantily dressed, and too
daring for a “Playboy” double-spread.
It was to Haryati’s house, not this
place but a previous one, that Sukarno
went in the early hours of October 1,
1965, during the attempted Communist
coup. He had spent most of the night
in the residence of his Japanese wife,
Dewi, but, alarmed by reports of rebel-
lion, left Dewi’s house and rushed to
Haryati’s place, which was not known
to the public. The switch from wife
to wife was not some delicate love game,
but just to find shelter before deciding
to go to Halim Air Base to be near a
jet plane in case events got worse.
Madame Haryati would like very
much to shelter Bapak again in his
present days of worry. She met him in
1963 while working in the State Sec-
retariat. The eyes of the virile President
flashed with fire when he saw her and
he soon showed her his batik collection
in a less crowded place. With lightning
speed the wedding was arranged on
March 21, 1963—the day Sukarno re-
ceived the title of Life President of
Indonesia.
No doubt she thinks of the days
during the Third Afro-Asian Film Fes-
tival in Djakarta, when the Great
Lover again and again led off i nto
the famous Indonesian hit:
Haryati, you are the rose which blooms
in the moonlight,
Am I guilty, if dreaming of you?
Tenderly kissing the tips of y oW
fingers?
Haryati, Haryati, Haryati . . •
The days of roses are gone now.

OVERSEAS
The new non-believers in the
great American dream
A LOT OF MIDDLE-CLASS Ameri-
can liberals, who tolerated General
Eisenhower grudgingly and adored Jack
Kennedy, are feeling out of their depth.
They do not understand President
Johnson, any more than he probably
understands them. They detest the war
in Vietnam, though only a small
minority of them are ready to say that
the United States ought to pack it in.
Above all, they suspect that Mr. John-
son is leading American foreign policy
in a new direction, aw ay from the paths
that have become comfortably familial
to them over the past 20 years. They
are quite right, he is. Succeed or fail,
Mr. Johnson is an innovator and in
foreign policy the Americans mistrust
innovation.
The result is what is called by the
sort of Americans who use such phrases,
the alienation of the intellectuals. That
is putting it a bit high; many of the
country’s most intelligent people think
that Mr. Johnson is doing the right
thing and many of his angriest critics
are far from being intellectuals. But
the sense of unease is manifestly there.
Quite a lot of Americans, of the sort
who would describe themselves as
believers in the American dream, arc
feeling lost. They recognise that some-
thing new is happening and they have
not yet adjusted themselves to it.
What has happened is that Mr. John-
son has obliged American liberals to
re-examine some of their unspoken
beliefs about what the United States
tan, and should, be doing in the world.
In the first place, he has ripped away
the last lingering shreds of American
isolationism. It is usually asserted that
isolationism ended in 1917, or in 1941.
°r with the creation of the North
Atlantic alliance in 1949. Yet each of
these three great American interven-
tions in the outside world left one
American myth untouched: the myth
that everything was going to be all
right once the problem in hand had
sorted out. It was Woodrow Wil-
son who said that the fight with the
Kaiser was the war to end war. It was
the Americans who sailed away from
uro pe, after Hitler had been beaten,
ln the pious belief that the alliance with
Stalin would hold together and that the
fold war would not take place.
And when that belief proved wrong,
the way in which the Americans came
back into Europe for the third time in
30 years still showed the influence of
the old dream.
The economic rebuilding of Western
Europe, the creation of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the
encouragement of the European Com-
mon Market, and President Kennedy’s
“grand design” all steps toward
the same objective. The objective wots
the establishment of an equilibrium
between Western Europe and North
America and between the Western
alliance as a whole and the Soviet
Union—a gigantic international balanc-
ing act that w'ould keep the peace and
at the same time make it possible for
President Johnson ... not understood
the United States to spend less of its
time and money w orrying about Europe.
Once again the Americans were trying
to persuade themselves that, if only they
got this one fixed up, it would stay
fixed up for good.
It cannot be done any longer. The
temptation is still there to see the Viet-
nam war as the “last great confronta-
tion” of the post-war era. But for most
people the conviction is fading and with
it the last lingering hope of limiting
America’s responsibilities around the
world.
It is true that, if Vietnam comes out
the right way, the result is likely to be
a period of relative stability in southern
Asia that wall give the non-communist
Asians a chance to organise themselves
against China and the Chinese a chance
to cool down. But neither of those things
is going to happen quickly or to suit
an American timetable.
If the United States wants to give
the Asians a reasonable chance of ex-
panding their economies on non-Marxist
lines, and of developing the relatively
democratic politics that this will make
possible, it must face the prospect of
a succession of messy little crises and,
quite possibly, some more wars and
near-wars. Most people in America
realise this. They also realise that, Asia
being Asia, they are sometimes going
to find themselves supporting allies who
are less than wholly desirable and fight-
ing enemies who are no Hitlers. This
is what happens when a big country
deploys its power for a long-term end.
Mr. Johnson has done to most Ameri-
can’s ideas about their place in the
world what Mao Tse-tung has done
to most Communists’ ideas about
revolution. Mao has announced, by
what he is doing in China, that the
creation of a communist society
requires not just one revolution but a
whole series of upheavals. Mr. Johnson
has announced, in effect, that the pre-
servation of a non-communist alter-
native is likely to require a whole series
of American defensive actions. And the
emphasis is on “American.”
The United States, under Mr. John-
son, has decided that, in dealing with
any given problem, it will move in
company with as many of its friends as
happen to agree with it. If the others
want to stand aside, so be it. It is a far
cry from the spirit of the 19505. It is
the Americans’ response to the different
problems of the 19605.
For many Americans their Govern-
ment’s growing tendency to rely on its
own judgment and its own resources is
disturbing. It is doubly disturbing for
those of them who wonder whether
America has much to offer the world,
anyway. The other main feature of the
long crisis over Vietnam is the extent
to which it has revealed a strong vein
of American self-doubt. This shows
itself, for instance, in the widely held
belief that the United States is regarded
in Asia and Africa as the heir of the
colonial powers.
And the self-doubt runs deeper. It is
possible to find a good many Americans
who will now assert that the “American
model”—-the techniques of liberal demo-
cratic capitalism—is not really applic-
able outside North America and Wes-
tern Europe. Mr. Robert Heilbroner
said so recently, with passion, in
an article called “Counter-revolutionary
America” in the magazine “Commen-
tary.” Mr. Heilbroner believes that it
is urgently necessary to drag the back-
ward rural masses of Asia and Latin
America into the modern world by the

the trend is

Hotel
Here are the reasons why...
The experience of the new man-
agement team is already being
reflected throughout the entire hotel.
The newly decorated rooms and
suites offer the most spacious—and
most gracious—comfort in the city
(yet the rates are comparable with
standard hotels). There, are new
catering facilities, new menus
and an enlarged Vintage Cellar.
There is a new look in service:
most friendly, most efficient, yet
most unobtrusive. There are many
extra services now available
such as free parking for house
guests. All these changes have been
subtly blended into the traditional
atmosphere which has long iden-
tified The Australia as Sydney’s dis-
tinguished hotel.

scruffs of their necks if necessary. Not
many people will disagree with that.
jj ut he also believes that Communism
j s the system best equipped to do the
j o b: “a very few nations, all of them
communist, have succeeded in reaching
into the lives and stirring the minds of
precisely that body of the peasantry.”
It is an odd argument. It ignores
the former peasantries of Europe and
North America and Japan that have
been lifted out of backwardness by other
means. It also ignores the fact that
(he area in which the Russian economy
most conspicuously lags behind the
United States is agriculture. But the
argument is most interesting as an
illustration of how the American op-
position to the war in Vietnam has
gradually shifted its ground. At first
the commonest contention was that the
insurrectionists in Vietnam were really
nationalists more than Communists.
Then it was claimed that, even if South
Vietnam did go Communist, that would
not affect the course of events beyond
Vietnam. Now it is being argued, by
Mr. Heilbroner and those who see things
as he does, that Communism is prob-
ably what most of the world’s popula-
tion needs.
This nagging doubt about the value
of the liberal alternative to Commun-
ism lies very close to the heart of the
criticism of Mr. Johnson’s Asian policy.
The President has put to the test his
country’s belief in what it stands for.
He has asked the Americans to decide
whether they think the liberal model
of national development is applicable
outside the confines of the Atlantic area;
and, if they do, whether they are will-
ing to put American money and Ameri-
can blood behind their belief. By doing
so, he has changed the context in which
the Americans are accustomed to think
about foreign policy.
If the Vietnam action succeeds if
the sort of development that has already
Russian Premier Alexei Kosygin with President Nasser in Cairo last year
taken place in Japan, and is now taking
place in Formosa and Mexico and South
Korea and Jordan, is reproduced in
post-war South Vietnam the doubters
will adjust themselves to the new con-
text rapidly enough. They will have
regained their self-confidence. But if
Mr. Johnson fails, the consequence
could well be a despairing retreat from
the idea that America has much to
offer most of the wmrld.
(An "Economist" report)
Middle East
The Russians' game
THE CHIEF mystery of the Middle
East crisis is what made President Nas-
ser feel strong enough to force a decision
on Israel. It could be that he has more
confidence in his own armed forces’
ability to clobber the Israelis than he
seemed to have two years ago. But the
Israelis believe there is a different ex-
planation. They think that Nasser
has received assurances from Russia
of a far greater degree of support than
anyone had previously assumed.
It is clear that for the past few years
the Russians have been pursuing an
adventurous forward policy in the
Middle East, from as far east as Iran
to as far west as Algeria and as far
south as Somalia. Russia is the chief
provider of arms to both Syria and
Egypt, and has supplied a great deal
of equipment to Algeria as well. The
communist countries now supply nearly
all the economic aid that Syria and
Egypt receive; the Russians played an
important part in bringing about the
defence pact between the two coun-
tries last November. All this fits into
the pattern of a Russian policy of sup-
port for the “revolutionary” Arab States
in the hope of winning the classic bene-
fits of influence and prestige that go
with such a policy. This would be com-

patible with a passive Russian role in
the present crisis.
The Russians could have been
dragged along in the wake of Syria and
Egypt because they felt they could not
afford to seem to be ratting on their
friends. But it does not fit in with the
far more active role the Israelis think
they are playing.
It is necessary to look beyond the
Middle East to make a judgment on
what the Russians are up to. They
want to embarrass the Americans while
they are preoccupied in Vietnam. But
it goes further. They have been sub-
stantially increasing their interconti-
nental missile force since 1965. They
have also been stepping up their sub-
marine forces the world over, and par-
ticularly in the Mediterranean. They
are even reported it sounds like
rumor, though it might explain Presi-
dent Nasser’s self-confidence to have
delivered missiles to Egypt with a
range to hit Israel’s cities.
The general impression conveyed by
such moves is that the Russians are
trying to give themselves the same de-
gree of flexibility and the same range
of options as the United States enjoys
in deploying its military power around
the world. This is w'hat the Russians
discovered they lacked in the Cuba
crisis in 1962.
The Middle East is plainly a hope-
ful area for the Russians if they want
to make their military weight more
mobile around the world. It is rela-
tively near to the Soviet Union. Mili-
tary bases there can reach out to-
ward Africa and across the Indian
Ocean. The Russians can expect to
profit by aligning themselves wfith
Arab radicals against Arab conserva-
tives, and by branding the United
States as the conservatives’ leader.
Last but not least, it may well be
premature to talk, as it is fashionable
to talk, of Western Europe’s reduced
dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
That is very true at present.
But West European oil consumption
has tripled since the Suez crisis in
1956. If it triples again in the next
decade Western Europe will be import-
ing something like eight billion tons of
crude oil between now and 1977. A
very large part of this will have to
come from the Moslem world, which,
with Russia, has a near-monopoly of
proven oil reserves outside the more or
less self-sufficing American oilfields.
The Middle East is so racked by inter-
Moslem quarrels that it is impossible
to predict whether Russia could make
political capital out of such economic
facts. Yet it is not to be ruled out.
Acting with caution and finesse, the
Russians, with the help of their Arab
friends, might be able to play on the
anxieties of Europeans enough to make
them reflect how different their in-
terests potentially are from those of
the United States. The Russians have
shown before now, for instance in the
non-proliferation treaty, that they tend
to turn their diplomatic advantages to
account first and foremost in Eurone
They might do so again.
One can imagine, then, why the Kus-
sians should be pursuing a forward
policy in the Middle East. But, on the
whole, their experiences in Iran and
Turkey and Western Europe have been
that overt threats drive the would-be
victim into the arms of the Americans
President Nasser too has found the
same thing on a smaller scale: the
Yemen war has shown that the worst
way to make Arabs see the light is to
force it on them and arouse their latent
hostility to the foreigner.
For reasons such as these, it has been
assumed that the Russians are not prime
movers in the Middle East crisis; and
the available information tends to con-
firm this view. There have been no
very recent signs of an increase in
movements of Russian submarines or
arms (and their Mediterranean fleet
could still not hope to vie with the
American Sixth Fleet). Russian dip-
lomatic statements, to the extent that
they can be taken at face value, have
been fairly cautious. They seem to be
telling the Arabs that they have already
won a famous victory, and shouldn’t
push their luck too far. For the moment,
the hypothesis remains that the Rus-
sians are profiting by their friendship
with the Arabs but are not themselves
the instigators of President Nasser’s
brinkmanship. But his recklessness
makes one wonder how much Russian
support he really is getting, and what
the Russians think they will get out of
this crisis.
Vietnam
Presidential fight
THE FUTURE President of South
Vietnam will probably represent only a
small minority of the people of the
country as a result of the strange elec-
toral law passed recently by the Con-
stituent Assembly.
The law lays it down that presiden-
tial elections will be held on September
3; that there will be no limit to the
number of candidates; that the candi-

significant percentage of the total
votes! ); that there will be no second
ballot-
public funds will finance the electoral
campaign of all candidates, and about
|A46,000 has already been earmarked
for this purpose. Each candidate will
have to deposit about SAISOO in order
t 0 stand, and those who win less than
ten percent of the polls will forfeit
this sum and will be fined to allow the
Public Fund to recoup the electoral
campaign expenses. It is thus theore-
tically possible that the President elected
on September 3 will obtain only nine
percent, or less, of total votes cast —and
will be accordingly fined!
It must be stressed that the law was
passed by 50 votes to ten, and that only
60 deputies out of a total of 117 mem-
bers attended the debates on the prep-
aration of the electoral law'. For un-
known reasons 57 deputies showed no
interest in participating. One of the
reasons might be that last March several
deputies received parcels containing
grenades, which, although they did not
explode, proved an effective warning.
The leaders of the Constituent As-
sembly had envisaged a more reasonable
law, stipulating that a candidate should
obtain at least 33 percent of the votes
to be elected. If no candidate obtained
this percentage, a second ballot would
have taken place on September 10,
with the number of candidates limited
to two or three. But these proposals were
rejected by the deputies.
In order to stand, civil servants and
Army officers will have to ask for leave
without pay; but the deputies have re-
fused to agree to another recommen-
dation made by the leaders of the
Assembly: that candidates should resign
from official functions.
Thus, General Nguyen Cao Ky, who
has officially announced his candida-
ture, will have to ask for leave, but
will remain Prime Minister until the
elections. General Nguyen Van Thieu,
the Head of State, has also announced
that he will run, so that the two Army
generals in the ruling military direc-
torate will compete for the Presidency
—a competition which coidd, of course,
bring unfortunate results, something the
American authorities would like very
much to avoid.
The extreme Buddhists, headed by
Thich Tri Quang, the “fighting monk”
who was the political brain of the
rebellion in Central Vietnam in the
spring of last year, are opposed to any
military candidacy.
But the Buddhists have not yet re-
covered from their defeat last June. The
Vien Hoa Dao (the Institute for the
Propagation of the Buddhist Faith),
which devoted all its efforts to the
overthrow of the military regime, has
n °w split into two factions: one follows
Thich Tam Chau and is not much op-
posed to the present regime; the second
is headed by Thich Tri Quang and
maintains strong influence in Central
Vietnam, but only limited influence in
Saigon.
It is said in Saigon that, in order
to defeat the military candidates, Thich
Tri Quang might order his followers
to vote for Tran Van Huong. Curiously
enough, Tran Van Huong, a Southerner
with a reputation for great personal
integrity who was Prime Minister from
October, 1964, to February, 1965, also
enjoys the support of a fair majority
of Catholic refugees from North Viet-
nam. But his chances against General
Nguyen Cao Ky—or General Nguyen
Van Thieu—remain limited, as there
will probably be at least ten candidates.

Taiwan
Sideline benefits
TAIWAN GOVERNMENT and busi-
ness circles expect the Hong Kong riot-
ing to persuade some Chinese business-
men to move their plants to Taiwan.
Small factories using light equipment
and with relatively small investment are
those most likely to come, officials
believe.
The Government has been urged to
simplify Taiwan entry requirements for
Hong Kong Chinese. Even Hong Kong
Chinese loyal to the Nationalist Govern-
ment have found it difficult to come
under the existing entry-exit procedures.
Except for those with a long record
of Kuomintang loyalty and support,
Overseas Chinese often experience long
waits even for permission to enter Tai-
wan for brief visits. Permission to estab-
lish permanent residence and operate
a business or factory is usually not
granted until after careful screening.
The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has called upon the Chinese
residents of the British Crown Colony
to co-operate with the Hong Kong
Government in maintaining law and
order. According to the Nationalist
Government, the Hong Kong violence
was communist-instigated for the pur-
pose of intimidating the Chinese people
there and increasing Peking’s control.
Behind the scenes, Nationalist leaders
fear communist pressures on Hong
Kong w'ill have results similar to those
in Macao. Pro-Peking rioting in the
Portuguese colony cut off, the refugee
flow and closed out Nationalist opera-
tions of long standing. Officially, the
Nationalists have no representation in
Hong Kong. Unofficially, they have rep-
resentatives at Government and busi-
ness levels. Although Great Britain rec-
ognises Peking, it maintains a consular
representation in Taiwan. The consulate
is accredited to the Taiwan Provincial
Government rather than the Nationalist
Republic.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The most beautiful music
By SANDRA HALL
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN who wears
a cowboy hat and lives in a caravan
for ten months of the year is making
more money out of the Australian
record industry than any mop-topped
teenager. Slim Dusty’s records are
virtually unheard on city radio stations,
nevertheless, EMI, the company which
has him under contract, call him their
most valuable piece of property.
Pop stars come and pop stars go,
but Australia’s leading country and
western artists seem to go on for ever.
When a pop record becomes a success
it sells from 30,000 copies upwards
soon after release, but it has a short
life. A country and western record is
likely to take five months to sell about
3500, but ten years later it may still
be selling consistently.
“At present there are 12 Slim Dusty
LPs available, eight extended plays,
and 63 singles,” EMI producer Eric
Dunn explained. “Compare that with
the sales of someone like Little Pattie.
She is one of our more successful pop
artists and at the moment you can
buy two of her LPs, two extended
plays, and six singles. There’s no great
variety of presentation in country and
western music, so the records are cheap
to produce. A month after release a
good record has paid for itself; after
that it is clear profit.”
From the point of view of the record
companies, there is yet another advant-
age: country and western artists pro-
mote themselves with their never-
ending country tours. Country radio
Slim Dusty... goes on for ever
stations devote a great deal of air time
to their records, so the artists make
sure they call at the local stations with
samples of their new releases.
Reg Lindsay, who has his own
national television program, which he
records in Adelaide, is the most urbane
of the country and western singers. Un-
like his brother-in-law, Slim Dusty,
whose policy is to record mainly Aus-
tralian songs, Lindsay leans to the
United States and the elaborations of
the Nashville sound.
He is a pleasant, hard-working man
who lives in a Sydney suburb with his
wife, also a country and western singer,
and their three daughters. Record
royalties, personal appearances, tele-
vision, radio, and a music publishing
business add up to a sizable income
and make Lindsay one of the only
artists who do not have to spend most
of the year touring.
But it wasn’t until two years ago,
when his children started growing up,
that he and his wife gave up full-time
touring. Touring, the way country and
western stars do it, means a fleet of
$5OOO caravans, big American cars to
match, and expensive amplification
equipment.
Lindsay and Slim Dusty are the
orthodox, businesslike men of country
and western. Tex Morton and Chad
Morgan are the individualists.
Morton is said to have originated
country and western music in Aus-
tralia in 1936, but has since digressed
a little to incorporate poetry reading,
Reg Lindsay... sophistication
hypnotism, trick shooting, and whin,
cracking into his act. F
“He’s making a record for us at
the moment,” Eric Dunn said. “I h ear
from him now and again. He rings m e
from a public phone box in some
country town, I hear the two bobs
clattering in, we talk about nothing in
particular for a while, then he says-
‘Oh, well, I’ll have to ring off, I’m out
of two bobs.’ So we say good-bye with-
out settling any of the things I wanted
to discuss with him.”
Chad Morgan, with his grotesque
buck teeth and cynical comedy routines,
represents the antithesis of the serious
sentimental Slim Dusty style. With a
strongly misogynist streak running
through all his songs, he seems to stand
for the tougher side of the Australian
tradition. Since the creation of his
first character, the Sheik of Scrubby
Creek, the same people crop up again
and again on all his records the
kiss-and-run lover, the nagging wife,
the boaster all adding up to his
central philosophy: “When you have
to choose between grog and sheilas,
grog comes first.”
Styles may differ, but the dedicated
country and western fans don’t dif-
ferentiate they buy them all. Ray
Brown, a Sydney traffic policeman who
writes a country and western column
for Nicholson’s magazine, “Music
Maker,” has 4500 records, many of
them imported from the United States,
His column, written in an appropri-
ately homespun style, is 10 years old
this year. He feels that he is typical of
most country and western fans. For
him, the story behind a song holds the
key to its appeal, and he unashamedly
names as his favorite a song about
moonlight and roses called “Waltz of
the Angels.”
“To me, that’s the most beautiful
music in the world,” he says of it. And
it seems there are a lot of people around
ready to spend money to prove they
agree with him.
"Boomerang" plans
By CHARLES HIGHAM
IT LOOKS NOW as though the film
of “Return of the Boomerang” will
definitely be made. The director, Lewis
Allen, told me before leaving for Lon-
don that this story of a convict who
obtains his freedom by marrying a
transportee girl is firmly scheduled fi> r
September production in Sydney.
Allen and Louis Edelman, the p r0 ‘
ducer, are very different kinds of film

inakers. Edelman began his career at
Warner Brothers in the 19305, making
films about social problems: fixed elec-
tions, prostitution traffic, and so on.
fie trained the late Jerry Wald, most
famous of Hollywood “wonder boys”
and the original of Sammy Glick in
Budd Schulberg’s “What Makes Sammy
Run.” “In those days there was a
different kind of story-telling,” Mr.
Edelman said. “Nowadays, speaking a
dirty word is a substitute for a plot.
At Warners we would spend hours in
the cutting room. The word given out
by the executive producer, Hal Wallis,
was ‘keep it moving’.” The purpose,
Edelman added, was to involve the
audience from the first scene and not
to let it go until the film was over—
a practice seldom followed today. “ ‘A
Man for All Seasons’, for instance.
Fred Zinnemann did a fine job of that.
But it wasn’t a movie. It was theatre.
So was ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?’ I used to go through pictures
cutting out the frames to make the
thing go. Now they let everything
drag.”
By contrast, Lewis Allen is a director,
trained in the theatre, whose very good
films have had a deliberately slow pace,
emphasising the minutiae of character
through the judicious use of close-ups.
On the stage in London and New York
he worked for the celebrated producer
Gilbert Miller and directed such stars
as Sybil Thorndike, Ralph Richardson,
Helen Hayes, and Eugenie Leontovich.
Alfred Lunt discovered him as a theatre
director, and later he went to Holly-
wood.
Later, Allen directed “So Evil My
Love,” a powerful murder story set in
London in 1866, based on a novel by
Joseph Shearing. This, like Allen’s
“Imperfect Lady,” showed a strong
period flair that, I suggested, had led
him to be attracted to the subject
of “The Return of the Boomerang,”
set in Sydney in the 1850 s. “Oh, yes.
I’m very interested in period furniture
and design. When I was making ‘So
Evil My Love’ I shot scenes at West-
minster Abbey at 6 o’clock in the morn-
ing with hansom cabs at special
angles so you couldn’t see the macadam
on the roads.
“Here I’ll have much the same prob-
lem. Old Sydney has been so mucked
up. As a matter of fact it’s very dis-
appointing how so much of it has been
let go. But I hope to bring Geoffrey
Unsworth, who’s a very good camera-
man, and we can shoot around the new
Sydney. I do like very much the Bond
stores in Argyle Street: Darlinghurst
Jail I like, too. School will be out in
November, so we can use it then. And
Government House, Victoria Barracks,
and the Garrison Church.
“Costumes will be made for us by the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust and designed
by Motley in London. I know the Mot-
leys well, so there will not be a problem
there. At present Alec Guinness, Lynn
Redgrave, and Rod Taylor are reading
scripts, and may possibly take the lead-
ing roles. I do not want a great big
thing. But a drama of character, with
an anti-hero, a kind of ‘Alfie’ person,
who uses an Irish girl to escape from
jail, but finally comes to love her w'hen
they are confronted with mutual prob-
lems on the land grant they are given.”
In recent years Allen has worked in
TV. His comment was succinct: “It is
certainly a prostitution of a director’s
talent. But at my age you get used to
being rich. You get $3OOO for two
weeks’ TV work and $2OOO in residuals.
So if you do ten a year you make an
income of $50,000. It’s a well-paid w ay
of making instant coffee, isn’t it?”
Art
Surrealism adrift
By ELWYN LYNN
Stanislaus Rapotec. David Jones’ Gal-
lery, Sydney.
Jeffrey Smart. Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney.
DISBAND THE ARMY! Open the
prisons! We are all at the mercy of
the dream! Beauty will be convulsive
or it won’t be at all! Lenin’s slogans
mixed with Surrealism’s? The latter’s
only, though in the early ’twenties they
were not so far apart and it may seem
that the coolly lit, still forms of Smart
and the tenebrist-baroque forms of
Rapotec are a long way from Sur-
realism, but in that theory and prac-
tice lie the origins of these two painters.
Smart, who has in Europe achieved a
new technical subtlety and quieter
menace, belongs to the isolators of
images that are both commonplace and
uncanny like those of Magritte and
Delvaux’s pale noctambulists, and
Rapotec to the spontaneous and auton-
omous gesturalists like Masson, his
heir, Pollock, and the New York School
that found, with the impact of refugee
Paris artists during the war, that the
unconscious was a better fount of in-
spiration than dull exercises in socialist
realism.
Surrealism has lasted because it has
a literature and a theory of art and
life, quite opposed to the unprogram-
med iconoclasm of Dada; its theorists
like Eluard, Aragon, Breton, and Dali
were aware of intellectual problems, as
no other modern movement has been,
and some flirted with Trotskyism and
tried to reconcile Freud and Marx.
(A photograph in Waldberg’s recent
“Surrealism” shows the eager, revolu-
tionary Breton with a homely Trostky.)
Surrealism has had a profound effect
upon the drama, though theorists of the
theatre of the absurd look back to
Jarry’s “Übu Roi” of 1896; it, and
Aragon and Breton’s play, “The Trea-
sures of the Jesuits,” irrupted conven-
tional situations with surreal irration-
ality a mixture to prevail in surreal
painting, poetry, and to continue in the
film imagery of producers like Bunuel,
an early Surrealist. The syntax is clear,
the meaning elusive in words like “Ah!
if bones were inflated like dirigibles
we would visit the shadows of the Dead
Sea,” and Smart’s clown on the soft
rocks of Dampier Land arouses uneasy
and unresolved conjectures.
Surrealism and its heir, action-paint-
ing, went round the world; Breton
would say that it’s surreal to have
Ichiro Fukuzana, at 68, a leading
Japanese Surrealist of the ’thirties, now
seeking subjects north of Alice Springs;
in Australia the direct influences per-
sist in Smart and James Gleeson, who
moved from early devotion to Dali to
surreal interpretations of myths and
allegories to Dominguez’s decalomania.
A way of making fantastic landscapes
by pressing or blotting fluid paint, de-
calomania retains some of Surrealism’s
automatism and unpredictability. Other
influences have been more devious.
Through the hallucinatory images of
Peter Purves Smith and the non-
horizons of Tanguy, Drysdale developed
his other-world landscapes; Arthur
Boyd’s bride, coffins, and flower-bearing
heads in the Half-Caste Bride series owe
as much to Surrealism as to Chagall
and Blackman’s Alice series, though
mainly concerned with English literary
fantasy, has a touch of Chirico’s pittura
metafsica. (All this is simply the way
art operates.) Tucker’s Images of
Modern Evil were the only consistently
surreal comments on society; Smart re-
tains some social comment with wizened
or pulpy flesh set against hard con-
crete, with the pulpiness taking on a
smooth, metallic polish.
Like the New Yorkers, Rapotec is not
passive, as the early Surrealists were,
before the autonomous unconscious
forces; like the romantics —and his re-
cent work is like a romantic Gothic Re-
vival —he believes that the painter is
the inspired servant of his art and that
his calligraphy records, like the tracings
of a seismograph, his experiences,
rhapsodies, and despair. How much
of the practice of the New Yorkers and
the early Surrealists —that painting is
an encounter with the canvas without
moral or aesthetic preoccupations —pre-
vails in Rapotec’s work is debatable.
The new rioting facades of Gothic
churches make his earlier work look
less abstract and more like blackened
palisades and the loose, dark blue, float-
ing works like sombre pools. Maybe
it is no accident that the subdued, ele-
gant environment of David Jones’ Gal-
lery reduces the rumbustious vigor of
Rapotec’s work and emphasises a pre-
meditation or habitual gestural mode
that was not so apparent in Rapotec’s
wild debut. Is a slight loss of nerve
accompanying the glowing mellowness?
Has his enthusiasm for old Europe in-
hibited abstract experiments? There
is some evidence that in this splendid
near-retrospective he is aware of this
with desperate works like Palestrina’s


Mass at St. Eustach and in the retar-
dataire, but highly successful, callig-
raphy, in Experience in Venice II.
If Rapotec is still dazzled by what
he calls the treasure-house of Europe,
Smart has been subdued by her soft
light; Surrealists have been inclined to
present their images in stark isolation
—a little like the Imagist poets —but
Smart, except where he places Cham-
berlain, umbrella and all, on a moor
with a satellite town growing nearby,
is allowing the strangeness of auto-
stradas, road signs, parking lots, hoard-
ings, and airports to creep on us un-
awares. Europe has smoothed some
of the rough edges of both these
painters, who should not, howevef,
ignore the virtues of their former
abrasiveness nor the well-springs of
Surrealism.
Music
Collier's return
By JOHN CARGHER
ABC Subscription Concerts. Soloist
Marie Collier; conductor, Willem van
Otterloo. Town Hall, Melbourne.
MARIE COLLIER’S return to Mel-
bourne proved to be quite a revela-
tion. The hard brittle brilliance
characterising her early work here has
given place to a beautifully modulated
technique spanning the whole range of
fine soprano singing. There was never
any doubt of the immense reserve of
unneeded power lying dormant dur-
ing Ravel’s “Scheherazade.” The sur-
prise lay in the warmth of her mezza
voce, which appears to be capable of
great interpretative feeling. Neverthe-
less, her assurance left a distinct feeling
of Alice in Wonderland determinedly
insisting that her bewildering sur-
roundings are normal. M. Ravel’s
music is not normal by operatic stand-
ards and French is not normal for
a non-linguist Australian. Miss Col-
lier’s appearance before Montreal’s
French audiences will not aid her
artistic future, but her offering in Mel-
bourne raises great hopes indeed for
her return next year in grand opera.
The program I heard also featured
a performance of Mozart’s Sinfonia
Concertante in E flat which nearly put
me to sleep, in spite of the brilliant
work of the four soloists, Jiri Tanci-
budek, Phillip Miechel, Jos de Groen,
and Roy White. The fault lay with
Willem van Otterloo and the bath-
room acoustics of the Melbourne Town
Hall. However, Otterloo was far from
sleepy in the opening item, Peter Scul-
thorpe’s “Sun Music IV.” Sculthorpe
seems the only genuinely original tal-
ent in Australian music. The ques-
tion is whether he has not by now
explored all that can be explored in
his method of sound picture painting.
Sculthorpe has turned the full
circle; the electronic music-makers
who sought to emulate musical instru-
ments by artificial means are now faced
with a full symphony orchestra pro-
ducing sounds imitative of electronic
effects. The composer’s idea of “aver-
aging” a sound cluster works sur-
prisingly well. Presumably the limita-
tions of human and instrumental
resources cannot fail to achieve the
result he is trying to attain when he
gives directions not based on individual
written notes. This must come as a
surprise to the composers of 12-tone
music who have tried to leave con-
ventional harmonies by unconventional,
but far too rigid, methods. Their music
is admired by musicologists and musi-
cians, yet it has failed to attract the
public at large after 40-odd years of
work by the world’s leading composers.
Sculthorpe’s methods may be hap-
hazard by their standards; the results
he produces are not. There is a
natural flow of sound, even melody at
times, which is readily acceptable to
the average ear. If fault must be
found, it is only in that Sculthorpe’s
impressionistic outpourings (post-
impressionistic, he insists) have no be-
ginning, middle or ending. I am old-
fashioned enough to believe that no-
thing is complete until it ends. If
Sculthorpe can produce a frame for
his paintings, he may yet become an
old master.
Fine precision
By DAVID SALTER
Fine Arts Quartet with David Glazer,
clarinet. Science Theatre, University
of N.S.W.
THE ONE TRULY non-student
program within the First Australian
Universities’ Arts Festival was given by
the Fine Arts Quartet. With clarinettist
David Glazer, the group is making a
tour of the Asian and Pacific areas for
the U.S. State Department. This unfor-
tunately is a diplomatic euphemism for
weeks of gruelling one-night stands.
The Fine Arts and Mr. Glazer cham-
pion a strict and, in their peculiar cir-
cumstance, secure approach to the
entirety of their repertoire. Precision,
precision, polish, and more precision
were the obvious goals to which the
limited rehearsal time had been allotted.
The perfect rapport and technique of
the ensemble are admittedly a joy, but
one would also have liked to hear a
little more vigor and interpretative
interest in the works presented.
True, the Quartet for Violin, Viola,
Cello, and Clarinet by the American
contemporary Boatwright had little to
recommended itself in the way of musi-
cal interest: Mozart and Beethoven offer
considerably more. It was only in the
celebrated “middle period” E minor
Quartet of Beethoven that the Fine Arts
overcame their passion for mathematical
precision to produce a heartfelt and
therefore naturally moving perform-
ance. The Mozart Clarinet Quintet
although once again faultlessly played’
lacked that elusive sparkle which lifts it
to a plane above that of the legion other
works of similar idiom and period.

Taste or flavor?
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Bible ... In The Beginning. Direc-
tor, John Huston.
Southwest To Sonora. Director, Sidney
J. Furie.
My childhood’s rather haphazard re-
ligious training meant that I never
attended Sunday School except on
rare occasions when I was staying with
friends and was taken along by the
children of the family. The only ob-
servance that left a lasting impression
was that regular patrons were given
a little Biblical picture, in bright colors
and with serrated edges like a postage
stamp. These were a sort of badge of
attendance, and as a visiting member
I never got one. This annoyed me and
has done so for many years.
But no longer. For with John Hus-
ton’s film I got my lot all in one go.
Certainly the color was more sophisti-
cated—in fact, it is often extremely
subtle—and the serrated edges (though
no doubt there for the sprockets)
weren’t visible. But this is every Bibli-
cal picture-book sequence wrapped up
together and put on a wide screen with
full sound effects. And it only covers
the book of Genesis, not even quite all
of that! Think what we Sunday School
drop-outs have to look forward to
Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy!
In his literal, picture-book screen ver-
sion of the Creation, John Huston is
determinedly reverent and tactful. Not
for him the extravagant excesses of
tastelessness of De Mille. Even the
orgies of the Cities of the Plain are so
discreetly photographed as to be almost
in total darkness.
Were Sodom and Gomorrah really
destroyed by the world’s first atomic
blast? They are, in the Scriptures ac-
cording to Huston. The dialogue is a
watered-down King James’ Version,
heavily loaded with “thous” and “yea
verilys.” The movie will certainly offend
nobody, but it probably won’t excite
anyone much, either: its extreme re-
finement leads to lack of vitality and
vigor. It may be tasteful but has little
flavor.
The liveliest sequences are those of
the Flood, with Huston himself playing
Noah as a bumbling, knockabout comic
who seems to be under the weather in
more than one sense; not a very Bibli-
cal interpretation perhaps, but divert-
ing. George C. Scott and Ava Gard-
ner manage to invest their overlong
scenes with surprising dignity; Peter

O’Toole turns up as a kind of quick
change artist as the Angel of the Lord.
We are always being told that the
Western has grown up. Unfortunately,
it is often filled with the pompous self-
importance of the adolescent who has
just discovered the world and thinks
he invented it. Actually, “Southwest to
Sonora” isn’t as bad as that sounds: it
has a simple, straightforward story-
line and in Marlon Brando a star who
refuses to be overawed by any “impli-
cations” in the role he plays.
Brando gives an understated and
straightforward performance as a
drifter who returns to his home on
the Mexican border determined to settle
down, only to have his one asset
an Appaloosa stallion—stolen and taken
into Mexico. The story of his recovery
of the horse is simple but constantly
interesting, despite Furie’s attempts to
muddle it by directorial stylishness,
which involves great use of shadows,
silhouettes, portentously clouded skies,
and pregnant silences.
Television
Sad parting
By FRANK ROBERTS
Till Death Us Do Part. Channel 2,
ABC-TV.
IN BRITAIN the BBC show “Till
Death Us Do Part” won the Screen-
writers’ Guild top award (a ZITA,
standing for zest, integrity, technique,
and ability) for 1966’s best British
comedy series, and if local TV critics’
initial unreserved praise for it lasts, it
is sure to win some awards here. And
I think this will leave the average Aus-
tralian viewer more puzzled than usual.
What is so funny about a baldheaded
London East Ender who spends half an
hour each week fighting with his family
about British customs, politics, and
politicians?
This is where “The End of the
Affair,” the final break in our interest
in matters British, could become
apparent to all Australian viewers. The
question is whether Australians will find
wild hilarity in Alf Garnett’s slangy
references to Wilson, Heath, Charley
Warren Mitchell as the Cockney Alf
Garnett in ABC-TV’s series “Till Death
Us Do Part”
de Gaulle and other figures secure in
the British consciousness, even with a
few bloodys and worse thrown in? I
think, not for long.
“Till Death” began, like “Steptoe,”
as a half-hour episode in the “Comedy
Playhouse” series, and was expanded
to a series by Johnny Speight who used
to write for Eric Sykes and Hattie
Jacques, and for the late Arthur
Haynes. His present show began last
year in Britain, and his creation, Alf
Garnett (played by Warren Mitchell)
seems to provide British humor on
three levels.
Firstly, the character Garnett
expresses the humor of the ways and
feelings of London’s East End—and no
doubt accurately because writer Speight
began there. Alf Garnett is known
even more intimately to Londoners
than the Mo McCackies of our world
were known to us in Roy Rene’s time,
and it is understandable that Alf’s
favorite expression, “You silly old moo”
has become something of a national
catch-cry, just as some of Mo’s did
here. But it follows that Alf is likely
to seem as alien and unfunny to Aus-
tralians as Mo would have to Lon-
doners.
On a second level, and even more
alien, are Garnett’s political references,
which few of us would comprehend,
any more than a “Mavis Bramston”
sketch about Harold and Zara would
convulse the British.
On the third level, “Till Death’s”
characters have “looking down” appeal
in their favor. They are a scruffy,
snarling, hard-swearing and slangy lot,
in whose antics one can be amused, just
as watching the monkeys at the Zoo can
be amusing, I suppose. Much comedy
subsists on our thankfulness that life
isn’t like that for us. But again I feel
that “Mavis” in its better moments will
have taken much of the shock value
from Alf Garnett’s lewd words and
sometimes lewder attitudes to life.
There have been few British humor
shows in recent years that I failed to
find comical, but “Till Death Us Do
Part” has my reaction built in. I’ VP
parted, on this one.
Theatre
Off-target
By ROBERT WARD
An Enemy of the People. Ibsen. Wil-
lard Hall, Adelaide.
lolanthe. Gilbert and Sullivan. ATC
Theatre, Adelaide.
DR. THOMAS STOCKMAN is the
enemy of a self-righteous, ignorant,
hypercritical community. He is with-
out guile and naively imagines his
community to be similarly disposed.
He asks it to accept a harsh truth and
to act with integrity. The drama occurs
when it doesn’t. The town turns against
him and the audience watches his
pathetic and ingenuous attempts to cope
with its treachery. The play could be
a harrowing experience for a receptive
audience, for the man is so clearly a
kind of archetypal victim, and all
things conspire to defeat him.
Robert Kimber’s direction of this
play misses the point completely. I
wondered for a time whether, in fact,
he was sending it up. He has made
his Stockman a kind of idealistic buf-
foon who plays for bitter-sweet laughter
and is surrounded by an indulgent
family. The family should not indulge;
they should be bitterly involved. At the
end, instead of a sweet tableau, Stock-
man should be terribly alone.
Overall, the acting has plenty of
pace, and there is a very good Aslaksen
from Jim Morrissey, who plays “the
leader of the lower middle classes” with
unctuous two-facedness.
The play was written in 1882, and
for the design, this should have been
the starting point. The program points
out that for reasons of space, the set-
ting is a compromise. It certainly is.
It is an amalgam of Edwardiana, blue
and white perspectives of doors, decora-
tive ropes, and red and green abstract
canvas shapes, all more suited to Godot
than Ibsen.
“lolanthe” was also written in 1882,
and is, of course, about fairies and
peers. It’s nice to see again how gently
Victorian England laughed at itself,
and to realise that at the same time
Ibsen was wearing himself out worry-
ing about Norway and life. This pro-
duction by the Gilbert and Sullivan
Society is a straightforward one: chorus
in half-circle or at the sides, leads in
the centre, conventional Savoy scenery,
and actually very good costumes. The
fairies enter singing “tripping hither,
tripping thither,” and they very
buxomly do so; the Peers by comparison
are positively ascetic. There is a superb
Lord Chancellor in the person of
Brian Moore.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Away with the mini-recession
STATISTICS, Ben Chifley used to say in an old phrase
worth reviving, are like a loose woman: once they are down
you can get what you want out of them._ National accounts
statistics for the first three months of the year show a
remarkable resurgence of economic activity from last year’s
mini-recession. TTiey may overstate achievements somewhat,
but are still exciting. National production surged up just
about five percent in the March quarter on the past three
months of 1966. This is often regarded as a good annual
rate of growth. About a third of the reason for the up-
swing was the great recovery in farm income as the largest-
ever wheat harvest continued to flow into silos and open
stacks.
The rest of the rise in economic output accrued fairly
equally to wage-earners and business. Wage earnings rose
about three percent by a combination of extra overtime, the
follow-through of higher basic wage and interim margins,
plus a strong surge in employment. Business seems to have
absorbed higher costs through a big increase in turnovers.
Sales of electrical and other household gadgetry have been
remarkably strong this year following the Christmas sea-
sonal boom; car sales are strong and consumer spending
generally is expanding more healthily than for eighteen
months. One of the main reasons for all this is the de-
layed expansionary effect of the last Budget. Public authori-
ties’ spending is up 16 percent on the same quarter last year,
cash social service benefits have suddenly shot up. Defence
spending, which generally falls off in the March quarter
each year, has been maintained for some reason and this is
having a big stimulatory effect. With consumer and Govern-
ment spending on the up, there are signs of purchases of
stocks having a strong secondary effect on activity. With
credit relatively easy, housebuilding has surged to the levels
of the 1965 boom.
Weak.spots persist, of course business expenditure on
plant and equipment, for instance—but even they are not
as weak as most commentators considered. A figure of
s47om. for the quarter is not seriously down when it is
remembered that the boom 1965 level was in the sslom.
to ss2om. range. The recent recovery in factory and shop
construction suggests there will soon be new orders for the
plant to fill them. And so far this renewed burst of pros-
perity has been achieved without any pressure on Labor
resources. Slack which existed last year is being taken up.
Good things cannot go on for ever. Several difficulties
could arise. One is a wage-price spiral set off by an increase
in the basic wage in excess of productivity growth; a second

MEN AND MATTERS
BEING a director of the MLC is not
nearly so hazardous a task these days
as in the peak of the H. G. Palmer
furore. Last week’s annual meeting
was a very sedate affair; all that hap-
pened was that a shareholder opposed
the re-election of three directors. Very
tame stuff.
The shareholder, Mr. Tony Hum-
phrey, a former field representative of
the Mutual Life and Citizens Assur-
ance Co., opposed (unsuccessfully) the
re-election of Sir Frank Berryman, Dr.
J. L. Dowling, and Mr. Hubert
Vaughan on the grounds that, although
they had high qualifications, the
board should include directors with
experience in the promotion of life
assurance. There are no life assurance
salesmen on the board, and the chair-
man, Mr. J. H. Ashton, said the main
value of a director was in assisting in
the investment of funds for the bene-
fit of policyholders.
Well, who are these people who
help guide the investment policy?
They are a well-diversified band of
a grazier, an actuary, a soldier, a doc-
tor, an engineer, a lawyer, a textiler
an d accountant, and the general
manager (who has such impressive
qualifications as BA, LIB, BEc).
After the H. G. Palmer debacle, it is
notable that the directors wasted little
time in keeping up their accountant
membership after
the death of the
late Mr. R. N.
C a d wa 11 ader.
They have ap-
pointed Mr. Ken-
neth Wood, senior
partner of Cooper
Bros, in Sydney.
Sir Frank Berry-
man, the former
soldier, also sits
on Alliance Hold-
ings (which is as-
sociated with the
MLC through a hefty shareholding),
AWA, and the Sir Robert Webster
double of Bradford Cotton and Felt
and Textiles.
Sir James Kirby, the well-known in-
dustrialist, has several board seats out-
side his own group.
And Mr. A. F. Deer is the general
manager.
HOLMAN BROS., whose name has
been a byword in Australian mining
camps these many years, recently com-
pleted a new factory to make its
mining equipment at Mt. Waverley and
41-year-old Cornishman Paul Holman
has arrived in Melbourne to be its
managing director. The brothers con-
cerned were his grandfather and grand-
uncle, who started the firm at Cam-

Sir F. Berryman
borne in Cornwall in 1801. The new
factory, which employs 125 Australians,
will mean we’ll now be making its
products here instead of importing
them.
Paul Holman is a postwar engineer-
ing industry product with a difference.
He went into the Royal Navy when
still in his teens and after four years’
service left to go to Queen’s Univer-
sity in Canada before joining the family
firm, where he’s been production direc-
tor at Camborne for the last seventeen
years, in fact, from the early age of
24. He should be a good man for our
productivity groups to get in because,
among his engineering institution in-
terests in the U.K., he leaves behind
the chairmanship of the Cornwall
Productivity Association.


is balance-of-payments difficulties. Next financial year sees
a $150m. increase in imports of defence equipment, plus the
prospect of considerable rises in general imports due to the
all round recovery in the domestic economy. But solid rains
in Victoria and N.S.W. within a month should set the ground
for a wheat crop even larger than last year’s. In Canberra,
some people are speaking of a 625 million bushel harvest
(this year’s record was 430m.), and northern minerals
should be flowing out more quickly, adding substantially to
export earnings. Our manufacturers are pretty hopeless if
they cannot take advantage of the Kennedy Round tariff
cuts to step up their overseas sales.
Lessons from Sweden
SOCIAL REFORMERS often take Sweden as their model
country, where education and social justice and the attention
to cultural matters are worthy of emulation. It is also worth
looking at for the economic lessons it holds. In population
size Sweden is similar to us, in the export of raw materials,
too. But in per capita income and general prosperity it does
far better. Much of this is due to its impressive industrial
and export performance. Last year its exports were around
$5 billion to our $3 billion. The growth rate is even more
impressive. Manufactured exports, in 1960 $1600m., have
more than doubled this decade to over $3300m.; those going
to tough markets like the U.S., Japan, and France increasing
proportionately more.
The source of this extraordinary economic energy is not
easy to define, but certain features stand out. One is on
intensely competitive approach to world trade. Sweden has
virtually no tariffs left after the Kennedy Round and its
economy is, therefore, actively oriented to selling in a world
market. By specialising in fields in which it has technological
advantage and making sure it maintains that advantage by
spending money on training and research, it has been able
to take advantage of the economies of scale of the world
market.
Its latest Budget provides for an “industrial policy fund”
whose purpose is to “facilitate the structural rationalisation
of Swedish industry which technological progress, changes
in demand, and growing labor costs make necessary.” In
other words, the Government is to help Swedish industrialists
get off the mark first with new products.
A real capital hunger
WHAT THE INSTITUTE of Public Affairs had to say last
week about Australia being a capital-hungry country is only
too true, but then it is hard to think up a country that
isn’t. We are only unique in that we have a whole con-
tinent to develop single-handed and, as the Institute rightly
says, we need all the outside help we can get; to which may
be added the rider, so long as the helpers don’t try to take
us over. It is also true that Australians have never been
keener than any other free people on the idea of sacrificing
their personal consumption to fill the capital gap. Nor
have they been exactly encouraged by Federal Governments.
Like a lot of other refined observers, the IPA damns the
Bankers’ Development Refinance Corporation with faint
praise, mainly because it can’t see it reducing the need for
as much overseas capital as we can muster, nor, for that
matter, adding to the pool of local capital. The latter is
following the line of the institutions too closely. The emphasis
on the corporation’s potential usefulness should be put
heavily, not lightly, on its potential as a marshalling force
of local capital for channelling into projects which would
otherwise fall into the hands of foreigners. It is primarily
an essay in co-operative private finance with Reserve Bank
backing, and given the right start and not a “play down”
of the IPA sort it will stand a very good chance of bringing
more local and perhaps overseas capital for development.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Dr. A. R. Hall, of the Aus-
tralian National University, suggests “moderate” but
prompt official action to help the rate of growth of
exports keep above the rate of growth of imports over
the next few years.
In the March quarter, gross national product showed
a 13 percent gain on the corresponding 1966 period- a
45 percent lift in farm income provided the strongest
fillip.
April’s retail sales, at $561.9m., contrasted with
$573.3m. in March, to give the first March-April decline
since 1962.
The trading banks increased their lending commit-
ments by an average $35.9m. during May, to compare
with April’s $35.2m.; overdraft limits moved from
$402 lm. to $4448m.
For the markets: Mining issues shed some of
their lustre in last week’s Australian share markets.
Industrials still look very tame and are not aided by
easing leaders.
International worries brought some restraint, and
backsliding, to London, although selling was relatively
small . . . Wall Street met its usual profit-taking, which
spread to glamor issues.
For companies: Metals still beat the big drum,
although a trifle more variably . . . An alumina re-
finery at Weipa is once more in Comalco’s mind; a
firm decision has already been taken for a plant to
make, calcined bauxite for export . . . CRA’s Zinc Cor-
poration earned 34 percent less, at $4,190,277, in 1966
. . . Joint exploration in the north (Western Australia,
Northern Territory, and Queensland) will be undertaken
by E. Z. Industries and Peko-Wallsend Investments;
Peko’s Tennant Creek leases are excluded . . . Favor-
able tin grades have been found at two of Loloma’s
Irvinebank (Northern Queensland) leases, yet still in-
sufficient to embark upon a treatment plant; Loloma
has cut its interim from 4 to 3 cents a 20 cent share
. ... Feverish share trading induced Great Boulder Gold
Mines to advise there “has been no nickel strike” on
the Hampton Plains.
Imports competition struck Australian Petrochemicals,
whose 1966 profit, slipped from $282,782 to $218,317
. . . Dow Chemical (Australia) proposes to build a
styrene/butadene latex plant at a cost of about $3m.
Woolworths undoubtedly led in the retailers with
great assurance; its purchase of six stores from Cox
Bros.’ receiver includes the Foy and Gibson Bourke St.,
Melbourne, shop. The deal is effective from midnight,
July 31 . . . Cox Bros, itself lost a further $826,086
for the half-year to January and is also burdened with
$1,008,948 extra tax . . . Not so assured is Mark Foy’s,
which has sold a mid-city (Sydney) property for
$600,000; proceeds will repay preference capital.
Current earnings for the British Tobacco complex are
much in line with last year’s, but the tobacco sub-
sidiary trades “buoyantly” . . . Cigarette maker Gallaher
International (Australia) suffered a $61,971 loss in
1966, against 1965’s $105,088; local operations began in
September, 1965.
Surprisingly restrained, the takeover field sprouted
one rejection: directors of spring maker Pioneer Indus-
tries spurned H. K. Porter Australia Pty. and told
their shareholders to do the same . . . Mr. N. N.
Robertson, chairman of MacRobertson (Aust), fur-
nished no direction on the Mars, U.S., bid to his
annual meeting.
Improving, Goodyear Tyre (Australia) pushed earn-
ings to $780,618, without any tax, in 1966 (previous
year $732,296), rather grim beside 1964’s $3,086,508
. . . United Empire Box earned a record $821,514 to
March, proposes a one-for-five bonus and an unsecured
note issue, and has made another textile takeover.

Back to basics
N.Z. staves off devaluation
By CROESUS
MAY WASN’T exactly the merriest of
months for the New Zealand economy,
and with another budget coming up in
a few weeks’ time the ■ main thought
over there is about what other measures
the Government is cooking up to get
the country back on the rails of exter-
nal viability. It is anybody’s guess, but
conceivably the next step will have to
be a measure of devaluation, taking
the form perhaps of a tax on purchases
of foreign exchange rather than a
straight-out cut in the parity of the
official exchange rate. The former is
about the only one of the recommen-
dations of the Economic and Monetary
Council made in January that the Gov-
ernment has not yet implemented in
some shape or form. From long-stand-
ing stubbornness in failing to recognise
that the currency is overvalued, it is
still highly doubtful whether it would
go so far.
Of course, it may be forced to do so
in the not-too-distant future, simply be-
Prime Minister Holyoake in the soup
cause it has just about run out of over-
seas lenders. True, it can still draw
approximately $lOO million from the
IMF, even after taking into account
the $29.5 million drawing from there
last month (some of which was in
Australian currency). But the IMF
authorities would obviously have to talk
very seriously with Mr. Holyoake before
letting him have that much. Consider-
lng N.Z.’s early reluctance to join the
IMF at all it is ironical that this is
about the only channel left to the
country to stave off devaluation. Over
4e past year, N.Z. has borrowed heavily
hom practically every possible overseas
source including, recently, the Bank of
International Settlements. If it cannot
§ e t another nod from the IMF, these
other sourses of borrowing are hardly
likely to be at all enthusiastic about
lending more.
If the N.Z. Government is running
out of overseas lenders, it also looks
to be running out of time to avert a
devaluation. Although it has taken a
further series of steps in recent weeks
to dampen internal activity and narrow
the trade gap, these really don’t amount
to a crash program needed to correct
the imbalance in its overseas position
in time, despite the agonies expressed
by the population at last month’s mini-
Budget. The latter followed up the
February dose which removed consumer
subsidies and increased Government
charges with an across-the-board rise in
indirect taxes. The retreat toward the
siege economy was also speeded by
another 20 percent cut in imports
(effective from next month) and a re-
duction of 10 percent in overdraft
limits as from October—all to the tune
of the new Minister of Finance, Mr.
Muldoon, saying that if all that doesn’t
do the trick of turning the balance-of-
payments tide “we would be forced into
excessive reliance on direct controls.”
Notice that the Treasurer is not look-
ing for a way out via economic libera-
tion, but rather to a tighter strait-
jacket. No recognition at all that con-
ceivably the chronic balance-of-pay-
ments difficulties besetting the N.Z.
economy for so many years, and which
have come to their nastiest head of all
time this last six months, spring from
structural distortions perpetuated by
stringent exchange and import controls.
Nor would it appear that the N.Z.
Government has the slightest intention
of trying the liberation route until it
is forced to. Far from anticipating
when that might be, it has shut its eyes
to the possibility, made its time-honored
domestic restraining moves, and kept its
fingers crossed that something will turn
up for the balance of payments.
The latest batch of belt-tightening
measures are in the pattern well estab-
lished by this and other postwar N.Z.
Governments and so deserve no special
comment in themselves, except that this
time they catch the economy further
out on the limb of over-extended
activity than admits an orderly re-
treat. With all likely avenues of overseas
borrowing practically exhausted from
now on, it will be increasingly difficult,
if not impossible, for full employment
and national economic expansion to be
sustained on the basis of overseas capi-
tal and credit. The economy has been
forced back to basics. Unless exports
pick up quite quickly, N.Z.’s much-
prized rate of economic development

will have to be sacrificed. A slowing
down of industrial and public works
expansion looks pretty well inevitable in
any case. .
The N.Z. Government would seem to
be still laboring under the illusion that
the problems are short-term ones and
improvisations will solve them. I n this
spirit it has cut back the growth in its
own expenditure to about the 4-5 per-
cent a year from more than a 10 per-
cent rate of increase last year oefore
the Economic and Monetary Council
warned it would have to go on a much
reduced diet, suggesting, in fact, that
a more appropriate growth rate in
Government outlays would be 3 per-
cent or even less. This has meant that
some public works have been retarded
and the heightening effect of spend-
ing on internal demand along this
avenue has been somewhat softened.
Against that, some capital projects like
the extensions to the Auckland har-
bor bridge and the Turangi power
station, which one would have thought
could have been delayed in present
circumstances, have been allowed to
proceed on the basis of overseas finance
in these cases Japanese and Italian.
When considering the country’s para-
mount task of cutting back effective
demand in general, such public-
authority capital spending cannot be
taken in isolation to spending via the
Budget. To let it to run on unbridled
would simply offset the deflationary
intentions written into the Budget.
However, looking at the prospect for
the Budget later this month, at this
stage, and without considering any
further economies the Government may
propose on the basis that projected ex-
penditure looks likely to be about
$A1375 million and revenue of the
order of SAISOO million, there could
well be a surplus of SAI2S million in
the estimates for the year. Provided this
SAI2S million was “frozen,” so to
speak, and not re-spent by the Govern-
ment, it would represent a considerable
bite at the surplus of effective demand,
though N.Z. economists don’t seem all
that confident that the Government can
be relied on to keep it out of circula-
tion.
Assuming, as I fear one must, that
overseas capital and credit are not
going to cure the imbalance in N.Z. s
external position and that the latest
cuts in imports and the package of re-
straints on the domestic front will take
too long to influence the external
accounts, the one route open for the
miracle to happen would be on the
export front. There, unfortunately,
although N.Z. is making heroic efforts
to increase its income from manufac-
tured imports and tourism, and is gain-
ing new outlets for some of its ruial
export earners, there is no sign of any
sufficient increase in its export prices
for a quick solution in that direction.

Aluminium rampant
What Weipa means for CRA
By the FINANCE EDITOR
THERE IS MAJOR stockmarket sig-
nificance for the CRA group in what
went on at Weipa last weekend, when
Comalco’s $ll million addition to its
bauxite plant was officially opened.
With all the talk about nickel, copper,
iron ore, and so on, the market seems
to have forgotten that one of the
brightest prospects for Conzinc Riotinto
of Australia is its half interest with
Kaiser in Comalco, the integrated
bauxite-alumina-aluminium complex.
This Weipa bauxite operation alone
is potentially a major profit earner for
the CRA group; although bauxite min-
ing would have earned Comalco less
than $J million in 1965 and prob-
ably only about SIJ million last year
(out of Comalco’s group profit of $4.3
million from its alumina-aluminium
interests), this year’s rapidly increased
bauxite production rate of 2\ million
tons (compared with less than”one mil-
lion last year) should lift bauxite
profits alone up to the $5 million mark.
And by 1970, when Weipa should be
selling bauxite at least at the rate of
4 million tons a year, profits should
reach a minimum of $l2 million after
hefty depreciation and costs, and pos-
sibly several million more. CRA is
entitled to half of that profit, and so
the impact on CRA earnings (last year
$l4 million) of an additional S2J mil-
lion this year, and $6 million in 1970,
is really significant. And all this will,
of course, be taking place while other
massive additions to the group’s profit-
ability are made from its other glamor
metals (and possibly uranium by then,
too).
There are also major implications in
the suggestion made at Weipa last
weekend by Comalco managing direc-
tor D. J. Hibberd that Comalco was
again considering putting up an alumina
refinery at Weipa when the Gladstone
refinery is expanded to its ultimate eco-
nomic level of 1.8 million tons a year
(“It should not be too long,” Mr.
Hibberd said, pointing out that the
Gladstone works that had come fully
on stream at 600,000 tons, only in
April, was now being 50 percent ex-
panded to 900,000 tons).
Saying that Comalco had “kept in
mind the prime objective of establishing
an alumina refinery” at Weipa, he
added: “We can start to think again
about alumina refining from quite
changed assumptions. Weipa, with its
established port and harbor facilities,
community amenities, and improved
communications, now provides an
economic base on which to establish
industrial processing.”
But who is the “we” Mr. Hibberd
talks about? Is it the Gladstone
Alumina consortium of 52 percent
Kaiser, 20 percent Alcan, 20 percent
Pechiney, and only eight percent CRA?
Or does CRA feel strong enough to
plump for a direct 50-50 split with
Kaiser, so that it becomes a Comalco
affair pure and simple? This would
mean that the Comalco partners would
get all the economic advantages (par-
ticularly transport) that should flow
from having a refinery right on the
mining site. And if Comalco is really
going ahead with the N.Z. hydro pro-
posals for a large-scale aluminium
smelter, then it may well be able to
take 50 percent of the output of any
prospective Weipa refinery within 10
years.
The cash flow that Comalco could
generate from its bauxite operations
Stockpiled bauxite at Weipa
alone by the early 1970s could go a lot
of the way toward providing finance
for an initial 600,000 ton refinery at
Weipa, even though it may cost a bit
more to install there than the $120 mil-
lion at Gladstone. And there is always
the prospect that the Australian public
may like to participate in the equity
of such a proposition. The magnitude
of the bauxite potential is even more
overwhelming than the iron ore develop-
ments, although the present Weipa min-
ing scheme is far smaller than the big
iron ore ones.
Weipa contains the best and largest
known deposit of commercial grade
and easily mined and transported
bauxite in the world, comprising
20 percent of the Western world’s re-

The BOAC armchair.
Built to keep an executive
sweet.
Did you hear the one about the travelling salesman?
Seems he was a high-pressure salesman (no reflection
on his selling approach). It was just that all the un-
comfortable travelling was getting him steamed up.
Cramped, badly shaped airline seats were his lot.
So he went along to a BO AC Travel Agent who told
him all about the BOAC armchair. How it was de-
signed to fit him. Not for him to fit the seat. And how
medical men and scientists and engineers all got to-
gether to make the world’s first personal-fit economy
class airline seat with moulded body shells and special
padding that gives more room and more sleep and
everything.
And how on top of that it didn’t cost any more to
fly BOAC and that they flew everywhere from Aus-
tralia; West via India and East via the U.S.A.
Anyway, as it turned out, he was sold on the idea.
Now he’s a low-pressure salesman.

ser ves. It holds at least 2000 million
tons, of which 516 million tons has been
closely proved and another 1700 million
tons has been disclosed by scout drilling,
current rates of usage, it would take
1000 years to work out. Last year
the company mined only 900,000 tons
of bauxite (worth about s4| million)
a nd this year it has lifted the rate to
2 i million tons a year (worth about
$l2 million). By the early 1970 s it
will be at least up to the 4 million
tons a year mark (about $2O million
worth).
The biggest single customer of
Weipa is Queensland Alumina, which
operates the newly completed 600,000-
ton refinery at Gladstone and which
is committed to take 1.3 million tons
of Weipa bauxite a year for the next
25 years. And already Gladstone is
to increase its capacity by 50 percent,
so Weipa will soon be called on for a
further 650,000 tons of bauxite a year,
to a total of almost 2 million tons
yearly. About 130,000 tons a year goes
to Comalco’s small refinery at Bell
Bay, where it goes part of the way to
providing the alumina for the 70,000-
ton aluminium smelter there. (It takes
about four tons of Weipa bauxite to
make a ton of aluminium, but the
process is first to make alumina,
involving refining it to about half its
bulk, and then to smelt it, which takes
enormous amounts of electric power.)
The Japanese have long-term con-
tracts for ten million tons over ten
years, averaging one million tons yearly
with options for increasing it. And cus-
tomers in Germany and France have
contracted to buy between half and
three-quarter million tons a year. There
are also reports that big contracts are
soon to be negotiated to supply millions
of tons of bauxite to leading U.S.
aluminium companies.
Last year, Comalco did not really
do much for the CRA group, as it
made up 13.6 percent of the group
assets and provided only 9.9 percent of
the. profits. The semi-fabricated pro-
ducts operation suffered a $£ million
profit fall and it was only the $f mil-
lion profit rise from Bell Bay, up to
$2.7 million, and the bauxite profits of
$1.3 million (up almost $1 million) from
Commonwealth Aluminium Corpora-
tion that brought the group ahead for
the year. In addition to the big profit
rises from bauxite this year, Comalco
will have its eight percent stake in the
$l2O million Gladstone refinery, which
is soon to have another $6O million
spent on it, returning some profits.
While on the aluminium bandwag-
gon, the large additions to Bell Bay’s
aluminium smelter capacity this year
will lift it to 70,000 tons. Despite the
prospect of a competitive Alcan
smelter starting up in Newcastle, the
prospects are that another 20,000 tons
capacity should be added at Bell Bay
within the next few years.

Double bottoms
to make a
half-chartist
THIS WEEK I have been educated,
if that’s the correct word to use. 1
have learnt not only what “double
bottoms,” “head and shoulders,” and
“long saucer tops” look like (and it's
probably not what you’re thinking) but
what they mean. They look like some
sort of contemporary art display; they
are in fact (if you look closely enough)
the plotted movements of a company’s
share price. They mean, provided you
are willing to accept my teacher’s ex-
planation, that the particular company’s
share price is just about to react in
a certain way. My teacher is a chartist,
and a passionate one at that.
Unluckily for me I was not able to
grasp some of the finer details in-
volved (perhaps more perseverance
and earnestness is required) and I hold
out little hope of being able to retire
with my fortune before Christmas. I
will quickly add, however, that I am
convinced that much more attention
than is now the case should be paid to
movements in share prices. It is most
important for any investor to know' if
the price of the share in wdiich he is
dealing is moving upwards, downwards,
sideways, or not at all. I feel, how-
ever, that these movements should be
viewed in the light of, and jointly wdth,
other more basic investment fundamen-
tals. The last statement is where the
true-blue chartist will disagree with
me. To him the price is everything—
nothing else counts. I guess my thinking
classifies me as a kind of half-chartist.
Actually it is my half-chartist side
which is currently giving me a strong
signal about Geoff K. Gray Holdings.
Luckily my fundamental side agrees.
Here’s why: The company, which is
recognised as a specialist in fine art and
industrial auctioneering, has just an-
nounced increases in all three depart-
ments —sales, profits, and dividends. In
addition, it is also showing every sign
of achieving an earning rate of around
35 percent on ordinary capital for the
current year. This will give a good w ide
dividend cover to the newly indicated
dividend of 20 percent. Despite all
these healthy signs, the market still
persists in valuing its 50-cent shares at
$1.05, which means, to me, anyw'ay, a
very much over-generous dividend yield
of 9.5 percent. I feel the shares can’t
last long at this price and will be soon
bidded up to a more reasonable level
I paid up and got 200.
Well, at last we have the details
on the much awaited Kiwi float. I’ m
afraid it’s not going to be the bright,
shining money-spinning issue most of
the stags were hoping for. Still I
suppose they can’t really complain
lately about the quality of issues. Kiwi
is floating off one-fifth of its $lO million
paid capital at $1.20 per $l.OO share.
Shareholders taking up the issue have
been promised a dividend of 7 percent
which will effectively yield 5.8 percent
on the issue price. Last year’s earnings
were 12.6 percent on the currently pro-
posed capital; this could be marginally
less this year if the trend indicated
in the first six months continues. All
in all, not much to get excited about.
Since I won’t be in on Kiwi, I am
hoping to make my 17 percent from
Evans Deakin’s rights. I bought a
thousand in the hope that I’ll be able
to squeeze out a 2 or 3 cent profit
before trading finishes. Actually this
doesn’t seem much to hope for, but it
would represent a good profit percent-
age-wise. Generally speaking, heavy
engineering doesn’t appear to be any-
one’s cup of tea at this stage (just
look at Clyde), yet I still feel that
Evans Deakin has been marked down
just a little too drastically. Last year
the company earned 23 percent on
capital. The market is now nervous
that this rate will not be maintained.
The concern is over the same problem
which caused last year’s profits to fall
so much—the heavy expenses being in-
curred by delays in the reconstruction
of the shipyard at Kangaroo Point in
sunny Queensland.
On the subject of delays, it looks as
though I was a bit slow off the mark
with the sale of my Consolidated Metal
rights. I should have sold out about a
week after buying them, when they
went to 27 cents. The price was down
23 cents when I finally cashed in my
chips this week. Nevertheless, I was
still able to make a small but still very
welcome profit of $3B from the venture.
. My transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
200 Geoff K. Gray $1.05 $214
1000 Evans Deakin rights $0.15 $153
SOLD
4000 Cons’d Metal rights $0.23 $902
This leaves the account $270 on
the wrong side of the ledger.

Some riches for the picking
By JASON in Sydney
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
TAKE A GOOD look at the non-
mining section of the market. It is
not as healthy as you may think. And
when you compare it with the latest
whopping rise in Gross National Pro-
duct, this section of the market is
unreasonably low.
Until last week there had been
something of a revival in the index
of non-mining ordinary shares; it had
risen from the March 16 low of 281
points to the latest level around 293.
But even that had been more apparent
than real, as the rise in that solid old
speculative mining stock, BHP, over
that time from the $6.30s to the $8
mark has been the major factor in that.
There are some observers (including
our Chartist) getting a little uneasy
about the trend in industrial share
prices; they looked none too bright at
the end of last week. There is no
doubt about the latest downturn in
the non-mining ordinary shares, which
have quickly eased back 4.7 points
from their peak for the year of 292.72
on June 22.
The latest news of slightly more
restrictive attitudes at the banks may
have something to do with it, as may
the continued chat about balance-of-
payments problems and world crises
and all that stuff. But before getting
too disturbed about it, investors should
recognise that the advent of Hamers-
ley, the nickel news from CRA, and
the remarkable boom in mining these
seemed to spark, have diverted inter-
est (and cash) from the ordinary sec-
ti? 11 to t^ie m£n£n § ppst. That money
w iU eventually find its way back (in
some cases, much increased) when the
bloom inevitably goes off the present
boom.
On the face of it, the economic
outlook is such that people should be
falling over themselves to buy the
good-quality stocks that stand to do
so much better in these improved
times: retailers like Myers and Grace
Bros; basic industries like ACI
Lysaghts, and APM; packaging com-
panies like Reed and Fibre Containers;
breweries like Swan, Tooth, and Carl-
ton and United; pastoralists like Elder
Smith, and other market heavyweights
like Burns Philp, CSR, J. Hardie, and
Humes all look good to me.
The moral of all this is that one
of the best times to buy good-quality
stocks at modest prices is during a
minerals boom (provided all the eco-
nomic indicators are pointing up at
the same time). The time is ideal
right now; there are riches there for
the picking.
CHANGED MARKET situations have
altered the outlook for some of the
stocks mentioned by the Chartist on
this page in recent times. The Chartist’s
latest comments on these are as follows:
Amalgamated Holdings’ current
trend remains neutral whilst the support
level at $l.lO holds. It would need to
rise above $1.45 on high volume before
a technical buy signal could be given.
Australian Guarantee Corporation
should be closely watched as a five
percent penetration below the current
40 percent uptrendline at $1.56 would
issue a selling signal.
Deposit & Investment is also show-
ing some bearish tendencies after an
uptrend of 100 percent per annum for
nearly two years. Again, any penetra-
tion of five percent below the trendline
at 36c would indicate selling action.
E. Z. Industries has been reassessed
on recent market action, where prices
have risen to $2.70 on very high vol-
ume. The current trend would be con-
sidered neutral whilst prices remain in
the rectangle below $2.80 and above
$1.90, where consolidation has taken
place over the past three years. Any
penetration of either level would indi-
cate a move of major proportions up
or down as previously indicated.
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS WHO entered KOLOTEX HOLDINGS LTD. during the early
part of 1962 would have had a good run for their money, as an uptrend at a
rate of close to 100 percent appreciation per annum was followed for nearly three
years until the break in trend in March, 1965. This chart would represent
a good example of a stock in a growth phase, as well as a trendline study. A
new high of $1.32 was recorded toward the end of 1965 and a downtrend has
since followed, with the low point of 60c recorded in October, 1966. The
future direction of this stock should become evident over the next few weeks
and any fall below the support level at 60c would indicate that a target of
35c would he possible, with a more pessimistic downside objective of 25c. Alter-
natively, a rise above 80c on high volume would break the downtrend and a move
up to $1.30 could eventually follow. The present outlook remains more bearish
than bullish. Last sale price on 31/5/67 —75 c.

The rumors around CIG
By PELIAS in Melbourne
N OW THAT Commonwealth Industrial
g as es has settled back in the market
following a bout of spirited buying on
the strength of takeover rumors, the
shares have some appeal. At $2.20, they
are still historically low. Of course,
there are reasons for this. Largely due
to tough competition from Australian
Liquid Air (which last week announced
another loss) GlG’s 1965-66 11 percent
dividend was only covered by 14 per-
cent earnings on capital and, as the
company has indicated that future
capital expenditure may be financed
more by internal resources than by
borrowings, there are some fears of a
dividend cut.
The group has maintained dividends
at 11 percent for some time now and
a cut does not seem really necessary,
in the current year at least. The group’s
sales are known to have improved
somewhat since September 30 last
ClG’s chairman, R. A. Irish
(balance date) and, although profit
trends in the same direction cannot be
automatically assumed, a higher result
should be earned without trouble in
1966-67.
The new oxygen plant at Port
Kembla has come into operation since
balance date. As well as the extra
money this will be bringing into the
coffers this year, there will be addi-
tional benefits through tax savings
under investment allowances. More-
over, the company’s fall from grace
appears to have been largely the result
°f an unfortunate combination of
Averse factors, with drought and higher
costs having an impact at the same
tlm e as competition intensified.
While rising costs may still prevail, the
drought will not be having such a strong
effect and the competitive conditions
should have been eased by the better
economic conditions so far this year.
Another factor worth remembering is
that the industrial tightness which has
affected the group came in the middle
of one of its largest-ever expansion pro-
grams. The absence of most of these
factors should ensure a substantially
better performance this year.
The shares seem sound-enough buy-
ing, especially in the long term, while
they remain round their present price.
The takeover rumors which periodically
spur trading are not entirely baseless,
either. The British Oxygen Co. holds
something like 60 percent of the capital,
and the way U.K. companies are behav-
ing out here at the moment anything
could happen. An underpublicised point

of note at the moment is the likely
effect on CIG if British Oxygen gets
complete hold of Murex, another UK
group. If this resulted in Murex’s 30
percent of the Australian arc-welding
equipment market being handed over
to CIG (through a merger with the
local Murex subsidiary, or sotne such
scheme), ClG’s share of the market
would jump to 85 percent and, p re .
sumably, this would help profits no end.
Another factor which must come into
buying decision is the vulnerability of
British Oxygen itself to takeover,
Rumors, quite strong ones, have cir-
culated to this effect several times. Al-
though there is no likelihood of such
a mood at this moment, it remains a
possibility and could result in a bid for
the whole of CIG, too.
All this is, of course, highly con-
jectural; but the fact remains that there
are three angles from which CIG shares
stand to get a real shot in the arm-
takeover by the parent, takeover of the
parent, or some sort of deal with the
local Murex group. The addition of
these possibilities to the good year which
the group seems due for and which
should see market fears of a dividend
cut dispelled—provided what appears
to be a good buying opportunity.
YELLOW EXPRESS shares were fetch-
ing around $2.70 in 1964 when every-
thing was running smoothly and profits
were rising continually. Then the com-
pany made a bonus issue, which was
followed by lower profits for two years.
The shares drifted accordingly until
last December, when they settled around
$1 or twice par. The drift set in again
in February, when the interim divi-
dend for the current year was reduced;
early in May the scrip bottomed at 80
cents. Since then, there has been a
recovery to 88 cents and it would seem
that the shares are on their way up
again.
At this level they should be excellent
buying. Quite apart from the recovery
in both share price and profits which
seems to have got under way, the com-
pany remains extremely takeover-prone
while the shares are so low. Although
this is only a side issue in making a
buying decision, it must be given some
consideration.
The reduction in this year’s interim
dividend from 1\ to 6j percent indi-
cated a cut in the full annual rate from
15 to 12J percent. There is little doubt
that the payout will be restored, if not
this year then in 1967-68. The cut was
not made because of reduced profits
(in fact, earnings were higher in the
December half) but for prudency; earn-
ing rate was only 16.1 percent in 1965-
66 and tfie group is not exactly well
endowed with liquid funds.

TYPEWRITER
THATISNT
100 YEARS OM
The first practical typewriter was invented in 1867. For
seventy years, there was no really fundamental advance
in principle. Even the first electric typewriter to come on
the market in the 1930's still had typebars and a moving
carriage. Then IBM engineers began a fifteen years
research program to revolutionise typing. They came up
with the unique IBM type ball.
The IBM type ball works faster than the human eye can
follow. It takes two fingers—and five seconds—to change
IBM type balls to any one of sixteen different faces. The
IBM type ball does away with the moving carriage. (No
vibration, more desk space). The IBM type ball does
away with type bars. (No more clashing; faster operation
because the type ball works within a quarter of an inch
from the ribbon).
The IBM type ball is linked with a unique stroke stor-
age system. Strike two keys almost simultaneously—the
IBM 72 prints the first character, remembers the second,
prints it next. Move youroffice into the computer age with
an IBM Electric Typewriter.

gained ground on all fronts in the
current six months. The factors which
adversely affected the group in 1965-66
are only being ironed out in the cur-
rent year, but should be fully smoothed
by next year. In addition, the Queens-
land operations should start to make a
rea l difference to profits then. Part of
these are aimed at winning extra busi-
es through the Gladstone alumina
plant. There is a lot of business to be
won there, especially now that the plant
is being extended. For these reasons,
anyone buying the shares at present
should get handsome capital benefits
if the parcel can be held for about a
year. There may be strong gains earlier
if the current recovery trend in the
share price proves prolonged.
TARAX SHARES have been behaving
most peculiarly in the market over
the past few weeks. From May 1 to
May 31, for example, the price ranged
from as high as 98 down to 85 cents.
In April it had dropped as low as 76
cents and recovered to 86, while in
March, the month the poor interim
report was released, it had moved be-
tween 93 to 85 cents. In January and
February the price wandered between
$l.lB and $l.
These moves, taking place as they
do within four weeks or less, leave
plenty of room for speculative profit,
even after brokerage both ways. As the
company’s position is believed to have
improved in the current six months, it
would seem that there are money-mak-
ing possibilities if the shares can be got
for between 85 and 90 cents. At the
time of writing, the shares had been
run up from 88 to 93 cents, so anybody
interested would have to wait for them
to settle back again.
For those interested in holding the
shares for more than four weeks, there
could be bigger gains. Current prices
reflect the cut in interim dividend from
six to five percent; this indicated a cut
in annual rate from 12 to 10 percent.
However, as the dry spell in the cur-,
rent half-year will have lifted the com-
pany’s sales and the 1965-66 dividend
was covered almost twice by earnings,
there is every chance that the 1966-67
dividend will be 11 percent or even
steady at 12 percent. 'ln either case, the
market should respond by returning
Prices to more than $1 again.
HAVIES COOP shares have drifted
“ack to 36 cents now that the Viyella
“'d is no longer supporting the market.
H is rather hard to make an investment
decision at this price. Anyone who
bought the shares at the recommended
-9 cents (March 11, p. 49) would
Probably be taking most of the profit he
's likely to get (presuming, of course,
'dat this was not done when the shares
were fetching more than 40 cents).
° ut there could be a bit more in the
stoc k and, for those considering a buy
now, there appear to be three factors
worth taking into consideration.
First, the company should perform
as predicted in the current year and
the return from dividends on current
prices will be around 11 percent. This
should warrant an increase in market
prices. On the other hand, the future
outlook for the group may be doubtful.
The longer-term predictions made by
the directors are open to the risk of
change in an industry such as textiles;
moreover, the group could lose some
business if Viyella decides to be nasty
once it has sold its shareholding. This
would not necessarily be petty, as share-
holders would probably be prepared to
accept a 40-cent bid in a couple of
years if the group was still performing
badly. Third, it would be wrong to
assume that Viyella has given up the
battle for the time being,
On these facts it would seem that
the shares may be good buying for
the very short term only. If a decent
profit presents itself it should be taken,
If nothing happens within a couple of
months it may be best to sell out.

Mining
Benefits for West. Titanium
IT HAS BEEN a characteristic of Aus-
tralian mineral discoveries that most
of them have occurred well away from
the most suitable places for treatment
and fabrication, as the fabricating pro-
cess requires the use of fuel, etc., which
is more expensive to transport than the
actual mineral. We are fairly used to
the extensive distances covered by com-
panies like BHP in shipping its iron
ore from Yampi to Port Kembla, where
the coal deposits are located. Peko-
Wallsend sends its copper concentrates
from Tennant Creek to Japan; iron
ore is being sent from Hamersley to
Wales, and Western Titanium ships
most of its ilmenite production to the
United Kingdom from Capel, near
Bunbury in Western Australia.
Such distances involve a relatively
high element of freight costs, as it may
take perhaps two tons of ore (depend-
ing on the grade of concentrate) to pro-
duce one ton of metal. The miner is
paid according to the metal content of
the concentrate, so the fewer tons of
concentrate which the fabricator has
to pay freight on the happier he is.
And, of course, his costs of refining and
smelting are less, too. For such reasons
as these he is prepared to pay a higher
figure for richer concentrate,
This is one reason behind the efforts
of Western Titanium N.L. to develop
a commercially feasible process for the
enrichment, or “beneficiation,” of
ilmenite. The other reason is the pros-
pect of an increasing shortage of rutile
at prices acceptable to the main users
of titanium dioxide, that is, the pro-
ducers of white pigment. (Both rutile
and ilmenite are sources of titanium
dioxide, which produces the whitest
substance so far developed.) The pros-
pect of this shortage has led pigment
producers to seek an alternative source
of supply to rutile.
Ilmenite can only compete with
rutile by selling at a much lower price,
as it contains less titanium dioxide and
has to be processed in a different man-
ner; it also contains iron impurities
which rutile does not suffer from. The
effect of these differences is that, while
rutile sells at around $7O per ton, ilme-
nite is priced at about $lO per ton.
While a good-sized plant could cost
up to $5 million, the benefits of
developing a successful “beneficiation”
process on a commercial scale would
adequately justify the expenditure i n
the longer term. Parcels of beneficiated
ilmenite sent overseas on a trial basis
by Western Titanium have been techni-
cally satisfactory, with titanium dioxide
content of over 85 percent. Based on
prices of $lO for ilmenite containing
about 55 percent of titanium dioxide
the beneficiated ilmenite would be
worth something like $lB per ton. But
on a commercial scale, the savings to
be made by way of lower freight costs
per ton of titanium dioxide would be
substantial, and there would also be
considerable savings due to cheaper pro-
cessing, particularly due to the removal
of iron-ore impurities, which make up
a large portion of the ilmenite shipped
by Western Titanium (and for that
matter all other ilmenite producers
it is the iron impurities which make
the big difference between rutile and
ilmenite).
The chairman of the company, Mr.
K. A. Cameron, said in his address to
shareholders last month that there is
good reason to expect that within a
year or two the company will be war-
ranted in establishing a plant with a
capacity of some 100,000 tons per
annum of beneficiated material. Such
a plant would, on the basis of prices of
perhaps $5O per ton for the bene-
ficiated ilmenite, increase the com-
pany’s sales revenue by up to $4 mil-
lion. Without any attempt at estimating
the likely costs of the process, it is
still fairly clear that the investment of
the $5 million would be justified. The
company is to build a semi-commercial
plant with a capacity of only 10,000
tons per annum and the cost savings
per ton on a 100,000 ton a year plant
should easily ensure the profitability of
the project.
This project would be in addition
to the company’s existing mining opera-
tion and may call for implementing the
additional mining operation referred to
in the 1965 chairman’s address. Either
of these possible investments would re-
quire considerable funds, and would
mean a call on the contributing shares.
At the time that these shares were
issued, in October, 1965, it was stated
that a further issue of capital would be
necessary if the beneficiation project
became a commercial proposition, prob-
ably not earlier than eighteen months
hence. The time for this additional
capital must now be approaching fairly
rapidly. This would provide the com-
pany with an opportunity to make the
cash issue referred to in the 1966 chair-
man’s address, rather than call up
further money on its contributing shares.
The former of these alternatives would
be of some advantage in that it would
determine the disability attaching to the
1,200,000 shares issued by the company
some time ago to Aberfoyle Holdings
Limited, which have since been acquired
by Mining Traders Ltd., Longreach Oil
Ltd., and other institutional investors.


Security analysis
British Tobacco wins
another round
IT IS NOW over seven years since the
investors in ordinary shares decided
that David Rothmans had slain Goliath
British Tobacco Company (Australia)
Ltd. with his King Size Filter sling-
shot. It has since been demonstrated
that Goliath was not killed, and
although cut down substantially in size
(of market share) has managed to fight
back. In fact, the latest news would
suggest that the 1966-67 round will
again go to Goliath.
Today, British Tobacco’s shares are
selling at 11.8 times latest earnings,
whereas 16 months ago they were 12.2
times earnings. Yet today’s price is
35 percent higher than the price of 16
months ago. The reason for this
apparent anomaly is that 16 months ago
the price was based on 1963-64 earn-
ings, which are 28 percent less than
1965-66 earnings. With the growth in
earnings which has occurred in the past
five years (but particularly in the past
two), one could have expected British
Tobacco’s ordinary shares to be selling
at a rather higher price/earnings mul-
tiple. In fact, the market price has
lagged behind growth in earnings as
the following indices show:

Earnings 100 111 121 169 185
Market price. 100 120 121 137 169
We might examine a few of the
factors which may have prevented a
rather fuller appreciation in price, but
before doing so we should have a look
at the statistics:

There is no doubt that the profit
%ures and the normal profit ratios have
been very good over this five-year
period, and the record can hardly be
faulted. One of the most significant
factors is that, despite the rapid growth
ln shareholders’ funds, the percentage
of earnings to shareholders’ funds has
been steadily increasing over the whole
period. It must be pointed out that
Ae improvement has been achieved to
some extent at the expense of higher
gearing. In other words, external credi-
tors have been providing an increasing
proportion of the total funds which
have been employed over this period,
jfi't) come what may, there are very
tew companies which have been able
t° point to a similar record over the
same period.
British Tobacco has been in the busi-
ness of making cigarettes, cigars, and
tobacco for a long time, and also it has
been in printing and packaging for a
similar period. The original company
in the printing group was acquired in
1914 or thereabouts. The entry into
soft drinks, ice-cream, and other snack
foods is of recent origin, and although
most of the news about the British
Tobacco group has been directed to-
ward this side of the business in recent
months, it is clear that the “food”
group has not made much of a contribu-
tion to the total group profits. In the
1964/65 year it was stated that the
tobacco group accounted for 75 per-
cent of the British Tobacco group’s
total invested funds; it is quite possible
that it also accounted for about the
same percentage of group profit. The
tobacco industry has looked odd in
that, while the medical profession and
others were proving that smoking was
injurious to health, and probably
causing at least a levelling-off in total
cigarette sales, the profitability of the
cigarette companies seems to have been
increasing as a group.
To some extent the group has bene-
fited from the faster and more modern
machinery that has now been installed
by all the Australian companies, but it
seems that W. D. & H. O. Wills has
also managed to increase its share of
the market. As a result, there has been
an increase in earnings of about 45
percent from 1962 to 1966 an aver-
age rate of growth in excess of 9| per-
cent per annum compound. Cigarette
consumption might have been increas-
ing at about 3 percent per annum
compound during this period, and
although it is probable that the con-
sumption of cigars has gone up, the
production of cigars locally has declin-
ed quite markedly, as has the produc-
tion of pipe and cigarette tobacco. It
may well be that over the next 50 to
100 years the tobacco industry will go
into a decline and that, after a while,
there will be an actual decline in the
total amount of tobacco consumed in
Australia. Even when this situation
occurs, there will still be tobacco com-
panies making increasing profits, be-
cause they are producing tobacco more
efficiently or because they are getting
a larger share of a diminishing market.
It is also possible that the tobacco com-
panies will survive the “lung cancer”
campaigns of the latter half of the
20th century, just as the breweries
survived the “temperance” campaigns
of the early years of the 20th century.
The printing and packaging group,
in which British Tobacco has a 60 per-
cent interest, has also been expanding
in recent years: the notable acquisition
was Dodge Consolidated Industries.
The main expansion seems to have
occurred in 1960, when four companies
were acquired. Partly as a result cf
the Dodge takeover, profits of this
group have increased by well over 100
percent in the past two years; there is
every reason to believe that profits of
the group will continue to expand (but
not at the same rate) in the future as
the other two groups tobacco and
food demand more and more pack-
aging for their products.
The food group is the most recent
and has incurred the most trouble. Its
interests cover over half a million acres
of pastoral properties, a big slice of the
Australian soft-drink companies, some
difficult situations in frozen foods and
ice-cream, two well-known companies
in meat and smallgoods, and several
interests in snack foods. British
Tobacco’s share in this group is only
51 percent and the remaining capital
is held by British American Tobacco
of the U.K., which also has a holding
of about 30 percent in British Tobacco
(Aust.). Soft drinks and snack foods
seem to have performed quite well and
there has been little or no com-
ment regarding these activities in the
Press, but the ice-cream group (which
includes frozen foods) has been the
subject of considerable comment. The
large losses by Dairy Frost would be
sufficient in themselves to make head-
lines and the battle with the partner
in Sou-West Frozen Foods is another
matter of some news value, as has been
the takeover battle for Golden
Poultry.
Some progress seems to have been
made toward putting the newly
acquired subsidiaries on to profitable
bases; at this stage it is difficult to say
how long it will take before the profits
of the food group are equal to those
of the printing and packaging group.
Of course, the new brewery in Mel-
bourne may produce substantial profits
very early and reward British Tobacco
with dividends on its 30 percent share
much sooner than expected. At this
stage, though, it does not look as though
this investment will make a very large
contribution to group profit for some
years to come.
In summary, the British Tobacco
(Aust.) group has set out to reduce its
dependence on tobacco and has chosen
the food and drink industries for
diversification. It is well known that
these industries are highly competitive
and the success of the moves of recent
years will depend to a large extent on
management skills. The recovery of
the tobacco division suggests that these
skills exist within the British Tobacco
group.
Today British Tobacco’s shares are
selling at prices 43 percent higher than
the low point of 1966; it looks as though
the market is pricing them at about 12
times earnings. It would appear that
only minimal growth in earnings per
share is expected in the future on this
basis. In 1960 the shares sold at nearly
14 times earnings. In many ways, the
prospects look somewhat better today.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Quite a few miners came a little off the boil as some correc-
tion, and profit-taking, cut across the recent violent upsurges.
Even Western Mining could only manage a 5 cent addition to
reach $14.95. Hamersley fully paids were brought back 13
cents to $4.15 and the contributings dropped the same amount
to $2.93. CRA, following its previous explosion, shed 50 cent
to finish at $7.60. Broken Hill South went down 9 cents /
$3.36 and New Broken Hill 8 cents to $5.76. Among the widel°
retreating industrials, BHP contradicted the leader trend h
gaining 6 cents to close at $7.96. Burns Philp lost 23 cents

Battle among the farmers
By the RURAL EDITOR
jy BOTH N.S.W. and Victoria the
Graziers’ Association has never made
such headway, and long-standing dif-
ferences with other organisations are
out in the open.
The farmer organisations in Austra-
lia have one quite extraordinary facet
which frequently escapes attention.
Membership of one does not debar the
same member from membership with
another. Some farmers, in fact, belong
to three different organisations, all
espousing different policies, at the very
same time. Farmers see nothing strange
in this at all. Observers, who are non-
farmers, are dismayed. While idealists
talk of unity, what actually appears to
be going on is an effort to attract mem-
Mr. McEwen - wheatfarmers critical
bers prepared to give 100 percent
allegiance to one organisation only.
The N.S.W. Graziers’ Association and
the Victorian Graziers’ Association each
seems to be getting new members, in
numbers, and the move which could
eome could be a ruling that member-
ship automatically excludes member-
ship of any other farmer body. In
N.S.W., wheat was long the preserve
°f the United Farmers and Wool-
growers’ Association. Most wheat-
farmers tended to belong to this body
and it was accepted as the voice of
the wheatfarmers. The graziers, who
Previously tended to concentrate on
w ool and beef matters, are moving into
wheat.
The recent negotiation of a new
international wheat agreement at the
Kennedy Round has already been
openly criticised by some Graziers’
Association members. One went so far
as to say it was meaningless because
it gave no guarantee of improved access
to EEC countries for wheat. Access was
what mattered. The new price was
simply a figure which had been moved
more into line with prices which had
actually prevailed in recent years.
Whether this is so (and we are in-
clined personally to think it is), the
point really is that for the first time
in 20 years the Country Party leader,
Mr. McEwen, has a wheatfarming ele-
ment not unduly impressed with his
policies.
It could be that this new element
simply believes it might do better and
that it is time for a change. The same
thought seems to be influencing ele-
ments in Victoria, but here the battle-
ground is different. Wheat has remained
stable in Victoria for some years now.
The traditional wheatfarmer voice in
Victoria comes from the Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association. This body, in
contrast with the N.S.W. situation, has
moved out of its traditional sphere into
beef. It has launched a campaign to
have the Board of Works cattle at
Werribee made available for breeding
purposes. This apparently simple move
is underlined by deep and bitter divi-
sions between the Wheat and Wool-
growers’ and the Graziers’ Associations.
The Board of Works Farm is 28,000
acres of extremely pi'oductive land fer-
tilised by sewage from the nearby city
of Melbourne. Its productivity is enor-
mous. Its critics refer to it as the State
Farm, and this, indeed, is just what it is.
The farm produces fine cattle of
many breeds. In the 1930 s a ban was
placed on their slaughter for human
consumption, but this was lifted fol-
lowing introduction of special regula-
tions covering slaughter. The Graziers’
Association says that there is evidence
that cattle raised on sewage-fertilised
pastures carry the risk of tapeworm in-
festation. If the cattle are permitted to
be sold for breeding, which would take
them far and wide on to numerous pro-
perties, the risk of tapeworn infestation
would increase greatly. The Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association says the evi-
dence shows that there is no risk of
tapeworm.
The Board of Works itself says it
would be pleased to sell the cattle as
breeders, as this would increase revenue
from the farm. Cattle sold now for

about $l5O for slaughter could be worth
$l5OO for breeding. The Board, how-
ever, must get the approval of the
Victorian Government to release the
cattle. Chances of the Government
doing this would seem, at the moment,
to b? about 50-50.
In the heat of the argument both
farmer organisations have misstated
their case. The Wheat and Woolgrowers
apparently believes that some method
could be devised whereby farmers could
get these cattle much cheaper than
equivalent cattle from recognised stud
farms. The Graziers’ Association has
concentrated on the tapeworm angle
and has not deemed it necessary to
admit that recognised breeders f ear
with good reason, the entry of a State’
owned farm with enormous resources'
into the stud cattle businesss.
While the farmer organisations are
locked in battle over this issue, both
apparently, are unaware that there is
yet another view being expressed in the
metropolis. This is that 28,000 acres of
land so close to the city is more than
the Board really needs and that some of
it should be turned into recreational
and/or housing land. Other, more
efficient, methods of sewage disposal
in the engineering sense, are now avail!
able and will become necessary, in any
case, at other points around the city
as population grows.

Bacterial wilt in lucerne
ONE OF THE more dismal discoveries
of recent years is that bacterial wilt of
lucerne is present in Australia. Messrs.
P. R. Smith and R. H. Taylor of the
Victorian Department of Agriculture
recognised it after isolating the bac-
terium from diseased plants collected
throughout south-eastern Victoria.
Any hope that they might have mis-
taken the identity of the bacterium
seems dashed. They sent cultures of the
organism they had isolated to an
American specialist on lucerne wait at
Lucerne, with bacterial wilt (right)
the Department of Plant Pathology,
University of California. He confirmed
their belief that the bacterium was
indeed Corynebacterium insidiosum.
No easy way out of this trouble exists.
The only thing that can be done is
to breed or find, as the Americans have
done, resistant varieties. But this could
be a long process, especially if the new
resistant varieties are to have the pro-
ductive capacity of our most popular
strain, Hunter River. This, our best
variety, is unfortunately the most sus-
ceptible to the disease. Smith and
Taylor have already succeeded in
showing that some of the American
resistant varieties are also resistant to
the Australian bacteria.
Whatever hopes that raises, it seems
that this could be a tough fight. The
Victorian tests show that several strains
of the organism, some more virulent
than others, are present in lucerne
stands in East Gippsland. This suggests
that, as in the case of wheat rust, almost
as soon as a new resistant variety is pro-
duced the organism will change slightly
and be able to resume the invasion of
the host plant.
It seems further that we have been
living in a fool’s paradise these past
15 years. Stringent quarantine regula-
tions, it was thought, were keeping the
disease out of Australia. But it is now
apparent that a mysterious disease
which has been distressing some
lucerne growers for many years, and
which has sometimes been described
as a crown rot, is actually bacterial
wilt. In this time the organism would
probably have been spread far and
wide throughout Australia and would
now be firmly established whenever
conditions suited it.
The crown-rot symptom is one of
the final manifestations of the disease
and is not actually caused by the wilt
bacteria themselves, but by other bac-
teria which are able to set up house
in the weakened plants. The first
symptoms appear on scattered plants in
two- or three-year-old stands. Infected
plants are severely stunted with small,
yellowish leaves that sometimes have
scorched edges. These symptoms are
usually seen most easily two or three
weeks after the paddock is mowed. By
the fifth year so many plants have
succumbed that the stand 1S

By SHEELAH WOOD
ROMAN DE KIMPE is the proprietor
°f Noisette of South Yarra, Melbourne,
where hats, French perfumes, and cos-
metics are sold in elegant surroundings.
J^ e is Flemish, one of nine children
horn to a family of famous antique
restorers; their specialty was 16th-
and 17th-century oak furniture and
church restorations and they are men-
tioned in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
When he was 15 his aunt sent for
pi to join her in an enormous mil-
lmery establishment she and her hus-
band ran in Paris. Later he worked in
the couture houses of Jacques Fath
and Lanvin.
Mr. de Kimpe considers that the
gteat days of haute couture and haute
mode are over; he now employs four
girls where he once had 25 in his work-
room. There have been few apprentices
in recent times, and his youngest “girl”
is 60 yeafis of age. Until recently, his
workroom was run by Madam Alice
Stonelake. When she died at 80 years of
age, he considered an era had finished.
Mr. de Kimpe came to Australia in
1949 on impulse and decided to settle
here. He says he has now made his life
here. When he went back to France
after the death of his parents, his first
impression was that everything, house,
village, and people, had shrunk.
He sometimes grows nostalgic for his
happy childhood when he was the
family apple turner. His mother put
the Perrine apples in the loft and they
were turned over until the outer skin
had withered and the inside was just

Mr. de Kimpe lives in Hawthorn in
a 100-year-old house with enormous
cellars where he stores his wine. He
has preserved the facade, but you get
a pleasant shock when you enter to find
yourself in a huge mirrored hall with
immense rooms opening off it. H; s
house is filled with fine oak furniture
inherited from his parents, and pictures

and in Europe.
He has a workmanlike kitchen where

they prefer it that way.

The onslaughts of an Irish sage
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
blasts and Benedictions. Sean O’Casey.
Macmillan. $4.60.
O’Casey. Saros Cowasjee. Oliver and
Boyd. $2.15.
TO THE DAY of his death at the age
of 34 in 1964, Sean O’Casey was still
roaring like the bull of Bashan in the
English literary meadows. Time never
withered nor custom staled the infinite
variety of things he hated with gusto.
His very last essay, “The Bald Prima-
queera,” written just before he died,
W s a ferocious onslaught on the
Theatres of Cruelty and the Absurd:
“As Minerva is said to have sprung
from the head of Jupiter, so these
playwrights seem to claim to have
jumped from the head of Freud, a
shocking mishap to happen to any-
one. They dibble and dabble in their
plays with the Freudian faculties,
turning them into neurotic fixatives
and erotic fribbles and frabbles of
their own. There must be some
Freudian reason for their frequent
leering, sneering among the lower
depths of the human body. To them
the body is a vile body, and it is
nothing more. The Christian Church
nourished and nursed this idea, aim-
ing at getting out of the body to be
present in the Lord. The idea didn’t
work, and it doesn’t work now . . .”
This rhodomontade is typical of
O’Casey the essayist and critic raging
to the point of incoherence, splendidly
splenetic, syntax flying in all directions.
It is heady stuff and, whether you
agree with his opinions or not, highly
entertaining reading. This book,
Masts and Benedictions,” is a selec-
tion of O’Casey’s occasional pieces
reviews, essays, replies to critics, etc.
written during his long, self-imposed
exile in England after he fled from
Ireland in 1926 with priests and
patriots baying at his heels.
They cover the whole range of his
targets the Church (Catholic and
uotestant alike), literary censorship,
capitalist society, modern drama from
cocktails to Wesker’s kitchen
sinks, prudes and puritans, and philis-
tine critics like James Agate, who were
tardy in recognising the genius of Sean
0 Casey. Sandwiched in between are
perceptive appreciations of Lady
bregory, Yeats (with reservations),
bynge, Shaw, Charles Lever, and D. H.
bawrence.
No one in his senses would judge
bean O’Casey as writer and thinker
from these random slings and arrows.
Like Shaw he made the theatre the
real forum of his philosophy. He said
all he had to say in his dramas, and
much more powerfully, too, when—-
even in such symbolic fantasies as
“Cock-a-Doodle Dandy”—his writing
was controlled by a superb sense of
stagecraft and a feeling for the lilting
rhythms of Irish speech unrivalled by
any other playwright hatched in the
nursery of the old Abbey Theatre.
As Professor Cowasjee says in his
short and sensible book on O’Casey’s
life and work, his grandest achievement
in prose was the autobiography pub-
lished in six volumes between 1939 and
1954. What a marvellous picture this
is of his Irish years. You can smell
Dublin in its pages as you can in
“Ulysses,” and no writer ever evoked
his formative years more vividly than
O’Casey conjured up the desperate
poverty of his milieu, his stubborn
integrity, and his growing contempt for
the illusions on which his people fed.
It would be quite unfair to say that
“Blasts and Benedictions” did not
deserve publication. Every line O’Casey
wrote is enjoyable, and it is good to
have these scattered pieces collected in
a single volume, even though they will
scarcely add to his reputation. When
O’Casey dashed off something in a
white heat (as much of this was
evidently written) he exploded into a
slather-and-bang style of ridicule,
rancor, and shillelagh-thumping that
did more credit to his enthusiasm than
his judgment.
One thread that runs through all his
writings is his fierce love-hate relation-
ship with his native land. And, after all,
O’Casey had some grounds for com-
plaint. It was he who rescued the Abbey
Theatre from the preciosity into which
it was sinking after the mythopoeic
dreams of Yeats and Lady Gregory. It
was O’Casey who rubbed the theatre-
goers’ noses in the fearful drama of the
1916 Rising and the Black-and-Tans.
Unfortunately, “The Shadow of a Gun-
man,” “Juno and the Paycock,” and
“The Plough and the Stars” did not
turn out to be quite what the Irish
public expected of the Abbey’s white
hope. Were these the heroes of the
Troubles these garrulous pothouse
braggarts, these disillusioned women
who prayed only that their men might
return instead of gloriously sending
them out to die for Cathleen ni
Houlihan?
The Abbey Theatre patriots accepted
Sean O’Casey
the first two, finding themselves emerg-
ing at last from the mists of the Celtic
twilight to be deliciously engulfed in a
rich broth of violence, humor, satire
and the unselfconscious poetry of the
common speech of the Dublin streets.
But they rioted at “The Plough and
the Stars,” and O’Casey, following the
time-honored tradition of Ireland’s
literary men from Dean Swift to James
Joyce, took himself off into exile, never
to return.
To the end of his days, O’Casey
denied that his genius suffered from
this severance from its taproots. He
remained an Irish writer, passionately
concerned about conditions in Ireland
and fulminating endlessly against what
he regarded as the Church-inspired
obscurantism that deadened and stifled
native Irish literature. However, his
own work did change direction to some
degree. His later plays are harsher,
more bitterly uncompromising, aban-
doning pure realism for a mixture of
symbolism and naturalism that is some-
times hard on the reader and must be
a sight harder on producers.
In the 1930 s O’Casey also proclaimed
himself a Communist and wrote two
plays to prove it (“The Star Turns
Red” and “Red Roses For Me,” not
his happiest efforts), though his Com-
munism was idiosyncratic, to say the
least. When, because of the objections
of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin,
“The Drums of Father Ned” was
barred from the 1958 Dublin Theatre
Festival, O’Casey retorted by prohibit-
ing the staging of any of his plays in
Ireland. The ban has now gone, but
his reputation in Ireland is still equivo-
cal. O’Casey was an uncomfortable
genius for any land to own to, and
many of his barbs rankle yet.


Biography soup
By M. H. ELLIS
Australian Dictionary of Biography
Part 11. Melbourne University Press.
$l2.
THE PUBLISHER’S BLURB certifies
that this second half of the A.D.B. con-
tains 581 biographies covering the first
62 years, of Australian history, “the pro-
duct of close co-operation between the
History Departments in all Australian
universities and historical and genealogi-
cal societies, and many individual
scholars.”
Neither in organisation nor in con-
tent is it much credit to anybody, and
it fails to specify among those who
demand acknowledgement the many in-
experienced relatives of ancestors who
were asked to join the enterprise.
Originally, the dictionary was plan-
ned in rational periods. But about the
second period (1826-1856) the universi-
ties’ pundits apparently knew so little
that they found insufficient names' to
cover the needed range. So the two
volumes up to 1850 were lumped to-
gether under the joint editorship of two
professors, with a general editor over
them, who was not a specialist in the
biography or history of the States —
N.S.W., Tasmania, and Victoria—most
affected.
The result was that Volume I,
which included only the letters A-H,
came out last year about three or four
years late, and since most of the promi-
nent figures were inconsiderate enough
to have names beginning with the letters
I-Z, students were called on to wait
another year before they were able to
make use of the biographies (or what
the editors are pleased to present as the
biographies) of men such as Governors
King and Macquarie, of John Mac-
arthur, the Rev. Samuel Marsden,
McLeays, the Wentworths and Win-
deyers, and the great early founders of
finance, commerce, the pastoral indus-
try, and scientific agriculture and
pioneer exploitation of mineral wealth.
The results are no credit to the edi-
tors and the teeming committees of
supervision advertised in the introduc-
tory lists. And the criteria for the
second half of the alphabet are different
from those in the first half in Vol. I.
To include biographies of a some-
times flogged convict who did nothing in
a rather misspent life save go on board
the wreck of the Sirius at Norfolk
Island in 1790 and allegedly “sa\e”
her, of a sergeant-major of the South
Devons \,ho did nothing what even of
note except leave behind a rather
scrappy account book, and of similarly
unimportant scallawags is questionable,
to say the least.
But when they are recorded in a
volume in which some of the most
prominent men of the time are totally
ignored one can only wonder about the
standards of the University Historical
Department. Those ignored include
John Macarthur, jun., the first Aus-
tralian to take a university degree, to
become a barrister and to attain quasi-
judicial status in England (apart from
master-minding the details of the for-
mation of the Australian Agricultural
Company and the establishment of the
standard techniques of wool sorting
and preparation); Sir Edward Mac-
arthur, K.C.8., our first Australian
officer of the British Army (he was
brought here as an infant in arms), the
first Australian to become a lieutenant-
general and to administer an Australian
Colonial Government (Victoria) or to
command the British Military Forces
in Australia or to serve in an office at
the Court of St. James.
Also forgotten is the very eminent Sir
William Macarthur, MLC, our most
eminent early botanist, acclimatiser
and establisher of plants and trees, the
founder of silage techniques in Aus-
tralia, one of the great builders of wool
technique, and the patron of great ex-
plorers, and the first Australian com-
missioner to an overseas expedition.
These are left out while Professor Bede
Nairn devotes a whole two and a half
pages to Hannibal Macarthur, the un-
important nephew of John Macarthur,
sen., and disastrously his factotum and
assistant.
There seems to have been nobody
with Australian experience to do the
Macquarie biography, which was allo-
cated to N. D. McLachlan, whose piece
is reasonably satisfactory except for his
bibliography, which is sadly deficient
from a student’s viewpoint, and some
of his conclusions point the fact that he
wrote at second-hand about the period
which gave Macquarie his importance
—the period of his career in Aus-
tralia. He has made the most of the
scant British domestic material. Profes-
sor A. G. L. Shaw’s biography of
Governor King, to my mind, is based
on too trusting an account of King's
own versions of circumstances and
events.
It fails to give a true picture of his
ineptitude in administration and is in
serious error in portrayal of his re-
lationships with the officers of the New
South Wales Corps. It reflects the de-
tails of events connected with Irish
rebelliousness and does not get down
to the real root of the causes that
brought about his ruin, which was not
due to the machinations of the New
South Wales Corps but to demonstra-
tions of his lack of capacity and his
contradictions of attitude and action
all too evident to the Home Authorities.
John Macarthur was allotted, along
with other wool pioneers of note, to
two young ladies, neither of whom
knows very much about the subject.
They make prim and uninformed but
positive judgments following the parrot
verdicts of “historians” of the Evatt
breed.
Macarthur was remitted to the tender
mercies of Miss Margaret Steven, whose
rather bewildering and no doubt un-
intentionally bowdlerised biography of
Merchant Campbell was published a
year or two ago. She prefers to judw
Macarthur as he was after he suffered
mentally as the aftermath of ship’s fever
in his last years rather than as he was
in his prime. A lot of her judgments are
sheer nonsense, and lack a sense of
proportion.
No great constitutional historians
could be found in the universities to
write what was potentially one of the
two important “fifes” in the two
volumes: W. C. Wentworth’s. The job
went to a schoolmaster at Geelong
Grammar, who shows an inadequate
knowledge of primary sources. Profes-
sor Auchmuty’s biography of D’Arey
Wentworth is sound—he was a descen-
dant of D’Arcy Wentworth’s sister and
wrote perhaps the only satisfactory piece
in the book by a member of the sub-
ject’s family. Windeyer’s biography of
Richard Windeyer is good as far as it
goes, but is inadequate for a man who
in his short fife made such important
contributions to the foundations of the
Australian legal apparatus and consti-
tutional and material development.
All in all, the volumes leave a great
deal indeed to be desired both in the
covering of facts and in accuracy of
statement and judgment. But there is
one very encouraging feature. The
younger historians of the younger uni-
versities have produced work yards
ahead of much of that of the older men
and their lady “research secretaries.”
These younger men, of course, have
had an immensely greater spread ot
material opened up to them in recent
years, but they also have the advantage
of doing their own research.
Memoirs galore
By J. M. COUPER
My Life and Times, Octave 6: 1923-30.
Compton Mackenzie. Chatto &
Windus. $5.30.
FOR COMPTON MACKENZIE, one
begins to suspect, the past years have
become little more than his filing sys-
tem. There is no question that, from
Capri to Savoy Hill to the Channel
Islands to the Western Isles, he knew
the right people, and they exchanged
letters, and the letters may now be
seen. What is in question is whether
his life can stand the attenuation of
six to ten “octaves” of eight years.
Compton Mackenzie, disappointingly,
doesn’t seem to need the reader. He is
well content with the people he has
come in contact with and the deeds he
has accomplished in their season. They
cannot be altered. He has become a
name. He never shows the smallest
desperation when the lights begin to
twinkle from the rocks and the day i*
going. If there is no sign here of 2
suffering man involved in the difficu-
ties of time and choice and change
by them, then there may, really f
nobody here at all. ,

wled by a play, perhaps “Journey’s
£ad,” which actually made plain that
British soldiers could feel fear before
(oing over the trenches. “To pre-

How is this better? He doesn’t stop

he writes on with much more
acknowledgement of heart and head.
The criticism of novelists with which
he finishes his forty-fifth year is the
sort of sense and insight that proceeds
only from practitioners of the art they
are criticising. It had the sureness of
touch that relies on intimate familiarity
rather than on present slant and dis-
cussion. For instance, Jane Austen
“gives us as much opportunity of
knowledge as we should have in actual
life; but no more.”
He confesses to the difficulty of cele-
brating his battles with illness and with
the books he is writing in the midst
of a life otherwise busy enough, and
this brief confession turns the spirit of
the book and of the reader, so that he
sees with admiration the man who,
laid low by recurring bronchitis and
sciatica, braces his mind and nerves to
write a novel at the instigation of his
publisher. He chose, deliberately, a
comic novel, and he finished it in three
months to the accompaniment of his
bronchitis and the laughter of his
secretaries.
Then there are the young Lovat
Frasers and his affection for them, and
theirs for him. And the month’s holi-
day that he gives to a poor woman of
77 because she wrote and asked him to.
He makes no fuss of this, either, but is
glad to think he did it. And he even
recants some of his earlier rashness. It
turns out that Monty can be told,
though at two years old he already
couldn’t, according to his parents.
The mood has turned about and as
the book closes it is genial and for-
bearing forbearing especially in its
resolve not to regret too tenderly the
sweetness of life now past.
Played by ear
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Conversations with Henry Brandon.
Andre Deutsch. $4.60.
IT IS ONLY ten years since Henry
Brandon pioneered his then new con-
cept of taped interviewing and had
at first to cut his way through a forest
of prejudice. Even the editor of “The
Sunday Times,” to whom he suggested
a series with leading Americans, opposed
it but relented after seeing a “pilot” on
Frank Lloyd Wright.
Reading through these 15 interviews
one sees the skill with which Brandon
has learnt to “play it by ear,” the
almost telepathic sensing of an as yet
unvoiced thought, the precise second
he chooses to rub a discreet pinch of
verbal salt into the wound, the decisive,
informed manner in which he courte-
ously spars with his titanic subjects on
their own ground, all capped by the
good Englishman’s inborn instinct for
knowing exactly when to change the
subject.
Instead of the usual platitudinising
PR stuff, which so often makes the
famous into an infamous bore, he
manages to distil the relevant man in
a couple of taped hours and to capture
the essence of his mind in a few pages.
Instead of talking about their successes,
he gets them to talk about the subject
in which they have succeeded.
The only case of a silent partner is
the joint Marilyn Monroe-Arthur Miller
piece, when the playwright seems over-
anxious to grab the lioness’ share of the
mike for fear, one suspects, that his
wife will commit some gaffe by open-
ing her beautiful mouth and putting
her shapely foot in it.
Brandon gets Frank Lloyd Wright
to define his own invention of organic
architecture—one of the few epochal
ideas since the flying buttress —and to
describe the cantilevered principle on
which it works, and to slate modern
skyscraping cities as feudal survivals.
He slaps Brandon’s own baited prefer-
ences down with the reprimand: “This
is a matter of taste and taste is always
a matter of ignorance ... We Ameri-
cans have a vast civilisation and no
culture.”
One of the interviewer’s most hectic
initial duels is with the eminent man-
eating anthropologist Dr. Margaret
Mead, who characteristically side-steps
the first question about those
American “isms” (from materialism to
Momism) by relating a parable with
the unlikely moral that the most primi-
tive New Guinea tribesman is much
more materialistic than the American.
The 1960 Kennedy chapter is one of
the few to have dated, primarily be-
cause Brandon is talking with the Sena-
tor and not yet with the young Presi-
dent. The main issues necessarily deal
with such pre-election spectres long
since laid as the Catholic vote and
the U-2 crisis. But Kennedy the intel-
lectual is there in strength, his driving
political ambition carefully masked by
his easy, casual, aristocratic exterior, his
clear analytical mind dealing coolly
with every question from his policy dis-
agreements with his own father to his
condemnation of the technique of Mc-
Carthyism.
The Peter Brook, Arthur Miller,
Peter Ustinov, and Jonathan (“Beyond
the Fringe”) Miller talks throw a many-
sided spotlight on the theatre. These
four personalities put their finger on
the pulse and assess its strength. Arthur
Miller sees himself as writing for a
culture that has no truck with ideas and
that purposely resists knowing what it
is doing. Brook sees playwrights like
Beckett as creating “an abstract of the
times,” while Ustinov dubs TV as “half-
way between an entertainment and a
lullaby” and finds that the theatre is
still there to ask questions, not to answer
them.
Ben Shahn is, for a painter, aston-
ishingly articulate about his work.
Drawing as vividly in words as on
canvas, he traces his own modern line
directly from Hogarth through Daumier
to the early George Grosz.


Bright Rebellion
By TIMOTHY READ
Through the Minefield. Constantine
Fitz Gibbon. Bodley Head. $3.85.
VIRGINIA WOOLF claimed that the
decade to 1930 produced more auto-
biographies than any other. “Through
the Minefield” is an exciting addition
to that body of work by Constantine
Fitz Gibbon, the biographer of Dylan
Thomas and also the author of the
best-selling novel “When the Kissing
Had to Stop.”
Constantine Fitz Gibbon was born in
Lenox, Massachusetts, in 1919, of an
Irish father and an American mother.
His revolutionary instincts lay dor-
mant during his happiest time; the
years in Lenox before he was sent to
private schools in England. His re-
collection of these years with his sisters
in the multi-racial society of Lenox
is amusing, particularly the incident
where he caddied for the politician
A 1 Smith, who, having badly sliced a
drive, turned to him and said, “Boy,
never shack up with a woman who has
less to lose than you have.”
Happy and carefree though those
years were, they did provide him with
one principle he never forgot, the
principle of equality. His mother had
a colored maid named Estelle who had
become part of the family. Estelle’s
son, Henry, was a friend of Constan-
tine’s. One day when he asked Henry
why Henry was black and he was white
he was told: “You must never, never,
never, never ask that question again.”
He never did, and years later when
his mother remarried and he attended
private schools in England it was the
atmosphere of class distinction, reminis-
cent of that incident, which repulsed
him and turned him into a rebel. At
Wellington, which he likens to a con-
centration camp, he came under the
influence of Esmond Romilly. Romilly,
at the age of 16, fled Wellington
as a self-declared Communist and found
his way to Bloomsbury, where he was
going to publish a Communist magazine
that would gather support from every
school in England. The experience
turned Constantine into “a confirmed
and active rebel ... a Communist, a
pacifist, an atheist, a partisan of free
love, alcoholism, surrealism, free verse,
new verse . . .”
It was his failure to conform to the
English academic system that caused
him to be sent to Europe for private
tuition. He visited Berlin, Munich,
Paris, and many other cities. Naturally,
so precocious a thinker could not help
but pick up the atmosphere of those
cities in the early ’thirties. Young as
he was, he felt the influence of Fascism
(he even met Hitler), and in 1935
espoused the cause of freedom and
volunteered for the Spanish war. As
he was only 16, he was turned down.
His reaction to this is characteristically
humorous and honest. He wasn’t dis-
appointed but secretly relieved. He
wanted to write, and as he was not
allowed to fight for his beliefs because
he was too young he would spend his
time writing about them.
For a brief period before going up
to Oxford via a scholarship, he rented
a small furnished room in Chelsea, and
it was here that he came into contact
with the colony of artists and writers
that inhabited the nearby pubs. He met
Dylan Thomas, who was no more ex-
ceptional than anyone else at the time,
unless it was because he was more
abusive and more drunk. The scenes of
pub life that he recalls are both witty
and evocative and written with the
compassionate touch of someone who
lived through that time when ideals
and thirsts were expansive but cash was
scarce. (Nowadays, in this era of mass
production, when almost anyone who
cares to put pen to paper gets published
and no one starves, it is good to
remember when paper was expensive,
when only the good writers were pub-
lished and the bad could starve, and
sometimes did.)
Going up to Oxford a more worldly
man, no longer a virgin, and carryh
a huge unwrapped nude painting 0 f p
latest amour, he found it to be anotb
class-bound edition of the hated Wei
lington. War is declared and he leave;

To a tune that is nearly familiar.
Is it his own solitude
He would weep for? Above, one gull
Straddles the wind, fails and falls.
The others of the flock who were earlier warned,
Or heeded sooner, are huddled
Half a mile away to ease their grief
In togetherness. Better the brood had not hatched
Than to face such weather.
And who would want, ever, to be a god?

Catholic crisis
I have always prided myself in being
broad-minded and tolerant adherent
3 ( the Catholic faith, but the article
“Priests The Catholic Crisis” (8.,
May 27) has so sickened me that I do
not intend to renew my subscription.
Having been a subscriber for many
years, the decision was a considered one.
' i have never read a more biased and
misinformed article concerning the
Church. It is quite obvious that Mr.
Gough has not even a moderate under-
standing of the Catholic Church. That
there is no factual basis to his asser-
tions may be gauged from the phrases
he has used, purely sweeping generalisa-
tions.
Why did not Mr. Gough quote from
millions of dedicated zealous priests
who are happily continuing to carry out
their ministry instead of from the two
unfortunate priests who left their
Church? The fact being of course that it
is so rare for a Catholic priest to give up
his faith that when such an event does
happen it becomes news.
You would do some justice to the
feelings of possibly 25 percent of your
readers if you were to publish a more
truthful and balanced article which
would no doubt show that no Catholic
crisis does in fact exist. Difficulties
yes, but no crisis.
KEVIN O’NEILL
West Brunswick (Vic.)
We clerics sure have our problems now
that Mr. Peter Gough has told us all
about ourselves, so before the party
breaks up and everyone rushes off to
get married let’s get down a few
thoughts.
There is a subversive idea abroad that
Mr. Gough has been the victim of
some clerical leg-pulling, but I don’t
think any of us would do that to the
dear man.
I really don’t know too much about
our medieval seminary education. I
always thought that it left off being
medieval at the end of the Middle
Ages, but for all I know they still
might carry it on in N.S.W. For myself,
as well as the usual (non-medieval)
seminary I managed to take in the
Victorian Railways Technical College
and the RMIT. I did manage to avoid
Her Majesty’s other well-known college
with the artistic bluestone walls out in
Coburg, though a one-time classmate
of mine did a few months there for
impersonating a vice-admiral.
As for bishops . . . well, I think we
might have to leave them to take care
of themselves for the present, though
some day we might get around to a
Bishops’ Installation and Reformation
Society. A better idea still —let’s all be
bishops and then we can reform each
other.
Mr. Peter Gough really got us
interested when he told us that two
out of three Catholics ignore the teach-
ing of the Church on birth-control, and
so we have terrible nightmares about
hearing confessions. It would be good
to know where he got his info., as no
one else in Australia could come up
with that one.
The article and the resultant oppor-
tunity to write this letter have really
done me good. It has awakened me
from my medieval functionalism (I


think that’s what you said, Mr. Gough)
and has all the effects of a dose of the
good old-fashioned medieval opening
medicine.

$5m. to Indonesia
Your article on Indonesia (8., May 20)
is an excellent report, in the usual
thorough manner of Peter Samuel. He
mentions that Australia’s contribution
will be a straight-out grant. For some
time now the Government has been
extremely proud of the fact that Aus-
tralia is the only country whose over-
seas aid contribution is always made
in the form of a grant.
I would agree that all grants under
United Nation projects with a heavy
emphasis on education and also moneys
given at times of natural disasters
should be without any strings attached.
On the other hand, when we make a
contribution to the economic welfare
of any country we should follow the
lead of other affluent nations and make
those contributions in the form of long-
term loans at low interest rates.
Another point Peter Samuel makes is
that he is not at all happy with the
mere $5 million which may be granted
to Indonesia toward its $2OO million
balance of payment gap. I would sup-
port him in this contention.
Recently the Treasurer has, on num-
erous occasions, made statements in
Parliament regarding the large per-
centage apparently offered to overseas
countries as aid. Firstly, 0.6 percent
of our gross national product is the
total of our contribution, of which, how-
ever, 60 percent is expended in Papua
and New Guinea, and only $47,904,000
(year 1965/66) is being used for pro-
jects outside these territories.
Instead of repeatedly praising our
effort, it is time that we take a hard
look at the contributions we are making
and listen to those who recommend,
and strongly support, an increase to
one percent of the gross national
product on aid programs.
Surely moneys that are lent to coun-
tries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and other
neighbors of ours represent an invest-
ment in our future as well as in theirs.

More's seasons
While it is true that Bolt’s “Man for
All Seasons” has a few historical defects
I do not think Ross Campbell (8., May
27) makes them, on the whole, apparent.
True, the film does err by depicting
Wolsey and the early Cromwell in too
unfavorable a light; again, More was
greatly enfeebled by imprisonment in
the Tower, whereas the film shows him
at trial looking none the worse for his
strict confinement.
But Ross Campbell would be hard put
to it to prove that, in breaking with
Rome, Henry “had the backing of most
of the country.” Henry used coercion
prominently and severely. Mr. Campbell
is on better grounds when instancing
rising nationalism and economic
motives in support of the break; but
quite off the rails in even mentioning
“the sale of pardons.” There is no
evidence to suggest that this played
any part in early 16th-century England.
My most serious quarrel with Mr.
Campbell is the question of whether
“during More’s time as head of the
Government several Protestants were
burned at the stake.” The most lengthy
treatment of this matter is R. W.
Chambers’ “Thomas More.” Chambers,
a non - Catholic, says clearly that in
all those troubled years that More was
in power, there is no evidence at all
that he imposed any death penalty for
heresy. While he was fallen from favor
but still theoretically in office, there
was an execution. After he was im-
prisoned, there were fifteen capital sen-
tences, for which he was not responsible.

The Rip
Permit me to bring to your notice an
error which appears in the article “Bat-
man’s Melbourne” (8., May 13) in
which he refers to The Rip as being
one-half mile wide. This is incorrect.
In the Victorian Year Book for 1966,
page 35, lines 3 and 4 state, “The Rip
is almost two miles wide; however the
navigable channel it only about seven-
tenths of a mile wide.”

No taxation
In the course of his excellent commen-
tary on the Kelly-type Post Office hold-
up (8., May 20), your Financial Editor
said: “Anyone who complains about
increased taxation or Government
charges is obliged by logic to suggest
what else the Government should do
about it.”
I accept the logic, in part, but as any
proposal I would offer is calculated
to have the effect of making the Gov-
ernment cut its own throat, it be-
comes for me a matter of not “What the
Government should do about it” but
“What we, the people, should do
about it.” And that is to accept
the principle that, while there is a
natural revenue of government con-
stantly arising out of society’s normal
engagement in production and exchange
known to economists as the economic
rent no government has the rid
to confiscate personal wealth, w jJ
by taxation, tariff or excise i mDo '
currency inflation or by any qT
form of interference with trade wh i
has the effect of simply raising Pri ;
to the consumer. ct
Acceptance of this principle J
enough people would have the eff
eventually of reducing government!
its proper role of guardian of j Usti
and peace within the realm and j!
defender against the remote possibilh
of aggression from without. |

Union with N.Z
New Zealand’s hand-wringing app rt .
hension about Britain’s almost-inevit.
able Common Market entry (Jj
May 20) is certainly justified. Financial
calamity threatens to climax a decade
of shaky tottering on the wrong side o!
the balance of payments equilibrium
Too small to industrialise, too far awai
to compete economically on the world)
markets, and too vulnerable in its er
ports, New Zealand proves tha:
viability depends on size and diver
sification of industry.
The obvious solution is that old
anathema to all New Zealanders: unioi
with Australia. And yet the advantages
of joining the Federation are surely
all New Zealand’s. The transition from
nationhood to statehood would be al
most entirely one of terminology. One
could imagine a New Zealand State
Premier sighing with relief as hi
divested himself of such irksome am
expensive burdens as defence, and in
tegrated the barely stable economy it
the common pool. New Zealand wouli
become one of the “big” States ii
terms of production and population,
with ten senators, and a big votim
block in the lower house.
The fact that the idea meets witl
resistance in New Zealand stems fron
a misunderstanding. They see them
selves being swallowed by the big fish
not as a seventh fish joining the shoal

Kelly reward
It seems a shame to spoil a coincident!
but the reward offered for the Ke
Gang was £BOOO and not £lO,OOO
Mr. Garry Shead would have v f
readers believe (8., May 27).
The reward was made up of £4O
from the Colony of Victoria,
from the Colony of New South vVa
and £lOOO from “certain banks W
ing within the colony” (of N.S.
according to a proclamation dated
February, 1879.
