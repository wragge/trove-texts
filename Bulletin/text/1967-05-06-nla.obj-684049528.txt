Hi
If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

Art on a pastoral
binge: wine, food,
and fantasy
THE GALLERY MOVEMENT is now
utterly rampant in Victoria. In the
old days the symbol of success was an
atrociously large city hall done in the
style of the Italian renaissance. City
halls are now out and you don’t rate
unless you have a noble art gallery
with a few Bunnys, a couple of Tom
Roberts, a Dobell, and a Nolan, at the
very least.
And to be fair, Eric Westbrook, the
National Gallery director, and the
Bolte Government are very good to this
movement.
They get their buildings subsidised
on a dollar-for-dollar basis plus annual
subsidies of around $2500 a year, and
the chances are that all this will be
improved next year.
So now there are ten excellent pro-
vincial galleries in Victoria and four
of these have full-time directors.
Perhaps the set-up at Hamilton is
the most splendid. They have an
$BOO,OOO gallery and the $600,000 Shaw
Collection. A grazier, Herbert B.
Shaw, died in 1957 and left this mar-
vellous collection, which ranged from
Roman glass and Grecian ceramics to
German silver. Sadly, though, nothing
was labelled and these past ten years
have been spent on discovering what
everything is.
Ballarat has been rebuilding its gal-
lery and will soon reopen. They have
300 Lindsay items, some really splendid
Norman Lindsay pictures, and a room
from the old family home at Creswick
donated by Mary Lindsay. You might
say, quite accurately, the Ballarat
gallery is a hotbed of Lindsays.
Mildura has the R. D. Elliott collec-
tion, which is loaded with Lrank
Brangwyns and William Orpens. While
one can go along with Brangwyns and
Orpens a little of the time, they have
a devil of a lot of them. Indeed, the
Mildura gallery is sometimes called
The Orpenage.
Mildura is a classic example of the
new prestige battle. There , was a
wrangle in council over whether the
city should have a city hall or a new
art gallery, and by only a narrow
majority, mercifully, the gallery won.
So Mildura, now, must be one of the
few cities anywhere that has no city
hall, but a really first-class art gallery.
To be precise, it is the Mildura Arts
Centre and it was opened on Novem-
ber 12 last year, and was last week
Herbert Flugelman, winner at Mildura ,
had his studio burnt out last May.
the locale for the third Mildura Prize
for Sculpture, won by Sydney sculptor
Herbert Flugelman, whose studio and
art collection were burnt out last May.
Your correspondent is agog with
admiration for Mildura, population
13,000, over this. It is now, by far,
the biggest event in sculpture in the
country. The city fathers and their
art director, Tom McCullough, talked
the Union Steamship Co. of New
Zealand into bringing over the N.Z.
entries. They managed to get two local
transport firms, Youngs and McGlash-
ens, to transport free all the sculpture
from the capital cities, and, by heavens,
some of them were heavy. Then, while
refusing BP a site for a service station,
they talked the company into giving
$l5OO for prizes.
And the roll-up was magnificent. As
one art director said: “Isn’t it nice?
Anybody who is anybody is here. It’s
just like the Adelaide Festival.”
A group of fun-loving local growers
called “the witchetty grub tribe” even
took Rudy Komon on a wichetty grub
hunt. Rudy became a fan and his eyes
literally glowed when he savored his
first grub. He said: “These would go
very well with a light, subtle, Rhine
riesling.” That’s the guts of the Abor-
iginal problem, the Aboriginals have
not been getting their witchetties with
Rhine riesling.
Your correspondent made a point of
collecting unforgettable quotes. He
is unused to be in a society so heady
with art. At a formal dinner he
heard: “Did you see the girl over there
in the gorgeous pre-Raphaelite gown?”
“No, I didn’t. I can’t stand anything
pre-Raphaelite.”
Then there was the art critic who
gazed off down the Murray through
the red gums and said: “Ahh, don’t you

think this country is frightfully Fred
Williams.”
Mystified local citizen: “Hey what’s
this Fred Williams business?”
Actually the citizens of Mildura were
madly enthusiastic. They thronged
through the gallery in such numbers
on the Sunday that James Mollison,
director of the Ballarat gallery, said:
“It’s wonderful. Imagine! People
actually queuing to see sculpture.”
Yet the mystification did run deep.
The city council bought two pieces for
$6OO and one councillor said: “Turn it
up. Give me a welding kit and I’ll do
a better job for ten bob.” The taxi
driver who took us to the exhibition
said of Herbert Flugelman’s “Eques-
trian,” Bft. high in cast iron: “There
y’are mate. What is it? I reckon it’s
two giraffes mating.”
There were three judges, Tom Mc-
Cullough, Laurie Thomas, and Dr.
Donald Brook. Dr. Brook, in announc-
ing the prizes, told of the dilemma
of the modern judge. He said: “There
are two very different types, betweep
which it is difficult to make comparison.
One is the type of sculpture of the
renaissance, humanist, expressive. You
can see into the soul of the artist. The
other is inexpressive. It doesn’t tell
you anything of the state of the artist’s
soul. You look at it. It’s just there.”
He pointed over to the riverbank
to a mountainous piece; of machinery:
“It’s just there, like Mr. Chaffey’s
marvellous pumping machine. You can
appreciate its beauty. Actually it should
be entered in the next competition. If
it were, we would have to consider it
seriously.”
We nodded our heads and bet that he
would, too.- One prizewinner was
“Phoenix II,” by Michael Kitching, of
Sydney. It consisted of a washing-
machine agitator with a Ford Thunder-
bird type tail-light in the middle, plus
a plastic umbilical cord, some
children’s play balls all surrounded
with a plumage of pink perspex.
Another prizewinner was “Slotzyman
and Slotzywoman,” by William Robert
Allen, of Auckland. They looked like
two Holden engines in love.
Another entry, which surely must
have got by the sifting-out judges, was
just four bits of 2 by 1 crudely nailed
together. It was called “One For Paul”
and courageously insured for $l3O.
One Saturday night Mildara Wines
threw a marvellous party for all at the
Merbein winery. There was turkey,
smoked ham, chicken washed down by
lovely white opal and Mildara
cabernet-shiraz ’64.: After that there was
a performance of three one-act plays
at the Mildura Arts Theatre. Not every-
body made it to the plays. There was a
gathering of art enthusiasts at ; the
Grand Hotel. Late in the evening they
took offence at the very post-garde
prints that adorn the walls of the
Grand and dumped them in the
swimming-pool.
The Grand was rather offended, but
the word is that the culprits will replace
them with something more avant.

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s

When XBX marks
the spot,
it's agony
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
WE ARE indebted to the Royal Can-
adian Air Force for a general seizing-up
of the long muscles of the back, the
buttocks, and the backs of the thighs.
But these are early days yet; and, pro-
vided the promised increase in flex-
ibility of the knee-joints appears by 7
a.m. tomorrow, it is possible, just
possible, that we shall be able to lower
our bony-framed body, covered in all
the wrong places with excess fat, face
down to the floor and have a go at
Exercise Six all over again.
The masochistic urge to do something
about physical fitness first arrived about
six months ago when, for reasons no
longer remembered, conversation at a
dinner-party took a rather personal
turn; that is, how awful one felt on
waking up, how difficult it was to get
up. And, having triumphed over that,
how murderous the day was to get
through anyway.
“What you need,” said the man sit-
ting opposite, one of those tall, lean
Australians who look ten years younger
than they really are, a sort of blond
Gregory Peck, “what you need is 58X.”
“No, darling,” said his wife, the type
people say can’t possibly have four
children, she looks so young, “it’s XBX
for girls.”
It sounded like a heppy drug, but it
turned out to be planned exercises
worked out by the Canadian Air Force
during the war for their flabby, lay-
about personnel, and now found suit-
able as a get-fit, stay-fit course for
today’s town dwellers, and published in
a 60 cent Penguin book called, incred-
ibly, “Physical Fitness.” (Why the
RCAF and none of the other armed
forces were sufficiently get-up-and-go,
or even caring enough to do this, is not
explained. One can only guess. This
is neither the time nor the place to
probe further.)
Well, one thing and another, XBX
slipped the mind. That could have
been the end of it but for the need
to kill ten minutes before an appoint-
ment, and there in a bookshop window
it stood. “Physical Fitness, SBX 11-
minute-a-day plan for men, XBX 12-
minute-a-day plan for women,” with a

It made extremely good reading. It
made you feel fit without doing the
exercises. Reader participation. Like
cookery books that turn you into
Cordon Bleu overnight with none of
the slog at the stove. “Research has
indicated that everyone male and
female, young and old is in need
of some form of regular, vigorous
physical activity.”
Of course. But, as the RCAF dis-
covered, there were three major deter-
rents to regular exercise: (1) people
would like to but didn’t know how to;
(2) most exercise programs called for
equipment and gymnasiums, not always
available; and (3) most exercise pro-
grams called for great expenditure of
time, which people couldn’t spare.
We discovered the fourth major
deterrent: lack of willpower to get
cracking.
In one way, the book itself encour-
ages procrastination.
The actual exercises look simple.
They are illustrated by sketches of a
faceless lady, age indeterminate, wear-
ing the same garment favored by our
old gym mistress, a cut-off leotard-
cum-knicker combination. She (the
faceless lady) could clearly do the
exercises in her sleep, but then she’d
not have to devote hours to working
out her chart.
What the RCAF requests one to do is
find one’s level. That is, the goal one
is struggling to achieve. The instruc-
tions how to do this are there, cer-
tainly, but designed for a brain less
flabby than ours. By the time we under-
stood “if you are 28 years of age, your
goal is level 30 on Chart Three and
you spend at least two days doing each
level on Chart One, three days at each
level on Chart Two, and five days at
each level on Chart Three” we found
the advice “Do not move faster than
the recommended rate” rather point-
less.
Added to which there are some
brutal facts to face about age: the older
you are, the less you should do, or no
one else can be held responsible.
Two things finally got us going. The
provocative sentence (ladies’ section
only): “Much of what is considered fat-
ness in the abdominal region is nothing
more than weak stomach muscles which
permit the internal organs to sag for-
ward.” Plus an irresistible chart for the
exercisee to fill in herself, entitled “MY
PROGRESS” and including person-
alised headings like “MY AIM” and
“COMMENTS.”
However, after yesterday’s session,
we are looking for a loophole. The book
provides a splendid one. “If you have
any doubt as to your capability to
undertake this program, see your

Ours, thank heaven, has shot off to

The modest
loner of
her generation
IF THE TEMPERAMENT of stars
is missing from the make-up of the
Australian actress, it is equally lacking
in some of our sportswomen —notably
Heather McKay, nee Blundell, for six
years champion woman squash player
of the world.
Last year Lance Tingay, a former
top player and now sports writer for
the London “Daily Telegraph,” de-
scribed her as “the outstanding squash
player of her generation and possibly
of all time.” And “The Times” said
“. . . she may be the finest woman
squash racket player the game has
ever known.”
A slim, attractive girl of 25 with a
ready smile and a completely offhand
manner, Heather takes all this as it
comes. "Winning in Britain is actually
Heat her McKay.. a four-dollar prize
winning the world title,” she says
matter-of-factly. “They play a different
squash in America.”
She works at a city squash court.
(“There’s no money in squash. I’ll
tell you that straight off. The most
I’ve ever won was an open order for
four dollars in England.”) Here she
answers the phone, hands out towels,
takes bookings, gives change or in-
struction as the case may be, and occa-
sionally practises.
She seems to be quite unimpressed
with herself. No, she has not been
beaten in a competition for six years.
Yes, she won from John Haines, a top
player in Hong Kong, and with other
women in her team defeated a crack
Danish men’s team.
She dismisses all this with a wave
of her hand. “Men can usually win,
though. I play against men all the time
when I’m practising. They can usually
run me ragged just their sheer phy-
sical strength wins.”
Her husband, Bryan McKay, who
plays squash at N.S.W. grade level, can
beat her, she concedes tactfully.
Born in Oueanbeyan, in the midst
of a family of 11, Heather can’t re-
member any great sportswomen in the
family except an aunt who was famous
for riding. “Though everyone was
pretty sporty,” she recalls. She began
playing squash to keep fit for her
hockey team, liked it immediately, and
16 months later was playing for Aus-
tralia.
She seemed surprised to be asked
if she had a “killer instinct,” to win
no matter what happened. “I think
most Australians like to be as good
as they can be in anything.”
Despite the impact she has made in
the squash world, she still plays hockey
(left inner for N.S.W.) and is a bit
distressed that the two seasons clash.
Very shy on her first overseas tours
and described by the British Press as
a “loner,” she has gradually acquired
a sort of friendly poise, and this year
was daring enough to wear a skirt in-
stead of shorts on to the squash court.
Her growing fame is something she
can’t handle easily.
“When I came home to Australia
this time I couldn’t believe that all the
reporters were waiting for me. They
asked me thousands of questions—but
in the end they used only a few
paragraphs. I couldn’t help feeling if
that was all they wanted they needn’t
have asked me so many questions.”
She enjoyed the travelling, though,
and felt that she saw more this time.
“We went on tour —so it wasn’t all
squash courts.
“I get a bit sick of squash, because
I play for about nine months of the
year in competition,” she says. “The
Australian competitions finish just as
the British ones start. I’ll probably
play for a couple more years and then
give it up. I’d like to retire un-
defeated.”
As none of the British players seem
to be able to touch her and she has
beaten Anne Craven-Smith, her nearest
rival, 30 times, she should almost cer-
tainly be. able to do this.
Will there be anyone to take her
place when she does retire?
“Oh, yes. In Sydney alone there are
150 women’s teams of four and count-
less thousands of girls who just play.
They won’t miss me for long.”
DISCUS


THE ONLY THING
EXPENSIVE ABOUT
THESE WINES
IS THE TASTE
It's a wonderful thing to be able to
find a wine that is more-ishly
quaffable and at the same time
inexpensive.
Both light, delicate Miamba Hock,
and smooth, soft Miamba Claret
with its appealing finish, are
extremely well made wines —the
top show awards they have won,
both overseas and in Australia, are
evidence of this.
But both are moderately priced as
well as being very, very quaffable.
See for yourself!

Wine of the month:
Mud Flat
strikes again
A LITTLE over a year ago I recom-
mended the Saltrams ’62 claret Bin 33.
Though the wines of W. Salter and
Sons were not widely known it sold
very quickly. Gratifyingly, many people
who were introduced to the Saltrams
style by this particular wine for the
first time were eager for more and
became regular correspondents and fans
of the winemaker, Peter Lehmann.
In that article I suggested that Mr.
Lehmann was “a cheerful light heavy-
weight with a face lined like a dried
mud flat.” Since then he has been
called “Mud Flat” by his friends.
The top wine of the next vintage
was Bin 37. This was made of 25
percent Cabernet, 55 percent Shiraz
and 20 percent Tokay. The wine was
light and matured quickly. It had a
good, firm, soft tannin, but the flavor
was not as complex as that of the
previous year. The Tokay, added at the
crusher and fermented together with
the other grapes, somehow seemed to
me to reduce the overall quality of the
wine. Remember that the Saltram
wines of ten years ago were big gutsy
wonders; in seeking the lighter style,
perhaps they went too far. I didn’t
think it a worthy “Wine of the Month”
for you.
But in 1964 Success!
Mud Flat strikes again!
The pick of the ’64 wines is the
Bin 39. It has a definite link in charac-
ter with the Bin 33, though I feel per-
haps it is even better. The flavor is
complex, the tannin firm and soft, and
the bouquet will undoubtedly develop
with bottle age.
At the moment it has the strong
aroma of top-quality Cabernet. It is
made from 25 percent Cabernet and
75 percent Shiraz. In some ways it
is a historic wine, for the pick of the
Shiraz comes from “Above the Line,”
the small vineyard over 100 years old
which still exists above the railway
line that runs through the property.
Last year half of this vineyard was
grubbed out for reconstituting and
replanting and this year the remaining
half will go. So gather ye fruits of
viticultural aristocrats while ye may.
The rest of the Shiraz grapes are
purchased mostly from the Eden Val-
ley. The Shiraz from this area is of
great quality and makes clean, delicate

wines of excellent flavor and good
acid.
The Shiraz is the quality workhorse
of Australian red wine. I am not con-
vinced that straight Cabernets are the
ultimate answer. I believe that some
of the best claret wines of Australia
will be made from a combination of
these two grapes.
Although we have seen some simply
good straight Cabernets, many have
been disappointing. After years of
maturation the tannin remains pro-
nounced, even harsh, and often the
delightful floral aroma is obscured.
Sometimes there is a thinness at the
back of the palate that emphasises
even more the acerbitic finish. The
Big Dipper of the palate!
These wines also lack “suppleness,”
that fluid, harmonic characteristic of
so many of the top Bordeaux reds.
How do the French achieve this
quality? By blending!
Cabernet Sauvignon has the won-
derful quality of imposition. Blended
in with other grapes it will take over
and assert its flavors and best charac-
teristics whilst quietly allowing its own
deficiencies to be overcome. Unfor-
tunately, one percent of Cabernet to
99 percent Shiraz still technically
allows a winemaker to call a wine
Cabernet Shiraz. Perhaps one day the
industry will draft its own code of
minimum proportions.
Incidentally, the Shiraz which came
to us from France originated in Persia.
In France it is called the Syrah and
the Sirha. Yet there are Persian rugs
called Shiraz. I asked Denis Croneen,
the rug expert, to explain the coincid-
ence. “The village of Shiraz is a
market-place for certain tribal rugs. I
understand the grape also originated
there. Australia spells the word cor-
rectly.”
But enough of erudition. Back to
the stuff in the glass. Salters grow
almost all their own Cabernet and
over 30 acres will be in bearing next
year. This, averaging two tons per acre
at 130 odd gallons per ton, means a
total of 8000 gallons a year. Blend in
with 75 percent Shiraz and we have
30,000 gallons or almost 200,000 bottles
made available each year. Good News
Week.
Their wines are now selling very
well, indeed. Note that last year I
recommended a four-year-old wine,
whereas this year it is a three-year-old
red. I suggest that you will have to
jnature these wines to get the benefit
from them. They are not clarets or
burgundies, but full-flavored firm red
wines of Australia, reminiscent of
the top-quality Rhone wines.
At the recent Barossa Valley auction,
the Saltram wines sold particularly
well at from $2.50 to $4.00 per bottle
for wines from seven to ten years old.
Speculator in his present bearish mood
could well look into the investment
value of wine.
Meanwhile, back at the winery,
Peter Lehmann continues to make this
true Barossa style and I hope in the
future to be able to recommend other
of his wines.


Is it a sideways sandwich?

No. It’s a detail of one of the anodised
aluminium spandrel panels on the new
Northern & Employers Group building
at 446-452 Collins Street, Melbourne.
It’s quite a story. The problem was how
to distinguish this new office from its
neighbours . . . how to make it stand
out from the other tile-and-glass
buildings. The architects (Godfrey &
Spowers Hughes, Mewton & Lobb) had
the idea of translating a series of
spandrel panels into a dramatic, con-
temporary metal sculpture. The metal ?
Tough, light, corrosion-resistant Alcoa
aluminium box extrusion. The extrusion
was cut lengthwise, leaving a burnt
uneven finish. The sections were anodised,
and mounted on Alcoa channel extrusion.
Then the nine panels were fixed to the
southern and eastern walls at mezzanine
floor level. It was a complete success!
Next time you’re in Collins Street, have
a look at this distinguished building.
See what can be done with Alcoa
aluminium and a bit of imagination.

AS I SEE IT
Our race for time
against the
British ebb tide
BY ALAN REID
THERE ARE THOSE in Australia who
believe that trying to persuade Britain
to stay out of the European Common
Market (except under conditions that
protect Australian interests) and to stay
militarily in Singapore and Malaysia
is about as realistic as Canute ordering
the tide not to come in.
Since 1962 when the then Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, battled,
with temporary success, to ensure that
Britain’s entry into ECM would be onl\
under conditions which protected Aus-
tralian interests, I have believed that
Britain, ultimately, would go into ECM
whatever the conditions regarding its
former dominions and territories, and
that it would withdraw militarily from
Singapore and Malaysia, even if the
local Governments there (as has be-
come the case) wanted it to stay.
Against this background, the next
logical thing for me to say is that Prime
Minister Harold Holt is wasting his time
and energy in visiting Washington and
London during June to persuade first
President Johnson into supporting his
case for retention of the British pre-
sence in Singapore and Malaysia and
second, Harold Wilson into continuing
the British presence.
But there is value in these exercises,
as Menzies’ ECM pilgrimage in 1962
shows clearly. Such exercises might not
win the point for Australia that Aus-
tralia wants to win, but they win time.
And time in politics can be very
valuable.
In 1962, Australia would have been
in a quite serious economic mess if
Britain had gone into ECM without
steps being taken to protect Australian
interests. Menzies, a shrewd old cam-
paigner, did not flatly oppose British
entry into ECM. He probably agreed
with those among the British who
argued that it was in Britain’s long term
interest to go into ECM. So what he
did was ask the British to do something
which was quite reasonable. This was
not to go into ECM until it had pro-
cured conditions of entry that would not
be damaging to its old, traditional
trading partners among which were
Australia, New Zealand, and others to
which Britain had a sentimental
attachment.
In other words, he created a situa-
tion in which Britain asked for con-
ditions of entry which enabled France’s
General De Gaulle to turn thumbs
down on British entry at that point of
time.
This gave Australia breathing space.
It was not without significance that the
Japanese Trade Treaty (signed origin-
ally in 1957) was renegotiated in 1963.
Within the space of a few years, Japan
became Australia’s biggest market for
wool, coal, sugar, and copper, and a
substantial market for wheat.
A major wheat trade was developed
with Communist China. New institu-
tions, such as the Exports Payments
Corporation and the Export Develop-
ment Council, were created, with the
emphasis upon the developing countries
and markets of Asia and South-East
Asia, rather than Britain, the historic
market.
Time, that great curative of so many
political headaches, worked in Austra-
lia’s favor. Immense deposits of iron
ore were found. It is again not with-
out significance that the Government
worked with unusual energy to de-
Holt's mission: to bargain for time . . .
velop markets for these deposits and
the coal that would be used in pro-
cessing them. Knowledge that British
entry into ECM was around a possibly
not too distant corner intensified efforts
to find a cushion to the adverse effects
when the corner was ultimately turned.
Britain remained both an important
customer and supplier. Trade patterns
as long established as those between
Australia and Britain change over the
years, but they do not disappear over-
night. But though still important,
Britain’s entry into ECM from now on
is less important that it would have
been in 1962.
I think Holt believes (though he will
never admit it publicly) that it is an
impossibility to persuade Britain to re-
tain a significant presence indefinitely
in Singapore and Malaysia, despite its
original statement that it would stay
there as long as the local Governments
would permit (and the local Govern-
ments are hot only willing but anxious
for Britain to stay).
As Holt sees it, the British Govern-
ment, under heavy pressure economi-
cally and as regards sterling (and not
doing too well electorally), may view
itself as in a position in which it has
two choices. The first choice is with-
drawal or substantial reduction in its
military establishments east of Suez.
The other choice involves the pros-
pect that if the military establishments
are left untouched it will be faced with
mounting unemployment at home, and
even the possibility of a reduction in
British living standards. A realist him-
self, Holt has no illusions about which
will be the choice if a choice has to be
made in those black and white terms.
What Holt wants to buy is time so
that arrangements can be made about
what is to fill the vacuum when Britain
withdraws.
This approach is not entirely selfish,
though there is undoubtedly Aus-
tralian self interest involved, as Britain
itself has conceded (in its White Paper
on defence). South-East Asia is the
area of the world which represents
probably the greatest threat to world
stability. If world stability is disturbed,
. . . Wilson cant keep Britain in Asia
Britain gets involved. That is inevitable.
So it is in Britain’s self interest if there
is to be a withdrawal to stage it in a
fashion that will enable the substitu-
tion of an acceptable alternative to the
present British presence in the area.
Holt also believes quite genuinely
—that Britain, accepted in the area,
exercises a moral influence out of pro-
portion to its place in modern power
politics.
I personally do not believe that Holt
or anyone else can dissuade Britain
from disentangling itself from South-
East Asia. But it is possible that Holt
can be a factor in deciding the rate of
disentanglement and the shape of the
force or forces that will substitute for
the British presence.
This, basically, is his task in London
and Washington. It will be interesting
to see whether he can bring it to a
successful conclusion.

AUSTRALIA
Britain’s SEATO Commitment
IN A WEEK IN WHICH top Can-
berra policy-makers concerned them-
selves mainly with the stepped-up
British pull-out from Singapore and
Malaysia, the central concern was with
the British commitment to SEATO.
This is, in effect, what the Common-
wealth Strategic Reserve is mainly
about and the primary question is that
the Reserve should not be allowed to
run down so low that it would be use-
less in an emergency.
SEATO’s contingency plans for any
outbreak of warfare in Laos or north-
east Thailand provide for the Reserve
to be among the first forces in action.
According to the plans its men must
be on the ground and fighting within
72 hours. This is why it matters that
it should be stationed in South-East
Asia. It could not be put together from
all over the place and flown to South-
East Asia in 72 hours. The British have
repeatedly, if somewhat reluctantly,
affirmed their commitment to these
plans. By inference they have recog-
nised that tampering with the Strategic
Reserve would be tantamount to with-
drawal from SEATO.
This is the principal demand the
American Government makes of the
British and it was clear in Canberra
that the Australian Government will
use all the diplomatic and propaganda
weapons it can find to back American
pressure. Mr. Holt has already got an
assurance from the British Prime
Minister that he will not make any
more retrenchment without discussion.
To a man, Canberra officials oppose
the idea already suggested by the
British, that they might withdraw t<>
forward bases in Australia. These just
would not be forward enough. And
while the British presence in Singapore
and Malaysia has a good psychological
effect, a pull-out to Australia would be
just as bad as a pull-back to Britain.
Road toll
What went wrong?
LAST WEEK AUSTRALIA was well
on the way to maintaining its annual
road toll of more than 3000 dead. More
than 70 children, women, and men,
young and old, died on the roads
during the 10 days which included
Anzac Day. If 70 Australians were
killed in one or more domestic air-
line crashes over the same period we
would be shocked. If we lost three
battalions of soldiers in Vietnam this
year as we will lose their equivalent
in civilians it might cause a political
crisis. But road deaths are a war we
cannot stop, or even abate.
After Victoria’s 10-day toll had
mounted to 34 (“the worst figures in
Victorian motoring history”), police
called a shock conference in Melbourne,
but within two days the toll had risen
to 40, including 17 deaths during a
five-day police “blitz” on road offend-
ers. “We cannot work out what went
wrong at the weekend,” said Superin-
tendent Wright, of the Victoria
Police Traffic Branch. The only help-
ful clue was that eight of the 17 dead
during the “blitz” period had been
young drivers. Driver education in
secondary schools was an immediate
suggestion as it has been for many
years.
Labor MHR Gordon Bryant, taking
part in the Victorian election, told a
meeting in Horsham there should be a
special force of 2-3000 to tackle the
main problem, speed, policing it as
vigorously as the bushfire prevention
campaign. In the Medical Journal of
Australia, a N.S.W. doctor with long
experience in attending roadside
accidents said 5 to 20 percent of the
victims could be saved with rapid medi-
cal attention and suggested roving
ambulance teams on country roads.
In cities, quick attention
But most “ fatals ” are on country roads
The Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon,
favored compulsory seat belts.
There were other views. A Western
Australian newspaper asked for more
information about causes of accidents
(if speed was a factor, did road design
or surface come into it, was vision
obscured by anything, and why was
the driver speeding?) and also ques-
tioned other deficiencies in statistical
information. In Queensland, with 15
Anzac weekend dead (average age, 27)
and a Labor Day long weekend coming,
Acting Police Commissioner Palethorpe
said, “Excessive speeding . . . 3000
policemen for 150,000 miles of roads.”
The discussion went on, but although
the deathroll is worse than war’s, there
was no possibility that it would be met
on a wartime footing.
Labor
Better candidates
EVERY TIME OPPOSITION leader
Mr. Gough Whitlam papers over a
crack in ALP unity people with long
fingernails tear the paper. The Murphy
incident is the latest tear.
Senator Lionel Murphy, QC, is
Labor’s new Senate Leader. Under
normal ALP circumstances he would
need have no fears of not being en-
dorsed as Labor candidate for the
Senate elections (due later this year
or early next). The very fact that he
was Senate Leader would secure him
endorsement when candidates were pre-
selected in N.S.W. by ballot on June 18.
But the ALP’s circumstances at the
moment are not normal. Senator
Murphy is not assured of automatic
selection. Instead, very powerful forces
within the N.S.W. ALP are trying to get
his pre-selection taken away from him.
The move against Murphy is part
ideological, part personal. The N.S.W.


executive is Right Wing. In a move
which revealed clearly that the paper
over the ALP cracks was not yet of an
enduring quality, the N.S.W. ALP
executive recently lost to the Federal
executive on the AICD membership
issue to give the Left Wing its biggest
victory in the ALP for months.
Murphy was elected Senate Leader
with the support of those who were
largely responsible for producing that
ALP Federal executive decision. This
and Murphy’s consistent support for
Arthur Calwell during the struggles for
the Labor leadership have not warmed
the hearts of some N.S.W. executive
members toward Murphy.
Apparently the anti-Murphy faction
is going to considerable trouble to
attempt to muster numbers against him.
Several branches which were likely to
elect Murphy supporters to the Senate
Selection College are said to have been
“rubbed out” as lacking the minimum
15 financial members necessary to sus-
tain an ALP branch. Other branches
likely to support the election of dele-
gates hostile to Murphy are reported
to have been resuscitated.
To the argument that Murphy should
not lose his Senate pre-selection because
he is now Labor’s Senate Leader, those
working against him point out that
Murphy won his Senate pre-selection
by beating John Armstrong, then a
Senator, a former Deputy Senate
Leader, and now Lord Mayor of
Sydney.
Armstrong is now one of the 45
N.S.W. Federal Electoral Council dele-
gates who will decide who will be
Labor’s banner bearers at the next
Senate elections.
Those opposing Murphy are pro-
ducing a further argument that
Murphy showed no mercy to Don
Willesee, W.A., who, elected Senate
Labor Leader a few months before the
last Federal elections, went down to
Murphy in the post-election Caucus
ballots with his capacity as a leader
still untested.
The controllers of the N.S.W. ALP
hostile to Murphy want as Labor’s three
pre-selected candidates for the Senate
elections Senator Joe Fitzgerald, a
Labor stalwart who once held the
House of Representatives seat of Phillip,
Mrs. Kath Anderson, undoubtedly one
of the ALP’s most able ladies, and Mr.
Clive Healy, who had close associations
with quite a few of the present N.S.W.
executive.
Senator Doug McClelland, 41 this
year and the youngest of the N.S.W.
group in the Senate, also seems slated
for the “dump” on this line-up, though
the only real grievance the N.S.W.
ALP controllers could have for wanting
him out is that he supported Calwell
against Whitlam.
The fight is undoubtedly bitter, with
some quite big ALP names working
furiously behind the scenes in an
attempt to prevent Murphy, particu-
larly, and McClelland (less fiercely)
from getting ALP selection. But
the Senate, though comfortable, is
a dead-end for a politician. Only a
handful of Senators can rise to
Ministerial rank. It would be a
good idea for the major parties to
use the Senate as a training ground
rather than as a rest home, making
Senators eligible to transfer when a
suitable House of Representatives seat
becomes available.
At the College which assembles on
June 18 to select Labor’s candidates for
the Senate elections the ALP might look
at this proposition. They could do
something worth while for the electors
by ensuring a better supply of Par-
liamentary - trained candidates for
Representatives.
Federal Education and Science Minister
Senator Gorton
Education
The teacher gap
WOULD YOU RATHER send your
older children to school four days a
week, or five half-days? The question
could arise soon in a nation short of
fully trained and qualified secondary
school teachers; with school buildings
lagging behind the annual student in-
crease; and students staying longer at
school. The four-day week has already
been tried at one school in Morwell,
Victoria, with resulting improvement
in the pass rate. South Australian
teachers are considering a proposal of
their own for the five-half-day scheme,
with the school day broken into two
shifts between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., allow-
ing twice as many students to use the
school buildings. The curriculum would
be divided into academic and elected
subjects, and would allow Education
Departments to use “short part-timers”
(married ex-teachers with school age
children).
Neither of these schemes was men-
tioned at last week’s conference between
the Australian Teachers’ Federation
(80,000 members) and the Federal
Minister for Education, Senator Gorton,
but the shortage of teachers and school
accommodation were, forcefully. So was
the need for ancillary buildings for
libraries, language laboratories, other
audio and visual aid rooms, gymnasi-
ums, and assembly rooms. It was a
“listen and note” conference. In one
of the hottest (as far as public pressure
is concerned) seats in Cabinet, Senator
Gorton had to reply, “It is a question
of priorities. If we were to extend this,
we would have to deny that.” The
teachers said that Australia’s allocation
for education was less than four percent
of Gross National Product, against a
desirable figure of five or six percent,
and suggested higher taxes.
Hardly had Teachers’ president Gavin
Semple returned to his home State,
Queensland, than its Government
became the first to agree to appoint a
special committee to review teacher
i ducation, including two Queensland
Teachers’ Union representatives, two
l-ducation Professors, a new Director
"f Teacher Education, and two
Teachers’ College principals.
The idea was good, the quick decision
indicated that the Government was very
• iware of the problem, but there was
mie catch the finding would have
io be “in relation to the needs and
resources of the State.” That would
merely put the ball back into Senator
Gorton’s court.
Natural gas
Boomerang
CHANCES OF SYDNEY using natural
gas from Victoria by the hoped-for
date, early in 1970, if at all, took the
wrong turn last week and could now
depend on whether Victoria climbs
down on the asked price.
Based on the starting price (ex the
Esso-BHP processing plant for natural
gas at Sale) of three cents a therm in
the initial years of a 20-year contract
with the Gas and Fuel Corporation, the
cost of Bass Strait gas to Sydney would
be four cents a therm. Having caught
the high-priced boomerang Sir Henry
Bolte had thrown N.S.W.’s way, Mr.
W. W. Pettingell, general manager ot
the Australian Gas Light Company,
looked at the tag and said, “Too high
by half.” In his view the starting price
being paid by Victoria itself was from
33 to 40 percent more than commer-
cially justified, both on international
comparisons and on the possibilities of
expanding consumption; particularly,
say, in competition with black oils.
The comment caught Sir Henry
Bolte on the raw a few days before
last Saturday’s election and the Opposi-
tion Leader, Clive Stoneham, was quick
to rub it in with a promise that if
elected the ALP would renegotiate the
price agreement. In his turn A. E.


W. W. Pettingell... “too high by half.”
Chadwick, chairman of the Gas and
Fuel Corporation, backed Bolte by say-
ing he believed the price being paid
to Esso-BHP was quite reasonable.
The question is really, “how reason-
able?” In the U.S., which uses huge
quantities of gas at Government-
dictated rock bottom prices, the dis-
covery of new natural gas reserves is
falling behind the depletion of old
ones. The low U.S. price of natural
gas has had similar effects on oil search
expenditure there, and consequently
has slowed the location of new reserves
of crude oil. What is reasonable has
obviously to be interpreted much more
widely than Pettingell appears to admit.
Equally, “reasonable” has to be in-
terpreted on the possible effects too
high a price will have on consumption
of natural gas. To start with a high
price, as the present one is, only frac-
tionally lower than that for manufac-
tured town gas, seems at odds with the
aim of stimulating consumption. On this
aspect Mr. Pettingell’s market research
has to be respected. The argument in
Victoria is that the price will be reduced
with the expansion of consumption
overall. But this may well be to be
putting the cart before the horse. If
Victoria is to get the expansion of the
market it is looking for to justify a
reduction in the price of its natural
gas it will be relying heavily on inter-
state consumption.
Toward the end of the week Mr.
Pettingell threw the boomerang back
into the wind with a statement that
N.S.W. would prefer to buy natural
gas from an on-shore source, anyway.
He intimated that off-shore supplies
might suffer pipeline interruptions, and
envisaged a future in which all of Aus-
tarlia’s natural gas sources were linked
and drawn on according to ability to
supply. Queensland, with producing
wells and further possible fields,
listened closely to a buyer who seemed
to be shopping around.
Space tracking
Strict control
SPACE CENSORSHIP may be too
broad a term to describe the lack of
local news from Tidbinbilla, but cer-
tainly Australian newsmen were feeling
left out in the cold by the end of the
week. While America’s Surveyor Three
spent a quiet week scratching away at
the surface of the moon and taking
pictures of an eclipse in reverse, some
form of U.S. control was smudging
the Australian records of the little space
craft’s historic achievements.
Prior to Surveyor Three’s launching,
control at J.P.L. (the Jet Propulsion
Laboratories, at Pasadena, California)
informed the Space Track network
throughout the world that local news
sources could only be briefed on “stat-
ion activity.”
Release of reports of the feats of
Surveyor Three itself were the preroga-
tive of Control, and network stations
could only release news of this nature
after J.P.L. had released it first.
Tidbinbilla received its share of pho-
tographs of the first digging operations
on the moon, and the first pictures of
the eclipse as seen for the first time by
man from the moon. But not a single
photograph was taken by an Australian
news photographer from the 23in. tele-
vision screen at Tidbinbilla for local
consumption.
Trade unions
Administration
BY THE STANDARDS of almost all
other Western countries Australian
unions are both penurious and ineffi-
cient. The latter largely because of
the former.
The Melbourne Trades Hall Council
is broke, or as the secretary of the
THC and representative of more than
400,000 workers, Mr. Mick Jordan, said
in his circular to Melbourne trade
union officials “the THC is resorting to
the techniques of a bankrupt in order
to remain in business” —to justify his
executive’s decision to ask for a 110
percent increase in affiliation fees.
The Trades Hall Council last raised
its affiliation fees in November, 1954.
In the past 13 years administration costs
have risen by 107 percent. The result
is that the THC showed a bank balance
of $6317 for the second week in April
and outstanding debts of $12,633. The
Trades Hall is also without funds to
meet the problems of capital reserves
and payment of loans.
Mr. Jordan and his executive have
proposed raising parking fees in their
building and, for the first time, charg-
ing the Victorian Labor Party rent for
their rooms as part of their program
for becoming financially solvent.
Members of the ALP Central Execu-
tive on the THC objected to all of
these proposals and joined with Com-
munist and other Left-wing delegates
in walking out of the Hall when they
were announced.
The Left Wing has been planning a
strong comeback at the Melbourne
Trades Hall for some months. The
groundwork for their campaign has
lain in charges that Jordan and his sup-
porters are not militant enough in tak-
ing industrial action and that they are
working with members of the DLP.
The financial problems of the present
administration give the Left its chance
to link up ideological politics with
an economic super-strata. They know
that Australian union members have
not yet learnt the lesson that a more
efficient union secretariat is necessary
for more skilled collective bargaining
and approaches to arbitration, nor
that compared with countries such
as the United States, Canada, and
West Germany Australians pay only 20
percent of what is regarded as the
minimum fee necessary for effective
union administration.
Victoria
Party adrift
THE VICTORIAN COUNTRY Party
has supported Labor Governments and
Liberal Governments and been sup-
ported by both in turn. It has won
some benefits for its supporters in the
laying of roads and railway tracks, but
its signature-word “decentralisation”
has never been backed by much solid
thinking or planned policy-making. In
many ways it has seemed less pro-
decentralisation than anti-city.
Apart from its policy weaknesses the
Victorian Country Party has revealed,
over the past few years, a mounting
ineptness in tactical skills. Last Satur-
day’s election was only the most recent
instance. Some months before the elec-
tion Party leaders were predicting that
they would pick up a possible eight
seats from Liberal and Labor. Against
the Bolte Government they could claim
there had been misspending of public
moneys; that educational facilities were
not keeping pace with the State’s needs;
that country people could expect little
benefit from the natural gas discoveries.
The Country Party’s hopes were
further raised by the ALP’s decision to
grant it second preferences. Then dis-
aster set in. The DLP decided to back
the Liberal Party in return for the
promise of $2.5 million aid for inde-
pendent schools. Next, the daily Press
claimed that the Country Party had
decided to give its preferences to Labor.
Before this was officially confirmed or
denied three Country Party candidates
objected and said that Labor would not

The Country Party leadership tried to
end the confusion by creating the new
concept of the double-sided ticket. One
side gave its preferences to Liberal, the
other side to Labor. The new model
how-to-vote card piled turmoil on con-
fusion. More Country Party candidates
objected, Sir Henry Bolte sneered, and
a substantial proportion of the elec-
torate laughed.
Communist Party
Subtle change
TWO -COMMUNIST LEADERS in
Western Australia retired last week and
this may foreshadow a new shakeout
in the Party throughout Australia. Sam
Aarons (71) and his 38-year-old pro-
tege Rivo Gandini were frank, as
far as they went, in explaining their
departure on the eve of the Party’s
annual conference in W.A. “Much
of the Party’s policy and organi-
sation has tended to be unsuitable
for modern Australia,” said Mr. Gan-
dini, fed up after 13 years as a full-time
official. “A lot of problems are caused
by 1930-type thinking. In the past we
have modelled ourselves far too much
on overseas Communist ideas.”
The Moscow-Peking rift that split
branches in other States did not affect
the West, and this adds weight to the
theory that the Aarons-Gandini retire-
ments are not connected with this
directly, but are tied up more with a
third road being hewn out on the far
Left by Melbourne’s Rex Mortimer.
This is in line with the Italian doc-
trine which is halfway between Russian
co-existence and Chinese militancy . . .
a doctrine that seeks a more logical and
more rapid progress by making the
maximum impact on a community.
They seek to forget flag-waving so they
can get on with the job of wooing to
new-line Communism those who want
Left-wing socialism without being
tagged “Communist.”
Gandini hinted that such develop-
ments might come to a head at the
national congress in Sydney next month
when he said he felt some basic changes
were coming to the Party which had
been consistently rejected by the elec-
torate but had made some progress in
trade unions.
And this is backed up by other de-
velopments: the 30-year-old Party
theoretical monthly, “Communist Re-
view,” recently changed to a bi-
monthly, “Australian Left Review;” the
“Tribune” has also shed the word
“Communist” from its banner.

New Zealand
BAC or Boeing?
Britain’s Lord Brown ... too late
NEW ZEALAND IS facing a decision
familiar to Australians of having to
decide between American and British
aircraft for its internal airline services
as it moves to the pure jet stage.
This has turned into a guessing game
which has been going on for more
than a year. New Zealand’s internal
airline, National Airlines Corporation,
favored the Boeing 737 more than
12 months ago, when it was still on
the drawing-board. NAC chairman
Sir Andrew McKee said that three
Boeings at just over £N.Z.5|m. would
be a better buy for the nation’s very
short haul requirements than four of
Britain’s 1-1 Is at £N.Z.6,601,000 to
replace NAC’s Viscounts.
However, the British Aircraft Cor-
poration sent top representatives to New
Zealand to make a strong sales bid.
They pointed out that the BAC 1-11
pure jet had been flying commercially
since April 1965 and more than 100
had been sold. They took full-page
newspaper advertisements to give the
public their side of the argument.
The general manager of NAC, Mr.
Douglas Patterson, said that if New
Zealand did not have a pure jet fleet
soon it would have to buy six Viscounts
now and another four in 1968-69 to
keep pace with traffic expectations.
The N.Z. Airline Pilots’ Association
executive said it had every confidence
in the ability of NAC’s evaluating
team to pick the right aircraft for
New Zealand’s requirements.
Still the Government and its Com-
mission delayed a final decision. The
latest move by the British manufacturer
probably too late was seen in
the arrival in Wellington last month
of Lord Brown, Minister of State for
the United Kingdom Board of Trade,
with new proposals for financial
arrangements and the latest on the
merits of the BAC 1-11. Finally,
Douglas of America made a late run
on behalf of its DC9, which Australia
has bought. Douglas’ salesmen hoped
only to sell their aircraft if Boeing
failed to live up to promise in its
tests. It seemed that Britain didn’t
have a chance, even in New Zealand.

COMMENT
Britain East of the Common Market
IT DEPENDS from what point in
time you look at the British retrench-
ments in Singapore and Malaysia
whether you see a hasty pull-out or a
miracle of British steadfastness. If you
choose the present, you see the British
cutting their forces by 20,000 to a mere
30,000. If you looked at the present
situation from the position prevailing
before Sukarno’s crazy confrontation,
you would be amazed that the British
had slightly increased their forces in
Singapore and Malaysia to 30,000. It
might seem extraordinary that they
were still there at all.
What the British are now keeping in
Singapore and Malaysia may be
enough for the purpose. The naval and
air bases will still operate; the way is
open for immediate reinforcement; the
psychological effect of a British
presence will be maintained; the
British have shown the Americans that
they still have an interest in the area,
even if they duck participation in the
Vietnam war. It is not the present
arrangements one is concerned about,
but what is going to happen next? Will
British forces be again reduced? Will
they pull out altogether?
What should we say to the British,
when we urge them to continue an
interest in the area? Let us not, for
heavens sake, talk about ourselves, but
about the future of the people in the
sub-continent of South-East Asia. Mr.
Hasluck said some of what should be
said in his statement at the SEATO
meeting in Washington: “A lack of
interest in Asia today is isolationism
in its most feckless form. Withdrawal
from or lack of interest in Asia are
very close to being withdrawal from
world affairs.” Mr. Holt also said
some of what should be said when, on
returning from his recent tour, he recog-
nised that the social revolution in
South-East Asia reflects long-suppressed
yearnings for national identity, social
betterment, and economic progress of
a kind that we also seek.
Our spokesmen should make it clear
that it is our concern that the nearly
300 million people of South-East Asia
should finally begin to enjoy some of
the material progress and the freedoms
we enjoy ourselves. We should speak
the language of egalitarianism and
fraternalism in London. If Australians
start talking like Australians again we
are likely to attract attention. But
before asking others to risk money and
men in South-East Asia we must build
up our own aid and military programs
so that we are not asking others to do
what we do not do ourselves.
Britain is still seeking some new
identity for itself. At present it is still
shuffling its options. The Common-
wealth? The Atlantic Alliance? The
Common Market? If it successfully
chooses the Common Market we should
not conceal from ourselves the fact that
not only will this create great tensions
and problems for Australia; it is also
likely to increase the British tendency
to withdraw from the rest of the world.
Joining the Common Market is now not
such a political decision as it was
earlier—“ Europe” as a concept seems to
be fading—but for Britain, in political
terms, the Common Market might
represent not so much joining “Europe”
as un-joining everything else. We
should include this possibility in our
planning.




THE AUSTRAUAH IMAGE
By DONALD HORNE
WALKING DOWN the street of the
village in which I was taking some of
my first steps on English soil, now
almost 20 years ago, there was a sense
of familiarity in the little brick cot-
tages, the hawthorn hedges, the elms,
the chickens scratching around a cart-
wheel near the old farmhouse. This
was the kind of calendar picture I
had been brought up on.
An old woman introduced herself
and welcomed me to the village. She
asked me a few questions about Aus-
tralia, as if I had been a mere visitor
there and had now returned to my true
homeland with a collection of native
spears and a grass skirt to put up on
the walls of the little backroom we
couldn’t do anything with. Although
her questions seemed to become in-
creasingly idiotic, I answered each of
them carefully, until the last, when
just as I was leaving she asked: “And
are there many white people in Aus-
tralia?”
Now that so much of one’s travelling
time is spent patiently explaining to
Asian hosts that we do have some
non-white people in Australia, the mem-
ory seems as faded and absurd as an
old seaside postcard. But the English
can still misunderstand us as crazily as
anyone else although, as one expects
from swinging London, in new, im-
proved, excitingly different ways.
The latest anecdote of this kind
comes from an art review published in
the “New Statesman” this month.
Robert Melville, in commenting on a
London showing of Thai and Cambpd-
ian art objects, remarks that the show
was arranged in collaboration with an
Australian dealer, and then, with an
arrogant ignorance equal to my little
old village woman’s, he adds: “Is it
perhaps considered to be unwise to offer
them for sale in Australia at the present
time? . . . Australians might well feel
that it would be unpatriotic to buy
mementoes of this artistic tradition while
their country is helping the U.S. to
obtain permanent bases in Vietnam.”
This appeared a few days after Mr.
Holt had been welcomed in Cambodia
with the agreeing-to-differ friendliness
that marks the relations between our
two countries, a few days before Mr.
Hasluck sat down at the SEATO meet-
ing in Washington to hear the Thai
Foreign Minister’s hawkish speech on
Vietnam, and some time after similar
art objects had enjoyed a good sale
in the gallery of a Sydney retail store.
The image of Australia as a vulgar
American toady, pushing its snout into
Asia, has already enjoyed a highly suc-
cessful season in parts of London’s
quality journalism: in fact, it has lasted
longer than “The Mousetrap.” It was
pioneered in the early 1950 s by the
“Guardian,” whose correspondent
seemed to have got hold of some carbon
copies of stories from America in its
McCarthyist period and put the name
Australia in wherever America occurred.
The “Guardian” even went so far as to
ask in 1951: “What special interest has
Australia in New Guinea?” “The
Times” is probably now the most res-
ponsible upholder of this view of Aus-
tralia and the “New Statesman” the
silliest.
It has, however, been a minority view.
The more widely held critical view of
Australia among London’s Top People
has continued to be that of the dreary,
if faithful, province this may even
have been one of the reasons why immi-
gration continues. Sydney appears to
be a kind of Manchester-in-the-Sun, all
the more attractive because of its
apparent inconsequence. While Sir
Robert Menzies was still making his
pilgrimages to the holy city the image
bore credence. With the English respect
for age and survival that, in another
connection, leads them to revere their
own unpopular figures if they last long
enough, even the critics of Australia
drew comfort from the familiarity of
Menzies.
When Mr. Holt made his “all the way
with LBJ” speech in Washington last
year, the dreariness of Australia seemed
to receive a challenge. Even some of
the critics of Australia’s action in Viet-
nam and our allegedly excessive
Americanism were cheered by Mr.
Holt’s difference from Sir Robert. It
was as if there were an emotional need
for Australia to become something of a
rebel, even if in the wrong cause, and
they were ready in Fleet Street to build
Mr. Holt up in this way. Their subject
failed them. In his first interview Mr.
Holt manifested his ability to talk
smilingly and engagingly about nothing
at all. They dropped him.
While almost every other part of the
British Empire was falling off, the con-
tinued faithful clinging of Australia was
almost beyond endurance. Even during
this period some English people per-
haps including some of the more per-
cipient saw a different Australia,
the Australia of decent suburban aspir-
ation, representing in many ways the
hopes of so many of the ordinary people
of the world, not merely a copy of
Britain, but something of its own kind.
The Duffle-Coated Chunder
The Asian Cobber
The White Australian
The Last Frontiersman
To others the more open and fraternal
manners of Australians seemed invit-
ing if not among the duffle-coated
chunderers in Earls Court, at least
out there, at the other end of the
world.
But there are problems for the
educated English in confronting such of
the face of brotherhood as Australians
provide: although shaken, their edu-
cation system is still a training in class
and even their rebels often make their
revolts within the concepts of class, so
that the image of the Australian as a
rough, uncouth sort of fellow is still
strong. And in England, as everywhere,
the Australian is set, in myth, among
his wide-open spaces, whereas, of course,
we are the most urbanised nation in the
world, a fact that almost nobody can
be made to believe, including many Aus-
tralians.
The worst kind of Australian-lovers
in America are sometimes seized by
this idea of the wide emptiness of our
continent and draw from it the loony
idea of Australia as the Last Frontier,
the world’s West, the rolling plain of
opportunity for White Anglo-Saxon
Protestants who can flee a socialist and
nigger-loving America, finding freedom
in a land of rugged, proud individual-
istic Caucasians. Yet while it can be
argued that the American frontier was
connected with a certain individualism
it can also be argued that the Aus-
tralian frontier was connected with
exactly the opposite. The distinctive
aspirations of Australian nationalism
were collectivist; our early distinctive
institutions were collectivist; our myths
were those of mateship and brother-
hood, not of individualism. The usual
criticisms made of us are for our lack
of individualism. We are, as it were,
the White Ants of the South West
Pacific. And while racism and the color
of skins are still an open obsession
with many Americans, an ill-matched
combination of our respect for the
humanness of humans and our sense
of fear in a strange environment have
both produced a situation in which
racism no longer receives any public
expression in Australia, even if it is
still in private practice.
Perhaps the more usual impression
Americans have of Australia is of a
nation of limeys, a cockney people
talking in those strange accents you
sometimes hear on late-night movies.
Cockney suggests a town-dweller, but
these particular cockneys live entirely
in the country, on their kangaroo farms,
cuddling their lovable koalas. Our
own image of ourselves as America’s
faithful ally is not reflected very widely
in America. Here and there in the
Administration perhaps, if a little


marred by those who know that it was
only when the Americans told us that
our proportion of GNP spent on
defence was too low that we increased
expenditure on our armed forces. But
very largely there is in America no real
image of Australia.
And what there is may often be of a
second-rate colonial kind. I remember
several years ago being invited to
breakfast by a prominent New York in-
tellectual. Between the orange juice and
the bacon and eggs he told me that
he was writing for the London “Spec-
tator.” When I mentioned that I had
also been writing for them he seemed
not to believe me. I mentioned several
things I had written one on Aus-
tralia, the others on Asian countries.
“I remember them,” he said. “I
thought they were by an Englishman.
I didn’t think an Australian could write
for the ‘Spectator’.” Another Ameri-
can intellectual told me that he
imagined Australia as a kind of Idaho
of 50 years ago.
The idea of us as American toadies
is popular in parts of the Australian
Left, where it is widely believed that,
out there in some place called “Asia,”
this is the way we are seen, affronting
“Asian opinion” by our action in Viet-
nam. This is related, of course, to that
part of the London view of us that
sees us confronting “Asia” with noth-
ing to conceal our white nakedness but
the stars and stripes. Australian and
London intellectuals seem to cross-
fertilise each other in such views.
There is, of course, no “Asia.” There
is only a highly diverse complex of cul-
tures, creeds, races, and nationalisms, so
much more diverse than in Europe that
the word continent seems to have lost
its meaning. There is, therefore, no
one Asian opinion. But even within
this diversity there is no majority view
that sees us primarily as a creature of
the Americans. It is true that among
some of the governments of Asian
nations, when they know something
about these things, they see us as hav-
ing a particular “in” with the Ameri-
cans. 'ln fact, they exaggerate our
relationship with the Americans, but
not in terms of criticism. That we are
believed to have a bit of pull with the
Americans is one of the ways in which
we seem to be a worth-while friend.
Usually, if we are seen in Asian coun-
tries to have connections with some
other world power it is not America
but Britain. Sometimes still we put
up the puzzle of being both Australian
and “British.” At our ceremonies we
play “God Save The Queen”; we
drink royal toasts; our diplomatic
missions are decorated with royal
photographs and the diplomats them-
selves with royal orders; we display
ourselves by an ensign bearing the
Union Jack. In Kuala Lumpur last
year I was flabbergasted when a
Malaysian saw our participation in the
counter-confrontation of Sukarno as an
example not of shared interest but of
loyalty to Britain. In Manila this year,
where I was giving a talk at one of the
universities, I was depressed to find
myself billed as “a British Common-
wealth journalist.” In countries where
nationalist revolutions have secured in-
dependence it is inconceivable to many
intellectuals that there is not still some
special significance in our link with
the British Crown that goes beyond
mere formality. If it has no connection
with policy, they feel, why not end it?
It is possible that our British connec-
tion, even more than our immigra-
tion policy, is the main credibility
blockage to our present claim that,
just as much as any other nation, we
“belong to Asia.” Our American con-
nection is certainly no hindrance, since
it is less strong than that of a number
of nations in Asia.
It is, of course, our immigration
policy that still, more than anything
else, provides an image of Australians
in the nations of Asia. If people have
heard only one thing about Australia,
it will be that we place special restric-
tions on non-European immigration
and all except the most knowledgeable
"Does it matter
much what our 'image'
really is?"
or the most polite will still refer simply
and bluntly to the “White Australia
policy.” Of course, if people know
nothing about Australia it is different.
An old Chinese taxi driver in Singa-
pore asked me: “Many Malays in Aus-
tralia?” When I said that there were
very few, he nodded wisely. “Good
country, Australia. Good country, Aus-
tralia,” he said, several times.
In Korea at schools they learn, at
minimum, three things about Australia:
(1) It is a very big place. (2) Sydney
is the third most beautiful harbor in
the world. (3.) The White Australia
policy. If you meet a Korean of no
great education he is likely to say to
you, “Hi, Australia . . . very big place
. . . Sydney . . . third most beautiful
harbor in the world . . .” He doesn’t
say any more, but he is thinking Num-
ber Three in his head. In every Asian
nation people are also thinking about
our immigration policy in their heads,
even if with their mouths the more
sophisticated of them are politely excus-
ing it. The new definition of policy
provides a new talking point, but one
can hardly yet claim with a straight
face that our policy is based solely on
assimilability, although it may now
seem reasonable to claim that it is
based more on fear of social tension
than on racialism.
Does it matter much what our
“image” is? So far as trade is concerned,
the answer seems to be “no.” If we
can sell to China we needn’t worry
about prejudice as an impediment to
selling anywhere else unless, of course,
the prejudice is related to some par-
ticular goods we sell. For example, the
mental sets that the British have against
Australian wine in London seem so
great that it is doubtful if any promo-
tion campaign—except of an economi-
cally ludicrous dimension —could break
them down; if we want to sell more
wine overseas we should try some new
market, such as Japan, where there is
no existing prejudice. Our anti-
Communism doesn’t stop Communist
countries buying our wool, no more
than it causes the Americans to start
buying it. The American wool lobby
wants to keep a high tariff on wool im-
ports, and even if we sent 100,000 men
to Vietnam the Americans would still
keep their tariff. The same is true of
the general argie-bargie of economic
conferences. In confrontations of self-
interest, such as the Kennedy Round
discussions, we form alliances based on
expediency, and off we go. There are a
few examples left in the world of nations
whose sense of honor is greater than
their sense of profit, but, now that
Sukarno has gone, none of them are
important to us.
The general “image” that is held of
a country can affect some individual
decisions about whether to buy some
of its goods or services. National airlines
are probably the most obvious example.
There is a tendency for airline passen-
gers to see airlines in terms of national
characteristics. Here we can take heart.


Qantas, as well as being in fact a safe
airline, is also believed to be reliable.
If a nation has a reputation that makes
people happy to fly by its airline this
probably tells one something about that
nation’s general reputation. There are
other nations which, although admired
in other ways, do not pass this par-
ticular test.
In both immigration and tourism,
national “images” are presumably of
considerable importance, although the
kind of image that attracts tourists may
be quite different from the kind of
image that attracts immigrants. You
may not want to live in one of those
glamorous places you would be de-
lighted to enjoy your holidays in, and
you might not want to spend your holi-
days in the kind of place you might
consider emigrating to. In either case,
to make it more complicated, tourist
and immigration images, though per-
haps different in themselves, can also
be different from general political
images. There is still a very bad im-
pression of the political situation in
Spain, yet tourists flock there. South
Africa would be one of the most politi-
cally despised countries in Britain, yet
the British still queue up there as immi-
grants.
So far as general political and social
images are concerned, we still suffer
from some of the leftovers of our for-
mer colonial attitudes. For much of our
history, displaying “loyalty” to Britain
sometimes seemed as important, or even
more important, as being loyal to Aus-
tralia, and to so,me it seemed particu-
larly important that the English should
love us. In this parental relationship it
could seem equally important to others
that the British should see us as inde-
pendent-minded grown-ups who had set
up home on our own. That Britain is
just one place among many and that
much of what happens there is of no
more concern to us than what happens
in other nations is an idea that many
of us have not yet got used to. Many
of us are now repeating these child-
parent relationships toward America.
There are those who are obsessed with
displaying “loyalty” to America (a
quality with which the Americans have
had so little experience that they would
hardly know what to do with it); others
are obsessed with displaying indepen-
dence of America—for its own sake.
What the British think of us still
has a marginal importance. Not in
trade, where they will follow their own
interests; certainly in immigration, but
the migrant impulses can be mysteri-
ously irrelevant to other images; but in
political considerations it matters to us
how we are seen in Britain. Here we
face a great difficulty. The kind of
British who are interested in the world
are almost, month by month, growing
less interested in the affairs of what
they see as the Far East. Still India,
perhaps, but not much beyond it. Yet
our main concern with what they think
is that they should maintain an interest
in South-East Asia and, more remotely,
in our own destiny.
Our immediate P.R. problem with
Britain is probably to attack, to speak
up, not so much on behalf of ourselves,
but of the people of South-East Asia.
And to kick up sufficient din to create
a vogue in Fleet Street. There are
many residual guilts still to appeal to.
What would be wrong, for instance,
with pointing out that the possibility of
communal discord in Malaysia and
Singapore is almost entirely a British
creation and that they have a duty
to help in the readjustment period?
There are difficulties. When our own
interest in South-East Asia is obviously
so much more direct than British in-
terest we sound less than convincing if
we urge them to greater financial sacri-
fices than we are prepared to make
ourselves. And so far as the whole world
is concerned the image of us as white
reactionaries is something we can do
something about: by demonstrating be-
yond dispute that our immigration
policy is genuinely based on considera-
tions of assimilability.
Continuing genuine immigration
reform, even if of a conservative kind, is
probably the most effective single piece
of image-changing we could engage in.
Both the nations of Eunope and North
America naturally see things in terms
of their own cliches and it is not to
our advantage that Europeans should
see us as South Africans and that
Americans should see us as Deep
Southerners. We are appallingly bad at
capturing anybody’s imagination —-
because we are not yet confident in
stating who and what we are and
the main way in which we have cap-
tured the world’s imagination is, in
cartoon terms, as a racist nation. That
this is unfair is beside the point. Our
position is now too subtle to be under-
stood. We should make it less subtle.
But only if we believe in it. If we
fiddle with our immigration policy
without believing that what we are
doing is good for its own sake, we shall
fail.
Paradoxically, our immigration policy
may be less important in those Asian
nations in which we are particularly
interested than in Europe or North
America. With the fringe nations of
South-East and East Asia, our mutual
interests can override other considera-
tions. The Bandung spirit of anti-
colonialism and the Sukarno doctrine
of New Emerging Forces are equally
dead. In the new pragmatism, if the
Japanese look for a friend in the
Pacific area, they do not examine the
color of our skins (which are often, of
course, less white than their own).
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Cam-
"We should speak up
more for what
we believe in"
bodia, and other nations with which
we are trying to forge special relations
know the differences between us and
South Africans, even if these differences
are not obvious to the art critic of
“New Statesman,” and it is by matur-
ing relations with such countries that
we lose the colonial inhibitions of our
past.
Although hate and fear impel
nations in their relations with each
other, love does not. Among what
nations is love a factor? At the best
a nation might seem to stand for a
while among other nations as an ex-
pression of some great ideal, but even
then the ideal is usually hated by as
many as love it, and, anyway, its
glamor later wears off. The one ideal
for which our aspirations might allow
us to stand would be the idea of
brotherhood, but our immigration
policies cancel out that possibility.
There is, however, respect. We
should speak up more for what we
believe in, as Mr. Holt did when he
recognised that the continuing social
revolutions of Asia reflect long-
suppressed yearnings for national
identity, social betterment, and econo-
mic progress, and that these are our
yearnings, too. ff we are not afraid
to express such aspirations, and our
actions do not make nonsense of them,
we ,may be treated with increasing
respect. One of the real reasons for
worrying about one’s “image” is that
its very distortions and absurdities can
tell one something about oneself.


UNCLE ERIC
ALL MY ADULT LIFE it has been the
inevitable question: “Are you related to
Eric?” I used to lay bets with myself
about how long it would take to come
out.
At first I did not like it much; with
all the pomposity of a 20-year-old, I
wanted to be esteemed for my own
achievements, which were nil. But
after 15 or 16 years it has become part
of my life; I’m going to ,miss it.
And it would be churlish to pretend
that it didn’t help me; in many difficult
conversations it provided me with a
journalistic foot in the door. Being my
uncle’s nephew meant I was more than
just a voice on a telephone or a short
fat chap in the corner; even if they
could not stand Eric (and there were
many who felt that way), at least they
knew him.
But if his name provided me with a
starting point for discussion with people
I had not previously met, it carried
its burdens.
One of them was the name itself. It
is his fault I have to carry around
Ehrenfried between the Michael and
the Baume.
Like his father before him, Eric was
really Frederick Ehrenfried Baume;
Ehrenfried had come from an aunt on
the brewing side of the family in New
Eric Baume
coming out ahead of Eric in any com-
parison was when a television reviewer
called me more hirsute than my uncle.
(I then had a full beard). Eric then
started nagging me to get rid of it.
If he ever did me any favors in
journalism, I never knew of them. And
I don’t think he would have. His was
and he stayed resentful for quite a
while.
But then a few years ago he sub-
mitted a poem to THE BULLETIN
and it was printed. He was delighted—
everyone had to read it. He had won.
He had shown whoever it was at THE
BULLETIN that he could not be dis-
missed in one word; printing the poem
was better than if THE BULLETIN
had run a eulogy of him and all his
works.
I used to ghost write for him when
he had a dreadful column going in
the “Sun” and he paid me a fiver for
each one (God knows what he was
getting for them).
He was probably closer to me than
to his other nephews if only because
1 was the only journalist among them,
and although he used to profess great
contempt for most of the present breed
of journalists, he liked my being one
and enjoyed my successes. He was
overjoyed when a $lOO,OOO libel writ
was served on me a few years ago.
But I didn’t really know him. I
don’t think any of us did. He seemed
somehow disengaged from his three
children, four nephews and a niece.
He sentimentalised about his family
rather than played a very active part
BY MICHAEL BAUME
Zealand. But Eric did not hang Ehren-
fried on to his son David’s name and
Aunt Ehrenfried was a bit cross about
it.
It was left to my parents, who pro-
duced the next boy in the family, to
placate her. They registered me
Michael Ehrenfried Baume, and then
to ease the blow on the other side of
the family, replaced it with the names
of my grandfathers when christening
me Michael Frederick William Baume.
But having a larger-than-life uncle
in journalism, a man who had been
flamboyantly successful, created plenty
of real problems for any other Baume
who wanted to get on in the business.
I was fearful that there would be no
real success in this profession for an-
other Baume; that the measuring stick
against which my performance would
be judged would be Eric’s, a man who
had done everything and been every-
where.
I’m certain that my father, a damn
good journalist before he was called
up as a naval reservist on the outbreak
of war in 1939, had suffered a bit
from being in the shadow of his big
brother.
The only time I ever remember
very much an “every man for himself”
sort of world, despite his genuine sup-
port for oppressed minorities and the
“little people.”
But even if he played no part in my
having a nightly radio program on
2GB a few years ago (Behind the
News of the World of Finance, which
I had inherited from my predecessor
on the “Financial Review”), he was
quite tickled by the fact that we shared
at 7 o’clock what was then the time slot
immediately after the news. “Only on
2GB can you get two Baumes for the
price of one,” he trumpeted. I don’t
think he ever really listened to my
financial commentary, and I can
hardly blame him.
But if one of my greatest thrills was
to join him on 2GB, one of his had to
do with THE BULLETIN. During the
war he had written his autobiography
(he was a better author than people
give him credit for; “Burnt Sugar,” for
example, is an excellent book) and he
had called it “I’ve Lived These Years.”
Then he added another volume: “I’ve
Lived Another Year.” THE BULLE-
TIN waspishly reviewed it in one
word “Why?”
He was very angry about it, indeed,
in it; no conversation I had with Eric
would be complete without some men-
tion of my father, who died 21 years
ago. But I don’t ever remember Eric
actually giving me anything for my
birthdays or Christmas. Aunt Mary
was always there to make up for things
like that.
At Christmas time my aunt’s cooking
and Eric’s grand gestures would con-
bine to bring about magnificent feasts.
And after them, everyone would lie
down wherever they could (I was a
floor man) to sleep it off. But with
few exceptions, the guests changed each
year.
Being related to Eric was like having
a licence to listen to him “after hours.”
You did not discuss things with Eric;
he talked to you, lectured you about
them. You were an audience and if you
did not respond the way an audience
should, you were in trouble.
I would go to see him at 2GB and
sit obediently there while he lectured
me, demanding agreement from his
loyal secretary.
But I won’t be lectured any more,
and the measuring stick that has been
there all my life has now gone. I wish
I’d had just one more lecture.

Idiot-proof
Electronics
SNAP IN, press on, sit back and listen.
Drop in, snap shut, raise to the eye,
click. What is it all about? It is the
new idiot-proof routine for (a) playing
recorded music and (b) taking a photo-
graph.
A wonder box called a cassette is
responsible for the new economy of
action. In music reproduction, a cas-
sette is a small plastic box the size of
a cigarette case. Inside is at least 300
feet of thin tape which gives you the
equivalent of your favorite 12in. LP
recording, when you slip the cassette
into a transistorised recorder. Press a
button, sit back, relax. No more warped
and dusty records, no more diamond
needles, no more fiddling with con-
ventional tape.
In photography, film is prewound
and loaded into a cassette which you
drop into your “instant” still or movie
camera. Once again, you aim and
shoot. No winding, no fuss. “Instant”
cameras, which have been on the
market for two years, now outsell any
other type. “Instant music” cassette
tape recorders have been on sale for
a year, but only now are being pre-
sented to the public with a big bang as
a revolution in sound.
The electronics industry is hopefid
that cassettes may mean a new mass
market. The prophets in the industry
see the new pre-packaged miniature
tapes replacing vinyl records just as
LPs replaced 78s in the early ’fifties.
They see a boom in a field where TV
is operating on a saturated market,
transistor radios are no longer a
novelty, and color TV is still in the
uncertain future.
The real revolution in the cassette
system lies in the size of the tape and
its pre-packaging. Instead of large
records and tapes you have thin, highly
sensitised tape, playing at 1| inches per
second, so far the lowest speed possible
for high-fidelity reproduction of music.
A dozen cassettes can be carried in
the pocket of a jacket and weigh a total
of 12 ounces. The portable recorder
which Philips has on the market
measures 8 x 4| inches so you have
music anywhere with the minimum of
fuss. You can buy blank tapes, playing
for 60 and 90 minutes, for $3.75 and
$7.50.
There’s a cassette player for the car
(no commercials, talk, or the Top 40)
and there’s a slightly grander one for
the home which you can link up to a
radiogram or stereo speakers for the
big blast of sound.
The prices of Philips cassette players
run from $BO to $l4O, and the cassettes
are $7 each. (Cost of an average LP is
$5.25.) So far sales have been to
businessmen, who install players under
the dashboard of their cars and dictate
letters and orders in transit, radio and
TV reporters needing on-the-spot tape
recordings, and there is a cassette
player in every booth in language
laboratories, where learners can tape
themselves and listen to others.
In America, cassettes (a registered
name they call them cartridges) are
big sellers. They have been on the
Yet another new world of entertainment
market for a year, and Ampex Stereo
Tapes the biggest tape manufac-
turers in America estimate that $lOO
million tapes will be sold this year, 65
percent of them in cartridges.
The Americans use end-to-end tape
in their cartridges, running on a single
spool, and use only four- and eight-
track tapes.
Philips in Australia use a hub-to-hub
system with the tape running from one
spool to another, each on its own hub
a twin-track system. Philips claim
this is the best system because the tape
can be stopped in midplay for a fast
rewind or wound forward to a certain
point for selective replaying.
Philips has another advantage in that
it produces the only unit combining a
recorder and a player, plus a simple
lead to plug it into the tape input of a
hi-fi system.
Grundig Telefunken has a fourth
system, strong in Europe, which will
probably make no headway here. The
hitch is that none of the four systems
is compatible. If you buy a cassette
with a twin track, you can’t play it on
a four-track player and vice versa, so
in buying one brand of player you limit
yourself to one group of tapes and, of
course, their choice of music.
Philips have jumped in smartly here.
They and their subsidiaries, Mercury,
Fontana, and others, are already in
the process of transferring master
records from their extensive classical
catalogues to cassette tapes.
Agreements with EMI have given
Philips rights to EMl’s considerable
music catalogue, and their acquisition
of Pye and large shareholding in
Electronic Industries, who record music
under the Astor label, puts them in a
strong position. They have nearly 200
cassettes on the market now, all pops
and evergreens, and we are promised
unlimited classics and everything else
by the end of the year.
It see : ms unlikely, however, that
Philips will succeed without a fight.
Ferris Car Radios have been market-
ing a Japanese four-track player for
some time, and last week released
their own cassette car player called
CTP4S, a stereo set with two speakers.
Some of their cassette music comes
from the Festival label. Hanimex,
makers of photographic equipment,
have just installed a unit in Sydney to
make cassettes, and they have the
rights to the Festival catalogue.
AWA is closely linked with the Ford
Motor Co. as a supplier of car radios,
and Ford is firmly on the eight-track
side. Mr. John Bailey, a spokesman
for AWA, said they were “watch-
ing the field closely. It is quite pos-
sible that cassettes will replace LPs
entirely within five or ten years,” he
said, “but they are not entirely suitable
for the pop market. The 45 r.p.m. is
irreplaceable.” He has something of
an axe to grind there; AWA distribute
the Discatron, an English battery-
operated pop record-player, which
takes one 45 r.p.m. dropped in a slot.
“It is an ideal player for the pop
market and for children,” said Mr.
Bailey. “And one 45 r.p.m. costs 70
cents as against $7 for a cassette. The
teenager may want only one or two
of the pop selections on the long-play-
ing cassette.”
AWA obviously wants to sell its Dis-
catron but can’t ignore the cassette
field—an interesting dilemma shared in
essence by all the major recording
companies. As stockholders of records
which have already been cut, companies
like EMI and Philips don’t want to
promote their own obsolescence.
Perhaps this is why Philips’ stock of
cassettes and players are a month
behind demand. “We don’t want to
overstock,” said Mr. Bill Boykett, pro-
duct manager of Philips, “until we
see what sort of market there is for
the product.”
One can sympathise with his caution.
It will be fascinating to see how every-
one crosses his bridges when he comes
to them.


When Greek
hates Greek
IN THE PROLIFERATING Greek
clubs of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Brisbane, Newcastle, and a number of
country towns, cards and black coffee
have lost priority to a welter of pas-
sionate political debate.
Though the guns behind the Athens
coup remained silent, changing events
in the homeland echoed last week with
the speed and accuracy of rifle fire
among Australia’s 200,000 - strong
Greek community. Days before King
Constantine finally gave his blessing to
the military leaders, demonstrators in
Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide were
in action, raucously defining their
alignments and sympathies.
It was immediately clear that the
split among Australian Greeks is much
wider than at the time of the religious
A Greek demonstration in Sydney
battle between supporters and oppon-
ents of the strong-willed Archbishop
Ezekiel a couple of years ago, and
could grow in seriousness if events
heightened the demonstrators’ fears of
Greece moving to civil war.
Some agitators are reported to be
recruiting for volunteers to return
home and fight against the coup
leaders if civil war breaks out. The
Immigration Department and Com-
monwealth police may find it the labor
of Hercules to stop them.
Some Greek leaders believe that civil
strife is likely because the Army will
break up into political factions under
the strain of events. And in many Aus-
tralian Greeks their intense political
feelings are only secondary to their
concern for families and relatives in
the troubled homeland.
Last Monday demonstrations were
staged by 500 Greeks in Sydney,
slightly more than that number in
Melbourne, and about 400 in Adelaide.
The Sydney demonstrators chanted
slogans and waved banners outside the
Greek Consulate in Pitt Street and
later attempted to march on the
United States Consulate in Wynyard
Street. Credit for the organisation was
taken by the newly formed “League for
Democracy in Greece.” The following
day about 800 attended a protest rally
in the Greek theatre in Darlinghurst,
Sydney, where photographs of King
Constantine were ripped up.
In Melbourne a rowdy meeting at
the Richmond Town Hall carried a
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
unanimous motion protesting against
the military takeover and calling on all
local Greeks to remove from their halls
and homes portraits of the King and
Queen Anne Marie.
Greek priests were requested to sus-
pend ritual prayers and eulogies for the
Greek royal family. One banner read:
“Dictatorship is an insult to the birth-
place of democracy.” The Australian
Government was urged to refuse recog-
nition to the new regime.
Resolutions from the meeting were
sent to King Constantine, to the United
Nations, and to the Governments of
Australia, France, Britain, the United
States, the Soviet Union, Cyprus, Egypt,
and Denmark.
A further protest meeting was con-
ducted outside the Greek Consulate in
Melbourne last Thursday, and the
Greek community has since been flooded
with pamphlets from both opponents
and supporters of the coup.
Of the nine Greek-language papers
in Australia, seven have come out in
support of the deposed Government and
two are on the side of the Army. On
public evidence this would seem to be
a fair indicator of allegiances in the
Greek community.
“You must understand that Greeks
are more concerned about politics than
the average Australian,” explained Mr.
Demetrious Gogos, editor of “Neos
Kosmos,” the largest-selling Greek-
language paper in Australia. “Most of
the Greeks out here are hostile to the
Army coup and believe that the King
played a significant part in it. Even
those who were opposed to the previous
Government are worried that the Army
takeover may lead to a civil war.”
Claiming a regular circulation of
15,000, “Neos Kosmos” was formerly
a weekly but has begun to appear more
often in recent months and for the past
fortnight has run to four issues a week,
selling about 22,000.
In the spirit of the week’s events,
opponents claim that “Neos Kosmos” is
Communist-influenced and that many of
its articles on Greek affairs are similar
to those published in the Communist
“Tribune” and the former “Guardian.”
Mr. Gogos, however, describes his
paper as simply “democratic, and with
a general bias in favor of the ALP be-
cause most Greeks are workers and sup-
port the ALP.”
Representative of another side of
Greek opinion is the weekly “Phos.”
Its 74-year-old proprietor, Mr. John
Panayatopoulos, says that the coup was
justified because “the Communists were
starting to get control. Greece is sur-
rounded by Communist States and does
not want to become another Vietnam.”
Was the deposed Prime Minister a
Communist? “No, but he was falling
into the hands of the Communists and
action had to be taken. The Prime
Minister before him was effectively
controlled by the Communists. His
son, I know, was a Party member.”
“Phos” began as the first Greek-
language paper in Melbourne 32 years
ago and has consistently promoted con-
servative policies and defended the
Greek monarchy.
Mr. Panayatopoulos claims that most
of Australia’s 200,000 Greeks are loyal
to the King and that the demonstrators
in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide
are an unrepresentative “couple of
thousand of hoodlums with red flags.”
Like his opponents, he does not deny
that the King was involved in the coup.
The King’s alleged involvement is one
of his reasons for supporting it.
Greek community leaders are con-
cerned at the possibility of violence
erupting among agitators on both sides.
A number of allegations of assault
have been made and Mr. Pana-
yatopolous of the royalist “Phos”
alleges that he has been receiving
threatening phone calls: “But I have
had them before. I take no notice.
They are all cowards.”
As the debate proceeds and attitudes
harden many Greeks seem to have lost
sight of one of the questions which to
the rest of the world seems unsettled:
Did the King really support the coup
or was he also its victim?


BRITAIN IN SEARCH
OF A ROLE
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in London
WHOEVER THOUGHT up the
phrase “East of Suez” must have been
an opponent of the policy. After all,
Americans don’t refer to their troops
in Vietnam as being “West of Bataan”
any more than the Russian decision to
exchange diplomatic representation
with Malaysia is seen as part of their
“East of Urals” policy. But then, for
both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. the world
is still very much their oyster. “East
of Suez,” quite apart from referring
to an unhappy adventure, conjures up
a feeling of remoteness and mystery,
of Tyrone Power stalking down some
oriental sidestreet, of Humphrey
Bogart carousing in the casbah.
For many in Britain today, oysters
seem too expensive to be worth bother-
ing about. Visiting the country for the
first time in thirteen years, the British
appear to have become introvert and
insular to an extent one would hardly
have dreamed possible. TV feeds this
process. Trial and inquest by camera
are a highly developed art here. Just
occasionally you see a sensitive docu-
mentary on the plight of Anglo-
Indians or famine in Bihar. These are
nothing when compared with the con-
tinual inquiry into the problems of
England.
Even the other components of the
U.K. hardly get a look-in; when Scot-
tish and Welsh nationalists made
electoral gains recently, they were
greeted with incredulous disbelief.
Significantly, the only sustained TV
coverage east of Suez recently has been
of British troops bogged down in Aden,
well calculated to enhance a viewer’s
inclination to retreat. As for Vietnam,
the less said the better. Coverage is
spasmodic and one-sided, often biased,
even on the BBC. If some of the
citizens of Little Ditherington decide to
hoist an anti-American poster, then
TV cameras will be there. A few days
ago the considered opinions of Herr
Willy Brandt on Britain’s chances of
EEC entry got less coverage than anti-
Vietnam demonstrations in Rome,
Athens, and some remote college in
southern U.S.A.
Mind you, if the English are with-
drawing in upon themselves, then they
have plenty to be withdrawn about. The
gritty northern industrial towns whose
accent Wilson has carried to 10 Down-
ing Street are still too much as the in-
dustrial revolution left them. The
economy, too, has not changed enough,
being still caught in the “stop-go”
(currently stop) cycle. Restrictions
abound, enterprise is frustrated, or else
is diverted down other channels, which
is one reason why foreigners talk of
“swinging” or “naughty” London.
Class-consciousness retains an insidious,
albeit not so obvious, grip, with the
only difference being the likely addi-
tion of another “lower” class, that of
the colored immigrants, despite the
fact that, inter alia, they keep London’s
transport system and the National
Health Service going. One can’t help
feeling that a good dose of Australian
egalitarianism might do as much as
American monetary loans to get Britain
moving again.
It is too easy, perhaps, to knock
Britain part of the trouble is that
the British spend far too much time
and energy knocking themselves,
though you can aver this is the “growth
of democracy” if you wish. The point
is that it takes a positive effort today
to recollect that in 1954 it was Britain
which took most of the initiatives over
Vietnam in which Menzies was content
to acquiesce, presiding as he was over a
very insular Australia. Now British
policy on Vietnam is so far “behind”
Canberra’s as to be almost out of sight.
The debate, which should be about the
precise nature of Britain’s role in a
world in which she still retains power,
influence, and prestige, has instead
become a rather sterile discussion on
whether “Britain’s world role” should
be retained or not. The “noes”
have made all the running. The
potential “ayes” have mostly been
silent. On the one hand the British
preoccupation with Africa and Arabia,
wherein juvenile nationalism still pur-
sues the imperial wolf, has tended to
conceal the Asian reality of nations
which, for the most part, have left the
Bandung era of anti-colonialism be-
hind for the more relevant calcula-
tions of power. So the “East of Suez”
rebel, Mr. Christopher Mayhew,
asserts that nowadays “white troops”
have no part to play at all in the
third, colored, world, and is allowed
to get away with it. Nearly all the
speakers in the recent defence debate
in the House of Commons scrupulously
avoided the lessons of Confrontation,
even though Britain might well be
proud of them.
On the other hand, just as it is not
acknowledged that legitimate Asian
governments see a role for Britain, so
it is not seen that Britain has a role
for herself. “What worries me,” com-
mented one Australian observer, “is
the ease with which some intelligent
Lee Kuan Yew and Harold Wilson
people here are slipping into the belief
that the power situation is not global,,
that Europe can be divorced from it,
that the Asian situation is separate and
divisible.” There are many, of course,
who do not make such questionable
assumptions. The main failure here
would seem to be political, mainly Mr.
Wilson’s. When he “put down” the
“East of Suez” revolt last year he failed
to put forward good reasons, a specific:
purpose for the continuing commit-
ment. Consequently, he not only failed
to satisfy" those who are against it in
any case, but- also failed to convince
those who were for it, with talk of
“socialist solidarity” with Harry Lee,
and not letting the Americans and the
Chinese confront each other “eyeball
to eyeball.” Mr. Healey has, on" past
occasions, used the very valid argu-
ment that there can never be a satis-
factory speed of development for the
developing such as Left-wing Labor-
ites allegedly desire in conditions of
power instability. He has not done so
lately. Rather he has been more con-
cerned how much he agrees with much
of what the “rebels” say. The Tory
leader, Mr. Heath, has nothing to say
on east of Suez, but, characteristically,
leaves the running to Enoch Powell,
still producing a completely new line
of argument every few months, each
of which stresses a diminished “world
role,” or to Sir Alee Douglas-Home,
very much a prophet in the wilder-
ness with his ideas of Britain joining
ANZUS, and for the neutralisation of
South-East Asia. But at least Sir Alec
sounds as if he is acquainted with the
problems . . . Overall, the British are
mainly concerned to eliminate the
imperial past. The undeniable truth —•
“we can’t police the world any more”
is used to brush off argument before
it gets started.


Dravo can build the dams to make the lakes to produce the power
Since its beginning. 76 years ago.
Dravo Corporation has been in-
volved in the construction of
locks, dams, docks and bridges.
Dravo-built structures have
helped open rivers to navigation,
bring new business into previ-
ously inaccessible locations and
create new sources of power for
an electricity-hungry world. Ves-
sels move more easily, unload
more quickly and reduce trans-
portation costs substantially as a
result of a new lock system in
the American Mid-West. Farmers
in northern California have more
power, less fear of floods and
better crops because of a Dravo-
built dam. And people everywhere
expedite their travel and materials
handling problems because of
docks and bridges built by Dravo.
Lock, dam and bridge con-
struction makes use of only three
of Dravo's special skills: civil
engineering, fabrication and con-
struction. Your problem may call
for other Dravo capabilities such
as the design and manufacture
of bulk materials handling sys-
terns, the construction of oxygen
steelmaking facilities or the devel-
opment of a water treatment in-
stallation.

OVERSEAS
Sulky Buddhists ready to
rejoin the Vietnam power play
AMIDST the excitement surrounding
the promulgation of the Constitution
of the “Second Republic” by the rul-
ing Directory of Generals, a major fact
of South Vietnam’s current history has
almost been forgotten: the Buddhists,
who had made the emergence of a
National Assembly possible, were
absent from the celebrations. What
consequences this is going to have are
not yet clear.
One should bear in ,mind the
Buddhist agitation in 1963 which pre-
pared the ground for the army coup
and the downfall of the Diem Govern-
ment. Without this agitation, public
opinion, neither at home nor abroad —
especially in the United States would
have tipped the scale in favor of sup-
porting the coup. Again, it was the
Buddhist agitation in the spring of
1966 which led to the generals’ decision
to convene a Constituent Assembly and
to the pressure by the U.S. Govern-
ment in particular by Mr. Henry
Cabot Lodge to speed up the draft-
ing of the Constitution and the return
to civilian-elected government.
The Buddhists, following the militant
monk Thich Tri-Quang, had pressed
for the convening of a full National
Assembly and not just a Constituent
Assembly, but the defeat of their upris-
ing in Central Vietnam by General Ky,
with American support, had dashed
their power. In sulks, the Buddhists
made the mistake of boycotting the
September elections, and thus had no
voice in the drafting of the Constitution.
The dashing of the Tri-Quang wing
has led to the re-emergence of Tam-
Chau and his supporters, who were
willing to play ball with the Ky Gov-
ernment, and, for this reason, have been
recognised by it as the only legitimate
representatives of the Vien Hoa Dao,
the Buddhist Institute for Secular
Affairs. This was despite the fact that
the Tri-Quang group enjoyed more
support among the faithful as well as
the Buddhist leadership, who voted
in October to replace Tam-Chau as
director of the Vien Hoa Dao. Tam-
Chau, citing the text of the charter
of the Buddhist Unified Church,
refused to yield, and in this he was
backed by Ky’s Government.
Tri-Quang has had time to do some
serious thinking while in the cold. He
has now decided to change tactics.
The news has come out that the Budd-
hists will not boycott the presidential
elections on September 1, nor the
senatorial elections on the same day,
nor the legislative elections on
October 1. Since the Tri-Quang group
has also made clear that it is not put-
ting up any candidate, the question
asked here is: whom are Tri-Quang and
his followers going to support? In spite
of its defeat by the Ky Government a
year ago this group still enjoys a great
deal of influence among the faithful,
especially in Central Vietnam.
There are rumors, still unconfirmed,
that Tri-Quang will support Mr. Tran-
Van-Huong. This seems paradoxical,
as Huong was the arch-enemy of Tri-
Quang in 1964-65, but it remains un-
deniable that if Tri-Quang gives his
support to Huong, the latter will have a
very good chance of winning the
presidential elections (if these are fair).
He already enjoys the support of the
A Far Eastern
Economic Review report from
Ton That Thien in Saigon
Buddhists of the General Association
(a large group which split from the
Buddhist Unified Church), the Asso-
ciation of Buddhist Studies of Southern
Vietnam (whose president is Mai-Tho-
Truyen, a respected retired official),
the civil servants who would like to see
some order and consistency prevail in
the administration, and the southerners
generally (Mr. Huong being from the
South). Together, these groups would
account for three million votes out of
a total of just over , five million. To
these should be added the Catholic
votes.
One of Huong’s opponents will be
Mr. Phan-Khac-Suu, president of the
Constituent Assembly, who had been a
minister in Diem’s first Government,
but was later jailed on charges of being
involved in the coup of November,
1960. Suu is a member of the Cao-Dai,
a religion with one million adherents.
He may have the support of Ky if the
latter decides not to run and prefers
to be Premier in Suu’s Government.
Suu has picked as running mate, for
the post of Vice-President, Dr. Phan
Quang Dan. Dan was also jailed by
Diem for the same reason as Suu.
Tri-Quang (centre) and co-leaders
Another candidate is Ha-Tsuc-Ky, chief
of a faction of the Dai-Viet party (the
New Dai Viet).
But Huong’s principal opponent will
be either General Thieu or General Ky,
if they decide to run, which is con-
sidered very likely. If they do, they
will have control over the whole mili-
tary and civilian machine. Will this be
enough to counterbalance the weight of
the Buddhists if they decide to support
Huong? This will be the big question
at the coming elections.
Defence policies
Britain's dilemma
JUST HOW two-faced will British
defence policy be in the 19705? Mr.
Denis Healey, as it turned out, went to
Malaysia to trim, not to axe: the inten-
tion is to bring home between 5000
and 10,000 men from the Far East,
which would leave another 33,000 to
38,000 still there.
So it looks as if the stories about the
final cutting of commitments were a
storm in a teacup.
There never ought to have been much
doubt about it. The United States wants
a stabilising force in the Far East that
it does not have to provide itself, and
the presence of some British troops in
Malaysia and Singapore, together with
the capacity for a rapid build-up, is
the only such force available. Unless


Mr. Wilson has decided that the good
opinion of Washington has stopped
mattering to him, he is not going to
drop the centrepiece of his present
defence policy. Not likely.
But Mr. Healey has his eye on the
future. The Far East scene can change
radically in the next ten years. Is
Britain ready to move with the changes?
So long as the Vietnam war goes on, a
British withdrawal from South-East
Asia would be tantamount to dissocia-
tion from American policy. But the end
of the Vietnam war could affect the
situation in two different ways.
If the Americans and their allies
win, the whole of southern Asia will
benefit from the resulting decrease in
tension. In that case British troops in
the Malayan peninsula might become
superfluous except as a possible fire-
brigade in the event of local trouble.
If, on the other hand, the Americans
decide they cannot stand the pace in
Denis Healey... trim, not axe
Vietnam and decide to withdraw from
the Asian continent (which is what
this kind of revulsion would entail),
there would be little hope that anything
Britain can do would be enough to
stem the subsequent tide. For British
troops to remain in South-East Asia
would simply mean waiting for the wave
to overwhelm them.
Moreover, the need for British troops
may grow on the other side of the
Indian Ocean. The arms race between
Somalia and Ethiopia may lead to an
explosion in the Horn of Africa. If it
does, and if Kenya is involved, Britain
has a commitment to help the weak
Kenyan Aimy.
This might be an easier job than the
confrontation with Indonesia, but it
would call for a fair number of British
troops backed by relatively sophistica-
ted weapons.
The need for a watch on the Persian
Gulf will also continue for a few years
yet. Bahrein is to be reinforced after
the withdrawal from Aden; but it may
require reinforcing more than appears
in Mr. Healey’s philosophy.
So Britain’s defence policy looks like
including forces east of Suez for quite
a long time to come. The only alterna-
tive, which would be for the United
States to take over in the Indian Ocean,
is still ruled out in Washington
(though a further flow of American
money to help Britain hang on is not).
One aspect of British defence policy
in the 1970 s will be a continuing need
for mobile troops capable of operating
in fairly small units in tropical condi-
tions and trained in counter-insurgency
tactics. The main trouble is that when
this is added to the need for keeping
the Rhine Army at a presentable
strength, one wonders where the neces-
sary supply of high-quality manpower
will come from.
(An "Economist" report)
South Africa
A black make-up
THE POLECAT, as a Nationalist
newspaper once described South Africa
in the world’s opinion, is trying to
change its stripes. Slowly and cautiously
an attempt is being made to reshape
the country’s relationship with the
African continent and win a degree
of international acceptability.
Mr. Vorster is trying, as he promised
his followers in successive speeches last
month, to lead South Africa back into
the world.
It may seem incongruous that this
wax-faced architect of the 180-day
detention law, a wartime internee for
his Nazi sympathies, should be the man
to emerge as the beautician of apar-
theid. But Mr. Vorster’s accession last
September happened to come at the
end of a shock year in Africa (seven
coups and two assassinations) which
had taken the steam out of pan-
Africanism and .made a modest
counter-offensive possible.
To this situation he was at least
able to bring a certain flexibility of
mind which Dr. Verwoerd had not
possessed.
The strategy of the counter-offensive
began to take shape last October with
the independence of the two former
British protectorates, Botswana and
Lesotho, and the readiness with which
their leaders bowed to the reality of
their dependence on South Africa.
It dawned on Pretoria that in many
ways a ring of black States economi-
cally beholden to South Africa could
provide a far better protective cushion
against the north than the old arc of
white colonies, which, being colonies,
tended to invite attention and trouble.
Count in the eight proposed tribal
Bantustans and the protectorate of
Swaziland, due for independence next
year, and the beleaguered South
Africans could see the novel and attrac-
tive prospect of 11 friendly black States
around them.
On top of this the Rhodesian crisis
has been forcing both Malawi and
Zambia into closer economic relation-
ship with South Africa.
So the talk in South Africa these
days is of a southern African “co-
prosperity sphere” the prosperity,
of course, being mainly South African
and the concept has injected a new
spirit of buoyancy and even excitement
into Nationalist speeches and news-
paper editorials.
There is a new eagerness to break
away from the old posture of defensive-
ness and venture out into the world.
This mood is epitomised by the visits
to France, Germany, Portugal, and
Britain recently paid by the Minister
of Defence, Mr. Botha, now number
two to Mr. Vorster. His European tour
was obviously an attempt to feel his
way round the United Nations arms
embargo.
But there is one serious gap in the
co-prosperity sphere, and that is
Rhodesia. As long as the Rhodesian
crisis smoulders there remains the
danger that it may flare up and involve
the whole of southern Africa. There
remains, too, the uncomfortable fact
that sanctions have not yet been finally
discredited and discarded as a weapon
of political coercion.
Rhodesia’s resistance is not evoking
quite the same emotional fervor in
South Africa that it used to: the whole
thing has been going on for so long
that it has become just a little boring,
and one no longer sees cars festooned
with “Forward Rhodesia” stickers.
There have been steady rumors that
South Africa is busy behind the scenes
trying to bring about a reopening of
negotiations to end the Rhodesian
stalemate, and these gained some cre-
dence in March when Mr. lan Smith
interrupted his holiday to visit Mr.
Vorster in Cape Town. The South
African Press reported that Mr. Vorster
had used “blunt language” during the
meeting and that he had given Mr.
Smith a “sharp message.” It also
claimed that he had urged a reopening
of negotiations.
There is still the matter of South-
West Africa, due to be the subject of
a special United Nations debate this
month.
The situation is that the General
Assembly, having voted last October to
terminate South Africa’s mandate to
administer South West Africa, is now
faced (not surprisingly) with the failure
of its 14-nation ad hoc committee to
reach agreement on how this decision
should be implemented. As a result
the debate is not viewed with any great
apprehension in Pretoria, which will
be quite content to see the issue head
toward some kind of stabilised dead-
lock.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Stake in Two Worlds
By J. C. KAYE
MR. GEORGES MORA, the Mel-
bourne restaurateur, formerly of the
Balzac, East Melbourne, has surpassed
the not-unusual practice of combining
a restaurant and art gallery by opening
in St. Kilda two restaurants and two
art galleries.
His place, the Tolarno, is in Fitzroy
Street, not far from St. Kilda Railway
Station, Luna Park, the Palais de
Danse, the Palais Theatre, and the
beach. Across the road, behind a shop,
can be seen part of what was the first
French consulate in Melbourne.
Mr. Mora, a slight, greying man, is
himself French, having come to Mel-
bourne via America in 1951. He says
that all four of his new enterprises are
doing well. He might even expand. As
he owns the building, and it was a 50-
room private hotel when he acquired it
two years ago, there is space for even
more restaurants and even more gal-
leries.
A bistro is at the front, with brown-
lacquered Colonial-style furnishing. To
the right, inside the front door, is one
commercial gallery, which was formerly
two bedrooms. The current show here
is by William Wright.
Farther into the interior on the left
is the French-style dining-room, open
only at night, where Mr. and Mrs. Mora
have covered the walls with a not-for-
sale display of their collection. Our
inexpert eye noticed works by John
Olsen, Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd,
Bob Dickerson, Andrew Sibley, Robert
Hughes. About 20 artists, including Mrs.
Mora, are represented. From the
dining-room one can look out on an
open space for sculpture, known as the
“sculpture yard.” Farther into the
building on the right is the second
commercial gallery, with beige walls
and varnished wooden floor, which was
at one time the hotel breakfast-room.
Upstairs, the Moras, who have three
sons, have made their own home, in-
cluding a studio for Mrs. Mora. Georges
does not paint, just as he does not cook.
He is an entrepreneur of both worlds.
“I know how zings should be” is his
own phrase.
Georges Mora was born in Paris, of
Spanish descent, son of the owner of
a furniture and antique shop. The
family had many artist friends. Georges
wanted first to be a doctor, but be-
came a patent attorney. The family,
being Jewish, fled France as war began
in 1939. Georges’ parents settled in
Portugal. He lived in Morocco. By
1942 he was back in France, worked
with the Resistance, and was in Paris
for the Liberation.
After the war he served with an
organisation for resettling Jewish child-
ren. “There were 4000 children in 30
different homes. We had to find out
even their names so many were under
false papers,” he recalls.
He celebrated peace by getting to
know most, if not all, the eating palaces
of Paris. “I began my career as a great
diner-out.” He met and married Mirka,
who was a student at the theatre
school of Jean-Louis Barrault.
When the German situation deterior-
ated, and another war seemed possible,
he and Mirka, with their first son, emi-
grated to America, but after a short
time came on to Australia. “Australia
seemed the safest country in the world.”
That was in 1951. His first, enterprise
was to manage a noodle factory for a
man he had once known in Paris. The
factory workers, led by a foreman
named Dempsey, threw the book of
rules at him, and he was in despair
until, one desperate day, he accepted
the advice to take Dempsey to the
pub for a beer. “After we had had
some beers, and I have become drunk
with him, he was my champion.”
In 1953 he and Mirka opened the
Mirka coffee lounge in Exhibition
Street. Artists they knew by then, in-
cluding Jack Perceval, who made 80
pottery mugs for the lounge, displayed
some of their work there. (Almost all
the mugs were broken.)
Mora then had a chance to take over
a cafe in East Melbourne. “Lino on
Georges Mora
the floor, lino on the tables, thin saus-
ages, crumbed veal cutlets, three and
sixpence.” He ran this as best he could,
got a liquor licence after 2| years, and
converted the cafe to the Balzac French
Restaurant.
The Balzac, Mora says now, was “a
gold mine.”
He put 40,000 dollars into converting
the Tolarno to its present style. St.
Kilda itself, having become a prosper-
ous, fairly respectable district, after a
prewar era with a reputation as a
notorious region of gangsters, molls,
baccarat schools, and other sins, pro-
vides about a third of his clients. He
has an overdraft but it doesn’t impose
a strain. “Let my bank manager worry,”

Theatre
Fallen archness
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Importance of Being Earnest.
Wilde. Muse, Melbourne. '
DESPITE THE FACT that it rose
from its own ashes, the Muse is too
small for a phoenix. With just 36 seats,
it is more of a budgie. The original
Muse, located some miles away at
South Yarra, was a hilarious miniatur-
isation of a conventional theatre. It was
as if they’d taken the Princess with all
its overblown decor and let the air out.
Although the stage was only ten feet
wide, it boasted a heavily brocaded cur-
tain. There was a preposterous chande-
lier, and even tom-thumb boxes. The
whole place groaned under the weight
of its rococo decoration scarlet and
gilt carry-on in inflammable papier-
mache. It all went up in flames after
a particularly obnoxious review called
“Oops” or “Whoops” or something
similar.
The Muse Mark II is more spartan.
Squashed into the upstairs of a Carlton
tenement, it is a dwarf theatre-in-the-
round, ideally suited to such claustro-
phobic dramas as “The Diary of Anne
Frank,” one of its recent and most suc-
cessful productions. Similarly it would
be fine for “The Caretaker” or “Oblo-
mov.” But it is not the happiest environ-
ment for the expansive gesturing of
Oscar Wilde.
Wilde tosses off his quotable quotes
like a magician conjuring pigeons or
ping-pong balls, and it is unfair to sit
so close to an illusionist. Because of
their proximity, the cast must cramp
Wilde’s style by delivering his lines
conversationally; without the necessary


flamboyance his witticisms seem unsure
of themselves and unfunny.
Peter Green is suitably earnest as
Worthing and Jan Morris simpers
meticulously as Cecily Cardew. Alan
Money and Nancy Murdoch dither
nicely as Chasuble and Prism, while, as
Gwendoline, Ngaire Aldous mimics
Joan Greenwood’s film performance
down to the last quavering vowel.
One cast member, however, makes
the production significant. He is a
young man named Gary Westell, who
works rather like Reginald Livermore.
Co-producing with Alan Money, he
plays the elegant, arrogant Algernon
Moncreiff with the supreme self-
possession that Wilde would have
wanted. If he can play other roles
half as well, his future is assured.
There is no set to speak of, just a
few pieces of Op Shop furniture and
a couple of exotic old drapes. The
costumes would have passed muster at
a distance, but at close quarters dis-
ruptive inconsistencies emerge. Like
1890 Hush-puppies and Victorian zip-

Art
Blue funk
By ELWYN LYNN
Max Lyle. Hungry Horse Gallery, Syd-
ney.
Donald Brook. Gallery A, Sydney.
Gordon Samstag. Barry Stern’s, Sydney.
Use Tauber. Watters Gallery, Sydney.
“FUNK” AND “FUNKY” don’t look
it, but they are current jargon made
respectable by “Art in America,” “Art
and Australia,” and “Newsweek”:
borrowed from jazz blues, the word
now indicates disjunctive three-
dimensional assemblages erotic,
visceral, woolly, slimy, fascinatingly
repulsive, gaudily colored, and often
nauseatingly unhygienic, and the
answer of the heirs of Dada to the
bland, radiantly colored cool cats; they
are the smooth men of art, but
Funksters are the hairy Esaus of the
avant-garde.
To redress the balance on the scene
we could do with some in Australia;
Melburnian Max Lyle’s polyester resin
and stainless steel combinations
approach Funk, with their biomorphic
bulging forms in repelling but com-
pelling yellows, blues, and reds. Breasts,
buttocks, knees, and entwined, plump
legs aim at the condition of swelling
gourds and are part of the Upton and
Baldessin penchant for the pulpy,
flaccid look of teat and bum; Baldessin,
a vastly superior sculptor, balances
tough shield-shapes against the soft-
ness, and Lyle, aware of the flabbiness,
links his waxy, plasticine shapes with
shiny, spiralling steel tubes, like metal-
lic-voiced sergeant-majors trying to
stiffen up the limp troops, but it rarely
succeeds. In Embrace, the swelling con-
tours and flat planes work well, but in
the resin works and this is a lot of
Funk the shapes have no internal
pressures and look as though they came
from moulds; Metamorphosis seems un-
decided whether to revert to wax or
flow into a body-mould.
Waxworks are repulsively moribund,
and some of these sculptures cour-
ageously invade the same territory and
come off when Lyle’s formal strength
is best, as in Yellow Symbol, where an
elongated body of yellow with a
hemisphere belly runs up a vertical
shield, and in Life Circle, where the
red bas-relief medallion is set in a
grey plaque with appropriately waver-
ing sides.
If Lyle looks too fleshy (and one
needs to note that the avant-garde audi-
ence is divided on Oldenburg’s sagging
toilets .made of upholstered canvas),
Donald Brook of Canberra appears too
intellectual to some and over-concerned
with machine-age parables to others as
he tosses moulded figures on rods, like
Icarus, or, with prophetic insight,
Russian cosmonauts. There is more
emotional content than one would find
in a Klippel or Meadmore (who has
just made it in New York with a
reproduction and a respectable men-
tion in “Art News”) and some works
recall the surrealism of Giacometti’s
Palace at 4 a.m. (1932-33) and Max
Ernst’s Lunar Asparagus (1935). Fan-
tasy that avoids whimsy is difficult in
sculpture, but despite his unsensuous
calculation, Brook achieves it.
Marshall McLuhan says that Cubism
adopted mechanical approaches when
the electrical age was upon us, and
Brook is not so simplistic as to be
describing the plight of mechanical
man in a Chaplinesque world; his tat-
tered mannikin in a world he never
made is victor-victim, coping with the
space age with a mechanical ideology.
It is the sculptural qualities that are
of more interest than the content; like
Lyle’s these sparse, sombre, lean works
don’t encase pressures; they move with
splendid trajectory as rods and tense
wires project through and engage space
as in Electrapallo and Automatic Pilot.
Their propulsive tenseness has a
peculiar effect on space, making most
objects that occupy it look clumsily
irrelevant. Mr. Brook is a very positive
element in the varied revival of sculp-
ture in this country, evidenced by the
current triennial at Mildura, where, for
the record, non-aquisitive awards went
to Herbert Flugelman and Margaret
Sinclair and acquisitive to Michael
Kitching, W. Allen, Ron Upton, and
Elwyn Dennis.
Brook deals in passionately logical
icons, but Gordon Samstag, of Adelaide,
orders his twine, fibres, paint, boxes
with windows covered in wire mesh,
tissue paper, and hessian with such
an ease and seeming carelessness that
he looks uncommitted. Millares rolls
and holes his hessian, sews up its
wounds, and stains it red and black
and drops some red to show that some-
where something bleeds. Compared
with such coarse carnality, Samstag’s
white constructions in bas-relief are
ephemerally elegant. In some later
works a half-inch-deep disc is placed
on a square; in Bull’s Eye (at $100; is
Samstag the puncturer of the swollen
price?) the action-paint rolls the disc.
Double Bay, a white scape with wooden
blocks by the black sea, exemplifies
his attitude that painting is an investi-
gation. If there’s not much passion at
work there is a temperament, a fine
detachment at policy, and, as Mael-
strom makes clear, a deal of concealed
adventurousness.
It is not adventurous today to be
ecole-de-Paris, but in moving to more
colorful and open forms and in pre-
serving la belle matiere, Use Tauber,
in her abstracts, reminds us of our
debt to France and how fashion and
attitudes to de Gaulle lead us to forget
that France does have a culture.
Films
Long night
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Night of the Generals. Director,
Anatole Litvak. Gambit. Director,
Ronald Neame.
WE HAVE SEEN some pretty poor
blockbusters of late, what with “The
Agony and the Ecstasy” and “Hawaii,”
but “Night of the Generals” leaves
them standing. In fact, with the year
less than half over, it’s already a hot
prospect for the worst film of 1967.
This story of a German general who
in his spare time is a murderer of
prostitutes on the Jack-the-Ripper
pattern might in shorter form have
made an acceptable thriller. By inflat-
ing it to its present length the makers
have shown up all the weaknesses of
its threadbare plot.
The film keeps wandering off to
show us the destruction of Warsaw,
the assassination attempt on Hitler’s
life, the miraculous prosperity of the
new Germany. Even Rommel turns up
momentarily just in time to be
wounded by Allied strafing (which I’m
sure he wasn’t); Christopher Plummer,
who plays the role, looks just as sur-
prised to be there as we are to see
him. In between times the film poses
the tired old question: during the mass
slaughter of war, do a few private
murders really matter? This specious
argument has been advanced to justify
the sordid killings for gain of Landru,
but this film takes no sides on the
matter.
Even the vacillating viewpoint and
Litvak’s lukewarm direction might be


forgivable if the central performance
were adequate, but Peter O’Toole’s
performance is comically bad.
Henri Decae’s color photography is
extremely pleasing, of course, and
there are sound performances from
Courtenay, Philippe Noiret, and
Donald Pleasance, who obviously don’t
intend to make fools of themselves
however dotty the film becomes. Other-
wise, the main interest is in the various
pronunciations of “whore,” a word
which is bandied about a good deal.
A few players pronounce it in the
generally accepted way, to rhyme with
“bore,” but most of them use variants
of “hoor” and “who-er.” As for
O’Toole, he barks disapprovingly: “She
was only a haw!”
It’s a relief to get to a movie with
more modest claims; “Gambit” pleas-
antly fulfils its sole function of enter-
taining. A would-be international crook
enlists the aid of a Hong Kong taxi-
dancer to steal an art treasure from an
Eastern billionaire, who turns out not
to be as gullible as the thieves had
hoped.
As the movie progresses it gets rather
entangled in its own trickiness and
begins to lose momentum. Fortunately,
it ends before it runs down altogether.
Shirley MacLaine, Michael Caine, and
Herbert Lorn play their roles with the
exact degree of off-hand expertise;
Ronald Neame’s direction is light and
deft, and the robbery sequence has a
good deal more suspense than similar
sequences in “Topkapi” and “How To
Steal a Million.” Above all, there is a
disarming amiability in “Gambit”
both crooks and victim are so genuinely
likable that you find yourself wanting
them all to win, which in a roundabout
way they do.
Music
Sweet and small
By PAUL FROLICH
Julian Bream. Lute and guitar. Town
Hall, Sydney.
LAST JULY I reported on the bril-
liant lute and guitar accompaniments
which Julian Bream supplied for Peter
Pears at the Bath Festival. Although
the vast reaches of the Sydney Town
Hall proved a less satisfying venue, it
was thrilling to hear Bream again, in a
solo recital. The lute, even more than
the guitar, demands a degree of
intimacy and this could not be found
in the Town Hall; worse, the lute’s
sound is so small that listeners in the
rear of the hall must have missed much
fine detail.
As Mr. Bream pointed out in his
genial asides, both instruments are very
ancient, though not directly related.
The first half of the program was
given over to the Renaissance lute, a
Julian Bream
plucked instrument of 14 strings, in
Renaissance music from Spain, Ger-
many, Flanders, Poland, Italy, and
England. The works included some of
the earliest published lute music by
Dalza, from a Venetian collection of
1508, two lovely Pavans by Luis Milan,
originally written for the vihuela and
published in 1536, and a thoroughly
stylish Fantasia of 1610 by Gregorio
Howett. Although the lute’s dynamic
range is as restricted as that of the
clavichord —which, at times, it rather
resembles in tone color —it is capable
of great expressiveness. Julian Bream
is probably the greatest living per-
former on this near-extinct instrument
and his sure sense of musicianship, of
nuances in style and intonation, as well
as his sure phrasing made this part of
the evening an occasion of great joy.
By today’s standards, much of the
music of this period seems measured
and stately, and it became apparent that
the lute is at its most convincing when
it reflects sadness, as in Dlugoraj’s
“Villanelle” and, above all, in Dow-
land’s “Forlorne Hope” fancy. The
two Dowland works, published in 1610,
were the most individual and per-
suasive of the lute pieces heard.
In the second half of the recital,
Julian Bream played the more familiar
Spanish guitar, an instrument of bigger
tone and with a repertoire which spans
many centuries. Guitarists, even very
fine guitarists, have ceased to be rarities
in our experience and we have some
standards of comparison for reference.
Julian Bream’s playing, if not of
Segovia’s mastership, is exceedingly
fine. His is not the breathtaking virtu-
osity we’ve heard from Gonzales and,
quite recently, from the fiery Alirio
Diaz, nor would one want it to be such.
The guitar recital opened with
Gaspar Sanz’s “Pavana” and “Canarios,”
of 1674, works which Mr. Bream has
also recently recorded. He followed
with Bach’s E minor Suite, a work
originally written for the baroque lute
of some 20 strings; though this is by no
means a major Bach work, it is a
thoroughly enjoyable setting of 17th-
century dances and received brilliant
treatment.
In complete contrast was Frank
Martin’s “Quatre Pieces Breve,” of
1933, a cold and arid composition of
purely intellectual content, yet one
giving the performer opportunities for
proving discerning musicianship. The
finest moment of the guitar recital
came near the end with Manuel de
Falla’s noble “Homenaje pour le Tom-
beau de Debussy,” a proud and im-
passioned tribute not only to Debussy
but also to the persuasive powers of
the guitar in the right hands.
Julian Bream’s mild and informal
stage manner tends to deceive one into
accepting his recital as no more than
an evening of friendly music-making.
It is only afterwards, on reflection, that
the magnitude of his musical achieve-
ment comes truly into focus and that
one appreciates the lucidity of his
playing and the uncommon delicacy of
his style.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Huffing and bluffing on wheat
THINGS ARE NOT quite as bleak for Australian wheat
exports as last week’s strong complaints in London by Trade
Minister John McEwen would suggest. Mr. McEwen has
gone storming out of London berating the British for being
unreasonable about wheat prices. He went away saying he
hoped to have British support in the Kennedy Round talks
for a substantial rise in the minimum price of the new inter-
national wheat agreement.
Mr. McEwen is, of course, to be encouraged to do his best
for Australian wheatfarmers and for Australia, and in trade
negotiations you have to do plenty of huffing and bluffing
as part of the act. The danger, however, with all politicians
is that they may get taken in by their own propaganda.
And the realities are not so very bad at present. For one
thing, the Common Market offer of a floor price is, contrary
to expectations, better than the British. It is U. 5.51.72, or
$1.53 Australian a bushel, slightly more than the present
world market price; the Americans have been bargaining for
U. 5.51.85 and Mr. McEwen has even been talking about
U. 5.52.00 according to some accounts.
The danger is that, having started his bargaining so high,
Mr. McEwen may feel unable to climb down to realistic
levels. We do not want to get left outside the agreement, but
the logic of the Trade Minister’s argument leads him to just
this position. He is going around saying that at present we
sell wheat way below cost of production and that we cannot
enter into a “contract to go broke.” The fact is, of course,
that the official “cost of production” he mentions is nothing
of the sort. If it were a real measure, most of Australia’s
wheatfarmers would have gone broke long ago and the rest
would be curtailing their sowings. In fact, wheatgrowing
has been bountifully profitable in recent years (except for the
drought year) and acreages have soared. Yields this year
were 22 bushels per acre, compared with the 17 on which
the official index of costs is based.
The sum result is that we are doing very nicely indeed
on market prices of U. 5.51.65-$1.70 and the offer of a floor
price above this level is an improvement. A rational world
without barriers to trade might produce the price of $2.00,
which Mr. McEwen seeks, but, not being all that big in the
world scheme of things, we will simply have to settle for
much less. One would hope that a united front of U.S.,
Canada, and Australia could coax the EEC up a few cents

MEN AND MATTERS
UNACCUSTOMED AS IT is to losing
takeover battles around the world,
Viyella International looks to have just
about met its match taking on the in-
domitable Melbourne company lawyer
Mr. Walter Oswald Burt, chairman of
Davies Coop, who has boxed on the
boards in some of the toughest com-
pany camps over the years.
Paper from bidder and board in this
conflict has been flying fast to share-
holders this last week or so and, in the
point counter point, Burt and his
equally determined managing director,
Philip Perry, have lost nothing either in
the argument or (apparently) in the
swing of the votes. Having nursed
Davies Coop through the long shadows
as well as enjoyed its sunshine when it
was a textile leader on ’Change, “Ossie”
Burt at 73 is putting up the fight of his
lifetime and the company is with him
to the last Yarraville millhand to stop
the rape.
This could be about the last of Burt’s
big company scraps. He has eased out
of most of his directorships these past
few years. Although he is still its
adviser and remains much in the saddle
as of yore, he has retired from the
partnership of Oswald Burt and Co.,
the legal firm he built up as a young
man not long out of Melbourne Uni-
versity, where he went straight from
the high school at Warrnambool, his
native city, in the Western District.
These days Mr.
Burt spends more
time at home with
his wife and the
fine arts at his
mansion in
Toorak than in
the city. But
apart from Davies
Coop he still
keeps on a few
directorships, such
as the National
Trustees Execu-
tors and Agency
and the City Mutual Life, to keep his
hand in and ponder perhaps the evil
day he met up with the masters of
Stanhill.
WHEN FRANK McDOWELL left
school at 15 in 1904 to join his father’s
drapery business, it was just a small
shop in King Street; last week when he
retired at 77 after 31 years as manag-
ing director (he is to remain as chair-
man), the assets of his group of city
and suburban retail stores totalled
about $9 million.
In keeping with the family nature of
retailing in Australia, his retirement
will not mean an end to McDowell
control by any means. All his six
sons are in the business; the new
managing director is Mr. John, Mr.
Brian runs the big new Caringbah
store, Mr. Ronald is merchandising
W. O. Burt
John McDowell
Frank McDowell
director, Mr. Keith runs Hornsby (soon
to be replaced by a 76,000 square feet
modern centre), Mr. Wilfred looks
after the non-selling functions of the
group as an associate director, and Mr.
Barry is at Caringbah.
Running McDowells (he was
manager at 25, seven years before it
went public, and became managing
director and chairman in 1936 when
his father died) has not been enough
to use up all Frank McDowell’s time
and energy. Apart from being very
active in the Retail Traders’ Associa-
tion, he was Grand Master of the
United Grand Lodge of N.S.W. from
1947 to 1951, which involved a great
deal of travelling around, is a past
president of the Rotary Club of Sydney,
has been an active charity worker, is a
keen bowler, and still swims at Cronulla
every morning, winter and summer,
before work.


with the floor price and bring the Brits along, too. And
most important, they must he cajoled into supporting a
combined food aid program for underdeveloped countries
based on a price not so much lower. Mr. McEwen could
use his emotional oratory in appealing for European co-
operation there.
We cannot possibly come out of the talks worse off than at
present if we are prepared to compromise. And Mr. McEwen
has rightly been speaking of the dire prospects for Aus-
tralian trade expansion should the Kennedy Round fail. The
corollary is that we must not risk contributing to this by
being too greedy on wheat.
Doing the rounds
THE WONDER is, of course, that Mr. McEwen is in
Europe at all at this moment, except that he likes to be
on the inside when Britain is talking seriously of leaving the
overseas Commonwealth in the economic lurch and is
hopeful of salvaging something. Wouldn’t his presence have
been more valuable to Australia in Japan this last week
when the Pacific Basin Economic Organisation was being
inaugurated and a host of Australian business leaders were
at large in Tokyo getting together with their Japanese
confreres on the Business Co-operation Committee?
Doubtless he will depart from the merry-go-rounds of
Europe, notably the rusted-up Kennedy-round, after a
decent interval, refreshed by the waters but daunted by
the argument and the stalemate. It is to be hoped that
while going round and round he will notice that New
Zealand is no longer taking this annual ride, as is reported
from Wellington, and is looking to the shorter journey to
Japan and America for a more profitable outcome for its
primary producers.
Some fair catering
THERE IS NOTHING new about the idea of trade fairs,
but this week’s Catering Trade Fair in Sydney is significant
on several scores. As the first trade fair organised in Aus-
tralia by the British newcomer to the local trade fair scene,
Industrial and Trade Fairs Pty. Ltd., it will give some hint
to local industrialists of the sort of approach the company
will no doubt be using in running the large-scale Inter-
national Trade Fair in October.
The current fair is, nevertheless, important in its own
right: the restaurant that gets the “restaurant of the year”
award, or whose chef wins one of the cooking awards, will
certainly feel it is all worthwhile. So, too, will the share-
holders of Anthony Horderns, in whose cavernous Brickfield
Hill store the exhibition will occupy some of the acres of
space that no longer are needed for retailing.
Textilers ascendant
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS having shots at the “inefficient”
Australian textile industry. But much of it is not nearly
so bad in world price terms as its critics would have us
believe. Last week, for example, Universal Textiles Aus-
tralia (the STP-Tennyson group), which has large overseas
sales, won a £stg.2o,ooo export contract for printed silks and
synthetics to Japan in a real “coals to Newcastle” opera-
tion. And textilers are also getting some good results in
exporting to the U.S. under the banner of the Australian
Textile Export Corporation and, with solid hacking by the
Department of Trade, Australian textile manufacturers have
more than doubled their sales to the U.S. market since
ATEC was established three years ago. If the total is still
under $1 million (in what is a huge $ll2O million imports
market for manufactured textiles in North America)
ATEC seems on sure ground in saying that the scope for
penetration is tremendous.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: In the six months’ dealings to
December, Australia’s overseas reserves fell by $lOl
million; trading on current account produced a $317
million deficit, against the previous corresponding
period’s deficit of $575 million, while net capital inflow
was some 55 percent lower at $216 million.
The Federal Government’s last loan for 1967 again
sets no target and preserves the same interest structure
as in February.
For the markets: Energy is certainly not lack-
ing throughout Australian share markets, yet retreats
among metals and leaders cut back the earlier rate of
advance. Sydney’s all ordinaries index put on a net
1.65 points, although Friday saw a 1.85 drop.
Damaged hopes were gradually restored in London
following a Monday withdrawal . . . Wall Street reached
its best point of the year on Friday; dealings are,
however, quite mixed.
For companies: Defence did not preclude some
pretty testy attacks on the takeover front . . . Motor
dealer Stack and Co. finds Industrial Equity’s offer
“preposterous” and of no conceivable benefit to most
shareholders; in this matter also, General Motors-
Holden’s has made clear that its franchise is non-
transferable . . . Davies Coop’s board has rejected
Viyella International’s bid as “unrealistic” and its
employees are swinging into a “fighting fund” . . . The
Ingham brothers’ attempt to secure Golden Poultry
Farming may be thwarted in the share markets, where
British Tobacco-Allied Mills appear to have bought
their way to victory . . . R. W. Miller won’t tell how
much Tooheys paid for the brewery ... In a calmer,
though competitive, atmosphere, Thomas Nationwide
Transport and Alltrans Group completed their merger
(through TNT) in a $3 million-plus deal.
Big deals are afoot at Consolidated Metal Products,
beginning with the cash acquisition of Adelaide-based
scrap-metal merchant W. Brown and Sons Pty.; finance
will come from a one-for-three issue of $1 shares at $2
and 540,000 shares placed with Mount Morgan, also at
$2.
Engineer and appliance maker A. G. Healing won’t
earn any profit this year or, as it’s been put, “is not
expected to reach profitability during the current
financial year”; the loss to December totalled $741,698
. . . Transmission unit maker Borg-Warner (Australia)
is again profitable and anticipates a “satisfactory” year.
The Commonwealth’s restrictions on exporting
uranium oxide took a pasting from CRA’s chairman,
Sir Maurice Mawby, and the chairman of Mary Kathleen
Uranium, Mr. Blake Belly; both agreed the policy would
not assist the finding of further reserves . . . Sir Maurice
told the CRA meeting that the group has proved con-
siderably more copper at Bougainville . . . It’s .scarcely
necessary to set down that Hamersley Holdings’ public
issued opened, and closed forthwith oversubscribed.
Less cheerful sounds derive from Broken Hill South,
which believes its 1966-67 earnings will fall from $3.2
million to about $2.2 million; lead and zinc prices are
mostly to blame, so the first interim payment goes back
from 5 cents to 3 cents a share.
An appliance giant, Kelvinator Australia, had to suffer
an 11 percent profit decline, to $828,175, in the year
ended March; characteristically, tax provision is above
declared profit and dividend remains 15 percent.
Biscuits, bread, and flour rocketed George Weston’s
1966 turnover 27 percent to $91.9 million . . . Grocer
Moran and Cato is bound for a successful year . . . But
wholesale butcher Tancred Bros, suffers earnings at a
“drastically reduced” rate ... To end mournfully,
Mark Foy’s lost $140,110 in its year to January, after
a previous $71,424 profit; the dividend disappears.

Containers on the move
Shipping in the ’seventies
BY CROESUS
THOUGH THEY ARE laudable in
themselves, moves by the Department
of Trade to get another Australian
group organised (with foreign backing)
to establish container-unit load facili-
ties at our main capital ports have to
be seen in the perspective of the cut-
and-dried Government prospects for
the future shape of our overseas ship-
ping services as outlined by the Acting
Minister of the Department, Mr. lan
Sinclair, at the recent shipping con-
ference arranged by the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce. That prospec-
tus leaves containerisation in the
overseas cargo liner trades wholly in the
hands of overseas shipping companies
and confines Australian interest to the
provision of on-shore facilities. It fails
to mention the possible entry of
Australian-owned ships into the over-
seas cargo liner trades and would seem
to envisage the only prospective field
for a national overseas line to be the
bulk trades, though it didn’t mention
the latter as a possibility, either.
Nobody can question that, even if it
bad to wield the bin stick of the Trade
lan Sinclair
Practices Act in the process, the hard
line the Government has been taking
with overseas shipping groups in the
past few years has produced results.
One can only surmise that in getting
them the Government gave some assur-
ances, perhaps only vague ones, that
it would keep out of containerisation.
Anway, if the apparent absence of
intention to start a national overseas
line will disappoint a lot of people
(despite Dr. Hunter’s very limited
range of commercial possibilities for
such a line), it is something that the
Government has succeeded so well
along its own chosen lines. At no ex-
pense to itself, but plenty to the ship-
owners (containerisation in the U.K.
trades will cost them at least s2oom
in new capital outlay alone), it has
galvanised those now carrying the great
bulk of our overseas trade to the task
of modernisation and rationalisation
of their services without them being at
all certain either that the resulting in-
crease in efficiency will ultimately be
reflected in freight rates or that they’ll
make more money out of it.
The first result of the Government’s
efforts is seen in the rationalising of
sailing dates in the U.K.-Continent
trades, which has been in effect for six
months or more. This involved getting
agreement between fifteen separate
companies embracing seven different
nationalities. From what Sir Donald
Anderson, chairman of P & O, one of
the groups involved, has been saying
recently, the Government followed up
its original blueprint for this scheme
with great energy, not to say pressure,
and swung in the shipping provision
of the Trade Practices Act to ensure
the combination of companies would
not abuse its implied new strength.
If it be granted that such rationalis-
ation would in any case have been
speeded by the advent of containeris-
ation, it will be seen that an even more
important achievement by the Govern-
ment has been to get overseas lines to
embark on containerisation. As this step
will ultimately involve the writing-off
of vast sums at present invested by these
lines in the conventional ships at present
carrying the trade, as well as the finding
of new capital for building container
ships and the material equipment in-
volved in providing the facilities to
employ them, the magnitude of the
exercise is obvious.
The integrated arrangements for the
containerisation of the U.K. trades have
held most of the spotlight, but con-
tainerisation plans for other trades are
also advanced. In the overall picture,
we now know that fully container ves-
sels will be moving in three of our
major overseas trades by 1970.
By the end of 1969 our trade to and
from the U.K. of cargo able to be
put into containers is likely to be fully
covered by specially designed, fully
container vessels. The eight British
shipping companies operating to Aus-
tralia have formed themselves into two
consortia Overseas Containers Ltd.
and Associated Container Transporta-
tion Ltd. Between them they will have
nine ships in service by the end of 1969,
using common facilities in both Aus-
tralia and the U.K. These vessels will
service three terminal ports in Aus-
tralia Sydney, Melbourne, and
Fremantle. Other ports will feed these
by transhipment.
Australian interests will participate
in the on-shore operations of these con-
sortia at the Australian end through
Seatainer Pty. Ltd., which is half-owned
by the local company Associated Steam-

ships Pty. Ltd. (Australian industry is
also expected to benefit by OCL’s
spending here of initially between $2-
$3 million dollars for the construction
of containers themselves, and an even
bigger sum on the construction of shore-
based gantry cranes).
In trades other than to the U.K.
planning is also advanced, although
less definite. Farrell Lines has
announced its intention to build five
container ships in the East Coast,
North America, to Australia trade
and expects the first of these to com-
mence operations toward the end of
1969. Also, Japanese shipowners have
ordered the construction of two con-
tainer vessels, with the possibility of
others, which are scheduled to start
operations early in 1970. Under a dif-
ferent type of system, but nonetheless
of vital importance to Australia,
Union Steamship Company has
ordered two “roll on, roll off” vessels
for the Australian-New Zealand trade.
In his Melbourne address Sinclair
said he was quite happy at the arrange-
ments made by local interests for the
provision of on-shore services for the
U.K. trades, that is by Seatainers Ltd.,
but that for other trades nothing had
so far been arranged and, indeed,
Australian interests were dragging their
feet in that direction.
As is now revealed, the Department
of Trade has a scheme for the estab-
lishment of these terminals in which
it is trying to get both overseas (Con-
tinental and Japanese) shipping com-
panies as well as Australian groups
interested. It is rather strange that Mr.
Sinclair didn’t mention this in Mel-
bourne as a follow-up to his exhorta-
tion to local companies to enter the
field, because at about the same time
the secretary of the Department was
outlining it to a conference of European
shipowners in Amsterdam and is under-
stood to be putting it before Japanese
shipowners in the course of his present
visit to Japan for the inauguration of
the Pacific Basin Organisation.
Be this as it may, apparently local
interests have been looking at the pos-
sibilities but showing no signs of being
in a hurry to rush in. That is under-
standable, because there are as yet no
assurances about precisely what sort
of facilities will be required for on-
shore servicing of the non-U.K. trades,
whose containerisation plans are not as
firrn as those for the U.K. trades and,
in fact, look more like a bird in the
bush at this stage. Neither local nor
overseas capital, of which tens of
millions would be required to set up
and run a second network of terminals
for them at the main Australian ports,
is going to commit itself until the bird
comes nearer to hand. It is going to
take two to three years to get facilities
to service the U.K. container trade in
position and on present indications
those for the other trades will take a
good deal longer.


WILD CAT PAGES
A digest of meat companies
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
THERE IS NO DOUBT that this
year’s results from the meat companies
are all going to be awful; that has been
fairly widely predicted for a year or so
as an inevitable consequence of the
drought. But the market’s belated
realisation of the extent of the down-
swing in profits and the severity of its
reductions in the prices of meat com-
pany shares gives those counter-cyclical
buyers with stout hearts and strong
stomachs an opportunity to lick their
chops.
Interim reports from all the com-
panies have been very poor (despite
T. A. Field’s attempts to give things a
brighter look) and the receivership
news for Anderson Meat Industries
deepened the gloom that has persisted
over this section of the market since the
drought reached its peak more than a
year ago. Share prices for the whole
industry are at bargain levels com-
pared with 18 months to two years ago.
The latest problem is not only due
to the drought (as the period following
a drought, when graziers are more
interested in restocking than in market-
ing run-down beasts, can be much more
difficult for the meat companies than
the drought itself). There have also
been disturbances in the U.K. market
that could have a look of permanence
about them if Britain joins the
Common Market. British meat prices,
under all sorts of measures, have been
well down at a time when Australian
meat costs have been well up.
Tancred’s news last week of a “dras-
tically reduced” profit so far this year
emphasised the problems the company
was striking with its extensive export
trade; “abnormal circumstances” caused
a marked decline in prices so that the
company was not able to trade profit-
ably in the export market (where it
appears to have carried the bulk of its
profits in recent years). Conkey also
reported losses on exports.
The facts behind the poorer interim
reports are that total Australian produc-
tion of beef and veal and lamb and
mutton was fairly steady in the De-
cember half-year. But because pro-
ducers were reluctant to part with then-
stock, prices rose sharply. And because
of consumer resistance, both in Aus-
tralia and overseas, the meat companies
say they have not been able to pass on
all those price rises (meat consumption
per head has fallen in Australia any-
way, from those rises that were passed
on).
Australia’s total meat exports never-
theless rose in both volume and value
compared with the corresponding six
months of 1965-66; and the higher
prices mean that a 5 percent increase
in volume has brought almost a 20 per-
cent rise in value. This has been due
mainly to the big rise in exports (and
prices) to the U.S., as a 40 percent rise
in volume brought a 60 percent lift in
value. Japanese exports jumped from
million to $4.2 million for the
December half-year; this only helped
offset the fall from $3 million to
million in sales to Italy.
But the U.S. trade has not brought
price rises commensurate with the rise
in local costs; average prices of exports
to the U.S. rose only from 30.7 cents a
lb. to 35.0 cents. This was a trade in
which Andersons were big. In 1965
they accounted for about 12 percent of
Australia’s meat exports to the U.S.
Eventually, the meat companies will
emerge from this dismal period. In the
meantime they all sound glum as they
list the problems they face, such as in
F. J. Walker’s recent interim report,
which was nevertheless heartening in
the sense that directors had enough con-
fidence about the future to continue to
pay a steady dividend even though it
was not covered by profits.
And T. A. Field, which reduced its
interim rate following lower earnings
for the first six months, spoke of an
improvement in the current period,
adding that the season in Queensland
was excellent and that, as it continued,
supplies of stock should pick up.
Conkey, the Cootamundra-based
company, maintained its profits in the
first half, but is now in a decline, with
its export business operating at a loss.
As Tancred appeared to earn most of
its profits in recent years from its
exports, and as its local trading has also
been affected by the livestock shortage
and high prices, the company’s current
earnings would seem to be very low
indeed, although directors have unfor-
tunately not indicated whether condi-
tions were remaining as difficult in the
current half-year, most of which has
already passed.
This industry will take a while to
recover, but as world meat consump-
tion continues to rise, its recovery has
a look of inevitability about it for those
prepared to wait.
ALL RIGHT, so it is a dreary company
with a dreadful record. But last week’s
chairman’s address of Courtaulds (Aus-
tralia) Ltd. did not seem to warrant
a 3 cent fall in the price of the
$1 shares to 47 cents (at which price,
by the way, the shares yield a hand-
some 8.3 percent from the steady 4
percent dividend).
Naturally the market is uneasy about
this stock, whose fourth successive fall
The Chartist says:
BRITISH TOBACCO was first reviewed with the tobacco stocks in the issue
of February 12, 1966, when the charts indicated that this stock appeared to be
commencing a new growth phase; a target of $2.40 was indicated at that time
after allowing for the stock split. This objective was achieved in June, 1966, and,
after a reaction back to the $2.00 level, a further large consolidation pattern has
since formed, suggesting that prices could rise eventually to approximately $3.40
for the longer term. Some reaction would be possible to the recent fast rise, which
took prices to a new high of $2.57 and at the same time broke resistance levels
formed in 1960, 1966, and 1967. Last sale price on 24/4/67 $2.56.

Marketing
Management
This appointment initially in Melbourne will appeal
to the man who is confident about his readiness, while
still relatively young, to join the senior management
ranks in a very large marketing company.
He will probably be handling a big job for his age
already and required to make day-to-day decisions
under highly competetive sales marketing conditions.
His age would be about 30 and he must have completed
a tertiary qualification, which could be either tech-
nically of commercially oriented. Experience predomin-
antly in the Accounting function would not be con-
sidered suitable.
Big-company experience is not necessary. However, it
is important to have the personal qualities for a new-
comer to fit in with a largescale operation.
Because this is a complex organisation, a familiarisa-
tion period will be necessary before the successful
applicant can expect to function at a level of full
responsibility. Accordingly, a program of short-term
assignments will be planned and it will be up to the
individual to turn these to maximum advantage for
his own and the company’s benefit.
Success will require a high degree of dedication and
determination. Short and long range prospects are
excellent and include the possibility of promotions out-
side Australia.
We feel salary should not be a major concern at this
stage, but as a guide our client certainly has some-
thing to offer a man currently earning $6,000 p.a.
or more.

in earning rate to only 4.9 percent on
paid capital has endangered even the
modest payout now being made. But
things really do look as if they are
getting “less worse” with this company.
The chairman is a little more optimistic
about things, especially as the swing
to radial ply tyres, which are almost
exclusively reinforced with viscose tyre
cord that Courtaulds makes with such
striking lack of financial success, should
help the company’s sales of what is still
its major product (despite the consider-
able expansion in recent times of the
textile side of its operations where its
acetate yarn spinning capacity rose
again last year in response to “steady
growth in demand”).
“The market for viscose tyre yarn and
fabrics has perhaps reached its turning
point which should bring some improve-
ment in results in the current year,”
the chairman said last week. In addi-
tion, the 10 percent emergency duty
on tyre cord imposed last month (while
the Tariff Board continues its two-year
investigation into what should be done
to help the industry) will clearly bring
some benefits, and there is a good
chance that the current investigation
into allegations of “dumping” of foreign
(Japanese) motor car tyre makers
could also help the company.
Courtauld’s top U.K. management is
coming out here shortly to have a good
look at things, which could have con-
siderable implications for the whole
Courtaulds structure in Australia, where
the British company also has a big in-
vestment in Taubmans and owns
Kayser. This visit gains added signi-
ficance following last year’s comments
from the U.K. parent that a broadening
of the base of the Australian subsidiary
was essential to its long-term future. At
47 cents Courtaulds Australia looks a
very promising speculation.
LAST WEEK’S ITEM on Colonial
Sugar Refining’s stake in the Mt. New-
man project referred to a Melbourne
inevestment counsellor’s doubts that
CSR could put up the $11.4 million
equity capital required out of its own
resources. However, a check through
my notes from a recent visit to Perth
shows that CSR has already spent $4
million on the venture, so that it still
has to find only $7.4 million over a
few years, which should not prove too
difficult a task from internal sources
particularly as it is getting $1 m. or so
from Wittenoom, to reduce the amount
needed to about $6.4 million.
In any event, when CSR directors
announced a slightly lower interim pro-
fit last December they said that, on
present indications, funds being
generated within the company should
be sufficient to meet all foreseeable re-
quirements of its iron ore and bauxite
developments during the next year or
two. It is understood that nothing has
happened to change that forecast.

Mining
CRA —the values of diversity
THE ANNUAL REPORT of Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia Limited shows
once again the company’s remarkable
ability in maintaining a flow of profits
from such diverse enterprises as lead
and zinc mining to brick making and
timber milling. The report, which, inch
dentally, provides a very high standard,
indeed, for other companies to emulate,
gives a dissection of profits according
to source and the changes in these
sources from the 1965 figures are of
considerable interest.
While profit from the mining of lead
and zinc fell from $8,128,000 in 1965
to $6,468,000 in 1966, the smelting of
these metals accounted for an increase
in profit of $555,000. As Broken Hill
Associated Smelters Pty. Limited (50
percent owned) did not increase its
dividend last year, this increase appears
to have come from CRA’s 75 percent
owned Sulphide Corporation Pty. Ltd.
Production of actual metal by this sub-
sidiary was lower than last year, but
total sales of zinc appeared to have
increased considerably.
The acid-fertiliser-chemicals section
contributed only $lll,OOO to 1966
profits against $444,000 in 1965. This
fall was directly due to reduced demand
for sulphuric acid and lower sales of
superphosphate due to severe drought
conditions in New South Wales. Last
year saw the first production of
sulphuric acid from Greenleaf Fertilisers
Limited, of 39,470 tons, and this pro-
duction should allow an additional con-
tribution to profits once the level of
industrial activity allows sales to in-
crease.
CRA’s building materials division
notched up an increase of $227,000 in
profit and as the Heron’s Creek timber
mills at Port Macquarie saw a reduction
in sales to the domestic market, the
RT brick company at Camberfield in
Victoria appears to have provided most
of this increase, as production and sales
were higher and substantial reductions
in cost were achieved. Last year this
subsidiary made its first contribution
to group profits after experiencing some
production difficulties in 1964. How-
ever, it is now firmly established and
should continue to provide comparable
profits to the 1966 figure.
CRA’s beach sand mining, which is
conducted through Titanium and Zir-
conium Industries Pty. Limited, appears
to have had a fairly difficult year. In
the 1965 report it was stated that pro-
duction capacity was doubled during
the second half of that year—but pro-
duction for 1965 was 18,733 tons of
rutile against 16,314 tons in 1964. In
the year to December last, rutile pro-
duction reached only 19,695 tons, due
to metallurgical and other operating
problems. The curtailment of con-
tracted deliveries meant a fall in profit
from this source of the considerable
sum of $328,000. (CRA is not the only
beach sand miner on North Stradbroke
Island to be experiencing production
difficulties; Consolidated Rutile is also
having its share of problems from
mining these deposits.)
A significant contribution to last
year’s profits came from CRA’s small
copper deposit at Rum Jungle, in the
Northern Territory. Profit from this
source increased from the $116,000
earned in 1965 to $965,000 for 1966,
an advance of $849,000. This deposit
contained 10,000 tons when mining


began in 1964 and when mining was
completed in November, 1965, a total
of 416,000 tons of ore had been ex-
tracted. Production of copper concen-
trates proceeded during 1965 and 1966
and will be completed soon. The
operation is a good example of the
generous rewards to be obtained by
the efficient mining of a fairly small
ore body of reasonable grade.
The increase of $488,000 in dividends
received from Comalco Industries Pty.
Limited (50 percent owned) reflected
considerably higher exports of bauxite
from deposits at Weipa, in northern
Queensland, as well as improved
efficiency from Comalco’s smelter at
Bell Bay, in Tasmania. Comalco should
be a source of further profit increments
from increased capacity installed
during the year. Construction of the
main operating plant owned by Queens-
land Alumina (8 percent owned by
CRA) at Gladstone has been completed
and production on a commercial scale
is to commence soon.
While income from investments and
other activities dropped by $851,000
from $975,000 to $124,000, Hamersley
Holdings Limited contributed its
maiden profit of $341,000. This profit
was earned from the shipment of
697,000 tons of iron ore up to the end
of last year and it needs little repeating
that this project will be a source of
considerable increments to group pro-
fit in the future.
With the latest upward movement
in the market, CRA has become Aus-
tralia’s second most valuable mining
enterprise after BHP, and its attain-
ing this position is quite appropriate in
that the similarity between the two
companies increases as time goes on.
BHP originally commenced operations
at Broken Hill and financed its entry
into the iron and steel industry out of
profits from lead and zinc mining,
while CRA still receives the major
(73.2 percent) portion of its profits
from the mining and smelting of these
metals. From these profits CRA has
also financed an interest in the iron
and steel industry through the develop-
ment of its 54 percent owned Hamers-
ley Holdings Limited. CRA’s interest
in this company is paralleled by BHP’s
equity interest in, and management of,
the development of the Mount New-
man iron ore deposits.
In other aspects, too, the similarities
are increasing; both have interests in
off-shore drilling for oil and gas in
the Bass Strait, both spend considerable
amounts on exploration, and both have
extended their operations into fabri-
cation. Certainly the development plans
of both companies have considerable
significance on a national scale, and
the two companies are remarkably
similar in that both earn slightly more
than 4 percent on total assets em-
ployed. While one would expect the
steel-making activities of BHP to be
a capital intensive business, it is in-
teresting to note that for each of its
48,000 employees, BHP uses assets
worth $lB,OOO against CRA’s assets of
$30,000 per employee. Perhaps this is
the reason for the high productivity
of the 10,000 CRA employees, who
earn an apparent profit of $l2OO each,
compared to BHP’s profit of $760 per
employee.
Commodities
There's still too much sugar
ALTHOUGH THE sugar market has
finally shaken free from the glut of
nearby supplies and is taking a
more optimistic view of the future,
there is still too much sugar being pro-
duced. This basic fact will inhibit the
free market more and more as prices
move away from the disastrous lows
of around £stgl2 a ton set last year.
At over £22 a ton, prices have regained
the level of early last year but are
still £lO at least below the world
average cost of production and £5 or
so below the most efficient producers’
average.
The latest overall review of produc-
tion and consumption in 1966-67, made
early this year, indicated a surplus of
2.5 million tons on production of 66.5 m
tons. This would mean a further
addition to stocks already 2.5 million
tons above what could be called a
“reasonable” level.
Recent reports indicate production
cuts in several areas this season, the
main developments being Puerto Rico
down 700,000 tons and Chile possibly
500,000 tons less than expected. The
Queensland floods have caused crop
losses of probably over 200,000 tons,
while India has cut exports from
441,000 tons to 300,000.
The net outcome of various rises
and falls in production and the off-
take last year of sugar for non-food
uses (such as chemicals) should mean
a lower-than-expected surplus this
season. The exact result is very diffi-
cult to foresee and the next forecast
by the leading sugar statisticians will
be of some interest.
Nevertheless, for those who don’t
mind a gamble, sugar and sugar
millers and growers’ shares have
become an interesting proposition. The
Brisbane Stock Exchange’s sugar index
(covering all producers except CSR)
has lifted to around 105, against last
year’s low of 98 but is still well
below the 135 levels of 15 months ago.
On the whole it seems clear that the
sugar market has passed the trough.
If Brazil decides to put 500,000 tons
into merchants’ hands as it did this
time last year, prices would probably
lift to around £lB again. This is not
likely both because of last year’s
horrible lesson and because the
country’s marketing is under new con-
trol.
So there continues to be a less
pessimistic air in the market, although
there is still no confirmation in hard
figures.
ACCORDING to the head of the
world’s largest nickel producer, Inter-
national Nickel, the nickel supply pos-
ition is currently better than it was at
some stages last year. “A few customers
are not fully taking up their alloca-
tions,” Mr. Henry S. Wingate, chair-
man of Inco, said recently.
First quarter output this year was
at less than capacity, while there will
be more room for expansion as capacity
lifts later this year. On the other hand,
if the unprecedented growth in con-
sumption of the past few years con-
tinues, Mr. Wingate has doubts whether
supply will overtake demand until the
current three-year mine-expansion pro-
gram is completed.
The net result of all this is as pointed
out last week, that nickel is a strongly
growing industry but it would be a
mistake to put too much faith in the
current “free market” values which are
twice the £702 a ton produce price.
WITH CONTINUED closures of zinc
plants, and the view of New Broken
Hill’s chairman that easier world credit
conditions mean that the lead-zinc
surplus has passed the worst, there still
seems little chance for recovery inside
18 months. The current phase of ex-
pansion in output of the two metals
is not yet over — : and won’t be for
about a year in the case of lead and
two years for zinc.
The new zinc plant being commis-
sioned is balancing the older mines
and plants being put into moth-balls.
But lead-zinc miners are accustomed to
weathering temporary surpluses, and
keep their sights on the longer run.
And although not such spectacular per-
formances as some other metals, lead
and zinc face solid gains.
Recent figures on consumption in de-
veloping countries show zinc are up
from 60,000 tons in 1950 to 311,000
tons last year. In the same period, lead
use in developing areas lifted from
94,000 to 242,000 tons.
If this growth is maintained in
coming years, developing countries
would take over 400,000 tons of zinc
by 1970 and 500,000 tons in 1975.
Lead use would be 300,000 tons by
1970 and 400,000 tons five years later.
This sort of strong growth provides a
good cushion for any bumps experi-
enced in the larger but less buoyant
industrial nations’ markets.


Reid to look up
Trailing its (North West) Cape
By PELIAS in Melbourne
NOW THAT Concrete Industries
(Monier) Ltd., the main victim of the
North West Cape affair, has recovered
almost to par, it seems reasonable to
have a look at another sufferer, Mel-
bourne-based contractor G. H. Reid
(Constructions) Ltd., which is still 20
cents below its 50 cent par value.
Like Concrete Industries, G. H. Reid
is not yet back on the dividend list but
it is doing a lot better than last year,
and a dividend should not be too far
away. Even if directors decide against
a payout for the current year, the
respectable earning rate that seems
likely should bring some rise in share
prices from current levels around the
30 cents mark.
G. H. Reid’s involvement in the North
West Cape project brought about a loss
in 1964-65, the group’s second full year
on the public lists. By 1965-66 the
accounts were showing profits again
($106,000) and, for the first half of the
current year, a “worthwhile increase”
in earnings was reported. It is believed
that the trend is continuing in the
current six months, so it would be fair
to expect a decent improvement on last
year’s 6.2 percent earning rate.
Even if earnings leave a wide cover
for a payout of about 5 percent or so,
directors may prefer to use this to cut
down the debit balance of $161,404
(down from the previous year’s
$485,000) in the profit and loss appro-
priation account, and so may decide to
leave dividends until 1967-68. Buying
the shares now is, in effect, gambling
against this in the hope that the board
will decide to reward shareholders for
the two-year dry spell they have put up
with. But even if shareholders have to
wait a further six months for a payout,
prices around 30 cents more than take
that into account.
ANOTHER LOW-PRICED stock
worth a gamble is Pyrox. At 28 cents
the 50-cent units are well below par
and yielding 8.9 percent from last
year’s five percent dividend. Given bet-
ter times, there could be sizable capital
gains, as the shares have the capacity
to move very quickly once interest in
them starts to build up. It may only
need a steady dividend in the current
year to create this interest. Downside,
the shares should not become much
cheaper even if the dividend is omitted
again this year.
The main reason for the current
low price is the market’s belief that this
will be the case. Although the 1965-66
distribution was covered 1J times by
7.8 percent earnings, the balance sheet
revealed an acute shortage of working
capital. Moreover, the company re-
ported lower sales in the first six months
of the current year without mentioning
any profit trend. This left shareholders
to imagine the worst. However, direc-
tors predicted increased sales over the
full year. If it turns out that profit
margins have been maintained or only
slightly clipped, then another five per-
cent dividend will be possible and any
speculator willing to take the risk of
buying now will have his reward.
For those with a view to the longer
term, the group offers the cheapest pos-
sible entry into the band of companies
who stand to benefit from the intro-
duction of natural gas. Mainly under
overseas licence, the group makes gas
appliances for domestic and industrial
heating as well as gas hot-water systems.
AT LAST Prestige Ltd., the widely
diversified hosiery and lingerie com-
pany, is back on an uptrend. At 83
cents, the shares have risen something
like 10 cents in the past few weeks.
This may not leave much room for
quick capital gains but it has long-
term significance in technical terms
and the yield from the percent
dividend (which will undoubtedly be
paid for 1966-67) is about 7| percent.
The company is only just starting
to get the full benefit of mergers and
acquisitions which have approximately
doubled its size in the past two years.
The long-term result must be an in-
crease in market status and price.
For the current year, it is believed
that the company will turn in an in-
creased profit despite the lower earn-
ings announced for the first half. There
are several reasons for this, but the
main one is that the first benefits of
rationalisation in the manufacturing
divisions are starting to show through,
which is just as well as there is in-
creased capital to service this year. So
last year’s 24.4 percent earning rate
is unlikely to be achieved again for
another year or so. However, the cover
for the 12i percent dividend will still
be good.
HENRY JONES will almost certainly
earn a lower profit this year. It will
be the fifth successive decline and will
probably result in an earning rate of
about 25 percent. This will give a
double cover to the expected 12 per-
cent dividend. Because of this cover,
the temporary nature of this year’s
setback, the likelihood of a new share
issue between now and December, and'
the relatively low price for the shares
just now, an investment is probably
worth making.
The shares have been as low as
$3.35 this year and are only 13 cents
above this level at the moment to yield
3.5 percent. Apart from the prospect
of some bonus element in any new
share issue that may take place this
year, capital appreciation seems likely
to accrue in 1967-68 when the com-
pany would earn its first profit lift in
six years. Factors which have affected
profits in the current year (most not-
ably the problems in the Tasmanian
apple and pear industry) may not be
eliminated in 1967-68, but they should
not bring about any further profit
reduction.
Behind the balance sheets
Seeds of change for Fielder
WHAT A STARTLING transforma-
tion is taking place at Geo. Fielder &
Co. Ltd. The market does not yet
seem aware of it, but this old-established
Tamworth flour miller, gluten and
starch maker, with bakeries in Sydney
and Newcastle, is rapidly becoming less
dependent on its traditional operations.
Its hybrid seed interests are already a
major profit earner. Two years ago,
its 50 percent stake in the DeKalb
Shand Seed Co. Pty. Ltd. earned
Fielders only 13 percent of the group
net profit; last year it was .more than
one third. And when the Uniwager
seed project begins to pay off, the seed
business stands every chance of becom-
ing the tail that wags the Fielder dog.
Add to that the growing profitability
of Fielder’s stock foods operation (as
the New England area recovers from
the effects of last year’s drought), and
the high proportion of its flour pro-
duction that goes into gluten and
starch, and it leaves its ordinary flour
milling and bread making operations
a bad last in profit terms.
Last year, the net profit from Field-
er’s own operations dropped by about
$75,000, due to a special $lOO,OOO bad
debt write-off, indicating that its pre-
tax trading profit should otherwise have
risen by a modest $25,000 or so. At
the same time, its income from its
$127,000 investment in the DeKalb
Shand seed business jumped from
$64,444 to $160,205, so avoiding a sharp
profit fall for the group.
Ever since the company was badly
hit a few years ago by tough times for
flour, it has been strengthening its posi-
tion in other fields. It now exports only


a very small amount of flour, and the
bulk of its production is used within
its own group in other products. The
reason for the large expansion of Field-
er’s bakery interests has been to pro-
vide a guaranteed market for its flour,
and in Sydney the bakeries it has
acquired are spread in the developing
western outskirts where there is not
only great scope for future growth, but
where there is probably a greater per
capita bread consumption than in many
other parts of Sydney. These moves,
then, do not appear to be aimed at
having any large impact on profits at
present, but seem more defensive and
developmental.
In any event, it is clear the increased
business is not very profitable. If the
huge 40 percent jump in stocks to $1.5
million and the doubling of creditors to
$l.l million reflects the “increased trad-
ing through various sections of the
company,” then it is significant that
even without last year’s bad debt, pre-
tax profit from trading should have
risen by only six percent or so. (In
the latest accounts debtors were un-
changed at $1.2 million after a $32,000
provision for bad debts. The $lOO,OOO
bad debt was with an interstate starch
manufacturer now in liquidation and
some of this could be recouped.)
IN THE CURRENT YEAR flour and
bread do not seem to be doing anything
dramatic for the company. On 2.7
percent lower turnover, the company
earned 11 percent higher profits after
tax in the December half-year, sufficient
to improve earning rate on the 13 per-
cent higher ordinary capital (the
750,000 50c shares issued to Manbre
and Garton, of Britain, rank only for
the final dividend in respect of 1966-67
profits). And there seems a fair pros-
pect that investment income from seeds
provided much of this profit rise, any-
how. But if this year’s higher capital
means that earning rate for 1966-67
may not show any improvement over
last year’s 16.9 percent, the prospects
are for significant increases in future
years, even though the company’s tax
losses are running out.
In the past three years, helped by
accumulated tax losses of a subsidiary,
Fielder has paid only around 13c in the
$ tax (against the standard and
in the two preceding years it also paid
considerably less than standard tax
rates. In 1965-66 investment allowance
on new plant was also available, though
how much is hot clear, because the
$367,000 increase in fixed assets other
than land and building related to furni-
ture and motor vehicles as well as
plant and machinery, and reflects too
the acquisition of Barnes Bakery Pty.
Ltd. But the tax problem is not as big
as it looks. In the first place, the large
and growing investment income is not
taxable, so that last year’s tax bill would
normally have been only about $170,000
on the pre-tax profit of $576,000 instead
of the $76,947 that was paid following
the use of tax losses and investment
allowances. It would only need a 17
percent rise in pre-tax profit to offset
the loss of all these concessions.
This year there will be further invest-
ment allowances available from the
$300,000 wheat storage, segregation and
cleaning facilities now being installed,
so that the company will not have to
find all of this $ 100,000-odd tax gap
this year. And it still has some tax
losses to go, but not much. “Suitable
arrangements” have been made to
finance the wheat development, and
additional funds ($375,000) were pro-
vided by the recent par issue to Manbre
and Garton. Fielder has a large gluten
export trade to the U.K. Manbre and
Garton is a large starch manufacturer,
and Fielder appreciated their superior
knowledge in starch processing, on
which Fielder can draw in future.
(Specialised starches are used in the
making of fine writing papers, etc.)
The chairman said in his 1966 address
in November that an unsecured note
issue to shareholders would be con-
sidered if any present proposals
matured soon. The company is partial
to loan financing, having issued a con-
vertible note issue in the past (con-
verting to shares in 1965). Shareholders
have a much greater equity in the
business than they had two years ago.
At last balance date the company had
$lBB,OOO in loans repayable within 12
months and $439,000 beyond 12 months.
The company says it has a lot on
its plate at present, although the pro-
ject to produce a new breed of sub-
terranean clover, Uniwager, which has a
low oestrogen content, will not neces-
sarily involve a lot of capital. This
seed venture will tackle the national
tragedy of high lambing losses in W.A.,
where other clovers have a high oestro-
gen content. Fielder has bought land
in W.A. on which to produce this clover
for seed, and has had enough initiative
to take advantage of the growing season
in the northern hemisphere, sending
seed to India and then bringing back
the resultant harvest to get two seasons
in one year. Fielder will pay out some
$20,000 for each of the next six years
to the Perth Universty’s Institute of
Agriculture which developed the strain.
Proceeds from the first selling season
could be $250,000 to $300,000, and pro-
fits should be high.
This is in addition to Fielder’s seed
interests through DeKalb Shand Seed
Co. Pty. Ltd., which grows or has con-
tract growers for hybrid seed of field
maize, sweet corn, popcorn, grain sorg-
hum, and forage sorghum at Tamworth,
Armidale and Berrigan in N.S.W.
The chief base of Fielder’s operations
is at Tamworth, where it mills flour,
makes bread, edible and industrial
starch, glucose and dextrose, gluten and
stock feed, and produces pork and lamb
(a two-year-old venture for which they
have great hopes). In Sydney it mills
flour, and has three bakeries, and makes
package foods.
Conditions for Australian millers will
never be as bright as in the ’sos when
there was a large export business to
Asia and Europe. Toward the end of
that decade, Asian countries had set up
their own mills and subsidised flour
competition from other flour exporting
countries had wiped out Australian
markets. Countries with big popula-
tions apparently subsidise flour exports
by a small levy on the price of bread,
a practice Australia would find im-
possible. The price of bread, an im-
portant ingredient in the cost of living
index, is controlled in N.S.W. by the
Prices Commissioner.
Australian millers have thus amalga-
mated for strength, and attempted to
secure their domestic markets in a
flurry of expensive bakery takeovers.
Fielder took over Brunton’s, the Sydney
miller and baker, in 1960 and has taken
over several small bakeries. (It has a
licence to make Hovis flour for supply-
ing to bakers of Hovis bread, and has
the Procera bread process for Austra-
lasia.)
THE MARGIN OF PROFIT in bread-
making is very fine, and since 1958
Fielder has endured several poor trad-
ing years, only now looking as if it is
emerging to more profitable times.
Shareholders, accustomed to regular
dividends of 12| percent up to 1958,
have since had 8, 10, 8 for three
years, and 9 percent for the past two.
Their 9 percent should not be threat-
ened in the foreseeable future. The
recent drought in N.S.W. did not
adversely affect Fielder’s trading, al-
though on a previous occasion (1958-
59) when a drought caused failure of
the N.S.W. wheat crop, the company
had to import wheat at great cost from
other States. In November, 1965, there
was no harvest but the N.S.W. wheat
board had sufficient carryover from the
1964 harvest for millers. The 1966
harvest presented no problem for mil-
lers; there is if anything a glut, as
graziers planted wheat for a quick cash
crop. Seasonal conditions now are ex-
cellent for sowing in late May and
June.
At 69c the 50c shares are almost at a
top price for five years and more.
Although a 6.5 percent dividend yield
may not look very attractive these days
from a stock with no capital benefits
since 1960, and then only a one-for-ten
at 40 percent premium, the prospects
from seeds alone appear to merit this
price. The 30 percent profit rise needed
to maintain the current earnings rate on
higher capital (and if tax at normal
rates were paid) seems well within the
company’s ability.

SHARE YIELDS STATISTICS
After the previous week’s sparkle, the market has had to
impose a fair measure of correction on itself —mostly arising
from “special circumstances.” Even the ebullient Western
Mining and BHP didn’t bounce so vigorously toward the close;
the former put on a mere 5 cents to finsh at $ll.OO, while
Hills actually shed 2 cents, closing at $6.96. On results and
metal prospects Broken Hill South plunged 41 cents to $2 79
and North Broken Hill 42 cents to $3.93; Mount Isa dropped
16 cents. Industrial leaders moved carefully, although Burns
Philp managed a 15 cent advance to $4.10.

IS GEARED TO THE GROWTH OF AUSTRALIA
With more than one fifth of our entire national expenditure devoted to transport, the movement of
people and of goods is a major factor in the Australian economy. Transport in our cities and over the
vast distances we have to conquer, has made us, per capita, one of the world's leading motoring
nations. In all this, Olympic, from its early days in 1922, has always been on the move with Australia.
But tyres and tyre service for the family car, the semi-trailer, the tractor, the übiquitous truck, and for
so many kinds of wheeled vehicles, form only a part of Olympic integration with our daily life.
The Olympic Group of Companies serves Australia in many other useful ways. There is no activity or
industry in which the Olympic reputation, for making efficiently and economically what the nation
needs, fails to guide the buyer's choice.

Plenty of trading problems
—buy the cheapest
WHEN WRITING ABOUT five com-
panies over a period of six weeks, it
seems to be essential to take another
look at the share prices before “sum-
ming up.” In the case of these five com-
panies, the difference over a period of
seven weeks has generally been neg-
ligible. The percentage changes in the
share prices have been as under:
G. J. Coles down 0.9%
David Jones up 6.3%
Myers up 3.6%
Waltons down 1.1%
Woolworths down 1.6%
There were no trading fortunes to be
made among these five. With the
exception of Woolworths, the shares
were all close to their low points for
1967 seven weeks ago, so David Jones
is probably the only one which has
shown any worthwhile recovery. It may
be that this was due to the use of the
word “phenomenal” in the interim
report, but I prefer to believe that the
rather low price/earnings multiple in
relation to the other four stocks was the
main reason. At the current price of
$1.35, this multiple is 12.0 and the
dividend yield becomes 5 percent
exactly.
it will be readily apparent from the
study of several companies’ histories
that growth in dividends per share does
not necessarily occur at the same rate
as growth in earnings. Taking Coles
and Woolworths as examples, it will be
noted that the dividend yields are, to
all intents and purposes, identical. This
could lead us to expect that future
growth in dividends per share will be
at the same rate for both companies.
It is apparent that over the five years
the rates have been quite different,
although they are quite close together
when taken over a longer period of
eight years. Growth in earnings per
share over the past five years has been
quite different and this could account
for Woolworths’ price/earnings multiple
being 10 percent higher than Coles’.
This could be interpreted to mean
that, in the future, Coles’ earnings
per share are expected to grow at a
rate which is only two-thirds of the
rate which is expected from Wool-
worths’ earnings per share.
Because of the unknown purchase/
lease factor, any comparison on the
basis of the average cost per store seems
rather valueless, yet it is interesting to
note that average sales per store were
not very different (Coles $413,000 and
Woolworths $419,000) in the last finan-
cial years of the two companies. Wool-
worths has undoubtedly been expanding
at a much faster rate than Coles in
recent years, judging by the increases
in sales; this alone would account for
the somewhat greater rate of growth in
earnings per share. Just how the expan-
sion of the two groups will proceed in
the next five years is difficult to guess
at, particularly as Woolworths has now
entered into department store retailing.
One is tempted to think that it might
now be Coles’ turn to expand at a
greater rate than Woolworths and, in
this event, Coles’ per share earnings
might well increase at a greater rate
than Woolworths.
So far as the other three companies
are concerned, their retailing field is a
little different, but expansion of sales
is also the key to expansion of profits,
and earnings per share. All three are
engaged in increasing their selling floor
areas, although in rather different ways.
Myers is building large shopping
centres, inspired no doubt by the success
of its first venture into this field. David
Jones is adding new stores (Bankstown
Square), extending existing stores
(Brookvale and Wollongong), and
working on its last major acquisition
(Foys W.A.). Waltons, after taking a
major step into Melbourne with a
large department store in Bourke
Street, has acquired Marcus Clark and
increased the selling floor area of the
group quite substantially by that one
move.
Without some increase in their shares
of the total market, the department
stores would probably find that their
sales would have been showing quite
erratic rates of growth over the past
seven years. Australian sales of clothing,
electrical goods, furniture, floorcover-
ings, china, glass, etc., had a good
increase in the 1959/60 year, but there
was little growth in 1960/61, 1961/62,
and 1965/66. In the past five years, the
total increase in these sales has been
almost exactly 20 percent. Myers’ total
sales in the same period have increased
by over 31 percent. Woolworths’ sales
in roughly the same period have
increased by an astronomical 57 per-
cent; of course Woolworths would have
benefited from the increase in food
sales, which has been at a rather higher
rate.
It has been a feature of all the com-
panies which have been considered in
this series that they have been engaged
in adding to their stores. This desire
for sales growth is probably brought
about by the desire to overcome the
pressures __ from increasing costs. As
already mentioned, wages and salaries
is a major item of expenses in the
department store’s total costs; to judge
by the figures quoted in the Myers
article, which are probably fairly
typical for all stores, there was an
increase in 1965/66 which will con-
tinue into 1966/67 as a result of the
basic wage increase last year.
Myers is the only one of the three
department store retailers in this series
which discloses its sales figures and
comment has already been made on
the ratio of trading profit to sales in
the article on Myers. Recently, “The
Monthly Economic Letter” of the
First National City Bank published a
review of corporate profits in U.S.A.
and showed that the average return on
sales of 66 department and specialty
stores was 3.1 percent for both 1965
and 1966. Similar figures for Myers
would be 4.0 per cent for both years.
The U.S.A. survey also gave the
average figures for the return on net
worth (or ordinary shareholders’ funds)
and this figure is available to us for
all three stores:
1965 1966
U.S.A. average (66 stores) 13 6 13 7
David Jones 8 3 7 8
Myers 15 1 13 6
Waltons 7 8 7.7
From these figures, it is possible to
suggest that the U.S.A. companies
manage to produce a greater volume
of sales in relation to net worth than
Myers and that Myers would seem to
make better use of its net worth (from
the point of view of profitability) than
David Jones or Waltons.
The survey also gives figures for
chainstores under two headings, food
and variety. Comparable figures for
Coles and Woolworths are given:
Return on Return on
Net Worth Sales
1965 1966 1965 1966
U.S.A. average
59 Food 12 5 12 2 1 3 1.3
79 Variety 13 3 14 0 3 3 3.2
Coles 10 9 11 0 3 6 3.3
Woolworths 11.0 9.7 2.4 2.4
These figures again indicate that the
U.S.A. companies obtain a higher pro-
portion of sales to net worth than the
Australian; it could well be that this
reflects a lower cost of fixed assets. It
could also be accounted for by higher
gearing or greater use of lease-backs.
The retailers seem to have two main
problems:
(a) How to achieve sales growth at a
greater rate than the economy as a
whole without incurring excessive costs
in the financing of more selling floor
space.
(b) How to maintain net margins on
sales when costs are rising and it is
almost impossible to obtain higher
gross margins.
In view of these problems, it is diffi-
cult to select the company which will
do best in the immediate future. As
any one of the companies may solve the
problems satisfactorily and as it is likely
that the others will obtain the answer
almost immediately after, the cheapest
shares would seem to be the best bet
at the moment, i.e., David Jones and
Waltons.


The Chartist on the retailers
Too many disappointments
—no hurry to buy
NO HURRY to buy! The retail lead-
ers must be generally disappointing to
investors on their stock-market per-
formance over the past seven years.
They can really be classified now as
cyclical income stocks which have
passed their growth phase in terms of
market appreciation. Their movements
can be directly compared with the Syd-
ney Trades and Services index No. 5
which has not been able to rise above
its 1960 peak. All the stocks reviewed
with the exception of the Myer Em-
porium Ltd. are included in this index.
On technical grounds, retail stocks
appear to be near the “bottom” and
there appears to be no reason to buy
or sell at present, as a general side-
ways movement in the group seems
more likely for the short term. Waltons
would possibly be the most promising
recovery situation, provided it does not
fall below the valid 80c support level.
G. J. COLES & CO. LTD. The
share price movements since 1960
could be hardly regarded as spectacu-
lar. The best performance over the past
seven years was the 40 percent up-
trend which lasted for just over a year
up to the 1964 top. The high point
for that year was only slightly above
the peak of 1960. The stock is at
present in what appears to be a base
pattern and seems unlikely to fall below
the 1966 low point of $1.05. Further
consolidation around the $1.20 level is
more likely over the next few months
and the present base suggests a rise
eventually to approximately $1.65,
where strong resistance selling would be
encountered from the 1960 top forma-
tion. Last sale price on 21/4/67
$1.17.
DAVID JONES LTD. has been in a
major downtrend ever since 1960,
although it did manage to follow a
gentle 20 percent uptrend until the
general topping of retailers and the
break in trend about the $2.20 level
in the early months of 1964. This stock
is a good illustration of the value of
trend lines, particularly in cyclical
issues, as investors could have avoided
considerable erosion of capital. A fur-
ther downside objective of $l.OO exists
for this stock, but it could well now
consolidate above the $1.20 support
level for some time. It is too early
at this point to assess any possible
recovery target. Last sale price on
21/4/67 $1.36.
MYER EMPORIUM LTD. has cer-
tainly given the best performance in
the retail group, with a four-year up-
trend at a rate of 15 percent apprecia-
tion per annum to 1964. Even investors
who bought near the 1963 peak around
$3.90 would not be showing any serious
loss of capital compared with other
cyclical issues, suggesting that there is
still further growth in this stock. Basi-
cally a downtrend still exists, but for the
most part it has resisted the downward
pull of the index and could reasonably
be expected to move upward with the
general recovery. There is no clear
projection at this stage. Last sale price
on 21/4/67 $3.14.
WALTONS LTD. chart shows the
most dramatic price movements, with
some fast intermediate trend rates,
when compared with the remainder of
the group. Only trendline selling
would have retained profits, as the
decline since 1964 has taken prices
from a high point of $l.BB in 1963
after the three-year uptrend down to
a low of 80c in 1965. The usual base
rally took prices as hi<>h as $1.23
about the middle of last year in a
promising 50 percent intermediate up-
trend with a base suggesting a rise to
approximately $1.40. The rapid decline
from this uptrend took prices back to-
ward the 80c base level. More con-
solidation about 88c-90c would be ex-
pected for the short term; provided
prices do not fall below 80c, it would
be possible for WALTONS to recover
to a minimum of $2.20 for the longer
term, with a possible move to $2.50
eventually. Last sale price on 21/4/67
—83 c.
WOOLWORTHS LIMITED market
performance could be likened to the
share price movements of G. J. Coles.
The 10 percent uptrend from the be-
ginning of 1961, which was penetrated
about $1.50 late in 1964, could hardly
be described as a “growth” situation,
particularly as prices have since been
as low as $1.15 in 1966. Woolworths,
like the other retail leaders, could be
expected to consolidate for some months
around current levels of $1.20 before
any move of major importance could be
expected along with the general re-
covery of the market. The current base
suggests an eventual rise to possibly
the $1.90 level. Last sale price on
21 Al/67 $1.21.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Time to unlock
the old
oaken chest
THE OTHER NIGHT I saw a friend
off on the midnight flight to Port
Moresby. The experience set me think-
ing of the exciting growth prospects
(and investment opportunities) that
exist in Papua and New Guinea. These
areas can present some pretty impress-
ive statistics which must put some of
their stocks in the blue-chip class. Sav-
ing bank deposits, trading bank ad-
vances, and the Territory’s Budget have
all doubled since 1960. Motor vehicle
registrations are growing at 15 percent
a year and the non-indigenous popula-
tion is swelling its ranks at an annual
rate of six percent. Not bad for the
jungle!
Shareholders in Territory companies
have shared in this growth. The two old
traditional island traders, Burns Philp
and W. R. Carpenter, have been good
stocks to put away in a chest and forget.
If you had bought into these companies
a decade ago, you would have now
doubled your money and be getting
close to tripling it. This is without
taking dividends into account. With
continuous pressure for even faster
development being applied at the
United Nations level, especially by the
Afro-Asian bloc, now is the time for
getting out the chest again. Market
gains over the next ten years will prob-
ably be even more impressive than pre-
viously. Like bank shares, however, they
are not quite right for the short-term
speculator.
Back on the mainland, Allied Mills
looks ready for a good year. As the
largest producer of margarine in Aus-
tralia it must have benefited consider-
ably, at no expense to itself, from the
massive flag-waving campaign of its
competitor Marrickville Margarine.
Also, as a result of Marrickville’s pro-
duction being cut back, Allied is now
enjoying an even larger proportion of
the market than before. All a bit tough
on Mrs. Jones.
Allied Mills, despite its margarine
and other diversifications, should be
really assessed on its flourmilling and
breadmaking activities. These are the
mainstay of the company. Happily, if
the results of other companies in the
same industry can be taken as a guide,
all looks well in this section, too.
Encouraged on all flanks, I bought 200
at $1.69.
My other buy of the week was
General Credits. This company has the
Commercial Bank of Australia as its
godfather and looks a bargain at 62
cents. It did well, along with the
majority of other hire-purchase com-
panies, in the first six months of the
year; I can’t see why it won’t do just as
well in the second. Hoping that its final
report, which is due in June, will draw
some attention to its Twiggy-like price,
I bought 400.
Incidentally, with all the cheap bor-
rowing money around at the moment,
all financiers should be right for a good
year. Just to make things even better,
there is the pick-up in car sales plus
the beginnings of a revival in the build-
ing industry. Companies like Australian
Guarantee and Associated Securities
should have profit figures about 20 per-
cent fatter than last year.
My sale of the week was Coles.
Despite its own good interim result, its
running-mate Woolworths’ good final
result, and a host of encouraging
interims from other contempories, Coles’
shares won’t budge in price. Even David
Jones’ report of a phenomenal Easter
leaves them unmoved. Deciding that I
had held on long enough for a hoped-
for rise to $1.20, I sold out. Still
managed to show a profit, so guess I
shouldn’t be greedy. Leave some for
the next man is what they say.

.. AND HOW THIS KNOW-HOW COULD APPLY TO YOU.
Tough Problem for Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd., of Mile End, South Australia. They needed a
cutting machine—and they needed it in a location where there wasn’t a power supply. They could
have installed power points; but only at considerable expense.
UfUAT TO nno "*"hey wise 'y called in LIQUID AIR, and our consultant literally had a gas idea. He
Wnnl IU UU ■ suggested LIQUID AlR’s Turbo-cutter, the only gas-turbine cutter available in
Australia. Weighing in at just 26 lbs., this precision machine cuts anywhere you can take oxygen and
fuel gas, and is driven by the cutting oxygen— without loss of gas. Amazing? There’s more.
Amongst other things, the versatile Turbo-cutter, on its special track, cuts straight lines on plate J" to
7", square or bevelled. Parallel cuts from 7§" to 16f" wide. It makes edge preparation easy, and a
turntable device allows production cutting of circles from 1 to 11 f" radius. You can even hand guide
it over any surface, including rough, scaled or buckled.
Solving problems for clients like Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd. is one reason why LIQUID AIR
has achieved such a remarkable reputation for service. There are others. A complete range of gases
and accessories. Prompt, on-time deliveries. And assistance, anytime, day or night. (Call us, if

THE LAND
Assessing the Wool Brokers’ plan
By the RURAL EDITOR
IT IS ONLY a fortnight since the
Council of Wool Selling Brokers
announced their plan for streamlining
the auction system of selling wool and
ihc reaction, generally, seems favorable.
There has been no harsh attack on the
proposal from any grower organisa-
tion or any grower occupying an
executive position in any organisation.
There has been some expression of
doubt, certainly, but outright opposition
from areas where it might have been
expected is not in evidence.
There is a rather droll side to this
situation. The strongest attacks on the
brokers have been made not by wool-
omuers, but by various observers and
writers who grow no wool. One can
only assume that, in this instance, these
people have confused the wool market-
ing issue with some personal issue
which has nothing whatever to do with
wool or its marketing. It is more per-
tinent to look at the published views of
leaders of various organisations which
supported the reserve plan of 1965.
Mr. L. M. Ridd, general president of
the United Farmers and Woolgrowers’
Association of N.S.W., said that the
brokers’ proposal was worthy of con-
sideration by the appropriate author-
ities, the Wool Board’s marketing com-
mittee, and the Wool Board itself. “It
is gratifying the National Council has
seen fit to publicly announce the pro-
posed changes in an attempt to rec-
tify the problems,” Mr. Ridd said.
“The proposals are a recognition of
the inhibitions inherent in the
present wool marketing system.” Mr.
Ridd added that growers’ organisations
in Victoria and Western Australia had
stated that if there was no satisfac-
tory marketing system by June, 1968,
then the promotion levy should revert
to $1 per bale maximum.
This (in our view) suggests that the
matter of the levy will be crucial in
the finalising of the Australian Wool
and Meat Producers’ Federation atti-
tude to the brokers’ proposal, even
though the two are, in theory, quite
separate. The United Farmers is the
N.S.W. component of the Australian
Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation.
In Western Australia it is the Farmers’
Union. The president of this body’s
wool section, Mr. R. V. Sewell, was
reported as saying that the brokers’
proposal was a properly prepared (
presentation and deserved study. The
first move, he said, should come from
the Australian Wool Board’s marketing
committee.
The statements by Messrs. Ridd and
Sewell are highly significant, as we see
it, because both were strongly in sup-
port of reserve price and active in the
reserve price campaign, yet neither in-
dulged in some of the outlandish antics
which attended that campaign. They
are, probably, the two most powerful
men in the AWMPF, and Sewell, at
one time, was actually a strong tip for
chairmanship of the Wool Board (when
it appeared as if Sir William Gunn
might enter politics). They have not
come out in support of the brokers’
proposal (and never let it be suggested
that we infer that), but neither have
they come out strongly in opposition.
Their opinion qualifies as informed,
responsible grower opinion and is quite
different to the opinion of those growers
who make flamboyant speeches at meet-
ings, or write letters to the editors, but
who carry no responsibility.
Therefore there does seem to be, at
this early stage, at least a measure of
W. J. Vines
Sir W. Gunn
grower agreement on this brokers’
proposal. The N.S.W. Graziers’, as ex-
pected, welcomed it and agreed that it
should go to the Wool Board’s market-
ing committee for consideration. The
Graziers’ was, of course, strongly anti-
reserve price. Messrs. Ridd and Sewell,
strongly pro-reserve price, apparently
have no objection to its going to the
same body for consideration. What will
the marketing committee, due to report
in October, do with it?
The most interesting observation of
all, to date, has come from the veteran
reserve price enthusiast Mr. F. Eric
Hitchins, of Western Australia. Hit-
chins, in somewhat despondent mood,
suggests that this brokers’ plan may
well be a “preview of the long-awaited
and oft-delayed Wool Board marketing
report.” “Prophecy is always dan-
gerous,” he says, “but judging from
preparatory statements on the matters
still unresolved, when the AWB repqrt
finally emerges it promises to be
similar in scope and character.”
Facing reality, we find one major
reason why the brokers’ plan is likely
to come to fruition. The brokers’ plan
makes great play on the opinion of
the overseas buying trade. It will be
remembered that, during the reserve
price campaign, the Wool Board tried
to convince growers that the trade,
through the International Wool Textile
Organisation, was not opposed to a
reserve price plan. Many growers (and
this observer, as a matter of fact)
accepted this and therefore saw some
merit and logic in the reserve price
proposal. But then it was shown, con-
clusively, that the Wool Board’s in-
terpretation of the IWTO attitude was,
to put it mildly, elastic. Many growers,
with good reason, thereupon changed
their minds about reserve price. Much
the same situation exists today.
The Wool Board chairman, Sir
William Gunn, and the IWS director,
Mr. William Vines, still preach the
gospel of controlled marketing. Char-
acteristically, both ignore, and fail to
pass on to growers, matters which
growers ought to know about. The
following is of the utmost importance
in assessing these latest moves in market-
ing and has had scant publicity. It is
a copy of a resolution of the Inter-
national Wool Textile Organisation in
January this year:
“The IWTO recommends to the Aus-
tralian woolgrowers not to let them-
selves be unduly influenced by the
present temporarily unfavorable condi-
tions, unfavorable for practically all
world commodities, and not to make
too rapid decisions on the alteration of
their present marketing system and re-
minds them of the repeated promise of
the competent Australian authorities to
consult the IWTO before any changes
in the present marketing system are put
into effect and of their assurance that
any eventual alteration would be made
within the framework of private enter-
prise.”
To ignore this IWTO resolution in
assessing the brokers’ plan is the same
as ignoring the plain fact that the buyer
set against New Zealand crossbred wool
this season was precipitated by a lift in
the reserve price. That has been done
by people who should know better (and
must have known). The growers
thought they deserved more money; un-
fortunately the buyers did not. It is a
common enough experience in all fields
of endeavor.
Of course, Sir William Gunn and
Mr. Vines (who are not, by the way,
on the Wool Board marketing com-
mittee) have an answer to this a
vast, all-powerful organisation con-
trolling marketing, owning textile fac-


Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-

over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-

Quarantine against
the Charolais
OUR COMPETITOR “Time,” the
weekly news magazine, devoted half
of one of its valuable pages the other
week to tell us about Sam 951, a
Charolais stud bull. His claim to fame,
according to “Time,” is that he fills
8000 vials of semen for A.I. a year. In
itself this feat is hardly newsworthy.
Any self-respecting bull could do it.
Buried toward the end of the article
is more significant information. Sam’s
owners, it seems, have no trouble sell-
ing his services at SUSIO a time and
grossing $BO,OOO a year. They are
about to begin selling Sam’s precious
seed overseas, although no one in this
country will be able to get any of it.
Clearly, the breed is now very popular
in the U.S. and elsewhere. By failing
to tell us why, “Time” has overlooked
the real news.
The fact is that the breed has been
hitting up extraordinary production
records. For example, a line of 27 male
and female offspring from one bull on
a commercial farm in Ohio averaged
a remarkable 7541 b. at 205 days of
age. One Charolais bull calf reared on
a four-year-old cow actually tipped the
scales at 10051 b. when just 30 weeks
old. A yearling of any of the breeds in
Australia that reached 10001 b. would
give us something to talk about.
And it is not a particularly ravenous
brute either. British figures show that
Charolais-Friesian cross steers consume
12 percent less feed in putting on a
pound of liveweight than Hereford-
Friesian cross steers. Superiority in
feed conversion of up to 21 percent
over other breeds has been reported
for the Charolais. Moreover, this fine
French beef animal a dash of Eng-
lish Shorthorn blood was injected into
its parentage about a century ago
generally cuts up into a better quality
carcass on the butcher’s block than
other breeds. Its dressing-out percent-
age is a point or more higher also. The
only count that can be chalked up
against the Charolais is that calf deaths
and calving problems are more com-
mon in the breed, and particularly in
its crosses, than in other cattle.
Unfortunately, because of our
quarantine regulations we cannot even
import semen. Something ought to be
done about this predicament. Indeed,
the first steps should have been taken
at least a decade ago, when the English-
speaking world became fully aware ol
the Charolais. The British Ministry of
Agriculture in 1959 and the U.S,
Department of Agriculture about the
same time successfully imported whole
herds of Charolais cattle from France,
The New Zealanders also have been
bold enough to rely on modern
veterinary knowledge and have now
brought in several batches of semen
from Britain without mishap.
Dr. Refshauge, the Director-General
of Health, has recently given a com-
mercial firm permission to bring back
from India, of all places, a large
parcel (possibly over 20 tons) of seed
of the new clover, Uniwager, which
was bred at the University of Western
Australia. If the chances of bringing
in new pests, weeds, and diseases can
be suppressed in this venture and fears
assuaged, then the risks with livestock
can be confidently discounted also. A
group of South African scientists stated
a year or so ago that some, at least,
of the diseases we dread are not trans-
missable through semen. This is a mat-
ter for further research, and so long as
we cannot study the subject here we
should foster its study overseas.
When importing their Charolais, the
Americans used an off-shore island as
A Charolais-Friesian cross
a quarantine staging station. Surely we
could make similar arrangements. Once
a suitable island was found and furn-
ished we would no doubt find the
facilities of continuing convenience.
They could even be elaborated to pro-
vide an exotic diseases research labora-
tory. It would give our veterinarians
an opportunity to become acquainted
with rinderpest, foot and mouth, and
the rest. As a result we would be much

BOOKS
Two million bottles of vermouth
By JOHN BAXTER
The Secret of Santa Vittoria. Robert
Crichton. Hodder and Stoughton.
$3.85.
THE VEIN of Italian humor, mined
long and assiduously by writers on both
sides of the Atlantic, has never pro-
duced much except low-grade ore.
Italian quirkiness, it has always
seemed, has an attraction appreciated
only on the spot. Robert Crichton’s
novel, currently enjoying enormous
international popularity, high on the
best-seller lists everywhere, seems likely
to alter this impression. His Italians
are odd, irritating, occasionally funny,
and always worth reading about.
Some of this stems in all probability
from the book’s intriguing premise.
Toward the end of World War 11, a
small Italian village, in anticipation of
the arrival of peace, overthrows its
Fascist government. The inhabitants
are, however, appalled when they are
told that the Germans propose to
occupy all of Italy and hold out
against the advancing Allied forces.
Such occupation would mean the
seizure of the village’s greatest wealth,
more than two million bottles of
vermouth and sparkling wines stored
in a mountain vault against the com-
ing of post-war prosperity.
Motivated by equal quantities of
patriotism and greed, the villagers
move most of the wine from its original
hiding-place and secrete it in an
ancient Roman vault, where it is walled
up for the rest of the war. A small
contingent of Germans arrives, intent
on discovering the hoard, but despite
torture and other pressures the people
reveal nothing. When the Germans
leave, the wine is still hidden. All
this would sound rather preposterous
were it not for the fact that it is true.
The town of Santa Vittoria d’Alba did
hide a million and a half bottles of
wine from the Germans in 1944, and
the secret of their whereabouts was
kept from an occupying garrison for
more than a year.
Crichton, on whose personal experi-
ence the book is allegedly based, invests
the town of Santa Vittoria with the
character of all Italy. Often he seems
less concerned with the story than with
expressing his feelings about the coun-
try and its people, with special refer-
ence to their fatalism and fierce in-
dependence. Some of his characters are
endowed so monumentally with these
Robert Crichton
traits as to become almost terrifyingly
real. Padre Polenta, sitting in his tower
above the winter fogs and noting in
his diary with a sort of gleeful resigna-
tion that the population, deathrate, and
even the family names of Santa Vit-
toria do not vary over the last three
centuries: Fabio della Romanga, paus-
ing on his way to warn the village,
first to steal a bicycle, then, for no
particular reason, to make love to the
girlfriend of the man who owns it:
these characters have a bite and energy
we are not used to seeing in comic
novels.
The best of them, however, is Bom-
bolini, the wine merchant who, blessed
with a desperate patriotism, becomes the
mayor of Santa Vittoria and leader of
its plot to fool the Germans. Busily
quoting his hero, Machiavelli, he ex-
pands on a number of fronts, from
changing signs (“Live dangerously
D’Annunzio” receives the addition
“But Drive Carefully Bombolini”)
to organising the human chain which
brings the wine down from the moun-
tain to the ancient Roman vault. He
represents to Crichton and eventually
to the reader Italy’s ruthless and in-
spired political history, the spirit of
families like the Medici and Borgia
which has given to social organisation
an element of theatre.
It is with the character of Bombolini
that “The Secret of Santa Vittoria”
loses touch with the thread of humor
which motivates the story. There is
no comedy in Bombolini, for all his
bureaucratic fervor. Crichton has him
sit through the entire process of an in-
terrogation where five men are tor-
tured, some to death, and make no
effort to avert their suffering, so dedi-
cated is he to the principle of prevent-
ing the Germans from getting the
hidden wine. His inspired psychologi-
cal destruction of von Prumm, the
German commander, is worthy of the
Borgias in its combination of cool
calculation and unbridled emotion.
That we are asked by the writer to
admire Bombolini and, more sur-
prising, that we are able to is an
index to how successful he has been
in building up his character. Bom-
bolini, in the end, is the only man in
Santa Vittoria that one can understand
to any great extent. Most of the time,
we are in the same position as Roberto,
a deserting American pilot who lives
in the village, is the narrator of the
story, and must, one supposes, be con-
sidered by us to be Crichton, though
there is no mention anywhere that he
found out about Santa Vittoria in such
a way.
One of the most illuminating pas-
sages in the book is a conversation in
which Bombolini tells Roberto the story
of some poor landowners who became
great princes by inviting a king to
dinner, then ostentatiously flinging their
silverware (borrowed) out of the
window into the sea, whereupon the
king, impressed, extended his patron-
age to them. He is baffled until Bom-
bolini explains that the men had strung
fishing nets under the window before-
hand. “Although he spoke the lan-
guage,” Crichton comments, “he would
never understand the mind of these
people. Any peasant would know there
was a fish net down below, and the
point of the story was not how to fool
a king as much as what a clever way
to use a fish net.”
We are all eventually in the position
of Roberto, struggling in a morass of
conflicting loyalties and motivations to
understand why these people act as
they do. Aside from a gratuitous tor-
ture sequence and some moderately
uninhibited sexual byplay Crichton has
made few concessions to the traditions
of the best-seller, and one imagines
with amusement the average American
reader, lulled by the platitudes of “The
complex behaviour patterns. “The
Secret of Santa Vittoria” is neither an
emptily amusing nor an easy book to
read, but its blend of philosophical de-
tachment and tough engagement with
the intricacies of the Italian character
may yet gain it a popularity more last-
ing than that which most novels can
expect.

Scotland's voice
By J. M. COUPER
The Oxford Book of Scottish Verse
Edited by John Mac Queen and
Tom Scott. Oxford University Press.
$7.00.
THE BBC, the motor-car, and the
Council school have in this century so
evangelised Scotland that very ordinary
ladies and gentlemen lead their genteel
lives in received English, only slightly
ruined by a Paisley accent or the sulky
vowels of Fife. In some ways it is a
pity. Once no one needed to be frigh-
tened that a Scotsman would speak
better than he did. It was in the nature
of the man to be awkwardly distinct,
knobbly in his speech as Harry Lauder
in his kilt.
It is a pity because, if a language is
to stay really alive, it may need the
nonconformity of dialect to give it, as
it were, blood transfusions of force and
character. It is a pity because this ex-
cellent addition to the Oxford books
of verse is written largely in an un-
fashionable lingo and poems of great
pith and vitality are seemingly con-
demned to the decent obscurity of what
is, after all, a learned language.
The balance of the book is one of its
merits. The splendid pre-Reformation
poets are amply represented, the bal-
lads and other anonymous songs of a
supreme excellence are admirably ap-
portioned their places in a developing
tradition, the longer narrative poem
has scope, and what may be called the
Hab Simson manner of critical social
commitment of verse thoroughly in-
volved in the sweat of its times—gets
every chance to deploy from the seven-
teenth century through Fergusson and
Burns down to the more nostalgic
Stevenson. It is only with the poets of
this century that the choice blurs into
a multiplicity of poems of less steady
merit.
But the editors sensibly expected that
their choice here would be more re-
sisted and in any case the whole book,
modern and earlier, whets the appetite
and suggests with ease that there is
more where this came from. Nowhere
are they scraping for quality, hardly
ever risking the cheap and notorious
Bonnie-Scotland sentimentality, no-
where eking out with concoctions that
merely imitate the English way.
Thomas Campbell, who made a fortune
with dim imitations of the Romantic
manner, is sternly repudiated al-
together.
It will be emphatically seen from
the choice made here that Scottish
poetry, close to dialect, never lost its
hold on a genial reality, warmed al-
ways by the love of people. Even
people the poet hated are nonethe-
less lovingly treated for that, and the
world of nature happens alongside the
doings of men. It is not James Thou,
son of “The Seasons” who takes out
attention but Drummond in the maca.

weem, where the haddock swims in the
waves and the flook and the skate wan.
der up and down the coast like the
sheep and goats of Theocritus and Vir-
gil. The idyllic picture is drily reduced
to the hodden-grey of possibility.
Throughout, the sturdiness and pro.
fane vigor of the verse will surprise
and delight all readers. Here are poems
that have been around for a long time,
but the literati of Scotland have since
Hume’s day been so eager to appear
cultured that they have kept them hid-
den from their very selves, in case like
Lear’s hand they should smell of mor-
tality. It is, and has long been, mud
more of a solecism to show an addic-
tion to things Scottish if you live in
the country than if you live beyond its
bounds.
Anyone picking up this book at the
last pages will of course look for Hugh
Mac Diarmid and immediately notice
his bangs at religion: God an’ a’ his
gang, and so on. There is a deliberate
irreverence, a refusal to put religion
above the judgment and competence of
men, a thing that certainly the Kirk
itself refuses to do. But it raises two
reflections.
One is that these poems of Mac Dia-
rmid’s are full of gusto and highly suc-
cessful, and this is not because they are

Nelson's eye
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Notes from a Sea Diary: Hemingway
All the Way. Nelson Algren. Deutsch.
$3.85.
NELSON ALGREN, best known as the
author of “The Man with the Golden
Arm” and Simone de Beauvoir’s second-
best boyfriend, has come up with an
extraordinary mixture this . time: he
combines a travel-book on the East with
some unorthodox essays on Ernest
Hemingway. Apparently out to prove
that pub-crawling, brothel-stalking, and
small-game hunting are the same every-
where, Algren adventures faithfully in
Hemingway’s spiritual country while
geographically exploring new territory.
Going to sea is his version of mountain
peak or hermit’s cave: he meditates on
modern prophets and contemporary
iniquities in his retreat of sailor card-
sharpers and drunken brawls. The only
passenger on a disreputable old tramp,
he finds time to commune with
Hemingway and to attack a large slice
of the rest of the world.
He takes side-swipes at armchair
critics (especially those with beards that
eat in cafeterias); American professors
(“publish or perish . . . for the widest
desk in the Department of Humani-
fies”); James Baldwin, for still claim-
ing “the immunity of being a slave”
by putting the responsibility on what he
calls Ol’ White Massa for the murder
of Malcolm X; and Mahatma Ghandi
lor his Let-Them-Eat-Cake answer to a
deputation of 400 whores from Bombay
~~ to name just a few of his targets.
That Algren succeeds (almost) in
bringing off this confusion of verbal
hotpot is due entirely to a first-rate
journalistic writing ability. He crusades
by presenting hair-raising facts with
tmraised voice, with a raw sincerity that
can dispense with soap-boxes. His dead-
pan notes on poverty in India and the
curt case-histories of the women who
are doomed to inhabit the notorious
street-cages without any hope of buying
themselves free, work like a shock-treat-
ment stark enough to shatter any
Western complacency. Sometimes he
reads like Henry Miller with a college
education, at others like Hemingway
himself.
One can sympathise with his ire at
all those smugly erudite critics who find
it convenient to join Papa Hemingway’s
safari now that Papa himself is unable
to bite back. Algren has some legitimate
new points of his own to make here,
for instance, that the realisation that
the author must have had his finger on
the trigger for years before he finally
pressed it, is necessary for a fuller
understanding of “Farewell to Arms.”
At the same time he rails against those
who merge autopsies with reviews. Too
many Hemingway critics do not read
Hemingway, he finds, but read, instead,
other critics on Hemingway (including,
presumably, Nelson Algren).
Critic Algren concludes that Heming-
way’s greatest contribution to literature
was not stylistic but revelatory. It was
in bringing to the isolated American a
true knowledge of what was real and
what was sham. His big mistake was in
his public-relations image: nothing
tangible to grab hold of but a beard
and a smile. The main distrust stemmed
from his never going after the money;
the good life, the adventures, anything
his earnings could buy attracted
Hemingway, but the amassing of money
for money’s sake just did not appeal
to him. This, according to Algren, gave
him an immunity from attack that his
enemies could never forgive him.
Vaudeville man
By HUGH GODFREY
The Films of W. C. Fields. Donald
Deschner. Citadel Press. $9.95.
“THE TALKIES brought one great
comedian,” James Agee said, “the late,
majestically lethargic W. C. Fields . . .
he was the toughest and the most
warmly human of all . . Agee, whose
critical judgments, though impeccably
phrased, did not always fulfil the
promise of their style, has probably
overstated the case, but his choice of
adjectives is difficult to contest.
Fields dominated his section of the
American cinema with the outraged
dignity of a stranded whale, laying
waste to everything around him until
age and a notable drink problem
two quarts of gin a day is one charit-
able estimate killed him off. Don-
ald Deschner, in the latest of the
Citadel Press’ series of star profiles,
has made a brave attempt to sum up
his erratic career, and if it does not
seem quite up to the standard set by
earlier studies of Garbo, Harlow, and
Bogart, it is probably because Fields,
unlike these well-groomed ladies and
gentlemen, does not lend himself to
categorisation, even on so simple a
level as that of the reverent tribute.
There is no evidence that Fields
owed anything to any tradition save
the rather gamy one of burlesque.
Beginning as a juggler, he worked his
way up to be one of the top vaude-
villians on the American stage, then
to a spectacularly successful screen
comedian in the ’twenties and ’thirties.
Throughout his cinema career he never
made at any time a major concession
to the rules of this new art. His films
were almost always plotted by him,
usually to the extent of half a dozen
lines on the back of an envelope (one
such outline netted him $25,000). He
ad libbed uncontrollably, to the despair
of his directors, and almost always
managed to introduce into his movies
at least a few minutes of his old vaude-
ville act, generally the famous sketch
in which, armed with an unbelievably
warped cue and a style of agonising
clumsiness, he engages in one of the
weirdest pool games ever seen by man.
In real life, Fields was more pathetic
than comic. A habitual though seldom
sullen alcoholic, he was plagued by
psychological problems stemming from
an unhappy childhood during which he
had stolen and lived in caves to sur-
vive. All his life he harbored an un-
reasoning suspicion of even his closest
friends, while an ingrained distrust of
managers and agents caused him to
open hundreds of bank accounts all
over the world, some under assumed
names, to ensure that he would never
be stranded anywhere without money.
Though this book does not explore
Fields’ complex character to the extent
that Robert Lewis Taylor does in his
definitive biography, enough is said
to provide the necessary background,
and perhaps to encourage readers to
obtain Taylor’s more penetrating work.
This lack of a genuinely analytical
approach to Fields’ life is the book’s
one major fault. On the credit side,
Deschner is to be complimented for
including, along with the usual com-
plete filmography, such rare associa-
tional items as two short articles by
Fields on comedy and some interesting
holograph outlines and letters.


WRITING IN
THE SIXTIES
The Canadian Experience
By JOHN COLOMBO
THE CHANGES that have swept over
Canada in the 30 years before “Expo
67” have been considerable. They have
altered for ever the country that
Voltaire dismissed as “a few acres of
snow,” and which Jacques Cartier,
one of its first explorers, described as
“the land that God gave Cain.” No-
where are these changes in the
Canadian character better expressed
than in recent writing by the country’s
social thinkers and serious writers.
In the 19305, Canadian writing
meant Mazo de la Roche and Robert
Service. Today nobody takes “Jalna”
seriously as a Canadian novel; nor is
the Yukon looked upon as a Canadian
frontier. The 1960 s are concerned with
life in the big cities and death in
the mammoth suburbs of the big
Canadian cities.
Perhaps the only reputation of the
’thirties to hold its own and thrive
during the last three decades is Stephen
Leacock. For the first time, inexpensive
paperback editions of Leacocks’ “Sun
shine Sketches of a Little Town” and
his other books are available and being
read. The English-born humorist, who
lived near Orillia (which he wrote
about and called Mariposa), would
probably be astonished to discover that
a medal is annually awarded for the
best book of Canadian humor in his
name.
World interest in Canadian litera-
ture has obviously shifted from its non-
fiction writers to its social and literary
critics. Today, perhaps, the best-
known Canadian writer abroad is
Marshall McLuhan, the American-born
Professor of English at St. Michael’s
College in the University of Toronto.
Professor McLuhan’s communications
theories were first set forth in his
immensely influential book “The
Gutenberg Galaxy,” which first made
popular thp distinction between linear
(or syllogistic) and mosaic (or meta-
phoric) thinking.
To Professor McLuhan, Western cul-
ture since the Renaissance has been
print-dominated. This “Gutenberg era”
is swiftly being replaced by the con-
cept of “sense simultaneity,” which is
the result of a new era of electronic
circuitry. Soon there will be no isolated
nationalities; we will all live in a
“global village.”
Professor McLuhan’s most recent
book, “Understanding Media,” popu-
larised the phrase )Yhe medium is the
message,” which was popular ten years
ago in Toronto, but is only today
being taken up with a vengeance in
New York and London. The new book
extends the communications theory to
science and culture itself, turning even
academic learning into sparks of elec-
tronic knowledge.
It has to be said that Marshall
McLuhan is not a characteristically
Canadian figure he is too imagina-
tive and impulsive for that. Yet, in an
interview a year ago, he explained that
he was able to evolve his theories on
modern mass .media only because he
lived in Canada. Had he lived in New
York, he said, he would have been too
close to the American experiment to
view it at a distance; had he lived in
London, the signal would have been
too feeble to have been felt. Toronto
gave him access coupled with distance,
a perfect vantage point.
Marshall McLuhan was not the first
person to note the overwhelming
influence of the United States on
Canada today. While all generalisa-
tions are false, there is a grain of
truth in the popular saying here that
Canada spent its first hundred years
looking east towards the United
Kingdom, and that the country will
probably spend its second hundred
years looking south to the United
States,
The immense attractiveness of the
U.S. to the country one-tenth its size
is partly a financial fascination, since
economics has always been an over-
riding factor in the relationships of
any neighboring States. Across Canada,
a battle is being waged in newspapers
and national magazines about the old
issue of Canadian sovereignty.
The need for a new concept of
nationalism is clear in contemporary
poetry and fiction. The “dean of
Canadian poets,” Earle Birney, who
earlier this year published his
“Selected Poems,” a distillation of
some 30 years’ work, is openly con-
tinental and writes poems about the
scenery of Oregon as he does about
the landscape of his native British
Columbia. Birney’s sympathies are to
the South, and his influence on young,
especially West Coast writers, has
been immense.
Another poet, Raymond Souster,
who is in his forties, recently won the
Governor-General’s Award for his col-
lection “The Color of the Times,”
which was written in the tradition of
William Carlos Williams. Although he
writes about Toronto, Ontario rather
than Patterson, New Jersey, Souster’s
intimate and idiomatic poetry is very
American and very much admired.
As an editor, Souster brought to-
gether the work of 17 young Canadian
poets, whose average age is close to
30. His anthology, “New Wave
Canada,” shows that such talented
poets as Victor Coleman are all part
of a national school of Canadian
poetry, which, from the Maritimes
to the West Coast, writes in the
American idiom. The only exception
is the excellent work of George Joens,
a Hungarian-born refugee who now
writes in English and whose poetry is
of the more traditional kind.
Canadian fiction has, if anything, a
more international than American
flavor. Like so many rockets explod-
ing unexpectedly but simultaneously,
the work of Margaret Laurence took
Canadians by surprise. In her early
forties, writing in Africa and London,
Mrs. Laurence has made her mark as
an important writer within a decade.
Her stories, travel books, and novels
are now published simultaneously in
London, New York, and Toronto. She
is the first writer since Frederick
Philip Grove to write powerfully about
life on the bleak Canadian prairies,
and in her novel, “The Stone Angel,”
she established a high-water mark in
Canadian fiction. Her latest novel, “A
Jest of God,” published this year, is
also set in the prairies.
So far nothing has been said to
give the impression that Canada is
also a French country. Indeed, one-
third of the twenty million Canadians
are of French extraction, and prob-
ably the liveliest writing being done
in Canada is in the French language.
Montreal, the world’s second largest
French-speaking city, is the home of
this cultural explosion (which some
call a revolution). Certainly the
standard of French-Canadian writing
has never been higher, nor has its
significance ever been more social than
it is today.
Much of the activity revolves around
a literary magazine named “Parti
Pris” (literally “Positions Taken”),
which is avowedly separatist in intent.
Such poets as Paul Chamberland and
Andre Major and novelists like Claude
Jasmin and Hubert Aquin, combine a
sophisticated style with a political
propagandising that unabashedly pro-
motes the separation of Canada into
two countries Laurentia (the Prov-
ince of Quebec) and the nine other
provinces.
French-Canadians have identified
themselves with one of the basic con-
cerns of the ’sixties, race relations.
Writers, poets, politicians, and
journalists have equated their status
within Confederation with that of the
Negroes of the American Republic.
“We have our own civil-rights move-
ment cut out for us,” as one writer
put it.
The French in Canada are basically
a cosmopolitan people; the English-
Canadians are becoming increasingly
continental. So two kinds of interna-
tionalism are at work shaping Canadian
literature and society, giving it a new
spirit.

Correction
In the latest issue of the political
quarterly “Dissent,” Mr. Gregory
Clark compares part of an article by
Brian Buckley (“Dissenters a
Rejoinder to the New Reactionaries,”
8., Sept. 17, 1966) with a similar pas-
sage from “The Economist,” June
4-10, 1966. Mr. Clark’s inference is
false. Mr. Buckley’s original article
named “The Economist” as his source,
but this reference was inadvertently
omitted by THE BULLETIN. Before
the passage quoted by Mr. Clark, Mr.
Buckley wrote, “It is clear that the
causes of this disease of will and poli-
tical imagination are not the same in
every case, but the disastrous failure of
so many ‘radicals’ in the field of
foreign policy may be partly due to a
condition well-described in ‘The Econ-
omist,’ June 4-10.” Then followed Mr.
Buckley’s summary of “The Econ-
omist’s” views.
Editor, THE BULLETIN.
Minor Poets
Mr. Wallace (8., April 8) tells us
that the only Australian poetry remem-
bered by the people came from our
“minor” poets such as Kendall, Gordon,
Paterson, and Lawson. This statement
is only true because these poets are
more widely read than our contem-
porary ones. The average Australian
avoids reading work that is in any way
complicated or which requires thought,
so naturally he takes up Paterson or
Lawson.
This is the reason the simple, often
banal poetry of these men is more
highly regarded by the “ordinary
chap” than the more complex and cer-
tainly more artistic and thought-pro-
voking verse of writers such as Hope,
Hart-Smith, and Buckley. (This is per-
haps not an exclusively Australian out-
look; compare the number of English-
men who read Betjeman to those who
read Eliot.) By the way, who would
regard Paterson and Lawson as
“minor” poets. H*

Dairy Industry
I notice that your journal continues
to produce articles with heavy bias
against the dairy industry (Business
and Finance, 8., April 15), but refuses
to publish letters defending that
industry. No pressman, however great
his bias may be, can deny that mar-
garine quotas amply cope with the
needs of margarine with ingredients of
Australian origin. Quotas merely pro-
tect the industry from cheap imported
oils, as tariffs protect secondary
industry.
If enterprise is to be truly free, then
exporting industries which have to sell
on the low free-world market should
be allowed to buy on that market, too.
Exporting industries operate on the
official exchange, but must support
other industries which operate on the
more lucrative but highly artificial one.
Is that free enterprise?

the Affair” (8., April 8). We, the
Aboriginal people and natives (white
skins and born in the dumps), have
never had an “affair” with Britain.
Captain Cook merely landed in the
country, stuck his little flag in the
ground, and the British plus every
other foreign element has been squat-
ting in the place ever since. I don’t
believe there was any business trans-
action between the Aboriginal people
and Cook, so actually all the land
which has been coolly thieved from
them does not belong to its so-called
owners at all.
The Aborigines and natives hold their
country in a very silent way, most of
them have stamina, guts, intelligence,
and breeding, which you overseas people
have not as a rule. Too much talk, no
rules, policies, or standards.

Greek Dig
Knowing the enormous debt that the
Western world owes Greek culture, it
came as some surprise to read a para-
graph in THE BULLETIN criticising
the forthcoming archaeological expedi-
tion to Greece. Although much digging
has already been done in Greece, there
is yet much to learn, and it seems not
unreasonable that we, as Australians,
contribute a little to the world’s store
of knowledge by sending one of the few
teams concerned with culture that
Australia has ever had overseas.
Quite apart from this possible world
debt, Sydney University has always had
a notable department of archaeology,
possessing one of the world’s finest
university collections, and this has
attracted large numbers of students
(over 150 at present), and, although
only three students will join the ex-
pedition this year, more will have the
opportunity of experiencing a signifi-
cant dig over the next six years, which,
added to the valuable experience that
the department’s staff will gain, can
only benefit all the students as well as
the University and Australia generally.

Trains in Spain
Marjorie Suno (B., April 22) deplores
my failure to organise my journey to
Madrid through “one of the many
reputable travel agencies where
English is spoken.” But I did. I
booked my tickets from Paris to
Madrid at the British Railways Travel
Office in London; where English, of a
sort, is undeniably spoken.
It is no “assumption” but cold
reality to say that facilities were
appalling at Irun — or, at least, that
they were in December, 1965. They
may have provided some since. My
clearest recollection (confirmed by my
diary) is that the taps turned on —
but there was no water, and we had to
stagger around the edges of an excava-
ted floor in the main waiting-room, j
I had omitted to mention that the
railway track from Irun to Madrid
is 5 feet 6 inches gauge. The point is,
however, that Spanish Railways lack
finance for a speedy conversion to
standard gauge, and the French Rail-
ways will not push it while Spanish
rolling stock is inferior.

The photo at the head of Barry
Jones’ article (B., March 25) is not
that of a Spanish locomotive but one of
a Collin Super Pacific of the French
National Railways. The “Pacific”
refers to the wheel system, first used
in New Zealand, and later throughout
the world. These locomotives were prob-
ably some of the most fantastic light-
weight, extraordinarily high-powered
steam locomotives ever built, but as far
as I know never got within cooee of
Spain. As for Spanish trains generally,
milliards of pesetas are now being
spent on track relays, electrification, and
new equipment on a vast scale, with
enormous increases in passenger and
freight traffic as Spain becomes a highly
industrialised nation.
