Hollow Professions.
Nothin® is more disheartening to the true lover
of oivil and religious liberty than the evidences
which thrust themselves upon notice from every
hand that even those who have the sacred theme
perpetually on their lips are utterly insensible to
the true spirit of what they profess. These evi-
dences are so abundant that there is a positive
embarrassment in making a choice of examples.
We may cite almost the entire body of Britons.
The splendid principles of the Great Charter, as
embodied and amplified in the Constitution, are
constantly dwelt upon and referred to with pride,
and, apparently, earnest appreciation by all con-
ditions of Britons. They are held up to the envy
and admiration of the world as the perfection of
political arrangements, and as possessing an
inherent elasticity which enables them to resist
the direst stress, and to sustain without injury
the extremest oasualities. Yet so slender is the
leal appreciation of their value and reverence for
their immutability that the ruling caste in the
nation is permitted to supersede the entire code,
and to substitute a system utterly foreign and
repugnant to their spirit at the very crises when
their elastic and accommodating qualities are
brought to the tost. The boast of Britons is that
the Constitution is so plastic that it readily
adjusts itself to the spirit of each successive
epoch. The consent and good-will of the governed
is theoretically regarded as the fundamental spirit
of the whole system. Nevertheless, no inconsis-
tency is felt, no confession of a failure of the Con-
stitution is made, when tho entire machinery is
thrust aside, and where, in one-third part of the
British Isles, the people are subjected to armed
repression of their unanimous desires as to the
form which their institutions shall take within the
limits of the Constitution.
ail
Even the right of equal freedom to express their
sentiments and speak tho minds of their consti-
tuents is denied to members of Parliament. Mr.
Fobstee is cheered when hurling at Mr. Pak-
nbll, in unmeasured language, imputations which
brand him as the meanest, most treacherous, and
most bloodthirsty of villains. Yet when members
who, possessing theoretically equal privileges, re-
tort upon Mr. Fobstee in his own fashion, they are
peremptorily silenced, their voices strangled by
the bow-string of authority. Clergymen and
devout laymen of the reformed religion, in whose
system the right of private judgment in matters
of belief is tho cardinal article, are conspicuous iu
heaping obloquy, and invoking antiquated laws,
originally framed as weapons of bigotry to be used
against their own predecessors, upon the heads of
the newer heretics of to-day; men who profess
precisely what the earlier reformers professed—to
bo engaged in inculcating a now reformation, and
to be restoring human religion to its original and
pure elements. To come nearer home, we have
leading advocates of freedom of speech, and pro-
fessing adherents of the reasonable doctrines of
listening to both sides—of trying all things, and
holding fast to that which is good—applaud-
ing determined endeavours to refuse a place
wherein to speak to the advocate of a cause
against which prejudice prevails, and respecting
which no representations had before been avail-
able on any but the one side.
* • •
Then, looking further afield, we have the House
of Commons, the very sanctuary of liberty and
representative rights, furiously repulsing with
paltry quibbles and shameless force a duly-elected
representative ef the people of Northampton,
whose real offence is that he has actually exercised
that liberty of conscience of which our nation
professes to bo above all things proud to be the
peculiar aiffi especial home. We see the very
caste which has moat grievously suffered from the
disregard, by those who wield power, of the prin-
ciples of freedom and justice, and which might be
supposed to most keenly appreciate the value of
undeviatingly guiding conduct by those princi-
ples—the labouring orders —turning tyrants in
their turn, and refusing to members of their own
body the privileges of individual action and per-
sonal freedom. We have rattening in Sheffield,
Molly Maguirism in Pennsylvania, intimidation at
every strike, and boycotting in Ireland. And
when we turn to where the principles of liberty
and equality in their tullest acceptance are for-
mally recognized as the raison d'etre of the very
Government, we observe, as in France to-day,
Liberty fitting on the iron gauntlets of oppression
and intolerance. It is almost inconceivable that
apostles of liberty, writing for a free people,
should, as has been the case but the other day in
Paris, have uttered such an apostrophe as the
following;— *• Wilt thou not at last, U Republic,
shake off the Imperial and Royal vermin which.
after three or four ablutions of blood, still swarms,
foul, infectious, and contagious, in the cavities of
the country. Shake thy robe, O Goddess, and
scatter to the winds of Europe these parasites,
who dishonour thy sacred beauty. Let them go
and find a home upon those who like them, and
gorge their fill upon those who do not mind being
bitten!”
9 * *
It might be considered difficult to find a parallel
for such an exhibition of false apprehension of
what liberty really means. But it is furnished to
our hands by the attitude and conduct of our own
countrymen towards the fanatics who satisfy their
distracted consciences by parading the streets in
military trappings to make barbarous noises in the
name and for the love of God. It iS refreshing to
fiud an organ of the masses in England raising the
voice of protestation as follows
“The treatment of the Salvation Army is not the
only evidence that wo Englishmen, with all our boast-
ing, have still a great deal to learn before we shall
know the practical application of the doctrine of
‘ liberty of conscience.’ While the Salvationists are
mobbed and beaten in the streets for being too
obtrusively religious, the Speaker in the House of
Commons gives the word of command, and fourteen
policemen seize upon Mr. Bradlauoh and convey him,
struggling desperately, out of that august assembly
for being too obtrusively irreligious. Mr. Beadlaugh
was guilty of no violent or disorderly action. He was
a representative of the people, and the only thing that
he desired to do was to fulfil the conditions required
by the law before he might take his seat in the
Chamber. For this audacious desire on his part our
British guardians of law and liberty shut him up in tho
Clock Tower, hired policemen to commit an aggrava' cd
assault upon him, and are prepared to subject
him to similar treatment a second time should
he attempt to obey the law and discharge his
duty to his constituents. Then, a year or two
ago, we saw the strange and lamentable spectacle of the
Home Secretary of a (professedly) Liberal Government
prosecuting an obscure German exile, and obtaining his
incarceration from a courtly and obsequious Judge,
because he (the exile) had rejoiced in an unbecoming
manner at the murder of the Emperor Alexander.
And now there is a paper to be prosecuted on a charge
of blasphemy. Having regard to all these facts, it
seems to us that tho time has come when Englishmen
should wake up and ask themselves whither they are
drifting. There is nothing so easy as the formation of
a habit of persecution It comes as naturally to man
as his mother’s milk. It has always so many specious
arguments to recommend it. General Booth is such a
nuisance, Mr. Biudlaugh so extremely unfit for aris-
tocratic society, Herr Most so excessively bloodthirsty
and insignificant, and the Freethinker such a vulgar
and objectionable print. We may surely persecute
these without sinning against the great principle of
‘liberty of conscience.' Alas ! no. It is only that
which is disagreeable to us that we ever desire to per-
secute. The Athenians put Socrates to death because
he would ask unpleasant questions. They found this
practice of his so excessively disagreeable."
• • •
Reviewing these facts, and reflecting upon the
manifold instances beyond recounting which show
how the substance has been relinquished for the
shadow, the reality for the sound, it is fitting to
insist that every man shall awaken to a just and
complete sense of tho truth that political freedom
and liberty of conscience are not merely privileges
to be selfishly claimed for oneself or one's own
clique or class, but sacred and universal rights to
bo religiously conceded to those who are powerless
to resist violent oppression, or who hold views
which we most deeply dislike. There is no virtue
in granting freedom to one’s own party—iu claim-
ing liberty of conscience for one’s own sect. The
virtue lies in conceding freedom where one has
power to deny it, and in upholding liberty of con-
science for those whose opinions are most repug-
nant to one’s own ideas.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Judge of Lollies.
They have a new young Judge iu Queensland who is
almost worthy of a seat on our own Supreme Court
beach. This is a compliment to—somebody or other.
Judge Noel is considerably more than fourteen years of
ago, and already rivals Sir W illiam Manning in the
sagacity of his decisions and tbs soundness of his law.
It was only tho other day that he sentenced a man to
ten years' imprisonment for stealing a saddle-horse.
But it is as a libel-case Judge that Noel shines.
There was a children’s picnic at Charters Towers lately
in connection with a visit by the Premier, and Thadt
O'Kane and his crowd, being oppositionists, scoffed at
the excursion. Then some roughs went cut and made
a row, and spilt things. A whirlwind of newspaper
comment followed, and a man wrote to the
Towers Herald— a paper which runs against Thadt
O’Kane’s— a lob of almost incomprehensible balder,
dash about ‘‘lolly-looters," in which one Ross
Robinson was alluded to as " The Lolly-looters Lieu-
tenant." Now Boss Bobinson is Thady O’Kane’s right-
hand man. He brought an action against the Herald,
and the gravamen of his case was tha f the article
meant “ that plaintiff was a looter of children's lollies,
robbed them of their lollies—was a lieutsnant of the
Northern Miner in creating disturbances at he
picnic—that plaintiff planned a disturbance at the ban-
quet (to the Premier, a separate affair) to loot it and
rob it, or create a disturbance 1*' This prodigious case
was decided against the defendant, verdict one farthing.
It was then that Judge Noel, of whom we desire to
speak with all possible respect—which isn't much-
rose to the full altitude of Sir William Manning.
This juvenile SeLON, to whom looting of lollies still
seems the climax of outrage, actually certified for costa
on the higher scale, on the distinct grounds that the
case was a proper one to occupy the attention of the
Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court be a proper
tribunal to decide respecting the snatching of lollies,
what awful tribunal remains to adjudicate on the deeper
infamy of spilling treacle or ravishing away barley,
sugar?
The “Echo’s” Recommendation.
A chip of history worthy of present perusal is the
passage hereunder, from Leoky’s “ England in the 18th
Century." By the way, Lkckt is a “blackhearted
Saxon," a Scotchman; —“ The suppression of the
native race in the wars against Shane O’Neill, Des-
mond, and Tyrone, was carried on with a ferocity
which surpassed that of Alva iu the Netherlands, and
was hardly exceeded by any page in the blood stained
annals of the Turks. Thus a deliberate attempt was
made by a servant of the British Government to assas-
sinate, iu time of peace, the great Irish leader, Shane
O’Neill, by a present of poisoned wine j and although
the attempt failed, and tho assassin was detected and
arrested, he was at once liberated by the Government.
Essex accepted tho hospitality of Sir Beien O’Neill,
After a banquet, when the Irish Chief had retired
unsuspiciously to rest, the English General surrounded
the house with soldiers, captured the host, with
his wife and brother, sent them all to Dublin
for execution, and massacred the whole body of
his friends and retainers. An English officer, a friend of
the Viceroy, invited seventeen Irish gentlemen to
supper, and when they rose from the table he had them
all stabbed. A Catholic Archbishop, named Hurley,
fell into the hands of the English authorities; and,
before they sent him to the gallows, they tortured him,
to extort confession of treason, by one of the most
horrible torments human nature can endure—by roast-
ing his feet with fire. But these isolated episodes, by
diverting the mind from the broad features of tho war,
serve rather to diminish than enhance its atrocity.
The war, as conducted by Carew, by Gilbert, by
Pelham, by Mounijoy, was literally a war of exter-
ruination. The slaughter of Irishmen was looked
upon as literally the slaughter of wild beasts.
Not only the men, but even the women and chil-
dren who fell into the hands of the English,
were deliberately and systematically butchered."—
Those devices were pretty rough, and serve to some
extent to explain how the Irish people have been
brutalized. But, after all, not one of these expedients is
so ferociously horrible as that suggested the other day
by a Sydney journal: “ Euglaud will someday be justi-
fied in dealing with the Irish as Australia proposes to
deal with rabbits” I Tho loforonco pointed straight to
tho proposals that rabbits should Lo exterminated by
inoculating some with tuberculosis and syphilis, and
trusting to tho spread of those diseases. This means
that throughout a whole nation a poisoned virus should
bo diffused —that the husband, contaminated himself,
should watch his bride wither away and perish—that
the wife should weep over the decay and fatal sufferings
of the husband of her heart —that no child should be
bora without the deadly virus working in its veins—
that the joys of maternity should he converted to
anguish—and that when the babe smiled in its
mother’s arms she could but weep and moan at
the fearful knowledge that if it did not* succumb
and shrink under infantile forms of the disease
it would surely perish just as the bud and promise of
adolescence bloomed in its cheeks. Assassination is a
hotrible thing. Even the assassination of individuals.
But the secret cowardly device of the poisoner, is the
most detestable. The cowardly ruffians who enclose
contagious germs in the linen of a politician excite the
loathing of mankind. What, then, should be the
execration which is merited by ruffians still mote
cowardly—because they devise infamies they lack
courage to execute—who suggest tho pollution of a
whole people, and tho slow poisoning of a generation
yet unborn. The suggestion issued from the establish-
ment of the Sydney Morning Herald, and will be
found verbatim in the Echo of April 5th.
Their Feelings and our History.
In the report of the trustees of the Free Public Library
there is a passage that wants to be read between tho
lines. It is that relating to the reprinting and repub.
lication of the Sydney Gazette and of the Orders in
M8. of Governors Hunter and Phillip. The repro.

civilization in those regions, was recommended to
tile Mini ter in 1882, and the Under-Secretary replied
that provision would be made for the purpose in the
Estimates for 1883. Yet no such provision has been
made. And in the course of a few years, on account of
the badness of the printer's ma f erials used, t ha Gazette
will be illegible. To explain this seeming neglect, we
have an episode of list Friday night's consideration of
the Supplementary Estimates. Mr. Stuart asked for a
sum of money to dtfray expenses of “editing” some
pape-s which hid just reach-d the colony relating to
its early da; s. It would, he said, be necessary that
these pipers were edited by some “competent 1 ' person,
so as not to wound anyone’s feelings ! So, by devious
ways we arrive at the truth. The repnbjication of the
Gazette and the M 1. Orders is delayed! and the new
papers are to be "edited,” in order that the Potts Point
and Dirlin* Point school of wealthy proletarians, the
shoddy jeune dorJes, might be spared. Now, as to the

Convenient Loyalty.
Sik Henby Pabkes will probably bo cunning to
the day c£ hia death, but signs multiply that he
has already survived his cleverness The flame
which was artificially fanned up in the community
before Mr. Redmond set foot in the colony, and
which was for a lime laboriously kept alive, has
been steadily flickering out as artificial stimula
tion has abated. In proportion as people were
left to form their own conclusions, their minds
and apprehensions calmed down. They discovered
tardily what they would have perceived at first
had they not been misled —that the Devil (Red-
mond) is not so black as he is painted. Reflec-
tion forces upon them the circumstance that no
man at present in the colony has more strongly
denounced outrage and assassination than he.
They begin to perceive that of all men in this part
of the world he has suffered most from the
fashion in which the Irreqoncilables or Invin-
oibhs in Ireland have taken the cause of
that most unhappy country out of the hands
of the organisers and advocates of Constitu-
tional agitation. And, above all, it dawns upon
them that in no one of his public addresses has a
disloyal sentiment fallen from his lips. Mr. Red-
mond has indeed freely advocated a separate
Parliament for Ireland. Rut neither ha nor any
member of the National League has ever hinted
at a separate Monarch. Now, it is not disloyal to
demand a separata Parliament. t'ho greater
iiumoar of British dependencies already possess
that institution, and unquestionably derive benefit
from it This diiticotiun must be clearly realized
In no quarter does a people owe *’ loyalty " to a
Parliament. It is to a Sovereign only that loyalty
is duo. there have been occasions when a Parlia-
ment—aye, the British House of Commons —has
itself been disloyal to the It was
the Parliament which caused (Jhabl.es 1. head
to be chopped off. If the entire population
of the colony sympathised with Mr. Red
mond s desire for an Irish Pari ament, they
would not be open to a charge of disloyalty ;
and, as a fact, the people are on this subject much
divided lint there is no difference anywhere as
to loyalty to the Sovereign With monarchical
institutions there is universal contentment And
nothing abort of gross miagorermnent and inter-
ference with our own management of our own
affii'-s is likely to disturb the sentiment sir
Henby Pabk>s made a mistake The history of
his political career has been a history of »droit
doiges. i’he decadence of nis powers is marked
by bis attempts to profit by adodgo which was not
adroit. His success hitherto has been mainly due
to the cleverness with which he veiled real motives
and paraded simulated convictions. In the pre-
sent instance he failed because his insincerity was
transparent. The members of the Assembly and
the people of the colony recognized and felt that
an attempt was being made to profit by their real
loyalty by a man who when it had suited his purposes
had repeatedly professed hia sympathy with
rebellion. It was impossible in view of thn resus-
citation of Pabkks’ own disloyal verses, and
speeches, to accept his protestations of enthusiastic
loyalty without suspicion. And very slight reflec-
tion showed that ms motive was not to strengtnun
the hands of Her Majesty’s Government in Great
■Britain, but to embarrass Her Majesty s Govern-
ment in New South Wales.
On comparing our quotation from the Echo with the
text, we fl id aa inaccuracy in one word, which, how-
ever, does not affect our argument. The quotation
shou'd read: “England will a line day be justified in
dealing with Irish rebels as Australia proposes to deiq
with rabbits."

ships.
Stuart, in reply to Parkes, put it just in this way.
Hi yielded to no une in his loyalty to the Queen. Our
Parliament and our people were loyal, and bad ex-
pressed their seacimeu s spontaneously—the expres-
sions of attachment to the Quo. u contain d in the last
Address in ueply needed no reiteration. Fifty Bed-
mouds couldn't abates our al egiauoe ; yet Parke a
wmted to say rhat one hedmond could do it Eve y-
oae loathed mu der; but Parses not only wished to
say we d.-tested as assinatiou, but to declare In the same
lire -th that we unreservedly approved of al the British
Parliament s Irish 1 gis ation—while a large minority
of the Commons denied the utility of the legislation in
question Were wo going to criticise the Bri ish
Parliament, end be snubbed oven as the Canadian
Parliameut had been snubbed ? Parkes’ address
■ mitted to state, as did tbs Canadian one, that Her
Majesty’s Irish subjects there wore amongst the most
loyal and devoted 10 the throne That was equally
true of the Irish people of New South Wales (Chois )
Why clidn t Parties, wren the Irish legislation he pio-
fessed to admire wus before the 0 mmons, endeavour
to obtain for it the approval o£ the N.B W, Parliament ?
The aurassina'oons w re committed while Parses wan

to express horror- not new, when thesuspieionuaturady
arose that thv moti u was brought for .v rd tor the i im-
pose of sowing party and sectarian discor l in the col ny.
Parkes used o be iis eeed to with respect—now he has
become puerile; he wished people (w. am he wanted to
mate out were in drug r of losing their loyalty) to act
like peniieut druutards and take the pledg . if Parker
wOuid consent to cut down the address to an expression
of loyalt.i, the Government won d voie for it though he
considered it unnecessary. The sneering laugh of
Par-.es told him that the ex-Peeuder would not so con-
Si-ni. Therefore, ho moved the previous qn stiou.
Which was put and curried by 48 to 25.

HER PASSION.
A TRAGIC POEM—IN ONE CANTO.
CANTO I.
Gloom reigned within the bouse; end there
Was hoard no foot tap on the stair.
And lying, stretched, on the flyer, behold,
All bedabbled and dank her tresses gold,
A maiden, clad in a snow white dress.
Who was of surpassing loveliness !
Her hands were clenched, and as cold as stone ;
She spoke not sighed not; but a light groan
Escaped, sometimes, from her lips to pale.
And told, at once, a harrowing tale.
Her father came in the event’’da.
And silent he knelt her couch beside.
And wept; for he saw, in the chamber dim,
That the girl averted her gaze from him !
** Oh, Plorilinel” the father said,
And low was bent that hoary head,
“ Arouse thyself I My love, awake !
Or tiro thy father's heart will break.”
The girl but muttered a deep drawn sigh.
And gently murmured : “ Let mo die 1“
The last rays, then, of tha setting sun
x Warm in upon her pale face shone ;
Then, clutching the hand of her sire, she cried:
11 What’s life to me, if I’m not his bride ?
** The lights were flavhicg—the scene was gay;
*Twas blithe and bright as a Summer’s day;
The masio played a well-loved set
Of waltzes, when my eyes his met !—
What eyes they were! To mo they seem
Like the angels’ eyes one sees in a dream I
One glance of his on my own orbs shone—
And my soul was flad’and my heart was gone!”
“ Who is this man ?” the father said;
** Some play’r who earns his frugal bread.
And flaun’s his painted face o’ nights
Before the glare of the false footlights ?”
*' ’Tis false I No man who acts a part
Has gained, dear father, j our daughter’s heart
“ No play’r— tis well 1 Then tell; now ceme I”
" ’Tis the man, dear father, who boats the drum I”

The Autophone is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while it weighs less than three pounds), has the
lungs of a full-sized parlour organ, and executes its
music with absolute precision and perfect effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and all
the parts of most difficult music.
On it, a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of over 300
selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes,
Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &o. It is best adapted
to the kind of mnsio which suits an organ best, in wliich
chords predominate, but, also has wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces.
It is pitched for the voice or orchestra, and has a
little card holder for convenience in singing. Any
Orchestral Instrument, Violin, Flute, &o., can be
played to accompany the Autophone.
It is entirely well-adapted for Country Churches,
Sunday Schools, the Family Circle, and also for Dane-
ing.
The AUTOPHONE is like every other good thing,
the longer y®u have it, the better you like it, and as new
mnsio is being publuhed every week, it has an endless
fond of amusement in it.

Extract from the Continental Gazette,

The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of E. Anheuser
& Co.’s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eclipsed Bass, Barclay and Perkins, Alsop A Guinness,
the world-renowned Eoglish brewers, as well as hun-
dreds of rivals from Austria and Bavsria. It is not
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro.
nouuecd the St. Louis -beer “ superior to any malt
liquor ever draok upon the continent,” and that all
Paris is now seeking to quaff the American nectar.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
A Sydney paper the other day spoke about an
ex officer of the line driving a hansom. That’s nothing.
We know an ex-gnardsman who, having 11 gone to the
dogs" in sheep-farming, has developed into a hot-
saveloy man.
Apropos of the marriage, early in the morning,
of Archdeacon Boss, of Artnidaie, it is explained that
all weddings will hesceforth take place not later than
5 a m This gives the bride's female relatives time
to say good-bye to her before the evening train comes.
The remains of T. M. Stabbing, late editor of
the Patriot New York, received a carious funeral. He
was a nocod unbeliever, and a few weeks ago wrote a
farewell editorial to hie readers, in which he spoke
quite freely about his own approaching death (from
consumption). He directed that no minister should
read over his grave, and that mourners should sing
« Marching through Georgia" going to the grave, and
11 Goodbye, my Love" returning; all of which, was
done.
Many ‘ ydnsyitss, especially those who, in search
of health, have visited the hot springs of Botomahana,
N Z., will be sorry to bear of the death of Dr. Lewis,
the leoal Gsveroment medical officer. The doctor, who
was formerly surgeon of H M.S. Got movant, was a
prime favourite with bis messmates and made hosts of
friends wherever he went. He died at tho early age of
about 28, of typhoid fever, which is now very prevalent
at Ohlnemntu, owing chiefly to the filthy condition
into which the settlement has been allowed to drift by
its Maori owners. The fact that Dr. Lewis had only
recently been married Lnda additional sadness to his
untimely decease.
“ Bill Tunks ” is dead, or as tho S M. Herald
puts it, Mr. William Tanks, formerly M P, for St Leo-
nards, is no more. He was a man known all over
N 8. W., and as widely trusted. He was a contractor in
his day, and built the telegraph line between Sydney
and Melbourne. He was king of St. Leonards, and was
Mayor of the place for about fourteen consecutive
years—a fact, however, which shouldn’t tell against
him in public estimation. Mr. Tanks was no politician,
except that he very often lent money to statesmen and
never got it back. He was a man of strong common
sense, but rather conservative in his notions. He was
a big solid looking native (born at the Nepean in 1816),
and wore long hair and loose trousers—he might have
passed for a poet only that he was always sober. Wil-
liam Tunks leaves behind him a good reputation and a
big family.
Women may be interested to know Proctor’s
experiences of wearing stays. Well, here is what ho
tells" When the subject of oorset-waaring was under
discussion, I was struck with the apparent weight of
evidence in favour of tight-laoing. I was, in particular,
struck by the evidence of some as to its use in reducing
corpulence I was corpulent I thought 1 would give
this matter a fair trial. I read all the instructions,
carefully followed them, and kept the busk on for four
weeks. ' Then I laughed at myself as an idiot, and gave
up the attempt to reduce natural substance by artificial
means. But I was reckoning without my host. As the
Chinese lady Buffers, I am told, when her feet-bindinga
are taken off, and as the flat-headed baby howls when
his head-boards are removed, so for a while was it with
me. For one month of folly, I endured three months
of discomfort."
Tawhaio, the Maori monarch, seems to be the
“ Old King Coal ” of the age. Ha is never sober now
by any chance. It may be said that he is careful to
avoid suoh chances. Certain Mormon elders, who are
over in New Zealand canvassing for converts, got hold
of Tawhaio, and after filling him up with rum, induced
him to issue the following extraordinary ukase to his
people:—"It is my word to ail the Maoris that they
should believe in Mormonism. They must believe in
it, or I will leave them--1 will even leave this country
and go and oamp at the Salt Lake in Utah, tho place cf
the Mormons." His people don't seem to have been
much affected by this throat; indeed, there seems to be
a strong though unexpressed desire that he should go
somewhere, it it were even to Gehenna. Tawhaio is,
after all, no better and no worse than most kings and
prophets of the present day—only he hasn't the taot to
conceal his frailties.
Another page in the history of romance will be
filled by the tale of the Duchesse de Chaulnes. At 18
years of age, with a superb head of golden hair, Mdlle.
Sophie Galitzln was said to be the most beautiful girl
in Franco. She married the Dac de Chanlnea, one of
the first peers of the Empire. But she—ahem I—didn’t
discriminate between the man she had married and tho
men she hadn’t manied, and this unbecoming forgetful-
ness on her part so annoyed the Dac that he gradually
died. Then she discriminated lees than ever, and her
late husband’s mother took the children away, for fair
they would become gay, too. Sophio brought a law-
suit to recover them, but was unsuccessful; and her
fortune went with her children. She went for a while
to her own mother, but quarrelled with her also. Then
she went to lodge with an old servant in the poorest
quarter of Paris, then took to morphia; all her friends
deserted her except tho old family doctor, who cutoff
her golden hair; and then, in a hovel, she died, aged 24.
A queen of society a year ago!
The aristocracy is in a very nice state, indeed.
After a few years’ of married life. Lady Blandford dis-
covered that Lord Blmdford had beau “concerned”
with Lady Aylesford. Lord Aylesford applied for a
divorce on account of this little indiscretion of her
ladj ship, but his lordship was found to have been
" concerned ” with some other lady, so he didn’t get it.
Lady Blandford condoned hot lord’s trifling indecorum,
and they lived together again, till she again dis-
covered 'that ha was carrying on the same old gait e.
Accused thereof, his lord-ship gaily admitted that it was
even so, and further admitted that ha was the proud
patrician father of a fine boy* who would unite, if he
did his parents justice, the virtues of both the Ayles-
ford and Blandford families. Lord Aylesford is a
favourite in the Prince’s set, and his missis (though
we’re not quite sure whether she’s mostly his or the
other gentleman’s) is a very pure, bright specimen < if
the upper orders. Every one is sorry for Lady Bland,
ford, who is daughter of tho Duke of Abercorn. While
Lord Blandford (George Charles Spencer Churchill) is
brother to Lord Randolph Churchill, and son of the
Duke of Marlborough He is not, however, the bus-
band of Lady Blandford now.
We wonder how all these nice “ jammy ” para-
graphs about Mr. Uolonua-Gioso get into the papers :
This is from tho Armidale Chronicle :—"Mr. Colonna-
Close had a herculean task yesterday in defending
George Bnshourne on the charge of wbful murder. Mr.
Colonua-Closo was assigned as counsel for the defence
of the wretched criminal, and all who heard that
gentleman plead for the life of the doomed man must
acknowledge that tb e defence set up was the only one
that could be in the slightest degree available. A.1-
though rather long, Mr. Colonna-Closo’s adiress nearly
approached a master-piece of casuistry, not to say
special pleading. Had Mr. Colonnu-Olose any founda-
tion to work upon there is not the slightest doubt that
other results might have occurred. Mr. Co'onna-Close,
although ho had not such an opportunity of displaying
his talents in the Cathedral city as he doubtless would
desire* won golden opinions from all those wilh whom
he has come in contact, and shows that ho possesses
the Hall Mark of a first class English barruter.
Ahem! We notice, however, that the S.M. Herald, in
a telegram announcing the result of tho trial, did not
mention tbe name of this illustrious descendant of the
Frangipani, but merely alluded to him as “ tho counsel
assigned by the Crown” Gall!
They say now that the real reason why the
Princess Louise did not winter in Canada was that she
could not etidure Lady Macdonald, the wife of the
Canadian Premier. Prior to the arrival of the Prin-
etas. Lady Macdonald was at the head of Canadian
soaiety, but Her Rnal Highness speedily endeavoured
to assert her supremacy. It is sad to think that Lady
Macdonald was nc* loyal enough to yield the coveted
position to the daughter of her sovereign. But it is
true for all that. A sort of civil war began, m which
Lady Macdonald organised her own Mlowtrs so as to
practically monopolise the society of the Princess.
But the latter was clever enongh to blon if wo may be
allowed to use such a low word in connection with
such a haughty subject - h<?r fair enemy At a certain
reception at Government Heuse, the Princess selected
the pretty wife of a French senator to ta k to, ana, as
Lady Macdonald did not understand a word of the
language, she had to stand by wholly nnnouoad Then
the story goes that a feminine war of words ensued, in
which Her Royal Highness got so mnch the worst of it
(bat she left the field to her foe. Wnat asses we have
beeal We always believed till now that mem'ers of
royal families were beings of higher nature, supeiior to
the small spites and paltry jealousies which rankle in
the plebeian heart. But credulity and childish romance
have always been onr rnin.
For serene and immeasurable snobbery, the
British plutocratic class runs our own gilded idiots
pretty elose. Take this for an instance (we quote from
an English paper)“ On the day of the arrival of the
Prince of Wales at Cannes, he hastened from the train
to church,” (pious Albert Edward I)" but getting there
late, slipped in among the footmen and ladies’ maids,
one of whom effsred him her prayer-book. She, recog-
nising him, marked, when he loft, the chair he occupied,
so as to bo able to identify it, and after evening service,
her lady, who is a Liverpool ootton-broker’a wife,
expressed much disappointment at net being able to
bay it of the sexton." This is loyalty if you like.
Next to being the Prince of Wales himself wa should
like better than anything else to bo his valet. The
sale of tbe parings of His Royal Highness’s bunions
and toenails alone ought to realise enongh in a year for
a person of modest ideas to retire upon. But asinine
as tbe snddou millionaire section of the British public
is, it is not quite as forlornly fooliah as the correspond-
ing class out here. It is alleged that when the Jook of
Edinburgh was in Australia, ho stayed one night at tho
house of a certain South Australian squatter. In the
course of his sojourn, he found occasion to wash his
hands—dukes ore always particular about having clean
hands. After ho had gone, the daughters of the house
reverently decanted the water he had usrd for this
purpose out of tho basin into out glass carafes, and
drank it 1 God bless our Sailor Prince 1
In a certain Biitisb colony, which will bo name-
less, a certain noted Colonel had frequently to adminis-
ter the Government in the absence of vice-royalty.
This Colonel had a partiality for Hounessy, and, in his
spiritual intervals, was in the habit of putting hia
whole family—wife, children, man-servants,- and maid-
servants—through drill exercise. Even " the stranger
within hia gates" was not exempt; for any one who
happened to interview him on these genial occasions,
would, as soon as ushered into his presence, be struck
dumb by :eoeiving tbe order, " Attention !" followed
by •• Salute 1" It he did not at once comply with these
words of command, the Colonel wou'd jell, "Right
about turn 1—quick march!" and march the in-
terviewer would, without doing his business.
When Aoting-Qovemor, his spiritual manifesta-
tions were phenomenally extraordinary. Ho would
walk or ride with no one, unless they ware slightly
in his rear; and anyone failing in this regard soon got
a hint in no very choice terms. Even hia better-half
was not exempt from this rule. On one occasion, When
just ahjut entering the poroh [of tho cathedral, one
Sabbath, she inadvertently violated the law, when at
once those in the vicinity were struck with the irate
delivery of his favourite formula on such occasions :
" Halt, madam I I’m the sanguinary Governor I Two
paces to the rear 1 March I ” And march ste did
Among other exploits was one in connection with his
butcher. The "man of blood" had one morning sent
along a leg of mutton which did not suit his spiritual
taste. The gallant Colonel at onoa shouldered the log,
and, marching double-quick down to the butcher’s
shop, hove it straight at him with unerring aim. This
little incident, which got into tho press, gained him tho
sobriquet of “ The Leg of Mutton Oolonol.”
As tho Herald, in its ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
has not cleared up that point about Max Strakosoh
being Adelina Patti’s brother-in-law, wa may as well do
so ourselves. There were four Patti children. Tho
eldest was a girl, and married Max Strakosoh. Car-
lotta, Adelina, and Carlo followed in this order.
-Madame Straokosoh has bean living (with an allowance
from her husband) in Paris for many years. Their
daughter is married to Mons. Bourdillou, a proonreur
of the iRepnblio. Madame Strakosoh had a beautiful
soprano voice, and made her dobdt in New York shortly
after her marriage to Max. She was, however, soon
withdrawn from the stage by her husband, whose atten-
tion was wholly taken up by the care of Adelina, who
certainly owes her triumphant entry into the operatic
world to his training As an irapressario he is nn-
rivalled, although his brother, Maurice, is following in
his footsteps. Carlo Patti, the youngest and only
brother, was a brilliant musician, though somewhat of
a bon viveur. Ho was leader of tho orchestra at Fisk’s
Opera House, and died when about 24 years of age.
His widow also died about the same time, leaving a little
girl to the charge of her relations. It report speaks
truly, this little girl has inherited in a remarkable
degree the family talent, and is being nursed as a pro-
bable successor to tho “ Diva." Cariotta and Adelina
are in deadly feud with one another, Cariotta in
particular carrying it to outrageous lengths. For
example : She was silled to sing at Sheffield, at a concert
got up at great expense. 0n her arrival by train, and
while being driven to her hotel, she saw through the cab
windows the large posters announcing that " Cariotta
Patti, sister of the eminent Adelina," &o , &3. Tbe
" sister of the eminent” was too mnoh for her, so she
ordered the cabman to turn back again to the station,
and actually took tho next train for London. This
freak cost her dear, however, for the promoters of the
concert sued, and recovered substantial damages.
Adelina is forty years of age this week, being born in
April in 1843, in Madrid.
Scandal-mongers never languish long for a topic
to wag their tongues on. Tho patrician society of
England affords them Perhaps it’s all
because your patrician is on an eminence and in full
view of a carping and envious democracy Anyhow, if
wa have no longer any of tho once periodical pecca-
dilloes of the genial “ Wales." we have what is a groat
deal worse—some slip of a Shrewsbury, disgrace of a
Hamilton, or lache of a Lowthsr. Tbe Lowthors are
what Bnrke, the Peerage editor, calls a "great’ family.
There are a great many " gtoat’’ families in England,
though in what their groalness consists it would be
difficult to discover, unless it isin great blackguardism.
With a fractional few exceptions, none of the present
heads give evidence of anything else. The fact is their
groatnoes comes only from thoir power, their power from
their wealth, and thoir wealth from lands they pillaged
and pirated, or sucked and schemed for centuries ago,
and have no more real right to than a bushranger or a
bank robber has to the proceeds of his profession Well,
the Low there, Earls of Lonsdale, are a “ great family
in this way By a lucky lurch for the present
Earl, the title took a side jump from an uncle
a few years ago. When the father of tbe pra-
sent generation succeeded to the heirship, he had
been plain Mr. Lowtber, with a paltry income, for 54
vears P Though he came suddenly into £203,000 per
annum, he didn’t lose his head over it. but his sons
did The eldest was then 17; he graduated in the
society of grooms, and stable-boys, and cads; and he
did credit to his education. His exploits, with a kingly
inoome to squander, hia disgraceful debauches, and his
marriage while a mere boy with the housemaid of hik
tutor, unquestionably hastened, if they did not cause,
his father's death. His escapades at the Argyle Rooms,
where he would pass half-an-hour handsfnl
cf sovereigns to the demi-mondaine habitues of the
placs; his special trains, if but for a few miles jour-
ney; the brutish intemperance of his life; his mar-
riage while drunk to Lady Gladys Herbert, who had
persistently followed him till she caught him ; his
prosecution, a couple of years ago, of a wretched man
whose mind had been impaired by the use of zoedone.
and who had written him a letter containing an alleged
libel on his rather fast-going Countess, bat which
(though everybody knew what it referred to) was by
the favouritism of the court withheld from publication;
his vaohting adventures, which at times consisted of
arousing the inhabitants of Whitehaven by firing from
the deck of his yacht, while she lay moored In the harbor,
a royal salute of 21 gnus at two or three in the morn,
ina: his shucking about of five-pound notes to the touts
in t\ie ringr at overy race in which he had a horoe; and,
lastly, his death, from drink, a year ago, unattended at
his bedside by his wife, who, during his last iNness, was
amusing herself in her own way at Cannes, or Monaco,
or some such place, where plenty of good-looking young
men are always to be found-all are too olear in the
mioda of bis countrymen to fear that his memory will
ever fail of the hue that is verdant. He was succeeded
bv his brother Hugh, who can ride to hounds, but can t
epell. Ho had already disbursed tho £ 10,000 which was
left him shortly before at his father’s death It quickly
went on the turf; and even before his brother died,
Hugh Lowther made so sure of the impossibility of the
"Giosy ’’ Countess presenting his physically enervated
brother with any heir, that he earned Lady Grace
Gordon 'sister of the Mirqais of Huntley), a pretty
but penniless girl, who was a splendid horsewoman.
‘ The latter qualification made up for e™ r y° ther defi-
ciency in his eyea-and they wore married. Everything
1 seemed to go on propitiously. The Bari was drinking
himself 10 death as fast as he could, and money advances
to the next heir were easily obtainable, oven though
tho pir-ojotago was rather high. But one fine morn-
ing it was formally announced that the accouchement
of the young Countess of Lonsdale | might be expected
Well, horelwas a bombshell for HugtLowther. Perhaps
he wasn’t in a rage; and the things he went about
saying—how he’d test tho question of legitimacy if it
turned out to be a boy, and things like t.iat. As it
turned out a girl, this additional scandal was spared to
the already notorious “great" family. But, though he
escaped this, the exemplary Earl has already run him-
self into another. There bad bean a loll in the patrician
esc.'.pados for a while; the scandal market was sluggish,
so when a paragraph appeared in the World stating
that a young married peer had eloped with a young
lidv of noble rank, society jumped at it eagerly. Hero
the "great" family again came to the (oro ; for after
much delay and much laboured thought, and mnoh
trying of it carefully on, tho Earl of Lonsdale concluded
tho cap fitted him, so he put it on. The editor of the
World denied it was intended for him, and apologised ;
and indeed everyone was quite satisfied that it couldn’t
possibly apply to Hugh Lowther, whose taco and figure
could never be imagined os attractive enough to invite
any young Isdy of rADk into oloping with him. Never-
thoiess, tho Court gave him leave to file a criminal bill
against Edmond Yates, of the World, and a > he is using
all his groat wealth now to try and prove himrolf even
a bigger scoundrel than people suspect him to be.

A Christchurch money-lender is an ill-used man.
He lent £50 to a widow, who kept a boarding-house, and
got a bill of sale over her furniture for £50, which sum
she was to pay in weekly instalments of £1. She paid
off £30 in (his way, when Moses Shemominee suddenly
discovered that his bill of sale was illegal. So he put
a bailiff in possession, and, rubbing hia greasy palms,
joyfully waited for the slaughter. The widow got a
friend to help her, and got quit of the bailiff by paying
£50. She then brought an action against Moses for
idegal distraint and money overcharged, and recovered
£50 and costs. Moses then “ went tor" an editor who
had written pleasantly of him, and hit him with a stick.
The editor closed on the Hebrew, and got his head in
chancery, but did not punish him on account of his age.
He summoned him, however,for assault, and once more
the poor Israelite was condemned to lose “ monish" by
the unciroumcised Gentiles. Truly, the atrocities in
Kuseia are nothing to this.

Messieurs ! Attention ! George Musgrave, Esq..
D.O.L., artived on Wednesday morning. From careful
inquiries made at the effl e cf the Theatre Royal, we
learnthat although he has been forty-eight hours in the
metropolis no smile has lit np the loveliness of that
alabaster brow.
The Italian Opera Company (which, in our light-
headed moments we have alluded to ssBully Cowley s)
• pens at the Gaiety Theatre on Saturday night next.
wHave heard some of the artists in this company
before, but. it is only fair to say, under
The uiKht we attended their concert at the Royal they
hsdtocome ont on a stage as baldhf attractiveness as
a page cf the Bum and sing sceiiw while the stage car-
penters were hammering away behind as y
afraid the end of the world would come before they got
through with their work So that we h * v ® bardly
formed a regular f< ur-sided e xpeetat ion a to J blt "«
shall hear when they open in opera under advantageous
circumstances. There aie names
gramme, anyhow, to make a burial brillifct if they
choose to give that instead of an opera 1“ *act, wo
should imagine that Naples and Milan are v y
some in the theatrical season 3 u st now. TUe
oniy English name on the het is that .
Alice Bees, who is pnmo donna lejgtcia, which is
very creditable for one so young, being, to use
a Ane old Italian proverb, cha sen a ta ’ a s
fignoifa civita veahia corpo iv Saccho, a very i r«
thing indeed. By the way, Bayliss now, though
ho cannot protend to that easy familiarity with the
Tuscan tongue which is one of our distinguishing gifts,
is making rapid strides with the cultivation of a wily
Italian smile. Wo say strides advisedly. Anybody
who has seen the smile in question will understand ns
The repertoire of the It alian Opera Company is unusually
large; almost toe large for us. But our appstites for
this sort of thing are unusually small. We admit to
having a vulgar leaning to circnres and gif t-shows, much
the bs we should, it it were not for style, prefer
shandy-gr.il' to champagne. But, style or no style, wa ere
glad there )“ a change of some sort in the Gaiety pro-
gramme. We are fond of change. And we are pre-
pared to bo pleased with tbs new comers—that is if we
conscientiously cm. Bnt wo shall see what wa shall
see.

Mr. Frank Cates leaves for Melbourne next
week to join Mr. Wybert Keeve. Mr. Cates is an aotor
whom we shall miss mnoh—the public more. So here's
to him in rhyme :—
Frank Cates, good bye ! We haveno time
To write a sonnet—
But say God speed in simple thyme.
God speed, and luck where’er yin stray.
You’ve acted like a man—each way—
Our hand npon it!

The ’Frisco mail takes away on Thursday,
Dixon, cue of the few genuine singers in that band of
desperate free-lunohers, the Clarke and Hyman min-
strels. That Mr. D. goes home on his little pink ear,.
is certain; bnt that's not his fault. No one man can
draw a town, though one American minstrel can pre-
cions near clear out one. “ I’ll be all right when I get
to ’Frisco,’’ said a negro minstrel once to us, tacking a
sardine-plate on to the sole of his boot, while his
11 missis” fastened the brim of his bat with a tenpenny
nail. “ Everybody knows mo there.” We should smile 1
Good luyk to Dixon. Wo wish wo had such a voice.

A CONTRETEMPS,
“ Oh, who is that creature.
That's formed so divinely—
A charm in each feature,
Her eyes sparkling finely P”
The young man was fiery
Who made this enquiry.
Ho ssw this girl stunning
At—ah I this is stinging—
The Opera Dunning,
A dancing and singing.
He fell in love madly—,
Fell out of it sadly.
He was full-faced and florid—
He never drank hard, sirs—
Two inches of forehead.
And girth of two yards, sirs.
But now he’e grown thinner,
He saw her at dinner !

“Tho Eomany Eye,” aa we suppose several
people know. Is still on at the Royal. This is not a
brilliant commencement to a theatrical par., but it is
better than brilliancy. It is the terewtb. There is
nothing new to chronicle, except the indisposition of
Goodie, who has, by reason of his honeymoon, been
absent from his (theatrical) duties for some time. It
seems that Blend Holt is to succeed the Gifted George
as the star; and will play—to the confusion of Larry
Foley, who will be broken-hearted at not scouring the
play ho has dreamed of ever since he sang about the
angels at his mother’s knee: long before he ever
thought of tapping Sandy Boss, or “ propping’’ Abo
Hicken “ in the bread-basket.”

There is a green and quiet grave,
W here winds blow soft and low;
And leeks (in season) gently wave.
And Spanish onions grow.
It is a sombre, solemn place,
Funereal—bnt, hold!
O, render, here a little space,
While we a tale unfold.
There was an actor once—now this
Is true —he was a man
Whoso thirst for fame by furlongs his
Ability outran.
A wondrous cuss be was, and mad ;
His face was shaven; and
You never saw him but he had
Sonte paper in his hand.
His sole desire—it was, you bet —
To blossom as a star ;
And day and night he strove to get
A eulogistic par.
He followed us from morutlll night,
Also from night till morn ;
Until we wished with nil cur might
We never had been horn.
For, when we did not call him good—
In capitals, to wit —
Ho told ns plump, sirs, that we could
Not criticise a bit.
We got so sick, we nearly died.
The thing we couldn’t stand;
Till, flinging down the pen. wo cried
“ Now you can try your hand.”
The grave. Well he—you’ll understand,
Lies here, that poor “ criteek ;"
He criticised his fellows, and
T hey killed him in a week.

We went round to the Opera House the ether
day in search of religious instruction from Miss
Ivanova (we’re glad it’s not I’vanova, as that would
recall to our recollection Spofforth, whom —thank
Heaven!—we have almost forgotten!); but that
lady having gone early to chapel, we were forced to
seek a dark corner of the ofiice and pray alone. Our
devotions concluded, wo looked round the place, and,
getting used to the darkness, discovered him fast asleep
in a thimble. Awaking almost immediately, he re-
quested us to wait while he performed his ablutions;
which he satisfactorily accomplished by means of a
rose-petal Be explained that for many Tears he had
used an acorn ; but that, on one occasion, the attendant
fairy bad carelessly put in half-a-dozen rain drops too
much, and he, unsuspiciously plunging into bis morn-
ing tub, had nearly come to an untimely end. Dunning,
we mean.

Mr. Dunning reports things as satisfactory, but
says ho only wishes the theatre were as large as W J.
Wilson’s heart—a rather neat way of putting it His

how much they are when the curtain goes down, he did
not ot the time, explain. •' Boccaccio ’’ will be sue-

There is a very great deal of beauty there, which you

Since the Habald critic pronounced George
Dean, of the Boccaccio Company, the Tamleiho of the
Antipodes, it is generally thought that ou the opening
night of the opera, he must have flapped forward the
wrong ear. Every cleau and well-appointed ontio has
one ear for music and one for the drammer. On this
occasion, therefore, it is considered by competent
mdses that the dramatic punkah was brought into re-
auitition by mistake. Mr. Dean is a clover young
gentleman even now; and when he has out his dramatic
teeth he will he cleverer still. But he’s got to chew
the india-rubber ring a bit longer yet before he can as-
pire to immortal fijme. Why, we have cut our your-
nalislio teeth for Jt>«rs, and yet ecnsider we can only
toddle. But we can bite!
Wo are in the dust. After stating in rhyme,
which could scarcely have been penned by Milton, that
Lily Marsh had struck it rich, matrimonially, we now
learn, by letter from the lady herself, that rumour in
this instance lied like a circus poster. Lily’s letter is
a communication the pothooks and hangers of which
wi 1 live in our remembrance until we are executed, or
until wo pass peacefully away, with a glass of colonial
wine in one hand and the Shroud in the other. Gently
abbreviated, and with a few verbal s’ops slid in, Miss
Marsh’s commnnica i'n is as follows: “ To the Editor
of The Bulletin. Sir,— In your of the 7th inst.
axipears an intimation of my mirriasre (in verse), and,
as it is totally false, I must request you to give
it a most decided contradiction in you? n-xt is ue
That you may be sure not to repeat such an error, as
far as I am concerned, I will myself inform you when
the event takes place, and also premiss you a piecs of
the cake, until yon receive which you may be sure, from
whatever source you obtain the news that it is fa se —
lam, Sir, yours obediently, Lilt Marsh. Woodstock,
Armidole, April 16th ” Well, we admire this, we do I
Now what will Miss Marsh say when we tell her that
wo not only received the information from sources
supposed to he in the last degree reliable, but were
forwarded a slab of the cake, a copy of the bast man’s
spsech on behalf of the bridesmaids, a tumbler full of
tears shvd by the bride, and a bag of the tice that was
thrown after the chariot. Under these circumstanc. a
wo were bound to credit the rumour But on the
whole we are glad it is not true. We reckon t hat about
five more washing days will about make the old lady
a candidate for lodgings

George Darrell (whom we have always loved,
and longed to take to out Abrahamitish bosom) scuds
us a letter, in which ho says:—“Contrary to general
expectation, and, in many instances, individual wishes,
1 am pleased to be enabled t® write yon that my drams,
“Tho Bunny South,” has achieved cn undoubted and
almost unparalleled success.” Well, there’s one thing.
Our consciences are clear with regard to George. Wo
have got grey-headed in the work of inventing enco-
miastic phrases wherewith to send him along. There
is not a single now and entirely original drama entirely
from his own pen over which we have not c xbausted our-
selves in praises. In fact, George, dear, wo don’t really
see how we can put any more in yourplate. When, how-
ever, we can think of any ** naw and entirely original "
form ef encomium, you Khali hear from us. Wo see
(with regret for the lovers of the artistic) that the
“unparalleled success” of “The Sunny South” baa
necessitated tho shelving for a time of Shakespeare’s
“Borneo and Juliet,” wherein Mr. W. J. Holloway
enacts with such sublime poetry the role of the love-
lorn Romeo. Wo have seen Mr. Holloway play this
part once ; and whenever we dream of it, in the ecstasy
of our enjoyment, wo nearly strangle our youngest-
born.
Mr. James Fletcher, M.L.A.
James Fletcher, the subject of this notice, was
born in Bast Lothian, Scotland, in Aug., 1834
He came to this colony when in his 18th year, and
after trying his fortune on several diggings, ulti-
mately visited Newcastle, and soon found his way
into the coal mines. He worked as a miner in the
A.A. Company’s coberies for several years, but
was soon found in the foremost ranks, as chair-
man, delegate, secretary—and spokesman at all
important meetings. When only twenty years of
age, he was unanimously chosen Chairman of the
Miners’ Association, and had he wished could no
doubt have been then elected to Parliament. But
ho preferred to go on in his own way, and was
foremost in everything having for its object the
amelioration of the condition of tho working
classes. Through his instrumentality, the hick
and Accident Fund at the A. A. Co ’a colliery was
established, and a colliery doctor was appointed
to look after the miners and their wives and fami-
lies. This was the first society of the kind estab-
lished in the colony, and they are now important
institutions. He also took a prominent part in
getting the present Ventilation Bill made law.
Whilst District Chairman of the Miners’ Associa-
tion of the Hunter Kiver district in 1861, he led
his forces with such determination and decision of
character, that a proposed deduction by the coal
proprietors of twenty per cent, from the miners’
wages was successfully resisted, And the young
man was looked upon with so much pride by his
fellow-workers, that they again wanted to return
him to Parliament Still he declined the honour,
and after leaving tho A. A. Co , he became manager
of the Minmi collieries for J. and A. Brown, and
was afterwards the originator of the Co-operative
Colliery, of which he has had oharge for upwards
of twenty years. As an employer of labour he
has always borne the highest character for liberal-
ity and fair play, and has never bad any trouble
in surmounting trade disputes or difficulties. Mr.
Fletcher has from early, youth taken the keenest
interest in politics, both at Home and in this
country. For the past twenty years, whilst residing
in the Newcastle district, he has been a leading
figure at every parliamentary election. He took
a most prominent part in the Education move-
ment, and was foremost amongst those who
established a league, having for its object the
making of education national, secular, and com-
pulsory ; and the late Eev. James Greenwood
complimented him on being the first writer in tho
colony who had struck the keynote through the
Press. Independent of the Education question,
he has always been a constant contributor to tho
local Newcastle Press, especially the Miners’
Advocate and Newcastle Herald, and his
clear, incisive, argumentative style ever commands
attention from all sections of the community.
After repeated requests from his friends, he
allowed himself to be nominated- for a seat in
Parliament at the general election for Newcastle
in November, 1880, and was returned by a very
large majority over the other candidates —George
Alfred Lloyd being his colleague on this occasion.
As a politician, he has always been a firm adherent
of liberal views, and brings to his public utter-
ances an amount of force which instantly claims
the attention of the House. He has always been
very pbpular with his constituents, and at the
last election, in November last, was again returned
at the head of the poll by a still larger majority
than on the first occasion. He has ever been most
attentive to his parliamentary duties, and except
when detained by illness, has been constant in his
attendance at the House.

Here is a story (from Melbourne) of the pecu-
liarities of law and lawyers. Ah Chow was violently
assaulted a short time ago, over a friendly game of fan-
tan. by Chop Hicg. Ah Chow at once engaged the ser-
vices of a powerful police court advocate, while Chop
Hir.g sought the offices of a legal gentleman of nearly
equal pretensions. On iheday of hearing. Ah Chow’s
adviser was not up to time, and the case wnuld have
fallen through bad not the gentleman whose services
had been retained by Chop Hing gallantly come to the
fore and taken np the prosecution. While defendant’s
advocate was opening the case for plaintiff, Ah Chow’s
lawyer hurried into court, and, looking round with an
amazed air, was about to address the Bench- when he
promptly took in the whole situation, aud devoted him-
self to the able defence of Chop Hing. Thus was the
majesty of the law upheld. Thus also did both lawyers
secure their tees.

Salmi Morae, whose “ Passion Play ” was pro-

is the finest thing of the hind ever seen. It is covered
by a largo allegorical painting called “Tho Bell of
Calvary.” A newspaper man writes: —“I saw tho re-
heareal ef the second and third acts on Saturday even-
ing. The Virgin Mary is personated by a Jewish girl
about nineteen years of age. She is of slight, well-
shaped figure, very dark hair and complexion, and
large, deep sunken eyes. She speaks in a high-pitched,
affected tone, and rolls her eyes in a remarkable way.
Her month is so large as to seriously imperil the safety
of the spectators in the front row. Joseph ia a good-
looking young raaa, with a fine voice and clear enunci-
ation, but he dots not seem to have had much experi-
ence in acting. Herod and Herodias were personated
by a man and a woman who seemed to bo professional
actors Both acted their parts with great good taste
and judgment. They laboured under the difficulty of
having to enunciate the mest jaw-fares king sentences.
Mr. Morse seems to have strung together a series of
obscure, entangled, twisted, many-lettered words, which
require tho closest attention in order to understand
their meaning, Tho actors literally choked ovec some
of his agglomerations of consonants The minor parts
were very well done as a general thing Both acts
wore short and extremely stupid. I could see nothing
in them, unless iheir dullness, which could offend any-

THE BOUQUET.
Close to the footlights
Stood the two singers,
Yet from each other
Distant some paces.
Young were both, fair both—
Dark-eyed or blue-eyed,
None could distinguish;
One eye of each, p’r'ape.
But their song sprang up
Bight to the ceiling;
Then it fed backward,
Ev’n as a rocket.
When, at its zenith.
Bursts into fire-rail),
Flooding the night-sky,
Flotded the whole house.
Just at that moment
Someone with fair hair,
Parted precisely
Straight in the middle—
Looking much like a
Cornfield path.parted.
Or a bisected
Pat of fresh butte r-
Bose in the circle.
Holding a bouquet.
Made up cf whatso
Flowers are in season
Poising it deftly,
Ev’n as a slinger.
Slung he it swiftly
Down to the footlights.
There it alighted,
Like a great blossom
Blown from a tree-top
By the strong South-wind.
But it it fell half-way
'Twixt the two singers—
And you can bet, sirs.
Then there was trouble.
Each glared at each, then—
Singing the whole time—
Each sidled slowly
Nearer the bouquet.
Then, on a sudden,
One made a dive, and
Bose up triumphant
Clutching the flowers.
Then did that young man
Smile in his sleeve, sirs—
He bed a sleeve made
Merely to smile in.
Smiled he yet more, when
She from the bouquet
Took out a paper,
Blushing the whole lime.
What moans t his pallor,
Sudden and dreadful.
Over her features
Casting a corpse-light ?
Briefly, ’twas this, sirs—
Bouquet contained a
Writ, for an unpaid
Bill for leg padding.
How did the other
Gloat on her grief, then?
But, after all, sirs.

PEPPER AND SALT.
The most ludicrous annexation that was e\er
made in this age of annexations was that of New
Guinea to Queensland. Leaving out the fact that it is
simply the action of a planters’ ring, and not the wish
of the Queensland people at all, it is sufficiently absurd
that thirteen men and a magistrate should plant their
little streamer on a river, send a proclamation to the
winds, and formally take possession of a country which
contains inhabitants able and willing to cat the whole
population of Queensland at a meal. But as far as the
annexers arc concerned, we know their game. In deal-
ing with the natives, gentlemen.
You will not conquer them by force,
At sound of fife and drum;
Yon have a better far resource—
You'll conquer them with rum 1

and the paper, in fact, contains more lies in one column
than wo have seen in any publication since wo last
perused tho War Cut. As a matter of fact, everybody
who has attempted to thrash Labby has got the worst
of it. Abbott, the big stockbroker, tried it when
Labouohere was writing the oity article for tho World
which ruined so many bubble companies, and got the
manager of tho Ce-operativo Bank 7 years, and In his
case Mr. L. just let Mr. Abbott touch him on the
shoulder with a cane, and then led him by the ear to
tho Mansion House, where ho was heavily fined by the
Lord Mayor. With Levi Lawson, his encounter on the
stops of the Beefsteak Club was but a vulgar souffle;
and tho same may be said of his fracas with Lambri. A
story is, however, told of another scrimmage, the result
of which is enshrouded in mystery. It seems that Mr.
Labonohere, wishing to let his house at Queen’s Gate
for tho Parliamentary season, entered into negociations
with the (then) member for Dumbarton, and in the
course of an interview at his residence, introduced the
intending lessee to Mrs. Labonohere. The member
being mnoh taken with the lady, invited her to his
house, and made her known te his family. Subsequently
discovering fas he thought) that Mrs. Labonohere
was only Miss Hodson, and Heaven knows what besides,
he returned to the house with a horse-whip, and ham-
mered the “ Besieged Resident ” soundly. This story,
however, is open to serious question for many reasons
—the chief of which is that Mr. Laboucharo alleges
that having complied with the various forms of law
prescribed in these cases. Miss Hodson is married to
him hard and fast. We don't know any more about the
matter than this, and we don’t care, cither. Onr own
domestic affairs are quite enough to keep us going;
more especially as at tho present time little Bobby is a
perfect leopard with the chicken-pox, and the hired girl
has broken a cog-wheel of the family mangle. If you,
sympathetic public, will add to this the fact that the
baker has mysteriously neglected to call for the last
two days, and that the milkman says “things” over
the palings to the servant about his little bill, it will
bo easily seen that we have onr hands full. A commu-
nication from tho grocer, to say that ho has called and
will wait until he sees us if it is until dawn to-morrow,
necessitates onr closing this par. prematurely.
It appears that some joker has been sending
Rav. Dr. Gilchrist, of Melbourne, a phial containing
sulphuric acid. Dr. Gilchrist is an Orangeman, and, if
we remember rightly, is, or was, connected with a reli-
gions paper over there. There are fierce enquiries as to
who was the sender of this phial. We think it was one
of the subscribers to the paper or one of his oongrega-
tion; either might well be pardoned, from what we
hear, for supposing that sulphur would be a valuable
aid to him in his literary or clerical labours In fact,
we have heard a rumour—though, of course, we give it
no countenance—that he writes and preaches under the
influence of brimstone. Sulphur would, therefore, be
an acceptable change. Dr. Gilchrist's own opinion is,
however, we are gives to understand, that the phial
was sent him by the Pope, who is understood to tremble
on his throne at the thunder of the doctor. And this
reminds us that Dr. Gilchrist is ono of the pupils of old
Dr. Lang, and inherits all his preceptor’s prejudices,
with none of his ability. Those of them who inherited
the ability are now either editing papers—not religions
papers it is hardly necessary to say—or killing mission-
aries in the South Seas. The others are, of course, like
Dr. Gilchrist, still in th® church. But, after all,
This phial dodge shows little wit—
A dodge for you too risky—
Say what would we have hoard of it
If it had hold rye whisky ?

It is reported that Sir Henry Parkes is to be
made a Baron. We can quite believe this We have
reason to, indeed; for happening to bo up the line the
other day, we tarried at Faulsohbridge station for the
coming train. Suddenly, to onr surprise, wo were
brought (for the second time) face to face with t£e
Parkesian tenantry. His appearance was exceptionally
brilliant, his bluchers being newly greased, and his
moles having that stripe down tho front which denotes
a recent purchase. On our saluting the tenantry as an
old acquaintance, ho pulled from his pocket a letter,
and proudly showed it us. Tho epistle ran as follows:
“Legislative Assembly, April 1, 1883.
“ Never mind chopping wood to-day, but mus-
ter and spread yourself out as mnoh as pos-
sible. Assemble the school-children also, and
come down to congratulate me on my accession
to the title of The Baron of Jamberoo.
“HENRY PARKES.”
Just at this moment the school approached. It was an
affecting thing. The little girls, two in number, were
successfully marshalled by three attractive teachers,
while the male school, in short pants and one of his
mother’s collarettes, was (this will toll yon about disci-
pline) completely under the control of the head-master
and his assistant. As the procession filed into the
train there was a great rush to the fenoe of the stock
belonging to the estate. This lowed aloud to bo milked,
and was with difficulty beaten off by the population of
Fanloonbridge, who was armed with a stout hedge-
stake. The deputation was received, in due course, by
Sir Henry, who, after reading tho school-ohildren a
lesson on tho “principles underlying the Constitution,”
asked the tenantry if the hens were laying. On reoeiv-
ing an unsatisfactory reply, ho cried—" Ob, my coun-
try ! how have I deserved this persecution of yon.” A
few minutes later he dismissed the scholars to the Art
Gallery, and told the tenantry to return to tho estate
after purchasing threepenn’orth of bean-seed where"
with to sow a crop for the forthcoming winter The
new baron has our congratulations, anyhow.
We have given up taking the Shroud now, and
go in for the Vanguard. By only spending a penny, we
find that we can so often benefit humanity by franking
a brother Junius over the Pyrmont Bridge, and by
soothing his troubled spirits with a saveloy. Besides,
the Shroud is feeble, lu the last number of it, we saw
that the wretched writers, conscious of their approach"
iug doom, had no more heart than a pocket-handker-
chief, and there was a gloomy pall upon the whole
paper. It was oorpso-liic, funereal; in fact, sublime in
its sol ?mnity ! So, wtold the butcher to wrap the meat
up in something else for the future But the Vanguard
is as for ahead of the Shroud in point of humour and
novelty as Alfred is ahead of the universe in the spell-
ing of a picnic par. The second copy of the Vanguard
is now before us, and we see by it that a Mr. W. H.
Ullmann is the editor. The last time we noticed Mr.
U. he was editing something else. Ho wanted money
then for “ the soldiers of Jehovah,” and now we see he
demands it for 11 Christ’s Work.” Anyhow, he seems
to want it all the time. The straightest possible griffin
respecting the spons. is administered to the Sydney
public. It is in these words Unless more eontribn-
lions come in, Mr. and Mrs. Ullmann will have to
leave Sydney to work in some other oity. Their
own small savings from throe years’ parochial work
are now almost exhausted, and tho expenses of
carrying on the Gospel Army, with tho strictest eco-
nomy, cannot be brought much lower than £10 per
month.” Mr. Uliman states that he has given np his
living in the Church of England at Enmoro, with £450
a year, to preach to tho larrikins; and tho result is
apparent on the next page, where he says, “ While at
the door, an urchin threw mud in my eyes.” To the
uninspired, it would seem that Mr. U. is in pretty much
the same state of mind that Solomon Eagle was when
he preached from the roof of St. Paul’s with a brazier
on his head, and no other article either of ornament or
of apparel to speak of. Not content himself with
haunting Snssex-street, and voluntarily making a
human target of himself for the odoriferous garbage of
that salubrious quarter, he has cnlistod Mrs. U in
the ranks, and they hold services and are bombarded
with mud in couples. Possibly Mrs. Uliman likes this;
possibly she doesn’t. Wo should think not. We read
that Mrs. Mioawbor one a cried, when hysterically
alluding to her husband, “ Ho is the parent of my
children! Ha is the father of my twins 1 He is the
husband of my affections 1 and I ito-var—-will—desert
Mr. Mioawber.” Mrs. Uliman, for aught wa know, may
havo ak good (or better) reasons for saying
the same thing. With this we have nothing
to do. But wa certainly are of tho opinion that
ladies are out of place in mixing up with the
crapulc only to afford a number of obscene hoodlums a
chance to unite blasphemy with their obscenity. With
Mrs. Sutherland we have no sympathy at all. The
ranting racket is her living, and if she were not doing
this, she would in all probability bo mangling—a pro-
fession in which the remuneration is hardly proportion-
ate to tho exorcise, Mr. Tillman’s paper, by reason of
its surprising ingenuousness, is extremely funny. For
instance, he says: “One poor soul of a woman kissed
one of our lady preachers in tho street on Thursday
night, March 8. She seemed to regard her as an angel
come to lift her out of her misery.” We are too
charitable to ask what was the condition of the woman,
or how many times she has kissed a mule, but tho fol-
lowing might possibly supply a elite; “A brother
of a man in a high position in Sydney was at the
penitent form almost as soon as the indoor service was
commenced. He was under the influence of drink,
though he denied this of course, in a conversation I
subsequently had with him.” Then we are told that
“ ono of our workers was hit hard on the heed side-
ways,” and another patty “received a blow in the
stomach which made him appear‘poorly.’” One girl
writes) from Stanmore: “As regard?l|my own soul, I
cannot say I have had a growth in gracewhich, we
suppose, signifies that since her conversion she has onoe
more gone out with her chap. Mr. Uliman signs him-
self “ B.A.,” bnt his paper is barely superior in point of
literary merit to the Bum. And this reminds ns that,
with a few exception?. University men are failures as
journalists. Take, for instance, the Archbishop, with
hia M mt-Cenis-Tnunel essays which ho calls “leaders;’’
Dr. Barry, with his resinous para, about the poor Pope
(how are yon, Leo, old ohap ?), and others equally well-
known. No Bum man ever, we believe, got nearer a
University than five inches into a college pudding
(wh ! ch is a polite term for plnm duff); but the fact
don’t save them. For a man who was Senior Wrangler
at Cambridge, we think Alfred is about the biggest
success on record. But, of course, we give the palm
for poetry to D. W. B. Sladen, B.A, I

We are always ahead|of our contemporaries in
the matter of religions information.—that is admitted
on all aides ; bnt now wo can fairly lay claim to have

“Dear Professor,—As I pen this I am
clothed in my Ultimo smile, acd have borrowed
from the Town Clerk his No. 2 snigger. When
I read of your fame as a wondrous meteoro-
logical prophet in the Murkaa papers, and the
jam fhat was generally ladled out to yon, I felt
disposed to modestly cable, * Pat a little on my
plate.’ But now, dear Professor, that it has
transpired that you can’t prophesy worth a
cent, (this is purposely written in Mnrkan) I no •
leaver echo tho above sentiment. Why, we
have prophets here who could give you three
falls and a broken knee-cap any time in your
line. Why, it was only tho other day that a
sporting prophet took 16 horses for his first
throe, and the 16-,h came in fourth. That’ll tell
you. That thore was no hurricane was a
disappointment to tho industrious o’ass that
gains a living by the goodly pursuit of appro,
priating wreckage; but when the thing didn’t
come off, they truly said : • What oonld be
expected of a man who goes to church with a
mme like Wiggins?’ That, dear Professor,
seems to be tho general opinion. But don’t
despair. As ycur talent as a prophet appears
to be so generally recognized in Boston, drop
tho meteorological, and try, with ns, another
line. Let us know who is going to be the new
Minister for Works; or what will be the
ultimate fate of a Rum reporter. Reply, I
entreat you ; but stamp yoar letters sufficiently,
for I am a poor man.

If the “ fatted veal ” had strayed in, we wonder whether

let’s give him a send off :—
Farewell, ycur Grace, 'twould be, indeed,
For ns, who love the Church so well, .
A poor thing not to cry “ Good speed,”
Nor sing to thee a soft farewell.
We’ve marked thee laying many a stone;
Thy thoo touched when thou did’st not heed;
We’ve marked how brightly thy face shone.
When it was time to clutch the greed I
Ob, thou art eloquent and great!
Of piety thou hast enough;
But still thou wilt, we beg to state,
Pe awful sick if it is rough.
A h, then will bo the time to pray—
We’ve scei it often done at sc a;
And, when that wouldn’t obase away
Tho mal de mer, they tried " P.B.”
Thou hast the people’s hearts all here,
The rich, the poor, the high, the low;
Yet fara may sing out—” Ho! stand clear,”
Or “Gaiters, hi I Look out below !’*
That would be sacrilege, indeed.
And our religions feelings shock;
But these small things yc u will not head,
Tho steward then will be your " rook.”
Now, fare thee well, on thv trip homo;
Thou goest to face the ocean grim ;—
And, stay—if Leo’s alive in Borne,
You might just give our love to him.

They've worked together, hand in band.
They’ve gorged their maws with greed;
Then why revere this senile band—
This band of crook and creed?
Their day is done; they flourished thou,
In Britain’s filth, and dregs—
When this our laud was manned by men
With iron on their logs.
Their time is past—the bigots’ reign.

Solemnly the night-wind sigheth,

In the dreary dirk it dieth
With a weary moan.

Ah, behold ! where shine and shade in
Mystic braid entwine—
Life, and Death, moseems that braid in

Scars of tender beams.

When your silver gleams

A VISION.
She was a slipshod slatter n, who
Was sornbbingion the stairs,
And drearily her eyes looked through
A mesh of tangled hairs.
And yet, methought, there was a trace
Of hotter things still there—
A remnant ef some ancient grace,
That toil did somehow spare.
A posing of the arm, a curve
Of elbow—and, wo think,
That in her eye wo did observe
A most decided wink.
She looked up suddenly—that face,
Where saw we it before ?
Surely not in such sorry case
As this at tho back door
Scrubbing the steps —a slave, a drudge ?
Then said we, with a start,
“ Tel! us yonr story—do not grudge.
For we’ve a tender heart!”
Then said she, in a sweet voice that
Time never could destroy:
" Oh, sir, I was a barmaid at
The Gilded Youths’ Dacoy.
“ And, since they banished barmaids, sir,
Out from behind tho bar,
I’ve had to ” —here we wept for her—
“Had to go out ar.d ohar 1”
And this was Jenny, once the theme
Of ev’ry dashing swell;
The law-clerk’s joy, the bank-clerk’s dream,
The pride of tho hotel I
How have wo seen that matted hair
Braided, and banged and frizzed;
While every petit-maitre there
The pretty creature quizzed I
How have we seen the gloatcrs come,
And gloat from morn till night
In that thick atmosphere of ram.
On her complexion whits I
While she, sweet innocent, did smile—
Smiles somewhat worn and wan—
Yet very cleverly the while
Made hay while the sun shone.
Where now is all that hay ? ’Tiasaid
That they the loudest laugh
Who laugh tho last. Poor Frizzy-head
Iter hay has turned to chaff,
'fwas but a vision of tho night,
A phantom of the gloom ;
In Jenny’s eyes still glows the light,
And on her cheek the blcom.
But yesterday, at set sf sun.
We saw her, dressed to death;
The gloater gang around—each one
With gin-fumos in his breath.
Her fingers blazed with gems—of piste—
And German silver oils
Upon her arms—tho newest taste —
She wore—some victims' spoils.
Around her snowy neck there wourd
A necklace with gilt cross;
If she’d a pound, she canied round
A hundred- weight of dross.
But, though bshind the bar she’s fair.
Yet, reader—here’s the rub •-
We liked her better on the stair.
And better at the tub

A writer in tho Australasian, speaking of

whisky would kill at forty yards, while insolence op-
pears to be the leading characteristic of certain waiters

what is more galling still, it is true. At the same time
the novel conception about whisky killing at forty
yards is, though grand and noble, bnt a romantic error
after all. The man who would stand forty yards from
his liquor ought to be killed, anyhow. But, as we said
before, it is a yarn. Our worst whisky for slaughter
will drop a man dead twenty-five yards from the place
where he drank itj forty yards is the poor refuge of
rum. With reference to the "insolence,” our Aus-

A great many people have a hazy idea that
“ treading tho wineprass” is a picturesque Oriental
occupation, and they know it is mentioned in the Bible.
Beyond that they’re innocent. They never dream of
the picturesque vigneron, either in his boots or out of
them, with unwashed pedal extremities, stamping away
on the luscious grapes in the tub, with dirty trousers
dipping in nnd lending a " body " to the ruby wine,
while perspiration and tobacco dust mingle and help to
make it rich. Yot this is the sight that enlightened a
lady traveller on a foreigner’s vineyard up North.

There is a newspaper proprietor in N.Z. whose
name deserves immoitality. Six months ago he en-
gaged a stout youth to work the old mangle he uses as
a press. The lad toiled as hard as a galley-slave, but
got no money, so at last he asked for a settlement for
hie half-year’s labour. "All right, mv lad,” blandly
replied the boss, “ have you any money ? You owe me
£2 12a.” The enterprising disseminator of news had
" st uck up ” the young man’s board at the nearest pub.
for 15s. per week, and gave him credit, for 13s. wages.
There had been no agreement, and the youth was “ had”
properly—so also was the publican.
The Sydney War Cry asks : “ Where will you
spend eternity, if you die to-night ?—Heaven or Hell ?”
Hell, of course: there isn’t any War Cry there. Ah,
and this reminds ns. " Happy Jack,” the champion
runner of this cultured production, thus describes his
method of selling copies “ I get on my knees before 1
stut, and get steam well up, and off I go. If I get a
little discouraged, I get on my knees In the street or
anywhere.” That’s the way. What a prize "Happy
Jack” would be to the Bum I He would be in Heaven
in a week. His knees would last about that long.
You can’t walk longer on knees without wearing them

In one letter in tho D.T., tram motors are
described by the following choice epithets : “ Those
insatiable monsters, the screaming yelling monsters,
these horrible screeching demons, these posts, these
screaming puffing nuisances, these sausage-tvaohints,
these messengers of death.” This is just the gory,
ghastly stylo of gibberish that suits the grinning,
ghoulish ghosts that read the Bum in their graves
beneath the rank, dank, green grass. It is signed
" Public Right.” The letters signed " An Admiring
Reader," "Pro Bono Publico,’’ "A New Subscriber,”
"Fiat Jnstitia,” "Public Right,” "Lover of Decency,”
and so oa. which the staff write themselves, are tho very
funniest things that appear in the Bum.

Blacks will be blacks, especially up North,
whore it seems the gay little heathen has been at his
larks again. From Normanton comes an amusing
report, part of which jogs along in this wise i—“ Mehe
met Ali, an Afghan, and the driver of Mr. M'Intyre’s
camels, was found dead at Walgonatty Station a few
weeks since. One report says, ‘Found drowrod,* and
another, the original, * Found dead with his skull split
open.’ The latter is probably the true version, and his
death is attributed to the natives in consequence of
Mebemet’s toying with their gins, and they would never
have drowned the man.” Mr. Ali, however, has one
consolation—he’s not the first man who lost bis life for
a siren's smile. Antony lost his through going to down-
tho-harbour picnics with his voluptuous ” eorpent of
old Nile;’’ and although the friends of Samson got
pars in the evening papers saying he was killed by some
falling timber, still it is now known for a fact that his
death was the result of toying, like Ali, with a Philis-
tine fair, who never cared a dump about him.

A nice young enrato came into tho parlour of a hotel iu
tho Northern Areas (3.A.), a short time ago, and sat
down. Ha proposed to spend tho night there A few
festive spirits—the Dick Swivellcrs of the district—
were seated at the table. With these the young clergy-
man. being of an affable turn ■ f mind, and believing in
St. Paul’s maxim of being “all things to all mrr,” very
soon became acquainted. After a little while tho party
proposed that they should shake for drinks The little
parson objected to join iu fer a good while, but finally
the fiend triumphed, and he yielded. They shook.
Seeing the pions innooent didn’t know whether he had
won or lost, tho wicked wags told him that he had lost.

drinks were paid for. This incident may amuse some
frivolous people—though we are bound to say it did not
amuse us; bnt wo consider that suoh ooourrenoas bring
tho ohuroh into disrespect and throw a slur upon the

Down in Temora the other day a mast-meeting of miners
was held to protest against the influx of Chinese to the
diggings. The chairman was especially eloquent upon
the subject. Slant-eyed Mongolian, yellow agony, and
all the other stock epithets were brought into play with
crushing force. But a Nemesis was on his track. Let
the local paper describe tho denouement “ Towards tho
close of the meeting an influential minor present rose
and asked the chairman whether it was true, as
reported, that his son was apprenticed to a Chinese
blacksmith at Upper Temora. Tho chairman admitted
that his son was working for a Chinese employer,
whereupon an indescribable scone of uproar and can-
fusion ensued, and the meeting, after expressing a
strong feeling of indignation, abruptly t'rminated.'*
Now, we consider this really hard. How should a man’s
private conduct be supposed to affect his public
opinions ? Evidently this chairman considered tbit
though the Chinese wore not good enough for him they
were quite good enough for his son. Lt a father is not
supposed to know best the value of bis own children wa
should like to know who is! We are quite willing to
believe that tho con of this philosopher was not lowered
in tho least by his association with a Chinese black-
smith In fast, tho only person who has a right to
complain is» in our opinion, tho Chinoso blacksmith.

The Bishop of Ballarat is, perhaps, tho most
booh-speaking prelate in the world. He has said
enough ridiculous things at home already to satisfy
any man with an ordinary appetite for rot. But be is
not satisfied. In bis last appeal to the whey-brained
creatures who support missions in Manohouna, and
send out annually shiploads of bibles to Spitzbergen, he
“pleaded for tho Christianization of the aborigines, who,
onoe Christians, showed themselves able to held their
own.” Parenthetically, we may say that your Chris-
tian usually holds more than hi* own when he hes to
deal with the aborigines. And here we take leave to
record c ur solid opinion that it is practically impossible
to mike anything more than patchwork Christians of
savages. Certainly this would not be much below the
standard of ordinary civilised Christianity, but even if
it wore on a level it would not be worth the money.
The reason why savages cannot be turned into Chris-
tians is be cans a they lack the mental grasp necessary
for a comprehension of the fl 'st principles of Chris-
tianity. Charles Lsland. in speaking of the English
gipsies, says that it is impossible to get them to un-
derstand any but concrete ideas : an abstract proposi-
tion clouds their eyes at once. Now, the English gipsies
are considerably ahead of the Australian natives It is
just as easy to make a blaohfellow comprehend wh it is
meant by subjectivity as to knock into his head the
faintest notion of ths Christian mysteries. Chris-
tianity among savages is a religion of the strong hand
“ If you kill. God will hate you, and we will hang you ;
if you rob, God wi 1 sand you to bell, and we will send
you to gaol " Leave oat the second clauses, and your
doctrine will have a mighty poor hold, indeed But in
the South Saa Islands, where missionaries are the only
white men in the place, force cannot be used, you say.
No: and that is oaa good reason why there are no
Christians there. W» have some pretty statistics
under our ban-Is which enable us to speak by the card.
The only way to make a savage remain steadfast to the
faith til! death is to baptise him—and hit him over the
head with an axa immediately after.
Inspector Lyons (who, as will be seen, distinctly
merits a par ) is now promoted from Tomora to the
charge of No 2 Station in Sydney. There are few
better known faces in the metropolis than his, and
thero is none mw* dreaded fcj the obnrch wardens of
the city, who snuffle all Sunday, and divalise their em-
ployers all tin rest of the week Detective Lyons
(before he was promoted to glory) was the hero of a
hundred fights. When a gang of burglars ware f armed,
and he knew of it, he used to go out with a dark lantern
and a gun and bombard them. Once a number of mis-
creants, headed by a desperado who is cow doing his
“ twenty stretch,” broke into Alfred's little bouse in
Woolloomooloo (that was m the pionio-par. period of
the great man's existence), and stole all his Britannia
metal. Tho case was given to Detective Lyons, and he
was quite sucooFsfnl in shooting ths ring-leader and
capturing the others. This is bow he worked itHe
got a list o^the things that were stolen, and then, hid-
ing in A fred’s coal-hole, he waited until the gang
should co ne back to kill him. In the dead of night
they returned v >wing vergeanca. Not only was all the
plate electro, but a trunk they bad carried i if at great

fallen over the city and the heavens were star-be-

Nature, and gazing with a guileless look at the planets

In a single season an oyster can lay several
million eggs, a fl h double that number if it is ip any
health at all, and oven the ordinary house fly, it is said,
can acquit itself of 20.0CO without any great strain
But a hen, whose eggs aie good for something, gets
black in the face trying to lay seven a week, and then
goes all over the neighbourhood telling about it. Nature
has made a failure of the egg business
“ I can imagine,” said the poet, dreamily, as he

The girl lives near Potts Point, and is conspi-
cuous for the amount of “frills" she puts on with the
neighbours. The other day, her Pa invited a travelled
Englishman out to dinner, and after the feed, when he
had exhausted the delights of the family album, he
asked her if she had travelled. Sho had never voyaged
further than Hubbo— but she didn’t “lot on." “ You’ve
been to Paris, of course said the modern Briton.
“ Cortainmong," replied the lady, conghing as though
she had swallowed a peanut. “And seen (he battle-
field of Waterloo as well ?”ha inquired. “May wee,”
she replied: “and here is a horseshoe Pa picked up
near Kougemong. We had it gilded, and keep it as a
souvenir.” But in handing it over, the relic of the
battle-field fell clattering to the ground and broke in
two. Then it was disooverd to bo full of sawdust, and
to bear, stamped on the reverse, the following legei d;

was then changed in a hasty manner, and, as we left,

Several thumping commercial failures m Sydney

After all, magistrates are to have, under the
new Act, power to flog larrikins. The determination te
vest this power in justice? was probably duo to Mr.
James Austin, who obligingly furnished a shocking
example by jumping on his poor old mother whim the
Bill was under discussion. James was ‘‘tent for
two months, the utmost Jegal term. Had he been a
mere patty thief, Mr. Dillon could have put him in gaol
far half a year.
The latest and neatest thing in colonial crime is
the advent of two young Tasmanian scoundrels, aged
20 and 17respectively, on the main road between Hobart
and Launceston. They shot a Mr. Watson dead, fired
his house, and shot at and wounded Mrs. Watson as
she and her children were escaping from the burning
dwelling. Soon after, they scalped and murdered a
mm named Holman, a driver of a cordial delivery cart,
two miles from Epping; then they sat down and
•• gorged " on his lemonade. They were captured by an
armed pirty despatched in pursuit.
New Zealand will soon be as bad as Ireland.
Landlords are beginning to giro themselves Irish airs,
and their tenants tbs K iceutly a tenant leased a farm
tear Christchurch from a wealthy landlord, and spent
all his money, over £1000, in improvements, his lease
being a long one After the money was ail laid out, the
proprietor took eviction proceedings against him because
he had not complied with a clause in the lease relating
t o the trimming of an old gorse hedge. The proceed,
ings wore suoooes'ul, the tenant was turned adrift pen-
niless, and the farm, trebled in value by the poor man's
labour and money,was re-let at a much higher rental.
Dr. Cortia, of Coonambls, the other day success-
fully peifonred tiaeheotomy on Edgar Bcurke, seven
years i f age, who was dying of croup. As most readers
probably know, tracheotomy is, perhaps, the most
dangerous operation known to surgery, and consists in
cutting throuvh everything in the middle line of the
neck till the trachea or windpipe is reached. After the
bleeding has ceased, this also is cpsi ed, and a silver
tube inserted and fattened in, through which the
patient b o xtht s and the croupous membrane is expelled.
The tracheotomy tube, or oanuli ns it is technically
termed, is double, and the inner one can bo removed
and cleaned. So great was the quantity of membrane,
that for some time this had to be done every twenty
minutes cr haif an hour to prevent it from be-
coming choked up The ordinary difficulties of
the operation were not diminished by the fact
of the doctor having to give chloroform him-
self and use his knife by the light ef a candle.
In the case of young Boutko, the cidwas converted
into a sort of tent by means of ho&vy blankets hung
round, «nd a constant jot of steam kept p’aying into it
night and day. Not a single bad symptom presented
itself, and the little fellow made an uninterrupted re-
covery, the canal a being finally removed ten days after
the operation The escape was a narrow one, and it
was only by means of the prompt application of the
doctor’s lips to the tube, and breathing regularly into
the lurgs for a few minutes, that respiration was re-
established So far, this operation has proved the most
successful one of its kind ever parforraed in Australia—
there being only two successful oases recorded to have
taken place in the colonies. Numerous congratulations
have been tendtred to Dr. Cortia from the medical
faculty on the success of the operation.
Milbra Nott, a good-looking girl of 18, was con-
victed at Arm dale assizes of Hie murder cf n young
man named Mitchell, a “lucky " Btannifer minor, whe,
it is alleged, had broken his promi-o to marry her, and
who, it is also stated, sednefd her. The girl met
Mitchell one day, and after asking him whether ho
meant to marry her, stabbed him morta.ly with a
knife. Miss Nott wa? attired in d<rp mourning, and
her face wis shaded by a h> avy veil during the hearing
of the evidence When found “guilty ” sfce fainted,
and she was held up by policemen to receive sentence
of death The Judge stated that ho would endeavour
to give i fleet to tbe recommendation of mercy made by
the jury. Thi Evening News expresses a hope that
Milbra Nott will have to pay the penalty of neither
murder nor of manslaughter. Why Nott? I o was not
clearly proved Ih it the man she knifed ever promised to
marry her, and there is no evidence beyond her own
statement to support the allegation of seduction;
though it seems to be the general idea that when he
became rich he threw over the girl he had
professed to love when he was poor. Wo don t
toink that this community is sufficiently brutal
to cry cut for the blood of any woman when such can
be avoided. But wo aleo don't think that, notwith-
standing Mr Buchanan's impassioned oration on the
girl's behalf, people in general want to see her go alto-
gether soot frte If young women, who m ;.y or may
not have bean promised marriage, and who may
or may not have been seduced, are to bo app’audedand
caressed by evening papers when they turn themselves
into feminine “ Joe Bradys,’* there will very goon be
eein in Sydney street s a cot stent procession of corpses
on shutters. The woman who is seduced under pro-
mise of marriage is to Ve pitied; the man who rums
her is to bo execrated But if he is to bo knifed, let him
be knifed legally. How about Judge Windeyer’s seduc-
tion bill? Were it understood that the law dealt
stringently with the betrayers of women, we'd have
fewer ruined girls and fewer knifed men.
For a persiatenly fiendish disregard of human
life and limb, oomm«nd us to the Government tram-
croeflings at the Redfetn Station. With no access
proper to the Railway, the only existing means of
getting there is by a zigzag hurry-scurrying between
aa endless succession of passing and ropaseiug oar®.
Hemmtd in on two sides by cabs, which are incessantly
darting backwards and forwards from their stands, the
only remaining space blocked by 'buses and ether pass-
ing vehicles, one would imagine the last per«ons entitled
to the fain f 08t show of consideration were the helpless
people on foot. And they usually get it. That such a
-tate of things would bo allowed to exist anywhere else
in the civilized wcrld no one outside of Sydney would
for an iuitant suppose possible. That it should any
longer te allowed here is simply monstrous In th»
name of decency—m the name of humanity and common

on the spot is not sufficient inducement, watch, if

POLITICAL POINTS.
A contemporary asks this conundrum “Mr.
Lucas is still a member of the Legislative Council. How
long would he be so it the House was elective P” This is
easy. Just long enough for him to get to the door,
Mndgee Taylor objected strongly to the ,£1300
expended in cabling the Treasurer’s Budget, But be
didn't object, remarks Jehu Bennett, to wasting £600
public money in his useless “ challenge election" with
M’Elhone.
The Orange magistrates to bo “ sacked.” The
correspondence on the subject, said Mr. Stuart,
would show that when they signed the address they
had done so in stupidity. But they would have to pay
the penalty of their stupidity.
The notorious 0. E. Jones finds himself “ in a
hvle." Ho has had to abandon his petition to the
Elections and Qualifications Ormmittee agaiast Finch-
ham, his rival, he having bsen naturalised as an
American citizen nf.er his departure from Victoria,
about ten years since, and having neglected to return
to his allegiance.
Bryan O’Loghlen, baronet, ex-Premier of Vic-
toria, in "hard' up." and they’re trying to raise him a
£5100 ” testimonial" for “ set-vices ho has rendered to
the country." Bryan is n patriot of the ueual type.
Lacking the ability to fight his way to a high position
at the bar, he has lived on Government billets ever since
he arrived in Australia.
In explaining the supposed detention of a
departmental document by him to his constituents the
other week, Mr. Stokes, junior member for Forbes,
made an extraordinary statement- He alleged that the
doou-rent was purposely ante dated at his request by
the officials in the Works Department, and handed in
an alleged memorandum from Mr. Under-Secretary
Rao to that effect. We should like some one to throw a
“ Kao” of light ou this mysterious ante-dating business
“The public absorbed the greater part of the Vic-
torian four million loan,”— Daily Papeb.
Now, genial Bent, you surely know
This statement is not true ;
The greater part, long, long ago,
Was just absorb’d by you.
Yon spent, yon know, 'cute Mr. Bent,
Most of your loan before 'twas lent.
The Victorian Premier, when deputationised by
the Orange Society, who want permission to hold party
precessions, gave a straight refusal. He pointed out
that, on 8t. Patrick’s day. a national, not a party,
demonstration, was made by Irishmen. The Orangemen
have gone a little too far with the astute Service. It
doesn’t follow that because the present Premier of
Victoria succeeded a violent partisan of the Pope that
Government should now allow a lot of ignorant ruffians
to renew their struggles, about ** orange and green ” in
the streets of Melbourne.
This is the official declaration of Mr. Herbert
Gladstone, M.P., at Leeds, rc Sunday closing:—"I
have always acted in regard to this question in ac-
cordance with what I believe to be the wishes of the
people. The closing of public-houses on Sunday is a
question which primarily concerns the poorer classes,
and they must decide it.” Out hero it seems to be
decided by a fanatical, deeply-interested crowd of pulpit
punchers, underground engineers, and an attractive
cluster of old women, whose principal objection to the
•• glorious vintage” is, that every time they poke their
own noses into a beaker the beer curdles.
It’s all satisfactorily settled now, and to the
credit of their sex be it said that it took tho members
of the Tamworth Debating Class to successfully up-end
the trouble The Irish Land League is solely rtapon-
sible for every assassination from Julius Caesar’s down
to the sickening murder of Lady Florence Dixie’s corset,
At least, so we should imagine from a recent advertise-
ment in a local paper which ran in thiswiseTam-
worth Debating Class —Town Hall—Debate This Even-
ing, ‘Should Australians subscribe to the lush Land
League, seeing that the funds are expended in assassi-
nation and outrage ? ,M Tkat are makes things
look rather blue for Redmond.
On tho matting of tho British House of Com-
mons there is a dark rod line ruled about a pace from
the benches. It is drawn so as to leave a space on the
floor wider than swordsmen could reach each other
across. It appears that in the old hot-headed days
members were in the habit of drawing on each other in
the heat of debate. A hint might be taken from this
by our ewn Assembly. A line —no matter about the
colour as long as the cord was strong—might be
stretched across tho House in front of the benches.
Members could hold on by this when they rose to address
the Speaker. Those who were too dyspeptic to stand
otherwise qould bo lashed. This suggestion we give
free, out of pure patriotism—which means that, when it
is adopted, our address is known.
Sir Henry Parkes’ head is evidently failing.
Since his return from Europe he has not said a single
good or forcible thing ; even his Speech at tho well-
drummed.up Sydney banquet was a miserable and
inglorious fizzle. He has not since he came back made
one astuti p '*>-a\move. His strategy in the general
election was b.j. ti ble. Ho was fool enongn to try
and coax the "Civil Service” on tho morning of East
Sydney nomination by that transparent “ anonymous
letter” dodge—a dodge just as thin as the Lady Dixie
corset yarn, or old Gilchrist’s sulphuric acid bottle
fake. He was fool enough to accompany and support
the doomed John Davies at Kiama. He could have
kept office had not his overbalanced brain led him into
the most obvious pitfalls prepared by the howlmgly
servile mob of lickspittles, bigots, toadies, and nonen- 1-
ties by whom he had surrounded himself a year or two
before—before his judgment gave way. And now the
played-ont old man is to the fore with a “loyalty
match box trick, whioh is derided bv the pnbho and by
all the journals save one —The Rum —to which the
judgment bereft politician is, it is said, now a eon-
tributor, and whose drivel-haunted columns would, any-
how, form an appropriate tomb for tho leavings of his
once vigorous intellect.
The current of the debates on the motion to
rescind the resolution of tho Assembly, censuring Mr.
E zekiel Baker for " conduct unworthy of a member of
the House,” shows that there are a good many members
who would like to go back upon that decision. Their
reasons are various, and perhaps do not all ho on the
surface. But in tho main they are that Mr. Baker did
not have a fair trial. Well, granting that the House
acted precipitately, and that Parkes made Baker his
own scapegoat, the whole case has been reviewed in
indeoendonfc tribunals, and Mr. Baker has had repeated
opportunities of stating his oas% and has availed him-
golf of those opportunities. Yet the verdict of the
public has certainly not been one of acquittal, it
comes to this, therefore, that the action of tne Assem-
bly has been endorsed by the public after the fullest
information was available on both sides. Ijven if the
Houso was only right by accident, still it was right.
The only result of Mr. Fletcher’s motion, if carried,
would be to give Baker a ohanoe of availing himself ot
some technical loophole for escape from a position in
whioh the moral sense of the public regards him as de-
servedly jammed.
Some Englishmen pride themselves on thoiii
Bible societies and heathen missions. Within eight
miles of Birmingham. 21.000 people exist by making
nails and rivets. Of these miserables, 16.000 are women
—a large proportion wretched, toil-worn girls, a
family of three persons may, bv slaving fourteen hours
daily, earn a gross sum of £1 per week, trom which
there are deductions for fuel and the carnage of the
nails, leaving scarcely seventeen shillings for the hard
week’s labour of throe persons. Mothers have been
known to toil at the forge till within a day or two of
their confinement, and to return to their work under
the stimulus of dire necessity in two or three days
after child-birth I These people rarely taste meat.
When tho bread comes hot from the bakehouse on
Saturday morning they eat it like wolves. Bat their
chief grievance is the “fogger”—a rapacious inter-
mediary between the makers and the buyers of nails,
who supplies the slaves with their 601b. bundles of iron
at the beginning of the week ; and when this material
has been converted into nails and returned to him, the
workers (on whose labours he makes a Profit or tw J
per cent i must buy his dear provisions if they wish to
get any more work from him. The foggor is even
accused of tricking the nailmaker by a sharp device in
weighing. In his general mode of dealing, the foggaj’.
without contravening the law, practically holds his
victims in slavery.
On the Nevermind, great sympathy is felt for
the Police Magistrate in his other capacity of Laud
Agent, owing to the peculiarly dtlicatelposition he oc-
cupies with respect to selectors. Wherever an intend-
ing selector looks about Budgeowuggerah, he discovers
that the choice lands are held by the member for the
district, or by a gentleman who boars the same name
as the land agent, and is supposed to be his brother.
When selectors discover this, they talk, and were the
land agent as chaste as ice and as pure as snow, ho
could not escape calumny under the circumstances. It
is this which elicits so much sympathy for him. His
well-wishers go so far as to say that it is perfect cruelty
to keep him where he is, under tiro all the time; and
that it would bo only fair consideration for hia feelings
to remove him to somo other district. But apart from |
the tender feeling for the land agent, much interest is
felt in the land holdings of his presumed brother, who
is in the Civil service elsewhere. Speculation is rife as
to how he managed to acquire so much land so far
distant from his home, and also how ha contrives to
fulfil the residential conditions Then again, there is the
additional complication that the member is believed to
be related to the land agent. And as the relatives of the
P.M. and Land Agent own nearly all the land on which
the township of Budge ewuggerah is situate, the keenest
delight is experienced to observe a liberal outlay of
public money on the development of that rising town-
ship.
In tlio S. M. Herald of Monday appeared a
telegram to the effect that Charles Bradlaugh, M P.
for No thampton. had teen acquitted of a charge of
blasphemy, brought against him in respect to somo of
his writings. A paragraph in Bradlaugh’p the
National Reformer, of 31et December, 1882, apropos
of the prosecution in question, suffices to show the
truthfulness and acc iraoy of the senior paper of tho
colonies in matters of this sort. An anonymous writer
in the Manchester Latest News was permitted to ask,
remarked the great English Radical, “why tho bias-
pbemous tracts, issued by Mr. Charles Bradlaugh,
M P , should not be suppressed, and why the National
Reformer should be tolerated ?” Tho answer was very
simple. Not one of tho writing of Charles Bradlaugh
had over formed tho subject of a blasphemy prosecu-
tion ; and so far ss the National Reformer was eon-
corned, none of Charles Bra'! laugh's writings would be
suprresa d while ho lived. It the editor of the Latest
News desired to tost the question, he might do ♦ hat
even Sir Henry Tyler, M P., had not yet had the cour-
age to attempt—ho might indict Charles Bradlaugh f >r
Charles Bradlaugh’s own publications. •’ This," con-
tinues the member for Noithampton, *• will at any rate
ba more manly than the course taken by Sir H. Tyler.
M P., for publications not written, nor owned, nor published
by him."
What's oil this hushing up, now ? In tho S.M.
Herald of April 8th is the following Parliamentary re-
port “ The estimate for £300 for Master in Equity
was then put. 3ho estimate was agreed to, as ware
also tho votes for £526 13a. 4<i. for District Court, £500
for Petty Sessions, and £919 for Miscellaneous Ser-
vices, The next estimate was, &j.” And here, copied
from Hansard, is part of tho discussion (yes, there was
a discussion, although tho Herald gives no hint of it)
on Miscellaneous Services ;—“ Mr. Suttor thought the
item of £450 for land taken hy tho Curator of Intestate
Estates required some explanation. Mr. Stuart:
An agent of tho Curator of Intestate Estates
was by him authorised to sell a piece of land
. . . . Tho usual instruction in such oases is to sell
by auction and for cash Tho Agent took upon himself
to sell the land by private contract on credit The
money, however, was received, but, unfortunately, the
person who received it got into embarrassed circum-
stances and the money had b:on lost," So, without
more ado, tho Government put the sum on the esti-
mates, to be paid by tho people of the colony. There is
something suppressed hero. Who was tho person who
received the money, and by what authority did he
receive it? How came the money to be lost, even
allowing that some person got into embarrassed cir-
cumstances? Was it paid into some unspecified per-
son’s private account, converted to his own use, or
made accessible to his private creditors ? If so, would
not either dealing bo equivalent to malversation, and
constitute either a misdemeanour or a felony ? Mr
Bawden, ex M P. for Grafton, was the agent who sold
the land. Who received the money ? What’s all the
mysteriousness about P
From the Howl : —“ Apropos of the Redmond
brothers’ mission, wo have the following epigram, en-
titled * The original land law’ by a Land Leaguer i—
When Adam by his Maker formed.
Was into Eden sent.
He gave him freehold of his land.
And did not charge him rent.
To this tho following reply has been furnished by a
Bishop
True! but ejectment soon was served,
For breach of contract laid;
And compensation was not given
For the disturbance made."
We are not epigrammatists ourselves, but we think we
can go one better than these. Void 1
But if man were in Eden still.
Where, bishop, would you be ?
Why, with your hairy ancestors,
On your ancestral tree.
Aoain :
Yes. but ejectment was not made
Till tenants walked in sis—
Before poor Adam was turned out
The Devil had walked in.
Once More :
Moreover, compensation has
Undoubtedly been made —
Tho landlord sent his Only Son,
Whoso life the forfeit paid.
Howl please copy.
The loyalty of Sir Henry Parkea has not always
been of the exuberant quality it takes when a political
advantage for himself seems to hang upon professions.
Tom Slattery has revived recollections of the fact that
at a banquet given in Melbourne on February 4, 1856, to
Mr. (now Sir Charles) Gavon Duffy, tho latter made
use of the well-remembered sentence, “ I am an Irish
reb >1 to tho backbone and sp’nal marrow,” and that, on
March 11, 1856, at another banquet given in Mr. Duffy’s
honour in the Prince of Wales Theatre, Sydney, Mr.
(now Sir) Henry Partes delivered a speech, reported in
Empire newspaper (then the property of Sir Henry), of
March 12—Mr. Parkea said: “. . . He looked forward
to the friendship of the illustrious mau who was their
guest this evening as a bond uniting him to this coun-
try greater and more powerful than all the rest. (Loud
cheers ) Although, like their chairman, he did not
profess to enter into the spirit of His (Mr. Duffy’s'
public life in his native country, he yet knew this of
Irish history and Irish wrongs, that had he been him-
self an Irishman—with his temperament and his prin-
ciples—ho believed he should have been a rebel like him
(Mr Duffy.) (Continuous cheering.) . . HS only ut-
tered in public what he had often said in private, that
if he had been born and reared as Mr. Daffy had been,
and had been a witness of grinding want and poverty
in a land which was intended by Providence to be one
of plenty, he would have taken precisely the same
course as Mr. Duffy had done. (Loud cheers)’’
Again, in 1851, Mr. Parkes spoke in support of a
memorial of which the following is an extract, and
might easily be conceived to have been an early utter-
ance by Parnell“ The very constitution of the League
prohibits the use by them of other than moral means ;
but they will not disguise from your Majesty their
persuasion that what was lately a grievance is rapidly
ripening into a quarrel, and their opinion that the
continuance of transportation, in opposition to the
united voice of Australasia leagued against it. will
peril the connection of these colonies with Great
Britain.” Speakingto the memorial, Parkes laid down
the makim that “ under all circumstances it was the
duty of a free people to resent and resist an attempt at
wrong."
The Town Council of Maryborough (Q ), after
deciding to refuse the use of the Town Hall to Mr.
Redmond, let him have it for his lecture. This change
was brought about in a very simple way. The original
decision was effected before Mr. Redmond’s arrival,
and in consequence of impressions gathered from the
Southern daily press But two of tho aldermen travelled
in tho steamer with Bedmond, and learnt tho other side.
A special meeting of ’ha Council was called at their
instance. Alderman Booker, a resident of 23 years’
standing, said that in the case of Mr. Redmond he had
formed a very decided opinion, and had not only ex-
pressed himself as being opposed to letting him have
the use of the Town Hall, but, if he had been present
at the last Council meeting, he would have voted with
the majority which refused to let him have it. Ho had,
however conscientiously, seen, reason to change his ideas
about letting’*the Town Hall to Mr. Redmond He
had fsund that Mr. E, and his mission had been grossly
misrepresented by a portion of the Southern press
He was no Kedmondite, no member of tbo Laud League
nor was he ever likely to be; but Mr. Etdmond was an
educated gentleman, a member of the Imperial Parlia-
ment, pleading what ho {Mr. Redmond) believed to bo
a good cause. Ho thought, therefore, that, seeing Mr.
Kod.yaond kept within the bounds of loyalty to the
throna and the Constitution, and confined himself to
fair logic and rhetoric, ho should have the privilege of
every British ciiizan—that of free speech. Alder-
mm Annear said that ho al-o had been prejudiced
against Mr. Redmond, but ho hud found from per-
sonal knowledge that his prejudices had been caused
by misrepresentation. Ho was an Englishman, a nd
believed in fair play. Ho had beard Rsdmond spank at
Goodna last week, and it was one of the best spaeohos
he had heard since ha left home It was eleexuent and
perfectly loyal, and there was not a single word in it
calculated to excite any angry passions. Ho had lived
sixteen years in Maryborough, and had always been a
peaceable citizen, and always been on the side of law
and order. A ad, speaking of loyalty, ho might remark
that there were a great many people who spoke very
loudly about loyalty who would not do very much to
show it—peopla whose declarations might just as well
he kept in the background. They meant opposition to
a certain class of people, mors than allegiance to Her
Msjssty Queen Victoria, Alderman Booker said that
he believed that the opposition to Mr. Redmond, and
the prejudices raised against him throughout the coun-
try, had been raise i by some malignantly-iuepirid
articles in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Even-
ing News. Now isn't it curious how widely the cha-
racters of papers get diffused. Here wo have the S.M.
Herald andE News quite well known in Maryborough,
Queensland. They don’t scorn to have heard of the
Daily Telegraph there, though. Humiliating 1

Mahuki, the Maori chief who assaulted Surveyor Hnrst-

asked whether ho wished Mr. Earle, a European bar-
rister, to appear for him, he r.nawercd: “The lawyer
who will plead for mo is a European, the jury are
Europeans, his Honor is a European, and I am a native;
therefore I do not consent.’* When the prisoners wore
informed Mr, Earle had been employed in their behalf
out of a desire to help thorn, and if they declined his
services they must be left to their own resources,
Mahuki answered: “I have nothing to say, nor can I
say anything. I am a Maori, and the Judge is a Euro-
pean. I did the wrong, and I have been brought here
for it. I have not the slightest wish to evade the
punishment. If it is for my good that the lawyer
should appear, let him do so; if it is evil, 1st him do so

to the effect that any expenditure of public money in
connection with a billiard-tablo and billiard-playing
paraphernalia for the use and pleasure, delight and
diversion of Members of Parliament, is unwarranted
and unjustifiable, and calculated to absorb in idle
amusement many hours that would te more patriotically

—" God has been merciful enough to spare to him
whom you mourn a source of supremo grief. He took
to himself tho old officer of tho Royal Guard, in order
that his heart might not be wounded, like that of many
others by tho spectacle of the army associating in a

A long letter details how what should have been
a simple official matter was complicated by red-tape
helplessness. A miner at Nana Creek, in the prime of
life, and. presumably, of health, was found dead in his
tent. His mates went to the only official person they
knew of on the field, Mr Cameron, who is Warden’s
Clerk and Postmaster, and who suggested that, a mes-
sage betaken to the coroner at Graf; on, about 44 miles.
A miner started, and arriving lale at night, went to the
sub inspector of Poiioe, w'- o told him ho had better see
the sergeant, who told him he had better go with a
constable further on to the coroner, who stror gly ex-
pressed his opinion that as men persisted in dying
every day in the bush, it was prcEosterous to exjeat
him to go 40 miles “ to see a dead man,” unless there
were marks of violence to indicate murder. It was
1 a m. After another interview with the sergeant, the
miner started away with the constable to got an order
for burial from Mr. M'Dougal, a squatter, who, how-
ever, said be was nor. a magistrate, and could not issue
it. A day and a night; matters just where they started,
and nobody’s business to do anything or know anything I
Eventually the man was buried. But nobody knows
how hs died.

At Philadelphia, about forty sports, for the fun
of the thing, put up two dollars each and induced two
Chimamen to fight, late at night, in a private room, a
catch weight battle according to prizering rules.
Eleven rounds were fought before Loo Hing deliberately
sat down, and in a tired tone murmured, *' Me catohee
plenty." This extraordinary announcement astonished
everyone, for, up to the time it was made, Loo had
much the best of the fighting, smd beyond an egg under
his left eye, a out lip. halPn-dozen bruises, and a fpw
other things, he was “ as fresh as a daisy.”
The first meeting of the recently-formed Pen-
rith and Nepean Jookey Club came off o» Saturday las';.
The Maiden Plate resulted in a win for Manfred. Eml-

defeated Saionara by a neok, Prima Donna S The
Hack Race was woa by Rob Roy, and Little Noll won
the Galloway Race.
The long-talked-of set-to between Foley and
Miller has been arranged to come oil on 26th May, in
Sydney, for a trophy, value £500. However, man pro-
poses, and the authorities of this very holy country may
possibly take upon themselves to forbid the exhibition.
Should the spar be allowed—and if properly conducted
there is no earthly reason why It should not bo allowed —
it ought to prove a good set-to, notwithstanding Miller
will scale over fourteen stone against Foley’s ten stone
and a half. Mitchell, who recently beat all the big men
in England for the boxing championship, weighed only
ten stone.
The second matoh between Captain Bogardus
and Dr. Carver was shot on 3rd March. Terms : 100
birda each, five ground traps used, both barrels, 80
yards boundary. There was no betting at the start, but
after about 40 birds wore shot the odds ware 10 to 4 1 on
Carver, and the rate was unchanged throughout. xhe
birds were tame and strong flyers. Bogirdns missed
two of his first three birds, and Carver led by two to
three up to the 85th, when Bogardus drew up to even,
and they shot together to the 93th, when Carver killed
the last 10 birds straight, Bogardus missing thiee.
Carver won with a score of 82; Bogaidus, three behind,
with 79.
The coursing season was inaugurated by the
Victoria Coursing Club on Saturday last, when the

According to the Boston Herald John L.
Sullivan has in his mind's eye a scheme for “ elevating
sparring, creating a more favourable impression of the
manly art, and te attract ladies to glove exhibitions.”
The paper alluded to thus gives it away : “ His idea is
that an exhibition and a lecture on the science of
sparring would be listened to with interest. He would
have a good lecturer to tell the story of the rise,
growth, and fall of pugilism, and by means of a stere-
optlcan or other views illustrate interesting events in
the ring. At intervals throughout the lecture Sullivan
and some other boxer of reputation would appear in
costume, put on the gloves, and show in a ring set upon
the stage how old-time battles were lost and won,
describing the effect of blows, and giving a general idea
of the principles of scientific sparring. Sullivan is being
urged by friends to give this idea a trial in Boston.”

Tho following address was made at the inter-
ment of John M’Cormiok, a well known New Vork
••sport":—‘‘Friends, The presence of death, tho
solemnity of the grave, has ever been recognised even
among uncivilised people by some rite or service
according to their custom. In this instance our de-
puted friend oxpressiy requested that no religious
rites should be performed over his remains; and a? the
new religion of Reason and Philosophy—in which he
was a believer—has no prescribed riles, I may be brief
and oandid. We here place in the bosom of his great
and mysterious mother the remains of a true child of
nature, once our friend, a man of brilliant parts and
nobility of character, notwithstanding his misdirection
and waste of splendid talents. He laid aside, as a
worthless bauble, the most beautiful of poets’dreams—
the doctrine of immortality— became he ’would not
have his sinking spirit buoyed up by Action, for he be-
lieved in no life beyond the grave. As the perfume of
a rose is Wafted away on a passing Zephyr, never more
te unite With the decayed petals, so is the spirit or soul
extinguished in the dead, and hero lies aB there is.

Land and Water. says there are now at least
four men-Raby, Franks, Griffin, and Thatcher, who
would ba backed to walk eisht miles within the hour,
but tho referee of the old school would undoubtedly
disqualify each and all of them if they showed no im-
provement on the style which is now allowed to pa 8
muster as " fair heel and toe." With a certain modifi-
cation and adaptation of the walk until it assumes the
“go-as-you-please” style, it would be comparatively
easy for a well-trained professional to compass nine
miles within the hour, and it seems extremely probable
that unless the present conditions of so-called walking
he considerably altered, such a phenomenal per-
(ormance will very soon ba announced Aa the Ameri-
can champion, Meagher, who recently walked eight
miles 302 yards within the hour, is expected m England
very shortly to match himself with the English cham-
pions, it is highly advisable that some tangible defini-
tion of what is and what is not fair walking should bo
speedily arrived at.
Commenting on the statement that Maoe had,
after leaving San Francisco, Cal., sent to Q- M- Robin-
son, the Olympic Club amateur, word that he would
back H. A. Slade against the latter for a naked fist or
glove fight, the Exchange of that city says : This is
simply a deliberate falsehood. Mr. Robinson stated to
an Exchange representative this morning that he had
received no despatch from Maco on any subject, nor did
ho anticipate one. In the first place Mr. Robinson
would not engage in a glove fight for money with any-
one, amateur or professional; and, in the second place,
Slade would not meet him even did he consent to a
match. • Ne mm knows better than Mice, said Mr.
Robinson, ‘that Slada is no good. He is clumsy, awk-
ward, uncertain on his feet, and has no grit. About
Mace’s counsel to him to be light on me, that is all
bosh. The only conversation that occurred on this
subject was before going on the stage at Platt s Hall
that evening. I said jokingly to Slade: You m not
knock mo out in the first round, to whieh the Maori
replied laughingly: ‘ You'd better put the shoe on the
other foot. Maoe added : ‘ Now gentlemen, make it a
light set-to ’ I have no disposition to exaggerate this
matter, but the truth is that Slade could not have done
more than he did in the last round had his life depended
upon the result,’ In regard to Slades wrestling
powers. Jack HalHuan, of Virginia City, challenged
him to wrestle for $500 a side, but Mace would not have
It. Slade is not a good man, and will never be allowed
to meet anyone of even ordinary reputation, unless the
whole ththg is cut and dried beforehand. Any number
of men can be found in New York of 1301b. who, to use a
slang phrase, ‘ could wipe the floor with him in fifteen
minutes.' In tho set-to in the Metropolitan Temple.
Slade went down before comparatively light blow
from Maoe, which so alarmed the champion that he
was careful afterwards that his leads should fall short#

to see Charles Mitchell (who has just won the boxing
championship) and Tug Wilson, who encountered Sul-
livan, set to. Both boxed on their merits, and the
result was a grand spar. Tug was as tiioky as ever, but
the youthful champion would not be denied, ana
repeatedly brought the Leicester ohampian to the
ropes. Mitchell really sparred in grand form, and,
though Wilsm stood up well, ho failed to balance
matters, and at the close Mito'cell had a decided advan-

finish The fight for the light-weight championship of
America, between George Fulljamoa and Patrick Gal-
lagher, was a desperate affair. Fourteen rounds were
fought in 24min. The men wore light gloves, or mere
apologues for gloves, to evade the law. Fall James was
the stronger of the two, and, as the opportunity offered,
ha took advantage of it to throw Gallagher oyer hie

Jim Elliott, the well-known prize-fighter, was shot and
killed by Jere Duns, a spotting man, in a New York
I restaurant, March 1. The murder was the result of an
impromptu duel between the men. Nine shots were
fired in all before the two men met and clinched. They
whirled each other about in their struggles, until they
stood before the cashier’s desk in the room nearest
the street. The struggle on the floor only lasted a
minute or so, during which the men hammered each
other with their pistols. Then Dnnn shook himself
loose and rose. Jim Elliott lay prone and dying upon
the floor.

"P.B.”
We hear—that is, it’s whispered—well.
We'll even say, it’s stated j
Th-t they—but whom, we cannot tell—
Are shortly to be mated.
Of course, it s not a theme for jokes,
But, as the fact’s invested
Wuh such a charm to female folks,
Why! we feel interested.
’Tis said an orator, who is—
But wasn't always—single,
Has gained a lady's heart, and his
And hers are soon to mingle.
That's right I To glad the he rrts of men,
Sweet women were created;
And soon—but there 1 youM knew all, then,
When P. and B. are mated
.In other words, Charles B. is the happy man.

in hair. Another, thence, wore a Spanish look, caused
by yellow satin and black lace in conjunction with a
■dark witchery ef eyes and hair. Parramatta brunette
■was in a handsome toilet that has escaped our memory,

We went to tTabborsall’a Bazaar. A very suit-
able name ; you leave your “ all ” there, and come out
iu “tatters;” or you would, if they had their way.
Some people call it a Fair. We don’t. It’s the most
unfair arrangement we ever saw—excepting Nooze
loading articles. There was a baud of music outside,
aud a band of music upstairs iu the gallery ; and inside,
the worst baud of ail—a baud of the most predatory
females you ever met. But you don't meet them ; they
come to meet you, block you in the doorway, dig you
with stubs of pencils, and raffle yon with raffle papers ;
aud the more you try to he outwardly polite, the more
you become inwardly volcanic. There are nice girls
there; but there are not above half-a-dozen at the most
that have any conscience, and even they have very
little. A bold, bad boy, in a Donnybrook hat and a
suit of graeu calico, with a voice like a cracked camp-
oven, shoved up a sixpenny ticket for a telephone con-
cert, iu which he sang. If he hadn’t told us that, we
might have bought one. Tho coloured crewell black
•satin suite of furniture, in charge of Mrs. John Martin
and her numerous and nice daughters is splendid. It
is welt set olf, but never “set” on. By the bye,
ihe stalls are real stalls, because the building is
a horse bazaar; and the horses will come in as
soou as over the—well, the other people come out.
Two sisters iu blue, with pretty hats and roses, were
(.carrying something ab.-iut all the time. Greade was
i their name—and their sole object. Miss Nellie Long,
iin ruby satin and so on, was a principal figure, too.
Miss Eckford, iu grey, was politely persistent; and
Miss Nellie Eckford, iu blue, did her best to make her
youthful millionaire admirers “blue” their money.
Miss Howard was in white, and how’ard to refuse I
Bliss Burke, in brownish grey, and two sisters in black,
ware reasonably pressing. Three sisters, bearing the
Teutonic name of Biijmanh, were head and shoulders
over the common throng, aud it wasn’t safe to refuse
them. Misses O’Oouuor wore handsome dresses, one
■old gold, the other garnet satin and pink foulard. Miss
Moralles, and her sister, Mrs. Culshaw, reminded us of
the laud where the cypress and myrtle,” &3, and
asked us f--r money. A central figure, in tho popular
plaid, was the lady who was the first bride iu St.
Mary’s new Cathedral, recently, Mrs. Geo. Marlin
There were otkers, and facts of interest, we should like
to mention, but when we were bankrupt wo left tor fear
they’d put us in the Providence Home along with the
aged aud respectable inmates.

At St. Francis’, last Thursday, Mr. T. J. Cummins
married Miss Annie Kerr —at least, Dean Sheridan did.
The bride wore rich ivory satin and Brussels lace, and
the six bridesmaids white and pink satin and pale bins.
After tho ceremony, tho party proceeded to Correy’s,
aid in the evening returned for a ball at Mrs. Martin’s
Assembly Rooms, whore Mr P. R. Larkin took the
chair at breakfast, and several toasts wore given.
Cummins is ann-kerr-ed at last.

Tiro Brethren of the Mystic {the Unity Lodge)
had an outing at Correy’s on the 11th April. About
200 were piesent, of all ages and sexe?, aad they put
away the eatables and drinkables with all the grace and
akill of a new M P. when he's just beginning to forget
hard times and get used to banquets. Toasts were
few, and speakers short. P. M. Westoott
proposed “the ladies. ’ We chronicle this toast owing to
its novelty, aud because of the eruest-uess with which it
was replied to. A little flutter was caused by the W. M.’s
wish t j initiate tho ladies into the order—j ust as if they
didn’t know all they want to There wore ladies there
got up in a style that would make us tell anything—
except a lie We couldn’t do that. The daughter of a
P.M. wore paaeock blue satin. A temporary resident,
with soft dark eyes, wore—a pensive look. We don't
recollect what elsa. Two lively little sisters from
Surry Hills were attractive partners, one iu blue and
whits sailor costume, the other iu white twilly
material. A loc il married lady looked s-marLiu white
and blue; and two Botany sisters iu black dresses and
bonnets wore pictures of grace aud brightness that
almost induced us to go in for the “mystic tie” at
once. Ashflold sent the “only remaining daughter” of
a popular alderman, in lilac sateen. Leichhardt pro-
duced tho sunny-lookiag wife of a Sydney merchant;
and in ruby aud unroou a pretty figure came from
Fores . Lodge. Carrey was as civil us ever, and the
whole picnic satisfactory.

Tho Petsreham Owl Club had another “ open
hoot” on Tuesday, and 200 ladies and gentlemen gladly
availed themselves of their complimentary tickets.
Two hours of songs, piano selootions, aad recitations
name first, given with various degrees of exielleace,
Mr. Andrew Fairfax, as usual, being a favourite. The
recitation of a tragic piece hy a gentleman showed con.
siderablo natural ability, which will, doubtless, be more
developed by culture A Pyrmout lady, in a pretty
dress of bias satin and lace sleeves, played a solo, and
Mieses Fisher a duet on the piano ; Me, Fisher was the
chief accompany is 6. Mr. I avia* roebations were funny
and finished. At ten, tho chairman asked whether tho
iadies would prefer fifteen or sixteen snore songs, or go
on to part two, dancing; aad tho gentlemen at
■once gave a most practical answer by commen-
cing to cleat the chairs cil the floor. Several
players furnished the rhythmiu tunes, mostly in good
time, and tome ten danesa were enjoyed before mid-
night. We may cgsoally remark that the handsomest
dress in the room was worn by a portly matron, and it
was of mauve voivid; and violet satin beautifully an-
nexed to each other. Also, that two nice girls wore
natty dresses of brown velvet top, silver braided, and
lighter brown homespun skirts, with broad and narrow
box pleating* alternating with streaks of the velvet.
Furthermore, that two little Newtown brunettes ia
black satin and bright crimson, with skirts of black
and white lace taking turn about in lateral rows, were
A* gay as a hex of paints. And, like loyal subjects, all

Tho Kondall Concert wag greatly crowded, many
people being unable to obtain seat3, or oven standing
room. It was a real success, musically, and another
proof of tho splendid acoustic properties of the largo
University Hall, which was deliciously cool considering
the throng, and was docked with fornery and geoa
taste. Such an attendance added materially to the
poet's fund, though no doubt, there was a fair propor-
tion of 11 deadheads '* During the reading of Kendall b
“ Christmas Creek," by Mr »herldan 9 intense stillness
was observed, broken at tho close by a perfect crash of
applause. # #
The popular Mr. George Munro (of M‘Arthur

and album of photo, views. An opportunity was also
taken to present a gift to Mr. Prod. Piper, who is leav-

WOMAN ITENS.
A lady who was a deaf-mute, and a gentleman
who was a foreigner and unable to speak English; went
to the rector of St. George's. Sonthwark, to get married.
Tho clergyman, after much difficulty, made out the
ohjast of thair visit, as he supposed, and appointed a
day for tho performance of the ooremoay in church
He, in fact, understood that they wished to be baptized,
and on tho day sot had provided tha requisite number
of godfathers and godmothers to answer for them
The regular baptismal service «aa used over them ;
they were asked if they renounced the devil and ali his
works, and duly signed with sign of tha cross. Though
tho service was not such as thay expected, they sup-
posed it was the newest way of solemnizing matrimony,
and departed, imagining themsalves man and wife.
Tho next day tho rector received from thorn a packag.
containing a piece of tho wedding-cake, and alittlo note
of thanks from the couple. Horrified at the discovery
of tho mistake, the clergyman rushed to tho hotel
whore they ware staying, explained the matter as best
he could, and hurried them back to the church, when
they were married this time in due and ancient form.
There must really be some good reason why a
fellow should hate his mother-in-law The Esv. George
Brown says that the New G Tinea natives’ hatred of this
relative was intense, aud a mother in-law’s dread of her
son-in-law was equally so. They dare not eat together,
speak to or touch each other. If a Papuan saw his
mother-in-law coming along aroad he would fly into the
bash, and she would do tho same. If he were asked the
name of a woman and she happened to be his mother
in-law, he dare not for tho life of him speak her name,
but would have to " eoo-e-e ’’. tor someone pise
to answer the question for him. Tho two principal
forms of oath among the race were-“If it is not the
truth, may I be a body to be eaten," or “ May I shake
hands with {or touch) my mother-in-law.” The- rev.
gentleman further says : “ As to the dress of the
people, modesty had frequently induced him to describe
it as sunshine and smiles. The entire drees of a Now
Guinea lady consisted of a flg-leaf which was growing
on a tree half a mile away from her. The diffi mlty of
inducing the women to abandon those habits, too, was
enormous. After obtaining the promise of an old lady
to pay a trifia more attention to the fashions, and pre-
senting her with a dross, what was the lecturer’s aston-
ishment to see her march into church with the garment
wound gracefully around her neck, evidently imagining
herself clad in full evening costume.
Among the brilliant coterie of beauties who sur-
rounded George Prince of Wales at Brighton in the early
part of tlio pro .eat century was Lady Haggorstone
whoso charms bad at first sight attracted tho admira-
tion of the amorous Florizel. But net content with
the general admiration which bis Royal Highness was
disposed to grant to all pretty women, her ladyship
was ambitious to completely captivate the heart of tha
heir-aepa: ent. Accordingly a fete ehampetre was an-
nounoed to come oil'at hsr pretty little villa near the
Spa, and her lidysbip was determined to charm the
Prince by assuming a rustic dress that would have
satisfied the taste of a Watteau. At her residence she
had a miniature farm-yard and throe pretty little
Aldernoj 0. When the Prince with his friends and at-
tendants had arrrived tho fair hostess came forward
from a side wicket, dressed as a milk maid, for the pur-
pose of making a syllabub for the Prince. She had a
silver pail in one hand and an ornamental stool in the
other Thus equipped she tripped along, with ribbons
flying from her dainty little milking bat, that hung on
one bide of her graceful head, and the smallest little
apron tied below her lace stomacher, till she came op.
poaite his Eoyal Highness, to whom she dropped a care-
fully studied, bewitching rustic curtsy. Then passing
lightly over the beautifully plaited straw, her tucked-
up gown showing her neat ankle as well ns her coloured
stockings, she placed her stool and pail conveniently
for use. Loaning against the flank of one of the
crossest-looking of the Aldorneys, she was about to
begin her pretty task ; but, not relishing this new and
strange companion, the animal at once commenced
kicking out. upsetting stool, pail, and milk-maid, and
then trotting coolly away. Lady Haggerstone rose,
covered with confusion, and beat a hasty retreat into
her little dairy, wb -nca she did not emerge again that
day.
Here’s a little Parisian chat about the Divine
Sara, My first interview, says the writer, was at a
dinner just before she want to America Eight of ua
sat down. There was Sarah, very charming that night,
in a simple Luther ‘brown cashmere, with a sheeny
ohenille shawl twisted artistically around her throat, a
bunch of wall-flowers pinned exactly in the right place
on her corsage, and—no corset under the dress, as
usual. I don’t know what we had at that Havre dinner ;
everything seemed mixed up, but it doesn't matter.
Sara made a delightful hostess, quits dropping the
actress for the time and becoming pleasant, unaffected,
and lively, though not quite proper, perhaps. We joked
all the while, and from oaginniog to end of the repast
Sira overflowed with anecdote and good-humour. Not
a whisper of “nerves" disturbed the harmony of the
evening. Pew have had the luck to hoar Bernhardt
sing; those who have not have missed something. She
has not a fall or powerful voice, of course, but it is
what the poet would wish all voices to be, “ low, and
tuned to s weetness.” The anecdotes ? Hem I Well,
no; they would not all of them bear repeating, cer-
tainly. There was that tale about the Prince of Wales,
for instance, which elicited such a dismayed “Ohl"
from the lips of a virtuous and proper young English-
women who was present. It seems the spirituelle Sara
had only been in London a short while, and hadn’t
mistered the language, and as she sat musing how to
address a certain noble duohess whose house she was to
visit that night, the door opened and His Eoyal High-
ness was announced. She snatched the opportunity
and begged him to help her out of the difficulty. Well,
H.E H. is a terrible fallow ; but it was too bad of him
to play it that day upon Sara whan she put her trust in
him. How, think you, did this degenerate son of
Qnsen Victoria repay the touching coniidanoo shown
him? By patting into the month of the unsuspecting
and lovely artiste a speech so exceedingly and “ awfully
awful " that even when it was repeated that day at the
table, in French, it elicited that sudden “ Oh 1” from
the young Englishwomen, and a long, deep breath from
everyone else. An! the bast of it was that in ihs inno-
cence of her heart Sara actually greeted the duohess
that night with the—with that dreadful phrase, and on
her ladyship recoiling with horror, smilingly repeated
it, thinking it was not understood ! It was a Inlliaat
evening, and the groat actress seemed very little
troubled at the thought of leaving her native country
next day. My last interview was the other night, in
her room at tho Vaudeville. Threading through a long
and dingy corridor, I entered her small, pretty, bril-
liantly lighted bondoir. fhe stage call woe expected
every momtnt, aad Sira, ready costumed, rouged, and
powdered, stool in front of her Pompadour oheval-
glass, taking a final look at her lovely sell in it. What
had she en ? I hardly remember, tor I was looking at
the wearer of the dress more than the dress she wore.
Something very dieolleUe and white, with bare arms,
and a heavy white train. A thick, rich silk, I think,
spangled with sivar. It fairly astonished me to s.e
how comely and plump sara had got Ob, there is not
the very faintest doubt about it I saw her too closely
to have baan deceived, anl her diesa was too low. We
only chatted a moment, and then like a vision she was
epitited away, and the next moment was weeping and
straining in passionate rage with all that tremendous
emotion that she brings to the creation of Fedora.

Patti is now exactly 40 At a dinner party two sisters
were present, one a widow who had just emerged from
her weeds, the other not long married, whose husband
had lattly gone out to India. A barrister took the
young wido v in to dinner. He was under the impression
that his partner was tho married lady whose husband
was in India, The lady remarked how extremely hot it
was. " Ylh, it is very hot,” replied the barrister. Then
a happy thought suggested itself to him, and he added,
with a chesrful smile, “ But not so hot as the place to
wiiicliycur husband has gone." When a fond father

the use of her name. It is wrong to suspect those
things; but then one half the world is to blame for it
in having given the other half good cause to be aus-

Series of Letters to the New South Wales Public
ne wspapers by
EDGAR JAMES GODFREY,
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
“We’ve made Charley Blank one of one
nwVhwirdens,” remarked * reverend parsoness in
Oiaansland the other day. ’* Whatl that larrikin?"
wXimad her hearer. “ Well, you see,” explained the
narsoness, rather abashed, "you see it will be euoh a
p>od opportunity to convert him I"
The Witness (Presbyterian) waxes wroth be-
n30 the Liberal is sold on Sunday, and wants to
know "if this license is to be permitted." Is it aware
that the WAR Crt is shontod out all over the Domain
It rv Sunday ? la it aware that the S.M. Herald is
Tn t on Sunday night ? Isn’t it just as bad to print
a papsr on Sunday as to sell it on Sunday ?
A family in one of the suburbs of Sydney was in
the habit of playing cricket on Sunday afternoons. A
iiinne neighbour of theirs was very much shocked at
the desecration of the Sabbath, and made formal objec-
t'ona both to the parties oonoern-'d and to the police!
Tha plots* oh joe tor had a short time before been re-
acted to "resign” his appointment owing bo itregu-
luritie# in his accounts.
“ Pastor*’ Allen, who continues to insult New
South Wales by posing as a repre&entiva Protestant,
Mve a bigoted " religious” leoturo at Melbourne the
other night, and had fifty persons present. Ealigions
fanaticism if being gradually cqleczad out. " Daniel
Allen Pastor," can now-a-days no more gat white men
to fly at eaih other’s throats than Te Whiti and
Mabukse can get the Maorias to rise against their
white neighbours.
The most pertinent statement the Peesbtte-
eiar over made is this, whioa appeared in its last
jggu’, <• It is a question with many what policy should
be pursued with regard to those who denounce Chris
tiinity For most men, the most eonvinoing kind of
Christian evidence is that of a Christian life ” Why,
certainly. And this is tha reason why scoif irs are not
convinced of their error—the “ evidence " is so rarely
forthooming.
At Newcastle, on* Walsh died—and was refused
Christian burial Dy the local priest. WaLh had beou
_uil’ y of the ecclesiastical crime of allowing his children
to attend a Stats school "la all other respects he was
a good Catholic." And now there is the usual howl
ovir Walsh’s grave. Tha priest is consistent—Walsh
was inconsistent. He shouldn’t have bees a Eoman
unless he was prepared to swallow the whole hog—to
gulp down and unconditionally tubsenbe to even the
thinnest theory propound d by Holy Church. It Walsh
was “a good Citholic,” he must have gone to Confes-
sion, and used the priest as a mediator between himself
and tha Almighty; and it Mr. Walsh confessed his sins
at the foot of a priest, and was content to abide by that
priest’s diotum, it was surely most illogical and an-
basineealike of him to throw the priest over at any time
or in any respect—even in the very small matter of his
children’s edueition. There is a beautiful uniformity
in the BomUh Church. You must take the whole lot,
or none stall. The Romm Catholics (when thoroughly
ignorant) unrorervedly believe all the priests tell them.
People who ptofssi to subscribo to other of the current
creeds simply laugh at more than half that proceeds
from the months of their ministers.
There have been—and let na say it with humble
reverence—a number of new apparitions at Eaook. We
are indebted to Arobishop Vaughan's paper, The I x-
peess, for this blessed information. < he most hardened
unneiiever must be convinced this time ; the most
sceptical must cease to sneer, i he witnesses are above
suspicion, consisting, as they did for the most part, of
policemen and priests. Nobody would doubt the word
of a policeman, and priests, bring wholly disinterested
parties, the evideno remains as sound as a bell. The
“Nun of Kenmare,” who knew all about the affair from
the beginning, has (dear lady I) let us all into the holy
secret. “ At first,’’ she says, *• they saw simply flashes
of light at each side of the gable, and ttars moving
hither and thither.” We ourselves used to see stars in
our visionary moments, now we only see dogs with
eyes of flee; but, mea culpa, we are sinners., Then it
seems they saw ligh a line gig-lamps j and to quote once
more from the Nun j “I asked Constable Csilms what
size tha lights were, and how he could best describe
their nature. Ha lifted his hat from the table beside
him—he a homely poliooman—and .... said the
lights were about ihe size of the crown of his hat.”
tv he can doubt the veracity of the visions after this?
When a homdy policeman is so lifted up and carried
beyond himself as to " lift his hat from the table ” and
give utterance to the inspired simile " about the size of
the crown of this," the heart must be callous indeed
which remains obdurate. Scoffers may say that they
cannot see anything heavenly in flashes of light, and
•tars, and gig-lamps appearing upon the gable cf a
church, and that they cannot discover any connection
between these and the Mother of the Most High;
bat there will be scoffers everywhere. Also, people who
A“cot to be enlightened may hold that thesa are vary
paltry juggleries for the Solemn Majesty that dwells in
the star.deptha to condescend to; but such people are
